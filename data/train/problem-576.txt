Mycroft sighed.
How little they knew. Maybe Sherlock should come out to them. Destroy their fantasy once and for all, and make it clear that either they accepted their children the way they were or they wouldn’t have them at all.
“That doesn’t bother me.”
Greg grimaced at the accusation, looking guilty. Finally.
“Well, tough luck. I’m a doctor. It’s my job.”
“How are you feeling today?” John asked, carefully glancing at Sherlock.
John’s right shoulder scrunched in an uncomfortable grimace. Sherlock rolled his eyes, patience wearing thin.
“Sherlock please.”
“Like Mrs. Hudson renting this flat to you practically for free?”
“Greg must have tracked that in, then. You know how much he likes petting dogs at the park.”
Greg nodded.
“You can let go,” he said. “I’m not going to use it.”
Mycroft put milk and sugar into his cup and stirred.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand, then stood up on his tiptoes to kiss his cheek before turning back to the kettle and pouring them two cups.
“So what do you want to do? Carry on like we have until now, only with this?”
Wait. The kitchen. The fingers.
As soon as she moved to London, it was apparent that she and Sherlock had grown attached to each other during the case. They had visited each other in the seven months since, and nothing less than sincere affection would motivate a landlady to charge her tenant less than half of what the property was worth. Mycroft had been prepared to beg Sherlock to let him pay for the flat, as the spacious accommodations and pleasant location would improve his mood immensely, but there was no need. Sherlock could foot the bill himself with those generous rates.
Sherlock spared only a glance to the cabbie’s surprised expression before turning away, staying only long enough for Greg to cuff him and read him his rights. More of the sniffer dogs came down, including Sally, who regarded him with her usual resentful incredulity, but didn’t comment as she went to assist her boss with the arrest. Sherlock pushed past them and returned to his flat. His breath burned in his throat, shallow. His mind swam, tired and aching with frustrated theories which would never be answered now. They had the killer. All the evidence they needed to prove his guilt was at their fingertips, but he would never get all the answers he needed. John approached him as soon as he returned to the flat, concerned, always so concerned. Mrs. Hudson was little better, but she knew to leave him alone in these moments while he sorted himself out.
Sherlock shocked himself by the swell of emotion arising within him at that simple gesture. He nodded, biting his bottom lip.
“On and off since I was sixteen. I couldn’t indulge much at school, but it got easier in uni. Mycroft caught me at it a lot. He tried to get me to stop. I didn’t listen. After he found me in a drug den, so out of it that I could barely move, he just made me promise to write down what I was about to take so that when he found me, he could give me the proper, medical care. I indulged less after I met Victor. The habit got harder to sustain after we became flatmates, although I wasn’t as interested. Eventually, I stopped altogether, although the urge still came over me at times. But I got better at it, until… Until he left.
“Please don’t lie to me about anything like this again,” he said, meeting Greg’s eyes, which sparkled with relief.
They got out of the car. Mycroft was waiting by the door, looking off to the beach, though he had no doubt been watching them from the corner of his eye. That somber, pensive expression was back on his face. What did it mean? What was he up to now? John opened the door and they went inside. Sherlock went to his usual spot on the sofa and sat down, looking at John, who was trudging slowly toward the stairs.
“Freak out? What are you keeping in your kitchen that might make me freak out?”
Oh for…
“Precisely,” Mrs. Hudson said. “But it’s not as bad as all that. Sherlock really is a kind soul beneath all that.”
John snorted.
John looked down at the mattress, flushing at the impact that Sherlock’s words were having on him. John lied back down and reached for Sherlock, slipping his hand across his cheek down to his nape, a bright smile on his face that made him even more delightful to look at.
Mycroft raised a brow at him.
As soon as John put down his fork, Sherlock did as well, too eager to get to the better part of their evening to care about his body’s need for nutrition. He’d consumed enough for his stomach to leave him alone for a while. But John remarked on the “coincidence” and made him continue eating until Sherlock was able to convincingly declare himself “full”. They couldn’t lie down right away without their stomachs cramping up, so they cuddled on the sofa for a bit while watching telly. Rather, John watched telly, for Sherlock tossed his legs on John’s lap and rested his temple on the top of John’s hair, arms wrapped around his shoulders. John reached up and rubbed his nape.
“Is this good?” John asked.
John shut his mouth with an embarrassed grimace that might be one of the cutest things that Sherlock had ever seen. How had Sherlock gotten so lucky to be saved by this beautiful, fascinating man? Who cared what Mycroft thought? Chasing that burglar on the beach had absolutely been the right call.
He asked John to pick him up at the bookshop. John found him halfway through the folklore book on a chapter about islands that mysteriously appear out of the fog only to never be seen again by the clueless, 18th century sailors who hadn’t even figured out longitude other than dead reckoning.
Sherlock started at the sound of John’s voice.
“Oh, I don’t think so. Far too public. I prefer to keep things off the record.”
“You haven’t seen my flat yet,” Sherlock said, raising his head.
“You’re certain?”
“Not yet. I’ll call from the car. Which I could have hopped to perfectly fine.”
“Oh, I’m not doing it for you. I have someone else in mind.”
“Greg?” Sherlock asked. “What is it?”
“Like I said. Narrow-minded.”
The complaints always came. Always.
“I’ll call her,” Sherlock said. “But stop tying yourself into knots over this.”
“John,” they both said, practically in unison, but a tad out of sync.
“It is a sprain,” John said after examining it. “Still, you should go to hospital to get an X-ray.”
“I’m not the one who looks like a dog’s chew toy. What the hell is going on with you?”
“Not everyone panics, though,” John said, but he began to look pensive. “Some people are delighted. And she’s pretty sturdy. Look, we’ll be careful, alright? I don’t have to transform while I’m there.”
“That’s rather maudlin for you.”
“I need to tell him that you saved my life.”
“I don’t know anymore. I didn’t think anything of it and you said not to change anything in the flat just for you, but Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson got into my head, and now I don’t know whether you’re going to freak out or not.”
Until Mycroft had ruined their perfect image of the son they thought they had, that is. Now Sherlock looked better in their eyes. At least he was straight and not hooking up with random strangers. He would find a respectable wife some day. He just needed a little time.
“I did. I’m not mollycoddling you, but you do need to eat.”
Had John’s confessed attraction been romantic? He hadn’t specified. His haste to reassure Sherlock in this manner suggested that it was.
“Earlier, I should have asked how your month went. I could see that you’re still separated from your wife and that it had not gone well, so I didn’t see the point in asking you what I already knew, but I can see how that might have felt a bit one sided to you. So I’m asking now.”
Mycroft sighed.
As the notes carried to a close, Sherlock lowered his violin to his lap and bowed low, cheeks flushed from playing and the thrill of John’s applause.
Sherlock hopped onto his feet and rushed upstairs as quickly as he could, which still wasn’t very fast at all, but John held his hand to make up for it. They stripped down to their pants again and lied down on the bed, this time with John in front while Sherlock curled himself around his back. He tried laying his right leg over John’s, but his injured ankle protested the position, so he had to put it back down on the mattress. Due to John’s smaller frame, Sherlock was able to tuck his head under his chin and nuzzle the top of it with his nose. John grabbed Sherlock’s right hand with both of his and massaged his fingers. John’s warm presence felt heavenly. Sherlock could lie here forever and be content.
“I don’t know about you,” Greg said, stepping forward, fingers curling nervously at his sides. “We already connected more than we ever had last week, but… For us, for me anyway… This is one of the greatest way that we express friendship. If the people involved are into it, that is. What I’m trying to say is, I feel like we’re closer now.”
“What are you doing?” Sherlock hissed at John. “He was almost out the door.”
If only that could have lasted through the next day. Mothering Sunday was bound to bring unpleasant associations for the both of them. Doubly painful ones in John’s case. His mother had died when he was a teenager, then his family had ousted him like a piece of rotten rubbish. Sherlock didn’t feel like he had the right to complain about his own reluctance to celebrate his own mother with John looking so glum as they prepared breakfast that morning. He kept gazing wistfully out the window, sadness in his eyes, but Sherlock’s inquiries about his wellbeing resulted only in forced smiles and a halfhearted,
“You know what I mean, dear,” she said. “And you did just kick him out of his own home.”
Wolf hair? So Greg had transformed for him. Did Mycroft not like that? Why wouldn’t he? But there had to be some relation between one thing and another. From the misery in Mycroft’s voice, if Greg hadn’t said that he and Mycroft hadn’t slept together in years, Sherlock would have thought that Greg had just broken up with Mycroft. Greg’s message was disturbingly contrary, too. First he used an annoyingly vague “great”, but ended by saying that it had only been “okay”. Nor did he give any detail other than the wolf hair. A quick quip, some light humor. After how nervous he’d been today and the tête à tête they’d had, Sherlock had expected a bit more. He shouldn’t even had had to ask. Usually, Greg would just have told him. Why would Greg clam up now? Just what exactly was going on between him and Mycroft?
Sherlock peered at the skin. Didn’t humans who possessed a selkie skin have mastery over them? John pulled the skin behind him, guessing Sherlock’s thought.
“You’re sure?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock scowled. He looked pointedly at John, who was frowning at him, looking awkwardly put upon.
Despite her earlier reprimand, Mrs. Hudson’s lips twitched upwards for a second before she smoothed then back down.
“And if I were a selkie, I would be bloody brilliant at catching flounder.”
“It’s far too early to have to listen to your voice,” Sherlock answered, pacing around the bedroom.
“Fine,” he said. “But no more stalling, please.”
. To John’s tender voiced assessment of Mycroft as a good brother. To his own shame at putting that look of terror in Mycroft’s face when he’d shaken Sherlock awake, mind lost in a miasma of his own devising, barely coherent enough to hear Mycroft pleading for him to wake up.
The cut was barely above a centimeter long and it was shallow, nothing to worry about. Unlike that seal skin. What kind of doctor went about clad only in a seal skin? But the seal had been real. Sherlock had been momentarily crushed under the weight of it, had felt the sleekness of its muscles, had heard it growl. And that gash tearing the thief’s throat apart. No human teeth had done that.
John’s eyes narrowed.
Sherlock thought about it.
“Well, uh, John is into that stuff. And there is a certain aesthetic value to it, I suppose. My inspiration may have been stagnating for a bit and he helped me jump start it again. It is rather interesting from an artistic point of view. Shakespeare used all sorts of mythology in his works all the time and that’s the same level of… fanciful folklore.”
“You’re on,” he said.
“I told you. I’m fine.”
“I know, Sherlock. I shouldn’t have—”
Greg. He really should start thinking of him as Greg. Not that he was on first name terms with everyone on the very tiny list of people who knew that he was aroace. But Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson might have a point about his omission of Lestrade’s first name from his memory. It hadn’t occurred to him to ask how Lestrade’s—
“I would be concerned if you didn’t. It has only been four months, after all.”
John left the room, returning soon with his medical kit. He checked Sherlock’s cuts first, declaring them free from infection. His touches were gentle, lingering only as long as they were needed. Sherlock sucked in a quiet breath every time that those warm fingers grazed his skin. The sense memory of sleek flippers rose in his skin, possessing deadly strength that Sherlock had witnessed with his own eyes, yet gentle as they grasped him, only showing him his power, the magical wonder of his true self, large, blue eyes pleading with him to understand that this was him as well, this incredible event was real, that there was more to this world than Sherlock’s limited knowledge had perceived. That Sherlock was safe with him. Those strong limbs would heal him, not hold him down while vicious teeth tore at his throat.
John took a deep breath.
“They can sense we’re not like them,” John had said.
“I don’t think he meant anything by it. Though you would know better, of course. But… I think he wanted to make sure that I wasn’t treating this like some casual fling, which I’m not. That I understand your needs. I told him that we can figure that out on our own. That I’m taking this just as seriously as you are. That you’re important to me. And… yeah.”
“The truth. Who is he and why have you stayed in contact with him?”
“Yes. It was surprisingly easy to converse with him. I won’t discomfort you with details about our other activities. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed his company very much. What I had hoped to keep short became a much longer connection. We went on more dates and kept in steady communication. He’s a generous, loving man. I cannot satisfy all his emotional desires. My dislike of children is another barrier between us. He wanted a committed relationship from me. I wasn’t sure that it would be a good idea. The children were a deal breaker, it turned out. I always made it clear that he was free to pursue amorous companionship elsewhere and sever our relationship if he found someone more compatible.”
“But why couldn’t he cave sooner?” Sherlock grumbled, going on the alert when Mrs. Hudson opened up for him downstairs.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, too.” She smiled courteously. “Sherlock has told me a lot about you, although I’m not sure which parts are true or not.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson murmured, distraught, raising a hand to her face.
… was a doctor. Five years for medical school. Two years for foundational training. He mentioned a surgery so he must be a GP, so three more years for that training. Two years living in this house given its lived in state.
Too much of a penchant for rules aside, working a case with John was exhilarating. Not only did they discover crucial evidence together, but they ran a daredevil chase across tiny side streets and rooftops. Sure, their suspect had been a bad guess, but God, had it been worth it to see that delighted grin on John’s face. Both out of breath, laughing as they shared a joke, adrenaline pumping in their veins as they fled from a cop that happened by. They walked the rest of their way to Baker Street, too wired to take a cab or the Tube.
John’s cheeky smile belied his apology.
He waited for John to fetch his crutches from the back seat and hand them to him, accepting his help in getting out. A chilly wind beat his hair against his face, strong enough for his coat, yet John was still dressed in a single jumper. Granted, people had different tolerances to temperatures, but there might be more to it here.
“You want to see me transform.”
“Because when I leave you be, you tend to make impulsive, dangerous decisions far more stupid than anything I could ever do. John Watson didn’t exist before twelve years ago, and according to every source available to me, this man didn’t exist before then, either. There is no record of him. Why would that be?”
“What did he say?” John asked. “Is he going to let this go?”
John was undressed when he turned around. He stood no less awkwardly than Sherlock did, despite not being fully nude, like he was used to being around Sherlock when he transformed.
“I’m tired of you hating me. And you’re much happier now. You have John. You have a friend with Greg. A true friend now that you have stopped keeping him at arm’s length. I do want to trust you, Sherlock. So I will.”
“Are you calling to apologize again?” Sherlock answered in lieu of “hello”.
“Well, uh, he said congratulations. That he was happy for us. I don’t really know how to read his voice, but I think that he sounded sincere. He did mention that your last close friendship didn’t end well.”
“I’m not sure. Three hours, at least.”
John rushed to the sofa. He sat with quiet expectation, hands rubbing softly on his lap as he leaned a little forward, the most attentive and intrigued audience that Sherlock could wish for. Raising his bow, Sherlock closed his eyes and began. He had made sure to memorize the tune to perfection, both to not have to bother looking at his sheets and for the visual aesthetics of the performance. If he weren’t injured, he’d be standing and making full use of his limbs to dance with the music as it rose and ebbed like the waves that had inspired it. As it was, he could only manage a gentle sway without tripping up his notes. He hoped that it conveyed the proper effect, nevertheless. He had never felt this insecure about a composition before, this uncertain that he had the right to even attempt to capture the experience of John’s world when he could only be allowed to glimpse a tiny piece of it in cinematic footage and the tales that John wove at his request. He wouldn’t dare to speak to John’s experience, only try to share his own curiosity and delight at the honor that John had bestowed on him. The glances he snuck at John gave him hope that his message was being received, for John looked as enchanted as that first day when Sherlock had played for him, awed and taken in by the artistry that Sherlock so seldom had the chance or wished to share with another. John’s happy smile sparked warm elation in Sherlock’s skin even more vibrant than the allure of the sounds washing through his body. If only he’d made the song longer so that he could delight in this for more than this brief moment.
Sherlock gaped at John’s shocking reply to his query about sea turtles for half a second before calling Mycroft, fury boiling inside him. Mycroft answered at the first ring, no doubt anticipating the call.
“Did you have a nice swim?” Sherlock asked.
“No, you don’t.”
“I’m not giving you my blood, either,” Greg said.
“I know it’s not. I understand. It is going to take time. But you’ve got to try, you know? That’s all any of us can do.”
“Let’s play checkers.”
“Mummy is hardly giving you much these days, anyway.”
“May I?” he asked.
A wry smile jerked on Mycroft’s face.
John unlocked the front door and held it open for Sherlock, who swept his gaze over every detail of the house as he made his halting way to the sofa. He plopped down, placing his crutches against the armrest, and raised his legs, maneuvering himself into the same seating position as yesterday. John hurried to bring him a couple of cushions to place behind his back and under his right knee.
Sherlock’s smile widened.
“Well. You can see me now. How am I doing?”
“Yeah. I think so. Thanks.”
“You’re the seal that saved Sherlock on the beach,” Lestrade said. “I thought it might be one of us. An ordinary seal wouldn’t do that, would it?”
“Right.” John scrunched his brow for a second. “Sorry. I don’t mean to criticize. It’s your home. You can arrange it however you want, of course.” He paused upon seeing the skull.
“I didn’t mean to make you think that,” John said, so apologetic that Sherlock trembled as fear drained out of his body. “Of course I’m not leaving. I’m upset, but I’m not going to abandon you so easily. I told you. I’m not doing that again. I love you, Sherlock. How could I just leave you like that?”
Sherlock’s smile widened. Giddiness surged through him at the easy acceptance with which Greg said the word.
“I do wish to do so, yes. May I visit you tomorrow, or will you kick me out?”
“I should never have told him that. But he’s never going to get it. He’ll never consider the impossible.”
“Thank you,” he ground out.
“It’s not,” he said. “We’ve shared more in this week than I have with some former friends in the span of years, actually. I just don’t want you to feel obligated.”
“No stalking me on CCTV?”
Sherlock ignored him. Mycroft was silent for an unusually long amount of time. Had Sherlock actually rendered him speechless?
Though not with Susan, it would seem. Two months ago, not even two and a half years into their marriage, Greg called him in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, distressed, his breath short with barely suppressed hurt.
Sherlock gaped at him, breath held in his throat. He scrutinized John’s face. The weary line of his mouth. The worried shoulders. The pleading gleaming in his eyes.
John stared at him, surprised. Sherlock mentally shrank back. He’d miscalculated. John hadn’t brought up the matter himself because he didn’t want to.
“I don’t want him to think the wrong thing about me and John.”
“Sherlock?” came John’s uncertain voice. “Is that really you?”
Mycroft pursed his lips in thought.
Thsi is the longest chapter. It's also the first of eight in Mycroft's POV. They mostly deal with his relationship with Greg, but there's pieces of his relationship with Sherlock, too.
“Oh, shut up. Why the hell did our parents put it second if that’s what they were going to call me? Besides, William and Scott are so generic. That’s not the point. The point is Greg is coming over so I won’t be alone. So stop fussing.”
While Sherlock spoke, they had arrived at the house. John turned off the car and sat quietly, absorbing what Sherlock said with frowning brows and tense shoulders.
She pet his arm.
John tried to protest but got nowhere. The bench was installed by the next weekend, given them ample opportunity to lounge on it, gazing at the ocean, John’s head resting on Sherlock’s shoulder. It was a much more cheerful experience than the last, but a somber tinge settled in John’s eyes when he thought that Sherlock wasn’t looking. He was restless in the evenings, sneaking off to the Thames when he could, avoiding entertainment that had to do with birth families. Once, his good mood evaporated during an advert featuring a birthday party with happy parents gifting their smiling child a puppy. He was morose and mentally distant for the rest of the day. Sherlock had snuggled him, made him tea, even made dinner. John smiled and thanked him, but it didn’t help cheer him up in the slightest.
“Listen to Mrs. Hudson,” Mycroft said. “I see absolutely no reason to worry about John’s faithfulness, and who is more paranoid than me?”
Sherlock did so. John had stopped moving at Mycroft’s reaction. He turned to Sherlock with an inquisitive bob of his nose, as if asking if it was safe to move now. Sherlock nodded. John inched along the floor, carefully watching Mycroft, but Mycroft didn’t try to run again. He gaped at John, breath heaving in his chest, but not hyperventilating like Sherlock had been. John stopped at Sherlock’s right away from Mycroft, looking between the two of them. Sherlock touched his back, petting him softly without even thinking about it. John leaned into him, propping his front flippers up on the sofa, his right half on Sherlock’s lap. He grunted softly in greeting.
Mrs. Hudson continued to call or send pictures of cute animals every day. Her enquiries had expanded to include John. How was John? Was he having fun with John? Would John be visiting him in London? God, Sherlock should have never said a word about him. Mrs. Hudson was acting like a stereotypical mum when her child brought their first boyfriend home, which was a horribly erroneous comparison given the deficiencies of Sherlock’s actual mother. Mycroft was little better. There was no repeat of his sleepover joke, but he persisted in asking John questions about anything he could think of, including if a particular politician was some sort of magical being, because he was as slippery and impossible to manage as one. John didn’t know and Sherlock didn’t care, so he picked up his violin and played one of Beethoven’s sonatas, which delighted John so much that he put his phone on silent to not spoil the music with its beeping.
Mycroft went to get his coat from the rack beside the front door.
Sherlock lowered the file with a huff, fixing Lestrade with a sharp glare.
Mycroft shot him a “shut up” look, embarrassment creeping into his eyes.
Greg narrowed his eyes.
Sherlock flinched at the squealing of the kettle. The cut in his torso jerked, protesting the movement with a sharp sting. He sat back, eyes closing, and breathed slowly through his nose, trying to calm the heightened beating of his heart.
Greg snorted out a laugh that sounded a bit too close to hysteria for comfort.
“I composed this one some years ago,” Sherlock said, flattening his tone a bit else he betray himself. “I consider it my best piece, so you’ll have to adjust your expectations for the rest accordingly.”
“Invigorating? You’re not walking your ankle too much yet, are you?”
“Things are going really well between you, huh?”
Sherlock returned to the video app.
“It was long and agonizing waiting for you.”
Mycroft found them a few minutes later, still hugging. Sherlock straightened, wiping furiously at the tears on his cheek with his hands. Mycroft froze by the door, staring at him in shock. At any other time, his gaping eyes and mouth would have been hilarious, but not while Sherlock had snot coming out of his nose.
Sherlock scrutinized Mycroft’s face, looking for tells. But there weren’t any. No signs of deception that he could perceive. This couldn’t be right. Mycroft wouldn’t just roll over so easily.
“I’m sure. As much of a pain as he is do deal with, he actually likes having me alive.”
“You do? How magnanimous of you.”
“I’ll say. I never pictured myself doing that with you. I haven’t with any human, now that I think about it.”
“I don’t want to influence you unfairly.”
Greg was almost as excited as Mrs. Hudson to meet John. After all the fuss that Sherlock had made about coming out to him and declaring John to be his partner, and how supportive Greg had been, Sherlock couldn’t well tell him to bugger off and wait a couple of more weeks. He didn’t want to, actually. The visit probably wouldn’t even take that long. An hour, maybe, then he’d have John to himself again. Although, if he was quite honest with himself, which he often tried not to be, he was a bit excited about John meeting his friend. His proper friend. That’s what Greg was. Not just a police liaison who popped by on occasion and was nice to him out of need and pity. Greg was his friend. What a thrilling thing that was to think about.
“Oh, you’re not out of the dog house yet. Not by a long shot. But I’m not angry. Still.” John’s face grew stern. “You have some making up to do.”
Fondness warmed his voice. Greg heard it and smiled back. Mycroft focused on him, recording this moment in his mind palace for posterity. If Greg decided not to renew their former connection, this would be the last moment that he would be able to enjoy the sight of a cheeky, open Greg with his lips bright red from Mycroft’s kisses. Greg stood up, hands flexing helplessly at his side.
The breeze swept his hair into his eyes. Sherlock was distracted by the fluttering of the shiny strands for a moment before returning to the unpleasant subject at hand.
“Yeah, he’s been fine. A bit freaked out at first, but he got over it.”
“I apologize,” he said, voice the audible equivalent of sandpaper.
“You’re well-dressed. Very sure of yourselves. Arrogant, to be frank. You look a bit alike. You scanned me the moment you saw me just like Sherlock does. I could practically see you deducing me in your head. And you’re really concerned about him. That offer to spy on him was a test, wasn’t it?”
“I don’t think it would as effective if you’re there. He’d be too embarrassed.”
He seemed on the verge of either raising his fists in the air and jumping up and down or collapsing in a startled heap on the floor. Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft got up and stood together in the middle of the sitting room.
“Only when I’m undercover. All other clothes have always felt like costumes on me.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“Sure thing. Bye, then.”
```````````````````````
John brushed past them, grabbed his jacket and went out, steps quick on the stairs. Sherlock did flinch as John shut the front door.
“Way more than you give yourself credit for. Which video was it?”
“Oh, Sherlock, I don’t put up with you. I love having you here with me. Now, I won’t lie and say it can’t be a bit—”
A smile jerked on Greg’s face.
“There’s no need to thank me, but you are very welcome. I’d hoped you’d like it.”
“Only by a few minutes,” Greg said, coming up the stairs. “And you’re late all the time.”
“No. I’m not.” Greg winced a bit. “Okay, I do feel guilty, but I wouldn’t do this for just anyone. We’re friends. I’m showing you that you’re my friend and that I trust you. And you can trust me, even though it probably doesn’t feel like you can right now.”
“No, but it’s nice all the same.”
“Mycroft, I’m asking you to tell me. It’s okay. Don’t worry about upsetting me or pressuring me or anything. I want to know what you want. Please.”
“It’s been the same for me. Mrs. Hudson has been doing everything she can think of to keep me from combusting. But I didn’t want to pressure you to move away from the sea. You’re sure you won’t miss seeing it every day?”
Mycroft huffed out a laugh despite himself.
John called him the next evening while Mycroft ate his dinner, his usual Indian takeaway. It had become a habit of theirs to communicate regularly since John revealed his secret to him. Mycroft hasn’t been able to contain his curiosity, although he had backed off when he sensed that he was taking advantage of John’s good nature and irritating him by pressing too hard. John assured him that he was already used to the endless barrage of questions from Sherlock, but unlike his brother, Mycroft did have a sense of when he was imposing. Their conversations had tapered off in the last couple of weeks. John had told him all that he was willing to, and John had unburdened himself of his initial reactions to 221B Baker Street. As expected, he had been charmed by Mrs. Hudson and her homey abode, and horrified by the contents of Sherlock’s kitchen.
“By all means, doctor.”
Sherlock bristled.
Mycroft put his arm back down. He rubbed Greg’s shoulder with his thumb, the motion instinctual.
“I don’t need to sit down. I’m alright. I just…”
Greg raised his brow in a “is this a serious question” expression.
“I knew you had me chipped,” Sherlock said.
In desperation, Sherlock suggested something that he’d never thought himself capable of enduring.
“You’re not going to call an ambulance , are you?”
“That’s better. Yes, I’ll join you. I’ll bring a book to occupy myself during these boring stretches you warn me of.”
John grimaced.
Mrs. Hudson frowned in surprise.
“Don’t.” Sherlock nearly flinched at the anger directed at him when John met his eyes. “Don’t be clever right now. It’s too damn late for that.”
Did the experiments smell? Sherlock supposed they did. He was so accustomed to their scent that he hardly noticed anymore. Would John mind? This was the sort of thing people minded, wasn’t it?
Mycroft turned to the side, walked over to the sofa, and sat down. His legs shook, unable to hold him up anymore. He gripped his knees, barely breathing, gazing down at his rug without seeing more than a haze of colors. This couldn’t be true. How could he not have noticed? Yet Greg’s demeanor connoted absolute sincerity.
Why on Earth was he mentioning his own sweat at a time like this?
“I needed that,” Greg said, looking no less tired than Mycroft himself. “You did, too.”
“I got distracted,” Sherlock said, sitting up. “That smell, is it too annoying?”
“I did. They’re still on the desk.”
“For how long?” he asked softly.
“Of course. I didn’t mean to imply otherwise.”
“Thanks. I think yours is nicer, though. Mine’s greying fast. I’ve only seen one grey hair in yours.”
Greg returned to the sofa and lied down, head on Mycroft’s lap, making that howling sound again. When was the last time that his head had been in Mycroft’s lap? Seven months into their relationship, perhaps, when Greg had stretched himself along the sofa as they watched a film, claiming that Mycroft made a good pillow. Mycroft had stroked his hair much as he was doing now, and mused that perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad to do this for the rest of his life. The experience was distinctly different now, and not only because Greg was shaped like a wolf and not a man. Or because his hair was of a different texture and he couldn’t speak in words. Four years had gone by since the last time that they cuddled or kissed, since Mycroft had held him and made his body sing. Mycroft had endured unexpected heartbreak twice over since then, when Greg had found Susan and when he left her. He had shared Greg’s former joy with wistful regret and mourned his pain with treacherous hope.
It occurred right after he emerged from said shower, a towel clad around his waist while he dried his hair with another, squeezing out the water as best he could without tangling the curls. John walked into the room and stared, mouth falling open as he looked down Sherlock’s body, quickly, as if on instinct. His eyes sparkled in a way that made Sherlock gasp and recoil. Sherlock had always welcomed John’s admiration and appreciation of his looks, but it had always been chaste, precious and exhilarating. But there was no mistaking the naked and yearning lust in John’s eyes, especially as he focused below Sherlock’s waist. Only for half a second, but it was enough.
“They are. It’s more of a cultural thing. We’re born to the ocean, so we’re naturally more drawn to it. Or most of us are. I miss it when I’m away from it for too long, a lot, but I’m more drawn to the land. Always have been.” A rueful smile jerked on his face. “Makes me a bit of a weirdo.”
“Nothing.” Sherlock dropped his arms back to his sides, fingers going mad clasping and unclasping. “Just come by, will you? Look, I really do want to catch up on things. Specific things. But… things.”
As Greg closed the door behind him, Sherlock sank back on the sofa, limbs spread out akimbo, more tired than he had been in ages. John sat beside him.
“No. It’s Lestrade, the DI who referred me to the case I was working here. He’s texting me about a new case.”
John raised a brow.
“That’s long enough. I’d like to take a look. See how you’re progressing.”
Sherlock made a show of putting away his phone, smirking even harder at Greg’s annoyed eye roll.
“Mycroft wouldn’t do that, anyway. He knows that I’m a selkie, too.”
“So?” he asked. “Where do you want to start?”
Should Mycroft tell him? Probably. But Sherlock wouldn’t be pleased about the subterfuge, and was there even a point in telling him when Greg was no longer sharing his bed?
“Oh, stop it,” Sherlock said. “Fine, so I wasn’t jumping for joy at having my world view upended, but I came around soon enough, didn’t I? Don’t tell me you were so calm when you first found out, Mrs. Hudson.”
“Sure.”
Sherlock hung up far more abruptly than he’d meant to, but his breath had been clenching in his throat  and he was about to go croaky any moment. He was really doing this. Entertaining the madness that was acknowledging magical creatures. There was no escaping it now, for he would keep that appointment, even if it drove him fully round the bend.
“Really? How refreshing.”
And the last time that he had annoyed John, the man had transformed into a seal and given him a panic attack. John pursed his lips, sucking in a breath through his nose, and tapped the steering wheel.
“But think of the hygiene. They’re right next to a takeaway box.”
John’s heavy sigh gusted against his nape. He rubbed the back of Sherlock’s head with apologetic fingers.
“Such a person will never exist,” he said. “Fine. I’ll try to keep my pacing to a minimum.” He pointed at Mycroft. “As long as you stop being stupid.”
Sherlock sucked on his bottom lip, nodding. Nice didn’t even begin to cover it. Fascinating. Elating. Dizzying. But in a good way. Definitely in a good way. John kept gazing into his eyes, silent, his eyes so bright and blue and perfect. Sherlock could while away an afternoon making a study of his irises, weaving the cerulean and brown hues into a merry tune. The laugh lines at the corners of John’s eyes wrinkled with a gentle smile. Sherlock’s breath caught. He’d never held anyone’s gaze for this long before. He had wondered at the idea of something being so beautiful and alluring that it hurt to remain entrapped in it for long. He had found this seeming contradiction tested after playing his violin for too many pieces, delight becoming ecstasy becoming pain as exhaustion set in. The nervous, overwhelmed sensation afflicting his gut just now was alike, yet not at all. How could it both gladden him and hurt to look at John? It was too much. Too much of himself in his eyes, his face, his thundering heart which made John frown, concerned.
“It does have certain advantages, I suppose.”
“Can’t go wrong with dating a doctor.”
“Go where?” Greg asked.
“Both.”
“Monday. That gives us the weekend. Then I’ll leave in the morning so you can drive me to the station.”
“Please don’t fret over it. I understand completely. I’m alright, I promise you.”
“Take that back right now.”
But Sherlock bit his tongue. John wasn’t apologizing. It had taken Sherlock so long to understand that people used this phrase to mean “I’m sad to hear that”, even though they weren’t actually sad half of the time that they used it. But John did look sad. It wasn’t pity or a fake show of sympathy. The sorrow shadowing John’s face wasn’t only for Sherlock losing his friend, but for himself, for the past that he held back from Sherlock as if it might burn him to show it too close to the surface. What had happened to him? Why wasn’t he with his kind anymore?
It was all up to Greg. He might decide to keep their friendship as is, after all. Or, perish the thought, ask to be excused permanently. Mycroft clamped down on the urge to reach for a biscuit or a cigarette at the possibility. But, if Greg did decide to renew their more intimate connection, Mycroft wouldn’t hesitate to accept. Not for the world.
“Try? I barely see her as it is. Either of them. You must hear the complaints about it.”
Sherlock nodded.
“I don’t know. I’m afraid I’m out of my depth in this area so I don’t know what to advice you.”
“Yes.” Sherlock pulled out a battered, dusty box and put it on his desk. “You do remember how to play, don’t you?”
Greg’s eyes softened.
“You’re already around most of the time, so it wouldn’t be much difference. You can take my bed. You’re too tall for the sofa.”
No! He was going to quit. He was absolutely determined to quit. He couldn’t cave in now just because his mind was turning into soup inside his skull because of some puppy faced doctor who could do a neat trick of turning into a seal. Scrambling inside the desk drawer, he pulled out two nicotine patches and slapped them on his forearm.
Sherlock frowned, then smiled. It was a simple enough deduction.
Greg grabbed blindly for him, hand landing on Mycroft’s chest before gripping his arm.
“Glad to hear that. Now get yourself off that ankle while I finish dinner.”
Sherlock breath hitched on a sob. He couldn’t help it. But he couldn’t let the rest of the tears get out, not with Mycroft on the way. He wouldn’t have his brother find him a sobbing mess. John might also come back. Any moment now, he could walk in through the door.
John smiled with a mischievous, excited gleam.
“You are alright staying on your own for longer, aren’t you?” he asked.
The words were out of Sherlock’s mouth before he even realized that he had formulated them. Mycroft looked back, surprised, and tilted his head with a gratified expression. John was looking at them, but Sherlock only saw him from the corner of his eye, his focus on Mycroft until John’s voice rang out.
“A fellow werewolf would be more compatible for you,” he said, hanging on to composure by a thread.
“Um, thank you. No one’s ever called me magnificent before.”
John crouched down beside him, reaching under Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock shrank back, balking at the indignity of being carried like a helpless damsel.
“It was lovely to meet you, Mrs. Hudson,” he said. “I look forward to seeing you in London, where I won’t have any work commitments whatsoever.”
Thanks to a lucky chance of good weather, the weekends were dedicated to the outdoors. Once again, Sherlock read in a chair at the shore while John went for a swim, entertaining him with more of his acrobatics before going off on his own. Except this time when he returned, Sherlock didn’t continue sitting when John stretched out by his side. He lied down with him, ignoring the wet sand sticking to his clothes as he pressed himself to John and wrapped an arm around him. John grunted with surprised delight and shifted until they were face to face to give Sherlock wet, fuzzy nuzzles. Sherlock laughed. John’s whiskers tickled. Soon John settled, closing his eyes, long snout pressed to Sherlock’s forehead. They must have been quite the sight cuddled on the sand, a human wrapped around a seal, both in comfortable repose.
“I know the feeling.”
John flashed him a cheeky grin. Sherlock groaned internally as heat crept up the back of his neck.
Greg left the room. Mycroft followed him with his gaze the whole way, imagining what he might look like in wolf form. It was probable that his coloring would be similar. A salt and pepper mix wouldn’t look amiss on a wolf. There hadn’t been any signs, had there? Not before now. Greg had been so careful to keep his secret under wraps, not that Mycroft would have ever suspected the possibility. His skepticism had been Greg’s shield against discovery. God, why had Mycroft frozen up like that when Greg revealed the truth to him? That fright in his face, the doubt that Mycroft might actually reject him, or worse, have him whisked away to be experimented on just like John had feared… How could Mycroft have let him suspect that Mycroft could treat him so poorly for even a second? Shock or no, he had erred and must make up for it. Yet the surprise still hadn’t left his system. His best friend, his only friend, the man who had shared his bed, who he held and comforted, who he loved, wasn’t human. Sherlock had known from the beginning that John wasn’t human, so he’d only had to adjust to the reality of shapeshifters, not to John himself being different. For Mycroft it was the opposite. Mycroft owed John even more than he’d known, for if he hadn’t already shocked Mycroft into incoherence with his own transformation, Greg might have never told him. And even if he had, he would have reacted poorly and scared Greg even more than he had today.
“God, I hope so. I think he’s afraid I’m not going to give him another case, which of course I will, because I’ll have to. And I like working with him because I’m a masochist. And you want me to.”
That hope flowered now. Was this the start of a redressing of grievances, of Greg returning to him more fully than either of them had dared to try since? Could he at least have Greg’s physical affection in this form even if he couldn’t in the other? It fell far short of what Mycroft wanted, but a peace he hadn’t experienced in far too long soothed his mind as he pet Greg. Greg’s eyes were closed, tail wagging lazily, muscles relaxed in gentle, trusting repose.
“What’s it going to take for you to release John?” Sherlock asked.
John giggled softly, looking away for a moment as pink colored his cheeks. The tender sight urged Sherlock to lean forward and lay a kiss on John’s nose. John laughed harder, even more delighted.
Greg looked away shyly.
Sherlock’s choice to leave it alone and not ask if John was okay had been the correct one, after all. He sighed silently in relief.
“Fine,” Mycroft bit out, patience as thin as a sheet of tissue paper. “I’ll drive us there.”
“Alright then,” he said after a moment, his voice tight with begrudging defeat. “I’m not the most knowledgeable person in this room. But I’m still more intellectually gifted than you.”
“We should have, yes,” Mycroft said. “But Greg had married, so it seemed easier to maintain the lie. May I ask what prompted Greg to tell you now?”
“It’s not my secret to tell. Why can’t you just trust me when I tell you that there is nothing dangerous about him?”
“So you would be amenable to continuing to work with him on cases?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock gloated in Mycroft’s face every moment that Mrs. Hudson showered him with loving attention. Mycroft really should stop frowning so much. He was going to get even more wrinkles than he already had.
“Werewolves are also stricter about fairness,” Mrs. Hudson said. “I’ve had to listen to quite a few rants about human nepotism and discrimination.”
He held out his hand. Sherlock narrowed his eyes at it, the hand of a mythological being that had no right to exist and yet had manifested itself in front of him as solidly as the floorboards pressing under Sherlock’s body. If Sherlock touched him, it would continue proving that John was real and not just some deranged figment of his imagination. Sherlock met his eyes, those begging, regretful eyes, so human looking, every inch of him such a perfect replica of a human. Sherlock reached out, gasping as he touched John’s solid flesh. John smiled gratefully and crouched down beside Sherlock to pull him up, careful not to jostle Sherlock’s injured ankle too much.
John scuttled forward. Mycroft jumped up, seeking to flee. Sherlock grabbed his right wrist, halting him in his tracks.
“Nor would I,” Sherlock said. “Yet here we are.”
“That was amazing,” John said, filled with admiration. “Wow. I knew it was going to be great. All of your compositions I‘ve heard so far have been, but that was even better than I expected. Wow. Thank you.”
“Get up here,” Mycroft said. “I don’t care if you get hair on everything. You’re as welcome on my furniture in this form as in your other one. I’m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.”
“As I recall,” he told John, “I owe you. So don’t even think about paying me back.”
“Thank you. I know that’s hard for you. I mean, it’s the right thing to do. Spying on your brother is not okay, but I understand why you did it.”
“My recollection is perfectly accurate,” he said. “I did better than you on the driving test.”
“I really am sorry for scaring you earlier.” Mycroft almost dropped a kiss on Greg’s head like he had done so long ago. “Thank you for sharing this with me.”
“Let’s forget about what to call it. We’re together. That’s all we need to say.”
That had been one time. Sherlock had infiltrated an art gallery to catch a thief and was so used to popping the collar of his Belstaff that he had done the same to his uniform jacket without even thinking about it. It wasn’t like he’d looked out of place and made people remotely suspicious. Greg was making too much out of the situation.
Mycroft’s smile broadened.
“How about eight?”
“No, that wouldn’t have been possible. The burglar was killed by an animal, wasn’t he?”
“She did? Well. If she said that… Although, you really shouldn’t delay too long, but… If that’s what she wants.”
Sherlock clamped his mouth shut. He shot up from the sofa and paced around the room, but his ankle jerked in pain, forcing him to flop back down on the cushions, biting his bottom lip against a scream.
A troubled frown wrinkled John’s brow.
He rolled his shoulders and sank back against the cushions, shutting his eyes with a weary grimace.
“Great. That’s a load off. I always hated living alone, but it’s even more unbearable now without you there.”
Eighteen agonizing minutes later, the front door finally opened. Sherlock jumped off the armchair and ran to the stairs, hands shaking as he gripped the handrail. John looked up at him, tired, mouth in a tense line, shoulders hunched.
Sherlock put his bow on his lap and grabbed John’s left arm before he could move any further away.
A soft tapping rapped on the door.
“You know she gets upset if you tarry too long.”
John glanced at the nicotine patch on Sherlock’s left forearm.
Something silly and loud was on the telly, one of the movies that John kept trying to get him into. Sherlock watched the antics of the improbably armored Iron Man, followed by another movie with even more ridiculously attired superheroes. They proved to be more entertaining than he anticipated. Certainly better than trash telly. Tony Stark’s depressed air and single minded focus to escape the demons in his own mind with a special project that no one else understood the importance of was certainly relatable. That was unexpected.
But it did have to eventually, alas. Mrs. Hudson had left shortly after Greg’s arrival for her weekly gaming meetup, but she would be back by three, and it would be best to avoid shocking her by having a seal and a wolf in the flat. So after too short of a time playing on the floor, both shapeshifters went away to change back, leaving Sherlock sighing wistfully on the floor even as a buzz of enjoyment lingered in his body. He hopped onto his feet, stretching his legs around the room, then lied down on the sofa, curling into a pleasant ball. He was ready for a nap.
“Yes.”
“Just that you have questionable taste in television and you brush your teeth very loudly.”
“No, don’t. It’s nothing. I was just thinking about my return to London. Which will have to be soon.”
“Now I’m sure you’re making that up.”
Mycroft was probably mentally combing through every object that could possibly fit the bill, all of which would be wrong.
Mycroft tilted his head toward Sherlock, but he couldn’t force himself to look away from John, so he nodded, a sharp, halting motion. Sherlock released his wrist. The umbrella pressed against the floor with a sharp thud, Mycroft’s knuckles white on the handle. Sherlock wrapped his fingers around it instead. Mycroft wouldn’t be using the weapons inside it, but Sherlock felt better having a hold on it. He would have taken it away completely, but Mycroft needed his comfort object right now.
“Did she?”
John lowered his chin.
“I don’t know yet.”
John nodded.
“No, we don’t.”
“Alright,” Greg said, climbing up the stairs, head lowered in embarrassment, fully deserved. “I’m giving you the case. You win. Just come, please?”
Due to the large size of the house, Mycroft had several spare bedrooms, none of which had ever been used. He chose one close to his own bedroom, yet at a suitable distance should Greg desire the extra privacy. He had brushed off Greg’s offer to help him make up the bed, needing a few moments alone and the mentally clearing benefits of a menial task. His emotions had been a twisted knot since Greg’s call, hours of cold percolation and doubt. A divorce would devastate Greg. Mycroft had lived in a state of quiet jealousy over Susan, yet he could not wish such misery upon Greg. But what choice had he now? Was Greg likely to give her another chance? She didn’t deserve one. There were others whom Greg could grow to love, and with whom Greg could have the children he wanted so keenly. There was no need for him to subject himself to living in doubt with Susan’s infidelity. Ether way, he wouldn’t return to Mycroft, not like that. This was the closest their friendship would ever get.
“Not fear, no,” John said emphatically. “It’s just unpleasant.”
“Yeah,” Lestrade said. “Mrs. Hudson said that you became friends with the doctor who helped you after the attack.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing?”
“Are you? You’re not just putting on a brave front like you do? You can tell me to fuck off if you want. I’d deserve it.”
“You’re very welcome.”
Sherlock cringed at the sharpness of John’s tone.
“I’m just going to grab a glass of water,” he said, turning toward the kitchen. “Then we can go.”
“Sherlock told you which kind to bring, didn’t he?”
“I’m glad I live up to your exacting standards,” he drawled, glancing at the open buttons below Sherlock’s throat. “Do you even own a tie?”
“You wouldn’t.”
John snorted softly.
Joy sparkled even more when Sherlock finally played his finished composition for him. Sherlock worked on it the whole day while John was at work, refining every note until it was the best that he could make it. The instant that John walked through the door, Sherlock told him to sit on the sofa. He had already set up his stool in the middle of the room and had his violin ready. John’s protestations of hunger vanished the second that he saw the instrument.
Before Sherlock got restless with his presence and kicked him out. But Sherlock jumped up and dove for the cupboard, saying,
“I knew that Greg has weird tastes, so not really, no.”
“Okay. What?”
Mycroft stood up and walked to him, noticing the wolf hairs that Greg hadn’t bothered to be so thorough about cleaning this time.
“No,” Mycroft said. “I wanted to speak to the two of you first.”
Did he now? Clearly not.
“I do actually want to see some of London while I’m here, you know. And we have to eat eventually.”
Sherlock nodded.
“Come on,” John said, leaning back, but leaving his hands exactly where they were. “Let’s not just stay standing here. What do you want to do? Read? Watch telly? Work on one of your experiments?”
“You can’t possibly object to the costumes. They’re for undercover work.”
“Nor can you play a record in the sea,” Sherlock said, opting to switch to a form of musical appreciation that John could engage in.
“I just didn’t want to talk about it, okay? And I didn’t lie. Revealing that I’m a werewolf did go great. I just didn’t mention the other stuff.”
John pressed his forehead against his, closing his eyes. A relieved breath shuddered out of Sherlock’s chest and he relaxed into John’s hold, smiling.
“I’ve met a couple of selkies on land, but we aren’t in contact. And none of them have been here as long as me. Choosing to base my life here and not in the sea is viewed as a rejection of who were are as a people. Saltwater is our life’s blood. Turning your back on it is like spitting in the face of your ancestors. Never mind that I haven’t turned my back on anything. I live by the ocean. I go for a swim every chance I get. No, I’m not joining the migrations and being an active member of society, but I’m no less a selkie because of it. I haven’t forgotten who I am. I’m just not what they want me to be. I can’t just reprogram myself to be happy according to their whims just because they are time honored traditions.”
“I’m fine. I’m not that hungry.”
“Funny how you project your own deficiencies onto other people.”
Greg informed him of his engagement by phone a couple of weeks later, likely to spare him having to school his expression in public Mycroft appreciated this. It was much easier to only have to dissemble his voice to wish him heartfelt congratulations. He was happy for Greg, truly. His desire for Greg’s happiness was only superseded by Sherlock’s own. Yet the sting of Greg finding that happiness with someone else, while dulled by time, stung still. Another solitary night of wine and recorded symphonies ensued, although this time Mycroft managed to curb his desire to drink after he’d gotten tipsy. He decided to abstain from drink for the foreseeable future just in case. Sherlock wasn’t the only one in the family with a propensity towards addiction, and this was one road that Mycroft didn’t wish to go down. He also threw away his cigarettes, although he caved and purchased new ones during a particularly bad day.
Mycroft arrived on time, knocking on the front door as if he wasn’t able to waltz in whenever he pleased. Sherlock answered the door, eyes narrowed as he took in Mycroft’s impeccable appearance. He had changed suits after work, and carried a bottle of the wine that Sherlock had threatened him to bring.
“This is nice,” he said, smiling at the pride flags on the desk. “Very nice. It’s bigger than I was expecting.”
They started walking to the exit.
Before Sherlock could put any weight on his left foot, John scooped him up and pushed himself to his feet. Sherlock yelped, instinctively grabbing at his shoulders.
“How could you possibly have known?” Sherlock asked. “Wait. Are we sure that we’re both talking about the same thing?”
Sherlock had asked him straight out that first morning if he considered Mycroft a friend, warning him that Mycroft barely understood what the concept meant.
Sherlock frowned, resisting the urge to shift his feet in apprehension.
That was a graceful enough refusal, wasn’t it?
“Neither do I. You really don’t mind, then?”
“Not at all. But, to be clear, this is getting more involved than it would with a friend.”
“They look like…” John’s brow winkled in thought. “A flowery meadow.”
“Yes, so John explained,” Sherlock said, rubbing his fingers together in his lap. “I…” He looked down at the ground, the intensity of looking Greg in the eyes suddenly overwhelming, keenly aware that they had never been so open about their relationship before. “I do feel closer to you, too. I wish that it hadn’t taken me so long to realize what a good friend you are. Thank you.”
“For now. Are you going to stop being such a wanker about things?”
Mycroft smiled back.
“Then it’s done. Now drink your water and lets go or we’re going to be late.”
“I’m afraid I can’t help you there. He has been doing that since he was fifteen. Mother threw a fit over the state of his desk but he refused to stop. There’s no winning with him if he doesn’t want to do something.”
Friends. Hardly the right word. Sherlock opened his mouth to correct him, but stopped. He had never told Lestrade anything about his orientation, and chances were high that Lestrade would require plenty of explanation. Did he really want to get into all that here in his office, in the midst of Lestrade’s workday, with any of his subordinates able to interrupt at any moment? But he couldn’t just play along that he and John were “friends” and nothing else.
“No hospital. I can deal with it myself. Just get me back to my hotel.”
Irritation flashed in John’s face.
“A seal turned into a man in front of me. What else was I supposed to think?”
“John is my name,” John spoke slowly, gratingly so, as if Sherlock were a small child who barely understood English and needed to be spoken down to. “Watson is not. I chose it to live in the human world. I don’t spend much time among my kind anymore, but I do return to the sea often. No, I don’t make a habit of saving random humans. I recognized you. I saw you playing the violin a couple of days ago.”
Of course the first thing Mycroft would want to know was whether there was a security threat he should be aware of.
“It seems that we don’t have as many barriers to overcome as I thought. Terminology aside, we pretty much want the same thing, don’t we?”
A flash of memory came to Sherlock of Victor sleeping on the sofa in their old flat. He had been too tired to shut off the telly and crawl into his own bed, so Sherlock had done it for him. Yet he had remained, spellbound, to watch him sleep. Victor’s hair had spilled across his forehead, just like John’s did now, clean and soft. Sherlock had been tempted to reach down and touch. Just for a second. Not long enough for Victor to notice, but he didn’t. He shouldn’t. Not without Victor being aware of it. Sherlock had no right to touch him like that in his slumber.
“Good.”
With one more glance at Sherlock, John wrapped the skin over his head and torso. The magical transformation was no less astounding now than it had been all those times before. As it encased him fully and John sank to the floor, Mycroft stiffened, clutching his umbrella. John’s body slimmed, and his face lengthened into the adorable snout that Sherlock had petted. Sherlock’s heart thundered in his chest, breath growing short through the wide smile on his face, but it faltered as his delight retreated under the sudden onslaught of dread at Mycroft’s reaction. He wouldn’t have John carted away and experimented on, not after giving his word, not when it meant betraying Sherlock’s trust in such a vicious manner. Yet the icy grip of nerves gnawing up his spine gripped him still as he studied the fearful shock on Mycroft’s face and how every muscle was tensed so hard that at any moment they were liable to snap. Sherlock must have looked much the same when John had revealed himself to him.
Sherlock paused. Would John mind that? He’d already had some specimens delivered so that he could get on with his experiments right away.
John peered at the fat, plastic bag beside Sherlock’s seat.
“I can’t argue with that.”
“You wouldn’t have let me get in the car.”
“Of course you are. I cleared it with Greg ages ago.”
Bowing to her superior wisdom in an area that she actually knew more than him about, Sherlock told his mind to shut up and enjoyed the moment.
Sherlock stepped back, clasping his towel to his chest, fleeing John’s gaze. John startled at the motion, eyes widening with awareness and guilt at his own actions.
“No,” John said.
Sherlock sighed.
“I’m not drinking milk that’s been sat next to decaying, human flesh,” John had said. “You’re sharing the flat now. Compromises must be made. It’s all part of being partners.”
Greg ate a sufficient amount that morning, if a bit less than his usual intake. Susan had called him an hour before, wishing to speak in person so that she could apologize properly. Mycroft wasn’t enthused by the prospect, but Greg chose to go. Of course. Greg wouldn’t terminate his marriage so easily, even under these circumstances. Mycroft couldn’t quite comprehend his motivations, but romantic relationships were outside of his area of expertise. As where the hurt feelings that ensued when one’s partner was unfaithful. He had always been glad to not have to worry about this sort of thing, but his lack of experience did have drawbacks when it came to managing certain situations, such as this one. Not that this was up to him to manage. He had no power or authority here. It was entirely Greg’s business. Mycroft’s role was exclusively to provide Greg with whatever he required, be it material or emotional. That was all.
“Alright,” he said, excited butterflies returning.
“I don’t.”
“He told you?”
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to snap. I don’t know what I’m saying anymore. I know what you’re trying to do. And that I feel like shit, so I’m self-harming by trying to feel even more like shit, but that was my fault. With us. And I haven’t been home as much as I promised when we got married. She didn’t have to fucking cheat on me, but… We’ve had our problems, but every couple has problems, right? We had problems. But we couldn’t work those out. What if I can’t work them out with Susan? Do I even want to after this? I don’t know. I don’t even fucking know. God.” Greg dropped his head in his hands again. “I love her. Even now. I can’t help it. I hate her but I love her. I don’t want a divorce, but what else am I supposed to do? I can’t stay with her, can I? She was sorry, but why do it in the first place? How am I supposed to trust her now?”
“A pretty transparent one. You should try better next time.”
He laughed with delight. It couldn’t come soon enough.
John picked up his mug and sat back like he’d just solved the trickiest case of the decade before Sherlock could, sipping his tea with an infuriating smirk of satisfaction. Sherlock glared at him.
“I was thinking it might be too early for you. But you’re the best judge of that.”
“By video chat, so I can take a good look at you.”
Sherlock shifted his foot a bit until he reached a position that didn’t hurt too much.
Sherlock smiled back.
“Stop. I’ll get him in. You don’t have to get Mycroft to twist my arm for bloody everything.”
“Leave the cigarettes alone,” Mycroft said. “What would John say?”
“Yes, we did.”
“A werewolf.” Sherlock grinned, murmuring the words in delight. “Fascinating.”
Mycroft shifted his head, finally collecting enough courage to look at Greg, who awaited his reaction with silent dread.
“Does that bother you? It shouldn’t.”
“But now you are, because you just feel like it.”
Sherlock sprawled out on the bed with a long-suffering sigh. John rolled his eyes but kept smiling. As soon as he climbed into bed, Sherlock snuggled up to his chest and began covering him in little kisses. So soft and warm and comfortable. How had he ever lived without this strong body wrapped around his? For John’s arms rose automatically to encircle him, rubbing down Sherlock’s back, delicious fingertips stroking away the tension coiled in his muscles. Sherlock rubbed John’s chest with his cheeks, grasping his waist, smiling as he lingered over John’s heart and heard it beat in his ear, one of the most precious heartbeats in the world. If only John could be here all the time so that he could always have a chance to listen to it.
“I’m glad to hear that your people are so reasonable about that. I wish mine were, though it’s too much to ask that they be reasonable about much of anything.”
“None taken. Not my system. My culture is a lot more reasonable about these things. Yours is the one that’s delusional. No offence.”
“So you are still attracted to me.”
“Okay. I’ll be right back.”
Greg didn’t look like he was certain whether that would be a good thing or not. Why wouldn’t it be a good thing? He was divorcing his wife, anyway. Perhaps he wasn’t attracted to Mycroft that way anymore after all these years, but if that were the case, he wouldn’t have reacted in a strong enough fashion for John to have picked up on.
“My point exactly. I am glad you have a friend. You fare better when you have one.”
Ah. A name.
“Can I stay over at your place tonight?” he asked.
“No paying people to spy on me?”
“God, don’t remind me.”
“No.”
“Okay,” Sherlock said. “Would you mind opening the door so he’ll know we’ve finished our tête-à-tête?”
“Thank you. After seven. I’ll be eating dinner with Mrs. Hudson then.”
“Lestrade might count, but I’m not going out to eat with him. I don’t know how you’d categorize Mrs. Hudson, my landlady. According to Mycroft, she’s a mother figure, which I can’t disagree with. I do feel that sort of affection towards her. Don’t tell Mycroft I agree with him. He’d be even more insufferable.”
“There’s a good restaurant a couple of streets from here,” John continued. “They serve you quickly. We’re going.”
“Of course not. What do you take me for? You may be the definition of annoying, but I’m stuck with you. I do…”
“We have this same row every time we share a table,” Mycroft said, his irritating chuckles finally abating, although he retained that diverted smirk that Sherlock couldn’t stand. “I’m afraid that it really is hopeless, Mrs. Hudson. Some things are doomed to remain the same no matter what.”
“I didn’t call you so you would be disappointed at me, too.”
“Not exactly. I’m happy, actually. But there is something bothering me, despite the fact that I’ve been ordered not to think about it.”
“It’s not much of a thing among selkies, actually. That’s a human habit that some of us have picked up, but I can take it or leave it.”
“You’re not an idiot,” John said.
“We communicate regularly and you just made him my brother-in-law. I have to tell him something.”
“Every time I play something social by ear people tell me I’m doing it wrong.”
“Is it too much to ask to hear it again?” John said, shy.
Sherlock knocked on Lestrade’s office door and waited, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
“Dragging this on for far longer than necessary, apart from causing yourself unnecessary stress.” He stopped by the open backseat door. “See how fast we got here without your dramatic posturing?”
“Sherlock’s right,” John said, straightening in his seat. “It’s not. I’m explaining this to you as a courtesy because you’re Sherlock’s brother, but you can’t demand any answers from me.”
Mycroft shifted in his chair, the barest motion against the backrest, but it counted.
“But after a while, I do start missing the ocean. Being immersed in the cold water, surrounded by the company of my fellows. Playing in the seaweed, exploring the wondrous underwater vistas that your documentarians only catch a tiny glimpse of. It’s the same the other way around. There are so many wonders on land that you can’t even imagine in the ocean. And your cities are incredible. Not even the merpeople have anything like it. And the land animals are fascinating. You know, I considered becoming a veterinarian for a bit, but I wanted to work with humans more. Now don’t laugh, but I spent a lot of my childhood obsessed with squirrels. It’s their puffy tails. They’re just cute. And clothes are amazing, too. When we’re in human form on our own where humans can’t see us, we don’t bother with these.”
“And do you agree to take the Holmes name as your own?” Mycroft asked, in a much more serious tone than Mrs. Hudson.
“That’s a blatant exaggeration,” Mycroft protested.
“That’s not the kind of answer I’m looking for and you know it. Come on. It’s your turn to be selfish. Tell me what you want. Your ideal, future scenario. What would it look like?”
“God, I’ve missed this,” John murmured.
“I want to clarify something,” Sherlock said, limping into the kitchen.
“Try it. We both know if won’t magically turn you into a seal.”
Mycroft froze. His eyes widened, breath trapped in his throat. Now Greg looked at him, pitying, apologetic, and filled with shame.
, Greg replied.
“Please, that was just simple observation.”
“You insisted that I wasn’t hallucinating.”
“It’s alright, mate,” Greg said, smiling as he reached the top of the stairs. “I know how impatient you are.”
Mycroft shot him a pointed look, scrutinizing him, but Sherlock refused to be cowed.
“It’s Gabriel,” he said.
They returned to the beach that day, and the day after, which John took off as a sick day so that Sherlock wouldn’t spend all day alone in the house. Of course, he did for the rest of the week, but Sherlock was certainly not going to complain. They settled into a comfortable routine. They shared meals (except for when Sherlock slept in the weekday mornings). Watched the telly. Discussed Sherlock’s latest reading and questions. Sherlock walked John through the steps of his deductive process in past cases (which John was an avid listener of). Went out for short walks and longer drives when they got tired of being cooped up in the house.
“It’s fine. She’s used to me.” They began going up the stairs. “I held out for as long as I could, but the two of you kept gabbing like a couple of busybodies. I’ve been fantasizing about having you here all to myself for ages. I’m not waiting anymore.”
“Oh, come on. You were probably just smelling the salt in my sweat.”
“Yes, humans are wrong about an awful lot of things,” John said.
“I hate to break it to you, but most people are ordinary.”
“Isn’t it supposed to be healthy for people in this sort of relationship to air their grievances?”
“A head?!” he gasped. “You’re not bringing a head into the flat.”
“There’s no need to thank me, Mrs. Hudson,” he said, still smiling. “It was the least I could do.”
“And you’re a royal pain in my arse.”
Greg smiled. Fond. Nostalgic. Yet still too sorrowful for where they needed to be to take the next step.
“You mean you don’t find me cute?”
“Greg, I would never hurt you. Never. Please tell me you know that.”
The giddy feeling in Sherlock’s chest intensified.
John frowned in confusion.
“In that case, won’t the threat be enough to get him to let me go without saying anything?”
She leaned against the counter, waiting for the water to boil as Mycroft opened the cabinet the cups were in. As the guest, he wasn’t obligated to fetch them. His question had been experimental. Sherlock filched whatever he pleased from Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen, perfectly at home. Mycroft wouldn’t presume to do the same without asking, but this little gesture still placed him a bit beyond an acquaintance of necessity, which was how he had felt until now. The dinner had divested Mycroft of his doubts that Mrs. Hudson merely tolerated him for being Sherlock’s brother. Her support regarding Greg had been most welcome, and the environment had been comfortable and familiar, save for who sat at the head of the table. There had been no need to dissemble his personal life or fend off an attempt at matchmaking. Sherlock had been relaxed, even if he adopted a combative version of it. Yet he hadn’t been sullen or counting the seconds until he could leave and not have to come back for months. It had been a welcome respite from Mycroft’s usual disappointment with anything familial. Even now, despite Sherlock’s tiresome recklessness, there was a comfort in being able to be open up about his little brother with someone who cared for him but didn’t disapprove of his choice of profession.
He was crouching down beside Sherlock now. Sherlock flinched, hyperaware of the helpless position he was in. He was sitting on the ground, injured leg stretched before him, bracing himself on his hands, grasping only a small stone as a weapon as an unknown nudist who might not even be real spoke to him.
“We better not.”
“No, but I can’t be a hundred percent sure—”
Or so he had thought, until Greg subjected him to that grievous phone call. Perhaps Sherlock was right and he had pushed Greg away. Greg himself thought so. It hadn’t been Mycroft’s intention to hurt him by doing so, yet it appeared that he had. Greg had become a liability, a whirlwind that tore his control to pieces. Sherlock already took up too much of his thought process. He didn’t need another person clogging his mind. Yet Greg’s sudden distance had torn his peace even more asunder. He’d thought that he’d steadied the ship, soothed the waters, learned to love him without being dominated by this love. But he had failed utterly, had he not?
“Mm. I must do something about it, then.”
Mrs. Hudson cast him a disapproving glance as she reached for her coat inside the wardrobe by the back door. She was taking Sherlock out to a chamber music concert to cheer up his spirits while he missed John, although his mood had gotten a lovely boost yesterday. He had even managed to get out of the house and to Barts to conduct experiments on dead tissue.
Anxiety over his predicament had robbed Sherlock of his appetite, but he stopped himself short of refusing John’s offer. Something about the bond of breaking bread with this intriguing being enticed him.
“Thanks for that compliment,” he said, a pleased smile on his face. “I’m still not happy about you dismissing everyone else like that, but… Although some are idiots. But that’s not the point. Anyway. If there is something that I’m doing that is a genuine problem—my teeth brushing doesn’t count—you can tell me. And, likewise, I’ll tell you. But don’t worry about these little things. I don’t mind if you vent every once in a while. Who doesn’t? You can just relax about that, okay?”
Sherlock would never have imagined anything like this ever happening to him. How could he have? Selkies. Fairies. Ghosts. Creatures of legend. How short-sighted his perspective had been. He had never been so glad to be wrong.
“I am,” John said. He spoke quickly, flustered and appeasing, no longer holding a brave front against Mycroft. “I swear. I’m not going to hurt him or do anything that could hurt him. Neither of you have anything to worry about.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, forcing his voice to be louder.
Sherlock’s slid off his face. Middle name?
John’s eyes widened and he sat up, utterly startled, as if Sherlock’s words were anything less than the truth.
“Okay.”
“But I don’t want to look elsewhere. I’m tired of the whole dating game. I cannot tell you how much I don’t want to go back to it. And how long would it take me to find someone? How long after that until me and this hypothetical person have kids? How old would I be by then? I certainly wouldn’t be any less busy than I am now. I don’t want to be one of those dads who only sees his kids on weekends. Is it even worth thinking about now?”
Sherlock pointed at the small, plastic toy glued to the dashboard.
Finally! God, he’d been gong completely mad. He hobbled over to the desk and sank into the chair, opening his laptop, his left leg jiggling with nervous energy, left hand tapping so hard on the desk that it hurt, but he couldn’t stop. He should have brought cigarettes. What on earth had possessed him to come here with no cigarettes? He could call the front desk. They could get him some, couldn’t they?
“It would seem so.”
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock groaned and rubbed his eyes, starting to pull his legs to his chest before his right ankle sharply reprimanded him for the action.
Mycroft leaned into him gratefully, eyes slipping shut, nose sinking into Greg’s soft hair, inhaling the familiar scent of his shampoo. Greg rubbed his back, squeezing with his fingertips, only just stopping himself from delivering one of the massages they used to indulge in of old. Mycroft’s smile grew, remaining even after Greg pulled back.
Greg studied his face for a moment longer, then his eyes lightened and his lips curled in a smile.
John chuckled. He sucked his bottom lip, nodding.
“They don’t know about me,” he said. “It hadn’t been relevant before, and I don’t have the energy to tell them now. They’re not supportive. In any sense, but especially not this one.”
“Because we don’t do that,” John said. “It’s the same as outing someone.”
Sherlock looked down at the counter.
“Mm? Sorry, I got distracted for a moment.”
Sherlock hesitated for a second, then shrugged off his coat and jacket, and rolled up his sleeves above his elbows, showing John his puckered needle scars. John’s brows rose when he saw them, mouth opening in a silent “oh”.
“Being reprimanded by your landlady, apparently. She had some choice words for me about how I met John.”
“Uh, well. That’s all, really. I mean, I was surprised. I’ve never known you to be in a relationship before and you roll your eyes at romantic stuff. I was thinking you might be…” Greg shifted in his seat, looking even more uncomfortable. “I don’t want to assume.”
“Okay. Um, you really should tell the police where we are. We’ve kept them in the dark about that for a long while. Won’t it look suspicious?”
“It’s not random. I have an order, too, just not the sort that you would notice. And that sounded like a complaint.”
Sherlock grinned.
“I warn you. Some of them involve murder.”
“You were pretty freaked out yesterday. Again, I apologize.”
“I can oblige you on that,” he said. “Not the piece you heard earlier, though. It’s not finished.”
“Simple observation doesn’t involve metaphors.”
“Nothing new since I called you,” Sherlock said, pulling back from Mrs. Hudson and diving for the box of tissues in the kitchen. He brought it back to the sitting room and curled into the armchair, yanking out a couple of tissues before holding the box out to Mrs. Hudson, who was sniffy herself. She sat down on the chair opposite. Mycroft came over to them as they blew their noses, grabbing the bin from beside the desk and placing it beside them so they could dispose of the tissues. He continued to be helpful by going to the kitchen and bringing them glasses of water. Sherlock downed his in one gulp. His throat hurt, inflamed from the heaving tears. His head ached, too. He’d probably need to take a painkiller later.
“You’ve always come out alright,” Greg said. “But chances run out. John can’t be there to save you every time. You left him behind, too.”
“So you can show off your swimming skills for me?”
“I got Angelo off a murder charge. He was burgling on the other side of London at the time of the murder. After he got out of prison, having received a much shorter sentence than he would have if I hadn’t taken his case, he opened up this restaurant and has been giving me free meals ever since. Hardly necessary. He paid me my fee, but I’m not going to complain. Clients like giving me free things.”
“He does?” Greg asked, eyes boggling. “How the devil did that happen?”
“I have to go out,” he said.
“It’s acceptable, then? Can I continue to call you ‘doctor’?”
“No,” Sherlock said, breathing more easily. “None at all. John’s a rotten liar. He wouldn’t have been able to get that one past me. But he might change his mind in the future.”
“Of course,” Mycroft said. “What happened?”
“Oh, no, don’t mind me,” John said, looking between Sherlock and Mycroft with amusement.
