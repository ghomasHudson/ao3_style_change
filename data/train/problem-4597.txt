“That’s wonderful Sarah.”
"What?"
"What do you mean?"
Dean swallowed, suddenly hot beneath Castiel's unwavering gaze.
Dean floundered and glanced around at the expectant faces.
Cas shook his head.
“She always loved old things. She used to say that they had proven their worth by standing the test of time. After she died I felt so lost and alone. Going to Stanford was a way for me to continue living my life while still honoring her memory.”
"Wait," Sam said, putting the pieces of Deans story together with the phone call he'd just heard, "does Sonny know what we do?"
They stood and Castiel sent a sad glance at Muriel's body before moving to the door.
Dean shook his head, hefting his brother and continuing on towards the bedrooms.
"They were amazed you were still breathing. Apparently your insides were turning to goop, something about massive burns on all your organs, but you're starting to improve which they can't explain. They're calling you a miracle."
His voice cut out and Cas waited with bated breath for him to continue.
Dean shook his head. He could feel tears of relief spring up in his eyes, heating his cheeks and there was no way he was going to burst out crying in some parking lot in front of his brother.
"Dean, wake up, it's all right." he said softly as he reached out his hand to rest on Dean's shoulder.
"Dean, I—"
Dean shrugged. "I took the lot and went to sleep."
"So you think I tried to kill myself," the prophet flinched at the words, "because I wanted relief from my suffering? Because I wanted peace?" He leaned forwards, his gaze intent, "Tell me, Kevin, if I were to die, where do you think I would go, hmmm? To heaven, to eternal rest, to sit beside the throne and sing praises to God everyday and wander around in a white robe with a harp?" he scoffed, and sat back against the pillows that propped him up looking away, "No. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much good I do in the time left to me, I will never be able to make up for what I've done. So I thought I would save everybody the inconvenience of being here and dispose of myself for you. Hell is the only place I belong."
"What?" Kevin barked, reddening under his mother's stern look, "…Sorry, Mom."
Cas moved in closer, pressing his body against Dean's and intertwining their fingers.
"You went to the hospital for
“You go.” He heard himself say, “I’ll be right behind you.”
Sam shook his head. They sat in silence contemplating the implications. Good things didn't tend to happen to the Winchesters and, in their experience, resurrections were rarely a good thing.
Dean gasped and broke away, breathing heavily.
"Is that all this is to you Dean? Something that can be entered into casually? That can be spoken about in such off hand terms?"
"From the fall?"
They stared for a beat more until Dean turned away and trudged off.
Dean let out a half-hearted snort of laughter.
He could practically hear Benny's grin down the line.
Sam looked at her, his eyes swimming in unshed tears.
Merry Christmas Bro
"That and whatever hell baggage he lifted off of your plate. It's not going to be pretty."
"Dean."
"Yeah, we're fine. Cas stole one of the angel's mojo so he's all powered up again."
Cas looked regretful and shook his head.
"Take it easy man." Sonny said to Dean as he made his way back to the house before turning around.
"Are you in love with Dean?"
Dean shook his head and shrugged again.
Dean's eyes unfocused and he was silent a moment before he came back and said with a frown, "Curious, alert, concerned."
He sat up and back against the pillows, yawning and stretching, rubbing his hands down his face. He looked over at the angel reclining beside him. Dean reached out a hand and carded it through the soft hair that sat in its usual mussed fashion atop his head.
"Wait," he said, stepping back, planting a hand on Cas' shoulder, staring him in the face, "did you... did you just understand a Death Star reference?"
"Don't get me wrong, I love being here with you. If I didn't have this to anchor me I'm not sure what I would do, but I still miss heaven. And this pain; I have tried to do as you do, to push it away and ignore it, but it only seems to multiply when I do and I don't think I can do it anymore. How do you keep from feeling this way, Dean? How do you manage it?"
"You want me to go out and get lucky?" he asked.
But somehow Castiel had still managed to burrow inside him and Dean, to his utmost surprise, had let him. And then sent him away at the first sign of potential heartbreak and here he was, three months later, praying to the angel to come back while sobbing into the pillow that still smelt like him.
Castiel's arms tightened around Dean, his breath hitching as his heart broke for the man in his arms. He had never felt the desire to kill before. Sure he had done his share of smiting and he had killed many angels, during the war and his time as 'God', but never had he felt such rage rise up in him as he did now and in that moment he knew for a fact that, grace or no grace, if John Winchester were to appear now, here in this room, he would not hesitate to wrap his hands around the man's neck and squeeze. He was, after all, a creature of wrath; a soldier of heaven, born for battle to do God's bidding; to protect good and destroy evil.
And with that he was gone.
Sarah nodded, her smile sad as she took Sam's hand, looking into his eyes.
"Dean are you saying that Dad…that he…"
She died with a cry and a blast of pure angelic light.
Cas rolled his eyes.
"He may have been, but
Dean still couldn't quite get over the look of Cas in soft flannel pants and his old ratty t-shirts that Cas always insisted on wearing, despite having his own.
"Goodnight Cas."
"Those no good, piece of shit, cocksucking…"
Dean nodded.
"It's okay."
"Wow, Prophet of the Lord. Sounds important and awesome." she smiled, shaking his hand.
"I didn't mean in a bad way. I just meant that I had no basis of comparison. I had no idea what the sensation meant only that I wanted to feel it again and again. So I asked that I be the one to approach you. And every time an opportunity came up to meet with you, I took it. I convinced my superiors that I was the best choice because you were distrustful of angels and I was familiar to you – and that was true – but mostly I just wanted to be near you. So I could continue to experience that sensation I felt whenever I was around you."
"I just want to make sure you're all right." he added.
"Anyway. It's getting late. I'm gonna grab some food and then I'll come down. What's your room number?"
Dean sat back and grabbed the hand Cas wasn't currently using to rub soothing circles into his brother's back, intertwining their fingers and squeezing tight.
"Yeah." he said. "I'm fine."
Sam was in the library, filling the journal Dean had given him for Christmas with information garnered from the men of letter's vast repository, when the sound of bare feet on the marble floor of the bunker heralded the arrival of his brother, who burst into the main atrium with a look of blind anxiety in his eyes.
“So what?”
So they strolled through the wilderness hand in hand, boots crunching over frozen ground, fingers intertwined. Dean breathed in the crisp, clean air, letting his body and mind relax as they made their way deeper into the woods.
“This ain’t gonna go well.”
"Dean," his voice was soft and sad as he caught and held Dean's gaze, "your father was never, could never have been the righteous man. And Alistair knew that. Even if he had broken and shed blood in hell, it would not have broken the first seal."
"Because this time you have me." Dean said simply, but with conviction. "And I'm not gonna let that happen."
Cas moaned at the contact, grabbing needy fistfuls of Dean’s jacket.
"Narnia?" she rolled her eyes, "I am so wasted here."
He turned, creating the portal back with a sweeping gesture of his arm. As he stepped into the ever growing column of smokey, liquid light, he turned and, with a wink, he was gone.
"Well, I can't stay here, Dean." Cas said, obviously not catching on to Dean's warning tone. "For one thing, the warding is blocking most of my power, and I don't even know where Metatron is. Also, my wings are damaged beyond repair which means I can't fly."
"Thanks." The words were soft, almost inaudible, but Dean looked round anyway, blinking sleepily.
"The biblical tale of Abraham and Issac. You know it?"
"Woah, woah."
Dean looked over at Cas.
Suddenly Dean wanted, needed, to kiss Cas, to remind himself that this was real, that last night had actually happened, as though Cas being here asleep in his bed wasn't proof enough.
Dean's face screwed up into a look of confusion. "What's that supposed to mean?"
Sam gasped as Cas let go of him and Dean rushed forward with a concerned, “Sam?”
As Castiel was going through the bags, pulling out clothes and folding them, something caught his eye.
Dean was silent for a beat as he tried to process the information.
Jody stared between the three of them, mouth open and eyes blinking before she shook her head, closed her eyes and sighed, throwing her hands up in a gesture of surrender.
"Cas." Dean asked.
The sound echoed in his mind, filled it up until all he knew was light and comfort and ecstasy and that voice. It was still Jimmy's voice but underscored with something…else. Something ancient and vast. A voice that could cause earthquakes and bring a mountain to its knees. A voice that could shatter glass.
"You should still have a birthday though, so I can make you pie."
"Never? Aren't you like thousands of years old?"
Dean frowned at Theo's burned out body, and caught Castiel's eye.
"It's halfway, I guess."
He looked down into the crib and his eyes lit on the infant there and his stomach jolted as he stared down at his sleeping self.
“Yeah, yeah now can we end this chick flick moment before one of us grows a uterus?”
Dean struggled to cut the memory short, biting his lip and fighting to suppress the panic attack, willing his breathing to even out and his body to stop shaking.
Sam stepped forward slowly, his hands held out in a gesture of peace.
"You know there is still one resource."
Dean shifted and pressed a kiss to Castiel's forehead.
"I got something I need to tell you, Cas. I should have told you this sooner, but…It's not easy for me to talk about. I…" He cut himself off. He knew he was rambling, and Cas was looking utterly confused from his position on the bed.
He thought about Castiel who sat beside him and how patient he'd been with Dean in the past few weeks since Dean had poured his heart out to him in the crappy motel room. They had made some headway in their physical relationship, moving forward slowly and tentatively, Cas always quick to ask Dean how he was feeling and if it was too much. Truth be told, at times it was annoying as hell and Dean may or may not have snapped at Cas once or twice for being overbearing and overly cautious, but sitting here in this group, surrounded by strangers and the two people he loved and trusted most in the world, he was thankful for the support he had no matter how saccharine that sounded.
Neither Cas nor Dean looked entirely convinced. While Sam no longer looked like a strong wind might knock him over, he still tired easily and was prone to dizzy spells that had Dean wound tighter than a two dollar watch, especially when they were on a case.
It had been just over a month since Dean had kissed Castiel and Cas, after giving it much thought, had kissed him back. The two had slid seamlessly from being friends and roommates to something much more intimate and neither could quite believe how easy a transition it had been and how good it felt. A few days after Halloween, Dean had taken Cas to the graveyard where his mom was buried. He'd introduced his new boyfriend to her and told her all about him, making Castiel blush from the praise.
Cas nodded.
The portal closed in a rush of air and the warehouse was left still and silent. Castiel stood staring at the place Gabriel had disappeared from until Dean came up behind him and rested a comforting hand on his shoulder. Cas turned, staring into his eyes and leaned in, wrapping his arms tightly around the hunter.
"What's wrong?"
Dean's stomach rolled in discomfort at Cas' use of the phrase 'talk about our feelings', but nevertheless, he nodded.
Sam smirked.
"May I speak with her?"
"What is that?" he asked breathlessly.
"Hello Castiel." he said in his calm, soothing manner, a trademark of the medics; calm in the face of all suffering.
"Sorry." he said, standing and moving out of the room as the tears he could no longer hold at bay burst forth. Maybe he was at a point where he could talk about his issues with people, but he was definitely still not comfortable crying in public.
"So it's a dead end?"
The man lifted his head slowly, his eyes barely open and his hair sticking up where it had been resting on his arms. He moaned, swaying in his seat. Dean had seen enough drunks in his time to know that there was no way this guy was getting home on his own.
Cas shook his head.
"Up until what?" Sam didn't know what had lead to it but he was determined to get his brother to talk about it. Long gone were the days when he'd let Dean bury his feelings, they had fled the day three years ago when Dean had broken down by the side of the road and confessed the horrors John had put him through.
“You’ve gotta be kidding me!” Dean muttered angrily as he followed the angel inside. Could he not just once catch a break?
Sam sat panting, trying to get his bearings. He looked around until he locked eyes with his brother.
Dean straightened and set the plates in the sink before tuning and facing Castiel.
"But it was me who allowed it to happen."
He moved to shut the door and Cas turned to look at Dean's lifeless, bloodstained body. This was his fault, his doing. He should not have prayed. He should not have put Dean in danger. Theo moved back into his line of sight, brandishing a drill.
"Of course."
“Does Dean make you happy?” She asked.
"All right, come here, big brother." he hoisted Dean up and pulled his arm up and over his shoulder, bending down and grabbing Dean behind the knees and lifting him up into a fireman's carry.
"Anyway, after dad died, Sam went back to school. Law school. I thought about continuing to do what my dad taught me but…I don't know, it wasn't the same on my own, without Sam or dad, and I was in a really bad place."
Cas sighed.
“If you heard what I just said to Sam then you heard me saying that I don’t care. I mean sure, I’d love to know about you, I want to know everything about you. But I also know that you’re not ready and that’s okay.”
Enjoy and happy 2015!
Charlie noticed the looks Dorothy kept throwing them, assuming the worst as the huntress turned and regarded the redhead.
"He said you saved him."
"Good, now, this isn't going to turn into another Gilda situation is it?"
"You're sure I won't be imposing? We've only been together a short while."
Crowley smirked.
"What's the matter darling? Cowardly lion got your tongue?"
"Uh, yeah." Sam said, not at all comfortable with the situation. "Can you read Elamite?"
"They each got seven years. Seven years for ruining my life. For killing my-"
Cas hesitated, but nodded.
They drove in silence through the darkness. Sam was dozing in the front seat, Castiel had his head pressed to the window in the back, watching the stars and the dark outline of the trees as they rushed passed, and Dean was lost in thought as the Impala's headlights lit the never-ending road that stretched out in front of them.
"You know I didn't do it to…"
Screw hell,
"Don't make promises you can't keep." He said softly, almost inaudibly, his expression closed off and guarded.
"Gadreel." Castiel warned as he continued.
"Guarded by two of Metatron's most loyal." Gadreel answered, indicating the mother and daughter seen playing there. "I recruited them myself. So, you said you had a plan... How we might convince them to let us pass."
Grace.
"Dean."
"Sammy!" He looked up, his voice pleading, "Cas! Castiel! Please! Please Cas I need you!"
For a moment, Castiel thought maybe Sam Winchester had lied to him as some sort of epic revenge - that for some reason involved reuniting him with his daughter - and then the penny dropped and he was confronted by the impossibly long list of rockstar aliases Dean had to choose from.
"Each side wants to crush the other, overthrow Metatron, and rule heaven, and...heaven under either of them would be..."
"Yeah."
Sam took the file from Cas and looked it over, before perusing the scene.
"I like that."
"It wasn't my fault?" Dean asked softly.
"I can provide the blood." Cas said calmly.
"I only found out about it a couple of years ago. Cas was, well, dead and Dean was pretty upset, and I guess he just couldn't hold it in anymore."
"I'm sor—dragons?" She asked, her eyes wide. "Those are a thing?"
"Sam!"
"I have no idea."
Dean, who was looking unblinkingly at Bobby, nodded. Of course he trusted him.
"Yeah."
"Look," Dean said, holding up his hands, "all I did was give him a job and a place to stay."
Dean nodded.
Dean nodded, "Alright then. I'll see you soon then."
Sam looked around, finally noticing the nearly forgotten third person in the room.
Crowley nodded.
"So…you don't want to come then?" he tried to phrase it as casually as possible so as not to alert Cas to the fact that he was slowly dying inside.
Castiel stared at Dean for another long second before nodding and disappearing in a ruffle of invisible wings.
"Beat the crap out of you?" Dean offered.
"Hey, Cheetah, Think fast." Jo said as she threw the towel she's been using to wipe down tables at him. He turned and it hit him in the face, bouncing off and falling lightly to the ground.
Cas dipped down and brought his lips once again to Dean's, letting out a surprised sound as Dean reached down and brushed his hand against Cas, smiling against his lips at the sound.
"Why?" Sam asked.
The witch stared at him for a beat, her head tilted as she considered the veracity of his word before presumably deciding he was telling the truth and disintegrating into a tornado of green and grey and disappeared into the air vents.
"You will never get away with this." Castiel's voice trembled as he strained against the cuffs, desperate to get this over with so he could find Dean and reassure himself that the hunter was okay.
He was tired of the pity.
"The guy was a douche Cas. He killed Ezra and switched sides only to have Metatron kill him. He was a loser."
Cas had tried explaining it to him but it had only left Dean insisting that
"And Sam is freaking out and wants you to find out if there's anything on that tablet that can help him? And let me guess – he has unrealistic expectations as to how long that's going to take?"
before everyone else came in with:
"Shit. You weren't supposed to hear that."
"Kevin!" Linda shouted, grabbing her son and attempting to calm him down.
It never even entered his mind that John Winchester did not feature in any of the moments.
"Who the hell is Charlie?"
Here it is, 'The Talk', I hope you like it. Takes place during 9x07
"You've been looking after my brother?"
"Wha—…is this mine?"
Sam and Kevin were sitting at the map table when Dean and Cas got back, lugging their shopping down the stairs.
"Hmm?" Dean asked.
"Here," he said, fishing some bills out of his wallet, "go pay, I'm gonna check in with Sam."
Castiel's voice was small, quiet, almost childlike, and Dean slid down the bed and turned so that they were lying face to face. Cas' eyes were large and bright despite the dimness of the room. Dean reached out and cupped his cheek.
Dean turned, hefting his overnight bag, and made it about two steps before he collapsed to the ground.
"Awesome."
"No, it's not. It's about you thinking you can't have the things you want; it's about you being afraid to open yourself up to something because you might get hurt.
Kevin hovered outside Crowley's room, deliberating on whether or not to go in.
The man sighed.
Cas looked down at his daughter and a pang of longing burst through his chest at the thought of how much time he had lost watching her grow. Guiding her, teaching her, keeping her safe. Not for the first time, unkind thoughts toward Amelia surfaced in his mind, rants fuelled by righteous fury on the absence of her right to keep this all important part of himself from him.
Jody looked up from her computer.
"What?" Was all he had managed once the wheezing had subsided.
"Seriously, you want a pillow?" Dean asked as he mixed his cornflakes up and took a bite.
"You want some warm milk?"
"Yes."
When Castiel had finally reached Dean, and Dean had turned from the soul he had been torturing, the anger and pain and sadistic fury that had driven him to accept Alistair's offer of relief had melted at the sight of Castiel's heavenly presence and he had collapsed, distraught and broken and sobbing in the presence of something so pure in the depths of a place so twisted and dark. When Castiel had reached for him, Dean had fought him tooth and nail, animalistic rage taking over as he struggled against the goodness that he didn't feel he deserved until Castiel was forced to grab hold of the soul itself and flee, dragging Dean along behind him. He remembered the ecstasy of his grace connecting with the soul of Dean Winchester, ecstasy that had fuelled his cry.
[7.12., 21:06] Castiel: Do you hang up mistletoe?
Cas grabs Dean's phone and google searches a picture.
"What?" Cas takes his glass and stares into it with an empty gaze. "She's not happy with me."
Dean whispers. "I am fine. Go on please."
"Theodicy. The question of  how there can be a loving God with all the misery in the world. Lots of philosophers have devoted themselves to that topic."
Cas writhes hard and pants Dean's name.
Dean takes his hand off Castiel's cock and licks it until it's nice and wet. Then spreads the moisture onto Cas cock. With the slide now eased, he strokes faster.
[3.3., 15:25] Castiel: Mmmmh, I think I might wear my shirt and tie
[4.12., 20:04] Dean: Oh?
[4.1., 22:25] Dean: I'll switch therapist.
"Of course." Cas grins. "Are you going to therapy tomorrow, or did you have a test tomorrow too?"
[6.12., 13:48] Castiel: Would you like prove?
Dean is in sweats and a tank and one of the guys eyes him with interest
"I have rain gear. I can go alone."
"Donna here yet?"
Cas chuckles.
[28.1., 12:40] Anael: So talk
Cas stands staring at what used to be his car, panting and speechless in shock.
"Nerd. Come here." Dean grabs Castiel and rolls them over so that he is on top . He slots one of his legs between Cas' and licks into his mouth.
"Is alright. Think I'm going to come."
[12.1., 14:58] Castiel: Oh come on, you love when I'm the dorky one
[12.2., 18:05] Castiel: Happy Buddha on Market Street
"I'll be right back with you, i forgot my mug downstairs."
[25.1., 07:45] Castiel: Your father is out.
"What now?" Cas asks.
Dean stiffens in Cas's arm. "Don't. Not here. Please."
"I am sorry Dean. "
"I'm so very sorry. I shouldn't have done that."
Dean is still laughing, wiping tears from his eyes as he gets up to grab some fresh waxing material from Castiel's main bathroom.
[19.1., 09:25] Castiel: Her and me both.
He gets in his car and drives off.
"Bed and cuddles?"
"Thank you."
Cas lays down in Dean’s lap after he starts the movie.
[22.12., 23:13] Dean: Ewww
[27.1., 22:18] Castiel: But you don't have an empty house. Won't be drinking your first coffee alone
Cas cringes. "Oh shit, Dean. I'm so sorry I wasn't there!" Cas clings to him. "I didn't mean to scare you!!!"
"Thank you. " Deans stomach rumbles loudly.
Cas puts the dirty clothes and towels aside then lays next to Dean.
"But it's a great step forward, acknowledgement of the fact that you need help is a good thing."
[3.12., 19:17] Castiel: I see.
[2.12., 11:08] Dean: Special cat. Mein neighborhood stray only eats from the neighbours across the street. Mine always got ignored
[3.12., 10:50] Castiel: Like?
[8.1., 10:42] Dean: Guess I'll be here till you get home
"I love you too, Freckles. Good night."
Dean smiles. "I was all alone. Plus you haven't even seen the best part yet. Look."
They get ready for bed and Dean waits under the blankets for Cas to join him.
[7.12., 20:47] Dean: Hahahahahahahahaha
[3.12., 11:55] Dean: We are almost home
Tuesday morning has Dean waking up just as exhausted as he went to bed. He groans and turns his arm off. "I don't want to."
"Hi Babe." Cas leans over and kisses Dean softly.
[24.2., 14:47] Dean: Ohhh
Cas walks slowly to give Dean time.
"What?" Castiel questions.
"Good morning." Cas mumbles feeling Dean move. "What time is it, Dean?"
[2.12., 12:46] Dean: I mean right now this number is called hot stuff
[24.12., 20:39] Dean: I detect a theme for your gifts for me
He realises after Dean slips off his back, that his boyfriend has fallen asleep.
He sits up and let's his hands wander all over Dean's torso.
"So, nothing at all?" Castiel wants to know.
[3.3., 09:06] Dean: How is work going
"Morning Angel. How are you feeling?"
[3.12., 20:00] Castiel: You don't believe in what?
[6.12., 18:31] Dean: Jack couldn't look into my face without blushing bright red
Dean comes home after work and collapses onto the kitchen chair. "Hey Angel." He says weakly. "I hate Mondays."
[4.12., 21:23] Dean: Or how much we are talking
[6.12., 18:23] Castiel: Are you naked again?
[4.2., 14:22] Dean: No. You are supposed to be an artist
Dean hums and nods before scooting further down. "Kiss?"
[3.12., 19:06] Dean: He is the towns biggest gossip topic
“Well, you’re—you’re an angel, right? You’re closer to God, or something. And Dean can—he can see you. I mean—couldn’t you do some sort of blessing in
He’ll know how to say it, by then. He’ll say,
“May I?” he says, reaching for it. She hesitates, but holds it out to him, still keeping one earbud in her ear, as if to tether it to her.
Dean doesn’t say anything.
“I think I’d go to Nebraska. Somewhere that isn’t anywhere. Somewhere… you don’t see that shit on TV, you know? There’s not so many stories there. You could… you could come. We’d make up our own. I’d buy a house way out in some corner where I’d never been before. You could…” Dean smiles a little. “You could slow down, spend some more time watching bees again. Get one of those little bee houses.”
They don’t talk about Hell much. Well, ever. Even though Cas is the one who pulled Dean out. Even though the mark of it is still there on Dean’s shoulder. Scar tissue, like his touch was a wound that had to heal over. Cas stays quiet.
He had been avoiding the rest of the inhabitants of the bunker, partly because he knew they wanted him to, but partly also because every time he looked at Sam or Dean or Castiel or Linda Tran, he remembered the countless times he had used, abused, and/or betrayed them. And Kevin. Kevin's scarred, jaded eyes that had once been so wide and innocent. He was responsible for those eyes. He could remember snapping his girlfriend's neck for no other reason than because it caused the prophet pain. He had cut his finger off, kidnapped and tortured his mother, pursued him relentlessly, held him captive…
"Umm, I don't really know how–where to start."
"What?!"
"What?" he asked softly, his fingers lingering on the bare chest, skimming over the smooth skin and Enochian tattoo.
Dean leaned forwards, pressing their foreheads together as his hand idly played with the short hairs at the nape of Cas' neck.
"Dean." Benny's low, southern drawl sounded down the line as the call connected. "How're you doin' brother?"
“Merry Christmas Dean.”
"Okay." he said, standing and gathering the plates. "You want another?" he asked pointing to Dean's empty mug.
He turned, facing the former angel, still encircled in his arms and brought his lips down to meet Cas'.
"You are the best boyfriend ever." He smiled, leaning over and planting a kiss on Cas' surprised face.
Dean frowned.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Because they think I was in league with Metatron. They think I know how he cast the angels out and therefore how we might go about opening heaven."
The room was silent as they ruminated on the unknown fate of Chuck before Charlie once again broke the uncomfortable mood.
Dean scoffed and pressed a quick kiss to his hair before helping him stand and turning to his brother.
"Wings. Except almost all of the feathers are gone."
Dean huffed out a laugh and scratched the back of his neck in embarrassment. It seemed even stranger when said out loud.
"He is a good friend—" he began.
"So I'm a fake." The angel shrugged. "Do you have any idea how much pancake makeup and soft lighting it took to get God to work a rope line? He hated it. And, you know, humans sense that. So they prayed harder and longer and fought more wars in his name. And for what?! So they could die of malaria? Leukemia? And all the while, blaming themselves! 'Oh, if only I'd been more prayerful, God would have loved me! God would have saved me!' You know what?! God didn't even know their name! But I do. Because I've walked among them. And I can save them."
"She told me." Crowley answered.
"DEAN! DEAN, COME QUICKLY!"
"He ain't lying."
Dean sat against the wall, beaten and broken, face throbbing and blood trickling and obscuring his vision. Blearily, he caught sight if the angel blade that sat just out of reach. He strained his aching body to reach forward, stubbornly ignoring the way his ribs screamed in agony at the movement until he had the weapon in his grasp. A thrill of victory went through him and he sat up. Only to find Metatron in front of him with his own angel blade which he drove hard into Dean's chest.
"Dean." He said softly, almost inaudibly.
"That's cause I'm carrying you, Dean."
A jolt of doubt lurched deep within him, a voice, which sounded suspiciously like his father, whispering to him that he would screw it up, that this would not last. After all, how could it? Good things didn't happen to Dean Winchester, he didn't know the first thing about how to be in a healthy fulfilling relationship, of course he was going to wreck this.
Dean rolled his eyes and shook his head.
"Dean—"
He packed his bag and stared around at the room that held the best of his memories. He looked over at the closet that stood open and still housed all of Castiel's human clothes and at the wall of photos Cas had accrued. A jolt of sentimentality washed over him and he pulled down his favourites and stowed them in his bag. Then he grabbed the duffle and Brian's cage and left, shutting off the light and closing the door. He didn't look back.
Sam cut off his train of thought with two quiet words.
“How did you know? Did Dean?”
Cas hummed.
"…All right." he said with a resigned sigh, picking up his phone and dialling.
"What's the next big town?" Dean interjected.
Cas had once looked at Dean that way.
“Thanks Castiel.” Sam answered, feeling like he would never be able to stop grinning like and idiot, “Listen,” he said, changing topics, “I just wanted to say, I’m glad Dean has you.”
"Dean, it's alright."
"But…what?! How?"
His voice caught in his throat and he shook his head.
"How many people is this reaching?" he asked.
“Don’t defend me.” The angel countered, “Do you have any idea the death toll in heaven? On Earth?”
"Hey." he said casually, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice.
As he tried to process what had just happened, an agonizing cry went up from across the warehouse and he glanced up to see his brother standing frozen in horror. Sammy. Sammy had come. Sammy had followed him. Probably tracked him on the phone he had forgotten to turn off. Or maybe he hadn't forgotten. Maybe he had wanted his brother to find him. To be with him at the end.
Crowley raised his eyebrows. "For what?"
"Go." he said, gesturing to the hallway that lead to the bedrooms. "I'll restore these."
Charlie looked like she wanted to ignore the question but she relented and let Dean change the topic. The look in her eye however clearly said this wasn't over.
been easy. It had been the easiest decision he'd ever made. But at the same time it had been the most painful; tearing himself out of the life that had been given to him. Away from Sonny, away from Robin, away from his good grades at school and the stupid wrestling trophy which he left sitting on his bedside table. It had hurt so damn much.
He nodded to Theo who nodded back and stepped towards the angel. Muriel began to pant in fear.
Sam rolled his eyes.
Dean seemed to deflate, dropping down onto the bed, his head in his hands. Castiel sat down slowly beside him and reached out to rest a comforting hand on Dean's tense shoulder. Dean threw it off with an angry gesture.
"Except those that got it."
"For what?"
"Right." Sam agreed, "So…" he trailed off suggestively.
Dean nodded, warmed by his brother's words. Despite being incredibly uncomfortable with the topic of conversation, it felt good getting it out there, as though every word spoken out loud dissolved a little piece of the secret he'd been holding inside for so long, leaving him a little lighter each time.
"I'll pass it along."
"So Charlie, how do you know so much about, like Cas and everything?" Kevin asked having picked up on her throwaway comments to the two hunter brothers.
Castiel took the money to the counter where a harried-looking blonde woman seemed to be having some sort of verbal altercation over the phone.
Dean looked at her blankly.
“Cas told me about what happened to him and he wanted me to let you guys know.”
“I mean there’s nothing left to rebuild.”
"Great!" Dean shouted back as Cas turned to go. "Great! Just go! Fly off like you always do! Oh wait, I forgot, you can't fly! Well, have fun moving around like the rest of us pathetic mud monkeys! That's what you dicks call us, right?"
"Yeah right Dean." He said.
Should he go back? He knew Dean likely didn't mean what he had said. But it had hurt
"Cas?" Dean's voice was soft, almost inaudible.
Dean contemplated the words. The guy did have a point.
"What you want me to do Dean?" he asked in a tone that spoke of trouble to come later on.
"The demon who tried to kill me with magic?" Jody asked, remembering well the blind date gone very, very wrong.
Gadreel smirked.
He pulled out his phone, turning it on and staring down at the photo of Dean that he had taken one day when he had been napping in the library. In it he looked calm, young, his mouth turned up in a small smile. Cas, in a confusing moment of sentimentality had snapped a quick photo and saved it as his background. Now, the sight of him, the reminder, just added to the pain that surged within him and he hefted the phone, throwing it and watching it sail through the air and into the wilderness on the side of the road. He continued staring where the phone had fallen long after it had disappeared from sight. He knew exactly where it had landed, he could feel it, like he could feel everything. Every atom in existence. He closed his eyes and stretched his awareness back, back through the door out of which he had stormed a few minutes ago…
"Yeah, and he hasn't managed to break the habit. Even though I can take care of myself, he still insists on going behind my back to protect me."
Castiel shifted to face the hunter.
Dean's eyes fell closed once more.
"Yeah Cas." He answered.
"Shut up."
Dean laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners in a way Castiel found surprisingly alluring.
"The easiest way of doing it?" Cas asked quietly, his tone vitriolic.
Dean shook his head.
"I'm sorry, that's what you
Gadreel's jaw clenched as he pressed the tip of the blade to the former demon's throat.
Dean took off in their direction and nearly mowed down his brother as he tackle hugged him, knocking the carry on out of his hands.
"You let me know if you need me to stop, okay?"
“What I did. What I became.” He looked back at Dean, eyes angry, “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Yes, he was angry. Furious. The fear of Castiel leaving had been haunting him since this whole relationship started. But why did he have to yell like that? And at Cas! As his rage began to dissipate, a horrible, nauseous, creeping sensation began to make its way up his spine and into his belly. What had he done? He eyed the staircase. Should he go after him? Apologize? Beg for forgiveness?
“Excuse me sir.”
This was all her fault. She was the one that wanted to tell Cas in the first place, the one who had blurted out that he was an angel.
Dean held up an accusatory finger, which wavered wildly in front of Sam.
"Dean? Dean!"
"Alright," he said, leading them over to a display of jeans, "we'll start with the basics."
Kevin did not react well to Crowley's presence and it took a few tries for Dean to get a word in edgewise.
"Not on your life." Crowley threw back, brandishing the weapon and pushing Kevin behind him, backing them up against one of the pillars, shielding the prophet. "Who are you? What do you want?"
"And I'll take you to her so long as you promise to let me stay."
"Yeah but I don't want you to put yourself in harms way just to protect me Dean. I never asked you to do that."
Sam was fuming, his breaths coming in short gasps.
"Get a room." he ordered before grabbing Dean's wrist and pulling him with all of his considerable angel strength through the door to room number 7. Dean sent Sam a wide grin before the door slammed shut.
"Why doesn't Sam go with you?" he suggested, gesturing to Dean's brother across the table who, while he no longer looked like a strong wind might knock him over, was still not quite up to par in the health department.
"Did he do anything else?"
"I…" Dean began to speak but trailed off his breaths coming in shorter and shorter gasps.
"What? What brought him back?"
A shadow passed over Castiel's face.
Dean nodded.
"Just you and me now." Dean smiled from across the table. "Let's talk about us. I mean, we got history, yeah?"
"Yeah." She answered.
Dean turned to leave but Crowley stopped him.
Dean blinked.
Tightening the knot and straightening everything, Dean couldn't deny that he liked Cas back in a suit, especially one that fit and brought out his eyes. He cleared his throat and pulled back as he realized that his hands had lingered on the ex-angel's firm chest longer than he'd planned and he looked over to see Sam smirking at him.
"Don't you ever go disappearing on me like that again," he said into the tan cloth of the angel's coat.
did it feel good, but Cas gasped suddenly and not in a nice, sexy way but in an 'I just remembered I have several bruised and broken ribs' way.
He felt eyes on him and glanced over to see Sam frowning at him.
"You saw what I became." he murmured. "You saw the havoc I wrecked." He closed his mouth and swallowed, shaking his head. A wave of misery flowed into Dean.
Dean's expression went serious.
She hissed in anger, her eyes glowing green and, without thinking, Crowley stepped in front of the mother and son, holding his arms out and shielding them with his body. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest; despite the fact that he knew they were safe while in the circle, Crowley couldn't help but be painfully reminded of his own reinstated mortality.
And if his dreams prominently featured brooding blue eyes staring up at him from beneath long dark lashes then so be it.
"Maybe someday, Cas. Maybe someday."
Sam fought the urge to strangle his brother.
Dean was on the ground in a second, grabbing at the angel whose skin had gone pale as a coughing fit hit and would not stop. Dean pulled him up, cradling him against his chest as Cas continued to hack, finally cutting off with a gasp.
"Because I've been there. In that deep dark pit that seems to suck everything away until all that's left is a desire for it to be over."
"What do you mean?"
“Cas?”
Sam's wide eyes met his and his mouth opened and closed a few times without actually making any sound. He swallowed hard and Dean could see tears rising in his hazel eyes.
Once their teeth were brushed and mouths rinsed, Dean smiled and turned to Cas. He brought his hand up to the other man's newly shaven cheeks, running his thumb over the smooth skin and leaning down to press their lips together. They kissed for a few minutes, tongues exploring each other's mouths before Dean trailed off, kissing a line down Cas' jaw and neck to a spot just under Castiel's ear where Dean stopped because Cas fucking
Kevin shook his head.
He squirted a dollop onto his hand before handing the can to Cas and spreading the cream over his five o'clock shadow. Once they were both lathered up, Dean demonstrated the correct way of holding a razor and which direction to shave in. Castiel only nicked himself a few times which Dean was hasty to point out was pretty good for his first time.
Cas sighed at the news.
"I'm not pining."
A buzzing sound interrupted his musing and he looked down to find Dean's cell vibrating as it announced an incoming call.
Dean picked up the phone, glancing at the caller ID but the number was unknown. He pressed the button to accept the call.
Seven years.
Jo smirked and turned back the way she had come.
Sam nodded his agreement.
"Did you go through with it?"
"What is it?"
after Dean had failed to react in recognition when Sam had brought it up.
Kevin stood stock still, staring at the former king of hell.
Dean rolled his eyes and exhaled loudly.
Cas groaned and brought his forehead down lightly on the steering wheel. This was not the first car he had 'borrowed' that had mysteriously stopped working. He knew he ought to know why, he had spent enough time with Dean in the Impala, but he had never really paid much attention to the vehicle apart from the fact that it smelled like Dean and felt like home.
"What did Crowley say?" Castiel asked as he set his bag down and moved over to the crowd.
Cas reached a hand up to cup Dean's sallow cheek.
Sam sighed.
"L've you, Dean." he said almost unintelligibly.
"My dad had some…interesting approaches to parenting." He started to explain.
Sam shook his head and went back to his research, pouring over every book the bunker had on angels in an attempt to gain any information that might help Castiel.
"I thought things were all quiet on the angel front." Dean said as he continued to rub soothing circles into Cas' back. "Even that Buddy Boyle guy is off the air."
"Well why not you son of a bitch!" his hands were shaking where they held his brother's lifeless body.
Crowley moved silently through the halls of the underground bunker back to his room, back to the silence and isolation.
Gabriel pulled back.
, she was boring at parties."
“Thank you for saving me Dean.” Cas said softly
Sam had tried to talk Dean into calling the angel several times, but all that ended up accomplishing was Dean either yelling and breaking things or stalking off in a silent rage and eventually the younger Winchester gave up; if his brother wanted to be pigheaded and stupid, then that was his prerogative. Still, there were times where he found himself wanting to dial Castiel's number or pray to the angel but he always caught himself, knowing that Dean needed to be open and receptive to the idea of making up with his boyfriend before he came face to face with the angel, or he could very well end up burning that bridge once and for all.
"Please, Linda's fine." She took Charlie's hand, "It's lovely to meet you dear."
Castiel gasped in horror and hurried backwards until he hit the wall, his breath quickening and his face screwed up in terror.
"Sam, you take the girls and go after the witch. I'll take Cas to the dungeon and meet up with you.
“I really am happy for you Dean.”
His voice came out low and hoarse and it did things to Dean.
After a good night's sleep, which Sam was assured by Dean a multitude of times would be PG given that the motel was fully booked and the three men were forced to share a room, Jody slung her bag over her uninjured shoulder and turned to the two hunters and the one fallen angel.
“So…do you want to let everyone know about…you know?” Dean shifted awkwardly as he voiced the unspoken question between them.
On the one hand he wanted Castiel back. His Castiel. It was a greedy, selfish want that surged though Dean like a drug. It was what he had wanted, what he had dreamed of, since he’d watched the man lurch into that reservoir. What he’d been praying for as the angel had sunk beneath the water and he’d waited with bated breath for him to reemerge. But as the seconds and then minutes had ticked past, his hopes had faded and when he’d looked down to find that the sodden trench coat had made it’s way back to the shore, borne on the rippled movement of the water, he’d resigned himself to knowing that he’d never get his angel back. It was easier than hoping in vain.
"Thank you Sam." He said in his soft, certain tones, "It is very much appreciated."
"Did dad hit you when I ran away from Flagstaff?"
Cas frowned.
Dean closed his eyes and swallowed before shaking his head, which was apparently a bad idea because he moaned again and dropped his head into his hands.
So he did.
Sam shrugged.
Sam nodded in agreement.
“Of course.”
"All right, little brother." Dean said, patting him on the back awkwardly as Sam refused to let go.
"Hello, Dean." He answered. The crowd erupted into a frenzy of excited chatter before dying down just as quickly to watch the drama unfold.
"Take him to the prison." he ordered, before striding to the elevator and concentrating on Dean, hoping that wherever the portal spat him out, the hunter would be nearby, and that he would be alright.
Dean rolled his eyes.
"Okay." he said, turning and gunning the engine, pulling out of the parking lot and towards the closest motel.
"Well…I mean, the tablet was the word of God, maybe…"
"After that," he continued once Suzy had shushed everyone and gestured for Dean to go on. "I guess sex became a way to prove myself. To prove that…he hadn't broken me; that he didn't control me. But along the way it got…all twisted and it became cold, and…empty. I mean sure it feels great, that moment you know? But afterwards, you just end up feeling lonelier than you did before; like there's this void inside you that can't be filled. I guess, coming here and signing the pledge is a chance for me to start over. So that I can finally let go of what happened and move on and finally be happy."
He looked up at Sam.
The pressure built and built until, without conscious thought or purpose, Cas threw his head back, eyes closing, face contorted in ecstasy as the pleasure came to a climax and his orgasm hit and he lost all control. He was dimly aware of Dean clenching around him as he rode the wave of his own orgasm and Cas forced his gaze down to see him, head thrown back against the pillows, and he watched as Dean let go, allowing raw, primal emotion to show on his face. His eyes cracked open and their eyes met. Cas still held Dean's hand in his own and he squeezed it as their movements slowed and Cas finally pulled out, panting and sagging in the aftermath. He heard a chuckle and Cas looked at Dean, whose face was split into a grin.
"Okay, you're right." he said, patting Cas on the shoulder. "We should get some sleep. Regroup later when we're all rested up."
Dean raised an eyebrow at Sam who blushed and sputtered, before taking over.
Dean frowned.
It was time to talk to the newly human Crowley.
Cas frowned.
Dean sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose when Cas spoke his name and didn't continue, letting the silence between then continue to grow ever more palpable and vast.
"How could you speak about this, us in such a casual manner? Especially after everything you have been through? You can barely stand to let me touch you without breaking down and now it's all 'well, if it solves the case then I guess we'd better get on with it'! Well, you know what?! I don't just 'want to get on with it'!"
"I am well, thank you. Are you fully healed?"
Dean felt a surge of guilt and, with Sam glaring at him, tried to console the guy.
"Thank you." Cas accepted the beverage as he took a seat at the table, Sam settling across from him.
"But if you feel you need to stop, for any reason, you tell me. All right?"
Dean rolled his eyes and gestured to Cas with his head.
Cas' face was impassive as always but his eyes were wide with interest.
"Don't you dare think that there is
Dean nodded.
"Oh, right. It's just, I thought, after last night maybe you wanted to…" he trailed off, face heating.
"Cas was doing something nice for me and I fell apart—" he cut off, his words stolen by the lump in his throat that was growing by the minute.
"Yes." He murmured, shame colouring his words.
"Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh." Sam blabbered. "Shut up. Shut up. Just save your energy, all right? Oh, man. We'll stop the bleeding. We'll…we'll get you a doctor or…or I'll find a spell. You're gonna be okay."
"And has all that waiting been a struggle?"
Only a few more chapters to go and this story will be ending! It's been such a wonderful experience this, my first foray into the Supernatural fandom and thanks to everyone who shared it with me.
Sam wasn’t buying it.
"Oh he's human. Don't worry, I've been feeding him."
"Yeah, proto-marmite or something."
"You came."
"You alright?"
He blinked but did not speak.
Sam had a theory that he’d tested out a while back, a theory that there was something that made people more relaxed, a little happier to be near Cas. “I want to see if it’s just D—“ Sam had started, then stopped himself and said, “I’m just curious. I think there might be something about your angel-ness that makes people happy.” Odd times when they found themselves out in public alone (without Dean, that is), Sam would have Cas go stand at a bus stop where a man was waiting, holding a crying baby, or hover near the counter of a convenience store where the cashier on duty seemed to be having a particularly bad day. And it was true; even without Cas saying anything, after a minute, the baby would calm down, and the man would start to smile a bit, and the cashier would perk up.
This song, on the other hand, seems to hover right in the middle of things. Taylor Swift sings about a love affair that hasn’t really started yet, one that seems to hover just on the brink of either being realized or falling apart before it’s even begun.
, Dean thinks,
. Each call a question.
Dean would put on the song, and he’d think,
Cas removes his hand from Dean’s forehead, then, and looks at it, almost as if it’s something outside himself. Which, maybe it is. Deans’ still not quite sure how the whole “vessel” thing works.
And that’s all that he thinks about ritual, for a while. He shows up in Dean’s hotel a little while later, and they hunt down Raphael, and Cas leaves, because when he’s in the car with Dean, he’s not so sure it’s really God he’s looking for, and it needs to be God he’s looking for. He will find God and he will fix things and he will save the good in the world, Dean being among the good, and once what is good is safe, then maybe he can wonder what comes next.
“I stay alive because this is where you are. And I want to be where you are.”
A few days into one of their road trips, Dean reaches into his glove box, fishes out his worn down copy of
“As many people do,” Cas says. When Dean gives him a look, Cas adds, “Not me, of course. Just a trend I’ve noticed.” Dean raises his eyebrows, as if to say, well, you’re not wrong. “He didn’t succeed, obviously,” Cas adds.
, Cas thinks. All this weight that Dean’s been carrying with him since the day he was born, and Cas doesn’t know how to help him bear the burden. Dean was the one who showed Cas that other stories were possible, that the one he’d been told didn’t have to be the one he stayed in. That there wasn’t one inevitable ending. Dean could do that for Cas, but Dean can’t do that for himself. He has all these stories that he tells himself, all these stories that he can’t get out of. And Cas doesn’t know what to say. Because he doesn’t know how to tell Dean what he really wants to.
Dean’s talked around it before. Around wanting to die. Cas has heard him say that hunters don’t get out of the life, that they die bloody. Cas has seen Dean throw himself into fights not expecting to come out the other side more times than he can count. Raising Dean from Perdition feels like far from the only time Cas has reached out and tried his hardest to bring Dean back from the brink of something that could break him.
“I like it,” Cas tells her. That, he’s sure of.
A preacher’s voice finds its way out of Dean’s speakers.
“There’s a very active online community of beekeepers,” Cas tells him. “Sam showed me how to look up their videos.”
“There is no harm in it,” Cas tells him.
“What the hell?” Dean says. “What’s the big deal? You wanna bless me, it doesn’t take, my brother believes in all this sh—my brother believes, and he’s here, asking to be blessed, and you won’t do it?”
“Obviously,” Dean says, then goes quiet. Cas knows by now that this means there’s something more he wants to say. So he waits. The last song of the album finishes playing, and there’s the click of the tape player, followed by silence.
“Sure,” Dean says. “Came back from the grave.”
“I don’t know,” Cas says. “I don’t know if I can make up for what I did. But you… you let me back anyway.”
“If we finished the job, and there wasn’t another one… would you stay?”
Sliding back into the driver’s seat felt like sliding back into another story. The windshield still shattered from way back in Chicago. Dean would try not to look over at the empty passenger’s seat, waiting for someone to appear. He knew Sam was gone, but Cas—
“You won’t—“ Cas starts, then stops, and tries again. “You, too, are of His power and glory, although it’s—diluted is perhaps the wrong word. It’s
she asks.
“Do you know the story of Lazarus?” Cas says.
In some ways, it was easier, when he could go to Dean whenever he wanted. In some ways, it was harder. In any case, this is different and new and—at some point, he realizes, to his surprise, it’s
Turned out to be a teenage girl he sees it in first. She gets on a bus in Washington D.C. at 4:30, clearly just out of school and a little preoccupied, fiddling with some sort of electronic device attached to earbuds. Glancing around, and seeing the mostly-full seats, she chooses to make her way over to Cas, sitting down next to him without really glancing up, holding her backpack in front of her and staring straight ahead.
“Nebraska,” Dean says.
“A bee hive, I believe they’re called.”
“Stick around,” Dean says, “and if the blessing kicks in, maybe I will.”
. Sam had fallen asleep pretty early into the movie, but Dean, who had wanted to change the channel when it had first started, had become more and more engrossed as the movie went on. The hotel room had been a particularly small one, two beds and no chairs, so Cas had had to sit on Dean’s bed with him, their elbows resting against one another. Cas had wondered if there was something about the angel-human divide that made him particularly aware of that point of connection between them.
Cas nodded.
"I want to make love to you." Dean was surprised he had actually managed to get those words out, but in the moment they had just felt right. "I want a connection. No adios." When Cas still looked uncertain, he continued. "And I want, no, I
Castiel exchanged pleasantries with Kevin and his mother and even Crowley, despite the awkwardness of it. Then again, everyone had been a little awkward around Crowley since he'd been cured. The former demon kept mostly to himself, holed up in his room. Occasionally he would emerge for food or a book but even then he was subdued.
Half an hour later they were finishing up checking their weapons and ready to go.
Cas looked sideways at him, his tongue sticking out. He pulled it back in hesitantly.
"Hmm? Oh, I got in the car, drove to Stanford, found out where you lived, and broke into your apartment in the middle of the night."
Meeting Castiel’s three older brothers had been interesting, and by interesting, Dean meant fucking terrifying.
"Sorry, Cas." Dean said softly, his voice small and shameful.
"Sam."
“I remember you.” The voice was gruffer than Emmanuel’s had been, pulled down by the weight of knowledge and memory. He turned and Castiel’s serious gaze was back on Jimmy Novak’s face.
"Listen to me." Dean murmured. "It's better this way."
"I've just…I've been sleeping so much, I'm sick of it. I just want to be better already."
“Yeah, I’ve ah heard that about…Emmanuel.” He fixed the man with his gaze, “That you can heal people up.”
So? What did you think?
Linda raised her eyebrows, "You can do that?"
Dean looked up, his green eyes full of something that might have been hope and Castiel thought that Dean's emotions were closer to the surface than he'd ever seen them. The expression made the hunter seem somehow much younger. Castiel reached up his hand, caressing Dean's cheek and then pulling the hunter's face down to meet his own in a kiss that managed to express everything Castiel had wanted to say to Dean but hadn't know how. Perhaps it was the same as the way Dean expressed his love through his actions.
"No." he begged, "No. No! NO! NO! NO!"
"Oh, shit I'm so sorry, Sam mentioned that you don't like talking about your past. I'm so sorry Castiel."
Castiel considered it for a moment before nodding.
Dean was clearly having more trouble wrapping his head around the concept of Cas being pop culture savvy.
"I want you!" Cas yelled back.
Cas gaped at her, "You expect me to do this in front of all these people?" He hissed.
Dean frowned and Sam looked fascinated.
Sam's face screwed up in anger.
Dean rolled his eyes and departed without a word.
"I'm sorry, Dean."
?” He practically spat the word out as though it were poison.
"I can still hear them." he said softly.
"What about him?"
"Yeah," Dean agreed. "Anyway, he says he wants to talk to you. You can feel free to tell him to piss off."
"Hey it's okay. Doesn't really matter anyhow, so long as your teeth get cleaned right?"
Dean stared, unable to move past the revelation that Cas was alive. Cas was
Castiel raised his eyebrows.
Castiel nodded, pain shining out from his blue eyes.
"What's going on?" Castiel demanded, sure Gadreel was behind the betrayal until his surroundings coalesced into a familiar sight and Gadreel's panicked voice sounded from the cell next to his.
Jody took in his words and smiled.
Castiel continued to stare at Dean in astonishment.
Dean sighed and swiped angrily at a tear. He wouldn't cry! And he wouldn't go after him or call or pray! Cas was better off without him anyway. After all, he was an angel again. He could go and be with his family. He could reopen heaven and go home and be happy, far away from Dean and the train wreck that was his attempt at a functional, healthy relationship. Hell, now that Cas was an angel again, any sort of relationship between them would probably be forbidden. And besides, who in their right mind would want to be in a relationship with him anyway? It was a miracle they had made it this long what with the panic attacks he still had despite the progress he'd made and all the fucking sobbing he'd been doing.
"Good. So he'll be staying here?"
She turned from the sink and smiled.
Castiel's face shifted from pain to angry resolve.
Cas still looked wary.
"I just don't think it's really worth it to go after Cas."
"Where's your friend?"
Dean stared out at the vastness of the space in front of him and gulped, his pulse quickening as his heart began to pump in fear. What the hell was he doing? He couldn't do this. Killing monsters? Yes. Averting the apocalypse? Yes. Damning his soul to eternal hell in exchange for his brother's life? Yes. But this? This was terrifying.
Dean looked over, sadness shining in his emerald eyes. His sigh was bone weary and he blinked, his eyelids heavy with exhaustion.
The audience chuckled.
He survived thinking he was going crazy seeing the trench coat clad angel everywhere he went.
Cas patted the guy awkwardly, sending an apologetic glance at Dean.
Nothing happened.
He helped the sloshed man up and into the room, settling him on the bed where he fell backwards, splayed out.
"I'm Dean by the way." Dean said, holding his hand out to shake, "Dean Winchester."
"It was something Josiah said to me. Just before he died, he said, 'I look into your eyes... And I don't see an angel staring back at me.'"
Kevin, Cas, Linda, and Crowley were retrieved from the dungeon. Linda giving the former demon a small nod in appreciation of his efforts to keep them protected, an action which stunned Crowley seeing as how he could never have believed the prophet's mother would or could forgive him for what he had done to her. Kevin however, continued to ignore him as per usual and eventually, the now human King of Hell skulked back to his corner of the bunker before anyone else had a chance to thank him for his role in the day's events. It had been enough that Linda had acknowledged him, it gave him hope that maybe he could make a small dent in the mountain of 'Things He Had to Make Up For'.
"What did the doctor say?"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Sam interrupted, holding up a hand, "Spoilers. I haven't read all the books yet."
"You can't promise me that." he said softly. "You don't know. You have no idea."
"Alright. Sam, you go with Dorothy. Find the Tran's and get them to the dungeon-"
"I expect to be maid of honour at your wedding when I get back."
"Maybe what? Maybe God brought you back?" Dean scoffed, "God who's been AWOL for who knows how long?"
"Where'd you end up?
Trigger Warning: This episode contains discussions of rape and suicidal themes
"I loved it." he said, not just talking about the song.
Castiel wished he had a good answer for the hunter who looked so hurt and betrayed.
"Because I love you, Dean."
want to be responsible, he
Cas looked down at the rodent.
He shook Cas' shoulder gently.
"It was what it was. Can't change the past you know?"
"What do you know about the Roman Goddess Vesta?"
"What are you saying, Cas?"
Castiel nodded.
Sam sighed and leaned back against the car. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Dean fidgeting, as though he had more to say. Sam turned his gaze back to his brother.
"Really?"
"The door's closed, Gadreel." Purah answered. "By orders of Metatron."
"So what about the whole 'I like frisky women' thing? Was that real? Or were you just so far inside the closet you were fighting the white witch with Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy?"
He reached a curious hand out and ran a finger along the feather, feeling its otherworldly softness. The limb twitched and a soft grunt sounded from behind Dean. He turned to see Cas grimace in his sleep, his face scrunching up in a manner that was decidedly cute at Dean's touch. His heart swelled at the sight of the sleeping angel lying once again beside him. It was so right that, for a moment, it felt as though he had woken from a nightmare, as though the last few months had been nothing but a bad dream. All was right with the world.
Cas opened his mouth, remembering well what the pizza man had taught him, and moaned at the explosion of pleasure that accompanied Dean's tongue as it delved into his mouth and intertwined with his own.
I'm sorry for the last update. I know it was mean to leave it on such an awful cliffhanger.
An idea occurred to Castiel and he glanced over at Dean, whose green eyes were still open, blank and unseeing.
"Tell you what. When you get your first paycheck, you can treat me to a burger and a slice or two of pie. Then we can call it squared. Sound good?"
"Fuck, Cas." he breathed as his fingers twisted and clutched at the hair in his grasp.
"Yeah."
"We gotta teach you how to shave. Unless you want to keep this."
“Well what do you know?” he said, “I was right.”
"What?" he asked, impatience rife in his tone.
"No." he said curtly, looking back down at the bed.
"I dunno. I tried praying to him but…" He trailed off. "So." He said, clearing his throat and changing gears, "Do you remember anything else from when you were, you know?"
"Oh you know, doin' my time, just like you said. Makin' amends."
Dean nodded. He knew there was nothing else to do. There was no way to contact Cas and he couldn't keep driving around with Sam in the state he was. He started the car and pulled out onto the road, heading for Lebanon, Kansas and hoping that wherever he was, Castiel was doing the same.
"Fine!" he shouted back, calling on his millennia of experience as an angel to steel his expression and hide the pain. "If that's what you want, fine!"
Castiel nodded sympathetically, “Yes, life is so…fragile. I only learned that recently.”
Dean looked thoughtful. It would be nice not having to rely so heavily on pool hustling and credit card fraud anymore.
“Fine, but I know you love them, like you luuuuuve Castiel.”
"Even though Jess ended up dying?" Dean asked.
Gadreel threw one last angry look at Sam before turning to Dean.
Crowley scoffed.
"So, what's the plan?"
Dean looked impressed, "You come up with this?" he asked the young prophet.
And then it was like the second eclipse all over again. When Cas had turned to Dean and apologized, right before the portal had opened and all the souls had been sucked back into Purgatory.
Castiel smiled and nodded.
Breakfast was soon ready and everyone sat down around the table. Castiel was caught up on everything that had happened in the bunker and in turn, Castiel told them all what had happened to him since he fell.
"Brian?" Dean asked. "Really?"
Cas to his credit looked mildly abashed.
Dean stared at it now, stared at the hateful reminder of his former happiness. It was as though the loving faces in that picture were mocking him and he felt his anger rise again.
Cas took in the hunter. Took in his shaking hands and watery eyes and hair that was standing on end from having hands running through it for the better part of a day. He sighed and kissed the man. Hard. Pouring as much love and comfort as he could through the reinstated connection.
The next thing he knew, he was standing in a dark room, moonlight spilling in through a solitary window. A wave of recognition washed over him as he took in the dimly lit surroundings; the dormer window, the carpet, the porcelain angel that sat serenely on a shelf above the crib.
Kevin deflated and sank back against the wall.
“I’m so sorry.” Her tone was sympathetic but there was something in it that told Castiel that she wasn’t just saying it, she truly meant it.
"What the hell is going on?" he asked.
Sam was pressing a cloth to Dean's chest as Dean tried to speak around the blood that was slowly but surely filling his lungs and choking him.
"Sure, you can." Dean answered back, glad Metatron was enough of a stereotypical villain to feel the need to explain himself in long, whiny monologues. It was making stalling for time so that Cas could safely get to the Angel tablet much easier. "So long as your mug is in every Bible and 'What would Metatron do?' is on every bumper."
"Dean, what's going on?" Sam asked.
Claire stared up at Dean with a smile but said nothing. Dean smiled and nodded knowingly.
"Quick thinking, but he won't be gone for long. Come on!"
"It's worse than I thought."
Then the angel started coughing, loudly and deeply. Sam glanced over as the fit continued, the angel's face reddening as he struggled for breath he should not need.
Castiel pointed to the nearest column where an angel-banishing sigil was drying, red blood fading to brown as it flaked off the stone.
"I don't know, because I couldn't control it. I didn't want those feelings and it felt like…my body betraying me you know."
Cas trailed his hand down Dean's back, hesitating slightly before reaching lower and pawing at Dean's firm backside. Dean moaned and Cas looked down, locking eyes with the hunter and sending him a meaningful look.
Cas sniffed as more tears escaped his reddened eyes, he couldn't go there. Not now.
It continued. Days and months and years passing as he watched and felt every moment spent in his mother's presence. Food shopping and trips to the park, his first steps. He watched his mother as she stared in awe at his first laugh, his first words, looking down on him as though he was the most precious thing in the world. And for the first time in so very long, a small part of him actually began to believe it.
Because he needed it to be great. He needed Cas to be all right. Because he didn't think he could take losing another person he cared about. Not this year.
It was one of the memories he usually kept under lock and key in the very back of his mind, buried beneath layers of repressed emotion and borderline alcoholism. But now it surfaced and he tried to hold it back, tried to push it down to where it belonged, lost and forgotten. But it was no use.
"Dean!"
A pretty young woman in a park ranger's uniform stood on the other side of the door.
Charly is pacing the room. Castiel had read her messages but didn't answer. She was tempted to just call but was also pretty sure he wouldn't answer.
[5.12., 18:57] Castiel: I told him not to read everything
[2.2., 11:50] Castiel: Good Luck
[26.12., 12:34] Dean: And I am still twitching
"Do you really?" Castiel smirks and attempts to hug Dean.
Dean leads him outside and shows him the patch. "Now. What flowers do I need to plant so that you can watch bees from the studio?"
Dean comes back downstairs.  "Got the fuzzies, babe?"
"Me too."
Cas snuggles him. Once Dean's class is about to start Cas puts on sweatpants and a t-shirt and goes on a long run, he returns for his shower then goes to work in his painting.
"I... I should go home. Jerking off with Sam in the house feels weird so I haven't really been able to... to finish anything."
Dean snorts and starts laughing loudly at the indignation on the cat's face. "Take that fuzzy."
[21.1., 15:34] Dean: I leave here in 30 min but I am going to mine to get ready. I come and pick you up
[3.12., 21:46] Dean: Shit
Castiel joins him and wraps his arms around his middle
"I could have said no. I didn't know what to expect and I guess I didn't grasp the full scope of your faith."
"Morning. You're gonna be late for class, Babe." Cas says as he gets up.
Dean thanks him and gets dressed for his appointment .
"Yes, we do." Cas agrees.
"Should we have asked Missouri first?"
Cas chuckles. "I love green."
"Around 1. Or i can come to tge shop."
Dean is panting. It feels so much better compared to his own fingers.
"If heaven is filled with your kind,  I don't want it." Charlie tells him as Michael passes her and Dorothy nods.
"Really?"
[31.3., 08:23] Castiel: Good morning Love
[27.1., 15:32] Castiel: I don't understand
"No. It's ok." Dean answers, his face bright red and his voice a few octaves higher.
[4.12., 10:38] Dean: I am so sorry
[22.12., 22:57] Castiel: Yeah
"I like when I'm in charge in bed, but I don't like telling you what to do, bossing you around. It feels like I'm no better than Arthur or Meg."
[15.12., 19:53] Dean: Gonna run to the store quickly
"Morning." Cas mumbles and shuffles away from Dean before going back to sleep.
"How does it look?" Dean asks once Cas is done.
[15.12., 21:43] Dean: It has no front
"Yes, of course."
"What theme? Lazy bedheads?"
[15.2., 10:53] Castiel: Not having wanted such a brutal death for it.
"Yes. Yes I have. You have a boyfriend,  look at his arms."
Cas chuckles. "What's that supposed to mean?"
[2.1., 23:19] Dean: They didn't know
"Mmmmmh!" Cas rubs his belly.
[6.12., 19:05] Dean: Dude
"You're freaking sweet together, doing all that kitchen stuff together, not having to think our look when moving around each other."
[20.1., 10:15] Dean: Ok.
"I'd like that. Please can we talk about what you just said. Because while I most certainly feel very very strongly for you I... I don't think I  can say that yet."
[22.10., 11:48] Dean: Thank you.
"Okay." Cas nods and goes to park his car where Dean said.
"Yes. I hadn't seen you all day."
[3.12., 19:57] Dean: Cause insinuating that is just a fancy way of calling her a whore
[2.12., 21:55] Castiel: I wish I had been that wise at your age
[17.2., 10:40] Gabriel: The married part
Dean collapses and is trying to catch his breath.
[13.12., 14:43] Castiel: Hmmm
John's face turns red in anger and he walks towards Dean with his hands in fists.
[28.1., 08:46] Castiel: Because i woke up alone and am disoriented
"We got the homophobia ... and apparently the money he held back from you guys."
"Dean?"
"I'm sorry."
Shopping stowed away in the trunk he stops at the diner and picks up some breakfast treats before he drives home and unloads the food.
[7.12., 20:36] Dean: And a functioning jaclet
"Is it working?"
"Lazy bitch." Cas mumbles with a fond smile.
They get ready for bed separately and meet back up in Dean's bed. Both are wearing pajamas. Dean smiles shyly at his boyfriend as he climbs into bed and holds the blanket open for Cas to join him.
Dean stretches and groans. "Yeah."
"You're in a terribly good mood, Babe." Cas chuckles and goes to the coffee machine to find his cup already filled. "Oh, you're the best. I love you, Dean."
"You never asked me about Angel." Cas pokes his tongue.
"For guys they have cock gages so you can still shower and pee and keep clean but you can't get hard. They have a lock where the dom keeps the key." Dean says nonchalantly.
[4.3., 11:25] Castiel: And there's still Gabe and Donna, right?
[26.12., 12:20] Castiel: Everything Dean
Cas moves with him and keeps kissing his neck.
" uhm... maybe in the morning?"
"I am happy. I need you to understand that I am happy. " He kisses Cas after every word. "I love you and I am happy with you and sex is amazing but I love you more than sex."
[6.12., 22:47] Castiel: I don't let Lucifer in the room when i wear lace. It is too delicate
Dean smiles and thanks her.
Cas moves so he can comply and takes off his pants. Dean kicks off his own and wraps Cas in his legs again. He moans at the contact and runs his hands over Cas back and ass.
Castiel nods. "Yeah, that sounds okay."
Cas chuckles. "You're awesome." He affectionately runs his fingers through Dean's hair. "You look so pretty down there."
Accountant check
[26.12., 11:13] Dean: But it feels so.good cas
[17.2., 10:55] Castiel: 🤣
[15.12., 11:00] Dean: Rufus doesnt have friends
[23.3., 15:32] Castiel: Thank you.
"Yes! Oh fuck, Dean. Yes."
"No, that last popcorn kernel was..." Cas tells Dean.
"Good. " Dean smiles and feeds a grape to Cas.
[12.1., 08:29] Castiel: Hmmm
"Please?"
[5.2., 06:41] Castiel: Did you sleep well?
Cas grins. "Pretty, huh?"
Cas closes his eyes again and snuggles closer, falling into a half awake, half sleeping state with a smile on his face.
"Ok Angel where do we go for your car?"
[25.12., 11:59] Dean: My poor lazy puppers
[4.2., 07:48] Dean: They stopped to help at a car accident
[22.1., 16:54] Castiel: When do you want me latest?
"Of course." Cas assures.
" Yeah... next time. " Dean stops." Cas?"
'Bee successful,
[6.12., 22:46] Castiel: No
[13.12., 17:19] Castiel: A fear boner???
Cas lays his arms around him beneath the apron. "Much better."
"I did not abandon you. I told you where I am. Anyways. That's not the news. What do we make for dinner?"
"Take mine." Cas offers.
[16.2., 19:54] Charlie: So he does model
[2.12., 10:41] hot stuff: My cat.
[4.12., 18:39] Castiel: I'm glad you liked the nutty salad
"So, those are last years . I have several more."
Deans hands are shaking but he slowly moves from his nipples to his Dick. He is so hard it almost hurts.
"Hey kitty. " He greets Lucifer as the cat walks up to him and not Cas when they come inside.
[7.12., 21:40] Castiel: Doesn't have to be over
[23.1., 10:12] Dean: Turn it down
"Guilty. Don't judge me. I like something nice to look at after the last few hours."
"I know that now."
[2.12., 11:12] Dean: Dont want to get it addicted
Cas is already in pajamas and in bed though he had taken the liberty of a hot shower.
Sightseeing is on their list for the next day and they take silly photos with the towns sign as well as every other one on their trip. Athens, Venice, Rome,  Berlin everywhere a night or 2 in a motel and tasting their way through greasy diners.
"Well, not go to church every Sunday important, but important, yes."
"You come up with very weird names." Dean shoots back.
[28.1., 12:40] Anael: Them not talking dis
"I don't think my ass can take any more then your finger.today. I'm sorry." Dean whines and throws his head back to give Castiel more space to work with.
Claire sets the table while Dean and Cas feed their pets and Gabriel and Donna shower and change.
[4.12., 19:41] Dean: My father is more of a foe
Deans classes go by fast and sooner then he is ready for, he is back at work, elbow deep in yet another system error on yet another soccer mom car that just doesn't make sense.
"What?"
Dean falls back into the pillows. "This nest is comfortable, you are warm. I had no chance."
[6.12., 19:04] Castiel: Gabriel!
Dean smiles. "I am at your Service. What do you want me to do?"
The three sit in silence for a few minutes while eating. After they finish, Sam takes the dishes back inside and wishes them a good night.
[3.2., 10:00] Dean: I don't do relationships
[31.3., 22:09] Castiel: You're more controlled than me
"No. No No No No No. No! Did I hit you? "
[26.5., 21:35] Castiel: Are they doing okay?
"Dean, I should buy your dog a bed."
[4.12., 21:05] Dean: Then whats got you in such a downwards spiral
Dean introduces him. "Now that the one with the wallet is here, I'll go and change into some matching shoes."
[26.12., 14:53] Dean: On my way
"One more day and then it's finally the weekend." Dean sighs. "I want to build a nest and watch the Harry Potter movies with you please."
[3.2., 09:08] Benny: I could ask my boyfriend to help us too
Dean puts on sweatpants and goes to the kitchen. He whips up a quick casserole with the vegetables and meat he found and sets some aside for Sam before taking Cas and himself a plate to the studio.
Dean smiles. "Flirt back and see what she wants? Plus I'd love to see you flirt."
[28.1., 12:47] Castiel: Yes
[26.12., 12:16] Castiel: Yes
Dean mouths a thank you and goes back to taking notes.
"Need help with dinner?"
"So you staying home does not mean biology class before coffee?"
[6.12., 13:26] Dean: Shower time!
[27.5., 15:23] Castiel: See you soon. Can't wait.
[4.2., 10:16] Dean: Benny wants to order art
[2.12., 12:11] Dean: Meh, why not
Dean turns him around and grabs his face gently.
[19.1., 14:04] Castiel: Okay.
"What do you mean? I am not funny enough for you?"
[4.12., 22:04] Dean: Don't let your brother's negativity get you down
[25.12., 00:21] Castiel: I will show you my lace
"I like this. Afterglow with you." Dean smiles. "Sorry I threw you in that with no warning."
"Nice."
"Enjoy away. '' Dean smiles and wraps his legs around Cas waist.
[13.12., 18:29] Castiel: You, lounging in only your panties
"Her and me... we will be fine. Just need some time to cool down.  How was your day? Better I hope."
He looks at Garth. "Don't ever bring shit from tonight up at work. Ever!"
"Seriously? It takes weeks, just one way."
[6.12., 22:09] Castiel: I just thought you should know I dont like that
"Dean." Cas says softly.
[7.12., 14:07] Castiel: You're grown up, you do not have to listen to him and especially not if he's just in your head
Dean rolls over Cas, kisses his cheek and climbs out of bed.
Dean and Cas walk out hand in hand to the car.
"Awwwe, poor boy is traumatized, huh?"
[6.12., 22:46] Dean: Cat
Dr. Mills nods and writes down more things. "Gentleman would you be OK with me requesting your files from your therapist so I can get a good background picture?"
[6.12., 22:36] Dean: Do you want me to come in your mouth
He takes the fruit gently and licks Cas fingertips clean.
[2.1., 20:41] Gabriel: 100 bucks
[4.2., 13:42] Castiel: 😤
"Sorry." He grins.
[18.3., 09:08] Charlie: Nope. I fed him coffee. He's actually smiling
"Alright.I'd love some tea."
"I love you Angel."
Cas pets his head lovingly.
[3.12., 21:46] Dean: Did I missunderstand
Cas gets out of bed and helps Dean up.
[30.3., 22:25] Dean: I don't want to go to bed
"Good."
The pillow is cold already so Cas must be gone for a while already. Dean pouts for a minute but gets up to shower. The coffee is ready downstairs and a plate with cut fruits and vegetables.
"Your what now?" John asks.
[26.12., 14:33] Dean: How can you run after coming?
Cas watches Dean closely. "And how did you imagine it?"
[3.3., 15:47] Dean: My diet
Cas knocks on the door before entering the bedroom. "Breakfast is ready." He says low as he brings in a plate with two halves of a bagel, one with cream cheese and jam, one with PBJ, and one bagel sandwich.
Dean shrugs. "We will see. " and mumbled he adds quietly. "Maybe a honeymoon trip."
"I can draw you for an hour, that's okay."
Dean climbs off Cas and pulls him up. They walk upstairs together, after making sure the fuzzies have everything they need, and after getting ready they lay in bed together.
[29.1., 09:56] Dean: Bdsm section
"Yeah. I bet you would."
"Yes, but it was worth it."
"Awesome! Wanna help me?"
[26.12., 15:27] Dean: You can always stop me if you are uncomfortable
"Fuck!" Cas sits up fast enough to see stars.
[13.12., 17:40] Dean : Oh
[8.12., 10:38] Castiel: I'm in therapy, yes.
[26.12., 11:49] Dean: Do you like rimming?
Dean wakes up early and is confused for a minute as to where he is.
Dean is in a half asleep state when he hears a car park in front of his house but it fits perfectly into his dream and he snuggles closer to the warm body beneath him.
"That was the most special thing anyone has ever done for me."
[23.3., 17:53] Castiel: Hey Charlie! I have completed my first official paid for order.
Dean shakes his head.
"I want to suck your cock, please. Swallow you down.'
"You don't. "
"We're not engaged. There's no cold feet to have."
Dean may have been speeding Just a little bit but he makes it home in record time.
"Yeah. See, I have this hot guy in my bed. Naked."
[4.12., 09:53] Dean: I jerked it to plenty of lebians that I didn't know personally
Dean snorts. " Nice. I bet she liked that. "
Gabriel stares at Donna. "Honey? "
[15.12., 21:07] Dean: Yelling
Dean sits down on the floor next to Castiel and pets his dog. "So, we established that we are not breaking up. What was up today? Where was your head?"
"Just before 6. But I brought coffee."
"Are you a good boy? Can you be quiet without your pillow?" Cas asks as he pulls out his fingers and  lubes up his dick.
" Hmmm. I get that." Dean answers.
[6.12., 20:43] Dean: Yes
"Hmmmm. True. Not to ignore your opinion but I am gonna talk to Missouri about that too. See what she has to say."
"I've told you many times that your art is too good to be just a hobby."Gabe says, strangely serious for once. "I agree with Dean that you should do it full time but I understand your need for financial security and freedom. I say take the plunge and go part time at the firm. Keep the shop hours and make beautiful things. And for the love of God let me start paying you for your work for me."
[6.12., 20:20] Dean: I like how yours is more conservative
Dean chuckles. He presses a chaste kiss to Cas hip and takes his socks off. Dean stands back up and looks at Castiel.  "Hi! Thank you.  For letting me do this. "
[8.12., 12:25] Dean: I dont wanna think of Kevin likenthat
"Mhm. My spot." Cas mumbles.
[5.12., 17:30] Dean: It was still unlocked
[29.1., 11:17] Castiel: Ooooh
[4.12., 19:38] Dean: Why would I need to know how to come out of the cliset
[26.5., 21:35] Dean: Super snuggly but doing OK. I don't think they like you gone
[23.2., 09:18] Castiel: Though.... i may not be able to paint in bed, but i could draw and sketch there 😅
[16.2., 19:48] Castiel: What are you getting at?
"Can I keep them this weekend? We are having lunch at Jack's tomorrow. Claire would love the puppy to come."
[12.5., 11:29] Castiel: Oh no! You left a note and i didn't even find it. Sorry.
[6.12., 22:27] Dean: Manage the top
[5.12., 22:16] Castiel: He never said he didn't like you
Dean kisses him sweetly and leaves towards his car. "I text you once I am home." He promises.
" You gave me skin. I am gonna touch it. Now hold still please. "
He slips out to start the coffee maker and for a quick stop in the bathroom to freshen up. When he is done, he grabs 2 cups of coffee and sneaks back into the bedroom. Cas' coffee he puts on his nightstand and his own on his side.
"You stood up for me and Sam. And you punched my father." Dean giggles.
Dean huffs and let's go to undress quickly. He stands naked in the bedroom, waiting for Cas to finish up.
"That's great." Cas kisses Dean's thighs.
[26.12., 12:30] Dean: The plug is amazing
[7.1., 14:00] Castiel: No!
"I know."
[6.12., 15:58] Dean: What a look
Cas flops onto the bed and looks at Dean's laptop. "Okay, it does that because this did this." He explains Dean everything patiently and points out the individual steps.
[22.12., 23:14] Dean: Odd dude that larry
"Okay." Cas nods.
"I didn't think he'd react like that." Gabr points out.
[6.12., 15:59] Dean: Why is that in the college archives
[8.1., 14:25] Dean: Going to head to the one we went to the other time. Pretty far out of your way
"I just can't think straight, " he giggles at the joke " with your hands in my hair and on my nipples."
Dean moves his hand to Castiel's hip and pulls him tighter to his groin.
"So, um... what are you into?"
"Yes, you did very good."
"Are you okay?"
[31.3., 11:27] Castiel: Hmmmmm
"Oh god. What did I say?"
"In that case it'd be just as bad if I stayed at yours."
"I am trying. Work with me here." Dean laughs and starts kissing Castiel's neck.
"Morning Dean. I checked the security cameras this morning. Turns out I am not good with technology.  I must have pressed a wrong button and accidentally deleted yesterday's footage." He winks and leaves. Dean stares after him.
[26.12., 11:31] Dean: Im so full
"Would you ike to keep me warm while I sketch?"
"Do you.. can I " Dean stammers between kissing.
Cas looks at what Dean's showing him. "Hmmmm... no look, it does." Cas explains it as best as he can.
[23.2., 13:18] Castiel: 🙃
Dean presents his neck. "Go for it. I like that possessive side of you."
Yes. Thank you."
[1.4., 14:37] Castiel: What are you planning?
"Yes. Want me to make you feench toast with bacon?"
[26.12., 12:32] Dean: Im to sensitive
"Yeah. Laters."
[4.12., 10:34] Dean: You're no fun
Dean makes them sandwiches as promised and let's Santana out into the backyard, hiding behind the door so Castiel's neighbours don't see him naked.
Santana leaps onto them and starts licking Dean's face.
"Really?"
"Hey babe!" Dean yells into the kitchen. "What do you wanna watch?"
[26.12., 20:24] Dean: Dont
[31.3., 11:42] Dean: ☺️
"Okay"
"We went to therapy and made plans for Sam's future. Adulted . What plans do you have for me?" Dean grins. "Are you staying after all?"
"I'm in my thirties, Dean." Cas shrugs. "Do you have any idea how many weird looks I've gotten at the office in my twenties?"
[26.12., 17:47] Castiel: Yes
"I am really happy you came." Sam smiles brightly.
[15.12., 23:01] Dean: And I leave dishes out
Dean nods. "Yes. Tomorrow. " it's late. Let's go to bed?"
Deans cock fills out a little but doesn't get hard. He hums anyways and runs his hands through Cas hair. "This feels nice."
"I thought on Saturday so we could all go together, so Dorothy and you wouldn't be at work."
"Feels wrong. Defiling the younger brother." Dean laughs.
"No, i should get to work. I have orders to fulfill."
"No. I want to relax some."
"Hmmm. Am I getting spoiled this morning?"
"I will. Thanks again. Sorry I lashed out yesterday."
"He'll have more questions... just tell him to cut it out if it gets too personal."
Cas smiles. "Just Food blessing, then you're free."
[25.12., 00:29] Castiel: When do you want me to be there
Castiel moves his hips gently, keeping an eye on Dean to make sure he is fine.
They finish up dinner and Castiel covers the bill. On their way home, Dean asks:" So, when would you like to move in? Sam graduates in 2 weeks."
"Yes. Yes it is." Dean sighs and slides down further on the couch, wiggling between Cas and the couch.
[5.1., 16:09] Castiel: Awww
Cas whines and arches as if in surprise. "Yes. I missed this. You're so good."
[13.12., 18:49] Dean : Doormat
[27.1., 22:07] Dean: I don't want sam to feel bad for liking something
"Sounds good. We can help too. "
[8.12., 21:46] Castiel: You know, things would be easier if I had your address
"True." Cas chuckles.
"Uh. Alright." Cas nods.
[7.12., 21:14] Castiel: We always had angels
"Well, not SM." Dean says.  "We don't do pain. More like the dom and sub roles. I like not being in charge..."
"I do have medication, yes. And my therapist already got me another prescription the other day."
"Anything Dean. God. I  didn't think it'd be you making me fall apart this morning..."
[5.12., 13:26] Castiel: 4
Dean calls the clinic while he makes breakfast,  to see if they have space for all for of them and after getting a solid yes, he has Castiel call Gabe to ask permission.
Cas giggles and moves his hips.
After dinner and showers they snuggle up in bed.
"You promise? "
Cas takes Dean's cock and strokes him.
"You are asking me for a home made porno for you?"
Cas moves his hips with purpose,  slotting their cocks together.
They get in the car and head towards Cas house. "I got the fur babies from my place and set up a little nest for us. I thought cuddles would be a good way to finish the day. I got you your art stuff as well. I hope I grabbed the right stuff."
"Cas ain't bi either. I think  I might be but jury is still out on that, but I don't think debates on sexual orientations are on tonight's agenda." Dean says with finality in his voice while looking at Dorothy. They'd clashed before about their different views on some things and he didn't want to ruin tonight by  getting into it with her again. She's a sweet girl but despite being gay herself, some of her views are outdated at best, downright bi or pan phobic at worst.
[6.12., 15:27] Dean: Sure
"Hmmm? What do mean?"
Dean grins. "That wasn't a no, don't bother trying." He says and digs his fingers into Castiel's ribs.
"You hadn't meant to keep it all day and now you... just wow." Dean blushes.
"Gesundheit. But sounds good."
"I am sorry for waking you up this early but I wanted this to be the first thing you saw on your birthday."
"Ok." Dean nods and steps back under the water to rinse of.
[7.12., 19:30] Dean: And my food arrived
[26.12., 10:01] Dean: Brb
In the office, Cas sets the alarm on his phone when he sees the workload on his desk to make sure he himself doesn't work too long either.
[3.12., 13:17] Dean: Exactly. Whats the point of turning your zoom zoom water into a liquid candy
"Anything. You choose... my boy."
"Only reason I do that."
[5.12., 22:35] Dean: 😚
"Charlie, would you send me the link please? I'd love to show my wife Cas' art."
"Oh, I  missed that."
[8.12., 12:58] Castiel: I feel a little bit drained after dumping all my shit on you. Which I'm still sorry for.
[7.1., 13:57] Castiel: Dean?
[3.12., 19:19] Dean: ?
"Good night, Freckles."
"Bye." Dean hands up and opens the door.
[24.5., 18:21] Dean: Meat
[26.12., 12:49] Dean: I'm not touching anything
[5.12., 21:30] Dean: Both i guess
[27.1., 16:18] Dean: Thank you so much. Now we just need to buy some more sheets... or I give him the scratchy ones.
Dean pets over Cas arms. "I like kissing and making out with you. And I don't wanna mess up tonight by ... you... making a mess."
Cas pouts.
[1.2., 09:52] Castiel: How?
[3.3., 14:51] Castiel: Oh, I'd love that
"Let's go home and eat dessert for dinner."
[8.1., 16:04] Dean: Food
Castiel smiles happily as he tries to make as little sound while cooking as possible so he can hear Dean sing.
"Met anyone interested in your art?"
[7.12., 21:17] Dean: What ever will she choose
"No. I'm not going to leave you al... one."
[13.12., 15:42] Dean : How's the baking coming
Cas takes the shirt off Dean.
Cas nods.
"Maybe but you didn't show it until after he left."
[26.5., 19:57] Dean: Out already?
They cook together and goof around like idiots.
[15.12., 09:50] Dean: Me too
"I'll give you details as soon as I have some.,
"You've said you wanted to feel it all day." Cas defends himself nonetheless.
[25.2., 11:06] Dean: Uhm... Cas?
"No... not too much, sir." Dean breathes out.
[5.12., 19:22] Castiel: Bi-curious is... well it...
[13.12., 19:43] Castiel: What are doing?
Sam shows her. "Thanks for that too, by the way."
Deans mind is slightly fuzzy and he's enjoying the body heat Castiel gives off. It takes him a minute to register what Cas said.
[3.12., 19:36] Dean: Man where sounds harsh
"Fuck!" Dean whines and pushes his hips up, chasing Cas mouth.
Dean stops talking and just looks at Cas.
"Nothing. It fell off. When it hopped away."
[22.1., 09:27] Castiel: He's amazing
Jack is confused. "Why therapy Sammy?"
"Shower?" Dean asks.
[3.12., 20:40] Dean: No
[6.12., 14:14] Dean: And no she hasnt
[2.1., 22:31] Castiel: It's not a western, Babe
[18.3., 14:15] Castiel: I'll try call him
[4.12., 12:22] Castiel: Because male bodies are hot
"Ok. I am sorry I didn't listen and I am sorry for pressuring you. I didn't think me begging for that would go out of hand like that. I'll be good and listen if you still want to play."
[15.12., 21:57] Castiel: Oh?
[4.12., 09:55] Castiel: That does not mean I jerked off.
[22.1., 11:40] Dean: Ok
[12.1., 08:56] Dean: Really?
"Oh? I'd like to see that, to get a better idea. We could watch it together." He adds. "Oooh, oh there's silicone ones too. They look nicer, sexier."
Dean snorts. "Same."
They wrap up the night and head to bed.
[2.12., 21:10] Dean: Yeah. Been there done that. No thank you.
Dean eyes the beer. "I am not drinking tonight but if you guys want to, go for it. I'll have you guys sleep on the couch then."
"Take out. Where do we go?"
"I don't want this to move anywhere but maybe the bed for cuddles and kisses."
Dean hugs Castiel. "Yours"
"It's a mechanics baptism." He smiles and hands him an old towel.
"So what?" Cas asks, actually interested not understanding the connection
Dean nods. "Good. I am happy today went well and better than you thought. I was worried."
[6.12., 13:28] Dean: Enjoy
Cas smiles and bites harder.
[19.1., 16:19] Dean: He
"Yes! Oh fuck, harder."
"No, just prints, but still!"
[27.12., 20:28] Castiel: Yes.
"Oh you are  I just can't do anything about it yet." Sam grins.
[6.12., 00:45] Dean: Or i may be on kink info sites because I am a bit freaked out about the bi thing and want distraction... I need more data
"Yeah. Moved by everyone's support."
"Yeah? Fort worthy, as I said. Salty or sweet?"
[28.1., 10:54] Castiel: I am so sorry I almost broke your marriage. I... oh God Donna i am so sorry
"What jokes?" Castiel asks and leans down to kiss Dean before he can answer.
Dean sets the temperature and steps out of his clothes. The pants need laundry desperately. He takes off his shirt and sees a few Crescent shaped bruises on his biceps. He smiles at Castiel in the mirror and pokes them to see if they hurt. "A little tender but I should be fine by the weekend. How's your shoulder?"
Dean and Dorothy have a pleasant buzz going and are giggling about something only they understand when Cas and Charlie come back inside hands full with food.
[15.12., 21:44] Dean: I guess you wouldn't have to take them of
[13.12., 18:09] Dean : Our conversation has been very much leading into sexting territory but I am not even sure if you would instigate something like that
"I'm not a damsel in distress." Dean pouts but stops wiggling.
"Okay."
He grabs  Cas hand and kisses him.
[22.1., 16:56] Castiel: She's helping me
[13.12., 14:38] Castiel: Really? Pie counts?
[2.1., 22:52] Dean: Oh god
[23.12., 01:09] Dean: I'll finish my beer and then im out too
"We have a few more hours till everyone arrives. What else do we need to do? I know you went shopping, but, anything else we might need?"
"See. That's one for the homework. Cuddle whore."
[16.2., 19:08] Charlie: Yeah.
[13.12., 19:17] Castiel: But i could smear some on your lips.
[1.2., 10:25] Castiel: We'll see how he is.
[8.12., 13:44] Dean: I am sorry. I seem to keep running into more and more work today
Castiel looks at him, a tiny bit of shock painted on his face.
[15.12., 17:37] Dean: I can smell the freedom
[13.12., 08:45] Dean : You don't bother me
[5.12., 14:40] Castiel: No, Jack was fine. He was very interested.
"He will be happy to show you. I'm surprised he hasn't yet." Castuel frowns.
"That's OK." Dean opens the door wide and stands in the door way looking in to his house. "They didn't leave mess. That's good I guess. Ready to go inside."
"I didn't think I'd see you." Dean smiles. " I hope you didn't come here to ask for hints?  Cause my lips are sealed."
[26.12., 15:21] Dean: I am looking at massage oil.
"Ok, may I suggest doing homework in the kitchen next time? Please."
Castiel freezes and looks at Dean. "I'm sorry."
[3.2., 14:48] Dean: Why?
“You have to use a computer,” she says, in a tone of voice that makes it clear she doubts doing so would be within his capabilities. Well, it’s not an altogether inaccurate assessment of him. He sighs. “How do you usually listen to music?” she asks him.
“Okay?” Cas says.
It’s never a very long prayer. Always something that can be folded into the song, just a note scribbled in the margins of a story. Nothing all his own, just a reworking of someone else’s idea. It’s safer, that way.
“No, he wanted to kill me.”
“Sometimes, yes, the effects are more readily apparent than others,” Cas concedes.
“Where would we go?”
“What?” Dean tries to put as much
at least, in the room. That same longing as he felt in the empty church, diminished and magnified, all at once. But he doesn’t know what about the ritual is causing it. The standing, the kneeling—it’s all so foreign to him, but maybe that’s just it. Angels don’t occupy space in the same way humans do. Angels are beings of light and word, waves and particles all at once, occupying more than one space and none. Humans, on the other hand, are very much
But after Sam lit the candle, all he did was place it among the many others already burning, and then he knelt, almost apologetically, and closed his eyes. There was a long silence in which he said nothing and Cas did not move, and then he got up, and smiled at Cas in that way he had that meant he thought someone in the room might get mad, and they walked back out of the church.
“There are degrees of observation which he affords each of us in different instances.”
“You’re not—you’re an angel. How are you not sure?”
he was singing about, his own life wrapped up somewhere in all these others.
But Cas doesn’t come back. So Dean listens to the tape, and he listens to the radio, and he watches the open road, and he thinks,
A few weeks after he rebels, Cas goes to church for the first time. Sneaks in the back while a few old ladies give him a distrusting look and one smiles kindly. You’d think he’d have been to one before, but churches are, for the most part, out of the purview of angels. Angels are there for the odd hours, for messages that can’t get wired through directly for whatever reason. Churches, on the other hand, are (supposedly) direct lines to God. Well, if you go through the priest, that is. Still—no need of angels. Churches are places where God’s most beloved creations speak Heavenward and get through, or at least that's how the story goes.
“Well, what is it?”
This time, Dean feels something, almost like an egg being cracked over his head, the yolk running down. Dean used to do this chant, sometimes, when he was a kid—it was a schoolyard thing, more for girls, and he can’t even remember who it was that taught it to him. But he and Sammy would do this chant:
, Cas had said, trying to be helpful. Dean had shown him so much about human culture. Cas didn’t like to talk about Heaven, as much—he found that he was suddenly trying to explain how it all worked to himself, half the time, let alone letting anyone else in on it—but if Dean was asking, he wanted to be able to answer, to pay him back at least a little for everything he’d taught Cas. But Cas must have said the wrong thing, because Dean went quiet, after that. So Cas had sat and watched in silence as the man decided he wanted to live again, after all, because an angel showed him how much he’d really done, how he’d saved people, how he’d mattered, the whole time, more than he knew.
, so much, but maybe there’s--there’s something else Cas could tune into. Maybe Dean could show him how. And maybe it could be a song. The feeling you get when you listen to a really good song--the emotion is almost physical. You can almost feel it under your fingertips, where you’re holding the wheel. You get the lyrics like an itch in your teeth. Maybe if Cas came back, and Dean played him the right song, he could explain about--something. Playing this song for Cas, out here at night, maybe that would be as close to an answer as Dean could give him to that question.
Cas tries not to let himself hope too much, though. In any case, he doesn’t mention it next time he sees Dean.
an angel.
It’s not Dean’s first time being touched by an angel—by this angel in particular. The scar on his shoulder is proof enough of that. But it’s his first time he can remember. It’s his first time while on earth.
ritual, his space to occupy. It feels, again, like the open road, like a step to somewhere else.
Sam gave Cas that same guilty look. “I don’t know,” he said. “You get it, right? You know Dean doesn’t like all… this, but you’re looking for God, aren’t you?”
Dean so easily, now. He’s carved a ward against angels into Dean, which means a ward against himself, etched right there into Dean’s rib to keep him safe. So Cas does what he’s never had to do before. He calls Dean.
You’d mime it out, what you were saying, as you were saying it. The egg and the knife and the spiders. And Dean would always swear to himself that he really felt it, though he never gave Sam the satisfaction of admitting it. This blessing feels like that, as if Cas’ words have manifested—not a thing itself, but a ghost of a thing. Something not quite solid enough to be sure whether it’s really there, or if you’re just wishing it into being.
“The me I saw in the dream wasn’t just me. I was a demon. I was a demon, and I told myself that’s what I was gonna become. That’s what hell would make me. I told myself that I was… that I was daddy’s blunt little instrument.” He pauses, then continues, “I didn’t realize till then how much I believed that was true, you know? My dad told me he was raising us to save people, but really, he just taught me how to kill. Why wouldn’t… I mean, how could that demon
“On tapes,” he tells her. “In the car.”
“It’s not every day I bless someone,” Cas says sternly.
So why did it feel wrong? Often, sitting there in bed at night, with Lisa breathing beside him, Dean expected her to wake up, turn to face him, and to scream as though she’d found a stranger in her bed. It felt like watching someone else’s life. That was it—that was it exactly. It felt like in the movies. Not like he’d gotten a happy ending, but like he was still sitting there in the dark, watching someone else fit right on in here.
He looks down at it. Not so dissimilar to a cell phone. He realizes he may have seen Sam with one of these eye pods, furtively listening when Dean wasn’t around. After a while of fidgeting with this one here, looking for names he recognizes, he says, “I don’t see any Led Zeppelin on here.”
Dean smiles. “You’ll have to show me sometime.” He turns the car back on, looks over his shoulder. No one’s coming. He pulls the car back onto the road. Nothing’s changed, really. Cas didn’t solve it. He didn’t make it better. Maybe it can’t be fixed. But Cas wants Dean to stay. Cas wants to stay. So Dean’s feeling like he just might stick around.
“Normally, no,” Dean says. “But there was this one guy… Jeremy Snow. He had this root, he took it, and he could get inside your head.”
“You’re just telling me you don’t know exactly what will come of it.”
Suddenly Sam, who has been watching the unfolding conversation intently, speaks up. “Let him do it, Dean.”
He calls Dean all the time. He calls Dean to ask where he is, so that he can come to him. He calls Dean to ask him to wait for him, to ask him what he’s found, to hear his voice and know he’s still out there, now that he can’t reach for him any other way. At first, it’s a cell phone he calls on, but he can’t keep track of trying to charge it, and he can’t keep track of the minutes, and so, more often than not, he ends up looking for a payphone. Dean explains to him about payphones one time after Cas is out of touch for a few days. “I need to be able to reach you, man,” Dean says. “What if something happens? It’s only a few quarters, if you make it quick.”
Dean braces himself for Cas to step forward, then. But Cas doesn’t. He stays where he is, hand still outstretched, and Dean realizes that Cas is waiting for Dean to come to him.
“You? No,” Cas says.
“I have my reasons, reasons which I’m not sure are wise to divulge. Not yet. I’m not sure they’re something you’d be receptive to hearing.”
“You know I can hear you wherever you are,” Cas had asked.
“As I said earlier, you humans are so much more—
it will? Or you—“
It’s just that, well, angels. Dean wonders if maybe they really are like radio waves. Maybe there isn’t
“I—alright,” Dean says. “What’s the harm in it?”
“What do you want me to call him?” Dean says. Before Sam can answer, he continues, “Anyway, my point is, I don’t think I’ve been living up to his standards. How do I know this blessing won’t just ‘zap’ me into ashes?”
“Yeah, well, it’s not every day I go around teaching people—angels—schoolyard chants. So I guess that makes us even.”
. Dean finds, embarrassingly, that he’s thinking of his mother, how she’d reach out and feel his forehead when he was sick, try to see if he was running a temperature. He wonders how his skin feels to Cas—hot, or cold, or like nothing at all?
But this is the first time Dean’s admitted that the impulse is there in him, that there’s something that drives him to the edge and makes him want to step off.
than us. It’s like trying—I’m siphoning quite a lot through this vessel. I’m not quite used to it yet.”
Seeing the way Sam’s looking at him—how Sam hasn’t really stopped looking at him, ever since he got back—Dean doesn’t say no to Cas outright. Instead, he asks, “What is—is it like some sot of protective spell, then?”
Dean would drive until he reached the highway, and then he’d reach into the glove box. And the tape he found himself reaching for, more often than not, was
. The way he sings, it’s not clear if there’s actually even a real state trooper he’s talking to, if there’s just one on his tail, or if the state trooper is some imagined figure, some impending sense of dread that surely
Or maybe the movement is secondary, pretext to linger in this space, crowded together to reach out for something they can’t say out loud. Crossing their hearts as they kneel, crossing their hearts as they rise.
“Do you think you can?” Dean says. “Do you think you can fix it? Is that why you’re still here?”
“There’s… there’s still always gonna be another job,” Dean says. “I can’t walk away.”
“You aren’t the first person I saw in a dream, you know,” Dean says, looking out at the road.
For most of the album, Dean and Cas don’t talk. Dean has to stop himself from looking over at Cas when Bruce sings,
“Is that a threat?”
Sam, at this point clearly fed up with Dean, adds, “Or a pillar of salt?”
But Dean doesn’t stop trying. He remembers Heaven. He knows it must be different for the angels, different than how he saw it. But he remembers what Cas said to him.
fix it. He would make it so they could all be safe, and together, so that he could ride next to Dean and have Dean know he was there, nothing more to hide. But until then, if Cas couldn’t have Dean, at least he could have music.
“Not right now,” Sam said. “I just wanted to light a candle, you know. On the altar.”
Cas gives Dean a more guarded look, then, almost as if the question hurts him. “I have no doubt that it would be within his will for me to bless you.”
“I hope you don’t mind me cutting out the middleman on this one,” Sam said. “It’s not—you know, I’m not asking for something you can help with, this time.”
“What do you mean?” Cas asks.
, Dean thinks to Cas.
He waited it out a day or two until he found the right person to ask. He’d learned that approaching just any human with his questions could be off putting to them, but that there
“Why the hell are you riding around on the bus, if you have a car?” she replies.
It had been a simple moment at a gas station. Sam driving, for once, in charge of getting gas while Dean took Cas into the convenience store with him. Cas had watched, fascinated, as Dean went from one shelf to another, considering which bright package to pull off each one with more seriousness than he seemed to give most life or death decisions he made. When Dean had pulled a package called “sour gummy worms” off the shelf, he’d turned to Cas, winked, and said, “Don’t tell Sam.”
When Cas is planning to save the world, only in a way where he can’t tell Dean until it’s good and done, he does a lot of riding around on city buses. He finds it helps. He does it most often when he’s spent too much time with Dean, there but not there, listening, but just out of sight. When he’s been spending too much time making sure the Winchesters are okay—when it’s started to slide into just wanting to sit in the impala a minute longer, pretend Dean can see him, too, sink into the leather and the radio and the simple fact of Dean’s presence beside him—that’s when he finds a city bus to ride.
Dean’s hands are tense on the wheel, and he’s starting straight ahead. “I didn’t die,” he repeats, almost as if hearing Cas say it out loud to him is the first time it’s felt real. “Not then. That was when I decided, you know. That was when I decided I didn’t want to. To die.”
. It’s a cliché, maybe, something humans say so much it seems to have lost its meaning for them. But it’s true, with Dean. How do you tell someone? How do you tell someone,
Dean gets the feeling Cas could be anywhere, like maybe he isn’t really gone from the earth, maybe he’s just somewhere Dean can’t see. Dean likes to imagine Cas like radio waves, humming through the air, like if Dean could just tune into the right channel, maybe he could catch Cas again. Sometimes he even does that--turns on the radio and flips through the stations, just waiting to hear Cas’ voice. Stuff like that can happen--in between static and gospel stations and talks shows about Jesus, sometimes a song will cut through so clear you could swear there’s an old man on his porch with a microphone up to his banjo, and he’s playing the song just for you. You’ll try to keep the words in mind, hum the tune back, track it down as best you can. But you never can. There’s this moment of clarity you get out on the open road, and then you can never get it back, even on that same road, even tuned to that same station.
“I guess not,” Sam said. “Is there something you need?”
“I, Castiel, angel of the Lord, bless Dean Winchester in my name. I ask that what piece of the Lord dwells in me might hold and keep him, and I ask—I ask that what piece of the Lord that dwells in him might bless me as well.”
So Cas had done the same, made the crossing motion, told Dean, “Cross my heart and hope to die.” Not really getting it, still, but wanting to make Dean smile, which he did.
But now here’s Castiel, appearing out of nowhere and telling Dean there’s more to the world than he thought there was. And Dean still doesn’t know quite why he’s done it. He thinks about all the times he’s been the one bringing people in on it, on reality, how often the one thing he wishes he could say to them is simply,
So Cas isn’t worried about being found out here. He knows the other angels pay no attention to these kinds of prayer—the ritualistic ones.
After this last verse and an instrumental fadeout, the tape continues on to the last song of the album, a song about dead dogs on the highway and men left at the altar, and people who find reasons to believe in spite of everything they’ve seen. But the song feels like white noise, almost drowned out for Dean by the sound of his own heart, a rush of blood in his ears. He knew that song was on this album. As soon as he put it on, he knew the night was leading toward this, this moment that feels like a confession, even as he hasn’t said anything. He waits for Cas to say something, to ask a question, to bring up his own absent father. But Cas doesn’t say anything, and so it’s Dean who speaks first.
His wife Daphne.
"Nothing you say matters."
"Room 137. I'll be right there okay?"
They stayed like that until the door to the bunker opened and a familiar head of red hair appeared.
"That's different."
"I know it can't be easy." he said, voice tight as though he was having to force the words out.
Kevin stopped, which forced Dean and Sam to stop. He looked around Sam to Dean.
Crowley stared back, his expression a mixture of shock and pity.
"Well, so long as he's alright."
"Okay, yes. Maybe I got a little carried away at first, but those days are over. A near-death experience makes you re-evaluate. So, one time only, I'm offering amnesty. Every angel, no matter what their sin, may join me and return to heaven. I will be their God, and they can be my heavenly host."
"Yeah, you've said that before."
"Yes." He said, confused as to why Dean was stating the obvious.
Dean's eyebrows raised in surprise and he felt his heart quicken and his palms begin to sweat as he was hit full force with the realization that he was about to learn Castiel's secret, the one that made him cry in his sleep and panic every time it was brought up. The one that made his eyes sad and his smile broken. Dean had long thought that Castiel would have a beautiful smile, but he had never been lucky enough to see it. And he was about to find out why.
Castiel nodded again and turned, striding down the hallway, allowing Dean's voice in his mind to guide the way.
Dean sighed and stood, moving to join Cas on the bed, sitting sideways so he could face the other man. Cas shifted so he could look at Dean and brought his hand out to rest on Dean's bent knee.
"Yes, Dean?"
Charlie looked affronted.
"Shut up." Dean answered.
They head out around nine pm to the club.
Cas and Dean hug for a long time, next to his car before he gets in and drives off.
" Hi. I am Charly.  I am so glad you are here."
Cas inserts three fingers slowly.
"Come one. Don't be so sad on Sundays. We had a really good weekend and we see each other every day usually." Dean sighs. "I don't like leaving you either. Don't make it harder please."
[15.12., 21:30] Dean: You
Castiel sits on the couch in the living room, his comfort blanket around his shoulders
"But now your robe got wet. I wanted to keep your outfit in pristine condition."
"Then scoot over and let me be productive."
[13.12., 16:20] Castiel: I thought you're making potatoes?
[13.12., 19:21] Castiel: I wanna touch your cheek and run my thumb over those delicious lips.
"Yes. That's OK buddy. No worries. I'll be there in a few."
[31.3., 20:41] Castiel: Awwe
"Ok. Deal. I'll get the paperwork ready. Do I need both of you to sign or is it just you on the deed?"
Dean looks torn between the door and Cas. "Uhmmmm. . . Shit. OK fuck it. "
[24.5., 15:45] Castiel: Yes, i did meet lots of people and some are staying at the same hotel.
[3.3., 15:32] Castiel: I can do that. When is your brother due home?
"Uh... no? But I thought it might be a nice thing to do together? Did I fuck up? Did I do it wrong?"
[30.3., 22:11] Dean: Even after I come back, there will be a timeline where Sam and everyone I know has a life without knowing where I am
Castiel whimpers Dean's name.
[26.12., 14:34] Dean: What feelings
[25.12., 17:04] Castiel: I'm coming, hang in there Babe!!!
"It was just a dream."
"Let's get changed into comfortable clothes and order dinner?" Dean suggests.
[5.1., 17:40] Castiel: Heading off, see you in a few
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bite this hard." Dean mumbles into the next kiss.
[15.12., 23:17] Dean: But i like you like that
"Yes and no? I need to get it off my mind but I also just want to ignore it and cuddle, loose myself in you."
Dean pants into Cas neck peppering him with kisses while he keeps up rubbing his cock along Cas crack.
"I just spent several hours either thinking you don't want me anymore or freaking out that I could have broken this myself by thinking with my dick. Maybe I just want to hold you."
"Morning." Dean grumbles. "How are you?"
[13.12., 12:33] Dean : Ok
[5.12., 17:58] Dean: Alright
"I'll try to manage." Castiel nods. He kisses Dean and touches his forehead to Dean's.
[4.12., 10:38] Dean: She saw me texting
"Yeah?" Cas husks into his ear.
"Again? We've just been there yesterday. You want me to fall asleep again?"
Dean puts his hand in the middle of the table as an invitation and Cas lays his on top.
"Maybe." Cas winks. " But you like me anyway."
Cas talks about what he's been doing, about his progress on the DnD 'verse wheelchair, and about the bees he saw on the flowers outside the window.
[23.3., 18:00] Castiel: Oh shit, that reminds me, I should check if I do have other orders.
[31.3., 12:12] Castiel: 🙃🤗
"Awesome. I am glad. Let's go."
Cas thrusts both faster and harder.
"I'll be careful. So, how about an Episode of Mandalorian to get in the vibe for Charlie's commission? Oh, and grab a laptop to check if I do have more work?"
[3.12., 09:03] Dean: But because I practically raised that giant and I have the right to as his brother
Castiel goes quiet and nods.
[3.12., 10:37] Castiel: Well, I didn't know you were going there.
Dean shakes his head. "You don't have to. I... I don't want you to do it just for me. If that wasn't the plan, then it's not the plan"
"I'll play connect the dots once we can stay together again." Dean chuckles.  He moves his hand and slowly fucks his fingers in and out.
[27.12., 19:49] Dean: Did you run away because making out turned you on
"Got some juice?"
Dean grins happily and eats his food.
"Hi. Do you feel seduced yet?" Dean smiles.
[8.12., 22:27] Dean: And they fit nicely
Castiel loves the feeling of Dean’s erect cock in his mouth.
"Oh wow. You're unbelievable."
Dean steps closer and slowly undoes the tie. He runs his fingers over the soft material and slowly pulls on one end until he holds it in his hand.  He lays it over the chair and turns back to Cas.
