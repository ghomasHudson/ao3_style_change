"I was trying to help you remain calm." Sherlock responded with an eyeroll, keeping stock still as John walked right up into his space. The only movement he made was to tip his head down to accommodate him, his chin getting lost in his neck. "But for the record, those are incredibly hideous."
They stared at each other, eyebrows in completely opposite positions. Sherlock's furrowed tightly while John's were nearly arching off his forehead.
some things get explained. some things don't. poor John is at the mercy of yet another deduction and Mrs. Hudson makes another appearance.
"Ah, Sergeant. To what do we owe the pleasure?" Sherlock became the picture of ambivalence, sliding on his gloves.
"Forced me? It was you, stupid child! What other course of action would you have had me take Sherlock? Hm?" He had hissed, keeping his voice to a menacing whisper with the solar door still open. "You outright refused the crown in my place. In front of the Royal Court! Gregory and I leave in but a fortnight and you would do this to me? To our family?! I will not see any other sigil fly upon our standard. Any name but Holmes sit upon the throne. Do you understand? You were to be the next heir to the Kingdom of Appledore as your forebears have been for four hundred years before you and in one act of rash impudence...an act of absolute stupidity, you have ruined it! You refused to take what was rightfully yours out of some pathetic indulgence of pride! This was the only way to ensure that a Holmes would remain in power should I die...however diminished the capacity. Perhaps this will serve as an important lesson that the things that are necessary are far more important than your trivial wants. It's time to grow up Sherlock. Life is not long enough to waste on dreams."
"Y'know when the bottom of your rubbish sack falls out 'cause it's wet and too heavy?" Lestrade grimaced. "He sort of /came apart/ in the same fashion."
"I can create a diversion with which to distract them while your parasympathetic activity subsides," Sherlock offered softly, waving a hand in the direction of John's pelvis. "If you'd like."
John felt Sherlock's whole demeanor change at the sound of that name. He drew up slightly tighter, with his hands fisting momentarily at his sides. If John hadn't been well learned in the subtility of Sherlock's body language, he would have missed it.
He came down hard on his legs. Ankle buckling. A sharp rock tore at his knee.
Considering this, John laid down on his ear, hearing the gorgeous da-thump da-thump that brought life to the magnificent transport beneath him. Sufficiently calmed. "Alright. I'll keep that in mind."
John spread his arms wide, snow angeling himself on the covers. Blissed out. "What are you doing?"
The leather patched jacket he'd snatched up on his hasty departure was being terribly insufficient. But he suffered the burn in his cheeks and the numbness in the tip of his nose all the same. Taking on a fast clip at the call of danger. The bone-borne hup-two of military platitude.
"Then I think," John pushed himself up onto his tiptoes, hovering his lips directly over Sherlock. "We'd better make the most of it."
"But spelling out John's name with the victims' names. That," he clucks at her, shaking his head. "was ludicrously tacky. Did you lift it from a book?"
"Where do you go?" John couldn't help but ask. "When you leave me like that?"
"A live news conference? You think he'd make it that big of a deal?"
The bird tittered imploring at his question, unmoved by his lack of awareness. It was not here to keep the time of day for him.
"What appointment?" John was now just as confused. Droplets of jostled coffee splashing on the floor and miraculously missing his shoes.
The cage was made of two separate pieces that had been hewn from a single piece of wood. So well crafted that even the striations in the grain matched up to each other perfectly when fitted. It had been commissioned by Charles and presented to Sherlock like a gift during the very first days of his imprisonment.
After he shook his head and settled back, she went about cleaning up as best she could. Moving pillows from the floor to the sofa, scrubbing footprints from the coffee table. Eventually, she moved on to tackle the table that served as their desk and came across the book Miles had given him and the rock that Sherlock had. "Did you ever find out what this was all about?" She asked, picking up the rock and deciding that John might like it better with him, setting it down next to his tea.
"Oh. Well that's...how?" That seemed highly unlikely; he'd gone to bed.
All of the stainless steel tables inside were devoid of said corpse, though there was a rolling trolley sidled up next to one of them, laden with tools, as if a body was meant to arrive at any moment.
They were stolen simply to be eaten.
John shifted in his seat, simultaneously shocked and not, pushing his food around. "I missed some days at work while /we/ were out working. She was just checking to see if I was alright, which was actually very nice of her considering she's had an insider's view on what we do. And sorry, how do you know she called me four times?"
John would have found the whole situation amusing, if he'd not been so concerned about the twin flags of embarrassment painted high on Sherlock's cheekbones. That quiver in his throat. It didn't take a genius to see that Sherlock was trying their de facto way of avoiding difficult situations by fleeing, even if he couldn't do so physically. Had they been in Sherlock's room right this second, John had no doubt he'd be getting kicked out right about now.
Man and instrument had just finished playing 'Allegro molto appassionato' in E minor, and lay sprawled in such a way that he looked absolutely post coital. Limber and satisfied down to his marrow. If Sherlock were to partake in such dull practices anyway.
And now it was Sherlock's turn to frown. "I was experimenting John. And besides, digestion slows me down."
He looked deceptively young, with a diamond shaped face and thin, wispy limbs wrapped smartly in a three piece gray suit that he chose to wear tieless and garnished with a white silk pocket handkerchief. A shock of torchlight orange hair was slicked back into a mound at the top of his head, exuding an unnatural elegance that was simply intriguing.
"That noise the knife just made. Cutting through the two hundred million nerve fibers that connect the left side to the right. Corpus callosum." He turned another page and cleared his throat for good measure. "In case you were interested." He knew he could bait Sherlock's interest when it came to anything in Latin and right now he was feeling generous
The warmth of the sitting room was extraordinary against the night, made all the warmer with the new double insulated, top of the line windows. He wasn't sure how he'd pulled it, but Sherlock had somehow convinced someone to start and maintain a fire as well until they got there. Reclaiming the flat as a suitable home and no longer a heavily furnished ice box.
Lestrade put up a hand to Anderson's exasperated gasp, then buried it against his chest. "Alright Sherlock, make it quick. I'd like to get this scene packed up before we all turn to icicles."
He wondered with bated breath what it would be like to be breached. /Truly/ breached. With a stiff full cock thrust deep into his arse. Preferably Sherlock's. Definitely Sherlock's if he could ever coax his body into it. Teasing that soft solid bundle of nerves hidden deep up inside him with each delicate slide, rubbing it with just the right amount of friction and pulling him closer and closer to that gorgeous, terrifying edge.
"Yes." Sherlock said. "That was rather rude." Then he let the matter drop because it clearly no longer mattered. "Get dressed John. The club's across town."
"John." Sherlock manages to grind out. The iron grip he'd had on John's arse had loosened a bit until John had started to squirm. His fingertips bite back into the muscle.
"Sherlock? You're going to disinfect this all. Yeah?" John asked, pulling his plate a little closer to keep both items uncontaminated for the benefit of both parties. He had intended for it to be construed as more of a statement, rather than a question.
But Sherlock's legs could spread beneath the weight and did so without his control. And Charles would press against him more tightly when they opened, squeezing the air from his lungs and fumbling for something beneath them both before opening what felt like a wound in Sherlock's lower body. And Sherlock would find finally find his voice and scream.
He ground the bony brackets of their hips together, chafing penis against penis and scratching the soft skin of their bellies against coarse, mismatched hair. He took John's hands and threaded their fingers, guiding them up above his head. John was panting already, his eyes wet, his mouth an open vent of hot breath against his face.
'There's a birthday present on the table for you, I felt it was a good representation. Have a nice day. - SH'
He could not be mad if William was happy. He simply couldn't.
They would all finally be able to endure. Instead of just survive.
those of you ambitious enough to look up where Sherlock swanned off to will possibly get an idea of where this story's headed. ;} so hopefully you approve.
The notes were slightly violent. Not the sort of atmosphere to put on at two in the morning, but in the belly of 221B there was hardly ever anything going on that was ordinary.
At that moment, pathologist Molly Hooper came shuffling into the door, mumbling down at a bone saw in her hand that she was flicking on and off, making the little motor whir and the toothed circular blade spin and stop and spin again.
He was crowding John in again after that, to keep John from seeing him, kissing him desperately and somewhere between the ridiculous smacking of lips and clink of bumped teeth and the smearing of snot, the unmistakable gurgling of slick through a bottleneck was heard.
"I'd be delighted." Sherlock steepled his long fingers against his smirk and the city around them seemed to slip into silence to listen. "The victim was in his mid thirties. A local, most likely, who'd just visited his dentist and a lover. Perhaps they are one in the same, but as of this moment it's a bit too hard to quantify. Whomever killed Mr. John Doe tonight gave him a strong lateral shove from behind, most likely at shoulder height. Hard enough to take him off of his feet in one motion.
Dawn had finally climbed high enough to seep in through the window now. Making the solar wall flush with a rose tint. But the bird's strange silhouette still marring the flooding light made the man turn back to the window in confusion. Not understanding why the thrush was tarrying so.
"Oh was it now?" She asks with a bit of a laugh. She's intrigued by his anger. "Because I rather remember you trying to trick my dog with a decoy Mr. Holmes. You sacrificed an innocent man whose only purpose in life was to delay John Watson's death for just a little bit longer. Was it worth it? To find him here so close to dying anyway?"
Each sway brought the waft of John's soap to Sherlock's nose. Some cheap bar of compressed fats and oils spiced liberally with the undercurrent of almonds that was usually quick to die away when he got out of the shower. But here in the calm and quiet, the utterly close, it was preserved in his last sweat like an insect in ember. Lingering.
John grumbled, but couldn't be arsed to move. "Where are you going?"
John could feel in his bones that the High Steward's next words were directed only to him, though he appeared to still be addressing the crowd.
"Don't play coy with me FREAK." Donovan spat as a couple carrying large shopping bags insinuated themselves shyly between them. John did his best to give them a placating but 'keep moving' smile to the husband. "You're not to come within one hundred meters of this investigation!"
His eyes widened and his mouth clicked shut as he took in John's presence.
"Hm?" He'd caught John right before he started to seep into sleepiness. And it was a good thing too.
/Wanting/ it.
so here's hoping.
"Yes, indeed." Dr. Sipe agreed. "Ygritte, would you do the honours please?"
"Why are you suddenly bringing up Sarah?" John knew they would loop back to the topic eventually, he would make it inevitable.
Sherlock threw his head back in a triumphant laugh as John rounded the landing, tossing his phone over his face as he leapt the last four steps in complete joy.
Charles took him gently by the chin when he did not respond and made him look at him. "You do know that don't you? How I long for you." He leaned in close, as though he wanted to kiss him. "It's far better for the Captain to have shown his true colours and run away now instead of running away later, wouldn't you agree?"
"I could have started in med school..." John tried, but Sherlock was already shaking his head.
"Do I want to what?" Sherlock puts a hand delicately to himself and pulls it away as if burned. No drugs. No alcohol. No guilt. Just pure elemental emotion is driving his arousal this time.
The second field had been left fallow in the hope that another summer unplanted would make it fertile again. Helped along by their paltry flock of puny sheep that'd been let out of the house this morning to roam over the earth, spreading their manure. Ones that he'd been keeping a weathered eye on and counting every so often as he laboured.
John took hold of Sherlock's hands in solidarity and let them curl over his, staring down at his bony knuckles. "All I'd like," John said, running his thumbs over Sherlock's hands, "is for you to eat. You're still recovering from being ill and I know how hard that can be. Harriet and Clara did everything they could for me when I was sick and I want to do the same for you."
Silently to himself, though, John made a vow that he would not use Sherlock the way he had been used in the past, whether Eric and Victor had known of his asexuality or not. That every time they engaged in any type of intercourse from here on out, it would be by mutual decision between the two of them and he hoped that Sherlock would have enough respect for John to tell him the truth of how he felt when they did.
"Then stay with me. Tomorrow night. And I will show you why it is that you are alive."
And with the last valiant efforts of his consciousness, John glimpsed that smear of proud spunk strike home and make it look as though Sherlock's face had been striped liberally with John's cum.
Sweating sickness, a terrible plague that announced itself in cold shivers, sweating, heart palpitations and then exhaustive collapse that generally killed those that had been afflicted, had been sweeping across the country from the West and decided (before moving on) to take the last of William's kin from him.
William had seen him at almost his worst, writhing unconscious in a bed as the pain and the darkness had tried to take him. But he had also seen him at his best, and by his silent estimation, it looked to be like John was resembling more the latter. "Bit skinny, I suppose. But well. The beard suits you."
"Don't tell me what a bloody head wound looks like!" John half shouted. "Your goddamned ear's off!"
Warm regards.'
He had not wanted her to leave.
New Scotland Yard dismantled the scene like a theatre production and paid no further attention to the figures disappearing into the night.
It was such a loving gesture. One that looked as though it was done by rote. By want. Their hands slipping together with two hundred days of practice and it did something warm to melt the ice from John's heart that he had not expected.
"Alright. Alright. Give me a minute." John reached into his side dresser and pulled out Sherlock's checkbook lying beneath his dog tags next to his Browning. Keeping the useless book for just such occasions, since he and Sherlock used the debit card or cash preferentially. He typed in the numbers and sent off the e-mail. Hoping that the translation program had as much value as Sherlock seemed to be putting into it. When he looked back up, Sherlock was staring at him with his head tilted.
When John confessed that he had a limited knowledge on the subject, Miles began interrogating him about what it was exactly and why it happened. The different kinds. Wanting John's professional medical opinion, slight though it was. He danced around rhabdomyosarcoma specifically, until John finally asked straight out what his own experience concerning it was, which made the conversation blossom into an explanation of why Miles had suddenly decided on publishing his book. He said that it had been based on what he described as both the best and worst week of his life.
"No I--" John began, but could not finish. The hurt of it was still too fresh. A wound still lurking beneath the first cover of scab. "No."
"Has he not returned then?" The High Steward asked unnecessarily. "What a pity." He brought Sherlock's limp hand to his own face and let the knuckles drag across the high mountains of his cheekbones. "But perhaps it's for the best, my Prince. There is not a person in the Kingdom that cares for you like I do."
"I--"
It takes John a moment to figure out what she's talking about, as his eyes rather get lost tracing over the damask behind her. This is a pretty place, he decides. It looks rather like a palace.
The driver stands solemnly in a pressed black suit, sporting a steel gray beard and mustache. His hands are tucked politely before him and John doesn't hold back the incredulous smirk as he recognises this man.
They kissed for what seemed like hours, tasting each other as much as they could. Parrying tongues and exploring teeth. They learned the shapes of each other's mouths all until a greedy shift and an errant splash of bathwater made Sherlock be the first to break away, remembering where they were and what they were doing. How easily they could be caught.
He'd probably take offense. Seeing John in this way.
At his feet sat a white-headed tawny bulldog on a lead; the dead giveaway (if you were looking) to the secret private entrance to The Jolly Bulldog, apparently. The dog's only acknowledgement of the men was a slight hiccup in its smoking snuffle and the slight readjustment of its in-turned feet. Not the happy greeting one might expect from their mascot. "Hardly seems jolly." John muttered to himself and smiled closed-mouth at the severe looking man, not able to shake his giddiness.
Carefully, carefully, Sherlock's mouth came unstuck with a soft pop and his fingers slid out as John's sphincter expelled him. He repositioned himself over the top of the loose mass that used to be a man, wrapped it up into his arms and nuzzled his nose hard against it's cheekbone, whispering words that he knew John would listen to, "ssshhh, John. I have you. It's alright. It's going to be fine."
"Let me get this out while it still means something," John continued, reaching out to take Sherlock's arm and stop them fully on the pavement. He wanted his friend to truly understand what had happened. He knew that Sherlock was used to working alone, but it wouldn't be like that anymore. "I'm sorry that I left Sherlock, but you REALLY pissed me off. I want to bloody throttle you when you act like that. You can't treat me like a punching bag just because you're bored! What you said was cruel. I don't even remember exactly--"
There was a knock at the door and Sherlock's face crumbled into a scowl.
"Time for what? There is nothing left between us. I am ending it. Now. As of today it is finished. I'll not have Henry be made a cuckold by me."
Sherlock hummed satisfactorily, shifting closer and unintentionally revealing the hard column of his secret erection to press against the top of John's bum. "Oh. Hallo." John pushed back before he could move away, trapping it between them and Sherlock gave a sharp inhale before going completely still.
Sherlock breathed out an ambient laugh.
John's lips flexed but no words came out for a time. Feeling all five litres of his blood suddenly flood into his face. "I...But...We can't. You..." His ears felt like they would melt off his head as he finally found a simple sentence knocking about in his brain he clung to it. "But I'm not gay."
Slightly relieved, John dismissed him and the creeping flush still crawling up his neck. "Okay. I'll see you after work then."
He didn't understand the hot rushes of frantic air on his neck, simply swiped blindly at his sweat-soaked curls and tried to soothe the jack rabbit pace of Sherlock's heart. The man in his lap was trembling wildly.  He whispered to him soothingly. "Slow down, love. Slow down. Shh. You're going too fast. We don't have to hurry this." How could something that had been so beautiful and intimate mere moments ago turn suddenly into such hysteria in a matter of seconds? "It's alright. I have you. Slow down. Tell me what's wrong."
John's brow furrowed, stopping mid-step. Always something. "Currently occupied by /what/ exactly?" Just PLEASE don't let it be another live animal.
There was nothing he could do for this man. His fate had been sealed.
"Sleep John." He heard against his lips, before he was out.
"Backward now. Same pace."
But he immediately squashed the buoyed warmth that threatened to wash over him. Sobering just in time for Sherlock to emerge from his room, slipping the last of his buttons into place and tucking the bottom of his favoured plum-coloured shirt into his trousers when they both caught eyes. Neither man able to properly stifle their smiles.
But there was nothing. And it incensed him most that Jim Moriarty, a psychopath who had trussed up innocent people, John included, in explosives, all in the name of some sick game that he had orchestrated for Sherlock to solve, had seemingly vanished into thin air.
Sherlock raises his head up and smiles a small smile when he sees John's sincerity. "Yes. Of course I will."
"Are you sure? I'm very good at driving people to distraction." He continued cheekily, which lessened John's unease a bit with what presumably had been a double entendre.
"This is impossible."
It warmed something to know that Sherlock was at least somewhat considerate of their finances, if only for John's sake. He remembered how flippant Sherlock had been only a couple months earlier when Sebastian Wilkes had tried to pay for his services with a cheque and had been waved off derisively. To which John had been quick on the uptake. The number of zeros after the amount had been enough to make John's knees wobble.
John did not allow himself to sleep, he merely made camp beneath the overhang of a large tree and rested his eyes against its trunk.
He'd had his share flings, one night stands, relationships that fizzled, marital prospects that ceased before commitment. The numbers were less than people usually thought, but he let them think whatever. Once he'd been given the nickname 'Three Continents Watson',  there was little he could do to dissuade it.
"I am Detective Inspector Tobias Gregson and I have made it my personal crusade to lead an investigation into the murders of one Mr. Athelny Jones and Mr. Nathan Ollery. Two victims who were both found dead under suspicious circumstances earlier this week. We understand the stranglehold the city's been under concerning these two individuals' deaths and are happy to announce that after an exhausting investigation," he gave a small smile that looked like it strained his face, "certain evidence has come to light which has helped us in bringing in our main suspect."
Sherlock reentered from the hallway door, slipping his phone into his pants pocket with a bit of a swagger in his step, on full display for those who would notice. Lestrade gave John another wild-eyed gaze and John remained unable to rebuff it.
"Easily remedied." Sherlock laid the garment bag across John's lap and disappeared out the door. In his absence, John unzipped it to find that Sherlock had brought him his delicately plaid button up and the wine colored sweater he preferred to pair with it. Along with his olive trousers and brown belt which matched the shoes John had left to the surgery in. In short: John's 'dressing up' outfit.
oo6. and my Victor Trevor was pictured as Eamon Walker. because guh! he's gorgeous.
The calf's large black eyes had been closed in bliss. Her long limbs folded beneath her as she lay in utter contentment. "It's already been arranged." She shrugged.
"Five million yen if you do the monetary conversion." Sherlock resumed his pacing behind him, fingers steepled against his chin, the biscuits abandoned. "So you can see how its loss has definitely left a significant hole in Mr. Asano's pocket."
John sighed out of his nose. "Alright. So what about the previous victim? Mr. Jones? Can't we open him up too and see what's missing from him? That could give us some more clues on what precisely he's looking for." He noticed Lestrade and Molly's faces take on a pinched look as he said it.
finally!
"However," Sherlock continued, "extras are always ideal. So it's certainly not an ineffectual purchase. I suppose you'll be wanting to discuss the parameters of our arrangement in further detail once we return home?"
now obviously, Sherlock didn't invent the telescope. it was really Hans Lippershey of the Netherlands ... and historically not until the 1600s. but i really liked the idea of the boys bonding over a phallic object. so hee!
In everything he found. There was no opal.
"Expected where? Wha-Sherlock! Where are we going?" Caught up in his wake, John grabbed up his coat, pulling himself into it while simultaneously jamming his feet into his shoes. He was out the door in moments, following the thundering feet that were already halfway down the stairs.
/God willing./ He'd thought. But said instead, "I still want to try." He had given his cane a tap against the outside of his boot and leaned back.
John couldn't help but let himself fantasize briefly about what it meant to hold that distinction. It hinted to the dangerous possibility of waking up in a shared bed to a fuzzy-edged morning to a dark and messy head peeking out from beneath the duvet beside him. Their skin tight from shared emissions from the night previous. Consecrating themselves together through light, insistent kissing despite shared dragon breath. It spoke of panting into each other's mouths. Laced fingers during a slow fuck. Coming twice and whispering nothings. Interspersed with everythings.
They stood staring at one another.
"And you're interested in doing it again?"
John wants to wrap him in his arms, pull him close, but if he does he won't let go. And he /has/ to let go. "I know, love. But it's not meant to feel like that. It's meant to feel good. Next time it will be better. It'll be better for the both of us. Alright?"
"Boorish imbeciles." Sherlock grumbled, his voice sounding as though he was much closer. "I wish these physicians would learn that they're not only wasting their own time, but more importantly mine with this nonsense."
"No. I liked him, sure, but just as a regular sort of bloke. I wasn't chatting him up or anything." A thought tickled John's periphery, one that made the hair on his arms stand up. "I'm with you, Sherlock. I'm not going to beetle off with somebody else. Is that what you're worried about? We're together."
John thought about this, parsing it out in his own way. It took him a little bit. "So when you say it's not going to work, what you're really saying is...you can't focus on sex because your brain's on overdrive all the time?"
He had always relied on John's facial expressions to help him navigate human emotion, and this was important.
He fell asleep that night muttering a string of 'no. nononono'. . .
"As ever, I am at your mercy, my Prince." Charles' voice seeped from his lips like poisonous vapour. Always so soft and lethal.
Never being a fan of sugar in his tea, he pursed his lips and calculated his options. If he poured it out in the sink, Sherlock would know. Even if he aimed specifically for the drain holes, somehow that only made it seem like he'd find out for sure, as he probably had it rigged or something. If he poured it down the drain then proceeded to wash the dishes over the top of it, Sherlock would know, because the sink wasn't /nearly/ full enough to spur an impromptu dish-washing session from either of them and even John knew that. And suppose Sherlock was still in the flat? (It was still piping hot, so there was a very good chance.) He would hear it, he would know what was happening, he might confront John about it and then John would feel like a complete arse.
"And I certainly find it hard to believe that he would choose to off himself after he'd just received a £2600 suit! So that means whomever pushed him was close to him. He trusted them. They knew each other intimately. Hence the lover. And in such short a time as to-"
"Oh." Lestrade hadn't expected a full-on admission. "Well that's...good. How long has this been going on? If I can ask..."
"Your pursuit of exotic cuisine has betrayed you, Angela. So tell me, you're a woman of the world, have you heard of a disease called 'kuru'?"
Sherlock apologizes in his own way.
From the back of the crowd, the people began to move, cleaving apart like a tree before the blade of an axe as two soldiers clad in black and gold armour drug a struggling, shrieking man clear up onto the balcony.
"Nothing. Ignore it." He drained his glass and cleared his throat. Chuffed and uncomfortable. "I suppose we should tidy up a bit before our client gets here?" John suggested, resurveying the clutter and noticing that the chill had left him. It was replaced by a gentle, heavy burn in his guts.
Lasers swirled, spotlights flashed, there was the thick choking haze of fake smoke wafting about that held the duel stench of heated glycerin and the sticky sweet undercurrent of marijuana. In the center of the room was a writhing, throbbing mass of men dancing against each other, pressing close in various states of undress.
Sherlock met his eyes, deciding that he would not let John know that he had just rocked his entire foundation. "Sorry. What?" John let out a snort. "Nothing. Never mind. Do you want to get out of here? I'm stuffed."
Sherlock turned fully towards him then, meeting his gaze with shut eyes. He shook his head gently in denial, unable to speak. He was wearing pajama pants and no shirt, broad shoulders draped in his aubergine dressing gown. The small, pink ovals of his nipples stood out starkly against his pale pale skin, markers of contrast to keep him from being merely a ghost.
John's experience in Afghanistan is based on a combination of a documentary I saw and real-life stories from an Afghan-war veteran that works at my work.
Anderson, who'd been shifting fitfully in the background with impatience, slithered up to their side. The look on his face when he finally noticed John and Sherlock stooping by his crime scene, was priceless. However for Donovan, their presence immediately made her decide to stay back up on the road, clearly still brooding over their last encounter and wanting nothing to do with them.
A ring of dust had been left to accumulate around the borders of the floor for several years now. Not having been allowed to be cleared away by the servants under strict instruction. It had grown so thick over time, that it was reminiscent of a seance circle, though it lacked the benefit of protection against evil.
He bolted hard up the stairs, taking them two at a time until it was impossible to. His boots squelched on every step. Tired legs trying to collapse beneath him. But he would not let them.
Or maybe, John supposed, it was something they could discuss or --but God his hair smelled good.
Miles went on to describe what kind of person his friend had been. An optimist who had been convinced that had he been dealt a different hand, he would have amounted to someone amazing. He had been a writer as well, though Miles felt that perhaps his friend would have made a better poet, speaking during his last days alive as death being a "dance through the firmament" and other prophetic ideas.
When John came downstairs later that morning, fully dressed in his checked shirt, Aran and jeans, Sherlock was hunched over the corner of the main dining room table. There was a littering of little white jewelry boxes piled beside him, a large box that looked to be from eBay by which they seemed to have initially come, and an oblong shadow box frame alongside a packet of gold 18 gauge pins. He'd drug a lamp in from the sitting room to help him see and it was so bright it highlighted the brown in his dark curls.
Eager to stymie the pain cracking through him, John takes three large pulls, feeling the velvet burn of it as it courses down into his belly.
Sherlock wastes no time with a return greeting. "Did you bring what I asked?" He demands, shouldering his way past Mycroft with John still cradled against him. John's face has gone ashen from the walk and he's beginning to tremble with shock. His feet have resorted to sliding against the ground instead of being able to lift into a full step.
"That would be fine." John said, too desperate to care otherwise. He pressed all three gold sovereigns into her palm and watched her eyes go wide. The fresh pig's blood she hadn't managed to clean off burned his frozen hands as if it were on fire.
"Sherlock..." John warned.
"You could have at least made an /attempt/ at nice."
When he saw the High Steward finally turn, John met his gaze reluctantly.
Sherlock pursed his lips and narrowed his eyes. "Put the routing number to my bank account at the bottom, he said he would wire the money to us as soon as he could."
It had been a hell of a time getting him stretched wide enough to do it, his dream remembers, with nothing but mineral oil and spit for lube between them. But that glorious slow slide inside. The constant repositioning of Bill's hands on John's strong thighs as he managed his own descent with his fingers digging in. John's dream recalled with perfect clarity that shit-eating grin on Bill's face when his hips finally hit the hard cradle of John's pelvis and it was all seared into John's brain like a cattle brand.
He spoke when he was able, turning only his head over his shoulder, playing along. "Besides that Mycroft's more cloak and daggers than a bloody Bond film villain, no. He, um, just came by to drop off that folder you wanted to get me. Wherever it got to. You do understand that I really didn't require a spreadsheet though, right?"
Lestrade's globus eyes met him and time seemed to grind into slow motion. They told John with their diameter exactly what the Detective Inspector had just been witness to.
"So? What did you want to talk about?" John gave him the lead.
He was delightfully surprised when Sherlock's hand hovered over his momentarily before settling lightly upon it. Unsure of its welcome but definitely conveying that he /was/ special. Sherlock was chewing on his lips and there was a distinct shiver in his eyes. His worried countenance, lit up from below by his phone, made the soft blade of his face appear exceedingly young. He seemed to be on the verge of saying something incredibly difficult for him, debating with himself. Something important.
"Are you certain?"
"Both men have had their first and second molars removed, both have been drugged with Lorazepam, and both men were pushed to their deaths. This is good. This is very, VERY good."
"Is it that late already?" He rasped, his deep voice grating from long disuse.
Sherlock was lost in his own deduction, chasing threads and mending snags to bring the whole terrible tapestry back together. Bringing to light what had remained for a long while a very shrouded day. And he was completely oblivious to the way it was tearing John apart.
The roads of Baker Town remained mostly empty during the day. The dirt barely disturbed as horses, carts, or even patrolling soldiers rarely moved over them anymore. The townsfolk, when driven out of their homes by lack of food or work or other necessity, moved on quick and silent feet. Often under the cover of darkness and avoided the roads altogether.
"It was rather amazing, wasn't it?" Sherlock's face suddenly split into an inhuman grin as he faced forward. Drowning in his ego.
"Would it be better if I turned my back?"
John huffed a bright stab of laughter through his nose in both amazement and alarm and allowed more room between them. Sherlock didn't seem to be suffering the same result; all the lines of his suit lay perfectly once he gave his jacket a stiff tug and smoothing down and John couldn't help the swell of suddenly feeling a bit grotty.
/Yes./ He told himself. /This is a good decision./
And so he did. He watched in horror as the baskets that had come from the tired man's cart were passed around through the crowd now. More of the putrid items taken up in hate and haste until they were all gone.
Sherlock cupped his face with his large hands, examining him. Smearing his thumbs where John's wetted cheeks reached his wet chin, while light eyes sliced through his brain and saw particulate galaxies that John could never ever hope to see within himself. And as if no other choice would suffice, Sherlock pulled and stretched up and kissed John as soundly as he possibly could in answer.
"The physician will be up shortly to see to you, my Prince. I look forward to her diagnosis."
John sniffed against the cold. "It'll due I suppose." And allowed the detective to lead the way.
There's a loud POCH!
John found a heady comfort in the solidarity of his work; healing was his nature. He asked the hollowed man before him if it was okay to unbutton the top button of his shirt for better access to the blood that had dribbled down his neck and Sherlock only hummed an admission. He was afloat in the sea of deductions.
It ended with a stilted silence before Charles made a final comment and he was so close to the opening of the door now that John heard him clearly.
Trusting him wordlessly, Sherlock reroutes them.
His eyes opened for a momentary glance. One so quick he could barely register the shapes that made his overhead world, but like fate he found those lustrous knife eyes of Sherlock Holmes' looking down on him and with such a look of open hunger that it set John Watson atremble. He could not say the word. Would not.
Sherlock explains his troubles. John tells Sherlock his own secret. They find a nice equilibrium.
Whatever it was, he was obviously very VERY good.
"John!"
"Alright?"
John's eyes locked with Sherlock's so fiercely that it hit them both like they had just tilted against each other in a joust.
/Been Dazed and Confused for so long it's not true.
"Sometime after you'd left, Mrs. Hudson brought this up, saying a messenger had delivered it." For the sake of hygiene, he opened the envelope to let John see the interior letter.
But when he looked at Sherlock, he saw that some dark memory dwelled behind that beautiful face and he knew he should not press the matter any further.
He found his eyes tracking slowly. Following down the shape of him and the way the silk dressing gown gave away his intimate structure.
John jumped, startled from his reverie by Sherlock's sudden appearance. Sherlock looked pekid where he stood, wilting in the doorway. John played off his surprise and took his hand carefully off the diabolical folder. "Oh hey. You alright?"
"Oh for God's sake!' Sherlock growled, becoming all the more irritated at John's procrastination.
Sherlock clung to this thought like a drowning man and it was the only thing that made his subsequent abuse almost tolerable.
What he was expecting was a tight furl of muscle that he would have to gradually coax open. What he found instead stole his breath away. His fingers touched the blunt flare of something circular and unapologetically synthetic.
Sherlock seemed to study him for a concentrated moment.
The next thing John knew, he was being awoken by the sudden stabbing of daylight to his face and the skittering of rings on a curtain rod. He grimaced against the light and made to move, only to moan at the aches that sang out in his tight body.
John was shaking his head, leaning in with his hands clasped behind his back and looking with a more clinical lens. There was only so much he could do for the man now. "It would have been too catastrophic for his body to deal with the loss of both organs at the same time. Both excisions have been professionally cauterized, but it would have been too much trauma on his system. He would have gone into metabolic shock and wound up dead in a short time anyway. It was a bloody miracle he was up and walking as it was."
"Please John." Sherlock's voice was broken and in the wreckage he slipped his eyes effectively.
"You're not suppose to eat for another hour post procedure." Sherlock warned him.
"Although, I have to admit it was a fifty fifty choice as to which pair of names we should have used tonight. I rather fancied going as Basil, more interesting name overall, but you hardly look proletarian enough to pull off being a Nigel."
His legs feel weak. His heartbeat is out of control. His left hand goes practically limp at the end of his arm at what might possibly be the most traitorous time possible.
"Hmm. Yes indeed, we are." Sherlock made a show of looking about to verify, before folding his arms across his chest and tipping his chair onto its back two legs. "We could move the proceedings to my bedroom if you'd prefer. My knees would certainly thank you."
War hero they called him.
He was no longer the unkempt, gangly stack of limbs John remembered tucked into his arms a lifetime ago. He was a different man now.
"The physician will come for your urine once you're finished." Charles said as the servants who had filled the tub filed out, having never made a sound, leaving him utterly alone with his captor. As he seemed always to be. "Until then. Your bath is ready."
But Sherlock can do better than see; he can OBSERVE. And he takes one look at John and he knows what's was going on. Why John is spasming like an open-mouthed fish. Why he can't seem to calm down. And he spells it out for him as plainly as he can. His commanding voice as calm as he can make it. "Your arms, John. Your arms are trapped underneath him. I'm going to lift him up and you're going to roll free. Alright? On the count of three: one, two, three!"
"Or get shot." Sherlock added.
Try to love you baby, but you push me away.
To prove his point, Sherlock leaned down and unceremoniously shoved his first two fingers up into the head's nostrils, lifting it from the ground a couple of millimeters. Leaving no doubt that had it been broken; the head would have slid further down onto his hand with the weight. "What we're seeing here is the lesser studied method of extracting it through the /rear/ of the skull." He removed his hand and waved it as if it was all too tedious to continue talking.
Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill?/
As the tremble worsened, Sherlock gripped John's cheeks more solidly, digging his fingertips in until they dipped into tight muscle.
Lots and lots of booze.
"It wasn't a guess." Sherlock replied quietly, unable to help himself.
I write after my family has gone to bed and during my lunch break at work so I find it only fair to give you a head's up on what you can expect so far as update timing.
All the time spent in his convalescence had sapped him of his muscle and fat. Already short and slight in his time of health; John had arisen like a wraith, much too thin to even hold up his old leggings.
For it would allow him to return home and cower in his cruck house. . .
And that that in itself may very well be the thing that would make him have to let go.
John reluctantly met his eyes, dropping his hands, with his jaw loose. Absolutely wrecked.
"Yes. Of course yes."
"But you were just a kid..." John blustered, but Lestrade had more wind and spoke over him.
John blinked in surprise. He had expected it to be a much harder fight. "Really? Just like that?"
Sherlock's heart murmured. Wary of whether to trust Charles' words. Something that was beneficial to both of them would no doubt sour for Sherlock in time. As everything did.
John quickly learned that the only true control he had were the simple machinations of his own body, while Sherlock held all other power between his own two hands. He dictated everything by the way John's body tensed, by the way he breathed, taking him up to the edge of orgasm before forcing him to ratchet back down and repeat the process over and over and over again. Skillfully avoiding even the slightest whispering brush of John's prostate. Not allowing him such easy closure.
"Because you would have said no otherwise." William answered simply, "and besides that; I owe you."
Strewn haphazardly around the table tops was an array of different skulls, the vast majority belonging to large and small animals, except for one in particular, which lay close to the candlestick. It was a human skull which rested on the pedestal of Sherlock's upside-down crown.
Goose flesh bloomed across his exposed skin.
"Aye." John said reluctantly. "That's me."
John opened his mouth to back pedal, but was overcome.
The first month of learning to sit with this contraption around and inside him had been tantamount to torture.
"Yes," he wanted to be past this now, a dark feeling was starting to twist around inside him, one that told him he might have just done something 'not good'. And he scrambled to make it okay. "But I've spent years building up an immunity to the effects of it, at least until the source of that particular inquiry ran dry to me and I gave up the pursuit. But I assure you that my methods are exact. I'll feel no side-effects from it. You see," he put his arms out for display, "I'm perfectly fine."
Slowly, he noticed that Sherlock's finger had stopped plotting Fibonacci's ratio to precisely dip into the small sinkhole that made up the exit wound in the back of his shoulder, worrying it gently. Sherlock's heart thumped a hair faster as John realized that Sherlock had realized that he'd been caught out. John closed his eyes.
Back in Umberland of the North, John watched his fellow peasants starve because various reasons made their yields turn out low and they had no choice but to starve, but here, with the castle full of food and servants at his beckoned call anytime he wished, Sherlock foolishly chose not to eat because it was an inconvenience.
"It was a fire axe John. The weapon that did the damage." Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut as John began spraying cleaning solution onto the wound site, shielding it with his hand to keep it from getting in Sherlock's face. It was cold all down the side of his head, but burned on his exposed cartilage. "I tried to find it, but someone had pulled the fire alarm by then and everyone was in a panic. That's the epitome of stupidity, isn't it? People in a panic." Sherlock's voice pulled high with pain and John bit back a wholly different answer.
John pressed the curve of his foot more solidly against Sherlock's, swallowed the last of his last drink and slowly stood, having all the pieces he needed to now put Sherlock's past romantic life together and venture forward in their own attempt. Make it better. When Sherlock finally looked up, his gaze was raw crystal.
"Would you still like to know what it was?"
Even the Queen Mother has the good sense to know that Sherlock Holmes' words are infallible.
There was only one visitor that was ever permitted to see John now, and that was William Murray. A slender whip of a man with a short mop of ginger hair and a smile that could slice through darkness like a sunbeam. A man with whom John had grown up and shared a history with as old as all the love stories.
"I've booked you an appointment with the dentist." Sherlock said simply.
"That's it." John remembers now. Eyelids getting heavy. "I'm glad that's working out for us."
"You're perfectly safe." Said the man who considered stating the obvious anathema. "But if you need me to stop, tell me so. You have complete control."
"He has." John admitted, walking slowly. "I think. I mean, I know that he's definitely changed my life."
"Lift." Sherlock instructed and pulled his trousers completely off when John's hips floated, dropping them to the floor. "And that, off," he motioned to John's shirt, "and for God's sake John, get those out of my sight." He wafted a whole hand at John's striped socks as though they were an abomination to fashion itself.
The man presumably called Caddyshack was bear hugging John's side, practically climbing on top of him. He was wearing only a pair of very short blue shorts and aviator sunglasses. Caddyshack was taller and skinnier than John, handsome with a prominent mustache.
And it belongs to the man he'd seen at the bar. The one he should have noticed from the start, with the slick dark suit and the throat tattoo and the fire-coloured hair. And he is grinning and grinning and GRINNING like a cat in the catnip garnished cream saying something John can't hear and so he turns to get closer and the voice becomes clear:
Harriet would have laughed, had it not been so devastating.
Sherlock sat in the gloaming dark on the edge of the bed, his eyes glazed over as the virgin rain beat heavily against the window. Slicking down like tears. The cold weight of the looking glass had settled by his hand.
All of John's insides spasmed at once, rocking on his shoulders. Milky arcs of semen pulsating out from his untouched cock ...ONE, two, threefourfive! They spattered against his torso, seeking each other like mercury to pool in the soft valley of his stomach and make a breakaway towards his chest.
Somewhere in the midst of his press, a bodiless hand reached out and took a palmful of his groin, squeezing it heartily. He yelped, then groaned, and made a fist in eventual fury, whirling about but unable to find the offending individual so he could jaw them. Having no choice but to continue his search.
There is a sharp inhale, a barely audible gasp from the Queen Mother, but in a room so steeped in silence it was tantamount to a scream.
John relented because he didn't have the energy to fight it. SupThe icon on the man's back was recognizable by its mismatched fangs and flaming sword. pressed regrets bidden forth by the sudden ebb in emotion. "I left her, Sherlock. I left her alone at the museum and she was murdered." He stabbed his finger in emphasis at the floor. "I was suppose to protect her and I didn't. I wasn't there when she needed me. Because I went after you."
To John's illiterate eye, the calligraphy at the top of the page was merely a large box of precisely written swirls that looked pleasingly assembled, but the illustrations beneath them, they were what staggered John. For never had he seen such beautiful things put down on pages before. And with such detail.
The fight was coming back into his Prince, which pleased the High Steward greatly. It would be so much more satisfying to possess and defile a fiery creature than a beautiful wretch whose spirit was already broken. "In time, my honey sop." Charles smiled with no joy. "In time." And took his leave.
"Why not? The staff could be in on it with him..."
But there's a heavy thump and Sherlock is over him with black curls hanging like a frame about his face. His large long hand smoothing through John's hair. Trying to comfort. Trying to soothe. His mouth is moving. Muttering. Mumbling something in that deep baritone and John has to really focus to hear what he is saying. Has to focus enough to cancel out the high-pitched whine he didn't realize he was making through his teeth to understand the other man's words.
Sherlock slyly maneuvers his thigh to strategically be a pressure point for John's lightly rutting hips and the crest of the building tension pulls John back from the freefall.
With a shake of his head John tucked the towel around his waist and turned his back on him, turning towards the beflowered vanity to disguise his wariness. Perhaps it would be better if he spoke first, admit his mistake outright and  leave no part of himself exposed. He just needed to come up with the right thing to say. Something clever that would lay waste to Sherlock's ridicule. But what?
"I am." Closing his eyes, John tried hard not to think about how strange it was to have the Prince of Castle Appledore pouring warm, sweet-smelling water over his shoulders. How, as he'd done with his clothes, Sherlock treated him so gently as he worked the cloth up around his throat. Combed his long fingers through the tangle of his beard and now began to work one finger at the fine creases in his face.
"But we're not finished working." Sherlock pouted.
For the most part John was allowed to dictate the speed to his liking. Sherlock only whispering monosyllabic suggestions from time to time when John went to chase his pleasure too fiercely and come too soon. He would mutter, "slow, deep, long, fast," in perfect orchestration to stretch out John's lust until it became brittle and crystalline. Just the shy edge of too much.
By the 167th step, John was surprised to find that he was still keeping pace quite easily with Charles, as opposed to yesterday, when it had felt as though he was being led to his doom by the Reaper himself. Today John had to physically restrain himself from bolting straight on past him to get to Sherlock first.
"I'm alright. It's just been a while since I've had to discuss this sort of stuff, y'know? Might be a bit rusty." John devoted himself to the careful consideration of their alcoholic options. If this was going to be a poignant time in their relationship, a turning point, he felt they needed something special to celebrate it with. The truffled drinks from The Jolly Bulldog hadn't even followed him home and John could hold his liquor.
"Hmnn." John breathed indiscriminately, having to blink his vision back into focus. He squinted down at Sherlock with one eye pinched shut. Grinning widely. Playing the game. "Anything else?"
Sherlock's eyes raised at that, took one look at John's cheeky grin and went back to his work with his lips fighting a smug smile.
But there is a loud slurping in answer and John looks over to find his own come being lapped out of Sherlock's palm. John's mouth drops open to witness it. He must have caught it when John had orgasmed and is now licking it out from between his fingers with a soft pink tongue.
"Fuck me." John's brain overtakes his manners. "Fuck me, please."
Morose with his head full of the all the devastating ideas of what Sherlock's beautiful features may curdle into at the news of John's failure, when a familiar and terrible screaming ripped through the air and was silenced just as swiftly with the deft plock! of a butcher's blade.
The door swung wide and John was ready to ask. To argue. To repent (if need be).
"You are my type." He tilted his head like a puppy that didn't know what the question it'd just been asked had actually meant. "I'm choosing you because /you/ are what I want."
He didn't wait for the response as he threw a pan on the hob and tried to ignore the racing thumps in his chest. It was only until he emerged to get Sherlock's attention with greasy spatula in hand, that John found Sherlock sitting on the floor by the front door, his gown a silken pool around him.
if you like.
John's motionlessness spurred Sherlock to explain further with an exasperated sigh. "You have my word that it's well acclimated to people, John. It came from a family farm to be sold at the Covent Garden Market for Christmas. It needs fed. Before you run off and abandon me."
"A friend?" John asked, nodding his head towards the object. Sherlock was standing a little ways away from him now, his back towards his room. He had his eyes locked on John's face, dissecting every twitch of his expression, wanting to know desperately what John thought of him and his eccentricities. It had been a very long while since he had willingly let someone into this room whose opinion he truly cared about.
"We're going out tonight." Sherlock said instead. Pulling a large garment bag on a hanger from behind his back. It was impressive that he was able to hide such a thing behind his Belstaff. Almost. That coat was rather huge.
It took a long while for John's legs to hold his weight again. He'd managed to shoo Sherlock from the bathroom after several reassurances that he was fine and a joke that he'd need to be alone in order to properly clean himself up again. But when the door had closed behind him, John had had to move quickly to rebrace himself against the vanity before his trembling legs could drop him.
Sherlock shot upright at that, on his feet before the front legs of the chair could clatter down and he was pressed nose-to-nose with the doctor, practically bending him backwards against the countertop. "Do not mince my words, John Watson." Sherlock warned him. "You are the least cowardly person I have ever met. And it would not do you well to believe otherwise."
Seeing no other option available to him, John set his jaw and dutifully downed the tea. One grimaced mouthful at a time.
Sherlock slumped back into the couch, crossing his arms over his chest. His knees resuming their bounce.
"Prince Sherlock is ready to receive you now."
Sherlock growled suddenly, cutting off his sentence. His fingers flashing open in irritation. "Must you insist on calling me 'your Highness' every time?! If this is to be our new arrangement, you and I will both find it incredibly tiresome to hear at the end of everything."
"And new, yes." Miles smiled that 1000 watt smile.
"Sherlock?" He said evenly, needing to know, licking his lips. "Why are you asking me this?"
"Oh well. I'm sure you will. I'm still certain it represents what you mean to him. You're his /rock/." She nodded as though her opinion on this was infallible. "You've done my Sherlock a lot of good, John Hamish Watson. He might never say it, but he loves you very much. I can tell."
John realized this was the first time Sherlock had seen where he worked, but he didn't know what Sherlock had made of it.
As he spoke, the trio had reached the autopsy room and Sherlock threw the doors open dramatically, before turning immediately on the spot, frowning. "Lestrade? Where's the body?"
"Transport, John. Remember?" Sherlock sniffed, his tone reluctant, as if he were testing how angry John really was at him.
Silence.
"Sherlock. I can't write in Japanese." He said, already opening their e-mail.
It stopped for another rest on the top of the castle keep after another hundred feet up, where the heart of Appledore used to reside and tarried only briefly, before heading for its final destination. As if unwilling to stay near such a hollow place.
The pressure of Sherlock's tongue on the third attempt was absolute genius. It lapped and swirled, formed tight into a blunt tip to skirt along the alley of flesh between cock and anus. John's hips rocked spasmodically as Sherlock strayed close to his hole, crying out in surprise when he came too near. His sweaty palm having to readjust its hold on his knee as it had begun to slip.
