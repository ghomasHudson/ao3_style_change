“Mmm. The man has his points. But you know I don’t involve myself with their petty fights. One will win, won’t they, and one will lose. We’ve seen this countless times before; we know how this works. I’m quite surprised your brother is abroad in this trying time.”
." Jim scoffs, shoving his hands in his pockets. "I hate that word. Rules. Implies I have someone to answer to…"
"Stop, alright!
Together, they grasp at either end and turn the body onto its back. John wipes his dampened hands against his trousers, gritty from river silt and sand, as Lestrade opens the tarp. Dark smells permeate the air, smells of grimy river water, of dirt and the waterlogged commencement of decay.
“What about the other half?”
"Would you like to know what he's saying?" Mikheia asked, turning to the bored detective.
“—But fuck it all if it doesn’t help.” John finishes, grabbing my face in his hands now and kissing me so hard we might fuse together at high heat. He tastes of boiling ocean, hot and wet and thick with salt.
"This ain't a book, fella. Life is full of unaccounted variables. Like me hanging you from this tree."
Mikheia smiled.
The sun rises, as it always has. The day begins, as it always has.
“I assure you, Sherlock, it was not my idea.” Mycroft says, and then adds sourly: “He punched me as well. Damn near ruined a perfectly good shirt.”
“You…are you alright?” He asked weakly, leaning against the wall of the house as he stared down at his husband.
—knew him like I did. I knew him inside and out. I knew his heart."
“Another time, then?” Irene calls, and he scowls, though she can’t see it.
“Just me?” He asks, gaze turning back to Quinn. “Or were there others?”
And then it began. Sometime in March, near the end of his second tour, his story started. On his last mundane entry, he talked of needing more swabs and antiseptic and then mentioned that he would see action soon since the numbers were running a little low due to those leaving at the end of their tour.
"If you two are quite done," Sherlock bites, "I have investigating to do. Honestly Lestrade, with me doing your job, I still can't believe you get paid for things like this..."
“No, he didn’t,” John says, moving away to unbutton his shirt, opening it to smooth skin. “See? He didn’t touch me.”
“She died a week ago, I’ve had time to get over it, thanks.”
That is the last thing he says for a while.
"John Hamish Watson," Sherlock's voice was raw, scraped by desperation. "If you've gone and let Moran give you a bloody concussion I won't let you shag me again for a month, do you hear me?"
“Unacceptable. I won’t.”
fact that John is not here after the dead man and the prisoner.
Sherlock took a step back, his omniscient eyes taking in everything; John's hunched posture as if he wanted to collapse in on himself, the emptiness of his voice, the darkness in his eyes, the sudden twitch in his leg, everything. He knew in that moment that he had done irreparable harm to the person he loved most and who loved him and he knew in that moment that the one seemingly insignificant breath he had blown all the way back in Bruges had hit them both like a gale-force wind and sent their house of cards crashing down.
Saul Bellow
!" Sherlock shouted, his voice echoing through the silence. He raised his gun, easy enough to obtain, and even easier to steal. He'd have to thank Mikheia later for his suspension of good conscience. "Why don't you come out and face me and stop hiding in the shadows?"
“No, I’ve got to get in to work soon. Thanks, though. I was just wondering why Sherlock here hasn’t been answering my texts.”
“What question?”
"You think it's treachery, what we did?"
John leaned on the railing again, shutting his eyes to the wind as he exhaled heavily.
"He must have gotten word that I suspected where his base of business was."
For a moment Sherlock didn’t know what to say, didn’t know what John wanted to hear, until he decided it no longer mattered. His eyes narrowed; he would not be muzzled by whatever inconvenient discussion John seemed to be both encouraging and dismissing at the same time. It was rather unsettling to see him so hesitant.
New data. Correlate, analyse, proceed with extreme caution. Subject is volatile.
“No, it’s more like a—like a—oh fuck you lot and your words, they’re no good when you need them…” She rubs her head, as if to draw the word out. “A placenta!” She bursts out.
“Uh…yeah, a dense wood like…pine, or something?”
Later.
"But the initial anger at said event should abate at least by the first year—"
"Most people do not like sugar in their liquids. More importantly, most people do not remember such inconsequential things about their friends." He said with a grin. "That means either you are attentive, which I do not greatly doubt, or you do not have many friends to remember things about, so you like to memorise the little things, which I also do not greatly doubt."
“Mine has.” Sherlock says quietly as he looks up, and Mycroft can see years of dependency crumbling in his eyes.
A hand rests on his shoulder. John’s skin is smooth under his wet palm. Feels like wind, like the softness of air.
"Thank you."
The lights began to flash above him like it had been someone's idea of imitating a mediocre nightclub, but John knew what it meant. They were about to quarantine the wing he was in.
“Right.” He nods, and then nods again. “Right. Sod this, I’ve had it—”
“Alright.” He said quietly. “Alright. I can’t believe I’m doing this
"What do you do in your free time?" Sherlock asked quietly.
, I—” His gaze snaps suddenly to John. “Wait, what?”
He glances around and stifles the disappointed frown. They all have a light to lead them, and he has himself. He has his clues and his deductions and they have their faith, which, essentially, are the same things.
He who was living is now dead
John stumbled out of the church into a side alley and collapsed on his knees, ready to lose his stomach on the pavement, but instead got stuck dry-heaving a breakfast he hadn't eaten. He didn't like to eat before he went out on an assignment. It made him feel slow and heavy. He'd learned his lesson in Barcelona after a particularly taxing paella that nearly led to him getting his head blown off by an irate coke dealer whom John had personally requested because of his known history of woman and child abuse.
“It was only for a few weeks, John, honestly—”
fine, unhurt, but John knows he's good at hiding what he's feeling.
“What may I call you?”
"The target was a no-show. I'm off the clock and therefore free to feel upset." John huffed.
"Is that how you classify love, sir?"
Silence swells inside the room, cresting against the ceiling before settling back to the floor.
"So, what is stopping you?"
He heads down the hall, waiting until he hears the conversation begin again before he carefully turns the bathroom light on and, while still in the hall, shuts the door. Pausing a moment, he holds out his hand and, with a sharp tingling moment of concentration, shifts the lock until he hears the bolt slide into place. He turns to head down the stairs, willing each step to remain solid and quiet under his feet.
"What—what else did Mary tell you?"
"I don't care. You were surviving."
"Are you a monster, Sherlock Holmes?"
Sherlock frowned. “Why are you so determined to prove me wrong?”
The church was well built, structurally sound, and had a pleasant darkness about it. Everything was wooden and old and creaked like the church's old bones when it got up in the morning. Sherlock quite liked old, wooden, creaky things. He liked the idea that someone once sat where he sat and was just as bored as he was. The brotherhood of the bored, externally coerced churchgoers.
He blinked, the fog clearing. John had led him into a chair in a dark corner. The water seemed closer, and as he came back to himself, he realized they were in some lower level below the deck, away from the clamor upstairs.
What else could he do? He opened his mouth, and screamed.
"Gladstone." Sherlock calls and the wolf turns its head to him. "Attack."
He returns his attention to his food and Sherlock stares at him bemusedly.
“Together?
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asked, wary. “You only just got to Karachi.”
As John ran through the bazaar a standing display toppled into his path and he vaulted over it, ignoring the burns of his still-healing wounds if it meant catching this man, if it meant erasing the grey from the world. He felt the burn of adrenaline, the hammer of his heart, the delicious slow burn in his lungs—
Sherlock, after he had shaken off the initial shock, had been sure to check.
"If I didn't get off from thoughts of your death, why would your injuries be any different since they brought you that much closer to that particular fantasy becoming a reality?"
The first time Sherlock had proposed, it had been said almost as an afterthought. The air was full of the smell of brackish water, burnt gunpowder, woodsmoke, the dull waters of the Thames lapping at the bridge as the two of them prepared to breach the Tower of London.
"Would
“My apologies,” Sherlock answered, picking the piece back up and placing it on the board. “I do believe it’s your turn.”
opinion.”
"What?"
"Shh." She soothes, smoothing down the hair at his temple before pressing her lips to his. Every cell in his body seems to revolt at the touch when a day ago he would have welcomed it. Now all he can do is think of Sherlock and how much more he wants him here.
"May I ask how you received your injury?"
"The others?" Lestrade asks, utterly bemused, as Holmes scrapes the particle onto a clean slide, holding it up under his magnifying lens. His eye grows large under the warped glass.
"Anyways," John continues, sipping his water. "Just because I can't get anything nutritionally from it doesn't mean I can't enjoy it."
John stood, trailing after the prince as they left the salon, walking through the vaulted, ornate halls of the palace; something in the corners of his eyes was always gilded.
Moriarty rolled his eyes. “A dog will answer to anything. I suppose he heard his master calling and came to heel.”
There is a light at the end of the hall, a beam from a lighthouse in the middle of a rocky ocean. Rooms exit off of the corridor like grottos, silent and still with sleeping sharks.
The black hole widens.
"With what?" The man's head turned, slathering his face in shadow. "Money?"
John shakes his head, grimacing as a particularly painful dig. “Where’s Sherlock, anyways? Shouldn’t he be here nagging at us? Or at least holding my hand?”
"Hopefully by dawn."
"We didn't share." The voice smirked. "Usually one of us won and one lost. Never in-between."
. Press send.
I can't see the light anymore. The stars are far away. The water smells of salt and sweat and greenness. I might stay here forever, staring up at the stars, here in the cold.
know, I did it myself. A test, of sorts."
“You’ve got Wilde paraphrased then, have you?”
"Well I meant to get him in the head, then. Do good intentions count?" John asked with an unhappy grin.
? That parched, dark hole in the pit of the cosmos?"
“No.” Sherlock shook his head, checking the chamber, still loaded with the one bullet. “Harry must have taken it in her coat, put it there when we weren’t watching. She planned this, John.”
Mikheia's hand found the light and he turned it on.
"What would you like me to say?"
“To you, perhaps.”
The sound of John's ragged breathing cuts through the heavy silence. Sherlock's hand strokes his face. His fingers are trembling.
John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. There was still blood crusted in his cuticles.
"No," John laughs. "Nothing like that. I'm Canadian."
“Hey, Jim.” Seb asks, dabbing at his mouth. “You know Moran’s looking for you, right? He called me yesterday. Looking for his half of the cash.”
"While this foreplay is absolutely enthralling, gentlemen," Irene droned, "we do have other things to think of right now. Namely, an actual plan."
"What?"
John looked at him silently before he answered, unwaveringly calm and quiet, powerful in his certainty.
"Unlikely. I can't stomach cannibalism; eating the body and blood of a dead man. I'm more of a soy-based product fan myself. Much more humane."
“No,” A voice says from behind them, “Nothing like it.”
John had never thought before to call a kiss beautiful. There were some that had been good or fantastic even, but this,
"Sherlock? Sherlock, what happened?" Lestrade asks, out of breath as he slides to his knees beside Sherlock in a wet squelch. "Jesus." He hisses as he sees John, groaning and squirming as he tries to move. "What do we do?"
"My cynicism was never the characteristic I wished to advertise yet always is the one that seems the most evident." Sherlock says lowly, almost as if in apology.
"Your—your parcel, it is there—" She pointed to the counter and John marvelled at her dedication. Whatever it was, it must be important, otherwise—
"You've got a point, there." John said with a sad grin. Mary looked down at him for a moment.
"Don't be fat and stupid Mycroft, you're only good at doing one." Sherlock snapped as he turned around and Mycroft sighed.
"What changed?"
"Who said I wanted to?"
Sherlock took one sparse second to stare at John, who was moving to stand and help Mikheia, before he turned and bolted out into the night.
"Name's John. Pleased to meet your acquaintance."
“Oh? Enlighten me, please.”
And then, John began to laugh.
Zlata Branković, who worked at the front desk, thought the two British men were alright. Handsome, nice, polite (or the shorter one was, rather. The tall one could do to learn some manners).
The voice comes from somewhere away from him, and there’s a great clutter of sound on the far end of the room as new logs are added to the fire.
Someone steps forward and blocks his view of the light.
The bathroom door is shut, locked, but light spills from underneath it.
Footsteps. The light blaring into his vision turns to a cherry red. He shuts his eyes against it, but it burns through his eyelids; just like looking towards the sun with your eyes closed.
"John—"
"Will you ever tell me how you got that?" Sherlock asked, staring at the spider scar crawling along Mikheia's collarbone.
Sherlock did not like snow, so, naturally, he now found himself in the city that was on record as having the highest annual snowfall; 9.3 metres of snow per year. Disgusting. He didn't care for sunny days either, but this,
Silence.
John’s wings were mounted before him like a stag’s head, like a prize of some beast he’d hunted–and he supposed, in some way, yes, he had hunted John, and he’d killed him— and he was tracing the feathers through the glass when the shelves began to burst apart.
Hobbling, he lifts Mikheia, who seems to come to some ration of sense, and starts to bolt down the sloping lawn. Adrenaline courses unnoticed through his bloodstream, numbing the pain of his leg, making the scar on his shoulder buzz like blood rushing back into a waking limb.
She glanced up at the ceiling.
John stared at their joined hands for a moment, then raised his eyes to look at his mate, who was gazing into the darkness, his brow furrowed.
Sherlock feels his heart lurch.
“A girl can only go so far in heels.” She answers with an arched eyebrow. She’s herself today, or whichever form the one that rose from the bathtub is, dressed in a tight dawn blue dress with a cream overcoat gilded with gold lining and sporting large, dark sunglasses and thigh high black boots.
The light becomes tainted, dulls like an eclipse, becomes like the blindness that comes after the sun. He has stopped falling, but he remains motionless. Floating.
The flat is oddly quiet. John must be waiting in their room, formerly his room, though he was keen to share.
, considering the source. Here’s a man who did everything Moriarty told him to, yet seems not to have done so out of loyalty and certainly not out of money. So what is it? What is
"Sherlock."
He would follow the Golem; that much he knew already.
“A barrier,
Art thieves were the more careless breed of robbers. They figure no one ever misses an old piece of Grecian pottery or a lesser painting. How pedantic.
Mikheia nods, and lets the conversation settle between them like disturbed river silt.
"Doesn't mean I'm not."
“Sherlock. Do you have any idea what ‘Fire Walk With Me’ means?”
John held out a hand to interrupt him. “I know you didn’t mean to, just…hold on a moment, alright? I’ve sat on this thing for months now, turning it over and over, what I’d say to you, what you’d say to me, how I’d handle all of this…Let me say just say it and be done, please.”
John, the inhuman, is the most human part of him.
It's not Moriarty, of course.
Sherlock stared at him a moment, chewing his words.
"It's what I'm meant to do, I think." John murmurs.
John chewed a moment, thinking.
“How, exactly, is being found unresponsive in the snow outside of the Bolshoi handling yourself? What if he comes back?”
"You're worth more than being Kibbles and Bits to a pack of supernatural wolves." Sherlock says lowly. "You are worth
John looks up at Sherlock as the voice spoke his name, but Sherlock doesn't move. The voice is soft, deep, like the undercurrent in the ocean threatening to churn into riptide.
Sherlock wills his ears to shut as tightly as his eyes are, but he can’t block out Not-John’s laugh.
He didn't look over as Sherlock joined him, sitting beside him and unfolding those great gangly legs to drop over the side. The two of them, perched on the edge of the world, ready to jump after the other into the night.
"John—" Sherlock reaches for him but he shrink away, against the bed.
something inside. I can hear it."
Sherlock paused, letting his fingers linger over a newly placed bandage.
An hour later, the three stood outside an
"Do you have motives yet?" John asks Lestrade as they watch Sherlock examine the body.
But the agency had taught him to take those details and read into them. Something Sherlock hadn't had the time for before his departure (it was just a departure, John told himself when he ate alone, worked alone, woke alone).
“Relevance, John.”
“You know what I mean.”
The drumming was back in his head like it never left. That drumming that drove him to heroin so he could tune it out. That drumming that ceased as he turned his head and in that silent echo glanced at the small soldier in that hideous jumper, staring at him from between cop cars with a bent cabbie's blood on his hands.
. Can I have another?”
The first thing he noticed was the open window, the curtains still fluttering in the damp wind from where they lay, torn off the rack in the struggle.
"A bit, yeah."
She slid the pewter chalice towards him in invitation, and his mind flashed backwards, to Norway, to that dark manse, to the same offer that had led them all here, down the winding and painful path.
"Didn't he, Sherlock?"
It was the grey that caught his eyes, his gaze snagging on those ash coloured swaths of clothing.
“I can’t say I was surprised.” Moriarty raised an eyebrow. “You fell much faster than I had anticipated.”
“Damn!” She slams on the breaks, stopping at a red light.
Sherlock stared back at him.
"Apple juice ain't really my cup of tea, if you catch my meaning."
“Yes. I know.”
"I would still bury them. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't stop looking for one."
Sherlock comes home in the middle of their conversation. He seems surprised that Mycroft would take his claim seriously, or at least enough to leave his chair and investigate it himself. Mycroft notices that his brother looks at John like a toy he doesn't feel particularly inclined to share; like he thinks Mycroft will take him away.
“You may have more than that: I will be leaving, as I do believe I am needed elsewhere, but I ask that you do not make a mess, or, more preferably, that you will clean up after.” She said, shooting a pointed look across the table.
He's already called Mycroft.
"Just now? Everything that had happened since I left you, and not just in Bruges. Everything since the day you began working for the agency. Every assignment you've had, every talk the two of you've had in the café I believe is called The Drop-Off, every city you've been to, which, coincidentally, we tended to occupy at the same time and remained unaware of each other. I believe that, through information supplied by Mycroft, Mary took it upon herself to assign you cases that correlated with wherever I was at the time in the hopes that we might run into each other."
Sherlock scowled at her, flyaway hair curling madly from the humidity coming from the canal as it cooled in the night.
She smiles ruefully. “There’s no way—you can’t know.” She shakes her head as if to throw off the memory, and looks at him. “It’s something your world won’t understand, even if you wanted to know. You can’t comprehend what it’s like, and how heavy the burden is once you’re out from under it. Here, it’s so…so
Something in him snaps then. It feels odd, to attack the one he loves most yet hates more than anything in that moment.
just overlook them all."
“Why?”
"They're off raising hell in the hills." Hope said, scratching his beard as he walked past them, his gait slightly wobbly. "Don't know whereabouts."
Mikheia…you beautiful electrical circuit.
Sherlock frowned, looking up at her. "A copycat?"
“Not every day you see angels.” He says quietly.
The smile disappears from his face as quickly as it came, leaving this changed, greyer John in its wake.
“I’d rather the latter; Moran will be at the Seventh Congress of Soviets.”
“What the fuck is it with you two and fire?” Moran snarls, peering through his scope although Mikehia is only feet from him.
“Witnesses.”
Mikheia paused, chewing his food thoughtfully.
Jim sighs heavily. “I already gave him half.”
Tears began to drip down John's face. Why now…why ever? But he didn't stop them. He didn't want to. He had never given Sherlock the opportunity of seeing him like this, he had been careful to hide it, so why stop now? What stood in his way?
live without you." Sherlock said. "I want no part of a life without you and, if given the chance and we can't escape it, I want to die with you. If you go then so do I."
"While you're in this state of discovery," Sherlock says, scrolling through his phone. "Might I ask what sights you want to see?"
“John!”
are going to stay out here until I'm done—"
“My children—all three—they live in Mostar. I think I was a good father enough for a roof over my heads,
John had gone to Moscow. His letters to Sherlock at the time had been hopeful, but wary. He had known what was going on in the public consciousness in Russia, but stuck around for a few years, circling the dying imperial court and the high society fetes, going to underground meetings, consorting with the street smart and the strong as well as the upper crust and cultured. Sherlock had been optimistic, until the revolution came, turning quickly into all-out war, and Denikin began his march on the city. John had only gotten out by the skin of his teeth, and a little literally at that, as it turned out.
He aligned his scope.
"I do not
They caught a show. A local band, nothing too ostentatious. Billy met them at the bar, beer in hand, and they sat at a table in the corner, far enough away for privacy, all three wearing sunglasses to hide their eyes.
"Johnson-Hait…" Lestrade mutters. "Why does that sound so familiar?"
he died."
No, he thought of war.
“They’re still waiting on it. The medical system isn’t as organised here.”
Fortunately, Zlata didn't know much English. She may have fainted dead away if she had. She knew quite well what they were doing, though, if the rhythmic thumping was any indication. She'd always insisted to her uncle, the manager, that the headboards were flimsy…
“Then allow me to make myself clear,” Sherlock snarls with sudden vehemence as he rounds on her. “You are a commodity, nothing more. I only tolerate your presence because you have latched onto James like a tick, and I need his help, so I must accommodate space for you. This does not mean I want you around, nor do I crave your attempts at what you perceive to be high-class sophistry. To me, you are a body in a room sucking in air, and nothing more. Kindly, leave me alone. Go eat dinner with James.”
Sherlock considered the board, then moved his matching pawn against Moriarty’s.
"It's quite simple. Rather pedestrian actually. You, Jefferson Hope, are a stagecoach hand turned thief who fancies yourself a criminal genius. You've been skimming the pot because in what world would the Great Garridebs notice a bottom-sucker like you dipping his hand in the kitty every now and then? It's harmless, enough to buy another drink, another girl, distractions. But you got sloppy. And then you got caught."
“Even with the fangs that’s not what you saw. Not exactly anyways.”
Sherlock stares over steepled fingers at the heart, that stiff, tough mass of muscle. It sits on the kitchen table—"On a napkin, please!" John had demanded, although why that mattered when there had been far worse things on the table's surface Sherlock didn't know (John likes small comforts he reminds himself, so he quietly acquiesces)—lonely and dead. The epitome of human existence, laid out on a paper towel in the flat of a stranger it had never beaten in front of. In the deeper parts of his imagination, Sherlock liked to believe it was smudged in ink like it reflected its owner's personality. John's would be something dabbed with something nice and pleasant like heavy cream or laundry detergent or rich earth that fine wine grew in.
He turns suddenly and rushes from the room, grabbing his coat as he shrugs it on.
“We don’t quite have empirical proof on the werewolf yet, but with Jesus locked up in the pantry we haven’t had to go to the grocer’s in weeks, although we are getting a bit sick of bread and fish.” Sherlock smirks and John stifles a laugh into his mug.
He stood, forgetting where he was, focusing on that gun tucked away in the hem of his pants, focusing on the burn of the wounds that still hadn't fully healed.
of self-control? John Watson is the type to hit people that offend him, to wear his heart on his sleeve, and you seem to think that in his absence I will adopt some of his characteristics. You are most indubitably wrong. John Watson is an inimitable man, and I can assure you that all of his mannerisms will remain so. You also stated that I needed to 'think of John', as if it's not occurred to you that I have done nothing else for the past few hours, let alone every moment I can spare since I've met him. Do you really think that I would be so careless that I would risk John's safety? That I would let some rat like
Sherlock was about to send his caution out the window and rush downstairs when the door opened and John came in, trying to balance two cups of coffee as he pulled his phone out.
Lestrade looks at him for a moment, and he knows that, despite what Sherlock claims, he’s every bit as human as the next man. John’s absence will be sorely felt tonight.
"And I will as well," John replied back. "Now," he said, standing and dragging his mate up with him. "I think we've got ourselves a monster to catch."
"Pot." Irene gestured to herself, then to him. "Kettle. You're never going to get anywhere with him, or yourself, if you don't address what's really happening."
"You act like the people you love mean nothing to you, Mr Holmes, but we both know they mean everything—"
“And what is it that you tell them?” Sherlock asks, eyes ponderously passing over the titles on Mortimer’s shelves. Even in the kitchen the man has a large bookshelf, cornered between the table and the wall.
Blood dripped onto the floor, on wet tiles and shards of shattered glass that made an abstract of two men, one bloodied and tense, the other desperate and still.
He never had a problem with loneliness before.
"Too late. I already took it from you. It's like a disease and you've been innoculated. Absolved, even. You can't get it again. I either pass it on or let it burn me from the inside out and there's nothing you can do but watch. You should've known better than to let me in since this is was it will lead to."
John takes a swig of coffee before answering, as if to steel himself.
"Do you remember how the agency gave me drugged gum?"
“Yes, Cila. She is an attending nurse.”
Sherlock breathes heavily as he examines her arm, following the trim of ink around to her palm. “The paper’s been stuck to her skin with a mix of flour and water, the papier mâche method. It was done post mortem.”
, that happened to you from the moment you were on Bart’s roof to now, or I swear to God, Sherlock, I will get my things and I will go home and will not be there if you try to find me.”
“Condolences.” He replies bitingly. “Grief does that to people.”
Suddenly, Sherlock can't seem to run to the parlour fast enough.
"You know, when I go back to Novgorod, I will tell my friends of our adventures and they will not believe me. They will think I am telling a pale lie."
“Nothing that should concern you overtly. You might hurt yourself. We wouldn’t want that, would we?”
"False." Moriarty hums, leaning closer to Sherlock. "He is your heart. He makes you bleed and burn and love. And run. You'd better run, Sherly. Who knows what will happen to him, left all alone? Unattended?"
"Pink." The detective says suddenly.
In the mirror, from every angle, his eyes are rimmed in red, blurry with irritated wetness. Life continues on in the blue-bruising streets behind him. The castle’s night lights have come up, casting everything in a golden glow.
“Graceful as ever, I see.” Mycroft sniffs, sitting down without preamble. “Good to see that hasn’t changed.”
“We are ghosts. Sherlock...he most likely thinks that we are dead.”
“Or before you decide to move your lazy arse and do them yourself.”
"Yes."
"I'm…I'm quite fond of sharing a flat. And that's the only time those words will ever be in that particular order."
“My best attempts are nothing compared to human ineptitude. In my wildest dreams I could never have hoped for this to happen – trying to take down one of ours with
“Think of what John did.”
“That’s what I’m afraid of.” John answers, and Mikheia frowns. “Sherlock doesn’t like to owe him anything—”
"'All our purifications are done in fire, by fire, and with fire,'" Sherlock quotes. "The death of Jane Samson was the introduction, but not the first step, or perhaps the two are pairs since Calcination, the burning of the soul to purify it for the coming transformation, is usually represented by the Red Lion or the King being burned alive or sitting inside a sweat box. Fitting, as metaphorically this matches both images."
He’s trying to sink back into the recesses of his mind, trying to shy away from this constant onslaught of light, but it’s burning him, burning right into his brain, coring him down to a supreme consciousness that can’t seem to be evaded.
at the forefront, nor am I the most credible. Hell, all of my dissertations have been scorned or laughed at!”
Sherlock groaned. John tasted.
"I suspected that you'd been carrying your gun with you, John, but I must say that it is quite handy."
"Aw," she tsks, "Bob! Look what you made me do!"
He only knew how to speak in force. If he didn’t get his way, force it was. This new FBI bloodhound—or whoever he was—was in his way, like an eclipse looming on the horizon, slowly floating forward to block him out. Snuff out the light.
John doesn't respond for a moment, staring at the ceiling as the washcloth on his heat sponges up heat. Wearily, he reaches a hand up and takes the now warm cloth off and tosses it in the laundry hamper. He sighs, wiping his face and dragging the water droplets into his spiky dark blonde hair, making some ends stick up. Wordlessly, Sherlock hands him a new one, as if conjured out of thin air. He nods his thanks and presses it to his face.
Sherlock ripped John's shirt off, sending it the floor with a wet squelch, exposing a chest coated in fresh blood that flowed over wounds and around congealed, sticky globs of previously shed blood that hadn't been cleaned off. Mikheia ran in, the bowl in his hands steaming in the dark room. The blood soaking into the floor shone black in the golden light coming in from the hallway.
"Just wondering, generally. I feel like we don't know that much about you." John shrugs with a grin.  "I can stitch, you can draw. Sherlock can play the violin, you can hotwire a car. It's just...good to know other people's skills sometimes. You never know when you'd need them."
"Right," John yawns, turning his head to the side. "And I suppose next you'll have me giving you head in a dog costume."
"Why did you take him?" Sherlock asks lowly. "Why, if you want to turn yourself in?"
Sherlock's hands fell from John's shoulders. Seeing his face as the words tumbled out of his mouth turned the light, buzzing heat to a leaden, still ice.
"You will never see me dead again, John. I promise."
In his blindness, overcome momentarily with disappointment, Kita sweeps her free foot, catching him in the knee and sending him down, but he takes her with him, his grip unwavering. She tries to free the knife but he holds onto it, feeling the blade bite into his palm. He tugs on her arm, feeling the pop of dislocation and she is too proud to scream, which is a pity, because then her soldiers would come to her aid. Her pride might be the death of her, and he wants to say we are the same but instead he tightens his hand around the knife, slippery with his blood, and grapples it from her hand. Kita stills as he holds it to her throat, the two of them struggling for breath. The sea life printed on her trembles with rough waves.
—something’s wrong, something’s not right—why is he getting heavier, why won’t someone
It could be for someone else; another vampire, crossing into his territory, or an old fight returning again. It could mean anything, and he didn’t know where to start.
.” He hisses back.
"No. I—" Mikheia rubbed the back of his head nervously. "It is not something I am proud of and therefore I try not to talk about it so that I may enjoy a clean and squeaky reputation, but before I became a translator, I was involved in some not so honest business. When I was younger I worked as a drug runner, but as I got older I usually stuck to robbing tourists since it seemed to be something that I was particularly good at."
“It is your noose. It tightens when you are in danger, makes you aware that it is there, that is something in you that you can lose. When you are safe, when you can breathe again, you forget that it was ever there, until it pulls at you again. I do not know it was an object for trade until I met you and your Sherlock.”
John chuckled, watching as a blonde woman disappeared behind heavy red drapes. “What makes you think I want any of them?”
Sherlock lets the beast lay its hulking skull in his lap as he absentmindedly strokes the soft fur. His hands are shaking, curled around the small metal pipe he'd grabbed from the water, clung to as he was dragged away from John, from where he disappeared into the water. A low, broken whimper stutters from his lips before he can stop it. He wonders if this is what being broken feels like, a slow crack appearing in a used pane of glass, the final blow that shatters him.
"You'll have to drink the absolutely revolting tea my father makes."
Sherlock's head twitched to the side slightly, as if he was shaking his head.
It fits.
Sherlock sighed, exhaling smoke into the rushing wind from his isolated spot in the back of the train. Apparently they had been fortunate enough to book one of the last trains that still had an open air carriage and it was, of course, bound for Sarajevo.
He snuffles into Sherlock’s neck and he feels an arm wrap protectively around his torso, gentle with trepidation.
* * *
"Mary, I'm in the Kremlin. They did something to me while I was unconscious and I had to break out and steal some poor woman's trousers. I don't know what they've done to me."
This was no different.
"So it's…a magic punchbowl?"
Sherlock had emerged from the room an hour ago, his eyes gravid with exhaustion and heavy from something other than sleep. He hadn't yet taken a shower, his shirt stained with the same blood that formed a sticky paste in his hair.
Slowly, light begins to build in the laver, shining through in pockets and slashes, illuminating the roughly carved characters. Harry's grip on his hand tightens.
“It can be, sometimes. When you hide things.” He said, watching as Sherlock shrugged out of his shirt. “Give it here. You’ll just crease it.”
John pauses a moment, trying to pull anything useful from the ether of blurred images. Rachel’s grey face from the coroner’s report. A face in his window. A red neon sign.
? What do you mean weeks?” He blanches, suddenly white-knuckling the netbook. “He’s not—”
They melt together, as they always have.
, Sherlock knew his brother acquiesced. He had known when he had dialled Mycroft's number and he had known when they met in whatever broken down building of his brother's choosing that Mycroft would say yes to him.
"Kate's dead, Irene." He said bluntly. "I saw it happen. There's no coming back from that."
Sherlock scoffs. Mycroft's ability to be insufferable is a god-given talent.
Because after Sarajevo his brother became a man with nothing left to lose who kept being reminded of the fact, who kept having it dumped in his hands again only to trickle through his fingers like sand.
." Jim snaps his head up and grins crookedly. "I've just remembered, I've got a joke, Johnny. Been saving it for a while, just for you, see. Okay…two adulterers walk into a bar, followed by a thief, a Pagan who carves figures of the Buddha, and a murderer." Moriarty rattles them off his fingers, a smile growing on his face. "They all sit separately, and—ha—" He breaks into a fit of giggles. "And a half hour later, a pack of wolves come and—ha—and
He watches his brother’s attention devour the screen, and wonders if this is it, if this is how far unchecked he has allowed his affections to go. He is staring at it as if it is the one thing in the whole world he needs, as if his existence hinges on it. This table holds the one thing Sherlock Holmes cares about the most, and this one thing is an ocean and circumstance away.
Mycroft sighs heavily.
Still, he couldn't staunch the acidic hurt that dripped itself through his body. Being used by someone unexpected stung his pride on its own (however unexpected Mycroft could truly be, John couldn't say), but it was a superficial wound when compared to being lied to and used in that order by someone he loved.
"You're smarter than most, John. Why do you think?" Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "We had to get the blood off you. I treated you respectfully, if that's what you're worried about. No one laughed at you. I wasn't in a particularly
“Temporary is too long, John.”
"Netko mora." She responds quietly, her voice carrying through the silent room.
"Have you?"
It’s the sound of the drill that brings him fully to attention. There’s a soft laugh in front of him, but he doesn’t need to open his eyes to know they’ve bagged him. The burlap warms with each breath.
“For what it mattered it was. I’d been waiting for that moment. I knew it. I knew it was going to happen. I knew you were going to die because of me.” He buries his head in his hands, curls inking against his skin. “Ever since Bart’s. I knew it. I knew it.”
In the morning, I'll call you
"Yes, there was certainly lots of thunder when you arrived here." Sherlock says dryly and John laughs.
, John, I could do this for hours."
"What did he want?"
“Yes?” Quinn’s voice comes from behind him as he moves around the kitchen.
“It pleases me.” He said simply. “Follow me, if you will.”
The mouth grins, a wet, shiny red.
.” He kneels and holds out his hand as the dog drops it into his palm. Under the dirt and slobber, he can feel grooves so he grabs a fistful of melting snow and rubs it over the abandoned fruit until the red shines through. Someone’s carved something into the face.
Sherlock stares at the picture of the corpse.
John doesn’t trust his voice, so he nods, one time.
As he grazed Sherlock's sleeve, John was sucked into the surface
“What do you mean? You’re saying he
What would his be covered in?
a necessity.”
Moran.
“It’s over.” John repeats, bringing his free hand back again to touch Sherlock’s face. The detective leans into the touch.
"To activate an ostium," Mortimer sighs, pinching his nose, "You need three things, three very,
--//--
Sherlock huffs.
John looks down and chuckles. "Amazing." He mutters, almost to himself, and from the corner of his eye he sees the man straighten.
He blinked and looked up at Mary. They had met at the Drop-Off, a local 24 hour coffeehouse that many workers liked to frequent, if only to prove they too had a sense of humour.
“She’s fine. Her father picked her up just before you got in. Billy, I know there’s no love lost between you and Seb and Jim, but starting a fight in a public place, injuring others in the process…that’s reckless. And you don’t seem like the reckless type.”
"Alright, Bob." She gives him a thumbs-up. "All right."
Sherlock's mind is a high-vaulted ceiling and something is blaring static noise and he can't think—he can't
"Do you know where I went first?"
"I miss you, John."
“I mean other than that. You think all the Watchers have liked their humans as much as you do? You think they'd move as fast as you do when he's in danger? Why him? Why is he so special?”
He is not to be used as a playing piece.
“Lestrade believes in angels, otherwise he wouldn’t have seen your wings.”
“Sherlock, I know you are hurting from John’s death—”
In the rush of adrenaline, he had blurted out, asking her if she'd like to go out sometime. She had laughed. He liked her laugh. She had accepted. He liked that too, although it had been on strictly platonic terms. They'd gone straight from the agency after he'd gotten a new set of clothes, to the Drop-Off, which they were to visit together in the next three years more than any other customers the owner could remember.
"Well, I wouldn't know unless you decided to grow a beard." John said as he stood.
you? Do you outsource all your dull and tedious thought processes out to your useless assistants now, or just the incredibly stupid ones?”
Someone answers him, and Lestrade watches as Sherlock’s face drains of colour, all his defences singularly knocked down in one blow. His grip tightens around the phone as if it were a lifeline thrown to a drowning man. Mycroft has already come to attention, straightening in the edge of Lestrade’s line of sight. Sherlock looks like he might be sick.
As he trailed off, a high whine began in his ears, like an unending alarm. It felt like his head was tightening, trapped in a compression. Even in his dazed state he knew he had some sort of head trauma, although quite mild, so he counted himself lucky.
"A hard habit to break." She agreed, unlocking the door. They entered a richly decorated foyer, following the fine crimson rug directly towards a single staircase.
“That’s not yours to have.” Sherlock growls, attempting to snatch the journal from his brother, who pulls it out of his reach.
Sherlock's eyes darted to him. He smiled. "I suppose so."
“You asked me to.”
of him—"
"Sherlock—no—shade's broken, it's in pieces—the snakes are waiting…"
“And what if you do? Kill me, that is. What if you get possessed or whatever the hell that was earlier, and you kill me.”
Sherlock said nothing, but stared at the spot where John had been, trying to collate all the new information about him he had gathered in the few seconds they had been in the same room. He had been leaner, not eating as much as he used to; his clothes had been travelled in, the pants the dark burnt orange favoured near the Saharan to blend with the sand. It all screamed the same word that applied to Sherlock’s appearance as well: exile.
That night, wedged between John and the wall, he dreams of trees again. He’d had pine in place of marrow in his bones once more, and that sticky sweet smell returns to slow his blood to sap again. He’s slowly poisoned by the greenness of it all.
…" Sherlock scoffed, laying his head back down. His hands began idly tracing patterns on John's shirt. "I'm no different from you or the rest of the human race when it comes to selfishness. Everyone wants to hold on to the people they love. Everyone is selfish."
“You’ve not been here long,” he hisses, “but normal humans don’t shout loud enough to rattle the walls. London’s not experienced an earthquake in recent memory; let’s not change that.”
John had taken him back to his quarters, a small room vacated by a minister’s trip abroad. He’d drawn the thick, plush curtains, knowing that it would be hours yet before party returned and they were expected. Sherlock had sat on the bed as if he had done so for years, unlacing his fine deerskin breeches and shaking off his boots. John uncapped a pewter skein, pouring them each a small sip of blood.
"What do you
The man stared at him.
! Oh, I
As he hit the wall, sliding down to the deck, he saw a blurred shape thrown towards Billy; the body of the stag. The sudden heavy body of the animal bowled him over, and the scent of congealing blood filled the cool air.
Oh, but she is
A huff of empty laughter escapes Lestrade . “You don’t need me to spell it out to you, Sherlock.”
He laughs bitterly. "Look at it, it's too small; it'd never fit."
“Fair point.” Mortimer shrugs, tossing the handtowel over his shoulder before he heads into his darkened foyer. “Are you coming?” He calls from the darkness.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “Who is he meeting?”
mething
Fear – true fear – jolted through him as he ran from the room, towards the stairs.
Bookmark it. Come back later.
“Four?”
“He thinks we’re dead.” John whispers hoarsely. “If he hasn’t already…his brother will want to take him somewhere safe, if he can manage it.”
It's large, certainly, the size of some great animal whose presence forces it to be noticed—like a moose or a rhinoceros—and it's drinking from a pool of puddled rainwater as if it's quenching a thirst it's had all its life.
"He said that a fellow ambassador's assistant was assassinated a few years ago for laundering money." Mikheia paused, listening, before continuing. "Serves them right, he said, because now they are all too scared to do it anymore."
His mate whirled on him, brow folded into a deep frown.
“Is this hurting him now?”
“Why did you leave so quickly?” She asks, then upon seeing his face she adds: “I mean, you don’t have to tell me, I was just curious…sorry.”
"I try not to make it a habit." He answered. "Why do you ask?"
"What is your goal, then?" Mikheia asked and John fell into silence, thinking.
They'd started off, generally speaking, well enough. An hour out of Berlin, spent in comfortable silence in their quiet compartment of their considerably empty train. Not many people wanted to go to Prague, it seemed. Prague didn't exactly call to them and beckon them down for a vacation.
"Not this whole time, John, that's ridiculous. Don't think I'd hide that from you—"
"They need
He passes the birds, ignoring them as he had with everything else. He can see the water now, the one that mattered more than anything else. That black hole that had swallowed one and everything. Soon the garden would be full of locals and tourists alike. Did they know, as they were enjoying the birds and the flowers and the ponds, did they know that they stood on the lip of Tartarus? Did they know that this water would swallow everything they loved, everything they cared about?
“A…placenta.”
"Can you hear me?" He asks, his voice too hoarse for his liking. "My thoughts?"
"And what work might that be?" Lestrade questions and Moran looks at him with a faint smile.
“Yes he can.” John wheezes, eyes opening and watery with pain. “Yes he can. He’ll keep using me to get you.” Then, what he never wanted to hear: “Kill me, Sherlock. You have to.”
“What?” John asks, eyes narrowing. Azazel licks his lips and leans forward as if he’s sharing a secret.
As he tugs his consciousness back into him, as his mind begins to burn as it wakens, everything begins to come into focus.
He kisses him, and they eat dinner together in bed as they watch night fall. Sherlock sets aside their plates and takes his hand, settling against the duvet as the dark deepens.
He looked down at his steady hands. No trembling. He and John were not part of the same experiment.
"Funny," John said, scanning the room. "A friend of yours once promised the same thing."
“Cila, she is…unavailable. Gone.”
"You knew her, John."
The head lifted, two dark hooded eyes turning slowly to look at him. There were deep circles lined underneath Sherlock’s eyes, the eyes of the starving – those eyes of the deathly ill, the half-souled ghosts, the shadows of death. He stepped forward cautiously – blood-starved kin were dangerous.  Hunger did strange things to unstable minds. Yet he took another step in, and his brother came fully into view.
“Are you alright?” John calls hoarsely but he doesn’t answer. John hauls him to his feet, covering his smaller body with his own as he rushes them out of the barn. Bullets ping above them, dangerously close, but the smoke is too thick for even the best marksman, and the two barrel into the wet, cold night.
Mycroft chooses to overlook this new question in favour of another.
limped his way into Sherlock's life in a Holy Trinity of bad jumpers, psychosomatic wounds and steadfast morality. If he ever truly believed in anything or anyone other than himself, it was
"I don't know." John says, his ever repetitive mantra. But Mycroft allows it, for everything afterwards is usually interesting. "But if it makes you a good person, does it matter?"
"Nothing in particular..." John started. "I suppose it was an amalgamation. You have this gift, Sherlock, and sometimes I really think it's unworldly. I mean, how you can just see people but at the same time you
“And we saved it. We can do it again. It’s still burning. We could do great things. Don’t make me do this. Don’t make me be your end. Don’t let that warm-blooded battery down there be yours. You can do better.”
“Very good. Remember my rules, now. Ready?”
Moriarty.
Sherlock says nothing, which all but confirms John's suspicions.
The shadow paused, and then moved on. The lights turned off.
Sarajevo slept into the dawn.
“Ha fucking ha. Look, it’s simple if you think of it like birth—”
Mikheia looked at him. That odd little boy with that odd little spider scar. Sherlock was, at once, both pleased and annoyed that he had accepted his offer of dinner.
Tonight was no exception.
? You think you can feed and liquor me up and all is forgiven?"
“Is it done?” Irene asked, straightening up. All traces of concern had washed from her face and another took its place, eager and attentive. John nodded, and she smiled.
--//--
"Moran."
"What? Yes, Sherlock, I'm fine! He's getting away you know-"
He stops as he looks at Sherlock, whose attention is elsewhere.
John nearly rolled his eyes. He hadn’t expected dramatics this soon—typically it was two to three glasses in. But, now that he thought about it, her supply had been rather exceptional, made him feel warmer, more pliant. She had picked it smartly; she’d wanted him relaxed and open to questions. Heaven only knows what Sherlock’s reaction was. He’d be in the oubliettes by dawn if he got into the vintage.
"I was trained by the best, John. And I did it for him. Even though alive or not he'd never appreciate it, I did it for him. He is my genius, my dark angel, and I am his soldier. After all," Moran grinned. "Isn't everyone always harping about how closure does you good?"
"I know you have problems with people leaving, John—"
“Any male patients from their 30s to mid-40s? Possibly injured in an industrial accident?”
"After we got you out of Novgorod you became sick, very, very sick. We were told it was your body trying to get rid of whatever was put into you."
“I thought you’d leave.” I mutter to the walls, and to him. “With the rent and all.”
Sherlock kneels at his side in an instant, wrapping an arm around the back of his neck. The black veins are appearing again, bold ink against his paling skin, crawling and skittering underneath the sinew and muscle like spiders.
He closes his hand around the ball before dropping it to pitter against the floor as it rolls away.
"That night in Bruges, if you remember, while John was showering, you woke up and I asked you about his actions during my absence. You told me them in such an abridged way that I was left to wonder if you'd shared with me everything that you, as John's closest friend outside of myself, would have felt the responsibility to share. I asked you if anyone would be coming after John for his betrayal and you told me that it depended on just whose orders he had shied from.
He wondered why he had allowed the boy to tag along.
"I don't remember."
Jane Samson. Richard Thompson. Lily Teague.
“What would you have said?” Sherlock asked, his eyes closed, leaning his head against John’s.
The cloud of cigarette smoke that greets them at the door is almost enough to bring him to his knees; it's as if he's died and gone to heaven. Cigarette heaven.
“Because he wanted him out of the way?”
, he thinks.
“Wasn’t I worth it?” John asks, and his hoarse whisper sounds gutted, utterly heartbroken. Disappointed.
"You can stand in the box."
An understanding smile came to John's face. It seemed sad to Sherlock.
. So alive and wet. The sounds of their heartbeats are purer than the trumpets. And the noises they make when you fuck them? Beautiful.” His smile fades as he takes in John’s solemn countenance. “Don’t tell me the two of you haven’t—oh John, you prude, you’ve got all the right parts, you don’t know what you’re missing—”
* * * * *
"You're more important than him, John." Sherlock murmured as he stared down at him through half-lidded eyes, his voice hoarse and quiet with something thick that he couldn't place.
?" John bursts out, the sudden fire in his eyes making Sherlock drop his hands as if he's been burned. "Shooting him if he'd killed me wouldn't
Sherlock tilts his head back and laughs as John recoils in surprise.
the woe of aftermath"
"Then you'll have to trust me. From here on out, we're in this together. That means no secrets."
Mists fell over London, slicking the dark streets and thickening the shadows of the alleys. The sidestreets were relatively empty, most inhabitants tucked into their night at the pub or in their own beds. Only the lonely populated the quiet corners of the city, unnoticed, acknowledging their brethren in silent greeting.
“But they didn’t see me.” John started, bringing his horse to trot alongside Sherlock’s. “I don’t see the problem.”
Somewhere in the distance, a timer rings. The sound is jarring, cuts straight through him.
As the car rocks to a stop, they both take a long, steady breath in.  Heart beating a crazed staccato, Mortimer shakily reaches down, grabs his tea, and takes a deep sip.
"What does she want?" He asked.
“Lock it away and forget about it forever.”
"I went to his home in the middle of the night and I shot him in the head." He answered calmly. "I didn't want him to suffer, but he didn't deserve to live. Not after what he did to me. Not after what he did to others around us. I shot him, but I missed and blew off one of his ears and woke him. He…was very
Harry nodded, eagerly holding out her glass for Sherlock to fill from the pewter canteen.
A body has been pinned to the wall, arms and legs splayed, like a butterfly to a board. A frog being dissected. A tray in front of it, laden with bloodied pink piles of rawness, has offered a modicum of dignity, but corpses have no need for that, and what was once a man was now most certainly a corpse. Its blonde head had fallen down, lacking the functions to hold it up.
, but misjudges the distance and bangs his head against the light, sending it swinging away.
“Mikheia,
"I'm not
"I say lots of things." Jim shrugs. "I wasn't allowed to send a pack of Tenebests onto the humans and look what happened there." Jim grins with half-lidded eyes. "No, no, he's been a traveller in the desert for thousands of years, crazed with thirst that's been blurred with hunger and you call to him like a glass of cold water, with droplets
Lazily, he takes one last drag, looking back at the clock on the stove.
Option one: He can go out there now, act as if nothing has happened, and misunderstand and condescend to everything John says until he gets so frustrated he hits him or leaves or both.
"With each last breath leaving their lungs, I became stronger. I became…complete."
A giant wave crashed through their bond, cresting against the lid John was trying to hold against it. They reached a door at the end of the tunnel.
"I will make sure he does, sir." Mikheia said, scratching at his arm.
"Sometimes cancerous tumours are incorrectly diagnosed as malignant." Mary replied to his unvoiced question. "We didn't know what he was—who he was—until it was too late."
like that, Sherlock."
Mikheia took one last look at the closed door then set off into unknown territory.
"But you
"Oh."
John cringed at the coldness of both cream and voice.
Sherlock smiles in a way he’s never done in his whole life, save for the night after he dumped John in a bathtub and woke up beside him the next morning.
His brother ignores him as he edges into the room, grabbing the doctor by his lapels and slamming him against the desk.
"I told you to stop saying that."
He truly expected that, in their adventures, John would learn
He hadn't seen Sherlock since the detective had grazed his fingers over the raised skin, that scarring condemnation, that
, of course they’re related, they share the same eye colour, not to mention the attached earlobes and the slightly deviated septum—before setting down his spoon into a nearly-finished bowl of creamed polenta.
“Sure.” Sherlock says with a wave of his hand, then calls after John: “Be careful of Frankenstein’s monster, he does like to crowd in your space.”
“Still, I am glad to hear that you are together. It is a sad thing when a bond fails. Love, marriage – it is different for us, no? We take it seriously. Are you still hungry?”
"Out." He said solemnly, and they must have trusted something in him, his face or his gun or his resoluteness or the fact that he was after the strange man that had invaded their bakery and ruined their day, because they fled hurriedly into the street.
She steps forward. He stays where he is.
The castle was being haunted; before they were dismissed, the cooks would catch something at the corner of their eye, moving quickly behind them when they went to the cellars or the pantry. When the kennel keepers let the dogs out for a run after dinner they could see a shadowy figure at the end of the frozen lawn, just where the trees began, and only on moonless nights was the white horizon still and silent.
“So what in God’s name made you think he was here?”
His reflection should be in the mirror.
John nearly smiled.
"What did you tell him?" Sherlock asked as they followed the consul from the room.
"The murders?" Sherlock asks, if only to make the manager more uncomfortable.
It’s been an hour and thirteen—fourteen minutes. He hasn’t said a word. Not one utterance, not a wild punch, not
His heart was still pounding as he dialled the agency's number.
“Let’s move then.” Sherlock replied, yawning, nudging closer into John’s chest. “I don’t want to live here any longer anyways.”
It was the loneliness. No more Sherlock. No more John. No more adventures or gun fights or travelling.
“That’s not worth his life. I’ve adapted before…I can do it again.”
"Well," she breathes, looking up, "he's breathing, which is a far sight better than what we could've gotten…"
He says nothing, and continues to look at John even after the man has focused his attention on the service. John wouldn’t want him to make a scene in front of people (or maybe he does, Sherlock can’t tell these days).
“Mmm. And the same to you.”
John collapsed in the back seat of whatever care the agency had conscripted to get him out. He didn't care if it looked good as long as it had an engine and wheels and could get him as far away from that place as possible.
“He’ll ask for Harry.” Mycroft says softly beside him.
"How about a compromise? We start with the latter, and then see if it changes to the former?"
Mikheia snored softly on the couch in the library, a book draped over his chest and his hand resting on a pile rising up from the floor.
Sherlock chuckles lowly. “It’s not like he can.”
If Sherlock had not had the exact same thought minutes earlier, when John had fallen into the mud and he thought the worst, he might have blanched. He might have been speechless.
“John. John Watson.”
"Where is Mary?"
The interior of 221B remains wholly untouched as rain taps against the windows in the wet night, the air warm and sugary, diaphanous with the heavy laziness that comes with a fulfilling dinner. John sits in the chair that Sherlock's associating him with more and more, his wings spilling over the arms, feathers barely grazing the floor. Sherlock sits across from him, knees curled to his chest as he stares into the new-born fire.
“Oh, that’s been obvious from the beginning: because you can feel everyone’s thoughts. I imagine it’s rather like my deductions, although I learned to tune them out until they mattered. You walk outside, you get one beat of peace, and then a barrage of information assaults your senses and it’s like you’re drowning. You can’t breathe, your head aches, you feel…small. Lost in something you can’t control.”
He frowned at a sudden thought. "They brought him back. Why not her too?"
Later, he will sit on a plane and think of a new name as he shrugs off his old one. He’s already washed the blood away in the sink, and it’s time for this one to go too.
“It doesn’t matter where we go. He’ll find us.”
“What? What’s so funny?”
“It’s not that easy. You know what travel is like for us.”
And what had John done? John had run away.
Your cell phone is also several years out of date, suggesting that either you don't have the money to buy a new one or you haven't bothered to upgrade, yet your clothes are, more or less, newly purchased, therefore you are not lacking in adequate funds. Your phone is advanced enough to be useful, yet if you truly cared for any other technological functions, you would have gotten a better one. Your hesitancy to do so suggests that you were involved in a lifestyle where cellular communication was sparse or otherwise not a priority. The army is the most likely option. So," The man tilts his head slightly, considering him, "have I missed anything?"
John was an oddity to them, a truly unique oddity.
“I was in the army, Sherlock, in combatant territory, in the wilderness, with no major city around for hundreds of miles. Then I got sent back to London, to you, and to all that came with it, including the crime. You think the difference wouldn’t have been immediately noticeable to anyone that took the time to think about it?”
, every pore of his skin covered in dried sweat that effectively caps the uncomfortable heat inside him and makes him want to kick off the covers that are already piled on the floor. There's a tightness in his head, a knot right in the middle that keeps being pulled at both ends, and it's so hot and burning and utterly
“He didn’t catch me then, though.” Irene adds. “I’d say I left him a bit thunderstruck, and perhaps more than a little sexually confused. He never knew what was coming.”
Finally, when he couldn't stand it, he moved to sit beside him. John didn't stir. Good. He didn't want him awake to hear him.
, either. I can feel you, remember? – your obstinance is a flimsy defense. If you can talk to anyone on this abandoned rock, you can talk to me.”
“It’s not a criticism, love, I’m just saying in five hundred years maybe you take a penmanship course once in a while.”
"I got shot at, jumped in the Thames, swam 30 metres in water that may has well have been ice, and got sick for a…tiger."
She’s alone.
"Mary."
Sherlock scoffed. He felt John's hand at his wrist, grabbing his pulse.
"That's not the point here and you know it! The point is that when you get bored you play games and you don't realise just how
said, not this stupid, idiotic girl that is so unimportant in their lives; he must make sure she stays that way. She only has access to a possibly related crime scene and that most certainly does not deserve John's prolonged attention. He's gripped by the desire to walk over and seize John by the shoulders and drag him off somewhere dark and quiet so they could be alone, but that would leave him without access to the case files he needs so he supposes that before they could make any progress they would have to get past that slobbering hound.
know Mikheia is there, up on the ramp, he
“At least sixteen hours.”
"That's good." John smiled, quickly adding another kiss to its predecessors. The jacket was halfway off. "Mycroft asked me to give it back."
A gasp, a rattle of drawn breath, broke the quiet.
—was child's play?" John pauses, a darker thought surfacing in his mind. "Or did you think I wouldn't follow? Because I would have, Sherlock. I would've followed you to the ends of the earth and back. I still would."
“She loves theatrics; I’m sure you can sympathize.”
The anchor drops, the reverberations
"There's always something." Sherlock sighed, then turned around, his pistol aimed at the center of John's heart.
“John.” I call, and he turns, a shadow in the darkness, barely visible. “I—may I stay?”
John didn't respond.
"Listen, I ain't got time to argue with a man who was all but sure he'd live to see another day even while the rope was choking the life out of him. I want to know why you got up there in the first place."
She nodded. “And Algiers.”
He’d never known John as a human, a fact he regretted when he thought about it. In all of his files, his reports, analysis, great and endless wings of memory he had dedicated to the man, there was that large blank space of his humanity, and it drove him mad sometimes to think that although he knew every other possible facet, he’d never know John in that context. They both weren’t exactly candid about their past lives; he knew John had been bitten sometime during the ninth and last crusade, just outside of Aleppo, and something, the last of his blood in the sand, made him return again and again. He and the desert were as intertwined as he and Sherlock, two halves of a whole.
Sherlock smiles, enigmatic. "A little bird flew in and told me."
John's hand gently slides up his wrist. His touch is like a pianist lingering over their keys before they begin a sonata.
"Sherl…k"
"No one's around to tell me how brilliant I am."
“Not who I think it is, hopefully.” Harry answers, taking a sharp turn into a side street.
Don’t remind me, don’t make me think of it, don’t make me think of him, I can’t, I can’t—
She and John talked amiably, Sherlock a ghost in tow as they followed their host down the long, arched halls, candlelight gleaming off gilded frames, paintings in rich shining tempuras of eggy yellows, vibrant reds, deep oily black.
“Look on the back.” Mycroft says lowly and Sherlock turns it over.
it.” He hissed.
Harry ignores it all, heading right to a piece ahead of them, a small stone bowl supported by two lion's heads on either side that morph in the middle grotesquely into a solid body of wings and a single leg.
all on his own.
“Okay, we’ve got to stop doing that.”
"Not if you were around to get it for me. Which you weren't."
"I believe what I queried you was if you had come to me expecting protection. I never refused it, and I never will, unless you've gotten yourself into an awful mess. But you are smart, John. I trust you to make correct decisions."
Sherlock took John's face in his hands, those long fingers tracing around the lines of his face, holding his head in the wiry cage of Sherlock's fingers.
Harry looks at him for a long moment.
The man doesn’t answer. Sherlock sheds his coat, handing it to Mycroft, who melts back into the shadows, watching, waiting to intervene if he goes too far. John isn’t to be seen.
They sit in silence, letting the outside noise fold into the tiny car. A brisk wind brushes through the open windows, bringing with it the smell of exhaust, chatter, and baking bread. One of the things Harry has enjoyed most has been conversation, however unpleasant it seems to her now. People talking to each other has become cloaked in a soft and warm appreciation for her, if only because she’s never heard it before. No one and nothing before had ever talked about the weather or argued over sports or laughed together at a meal. This and everything else is a constant source of astonished fascination. She’d never have imagined it existed, that these irrelevant, insignificant, everyday things could be shared and spoken of so freely. Before, it had been a long suffering darkness. Now, it has become an ever-fresh gloss of sunlight. Everything is new, and everything has taken a peculiar shade of beauty.
“How high was the dosage?” He asks lowly, eyes concentrated on the pallid face in front of him.
“Sherlock cares what happens to you.” John corrects. “
“Right on both counts,” Sherlock sniffs, turning into the room. “As you do tend to stick to the obvious answers. Someone did break in and someone was armed, clearly.”
There is a sudden long howl and Sherlock and John look to each other. It sounds familiar. Too familiar.
Silently, Sherlock stares at the space that demon’s face had been before he turns on his heel and follows Lestrade, a shadow trailing softly down the burning hallway.
Sherlock was still talking somewhere behind him, mostly to John or to himself; he wasn’t quite sure who the intended audience was and lacked the interest to know.
"I can't promise you that I'll stay." John admits.
"Mycroft has a weakness for sweets." Sherlock said, swooping into the room and sitting opposite of John. "You dangle a piece of cake in front of him and he'll run a wheel enough to power all of London for weeks."
"Not this kind."
John paused, licking at his lips in thought before offering the truth: “Vienna.”
"Sorry to disappoint you, but that's not happening. This is the only way to Sherlock."
"But, see, you didn't just
"Did he say anything to you?"
"Couldn't you have just called me?"
Sherlock awoke to the sound of a loud knock at the door. He could hear the heartbeat of the man on the other side. From the way blood was rushing through the arteries, he had a good five years left before the hypertension claimed him.
"I—is Moran—"
The moon was bright tonight, working its way to its peak. He stopped in the middle of the yard, crunching on dead leaves. There was music playing inside, and John knew it was Sherlock’s. He could tell; by now it was in his bones, an inextricable part of him.
"Mikheia…" John muttered. Two great green eyes stared at him, blood trickling down the side of his face from an open cut. His hands were bandaged with torn, bloodied pieces of cloth in the way of street punks that had habits of breaking windows.
"The Golem is dead, John. You know that. You
John entered the room, one of the smaller libraries. A roaring fire was already banked in the hearth, its heat billowing throughout the room. Three figures sat on the sofas; three faces turned to him as he walked in, the firelight casting shadows over each. Two of them he recognized, the Grand Duke, and the monarchist, Vladimir, hawkeyed and peering at him through his round glasses.
"Poor little detective. So curious…so eager to know everything…and you haven't even realized that you love him, and he can never love you back." Jim pauses, thinking. "Although, I'm sure he would if he was allowed to, which would have made this adventure
The beast whines, rolling itself onto its feet, before the whine grows into a roar, echoing off the wet bricks and setting the hair on Sherlock's neck on end.
"Of course." Mary said, stubbing it out in the ashtray.
The birds sing in the trees, ducking in and out, and soar out over the valley below them. Molly doesn't feel as if she'd burst into tears anymore, she just feels numb. This spot that she and Will share absorbs their grief, soaking it into the ground and leaving them both empty. How can the birds be flying on a day like this?
He scanned the rooftops across the grand canal. Piloerection was more likely to be caused by something behind him rather than in front—the fear response warning him of a predator approaching a vulnerable area. Nothing in the eaves, dark as they were. No disturbance in the crowds, milling about their tethered boats and sidewalks on the other shore.
go alone?"
“‘Am I having a good time?’” John frowned.
"You think I'll fail?"
"Is he here?"
He closes the latest video feed and hesitates before he opens the next one. There are only so many more to go before he edges out of the time period where Moriarty could have been here. This activity is fast becoming an annoying waste of his time.
“Quite.” He answers, and he knows she noticed his glance over her. He’s planned for her interest. “I don’t make it a habit of repeating myself.”
He looked down at John, John who trusted him, John who loved him, and felt as if he had failed, but at what he wasn’t quite sure. Their relationship had been a string of failures of late, ever since Norway, maybe even before that, and a century had not been long enough to set them back on course. Perhaps this was it then: perhaps they were travelling into deeper waters, diverting with the currents that pulled them apart.
"Yes, but the sink is broken and I'd like to wash my face and perhaps shave while I'm at it. I'm almost entirely sure that you're not a fan of whisker burn."
"I don't know." John answered and Sherlock knew he wasn't lying, even in his addled state.
"I like the Arabic word the best; it has the most colour." He looks at Sherlock. "Zamzama; 'to thunder' or 'to murmur'. A paradox. One word that means its opposite."
"No." Sherlock answers lowly. He may expect it, but he'll never be
"The kindness is bleeding out of you, John." Sherlock said quietly, and when he drew his hand away it was bloody from a wound that John couldn't see. But he felt it. God, did he feel it.
He stood at the desk for a moment, fingers reaching out to run along the grooves and marks on the old wood.
A letter had come—there had been a death in Venice, one quite curious and rather auspicious.
Then he’s being hauled across the table by the hand fisted in his shirt, and John’s other fist is squarely planted in his jaw.
“Then I am sure he will understand. You gave him this courtesy, and he will repay it, once you find each other again.”
"No?"
You are the beginning that gushes forth.
"Our friend, the one whose home was burned down, I want to find him. See if there's anything on him."
A small crowd had clustered on one side of the Ponte delle Guglie, dark figures leaning over the railing. A triumphant shout sounded. and a call went out to raise the nets that filtered the sea green Lido waters.
“Vaguely, in bits and pieces.”
"Well, this was uninformative. Take me to the morgue."
“Hmm, and how did he know
Then Sherlock's words were being hissed again in his ear.
--//--
He’s trying to think of Sherlock, but he can’t get the face right. Were his eyes always shaped like that? And his hair, always so formless? Why can’t he remember? Why can’t he see?
you!"
"It's not
The staircase was the same as always, and he climbed slowly, feeling the creak of the wood under his weight. That door in front of him…John was on the other side. That fact alone made him want to bound up, skipping steps as he went, and throw the door open, but at the same time, it made him want to turn and flee, go back the way he came and continue his purge of Moriarty's underworld, only there was very little web left that he could burn away. He had made sure of that.
"Since I love you," he continues, licking his lips, "you are in a truly unique position to know that someone like me isn't going to let you go so easily. I brought you back, John. You have to know that there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you, for us. I'm not going to feel like this ever again, about anyone else. You're it. You know that. Only an idiot would think I wouldn't follow wherever you went."
The boy nods, pale thin hands shaking against the dark ground.
"No, Sherlock, really, there's nothing there."
He was startled awake by a knock at the door. The room was engulfed in darkness, blackout curtains blocking any trace of sunlight.
“Zygomatic fracture.” Sherlock growls. “You should feel lucky I felt lenient today. Be comforted by the fact that you have a reprieve today, for once I find him, I will do to you tenfold of what you’ve done to John Watson.”
|| ||||| | || ||| || ||||| |
“John,” He whispers vehemently as if he’s been personally wronged by the sight of John’s socks, “where are your shoes?”
"We received a report from Sarajevo early this morning. CCTV scan from the train station." He said, reaching into his jacket as he pulled out a small photograph, blurred and grainy. "I believe you will find it of interest."
Sherlock frowned.
John watched him as he paced. “Calm down. You’re going to wear a hole in the floor at this rate.”
"They told me I could have Kate back."
"Control seizures, or at least give the illusion of control, which is simultaneously the most idiotic and brilliant notion because humans crave control the most, so naturally through association there would be an attachment to the drug, which makes it highly addictive…" Sherlock finished then trailed off as his eyes grew wide.
"He was
No answer. More watery blood dripped away from him, onto the carpet. Mycroft wouldn't be happy about the damage, but that was another matter.
“Mycroft is currently involving himself in the war efforts.” He answered dryly. “England calls upon her loyal son once again.”
That was Sherlock's voice, unmistakably. But there was no conceivable way on this earth that it what he had heard. This wasn't a good sign, if he was imagining his dead best friend's voice.
John told him exactly seven times,
“The night we met, you told me you were summoned here. Was it him?”
She pats him on the shoulder and moves behind Mortimer.
"You couldn't fool John and you can't fool me. Now shut your gob and close your eyes."
Moran stared at the wall. Brought a cigarette to his lips with a still, blood-slicked hand.
"Yes."
"You're a good man too, you know." John said solemnly. "A great one. The best, actually."
"Are you alright?" Sherlock asks, concern gleaning in his tone, yet he makes no move to help John up. Is he afraid of touching him? Have they reverted back to primary school and John has been infected with cooties?
in it again. John pats the space beside him with his good arm. Sherlock recognizes a positive sign when he sees it, but he cannot help the cold fact that John is now hindered to bad arm and good arm and it is because of him.
The ceiling is moving, like oil added to water, slowly, and in segmented waves. Water from John’s wings, sliding off the feathers. He smiles, feeling the muscles lazily drift upwards, curling at the corners of his lips. Look at him, what he’s reduced himself to, like boiling water left forgotten until there was nothing but a burning pot. Gladstone licks at his hanging fingers. He doesn’t care enough to draw them away. Isn’t it wonderful, blissful oblivion? The way his eyes sag with such a lovely weightless blasé. He doesn’t care, and isn’t it wonderful?
“Why is it around our necks?” John asks, taking a small swig of the rakija.
The fight seems to leave John for a moment and it's all Sherlock needs to lift him over the rim of the tub, spilling water onto the floor as John sinks into the warm bath. Sherlock's hand comes to support his head, the other trying to hold him down.
Then he noticed the door to their room was cracked open. He hadn't left it like that…he had most definitely shut it—
He had, however, expected the bakery to be empty considering that it was a Sunday. Yet two women and a little girl turned their eyes up to him fearfully, a tray of pastries face down on the floor in front of them, dropped in shock. A family taking advantage of down time to catch up on their baking, not suspecting that a crazed psychopath would crash through their window when he found their door to be locked or that a small British man would calmly follow as if he'd been trained for it, as if he had been waiting for this moment all his life.
*   *   *
The door cracked open and Irene popped her head in, whatever clever retort dying on her lips as she took in the two.
The color – already blanched since his last feeding – leeched from Sherlock’s face and he stared up at John as if he had never quite seen him correctly before.
Together, they went forward. Once, in another life, they would have run in without question, heedless of the danger. Now, they walked slowly, carefully. John reached towards his waistcoat, where a wooden stiletto was strapped to the piping at his side. The alley was a ramo, closed off at the end by apartments, houses, private gates. There was nowhere for it to run, but it had proven to be capable of rationality, of calculation. No youngling would ever hide behind a mask—this one was something else entirely.
“It was a secret because that’s the way she wanted it." Billy answers softly. "I think she was afraid of someone—afraid of Jim.”
Other. That was unexpected, although in a way it really wasn't. He had never discussed his religion with Sherlock and so he'd assumed it was Church of England or some other typical venture. Of course he'd still surprise Sherlock; of course he'd still be a mystery. Too uncertain to check the Atheist or Agnostic box on something that would feel so permanent and too undecided to check something more defining. Fascinating.
anywhere (that meant he was relaxed and John doubted Sherlock even knew the feeling of the word), much less somewhere that was dirty. That's how John knew he was dreaming.
"What the Thames thing? Honestly I just felt like going for a swim."
"Why not?" John grinned "That's your shift."
"I've seen many things die. Many people. Some of them I even liked. I don't know what I would do if you became one of them."
The Golem was here, just around the corner ahead.
"Yeah," Harry nods, but holds her fingers near Mortimer's face, as if in a threat.
” Georgiy says, gesturing with his hands. “
"I didn't want you to
crushed her.
“Do you have another explanation?”
The voice chuckled.
John mentioning logic and himself in one go made something in Sherlock’s reptile brain spark with nascent pride.
“I think you’re incorrect.”
"They only people that know where he is are criminals, like him." He sputtered, gesturing to the river as if it proved his point. "If I knew, if I was a criminal, I probably wouldn't tell you. It is very easy to see that you are a foreigner. Criminals make it their business not to trust foreigners, only rob them."
John sits beside Mrs. Wilson on the loveseat, keeping a respectful but wary distance. It was hard enough getting her to calm down; it'd taken nearly four tries just to get the sedative in her. She's gripping his hand with enough force that he can feel the bones of his fingers rubbing together underneath his skin.
“You won’t find me, Sherlock. You’re not the only one who knows how to disappear.”
for you?
"You couldn't move me while I was unconscious?"
Birds swim happily in the quartet of ponds that led to the head of the Serpentine. Chirping quails were nesting on their eggs, the ducks floating aimlessly, watching a lone heron quietly stalk the barren water for food. They make no move to flee as Sherlock approaches, though they do turn away from Gladstone, who eyes them with the glazed and hungry look of a child in a candy shop, a thin stream of slobber hanging from his jowls, once hallowed and gaunt and now paunchy and full. Sherlock suspects that John coddled him too much, thought him too much of a pet and not the predatory beast he’d been when he arrived. Didn’t matter now that Sherlock had found himself feeding him table scraps and petting the wolf far more often in one day than he ever had when John was here. He was trying to pad the void with little things. He was trying to make it hurt less. He couldn’t say how well it was working.
"Oh, hush, I brought you tea."
"Tell them something that will allow us to, then."
"Hm?" He looks down at it, staring at the book hard for a moment. "Do you—ah—do you have to keep that, Officer Donovan?"
That's alright.
"Please," He repeats, gaze still fixed on the mantle. "Just give me one day. That's all I want. All I need. 24 hours." He turns his head and John can see his desperation, but also the resolve buried underneath it. Sherlock will use all he has in him to scourge Moran from this world just as hard as he had tried to rid them of Moriarty. John trusts him; Moran, even if judged with proper estimation, was no contender with Moriarty's brilliance.
much more delightful, I can assure you. I'd love to just take you apart."
Sherlock takes the heart between his gloved hands and shakes it.
At some point, his hands had begun to shake, rattling the gun in his hands.
Mycroft. Not him. Not his soldier. Mycroft.
"Such obscenities, Sherlock, really, they don't suit you more than they do a twelve year old—"
“I won’t ‘hold you hostage’, John.” Sherlock responded sourly at the implication. “You know I won’t.”
"If I don't fall apart
John smiles.
Mikheia watched Sherlock appear as he pocketed his gun, watched him burst from the main factory and cross the empty yard like the stretched shadow of an invisible man, watched him pull open the large doors to the assembly plant and enter.
John brings his mace to the demon’s temple and unceremoniously knocks him into an otherworldly unconsciousness.
“Well that was a fine farewell.” John said, pulling up beside him. He was irate – why irate?
She looked at him rather forlornly and he realised that she had been keeping a great and terrible secret from him.
His breathing is fast in his ears. He’s going to pass out soon, and he doesn’t want to wake up. He wants this man to kill him and get it over with because he’s going to be sick and John can’t see him like that John can’t see him like
John said nothing, but kept rubbing those smooth circles into his temple.
John sighed.
The smell of gunpowder, grainy, ashen and gritty, wafted towards him on the wind. He took a deep breath, and the dark thing in him that ached to smell it again spoke, and made him guide the horse forward.
As John aimed his gun and fired at him, he decided that such was not the case now.
The boy nodded and handed him the paper.
"As do you. I have a question, Johnny."
And furthermore, what could he possibly say to alleviate three years of unending longing and sorrow?
“Of course, you said you’d rather stay at the flat, but I don’t understand the connection since obviously there’s supposed to be one.”
“I forgive you.” He says quietly, so quietly I nearly miss it.
"Wonderful." John replied dryly. "Remind me to get them appraised."
John blinked in surprise. "You really
A deep voice, distant but not threatening, soothing in its heaviness. Like running your fingers over a guitar's strings in the dark and hearing them hum. There was safety in its familiarity.
Her nudeness, however blatantly distracting it may be, is, quite thankfully
It’s raining again. You know, as it does. It hasn’t rained since John left, but he can’t bring himself to connect the wires between
John had hardly believed it himself when he came across the titles in his research with 'Moran, Sebastian' listed as the author on the online catalogue.
The cabinet is locked. He wishes it wasn’t, so he might have a face to stare upon, but then he remembers that there wouldn’t have been much to look at anyways.
“To good fortune.”
“What do you think it means?”
"You think your love for me is negative?"
"Not when my brother is with you. Mycroft, come out!"
Then, unconsciousness.
John cries out, feeling the metal slice through tenuous tendons and lean muscle, feels it knick slick solid bone, and Azazel reaches behind him again, snagging another smaller knife from the stand.
“Sherlock—” Mycroft begins in warning, because this will go nowhere good if he continues, but his brother continues on, undeterred.
!” He shouted, drawing a few confused looks from passerby.
me to lock you up—"
He stands. For a moment, the light catches his back and Mycroft almost believes that he sees sunlight glancing off smooth dark feathers like polished wood. But the bookshelf is behind him and clearly it was what caught his eye.
"You're not a good representation of people."
"Nachash." John hisses.
He looks to Sherlock, who he half expected to treat the information as a joke, a prank of some punk kid maybe, but he had gone still, a stern and pensive look on his face.
"The editor of the science magazine
Sherlock’s bounding ahead of him, as usual. He is a blur on the horizon, as usual.
“No.” Sherlock answered, and John nearly sighed in relief, but he spoke again: “Not yet. But I can feel it coming. The wave.”
Cold grey clouds roll past the window, filtered light barely illuminating the window. The cool, damp morning air softly breezes into the room, prickling Sherlock's skin, and he pulls the thick duvet closer to him.
“Tell me what to do, then.” Sherlock replies, managing to sound far calmer than he feels. Despite appearances and his spontaneous approach, he suspected they both knew this was his first time dealing with a dislocated limb.
“Yes.”
and his alone ever again.
"What makes it a monster?" She asks.
As the roots of the shelves pull at him, he feels his heart rip.
John, bloodied and bruised. John, screaming in pain. John, hopeless. John, destroyed.
Sherlock doesn’t miss Mortimer’s quick glance upwards.
Silt billowed around him like thick smoke as John pushed off of the bottom, the water streaming across his face as they rose upwards, bringing himself and Sherlock out of the murky depths and into the light. As they hurtled towards the light, Sherlock jerked back suddenly, as if the brightness stung him, and sent John tearing out of his arms. As the fire of oxygen deprivation seared through him, sending his blood into a slow burn, John doubled back and darted to his friend, reaching a hand out to grab him.
With one last glance back, he follows.
Sherlock does not answer. He knows better than to press the intercom button, but Donovan's gaze has already darted between the two as if she's preparing herself to stop him.
—he smelled like Sherlock. That was the best of it all. He'd never expected to smell himself on John and the sheer wonder of it all felt like someone had dropped a ten stone slab of lead on his chest from a great height.
“That would explain why he came here so late, then.” John says gravely. “He was trying to find us in London first.”
It was a small space, no bigger than a child’s bedroom, yet it was shrouded in total darkness, completely shielded from the light of the sun. As he crested the ladder, lifting his body into the cold vacuum, he could see a large trail of disturbed dust, streaked in blood. His eyes followed, landing in a far corner where he could see a mop of curly hair just above a stack of crates draped in ghostly white sheets.
“It does when it comes to us. You said it yourself at our ceremony: we are equals in everything. That’s what fair is. It’s allowing me in, not shutting me out.”
“Why haven’t you done it?” Sherlock asked, keeping his eyes on the board as he countered, capturing a rook but leaving his remaining knight open.
Mikheia stood and walked over to the trash can before spitting out a mouthful of biscuit, a smile on his face.
“I had a plan, John. Do give me some credit. Haven’t when been here before?”
"Are you typically this rude?" The same officer asks, voicing a question Lestrade has been asking himself all day.
“No, he was under the assumption that we had a younger brother and I informed him that we, in fact, do not. What’s happened?”
"I shall be perfectly content explaining it to him, John," Sherlock says, grabbing a scalpel from John's kit. "But thank you, as ever, for your endearing support."
He is home.
“She’s going to Florence, you know.” Sherlock said after a moment, head rolling to John’s shoulder.
He starts to think that it might have been fine, it might have been bearable even, if he had never run into John in Bruges. If they had stayed in their own carefully synthetic lives, working towards a future they wanted in a reality that was trying to stop them. If John had never seen him in Bruges, he would never have stayed, he would have moved on, but Sherlock had to prove he was clever, that he was smarter than whatever he was facing, and its price had been larger than he could pay. If John had never seen him Sherlock might have had someone to come back to and that is what hurts the most.
Sherlock sat in stillness, willing his limbs to move as he shut his eyes.
‘мртвачница’
it's too late
“The Khylsts get so lively, dear.” Moriarty said, laughing, his teeth black. “You’re quite vanilla though, I’m not sure what they’d do with you—”
"I may have stolen some money from them to finance my trip to Khartoum."
John stared at him, a weak smile coming onto his face before he stood.
Thinking that John would ever want to be with him.
"Knowing him, he'll have something else up his sleeve. Insurance."
2.  This conversation happens in Chapter 17 ("affection and perfidy") of 'Eosophobia', when John talks with Mikheia in the hospital and embarks on his lovely emotional crisis (Which I guess is a metaphorical pole to the chest?).
“You want to leave.”
Jim closes his eyes and breathes in deeply. Sherlock watches his toes wiggle in agitation.
“Would you like a plaster?” I ask into the void.
John sobered instantly, tapping his knuckles absentmindedly against Sherlock’s breastbone. “Irene…and what did she have to say about all of that?”
"Nonsense," Sherlock said roughly, sitting up, rubbing at his throat. "Air in the body. Escapes after death."
, this wasn’t how it was supposed to go, not like this, not like this—
“Mmm…of course you did.”
"Yes."
The journey up the coast took the better part of the day, and the two, hemmed into the darkness and the rocking, said little, more comfortable in silence than small talk. Sherlock sat opposite, an intense look of concentration settling over his face as he stared at his mate. John ignored him, slowly flipping through his book until he couldn’t stand the feeling any longer; an irritating feeling, like a new bruise being poked at.
Thank you all for sticking with this story - I hope that it is one you find both rewarding and engaging, whether you read it one time, or come back to read it again.
“John.”
.” He answers, knocking the hand away. “Fine.”
You can't imagine how I hate this
The garage is glowing and he feels like he knows what it is to touch the sun. He’s running and it’s all around him and it’s hot, too hot, but John is there, beside him, so everything must be okay.
, for Christ's sake! Billy is a human being – I know you know the difference between the two. You knew this was wrong, and if you didn’t care about it, you knew at the very least I’d be upset. We don’t
"How many— hell if I know. I reckon at least a handful around every oiltown. Rangers don't often come up around these parts. They're mucking up the border most days."
An hour later, Lestrade had left and they had resumed their walk back to their flat, the day as grey and mild as it had ever been.
And suddenly, as he stumbles through barely visible underbrush with an angel under his arm and a friend holding him up, Sherlock knows that he will not live without John. He can survive, sure, but he will not live. He won't, and it will be his death. He was halfway to the grave before John came. He'll throw himself in if he leaves.
Sarah doesn't answer, and he's glad. At least she doesn't know either.
"And this place, this desert—"
His bed is empty. John is not there.
The gunshot sounded as he reached the last step.
"Why did you leave?"
One day in, and he’s more interested in cracking the patina of this idyllic town than he’s been in anything in months. Bar fights, a biker gang, and a murdered prom queen addicted to cocaine.
"It's alright?"
"—So I figured I may as well finish what he started." Moran grins. "Course, it's never too hard when there's a shag promised, is it? Even for you Holmes," Moran eyes him. "Even for The Virgin. But John Watson would have taken care of that, wouldn't he? And the way you rushed into the flat, it was like you thought you'd be late for the Revelation. Pity you missed it." He smirks. "And all it took was a crumpled shirt. Here I was, thinking you had more brains in your head than your cock."
He wrenches off his coat and scarf, fully intent on diving after John and pulling him out, when John breaks the surface, gasping for air and holding the rucksack in one hand. There is blood in the water around him. Sherlock splashes into the water, nearly tripping over a rock lodged in the sand, and helps John halfway out, his eyes running in a full sprint over him before concluding that the bullet merely grazed the lower half of John's right bicep and that he would very certainly survive.
John seemed to understand and reached down, hauling him back from under his arms as he dragged the two of them back into the house. He laid Sherlock out on the linoleum, and he felt cold, thickened blood seep into his hair. Turning his head, he touched his tongue to the floor. It was delicious, dignity be damned.
There is a werewolf in the middle of London.
“The logical way isn’t always the right one. My kind, we can’t kill. We can destroy, we can annihilate, but we can’t kill. It’s more of an all-or-nothing scenario.”
John buried his head in his bandaged hands, exhaling heavily. "Gum. I've been chewing the gum they gave me."
“Who?” Sherlock persists.
"It doesn't matter what I say,
Someone was calling his name. A jolt over the bond brought him to the surface and he glanced down at John, who had him by the arm, urging him forward.
Sherlock nodded, and stepped back as John approached, carrying a makeshift medical kit of hot rags soaking in bowls of boiled water, needles, thread, the dark bottle.
The sun was dipping low in the sky, casting an angelic pink limn around the clouds. John watched as Gladstone and his rider faded into the distance, merging in the horizon with the oncoming night. He glanced down at the gun, and opened the chamber. No bullets left.
Sherlock grinned against John's chest before he followed him up to the bathroom.
He stood barefoot in his realm of stolen things, and he shut his eyes.
"Suspected—you know where he is?"
John stares into the cold yard for a moment and turns to him, a grim expression on his face.
He doesn't think of much, for once. Just something his father told him when he was a child.
Later, he will wake from where he sleeps on a dirty floor in another busy city, as the sun rises through the windows, and wonder in his exhaustion why it looks the same, no matter where he is.
Sherlock turned his head to the side, staring at him down the bridge of his nose. "Reliable information tells me I don't have one."
"I'm not
Mikheia took a deep, shaky breath. "Thank you."
Mycroft turned away.
record – and then gone somewhere to sleep it off.
Kita stares at her a moment, and he feels anger well up inside him. She looks like she doesn’t even care. She’s not even angry; what is 50,000 yen to her? But this girl has transgressed, and must be punished.
"I do believe it
He had to run. Now.
Mycroft dreaded the moment with every fibre of his being when Sherlock's gaze cleared and he asked where John was. It was going to be cataclysmic, a meltdown of unparalleled fury.
"Sh—Sherlock,
genius. A visionary. A good man—"
"Hello Holmes." He smiles crookedly, eyes glinting. "Miss me?"
It was the shorter man, the polite blonde, who answered.
“What does it say?” Mycroft asks gently. Sherlock resists the urge to roll his eyes.
He said nothing, but raised his cheap little cup in a toast.
"And?"
“Tell me where you are,
"That's a zodiac sign." A voice says behind him and he shuts his eyes. "For Leo, birthdays between July and August—"
“Not with you.” Harry mutters.
“Last I checked we surround ourselves with mad. For god’s sake, the first time I kissed you it was in a filthy alleyway with an unconscious man at our feet. We’re bonkers, John. Sixes and sevens.”
“What? I’ve never had a dislocation and I’ve always wondered.”
John stares at him a moment, eyes narrowing, before he grabs his face and kisses him, catching Sherlock's lower lip between his own and biting gently on it. As he draws away, he grazes his mouth over the corner of Sherlock's as if he was placing a period at the end of a sentence.
“You said he sent you.”
"So you track them, then?"
Zlata frowned and looked at the bracelet, only understanding 'British' and 'give to'.
"Christ, Sherlock!" John suddenly bursts out. "It's not that simple!"
"I'm willing to take that risk."
"How is your head?"
"I'll be watching you, John."
John stared up at him, and in the back of his mind he could feel a warm wash come over him, testing him at the edges.
"I have realised that, Sherlock."
A pulsing, pounding silence greeted him.
“Ugh,
a spine.
"—or I might like it."
Irene stared at him, and blinked, a slow smile coming to her face. “I see. You’re jealous.”
Irene's eyes narrowed. "I think we've already determined the difference between
“Sherlock.” John had hummed, and the man was struck by the sense that he wanted no one else to say his name the way John did. He’d still had a hint of his Scottish accent then, and the way John rolled the r had made his insides curl.
He says his name is John.
"Right, of course." Sherlock took another drag, if only because he didn't know what else he should say. What else he
John grumbles back, and Sherlock traces his ribs, burying his nose into the once-angel’s neck.
A raspy exhale pushes from his crushed chest as it knits itself back together, putting the broken bone back together like puzzle pieces slotting into place. He'd forgotten the Tenebest had a proclivity for headbutting, right up until one of them had smashed its skull into the centre of his chest, cracking through the tough bone of his sternum. If he's had a hard, the bone would have pierced through it and he'd be nothing more than a corpse to bury.
They'd been exploring the bazaars of Baščaršija when it started. John had been playing tourist, haggling with sellers without buying anything, stopping to look at whatever caught his eye, and Sherlock had been looking at him with utter fascination, as if he were realising the true worth of something he had only ever guessed at.
John.
“He’s always been proud of being the only one to leave Sheol. I think he doesn’t want to share the title. Plus he’s a fucking vile, twisted knobhead, so there’s that too. It’s just the way he’s made, like an animal that doesn’t know any better. I think he wanted John to get out, to come here to you and have this thing he wanted for so long, and take it away, just to prove that he could.”
“John,
, Sherlock, slowly, ow, fuck, fuck—okay now it should be line up to my shoulder joint, so the humerus will—will pop back in.”
The bed was easy to find considering it was the largest piece of furniture in the room. Sherlock soon found his back pressed against it, John looming over him, experiencing one of the rarer advantages of catching Sherlock off-guard. He managed to get his jumper off before crawling over Sherlock, burying his hands in that dark mass of curls as he drew Sherlock's face upwards into a warm kiss that pulsed with love and something tender that felt like blood rushing back into a constricted muscle.
is for idiots."
Or: he can go out there now, cry and beg for John’s forgiveness, and a rocky road is paved but exists. John joins him for the remainder of his travel.
“Holy
“There!” Moriarty straightened his cravat. “That was all that needed to be done, darling.”
Of course. Of all the criminals and runaways of the world, it would always be down to John.
“No, but usually the point of keeping me in an isolated dark cell is to torture me, so...let’s have it, then. Do your worst.”
John dashes over the sand, finding that wherever he is, be it London or Qurya, the sand is still the same and he is still a soldier, as he will always be. There's no distinction to be made when sand is flying in your face and it spills into your shoes, no
I do, Mycroft, how could you even think—we still have no clue
“Apologies.” He says in a most unapologetic way, tucking one more into the noodles.
Sherlock stands in the empty hallway, the orange sun setting behind London’s skyline, burning his shadow against the wall as he stares out of the window.
“Can I try it?” Billy asked, watching Harry take the flask back.
“I’m right here, you fucking toff bastard.”
Even when he was away fighting in some war or another – and there was always a war to be had – John had been faithful. Sherlock would follow him, or he wouldn't, or they might choose somewhere together, but they understood implicitly that they were a team, and there would only ever be two.
"Do you know where I can find him?"
Wakes. His mind feels like sunlight, warm and everywhere and untethered. Sherlock is yelling. No, not yelling. He's talking quick and low, hushed, but John knows he wants to raise his voice. Someone else is here then. He can feel them, their presence. Doesn't want to open his eyes. Sleeps.
John glances at Sherlock.
“His death record was filed a few days ago, correct?”
He stares up, head tilted back to stare into the globe of light. There will never be a perfect sphere or circle. It’s mathematically impossible. Most things are, and other forces continue to perpetuate the myth that they aren’t. If you turn a gyroscope fast enough, the center pillar appears to remain in place, keeping the whole operation from collapsing in on itself.
"No," Sherlock said, leaning forward. "No, I think you're smarter than you've led me to believe." His fingers steepled against one another in reflective thought. "Most interesting…"
Irene smiled, glancing over him. “Well, you look wonderful don’t you, darling.”
Sherlock grins bitterly. “You want to spend your last moments staring at a piece of paper…”
The hole in his chest is drying, smooth patches of pale skin gleaming underneath the wet blackness.
"Do you really think I wouldn't search the flat, brother dear?" A voice says from the stairway and Sherlock shuts his eyes as his teeth grind together.
Sherlock stills, his eyes darting to John.
"Ah, well…I mean you can't fake a bullet wound, can you?"
John let his eyes shut.
"I wouldn't want to watch them try, mate." Lestrade chimes in.
He lays John against the tub as he turns on the water, the room still warm and steamy from his bath. Hot air swarms around them as he tries to work around those sprawled wings to rid John of the torn and shredded things that once could be called clothes but were now nothing more than rags; they're absolutely filthy, smelling of old blood and garbage and something almost sulphuric.
—Yeah, I'm on my way down."
“Tell me everything.”
. And for god's sake keep your head down!"
"I know you don't."
God loves everybody, don't remind me
“I could say the same.” John replies.
Soon.
He reminded himself of this fact, however cold it was, as he stepped into the post office, overheated from the packed bodies inside. He waited patiently until it was his turn to step up to the counter and give his name – another false one, like the scores of them before.
Sherlock fell quiet as they approached the back entrance to the palace grounds, silent at the hour. As they crossed the over fields towards the castle park, he could see the porter asleep in his box; so much for security.
"I can't really blame you." He murmurs. "I don't have to like it, but I can't blame you. I don't think I'd be much better anyways.
Going to his knees next to John, he brushed his hair back before uncapping the container and upturning it towards John’s mouth. A thin, measly stream hit his slackened tongue and he tried to swallow around it, but there was barely a capful. John gasped as Sherlock reached under his arms, raising him to sit upright against the counter. He’d have to apologize later. He could hear Billy gurgling in the living room, the faint sizzle of burnt flesh that gave off no smell.
As the car came to a stop, John bolted out, leaving Sherlock behind to pay for once. He couldn't see any lights on inside the cabin, slowing to a stop as he strode up towards the lawn, turning to Sherlock quizzically.
“Trying and succeeding are two separate variables. She didn’t stop and lied to you about it, or she recently picked the habit up again—why?”
"John," Lestrade intercedes, "this is Sherlock Holmes. He's helping investigate on behalf of the FBI. Sherlock, this is Dr. Watson."
They silently draw their weapons; an old Tokarev TT-33 pistol and a rusted iron wrench. Georgiy was never one for war, but the same couldn’t be said for them, the soldier and the scarred spider boy, both adrift in their own penchant for danger, both lost to their lifelong gamble of cheating death.
“John. Don’t move.”
John shuts his eyes, his heart kicking harder and harder as if it's trying to protest what's about to happen. Funny how it would kill him by trying to keep him alive.
He'd watched a number of grainy video clips of the man being interviewed. He had a nervous twitch that indicated the rolling delirium tremens typical of alcoholics. His heavy brow bespoke of a disposition towards deeper thinking, the kind that grew irritated often when interrupted; there was more than genetics in it.
“Yes, I do. I understand that I hurt you, and that it was a consequence of my choice to protect you. I understand that bringing up your estranged sister’s death—yes, that’s what she was, don’t pretend otherwise—was not the correct thing to do, but what I don’t understand, John, is
"You lack so much taste that you go with everything."
“How do we remedy this situation?”
"I couldn't risk your life." Sherlock says quietly.
want one?”
"Ha!" He calls brightly as he feels the edge of the scalpel meet something in the darker recesses of the tender muscle. Carefully, he reaches in and draws it out.
“It killed me, I think, dying for you.” I mutter, caught in the intricate spin of the parquet floors. “I buried myself in salt so I didn’t have to think about it. I was Lot’s wife.”
"Ah, John. I hadn't expected you to take up my offer to visit so quickly. Do you have the time?"
), broken three ribs (
John sighed heavily, ruffling his hair before sitting down.
"Then what do you want to do?"
Slowly, the stillness of the room began to wrap itself around his throat, the deafening roar of silence shoving itself in his ears until he was practically choking on it, until he was mad with it, why him, why now, why, why—
want—"
Not-John smirked, a stream of blood pulpy with bits of flesh spilling from his lips.
"Just…prepare yourself." He sighs. "I'll see you in ten. Drive safe."
He reached back into his bag and unfolded the napkin he'd tied up into a bundle. There was lunch: two apples, a rind of cheese, some jerky. He caught Sherlock staring down at it as he gnawed at the crust of bread.
He breezes past Mycroft, his posture even straighter than Dr Alkaev’s, and Mycroft can sense coldness radiating down his brother’s spine, pooling in his joints and curling around his nerves like ice.
Swallowing was a voluntary act. He had to get John to swallow; taking his other hand, he ran his fingers lightly down his throat, massaging the smooth muscle, and it worked – John latched at the taste, working the lifeblood down his throat, his teeth scraping at Sherlock’s skin.
“—well, and logic. I missed you for three years. I thought you were dead, for three years. Imagine what it’d be like knowing you were dead forever, and I was the cause.”
Jim scoffs.
“Clearly, you care about things other than yourself.”
"No." John smiled emptily and Sherlock felt his hollow laugh, like a reluctant admittance. "Not surviving. Existing, yes, but not living. I was—I was overwintering like a bear in its cave, waiting for sunlight. For change. I didn't know if I'd ever wake up, if I'd ever feel…"
When they finally did manage to get dressed and wander out, it proved rather disastrous.
He was still alive. For now.
"I'll see you later, yeah?" John said, affectionately patting the boy on his uninjured shoulder.
“I had a dream about Harry.” He said, turning to face his husband. Sherlock surveyed him for a moment, an unreadable, blank look on his face.
“Why on earth would anyone want to go to
A beat of silence follows before a heavy sigh falls from the speaker.
“Your separation was only a distraction. You felt John going away, and that’s why you allowed me to bite you. You burnt the ship in the harbour, my darling.”
After the newest affairs were parsed out and the latest misplaced jewelry found, he could tell Sherlock was one missing-wife-run-off-with-the-maid case away from tearing his eyes out just to have something interesting happen, for neither aristocrat nor charwoman offered anything to appease his attention, and when he watched Sherlock take audience after audience in their cramped little salon with the heavy curtains drawn, John was rather reminded of a large cat lying supine in the sun, trading an active mind for comfort, feeding from morsels and growing fat under their deficient succor.
"Sherlock." John said gently, firmly. "Sherlock, look at me." Sherlock let John's fingers guide his chin up. "I will never leave you. Ever. In any circumstance. And maybe you will kill me one day," John admitted, like he was saying there was a chance it would rain today, "But I'd rather it be you than anybody else."
And later, when a couple say down near them: “There’s nothing but old men and farm boys left in Petrograd. There’s talk of burning the monk. I’m still quite cross with you about that, you know…”
As he pulls their teacher aside, a girl runs past their classroom window, screaming wildly, screaming—why is she screaming?
"Well yes, but not an ice bath!" John rings the excess water out into the bin beside him and tries to wipe some off his shirt before giving up and laying the cloth over his face, blanketing him in coolness.
Another gunshot. Another shout.
“It was admittedly very late in the day that I arrived. News of my death had already been broadcast by the time I landed, so…it is feasible that whoever saw me had already formed a conspiracy theory of their own.”
John frowned. Sherlock didn't seem like the type for small talk. His hands thrummed lightly against the wheel. He didn't seem the type to be nervous, either. A sudden thought occured to him through the whiskey fog.
The flat is too quiet. All the lights are off and he stands at his window, scanning the fogged, translucent street for any signs of John.
John is starting to gasp in air. He can't seem to do it fast enough, and each breath leaves him struggling for the next. He feels a cold sweat dampen his hair to his neck and face.
Her head lolled back onto the wall and he took his cue to leave. She would no doubt make a full recovery and he had greater things to worry about.
His brother stared at him for a moment the way a cat might watch something curious, then shrank back, unwinding himself slowly away from his mate.
Sherlock smiled grimly. "I'm afraid a madman got to him first."
"Yes, I'm afraid it does. I have sacrificed too much, I have worked too hard, to let you walk away from this." Moran said lowly. "Why do you think I convinced the agency to take a look at you? To send all those people into your clinic and see what you'd do? To have that mugger ambush you in the alley?"
“I lived in salt for you. For leaving you. Did you know that?”
be the force that took John away from him because he wasn't worth a million John Watsons, even if he tried.
"He did not stab me all the way through." Mikheia said quietly. "He could not get past my collarbone. He was not strong enough." He shivered at the memory, shoulders jumping as if being pushed back. His hand flew up to steady it, rubbing at the darkened skin. "Sometimes at night I can still feel it burning through my skin like I was made of wax, I can feel it melting through my chest."
"Then you'd know what it feels like..." John murmured, barely catching Sherlock's utterly crestfallen face before he shut his eyes.
As Sherlock waited for John in that cold, empty flat they used to share (a fact that they would hopefully resume), he could tell, simply from the things John had left out, all that he had been up to for those whole three years. The skull still sat on the mantle, as did his violin, which he was very happy to see, but that meant, along with the unrented room, that John had not forgotten him which was a very great and terrible thing. There was a woman's scarf hanging on the coatrack where Sherlock used to keep his own, but that was no surprise, since he saw this woman, Mary, around the flat nearly every day, yet by John's attitude towards her Sherlock had come to the conclusion that their friendship was platonic, which led to his conclusion of the obvious: she was a lesbian. Despite her constant presence and John's happiness around her, Sherlock knew that, at the end of the day, John was always alone. And, at the end of the day, so was Sherlock. If John still loved him, if he still wanted him after all he had done, then Sherlock would gladly trade anything if it meant he could be alone with John, together.
Mikheia inhaled quietly through his nose, a steadying breath.
the state of things is tied to me
And so he burned quietly.
“Doctor?” Mycroft asks civilly, his brow furrowing with polite concern.
Words flow through his ears, but they are sucked down into mud and sudden black holes. Someone is talking to him, and he can’t hear them.
She nodded.
"My name is Moran. Sebastian Moran. I have a proposition for you. And I can guarantee that you are not going to say no to me."
"Imagine my surprise when, upon pulling up Ryan John Bise's wedding registry, I find your name. Mary Morstan. Widowed after four months of marriage. I take it the honeymoon didn't last long, then? Or did you meet someone else? Someone who fulfilled your depraved needs with his own? Someone who fed off your love and attention like a parasite and rewarded you with the kind of love only reserved for psychotics? Someone who offered you an escape from a marriage you didn't really want in the first place?"
