Sherlock looked up at him and took a deep breath. He nodded. Molly could see the exhaustion on Sherlock’s face. His whole body was trembling. She grabbed his arm and pulled him up. “Come on Sherlock. Let's visit John and Greg.” She smiled and accompanied him to the stairs, arms slung around his waist for support. Sherlock leaned on her to steady his gait.
He sorted through his thoughts. “I feel peaceful now. But there's also grief and fury. I want to scream at you for jumping, or tie you forcibly down to keep you from leaving. It’s violent. But I also want to hold you, rest with you and keep my hands on your pulse points to convince myself that you are alive; that this is real.” John lowered his hand to Sherlock's wrist and felt his heartbeat. He counted some beats to calm himself down. John’s voice became a whisper. “It’s like a Hieronymus Bosch painting. It gets worse the more I think about it.” He stared at the ceiling, fighting down the onslaught of emotions that so long were absent.
“John,” she said, waiving around a hair pin. “I was the wife of a drug lord. You need a certain skill set for that.”
She packed her discarded clothes into the bag, including her beloved handbag, and hoped that an honest person would find them eventually and take them to a lost-property office or the sacristan.
One evening John walked to St. Bart's hospital. Molly usually worked long hours and John hoped to find her there. Mrs. Hudson's comment about Sherlock never left him. The more he thought about Sherlock's jump, the more ideas came to him, how to stage it. John imagined his own scenarios and how he would set up a fake suicide. In most of them, Molly were involved. To curb his nagging curiosity, he needed to speak to her.
Sherlock settled on his elbows, mustering John. His heated eyes fixed on John's jeans with a clear order to remove them. John chuckled and shimmied out of them. Another sterner glance from Sherlock prompted him to remove his pants as well, which were barely holding his erection.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I am just not ready to meet Mycroft. His superior speech about how he already had known and planned everything is something I am not looking forward to. And I don’t want to be blamed for the current crisis. It’s not, like I had a choice.” Sherlock sighed.
John rummaged through his backpack and retrieved some fresh clothes. “Let's get ready. We need to get out of here. Mycroft doesn't think it is safe for us to stay in Ostrava. He organized a safe house. And breakfast would be great, too.”
The BBC reported how three high ranking NSY officers had been arrested. The subdivisions for curtailing of drugs trafficking and counter terrorism were the most heavily affected. Every minute new allegations were named and another crime was reported. It seemed that with a certain momentum at the base, the higher-ups were no longer able to cover up questionable connections and decisions. Moriarty's web of supporters and facilitators was crumbling.
“This is not a Bond movie,” Mycroft huffed. “And I don’t want to send you into unnecessary risk. But all the planning and the retrieval must be handled by you. I don't have any resources left. Well, what is your answer?”
‘Dear Mrs Hudson, we are not safe. Somebody wants us dead. Please trust me, and follow my instructions: After mass, go into the confessional box. Get rid of all your clothes and dress in the clothes provided there. Do this as quite as possible. You are most certainly bugged. Leave everything in the box. Afterwards, meet me outside of the church. I will explain everything. Please trust me, John.’
Upon entering 221B Baker Street John and Sherlock wished Mrs Hudson a good night. She was ecstatic to be back. It had been a nice change to stay at the countryside, but she had missed her home. The men climbed up the stairs and entered the apartment.
They spent ten days at the safe house without disruption. While the arrests of Moriarty's men had mostly happened on Thursday, the subsequent investigations were the main topics in the media on the following days. Also the vacated positions in politics and courts also needed to be staffed again and suitable candidates were discussed. The media presented fresh faces and proposed personnel that were already retired and now needed to be reactivated. In two countries new elections were announced, because the backlash of the investigations forced even more politicians to resign.
Talking to Sherlock about money was always a lost cause. Of course, he could ask Mycroft for a small loan. But his pride forbade it. He had already thought about cutting costs. Not taking Sherlock out for lunch was one step. John only had five pounds of cash left. Expensive food was definitely out of the question.
John grasped Sherlock's hand in support. The rest of the trip was spent in silence. After some time they arrived at an inconspicuous modern building. It seemed even Mycroft had to relocate his office from the Diogenes Club after the revelation of Mycroft's vast network. John had never been here before and even Sherlock looked surprised at the location. John squeezed Sherlock’s hand in reassurance before releasing it. They smiled at each other. John grabbed Mycroft’s umbrella and they exited the car.
The man cackled. “He just wants to tell you, that he will gladly burn the heart out of you, now. Your friends are history.”
“I can’t get Greg either,” Sally spoke again. “I have the signal of your phone however. I will dispatch some officers now and I will join them as soon as I can. How many people are in the van?” she asked.
The next evening, the soft caresses had became bolder, but were still quite innocent. Sherlock had seemed desperate for touch and had melted into John. That night, John had been startled awake from a nightmare. He had sat up and tried to catch his breath. Sherlock had just pulled him into his arms and planted soft kisses in his hair, on his forehead and cheekbones, calming him back to sleep.
First, he needed to disappear in case someone was trailing him. Second, he had to include John to help him. The first was easy, the second, was a little bit trickier. But Greg was confident, that he could solve whatever this was about.
“I thought you were dead. He gave the order to kill you –” Sherlock struggled for words, “- you and the others. How did you survive?”
With that, she pulled open the door and entered into a cosy bedroom. John followed. The room contained a king size bed, a wardrobe and a desk. Another door led to an en-suite bathroom. On the bed, under some blankets and buried into the pillows the outline of a body could be seen.
John told Sherlock about his adventures in the last week: how the phone and the recording were found by Lestrade, how he got rid of his and Mrs. Hudson’s surveillance and the sniper and finally how Mycroft sent him here.
The last chapter will be split up in three smaller ones, but I will post them all at once next time.
They agreed that the important things would have to be moved downstairs, and the lesser used clothing including disguises would be stowed upstairs. Also the desk would also stay upstairs, in case one of them needed a quiet working space. John’s bed stayed, too, in case they ever had guests overnight. The bedside table, however, would make a nice addition to the master bedroom. John was currently shuffling a chair away from the bed, to gain some space for the small furniture.
At stops in the Netherlands and in Germany, he changed small amounts of money from pounds into euros. He bought himself some snacks and drank way too much coffee. His gun was always readily available hidden in the back of his trousers. But nobody really took any notice of him and he was glad for that.
They were ready to start at four o'clock in the afternoon. A coiffed Sherlock adorned with simple glasses and freshly dyed hair,  and John with a beard, baseball cap and hoodie: A hipster and a back packer on a road trip, probably matched by a car sharing app. They made quite a pair.
John just huffed annoyed and got out of the car. The rain had picked up in the last few minutes and was already drenching him. He threw an evil glare at Mycroft and prepared to close the door more forcefully than necessary.
Despite some confusion, Greg understood most of the content instantly: Sherlock didn't jump because of low self-esteem or harassment, but to save his friends; including him. Greg forced some steadying breaths trying to settle his stomach. He took a sip of his stone cold coffee to chase away the taste of bile on his tongue.
John took deep breaths. He fought the tumultuous emotions back. He took the hand that rested upon his own and clasped it tightly. “I am with you, wherever this may lead us,” he vowed.  Their eyes locked. A shy smile formed on their lips. John’s stomach growled again – and they burst into giggles.
Sherlock stared at her for some seconds. He shook himself and his eyes lost his focus for a moment trying to remember Sally’s number. After a few seconds, he nodded and punched the number into his mobile. He had a connection and it started ringing. Sherlock fidgeted while waiting. His breaths came fast and forced.
With that, he pulled his phone out of his pocket and hit speed dial. He turned around and gave some commands in Czech to his captors. While the man retreated down the corridor, Sherlock could hear, how he ordered the death of his friends.
If everything was going like usual Mrs. Hudson would attend evening mass at St. Mary and he would be able to give her a message. There were no snipers anymore, which were confirmed by the Mail he found, but she could still be bugged, like Greg and John had been.
He tucked his gun inside his jacket, ready to fight if someone attacked him. Way too early for a Saturday morning, a weary but certain Greg left NSY through the underground parking deck. He used all his knowledge of getting out of the building without being seen on public surveillance and tried to keep cover above him. He walked for probably 15 minutes, till a black car pulled up beside him. The rear door opened.
Both didn’t hear the police officer approaching and startled as he addressed Sherlock. “Sir, I just got the order from Mr Holmes, to take you to the Trinity Hospital. Someone is waiting there for you.”
They dropped the car in the darkness of the night on a public parking lot and walked 30 minutes to the safe house. A key code granted them access to the small building. John did a quick check, gun at the ready as he scanned through the rooms. There was a kitchen, a living room and a small bathroom downstairs, and a big bathroom with a master bedroom and another smaller bedroom upstairs.
Molly paled visibly and stared at him. She opened her mouth, but John put his fingers on her lips. He typed, ‘Molly, please. Whatever you know, I need you to tell me. I had snipers following Mrs. Hudson and me. We think Sherlock is still alive. Please, help me out here.’
They spent the following weekend at Mycroft's mansion. After all the arrests and the demise of the prince, even Mycroft and Lestrade had to relax a little bit. To keep them in the loop however, officers and agents dropped by at any time. One evening Anthea stopped by to report on the events regarding the prince. Moriarty however seemed to have vanished. With no leads nothing could be done at the moment.
“No. Just a reminder, that everything that is going to happen will be safe, sane and consensual. I want to do this right. ”
Moriarty’s head and upper body came in view. He wore John's leather jacket and carried a gun. “Hi there, friends of Sherlock,” he began, chewing some gum. “We still have some unfinished business.”
Lestrade felt the beginning of a head ache. He knew the moment, when he picked up Sherlock’s mobile, that something was going on. But he would never have believed in a scheme that big. He sunk into the seat, thoughts running around his head. In the end, he stared at Mycroft and said: "Well, it seems, I am already in. So let's do this."
John was silent. He was angry at himself for letting his guard down. While he tried to wiggle out of the handcuffs, he took stock of his surroundings. Everything was damp and the emergency lights cast eerie shadows around the room. The room was big and the ceiling was more than 10 meters above them. There was a door to his left. It was an air lock but John saw no possibility of opening it from the inside. On the ceiling was a small maintenance hatch, also closed.
He arrived in Ostrava on Tuesday evening to a beautiful sunset. The final rays of sunshine were the first he had experienced since November. London had been clouded in rain and fog since Sherlock’s jump. He hadn’t really registered the absence of sunlight in the last months, but now he realized that he missed it. He basked in the light till the sun vanished below the horizon. Some of the tension that had accumulated during the last few hours vanished from him. He still felt gritty, so he first visited a public loo and refreshed himself a little bit.
John stayed late into the night and continued his discussion with Molly via the computer. Molly assured him, that some keyboard typing way at this time would not be suspicious, if someone was listening in on her.
Molly thought. After some time, she blushed. ‘Post an ad at 'AdultFriendFinder' in the FFM section. Sign it with SoldierBoy. We can then communicate via Private Messaging.’
After an indeterminable amount of time the tall man came back. Sherlock’s bonds were released and he was dragged by two thugs into a small cell. He didn't struggle anymore. Moriarty's network was going to fall, with or without him. And his friends were dead, because of him. There was nothing left for him.
After some minutes he stood up and started pacing. He needed to think. A sniper had watched him, was still watching him? Was he under surveillance? But certainly not here, in the underground levels at NSY?
“Are you sure, you want to hear about my epiphany about sex?” John asked jokingly taking a big gulp of wine. Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock still had no bank account. It seemed that reopening an account after death because of 'suddenly being alive again' was no standard procedure and therefore needed time. It didn't seem to bother him, because currently he was lying on the sofa, staring at the ceiling. He was moping, because John had refused to go out for lunch.
Everything became silent around eight o’clock. John still waited for another hour. Through the crack between the door and the floor he could see, that the light was dimmed to night mode. Silently he crept out of the closet and sneaked down the corridor to the morgue. The lights in there were still on. Behind the doors he saw a petite person illuminated through the frosted glass. He pulled out pen and paper from his pockets an scribbled a short note. He waited till the shadow of the person retreated further into the room toward the offices. He opened the door silently and tiptoed in.
Greg hesitated, but there was no point to not follow the invitation. He slid into the backseat of the car. In front of him sat Mycroft. They met three times before: Once, when he found Sherlock on the streets after an OD, a second time in an official capacity during a peculiar case and the last time at Sherlock's funeral. Additionally they had talked over the phone sometimes, always about issues regarding Sherlock.
John's eyes widened in understanding. “Oh. Sure. Yeah.” He stood up and held out his hand for Sherlock to take. John led him to the Sherlock's bedroom. There he stopped unsure.
John undressed quickly and silently, putting his discarded clothes into the box on the table. After being naked, he pulled the clothes from the bag: Simple cotton pants, vest, a hoodie jacket, jeans, belt, socks and trainers. The clothes were slightly to loose, but the shoes fit perfectly.
The empty plates were put on the ground. They just stayed on the bed, brought each other up to date and shared their ideas. Both enjoyed each other’s company. What was thought to be lost forever was regained again.
Mycroft closed the folder full of verve and leaned back in his chair. “I think, we are done for today. You should stay at my place. Baker Street needs to be swept first, and I would feel safer, when we have an update on Moriarty's whereabouts. Security at my house is adequate. DI Lestrade is also stopping by later to give me an update on the developments regarding the investigations. That might be interesting, too. And in case we forget: Sherlock, you are officially still dead.”
When he arrived at the alley, he looked for the number. He found a small back door that was so unremarkable that even now he almost overlooked it. It opened to a spiral stair case and led up to a small room. Everything there was functional: a bed, a dresser, a sink, a toilet and a microwave – no real kitchen, no bathroom. Not luxurious, but sufficient. He found some basic toiletries and some clean clothes in the drawers of the dresser. He had lived under worse conditions. He stowed the trunk with the rifle under the bed. He had a lot to do.
The cold of the stone tiles crept into his aching bones, dulling the pain. His mouth was parched and tasted vile. Time was slipping by unheeded. There were no shadows to help him calculate the amount of passing time. But it was of no consequence. He was way beyond caring. He just waited for the fog to win and subsume him into darkness.
“What is going through that brilliant brain of yours?” John asked teasingly after they finished their meal. The paper containers and plates were stacked haphazardly on the coffee table.
John calmed himself. He still had time. If he and Mrs Hudson disappeared tonight they might be thought dead. And nobody would think that the sniper hadn’t fulfilled his assignment.
After the fourth ring, which seemed like an eternity, the call was taken. “Donovan here,” Sally's voice greeted him. She seemed out of breath.
John blushed. Of course Sherlock knew about his late afternoon visitor.  “Um, no, she already left.” He diverted his glance at the table. “Food's getting cold,” he added and started loading his plate.
Sherlock heard John climbing into the shower. He had started to whistle. Sherlock shed his coat in a mechanical movement and hung it behind the door. John's whistling turned into a bad Elvis performance and the lyrics of ‘All Shook Up’ carried into the living room.
The DI checked his watch - dinner time. He should finish for today. It was Friday and he longed for the weekend, like a lot of his colleagues. There were still people in the offices with the current workload – overtime everywhere. But going home didn't appeal to him - his marriage was over. His soon to be ex-wife wanted him out of the flat and the divorce filed as soon as possible. There was no love left anymore and he wouldn't be missed. He already kept more clothes at the yard in his locker than at home anyway.
To not endanger the current status quo with Sherlock, he therefore now wanted no-strings-attached sex. It could be called shallow, but that was his simple solution to his current dilemma. John had never picky regarding his partners. It earned him his army nickname. His army mate Bill somehow had stumbled upon his conquests regularly during his army time. Embarrassingly often he had found him with pants down shagging the personnel of the complete Commonwealth Army, men and women alike. And after some time he had started to make fun of the variety in partners.  Especially after he had found him in a seldom used storage room with a transgender nurse, he started joking about John exploring nature, and something about two genders not being enough. Unfortunately, he had been overheard, but Bill saved John's honour (and probably the nurse’s career) by mumbling something about two continents aren't enough and John needing three continents. Somehow the nickname got a different meaning, and neither John nor Bill had corrected anyone about it. ‘Three Continent Watson’ was born, and whenever John was called this way, Bill's face turned brightly red and he fought to keep the giggles in.  During his Army time, he sometimes thought himself a slag but then he lived fast and it felt good.
„Inspector Lestrade," Mycroft began, "some weeks ago we hacked into some rogue surveillance transmission, which was clearly put on you. Every time, when you were above ground, we were able to listen in on you. I am sorry, about the divorce, by the way.” Greg grimaced at that comment.
John braced against the rain and hurried back to his bolt hole. First he changed into dry clothes and then he inspected the content of the backpack. After finding the addresses he thought about getting there. Flying was not an option. He wanted to take the gun with him.
John mustered him intensely. “Please, tell me.” He knew that something was nagging at Sherlock. “If you can't tell me now, after everything we discussed, when else?”
He sneaked into the Hospital before visitors’ closing time. Being a doctor had its advantages now. He knew exactly, how the staff and the security at hospitals worked. The more you looked like you belong, the lesser the chance of getting stopped. And nobody really checked, if all visitors really had left the building.
“Follow the van, please” she instructed. Her heart was beating too fast and her palms had gotten clammy. The cabbie just nodded and sped up. The van had had to stop at a red light further down the road and was therefore still within line of sight. The indicator blinked for a turn to the right.
“Don't worry John. I know the perfect place. And keep your money. If you need to contact me, use the same way again over the internet.”
He rested the barrel of the gun against his lower lip and opened his mouth. While first he was calm, his left hand started shaking with the task. He also raised his right hand to the trigger, trying to steady himself. The shaking got worse. He felt tears on his cheeks. He cried and after endless moments of trying to pull the trigger he vomited onto the carpet. Sobbing and hating himself for being too afraid to pull the trigger, he curled into a small ball on the mattress, bawling for an endless time into the cushion till exhaustion overtook and an uneasy sleep encompassed him.
John smiled at him. “Freshen up a little bit. I'll get the food,” he ordered and Sherlock just nodded.
“Anyway,” Mycroft continued. “We knew the surveillance belonged to Moriarty's sources. Earlier we realised, that the bugs started to fail around you, so we took our chance to pick you up. It seems you no longer have any transmitters on you. With all the moles, it was never safe to approach you. Therefore I am quite pleased, that you solved that problem yourself. I will brief you on what I know and I harbour the hope that you will cooperate with me."
Sherlock startled awake hearing the shower come to life. He was groggy, but the panic was no longer there, replaced by a heavy feeling in his chest. He felt gritty and unsocial, but staying in his room would be childish. A glance at his phone told him, that is was half past eight. He would shower as soon as John was done, and then eat some dinner. Perhaps John and his date would join him.
Moriarty was furious - all his careful planning had been for nothing. His painstakingly groomed and selected supporters had become useless. He didn’t know where he had made a mistake, but something had gone horribly wrong. First: his network was crumbling. Second: Sherlock Homes was still alive. Third: Sherlock's friends were still alive.
First, John put his coat on the hanger and went to the kitchen to make tea. Some routines were hard to break.
This set the pace for the next few days. Most of the time, they watched the news. Due to their involvement with Moriarty, they felt a deep sense of satisfaction with the current proceedings. When hungry, they took their time to cook and eat. If the rooms got too stuffy, they hid behind baseball caps and went for a walk along the nearby river. With the money from John, they bought some fresh produce in a a small whole-food shop some streets further down. They settled into a relaxed and calming routine.
Puh – long ride. Hope you liked it. I am done. RL is currently ... dense. So if i find the time, I might revise some of the story, but I wanted it finished.
Arriving at the front door at 221b Baker Street, he eagerly opened the door. He picked up the mailings from the floor, shimmied out of his coat to put it on the hanger while still holding the bag with the fragrant food.
“Listen; if we do this, I want us to be exclusive. I want to be your partner in every sense of the word. I want to keep what we have, but I want to be intimate with you. I want to kiss you, touch you and make you come. If I come on too strong, I need you to tell me to slow down or stop.”
Molly grabbed her handbag, rummaged through some tissues, lipstick, hairpins and the taser and finally just threw her purse hat the cab driver. With a breathless “sorry,” she exited the cab and hurried to the entrance of St. Bart’s. She almost crashed into the sliding doors which were slightly too slow for her speed. Knowing the hospital intimately she went to the staircase and ran up to the upper most floors. Her lungs burned and her heart was racing. When she reached the entrance door to the roof, she stopped for a second to catch her breath. Sweat was collecting on her forehead and back.
From then on, they enjoyed their evenings in a similar style. They were content with what they had and enjoyed what they could give each other with their hands and mouths. John felt the shyness and shame of being attracted to Sherlock vanishing as he gained confidence in his feelings. He was thankful for the security of the safe house and the time they were given to explore what they had found. There was no need to hurry or to hide anymore. They were moving in the same direction. The speed didn’t matter.
“Let's get on the chair; it might buy us some time.” John instructed. All three stepped on the chair and watched the water rising.
The kisses became more heated. Sherlock felt desperate. It wasn't enough. John pulled back. A small whimper escaped Sherlock's lips.
John tried to help as much as he could. But he was in no official capacity so he was left with minor work in the background. He was a sounding board for Greg regarding the strategic planning. And he helped to set up a safe-zone at some of the NSY meeting rooms. He de-bugged them and took care that they were without surveillance. It was tedious, but better than just waiting. The days just blurred into each other.
John dimly acknowledged Sherlock’s arousal from time to time. But ii didn't feel threatening or demanding. It just made him aware of own arousal during the following evening. Legs intertwined, their erections were pressed together. It just felt too good, and John started to slowly move his hips to gain some friction against the fabric of the pajama bottoms and Sherlock's hips.  The slow build-up of caresses and strokes led to a surprising release for both of them. While coming down from his high, a wave of emotions collapsed over John. He gulped in some desperate and panicked breaths.
Mycroft had even contacted the family of the Arab prince. The good news was that they weren’t supportive of their stray family member. But they were also helpless. The prince had fled the country because he had wanted to duck out of some duties that he had had to fulfil as part of the ruling family. He was now milking the family's funds and his status as a diplomat. Any further official action from Mycroft against him would lead to a diplomatic incident, because in a formal capacity, the family could not accept a prosecution against one of its members in another country. But on the other hand, the family had no way, to transport the Prince back home. It would lead to an open quarrel that could destabilize the reign of the current king. Mycroft was at his wit’s end.
Anne was all he needed for that purpose and after their first encounter, they exchanged their phone numbers and agreed, that a sole shagging relationship would be fantastic. Today was the fourth time they met and shagged, but the first time at Baker Street. John only took her to Baker Street, because he knew Sherlock was at Barts for an experiment which usually lasted long into the evening. No need to introduce her to Sherlock and explain awkwardly his new resolutions. He thought the arrangement was perfect. All was well.
He resolved to buy the ticket at St. Pancras station. He had two hours to catch his train. He packed his backpack fast: Some clothes, the med kit and the folder with the material for the fake papers. All of his money and the gun went into his pockets.
“The thing is,” John continued, “I love being in Baker Street, solving cases, chasing killers and hanging out with you. I will not risk that again. But I also want some intimacy. Celibacy is not for me. Believe me, I tried. I just get grumpy.”
The cabbie came to a halt at the private road. “I can't go in there, Ma'am, or I'll lose my licence.” He turned toward Molly and waited for instructions.
Greg sobered and took a sip of his now luke-warm coffee. It didn't help to settle his stomach. The queasy feeling remained. He clicked through the last photos. Three shaky snap shots of people, minding their business in London. Greg startled and zoomed in on the last one. It was a picture of the older victim he currently investigated. He checked the time stamp.  How did he end up on Sherlock's phone almost two and a half months ago?
Sherlock however was speechless that everything had turned out well in the end. Mrs Hudson was unharmed, so were Greg and John. He wanted to thank Molly and Sally for their help, but he couldn't find the words. In the end, he shook hands with Sally and hugged Molly. He struggled to keep his composure.
Molly stopped in her tracks. The van faced away from her and she couldn’t see the driver, but the motor of the vehicle was still running. This seemed off. She crouched behind a parking car and watched. Some seconds later the tall man stepped out of the alley again. John was slumped against him and dragged toward the van. The sliding door opened on the left side and John was carelessly dumped in. The man jumped in with him and pulled the door close. The van was already accelerating before the door clicked shut.
There he bought his ticket and some food and waited for the departure of his train in a small coffee shop. In the meantime he connected to the hotspot and created an account at Adultfriendfinder with his William Miller alias. He left a short message from SoldierBoy in the FFM Forum.
John had already made up his mind. Waiting for something to happen in his bolt hole made him crazy. He couldn't help Lestrade in an official capacity. He had nothing to lose, probably not even his job anymore. He was gone for over a week now. His current employer wasn’t really impressed with his work ethics. He had been overtired and grumpy most of the time. And according to Greg not even a missing person’s report was filed for him.
“Not one so far,” John said. He cursed himself a fool for thinking that the game had been over. Worry was settling in his gut. Sherlock would be next on Moriarty's list and he was in no position to warn or help his partner.
Sherlock and John left the office. Mycroft still had some work to do and stayed. He watched them leave. They didn't bother with personal space anymore he noted. Not that there was a lot in the past, but they now acted more like one unit than ever. Mycroft just shrugged and returned his attention to his files.
After twenty minutes, the van turned left on a small road that was closed to the public. They had arrived at a rundown industrial area by the Thames that had its prime shortly after the Second World War. Now according to the improvised company signs only some import-export business had remained. Some shabby cars lined the streets.
John bought another coffee and a tourist map at the station. After studying it, he had a rough idea where he needed to go. Without hesitation, he walked for 15 minutes to the address Mycroft had given him.
Her eyes widened, but she nodded. She motioned him over to a cluttered corner with an old lab computer, opened a word document and started to write.
A tall man stepped in, phone in hand. “Yes, understood. I will get to it immediately.” He sounded eager. He shed his black leather jacket and threw it on the kitchen counter.
Sherlock went back upstairs and grabbed the bedside table with verve. The drawer, which had always been quite loose, slid out, and its content clattered to the floor. Amidst pens, buttons and some change John's gun case landed with a dull thump on Sherlock’s toe. Sherlock suppressed a pained yelp and watched how a letter fluttered open and glided to its resting place in front of him.
“With your information, John, we can safely say, that the third sniper is taken care of, too. That is probably him.” Mycroft put the photo down in front of John. John took a look at the picture and nodded.
The cabbie followed the van to the outskirts of London. Her driver was clever enough to recognize the seriousness of the situation. He did everything to stay close enough to the van but not be obvious about it. The trip took longer than expected. Somewhere along the road, she was able to get a peek at the licence plate. After a short search by Sally, she confirmed it was a rented car. Sally informed Molly that she was now on her way with some officers to her location. She was able to call in a helicopter, but she now had to cut the phone call short.
Mycroft took a pained breath. The rain was picking up and drumming against the roof of the car. “Let me explain first. You can decline later.” John nodded to indicate, that he was willing to listen.
Sherlock smiled. “I had something at my disposal you obviously missed,” Sherlock said. “I did something that the great Moriarty missed.”
Shocked, Moriarty crumbled to the ground. Sherlock took a step back to avoid Moriarty grabbing him. He smiled at Molly and looked back at the twitching Moriarty on the ground. He was still conscious, but unable to move. The gun had tumbled from his hands and now lay beside him. Sherlock kicked it further away.
Meanwhile John awkwardly entertained  Anderson and Dimmock. Anderson was mostly bemoaning the workload, because some of his colleagues were still suspended, and Dimmock complimented John's vintage leather jacket. He was a biker and loved the old style. After that, their discussion fell flat and they caught the last part of Greg’s report about Nick's homophobic parents. John patted Sherlock’s back affectionately. Sherlock had stiffened a little bit. John knew better now: Sherlock wasn’t alarmed by sex. He was just cautious of the reactions of people with regards to sex. Sherlock never liked people that made fun of minorities. And being gay still set him apart from others.
Moriarty just grinned and continued. “John, John, John, you naughty boy. You killed Sebastian, my most loyal man. Haven't taken you for someone to collect trophies. I took the freedom to retrieve Sebastian’s jacket. It's vintage, you know. I bought it for him,” he purred. “But back to business. Because our dear detective refused to die in the first place, I now need to kill you - a deal is a deal.” He grinned insanely. “So sorry,” he whispered. “And don’t worry. I will take care, that Sherlock mourns you – but not for long.” With that, Moriarty vanished and bolted the hatch shut.
John knew instantly, that the phone wasn’t Greg’s original one. “It’s from Mycroft: High end technology, special encryption software, no possibility to be spied on, doesn’t work on regular frequencies,” Greg explained. “But that’s not important now. Here, listen. But I think, you should sit down first.”
John should have felt nervous or afraid. But he just felt calm and focussed. He had a purpose. Somehow everything started to make sense. Sherlock did not commit suicide, it was murder. If it had been possible, he would have traded his life for Sherlock's. He had been willing to do so at the pool with Moriarty a year ago. And now it seemed Sherlock had done the same for him, and for his friends. He couldn’t be angry any more at Sherlock for abandoning him. Now he was furious at Moriarty for forcing Sherlock into committing suicide. The intense emotion felt good. He would use it to  revenge his best friend. Even if it was the last thing, he would do.
He found a small internet cafe, run by a bored Chinese woman, and bought an access for half an hour. The new cap shielded his face ideally from the surveillance cameras.
The younger victim was identified with the help of the missing person’s database: Nick Henley, 19. He had ran from home 3 years ago and his parents had reported him missing then. They had provided photos and distinguishing markers for the search. Now it helped to identify him without any doubt. Greg decided to tell the parents the bad news, when he knew a little bit more about the circumstances of his death.
John placed his wine glass on the tablel and joined Sherlock at the window standing directly in front of him. “I am making a deduction now. If I am wrong, call me an idiot, give me a lecture about how I see but don’t observe and then forgive my blunder. But if I am right, then feel free to join, okay?”
“Don’t worry John. Tell me, what is this about? It is almost, like my late husband is back. Are you in trouble?”
John moved back to Baker Street six months ago. They started to rebuild and strengthen their consulting business and their friendship. Sherlock made a conscious effort for more communication and less maniac behaviour. John channelled his anger into sports and work. Back were the easy companionship, exciting cases and slow evenings with take-away food and bad telly. One year ago, he never had dared to hope, to have all that back again and he was deeply thankful.
After thanks and goodbyes to Irene and Kate they took off. They crossed through Poland without any complications and arrived in Berlin within six hours. No one bothered to check them when they crossed the borders. The EU open border policy worked in their favour and everything went according to plan. The safe house was located on the outskirts of Berlin and was easy to find. It was a small cottage and stood a little remote from other buildings.
“Usually I would say no, but after all this, I make an exception.” the cabbie unlocked his phone and handed it to her. Molly dialled 999. There were no options left. She had to explain the whole situation to some operator. The problem was that even she didn’t know exactly what was going on.
Greg tried to keep calm. Currently he didn't know, what was going on. He hoped Mycroft was on his side and would help him.
John called the maid and asked for some dinner. The savoury soup, some bread, cheese and sausages were exactly the food they needed. They picnicked on the bed. Both devoured every last crumb. Neither John nor Sherlock had eaten properly in the last months, but now had found their appetite again. One of the main reasons for their lack of appetite – grief - was gone.
John tried to sit up. He mustered Greg up. He had a small laceration on his forehead, but the blood had already congealed. Mrs Hudson seemed unharmed. Greg jerked awake.
John just rolled his eyes and left the car. Before exiting, he indicated towards the umbrella. “May I borrow that? Rain’s a bitch.”
Greg was also visibly frustrated. He was a man with high morals, and he hated the rich and mighty that could escape prosecution with diplomatic immunity. “Sometimes I wish, we were in a Bond movie and we just could deport or execute those guys,” he snarled.
Greg also considered calling DI Dimmock, but he had been transferred to investigate a series of murders in Brighton over two weeks ago.  A return of him without a closure of the case would have been suspicious. Sally declared Anderson as a lost case, too. She couldn’t believe that he could keep his cool. All the work with Sherlock had shown, that Anderson wasn't really the best man in the force. Even Sally had to admit that after all the investigations that had to be redone due to Sherlock's fall and rehabilitation.
John would have never described his sexual encounters with women as boring, but the foreplay Sherlock engaged him in made all his previous experiences pale in comparison. He was hot, sweaty and incredibly turned on. Sherlock kept him on the edge and prepared him thoroughly. When he felt Sherlock entering him, he was desperate and calm at the same time. Desperate for more, but calm, because he knew he was safe. His orgasm crept up on him and took him to a serenity he had never known before. Seconds later Sherlock collapsed on top of him. They both needed some minutes to catch their breath and calm down.
The next morning, the alarm on his mobile still set to his shift went off. He was groggy, but thankfully numb. He unloaded his gun and shoved it and the letter into the drawer of the bedside table; out of sight, out of mind. He showered, cleaned up the mess and went to work. Business as usual – the world was still dull, grey and distant.
And therefore Greg had no help anymore on the homicides. He was sure, that many new cases could have been solved by now, if Sherlock had been available. Most of them would probably have been bloody obvious to him. Even Greg felt, that he missed something vital. With the current case load he felt like a hamster, always kept busy in a wheel of never ending work, but essentially unimportant.
John arrived in time at Greg's office. He felt nervous and jumpy. Despite being Saturday, some people were still working at the Yard. Greg saw him and hurried through the door to join him on the corridor, holding a folder in his hand. With a gesture he indicated to keep quiet. John threw him a puzzled glance but complied. Greg ushered him to a staircase dragging him along downstairs.
He turned towards John. “John, if you want your own room, now that we are back in London, I understand -”
Sherlock swayed dangerously on the ledge. He blinked in disbelief, casting his eyes around, helpless. His eyes always landed again on the gun, clearly calculating the chances of Moriarty firing it. Molly felt helpless. She couldn’t risk firing the taser at Moriarty. The muscle spasms might trigger the gun and kill Sherlock.
“I don’t really know. I had a sniper following me till some days ago. He was found murdered in an alley. I was bugged. Mycroft assumed, that you and Mrs. Hudson are, too. My divorce provided me with a complete cut to my routines and clothes. Probably there is still some surveillance on my ex, but that is no longer important. And we got rid of your bugs and surveillance as long as you don’t return to Baker Street. But snipers could still be waiting out there for you and Mrs. Hudson. We have to get you off the grid, get confirmation if you are still shadowed and get you and Mrs. Hudson to safety. The thing is: You have to do that on your own. I am trying to support Mycroft with other operations. I can provide you with a gun, a secure mobile, some cash and a bolt hole. You need to find the people who are out to get you and Mrs. Hudson. When you have dealt with them and want to help, report back to me. We can go from there. Are you game?”
Sherlock sat, blinking at the empty space, John left. Thoughts were running through his head from ‘done with girlfriends’ to ‘casual sex’ and ‘becoming asexual’. He didn’t know if he should comment John’s statement or keep silent. After a few moments, John returning for a second trip, he cleared his throat.
“John,” he said, directed at him, waiting for John to turn his eyes on him. “Thanks,” he halted, “for telling me. You didn’t have to. And you don’t have to keep it outside Baker Street. I won’t interfere…”
Greg strode towards Sherlock and pulled him away from the fridge. “You bastard,” he grinned and embraced him in a tight hug. “You crazy, crazy bastard,” Lestrade prattled, hugging him even tighter.
Sherlock grasped the door handle and led them in the bedroom. He kissed John deeply and guided him toward the bed. The frantic groping from moments ago slowed to sweet caresses. They undressed slowly. The clothes piled around them on the floor and they climbed onto the bed. Every bit of exposed skin needed to be kissed and touched. This at least was familiar territory now. They had been worshipping each other since their first days in Berlin.
“I hate travelling by train,” he exclaimed, “I’m not going to move again for the next few hours.” With that, they both got comfortable on the bed like it was a big sofa and slowly started talking. It took them well into the night to get up to speed with each other.
John decided on a cup of tea before crawling into bed. He just put the kettle on, when his phone chimed, indicating a text message.
“Okay, but the other reasons still stand, why I don't want to entertain anyone here. I just don't trust myself sometimes. I don't want to get caught up so deep again. Perhaps it's my kind of drug that I want to avoid. Before Afghanistan, I dabbled into everything. Name a kink and I probably did it.”
First he needed to stay low key. His time with Sherlock taught him, that nobody watches common people. His new clothes were common enough and cheap. He sought a quiet spot in an alley behind some dumpsters. He needed an overview of the current situation and a plan. He knew about military stealth operations. Now he had to think like a soldier again.
Irene laughed. “It seems the information we both heard about each other was wrong. Good for us. Follow me.” She walked down a corridor and led him to a door. John trailed behind her numbly.
“This way, Mrs Hudson,” he indicated and steered her away. While he explained what happened so far - the recording, the coercion, Greg’s help, the sniper - Mrs Hudson took everything surprisingly well.
Later on they stopped by NSY. Greg had gotten a promotion and had replaced the old Superintendent. His workload had doubled overnight. It would take months to wrap up all the open investigations, but they somehow ran smoother. It seemed Moriarty’s men had deliberately used their positions to slow down police work in the past.
This is my note – to say goodbye. I never realized how empty a life can be. I lost something precious, and I am done losing.
“Yes,” Molly shrugged. “I saw how John got abducted. I followed him and called Sally in. She sent some police officers to retrieve him.”
The next morning they were woken by the alarm. Usually they slept in, but now they had to be ready when Stella picked them up. They enjoyed a generous breakfast and dressed in their disguises. John’s beard had grown impressively thick and the leather jacket gave an additional bulk to his frame. Sherlock still had red hair, but the roots were starting to show. Both donned baseball caps and checked their appearances. With all the visible differences in clothes and hair and Sherlock’s talent of impersonating people, they were highly unlikely to be recognised.
He dumped his keys, wallet and jacket onto one of the kitchen chairs. Only then he noticed John leaning at the kitchen counter. John just waved a short hello, munching on a sandwich. At a second glance Greg noticed another person behind the opened fridge door riffling through its content.
John’s spirits were soaring after he had confirmation that Sherlock hadn't died. But he was still worried, because he didn't know if his friend was currently okay. And while he was miffed, that he hadn't been able to help Sherlock two months ago and had mourned him, he was grateful, that Molly was able to support him. He understood that Sherlock had played a difficult and dangerous game against Moriarty, and he even accepted that Sherlock had no way of including him - especially, if they had been under close surveillance. John was impressed, that Sherlock was able to pull this all off. So much the worse he felt for his last argument with him: He called Sherlock a machine – but all the time Sherlock was trying to set everything up to fool Moriarty and get everyone out alive. There was one thing, John was certain of: Friends protect friends. And Moriarty had done his best, to seperate Sherlock from his friends. Unfortunately he succeeded. After everything John learned so far, he knew he did Sherlock a disservice and did not deserve Sherlock's loyalty. He wanted to make it up to him.
Stella had briefed them, that there was a car waiting for them in the pick-up area. The driver already stood at the exit door for the arrivals, looking for John. After a short greeting he led them to a black car, stowed the bags in the trunk and ushered them in on the back seats.
However John couldn't avoid reality anymore. The bills stacked on the mantel piece of the hearth. He needed to pay them. He couldn't afford any late fees.
The hours after his capture were horrible. He was dragged into an underground chamber of an old castle. They ripped away his clothes, forced him to his knees, tied him up, beaten him, taunted him. But nothing was done to cause serious damage. They just wanted to inflict pain. It was clear to Sherlock that they waited, were ordered to keep him alive. After some time, a tall, vaguely familiar man appeared. Sherlock cursed his brain for being so sluggish.
John just shrugged. He felt quite relaxed and his private mission to find Sherlock had been a striking success.
“Dr Watson,” the driver spoke once seated, “I will take you to Mr. Holmes first. He wants to be debriefed.” John just nodded.
“W-what is happening to me? It shouldn’t be like this. I c-can’t be like Harry!” he stammered, confused.
Sherlock mustered Moriarty up. Molly could see that he wanted to play for time. “That is John's jacket,” Sherlock stated.
John shook his head, slightly embarrassed. “I think confession time should be over.” He moved to stand up.
“Perfect.” Irene said. “Kate and I will leave for Canada this evening. I don't intend to spend more time than necessary in the vicinity of Moriarty. We need to get everything ready.”
1. Take off your clothes and put them all (!)  in the box including shoes, watch, underwear, belt and mobile.
John stared at the bed. Struggling into a sitting position was Sherlock. He looked dishevelled, pale and way too thin. The shirt and pyjamas bottoms were too big on him and made him appear even smaller. Some bruises were visible on his cheekbones, jaw and arms. Disbelief was written on his face.
Slowly John regained his consciousness. The smell of mouldiness hit his nostrils. His hands felt numb and his head felt dizzy. He lay on the floor with his hands cuffed behind his back, and his feet were bound with tape. Coldness was seeping into his bones. His jacket was missing. Beside him, he heard a pained groan. He rolled over to get a better view. Beside him was Greg Lestrade, likewise bound. Mrs. Hudson sat slumped on a wooden chair, unconscious and also handcuffed. But mercifully she hadn't been dropped to the cold, hard ground.
Molly fished out her mobile from her handbag. Her hands froze. She had no valid number of Sherlock's anymore. She didn’t want to call the general police hotline, because she had no way of explaining the urgency or the seriousness of the kidnapping. She scrolled through her contacts. Greg Lestrade was the best option to call. The voicemail sounded over the phone on the first ring. Molly swore and hung up. She retried but got the same result, but she left a short message.
A small laughter escaped them both. John released them and wiped his hand against the bed sheets. Sherlock pulled John closer, not minding the stickiness between them. They enjoyed their nowfound closeness, and were both relieved, that the important bits were said today. Both were happy, sated, home. Finally.
Martha was shocked. But on the other hand, she had regularly dealt with Sherlock and his clients. This was not so absurd. She waited through mass and went through the motions. Then she bid good bye to her friends. John heard her say, that she wanted to pray a little bit for Sherlock. He had to congratulate her on that. It seemed a reasonable excuse to get rid of them, even if someone was listening in on her. John left the church with the last churchgoers.
The Operation “De-Bugging”, as they called it, would start in three days, a Thursday morning. In a coordinated effort all incriminated personnel would be arrested in on concentrated effort. Till then, Greg and Sally needed to coordinate their people and put them on Moriarty's helpers. If the operation went wrong, it would have dire consequences for Mycroft and his supporters. If this went right, it would be a serious setback for organised crime.
When they calmed down again, John took off his leather jacket and shoes and sat on the bed to join Sherlock. He groaned as he made contact with the mattress and just let himself fall backwards.
Martha Hudson also startled wake up. She blinked slowly and straightened in the chair. Her eyes cast around and rested on John.
Mycroft couldn't discern any obvious injuries and just nodded. He knew that Sherlock was resilient and detested any weakness of his body. He decided to trust John Watson's assessment of Sherlock's injuries and their treatment. Mycroft turned back to his folders and picked up another, thicker one. “The second sniper was found almost three weeks ago in an alley. As soon as his photo was uploaded on the NSY server, a Europol database confirmed him as Frank Bauer, a German sniper. Greg Lestrade could not make heads nor tails of it.”
“Welcome, my dear Doctor. It is good to see you - alive,” she greeted him. “There was a terrible rumour of you being killed.”
After some coaxing from John, Sherlock dressed and was willing to go out. Sherlock grabbed his coat, and handed over John’s leather jacket. John had gotten so used to it by now, that he didn’t have the heart to bin it. It was his trophy over Moriarty. With their usual bickering they bounded down the stairs.
“I think I wrote it two weeks after New Year.” Sherlock processed the information. He was luckier, than he had imagined. Everything could have gone wrong. A few days later, he had lost his will to live, too.
Yesterday, unbeknownst to John and Lestrade, Sherlock had visited Nick’s boyfriend. Mycroft had been his usual meddling self and procured a grant from a small foundation that supported young musicians. It wouldn’t replace Nick, but it could help him to find his purpose in life and overcome his grief. Again, Sherlock had to admit, that Mycroft was good to have around.
The other victim only had an empty wallet on him. No home address or next of kin was to be found and nobody seemed to miss him. Both victims were strangled from behind and were disposed in dumpsters in back alleys. One back alley wasn't even far away from New Scotland Yard. There was no clue regarding the killer or killers, but the method of killing was similar. Both victims were estimated to be dead for three days.
Sherlock took off his suit jacket and joined John on the couch. They ate in silence, only the television kept it from becoming uncomfortable.
John observed Sherlock basking in the afterglow. The pale skin was flushed and his face was relaxed. His eyes were closed and a tear was stuck in his eyelashes. Sherlock opened his eyes; they were glassy and a little bit red-rimmed.
“Now I finally meet the famous Sherlock Holmes in person,” he snarled. “My boss sends his regards. He suspected that you were still alive. Nice trick though. We detracted the gunmen first. But as soon as Jim doubted your demise, he put them back on track. Thanks for giving us proof.”
“I don’t know. But I will investigate,” he promised. With that he waved goodbye to Matt and Mrs. Hudson and returned to his bolt hole. Now he was free to fight along Lestrade against Moriaty. And perhaps find an answer to the now niggling question: Could Sherlock still be alive?
John enjoyed his tea, the silence and the comfort of his chair. All was back like it used to be. And that was more, than he had ever dared to dream of. With all the excitement gone, he nodded off.
The inspector felt his stomach drop. Only one person came to his mind with this peculiar contact list: Sherlock.
Long moments later, with some effort Sherlock broke the kiss. Both were breathing harder. Sherlock looked slightly dazed and his pupils were dilated. “For the record: I am clean. No STIs. And I know, you are, too. So condoms are optional.”
After a long time, John calmed down a little bit. “My father sometimes came home drunk.” He started to explain without being prompted. “He always was clumsy, when he entered the house: Banging open doors, tumbling over the carpet, stumbling into cabinets. There was no chance of not noticing him. The day after he found out about Harry being gay, he hit her. He told her, that she was useless and no daughter of his. I could hear everything from my room upstairs. I was too frightened to go downstairs. The following weeks my dad spent a lot of time with me, talking to me about being a man, about women, stuff like that - and how Harry had disappointed him. Then, I thought, he was right. I thought things had to be a certain order: Men married women, had to build a house for his family, plant a tree, father his childern, protect them.” John paused, gathering his thoughts. Sherlock waited patiently, hand resting on John's hip till he continued.
People stared at him. The whole speech was somewhat unprompted, but the last days had been not business as usual anyway. After some seconds, they started to whisper to each other and returned to their work.
Sherlock mind fought a last time against the red-grey haze that surrounded him. He knew the voice - The Woman.
Around six, the sun was already gone, he started to get ready. He packed a small bag and left for church. When he arrived, he was glad that the area was still deserted, but the church was open. He entered and went into one of the confessional boxes. He opened the cabin and dropped the bag inside. Then he left the church again and waited in a spot, where he could observe the entrance.
Sherlock propped himself up. “John. Calm down. It doesn’t have to mean anything.  I apologise.” Sherlock pulled away looking crestfallen.
During the last part, John dug out the med kit and did a check up on Sherlock. Surprisingly, Sherlock didn't protest. Despite being way too thin, all his wounds and bruises had healed adequately. John could tell that he had been restrained and beaten severely. Irene had done what was necessary to help Sherlock and had paid a doctor to check for internal injuries, but nothing life threatening had been found. Some of the wounds like those on his wrists, back and knees might scar, but John could minimize that by proper aftercare. Sherlock also sustained three cracked ribs, but they had started to heal nicely. John felt a simmering fury, when Sherlock told him, that he had been locked in a cellar to die. No food, no water, no one to check up on him. He could have choked to death on his own vomit. Prisoners of war would have gotten better treatment.
Sometime after midnight both were yawning more than talking. They were exhausted; John by the long trip and Sherlock was still recuperating from his ordeal as a captive. Both felt comfortable where they were, so they just drifted off to sleep, side by side. The sleep was deep and merciful without any nightmares troubling them.
Sherlock was happy. It was a warm spring evening, and he was walking back from Bart’s Hospital to Baker Street. He finished his experiments early. After three sets of test on smokers’ lungs, his hypothesis was proven without a doubt and the current case could be closed. He decided to walk back home, picking up some dinner on the way - Thai - for John and him. There was a light spring in his step, which was an obvious sign for his good mood. Of course, only people knowing him well enough would be able to see that and deduce his current state of mind.
“Can I borrow your phone?” she finally asked the cabbie after coming to a decision. She didn’t know Sally’s number by heart, but she had to make an effort to inform the police.
Sherlock would have preferred more privacy at Mycroft’s, but with all the loneliness he had endured in the last months he somewhat basked in the company. He discussed cases with Lestrade and bickered with Mycroft. John was a constant and calming presence at his side, available for a kiss or a short cuddle. The evenings ended with good food, lots of wine and laughter. Sherlock and John spent their short nights together, but they weren’t able to recreate the lazy times of the safe house. They missed their home - Baker Street.
He slowly went to Molly's office in the back and entered her field of vision carefully. She looked up at him and a small smile grew on her lips. Before she could start with a greeting, John put his finger on his lips to indicate for silence. He gave her the note.
Greg and John emerged from the examination room 20 minutes later. Both were dressed in scrubs. Their wet clothes were stowed in some bags. They had been checked and the release papers were ready to sign. The water had been freezing cold and they had been submerged longer than sound, but both were healthy adults with more than average muscle mass and had withstood the cold better than expected. They were ordered to keep warm for the rest of the day and ingest some hot beverages and food. Some paracetamol was prescribed to ward off any inflammation.
Sherlock indulged in the memories how he and John became closer over time, from formal handshakes to a pad on the shoulder, and one time a hug from John after a gruesome case with a happy end. Sherlock had no delusions about himself. He knew that he was not easy to live with; his only redeeming quality was his intellect. And he knew that John only saw him as a friend and was never attracted to him. He only had himself to blame, if John thought of him as a 'machine'. Hie riled John up on purpose, to chase him away. But currently when Sherlock felt his strength waning, he couldn’t stay aloof anymore. He didn't want to be alone. He was afraid. He imagined nothing elaborate, just a scene of being in bed with John cuddling closer to him and not being rejected, enveloped in a warm and secure space, resting.
“Don’t worry. I will… Yes, I will disappear as soon as this is finished. Finally time for a vacation, two months of surveillance is a bitch. … I could have made a fortune with other assignments, you owe me….  Yeah, Bye.” With that he cancelled the phone call and stepped to the window, checking the view.
“Is this real?” John asked after a few moments. “Did he -,” John started, but he needed to take a calming breath. “Did he jump because he had been forced to do it? Us or him?”
John slowly raised the gun and stepped out of the bathroom. “On your knees, hands above the head,” he said menacingly.
John and Sherlock greeted each other with a hug. Greg just grinned and asked Molly and Sally for details about Moriarty. Everybody seemed to be talking at once.
Sherlock gazed into his glass of wine. His fingers fiddled around the stem of the glass, his feet restless. His mind was already connecting all the new information he gathered. John slept with men, John had thought him to be asexual or celibate, John wanted to stay. Was there hope? But even if John wanted men, it could be that he didn't want him. He felt out of his depth.
John felt bone deep tired. It was Saturday late in the morning, more than two months after Sherlock’s death. The grief didn't seem to lessen, when he remembered that day. He worked as much as he could, for work kept his morbid thoughts at bay. He just came back from a night shift at the A&E and he hoped, he could fall into a dreamless sleep till afternoon. He didn't want to feel. He just needed rest.
Sherlock frowned. John pressed on. “I am done with girlfriends. The whole disaster with Mary taught me, that its not what I want or need. I don’t want domesticity, a house in the suburbs, a 9 to 5 job or a family with 1.4 children. I am happy here. I have everything I need here,“  he faltered a little bit. “What you probably witnessed when you came home,” he hesitated a little bit, stealing a short glance at Sherlock, “is not a new girlfriend. It is just an arrangement for casual sex.” He lowered his eyes down to the wine glass in his hand, contemplating the last sip.
“Pick him up, we need to hurry,” she ordered. Something heavy was dumped beside him. He was lifted up and carried over someone’s shoulder out of his cell. With the sound of the door closing, he lost his consciousness.
It felt strange for John, to return to Baker Street after more than three weeks. When he had left, it was originally to quickly answer Greg's call. He had never imagined that he wouldn't return for such a long time. John was a little bit afraid of what the apartment would look like. However Mycroft’s men had taken care of the perishable goods in the fridge and thoroughly cleaned the flat. They had also extended the courtesy to Mrs Hudson’s lodgings. On the other hand, Mycroft's minions had probably searched through their belongings for bugs until no piece of privacy was left. A clean flat was at least a little bit of compensation.
“It is good to be back,” Sherlock said seriously. He hadn't expected to be missed and furthermore to be welcomed home with such warmth. The hugs of his brother and Lestrade had left a joyful feeling inside him. People usually didn't touch him.
John divested him of his pants. He was captivated by the view: Pale skin, lean body, taunt muscles. The bruises were almost completely healed and didn't mar him anymore. With caution he took Sherlock’s member in his hands and stroked upwards. It felt like velvet, similar to his own. The effect was immediate. A deep groan reverberated through Sherlock. John licked his palms, and repeated the motion again with more confidence. He tried different rhythms and positions of his hands, he fondled Sherlock's balls and stroked his thighs. Every time, he felt Sherlock coming close, he stopped and waited, resting the hands on the hipbones and calming him. It was fascinating to watch. After some time, Sherlock was flushed and sweating. First he groaned, then whined and swore. In the end, he begged. John finally took mercy on him. Sherlock came with a low and relieved groan, spilling onto his belly and John’s hand. John felt elated. And he realized he was hard as a rock. But the sight in front of him was so fascinating that he refrained from stroking himself and just watched. Sherlock shivered slightly, his skin was flushed and overly sensitive.
“Moriarty and one of his helpers tried to drown them in one of the reservoirs of the embankments. Thankfully it was quite obvious where they were. It was the only reservoir with open flood gates and the guy guarding it was quite the tip-off. John and Greg were already drenched quite thoroughly and will probably suffer a slight hypothermia. They tried to keep Mrs. Hudson dry on their shoulders. We got them out just in time,” Sally explained.
A butler opened the door for them. He didn’t bat an eye and just led them into the house. Mycroft must have informed him of their arrival. There wasn’t a lot for John and Sherlock to do and they went to the kitchen to raid the fridge. They opened a bottle of wine to celebrate their return to London and snacked on the kitchen counter. The butler at first tried to be helpful, but then let them be. They both felt in a state of flux.
Molly waited with the cabbie. She fiddled with her phone. After five minutes the van returned. Only one person was in the front. Molly recognized instantly who the driver was: Jim Moriarty. Her blood ran cold. In haste she ducked below the window and hid between the seats. The van drove back the way they had come. Molly was unsure. Was John still in the van? Or was it only Moriarty?
Sherlock had retreated into his mind palace. Exhaustion and pain made it a desolate place. But the good times were still there. He remembered a time, when Lestrade was taking care of him after taking drugs, baiting him with cases to keep him occupied. There was Mrs Hudson giving him a place to stay and a first feeling of belonging. And then there was John giving him companionship, friendship, praise. He dove further into his memories. He replayed the cases with John, the quite evenings with take-a-way and how John patched him up. The memories were bittersweet. He would trade his life again and again; to get that back, or at least to so see them all safe.
John regarded him for a moment, a small smile growing on his lips. “I think, I know, what this is about.”
John knew that Sherlock was thinking hard, trying to figure something out. “What are you thinking about?” John asked, disturbing his thoughts.
“No John, I need to feel you. It's not enough, please.” Sherlock chased for further kisses, trying to pull John on top of him. John planted some light kisses on Sherlock's face to soothe him.
Sherlock chuckled. His eyes roaming over John's body, trying to deduce even a miniscule hint about  his past. “Well, there is always something.”
Greg looked sceptical. "As far as I know, a sniper wants my head. Other ones seem to be on John Watson's and Mrs. Hudson’s heels. I don't know if I can be much of a help. What is going on?"
Greg’s eyes turned cold and he stiffened. He knew Anderson often said things carelessly, but those remarks and the subsequent comments of his colleagues had come back to haunt him after Sherlock had jumped. He knew they could hurt.
“It's over, we made it, it’s okay; I know how you feel...” While John whispered reassurances into Sherlock’s ear, he stroked his now again black hair and drew small circles on his back. Sherlock calmed, only sniffling slightly sometimes. John kept up talking. “You'll be okay. I wondered about you in Ostrava. I expected that all this would be too much. I'm happy, that I can be here now for you. I don’t mind you being sad, I had expected a tantrum or some wall shooting –“ John chuckled a little bit at the memories, but continued with his soft caresses.
Out of the blue, John muted the television. “Listen,” he started.  “I don’t know if I should tell you this, but I need to get rid of something. It’s not like I can hide anything from you anyway, I just want to avoid any misunderstandings.”
He lifted his arm to his face and buried his eyes into his elbow. Silent sobs escaped him, but instead of hating himself for his weakness, like he would have done some months ago, he let himself mourn something, that he never had and never would have but now craved. The first time in his life he felt, there was something more to sentiment. Sometime later he slipped into an exhausted sleep.
“That's a longer story,” John smiled relieved. They reluctantly released each other. Disbelief and awe was written on both their faces. They were both shocked and neither was willing to look somewhere else in fear of this being a dream. After some more moments of staring they erupted into giggles.
Molly's driver stopped in the parking zone for cabs 50 yards away, where she had a perfect view of the van. Moriarty exited the van and strode into the hospital like he owned the place. Through the glass doors, Molly could see that he stopped in front of the elevators. She had a sinking feeling that she knew where Moriarty was heading.
John had an inexplicable need to find Sherlock. The more he thought about the idea of him being alive, the more he craved to be at Sherlock's side. The whole story, or the game, as Sherlock used to say, wasn’t finished. And John refused to be just a bystander. He had started the whole thing with Sherlock and he wanted to finish it – even if it was the last thing he would do. John thought back on his last two months. He had felt dead. In the first week after Sherlock’s suicide he just wanted to rage at the insanity of it, but later on felt like his feet got kicked out mid-run, his body coming to a stop and tumbling down. He had no energy left and he was just going through the motions. He had lost his target, was being dragged down by gravity and waiting to crash. But now he was being pulled by a strange force toward the Czech-Polish border, and deep down in his bones he felt that it was the right direction.
“I-I'm sorry,” Sherlock sniffled after some moments. “I don't know, I just, I – I ...” Sherlock looked up miserably.
In his week of waiting John also met with Lestrade twice. He didn't tell him about Molly or his assumption that Sherlock was still alive. Just because he survived the jump, didn’t mean, that he hadn’t encountered trouble later on. If Sherlock was still alive, then he was in hiding for two months and probably still working against Moriarty. And that was definitely dangerous.  He first wanted irrefutable proof, before he declared Sherlock alive.
Sherlock loosened the embrace and looked into John's eyes. He was also uncertain if he could trust his senses. He held John by his shoulders unwilling to let go.
Molly peeked around the corner. Sherlock stood on the mortar banister of the roof. His curly black hair and the trademark coat were billowing in the wind. His hands were raised to appease Moriarty who held a gun pointed at Sherlock. Moriarty's back was towards Molly.
After some slow and sensuous kisses, John started to undress Sherlock who helped him. He felt restricted in his suit and stripped till he was naked. John still wore his bathrobe, but the fabric felt so soft, that Sherlock didn't mind. Sensuously they rubbed against each other basking in each others warmth. John softly pushed him onto the bed and Sherlock willingly let himself fall. John chucked his bathrobe to the floor and joined Sherlock.
Mycroft’s mansion was big and had many guest rooms, but if anybody noticed that Sherlock and John shared one room, nobody commented on it. Like in the safe house they fooled around, snuggled together and slept like logs.
Sherlock looked more forlorn. He just stood in the entry of the flat and took everything in. John understood that Sherlock had probably given up on ever returning to 221B Baker Street at one point. There were some minor changes in the living room. John had put away the violin, for example, because it had broken his heart to see it every day. Also, a lot of Sherlock’s ongoing experiments no longer existed. He knew that he didn’t need to explain that. Sherlock probably understood, what had happened. Therefore John didn't comment and just let Sherlock be.
John took a deep breath. Calmness settled over him. His senses focussed on the target. He took aim and pulled the trigger. A short moment later the prince’s head exploded. The door behind the prince shattered to pieces. Blood splattered onto the balcony and the windows. John kept his aim on the balcony and focussed on Anthea, who had been safe behind the other windows. She looked at the prince and then directly toward John’s direction. John knew that she couldn’t see him in the distance but she knew where they were. Anthea smiled and nodded. Then she vanished into the darkness of the room, smartphone in hand and already sending out messages.
Mycroft relaxed. “In this case: I am thankful for that.” He visibly gathered his wits, straightened his waistcoat and returned to his seat. “Gentlemen, we have much to discuss.”
He finished up, took his shopping bags and went back to his bolt hole, always taking care to stay in the shadows. The only thing left to do was writing a letter. After that, he felt beat. But now he could finally get some rest. There was nothing to do till tomorrow evening. After some perfunctory ablutions he fell into a light, but restful sleep. He could finally be helpful again. No nightmares kept him awake. He dreamt of cosy nights in Baker Street with take-away, violin music and a vivacious detective.
The whole night and the next day, John had a lot to think about. He challenged  himself to reevalute what he thought was attractive. As a soldier, he had had a stash of porn magazines like everyone else. But he had to admit, it did not completely reflect what he found attractive. He never obsessed over them like some of his army mates did. And he had never looked away, when his fellow soldiers worked out in the make-shift gym under the desert sun. If he was honest, his favourite wank fantasy was about a threesome, with another man and a woman, both taking care of him. The fantasy always left a trace of shame in him. He never ever allowed himself to think about sex with a man only. His father's words always came back to him, telling him that this wasn't natural. But hell, he was almost forty and his father had been dead for over ten years now. Shouldn't he make his own decisions on his love and sex life?
“I already tried to call him. Only the voicemail answered. I can’t read the plate, they are too far away.” Molly squinted from the back seat of the cab to the, but there were to many cars between them.
“There you are”, the man wheezed. Blood was pouring out of the neck wound. Both men were fighting for control, rolling on the ground, kicking and punching if possible. The sniper was trying to tighten his hold around John's neck. John fought for breath. John realized, that the sniper had extensive close combat training and he couldn't gain the upper hand. He tasted blood on his tongue and felt bruises, where the snipers fist had connected on his rips and stomach. John's vision started to narrow. He heard this blood rushing in his ears. He focussed on the neck wound of the sniper. Blood poured out of it at a disturbing rate. The bullet had hit an artery. John realized he had to play for time.
Sherlock looked into his eyes. He nodded. “I know.” The time in the cell, shortly after Musgrave had given the killing order came back to him full force. “And I'm glad, that we are here now. I love you John, and I am deeply thankful, that I can say that. To you, in person,”
Of course, John and Sherlock knew better. The corpse of the real Sebastian Moran had been cremated two days ago. Instead of him the next available male corpse without family ties and within an acceptable age range was set up to pose as Moran. With no previous photos or DNA samples nobody would be able to contradict his identity. John sometimes wondered, if it really was that easy to procure corpses, or if Sherlock and Mycroft just had a knack for it.
The man raised his hands and took a step back. With that move he whirled around and jumped at John. Out of reflex, John fired the gun. The bullet grazed his attacker on the neck and hit the window frame. The sniper hissed in pain, but the momentum of the jump propelled him further to John. He crashed into him and pushed John to the ground. One hand clenched and tightened around John’s throat.
“Mycroft,” John acknowledged. They hadn’t met since Sherlock’s funeral. All information so far had been conveyed via Greg. John was still pissed that Mycroft had told Moriarty details about Sherlock’s life and therefore fed the fixation on him.
John used the map to find the way back to Baker Street through back alleys. He knew of a flat at 218c Baker Street that suspiciously stayed empty for some time. Sherlock commented once on it, while he was still alive. He wanted to take a look, if it was really empty. If so, he would start his operations there. Then he could observe Baker Street and any suspicious dealings.
The Taser however was new to him. He heard about them, but never used one. The shock might be deadly to someone old or with a heart condition, but John had to admit, that it was quite convenient and a good solution if you didn’t want to kill someone. John was certain, that in case of the previous owner the 'not killing' meant 'keeping alive' for interrogation.
Their hands didn’t stay idle and wandered beneath their shirts. It wasn't enough. After a some time, both were without trousers and shirts. Sherlock was elated, that his attraction was reciprocated after all. His dreams and wishes were becoming reality. And John marveled at how alive he felt and how much Sherlock's presence soothed him. The lean body aroused him more, than any previous encounter he had had with a woman.
After being wounded and sent home he had a low self-esteem, felt tired and unattractive. He tried a more conservative approach to sex. He hadn't had the energy left to fight prejudices that came with being an invalid and bisexual. His father was homophobic to the core, and the coming out of his sister was mildly put explosive. He put pressure on John, to keep away from queers. At that time John still wanted to please his father and wanted to prove that he was ‘normal’. John overcompensated by having a string of girlfriends.  But to be honest, even then, he kissed and shagged not only girls - so much for being straight. He talked at length with his therapist about his sexuality, and in the end he accepted is sexual self: He liked sex, he didn't mind the gender of his partner and as long as all parties give consent, everything is fine. And therefore he decided to forget the conservative approach and give in into his sensual and sexual nature again.
Mycroft smiled relieved. “Very good. The pick-up is an address in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The safe house is in Berlin, Germany. Everything you need is in the back pack my assistant will provide. Oh, there is a catch however: You need to retrieve the agent till Thursday morning. My Swiss contact needs his resources freed for Operation De-Bugging. And whatever happens on Thursday, we assume Eastern Europe will feel some consequences, too. I don’t know when I will be able to pick you up at the safe house. But it may take a while. That is all.”
The car had waited for them and now drove them to Mycroft’s house. John had never visited Mycroft before. Upon seeing his mansion his step faltered in awe. Sherlock was unimpressed. Sometimes John wondered how rich the Holmes family was, and if Sherlock had access to the money or if Mycroft just earned a lot from his job. John had always struggled with money. His family never had much, and during his time in the Army he had sent most of his pay home to support Harry and his mother till she died.
He pulled a device from the shelf, turned it on and roamed the end of a stick over John. After being turned around and his back being searched the same way, Greg grunted satisfied.
“It isn’t. We don’t know who we can trust. Therefore your help would be very much appreciated. We do this step by step. We keep under the radar. I will look the other way, on what you do. But I know you will be fine on your own.”
“But like you,” Sherlock continued, “I did some unsavoury things while using and I am glad that I don't have to endure any lasting effects of my endeavours. Since I quit drugs, sex is no longer that appealing. Sometimes I go out for an occasional grope and a blow job at a club, but my brain is very selective, what's attractive. Someone being dull is the worst mood killer that can happen to me. But I am neither celibate nor asexual. I just don't engage often.”
John took another deep breath. “Well, if we are having this discussion, I need another glass of wine.” He picked up the bottle of wine, poured a generous amount and settled back on his previous place. After a few moments his eyes fixed again on Sherlock.
“John, wait. I apologise.” Sherlock said. “I didn't want to put you on the spot. I just was curious. You always seemed so proper. You were denying instantly, when someone implicated, you are gay.”
They reached Crawford Street. John could make out the still familiar form of Matt in front of the Three Kings Pub. He waved a short hello and indicated that he should come along. After a few more steps, he ushered everyone into a small alley.
“Let me bring you up to speed,” Mycroft resumed and offered them the chairs in front of his desk. As soon as everybody had been seated comfortably, Mycroft started to explain about the current investigations and the arrests. His Swiss contact had, as promised to Sherlock, relayed the complete list of Moriarty’s associates and moles to Mycroft. As usual in his business, he withheld his source. With that information, Mycroft and his allies were able to act. Anthea, for example, was currently taking care of the moles in Mycroft’s organisation. Lestrade had handled the police officers and judges in the UK.
“You were quite the opponent,” she heard Moriarty's voice. “Even more entertaining than I first thought. But now you fell for a faked message from Lestrade. I thought you were cleverer.”
Sherlock and John had no business left either. They congratulated Greg on his promotion, assured him, that he earned it and said their goodbyes. On the way to the elevator John spoke up.
During his time away from Baker Street dismantling Moriarty’s network and after coming back he had to deal with being alone, John’s feeling of betrayal for abandoning and lying to him, John’s marriage and his removal from Baker street, Mary’s past, John’s feelings of betrayal after Mary’s past backfired on them and a lot of repressed and mostly toxic emotions.
“Sounds good. Get me something spicy.” John smiled and vanished in the bathroom. Sherlock just stood in the living room, listening to the sounds of John shaving. The low hums of an unknown pop song were carried to him. It was so domestic, that Sherlock needed some time to get his bearings. He felt unhinged and out of place.
This however wouldn’t be enough. Molly needed support now. She scrolled through her contacts. Beside Greg, she only had worked with Sally Donovan. Perhaps she was able to help her. She pressed the dial button.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock murmured confused. John never was so dispassionate about his partners, bordering on rude.
On his walk through various back alleys he mulled over the fact, that Molly was in a high risk position and had no mode of self-defence. She had been an important factor in Sherlock’s plan but had no protection, if his deceit became known. He needed to find a solution for that.
“A flooding chamber of the Thames Embankments,” Greg said, interrupting his survey. “I once had some counter terrorism training in here, but I don’t know –,” the opening of the hatch above them interrupted him.
Sherlock was intrigued. He obviously misjudged a big part of John's past. But if John's tale was true, then he had been in deep denial about some facets of his life and only recently resolved those. He never shown such liberal views before and they never had talked this open about sex.
Molly paid the cabbie, exited the car and turned toward the entrance door of 221B Baker Street. The moment she stepped on the pavement, she saw the familiar figure of John hurrying around a corner into a back alley. She wanted to run after him, when a tall, bulky man jumped out of a black van and followed John into the alley.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “August 1989. Switzerland. Do you remember when Mummy made you take me with you to Lake Constance?”
“None of your business, Irene,” Sherlock clipped and threw a nervous glance at John. They took a seat at the table. “Let's talk business,”  Sherlock said.
He was near a tube station on Jubilee line. He had to switch lanes on Baker Street anyway to get to St. Pancras, so he stepped out there and looked for a familiar face. Sherlock sometimes had pointed out his contacts of his homeless network. He desperately hoped that they would help him now. He was lucky. There was a woman he recognised not far away from the station entry. He scribbled a short note, pinned it and a 50 pound note to the parcel and gave it to the woman.
“Hi Sally. John just got kidnapped,” Molly explained without preamble. “He was thrown in a van and I am currently following him in a cab. What should I do?”
He pulled his cap deep into his face, and raised the hoodie over his head too. Furthermore he buried his face into the jacket. Nobody could see his face by accident. He followed Mrs Hudson into the church. She trailed a little bit behind her friends, checking her handbag for her glasses. John saw his chance. He sped up and bumped into her. He shoved the letter into her handbag.
John passed some of the time with reading newspapers and browsing the web on his new phone. There was nothing of interest. Just the usual gossip about stars and royals – especially the Arab prince and his adventures were a current favourite of the yellow press. But there was nothing about increased crime rates. Even Greg Lestrade was puzzled, that the press didn’t report about the more than usual criminal activities.
“The last station for you: Happy dying, join your friends. And just that you know: you are not even worth one of my bullets, you freak,” the tall man whispered into his ear. Sherlock was dropped to the ground and a boot kicked firmly into his stomach. Sherlock wretched some blood and vomit onto the ground. There wasn’t much, because his stomach was empty. He didn't care anymore. It wasn't important. He just collapsed to the ground, trying to get lost in the images in his head. It was peaceful and warm there. The door to his cell was shut and bolted.
John realized that the emotional part of the family reunion was over. He held up the umbrella, which he had carried since Berlin and put it on the desk. “Here Mycroft. Next time, give it to me, when it’s actually raining.”
On a Monday evening he wanted to join Greg at NSY again. He was on his way to the entrance on to the underground parking. The door there became the main mode for Greg and his supporters for  entering and leaving the Yard. It had just started raining and John pulled up his hoodie to protect himself from the drizzle. The moment he reached the door a familiar black car pulled up from the alley behind him. Without missing a step, he changed course towards it. The car door opened and he slipped in.
Sally informed him, that Greg and John were still in the examination room. They had to wait for news, because only family was allowed. Molly did her best to get some information and tried to keep Sherlock from threatening the nurse at the reception desk. Sally and Mrs. Hudson started to discuss the recent events and tried to keep him distracted. Telling him not to worry only made him more hostile.
Mycroft laughed. “This is an individual item. I would only lend it someone when I am sure to get it back. And I don’t think it fits your current style, Dr Watson.”
John startled awake again when his mobile chimed. He had gotten it back this morning. Greg had it debugged and wiped it of potential spy software. Two hours had gone by. Sherlock hadn’t returned yet. But his sessions at the hairdresser always took some time – especially now, if Sherlock wanted his hair dyed back to black.
In the meantime, afternoon had turned into evening. Sally said her goodbyes first and went back to the office. The Moriarty business had created a lot of paperwork. Mycroft packed everyone else into his car. The first stop was at Baker Street. Mrs Hudson, Sherlock and John were glad to be home again. Molly’s apartment was the next stop. She was looking forward to a nice and relaxed evening. She conveniently forgot the taser in Mycroft’s car. Greg just took up Mycroft’s offer again and tagged along to his guest room in Mycroft's mansion.
“Bart’s hospital, the roof. Please send someone,” Molly said to the operator and cut the connection.
He let his head drop to his knees and buried his eyes into the crook of his elbows. Sobs escaped him.
Greg saved the recording to his private folder on the server. He had not a lot of Sherlock to remember him by. Greg used to think of himself as Sherlock's friend, but he had to admit, that if he applied this label, he wasn't a good one. Morosely he thought that he was no friend at all because he couldn't stop him from committing suicide.
First, Mrs Hudson looked confused, but John put a steadying hand on her upper arm. She got a short glimpse at his face. John shook his head slightly to indicate, she should keep silent. Then he moved on to some seats on the left.
