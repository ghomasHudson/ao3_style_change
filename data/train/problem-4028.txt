closed up our last ball.”
“Dean?”
“Oh?”
“I assumed you’d wanted to be followed, as that,” he points to his bracelet, “was still on your wrist. Mick is fine as well, though I’m sure he’s quite upset at the group he chose to be with.”
It was a truth universally acknowledged that any Dreadful, upon finding a nest suitable to their needs, would go to ground. It’s known by many, yet despite this, just as many cling to their old-fashioned social etiquettes, never leaving them even when it results in their homes becoming nests.
“I’ve heard,” Millie searches for any other subject to get onto and away from this one, “I saw you all in the village a few times when I went there. You all seem very much like you all know your strengths and weaknesses, though...the youngest, Samandiriel, seems...a bit quieter?”
“You are always my friend and work-partner. You and Uriel are righteousness and anger in your own ways. If you must leave, though, please don’t be upset at me for the choice, and do not blame Dean Winchester for this.”
“A rune for transformation and protection, I was told,” Millie sees no reason to lie about it. They either knew it or didn’t. “It didn’t like the wards Balthazar put up, originally, but we’ve come with a work around.”
Dean frowns, looking at him curiously before saying, “Ok. Well, I don’t deliver up here that often, but if you need anything, the Annex sometimes has some stuff, and so does the main post office in town.”
suddenly being his sullen, unhappy,
“What’s so interesting about the truth?” she takes his offered arm as they walk out, pausing as they see someone riding up, the dark black, armor-clad horse huffing at them as it comes to a stop. Atop it, Dean Smith sits, offering a small smile to them and tipping his hat to both of them. “Miss Masters. Castiel. I was hoping to ask for a favor from you on behalf of Fielkett.”
Bobby’s name isn’t on the list, which gets Dean to let out a relieved breath. He touches the bracelet, considering what to do next, before making up his mind. He might hate it, but having that backup is better than nothing, and despite it all, Cas has been a good person to him. Even if he knew he was lying, or suspected it, he had allowed Dean so much. The thought of leaving now is almost too hard, but he also knows this could mean he’ll give up on Sam.
“Hey,” he says, his fingerprints bringing up his name. “I need an Evaluation and Placement.”
“Is your sister doing well, then?”
He frowns slightly at the question, coming a minute into the dance. “I am used to dancing, but not so used to talking while dancing.”
Hopefully it won’t be Balthazar this time.
Going to confront Bobby right now would put a lot of strain on his image, though…unless he did it in a neutral place. The problem was, Bobby wouldn’t go to a place like Benny’s cousin’s restaurant. If Bobby did know anything about it, why was he hiding it from Dean?
“No shit,” Dean mutters as they reach their destination, “talk later then.”
“Where is Uriel?” His worry overrules the need to see Smith’s sloppy bow.
“Ah, Dean, you cut me to the quick!” Bela smirks a bit with Dean’s own smile.
“Are you alright?” Cas asks, Millie nodding as Naomi huffs in a way that gets Millie to glance at her, worried. The Angel glares at them as Cas says, “Naomi?”
Castiel cast Balthazar a glare as he considers, looking over at Uriel as he remains silent. It’s not until they get a chance to head outside and wander through their small garden path.
Sam glances around at that mention, the others looking about worriedly as Dean waits. Sam and the others in his group - well, any of those in the Campbell group - would go after the Dreadfuls if necessary. However, many did not enjoy or even take pride in taking back the estates or anything else they might clear out, often willing them to the Men of Letters to use for bases in the country, or, more often, leaving them to ruin when a garrison was close. The Men of Letters liked their control, and garrisons caused that control to slip.
There’s little on the Queue for his liking, so Dean checks on what errands he must run to keep up his appearance, heading out and down a bit before his burner phone chimes briefly in his pocket. He works on the bracelet a bit, making it only pick up the ambient noises so it appears like he’s not speaking to someone, before answering. “Yeah?”
The information obviously worries the other man, but he nods after a moment. “Ok. I’ll tell him that, and we’ll call if we need it. If you work to keep them in the Centre, we’ll keep Dean safe here. Same with Jody and Donna.”
That he’d done so well was a positive sign, at least, though perhaps everything was also starting to really come to light. The fact that he had the ability to be a Seraph was perhaps the scariest part - Dean having been from the Outlands and obviously didn’t understand how the Echelon worked, though that’s a bit not surprising. What he learns of the Hunters and the ones who lived in the Walls they were able to catch and start to integrate in some ways, they all believed something very different from the truth.
The mention of the Second Tier is bad enough, but
“To humor me. Go on.”
At work, Castiel tried to but failed not to daydream about the green-eyed omega he had seen at the café. This was probably just a fascination, natural instinct, to be attracted to and admire something beautiful like a sculpture from ancient Greece. He remembered how aesthetically pleasing the cashier's face was and his mind drifted off to wonder how his body would be like underneath the layers of clothes. Would his frame look delicate, just like his face? Or would he have toned muscles, matching his tall physique? The images forming inside his head were making it difficult not to get aroused and since having a hard-on in a workplace was less than ideal, he silently willed his forming erection to subside.
“I know.”
SAM: (voice breaking) Yeah, me too.
“You are a sorry excuse for an alpha, Aaron!”
“Wow, thank you. I feel so flattered,” Charlie placed her hand over her chest in an overly dramatic way. “But seriously, Dean, you talk about Cas like, I don’t know, like you’re his boyfriend.”
“Man, woman, whatever. They both worked the same way. And I’ve proven it.”
Just to get his pent-up frustration completely out of his system, he took a longer course this time. Yet another unusual thing happening in his routine, Castiel noticed, although he was unsure of what to make of it. The sky was getting darker and darker when he decided to head back home. He couldn’t wait until he took a nice warm shower, got comfortable, and possibly read a book before going to bed.
“Is everything ok, Dean?”
Rewritten by: nameless_novelist
“Dean, is there something wrong?”
A laugh came from someone off the screen and Sam turned the camera around to show his girlfriend, Eileen.
"Sorry, man. I guess I kinda go geek sometimes."
DEAN: Yeah it is, 'cause the last I heard you... you were in Heaven's lockup.
Disbelief was clearly written across his face but Cas agreed with Dean dryly, “Right.”
Dean must have been drunk as well because Dean whipped his head around, with a mischievous glint in his eyes, and dared him to kiss him.
Castiel's feeble attempt to lighten the mood had apparently worked, as Gabriel's voice perked up.
(The scene blends into Sam smiling at Eileen)
“No but. I picked the movie and that means it’s on me if I didn’t like it. Did you find it ok?”
“Dean, this isn’t some stupid dare that you can laugh about afterward!”
“Freak out? I'm not freaking out! I'm just, I’m just, you know, surprised.”
DEAN: No, Cas, this time I’m doing the talking. And the truth is... I love you too.
“Hello, Hannah. No, I’m not actually here to order something. I’m looking for someone who works here.”
Dean couldn’t believe that he’s going to have this talk again, with his baby brother nonetheless. So he let out a huge sigh, before beginning to explain what had happened over the past week. Sam was very attentive, nodding every now and then, and Dean realized afterward that he had spilled out everything.
“Okay then, well, he’s not skinny but still rather lanky? And oh, he has firm thighs. From all the running.”
(Sam sitting down and Dean walks toward him, carrying pies)
“Every word.”
“Howdy!”
“Besides, cowboys are more or less people from the past. I see people every day who ride horses with equal skill and talent here on this ranch.”
It led him toward the omega but he wasn't alone. A growl built up his throat but Castiel forced it down since he had no right to do that. He was not his alpha, they weren’t mates. He watched him making out with some alpha, wondering why he couldn’t tear his eyes off and walk away. Suddenly the alpha removed himself from the omega and took off.
“So the last lord of Fielkett told us, and he didn’t exactly prosper either,” Castiel points out, noting the others looking worried, only Michal Davies appearing ready for more fight as Dean Smith looks over at him. They had done a bang-up job at taking out the Dreadfuls, but also didn’t seem interested in help. Castiel isn’t too surprised by a hunter group who’d take an estate after clearing it. He hears Uriel come out near him, sees Davies move a bit closer before Smith tells them, “Easy, Mick. We’re not beetle-headed here. Castiel, whatever the last Lord did or didn’t do, that ain’t us. Your wings ain’t out, so I doubt you’re bird-witted enough to try it, either of you.”
Naomi starts to argue, but Samandiriel is already ready to head out, and Cas gives him a glare while Uriel leads Millie out to the open-air carriage. They quickly drive off, Uriel silent for most of it, only stopping when they get near enough the Dreadfuls start to show themselves as a danger to both of them. Millie takes aim at one with a rifle, hitting it and getting the group to shift and moan, while Uriel hands them the reins and saying, “If you can be quick, take out a few more.”
that would hurt. He didn’t even want to think of how quickly he’d give in if it was any of them. If he’s not careful, though, Allen or someone else might come after him. He
“I’m askin’ ‘cause I’m the one who, being up here or not, is putting their life on the line for it! I told them to run, and they got caught. I set off the alarm, and I got a list of more than
After all, it had been Father and Mother’s love that had saved London on Hingham Bridge. The attack on Sam had given Mary Campbell-Winchester scars that would not allow her to fight as well as before. Father had trained Millie to know her place in the house, to be ready to fight and die for her brother, the heir to the Winchester fortune and presumptive leader of the alliance. Dean had met with a few men that Father had deemed worthy of their attention, and Dean had taken a shine to one of them - Gordon Walker was a good gentleman who knew his stuff and could easily become a fine Hunter. The work to defeat Azazel and Lilith had been long but rewarding, and it wasn’t until Dean admitted what happened - all of it - to Gordon that he showed his true self.
idea.
He shouldn’t be surprised that Dean contacted them so soon, but he’s more surprised that there’s another ‘mission’ for him. “Did they say why you need to help him again?”
Choir.”
Castiel sits near Dean, shifting to try to get himself put together, then glances over at him with a look of seriousness that Dean has come to recognize on the other man’s face. “We need to talk.”
Uriel is silent at that, and Millie wants to leave the conversation there, but hears him mutter, “Yes. It’s better if you leave us alone.”
Dean is silently grateful that he knows these areas so well. Slipping into the maintenance shaft and sliding down quickly, he’s also grateful that the Seraphs took so long to get information out of Walt and Roy.
“Those do not require what I am able to do, and fighting a Dreadful is not the same as dealing with society and unpleasant company.” They finish the dance, Millie looking a bit upset as she dips with a simple curtesy.
Dean glances at Uriel, while Castiel waits, curious himself. “Bela gave me some of a rundown, but not a lot of it with how quickly things were going. I’m grateful to you all for helping her.” Dean offers them both a smile, and having seen his sister now, Castiel is beginning to see how similar the two can look. He’d not thought they were twins, but then again, seeing Dean now, after spending so much time seeing Miss Smith around, it’s very evident.
Waiting on news from Benny means that they have time to plan, hire new people, and start to put more of the finishing touches on Fielkett itself. Millie just feels like a lot of it is that so many are trying to show off their best side to Millie, and also trying to figure out her place in everything.
“The motor thing was them pulling out some stunt, and you’re either playing along or getting played.”
“He is also old enough to be hurt, and I’d like for that to not happen yet,” Uriel mutters, despite the quiet argument, and cracks his eyes open a bit. “I’m tired, but not dead yet, Castiel.”
“Uriel probably wishes to speak to Mr. Davies about the spirit,” Meg smirks a bit at that as Castiel gives her a look of annoyance.
Their father had said for an Angel to unfurl their wings, one should never look at them, lest they be blinded.  Their mother had claimed the Angel wings were actually a type of magic that anyone could use, but to hold such power was a sin.
Dean hums before saying, “Well, if they do, the hives’ll be useful, and you’ll be able to get in some good honey. That’s always a good thing.” He smiles a bit as Castiel looks at him, “Plus you’ll be able to apologize to everyone with honey.”
, their father’s voice echoes in their head, but their hand still shakes somewhat as they grip the reins. “But I am leaving soon either way. Castiel needn’t worry about me.”
Castiel glances at the other man before asking stiffly, “The spirit?”
“That could be their ultimate goal, with Gabriel gone, Lucifer exiled, and Michael and Raphael focused on ensuring our safety from some of the others and fixing up the Walls.” Castiel lets out a long breath as he considers what will happen next. “We will need to act as if the information they graciously ‘gave’ us was what we needed, but we will also have to take out their base as well. We will have to go into the Walls.”
“I don’t have anything much to say,” Castiel started off slowly, “But I am dating Dean now.”
“Never,” Dean replied immediately, diminishing Castiel’s growing uncertainty. "If you want, I could start calling you Darling or something. Would you like that, Darling?”
"My name's Castiel."
“You’re just generalizing chick flicks. And no, I‘ve never thought about him that way. He’s like my best friend.”
“Oh no, you read right through me, didn’t you?”
“Alright, then.”
DEAN: I mean, we had one hell of a ride, didn’t we? Always one after the other. Saving people and hunting things in between. But we made it. And I’m damn proud of us, Sammy, I really am.
(Sam gets in the impala)
Cas smiled slightly upon sensing Dean’s back to his normal self now. “If I did, I would have told you, Dean. See you tomorrow.”
SAM: I’m not Sad Sam. I’m just, (sighs) I’m also thinking about Cas, you know? And Jack. I miss them.
“Damn straight.”
“...wait, the sun is rising now! Do you see this, Cas? I mean you wouldn’t obviously, but still.”
“So you want to date me, huh? Be my boyfriend and all that? Does that mean you wanna hold my hand or something?”
“So I bring you a pie every day for a week and you, in turn, would be my date for a week. Do we have an agreement?” Cas looked at Dean with such hopefulness that he couldn’t say no. Damn Cas for being able to make a puppy face, which was like kryptonite to him.
He hesitated before reaching toward the camera to turn it off.
Sam made a bitch face as he retorted, “Of course not, I sent him away after I reassured him that it was nothing too serious.”
Dean’s lips twitched with amusement, as he stole a quick glance toward the camera.
Unfortunately, the silence was dragging on between them and it seemed that Gabriel noticed something was off with him.
Another few months had flown, and it was already the end of their freshman year. Dean and Castiel were sitting on a couch together, as Dean mused, "Can you believe our first year of college is actually over?"
“You think too much.”
DEAN: (sighs) Hey, Baby.
Standing in a proximate distance, Castiel noticed an undertone of leather and whiskey in the omega’s scent, which seemed so... off for some reason he couldn't quite place. Those smells didn’t mingle well with more prominent ones from him, like cedarwood and apple pie. However, the thoughts faded away as he felt the green-eyed man grinding against him, causing satisfying friction for both of them.
“It sounds perfect.”
The woman walked out of the kitchen and stared at Dean in amusement.
Written by: Andrew Dabb
“No, I-“
People say taking small steps at a time helps you to deal with the pain. So he did. He checked off Dean’s list, one by one. He had listened to top 13 of Dean’s favorite Led Zeppelin songs, he ate fried pickled and gumbo by Benny’s, he met up with Charlie in the library amongst all the other things.
SAM: (red around the eyes and trembling lips) Dean, don’t leave me. Don’t leave me.
Dean was clearly in a good mood, probably because he always had a thing for cowboys. So he began to hum again and the camera recorded it for a while until it suddenly turned off.
“Sammy, are you badmouthing me?”
“Oh, okay. So you’re one of those classic guys.” Even without looking up at Cas, Dean could almost hear his eyeballs rolling again. “Er, but Cas, don’t you think it's better if we just stay as friends?”
“What’s this?”
“Yeah, remember when a waitress was flirting with him like a week ago? You said, quote, unquote, ‘My shy but devastatingly handsome friend here‘.”
Gabriel's question was unexpected, and Castiel couldn't help but frown.
“Alright. Then have a nice day, Castiel.”
(Sam playing catch-ball with his son)
"To ride it out of your system, obviously. And me? I am not gonna pass the chance to finally kiss those sexy lips of yours."
“Hey, my name is Dean Winchester. I’m an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach, and frisky women. Or at least I used to before I met this gorgeous boyfriend with an angelic smile and baby blue eyes but –wait for it– also simply a
“Maybe it’s because I had one for dinner,” Michael wiggled his eyebrows playfully.
(Nothing happens, and Sam’s face falls)
Dean had changed the lyric so that he sang ‘kind man’ when it should be ‘kind woman’. Despite his off-key singing, the crowd didn’t seem to mind since they either have never heard of the original song or sang along with Dean because they do know the song.
Just four more days until he could see the omega. He silently prayed that their encounter wouldn’t end badly.
Eileen smiled next to Sam, with amusement twinkling in her eyes.
This was one of many characteristics he liked about Dean. He was considerate and always tried to be in another person's shoes before speaking.
Even after Castiel found the perfect ring, it took him a while to gather the courage to drive to the cemetery where Dean was buried. He dug a small patch on the left side of Dean’s grave so that he could bury one of the rings with him. After he covered the patch back with the dirt, he stood up and ran his fingers across the inscribed epitaph on Dean’s plaque. It was a twist on his infamous catchphrase: I still think I’m adorable.
His voice became softer, probably noticing Cas' weariness.
(A sound of angel wings fluttering)
“Since I was happy as long as you were. That’s why I would have never confessed to you, except you seemed so unhappy with all your past dates and I wanted you to see how easily we already fit into our lives, how nothing would have to change and... that maybe I am the one who understands you the most.“
SAM: I love you.
“So what? I’m not gonna wear anything that doesn’t reach my knees.”
“Just so you know, I mean it, Cas. Wherever you are, I still love you.”
EXT. FIELD, Sam is standing with Miracle behind a funeral pyre
(Dean is also looking at Castiel)
“Yes. Would that be a problem?”
“No. Unlike you, I am not obliged to eat a salad.”
Dean placed the camera on one of the empty shelves and let the camera continue to film him and Charlie, as they read stories for children using their theatrical voices.
SAM: It’s been a while since Cas was taken by the Empty and you haven't brought him up once.
Dean was lost in his thought until Cas suddenly closed his book, before sighing, “Dean, is there something on my face?”
However, Michael was staring with such intensity, his scent of arousal so strong that it filled the room, and Castiel couldn’t hold it back anymore. He aligned his dick toward the ass, and the tip of his cock brushing against the hole, causing the omega to moan. He pushed it all at once since he knew that was for the better. When he bottomed out, they both groaned at the feeling.
As he ripped the packet open and rolled it on, a pair of green eyes were fixated on him –technically at his dick – but nonetheless on him. Feeling bold enough he squared his posture and took on a more dominating role. He grabbed the omega's waist, ready to flip him over, but he decided that he should probably ask first.
“I mean, you are my best friend, and if I suddenly date you-“
Seeing Dean Winchester in Philosophy was quickly becoming his favorite thing to do.
“No, I didn’t. You’re just making stuff up,” Dean snorted.
DEAN: (contemplates and then smiles) Oh, yeah. Definitely. So you coming with me or what?
"What if I don't want to?"
Dean sighed frustratedly before peeking his eyes open but Charlie was looking at him like she had all the time in the world and judging by her determined expression, she wasn’t going to let him bail from this.
“In their natural habitat, not in an apartment.”
Words were stuck in his throat, and he couldn't express to Dean how grateful he felt then. He was annoyed that his voice wasn't working, but a moment later, he realized it was a blessing in disguise. When he looked up to meet Dean's sincere gaze, Castiel was aware of how he hadn't just fallen in love but, as Gabriel had always insisted, was already in love.
“D-Michael.”
They hid inside a closet, but things escalated quickly. Although Castiel tried to stay still, Dean suddenly stopped laughing, his breath became ragged and – was, was he smelling him? Castiel was, on the other hand, trying his best not to focus on the warmth radiating off of Dean and the unique scent of Dean beneath the layer of the tang of whiskey and shampoo fragrance.
It was already lunchtime and as much as Dean couldn’t wait to indulge himself with the pies, he was dreading it, which was something new. Ask anyone, they would all say that Dean loves eating as much as he likes sex. And he likes sex a lot.
He wasn't going to watch his cousin having sex - not only was it disturbing to pry into a sex life of your close kin but also his mind was going to a gutter, fantasizing about Dean. The fact that he was conveniently right in front of him didn't help him at all.
"The thing is I'd like to think that there is something else than fate. A free will. Like you and me, for example. I'd prefer that you are friend with me because I am awesome and fuckin' adorable, not because fate told you to do so."
Perhaps it was the pie or perhaps it was just the habit but when Dean held the handle and drove off to school, they were already having a small talk about their classes today and fell into a comfortable silence afterward, as music blared between them.
Hearing Cas’ breathless voice made Dean feel a little bit more confident.
“The diner.”
“No, I’m going back home soon.”
When he finally came back home, his father seemed to be purposefully disregarding his change in behavior. Although Castiel wasn't reprimanded like he thought he would be, the only thing his father did was to draw the bottom line as to what Castiel was to do: Find a college. Find a job. Find a wife. He could do that. Those weren't much of a hassle to do anyways. He might have even laughed if he hadn't seen his father's face. It was a face you make when you are looking at an employee you'd very much fire on their next slip-up. Definitely not a face you make when you are looking at your only child.
“My name’s Dean and this song goes to my boyfriend.”
“It’s just... I can’t believe we are actually going out.”
SAM: (stifled sobs)
A normal person would have jumped at the sudden voice calling them, but Castiel was rather great at being resilient. He only glanced up to the person in front of him to confirm that the person is indeed Dean Winchester and hastily tore his eyes off of him.
Garth glanced at Dean and continued on, choosing his next words carefully.
“I apologize for being so pushy. I am borderline paranoid about data protection, you know? I used to be a white hat hacker.”
DEAN: Come on, I know that face. That’s uh, that’s Sad Sam face.
“...Shut up and just order me a damn salad, Samantha. Wait, do you think they offer extra meat topping?”
Before he applied for residence halls, Gabriel had called him again to check up on him.
Cas. Castiel always thought that it was disdainful to shorten the name of others just for the sake of their laziness to invest time in actually memorizing them. That's why Castiel would not allow people to call him by a nickname, although he hadn't had a chance to say so since he never had one to begin with. So he should be telling Dean that he did not appreciate the nickname, but honestly, he felt his heart flutter the way his shortened name slip out from Dean. He found it quite endearing and he simply changed his mind on nicknames.
“Well, I would if Cas didn’t force me to eat a fuckin’ salad, bitch.”
There were bookshelves all around the place – which was no surprise since Dean was inside a library. The library wasn’t big but it was by no means small and children were wandering about with books in their hands.
(Dean frowns – he looks almost angry)
He wasn’t satisfied with any pair of rings – it had to be perfect enough for Dean. Dean would prefer something simple, always a man of practicality, but Castiel wanted the design to be one-of-a-kind and beautiful, just like Dean. It took a handful of trips to different jewelry stores until he found the right one.
Castiel was being sincere but Dean looked at him like he couldn’t quite believe what he was saying before scoffing, “Jeez, Cas, no need to get all sappy on me. I mean, are you a virgin or what?” Suddenly his eyes widened in dismay as he stared at him. “Wait, are you? Please tell me this isn’t your first time.”
“You, you like me? Do you mean-”
During the summer vacation, Dean had most of the time been on his mind, but Castiel was careful not to let himself think too much about him. He knew for certain that Dean wouldn't feel the same way. Although that meant his love would be unrequited, he could still remain as Dean's closest friend. That was, only if Castiel could continue to keep a straight face in front of Dean.
Sitting on the edge of his bed, Castiel carefully lifted up the business card that Charlie gave him toward the ceiling. He took one last long look at it before he stood up to put the card above the shelf, where it would stay until he mustered enough courage to pay Charlie a visit. That meant a very long time since he didn’t even have the audacity to confess his feeling to Dean for a year. Castiel knew he was being a coward, but it was better than getting hurt.
Castiel barely managed to close the motel door before the omega pressed his body against him and kissed him fervently. Somehow their teeth didn’t crash and the taller man licked Castiel’s lip, seeking silent permission. He willingly parted his lips and groaned at the intrusion, when the omega didn’t hesitate to delve into his mouth and map out the depth of the mouth with his skillful tongue.
Charlie stormed off, fuming, and Dean immediately felt bad about being a dick toward her. The truth was, he was just as lost as everyone else. It wasn’t exactly like he had time to think it through before saying “I’m in”. Dean didn’t regret his decision, though, since he knew if he could go back in time, he would make the same choice all over again.
“You really are sticking with the classics, aren’t you?” Dean chuckled.
Dean lifted the camera up but it showed nothing else than a vast, dark sky overhead. He lowered the camera with a sheepish grin on his face.
DAY 2
DEAN: There’s something in my-my back. (sharp intake of breath) It feels like it’s right through me.
“Then you got nothing to worry about because he’s not going anywhere. He likes you way too much.”
Cas offered him a warm smile as he stood up and grabbed his bag. “No, I’ll be going home today. Have a nice evening, Sam.”
(Dean closes the door and caresses the driving wheel)
Castiel was feeling very much relieved, as he shrugged at Dean's comment. He decided to offer a tentative smile.
“What?” Somehow Dean managed to sound nonchalant enough, which he was more than pleased about.
“Mm.” Castiel acknowledged that Sam had spoken, then concentrated on drinking the water. His nap had left him feeling crusty and unrefreshed.
Castiel started shaking his head and saying “I’d rather you no-” But Alistar grabbed his arm again and he cried out in pain and nodded his head hurriedly. Dean kind of wanted to tell Alistar to quit hurting him. He shook the feeling off.
He could hear Alistair laughing in a horrible, pained way. His vision was going too grey to see, but he could hear Alistair coming up in front of him, and he could just envision his blurry outline crouched in his line of view.
When he had brushed his teeth, he laid down in bed and thought. He thought long and hard about his day, which hadn’t been particularly stressful, aside from the episode with his mother. 3 days until he got his cast off, four until his father came home.
He climbed into bed, and not really feeling like reading, he bookmarked his book and pulled out his journal. He grabbed his pen and riffled through the pages until he found the right one. He began writing.
As he walked he tried to keep to the wall of lockers, but even though his head was down and he was trying to look no more conspicuous than an ant, people still pointed and laughed at his neck openly, a few that weren't quite as ruthless simply looked at him with pity. A few boys wearing neon nike shirts threw some garbage at him and called him names. Cheeks burning, Castiel hurried to his first class.
"“Hey,” he kneels down, looking over at the mass of fur and calm that the dog radiates. “What’d’ya know. It’s a bit of a miracle you’re out here, buddy.”"
“He’s an Angel, not a flower.”
“What?”
Meg waits until Dean is far enough off before telling Castiel, “That was a bit rude of you, wasn’t it?”
, I know that, so tell me what the hell is going on?”
“I don’t want to--”
Dean sighs, remembering what he saw of Castiel’s talk with Sonny, and what Sonny told him afterward. “Maybe. But…” the memory of the room and coffee being made, Castiel watching the nesting birds, sticks in his head. “I kinda want to try for it. Even if I don’t get it.” "
He remains with Uriel for as long as he can, writing up a quick report before sending it off in a simple spell. He changes and rests for the night, coming down the next day to find Naomi speaking to Miss Talbot, carrying a bag with a change of clothing.
“I had a lot of work to do. Sorry for that.” He turns to look at the man and wink. “Besides, I thought you liked it when I made you wait.” At the glare he got, Dean chuckles a bit while walking over to him, “Not for nothing, but last time someone besides you looked at me like that, I got laid.”
Yet somehow, one of Dean Smith’s men had gotten a smile out of him.
“Nothing that you’d need to worry about for the moment,” Castiel tells him, offering a warm smile before reaching out to touch his hand. “Rest up, Uriel. I’d rather you are better instead of worrying about me.”
Castiel’s grateful for Dean being behind a screen and smiles a bit as he finishes making himself look proper once more. “Besides the motor?”
Bela Talbot spoke up from where she sat. “We found traces of it this morning, and are working to finish it off. The local areas are well protected, at least, and it showed signs of being a bit...rash...in its attacks. Mister Davies is on its trail right now, along with a few others from nearby.”
The general atmosphere is less tense than he’d expect, but he can see Uriel giving Dean a look that says he has an idea of what happened. Castiel’s glare at him gets him to focus through the remainder of the meeting before the various screens were closed, Dean relaxing quite a bit more when it was just those two. He seems grateful that no one knew what happened between them, let alone the fact that he was Quicksilver.
Castiel abruptly recalls that Dean Winchester hadn’t picked up, let alone
“As I said, the trail leads here. Your room is under a name that is not yours, did you know that?”
He doesn’t get what the guy believes he can do, but he agrees to join, because it’s the start of his month, and because the guy promises his friends won’t be there. Dean trusts the guy, though he’s not sure why he does, Dean hopes that trust isn’t misplaced. He doesn’t think it will be, and the lack of any cars at the building at least signaling that his request they are alone was met. Dean lets out a breath and opens the door, seeing the dark-haired guy coming over to open up the gate as Dean looks around. “Your friends around?”
Dean shakes their head at the information. Samuel would’ve had their hide or tossed them out if he knew they messed up
Meg shakes her head, saying, “Yes, well, he’s also abrasive. I doubt Mr. Davies would believe that he enjoys the man’s company.”
Castiel sighs, shaking his head and finally says, “I’m sure none of us are so bird-witted. Though I would think you’d show the garrison here some respect.” He sees Smith look at him, waiting, before his eyes dart down to Castiel’s blade, then back up to his eyes.
“You are right. I do apologize for my tone, and for how it must have sounded. However,” he pauses to look at Dean, noticing how close he...she?...is to Castiel, and how much of them seems far more pained by the words, and that simply translates to anger, “I do wish to know...why you would call yourself something you are not.” Dean blinks, surprise the only emotion on their face now, as Castiel continues, “You said you were the most dishonored, ruined...why say such a thing about one who, upon their arrival here, managed to do what the rest of your family failed to do? Why say that when you being here brightened us, and created a new garden for which we could admire? Forgive me for asking...but why do you believe you don’t deserve to be saved?”
Allen moves from where he’s standing, allowing Dean access to the privacy cover. Dean pauses, glancing at Allen. “Why are you here, really?”
Castiel looks over at Dean, confused, then shakes his head. Dean doesn’t seem too upset as the group goes back to the game, though one of them seems to glare at him. Castiel ignores it, and finds a book he hadn’t read before moving to look for another, so he wouldn’t have to look for anything else.
“Lady Bevell sent a letter,” Dean announces as they arrive at the breakfast table, picking the dark coffee to drink before they sit with the others, everyone looking to them. “Apparently the Ganems were part of the Men of Letters initiates.”
” Balthazar seems a bit serious for once. “
“This is a good area of chickens too,” Dean’s musings catch up to Castiel.
He remains quiet as he looks around, frowning when he spots a familiar form before he moves over to where it lays. “Davies.”
Bobby’s silence is enough to say they were dumb enough to leave the Walls. “Yeah, thought so. Anything else you’re calling to yell at me about?”
Mick goes off to his own work while Dean stands before the door leading to Allen - Castiel’s - office, his hand shaking as he looks at the doorknob. He’d say that he was being an idiot, but a lot had changed in the past few hours. Hell, the past few
Bela chuckles before they get to the home again just ahead of the rain. Benny had taken a shine to most of the servants, and while he was treated as an equal out on the road, he enjoyed being with the servants and helping out. Mick was still out, checking on some cemetery or area nearby.  “One of the guys, Phillip, stated the Ganems were
, at least it’s well enough to make demands,” Balthazar snarks back, which results in Dean and he having to hold the two back before Dean said, “How about we have an exhibition? If we’re getting more Hunters and the like who are not always full of themselves, and your Angels obviously have a wish to learn as well. We can both see how the other works, and make things better for both sides, and better for the town.”
“My sister is competent and able to defend herself,” Dean assures her, “and while she is unmarried, she does tend to attack any she doesn’t know.” Rachel looks almost upset at that, but Dean simply chuckles. “Forgive the answer. One of the new servants went with her, as they were going to be near the girl’s home, and she wished to check on her remaining family.”
“So, gentlemen, if you’re both done? We can start the whole thing here, or you both can get to your corners.” The silence between the two get Crowley to smile. “Good. I’m sure Naomi will be glad to know we’re all civil.”
“My sister isn’t going by her real name while she’s here. She’s been called by our father to return to witness my marriage, and we received a letter from her, stating she was not leaving here, spouting some nonsense about being the ‘lady’ of the estate, that she’s already being courted!” Castiel winced at that last part, and how loud things he was. “Father wasn’t able to travel, and Mother was too upset to travel, so we have come here to make sure she’d not be put under some spell or illusion, that your Garrison had not pulled her into something immoral.”
Dean hates this. Some of it had been explained, and while telling the garrison had been an option, their first meeting had failed so greatly at that ball, and now with all of this, it was a wonder they weren’t already demanding answers. Bela had already mentioned they were asking about the seal - so was everyone else. Breaking a Campbell seal required you to
The thought gets Millie to huff a bit as her mind now moves to the reactions of everyone at her introduction. Sandover had been a lovely, if stiff, town when Dean was around, but with Millie, they all seemed happy to explain how
They started by dividing up what needed to be done, though Dean found himself discovering new bits of the house that needed repair with each time, while Castiel appeared more and more inclined to believe Dean’s assessment that while they tried, it was not quite good enough for the house repairs. The day wears by quickly, and before Dean knows it, the sun is setting on the area as Castiel looks over at Dean. “Ah, it’s getting quite late.”
” Uriel asks, sounding curious as the others wait. Castiel was put into Investigators for a reason, but so was Uriel, even though he worked mostly with Enforcers. The other man was good with scenes or taking care of low-level gangs, but things like this…patterns, possible motivations….
thanks for saving you?”
“Dunno how quick that is,” he mutters, “It’s been a few since I’ve seen him.” He sees some news about the pulling a Seraph to the Garden, as well as the notices about the Recycler being down for a bit. He frowns as he considers that before saying, “I’ll talk later, ok? I got to run a few errands.”
Bela Talbot huffs before heading away, leaving Castiel to consider what he and Dean had spoken about, but also what Bela Talbot had insinuated about Naomi. He wants to argue it, save for the fact that Bela
“Rough night sir?”
Dean scrubs himself down first before running the water, then doing it again. He’s lost his suit, the Walls are probably uninhabitable right now, and that bastard Seraph nearly got him
“Wonderful! I’ll hold you to it,” Balthazar says with another smirk as Mick now makes his appearance, coming to show them to the carriage. Dean follows and makes sure the group has left before he glances over to Mick, who appears a bit flustered by their departure.
Uriel is unnaturally upset by something or other for the next two days, and while Balthazar spends much of his time either drinking or checking through their arsenal - as his normal routine - Castiel works in silence to learn what he can. Naomi and Samandiriel work to strengthen Samandiriel’s abilities, practicing outside when they can, or going into town to work with the others who are also magically inclined. As such, he’s not surprised by a visit from Meg a few days after the disastrous ball, arriving with some news and gossip she’d gained from Sir Adler and others around him.
Formal introductions are then made there for the other Angels besides Castiel - Joanna Harville, late of the Harville Wayhouse Estate, is nowhere near as graceful and honestly far worse than Dean was at their tact, enough that Castiel almost questions if Joanna is similar to Dean in some way, shape, or form, and has a male name to go there. Still, no one asks her reason for being there, as over the months many had come to accept Dean’s odd turn, Millie’s lack of appearance, and all the rest had gotten the townsfolk used to the strangeness of the Smith group. Meg was honestly happier to have someone to gossip with in Bela, and with Miss Harville now, perhaps Balthazar and Naomi will stop being so upset.
Benny smiles and nods. “A ‘maybe’ is better than a ‘no’. If you need any help with a case--.”
The tall runner doesn’t bother acknowledging the apparent jab at how difficult things might get, waving as he heads out. “Pleasure doing business with you all. If you need more help, you know where to get in contact.”
estate, but everything else? This is why we colonists left their so-called ‘empire’.”
“My, what’s got them so upset?” Balthazar asks as Uriel remains silent, their talkative brother cleaning his weapons and ensuring they are ready for use, “Though I’m a bit sad to hear it’ll be that brother of hers. The woman was cute enough.”
She smiles at him before continuing, “The point is many will see Uriel’s attention to Mr. Davies as obvious favoritism if they know how he is. If they don’t, they’ll see it as him being incredibly rude to the one who saved him. He’ll have to apologize if it becomes a big enough insult.” Castiel is quiet about it as Meg finally adds as well, “Whatever else is going on, Uriel
? And a family that was going to join the Men of Letters? It only seemed to add to Dean’s already-low expectations of the family they’d once held in such esteem. “Considering all that I would have done, and that we were both trained the same way to various extents, I didn’t think he’d be so stupid, or worse, that they’d leave it here in such a state. Grandpa would’ve had my head.” Bela gives them a sympathetic look, while Benny claps them on the shoulder to comfort them.
The idea makes Dean’s mouth go dry as he looks back at Castiel. “What?”
“And then you go and whip up something like this,” Benny mutters as they get him to the horses, “Should’ve banged him up a bit.”
to join the Men of Letters, and were having a whist party when the Dreadful got in. Apparently, the Campbell who came here was tracking them, but failed to notice both, only killing one of them in the party.”
The ball at Fielkett, and the arrival of a new addition to the Smith party...or are they?
Dean finishes their own search of the home, coming up empty for the Aquarian star that denoted any sort of link to the Men of Letters, let alone a simple pentagram to protect areas. The same was true for all the possible hidden ways in or out - that certainly explained why so many had died or been infected here. They see some areas that could work for a path out, but they’ll need to get the plans first, and once more call upon the Angels for their help.
Dean nods in understanding, looking over to Benny and another servant, “I know some of the servants have homes, but we do need to keep them in for tonight, any still here, and some warding set up in the homes nearby if possible. I’ll send out the message with a protected servant - I think you mentioned your son was a fast runner and had protection?” The footman nods. “Ok, I’ll make up a necklace just in case - I trust you, but more protection is better.”They glanced at Bela next, “If you can, please send out word to some of the others too. If it’s bad enough to get an Angel, even if by luck, it might get bolder.”
“How can I be sure you’re telling the truth? And either way, the Seraphs went down to the Garden last night. Not a whole lot of people left.” He hadn’t managed to contact Bobby before coming in to work, so he’d have to take his lunch time, if he wasn’t being monitored already. “‘Sides, I’m a liability.”
“Then I suppose you will have to find them out for me, and between us, we might get the truth out.” He glances over to where he sees Bela Talbot sitting by herself, walking over to offer her a bow and ask for the next dance.
Allen nods, glancing at the handprint. “Yes. It’s become reported from others like you – those who have managed to leave Alistair’s hold and gain a normal life – that they sense the descent or powers of Seraphs. However, there is a problem.”
“I’m sure an apology to my sister will cover it all,” the interruption gets both to turn, Dean Smith offering them a far easier smile than normal, though he obviously was still upset over whatever he thought. “Forgive the interruption. I was passing through and hear something like someone in pain. I wanted to make sure it was no extra danger, especially not so close to your Garrison.” He offers both of them a smile. “You’ve both been helping us all out in the past few days, especially with the sudden Dreadfuls coming in. I do apologize if in all of that, the first impression we both got of one another was wrong.”
It was the Men of Letters, a group of elites bred In Utero who were considered “stolen ladders”, that came up with the first Evaluations and Placement, a series of tests to counter the schism and what they saw as another push back to the “darkness” of Uncivilized behaviors - not Savagery, as the ones who ran and gave up on Civilization as we know it, but to the failed past, the failed experiments that pushed humanity back for having ‘gone ahead too quickly’. Others quickly followed, and though there was some of that Uncivilized push-back, not enough to stop the rollout and have the basic Evaluations and Placements get taken up by everyone, changing the culture all but overnight. Civilized was now not divided so much, and got closer and closer to a brave future.
” He stops, looking away. “
“Oh. I’d get out of here if I were you, I just saw Winchester coming down this way.” The boy’s voice wasn’t mean, it wasn’t sad or pitying, but it did sound a lot like he would rather not be in the same room as Castiel. It was, after all, a danger to others to get caught with him when the Knights are on the prowl. Against his better judgement, Castiel let his head fall back and hit the wall, and winced immediately after because it hurt. A lot.
Dean walked out of Bobby’s house with a feeling of accomplishment and trepidation. He was still a little shaken by what had happened that morning, but he was trying desperately to let go of the shakes. He had only treated Castiel like he would normally, and now his brain was trying to split itself in half with different opinions. And don’t forget the damn guilt! It was trying to drill into his fucking stomach like some sort of groundhog from hell. And Dean tried, he tried so hard, but he couldn’t logic his way out of it. He could definitely trace an increase of guilt back to his conversation with Al, but that was little surprise.
She had her hair cut a bit shorter, and fluffy too. She looked like she had showered while he was at school, and had a nice outfit on. But she marched in and grabbed Castiel by the arm, dragging him out and snarling, “That idiot woman couldn’t follow instructions. I told her, sweep the floor and vacuum the rug but she didn’t listen, and now I’ve got scratch marks all up the floor.” She marched Castiel down the stairs and hissed at him, “But I don’t have time to get another cleaner, so you’ll have to make do. Sweep the floor, vacuum the rug, dust the shelves, clean the windows, and anything else that needs doing.” She slapped a broom into his hand and swept back up the stairs again. “And make it quick!” she called down, before slamming her bedroom door shut.
The reached the car and he made a point to grab the handle with his free left hand, even though he was a righty. Inside the car, he went back to rubbing it feverishly. He had pushed up the sleeve of his jacket, and his mother was looking at him strangely, a little bit angrily from what he could see from the corner of his eyes.
Castiel rubbed his arm again, and though he could feel the just there dregs of hunger brewing in his stomach, he figured he could wait a few more hours. He had grown quite resilient of hunger pains over the years, and he didn’t want to shift his mother’s mood into something angrier just now. Sometimes he could just walk into a room and she’d go off on him. Like the night with the spaghetti.
When the books were all checked out and scanned, he said a quick thank you to the young woman and dashed off, almost running out the doors. It was funny, he had felt so safe coming into the building, only to have that torn away when four people started laughing. It made his vision blurry with anger, and he almost stomped on his way home.
Hey! Thanks so much for being here another chapter more! ISetFireToMary2016, I really enjoyed your countdown the last week! THANK YOU Viplaja, for your help. I think we'll be seeing evidence of that in the next chapter. Hey, I was thinking of changing the name because let's face it, "why are you doing this" SUCKS. It sucks butt. So, if you have any suggestions, help me out in the comments below! Thanks so so so so so much for reading.
Hands clamped around his arms, immediately dragging him back. Laughs came from the person dragging him along. Castiel grunted and thrashed, getting one hand free momentarily before it was crushed in the young man’s grip. From behind him Azazel spoke. “I wouldn’t try to get free too hard if I were you. Those bruises look nasty, and I would hate to make them...worse.” Azazel punched him hard on the nose, making it bleed profusely.
“Yay!” She crowed, sitting down with a thump. “So I’ve told you mine, what’s your name?”
“Be a little more specific, maybe?”
Novak nodded.
“How did you break your arm?” She asked simply. It wasn’t what he was expecting.
Castiel frowned, thinking about that strange night when his mother threw a bowl of spaghetti at him for seemingly no reason. He assumed after the incident that his father had something to do with it. His father often was the cause of lots of anger on his mother’s part.
“Okay…” Sam said, turning to the shelf of VHS near the TV, “I’m gonna take that as a yes. Anything you wanna watch? The Godfather? Animaniacs? Loony Toons? Scooby Doo Legend of the Vampire? Hunger Games One? It’s the only one we have.”
But Dean didn’t think he’d be that stupid. And besides, the dude could barely wipe his ass without help this morning.
This hadn’t been the first time they had payed someone to lure him in, of course. He was like a fish, and the hook always seemed to be scraping at his throat. They could reel him in any time they wanted, for less than twenty dollars.
“Really?” Sam spat, he was positively shaking with anger, and Dean knew any other time he would’ve found it funny. “Really, Dean?”
Castiel stumbled unwillingly to the locker room door, and then was pushed through it roughly. Winchester almost carried him through the musty-smelling room, he was trying to escape but every time he even got close the boy holding him would lift him almost off the ground, crushing him in an unfriendly and tight embrace. Castiel cried out at last when his ribs absolutely screamed in agony during one of these lifts. Dean chuckled softly.
“Why-are you here?” Castiel asked weakly, throat sore from screaming for help and the squeezing it had been given minutes previously. When he spoke it burned.
“Shut up Abernathy, I don’t see you contributing much to the conversation.” Azazel shot at Alistar, who glared at the other boy threateningly.
Too late now. His father had caught him with his pants down. Castiel was a little embarrassed that he had let himself get caught only the first night into his father’s stay. If he couldn’t keep his guard up for more than a day, how would he even survive this visit?
He crouched and hurried to the other side of the machine, and got behind it just in time to see Dean walk in front of him and to the ancient Pac Man. Cas breathed a sigh of relief when Dean didn't see him, and stood fully when Dean was busy playing the machine. Cas’s eyes lingered on Dean’s plaid clad shoulders for some reason, and he had to tear his gaze away as he started to make his way to the door. His heart was beating fast from the scare.
“Then he has to find his own damn way someplace else. This isn’t a hotel. We can’t afford-” Dean cut off, and looked at Sam. “He’s not family. We can’t just let some- pathetic kid stay here just because we feel bad, or his dad’s a hardass-”
Stitches holding. Fast, steady.
“-too long! Do you want to kill-” cough. Cough. “-twerp, but being charged with manslaughter-” COUGH cough “-not how I want to end my day!” Dean’s voice cut through the moments that Castiel drew in his laboured breaths.
Once he cleared the door he walked until he came across his locker and slammed it open, steaming from the ears. Not literally, of course.
When he got back inside his house, it was 11. He was hit with a blast of hot air when he walked inside, though it was 60 degrees outside. It hadn’t been this warm when he left, had his mother turned the thermostat up? Weird, she never got out of bed early on a Sunday.
As soon as he finished his inner dialogue, he felt foolish. Normal people don’t curse out their own brain.
“So, what class do you have after this?” She asked, wiping her mouth on the sleeve of the olive jacket she was wearing.
“Whoever it is you have in the back of your…” He looked at Dean’s beautiful wonderful majestic eye-striking impala and spat out “-car, I’m sure it’s not my son. I don’t have a son anymore.”
He looked at his reflection in the mirror, especially the cast, and noticed that the crude drawings and threateningly sweet messages from the knights of hell were still there. He would have to scribble them out sometime.
"Yeah, sure." Drawled Winchester.
Winchester stepped out from a brick alcove in the wall of the school, next to Castiel. He didn’t make an attempt to grab him, and as Castiel skittered back with his heart pounding Winchester just looked at him with a face like a concrete wall. The only emotion that showed flickered in the green eyes, and Castiel couldn’t identify it. Whatever it was, it wasn’t exactly friendly.
She looked back at the TV and said “Dinner’s at 5 and you’re making it.”
In the shadow of the ally he watched a group of teenagers walk by, younger than him. He felt a little foolish for being afraid of a bunch of fourteen year olds for a few seconds, before his rib reminded him why he should stay out of trouble for a while.
“Here! Take it and leave!” She full on screamed, and hurled the glass bowl full of food at him. He threw his hands in front of him in reflex, but it sailed through them and hit his side. She had remarkable aim.
“I don’t know where he is!” He raised his voice an octave, and a freshmen nearby scuttled away nervously. Jo glared at him. “I don’t.” He said, defensively.
Dean lifts his angel. Carefully, fearfully.
The eggs were done very quickly, and he scraped them onto a plate quickly and grabbed a fork from the silverware drawer. Then he put the plate onto the table in the living room, where his mother ate when his father wasn’t home and she didn’t feel like eating in front of the TV.
Dean lover weightless, lifeless.
“Would they take you?” Dean asked, hopefully. “Could you drive down? Would they pick you up? Preferably some time now.”
“H-hello father.” Castiel ventured. His father was standing in front of him, silently tapping at his phone. He gave no notice of his only son, and Castiel waited patiently and nervously while his father’s brow furrowed.
Castiel walked to the local Catholic church every sunday. He enjoyed sitting through the masses, and payed close attention to the gospel, even though the old priest hardly ever had any different messages to give out. Father McGregor was edging up on 85, and still up at the pulpit. But his sermons were oddly calming for Castiel to listen to.
Sam was boiling with fury, and Dean wasn’t exactly feeling calm himself. Still drooling, Novak slept on.
He glanced at her door down the hall, and was relieved to see it closed. She was sleeping then, which meant she wouldn’t come home in the middle of the afternoon with a wicked hangover and a thunderstorm of a bad mood. He crept down the stairs, which thankfully were fairly new and didn’t creak.
Feeling: uneasy
“Don’t call me Cas.” He barked. He didn’t like it when people gave him nicknames. They could call him Castiel, that was it. His expression was icy.
And another question, why was Jo so insistent that he stay safe at home? Even if she thought something else was going on, she couldn’t have suspected his father. Whenever they were seen in public the ‘normal’ charade was slapped on so thickly that even Castiel had a hard time seeing through it himself. The fakeness of it all was nauseating. He knew that people thought he had it made, basically all people who had never seen his bruises. Maybe Joe was the one exception? Castiel wasn’t sure whether he was glad Jo could see through lies, or he wanted her to shut up about it because his father would kill him if he knew she’d figured it out.
Novak had just told him quite emphatically that his Dad wouldn’t be taking him back anytime soon. Rather than doubt this and assume Novak’s pride was bigger than his common sense (He still did assume this) Dean decided to move on and figure out what to do next.
An hour and a half later, Castiel put away the cleaning supplies as he smelled his mother’s soup that was coming together in the kitchen. He cracked his neck as he viewed his fine work, and the house practically sparkled back at him. His father would be home very very soon.
Dean went next. He drew a couple dicks and wrote “AMPUTATE HERE” In all caps with a dotted line under it. Castiel visibly paled at that, even though Dean doubted there was any chance someone would take those instructions literally.
Sam nodded and skipped off to the kitchen, from which Castiel could hear something being taken out of a squeaky kitchen cabinet. A few minutes later there was the sound of pouring kernels, not microwave like Castiel had expected, and Samuel started something that made a buzzing roaring sound for several minutes. A popcorn popper, probably. After maybe 5 minutes, Sam stopped the machine and Castiel heard more cabinets opening. After that, the tween arrived back in the room with two huge tupperwares (bigger than any bucket of popcorn Castiel had ever seen) filled with fresh yellow kernels. He held a melted bowl of butter in one hand, and asked Castiel if he wanted any on his popcorn. It was very strange. He declined.
Slowly, Castiel started raising his battered person up, until his father grew impatient and pulled him roughly up by the armpits, making the world spin and his head light. Castiel looked dazedly in the direction of his father as he jerked out of his hands and fell back against the wall. “What do you mean- mother’s dead?” He whispered.
The drive home was laced with tension. His mother was not happy, in one of her moods that resulted in her either binge watching tv all day, drinking 5 cups of whiskey-infused coffee and beating Castiel, or sleeping for 5 hours. Or all at once, not specifically in that order. Castiel’s mood was gradually receding.
They got out of the dim, and back into the sunlight. Dean grew suddenly nervous as a passerby on the street stared as she walked by. He walked quicker, despite Castiel’s pained gasps with his footfalls. It was just a little ways to the car…
Last period. This was it. If the Knights of Hell would get him today, it would almost certainly be directly after this class. If they mentioned Jo, if they talked about her helping them, Castiel was going to get away from her.
He then went to the kitchen to get himself something to eat, he was starving and needed something to get his mind off the plaster encasing his arm.
“It’s a little early, tough guy.” Dean declared loftily. “I got pizza.” He threw over his shoulder.
“Yes. Thank you.” Castiel responded, in a voice that some might describe as ‘dead’, And more than a little horse.
“I- I’m just going to go…” he pointed at the stairs despite the fact that his mother was looking at the wall again, and mumbled the word ‘change’ as he turned and bolted up the stairs.
The doctor came back into the room after they made the call, and Castiel’s mother was close behind him. Her eyes landed on him and stayed, a mixture of anger and sadness in them.
When he had the coffee going he turned back to the pan and poured the beaten eggs into it, grabbing a green rubber spatula from a drawer and prodding it. The heat of the pan almost burned the eggs, and certainly would ruin them if he turned his back on them for any amount of time. Idiot, you should have watched the pan better. You know better than this. He mentally scolded himself, since there was no one else around to do it for him.
He plotted along after her, in complete silence. He would look like a coward if he didn't help her, but he didn’t care about looking like a jerk. He didn’t answer when she asked him questions, preferring to make it a one sided conversation. She stopped asking him things after the third try, but didn’t seem sad about it.
His mother stared at the mess, and walked to the kitchen cupboard. She then handed him the mop, said “Clean it up.”, and walked slowly and calmly out of the room.
Winchester looked at Castiel with a warning in his eyes. Castiel disregarded it. He stomped as hard as he could manage on Alistar’s foot, who yelled out and threw him to Winchester, eyes a little red at the pain. Dean caught him easily, though Castiel fought his arms, and wrapped them tightly around his torso. Castiel desperately thrashed from side to side, and Dean muttered “Keep doin’ that and you’ll be doing more than just getting wet.”
“Sam, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Stay out of it, if you know what’s good for you.” He turned back around before he heard Sam huff defiantly, at which he swung back. “I mean it, alright? Don’t come to my school, don’t go looking for trouble. I know how you work, and I know how my school works, and I’d rather you just drop it now rather than get tangled up in this mess, dude.”
His vision was growing foggy from exhaustion. Alistair stood, finished speaking for now apparently, and leaned down to grab Castiel, to shove him against the wall. Seeing opportunity Castiel raised his leg and kicked Alistair (somehow, he wasn’t sure exactly how he managed it) hard in the balls again. His attacker was crumpling to the ground, but there was no strength in Castiel’s body anymore. He felt himself sag into his surroundings, even though every instinct and ounce of will he had was screaming at him to run, crawl away from this person. He was just so tired…..
“I kind of find that hard to believe Dean.” He said softly. “If he’s so well off and protected, then why hasn’t he told anyone yet? Because from where I stand, this doesn’t sound like a one time thing.”
He unloaded his books at the checkout desk and tried to hurry the young librarian along, twisting around every three seconds to make sure Winchester wasn't going to grab him from behind or something.
Inside, the house was quiet. The floor was mopped and unswept, the walls and surfaces needed dusting and the kitchen and living room needed tidying up. Castiel did a quick assessment of the damage before he noticed his mother sitting in a chair in the dining room, with a pretty red dress on and nice earrings. After he’s done cleaning, Castiel should go change too. He walked to the base of the stairs and dropped his backpack on them without leaning down and irritating his back.
He was off, zooming to get groceries. $25 was enough to feed two-- three- people for a few weeks, right? Especially if he talked to Sam, told him to keep that vacuum he called a mouth shut for once after mealtimes. So much food of theirs disappeared into Sam’s gullet Dean sometimes wondered if he was actually saving it to feed a refugee family of five somewhere. And Castiel would only be with them a few days…
And Jo had come over just a few hours ago, and filled him in on what had happened in his absence.
“Are you sure? Because you look so tired, you probably wouldn’t be up for pie for desert.” Damn. His dad knew how to play it.
His face was just bruised and scraped, nothing was bleeding but scabs were tucked into his hairline and scrapes with hard scabby outsides where framing his face. It was vague how many times his face scraped the painted concrete edge of the pool yesterday, but it must have been a lot because the lacerations on his cheeks were more numerous than usual.
“Little bitch didn’t even have the balls to rat on us” Azazel replied, and they kept up the banter for a couple more minutes, until Dean heard Sam come home.
“Coward.”
But he didn’t breathe. He didn’t let go that easily. Alistar was still holding him under when he started to lose consciousness.
Sort of.
He got out of the shower and got dressed, combing his hair with his fingers. Then there was a knock on his door. “Yeah?” He called, and then remembered the door was locked. He opened it.
He turned the last corner to the Hospital emergency room, feeling his nerves kick back up and flutter around in his stomach. He didn’t like going here much.
trained in such a manner.”
Millie smiles a bit at that, pausing as they hear something moving in the undergrowth. The two shift as a Dreadful slowly starts to rise up, eyes briefly flashing black to show the arrival of the lesser, vengeful spirits called ‘demons’ by some.
He sighs, trying to not pity her too much. “I am sorry.”
” The mention gets everyone to mutter, but the buyer doesn’t look too upset over it, waving his hand to silence the people with him.
Your career path, best breeding partner, and friends and family were all set at each visit and Evaluation that took place. Each time a person came in to challenge a Placement, a valid reason had to be given, but the most recent official Evaluation also had to give a 60% or higher chance of the challenge succeeding. Failing to meet that criteria and continuing through with whatever idea there is could result in a ReEvalutation, a mark on all governmental and public records, and plenty of issues for that push if it failed to follow through.
The final is from their father, written by his main advisor Bobby Singer, saying that they are to return at once and witness the union between Sam Winchester and Lady Jessica Moore, and to accept the proposal of someone Father had found who was ‘far above their worth, but would dane to enter into engagement with them’. Dean had to laugh at that last one, though it comes out far more bitter than they’d expected it to. They let out a sigh as they head to the small office to work on their replies, debating on exactly how curt they’ll be with their Father’s demands, and what might keep things at bay for the time being. For all they’d once looked up to and idolized their family, the years of being cast out and forgotten by all had only shown them exactly how bad things could get, once their supposed usefulness was done with.
“A blessing on the home. While most of the Dreadfuls were killed yesterday, that doesn’t end their threat, and the fact that there are lesser spirits around could easily make any guests or dances we host later on dangerous, and I’m hoping to host one, if only to get to know the community we’re in.” He pets the horse, calming it. “Besides, I saw some of the sigils you set up in the hall during the dance. They were really good. Ain’t seen something that useful or powerful in a while.”
Dean finishes his coffee and heads to one of the sheds, opening it up to reveal the covered car. The classic Dodge Impala is not the best car, but it’s his, and he’s been driving it, and others like it since his Dad gifted it to him when he was 18, just before the full Evaluation put him as a Hunter. Dean had done his best to keep it ready for these days, but it had been a while since he checked on it, and he doubted that it was still fully in working order. He spends the day testing it, making sure everything is good and ready before driving it out to be ready the next day, then going in for dinner. Sonny smiles at him when he sees it, though more than a few kids are worried and at least two are obviously upset.
Dean can’t think about that, though, his mind too trapped by his body’s need as pleasure soaks through him. “Ah, s-sir…ah, n-no…”
“Let’s go.”
“The bastard has a death wish!” Bal’s announcement is ignored as Uriel and Castiel head out, going to where the discrepancy had been found, pausing as they find the discarded mask but nothing else. Castiel moves back, allowing one of the other Investigators to get it for evidence while he thinks. Without knowing where Quicksilver is headed, tracking his next exit point is currently impossible. They might have to search the feeds for anything strange, but often Quicksilver is able to avoid the cameras, or blend in enough to hide where he is. This time, having gone through the sewers, he’ll need to clean up, or he’ll have to get a new set of clothing after discarding the others and cleaning off the rest of himself.
“You were quite distraught. What happened?”
Dean Smith nods, still petting the horse, then says, “Well, thank you for the advice and talk, then. I do hope you both have a good rest of your day. Castiel, Miss Masters.” He tips his hat again before turning to ride off.
His left arm aches as he rushes to the Walls, sneaking into the panicking area and quickly leading a few to safe hiding areas in the Scrapyard. The quiet from no Recycler being used is eerie and makes it even more difficult to hide in than normal. Still, the kids and their families quicky head off, ready to hide wherever they can, while Dean continues his work. He sets off a few more alarms and creates more chaos where he can, until he hears the familiar sound of something coming for him.
If Dean Smith, who was an upstanding citizen, could be so disturbed, then what would one like Quicksilver feel?
“Dean, you’ll tell me if something is bothering you,” Allen mutters, moving closer as Dean sits down heavily on the bed, now looking up at him. He realizes that Allen’s still holding his left arm, and unlike Dean, he’s very,
“Did you hear?” Charlie asks him excitedly, “Quicksilver got something again!”
“Your sister was talkative during our dance,” Castiel mentions after the first turn around the room.
“That...I didn’t think it would be you,” Castiel says, “I had hoped to bring you into this any other way. As for the…” he motions to where the mark is on his arm, “There is little written on the subject, but it’s likely due to a combination of what was done to you in Perdition, as well as what I was doing at the time.” Dean frowns at that, Castiel continuing as he says, “I was attempting to heal you. Another bit of literature suggests it could also be that your body is compatible with being a Seraph.”
“I assume doing two things at once is tiring then?” Millie teases him, getting Castiel to cast her a look as they bow. “Forgive the teasing, but you seem far more serious than I...imagined.”
“Knew?”
, but those were becoming fewer and further between with each interaction. Still, Dean was always in a sour mood the day after Seraphs were called down somewhere - if he sensed them, it meant he was disturbed.
“We got the ones here, but we still need to care for the dead.” Dean looked over at Sir Adler, offering a smile that didn’t falter like the one he gave Castiel, turning enough for Castiel to see the knife Dean was pushing back up his sleeve, the runes on it making Castiel freeze as he realized what it was.
The world was once divided far more by one’s blood than by outward appearance, though that could be a factor as well. It had been a generation before the divide was set. In Utero - a live, unaltered Human - over In Vitro - one designed by the family, at cost, to fit the parent’s needs. The statistical probabilities of many genetic issues and diseases were taken down, but then...then things started to happen. Uteros lived longer than expected - when they were tracked, though the lack of such tracking resulted in the first of the Savagelands being created, outside of the Civilized cities. Vitros found themselves also having genetic instability at times, though at others, the smallest defect could mean taking away their chances, yet many others exceeded. The divide became harder and harder to hide, and even more difficult was the continued attempts to keep the In Vitro sciences alive, but failing as “chance” and nature took over instead.
Empyrean divided itself by the category of Angels left via Dante and other Christian faiths, with Castiel and the others being near the top. Seraph was within the First Sphere, acting as those who looked into various things and had the same power as many high-up leaders and the like. Uriel was one who, though dangerous in a fight, only gained the title of Powers in the Second Sphere. Balthazar was a Dominion, higher up on that Uriel in the Second Sphere, and Hannah was a Virtue. Naomi, like Castiel, was a Seraph, though her focus was more on giving out the Placements and interpreting messy Evaluations that might come in. Castiel was often called, among others in Empyrean, a cross between a Cherub and Seraph, as he not only contemplated the information given, but also was loyal to what he believed, as any Seraph was. Below them, the Third Sphere, tended to be the ones who interacted with and issued the Evaluations in a variety of ways - Angels for general Evaluations or going out to encourage others to join Empyrean if they were a high enough score. Archangels were Angel’s supervisors, and Principalities worked with Powers and Thrones to get the new Placements set up in the Empyrean group somewhere.
It’s strange he goes from disliking Dean and the others to realizing how useful they are. He also realizes that despite her link to Dean, he does actually care about Millie, enough he begins to slowly work up the courage to write a bit more in the note beyond simply his apology for their callous misuse of protections. If anything, now it’s become more and more a long letter detailing how he would like to court her.
“Hello to you too, Bobby. What do you mean?”
It was now Dean’s turn to look away, eyes downcast. Castiel catches the barest hint of the look, but understands immediately. He says, “Forgive my earlier rudeness, as I asked. My beliefs, even during this conversation, have remained much the same, though new information has caused me to think perhaps I approached this in the wrong way. Allow me to at least write down what I meant, so there can be no way for you to misunderstand me.”
Meg smiles at that. It makes sense - though Naomi was a woman, she was not gifted in embroidery, though she was able to deal with things as far as sewing and mending. In Meg’s eyes, if you had the time to learn to embroider while being an Angel, you obviously weren’t that good of an Angel, or had a lot of time on your hands. Of course,
“And what? I might as well. The hell will I lose if I do? The Centre isn’t a Hunter’s Centre, and with Crowley and the others there, I can do it without any push to answer ‘right’.”
“The man who had the gun is former French Creole,” she tells Castiel as they go in for some refreshments, “From their Louisiana area in the colonies. Much beyond that is not known of Dean Smith and his merry band, but it’s said they have a storied legacy before arriving here.” She takes the offered apple and bites into it. “Rumors that Sam Winchester came around Fielkett shortly after the Smith group arrived are pretty high now.”
“I’m sure,” he mutters, “though it is perhaps as open and honest as your own.”
knew how, but only by virtue of having to make and redo various embroideries for the inn.
The observation is enough to get Castiel to smile. “That is the conclusion I came to, though not for us, but for Quicksilver.” To his credit, Dean doesn’t even pause at the mention of what Castiel now knows as his alter-ego, as much as Dean Smith was a cover, or the one who bought this room was. “You never were so careless before. Even after your time in Hell. What did they give you in exchange for something like that, and why take the job?”
“I think it’d only be fair since your
“The Dreadfuls made it from the woods!” came the alarm with a French lilt to its words, the non-fighters quickly rushing to safety when they realized what was happening. Sir Adler directs them as Castiel yells out to the garrison, “Balthazar, Uriel, be ready, Samandiriel, Meg, everyone, prepare!”
Castiel looks at Uriel in confusion as he closes his fever bright eyes. Uriel had never been one to enjoy the company of humans, not after they’d gained the status of Angels. It was understandable - Uriel and Raphael had been maligned and hated, dismissed in many cases, if not outright vilified, and pushed to angry reactions. Remiel had been as well, though for other reasons before they’d given the Hunters and Men of Letters time by destroying Cunningham bridge. Remiel had found and brought them in - Uriel had joined Castiel’s garrison shortly afterward, and had remained after they’d run to the country. His hate had continued, enough so even children were afraid of him when they went into town.
“What if the reports are wrong? Created wrong, or...or anything else? What if all of that is wrong?”
Balthazar being on their side is a surprise, though he smirks when Castiel asks him about it as they walk down the entrance towards Fielkett for the dance. “They might not be the best for social things, but they at least are fun, and good in a fight.” He glances over at Uriel sternly, “You need to speak to Mr. Davies if he’s here. I won’t stand this pining of yours.”
It was only after their father explained to Dean that Sam had been infected by a Fell-touched Azazel that Dean had begun to see the cracks. Still, they’d persisted, fought, and strived until they found a way to kill Azazel, though the curse that they’d put upon Sam was now upon Dean. Dean had accepted that readily - happily, as Millie Deanna Winchester-Campbell, Blessed Lady of that noble and Good alliance, would Dean have gone to anything. They’d been afraid of the death promised then, they’d been worried of how it would affect Sam, Father, and Mother, but they’d accepted it as their cause.
“He is. But much of this would be dropped if they would simply accept that family doesn’t belong in one area, that it’s why the Placement was made! To have enough money and clout to create a child is one thing, to create it for a purpose is another, but to throw away any child born of desire or on accident...I cannot get behind that. I cannot get behind what they say about Dean Winchester, other than to say that he is
she was at hosting things than Dean had been, how long would she stay over her brother, and then also if she was as strong a fighter as her brother, or if not, perhaps she would like to have someone care for her. So like with Castiel’s painfully strange dance request, or Uriel’s continued angry glares at Mick, or any of the other weirdness going on with the Angels or the rest of the town, they’d held their tongue.
It makes him shift in confusion. Angels had their own culture in some way, but overall were often linked by birth and other factors to the one they were now in. Courting Millie Smith meant learning more about her family, and that meant befriending Dean, who was becoming easier to befriend, or looking up who their father was and speaking to him. As Dean and Millie had not spoken of their father with any warmth in their voices, Castiel believed the best and fastest route was to speak to Dean himself over this. So when they find a trail that leads them to the Fell-touched themselves - one that is malevolent and foul, which calls out poisonous threats against Dean in particular, before Castiel destroys it, that gets them to let out a bit of a sigh, though Dean seems still on edge.
Dean frowns, as if he’s uncertain of what else to say. “You said they were testing me, but the question still remains of why.”
“If weapons are all you can handle,
BALLS
“Any news?”
Lord Wincheter looks like he’s about to call him out on that, but Master Singer decides to finally steps in, holding Lord Winchester back as he speaks, obviously wanting to explain things. Castiel wonders about their side of things, but also is a bit curious why they’re still here when he all but said he doesn’t know who ‘Lady Winchester’ is.
He glances around as he gets into their servant’s area, waving to Benny and some of the others in the room. Most of them were Tiered and seemed to believe Dean had worked his way up from the Garden or a lower Tier to be here. None confused him for anything but that, and Dean was fine with it. Hell, he’d be fine if they thought he was some slave from the Garden, but then again, he’d originally gotten into his position by helping his current Investigator.
“I could, but that would also get us more trouble than we need at this juncture. I assume your tardiness was noted by your colleagues?” Dean’s still pale, but he glares at him all the same. “I either go and give the report on my own, or the moment you’re seen here, it’s
Uriel steps up, the darker man in his own simple brown and white suit, also without flairs, glancing over before saying to Castiel, “There. The new owner of Fielkett and his entourage.”
“What do you want?”
“A hard time sleeping,” Mick asks as they get a bit further away, “sounds pretty bad. I heard a few people had that earlier too. One was hoping to find his brother and see if he could get some help.” Dean stops, glancing at Mick as he offers a wry smile. “I couldn’t be sure until today and didn’t get a chance to talk to you.”
,” Benny says, pausing to glance around before Dean shakes his head. “Still going in?”
“Christian, then,” Dean mutters, “I didn’t think he’d be so stupid.”
The memory of the hard knocking, and seeing Castiel and Ward outside of his door, gets him to snort. “Yeah, really good job there.” The cool look that Castiel gives him makes Dean remember what he was willing to offer to make Allen believe he wasn’t Quicksilver, and... just….
Yes, you can send a hive of bees through the mail.
“Though you’ve been of great help in the last year, Dean, I did manage before you came along. I’ll be fine for today.”
“Is this because of the Empyrean guy on your route?” He looks to one of the others who mutters, “Dana heard stuff from Sanders, and he said Cecil saw you there during the month you weren’t around.”
“He is taking more and more risks. He ran from me early today, and now again.” The attack had given Quicksilver the time and momentum to go into the sewers. “He’s smart…when I do catch him, it will be a day to celebrate.” He sheds his own look, returning to the façade of Emmanuel Allan, before calling up a schematic of the area. “Though, I doubt he’ll be far.”
“If we go today, we could even catch Quicksilver.”
“He recently came to us, though he was with us during the battle of Cunningham Bridge.”
“I see.” He hummed as he thought. “I take it if I try to follow you, that could cause trouble?”
“I got some information on it, I’ll send it over to you when I’m in a more secure area,” he glances around before continuing to walk, “I’m off for the day. Is there anything else you want to bitch to me about, or are you just checkin’ on me?”
“What the
Dean laughs at that, hard enough that he bends over in the hallway. Castiel looks down, bending a bit to check on him as Dean finally straightens, putting an arm around Castiel. “I’m ok...just...it’s been a while since I laughed that hard.” He gives Castiel a warm smile as they walk further into the house, Castiel seeing how carefree Dean looks right now, after such a laugh.
“That goddamned stupid bastard, I hope he rots in all the unwashed
He was well and truly caught, but so was Cas. Either way, they made a great team, and Dean wasn’t about to waste time wondering if he belonged here or with Sam and Bobby. He was a child of Outland and the Echelon, and he belonged here.
“I wished to ask who I should speak to, and as you have a younger brother and speak ill of your father, perhaps I should ask him...about this.”
“You never know,” they mutter as they walk with Castiel, “things could change.”
"“Does this have to do with the fact that twice, Castiel ranked highest across all the categories, or because your brother left without attempting to get you back, even though your employment is currently open-ended?”"
“He does.” No point hiding that, though he’s pretty sure anything more will draw down a Seraph on him. “I need to talk to him about stuff.”
“Woodworking?”
self around Mick, it meant Cas was there too.
“Caught me...off guard,” Uriel whispers after seeing Castiel there, “fell-touched beast.”
“You seem quiet.”
“What question?”
“Had it not been for the different name, we would have assumed it was someone else in the building, and the trail was nearly lost a few times. It was only fatigue that allowed us to catch him, and he did manage to cause us trouble when he tried to help the others escape,” Uriel points out. The thought of it is enough to make Castiel hope that they’re right, but also hope that Dean is able to stay safe in this next part.
Dean offers a small shrug, looking a bit pained. Uriel seems to look at him even more seriously before asking, “You heard what happened to your sister, and about the attack?”
He works as subtly as he can, tracking the bracelet as it leaves the building and heads out. He does his best to remain at a distance, recalling what Dean had mentioned before about his ability to lose Castiel, but also about the cases. If he gets too close, that could cause a problem. Still, allowing Dean the chance to do this would go a long way in ensuring he remained an ally, even after this change.
said or did which switched Castiel’s mood.
Dean gets out of the shower just as there’s a sudden pounding on his front door. He jumps at it, grabbing a towel that’s just big enough to cover his hips and bits, down to his knees, gripping it with his left hand so the mark and his arm was to one side as he headed over, glad that he’d put everything away before the Seraphs descended, and opened the door as the pounding started again, angrily asking, “Wh-ah…sir?”
Castiel is surprised when, early in the morning, he is summoned to the drawing room and finds himself coming face-to-face with Sam Winchester, next Lord of the Winchester Estate, and what appears to be a stern older man, his graying beard trimmed neat and his hair slicked back. The others are probably outside, waiting, and while Castiel debates on taking them both outside to the garden, he decides against it.
“My sister, how could you?” He glances at the woman, who says something quietly to Dean before he lets her go. “Though I do admit, having to prepare a show and fight would be very interesting indeed. Shall it be at the next ball?”
“What needed to be said,” Millie mutters, “we’re not worth the time for the Angels. I’m so sorry, Mick.”
The Impala rumbles as he starts it, heading down the various roads to the Centre, in the area of town he tends to avoid like the plague. He gets more than a few looks as he drives, but as it’s been a few weeks since the big set of Placements, Enforcers don’t intercept him even as he parks and takes in a deep breath. Cas had come to warn him about what was going on. Sonny had helped him a lot since he arrived here, in need of somewhere to crash and someone to listen to his woes. The prospect of seeing Sammy again, even after is all, causes him to feel nervous.
“I let them know it pulled one,” Dean said, “and I wasn’t gonna hang around to see if it was the same bastard that tried to get me from Hell.” The reminder of what he’d gone through to try to get Sam out of Cold Oaks, the price that Sam had raked up and left Dean with, gets Bobby to shut up at least. “I’m not responsible for them not getting away or sticking to the Walls. Or did it go in to get them?”
“Accomplishments differ between people. I could say that a person might be accomplished because they are able to do all that a woman is supposed to in order to be an ‘accomplished’ woman, yet that would not work if they weren’t also seeking to continually better themselves and understand things.”
“So long as you recover, that is what matters. Naomi went to where the spirit was said to be last. I hope she finds it before Davies does.”
He’s handsome enough…maybe Allen would want him for a possible turning of the other cheek? It’d explain why Ward left so quickly. It wouldn’t be the first time Dean did this, and Allen was handsome and nice enough. Dean might actually like it.
Uriel lets out an annoyed huff of air. “I’ll need to find Ketch then. The fool thinks he’s subtle. We didn’t figure out Mick until Ketch spoke to him in such a manner.”
. I got interrogated about where I was, what I was doing, ‘cause I was dumb enough to leave a trail. I need out of here,
“Sam is arrogant, and Bobby allows that arrogance. Both are arguing that Dean
“Yes. If we catch him now, we’re one step closer to ending this threat.”
“We think it could be that they’ll contact you soon, as they may have wanted us to attack the Hunters and believed we’d create more panic and issues through it.” Dean looks at him as Castiel continues, “The attack was a success on all fronts from what we can see.”
Dean blinks at the offer, having to hold in an instant acceptance as he considers what they must do. He finally sighs and nods. “Alright, but if you need me—.”
“Don’t you mean dangerous?”
Dean pulls a bit at his arm, and Castiel lets it go without a fight before he says, “I got in contact with the guy who set up my…other jobs. My…the guy I was looking for was there. He needs me to help him.”
Dean also finishes up a few other letters to others who’ve helped them out, before hearing Mick clearing his throat from the doorway. Dean glances over at him, offering up a smile. “What’s going on, Mick?”
Well, Dean decided that he wouldn’t bother worrying about their little talk, either. That’s why he was feeling quite okay when he was walking down the road with Cas by his side. Today was Walk-To-School Wednesday – a stupid ritual that Cas made up, saying a 30-minute walk couldn’t hurt once in a while.
A petite woman with glowing red hair walked up to Dean with a quizzical look on her face.
“Fuck, I never tried singing without getting drunk,” muttered Dean under his breath. “If I don’t make it out here alive, it’s because the crowd has murdered me for making their eardrums bleed.”
“But don’t I get a thank you card or something? After all, you wouldn’t have had the ball to date him if it weren’t for my ingenious planning.”
Since he would have surely remembered someone as gorgeous as him, Castiel was sure that he’d never seen this man before. He was simply beautiful. He looked like God Himself had spent His time picking his eye colors to give the man this exact shade of green of the dense forest in the summer  for his irises and placing his freckles one by one, carefully arranging it to look like starry sky in an autumn night.
“Winchester, you just said yes to get some pies?” Charlie looked at him as if she wanted to burst out into laughter or hit him on the shoulder. Probably both.
“Sure, but that’s not what you said last time. What did you say? Oh right, you said he was ‘devastatingly handsome’.”
He hadn't thought about talking about his tattoos – he wasn't exactly planning on keeping them a secret, but he didn't think that it would be appropriate to just take his shirt off and saunter toward Dean and explain them to him. He wasn't, however, against the idea of Dean without his shirts – he saw Dean shirtless in the morning and boy was it a sight worth waking up to and it definitely made his morning much more bearable.
"Sorry."
It was 10 am when he heard his phone ringing. He picked it up too late and the notification let him know that there were 2 missed calls and several unread messages. Two of the messages were from Cas in the night, asking him if everything was alright, and the rest were also from him this morning. Dean sighed and tossed his phone on the bed before dragging his feet to head downstairs.
(Another close-up of Castiel, he is frowning slightly)
“Not for nothin’ but the last person who looked at me like that... I got laid.”
"Dean, I am feeling better now."
(Sam signs to “Eileen” when he turns around)
Marry Dean Winchester.
SAM: (sobs and gasps as he holds Dean in his arms)
SAM: Well, I don’t want to.
Castiel should have stopped him. It felt like all the alcohol had drained out of his system and he was suddenly more alert. But he didn't. Instead, he had placed his hand on Dean's neck and flushed his body against him. Dean wasn't showing any sign of resistance, rather he seemed to will his body to be pliant, following Castiel's movement.
The omega looked way too pleased as he licked his own lips, the small gesture which looked downright sinful.
“I never do that. Like, when did I do that?”
This time Dean started to talk right away after he made sure that the camera was on.
DAY 1
Castiel frowned, as he replied, “At the café – oh.”
When he finally got home, the first thing he did was to take off the coat and wash it. Still, he made a split-second decision against it and sniffed his coat. The sweet smell of the omega was mingled with other scents of his colleagues from work but he couldn’t bring himself to care as he focused solely on Michael’s scent.
"You are such a sap, Dean Winchester.”
Only when the handsome man cleared his throat to get his attention, did Castiel realize with a start that he had been staring at him too long. He quickly averted his eyes to the ground, wincing inwardly. At least it was comforting to know that no one else had been standing in the line or it would have been awkward. Perhaps it already was. Castiel’s face pulled into a frown as he lifted his head to look at the omega. To his surprise, he was grinning at him. It was merely a smile, and yet the man looked even more handsome than a moment ago – if that was remotely possible. He felt his jaws slacken and he quickly closed his mouth shut because it was not only embarrassing but also plain impolite to gape at someone. He took a deep breath and returned a small smile of his own.
They dragged him back out of the car, and Castiel struggled to get away more than ever. They had taken him to the old bridge that was somewhat near his house. It was made of metal, and overlooked a small creeke. The fall wouldn’t kill you, but it would definitely hurt, since the creek was only about a foot deep. They had parked in the middle of the road, since cars barely ever came down here. It was generally a spot kids came to get high, or drink booze.
Castiel’s father would be home maybe an hour after he left school, which gave him that much time to get home, tidy up the house a bit, do a load of laundry and generally get himself ready to wait out the storm.
“Fix things?” Dean repeated “What’s broken, Sam?”
Castiel’s pen hovered over the page, he hadn’t written a word yet. His mind was battling with itself, going back and forth on a decision he had yet to make. The pen was still waiting for him to make a final decision, as it had been for the past five minutes. That’s right, Castiel had been staring at a blank page, dipping his pen up and down in hesitation and indecision, for five whole minutes.
“Castiel, why didn’t you tell me?!” She asked him, and he couldn’t tell if the concern in her voice was real or fake. “I could have driven you here, you didn’t have have to walk sweety.” Ok. That sounded fake.
(See the end of the chapter for

Grabbing  a stick of butter from the fridge, he cut off about half an inch and dropped it in the now hot pan, tilting it a little so that the quickly melting stuff spread throughout the pan. He turned to the coffee pot sitting at the end of the counter and started filling the pot with water, going through the normal measurements and requirements.
“Art.” Castiel responded, he hoped that was the most he would have to talk to her.
He wheezed at the pressure on top of him, flattening his lungs. “Get...off” He spat out.
“Nothing, I just had an accident and fell.” He ventured, hoping she would buy the story. He would never tell her he was getting bullied, she would just laugh and tell him to man up. His arm flared again.
It’s still strange to see himself in such a uniform. Dad would have a heart attack if he saw him dressed up as the secretary to a Second Tier Investigator. The burgundy suit-jacket covers the black vest and a silver watch, with the pressed dark pants and sensible, comfortable shoes. By the time he’s out and grabs something quick to eat, so he’s not shaking by the time he’s at work, he’s right on time to reach the office, and act as Dean Smith.
“Fine, fine.” The other man hands over the sealed item and he hands back the requested piece of equipment after making sure it had what he wanted. “If you don’t know already, that’s from the Second Tier,
The choices are getting slimmer and slimmer, something Dean hates to admit to himself. The Walls are probably going to be repaired and closed off, leaving escape into the Outland impossible. Hiding down in the Garden or Scrapyard after all of this? Impossible too – he’s a pariah by now for calling down a Seraph on Walt and Roy, and it’s known by now that he spent time in Hell as Alistair’s favorite. If he leaves from work now, he’ll have a bunch of Investigators looking for him too, wanting to find out what happened, why he left…and figuring out who he was.
Benny chuckled as Dean offered a smile that showed he seemed to agree with some of Castiel’s assessment. “My...sister was one of them, or so our father claimed. I never claimed it myself for her, since I figured it’s always easier to show off your accomplishments, though not always can one get that across with first impressions.” Davies looks worried as Castiel glances around the group, then back down to the books in his hand, wondering at the verbal territory he wandered into.
It’s not something that Dean likes to think about. They get even more upset at each verbal sparring they get into with Castiel, often set off by simple observation or something similar. Benny had already called Dean on it a day or two after Dean had mentioned Father’s list, and Castiel had voiced his issues with it, and Dean had not argued his points. Before all of this, Dean would’ve defended every bit of the list, with steel if need be, but….
Meg raises an eyebrow as Castiel glances at him. “And that would be?”
The kids all seem to get it, even the ones who want to be Savage and not take the Placements. Dean doesn’t discourage it from them, and he’s not going to prove a point to them, as he said. He’s doing this for himself, and to know, for certain. If the Centre is as neutral as it can get, it will answer the questions. If not, then Dean just gets to at least know he tried, and it’s not him that’s the problem.
“Sir,” Dean says when he sees him, getting Castiel to wish they were alone. “I…didn’t even call you.”
Dean mutters in annoyance as he leans in for another kiss. “Maybe we caught each other.”
Cleaning and fixing the house only seems to bring out more of both Dean’s and the house’s original beauty. The chuckle and questions that Dean asks him comes up at the same time that Castiel discovers the dusty, frosted glass for the back door have some very pretty designs that create various rainbow designs on the nearby walls. Another time, when Dean mentions having a younger brother he sounds proud of, Castiel and Dean discover a good piece of wood to use to make into a headboard out in the dusty garage. When Dean asks again to stay on the couch for the night, starting in the second week of work, Castiel finally nods.
Mick shrugs. “I don’t think that, and you just have to convince Sam you’re not.”
“I am free for the next dance, Castiel,” she says in a near-quiet voice, blushing hard as Castiel all but
The group do their best to track the Fell-touched, since the attacks by Dreadfuls and spirits appear to be suddenly raised and actively looking for the Smith group. The Smiths are almost dangerous in their defense of the town, as if trying to defeat the foe. Castiel and Uriel finds fighting with them almost invigorating, and Castiel sees many of the same tactics that Millie employed being used by Dean.
