makes him a murderer.” Mycroft ended his statement in a huff, making it clear that he thought he was giving John an exemplary compliment.
“Mycroft.” John muttered as he straightened out his jacket once more before reaching for Sherlock’s traveling archive.
After finishing dinner, the group then retired to the back parlor connected to the dining parlor to have tea. Both Sherlock and John were listening to James recount his experiences in Paris while Mr. McArthur and Mary were standing near one of the windows speaking quietly to one another.
Mycroft disappeared from the doorway shouting for some time until his voice faded down the hallway. Both Sherlock and John watched Mycroft leave before facing each other once more.
“I was at Carberry’s last night…he hadn’t been feeling well…” John sighed again, “…after I checked his vitals, we chatted some more…and I lost my patience with him because…of some sort of experiment he was working on…”
Sherlock nodded. “I will admit that I’ve personally come across situations where the perpetuator fits your astute observations, but those were far less violent and calculated than others,” he then took another moment, posing thoughtfully again, “and with all honesty, those crimes were associated with the less fortunate who had no other recourse to navigate the cruel world we live in…” The comment elicited some mumbling from the audience, a mixture between those who agreed with Sherlock and those who found the comment to be unwarranted, but still enjoyed listening to the discussion.
“John!” It was the journalist’s turn to plead. If he had to face any more denseness he was going to explode.
John walked up to him—Gemma a shadow just one step behind his back—saying, “You know, it’s almost a pity that a place that has such spots would even allow murders in normal houses. It’d be much more atmospheric here.”
“If you would get on with it, instead of making empty chitchat, I wouldn’t mind having you around. This investigation is so maddening.” Sherlock frowned, but didn’t elaborate.
That time, his secret is safe... But it doesn't take long for John to become suspicious. Not specifically sniffing out the truth yet, but that Sherlock is Up To Something. He doesn't blame John for wanting to investigate – Sherlock's initiatives have a track record of being more than a bit not good at times – but still. His flatmate is way smarter than he gives himself credit for. He might not always deduce right at first, but he hasn't been trained by Mycroft. Given clues enough and time, he will ultimately discover his secret. And John is more than stubborn enough to keep at it until he finds out the facts. Unless Sherlock feeds him a wrong solution, of course. The detective's surge of distaste is unexpected – he's never been above a little deceit to reach his goals, after all. And the mix of disappointment and disgust that Sherlock expects to face should be more than enough motivation for anything.
“No need to call security, I assure you, prof. Cecchini. This is my brother, who should really know better than to cause a ruckus at his age,” Mycroft interjected, wringing his hands.
“Well, I can’t help if I have no idea what the problem is, can I?” Mitch asked, closing the book he’d been trying to read. Good. This couldn’t be solved with only half of his brain. Not when all of Sherlock’s was overloading.
Rushing back to the balcony without making a sound was a challenge, but John found himself beaming. They had timed it perfectly, as the agent exited onto the terrace no more than ten seconds later.
John suppressed a groan. Okay, it was a stupid joke, but how had he managed to earn such hatred in five minutes?
Still, further digging is required. It doesn't take long, now that he knows where to look, to find John's account on AO3 – password saved, so he doesn't even have to wonder which movie or what else first brought him here. With his pop culture knowledge so severely lacking, Sherlock could have been stumped for the first time. Sherlock is tempted to head-desk. TheWarDoctor. John might as well have signed by name, but – the John Hurt profile image had confused him. He's commented and bookmarked all Sherlock has ever written. Sherlock should really retire, because how could a casual Doctor Who reference blind him to word patterns and everything else that screamed John at him?
“So your little clandestine search didn’t turn up anything interesting?” he asked instead. The delight, which chased the first flash of surprise in smokey eyes, should never be elicited by discussing illegal activities. Especially not in the presence of a cop. But John was too proud of the result to warn his madman.
It would have been Sherlock’s opportunity to show off how unpleasant he could be, just as he'd planned. Simply use his naturally rumbling voice, and watch the riot start. He’d never purposefully hidden his talents, and there was no reason to, now that he was asked to display them. But his companion’s attitude overwhelmed his mind so much, that his voice turned to a whisper, too. They could have been talking dirty, for all anyone else knew. Well, Gemma could probably hear them, but she hadn’t raised a fuss. Whether because she didn’t trust his deductions or because this wasn’t the right setting to start a side investigation, he didn’t know and didn’t care. Wouldn’t someone please get him away from here? He would be completely useless if someone didn’t keep him focused on the matter at hand—and then they’d end up in jail, because the locals were insane. Why wasn’t this obvious to John?
“Our complaints have nothing at all to do with your eating, or lack of it. I figured out what you’re so obsessed about, and I promise you’re wrong. Even with Italian food, we can hit the sweet spot where you’re sated and don’t immediately fall prey to total abbiocco,” she insisted.
Well, the best lies have some truth in them. Without any time to concoct an elaborate excuse, sticking to the truth will also help. "Would you believe people expect me and Moriarty to have compatible kinks?"
The Colonel flung the door opened and walked into...the midday sun. It wasn't noon when they'd reached the cabin, and certainly there wasn't the hot weather that welcomed them when they followed. And no rocky outcrop, with green hills and mountains bluish in the distance, had been anywhere close. This trip was getting weirder and weirder. His head swivelled all around, and the formerly rusted cabin had turned into a sligtly wider, circular one, with walls of packed soil and a roof made of some sort of dried grass. He half expected a couple goats to follow after them.
John watched him walk away. Odd. No, not that Sherlock had bodily functions...but given the man's attitude, John would have expected him to postpone it. After all, there was a subject to interrogate in depth.
“You have investigated that girl’s life, right? Or just stuck with John because he happened to pass by? I don’t know her well enough, so I’ll just have a quick look, to understand which kind of person she was, and who would want her dead.” It was yelled back, Sherlock apparently not wanting to lose one more second of investigation to justify himself. Some noises pointed that he wasn’t being too gentle with the furniture, either.
They trailed out and, finally, climbed the stairs to the ‘proper’ museum floor. John wasn’t surprised to see the ticket checker fondly smile at Livia. But he was shocked when the man singled out with a glare not Alex, who was loudly complaining about having to buy a ticket in the first place, but Sherlock. What the heck? John was ready to come to the forefront of their group and give the idiot a piece of his mind, when a hand curling around his wrist stopped him. He turned towards his friend, and surprisingly flinty eyes warned him that it wasn’t the moment for a scene. In fact, when it was their turn, Sherlock was extremely polite to the asshole…until the transaction ended. Passing him, he rumbled, “He’d benefit from worrying more about his own failings….and their own hazards. Unsafe sex—especially when remunerated—is dangerous.”
He’d just sent the text when he shuddered rereading it. It was his turn not to give John time to reply.
John mentally wished him luck in love. Then again, his beloved was not paranoid about him. Maybe John should wish
“Hey, it’s okay,” John interjected, smiling, “you don’t have to do a single thing you don’t want. As long as you promise neither to leave town nor to investigate on your own, it’s fine, isn’t it?”
Mitch (the name on his birth certificate might be Mycroft, but he refused to indulge their mum’s idée fixe) sighed at his entrance.
Now, John didn’t understand Italian, but he didn’t need a language course to figure out he was being asked “Where to?” And also suspect that her apparent dull attitude before was a result of not being able to ask, “What have you taken today, mate?”
Both assumptions turned out to be correct, luckily for him. They were going back to take exams...so at least half of them were all too eager to concentrate on anything but their own fears. Before the bus even arrived, the former soldier had collected a handful of phone numbers, with offers to show him the best places to eat at, and promises to celebrate together if their tests should go well.
Livia sighed deeply. “That’s it. If we’re having this tour—and I’m all for sharing art with anyone who appreciates it—you’re both using aliases. Uncle is a Very Serious Man. With capitals. He won’t take it kindly if he thinks that you’re…taking the piss, is that the word, yes? Not even for me.”
The doctor scratched his head. Sure, it was obvious whom the man was talking about—and honestly, he would have recommended a psychiatric evaluation for the parents who thought this was a good idea. Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes. Somewhere in the world, this qualified as child abuse, he was sure. Now, the question was: could he trust Mycroft? And if he opted to believe him, what was he supposed to do with his information?
“I really don’t, as John was less than forthcoming in his call. I’m sure you have it recorded, even if you weren’t present for it, in case you distrust me. I hope you don't expect me to be a mind reader. Now, do I need to call a lawyer only for Mr. Watson or for myself, too?”
Sergio glared at them, when they went back inside. “If you want to talk about someone, you might as well keep it low enough that said person won’t hear. I would have let you search whatever you wanted as long as you asked. I just hope that you haven’t messed up any room.”
“Because it was easier than writing ‘hello, I’m Sherlock’s brother, he gave me this number and this is what you need to know’? I mean, how many Mycrofts do you think are out there?” John quipped.
From the next table, Gemma interjected, “Well, can you blame her?” So much for offering them the illusion of privacy. Or of cops connecting enough giant dots to put themselves in other people’s shoes. How did they ever solve anything?” The involuntary consulting detective glared at her, until she lowered her eyes to her own table and started playing with her fork.
“If you’re really Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, then you shouldn’t have any trouble solving this case before we do, don’t you? Of course, I’ll expect some of your precious evidence, not just finger pointing at any other plausible murderer”. She smiled like a wolf ready to bite.
“Oh thank God, Sherlock, people keep glaring at me here, I just wanted to apologise because, well, I don’t think we can see each other anymore.”
“Have you? Damn, you have more money than I expected. Staying next to the palace and all that,” Matteo quipped, green eyes glinting with a new respect.
As much as he’d wished for guidance in his new environment, one hour was more than enough for John to decide ditching his new friends was his only option. At least for the rest of the day. He even shrugged (off) their suggestion to reach the city centre by way of the elevator inside the shadowed, cool tunnels (Viola hesitated on that word, but he couldn’t very well correct her, could he?). Even when the other option was a steep climb, the sun beating on his head.
“It might have been, but sadly, that’s not a good indication here. Italians will speak to you while almost stepping on your toes, no matter what the relationship,” Sherlock replied.
The other snorted. "Yes, of course. It's not as if she needs me again, anyway. But – I promised not to dirty her, so...let's go out, gentlemen, shall we?"
It was obvious why, once what Sherlock assumed was the director walked after his brother. He was a wiry man of about sixty-five, with an undoubtedly cultivated (possibly even with a minor plastic surgery) likeness to Julius Caesar. Oh joy. The journalist might have just found someone more full of himself than his sibling—and with Mycroft’s chosen alias, Mitchell, meaning “who is like God”, that was a feat.
“Well, the Art Academy is nearby. You can’t blame them. I actually think I read this landscape is in the background of the Monna Lisa.” Matteo walked towards one of the groups, composed of two women and a man, all around twenty, if John was any judge. “Ciao, Livia!”
“Livia…in class. Which was, I don’t know, when was the last lesson? Sometime in June?” the young man said, his eyes wandering towards the ceiling.
“What kind of international? I mean, I don’t know too many languages,” the pathologist said, looking intently at what John would later discover was the handle of the cupboard behind them.
“Yeah.” He didn’t have a choice anyway, did he? It was useless to resist a cop, even when they admitted to having nefarious plans. He half expected to be brought to the prison, so when he saw the hospital in front of them, he frowned. “Are we still going to the morgue?”
“Yeah, okay well, that was all I needed,” Viola said, grinning and trying to circumnavigate the cop to hand the glass to John instead, while he moved away from her. Her friends eyed them curiously, but didn’t dare approach them, just smiling instead. At least they were sensible enough to acknowledge that a policewoman meant serious business.
“You wouldn’t need to ask if you could recognise a British passport when one is smacking you in the face. Or at least your commissioner wouldn’t, and I hope you’d take her word for it,” Sherlock snapped, fidgeting as if he was tempted to physically remove her and get to his crime scene.
John wouldn't be ashamed to admit he stared…just a little. If someone had crafted a man according to his preferences, after all, the gorgeous creature in front of him would have been the result. Long legs, lean body, and light eyes, specifically, a cloudy grey that hinted at secret depths. He caught himself in seconds, though, and mumbled, "I'll just go, then."
All John had wanted was to share a coffee and a brief chat, and maybe gain some ideas for his future, since his own promising career as an army surgeon had been shattered by a Taliban bullet. By accident—though considering the twinkling in Misha's eyes, when he apologised, John wouldn't be so sure of that—their own planned chat had overlapped with a much more serious conversation.
Viola shrugged. “I’m not sure. I tried writing it all down, but—I’m an artist, you know? Not an accountant. It might actually be a thousand. It might even be a bit more. But it should be the person loaning anyway to keep track of that, shouldn’t it? If she wants to be repaid, that is. How much did she say?”
This time, Livia just beamed proudly, without venturing to add a word. It was such a pity that her uncle took over the role of tour guide. John was as sensible as anyone to beauty, but the man's attitude showed he expected everyone to whip out a notebook and start jotting down dates and names. Even if they didn't all sound like tongue-twisters to him, the approach would have made all his passion fly out of the window - which got its own architect mentioned, too. Seriously? Unsurprisingly, all art students did just that.
“Besides, we didn’t meet that long ago, did we?” John added, hoping he’d somehow manage to stop this amazing, maddening man from being jailed in turn for sheer slander.
John rubbed the nape of his neck, but refused to let his eyes lower. "You're free not to believe that, but I am here to say sorry. I thought you were playing along. I mean, my name is John freaking Watson, I should have figured out that you weren't joking simply by how fed up you were. I've heard all the stupid quips and then some, what with being an army doctor, too. I just didn't think—"
....Apparently that was all they needed, because the hoplites turned around. Oh. If he'd known that any random sentence would have solved the problem, he'd have spouted something ages ago.
“What?” Gemma looked as if she had no idea what he was talking about. Good God, first day on the job?
…So the following morning saw John on a plane going to Ancona, Italy, naturally. There was a last minute offer that meant they almost paid him to go, and as for his room, once he actually landed he’d find something. Yes, it was a gamble, but he’d always liked betting anyway. Besides, it wasn’t as if he was picky about accommodations. Not after Afghanistan, and definitely not with the place he was living in at the moment. He kept telling himself that he wasn’t settled yet, but he knew that unless something unexpected happened there would be few chances to change his life around.
“Questioning,” his partner said, “She was killed by someone she knew. Even if the two coffee cups in the kitchen were old, which I don’t believe, as the residue would have dried further, the door wasn’t forced. Even in Italy, you don’t offer coffee to burglars.”
“Anyone who manages to throw themselves in has gone to so much effort that they probably did it out of sheer spite for the misapplied warning,” the journalist huffed, glaring at the plastic reinforcing and heightening its walls as if it personally offended him.
“And this is your first crime scene?” she asked, not moving to open the door. She sounded slightly breathy, which puzzled John a bit.
“Can we just go and solve this case before the crime scene is completely compromised?” Sherlock said, leading them upwards. John glanced at some more abstract art—was that bronze? Copper? Rust?—at the sides of the highest, white-plastered area, before they popped out of the tower. Not that it felt much like ‘out’, given they were hurrying under a portico.
Truth is, he has noticed. And oh, he's played pretend so many times, imagined John was actually enjoying his stories, while telling himself not to be stupid. That it couldn't happen. But – it did happen. All these reviews, these bookmarks...definitely too long and complex a work if it's all meant to be nothing more than a joke.
“JohnWatson,” Sherlock mumbled, all in a breath, facing the wall and its collection of Mitch’s earlier attempts at painting. Completely experimental, the artist himself would have said. Complete nonsense, their parents lamented.
“I have no preference whatsoever. I will not be catering to her wishes, anyway, and I don’t expect her to cater to mine,” the journalist replied, looking at the sign rather than either of his companions.
“If I’m accused, I’ll have to seek legal counsel before I answer any of that. But I’ll give you a free tip: knowing who the victim is might help me explain my relationship with her.” Seriously, who let this person in office? He supposed it was a question of seniority, as she did look to be at least in her late sixties, but idiotic people didn’t improve with age. They weren’t wine!
Sherlock snorted. “Thank God that sentence was a third conditional type, because I am not equipped to deal with insane people. Not in a medical sense, at least.”
His genius didn’t need it repeated, but allowed himself one Parthian shot. “And this confirms that you do.”
When John called the following morning, he was half-tempted not to answer at all. It was for the best to keep some distance. Why hurt and be hurt? The call kept ringing, though, and in the end the journalist answered, determined to tell him to learn to take a hint.
“About your brother—I honestly have never seen him, or talked to him, and I literally had only one text from him and didn’t even answer. So he has no idea that I’m even here, and frankly, I’m not even interested in why he sent it. I’m just happy, because you’re the most amazing man I’ve ever met. And yes, a bit grateful to him, because we wouldn’t both be here otherwise. If you can suggest a gift he’d appreciate, it’d be lovely.”
One of Livia’s friends, a short man of about twenty-five wearing a white shirt and shorts, snickered at this. Three glares turned on him. “I thought you were joking!” he protested.
“I just thought that simply getting the names is a boring job, and you don’t need to be involved. In fact, if you’d prefer sitting this one out—you’re not going to murder anyone in half an hour or so, are you?” she replied, grinning.
The current stressful situation called for some serious sweetening, so the journalist ordered a Marocchino: coffee, cream and cocoa powder. In short order, both of them received their cups and carried them to a table. They eyed each other’s choices with surprise. John’s black coffee could be a consequence of not knowing all the options, or their Italian names. But there was no justification, in Sherlock’s eyes, for avoiding any and all sweeteners; John couldn’t very well claim that he didn’t recognise a sugar packet. What kind of twisted man honestly enjoyed bitterness?
"Sparta, huh? Sure, they are good at fighting - have to be good at least at one thing, right? But you found us in seconds. Nobody's going to sneak on you, and that's great. And if you're equally equipped, there's no reason you can't kick their arses. You think you've been sent a hero to what? Win the war? Need a hero to deal with other soldiers? They're just people, aren't they?"
Oddly, once he abandoned the expected route to slip into the area reserved to offices, in order to track down his frustrating sibling, the chase ended. The guards didn’t seem to be concerned about anything happening beyond their area of competence. Either there were more men beyond these doors, or they didn’t care much for their superiors’ privacy.
“Last question, and then you’ll be able to rest. You made it obvious that her family isn't in need of money, but was she good at managing it? Did she often go into debt, or on the contrary, had she loaned money to anyone?”
With that, she walked away, and Sherlock promptly forgot about feeling awkward. Despite the menu listing the ingredients of each plate in English, too, John was asking his advice, as if he were an Italian cuisine expert. An admirer, yes. For a true connoisseur, they'd have to ask Mycroft...and he absolutely wasn't going to text his brother.
Nobody was home at the next suspect’s flat, and for a moment John hoped to every God out there that Sherlock’s resolution to make his name fit didn’t extend to becoming an expert at picking locks. Or if he had, that he wouldn’t deem this the perfect occasion to show off his prowess in that art, in order to snoop unimpeded. Thankfully, the sleuth decided to demand that Gemma fetch the house owner to have them open the door.
Once again, John experienced a little mishap, which prompted a Very Important Note to Self. Pepperoni gets you the veggie pizza. Also, feel free to devolve to pointing unless sure of what you’re saying, nobody will glare at you for being rude. He was surprised by the sheer size of the slice—it looked as if you could have used a whole pizza as a tablecloth—but the taste… Eating a pizza tablecloth didn’t sound like a bad option, if this was what you got.
Since the barwas on the other side of the square, though just out of sight, Sherlock loitered at the palace’s entrance, leaning on a corner and ignoring the few tourists that came in. Not just because it felt at least ten degrees cooler than outside. The chance to observe anyone without their knowledge was always more fruitful, and there was a fifty percent…no, more like sixty-six percent chance that he’d be able to examine John covertly. If his brother was interested in John enough to lead him on, obviously Mycroft knew something. Something Sherlock had missed; that was unprecedented.
Catching his eye, the old man finally caught his breath and roared, “Silence!” It echoed among the vaults, making even Gemma jump a bit.
“You won’t want one. Not when you spend more time with me. Hence why I agreed to this meeting. I need answers.”
John was tempted to clap. Misrepresenting the situation so completely without telling a single lie was a feat that he hadn't expected from her .
"About wanting coffee? About you being amazing?" Oh, there—the blush was back. Lovely. John caught himself smiling reflexively. "About my wanting to spend more time with you, and doing my best to make it enjoyable for you, too? Deadly serious. So help me God."
He kept quiet, simply enjoying the company of the friend (and future darling, if he had his way) at his side. At the museum, they bought their tickets (to the
“Oh, no. You’re thinking of politics, really? We aren’t in a book, you know. But if dad had talked mum out of Mycroft, there wouldn’t be a Sherlock, either.” The journalist crossed his arms.
True, everyone, from the most mindless thugs to the middle-grade bosses who insisted they had met the Colonel once (and who seemed to always have the wildest fancies), agreed that if you attracted the man's attention, you had two options...in case you were lucky. Bow to whatever orders he brought, or disappear from the very face of the earth. If you had disappointed Moriarty once too many, you'd never be found anymore.
As it was, despite obtaining what they’d come for in barely a minute since he took the reins, the agent thought necessary to both thank the man and extend her apologies—again, with many more words and emphatic gestures than necessary.
“They’ve accused you once already. I’m not about to let anyone stop me solving this, since apparently the people who are supposed to seem incapable of it. I’m not going to have
"There was never any plan, not really. But I did suddenly stop doing something, and you've noticed. More than once, actually. And you were concerned about it, and the bookmarks, John, and I...I thought I was more than a wank fantasy!" Just because someone enjoys something in fiction, it doesn't mean that they want it to break into their room. Sherlock knows that, of course. But still. John.
At Sherlock’s look of betrayal, he hurried to add, “Well, he has a point, you know. I’m sure you’re a great agent, but even you couldn’t solve a murder without so much as looking at the scene...especially if you weren’t given any documents on your colleagues’ findings.”
His Captain actually surrenders at that, both hands in the air, stammering "What?" and really, couldn't he find another word?
“Because I thought you’d be needed, but you’ve come too late to be of any use. I accepted the task of solving this on my own because the commissary is an idiot, and people in power famously choose only even more stupid people to surround themselves with.” Sherlock didn’t even look at him.
Yup, that was what he was anticipating...Sherlock’s brain. Not the fact that he looked like Guercino’s Saint Sebastian. Well, a Saint Sebastian that wasn’t mostly naked, more’s the pity, and not currently enduring a death sentence, which was nice. Though that wasn’t very obvious in the picture…Nope, it was. A Google search made it apparent that his memory had edited an arrow out of the painting, too busy concentrating on the rope-bound, twisted body. Oops.
She quieted again, for five interminable minutes, before saying, “Livia was going to have a brilliant career. Because of her family, you know. That means that anyone who knows her would envy her. But most of all, Sergio...well, he’s brilliant. But as much as everyone praises him, he doesn’t have enough connections to have the best chances at a career. Not the one he’d deserve, and he knows it. If you want a name besides everyone in our faculty.”
But the place looked...much wider than it should have been, for one. The man at the bright, indecipherable console, sporting a ridiculous mustache (worse than even John had dared at the height of his grief) and a condescending attitude, huffed, "You're late. Let's see what she's in the mood for, shall we?"
John kept pace. As always. “I’m starting to sense a pattern,” he said, once the door closed behind the two of them. “Is it me you want to avoid or are you not used to companions under 6 feet? I thought that you agreed to this meeting.”
“I have half a mind to throw you both into a cell for the crime of being annoying, but I doubt that would help. The president volunteered our suspects' addresses as well as their last names, so if you're so anxious we can visit the nearest one now. Viola Paoletti lives almost in front of Raffaello’s birthplace, so it’s about halfway the street we just took, and this time it’s downhill!” Gemma replied, for once leading them.
John Watson defied his self-image with a grin and impromptu praise…and it was terrifying. Because if the man wasn’t lying, then he'd misunderstood the source of all the hatred he'd welcomed. There was no evidence that his inspiration was despicable rather than exemplary. If Sherlock's imitation of his namesake wasn't to blame, he couldn’t even decry his mum and her taste in names for what he’d been through. Someone else would have accused everyone who’d ever been cruel to him, probably. But in his mind, if the hatred he elicited wasn’t because of “Sherlock”—it was him. Just him. Because John got the whole Sherlock experience…and loved it.
Gemma got behind the wheel, sighed and said, “As you wish. You haven’t seen her, though. I’d bet that she is innocent. But I suppose she could give you some useful info.”
Sherlock’s glare said what he thought of Mycroft’s hypocrisy. Rather than arguing more, he rose and left without a word.
,” the younger one snapped, his voice echoing much more loudly than he intended. He bit his lips. Mycroft trying to force him into behaving was a brotherly tradition.
Sherlock nodded, and strode through the square without waiting for him. Thank God it was only a few steps, because otherwise the heat would have got to him, and slowing down would have been so awkward.
“This is why I said you’re psychic. I just had an unexpected offer. What about a private tour of a Renaissance palace and art that people don’t usually get to see? With a special guide, too.”
"Sherlock, what in God's name are you up to?" John is still panting a bit (and isn't that doing things to him), but stern.
John sighed. He had hoped so much that the message meant that he was wanted, but of course that was demanding too much. The sheer fact that Sherlock hadn’t been the one texting him should have been all the hint he needed; the man was certainly not afraid to say what he thought. Coming here had been a stupid whim. Still, he refused to leave. They might never be friends—much less anything else—but it wasn’t a good reason to let one person determine what he did.
“It might be a bit much for me. I do know someone who’d fit right in, though. Maybe you wouldn’t mind including him in such a tour?” John replied.
His wandering thoughts were interrupted by, “For someone who wanted to make a nuisance of himself, you’re really quiet.”
"Or tea. Chamomile. Anything you like, but to be honest, you sound like you need a coffee, and I want to apologise properly. And chat more with you, I'll be upfront." John gave him his most winsome smile.
“Either things go your way or I lose my cool and throw you both in a cell, is that how you want to play?” Gemma said, then—much to John's shock—she downright guffawed. “You’re lucky that commissioner De Giovanni is even more aggravating than you are. Or maybe I’ve just had to deal with her for far longer,” she explained, once she had her breath under control. “I’m going to trust you again.”
“I’m sure the motive is one of these. People are ultimately boring. How everyone else doesn’t realise that much is the true mystery.” Sherlock shrugged.
John honestly didn’t expect to be called as a witness, but he could only nod. He gave a cursory examination of the body and the morgue, just to check that no procedure had been patently neglected, and nothing seemed out of place. . Nothing but Livia's body; she should never have been laying on a slab in the first place, except a steak knife and an unnamed bastard had disagreed.
It should be awkward; annoying; even appalling. He has enough common sense to know that. He hasn't dared to broach the subject with John, but he's sure all the same what the man's reaction would be. But for him? Every new story is just more fodder for his fantasies. Slipping from reading to writing was the most natural thing. After all, no story can be really as accurate as his own imagination.
How he kept himself from screaming, he wasn’t sure. He wanted to yell that he wasn’t a bloody Victorian detective, wasn’t wearing a deerstalker, and would she ask someone called Ulysses to prove his identity by coming up with the winning plans for a war? Then thought of John—and him—having to wait for these people to prove they were innocent, never mind catching the actual murderer. He might not be the world’s only consulting detective, but he had no doubt that he could do better than the whole police station combined. “You’re on,” he said. “And you included John all by yourself...so you obviously agree to releasing him into my care?”
The other girl, who’d kept drawing till then, ignoring the chatter around her, put aside her pencil to turn penetrating brown eyes on him. “Fun? Oh yes, we need it. Come on, I promise I won’t laugh…now.” The others nodded, too.
Nobody dared to interrupt the man’s soliloquy, of course. Not until his niece, in one of the rooms used as art storage, piped up, “Wait, where’s the Annunciazione I like so much? It was here the last time I came to see you.”
“Perfect, thank you. That helps a lot. Now, as far as you know, was there anyone who hated her, envied her, or otherwise wished her ill?”
“And here we have the frieze of the Art of War, by Francesco di Giorgio Martini,” Rachele said, sweeping her arm around, “Though it doesn’t contain just weapons, much of it is actually a triumph of human intellect and engineering, and some of these machines were probably used in civil life instead of war. See, here there’s a man with a plant in the background.”
He’d gone to check what happened, thinking maybe he could help. The flat’s door was wide open, and Livia’s body lay twisted across the hall’s floor, enough blood splatters around her to be sure his services as a doctor weren’t going to be required. A few policemen were flittering around, taking samples and photos. They yelled at him, asking—he assumed—his name and intent. Shit didn't really hit the fan, though, until the Professor himself appeared. The man noticed him before the body, and greeted him—with a different name than the one he’d just given to the police.
“If the director is opposed to false identities, wouldn’t he object to my introducing myself with a different name every time we meet?” Sherlock lay back.
John ran. There was no trace of Sherlock in the corridor. No wonder; with those legs and how quick he was walking the man could be outside the hospital right now. Still, he refused to leave the journalist believing he was just another mocking arsehole. He hoped that Sherlock would be vulnerable to the main flaw of his job—curiosity. Especially since the interview had been cut short by his own untimely appearance.
"We've always loved Greece," the Colonel hummed, tilting his chin towards a...well, an actual, walled city not so far under them. A temple shone in pride of place. "I'd say you're lucky to end here."
That was more than he expected. Perhaps she did retain some measure of common sense. Just what did she want? A call from their freaking ambassador?
A.N. If you hate how I formatted texting...honestly I do too, but I don't know what is the proper way,  how to make it distinct from italics for emphasis, and at least this way there should be no doubt about the sender. Someone please tell me what I should do?
"No." John's tone is...surprisingly forceful, which he really should know by now will only have the opposite effect. "You're not going to cyberstalk an unfortunate soul who has better things to do in real life than – post comments online."
“Do your worst.” He hoped that his companion wouldn’t notice the little shudder which went through him, issuing such a blanket statement. Even in a public place, and with the cop less than a yard from them, it felt like a risk.
Sherlock huffed. “Ridiculous.” He’d just found them a number of suspects. What more did the man want? Yes, he was supposed to solve the case, but no one else seemed to be doing anything at all. It was odd. He thought that John’s praise endeared the doctor to him, despite the man's frustrating stubbornness. Now that Gemma was the one complimenting him, though, he was certainly smug, but not nearly as thrilled as he had been. Had he just enjoyed the novelty of the experience, so that he lost much of his glee now that had worn off? He’d hoped that pleasure wouldn’t turn stale quite so quickly, but he should have known; he processed things much quicker than other people, after all.
Damn it. Why was his brain currently playing catch up to the world? It never used to. John was a threat to his mental acuity. He needed to solve this case quickly—and preferably, alone, if the agent would allow it—so that he could leave John behind. He’d leave Mycroft to enjoy the art (and share pomposities, which would amuse him no end) and go back home. Knowing his brother, he’d already warned their parents that their “baby” (even at 25, with a degree and a sort-of career) had managed to get himself involved in a murder. In fact, let’s hope that his brother didn’t explain the terms of his involvement, or mum might fly to watch her own Sherlock solve his first case, and he would really have to throw himself off a cliff then. She’d be pissed off that she didn’t have a front row seat for this, no doubt. But there had to be a limit to the insanity he could be asked to endure.
Sherlock sighed deeply. How many times had this happened? If he’d kept count, there would have been no space for anything else in his mind palace. He took his passport and threw it down on her desk.
“It’s not the same at all. I’ve stopped mum and her obsessions from controlling me, and the name change was part of that. You—well, I’ve never understood why you would do what you did, but you need to stop.” Sherlock opened his mouth, ready to protest, but Mycroft continued before he could so much as breathe, “I’ll support you, Locket, to the best of my abilities. But I expect you to let me do my job without interference.”
“Yes, of course, we do know it started there, if only from the choice of weapon. But any theory based on the evidence we found there would need a stronger support than these clues. It’s a students’ flat. Sure, there was a fibre caught in the back of one of the chairs, see?” the man said, showing them a sample. At a glance, all John could say was that the cloth was black and definitely not wool. From Luca’s attitude, that was about all he could tell, too. Fine, he might know the actual material. “But any lawyer worth his salt would insinuate that it could have been stuck there at any time. And even the cups left on the table could have been there for a day or two, for all we know. That is, assuming we find a match for the DNA on them. That will require at least a couple of weeks anyway,” the pathologist replied, “I’m sure doctor Watson will confirm this.”
"Yeah, I don't know what his parents were thinking either. Being obviously named after a fictional character…the poor bloke must have heard all the jokes you did and more. Off to apologise, go on. I'll still be here when you're done. Otherwise, you know where to find me," the paediatrician said.
Sherlock was almost tempted to back out. But they had an agreement—they’d shaken on it—and he would look ridiculous changing his mind now. If no one else was, he was supposed to be the professional and focused one in this endeavour. Perhaps, they’d learn something from him.
Sergio lived almost at the opposite end of town. He opened the door for them immediately at least; it would have been too awkward to miss two suspects in a row. “Sherlock?” he asked, still on threshold, after a moment of hesitation. The boy frowned, eyes moving from one to another of his unexpected visitors.
“Well, don’t blame me when you complain once again that your art lacks ‘punch,’ brother,” Sherlock replied.
John turned around, catching his gaze, but Sherlock refused to lower his own. He had nothing to feel guilty about. Judging from the grin that spread on the other man’s face, his surprise was without a hint of suspicion…Good thing for the country that the man wasn’t in MI6.
"I'm a freelance at the moment, but I don't doubt that many newspapers, on and offline, will be interested in such an article," Holmes said smoothly, waving Misha's confusion away.
People ignored him, and he easily located the labs. With everyone worried about exams, the place was empty—supposed to be locked, in fact. Sherlock had never been happier of having acquired the full set of his namesake’s skills.
Sherlock groaned. Why had he ever thought that following Mycroft (always Mycroft when he was angry) was a good idea? Leaving London was the right call, of course. He couldn’t stay and risk caving to John bloody Watson’s smile. But Italy in the summer? He’d melt. Couldn’t his brother have a job somewhere with a beach? Or failing that, on a proper mountain, preferably near a glacier?
The tea feels so timely, now. A few sips ease his dry mouth. He just needs a moment to get himself reined back in and out of his daydreaming. After all, there's not going to be anymore writing today. Not with John hovering. If Sherlock had respected boundaries first, maybe he wouldn't have to fear a glance to whatever he's busying himself with. But invading John's personal space (and his privacy) under the justification of natural inquisitiveness is one of the few ways he has to feed his baser instincts. He has never even considered stopping himself. Not when, after surprisingly few lectures, John has caved in, as he has to so many other quirks of his flatmate's, and apparently decided that a minimum of reciprocation is all he wants.
Starting at all was a bad idea, really. But he's had worse vices. Anyone Googles himself, right? But not anyone finds RPF fics of himself. He has John's blog to thank for that, mainly; the media wouldn't have come sniffing if they didn't have a fanbase already. How so many people figured out that he's in love with his flatmate is the true mystery. Sure, there are all the Y/N and the occasional Lestrade or...anyone else he's been semi-publicly in contact with, really. But the majority has deduced johnlock long ago.
John sighed, and waved. “I’m not going to run, I swear. Go get him...or at least make sure he’s rooting through the life of the right flatmate.”
“Rooms? In different directions? Does it mean you’re not...” Gemma looked from the one to the other, as if she couldn’t conceive that the two of them lived separately.
This time, the text was immediate. Actually, a text barrage that gave him no time to interject even a ‘fuck you’.
Sherlock knew this was a bad idea. They'd probably fall into the Thames and then...then again, that might shock the hallucination out of their systems. Not pleasant, but there were worse options. The Colonel (assuming it was him, and present) walked right to them and then past, without attempting to even touch them, John's gun following him but no attempt to tackle him made. Probably his beloved had figured that leaving a contaminated atmosphere would be best for everyone, too.
His brother had a brain, he might as well use it. Sherlock couldn’t say out loud what happened. That would have made it true…and it couldn’t be. Not unless he’d stumbled into a candid camera show, but a hospital was hardly the place for such a thing, was it?
Before John could even think of taking out his phone, much less take a proper photo—or a dozen—the road curved and it was out of sight. It was strangely fitting for Sherlock to take refuge here, he thought, smiling to himself. Elegant, tall, breath-taking beauty, enchanting you and disappearing before you could do anything about it? It was a perfect description of their relationship. Maybe Sherlock was the spirit of this place. It would explain a few things. The obviously fake name, the sudden flight…the man wouldn’t make a poor impression in a Raffaello painting, dressed in a doublet. John chuckled mentally, and told himself sternly to cut it (out) with the bad poetry. It was the only way to be sure that such ridiculous fantasies wouldn’t slip out once he found the man in question. Even if he appreciated art, the former soldier doubted that anyone would enjoy being told he looked like a ghost.
“Good. A nurse will be in with the soft cast and then we’ll get your discharge paperwork ready. You’ll be out of here within the hour. I want to give you some pain pills because it’s going to hurt quite a bit over the next few days, but I understand you a have a substance abuse history?”
“I can wait for you at the car if you’d like some time to yourself.” His friend whirled around, displaced anger distorted his features.
“And I never thought I’d have a husband. Life is funny like that. The things you don’t expect, the things you were never looking for, turn out to be the best things in your life.”
“Your deduction skills are improving,” he teased, “Yes, it was The Queen, himself. He was giving me a progress report on the flat. They’ll be cleaning all day tomorrow and it will be livable starting tomorrow night.” The fleeting disappointment was barely discernable on Sherlock’s face, before he quickly wiped it clean with the standard mask of indifference. John had been mid-sip of wine and gulped audibly.
The next morning, John had a shift at the surgery, so they were all up early. John left before Sherlock did, Rosie packed up and on his hip.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“More?” It was meant to be a bold statement, but sounded like a question. He meant to look cocky and confident, but looked vulnerable. With rough, competent physician-palms, John framed Sherlock’s face, forcing his face upward, his gaze catching and holding.
“Always,” Sherlock responded, before pulling John to him, kissing him with passion that left them both unsteady and took him to bed.
“Why him?” John asked, his voice rough, “Do you ever wonder why certain people die and others don’t? I mean—a man with a family, with small children, who is so needed, dies so needlessly. Whereas I had no one, but I was spared. Why? Why did I survive? How does that make any sense?” Sherlock turned to him, his question feeling like a knee to his gut. He pierced John with the urgency of his gaze as he said,
“Thanks,“ he whispered back. After a sigh, “I think I’m going to bed early.” John stared at him. You could have etched the doctor’s worry lines on his forehead in stone.
I woke with a startle, my back pressed against a hard surface, heart pounding out the rhythm of fear in my chest, arms wound around my knees, a feeble defense, shivering. I was instantly on high alert. Fuck, had I fallen asleep and missed the target? I squinted into the tomb-like darkness, but all I could discern was…a bed and a dresser? Explosively, I released a half-sob of relief,  feeling my bedroom wall press against the back of my head and inhaling deeply, allowing the sensations of Baker Street to assuage my slowly ebbing fear, washing it away with a tide of familiarity. I’m home. Tension leaves me in several huge exhales and I will my muscles to relax and my shoulders to ease back into a more natural pose. I hadn’t woken like this in over a year. I used to jolt awake in terror on a regular basis--thrashing in bed, rolling off the bed, curled in the corner as I was now, sometimes inside the closet. In the excruciating months after Mary died, when John had shunned me, and the following months in which our relationship had been under tentative repair, I had chosen to engage in psychotherapy. If or when (I had desperately hoped for the when) John moved back in, I didn’t want to be plagued by nightmares and trauma. I had wanted a fresh start. I wanted to move forward into a new life as the new and improved Sherlock Holmes. And the plan had been successful, for the most part. My best friend and his daughter were asleep upstairs and my nightmares were now rare. So, why am I in the corner of my bedroom shivering and gasping for air in the frigid night? Frigid. My brain was clearly not working at full capacity. It was FRIGID in the flat. I must’ve been out of my bed for some time to be shivering this hard. Why could I see my breath inside our home?
“But then,” I say gently, “ You wouldn’t have Rosie and that would be…unacceptable.” John’s face crumpled before reassembling as he continued to squeeze my hand in his and said shakily,
Sherlock was the next to wake, mid-morning light shafting through the blinds. He felt the heat against his back and the arm anchoring him. His breathing quickened with the awareness that John had either consciously or unconsciously pulled him close and he smiled into the pillow. Knowing the tumult that the next days were going to bring, he took this moment for himself. He shored up the strength and stability that John gave him and coveted it away for the coming days. He was able to stave off the chaos of his thoughts for another few minutes and breath in John’s scent, to allow it to permeate his thoughts like curls of smoke, drifting around and through, obscuring his pain. Now, feeling at least somewhat fortified, he pulled away from John and climbed out of bed to face his demons.
“Some. They gave me something for it. Don’t worry,“ he said quickly, opening his eyes to meet his friend’s. “Lestrade knows about it and they won’t give me anything to go home with.” John shook his head,
“Stop it,” John interrupted. “I’ve been through this, Sherlock. I still deal with it at times. It’s not easy, so don’t be hard on yourself about it.” The detective abandoned his assault on his scalp and closed his eyes, willing his breath to come slowly and evenly. John did the same, waiting. He would never be able to sleep knowing that his friend lay awake, miserable. After an eternal nine minutes, the detective abruptly turned to his side, his back to John.
The ache in John’s shoulder frequently woke him after a few hours and forced him to roll over and sleep on his other side. This observation was validated by years of studying his sleep patterns—on the couch, hotel beds, his own bed in Baker Street. The double blankets were heavy and soothing on top of us and he turned over carefully, preventing the cold room air from infiltrating our cocoon. In his half-asleep state, he had completely forgotten that I had joined him until we were face to face. I blinked sleepily at him in the darkness, only half awake myself. John inhaled slowly with a soft smile and said in a nearly inaudible whisper,
“I’ll help with that,” John interjected. “Give them to me and I’ll administer them. I’m a physician and his….his flatmate. I won’t let him overuse them” The doctor nodded, handing the prescription to John and bidding them farewell.
The tantalizing aromas of a fry-up and coffee drew the detective from his slumber and into the kitchen. Rosie was happily shoving eggs around on her plate in her high chair while her father was just plating their breakfasts. He turned from the stove, with the plates in hand and stopped short with a warm smile for the sleep-mussed detective leaning against the doorway.
“Can’t sleep, either, then?” Unsurprisingly, Sherlock didn’t answer, didn’t look up, head still tucked into his arms which were wrapped around his knees, impossibly flexible for a grown man.
Rosie! Despite my still spasming muscles, I moved quickly to the hall closet, extracted our extra blanket and vaulted up the stairs. I very quietly eased open the door to John and Rosie’s room, trying not to wake either of the snoring Watsons. I was relieved to find that it was slightly warmer in John’s room than it had been in my own. Gently, I placed the soft blue fleece over the sleeping two year old, tucking it in around her feet. I leaned over and tenderly kissed her head, warm against my lips, sparsely covered with fine blonde hair, and I worried about her cold ears. Should I try to slip a hat over her head? That would wake her and if she was sound asleep, she couldn’t be very uncomfortable. Unsure of what to do and not wanting to risk her falling ill, I gingerly sat at the edge of the John’s bed and placed a hand on his shoulder to wake him.
“To raising the conversation about long term plans. I was going to ask if you minded if….” He pulled his hand from Sherlock’s and raked it over the back of his neck anxiously. Sherlock stopped walking and looked curiously at him.
Faint early light filtered through the gauzy sitting room curtains. John sighed, pulling the warmth against his chest closer. A deep sound against his chest startled him out of his sleepy state and he became aware of his best friend pressed against him. A smile pushed its way onto his face as he deeply inhaled the very familiar scent of lavender and musk shampoo and cigarettes. The ache and stiffness in his neck, however, elicited a moan.
“What was the worst?” John asked quietly, his voice tinged with fear for what his best friend would say next.
“I’m glad you weren’t,“ he said somewhat harshly, his sharp gaze grazing the shadowed planes of John’s face.  “I was captured many times, tortured, beaten, left to die. I was so alone for so very long.” He trailed off, lost in a memory just over John’s left shoulder, the desolate look on his face gnawed at John’s gut.
“Yeah, he said you can’t sleep and you won’t accept any help,” John said, busying himself in the kitchen with tea.
Sherlock looked up from the microscope briefly before returning his gaze to his specimen, “You had a long day at the surgery and preferred to retire here.”
“Tindall was in there with him, but Sherlock had just gotten the perp to confess and Tindall knocked on the window to make sure someone got it on record. When no one came in, Tindall decided to step out for a second to see if anyone was still standing at the window and the perp took that lapse to swing his chair.” John’s entire body vibrated with tension, fists clenched. He was irate,
“Do you think….I mean, would it help if….what if Rosie and I just stay. Here. With you. All of us, together, I mean.” John winced at his own stuttering statements. He had meant to propose it much more coherently. What was wrong with him, anyway? “What I mean to say,” he swallowed and started again, slowly, “is can Rosie and I move in?” Sherlock was frozen, coffee cup halfway to his lips, similar to the way he had stood in the living room the night prior. Anxiety crashed over John and he rushed ahead, focusing on his toast. “If not, it’s OK, it’s all fine, our flat is fine, actually—“
The air had a dense, slow-motion quality. He watched in horror as Sherlock slowly placed the muzzle of the gun beneath his chin. “No!” John shouted in his dream, his stomach dropping and his breath halting. He couldn’t bear to watch him die again. His closest friend.  In agony and disbelief, he watched Sherlock pull the trigger…
“Oh,” Sherlock breathed, weak with relief and leaning into John, wrapping around him, wrapping himself in him, allowing him to fill in all the fault lines. “I thought maybe it was too--“
“Would you, um—“ he broke off to clear his throat, his gaze focused on Rosie. “Um, watch her, I need a minute.” The scrape of his chair on the floor sliced through the sudden silence and he was on the staircase to his room before Sherlock could open his mouth to respond. Sherlock filled his lungs, swallowed some coffee and reached for the letter on the table. After his suspicions were confirmed, he thought for a moment. He wasn’t sure whether John would want time alone or whether he needed to talk. John was better at knowing these kinds of things than he was. His heart, however, compelled him to go to his friend. Rosie kicked her legs as he lifted her from her chair and scooped up her toast and baby food. He knocked on Mrs. Hudson’s door and found her delighted to watch Rosie for a little while.
“Somehow, this event has brought us closer. All of us, as a family, but especially the two of us. I was angry with him at first. I’m still somewhat angry, but I understand why he did it—why he lied about her, lied to me about Trevor, locked her away. He bore a huge burden for the entire family, all on his own. I know well how lonely that experience can be. I wish he hadn’t had to go through it—I wish a lot of things had happened differently, but we can’t change the past. I was too young when it all happened—I was unusually intelligent, but I didn’t have the emotional maturity to deal with the thing that is my sister and her cruelty. Mycroft was trying to protect me. Like he always has. I choose to stand by him now.” John listened with wide eyes. He wasn’t used to such emotional insights coming from Sherlock, nor such lengthy commentary on his family. He was once again impressed by his friend’s capacity for forgiveness and understanding. He shook his head and sighed.
“Color!” John set her on the floor with her extra-large crayons while he cleared the table with Sherlock’s help.
“Blue. Can you say blue, Rosie? That’s a blue cup.“ She babbled and threw the cup with a tremendous amount of force at the legs of the kitchen table. “Alright, then,” John laughed, “maybe not your favorite color?” Rosie then squealed and pointed into the sitting room. “Hmmm? What is it, love?” John was distracted as he removed the meat from the burner and turned off the stove. He poked his head around the corner to find Sherlock standing very still in the sitting room, still holding his violin case, with an indescribable expression frozen on his features. John looked at him with concern, “You alright there, Sherlock?” He stepped closer and noted the weariness in his friend’s face.
“The probability of that was negligible. The probability of you becoming irritable due to hunger, on the other hand, was much higher. Statistically speaking, our evening was more likely to have a positive outcome based on the earlier arrival of food that you would most likely eat.”
“Alright, yes, it’s a proposal. I had no intention of proposing to you 5 minutes ago, but that doesn’t make any less sincere. Because there’s nothing I want more. Just you and me and Rosie until the end of our days.”
“Hey,” he said, touching Sherlock’s arm, grounding him in the present. Sherlock shook his head, clearing cobwebbed memories, finding John’s eyes again. He had never spoken to anyone of that time and he spoke now with an undercurrent of urgency,
“How many times am I going to have to watch you die?” he gasped between the repressed sobs that ripped from his chest.
“John,” Sherlock choked, his breath coming quickly as he fought tears and the deep aching need to hold his best friend. “Stay,” he pleaded. “Stay here, with Rosie. Don’t go back to your flat.” He quickly swiped his hand over his eyes and when he looked up, John’s eyes were ablaze with love and joy.
“Aren’t we all? But this is serious. If this fracture isn’t permitted to heal, you could end up needing surgery later and you may never hold a bow properly again.” Sherlock blinked, gave John a concerned look, and nodded.
“John,” he rasped. He was unable to articulate anything beyond that. He was holding on to John as if he were a life raft. John’s hand crept up to the back of his friend’s neck.
“Never,” John whispered, as he lifted a hand and rested it against Sherlock’s back. Sherlock now turned and met John’s worried expression with a wan curve of his lips.
“You too.” He then tugged anxiously on the bottom if his jacket, flexed and opened his right hand and gave a firm nod, as if mentally preparing himself for battle. “Alright,” he said.  “Let’s go.”
“I’m glad you ate something.  Now, close your eyes.” In a rare event, Sherlock did exactly as he asked.  Beneath the doctor’s gentle touch, he let go.
“I’ll come, too,” said John, not missing the subtle invitation. “I’ll go through it with you. Some things might even be mine.” Sherlock glanced at him gratefully. “Let me know when you’re going over there. Is Mrs. Hudson back in yet? Did she have as much damage?” Sherlock shook his head,
“Do I look ok?” Asked Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, with uncertainty in his voice.
“Hmm,” Sherlock said with a smile. “He doesn’t truly wish to see me hurt. He really didn’t have a full appreciation for how….” Sherlock swallowed, looking away before finishing, “how much Serbia had affected me. He extracted me, had medical care araranged for me and then I returned to Baker Street immediately. He didn’t see the…non-physical consequences. I thought I effectively concealed that from everybody. I didn’t know that you were aware of my dreams,” he admitted quietly, gazing at a family of ducks waddling to the lake.
“Ready for bed?” he asked John. The doctor was unable to tear his gaze away, though he felt his body flood with warmth the longer they stood there.
“I think while you’re at Sherrinford tomorrow, I’ll bring over some clothes for Rosie and me to keep here. If you’re ok with that?” John asked without turning.
“No,“ Sherlock said, his voice raspy when he recovered his ability to speak. “Don’t apologize. The two of us have done far too much of that.” He pulled away to look into John’s eyes…into his heart. “It’s fine. It’s all fine.” John gazed at him for a long time before saying,
John took it from him thoughtlessly, as he placed a sippy cup of milk on Rosie’s tray, wrinkling his nose and making a silly face at her as he slid his finger into the envelope. Sherlock observed, leery, as John read the contents. His own heart sank as he watched his friend’s face fall into lines of sorrow. The doctor took a deep, shaky breath, shoulders slumped, as he placed the letter on the table. He appeared distracted, quietly working to control his inner turmoil.
“Yes, it’s what I want John. More than anything. We’ll make it safe for Rosie. I’ll get a separate fridge for body parts, I can rent 221c for experiments, and no more shooting the wall. She’ll be safe, John, I would never allow her to be in danger.” Sherlock’s eyes were wide and earnest. He had clearly put some thought into this. John’s breath hitched in his chest and he reached for his friend’s hand, interlacing their fingers.
“S’alright, mate,” Lestrade’s still wore an expression of guilt, in addition to understanding. “I’m sorry, too.  John, you know I wouldn’t want anything to happen to him, either.” He met Sherlock’s eyes for a moment and left the room.
“Good.” John’s eyelids drifted shut while his hand remained affixed to Sherlock’s arm. The detective whispered,
“John, shhhhhh, John, wake up. You’re safe, you’re dreaming.” John moaned Sherlock’s name, and the detective wasn’t sure if he had been dreaming about him or if he was acknowledging his presence. Sherlock began to run his hands down John’s arms, holding him gently. John woke with a start, shaking and sweating.
“Yeah, of course, Sherlock. Always. You’re her Godfather, my closest friend. That’s what I want, too. Why are you thinking about this?”
“Oh, not that long,” Sherlock interjected. John heard another bone-deep sigh, “I’ll talk to you or text you tomorrow.” It was more tentative than a statement, so John was quick to respond.
They texted each other sporadically over the next few days, and occasionally spoke at night, usually late, after Rosie was asleep. Although Sherlock had always preferred to text, after the first night they spoke, he found there was something comforting about hearing John’s voice. The day of John’s confession at Baker Street, when Sherlock held him while he sobbed, they had broken through the ice they had been skating on for so long. They talked more, they were more open with each other. It was an unspoken commitment to repair and improve what they had. The phone lent anonymity—a layer of protection, that allowed them to discuss things that were too intense to talk about face to face. Sherlock and his family had spent quite a bit of time with Euros at Sherrinford. John knew it was draining his friend and he suspected he was going to need a break. On the fifth night, after not hearing from Sherlock all day and feeling a niggle of worry in his gut, he received a call from Mycroft.
“Yes, I’m ok, John, I’m right here,” his voice was now soft and a little broken. “Nightmare?”  Despite his monumental efforts, the doctor was unable to alter the typical progression of his nightmare resolution. They always ended with tears. Always. He was powerless to prevent it.
“There is nothing—“ Sherlock’s words rumbled into his mouth “—to be sorry for.” And he continued to delve again and again into the doctor’s mouth, tangling their tongues, learning the inside of his mouth, grasping the back of his skull with his long, pale fingers, sending white-hot bolts of electricity down John’s sternum, straight to his core, leaving him breathless-gasping and devoid of reason. Finally, remembering where they were, John pulled back just a hair.
“No, “ John shook his head resolutely. “You did what you had to do today, Sherlock. There’s nothing you need to apologize for and nothing you could’ve done differently. You were given no options.” He sighed, looking tired and ten years older. “Let’s just get some rest, Sherlock.”
Once back at the house, John had to pay the babysitter. Rosie was already asleep in her room. John offered Sherlock the first shower while he made some tea. He dug out an old shirt and boxers for Sherlock to wear and slipped into the shower himself, after placing a hot mug into Sherlock’s tremulous hands. Sherlock had been quiet thus far and John assumed that his friend had a great deal to sort through. Sherlock would talk when he felt ready. John toweled his hair, feeling fresh but still tired, despite his nap in the car. When he walked into the kitchen, he was greeted by the sight of his best friend leaning over the counter, shoulders shaking in an attempt to contain his sorrow. It was inevitable. Everyone has their breaking point.
Sherlock’s voice was low enough that John could almost feel the rumble in his chest. “It’s alright, I understand.” They reached the peak of a small hill in the cemetery. The sun was warm and butterflies flitted between graves. The scene was incongruously bucolic.
“So much violence, John. I killed so many people while I was gone. Bombs and guns and knives and garrotes.” Remorse deadened his tone.
“Okay, okay. I’m here. I’ve got you.” His own grief was too much to contain and tears leaked from John’s eyes. He felt long fingers clutch him desperately and the detective shook. John leaned back against the arm of the couch, drawing Sherlock against his chest and pushing their legs onto the end of the couch. The tears persisted for ages—John could not have guessed at how long they remained on the couch clasping one another as he caressed his friend’s curls and whispered to him. Eventually, Sherlock settled, exhausted, and dozed intermittently in John’s arms. The doctor’s own eyelids drooped and he reached over the back of the couch, pulling a throw over both of them as he drifted.
“Good. Because we’re a family now. And Rosie needs you…I need you,” he added softly. He pulled back, feeling timid yet boldly looking into the detective’s sea-blue-green gaze, needing him to understand the depth of what he was saying—of what he was feeling. He saw love mirrored back at him and without his mind’s permission, his hands were on either side of his best friend’s face and their lips were pressed together, plush-warm-dizzy. He felt Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath and he froze, pulling away, mumbling,
“If our current arrangement became permanent. If….if Rosie and I could just stay at Baker Street. I have---hm” abruptly, John cleared his throat, averting his gaze back to the park they just left. “We have everything we need. I have no plans to look for other arrangements…..or other relationships.” He added the last in a quick mumble, cursing the heat he felt rising in his cheeks.
“What’s happening here?” His instinctive gut reaction to the fear in Sherlock’s expression made his own tone guarded and terse.
“No, you’ve heard the term ‘sleeps like a baby’?” John whispered with a smile. Sherlock nodded and closed his eyes, sighing deeply. The air in the room stilled expectantly.
“Get up or you’re going to miss breakfast,” he called as he headed down the stairs. John laid back in bed for another moment, marveling at his life. He never thought he’d feel this happy to wake with his daughter and his best friend.
The near empty space was so quiet that Sherlock’s voice echoed. The guide turned away from the exhibit, walking briskly back to the desk. She searched around the desk until she found another book.
A wave of relief flushed over Clara’s face. “…I don’t know what…to say…my goodness…thank you, Mr. Holmes.”
“That day on the platform…” Sherlock stepped toward John, “I knew something was the matter as soon as we said our goodbyes…”
Detective Baynes laughed again as he pushed himself away from the machine. He waited before walking toward John, causing John to step back again. There was still quite a significant amount of space between the two men, but the revelation that Detective Baynes had murdered his colleague made John feel claustrophobic.
John stared at the shear amount of items Sherlock had brought out with him to attach to their automobile.
Moriarty rolled his eyes. “He’s only been out of prison for a day. Surely you can look past some personality quirks to get your job done.” He then rose from his chair to head to the door.
John reached over to wake Sherlock who was snoring loudly. “Holmes. Wake up. Something’s the matter with Mrs. Hudson.”
“Watson.” He called as he walked up to the cell, trying to keep it together in front of his brother and the officers on guard.
“There’s also an opium den that distributes the same vials.” Sherlock continued, “there’s a reason why Carberry was murdered and whomever had him murdered is using Watson to cover their tracks.”
“I do believe that Mrs. Hudson has graciously prepared our meal for us already.” John commented as he followed Sherlock up the stairs. He walked ahead of Sherlock to open the door to their sitting room, smiling widely.
The man laughed awkwardly as he waved his hands around. “Of course, we can handle the chemist! We’ll have the doses ready for the event.”
Mycroft placed a telegram on top of the page Sherlock was reading. “This was just sent by Inspector Lestrade. Looks important.”
John gasped as he reviewed the case file. “The judge presiding over this case is the same one for all these other cases.”
“Of course, Sherly…” Mycroft squinted his eyes again as if he were trying to decipher his brother’s demeanor, “I think that’s a wonderful idea as well.”
“Let me know if you need anything else.” The guide offered before walking away from the desk to inspect a small exhibit displayed in the hallway.
Mycroft made a noise of disbelief, but Sherlock ignored him as he continued to search around the body of the priest.
“But…John told me that he lost this months ago—” He tossed the bag back on Lestrade’s desk before placing his hands on the edge to lean forward, “Dr. Carberry
Extremely confused by his companion’s behavior, but told himself that he shouldn’t be, John sighed as he got up from the bed to follow Sherlock. He found Sherlock opening the door to reveal one of the neighborhood children who led what Sherlock affectionally referred to as the “Baker Street Irregulars.”
After exiting the house, they walked down one of the paths and pass the tombstones until they came upon the carriage house which was not too far away from the main house. John stopped in front of the small building, but Sherlock proceeded inside.
Mr. McArthur turned back toward the group, rubbing his hands with delight. “Well! We shall have an exciting dinner indeed tonight.”
“So,” John began as their engine sputtered with the ignition, “where in the country are we staying? An inn, perhaps?”
“Lestrade.” Detective Baynes coolly greeted as if they weren’t standing in front of a ruined heap of a house.
William shook his head. “Before I stopped working with Standish, he told me that working with that company would be beneficial. I had no idea what he was doing!” William, at this point had shoved Mamhud away from him.
On the desk in front of him were a few newspaper headlines detailing profile cases solved by Sherlock Holmes and his ever-faithful companion Dr. John Watson.
“Holmes!” John managed in a whisper. He tried reaching for Sherlock to keep him under the cover, but Sherlock was already on his way out from underneath.
“Holmes,” John stepped forward, ignoring Sherlock’s command to remain quiet and undetected, “I think I see someone in the mill.”
Sherlock hummed to himself as he continued searching amongst some orchids, stopping for a second to inspect the stem to one before yanking it forcefully from the root.
A woman and a man were looking outside a window out onto a well-manicured cemetery barely illuminated by the night sky.
A section of the bookcase as wide as a door swung open slowly to reveal a set of stairs descending downward. Moriarty walked onto the landing as the bookcase closed behind him. He walked down the stairs and through an old, reinforced tunnel that once led to the underground maintenance and service areas that had been recently moved above ground for safety reasons.
John entered the office after Sherlock, looking behind himself to make sure no one had come in to find that they had broken into the office. However, it was too late to protest; he already knew what he was getting himself into.
A horrible smell wafted its way through John’s otherwise unsurprisingly restless slumber, forcing him awake.
Mr. McArthur looked at his lapel before looking back at Madame Loire. “But…but…why…? I don’t understand.”
The heiress gasped once more, clenching her pearls in her hand and against her chest. “Why, Mr. Holmes! You’re brilliant!”
“Dr. Moriarty,” One of the house maids greeted Moriarty as soon as he emerged from the cellar, “your room is ready.”
Sherlock shed his waistcoat. “It was only a joke, albeit not very funny, but only a joke nonetheless.”
“Proceed with caution. We also have reason to believe that the doctor and Mr. Holmes are working with Dr. Schuller who also escaped from Westgate. Dr. Schuller is widely known for his poisonings. I don’t think it’s a great leap to assume that the Carberry case and Dr. Schuller’s past are linked.”
“H.S.…there’s something here about Carberry working with someone called H.S.…how could the police miss this?” Sherlock mused aloud.
to a child in need—graduates from the University of London are known for their generous charity—Saxon then returned the paintings he had stolen to the police this morning before coming here…”
“Mrs. Hudson, be a dear and fetch us some tea.” Mycroft asked as politely as his personality allowed.
Sherlock tried to brush Mycroft’s hand away but he unanticipated his brother’s strength who practically dragged him to the entrance of the chapel. But before they could leave, they heard voices down the hallway.
Sherlock chuckled as he sat back in his chair. “You would be amazed, my dear Watson, at what some people are capable of doing in order to hold onto power. Whitehall has his eyes on the Prime Minister.”
John lingered in the automobile, debating whether he should just drive off and cut his losses. Stanley took his time approaching, bowing slowly as soon as he reached John.
As soon as both guards realized that one of the guests was indeed Sherlock Holmes, both men’s expressions lit up, showing enough youthful curiosity that almost drowned out the dankest of the surroundings.
“Dr. Hans Schuller, Dr. Watson. We needed him and your colleague, Dr. Carberry, was in the way. He was working on something that posed a challenge.”
Saxon barely acknowledged him as he continued to struggle before he was dragged out of the room. Soon after, Sherlock walked to the middle of the study; from the look on Sherlock’s face, John knew full well that they were about to hear Sherlock’s grand revelation concerning the case.
Mycroft nodded slowly before slapping one of the armrest on his chair. “Right, Sherly! Let’s wash up for dinner then,” he jumped up from the chair before walking to the guest bedroom, “also I need to get back at you for beating my score from last night.”
Mycroft leered at Sherlock before he relaxed his face. “Yes, dear brother. You must be aware of his dealings in parliament.”
The scruffy man was wearing a cap that almost shielded both eyes. His expression made Lestrade grimace for a second until he realized that something was unsettling about this person.
As they entered, they found an elegant looking woman playing a reed organ in the back corner, seemingly unaware that she now had an audience. Sherlock and John watched her play for some time before she suddenly stopped and turned, gasping out loud in fright from the disturbance.
“Fine. But please keep it down. And if he’s not here within fifteen minutes, you’ll have to leave. I do have other tenants to mind.”
Several long moments passed as the air around Sherlock and John grew quieter and darker. Eventually, both men picked up on an exceedingly disturbing part of the conversation: one of the men inside began to brag about a recent “job” he had carried out, and the police still hadn’t picked up on the trail.
Sherlock nodded as the woman stepped to the side to let them in. She pointed down the hallway in direction of Henry’s room. Sherlock and John walked down the hallway stopping at the door before the woman disappeared out of sight into her own room.
John looked at Sherlock before looking back at Mycroft, baffled as to why Mycroft had not only separated him and Sherlock, but put him in one of the least nice rooms on the first floor after having dragged their suitcases upstairs.
Madame Loire stared at Sherlock before shaking her head quickly. “No…we…haven’t spoken for some time…” She looked around the room, “please excuse me, Monsieur.”
Detective Baynes eyed John as he sat back in his chair. He tapped his fingers on the desk before cupping both hands in his lap.
Sherlock ignored Mycroft as he slid against the wall, peeking in through windows before finding a window that looked into Dr. Carberry’s study. Sherlock tried to carefully jimmy the lock to the window, but he struggled as he was still too upset about John.
“I had reasoned with him before. As a doctor, I could not allow him to continue, but he pushed me to my limits the last we spoke—”
“I’m inclined to agree with the inspector, my dear brother,” Mycroft effortlessly added, “let’s say our goodbyes to Dr. Watson and let the police sort this business out.”
“Uh,” John looked at the man before looking back at Mrs. Hudson who was now surrounded by more police officers, “yes. May I ask what is the matter?”
“Perhaps,” Sherlock began as he stared out the window, “he was led here under false pretense.” He then turned quickly, sprinting toward John before grabbing him by the elbow.
“I’ve been meaning to confess that I am quite the fan of your detective work. A colleague of mine has been following your exploits to do research on a detective character for an upcoming play.”
Moriarty chuckled to himself as he got up from his desk to walk over to one of his bookshelves. He search for a few seconds until he found one of his older patient journals that contained his detailed notes on cases he serviced while teaching at the University.
And right on his fashionably late cue, the door leading into the cellar from Moriarty’s office opened wide, revealing the academic who was still wearing his teaching regalia.
And again, one more cough from the speaker’s unrelenting interrupter, but this time the speaker stopped his lecture as the restlessness in the audience brought on by the persistent cough became intolerable.
Sherlock smiled as he patted Wiggins on the shoulder. “You’ve already done more than enough for me on this case, but if something happens at the den, it’ll be easier for me to get out of the situation.”
Sherlock took a moment before turning around to face John directly. “You remember your medical conference from the beginning of the year.” He stated as a matter of fact.
John made a face at the word “we”, but a spark of memory flashed, interrupting that thought process as John instantly recognized what Detective Baynes was referring to.
Sherlock shook his head before heading toward the door. “All right, are we ready to leave, Mr. Wiggins?”
“What!” Mr. McArthur shouted, “I knew I needed better locks.” He attempted to sit up straight in his chair, but he slumped to the side.
John stared back Sherlock as if he didn’t understand what his companion was referring to. He took a moment before nodding back finally, rising slowly from the chair as he followed Sherlock out of the parlor, down the hallway, up the stairs, down another hallway until they reached the room Mycroft had Stanley lay out for them.
“Now,” Sherlock interlaced his hands together, “what was your relationship like with Standish? You must have known him through working in the government.”
John nodded, although he was annoyed with having been reminded of the little time they had to catch the thief. He turned to face the board as Sherlock limped to the fireplace to retrieve his smoking pipe.
John’s face drew a blank; he nodded as he stared back at Sherlock, both strangely grateful for not staying another night in Westgate, but also equally perplexed by why his companion would now put himself in danger.
Sherlock’s mouth dropped as he shuffled underneath John to sit up on his elbows. “Watson, I cannot believe you’re accusing me of withholding information. Why would I do such a thing?” He pointed to himself, making it clear that he was put off by the comment.
John looked up before rising from the bench he was sitting on. He smiled wearingly at Sherlock as he met him at the bars.
“I need to speak with you privately, Lestrade.” Lestrade looked back at his superior, knowing full well where the conversation was headed.
“I found a match for the vials we found at Carberry’s and the chapel,” Sherlock turned around with one of the vials and Dr. Carberry’s journal, “there’s a cemetery worker who was also attacked by an animal the same way the priest had been. There was a stash of the vials at his residence.”
“Sometime today, please.” Moriarty barked causing the man to jump slightly before finally opening the door, but only several inches.
John gawked at Sherlock. “Holmes. Please don’t tell me you don’t think that wasn’t suspicious behavior.
“…I didn’t know that Mr. Standish would be here…I panicked…I took the knife for protection after I wrote the letter to my son. I told him that I loved him no matter what…”
Yet, John only sighed, not too shocked really by his companion’s overt behavior that only just fell in line with his eccentric personality.
Mycroft chuckled loudly before motioning for them to follow him inside. John and Sherlock dragged their luggage through the front door as Mycroft continued to chat mostly to himself.
John groaned in agony as he twisted his body around to see Sherlock and Detective Baynes wrestling near the openings.
Sherlock nodded slowly as he looked upward at John. “Well, we have some time to ourselves now, that’s if you’re not too tired from the night’s proceedings…”
John thought it was strange but told himself that the detective was probably remaining calm as part of his duty as an officer.
Lestrade squeezed his eyes shut as the weight of Dr. Carberry’s murder rested on his shoulders. He knew John was innocent and he knew Detective Baynes had something to do with the murder, but it would only make Lestrade look incompetent if he accused the detective without any hard evidence.
Saxon turned slightly to smile unnervingly at Sherlock. “A long time ago I was highly respected in my field. I was the preeminent military historian…but…Wheeler took all that away from me…”
Mary pursed her lips, but then she stopped, reminding herself of Mycroft’s acerbic personality before walking ahead to follow Sherlock.
, I figured out that he would be at Saint Paul’s. Now…,” John turned onto his side to grin at Sherlock who looked more irritated than John had ever seen him.
John sighed as he stretched his body on top the bed, watching Sherlock change into some fresh clothes.
“You’ll need to see the director,” the guard handed Mycroft the pass back, “he’ll let you in to see the prisoner. His office is down the hall and to the left.”
Sherlock nodded again as he sat back down in his chair, letting out a self-satisfying sigh. “As you wish, Professor Moriarty. I look forward to it.”
But as he struggled with this unruly woman, John finally realized as he looked directly up at her, that there was something odd about this woman. So odd that in fact John screamed as he realized that the woman was Sherlock in disguise.
The group found Mary barking orders at the servants to place everything in their correct spots. She then directed everyone else to take their assigned seats, sitting Sherlock in between Mr. McArthur and James and herself next to John. As everyone settled as the servants brought out the first course, Sherlock listened to Mr. McArthur talk about a hunting trip he recently attended while John listened to James and Mary talk about their various hobbies.
Sherlock expressed surprise. “Really? That’s unfortunate. Pray tell what the reasoning was behind it?”
Inside the pub, Sherlock dusted himself off before walking up to the front counter. He looked around, trying not to look like he was being chased before spotting a man in the corner, hunched over his drink. Sherlock waved the bartender off before sauntering over to the table. He sat down across from the man before addressing him.
But before Lestrade could respond, Sherlock jumped up from his chair to grab his cap and coat. “We’re staying with my brother. If you hear anything else you think might be pertinent to the case, please send me a telegram there.”
Sherlock nodded with a smile. “That’s quite the achievement, James. If you ever get the chance, you most certainly should try again.”
“What?” John answered back, looking at the safe and then the door to the office as Sherlock hustled him out into the hallway.
John panicked internally as he watched his companion disappear down the stairs. Gladstone attempted to go after Sherlock, but John managed to take a hold of his collar before he also escaped. John kneeled down next to Gladstone in order to calm him and to get a better look at the men down by the furnaces. They were now talking about an event before complaining some more about Schuller.
“Holmes, I suggest you don’t get involved. You’re too close to the case. You’ll only end up impeding our efforts if we
Sherlock stayed still as he continued to stare down at the paper in his hands. Eventually, he turned to a degree to acknowledge both Mary and Mycroft.
Moriarty watched her leave before walking to into the main hall of the mansion. Some members of the house staff were scurrying around, picking up last minute tasks before Basil Whitehall and the invited diplomats arrived.
As the atmosphere between the three grew awkward and tense, Mycroft laughed; his whole body shook with merriment.
“Carberry’s patients…he was giving some sort of a…concoction to the less fortunate…” John looked up to see Detective Baynes’s reaction, but he appeared unphased.
“Westgate doesn’t usually allow visitors without a special pass, but I can write one up for you, Holmes.” Lestrade looked directly at Sherlock who was still looking downward at the pendant.
“Watson,” Sherlock walked up to John, holding the telegram out for him to see, “Lestrade sent this.”
Madame Loire peeked inside the parlor, looking around nervously before looking back at Mr. McArthur. “Of course, Monsieur.” She responded before turning around quickly to get back to the kitchen.
The man made another move to interject but Moriarty’s steely glare shut down any prospect of complaining. Moriarty ended the conversation by walking away from the man to exit the cellar.
Sherlock glanced at John with a wink before sauntering over to their breakfast table. He sighed as he picked up that day’s newspaper which hadn’t been trimmed and shredded for his archive.
“Watson.” John heard Sherlock call again, but he was unable to answer. He lingered before slowly turning his head to face Sherlock who expression remained grave; John had never seen his companion look so serious before and it frightened him.
“He won’t tell me more about what’s going on,” John let out quietly, “I know he knows who’s behind all of this.”
Detective Baynes waited for the officer to leave the office and the door to close before flipping the telegram over to read it.
Bridget nodded once more before rising quickly from her seat. Sherlock turned to John as soon as they were left alone.
“Well, then, Professor Moriarty, if you insist…” Sherlock began as he rose from his seat, “while I find your inclination to spot defining character traits to analyze a criminal…useful…to say the least, I do believe some of your interpretations are far too simplistic.”
John looked around the property, still in a daze of confusion. “Holmes, for god’s sake. What on earth are you doing?”
John walked into the office. It was divided into two spaces: one space for Coney’s secretary and one larger space for Coney.
“Mr. Holmes!” The heiress shouted again. She stepped forward to defend her garden, but John gently held out his hand to stop her.
John stayed in the entrance to the office: it was elegantly furnished, and the walls were lined with floor to ceiling bookshelves. At one end was the judge’s desk and on the direct opposite side of the room was a safe, at which Sherlock was already trying to decipher the code.
Sherlock leaned back in his chair. “Of course, however, can you tell us anything else about what happened between dinner and when we discovered the body?”
The man nodded before backing out of the room slowly and with so much caution that the move caused Moriarty’s face to scrunch up with disbelief.
“Thank god, Judge Becket and his wife were on holiday when this happened.” Detective Baynes offered, which annoyed Lestrade.
Mr. McArthur laughed again, causing Mary who was sitting across from him, to roll her eyes. “My daughter hates it when I discuss business. She thinks it’s too grim.”
Sherlocked grinned as he eyed Saxon. “I’ll admit you gave me a run, but I’m afraid that your kindness toward the needy was your downfall.”
The detective holding out handcuffs in front of John seemed bewildered that Sherlock knew who he was, but then he quickly regrouped.
Sherlock laughed as he joined his brother sitting near the fireplace. “No, I’ve realized that I need to let the matters take their course. In due time the doctor’s innocence will come to light.”
“If you’re not willing to explain what concrete evidence you have,” John could hear Sherlock shout, “then I’m speaking with Lestrade!”
They walked out into the alley, inching along the side of the building toward the front facing the main street. They could see Coney talking to a woman whose back was facing them. Sherlock signaled to John to have him cross the street quickly to get to an opposite corner. As John followed along, he looked behind himself at the pair, noticing right away that the woman who was speaking to Coney looked familiar.
As soon as he finished his sentence, John was yanked out of sight down the hallway by the police officers. Sherlock tried to go after them, but Detective Baynes blocked his path.
Earlier that day, Mycroft had given them the priest’s nephew’s address and Sherlock had convinced John that they would remain undetected in the city in disguise. Before that moment, John had never indulged in Sherlock’s penchant for disguises, but he had no other choice since the police would be canvasing all of London to track them down.
John squinted his eyes at Sherlock before showing him the weapon. The mother screamed and the baby cried even louder.
He sent the message before rising from his chair to retrieve his hat and coat as he exited the office.
The two men began shoving the other which in turn prompted more hysterics from Bridget. Both Fedorov and Sherlock ran over to the two men, trying to pull them away from the other.
Sherlock groaned as he rose from his chair to cross the sitting room. “I need to speak with Lestrade once we arrive at the Yard. The police shouldn’t be speaking with journalists.”
Everyone looked at each other for a moment or so before John fired at one of the train employees holding a gun before shooting the hand of another who was in the process of reaching for something in the crate to defend himself. Sherlock ran toward one of the unarmed train employees, wrestling with him to the ground. John lashed out at one of the individuals before the previously armed employee grabbed him from behind, forcing him to lose his grip on his weapon. John fell to the ground with the man, rolling around until he found his revolver. He aimed the revolver at his assailant who cowered in a corner.
Sherlock furrowed his brow as he stood up before walking back to the fireplace to retrieve Carberry’s journal. He flipped through a few pages until he stopped on the section with the missing page. He then looked back at John who unintentionally explicitly expressed his weariness.
Mary walked toward her brother and her father who were avoiding looking at each other. “Father, you mustn’t be upset with James and Madame Loire…I know they did this ridiculous thing, but—”
“Monsieur McArthur!” A perturbed woman appeared at the other end of the hall passage close to the kitchen, “you’re dragging dirt throughout the house again!”
“Quick, Wiggins!” Sherlock shooed Wiggins across the sitting room into the bedroom, shutting the door closed before launching himself into the sofa near the fireplace.
“Yes, Mr. McArthur,” Sherlock turned so that he could face both James and Mary, “no doubt my companion will tell you how excited I’ve been to visit you all this week.”
John looked at the telegram before reaching for it. He flipped it open to see that Mycroft had received an invitation to an event hosted by Basil Whitehall set for the evening after next.
“But we know my brother has his quirks. He probably didn’t want to disturb you from your rest considering.” Mycroft smiled as he cheers John with a wine glass. John made a face as he did the same.
Lestrade glared at Sherlock before sighing again. He crossed his arms in a huff. “I don’t have a number off the top of my head, Holmes.”
“All right! Break it up, gentlemen. Break it up!” Lestrade had appeared in the study followed by some fellow policemen and another man.
As soon as the hansom came to a complete stop, Mycroft hopped out, taking a moment to straighten himself out from the journey.
Sherlock shook his head as he picked up the makeshift makeup kit he had cobbled together while hiding out at Mycroft’s.
“I do indeed, however, we must figure out what Coney knows about the case. The fact that his source is likely someone from the Yard leads me to believe that there’s more to this case than we realized. Don’t you think the timeline is a bit constrained?”
Sherlock rose with his hand out toward the chair in front of them. “Mr. Fedorov, please take a seat.”
“May I help you?” Lestrade questioned cautiously, remarking to himself that his service revolver was in his desk and easily accessible.
Mycroft huffed as he pointed to the window Sherlock had clumsily broken mere minutes ago to get into Dr. Carberry’s study, before turning to point directly at Sherlock with another huff, indicating his brother’s increasingly disheveled appearance.
Sherlock shook his head as he gently took a hold of John’s forearms. “Watson, you need to trust me. Now, do you remember hearing or seeing anything while at the Yard or Westgate? Any detail is helpful.”
Sherlock smiled. “I saw you speaking with someone whom I had initially thought was also part of the house staff, but you were speaking in a familiar tone with the young man usually reserved for family members…”
He looked out through the window once more before running to the other side of the room to scribble a note to Mrs. Hudson that he had gone out to a long lunch with Mycroft and that she shouldn’t expect them until later that evening for dinner.
John dared to sniff the air around him which caused him to recoil back into the sheets. He gagged before coughing violently as he looked to the side of the bed to see that Sherlock was gone. John gagged once more before flinging the sheets off his body. He found a shirt in the dresser to cover his mouth before venturing out in the hallway.
“Did I miss lunch?” John appeared in the entryway to the parlor. He was wearing his borrowed pajamas and a robe.
Sherlock chuckled, clearly amused, as he waved a hand around. “Of course not, dear. But he’s certainly been here before if he’s obsessed with the Battle of Trafalgar…Miss?” Sherlock kept his eyes on the log, continuing to run a finger down the pages as he addressed the guide, “could we also see your donation list?”
Sherlock waved his companion off. “We must question Ms. Coventry and Mr. Fedorov again.” He said before marching back into the kitchen.
He crouched down to see a burned telegram. Upon examining the telegram, Lestrade could discern a partly visible address.
The upper level of the sawmill looked just as deserted as the lower level. There were remnants of machinery, but everything was covered with cobwebs and dust. John walked slowly into the middle of space; he could see between the floorboards and joists down into the lower level as he walked. John crouched downward to get a better look; the men were now packing up whatever explosive they had cobbled together.
“Yes, of course,” James reached toward Sherlock to shake his hand, “pleasure to make your acquaintance, gentlemen. Our father is more than excited to have you both staying with us. God knows he can’t shut up about it.”
Wiggins let out a gleeful cry before running back toward the sitting room door. Sherlock managed to stop him from getting any further by gently taking a hold of his shoulder.
“I guess influence and power knows no bounds, right, Doctor?” Mycroft grinned before going back to his food.
“Well!” Mr. McArthur rested his hands on his hips, “I think we can finally get all this ghost business behind us.” He then spun around quickly to exit the bedroom, “let’s all hurry back and try Madame Loire’s tarte tatin.”
Standish stared at the man before bursting out into another fit of laughter. “Fedorov here, is such the jester. You wouldn’t know it from his rough,
.” He offered, waving his arms about, the tone is his voice verging on the side of mystic. “The chaps at the Diogenes mention him frequently.”
Both Sherlock and John managed to ignore James’s last comment as they took turns shaking the young man’s hand.
The sister gasped. “Nothing? You cannot be serious…” she ran after her brother, reaching out a hand to stop him before he could get away further, “the ghost—”
Sherlock’s eyes widened by the unprovoked assertion. “Did you have an unfortunate relationship with Mr. Standish?”
Sherlock walked around Coney’s desk inspecting it before handing the file to John. “Because he did not wish to be seen.”
Sherlock flashed Moriarty a grin before unclasping his hand from Moriarty’s. “Perhaps. I would be delighted…”
John rolled his eyes as he hopped out of the driver’s seat. “For god’s sake, Stanley. The queen hasn’t arrived.”
“Honestly, I should have seen it from the beginning…” John vaguely explained. Sherlock was shuffling around next to him, still acting as if he didn’t know what John was talking about.
Suddenly, John struggled to breath. He fell to the floor, heavy heavily to himself, overwhelmed by the lengths someone was going through to see him executed for murder.
in Parliament has their eyes on the Prime Minister, Holmes. Whitehall is too smart to pull any stunt.”
“Sherly,” Mycroft stepped forward, “I really think you should take it easy…there’s not much we can do at the moment…” he paused as he watched his brother then walk over to the fireplace, “Sherly.”
John grinned before turning to face Sherlock, but his companion was halfway down the hall. “Holmes?” John joined Sherlock who was leaning up against the wall, “what are you doing?”
Sherlock stopped what he was doing to look back at John. He shrugged before picking out two sets of clothes.
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “You know I can’t do that, Sherlock. If I reveal his identity it may end up jeopardizing whatever lead there is with the drug.”
Moriarty opened the journal, thumbing through the pages until he found the entry he was looking for.
Sherlock ignored Mycroft as he vigorously flipped through pages before finding the page he wanted. He hustled across the room back to his desk.
Sherlock nodded as he got up from his desk to retrieve a book from his library shelves. “I’m not entirely sure yet, but I’m going to find out. This must have something to do with whomever is framing Watson.”
“Holmes, you are so reckless. What did you see that was so pressing that you nearly got yourself killed?” John admonished now holding Sherlock upright.
The three of them had just arrived back at Baker Street. The entire ride back, as one could imagine, was tensed, to say the least. Sherlock refused to speak with anyone; Mrs. Hudson cried, explaining that John was innocent; and Mycroft quietly pondered to himself how he had gotten into such a mess when he only wanted to see his brother for breakfast.
John whistled to himself as he read a folded newspaper with one hand while drinking some tea with the other. He was sitting in the dining car of a train on the way to a medical conference for the weekend. It had been a while since he had been this far away from Baker Street without Sherlock, but John needed the space; Sherlock had taken to spreading out all of his experiments in the sitting room and their bedroom and John needed some time away from his companion’s eccentricities.
Sherlock laughed as he sprung from his chair. “I do, but it’s only a distraction. We must find the murder weapon.”
Sherlock wasted little time as he shoved Lestrade to the side to exit the office. Lestrade swiftly grabbed him by the arm to keep him from going any further.
“You can wait out here. He usually returns after an hour or so.” She pointed to the little sofa in the waiting room.
John looked at the luggage car, then Sherlock—who looked to be waiting for him to stand guard—before craning his neck to graze down the far end of the train which was exposed to the temperate night air. Knowing he would never receive a decent explanation any time soon, John sighed as he nodded back at Sherlock before standing in position.
Thanks to a reliable source, the escape occurred about two days ago and involved the infamous “Rat Killer” of note, Dr. Hans Schuller, who had been housed in Westgate for a series of poisonings. My source informs me that it is possible that the Carberry murder and Dr. Schuller’s cases are linked, which means that our Dr. John Watson may be more dangerous than we originally realized…
Sherlock nodded, trying to reach for Gladstone to calm him. “I’m sure that’s the case, Henry. I know you work for my brother Mycroft. I know you didn’t have anything to do with it.”
Mr. McArthur waved his son off as Mary stood up from her chair. “Mr. Holmes, those footprints cannot belong to James…” She looked back at her brother whose expression had change to indicate that he knew where she was headed next.
Moriarty laughed heartily as he waved for a waiter to come serve their table. “My method of persuasion is…unique.”
Sherlock stepped in between John and Detective Baynes once more before the police officers could get to John.
“…he lunged towards me, and I pulled out the knife to defend myself…he impaled himself on it…hitting the table, taking the cloth and the stacked dishes with him before knocking over the stand with the bust on it…I froze for a moment before running toward the kitchen…throwing the knife out the window…”
