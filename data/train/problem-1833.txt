“That bad?” Sherlock murmured.
“Let me know if you find something.” She left, and Anthea followed, leaving the Holmes’ brothers alone.
Sherlock softened his face, and then shrugged.
Sighing with frustration, Sherlock pushed aside the papers and leaned back against the chair, running his hands through his wild curls.
“I can’t!”
Mary cleared her throat. “Good. Then we’ll know where he is if we have to pick him up. We decided not to do so, to collect more evidence or anything contradictory, and to make sure Stan doesn’t know we’re onto him.”
“Now what?” John asked lazily.
“But it’s you.” John finished for him, grinning.
“It’s not waves,” John said bluntly. “It’s constant. All the time.”
It was like coming up for fresh air after he had been drowning for his whole life. He had been weighed down and heavy but empty at the same time, and then…John limped into his life. Here was someone more than a friend—it must have crossed over the platonic boundary at some point—but here it was, a warm feeling in his chest at the idea that John cared about him—more than anyone had ever before in his life.
“I was just saying, Sherlock seems much better, now that you’re awake.”
“You’re amazing,” John whispered. Sherlock blushed as he wiped his hand and refastened John’s jeans. He looked up and met John’s eyes, and what he found startled him. He flinched back to see John’s whole face, and found the emotion wasn’t his mind playing tricks.
John slowly got his breath back, and the spasms abruptly settled. John inhaled deeply and focused on the men in front of him. Sherlock was hovering close to his bed, his hands on the bed a few inches away from John’s hand. His bed shifted upwards, and he looked to his right to see Victor moving it back in place.
John grimaced and moved back into his side of the bed. “You need to get it checked—it could be broken—” John started breathing unevenly. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he scooted closer.
“Like you said, now we’re even.” Sherlock gave him a hesitant grin, but was greeted by a smile. His brows furrowed in confusion. “Why are you smiling?”
Sherlock stared at her. “Where?”
“Leave.” he said hoarsely. Sherlock stumbled away, looking at him one more time, before running off, fighting off the urge to look back, but he didn’t.
John looked at him, his eyes widening minutely. Sherlock looked away and left the room. When he came back with a steaming cup of tea, John had started to undress, but was still in his shirt and pants. He was staring at his hands.
“I told you I’m here—.”
Two men in suits exited, towing Regina with them in cuffs. Sherlock blocked their way and he quirked an eyebrow for an explanation.
John kept his gaze beyond Sherlock’s head. Sherlock met his gaze for a moment.
*            *            *
“Oh, good you’re both here,” Mrs. Hudson greeted them kindly. She smiled at them and then set own the package on the table in front of the sofa.
Sherlock didn’t react, and remained looking confused, a look John didn’t like on Sherlock’s face, even if it was amusing at times. This was not amusing.
John cleared his throat. “Do we know who the leg belongs to?”
“Much appreciated,” Mary retorted, but Sherlock ignored her.
“It does,” Mycroft agreed. “Which begs the question as to why you were in such a hurry to use extreme measures in your interrogation.”
Sherlock tied his scarf around his neck and placed his coat on and then graciously entered the car. “John left through the side window, to the back, down the fire escape. There aren’t any signs of another person, but it seems likely. John can’t drive.”
John settled into the bed after a couple hours of stretching. He had done quite a few, took a break and had lunch, and then insisted he do more. He felt more suited in his body now, but he was feeling an odd sensation in his right thigh, leading down to the wound. He tried to ignore it and focus on Sherlock instead, who was looking at him with something akin to fondness.
“Well, I’m not most people,” Sherlock retorted.
John’s anger escalated and his face turned aggressive. He balled his fists tightly and turned away.
“Please.” John begged.
“I’m not refusing, you are—”
John looked back up at the detective, a faint sliver of recognition forming in his eyes, but then he went still.
“Take a walk,” John said instead. “Do you want to join me?” he asked.
“Sure…of course, John.” Sherlock hesitated and then headed to the door, where he hesitated again.
“Dear John…” Sherlock breathed into a sigh. “…I thought you would naturally know what to do…but um, you could punch me…get it over with.” The detective suggested.
“No, John, don’t,” he said firmly. “I researched you. I’m not the genius I said I am. It’s just a magic trick.”
John stilled for a second before his embrace tightened. “Mycroft’s on it though, right?”
Sherlock’s stare widened, the impalement in his heart piercing again with a twist.
*            *            *
“No thanks. I’m just here to check on him, won’t be long.”
There's probably going to be 6-10 total chapters, short ones. I decided to add Chapter 3 now to keep you all on your toes :)
He stared at it in silence, and briefly noticed John’s anticipation rising.
Sherlock avoided his intense gaze. “If something happened, I wouldn’t forgive myself. I
“I need one, just one will do. Ugh!” Sherlock stomped his feet and looked around with a scowl on his face. He turned his head towards John and scrunched up his nose. “That or a case. Anything, John, I’m desperate.”
Lestrade tilted his chin up slightly. “Of course.”
want to take care of it? For once I can do something for you,” he added in a mutter.
Sherlock refused to look at him. He didn’t want it to be distracting, but it was. But not for the reason John was about to state.
John groaned as he lied on his back, and beside him, Sherlock was still, lying on his side. Panicking, John rushed to his side and looked at Sherlock’s face. There weren’t any visible cuts, but he knew there could be internal damage. Trying not to think of the possibilities, John searched for a pulse, found one, and then reached for his phone.
He looked back at the other figure. “You…”
Sherlock fumed to himself for missing the obvious, and straightened up. He sat on the edge of the bed while John tried to steady his breathing. He clutched at his bandaged arm and clenched his fists. Sherlock reached forward and tried to pull John’s hand away; John didn’t seem to notice him yet, but let him take his hand. Sherlock massaged it gently, urging for the tension to cease.
Sherlock shuffled his feet and flickered his eyes briefly. Several seconds passed, and then a minute, when John realized Sherlock wasn’t going to go on.
Yet he wouldn’t give that away for anything.
There were more whispers, and then he heard footsteps pause in front of him. Sherlock kneeled down beside him, but refrained from touching. John fought the urge to shift away.
He turned around and looked at John, hope flickering in his eyes.
“That wasn’t so hard was it?”
“Fine. Make it with Lestrade.”
John then turned around, holding his balance on the counter behind him. “Another one? Do you want me to come along?”
“You had Mycroft spy on me? That wasn’t just him showing concern for me, informing Harry about it all? You had him do all that? Why couldn’t you have just come back to me sooner?”
A swarm of staff came storming in, rough hands holding him down as he shouted John’s name. He needed to set the record straight—John needed to know the truth—.
“Jesus Sherlock, this isn’t the first time you’ve kept things from me. Listen to me:
John’s head shot up. “You don’t think—.”
“Did you come across any information since you snuck away?”
“Of course, John,” Sherlock said even though he knew it wasn’t a question John was asking, but a reassured realization. “Let’s go home.”
I'm sorry for taking longer than I thought. I wanted to be sure before I posted this, and real life got in the way. I hope you enjoy :)
“You’re men?” Sherlock looked back at Lee.
“I refuse to give up on us,” Sherlock said sternly.
Sherlock nodded, and leaned closer, pointing to the victim’s head. “Traumatic brain injury, killing him nearly instantly,” he pointed out.
“It’s a mess to explain, but I’m undercover to Moran. He thinks he helped me escape from going back to the states even though my name’s been cleared. He assumed my loyalty is to him, but it never has been. Here,” Jack handed Sherlock one of his handguns, and then headed back to the door.
“Don’t bother trying to guess it. You’ll just have to wait and see.”
“I did! I came back as soon as I heard.”
“We tried sending some in,” Regina spoke up. “He attacked them.”
Sherlock didn’t look up but nodded his head absently. The door opened and another person rushed in.
“I just need to lie down for a moment,” John said.
John clenched his jaw and placed his hands on the railing of the foot of the hospital bed. He looked at Sherlock slowly, and his heart throbbed. He had so much to say, but didn’t know where to start.
“But not anymore.”
Sherlock thought through the most possible scenarios and settled on three—no, two—most likely. “You walked in with her and David in bed together.”
“You want to get dress before we go to Scotland Yard?” John asked quietly. Sherlock nodded and took a big sip of his tea as he headed to their bedroom. He paused behind John and pressed his hand on John’s right shoulder.
Before John could say anything or move, Sherlock stepped back and agonizingly slowly sifted his eyes away from John’s. He grinned but then stopped himself halfway, resulting in a half grin, half smirk, no doubt showing his confliction as clear as day. John tilted his head slightly but kept silent. Sherlock backed away to the elevator and pressed the button, still facing John. He didn’t have to wait long before it opened and he entered it backwards. As the doors closed, he saw John still looking at him with longing, which bewildered the detective.
*            *            *
“Gone, Sherlock. He’s gone. Sherlock, can you tell me what you see?”
Sherlock’s face faltered. “No,” he responded, a little less firmly than before.
John flinched awake and slowly opened his eyes. His room was lit grey by the gloomy skies outside, and it was empty. He was sitting halfway between upright and flat on his back, and his abdomen tingled but there wasn’t any pain. He glanced down to see an IV in his elbow—a blood transfusion—and an IV on top of his hand—morphine.
“Um, almost 4.”
“No, don’t be sorry. I am. Deeply, John. It was true as of this morning. But I am alive.”
John turned around and weakly grinned. “Yeah well, I should have expected it.”
John sniffled and shivered. “I don’t blame you,” he countered.
John grabbed the door handle and swung it open. He looked back at the detective briefly, disappointment in his eyes, but deeper down, Sherlock caught a glimpse of hurt.
The tea cup fell loosely from John’s palm as he too brought his hands up and cupped both sides of Sherlock’s jaw, his fingers carelessly lingering over Sherlock’s neck, caressing it gently as he kissed the phantasm back.
John’s lip trembled, but he didn’t reply. He squirmed under the sheets and removed his gaze from Sherlock. Sherlock caressed his forehead, noting the slight warmth his skin still had, and then left, keeping the door ajar.
Sherlock looked at the screen, and replayed it. He stood there for several moments, thinking.
Sherlock straightened up. “This afternoon,” he said smugly.
Sherlock asked himself. Something in his chest tightened at the thought, and he suddenly felt queasy again. He started to open his eyes again, only to keep them closed when a rough hand took his and held it.
“A friend? The freak doesn’t have friends,” an officer in the back retorted. John turned to face her.
Sherlock relaxed and nodded. “I will.” He leaned forward and kissed John chastely before straightening up and heading to the door.
“She’s growing so fast. She’s almost a year old. Molly wants to throw her a party at her flat. She suggested a bee theme, although I’m not sure where she got that idea. It probably would be tedious for you though, children’s parties aren’t a place for murders.”
*            *            *
“It’s a through-and-through, so you probably won’t need surgery. But you do need to go to the hospital.”
John turned towards him. “What are you planning on doing with the case?”
“Watson?” John nodded, held his breath, and waited.
“John?”
He wanted to make a couple of calls, and didn’t want Sherlock to suspect or ask just yet. Sherlock was probably checking the tests with Molly, so he should be a while, at least John thought so.
“Anderson, what are you doing here?” Sherlock bellowed.
“John.” He raised his voice. “I’m here, look at me, please. John?”
John cleaned Sherlock’s hand as much as he could. “This will hurt,” he warned the detective. Sherlock just nodded for him to continue.
(See the end of the chapter for
This time, John raised his eyebrows and smirked. “Show me.”
“What is the drug used for then?” Molly asked.
“I’m still in this John.” He explained softly, leaning forwards just an inch closer to his blogger.
“Any names in that that sound like the ones we know?”
John looked back at her. “Afterword’s, I don’t remember but they must had knocked me out again, in the head this time, and I awoke in some kind of cellar…”
Sherlock exhaled softly. “He left at the same time. I don’t remember how long he was gone for…”
“What’s wrong?”
As the minutes passed, John tried to lie still in Sherlock’s arms, but the pain seemed to steal his focus from anything else. He closed his eyes and focused—hard—on Sherlock’s breathing, his arms gently holding John around his back—one under his neck and the other holding him beneath his left shoulder blade.
The man flinched awake and a groan escaped his lips. Sherlock smirked, knowing all to well the hard wood floor wasn’t the best choice to sleep after mind-blowing sex. Sherlock abruptly halted his thought at that description.
As the man came closer, he relaxed he spoke with relief. “Oh, Sherlock, thank god—.”
John heard Sherlock sigh and then put his coat on. He kept his eyes closed as he heard Sherlock opening the door, pausing, and then closing it behind him without another word.
They rocked the rhythms of their orgasms until they were both completely finished, their heavy breathing in sync in the silent flat.
John squirmed and took a step back, balancing on his left foot. “I’m fine…” he lied.
“Before I died.”
John gasped, and blinked rapidly at the sensation. Sherlock moved his hand a couple of times over the cloth, and then started to slip his hand past the waistband, when John took hold of his wrist and held him in place.
John had ripped his pajama bottoms and was applying a layer of gauze over the wound and on the back on his thigh, tapping it to his skin.
Mycroft ushered her forward and viewed the footage. After a moment, he raised his eyebrows and turned to Sherlock. “It appears Moran is leading a trail purposely for you to follow him.”
Sherlock peered out of the corner of his eyes towards John's direction; John looked away and focused back to the front of the elevator.
Sherlock slowly left. John quickly turned off the shower and reached for his towel. He dried off while he remained seated, placed the towel around his waist, and then maneuvered himself until he was sitting on the edge of the tub rather than the chair. He reached for a crutch and placed it under his right arm, and then stood up. He moved the crutch forward to take a step, but then the crutch slid against the wet floor, and John fell along with it. He tried reaching to the left for the counter but it was too late, and he landed hard on the ground onto his side, with the crutch underneath him.
“Have some water at least.”
“Sherlock?”
“It’s not him.”
Sherlock nodded his thanks and then went to Stan’s room. He walked in, closed the door, but then stopped in his tracks.
“Are you physically active?”
*            *            *
Sherlock disappeared from sight for a minute, and then reappeared, his face contorted with frustration. He walked up to John and whispered harshly.
There's 8 more hours.....I'll post the last chapter later tomorrow :)
John ignored it and breathed deeply, keeping his eyes shut.
Sherlock exhaled slowly, and then he turned his head, and met John’s eyes with a neutral expression.
Warning: drug use
“So…you’re not suicidal?”
He turned towards the door, and noticed a clear plastic curtain pulled all the way, serving as a border between him and the hallway.
“Have you seen Sherlock recently?” the psychiatrist asked.
“I don’t suppose you have a photo of him. A recent one, I mean for all I know he could be—.”
After a moment of embrace, Sherlock nudged John away and without another word, the detective walked away; his blogger’s head still down, looking upon the grass as the last couple of tears fell together to the ground.
John paused. “Because…” He started, his voice stabilizing greatly as he pressed on. “You saved me. Every time it’s appeared since you’ve been back, you’re there, beside me, reassuring me that it’s not real. And that you’re the real Sherlock. You’re there for me.”
It was early in the morning when Sherlock’s phone rang. John woke up to find Sherlock still sound asleep, so he answered it, recognizing Lestrade’s number.
“Surgeon—neurosurgeon.” Sherlock skimmed the opened books on the table, and the notes. “Ellis had been reading into Alzheimer’s, which made sense because of his wife’s condition. But these books were primarily for research, not necessarily for caretaking, although a doctor specializing in the brain could have wanted more information to understand the disease…I don’t suppose his wife has anything to say.”
John rubbed his eyes. “Oh, Sherlock…” he murmured. He remained standing like that for several minutes, and then he turned to leave, heading towards the door with a slight limp. As he opened the door, a ringtone pierced the silent, that of a seductive sigh.
This time, Shepherd’s face faltered. “How?”
John trembled and shuffled closer to the wall. Something warm began to dampen his pajama bottoms, and he cowered further away from Sherlock, his cheeks burning red now.
“Hm?”
John inhaled deeply and by the door, he glanced at Sherlock.
John nodded, suddenly appreciative. Sherlock walked towards the door.
Sherlock quickly pressed the nurse call button, and then shook John again. “Wake up, John. Tell me, what’s wrong—.”
“Don’t you want to go with him?”
“On the dock, Shepherd appeared from the corner and pushed you over. I talked with him until Mycroft appeared and he took him away. Then I jumped back into the water and pulled you out. I did CPR and you began to breath on your own but then, you became hypothermic and…god, John you were so cold I—.”
“You’re…here.” John stated.
John left his jeans for last. Mrs. Hudson hadn’t had time to alter all of his pants—so far, she had gotten to his pajamas, so his jeans were just tied in a knot at the knee of the right pant leg. John didn’t have to bother unraveling it though, so he slowly took them off, keeping his eyes focused intently on the zipper, and then on the jeans as he put them away.
he suddenly felt that desire. It was shocking to himself, a too intimate thought he hadn’t had or truly felt before.
Here's a video showing how Sherlock takes John out of the water and what the dock sort of looks like
comments keep me sane as per usual :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John’s cheek burned with the affection, and he craved more. He leaned back far enough to whisper in Sherlock’s ear and leaned into Sherlock’s hand that was resting on his lower back.
“Sherlock?”
“Oh, John…” Sherlock murmured heavily. John breathed heavily against Sherlock’s forehead, and then tilted his head down to graze his cheek against Sherlock’s. He relaxed his body and placed his arms by Sherlock’s head. He thrusted his hips upwards, but then winced.
*            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *            *
Both of them were silent for a couple of minutes, and then John spoke slowly.
John was crying again. Sherlock swallowed tightly, resisting himself from opening his eyes and confronting John, but he predicted that wouldn’t go well. John would wipe his tears and pretend everything was fine; it probably wasn’t the best way to comfort him.
“Un-cuff me Sherlock.” He demanded as calmly as he could.
“These men have your things John. I suppose Mary sent them over.” She said smiling and left.
John inhaled deeply and sat down. Sherlock sat beside him. After a moment, John nodded.
Mask: large pole that stands vertically and holds the sail
John nodded, and then she placed him just by the front desk and applied the brakes on his chair. She walked to the phone, her back to John, and answered it. John looked around for a moment, sighing when he could tell the call was going to be a bit long. He looked around, and then noticed a book on the table, opened.
“I’m quite alright—.”
They moved against each other, thrusting in sync, ignoring the music and focusing on themselves, their breaths and gasps mixing together with every burst of pleasure. John reached down and stroked Sherlock’s cock, his thrusts becoming faster and faster. Sherlock arched his back as he finally came, his cock spurting against his chest. John stroked him through his orgasm, and after a few more thrusts, John came, the wave of his orgasm crashing over him with complete satisfaction.
Lestrade stepped forward. “It’s like a Christmas miracle. A fairy tale ending,” he said teasingly.
“You okay there?”
Later in the afternoon, John came back in, his face gleaming with sweat and his hair matted to his face.
Sherlock opened his eyes, and gasped at what he saw. It was a wheelchair, but the backrest was smaller, and there weren’t any handles. The wheels were slanted slightly on the sides, and the whole chair was considerably smaller than the one he was sitting in.
John scoffed. “So that’s the only reason I should get one? So I could follow you around. Is that all I am to you?” John
“Exactly what kind of—.”
“Look,” John tried again. “I do understand that you don’t do relationships of
“No. Mycroft—.”
“Don’t go dwelling on this Sherlock.” Mycroft warned. “I can have a further look if it would help you sleep at night—.”
John nodded. He couldn’t lift his arms well enough to feed himself; his right arm was better, but his left wasn’t, and it was his dominant hand. The doctors were concerned he would have trouble eating, but he had managed to swallow water without choking. He had been very nauseous yesterday, which on top of the exhaustion and near constant sleep, John had been irritated and withdrawn. But now his appetite was starting to return. If he could swallow without choking, they wouldn’t have to put in a feeding tube, which John definitely didn’t want.
John cleared his throat and nodded. He must have dazed out for a moment. He grinned reassuringly, hoping he looked apologetic. Victor seemed to take his expression for his word, for he smiled, and continued.
Sherlock kept his head on the bed and closed his eyes. Only a few seconds ticked by before he peered his eyes open and looked at John.
“You’ve seen the flat. We should be able to afford it together. Like I said, it’s just convenient.”
“Oh my…” Mary breathed. Sherlock and John stared at the space in the floor. A larger bomb rested there, a timer on its side timed for five minutes.
“Right, thanks.”
Sherlock looked closer at the footage. “Replay it.” He insisted.
The next morning, Sherlock awoke from a restless doze and quickly dressed. The sun was just rising, and John was asleep in their bed, still in the same, restrained position. John’s brows were creased forward slightly, and his body was tense. He needed to take his medication soon, both for the pain and the infection to keep it at bay. Letting him out of the hospital was nearly against protocol; he should have stayed in the intensive care unit, but John was adamant.
Stunned, John watched Sherlock as he slowly walked further into the room, which suddenly looked more like an aisle than a courtroom.
Sherlock sighed and relaxed. “Yes Captain.”
“Well nobody can pretend being such an annoying dick all the time,” John replied, the slightest grin twitching at the corner of his lips.
“What do we do?” John asked. Their surroundings glowed against the setting sun, contrasting with the distant streetlamps and light from the rising moon. There weren’t any other boats around, except for a small wooden dinghy that was tied up to the side of the deck. As John saw it, he immediately hoped it would be dismissed as an option. He was ultimately kidding himself.
*            *            *
Sherlock chuckled. John laid his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, smiling. Sherlock held him closer, and the both of them fell into a light doze as it started to snow outside their window.
John stared at him, expecting more. When nothing else came, John straightened up.
“John?” Sherlock spoke hesitantly.
“What is the point of this?”
Sherlock’s fists were clenched, as was his jaw, and he couldn’t help but look up at John, who was standing by his side, his hands resting on the bed. There were a couple of nurses around him on both sides of the bed, one near the switches, ready to shift him upwards.
“Not important,” John mumbled.
Sherlock scoffed to himself. The only reason he had started seeing Victor again was to forget about his feelings for John. That was probably a bit not good, but deep down, Sherlock had hoped John would admit his opinion of Victor, just so Sherlock could at least know. He wasn’t sure about how John felt about his self though, but John
“Mmm, e-s,” John managed. Mandy nodded encouragingly.
“What do you mean it’s the wrong guy?” John snapped to Lestrade on the phone. Sherlock groaned beside him their bed, and John lowered his voice. “Does he look like the illustration Lucy had done?”
Without speaking, Sherlock rushed forward and kneeled by John’s bedside. John was pale and covered with sweat and…tears. His eyes were tightly shut and his chest heaving, drawing in shallow breaths.
Mycroft turned and saw Jack coming up to the three of them.
Sherlock looked upon his partner. John glared softly. “Don’t look at me like that.”
Sherlock grunted. “John doesn’t know what he’s doing. He has nothing to do with this. It’s just me and you.”
just like the hallucination you’ve been seeing?”
“John.”
The life in Sherlock’s eyes was draining as he choked; tears were falling on his face, streaming from John’s eyes. The man’s eyes connected with Sherlock’s and abruptly his body froze, his grip loosening as he roughly shifted off the body. Sherlock coughed roughly and scooted away.
“John this is ridic—.”
Making up his mind, John stood up and retrieved his coat. He looked at Sherlock on the sofa, and decided not to bother him. He left quietly, and hurried to Willoughby’s office.
Lucy nodded. “She would be lucid for several days, and then not for not as long. At least, that was it for the first couple of months.”
John entered the kitchen, looking odd as well. Silence encased the room as John started to prepare the kettle, grinning only slightly when he found it was already boiling.
Sherlock straightened up and looked at the first one. “The one on the left doesn’t have a scar on his shoulder. The vest would cover it, but the edges sprawl outwards to his shoulder and arm, and it would show. That man’s arm doesn’t have scar, clear as day.”
He should have known it was too good to be true.
“We have time. We need to—”
It seemed like the hallucination heard him, for he gradually faded again until all that was visible was his face. It grinned.
“Stay awake,” John demanded in a quick, slightly loud, tone. Without removing his gaze, he reached for the call button and pressed it. Sherlock watched his movements, but his blinks grew heavier.
“They won’t hurt you, John. I can protect you—.”
“John?”
“Because you could die if I don’t solve this, John!” Sherlock bellowed.
“And when was this?”
“Injure? Not kill me?”
“All right…” John headed to the kitchen and quickly prepared his tea. Sherlock followed him, and made his own, taking the last packet out of his box and then tossing the box aside.
“I want to have sex,” Sherlock blurted out as he strolled in. John furrowed his eyebrows and gaped at him.
“The most ordinary can be the most surprising.” The detective said absently.
“May I see your warrant?” he asked.
“Sherlock?” His voiced trembled despite him trying to keep it still. Sherlock lowered his head to indicate he had heard him, but didn’t speak.
John nodded and focused; he raised his right hand and held it steady for several seconds, before his hand trembled and he let it go.
Sherlock furrowed his brows. “If it’s the flowers, I can—.”
Sherlock scoffed. “It’s the concussion, John, not Alzheimer’s. He rounded onto Willoughby. “Why are we here, anyway?”
John stayed awake for a few more hours while Sherlock slept beside him. The doctor visited and updated John on his prognosis; his fever was finally gone after a couple of days in the hospital, in which John had ice packs placed over his body in order to do so. They had given him antibiotics for the infection, and through it all John slept. The medical staff shared information about Sherlock, stating he didn’t sleep at all until John’s fever finally broke, in which he nearly collapsed in relief. As they left the room for John to comprehend it all, he felt immensely guilty of how stubborn he had been through all of this. It all seemed like a blur. He wished he realized it sooner, when he was conscious and clearheaded. But, it was over now, it seemed. The infection was being treated, and for the first time in several, several days, John could think, and reflect on what the two of them went through.
“Well, I’m saying it now. And, I’m sorry. For not saying it, and for not being myself.” John looked away for a moment, organizing his thoughts. “Let’s take it one day at a time, and not run the second something becomes too difficult. Let’s try, ok?”
With a grin on his face, Sherlock stepped forward, stretching out his hand. There was a loud crack above them, and the mast of their boat, with its opened sail, came falling down towards them.
John fidgeted under his gaze, but didn’t pull away from his touch.
Mycroft didn’t move. “You haven’t told him.”
“Your brother said I’m only here to check your progress. I’ll be here every few days or so. And I’ll show you some exercises to keep you fit. Your partner can watch and then he can help you with them in the future.”
John grinned slightly and took a piece of fruit, swallowing away his guilt. He was relieved he hadn’t been caught; otherwise they wouldn’t leave him alone for days, and Dr. Bailey would probably think he was unconsciously suicidal for taking a walk by himself.
“She didn’t know,” he stated confidently.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The room was filled with bags of the white powder, and the air had a chilly feeling to it. John’s nose already started to become runny, and he sniffled.
Moran gapped. “Wait a minute, he’s a suspect—.”
“But at the graveyard you—you just went along with it. You didn’t bother to set the record straight. I know we already talked about this, but I need say this. I need to tell you that I thought you were a hallucination then, that I almost kissed you then, that before, I had already declared my…” John exhaled and changed his mind. “I was lost without you. Sherlock I can’t—I barely did it for myself then. I did it for you because you technically told me to. If you want me to do it for you again, or for us, I will. But I’m—.” John drew in a shaky breath as Sherlock squeezed his hand in reassurance. “I’m scared Sherlock.”
“Is that why you’ve been distant?” John asked carefully.
“I’m sorry.”
John nodded stiffly. “F-fine. Just some discomfort.”
“Right, sorry. Could you…”
“But, John—,”
“Right, so that’s done,” Sherlock said dismissively. “Any sightings of John?” he tried to ask casually, but his voice quivered the slightest, only Mycroft would have caught it. Sherlock absently rubbed his left ring finger, and blanketed his face as he looked up.
“I—I don’t know. Earlier, I could just speak to you like…him, and leave whenever, but now I can’t leave.”
John nodded with understanding, and then hurried after Sherlock.
“Who was that?” he asked.
“James…!”
“I’m fine, Sherlock—”
John flushed at the mention of Sherlock. Harry noticed of course and her face softened with sympathy. “You miss him still. Sure, you’re moving on but I would expect it would come like waves.”
“That’s just perfect,” Sherlock snapped to himself. John stood up, carefully avoiding the shards and the fluid. He peered at the cut and stood up straighter.
John’s grinned widened. “Yeah, sure.”
John sighed. “A fraud.”
John let out a chuckle. “I’ll do my best.”
Sherlock pulled long strokes up John’s cock, running his thumb over the tip before starting again. He started slowly, and picked up his past, earning low groans from the man on top of him.
“I think I can help though. I was…I was going to wait until after the wedding; my wedding present for you.”
“Ok…but she was the antagonist of the story. You said Kingston was just a recruit.”
“He’s just really good at impressions,” Sherlock said as if it were obvious. “Besides that, he pointed out the time in which the bomb would start its countdown, which you would have definitely told me back at the concert hall if you knew.
Sherlock sat in his chair, reaching forward as he turned on the shower. It was the beginning of November, and had even snowed in the middle of the night. Most of it had melted by mid-morning, but it was still pretty cold, and John had decided to stay in the warm blankets. Sherlock had managed to convince him he could shower without help, and was just doing fine so far.
“Are you working on a case?” John asked, his voice still demanding. He was pushed into the room and then he spun around to the door, but Sherlock was blocking it, and he was bouncing on his feet, as if ready to pounce on John if John tried to escape.
“Um, I saw Moran shoot you, then it’s just bits and pieces, but I remember killing him, and then his accomplice, Sven, took me to another room. And then…” John blinked rapidly and clenched his jaw.
John stared at him, and then inhaled sharply.
“Confused,” John replied angrily. “Why am I here? Where’s Sherlock?”
Sherlock gaped at John. “Me?”
“It’s been a long day. A little could help.”
Sherlock looked at him intently, and when he didn’t respond, John continued.
“You haven’t done it in a while,” Sherlock pointed out.
“John’s not here.” He said simply and took a breath before continuing. “Don’t you remember? He flat lined back at the hospital, after surgery. You tried to revive him but the doctors stopped you because he signed a DNR form. There wasn’t anything you could have done.”
Stretching and putting on his dressing gown, Sherlock walked lazily to the kitchen. He stopped in his tracks when he saw the remains of an omelet scattered across the floor.
Mycroft eyed Moran suspiciously. “You’re a guest here. Have Watson receive the medical attention he needs before he’s questioned.”
“John.”
Moran looked at him with disgust but Sherlock continued. “Yes I already knew that. It’s pathetically obvious. Inflict whatever sentiment-shattering-torture you’d like on me, just as long as John is unharmed.”
“Sherlock—.”
Sherlock raised his hand and held John’s arm gently, squeezing it as if to assure his lover that he is okay. “I hear you.” John leaned back, shifting his weight onto his uninjured leg. He raised a hand to the visibly skin and delicately grazed the reddening bruise overlaying the detective’s chest. He began to shake, his breathing hitching and becoming shallow. He couldn’t keep himself upright, and crumpled to the floor onto his knees. He leaned forward, resting his head in Sherlock’s lap, clutching the detective wherever he could as the shuddering increased. All Sherlock could do was hold his lover tight and rub soothing circles in his back. And so he did.
Sherlock smiled, and then left with a slightly speed in his heel. John fell into a light doze for nearly an hour, and when he woke up, he wished he had taken Sherlock’s offer for a wash.
Sherlock tensed and glared at him. Stiffly, he got onto his knees, facing the front of the boat and tentatively raised his hands.
*            *            *
Sherlock grinned. “If aspect more sublime, this blessed mood is a mystery to me. You always surprise me John Watson. You’re very heart-warming, very…”
Most days were repetitive—repeats of the past. It was always before they had gotten together, some before Sherlock faked his death, and some after. Sherlock never remembered they were married. It was always before, with Sherlock sometimes mentioning Mary or John’s girlfriends. John couldn’t help but feel hurt, thought he couldn’t realize why—if it was because of Sherlock’s lack of observation to either of their wedding rings, or the necklace around his neck, or because it seemed their marriage wasn’t worth remembering—which was ridiculous to think. It was common for Alzheimer patients to fall back to around five years ago, losing about two automatically as if by default.
“You all right?” Sherlock asked.
“Really? Well, I have a surprise for you too.”
Sherlock nearly gapped at him. He cleared his throat and lifted his chin up, trying to be clear in his opinion.
Sherlock’s eyes darted to the army doctor. “If I did then why would I have had sex with you?”
“Repeat these words back to me and remember them: truck, cabin, spoon.”
“Sometimes he did. But usually it was because of budget cuts. Most were interns, some residents. A couple of times it was because of a malpractice suit, but he never hears from them again.”
John nodded again. Vanessa continued checking his vitals, and then reached for his gown.
John chuckled again, but the chuckle didn’t reach his eyes, although his eyes did flicker with something…else. Sherlock couldn’t define it, no matter how hard he tried to squint at John without arising suspicion. He continued with his activity, but found he couldn’t quite focus on anything for the rest of the day.
“John,” Sherlock whispered. “Trust me.”
Walking up the seventeen steps was tough, but John finally made it up to their flat. He was exhausted. Brain surgery could do that to a person. He slumped inside and froze. It was in the same condition he left it: skull on the mantel, armchairs by the fireplace, kitchen full of experiments—well it was clean now, he would have to thank Mrs. Hudson for that. John made his way to his chair and settled down, suppressing a yawn. He needed sleep. But he also needed to have a serious talk with Sherlock. He was still upset about the whole thing. Thrilled to have him back but still furious. Back at the hospital, they hadn’t had much time in discussing the real seriousness of the whole situation due to John’s limited consciousness before sleep and exhaustion took over.  It was happening again yet John couldn’t suppress his anticipation for his life going back to how it used to be, or at least, he hoped it would without any severe change.
Sherlock quoted the article and looked up a John, who was furrowing his brows.
John squeezed his eyes shut, breathed deeply through his nose, and then sat up on the edge of the bed. He couldn’t handle hearing Sherlock’s voice today; and after hearing it every time after his therapy session in the past week, he was afraid he might crack. John wondered why he was hearing voices now, since before the incident at the restaurant, he hadn’t heard any. In fact, he thought he was improving. He only visited Sherlock’s grave once in a while besides on the anniversary, and he was with Mary now.
*            *            *
John looked at him, slightly taken aback. “Was that innuendo? An attempt of course.”
Sherlock clenched his jaw and for a moment, closed his eyes. John thought he was thinking, but then swiftly, Sherlock stood up and barely glimpsed back at John before he left the room, clicking the door shut behind him.
12:32 PM
“Mycroft—,”
“I think so,” John said. “The tourniquet’s not too tight so there’s still blood flow, but if I start walking it’ll start bleeding again. Do you have any idea what time it is?”
“9:02.”
Twenty minutes later, they came to a clearing, a bed of grass and weeds overlooking the ocean. John pushed Sherlock into the field, as the thick grass proved difficulty, and then paused in the middle.
“John! You’re a doctor.
John furrowed his brows and looked from Canterbury to Sherlock. Something caught his eye on the floor, and he took a step closer. It was an empty hypodermic needle. John turned back to Sherlock, only to find him going out front and meeting Lestrade and the fellow officers.
He stopped in his tracks, realizing with a dread he couldn’t sulk in private. He heard John’s steps close behind him, and sat stiff in his chair, holding on his wheels tightly.
Sherlock gasped softly with comprehension. “So I will not miss the moment he takes John which will give me a chance to save him, bringing the two of us together…then why doesn’t he just kidnap us both?”
“What do we got?” She asked as she made her way to John and began examining the head wound.
“You can see me?”
John inhaled quickly, and pulled out a silver chain with a rectangular metal plate. A smile formed on his face as he read the inscription.
?” Silken had sung.
John sat down and pressed the button by the ankle to release the pin. He removed the leg and then put another sock over his stump, and then put the leg back on. He stood up slowly and balanced himself with the aids.
Sherlock decided now would be good to put an end to this interaction. . “So I’m going to go shower and when I come back, you won’t be here.”
“What were you trying to do, John? If you need to go to the bathroom, you could have asked. We’re here to help you. For once can’t you see that?”
Sherlock relaxed slightly, but then tensed, and his brows furrowed. “What—.”
John shrugged, and then he laughed. “Well, Kingston does sound like Queen—a name of royalty or something.”
Holmes.”

Before Sherlock could respond, it rang again. John tried to reach for it again, but Sherlock took his hand and held it away. John giggled as Sherlock climbed over him, pining his hands but his head.
Sherlock gave him some water, and then slowly stood up. “You’ll be fine?”
John pursed his lips and clenched his fists. His temper was rising and he must look like a fool for having a row with a ghost. This couldn’t go on, it just couldn’t. He’d go mad if he began a relationship with a ghost. It was absurd.
John’s eyes widened again.
“John,” Sherlock said as he sat up and stepped forward. He kissed John gently and then pulled away.
activity to pass the time. After breakfast, he had taken Sherlock to the garden house. It had been cleaned up at some point, and was now cleaner, with room to walk around without getting tangled up with overgrown vines and weeds.
The detective shifted closer to his blogger, ignoring the pain shooting through his shoulder. John tried to squirm away but Sherlock wasn’t allowing it. He pressed himself to John and wrapped his arms around him tighter to keep John as warm as possible in the frigid waters.
“Hey, Sherlock. Do you mind if we have an early dinner?”
Sherlock hung up with a scoff and turned to John.
Sherlock bit his lip and looked around, trying to think of something he could do. He turned back to John, and cringed when he saw his shoulders shake and shudder.
Willoughby’s office was large. There was a door on the other side of the wall that led to an examination table/bed with a sink and counter beside it with all of the necessities. To the left, it was as if the room had once been two; this side was carpeted, with a desk, a file cabinet, and two, clearly comfy, chairs for the patients facing the desk. The man behind the desk stood up and greeted John with a charming smile. He stretched out his hand and introduced himself, his voice smooth and comforting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock looked towards his leg, but John was moving too roughly, and then he realized.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock cleared his throat. “You still have the catheter in. Pajama bottoms might not work.” He looked at John.
Margaret walked in and removed the top as Sherlock slowly stepped to his left side. He sat down and looked at his hand, wanting to take it.
Sherlock looked at the men. “Upstairs—actually—.” He looked at John, who met his gaze. “Take them down the hall to that bedroom.” He pointed to his own, keeping his eyes on John’s face as it morphed into surprise.
“Right.” John cleared his throat, and then closed the curtain. “Shout if you need anything.”
“Don’t look at me like that,” John said in a clipped tone. “I’m not something to pity. The crutch just slipped. It would have happened even if I just had a broken leg.”
“I know, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry Sherlock.”
John huffed lightly. “Oh, right. Lets shower then, and then sleep. For a bit at least.”
“Don’t bring me into this, it seems you guys have a lot to work out.” Moran stated. “Too bad one of you has to die soon.”
“I know. But this is something for the both of us.” Sherlock looked into John’s eyes. John smiled, and kissed his cheek.
“Well, yes. For two separate things.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond with a retort, but John pushed out of his arms and went into the car without question, sitting behind the driver; Sherlock followed suit, buckling in and reaching for the door. Before he could get the door closed, the car sped away.
John shook his head.
John let out a choked gasp and curled in on himself.
John smirked and leaned to the side in his seat. He whispered quickly in Sherlock’s ear, and as he leaned back, his smirk grew into a smile as he noticed Sherlock blush crimson—like blood. How fitting, for Sherlock Holmes.
“I know,” John whispered. “This is just cautionary. This morning, you gave me a fright, so just sit there and answer his questions.”
“We need to calm him down first, and see if he becomes lucid. If he doesn’t…”
“Yeah, I figured. But waiting isn’t your forte.”
“Ms. Sinclair, everybody.” Sinclair barely looked up as she down, a near match of Anthea, apart from her wine shade of red hair. She immediately began looking over her portable laptop and other files, occasionally exchanging murmurs with Mycroft, and completely ignoring Mary.
John turned towards him, and looked at him gently.
John closed his mouth and looked at Sherlock, his eyes flickering with surprise then relief. His mouth widened into a smile and his eyes crinkled around the edges.
Sherlock nodded. “Solving it, yes. But there’s going to be a tremendous amount of paperwork.”
Moran seemed to ponder this for a moment. “I see… well, then I’ll make a few calls, talk to the President, and see if he can clear things up with the Prime Minister.”
Sherlock smiled back, and then on second thought, he stepped forward and kissed John on the lips chastely, before walking backwards until he was out of the sitting room. John heard him slow down his pace as he left the flat.
“Of course,” John said. He trailed his hand down Sherlock’s check and cupped it gently. “I’ll remind you of who I am every day. No matter what.” He pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s, and felt him breath against his check. Sherlock leaned closer and rested his forehead against John’s shoulder. They fell into a comfortable silence, never letting go of each other.
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows. “What can wait?”
John reached up and grabbed it tightly, and then pulled himself up. It shook in his grasp, and was straining against metal hooks, but John still lifted himself upright with one hand against the wall, until a hook gave way, and he collapsed back to the ground, just as the door opened.
Sherlock gaped at him. “Wh—I’m not high!”
He stared at the man, trailing his eyes from the man’s phone to his face.
John stepped out of his touch and looked at him. “Sherlock—.”
John aimed his gun at Moran, slowly stepping closer until he was in clear view from behind the pillar. Moran kept his gun to Sherlock’s head, but didn’t shoot. Sherlock tensed at first when he first heard the shout, but then relaxed when he saw John out of the corner of his eye. He also had a look of confusion, a rare look upon the detective.
Quick steps thundered down the stairs, and Sherlock wheeled himself closer and glared at John as he made his way down.
He looked at John with a slight accusing expression. John shrugged and leaned further against the pillow, fatigue kicking in again. He inhaled deeply, but then winced, finding it harder to breath again. Sherlock and Victor straightened up and towered over him. John found it suffocating, so he lifted his right hand to the handle hanging above of him. He managed to grasp it and pull, but then gentle hands were pressing down on his shoulders.
“Wasn’t hungry.”
Sporadically, the nurses had him practice sitting up in bed, shortening his awareness by half. By the end of the first full day since waking up, he managed to sit up for thirty minutes. John started to feel optimistic, and lied back down with a small grin.
John starred at the phantasm, and it stared back. It was eerie. John felt odd whenever he locked eyes with it. Sherlock was pale—grey and almost green as if rotting from being in the water for too long. But then his lips were blue, and it was his eyes that sent horror shivering down John’s chest. They were completely dull, as if life ceased to exist in that brilliant brain of his. Grey eyes (the original colors were lost) looked intently at the army doctor, but they were distant and the pupils were pinprick. He honestly appeared more like a dead body then a mere hallucination.
“So how do you two meet again?” Lestrade asked, a grin forming on his face.
“How would you know?” Sherlock shot at him, turning around and squinting his eyes at him. His voice had quivered, but he didn’t care. “You can walk anywhere you want, so I’m starting to wonder why you haven’t left yet—.”
*            *            *
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s face in the screen was identical; is hands the same size in proportion. His hair styled the same; his clothes were his, his shoes, even his gait was—
“And you weren’t wanted for treason.”
Sherlock stood where he was behind the blogger and affectingly nuzzled his nose into John’s hair, carefully avoiding the light bandage over the surgical scar.
Sherlock clenched his jaw and took the bucket and cloth from Regina. He set the bucket on the edge of the bed, and dipped the cloth into it. He squeezed the excess water out and then gently wiped John’s forehead, keeping the cloth pressed against his skin for a few seconds before going down to his neck.
*            *            *
“C’mon. Let’s get you warmed up.”
“Well, you’ll be clean and the movement will do you good. You don’t want to—.”
John stood behind him and gently grasped his shoulder and tried to turn him around. “You look sick. Let me check your temperature, you may have a fever.”
“The chemist’s. I’ll text Lestrade, he’ll meet us there.”
“Yes. I can’t push myself too hard, and hurt myself. Besides, I have physical therapy tomorrow. Alex is coming at two.”
John winced and sat down. “Me.”
John shook his head. “Go.” His shoulders slouched with defeat. “Go.”
“I wouldn’t think so. I managed to track him back here in London where I found out he was checking on John, proving to himself that it isn’t him behind the damage.”
“It’s not our anniversary is it?”
Sherlock didn’t respond, but he prepared him some anyway and he drank it without protest.
He began walking up the steps, purposely stepping on the creak to give John a warning that he was coming. He reached the door and knocked softly. The heavy breathing only continued, but another sound formed. John was thumping against something to what? Get Sherlock’s attention?
Sherlock nodded in understanding and smiled.
John sighed. “You feeling guilty isn’t helping.”
Here chapter 5, which is split into 2 parts because it's so long. If I get any comments on this one, then I will give you part 2 sooner, or by Tuesday... that is if I get some comments :)
He looked at Mary. She avoided his gaze by looking at Mycroft. John looked at him.
do you know things like that?” John asked. Mike grinned in the corner.
Sherlock kept his eyes on John and his jaw clenched shut. Emotion was swelling instead of him, but he kept his face still and didn’t walk away.
“But I just told her what name I heard. Wouldn’t she warn Moran?” John asked.
“God yes.”
His stomach did an odd flip when he saw John smile—not frown, but smile. It was a comforting one too, reassuring, not sympathetic or pitiful, but…small and heartwarming—the only warmth Sherlock had felt since this ordeal had started.
“I’m here.” He whispered and shifted closer, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist and leaning him forwards, bringing him into a tight hug. “I’m right here Sherlock.”
“Nope!” Sherlock tightened his legs around John’s hips and pulled him closer, lifting his hips in sync with John’s thrust. John giggled.
“John? Are you okay? What are you doing?” Sherlock asked through he door, his voice hitching with worry.
She slowly moved half the bed up to a reclining position as Sherlock held onto John. John groaned from the movement, and his coughing resided. He lay back against the pillow, and absently shifted his hand until he found Sherlock’s.
Sherlock straightened up as well and met Victor’s challenging gaze. “Believe what you want. It’s over.”
“How would that help?” Sherlock asked skeptically.
John sighed it rather than spoke it, but it was better.
But when John visited Sherlock, he’d become nearly completely unhinged.
The door opened slightly, and John peeked through. Noticing Sherlock on the floor, he walked forward, and knelt down beside Sherlock.
*            *            *
Mycroft didn’t hesitate. “Fine.”
John barged into the hospital room to see Culverton Smith leaning over Sherlock, who was frighteningly still.
“Ow,” he said aggravated. It didn’t hurt much, but he said it anyway just to annoy the man. Maybe then he would appear rude and they would stop running into each other.
John had no idea how much time went by, or if he had just fallen asleep again. The next thing he knew was that he wasn’t alone anymore. Mary was beside him, stroking his forehead.
I'm sorry if there's any mistakes. But I hope you enjoy the angst :)
The door behind him opened and Sherlock turned around. Kim entered, and closed the door behind her.
John bristled slightly. “Look, just let me say this. You weren’t revenge,” he began, as if Sherlock’s deep fear had been obvious, and yet it still caught him off guard.
John sighed tiredly. “That was Doctor Shepherd; he wants me to come back in and run a MRI scan. There’s indication of something on the CT but it’s not clear enough…so he wants me to go back in.”
“There’s a weird substance here on the couch. I’ll take a sample—could be something,” a man stated out of nowhere. John’s blush deepened. Sherlock wondered why; John had worn a condom, it would only be his own DNA, perfectly expected in one’s own flat. Sherlock should have cleaned up the mess but it hadn’t occurred to him then—which was another first. What was it about this doctor that caught Sherlock off guard so much to forget his own preferences?
“We should get cleaned up,” John pointed out. Sherlock huffed and sat up, wrapping his arms around John’s waist to hold him in his lap.
“The team is in place, but they lost sight of Sherlock. There was an explosion in the yard, but are awaiting your orders, sir.”
“Really?”
Later that night, as Sherlock fell asleep against John’s shoulder, John couldn’t help but feel it was as if it was the end of the world, as if Sherlock knew it but John didn’t.
Sherlock’s lip twitched with amusement, but he was still looking at him with uncertainty.
“If you keep telling yourself that, then you’ll start blaming him.”
The two were what looked like a deep conversation, although Sherlock’s eyes flickered from Florence’s face to John’s, as if unsure with what was going on, but he did look like himself—he looked uncomfortable talking with a stranger, and as if he was on the verge of a boredom pout.
John leaned back. “Now about my surprise…”
Sherlock smiled, and watched John leave.
John huffed, but sat down anyway, clenching his jaw. He rotated his body until he was facing Sherlock. Sherlock reached forward and caressed his cheek with his thumb.
Sherlock scooted up until he could easily rest on the table. John leaned closer until his chest was pressed up against Sherlock’s, their cocks back in place. John reached down and stroked Sherlock’s cock a couple times; earning him light moans from the man beneath him.
“You can come in, John,” Sherlock said impassively as his pacing came to a halt; he kept his back to John, not wanting to deduce what the man had planned to say by his very expressive face.
Seriously, you should listen to this song ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbo6NH-3lzo
“This evening, at five!” John shouted back, squeezing his eyes shut briefly. He lowered his gaze, avoiding Sherlock’s piercing eyes.
John looked at him and slowly nodded as he swallowed against a lump in his throat. His eyes started to prickle, but he managed to hold his emotions in.
“Will you be able to…” Sherlock trailed off with uncertainty. Silently, John took the cloth and weakly cleaned below his hips. When he was done, he handed the cloth back to Sherlock, who set it aside. Sherlock washed the soap away, and then turned off the shower.
“You’ll start physical therapy today. It’ll just be stretches though,” Sherlock informed him. John nodded absentmindedly, and tried to focus on that rather than the rising panic.
“Mhm, yes?”
“Er, through a friend,” John mumbled.
“You’ll feel better,” the woman said. John held his mouth shut, but then the man pinched his nose. John held his breath for as long as he could, but the moment he gasped for air, the man held his jaw hard and kept it open. The woman shoved the two pills down John’s throat, deep enough he nearly choked. The man closed his mouth and kept it closed, tightly holding by the jaw. John gagged up the pills us much he could and tried to squirm out of the grasp, when suddenly, the front doors opened and a group of people stormed into the building.
“John…no I’m not—.”
“Massage it,” John said.
“It’s—I, I’m getting in you’re way. You would’ve found Moran if this hadn’t happened to me. If you hadn’t found out and just stayed away, continued tracking Moran, we wouldn’t be here if I—.”
Sherlock looked at Regina, and noticed her whole manner had changed. Her eyes were fierce and her posture was confident, unlike how she was upstairs.
Sherlock sniffed and ran a hand through John’s hair. An ambulance appeared from down the road, and a black truck was following close behind it.
“It’s all over the news. A news chopper flying by filmed the accident and saw John being taken. Where the hell did he go!”
“…John? Can you hear me? Are you alright?”
“Pity you inherited it. Not very proportionate with the rest of your face.”
*            *            *
“Can you try words?”
John stared him down, his face darkening. “You can have an ordinary life, Sherlock, if you want. It can be extraordinary if you make an attempt, but don’t think I’m just going to leave because life has become too hard.” He stepped forward until he was close enough, and then he knelt down and took Sherlock’s hands into his, holding them tight enough so Sherlock wouldn’t pull away. Sherlock avoided his gaze, and bit his lip.
John watched in mild confusion as Sherlock’s eyes flickered over the screen.
Sherlock nodded and looked up, expectantly. “You?”
Enjoy :)
“Yes, you do—” Sherlock continued to try to lift him, but John only squirmed away from his touch, distancing him. He managed to crawl closer to the bed. He pulled himself up and then leaned heavily against the side, holding it tightly to keep him upright.
John cleared his throat. “Alright?” he sighed. His head was starting to hurt, and he knew he was about to fall asleep soon. He blinked heavily and urged himself to keep his gaze on Sherlock.
“Have I…how often am I…” Sherlock trailed off. John glanced at him then looked in front of him.
John cleared his throat and raised his hand to take the mask off, but then Sherlock took his wrist and pulled it away.
Sherlock blinked and his face straightened back to his normal façade. “I couldn’t stand the possibility that you would die and I wasn’t there. I couldn’t do anything to prevent it. I thought that if you died, John,” Sherlock locked is gaze with John’s. “If you died, then all of this would have been for nothing.”
“John?” Sherlock needed clarification that he was okay; or that he will be. The reluctance from John about his condition didn’t extinguish Sherlock’s worries.
“Remind me who you are, John. Every day, please do that for me—.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John sighed. “Fine.”
“Dr. John Willoughby. You must be Dr. John Watson?”
“You sure?”
“What evidence?” Sherlock breathed. “The emails are vague, and only discussing them meeting. John may know what’s going on. I need to find him.”
“It could have be worse,” Sherlock pointed out softly. John looked up and nodded stiffly. He inhaled shakily and leaned against the pillow, trembling slightly from the cool air.
Swiftly, a figure moved past the window in a gliding motion. John flinched backwards and took many steps away from the window. For another second or two, he saw Sherlock looking back at him through the window, looking sad.
John’s movements faltered as he suddenly let out a giggle. He cut himself off and glanced up at Sherlock. Sherlock looked at him with a small grin, and John smiled at him.
“Too short to be the murderer,” Sherlock whispered.
“Don’t bring him up! I mean it Harry!”
“I can’t help but notice. John just moved out last night—.”
*            *            *
“Where’s their tea?”
“It’s likely. It may not have damaged it that much, but the constant state of being under this influence was enough to fool anyone—well, almost,” Sherlock added with a light smirk. John kept his brows furrowed and reached a hand over, attempting to feel Sherlock’s forehead. He grazed it, only for Sherlock to pull back.
“It’s going to be all right,” the voice murmured. Sherlock felt the effects of morphine kicking in again, and just as he managed to open his eyes, he fell back asleep, with the image of John looking down at him.
A heavy touch awakened John some odd hours later. The blinds were still closed, but edged with darkness, indicating it was well into the night. The black lump of the detective had moved closer to him, still in his chair but his feet were on the floor and his upper body was practically draped over the side of bed, overlapping John's arm. With a closer look, John could see a bandage over Sherlock’s neck, and another one peeking out of his collar, leading to his shoulder. The taller man’s face twitched as if dreaming but stayed asleep.
“Are you all right?” he asked calmly. She nodded, her breathing significantly slowing down and becoming more stable. John looked to Sherlock and grinned.
John led Sherlock to his usual lab and indicated that he should sit down. He had texted Molly, who was now waiting by the counter, with supplies with her.
“Obviously.” Sherlock said. He remained quiet, giving John time to comprehend what was going on. He knew John would need time.
Sherlock was further fascinated by this man and decided to go along.
Sherlock huffed with laughter, and then restarted the shower. John watched him until he was in, and then started to leave, before pausing by the door.
He shook his head to clear his thoughts and showered, pointedly ignoring Sherlock standing by. They had showered together countless times, at the same time and one at a time with the other still in the bathroom. But this situation was different, and it wasn’t very comfortable to John. He felt tense through the whole shower, and didn’t like the feeling of being watched.
Sherlock panicked. John was in no shape to swim, but there was no other choice now. He turned back to John and lifted his chin. John remained disoriented, his eyes flickering beyond Sherlock and never focusing.
John let out a sigh and turned on the television. He listened to it for the rest of the morning, and then he finally noticed Sherlock sitting in front of him, in his own chair, staring at him.
John sighed against the bed and looked at the handle hanging above him. He reached for it and pulled himself up. He had realized sitting up made it was easier to breath. He inhaled deeply and sighed again. He looked to the side, noticing the railing was still down. John prepared to move his legs closer to the edge, just to see what would happen.
John walked to the edge, placed the crutches one step lower, and then slowly lowered himself to the step. His arms shook a little, but he still had his balance. He exhaled slowly, and then took another step down, rearranging his sweaty grasp on the handles.
John inhaled and stepped closer. Sherlock instinctively stepped back. If John noticed, he didn’t react.
“Slightly. It’s probably just from the fever…”
“They said you tried speaking,” Sherlock pointed out. “Any luck?”
Sherlock expected the man to walk—limp—away. Instead, the man stood his ground and laughed. “And you are?”
“Mycroft informed me about your tumor and then a few weeks later, while I was…stuck,” Sherlock said the word like venom, obviously bothered that he, the great Sherlock Holmes, was baffled. “Mycroft told me about your surgery and the fact that you signed a DNR and I just couldn’t…” Sherlock’s face faltered a fraction and revealed something: he was ashamed of something John couldn’t quite comprehend.
Canterbury shook his head but remained silent. Sherlock huffed with frustration and stepped back. “Lestrade’s almost here. This case is over.”
John peeked his eyes opened a bit and he managed to catch Sherlock’s. “Oh Sher…”
“472,” Kim piqued up. Mycroft raised his eyebrows and then nodded towards her. “You have a lead, better get on with it. In the meantime, I need to talk to Stan; maybe he’ll know where John has gone, if they were in this together. Sherlock, get dress, you’re coming with me.”
Sherlock’s face was so still. The bruises and cuts on her face were starting to fade, but the presence of them reminded John what he had done. John bit his lip and caressed Sherlock’s cheek, but he pulled away quickly, ashamed. He didn’t deserve Sherlock; if he ever woke up, John swore he’d keep his distance, apologize in however way he could, but didn’t dare to hope Sherlock would forgive him. John exhaled slowly, and then resumed his task.
1:59:59 AM
“When will I be released?” he asked.
“Count backwards from 100 by 7.”
“John!” The detective groaned.
John sighed. “Something remarkable…something I wouldn’t give up for anything.” He paused, allowing Sherlock a moment to respond. Sherlock thought hard, but what could he say? Okay? All right, you’re married, no big deal? But for some reason, it still hurt. He didn’t know what to say, so he said just that.
“Oh, just as predicted. Still looking for a flatmate though,” Sherlock reported as he recalled their last boring conversation. He wasn’t really looking for one, but one would be like Mike and Molly were to him. Convenient.
John paused with unwrapping the parcel on his lap. “You all right?”
“I’ll never use our relationship as an experiment, John,” Sherlock snapped on the other side.
“Just…stay awake till the doctor gets here,” John told him.
“You need to try, John. Don’t count on me; I can’t handle it. The guilt is eating me alive—” Sherlock’s voice shook, but his eyes remained hard. “And for God’s sake, shower! It’s been three days!”
He glanced at the man snuggled against his chest, and realized John was still very much asleep. Voices echoed from the hallway, and he recognized Moran’s.
John began to panic.
He woke up to darkness. His back and head ached, and his stomach churned with hunger. John sighed and stiffly sat up. He wasn’t up for cooking or preparing anything, but tea sounded good for now. He reached for his crutches and stiffly walked out of the room. The broken cup hadn’t been cleaned up yet. John half-heartedly realized he didn’t know what day it was.
“And Anthea?”
The jerking lasted for nearly a minute, and then slowly came to a stop. The nurse, Vanessa, hurried in, and went to the other side of the bed. She helped turn him back over onto his back, and then checked his vitals.
Sherlock walked down the hall towards John’s door, but then paused and leaned against the window, his back to John. John furrowed his eyebrows and tried to sit up, however a tingle of pain shot through his body, and he immediately stopped the effort. Growing frustrated and even more confused, John tried to raise his hand in order to catch Sherlock’s attention, but he only managed to twitch his hand, and then it remained still.
John was hunched over on the bed, the blanket bunched up at his waist over his legs. He was clutching his bandaged shoulder with his right hand, nearly clawing at it and trying to press against the wound. His eyes were squeezed shut and he was taking in short breaths through his nose.
“Right…so is it just Florence, or could all of these people be drugged?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John nodded, and smiled with relief. He leaned forward and rested his head against Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock rested his check against John’s temple.
Sherlock nodded, and John looked at him, widening his eyes slightly.
Here's chapter 2. As the fic goes on, the chapters should get longer :)
Sherlock clenched his jaw and knelt down. The man’s hair was matted with blood, which was already encircling his head and towards Sherlock’s shoes. He grabbed the hair and pulled. It didn’t budge, and he pulled again, banishing his doubt to the back of his head.
“And I don’t want to be here,” Sherlock pointed out.
John pulled back just enough to catch his breath. “I’m sorry I had to work today.”
John gaped on the detective, bewilderment written on his face, then apprehension, and then a combination of relief and resentment.
“John…” Sherlock whispered hesitantly, and then clenched his jaw. He continued to look at him in silence, his eyes flickering. And then, with a flourish, he stood up and put his coat on.
The denial was gone in a flash. It was there only for a moment, clear as day. The denial could still be still there, but buried deep within, only as if to hold on to the seed of hope that Sherlock was alive, otherwise without it, the impact may just kill him right then and there.
“Yeah?” John furrowed his eyebrows.
“STOP!”
“Crippled—”
to bring harm on people. He trusted you and he doesn’t trust easily.”
John stood up slowly and reached for his gun, which he had Mycroft pack with his clothes (and kept it by the armchair during the day). He cautiously approached the door and looked through the peephole. His back relaxed slightly, and then he opened the door to a middle aged man holding a brown leather bag.
“Shit—,” John gasped as he lowered his head. Sherlock reached for him and pulled him out of the view of the window; he wrapped his arm around his waist and lifted him upwards.
John nodded. Sherlock nodded back and started to head to the door, putting his coat on.
They sat there in silence for several moments, and then it happened again. Months without another hint, Sherlock legs tingled, and he could feel the hair rising from the cold even though he was dressed in fairly thick sweatpants.
Sherlock smirked. “Later,” he said, and leaned back to kiss his partner.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed. “I’m here…to see you John.”
“No,” Sherlock interrupted, raising his voice. His eyes flickered apologetically once he saw John flinch. He continued though, with a quieter voice. “You can be all right without having to be sedated—.”
“John?”
“I don’t see the point. We’re together. There must be another way.”
“Just give him a moment.” He heard his brother tell the medics. They hummed in response but hovered close by.
Sherlock looked at the man in horror. “What the hell are you doing? John it’s me—.”
“Yes, Sherlock.”
Sherlock straightened up and clenched his fists. “You worked for Moriarty.”
“We don’t have to do that…pretend it’ll be something special and last—where we exchange details, pretend we care,” Sherlock hurriedly said, despite his body’s spark of interest, much to his own surprise.
John hummed, causing Sherlock to pause and look at him. John blushed and bit his lip. He looked down his body and then back at Sherlock, raising an eyebrow in questioning.
*            *            *
John’s eyes widened and he audibly gasped. He was wide awake now, and as he pulled away from the bed to get a fuller look, his hand pulled away from Sherlock, who was the one touching his hand. Sherlock sighed. He parted his mouth to speak, but couldn’t quite pronounce a word right away.
“Look, this is the one time I will be watching. But I won’t interfere,” Lestrade said slowly. “Give him hell.”
John nodded stiffly but opened his mouth and continued to speak. “I love you.” He breathed out steadily.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I think you should pick—.”
Sherlock continued. “I promise John…that you
Lestrade looked briefly but didn’t acknowledge John.
“She needs to be informed by this, they’re still legally married. Better from you than from the telly. Just do what I ask; I’ll explain everything later.”
“Everything will be fine.” Sherlock said for the umpteenth time.
John turned to Sherlock, tensing up slightly. The look on Sherlock’s face caught him off guard, however the tension immediately dissolved.
John shrugged. “Probably nothing. It was just a dream.”
“Get something else,” John rasped. “I'll just throw it up anyway. Injection would be better.”
“Hello Sherlock,” a voice echoed from behind him. “Off to Molly’s lab?”
Sherlock eyed her carefully.
“Please say something,” John said after a minute.
“No it wasn’t. Conveniently for Canterbury, they had run out a few days ago too, and it wasn’t in the ones we tested, just the ones from that pharmacy—the ones that are meant for Alzheimer patients.”
“Would it have been the last?”
“I’m here to see John.” Sherlock replied in that it’s-obvious-you-must-be-some-kind-of-an-idiot tone of his.
“Come here, then, what’s the matter?” he asked softly as he picked her up.
“Vic-tor?” John called after him. The man turned around and faced him.
Sherlock tilted his head up, his eyes glistening against the dim light.
“Do you have physical therapy today?” Sherlock asked.
“I’m okay,” John managed to say in a hoarse whisper. “Go back to sleep.”
“I’ve got to go. But I’ll be back soon,” he said with a smirk. He climbed off and fixed himself as Sherlock buttoned his shirt.
“John…” Sherlock choked out as he tried to stumble forward, but a strong pair of hands held him back, tightening their grip.
Dr. Robbins took a moment to listen to John’s heart, and read the monitor before answering. “His fever spiked. He may already have an infection, so we’ll take a blood test to see what kind before administering antibiotics.”
“Get some rest, John. You’ll feel better soon.” Mary slowly began to walk away. “I’ll be back soon, I promise.”
John grinned and kissed his temple. “Be right back.”
“Please hurry, Mycroft.”
Sherlock kept his gaze and opened his mouth to say something when John interrupted. “I’m going to have Lestrade do a drugs bust tomorrow. I’ll feel better once it’s done.”
This chapter is short, but I think it's still good enough. Technically it was going to be attached to chapter 12, but I really liked that ending as a last cliffhanger.
“Mycroft—.” Sherlock started to snap.
“I’ll help you into them.” John was very insistent than usual, and nearly forced Sherlock into a sitting position. Sherlock pouted, but put the shorts on, since he couldn’t exactly run off.
John chuckled but then cut it off, grimacing in pain. They limped down the hallway, but then John pulled him back, and entered the bathroom, limping on one foot before collapsing onto the toilet seat.
Sherlock hesitated and gulped. “I got shot.”
Sherlock nodded as John headed up the stairs, and once he heard the shower turn on, he wheeled to the foot of the stairs to keep an ear out.
Mycroft was taken aback from the politeness, but didn’t get a chance to speak as Sherlock turned on his heal and walked in a rush to the elevator.
John startled awake to see Sherlock hovering by his bedside, and Vanessa leaning over him. He started to turn onto his side, but then a sharp pain jolted through his side. The room blurred slightly, and Vanessa’s voice sounded far away.
“Sherlock I think it’s best you have a bath. Wash your body at least, you’ll feel better.”
“I want to know if we can get through this,” Sherlock said, his voice shaky. He swallowed tightly and looked up, looking away from John’s gentle gaze. “Can we?”
A medic placed a manual oxygen mask over John’s mouth as another cut his jumper open. He applied something to his chest before pressing the paddles to them. They yelled to each other, and then zapped John with the charger. John remained unresponsive, and the medics repeated their actions, giving him breaths and defibrillating him two more times before stabilizing his heart.
Before he could respond however, John interrupted his thoughts.
something if I wasn’t a damn cripple!” Sherlock bellowed the last worst, snapping it with venom as he threw his cup against the wall, shattering it and spraying tea everywhere.
“Shot, you were shot…” Sherlock stuttered. He sat up quickly and reached for John. John shifted away, shaking his head.
“Where’s John?” She demanded.
John scoffed lightly. “Then what’s bothering you? Please, talk to me.” John inhaled deeply and cleared his throat. “All I want,” he started in a whisper. “Is to hold you…and kiss you, but I can’t. So please, just talk to me, Sherlock. Please.”
~Erin
A sudden explosion from the back of the boat sent John to the floor. He groaned as he lied there for a moment. The explosion was strong enough to cause miniature leaks throughout the boat. The boat trembled and the lights flickered dimly. Fortunately, the damage wasn’t strong enough to sink the boat.
“Tricky. Any news on John?”
“No, stay alive John.” Sherlock said firmly. “I’m right here, you recognized me. You know it’s me, John!”
“Who?”
After about a minute, Sherlock straightened up.
The time period so far: it's now dawn/early morning, yesterday morning John was attacked, then they had lunch/hallucination scene, then car accident then kidnapped so it's been about 24 hours
comments are the best :)
“Sherlock?”
“Like what?”
John frowned and then leaned forward. “Sherlock, do you know who I am?”
One optioned remained—well two, but Sherlock knew John would be angry (and disappointed) if he came home to find Sherlock high. It felt different, to consider someone else’s feelings, but Sherlock didn’t like how he felt when he disappointed John.
“It’s fair—”
Sighing with annoyance, John slumped in the chair, and began to think. Suddenly, the door opened, and Sherlock walked in with a hesitant stride, keeping the door opened behind him. John looked up and raised his eyebrows, expectantly.
Sherlock gave Mycroft a look, who nodded. “So John is innocent. How? The pictures seem real enough. Kim, do you have the recordings from his statement.”
“You apparently have recovered some of your sensory back in your legs. Let me run some tests to show you…”
An envelope caught John’s eye, and on the side, was Lestrade’s name, and the Scotland Yard seal. It was dated the end of December, just around the day Sherlock was diagnosed. John tried to think of what Lestrade would send to them, and then remembered.
Sherlock ignored him. “Next you’ll be reminding me that ‘caring is not an advantage’. I’d love to prove you wrong.”
Sherlock shrugged and tossed the book to the side. “Must have deleted it, then. The universe is rarely so lazy, after all.”
John was motionless in the bed, but his eyes were slowly moving beneath his lids.
“Mary,” she introduced herself. “I just tagged along.”
“Because, I’m fine, John. We’re fine—,”
“Hansel and Gretel,” Sherlock added.
John hadn’t really seen it this close or for this long, except in his nightmares. It had only been five days since he had surgery, but he had been plagued with them every night, unfortunately with Sherlock right by his side. But on the bright side of all things traumatizing, Sherlock hadn’t asked about the nightmares. He simply comforted John until he was calm, and stayed awake as John fell back asleep. John knew Sherlock didn’t go back to sleep, but he didn’t question him. Sherlock didn’t seem to know the context of the nightmares at least—the gruesome gore was one thing, the black-and-white blame that encased John’s mind during the dreams was nightmarish and another issue all on its own.
“Tea?”
“Probably not. She seemed like she wanted to go from then on. Worried about me…or something.”
Sherlock’s phone rang again, but he ignored it. He snuggled against John and was just starting to press chaste kisses against his neck, when it rang again. John groaned and started to reach for it when Sherlock took his hand away.
“Yes—.”
Recalling on that day sent a shiver down John’s spine and he bit his lip, suddenly feeling his eyes fill. A year ago, he would never have guess they would be in this situation it was almost unbelievable.
Sherlock looked apologetic for a moment. “Trying not to get squished. Or chopped up.”
“What a-bout Greg?” John asked.
“I know.” Sherlock kissed his lips again, and John started to wrap his arms around the taller man when a voice spoke from behind.
“I…I didn’t think you would wake up. Victor had told me to prepare myself, and I just couldn’t take it anymore.”
*            *            *
Relief flooded the detective’s mind as he reached for the form and pen. John signed it as neat as he could managed and then sighed comfortably back in the bed.
“I can come by later, during your physical therapy.”
John breathed heavily against Sherlock’s back. Sherlock’s breath was hot against his skin, sending shivers down his flushed body. John sighed contently and parted his eyes. Sherlock was looking at him in a dazed, unfocused way, but his face was relaxed. John grinned at the sight and trailed his fingertips lightly against Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock shifted closer and grazed his nose against John’s cheek.
Surprised, the man’s grip on John slackened and John managed to pull away. He coughed up the pills and tried to catch his breath. People in black suits, some of them armed, gathered around the room and directed the staff to one side of the room, and placed the patients in the sitting room. John leaned back against the sofa, breathing deeply and confused with what was happening. He closed his eyes, begging for some peace in this hellhole.
“I can get the nurse, unless you’d want a male nurse—.”
John turned around and faced him. “To me, they are. Just because you don’t have to worry about them, doesn’t mean they just vanish into thin air!”
Sherlock hurried down the hall, and turned a corner, only to stop his tracks. There were a couple of men lying on the far end, and someone was limping towards him, carrying a gun in one hand and leaning heavily on the other against the wall. He was shirtless and covered with sweat and blood. Sherlock raised his hand and aimed it at the man as he slowly stepped closer.
That is, until a scream snapped Sherlock out of his thoughts.
“You’re not—no you’re not dead!”
“No!” Sherlock replied without taking his gaze away from John. “He wants to live. He wants to—.”
Sherlock nodded but kept his gaze upon the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You want me by myself? You don’t worry anymore?” John mocked.
“The surgery was hectic, I haven’t eaten much; I’m starving.” He nudged Sherlock slightly as he swallowed. “What did you do? I can see you’ve been in your dressing gown all day.”
John didn’t get a chance to confront Sherlock until they arrived back at their flat. It was past evening, and John couldn’t decide whether he should sleep or eat—or shower. Sighing, John hung up his coat and watched Sherlock hover by his violin, his brows drawn in thought.
“You should leave yours too,” Sherlock added. “And your gloves. Lestrade will probably be here shortly, since our hour is almost up. He should see it and know where we’ve gone.”
John glared at him. “This morning wasn’t bad!”
“I’ll be fine,” John said again, his voice firm. “When will I be…” he trailed off, but Sherlock knew what he was talking about.
“That’s the plan, yes.” Sherlock remained fixated on John. “John.”
“Moriarty’s dead.”
Once inside, John pushed Sherlock gently down onto the bed. John stepped forward and stood between his knees. He started kissing Sherlock, wrapping his arms around his neck and holding him close. While he trailed his lips down Sherlock’s jaw and to his neck, he slowly started to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt. Sherlock moaned against John’s touch and took over for him, stripping himself just as John started to trail his tongue down Sherlock’s chest.
John screamed out in pain. Mary gasped and was pushed aside as a few staff members rushed in and surrounded John. John couldn’t move his shoulder and assumed he must have dislocated it. He started to move more in the jacket, but didn’t get a chance to release the sleeves completely as a nurse stuck a needle through his neck. Blackness swarmed his vision and then completely.
Sherlock scoffed weakly. “I’m not dying—.”
“What about our sex holiday?”
Sherlock relaxed beside him. “You’re being treated for an infection. You have to stay for at least another week—.”
“Why not?”
Doctor mode kicked in and John found his hands unbuckling himself and reaching for Sherlock’s buckle.
“Greg,” he greeted. “Tea?”
Lestrade led the way to the top balcony. Immediately, Sherlock scanned the area and view of Scotland Yard; it was a clear view from up there, with not cameras around.
“Why. Did. You. Do. It?”
Sherlock. He wanted to talk about the cases, have dinner in between cases, and nap together on the sofa,
John snapped his head up and gasped. The room was empty though. Sherlock wasn’t there. John breathed slowly and looked down at the sink. He turned the water on and splashed his face. He closed his eyes and rubbed at them before opening to look at himself fin the mirror. Sherlock looked back.
“Perhaps he’s giving you time.”
With a dreaded hunch, John rolled Sherlock’s sleeve up his arm and found quite a few telltale markings, clearing from a needle.
John remained unresponsive whilst Sherlock stayed in the corner; his face expressionless but his eyes swimming still with unshed tears.
“Time range?”
“I should take him home…”
“He’s off the grid. I haven’t been able to locate him for the past two weeks! John’s surgery is tomorrow morning. I have eight hours. Mycroft can you—”
“Sherlock, wait, what if someone walks in?” John hurriedly asked. He didn’t want Sherlock to apologize for flinching, nor did he want to apologize for jerking away. John wasn’t sure if he pulled away
John walked into the sitting room, fully dressed, to see Sherlock already with his cup of tea. John looked to the table beside his chair to see his own, and quietly smiled at Sherlock as a thank you.
John felt a pang of guilt, and then Victor leaned forward, softening his face.
“An hour ago, John thought I didn’t love him. I tried to tell him but he just didn’t understand.  And now
“Not a problem.” John replied with a charming—
“It-it’s okay it’s just…ugh, above the knee. I think it’s just a graze. I can walk, I can—.” John’s face tightened with pain. Sherlock’s hands traveled to his thigh; blood was just barely seeping through the man’s jeans.
“Doctor?”
I hallucinated
Sighing, he dried himself off and then wrapped the towel around his waist the best he could, and then reached for the curtain, pulling it open. The wheelchair wasn’t far, so Sherlock took hold of the railing and stood without a second thought.
“Why did you stop visiting?” John whispered. He remembered Victor’s answer, but he really wanted to hear it from Sherlock.
John smiled. “Of course.”
who’s afraid of losing sight of you because once I do, God forbid a hallucination appears and I make a fool of myself.” John inhaled sharply, clenching his jaw tightly.
was a doctor! He knew the body could associate a certain touch to certain events, which would explain why John would flinch every time Sherlock’s hand trailed to his stump. He knew that; he had told himself before already, so why hadn’t anything changed?
“Anything from Stan yet?”
The kettle hissed, bringing John out of his thoughts. He prepared his tea, and reached for a second cup, only to pause. Should he make Sherlock’s tea? Would it be like a peace offering?
“It’s not John,” Sherlock sighed, relieved.
John buried his nose into Sherlock’s curls, breathing in his scene. “I love you too.” He inhaled deeply, and then thought of something. Without thinking it through, he took of his tag and clipped it around Sherlock’s neck.
“You don’t know?”
He settled down, urging himself to sleep, when he heard footsteps in the hallway. The door creaked open and the shadow of John emerged. He stayed still for several seconds before leaving, and as Sherlock fell asleep, he realized he could still hear John’s breathing from the hallway.
Lucy shook her head again. “He was respected at his work, many came around and helped out when we found out.”
Sherlock and Mary stepped closer, and looked. “That’s Bradley Stan.” Mary confirmed.
He took a step forward while leaning heavily on the crutch. “I know,” John muttered. “I don’t want to be like this…I want a lot back…” he paused. “I’ve lost—everything.
Sherlock looked at him, and seemed to have communicated silently with his eyes, because then Victor left.
“What happened to…” His brows furrowed.
Lucy nodded.
John was thrashing in the bed, his face red with tears streaming down his cheeks. He was curled into a ball and faced the door, then clutched his head. His back and shoulders shuddered, and Sherlock noticed Margaret and Regina were speaking to him in turns through the barrier.
He kept his eyes closed, and his face burned with shame.
“The seventh car should be here, but it clearly isn’t.” he said impatiently.
“Yeah, well you’ve been in coma for quite a while, git,” John remarked with a slight annoyed tone, although internally he berated himself for it; what right did he have to criticize Sherlock, however teasingly it was?
Sherlock huffed. “I know. It’s getting tedious.”
Doctor Grey pushed Sherlock aside and aided John as he seized. It was quicker than the others, but as it lasted, Sherlock hovered by, panicking. It came to a halt and then Grey began preparing John for transport. “He can’t wait any longer! Let’s go!”
“…And so all you have to do is nod or shake your head; use your expressions. Do you think you can do that?”
“You’re at the first state. The next stage has to do with the brain. It’d be best to sedate you—.”
Sherlock sat on the examination table, after having the CAT scan, and was awaiting a procedure examination. He sighed agitated.
“Everything all right?” Sherlock asked after noticing John’s posture stiff.
sorry this is so late... hope you enjoy! This had intended to be a short fic, so the angst is quick but there.
John giggled and placed his arm around Sherlock’s middle. “You haven’t forgotten any of them, I don’t see why you’d start now.” He turned on his side and started pressing faint kisses along his shoulder and collarbone. Sherlock sighed contently and brought his arms around his husband, bringing him closer until he had John pressed up against his bare chest.
John tensed beside him.
“What’s happening?” Sherlock asked, ignoring that his voice was shaking.
“Fine.” John handed him his cup and then sat in the armchair.
“You fell through a window,” Sherlock provided.
John winced and looked at Victor in alarm. Victor was towering over him, and placing an oxygen mask over John’s mouth.
“You’re already an idiot.” Sherlock remarked lightly.
John swallowed tightly and grinned assuringly back at Vanessa as she reattached him to everything.
Chapter 6 will be posted on Sunday. I'm editing it now and it's not really going smoothly, but I'll try my best for Sunday. I'm still in the middle of chapter 7 so the next few chapters may be posted a few days later.
“What would you do, if the thing that defines who you are was taken away?” Sherlock asked.
, he told himself fiercely.
Grey decided to interrupt. “Look, as long as your conscious, the decisions is yours. If you don’t sign this, then you’ll have to sign a ‘do not resuscitate form’. Do you know what that is?”
“Yes, well, it is up to you mostly, to tell John or not, but either way he will be—.”
Sherlock tried opening the door again, and then he went around to the other side. John started to get into the shower before Sherlock walked in, but then he paused as Sherlock spoke.
“Only a fool would believe that, Sherlock. Although I suppose it’s for the best.”
Eventually, John made it to the bedroom, and pushed the door open, noticing it was kept ajar. He walked in, about to speak up, when a low whine interrupted his thoughts. He looked toward the bed and noticed Sherlock was still under the covers, his eyes squeezed shut and his fists holding tightly to the duvet.
“And for that, I’m grateful, Victor.” Sherlock met his eyes, and nodded once. “But, it’s John. It’s always him.”
Sherlock moved swiftly beside him and looked down. John blinked rapidly, but his vision continued to blur as the room swayed.
“You were…” John encouraged.
“No, he’s not,” Sherlock said. “He’s right behind you.”
“John?” A man revealed himself from the shadows and hurried to the blogger.
John shook his head. “No, I do want you here, I just thought…” he trailed off, and sucked in his cheeks. “You seem bothered by all this. I just thought maybe you’d want a break. I wouldn’t be upset or anything…”
"Hello...ugh, Mycroft, what..." Sherlock's eyes widened as Mycroft spoke over him. "He
John paused by the window and looked out, attempting to give Sherlock privacy. It was cloudy out, but still bright. John swallowed tightly, suddenly desiring a breath of fresh air. He hadn’t been outside at all since he had woken up. Maybe that was what he needed…
*            *            *
“On it, John.”
“I’m not an idiot, Sherlock. I can read people too—”
“She lived with me after she came back,” Lucy said slowly. “You can look anytime, and for as long as you like.”
Sherlock exhaled and leaned forward, resting his forehead against John’s palm. The people around him slowly left, and he barely registered gently hands pushing him into a chair. He didn’t even grasp the words exchanged between Victor and the doctor.
Willoughby doted down some notes and finished typing, and then looked up. “Finally, the words I told you to remember?”
They fell into a some-what comfortable silence. John just started to drift off when Sherlock nudged him back to awareness.
“Ready, John?” Sherlock asked.
*         *         *
John pondered this for a moment. “So the person drugging Mrs. Ellis would probably be the killer?”
“It’s Sherlock’s blood tests. I’m a friend of the doctor’s, and she gave me the results. They show that he’s, well…” she shuffled her feet, and glanced at Sherlock then back at John. “He’s doped up on three different types of benzodiazepines. But I’ve never seen these before…they’ve been manipulated somehow.”
Next chapter will be hopefully next week.
John nodded roughly against Sherlock’s temple. “Yes…close—I’m close—.”
Sherlock slightly relaxed his shoulders, and remained quiet. John continued to breathe deeply as tears still leaked out of his eyes. He kept wiping them away, and clenched the bed sheets as if willing them to stop.
Chapter 2
But it did. It had been only four days. Four days of no hallucinations. Four days that were spent occasionally making love and then fulfilling vital needs such as eating and sleeping. John was a bit surprised that Sherlock wasn’t bored yet and searching for a case. He grinned warmly and snuggled closer to the other man, absorbing the warmth his body was giving off freely. Sherlock stirred beside him and spoke, his baritone voice vibrating against John.
Moran nodded at him once, and then turned on his heals, and walked away, before he called over his shoulder. “I hope you don’t mind me staying here while I do it. It’s nice to see some familiar faces from CTU.” He didn’t wait for a response, and walked down the hall, Kim following close behind.
CHAPTER 1
“Sherlock?” John stepped forward and looked at him. “What is it?”
His eyes were more open, and he looked over the plastic wall in between him and his detective. His eyes started to glisten, and his lip trembled. He sniffed, and looked towards the ground, furrowing his brows.
“Doesn’t she mean anything to you?” John claimed.
“Can you reach?”
“Bye, Sherlock. See you...later.”
John’s balance faltered and he widened his eyes at that familiar phrase. Sherlock halted and looked down at him. John slowly met his gaze, feeling his face pale of color.
“The government never destroys original files. You may change your name, but your real name is written somewhere. So why, why did you change you name?”
“At least let him get dress,” Sherlock said. He was starting to feel unease, but kept his face clear of it. He heard a faint thump from behind him, and without another word, headed back to his bedroom.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “And sleep?”
“Wait, just…” The doctor licked his lips again, but this time with more hesitation rather than flirtation. “Let me buy you a cup of coffee."
John nodded. “Yes. Now go.”
A voice whispered urgently in his mind.
John gaped. “You—.” He clenched his mouth and glared murderously at the detective.

Sherlock raised his eyebrows and shrugged. “Normally I take the lead, so…”
Moran straightened back up, and judging by the look of dread on Sherlock’s face, John knew things were just going to get worse. Moran nodded his head curtly, and just as John registered what was going to happen, it was too late.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea, John,” Sherlock said carefully. John’s lips twitched with a hint of a grin, but shook his head.
John clenched his jaw and gave her a stiff nod.
Sherlock glanced at her. “Where were you while your father was in D.C?”
“Actually you know what, forget that, it’s just the uh, shock talking. I-I’m going to go—.”
John’s eyes remained staring and for a moment Sherlock believed he would stand down. But fury rose deep in John’s blue eyes and the next moment Sherlock found himself on the ground with John on top of him.
“Quite right.” He shook his hand, and then turned to John, stretching out his hand.
"John nodded. “Why are you here?” He asked one final time.
“Hey, Greg, do you, er, I don’t suppose you have anything for Sherlock?”
“I recommend surgery as soon as possible. The seizures could develop a pattern or happen unexpectedly. The tumor is fairly simple to reach, so the surgery won’t be incredibly invasive. We can try to get the whole thing out this time, however, that may require for a longer operation.”
“I’ll find a way out.”
“Ok, ok, just—.”
Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes. Nothing came right away, but he knelt down and looked over the bomb.
The man shrugged. “There’s more to find out once you get to know me.”
The man gently dipped into Sherlock’s entrance and pressed in gently, moving slowly until he was fully settled within him. Sherlock adjusted and then rocked backwards, causing a moan from the man’s lips.
John nodded behind Sherlock.
John managed to eat the yogurt and drink the juice, before he was feeling full. He pushed the table aside, and then sighed.
“How bad was it?” Sherlock asked gently.
A couple of hours later, and after check up after check up with the doctors, Sherlock was back asleep, turned on his side though, indicating he hadn’t fallen back into a coma. John sat down in the chair by the bed and leaned forward, taking Sherlock’s hand in his and tried to keep himself awake through the rest of the night.
Mary and Kim pressed the record button simultaneously, and Mary spoke first.
“May he talk to your mother? Try to see if she saw anyone?”
John shrugged. Mandy placed his arm on the table, and gave him the pencil. He wrapped his fist around it, but his hand started to cramp quickly.
John began to laugh and then tried to cover it up, but Sherlock joined in with a giggle.
“Where’s John?”
Sherlock spoke before John could think of something to say.
“This is Mary Morstan. She’s a computer analyst and intelligence agent, head of her department from CTU. She’ll be the lead representative here, until her boss arrives.”
“Why are you staring?”
He said sternly. His voiced sounded distant, almost as if it echoed in John’s mind more than in the room.
“I need you…it feels like it’s been forever,” John breathed against Sherlock’s lips.
“I’m sorry.” John murmured.
information?”
“Absolutely not,” she retorted, narrowing his eyes. She looked at Lestrade, and his sigh instantly told Sherlock it was out of the question.
Sherlock slowly got up and put his coat on. He turned to John and looked at him with longing.
There was a heavy sigh, and then a muscular arm wrapped around his lower back and rested on his hip. Sherlock held himself still, deciding not to lean into it. Victor removed his arm, and then placed just his palm on the curve of Sherlock’s lower back.
Mary looked at the screen and pointed at the figure. “It’s not him. Look at him. He just has the same face. Does John have a brother?”
John made it to the bow and looked around for Sherlock. He looked out towards the back, and could make out the dinghy floating away, empty. John let out a chilled breath, and then inhaled sharply as he realized the dinghy was diagonally off in the distance, as if they were turning. John turned just in time to see them heading straight into another sailboat, this one anchored and off to the side of them.
