Cas notices, and he stops in front of him, meeting Dean's eyes with his own. He places his right hand on Dean's left shoulder, squeezing it gently as he speaks.
Profess Unto Me- Godstiel s6/7 canon divergent, Master/Slave dynamic, Bottom!Dean Top!Cas, 112k words. Posting to SPNCanonBigBang on July 20th.
Dean’s heart pounded in his chest as he practically launched himself into his room and shut the door behind him, leaning heavily against it as he caught his breath. He hadn’t even realized he’d been holding it until his lungs started burning, and even then he didn’t know how long he’d been holding it. His skin still tingled from Castiel’s touch and he reached up and touched his chin, heaving a sigh and letting his head fall back against the door with a
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and pulled himself up, refusing to meet Castiel’s gaze. He could tell by the man’s body language that he was expecting him to walk away, his shoulders slumping, fingers twitching. Instead, he threw a leg over his lap, wrapping his arms around his neck and pressing their foreheads together. He molded his body to Castiel’s, shifting in his lap, pressing himself against his crotch, sucking in a soft breath as he slowly rubbed himself against his front.
Benny doesn't look at him as he answers. "Yeah, sure thing, brother."
“I’m worried about you,” Same said, sitting across from him in the kitchen.
Currently he was scarfing down a fast breakfast, still bewildered that he actually gets to eat three meals a day, every day. He was seeing Missouri again this morning. She wanted to see how he was doing, check his weight, and whatever else she wanted to poke at. He didn’t exactly relish the idea of going back, but Missouri was comfortable to be around. And she was the only one who knew the extent of the damage.
Sam’s face comes into view through the window, and he lays his arms across it and squints over at Dean. “You look like the Joker.”
“Atta boy,” she said contentedly, giving him a pat on his back. “Well I'm Missouri, and if you need anything at all or just need to talk about anything, you can come to me anytime. Okay, baby?”
His eyebrows furrowed as he gave a, in Dean’s opinion, rude sniff. “Omega,” the Beta said in a very thick Louisiana drawl. Dean nodded stiffly, shifting the bag on his shoulder. He normally would snarl at the term, because he was more than just a hole for Alphas, but he fought to keep civil. It would be really fucking sad if he’d come all this way just to lose a fight with a pack. With them, protocol was everything.
“-In the middle of the kitchen.”
“-then you’re walking around the hallways,” he murmured after a moment’s paused, visibly relaxing when Dean went back to his food. “You’re losing weight.”
There’d been so much going on with them personally that Dean hadn’t really had the time to broach the subject with him. And now when he visited the compound, it was for brief periods of time, and only to visit with Eileen, his pregnant mate.

“He ready for us?” Dean asked, looking over Cas carefully.

Rory wrinkled her nose. “Are you guys gonna, like…
“Good.”
Lisa huffs and tilts her head in his direction.
Dean hardly noticed the third finger, but moaned at the sense of fullness and grinded down more forcefully. He extracted his hand from the Alpha’s cock, earning a
“Well, you’re the first he’s ever brought to this,” Michael shrugged. “I imagine it’s because you two are closer than his previous endeavors.”
One or two chapters left. We still don't know. The surprise is half the fun! :D
It seemed like the drive to Cas’s place was a mere blink, and he sat in the fancy driveway wondering how the hell he got there. He rubbed at his face, growling when his hands came away damp, and got out the car. He didn't bother knocking and walked right in, throwing his bag into the formal living room and stomping upstairs. He paused outside of Castiel’s bedroom door, staring at it for a solid five minutes before he knocked softly.
have stopped the first punch.”
For probably the hundredth time, Dean wonders if Cas meant those words or if they were simply uttered in the heat of the moment, brought on by the haze of afterglow.
“Oh, hell yeah,” Dean said excitedly, bumping the car into gear. “That place is crazy. You ever been there before, Scott?”
Gently, he urges Cas up, for once not feeling any anxiety about telling an alpha what to do. Cas follows him willingly enough, anyway – he lets Dean guide him onto the couch without a single complaint. He lands heavily, yawning, already looking like he’s going to drop back off to sleep at any moment.
He understands why Sam is afraid. Put in his position, Castiel would be too. And there’s a part of him that wants to agree with Sam, even now – wants to tell him that he’s right, that Dean

to feel safe enough to care about anything except his own safety and continued survival.
Filled with a tenderness so soft it’s almost foreign to him, Dean reaches out and cups his hand to Cas’s cheek. The alpha’s eyes slowly drift open; cloudy blue. Awareness creeps in sluggishly, like Dean has found it always does before his coffee. His skin is stubbled and cool under Dean’s touch. The alpha leans into his hand with a small sigh, closing his eyes again.
This close, he can smell the alpha clearly, and even though that should do nothing but make him afraid it actually sort of calms him down. No matter how hard he searches, he cannot find a single sour note in the man’s smell, just like last night.
“A true scholar,” Balthazar snipes, closing the door. He shakes the rain off of his umbrella and closes it, tossing it in the back as he slips into the driver’s seat. He adjusts the rear-view mirror so that he can see the cat a little more clearly.

He has to wonder where and when Dean learned that, why he needed to know how to cook. Who he was cooking for. It would have to have been when he was a child, before he’d gone into the trade, because his paperwork hadn’t listed cooking as a skill. He thinks he’s beginning to understand where “Sammy” might have fit in Dean’s life, and the implication makes his chest ache.

“You smell like me,” the alpha rumbles, and he sounds damned pleased about it. “Why do you still smell like me?”

still has flashes of those same hopeless feelings; the uncertainty, the doubt, the inadequacy. Lost, drowning, with no clue how to claw his way out of his own desperation, let alone pull another person out with him.
Dean snaps his mouth shut over his protests. Cas has a sort of fire in him that he has never seen in the alpha before. He’s more determined about

say how badly he wanted that person to be Cas. How badly it hurt that it was looking less and less likely now. “But if you want one, like, the natural way, go right ahead. I don’t fucking care what you choose to do.” And yes, perhaps that was harsh.
And, um??? WOW??? The response to the last chapter was fucking... you guys blew me away. I've never had that many comments on a chapter, and it was so cool to see y'all enjoying my writing. I'm glad you like the direction I'm taking there! And rest assured that I will reply to all y'all's comments as soon as I get the chance. I hope you guys like this chapter too, even though it's less exciting :)

“Are you alright in there?”
“Kinda figured,” he replies gruffly, his eyes closed, “considering she clocked me just now and ain’t said a word.”
Irritation fading, Dean softens. He reaches out and tugs one of Cas’s hands off the wheel, holding it in his own instead. He can feel the tension bleed out of the alpha almost instantly. “I know I’m not alone, Cas.”
“Sam,” he says carefully. He doesn’t
Hearing it had always made Dean feel like a failure. It’s no different now.
“There are quite a few directions we can take,” he says, laying out the roadmap for Dean with fire in his eyes, “as far as how to get started. We can look over different plans that Jody’s put together, and decide which you’d like to take.”
Cas probably senses some of that nervousness, because his voice softens a little. “There are some things that are fairly simple, and don’t require anything except the proper paperwork. Balthazar and Jody take care of that, for the most part – they’ll have already sent the initial request through. Once it’s approved, we can start to send in the rest of the paperwork.”
“Not gonna avoid that shit forever,” he snaps, irritated that they even have to be worried about something like this. “Don’t look at me like that, man.”
“What
“But once you pull the rug out? They don’t… revolt?” he asks carefully, trying to keep his tone casually curious.
Benny’s voice is careful now. He’s undoubtedly sensed the tension in Castiel’s voice. “Sure, brother.” He pauses again. “Or we could just do this now.”
He knows that the omega cares for him. But he also suspects that Dean, given time and sufficient cause, would care for anyone in his life in the exact same way. His soul is pure. His love, unfiltered. Castiel himself is not special – he is simply the first kind person Dean has known in far too long. The first person that Dean has had any reason to trust in years.

when he isn’t even really upset. But it doesn’t. Hand-holding is tame in comparison to some of the ways he and the alpha have touched, and it’s natural and comfortable enough that he doesn’t feel the urge to question it.

that Dean realizes he’s made a mistake.
For once, it’s Dean who does the gentle arranging, Dean who draws closer and wraps himself around the man he loves in a slow embrace. It’s Dean who guides Cas’s nose to his neck, Dean who runs his fingers through the alpha’s hair. It comes easier than he ever thought it would to tell Cas to breathe, to gently press him close. To tell him that everything is okay, that they’re both safe, that he’s here.

After reading it he stepped out to thank Missouri, but she had left the motel. How am I going to tell Sam? Walking into their small room he sat down on his bed, placing his head in his hands. Now what? Bobby was gone just as much as their Dad was and now he would be gone forever… He wasn’t Father of the year but he did his best with them, but now everything would change. No more moving around place to place, they would live at Bobby’s now, but Sam would be happy about that. He always liked staying with Bobby, it was the only home he ever knew besides the backseat of the Impala. The phone rang, he quickly picked it up “Hello?” “Dean. His phone’s been cut off, I asked around though, it’s not looking good son.” “I-I know, I got a note from Dad saying he died, from a lady named Missouri, she gave me the keys to the impala. I guess she drove it up here?” “I’m sorry son, Missouri’s a psychic your father met after your mother died, he set it up to where if he ever died working a case she would find you and Sam and leave you the Impala and some money to get you here. Come home, we’ll figure this out son.” Home, the word sounded nice, but it never had any meaning in his mind. His home is where his mother died and he hadn’t called anything home since. But if they were going to label something Bobby’s was the closest thing to it now. Breaking down he sobbed before containing his cries to not wake Sam up, “Dean? You alright?” Swallowing his grief he nodded into the receiver, “Yeah I was just uh nothing, we’ll be there as soon as possible.” “Can you make the drive?” “Yes sir, we’ll be fine. See you soon” with that Dean hung up the phone. Now Sam would grow up without a mother or a father, and he was going to do everything he could to fill the roles of both. “Sammy” he said nudging the teenager. The younger Winchester woke with a start and jumped out of bed, “What? Is there another case?” “No, no it’s not that. We gotta go. Pack your stuff, there’s a granola bar you can eat until we can get some grub.” “Why? What’s going on?” “Don’t ask questions, I’ll explain everything on the road, just pack up.” He nodded and began to pack the few items he had into his duffle, “Dean? Did you ever reach Dad? I had a dream that he was on his way here.” “Uh no Sammy he’s not but we’re going to Bobby’s so pack up.” “Cool.” After they finished packing he grabbed his bags and set out for the Impala, loading them into the back he heard his brother come up behind him. “What’s the car doing here?” “I’ll explain in the car, we got a lot of miles to cover though so come on.” Understanding finally what was going on Sam nodded before getting in. “Dean?” “Yeah Sammy?” “Dad’s dead isn’t he?” Nodding he started the car, “It’s okay. Bobby will take care of us.” “Yeah you’re right.” Sam didn’t cry or even ask any more questions, he only stared at the window. “I gotta get gas and some grub for the road. Do you want anything?” “No” was all he said before pulling out a book to read. This was going to be hard on him, but he wouldn’t have to face it alone. Dean was going to take all of the weight he could carry for his little brother, he’s too young to have go through this. Checking out with a few items he walked back to the car and handed Sam a water. “Did you eat that granola bar?” “Yeah.” “Good, I bought some snacks in case you get hungry. You can go back to sleep if you want, I won’t play any ACDC or anything.” “No it’s okay, you like that music, and it won’t bother me.” Deciding against it he started the car up. Sioux Falls was about 300 miles from where they were and that meant about two and a half hour drive if Dean was driving. When they were halfway there he stopped for a bathroom break. Sam was now asleep in the back curled up under Dad’s jacket with a book under his head.
Cas parts his lips and clings tighter to Dean, and grabs his face. Twisting himself around, he straddles his hunter, wrapping his legs around Dean’s waist. He pulls away from the kiss and looks defiantly into olive green eyes and smiles smugly.
They laughed for a small moment and in an instant Dean closed the space between their lips and kissed him.
Despair and guilt racked his body and made him go rigid all over again. Was the answer that simple? Did he not look at the solution that was starting him dead in the face because he was dumb or because he was avoiding the conversation of what he was.
Cas wakes up in a daze, the room is dark and he can hear chains rattling around him and screams echoing. “Hello Castiel” a smooth British voice echoes,
The first few times it happened, Sam had sat on his bed with understanding in his eyes.
“Dick is right but what was it?”
Cas slept the rest of the way home on his shoulder. It almost seemed wrong to wake him up…
was written on the board in cursive, that’s a weird name. “Good morning Class, my name is Mr. Carver but you can call me Chuck. This is English 101 and it’s going to be a fun year.  Most English classes teach you about Shakespeare and punctuation but not this course. This year in English you’re going to learn about becoming a writer of your own life. Now I can’t promise there won’t be any punctuation lessons here and there but I promise we won’t focus too much on it. Now before we start we have a couple of new students, so make sure you make them feel welcome. Now let’s get started.” When a medium built student sat next to him he groaned, he really didn’t want any problems from the popular crowd trying to force him in their group. “Hey man” the student drawled out with a southern accent, “Name’s Benny, I take it your new?” “Uh yeah. Dean, nice to meet you” he said before shaking the extended hand. “So what position you play?” “I used to play linebacker but I quit because the coach is a real douche. Do yourself a favor and don’t try out. You’ll never have a social life again.” “Oh alright I wasn’t planning on it but thanks.” Smiling at his new acquaintance he went back to paying attention to Chuck. When the bell rang he was grateful, Benny was nice but he wasn’t too keen on making any friends just yet. “Hey Dean wait up. If you don’t have plans for lunch you can eat with me and my friends.” “Thanks but I promised my little brother we’d eat together.” Lie. “He can come too.” Not having another excuse he nodded and left the conversation but was stopped by a red head dressed in skinny jeans and a graphic t. “Hey there. You must be the new kid. Name’s Charlie. Benny’s right you have to eat lunch with us. You’re a total babe, and the preps will be all over that.” Smiling at her he nodded and tried again to leave. Heading to his next class he groaned when he remembered it was math. He hated math, he was never good at it, and it made him feel like an idiot. Slipping in quietly to the back he smiled upon realizing the class was empty. Or it was until girls started to flood the room and gawk at him. He could hear their not so silent whispers about him and how cute he looked and if he was a bad boy because of the leather jacket. Completely caught up in his own world he didn’t realize that the desk’s had names on them.
Dean had to admit, this movie was actually pretty good. He’d never would have expected that they would
He looked at him in the mirror with crinkly green eyes. But he didn’t know what to say back. This was usually about the time he would throw in the familiar “you’re my brother Cas.” line that he would say. It wasn’t said so he addressed it.
“Hey. I’ll have you know that my true form is about the size of the Chrysler building which is very ‘Big and Tall’ as you say.”
“No Dean, I don’t I was just joking, but you should know that I don’t care if you want to get on those sites.”
No, no, no. Bless
Soon Eliza would be born and they would all be settled in their new home. Shortly after buying it Dean went out and bought a grill and some potted plants for his new garden. Their home now had furniture and was mostly decorated but they had gotten distracted a few times, and Dean showed him exactly what he meant about the kitchen floor. It was surprisingly comfortable lying there in Dean’s arms against the cool floor, and lately he had been sleeping now and again. Now all they had left to do was to decorate the baby room and their room, as a surprise Cas picked out plaid bedding for their room, knowing it to be a Winchester trait. Surprisingly Dean also bought something that day, a swing set. Their daughter wasn’t even born yet and he was already spoiling her, and he couldn’t be happier. Gabriel wasn’t even showing that smarmy bastard, but they loved him and accepted him into the family. Never had Cas and Dean seen their brothers happier now that they were all a family. They would continue to live in the bunker until the baby was born, and Sam and Gabriel had solved more cases in the last couple of months than they had in a long time. Sam chalked it up to the mark and unrequited love but what did he know he was just as smarmy as Gabe was. It’s truly what made them perfect for each other. At the baby store they were having a difficult time figuring out what brand to buy, “Do we buy Greco or this other French brand?” “The one that is best for the baby is all I care about, not brands.” “You’re right. Now what about a baby carriage? Do we need one of those?” “Yes I think so. As well as some of these adorable tiny shoes, I forget how small babies are. Ah she’ll be just beautiful I can see it already.” “Me too babe.” Kissing for a brief moment before adding it to their list they checked out and left the store. “Dean, do you think we will have to buy a minivan? I seen it on TLC that a car is not reliable transportation for an infant.” Dean’s face went white and he closed his eyes. Trying not to crack with laughter he sealed his mouth shut awaiting Dean’s reaction. “Babe, I know you mean well but what?!” Touching his arm he chuckled “Relax honey I was only kidding, I don’t even know what TLC is, Sam told me to say it and to watch your horrified reaction. With the proper car seat she’ll be safe in the impala. Don’t worry I would never make you give up your first baby.” Dean sighed and relaxed before pouting, “Don’t do that! I told Sam that in confidence!” “Hanging out with Gabe has really turned him into quite the little prankster.” “It maybe the other way around. Or both. Who knows? They’re so compatible it’s sickening. I mean I don’t love to garden and you don’t love cars and we’re perfect together. Being too alike is just un-natural. He’s happy and I actually love that little trickster now.” “I’m glad you feel that way babe, because I was thinking that if anything ever happened to us knowing our old line of work that Sam and Gabe would raise the kids.” “Kids?” “You don’t want more than one?” “Of course I do, I just didn’t know you did. Let’s wait until Eliza is a little older so were not so overwhelmed though, okay?” He nodded in agreement as they loaded up the back seat with their shopping items, he couldn’t wait to show Sam the little moose outfit they bought Eliza. They knew it would make Uncle Sammy happy that they would have an outfit to match him. Most of the clothing was plaid, some was pink and girly, but of course Dean wanted Eliza to have some rocking clothes. He bought her an ACDC, Batman, and Metallica onesie to wear. Cas didn’t mind of course, he loved that their daughter would be just like the two of them but he did worry about a female presence in her life. Then he remembered Gabriel, he had started to refer to himself as Uncle Sally and none of them could be more pleased. It was all very fitting, Uncle Sally and Sammy would hunt monsters and Dean and he would raise a family in the suburbs. Of course the house would have a demon trap under every carpet and at night salt around the windows and doors and after his grace faded they would place sigils to ward off any angels who weren’t Gabriel. However to his surprise, he never would have thought that they would tell the King of Hell about their settling down together but sure enough Dean did.
“They do, but he’s going to have the same. You can’t eat burgers forever it’ll give you bad cholesterol and all that.”
Rough hands were pulling him up. “Cas? Cas?”
I wanted to be the man of honor. Oh well. Congrats on being gay, here you go.” In an instant he’s gone and in his place is John Winchester in the flesh.
“You remember? I thought you were dead. How did you hear me?” Cas shrugs, “I was only slightly unconscious, and coming to and from. I’m sorry I lied. Please don’t be mad, I just didn’t understand fully. Now I do. I love you too.”
A wicked smile plays at her lips, “Oh my god! You should have seen your face! Don’t worry about it. I’m not one of those physco girls.”
He pushed his guilt down and half sprinted to the library. After re-reading all of the research he had been pulling for weeks and weeks, he found his answer.
Dean mumbles
The impala was still parked. They had been sitting there for a while and he was starting to worry about the weird tension that grew between them.
"I love you Cas."
“No. I need some pants as well, and perhaps some pajamas.” He begins to sort through the sweaters again, and picks up a red one, this time it’s very big. Too big for him.
Good thing too. Was he about to jack off to the image of his best friend on top of him? No. No way. Although who could blame him? Cas was quiet a looker, dark hair complemented his tan skin nicely and
Mouth agape Sam is speechless. “I’m sorry man, I was just giving Dean a hard time, anything you need just let me know, uh how about we get you a wheel chair until you’re used to this human thing?” Dean is as well speechless at Cas’s response to his brother’s teasing. Smiling to himself smugly, Dean sits Cas down on the best chair they have carefully. “You good?” “Yes. Sam?” Looking up like a scolded school boy he mumbles “Uh-uh yeah Cas?” “Can you get me some water please?” “Sure” he nods. Laughing he goes to the fridge to pull out some food. “What do you want to eat? I’ve got stuff to make a good burger just the way you like it.” Sam sets down the water and quickly puts his head down and leaves the kitchen. “Dinner will be ready in twenty!” With a wave of the hand he’s gone. Squishing the meat in between his hands he molds it into a thick patty just how his angel likes it. The angel. Dammit man. Twenty minutes later three burgers are done and waiting with French fries on the side for Cas and him, and for Sammy a salad. “Sammy! Soups on!” Sam appears in the doorway and quickly takes the food and departs, but Cas yells for him before he can make it out. “Sam, I’m sorry for yelling earlier but I don’t regret what I said, I’d like it if you stayed and ate with Dean and me. “Thanks man, but its okay. I deserved it. I’ve got some research I was going to catch up on. You two have fun.
” Once again he’s kissing Dean’s perfect cupid lips but pulls away after a moment to rewind the movie.
"Bulls-eye! What did I say huh? You're a natural!"
"Don't lie. I'm only the second most gorgeous man. You my angel are the first."
Immediately upon pressing play the movie opened up to a group of guys, what resembled to be ‘tough’ guys. They all began to shoot of their weapons and he knew that no matter how hard he tried he was
“I’m so sorry for what I said. I could never hate you and being gay is not gross. If so then I’m gross too.”
Little did the angel know it was about a romance
“Cas, buddy that’s too big. That’s more for somebody like Sammy. Look at the label it says Big and Tall. You need average and tall.”
After they had finally left Dean heads to the bar across town. Hopefully his hookup from many years ago still worked there. Sure enough, walking into the bar he sees a light haired, chiseled man behind the counter pouring drinks. "Bourbon-straight up." "right away." Still not looking up from his task, Dean enjoys the look that flashes across Dave's face as realization creeps in as to who the stranger was. "Long time no see. What time do you get off?" Drink in hand, Dave is cold still. "I-I never thought I'd see you again, what are you doing here?" Winking he grabs the drink and downs it in one fluid motion. "You said I could top next time, well guess what. It's next time."
The angel shrugs, “I haven’t except for what I’ve heard in the car with you and Sam. They sing Black Bird correct? I like that song. Therefore I like the band.”
life. Hunting monsters was what he knew, but he’d never accepted that lifestyle. When he lift years ago, he had fully intended to never go back. Until his old life came barging through his front door. Since then, he had lost his girlfriend/ love of his life, and all of his hopes and dreams of being a lawyer. Now, he was a hunter, and a pretty damn good one, and even though this wasn’t the life he wanted, he enjoyed working with his brother. Dean was always there for him, since the very beginning, if anybody had asked about his parents, he didn’t think about John. No, he thought about Dean. It was his older brother who raised him, his father had been too busy hell bent on revenge to care about either of his sons. So it was no burden or trouble to work with his brother, because he was more than that. Dean was his best friend, and because he knew him so well, he knew that his brother wasn’t 100% honest with him. After their father’s death, Sam had mourned, but Dean, as always shoved it under a rug somewhere in his mind. “I’m dealing with dad’s death, are
“Know what?”
“I get it. He’s not coming. Enough already!” He jerked away from ‘Dean’ and rolled his eyes.
THREE WEEKS LATER
“Too weird?”
Psh, yeah right as if that would ever happen. “You realize the bunker is on the other side of Ohio and it will take longer to drop me off and go get him then just letting me tag along.” Dammit, Sammy had a point. “Dude if you want alone time just tell me, I can take a hint.” “Why would I need alone time? I just think you should rest in something other than the backseat. And the nurse said you need to drink a lot of fluids so that means soup not salad and some Gatorade.” Sam gave him a bitch face and muttered “Fine but I’m staying at a motel. If I’m going to rest I can’t do it with you two eye fucking every second.” “Dude, come on. What is with you lately? Cas is my best friend. He’s family. Besides I am not gay.” “Why are you getting so defensive then? Also there is a thing called bisexuality. Look it up.” Bisexual? He was not bisexual. He loved chicks and only chicks. “How about no. But I am however sticking you in a motel with fifty cans of soup til I get back. No arguments about it.” “When you finally grow a pair and realize you have feelings for the guy I’ll be there not to brag but to support you because you’re my brother no matter who you love.” “Sammy. Rule number one. No chick flick moments.” “Bitch” “Jerk.” Cas. You there Cas? Cas. Cas. Cas.
“I’m so glad you’re back. I missed you so much, it’s not the same without you. Sam is probably tracking me right now. He probably thinks I went on some kind of suicide mission or something.. There wasn’t exactly a lot to go on ya know. We couldn’t come up with any leads on how to get you back. I was going insane.  It came to me in a nightmare, honestly. But you’re back. I got you back.”
“Other than the power just blowing out, I think you’re still human.”
He tried not to notice how hard Dean was holding his hand as he pulled him along. Normally he would have let go by now.. This was unusual ground for them and he wasn’t sure how to proceed. Did he need to squeeze it? Was his hand sweaty? Why did he feel faint?
It was frayed in several places and there were obvious cracks in the medley it played, but still beautiful all the same.
“I’m not surprised, they cater for the annual horse races every year. It’s on their window. ‘Annual Cater for the Kansas Derby-10 years.’”
Cas replies with a firm “Yes Dean.”
on pause from earlier. He smiles smugly when Cas squints and presses himself closer to Dean. Their as close as anyone can be at this point.
He knew without a doubt that he was red. Cas got up with his mug and headed towards one of the extra bedrooms.
escapes his busted lips.
“I know what you’re thinking, why would the King of Hell save me? But mate you’re asking the wrong question, why would the noble King save me and put me in his own bedroom?”

“Oh, did I miss it?
Notes: Okay. So I lied about it finally happening so sue me. Jk. Please don't, but if I didn't leave you wondering then I wouldn't be a writer would I? Love you cuties!(0w0) ENJOY.
It wasn’t the first time he had dreamed about the shadow, and it was surely not going to be the last. The real question remained, was he an angel again? He was about to check when he was interrupted.
Dean on the other hand is buried in a car magazine.
“What is it Dean?” he said looking in the rearview mirror making sure Sam was still asleep.
“King of Hell actually.”
“Anything you want. A promise is a promise.” Cas smiled sweetly at his hunter before kissing him for hundredth time that day. Dean tasted just like all the hunter’s favorite foods combined into one flavor that was essentially all Dean.
“Son of a bitch, he’s going to come around asking for a favor now.”
He leaned and closed the space between them, making their faces inches apart. It wasn’t unfamiliar. He had been this close to Dean before but never in this context. They both breathed heavily and Dean moved his hand to his neck slowly.
Once the task is completed, he moves back up to seal their lips together again, sliding their naked bodies together. Cas stops clenching the sheets and threads them through Dean’s hair instead. A muffle “
“Looks good, is that all you’re going to get? One sweater?”
“Bobby, that old son of a bitch, how the hell is he?”
Knowingly and smugly, the tall Winchester said nothing and nodded.
The unspoken words between them made the tension unbearable and weird.
He taught him that not everything was set in stone, and that he could make his own way in the world, Free Will, he called it. Free Will and Dean Winchester had been the death of him. Many times. But he was always brought back, why, he didn’t know. But he was ever grateful, and each and every time he was brought back he wanted to tell the hunter just how he felt. Somehow he knew that he would never feel the same way. Dean Winchester was a fan of the female body it was true, and Cas’s vessel was unluckily male. So when Sam called him, and he read the younger Winchester’s thoughts he rushed there. Perhaps this is what would bring them together. He didn’t like to pry into Dean’s thoughts as often as he did Sam’s because he was too afraid. Afraid at what the older hunter might think of him, afraid of rejection, ultimately afraid that everything he’d rebelled for had been for loss. Castiel didn’t deserve the righteous man. Hell, he’d never been with anybody before, but he knew right away that he wanted to be with Dean Winchester in every way possible.

He laughed. “Sure. If it doesn’t die. There isn’t any sunlight down here.”
killed it, me and Cas.”
He put down the firearm and linked his arms around his hunter before kissing him sweetly, neither one of them heard the younger Winchester approach. *Throat Clearing* "As happy as I am to see your a good teacher Dean, I don't plan on sharing the same lesson with him, that'd be weird." Dean pulled away and gave his brother an impatient look "What do you want Sam?" "I have Cas's new FBI badge, but uh man you need to shave. You can't be an FBI agent with a beard like that." Dammit. He was hoping they could get away with that, hell Sammy's hair was way past the allowed length for the bureau but nobody ever questioned
“Trust me, I know all about higher powers. My brother is actually dating one, Castiel. Well he’s in love with an angel. Ex-angel.” He laughs nervously and rubs the back of his neck.
“Welcome home Cas.”
them. He sits down and scoots back with the angel in his arms. The poor guy must be shaken up pretty bad, he’s clinging onto Dean like a koala bear. “I’m sorry Dean, I-
“There they are. My OTP” Dean blushed before removing his arm, “I’m not even going to ask what that means.” Ash spoke up “Don’t worry about it man. Charlie stop pestering people, Sup Castiel I’m Ash this is Benny, the rude red head is Charlie and that’s Jo.” “Nice to meet you.” Dean patted his shoulder before sitting down next to benny and bringing him along. He felt unsteady and nervous because he didn’t want to mess up his chance at having friends, so when he felt Dean’s arm come around the back of his seat he sighed in relief. Being next to him made the whole process easier, and leaned in closer to him. “So Cas, you don’t mind we call you Cas right? I hope not because I’ve already started to use it thanks to Dean. Poor guy couldn’t shut up about you. Not that there was a lot to talk about all he said was blue eyes, witty, and handsome.” Dean gave her a bitch face that said shut it. She immediately knew her mistake and laughed, “Just kidding, he said you were nice.” Smiling he poked Dean’s side again, “That’s a lie.” Charlie faltered and began to explain when he spoke up, “Dean was being nice, I actually was a complete asshat to him when we first met, but he’s stubborn and would not let it go. So here I am.” They all laughed and he felt Dean’s eyes on him “Dude, asshat? Really?” “I don’t curse often.” Ash laughed “I couldn’t tell, I like the word. I’m gonna start using it. Hey asshat!” Benny rolled his eyes, “Don’t talk to me like that! I thought we were friends.” They nudged each other, “We are but that’s how we treat each other.” Charlie and Jo giggled, before Charlie said “Get a room!” “We’re just having some fun Char.” Raising her eyebrows she smirked and said, “I wasn’t talking to you two. Conceited much?” “Very much. And whoa I get it now.” Dean and Cas were in a deep conversation about music and ACDC was not the best band ever, all the while looking into each other’s eyes like they held all the answers. Ash cleared his throat, “Do you two need some privacy?” Blushing he realized that he was staring at Dean, and that he was staring back with the same goofy grin. “No sorry we were just talking about um drummers.” Charlie and Jo looked at each other before whispering “Oh drummers.” He rolled his eyes, he felt at home with the group, especially with Dean Winchester by his side.
Dean took a deep breath and thrust up, dragging his cock against the front of Castiel’s slacks, reaching up to pull at his shirt. “
Dean managed to pry his eyes open, and the sight of Castiel in front of him, looking at him adoringly, face flushed, forehead sweaty, hair sticking up wildly all over his head...Dean’s orgasm didn’t creep up as much as it hit him with unimaginable force. He cried out loudly, moving his arms back up around Castiel’s neck, tears blurring his eyes before he closed them again.
“True. Would you prefer I stayed away?”
, Cas, it’s...it’s the way you
“They look happy,” he said, turning to face Sam.
“So they don’t question your lack of...dating?”
“And your stupid bees are gonna be
Cas’s hand trailed down Dean’s chest to rest at his belly, tracing a long, jagged scar. “You’re so beautiful,” he sighed, taking some of the cum from Dean’s spent cock and smearing it across his stomach. He grazed his fingertips across the stretch marks, the slight pooch still left from carrying their pup, and Dean instinctively tried to pull away.
yourself for me,” Cas said lowly, crooking his fingers downward and brushing his prostate.
Dean sighed, watching Cas trace along the jagged lines, his finger barely dipping below the waistband of his jeans.  He wasn’t sure he’d ever feel that way about his scars, even though what Cas said was true. Maybe, one day, in the far future he’d look at them and not see something ugly. For now, he was just happy Cas saw them as something else besides horrible reminders of what he’d endured.
Sam faltered in his task of cutting up some lettuce for his salad. He started to whistle, loudly, to drown out the two.
Castiel breathed in carefully through his nose, setting his jaw. He tilted his head and slid his hands up to Dean's shoulders and down his arms, stopping just above his elbows.
“Hmph, a couple of hours ago you didn’t even want to watch it, and now you can’t even look away to see me tease you.”
No, he fell head first in love upon touching the righteous man’s soul, and since then his life had equally been wonderful and awful at the same time. Being the Winchester’s guardian angel had its perks, a certain freckled hunter being the main one. The downside of it all was he ignored his heavenly command for the first time in his existence,
“Yeah Cas, it’s food. Like pizza, or Chinese.”
“Dammit Dean.”
“Fuck.” As much as he doesn’t want to admit it, it feels good to have the angel on top of him.
“I like to mix business with pleasure. But no I haven’t seen Moose in ages, don’t tell him hello for me, we didn’t part friends, he and I. He did try to kill me, bloody fool. But then again so did angel boy. All is well that ends well.”
Cas stops twitching and lays flat against his chest, finally at peace. He continues to sing anyways, not just for his angel, but for himself too. Soon, he too is asleep.
“This. The feeling of being in your arms, close to you, so close to me that I can hear your heart beating. And so I can do this, anytime I want to” he says right before going to kiss Dean once more on the lips. At the last second he stops and unpauses the movie instead.
THE END.
YEARS LATER*
“Why aren’t we watching this?”
NOTE: This is after the angels have fallen, POV will change a lot. Enjoy!
After his encounter with Dean he felt disappointed that the conversation didn't go any better than what it did. Never once while he was carrying the hunter into the bunker did he think that it would be weird for Dean. If so he never would have done it, he hated making the hunter uncomfortable. All he wanted in life was for him to be happy even if that meant that he was not. When he woke up in the car he saw Dean's face for the first time, he'd seen his face countless of times but it was always his soul that shone brightest, he tried not to stare as they discussed their nightmares but he couldn't help it and Dean didn't seem to notice. He was to busy focusing on his dream, he knew that Dean wasn't telling the whole truth but he decided it was best not to press. So when he carried the hunter he payed attention to every detail and didn't mind when Sam cleared his throat loudly. "Dude. That's creepy." "Why? I'm just looking at his face. I've never really seen it before, you on the other hand I have due to you being soul-less that one time. I never knew how handsome the Winchesters were." "Thanks Cas. Just put him in his room. I'm going to do some research in the library. Call if you need help with something." He agreed and brought the hunter to his bedroom he took his time as to not stir the hunter awake. Sitting him down he left the room and headed to find a place to sleep, seeing the couch he figured it was best. He didn't want to get to comfortable here in the bunker in case the boys decided he was useless, as he was now that he was human. Before he would have thought maybe he could be a hunter, but that had proved that he was an awful hunter indeed. Without his powers he was completely useless and just a burden. Dean and Sam just felt sorry for him and didn't want him to be captured by anybody, they were taking pity on him and he was grateful for it. Trying to sleep he laid down on the couch and thought of Dean returning his new human feelings. A dark shadow appeared in front of him, but he couldn't make out who it was because he was still half asleep, he felt a blanket being thrown over him and footsteps walking away. When he felt another figure approach he was almost asleep so he decided it was nothing and tried to go back to sleep. He heard Dean's voice but couldn't hear exactly what he was saying, wishing he was still an angel so he could hear everything he sighed and got up. Dean was beginning to walk away and he called out to him... "Goodnight Cas." It was not a good night, he could barely sleep all he could about think about was his siblings falling, he saw them every time he close his eyes. How had he stopped it before? He knew the obvious answer was Dean, but he had already made the oldest Winchester uncomfortable enough and he didn't want to do it again. Walking towards the library he saw that Sam was asleep next to his open laptop. Guess he couldn't ask him for advice then after all, he walked towards Dean's room and listened closely to see if he was awake. Hearing slight music playing he decided that he was awake. Knocking lightly on the door he waited for confirmation to come in. "Yeah?" Peeking his head in the door slightly "Dean can we talk?" "Sure man. Come in." He hesitated and stayed inside the doorway. "Or not. Whatever. What's on your mind man?" "I can't sleep and I slept well last night and I was wondering if I could um maybe uh sleep with you in here. On the floor of course, I'll make a pallet or something." Dean was silent on the bed and let out a huff of breath, "I don't know man, I mean. That's kind of..." he stopped talking and looked at him with sad eyes. "Yeah okay, but um you don't have to sleep on the floor. My bed's big enough for two, I'll just put a pillow in between us." "Thank you Dean." "You're welcome man, are you going to sleep in your trench coat?" "It's all I have Dean." "Were going to have to buy you some clothes but until then you can wear mine, theirs some shorts in the drawer right there and t shirts underneath." "Alright. He took out what looked comfortable and began to unbutton his shirt and remove his coat. "Dude. Go to the bathroom." Dean looked flushed and he had moved his pillow to his lap, assuming he was just being Dean he let it go. He walked back to the room "Is this more suitable for sleep?" "If you're comfortable I guess." Taking one of the pillows from behind him he put it in the middle and went back to reading his book and listening to his music. "Dean, what are you listening to?" "AC DC what else?" "Is that something that helps you sleep?" "No actually the opposite its too loud but I like it." Nodding he moved to lay down on the bed, "Is this not weird Dean?" "Yeah but I'll make an exception since your having a hard time and all. But this is a one time thing okay? And we don't talk about it. Ever. Okay?" Realization swept over him, Dean didn't like this arrangement and it was making him uncomfortable. "I think I'll be okay Dean. Sorry for bothering you." "Cas wait? I thought you were gonna sleep in here?" "It clearly makes you uncomfortable so I'll just get through it on my own. Thank you for being kind though." "Cas come on, really it's not that weird just shut up and go to sleep okay?" "I will. In my own room." he said walking away and closing the door. He half expected Dean to come up behind him and tell him that he too wanted to share a bed but that didn't happen so he returned to his own room and closed the door. Right then he decided things would have to change with him and Dean, he would have to remove himself from his favorite hunter. Not completely because that would hurt far too much, more than he was willing to admit in fact. Sam was his next best option, Sam was already his good friend but he wasn't his best friend. Dean was, but that was going to change. What did Sam like to do? All he ever saw him do was research or look stuff up on his laptop, he was very smart, and Dean had mentioned his love of rabbit food. Tomorrow he would do his best to initiate a conversation about the rodents. Closing his eyes again his nose began to smell a familiar scent. Dean's clothes still smelled like the woodsy smell of him, there was no way he could sleep with this scent in his nose. If he were to remove himself from Dean completely he needed to take off the clothes and slept in his boxers. When he finally fell asleep he saw the familiar image of the night sky lighting up.
Dean is dying at the foot of his bed, bleeding and shaking. “Cas-why?” A sob escapes his lips “No, no,
They left the room with their hands intertwined and he blushed when he realized that this was going to be a revealing factor. Sam would know the instant he saw him, and as smart as Kevin was he would surely figure it out. Walking into the kitchen they passed the library where Sam and Kevin were sitting and Sam laughed at them. "Told you. I win, fork over the 50." "Dammit, how was I supposed to know they would get it on so early in the relationship?" "Dude did you guys place bets on when me and Cas would hook up? That is so wrong." "Yeah but you did so it makes it profitable." Cas blushed, "We're taking things slow." "Ha! No way am I giving you fifty bucks. They didn't do shit, they're just together now." "Man they were in there for hours. Hours. What on earth could they be doing for that long if not fucking?" "Listen you sickos, we were sleeping. Neither of us got that much sleep last night. Come on Cas, I'll fix you a burger." Following behind him they went into the kitchen and he started to pull things from the fridge, "You're so pretty Dean." Pretty? Usually he'd be offended at the term but when he turned he saw Cas staring at him with adoration in his eyes. "Your eyes, hair, freckles, everything, Just so beautiful." He stopped what he was doing and moved closer to his angel. "I'm far from beautiful especially standing next to you. You have to be the sexiest angel in heaven." 'I'm not an angel anymore Dean." Smiling at his angel he caressed his face, "You'll always be my angel." Cas closed the space between their lips and kissed him sweetly before backing them up to the counter. Things began to get heated quickly but he had to remind himself that they were taking things slow. "Cas babe, I can't keep my hands off of you when you take control that." "So don't." "No I want us to last so I'm not going to rush into anything. Let me fix you a burger and I promise we'll continue a PG-13 version of this later okay?" "Fine" was all he said before removing himself from Dean. "Don't pout babe." "You keep calling me babe." He hadn't realized he was doing it until the angel pointed it out. "Does it bother you?" "No I was just wondering what I could call you." "You can call me whatever you want." "Alright my dear." Dear. It was kind of weird but he liked it. "Honey?" "Yes?" "I'm going to call you honey." Continuing his fixing food he turned around and flipped the burgers. "It smells good whatever your cooking." Kevin said as he walked into the kitchen. He sat next to Cas and nudged him with his shoulder. "I approve of this new relationship with you guys and all but just don't become one of those couples who do everything together including using the bathroom. And thanks for saving me 50 bucks." "We didn't save you jack, Neither of you won. Technically. but that's none of you guys business." "Got it. So what are you cooking there Betty Crocker?" "Burgers Han Solo. Do you want one?" "Make that four." Sam said walking into the kitchen and patting his brothers shoulder before pulling out the case of beers from the fridge. He then distributed them amongst the four men. "So when's the wedding?" "Sammy, I know you're waiting on an I told you so but that ain't gonna happen." "Honey, don't be mean, Sam played a part in us confessing our feelings for each other. Thank you Sam. Your advice was sound and very useful." Sam smirked and wiggled his eyebrows and his brother. "Yeah
“Well, I like it.”
Castiel chuckled, pulling him in and kissing the top of his head.
"Take it back!"
“Fine. Good. I’m...good,” he said, licking his lips and looking down awkwardly. The last time he saw Castiel was in the middle of his heat, covered in slick and sweat. He vividly remembered how his body had reacted and shuddered.
Sam groaned from his room, his tuxedo spread out across his bed.
“I don’t know yet,” Jack replied, “but I think we can use it.”
it like you’re probably thinking, but...yes. I certainly played a big part in it.”
“If you want to call it that,” Cas mumbles and stands, grabbing his black hoodie off the back of the couch and pulling it on. “Let’s go, freckles.”
to be. Of course, he was still seeing Garth regularly and working through past trauma, but he had Cas, and he had Rory, and now they had a pup to look forward to, and he was determined to be positive and strong for all of them.
“Oh, they don’t care who it is you’re seeing Castiel,” Anael waved a dismissive hand. “They probably won’t even notice his age-”
Dean frowned deeply and was already shaking his head before Benny was even done speaking. “No,” he grunted, going back to his food and biting hard on his sausage. “Don’t need to talk.”
Castiel gripped his hips tightly, holding him still, nails barely biting into his skin. Dean hissed, looking down at him with hooded eyes. It happened all at once, a low growl erupting from Castiel’s throat as he pulled down on one of Dean’s arms and threw him to the side using one of his legs, and then he was hovering over him, grinding his hips against his naked crotch, one hand caressing the side of Dean’s neck as he mouthed at the other side. Dean’s breath hitched and he held tightly to the tops of Castiel’s arms, moaning softly, canting his hips upward to meet Castiel’s.
Dean:
“You sure about this?”
choice, Dean.”
Cas’s eyes darken just slightly in a way that pulls at Dean’s gut. “You would look very good in a tux,” he signs, slowing looking Dean over.
“And what about you?”
” Dean gasped and bucked, his blood quickly pooling down and his slick gland pulsing inside. He wasn’t sure what was getting him going more, Cas’s mouth or his words. He’d sort of presented once, but it had been dark and bit rushed. With Rory in the next room, they hadn’t been able to to savor the moment.
Cas held him through it all, kissing his cheeks, his lips, one hand firmly on the scar that ended up being the key. As it turned out, an angel laying a claim on a soul was a powerful thing and not even the Empty could fight against it when that claim was called. Not when said claim was backed by a soul so strong that not even God himself was able to destroy it.
“But you gave me very little to work with. I never once got the idea you were interested.”
"But not like, one of those cheesy ones like on
“Can’t imagine him bein’ the type easily picked on,” Dean mumbled through a mouthful of food.
"Will do." Dean throws her a wink then he's out the door of her parents' stuffy suburban home with the cornflower blue shutters.
Dean blinked.
Cas growls, plunging deep and fingering that magical spot, and Dean's seeing stars.
"Don't you recognize him, Zar?" Cas finally asks, turning his attention to the blonde Brit. "This here's Dean Winchester."
“You’re drawing the line?”
Cas is standing there as if he never left, clutching an arm and hunched over against the cold. Dean notices, a bit irritably, that his jacket is way too thin for how cold it is outside. Cas is still as beautiful as ever, though, with his wind swept hair and those eyes that are so blue Dean had been starting to think he’d made them up.
“With, uh, what?” Dean asked.
“Man of few words,” she chuckled. “That’s alright. Donna here can talk enough for the both of us.”
anymore. It was equally exciting and frightening.
“I’m fine,” Dean replied, chewing robotically over his army issued lasagna.
difficult to say no to.”
Dean hummed, taking a sip of the beer Anael had insisted was fine for him to drink. No one seemed to notice or care, anyway. Castiel was down at the water with Michael, Luc, and a few of the kids, dutifully throwing each one into the water and laughing as they continued to line up to go again and again, squealing in delight. The oldest of their kids was Michael and Hannah’s daughter Ariel, who couldn’t have been more than 12 or 13. He also had twin boys, Micah and Gadreel, who were 7, and another daughter Lailah, who was 4. Luc and Kali’s girls, Dumah and Zuriel, both looked to be under the age of 10 as well.
“Sit up for me, baby.”
“Will things go wrong?” Dean blinked up at him, shivering as Castiel scrubbed the loofah over his chest.
“Nothin’ wrong with just you,” Dean says, reaching up to flatten some of Cas’s wild hair. It bounces back up, unperturbed by his efforts.
“Burgers and fries, Dean, really?” Cas screwed up his face as the roughly pulled off his trench coat.
, comfortable and relaxed, playing the guitar like a damn pro.
Dean’s eyes widened and he only hesitated for a second before he darted upstairs, his heart already speeding up. He hadn’t expected a scene tonight, but he wasn’t going to complain. He didn’t even worry about what he would say to John when the man inevitably complained about having no dinner on the table.
"That's what I thought. Hey, I've been there," Charlie says non-chalantly, "I get it."
“-while I’m in the bed next to them.”
"That's it, gorgeous." Cas coaxes as he works his finger slowly in and out, then adds another and continues the slow assault. "Let me know how good it is."
“He always ends up out here at some point,” Anael murmured. “It was one of their spots. I think Gabe taught him out to swim out here. Made him jump off the dock when he was younger, according to Michael. Apparently the water scared him or maybe it was just the jumping part, I dunno. But Gabe could always get him to jump.”
“Yes, but future scenes
Dean groaned as he leaned over to check the time on his clock, which at some point had been rattled off the nightstand into the floor beside the bed. 6:45 a.m. - breakfast time, as far as he was concerned. And he’d be knocking out two birds with one stone anyway- three, really- by making Cas happy, simultaneously delaying discussion of his request, and stuffing his face with grease and fat.
“Cas, I…” Dean sighed and his head fell back with a soft thunk against the headboard. “I wasn’t really saying it was his fault. I just meant...stuff happens. It wasn’t really anyone’s fault. You know, my dad, he...he kinda went through the same thing with my mom. Blamed himself for her death. I don’t think he does anymore, but it was messy for a long time. Drank himself into a stupor most nights.” He waved his hand and rubbed at his eyes. “I’m gettin’ off track here. Point is, I know it’s natural to blame yourself, or to just...want to have someone to blame, in general. But I really don’t want to see you destroy yourself over it.”
Another long pause. “A little over three years.”
“Got any slices left? Ol’ Ellie seemed mighty hungry for ya earlier,” Dean teases as he leans through the window, tapping his fingers against the frame.
“Although...this one is really rigid, and while I personally like that every once in awhile, I think it would be more comfortable for you to start with one that has a bit more...flexibility.”
Castiel took a long sip of coffee, squinting at the tv. “The gist,” he said finally, looking over at Dean, eyes softening. “Sorry about that. About, uh. All of that.”
“Not so bad, huh?” Castiel whispered to Dean, taking a sip of his coffee.
Castiel hummed quietly. “And she doesn’t know the nature of our relationship?”
“Do you have ice cream?” Cas finally signs bashfully, but Dean gives him an enthusiastic nod.
Dean almost stumbled as Castiel practically pushed him through a set of glass doors and into a hallway. He swallowed, wondering if maybe Castiel hadn’t wanted to make that school business public knowledge. He opened his mouth, ready to apologize, when Castiel placed a finger on his lips.
Cas nodded with a small smile. “Yes. We were successful in extracting my grace. I am fully human.”
“Uh, yeah, he did I guess,” Sam shrugged, frowning. “Why do you bring it up?”
“You think you can get some?” he asked hopefully, glancing up at her.
“You know,” he started conversationally, “you’re the first Sub to become this aroused by being fed.”
“Did you have any questions for me at this point?”
“I dunno,” Dean huffed a laugh. “Haven’t really given them much thought. Plus I raised Sammy. I kind of want to focus on me for a while.”
“No,” Cas shook his head. “No. You can’t.”
"Then my comment stands."
Dean looked over his shoulder at the spot he knew Anael was, though he couldn’t see her anymore. He wanted to shout that she was wrong. That Castiel didn’t need him. That this whole scheme of hers was a waste of time and only served to crush Dean’s heart even further. And he’d been stupid enough to go along with it.
“Not possible,” Dean shrugs. “Have I ever given any indication of that happening?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Castiel scoffed. “Of course you will go.”
Dean grinned, lips shiny from bacon grease. “Still wanna grow old with me?”
“Oh, god,” Dean stopped, scrubbing a hand down his face. “What if Sammy’s in there? What’s he gonna think? Oh, god-”
It’s refreshingly cool, making goosebumps erupt across their skin as the water laps at their waists. Once it reaches their chests, Dean pulls Cas closer and kisses him deeply, passionately, letting his tongue explore despite whoever may be watching.
“That’s ridiculous-“
“Do as I say, Omega,” Castiel murmured lowly, blue eyes glowing intently. “It will feel good, I promise.”
“Hey, honey,” Missouri called out, waving him over to a bed. “Come on over and get comfy. It’ll be a minute.”
Dean hits the ground hard, skidding a little to a stop, his back aching with the impact. Before he has time to react, he sees a blur of black, and he's being hoisted roughly to his feet by the front of his shirt. Fergus's face comes into view, the Scot gritting his teeth menacingly as he quickly rears a fist back and plunges it forward, connecting hard with Dean's jaw and making a loud popping noise. He immediately throws another punch, connecting with Dean's left eye and sending Dean tumbling back down to the pavement. He barely registers his throbbing eye as he leans to his side and spits a mouthful of blood onto the parking lot.
“My old company wants me to come in as a consult,” Castiel said, the sound of papers shuffling in the background. Dean could imagine him sitting at his desk, his glasses on his nose, frowning down at his paperwork, sleeves rolled to his elbows and that fucking blue tie hanging messily around his neck. The image had his dick twitching.
Cas looks at him for a long time. “I’m sorry about your mom.”
Dean smiles, blush creeping up his cheeks. Admittedly, he'd been pretty preoccupied today. His thoughts flashed back to raven black hair and tongue piercings.
Dean spared a glance up and realized how close he was to the Alpha. Castiel was older than him, the small splatters of gray in his hair and the slight wrinkle around his eyes the only things giving his age away.
“I mean in terms of your caretaking,” Castiel said sharply, splashing at him. “But anyway, like
“Uh...couple of months, I guess. But I’ve known him for a few years now.”
Their burgers arrived (Sam got a salad, which Dean scoffed at). While they ate and discussed the current case, Castiel reached over and fiddled with the knob on the jukebox. His head tilted, his eyes squinted. Jack watched, enraptured, as Dean ceaseless handed over a quarter while munching on a fry. Castile wordlessly stuck the quarter inside and a few moments of indecision, picked a song.
Dean grinned and Sam groaned with deep, deep regret.
We're really loving the exchange going on in the comments of each chapter! We love seeing all your questions and guesses and the fact that you're interacting with one another in an inquisitive manner. Keep that shit up!
"I agree with you there." Charlie sits down beside her bag, drawing her legs up to her chest. "All I've been able to deduce is that it's something to do with his childhood. But he won't...
"I'm serious, Charlie."
Dean sighs and bows his head, then shakes it slightly, feeling so tired all the sudden. No sleep is starting to catch up to him.
Dean frowns. "You've never...been with a boy before either?"
Dean shook his head, looking down at himself and thinking how strangely beautiful it was, how the rope wrapped around him so perfectly. Like it was a part of him, made for him.
Castiel exhaled through his nose and shook his head. He slid his fingers down Dean’s arm and rested his hand on Dean’s collar bone, tracing the bone. “No, although that was very nice,” he smiled briefly. “You just...feel so very strongly for others. For
Cas would whisper those three words that simultaneously terrify and exhilarate Dean. Over and over the angel would say this as he touched, worshiped, kissed, loved him until Dean was a whimpering mess.
Dean blushed heavily, his already too hot skin heating up, his cock twitching. He watched, wide eyed, as Cas brought the finger to mouth and licked off the small drop of milk. Dean gasped softly when he felt the thick knot inside him jerk and Cas shuddered violently against his back, breath coming out in short pants.
"Good." Cas leans up a little more and runs his tongue along Dean's upper lip, then pulls back and offers Dean his pointer and middle fingers. "Suck 'em for me, baby."
"What?"
be okay without Dean.
Dean, not for the first time, wishes his refractory period was nonexistent, because he could definitely stand to fuck Cas like this again. From the looks of it, Cas is more than willing to oblige.
Dean had yet to tell the others. He had yet to tell them that the night they got home - after seeing the Leviathan drag Cas into the water and then dissipate, leaving his body to drown at the bottom of the lake - Castiel had walked from the closet where Dean had stored the abused trench coat. He had looked as good as he had in the warehouse where Dean first saw him; trench coat repaired, tie backwards, hair looking like the product of an eight-hour sex marathon quickly followed by a roller coaster. Dean hadn't told them, and he certainly wasn't planning on doing so any time soon.
Dean just smiled and looked away. "Nothing, Cas," he muttered under his breath, but Castiel could tell he was lying. He knew it. He knew that if he looked up into Castiel's eyes, he would see a frown on his face, confusion settling into his brow. Dean cleared his throat and turned his head a bit farther away. He desperately sought to ignore the warm body only inches from his, the intense stare that he could feel prickling the hairs on the back of his neck.
Cas seemed to consider this seriously. “Yes.”
“No worries, Dean,” Anael said coolly. “I don’t judge.” She drained the rest of her drink, looking down at the empty glass. “Get over yourself, Castiel,” she said without looking up. “He’s here now, and we both know you really wanted him to be, so you may as well lose the brooding Dom act.”
Dean sighed and shifted, thinking he probably should have at least sat on a stump instead of the ground. The snow was freezing his ass off. He bent a leg, ready to push off the ground, then froze when he suddenly saw two pairs of eyes staring right at him. They were intensely blue and he was briefly reminded of his Alpha, right down to the scent coming off the wolf. An Alpha as well, then.
Castiel quirked a brow. “I didn’t realize he needed help in that department.”
“You can actually camp there,” Cas signs a little slower than necessary. “I’d love to take you to one of the cabins. And we could climb the mountain-”
"Ooh-hoo! This is gonna be fun, baby boy!" He grins widely, his nose wrinkling and his bright eyes crinkling in the corners. He holds a finger in the air and makes a circular motion. "Turn around for me, baby. Lemme see you."
Then they moved on, the pack of socks in Castiel’s hand. Jack frowned as he followed, so deep in thought he hadn’t noticed they made it back to the clothes. He blinked as Castiel held up a few shirts to Jack, eyebrows furrowed slightly. Jack realized Castiel was sizing them, making sure they fit him.
She huffed a laugh. “Melatonin. It helps you sleep. Don’t worry, it don’t hurt nothin’.”
“I dunno if you noticed,” Dean says softly, “but I still have that picture of Baby hanging in the diner. People talk about it all the time.”
Dean scoffed softly and looked down at Cas’s sweaty chest. He hadn’t even thought about what he was doing. Just let his instincts guide him.
Finally, after a long moment of silence between the two, Dean slowly stood and stretched his cold stiff legs. He pushed his hands in his pockets and began walking back towards camp, the wolf trotting behind him like a guard dog. At the edge of the trees, the wolf stopped and Dean reached down to scratch behind his ear one more time.
Dean scoffed, looking back down at his plate. “Who even talks like that, Cas?”
“Dean, it’s the
“It’s incredibly important that you eat three well-rounded meals a day and snacks in between. If you do not get the proper calorie intake or skip meals, I will be forced to deny you a scene.” Castiel stopped and turned to Dean, crossing his arms. “And before you consider lying about it, know that failure to adhere to a healthy diet before scenes could potentially cause you to lose consciousness or become sick. Not only would you be putting yourself at risk, but you will be subject to punishment once you are well enough to participate again. I’m not above nursing you back to health so I can take you apart again myself.”
This is the end, guys!
“So I guess despite what I've told her, it
“I hate to condone violence,” Castiel started with a shrug, “but...I heard what he said to you. Could almost smell the alcohol on his breath from the car. I’m not saying he deserved it, but... I
Dean licked his lips and glanced down at his wrists, at the faint red lines circling them, and recalled the cool feel of the metal on his skin. The sound of the chains as he moved, the slight pinch when he pulled on them.
The small voice startled him, and he almost dropped what was left of his food. He whipped around to find a young pup loitering at the far edge of his cabin, around the back. Her long wavy red hair reflected the sunlight and she had freckles sprinkled across her face. She wore baggy green pants and a pink shirt, a blue jacket zipped halfway, and rubber winter boots that looked a size too big. She tilted her head and tugged at the bottom of her jacket.
Cas turned and walked away. Dean blinked then shook it off, quickly following the angel to his bedroom. He was very cold, after all.
“You’re so strong,” Cas marveled, grazing his fingers possessively up Dean’s neck and along the curve of his jaw. “Intelligent, strong, resilient. I’m in absolute awe of you.”
He shifted slowly and pulled Dean to him, nuzzling the top of his head gently with his chin. “I love you very much, Dean.”
"No...no, this one was bad, wasn't it? Worse than most."
“Of course you do,” Dean snorted. “I don’t know how you stay so skinny when you eat everything in sight.”
Dean quirks a smile. “That’s my boy.” He brushes his cheek with his thumb and Cas gives him a small smile. “Now. For the love of God-” he gets up and grabs Cas’s mug of coffee, handing it to him, “drink the rest of this and I will bring you more. Go sit in the living room and put in a movie or something and I’ll get this stuff packed up.”
Cas opened his mouth to speak and firmly shut it again, frowning slightly. “It’s still happening?”
Dean took several deep breaths. He closed his eyes, exhaled, and jumped.
“Maybe,” Cas shrugged and nipped at Dean’s chest…
“Then, um...out here. In...in your-just, out here,” he glanced up at Cas, biting at his lip. He wasn’t sure if sleeping in Cas’s bed would be better or worse, but at least if he had any
“Talk to me.”
Castiel pressed his lips together and nodded. “Thank you.”
Without warning, Cas rolled to his back, pulling Dean on top of him, and spun Dean on his cock so he was facing him. Dean caught himself with his hands on Cas's stomach, yelping when Cas ground up into him and circled his hips.
“Then I’ll continue to rewrite it, and I’ll continue to send it,” Castiel said with a shrug. “So why waste the effort?”
The silence that followed was somehow worse than the silence that had stretched between them since that day...now that it was all there, out in the open. Now that Sam knew the real reason he could barely bring himself to get out of bed each day.
Dean started shaking his head. “N-no, that’s-”
“Because I wasn’t-”
Bobby looks at them both with a lost expression. “His brother,” Dean explains.
“Was I
Now...before you sit down to read: Grab a snack. Drink a glass of water. If you've been sitting, stand and stretch.
He can barely sleep anymore and works tirelessly on the car instead, despite Sam’s (who had more than his share of his own problems and shouldn’t be worrying about his big brother) and Bobby’s worried glances and attempts to get him to rest. There is no resting, no peace, when all he can see when he closes his eyes is his angel falling, fading, because Dean can never hold on tight enough. When all he can see is Cas falling apart, his body disintegrating and melting, dying a horrible death.
Dean cut him off when he sealed their lips together in a filthy kiss, slotting their tongues together and thrusting his half-hard cock against Cas’s stomach. Cas groaned into his mouth, just getting into the kiss when Dean pulled away a little breathlessly.
“Reading,” Dean deadpanned, giving his little brother a Look.
“Safe words still apply,” Castiel said evenly, hooking his chin over Dean’s shoulder. “But you asked for hard, sweet boy, and I intend to make you question whether or not asking for that was a good idea.”
“Hey, man,” he cleared his throat. “What’s up?”
Finally he cut the engine and clenched the check in his fist as he got out of the car and slammed the heavy door behind him. He was up the walkway and knocking loudly on the door before he could change his mind. There was nothing but silence behind the door at first, no signs of any movement inside, so Dean knocked again, louder this time, then rang the doorbell a few times for good measure.
When they are safely on the ground, Dean breathes a little easier. It takes a day and forever for the plane to come to a stop and another friggin’ day to actually get
"Think hard, Dean," she whispers sternly, "I need to know how bad this is."
“No, no,” Castiel said, “I should’ve been more considerate of you and how it would seem. It’s my fault, not yours. And I’m not...mad, about you canceling, for the record. I don’t own you.” He paused, waiting until Dean looked at him again. “As for the rest, I...I just...don’t know what you want me to say, Dean. I know you’re not her. I suppose it
Dean paused and scrunched up his face. “Mela...um, what?”
"You're a terrible liar."
“Probably,” Dean agreed reluctantly, lifting his head to press another kiss to Cas’s lips. “But as soon as you’re better, Rory is spending the night at Charlie’s.”
"Dunno."
He finally opened them again, looking up through the tops of the trees. The moonlight shone down in slivers through the branches, and on the forest floor those same branches painted the snow with shadows. The crunching started again but stopped soon after, close enough that Dean was sure it must have been just out of his view. He stared straight ahead and sniffed, then wiped his cold nose on his sleeve. His warm breath came out in a large cloud and dissipated into the night air, and for a second Dean let his mind consider why it always felt so much colder when it wasn’t actively snowing.
Castiel frowned at his computer. “I suppose I
“I know that,” Sam snorted. “It’s just a lot, you know? We’ve known him since we were kids.”
Dean can't get Cas's face out of his head.
"Sorry," Dean mutters gruffly, flexing his fingers over the steering wheel.
Castiel shook his head after a beat, blinking to break his trance. “Nothing.” He began rubbing Dean's chest again, hand hesitating over his heart. “You're doing well. Take your time.”
“Or maybe it’s just that you’ve watched it so many times-”
for a pup. Smart. Too smart.
,” Cas gasped, eyes shining with hurt. “That’s the real problem isn’t it?”
“I’m 18,” Dean said smugly. “I can eat whatever I want and it just melts off.”
“He never ate-”
“It’s an expression, Cas,” Dean chuckled as he began cleaning up the mess they’d made. “And anyway, we’re bonded through your grace. I’d say that counts as married.”
“Finding your way around?” She asked brightly.
“Fine,” Dean snaps at both of them, causing Cas to jump again. He stomps off into the kitchen and the sound of pots and pans banging has Sam rolling his eyes.
Cas smirks again, the small stud piercing through his bottom lip pulling to the side, and he turns to look around the expanse of the room.
“Dean-”
Dean frowned and looked up at him. “They know...about…”
It wasn’t until he felt Castiel’s hips still, heard his stuttered breath, felt an incredible warmth filling him that he realized Castiel had broken one of his own rules...and he vaguely wondered if it was intentional or if he’d regret it later. Castiel sighed and pressed their foreheads together, holding Dean tightly around his waist, hot breath mingling between them.
Castiel narrowed his eyes and leaned forward, lips set in a hard frown. “You know that’s not true, Dean. I don’t
“...no.”
Too bad for Cas.
“I never doubted your love for me, Dean,” Cas assured him. “I just...I didn’t know what it meant.”
“Yeah. Jessica. Sweet kid, helps me keep him in line.”
He heard something drop, felt the cuffs unhook and the blindfold slip free, and it all happened so fast Dean was disoriented for a few seconds. He blinked and swayed, and Castiel caught him easily, pulling him up and onto the bed where he was laid out, shivering and staring wildly around the room.
She pursed her lips and nodded, the hand on his back rubbing in circles. “Anything else you wanna tell me while you're here?”
"Y-you want me to...take my clothes off?"
“Did last night mean nothing to you?” Castiel asked quietly, looking down at their hands.
Cas’s voice pulled Dean back to the present. He smiled as he started spreading the jelly. “Miss is that much, huh?”
Dean huffs a laugh. “Might help.”
“Oh ya, I get that. It can be a lot to take in at first.” Donna shoved her hands in her pockets again and took a look around the compound, squinting against the sunlight reflecting off the roof of one of the cabins. “It’s a good place to be, though. I bounced around a bit before I found refuge here. You will grow to love it, I’m confident.”
“Like…
“You’re sure?”
"I sort of...took control at one point."
“Honey,” Missouri says from behind him, “shut that mouth of yours before you put your foot in it.”
He heard John come in about an hour later and the tv cut on almost immediately after. Sam never came back for money, or to ask him for a ride, but sometime that night after John had gone to bed and Dean was on his third
Dean scratched at his cheek and idly thought he needed to shave. He was starting a little too fuzzy. “Could always slip her some whiskey.”
Dean likes to think his Cas is still in there somewhere. That underneath all that power, his friend is trying to break free but simply isn’t strong enough to get through. The thought both comforts and terrifies Dean. Wakes him every night with his heart hammering in his chest and tears sliding down his cheeks. It’s worse each time, the image of Cas reaching out to him, fingers outstretched. But Dean’s grip fails and Cas plunges into darkness.
“You didn’t
Cas nodded once, eyes never straying from Dean’s. “Yes. I want you to cut out my Grace.”
__________
Dean chewed his lip. He could think of a bunch of things he wanted out of this, none of which he could ask Castiel for.
Castiel looked up from his pillow in the middle of the room, legs crossed and hands resting on his thighs. His hair was messy and he had dark circles under his eyes, but he attempted a small smile before seeing the expression on Benny’s face.
Well, almost everyone.
Dean swallows, giving her a hard nod. "Yeah." He looks down at his hands in his lap.
Dean can feel his cheeks heat, and he's thankful for the dark of the car. "Actually, you haven't. This has been...somewhat recent."
"Holy fuck!" Cas gasps with a breathy laugh. "Who knew Dean Winchester would get off taking it up the ass? You my little whore, Winchester?"
Despite the pain, though, Dean drudged up that memory as much as he dared.
“Stop.”
“Well it’s still too hot,” Dean said stubbornly.
“Well, I didn’t hear you complaining during my rut. In fact, I’m pretty sure you were too busying moaning to complain.”
John looked up as he grabbed the chicken from the fridge. “Well, he basically got me through high school. He was my tutor almost all four years. He’s the only reason I passed some of those classes. Even if we weren’t what you would call friends exactly, after spending so much time together one can’t help but get to know him.”
Dean nodded, inching towards the hallway so he could hide in his room for a few minutes.
“That old witch can stuff that pretentiousness right back from where she pulled it out of,” Missouri says sharply, smiling up at Bobby and giving him a one-armed hug. “How you doin’, baby?”
“Yeah, baby, I promise,” Dean said, looking back down at her. “I’m sorry we scared you. Go back to bed, okay? It’s late.”
Castiel smiled a smile that Dean would spend the rest of the night in bed trying to decipher and fail miserably. The damn check got tucked away in his desk drawer, under his magazines, because Cas had been right. He didn’t tear it up and he had every intention on using it. Maybe his dad didn’t believe in him, but someone did. And that thought was very comforting.
Dean nodded, barely holding his eyes open in his post-orgasm haze.
, you can never just let things go until
Dean watched him go, tugging at the edge of his jacket and trying to push away the odd feeling of envy he suddenly had. Benny seemed so comfortable around everybody, especially Alpha. Dean wanted to know what that felt like, to be
, kinda,” Dean said slowly. “I mean, it’s kinda embarrassing. You didn’t even touch me or anything, and I-”
"Shut up, Sam."
. Jesus, Cas, all you had to do was find a phone and-“
Dean moved to take it from him, but Castiel held it just out of his reach. Dean pouted and the words left his mouth before he could even think about it.
He could feel Cas’s tongue laving over his skin and along where the fangs had sunk in, half stinging as he lapped at the blood, but it also sent a delicious shiver down his spine and straight down to his cock. He whined and nuzzled his cheek against Cas’s head, finding Alpha’s hair sweaty and matted. Cas wrapped one of his arms around Dean’s waist and his other hand snaked up and around to squeeze lightly at the base of his throat, and fuck if Dean didn’t respond equally favorably to that. He arched heavily and Cas pounded relentlessly into him, grunting lightly against his skin during each thrust. The knot- which was already semi swollen before he even mounted Dean- was trying desperately to catch on Dean’s rim, making an absolutely salacious squelching sound. It had been so long, all of the emotions and sensations of the last time they’d been together like this washing over them both again in full force, and it was no wonder Cas had lost himself a little more than necessary. Dean was pretty close to that himself.
"What is it about him?"
"His sexual preferences...?"
“Cas and Gabriel were really close,” Anael said slowly, choosing her words carefully. “They were less than two years apart in age, polar opposites…” she smiled, “but I think that’s what made them such a good team, you know? Cas was always quiet, shy, real introverted. Gabriel was outspoken, sociable. Always pushing Cas outside of his comfort zone. I was only 12 when he passed, Cas was 16. But it hasn’t really gotten...easier for him through the years. Their relationship isn’t something I can really explain...or anyone, for that matter. But they had a connection that none of the rest of us did. But I think perhaps...perhaps Cas relied on him a little too heavily sometimes, and when he passed he just...he didn’t know how to
“The chase?”
“You kiss a lot,” Rory stated loudly, causing Dean to blush.
“It was clearance,” Cas says defensively.
Hello, if you're here wondering if this is a safe read (i.e. Dean and Cas are only with each other) I'm here to give you the low-down. Cas is a sexually expressive guy, and he enjoys casual sex. The tension between Cas and Dean is obvious throughout the story, but there are brief mentions of Cas with others. We do not, however, actually write smut between anyone except for Cas and Dean...so do with that what you will.
“No.”
so damn much.
Dean eyes meet Cas’s. “Cas...there’s nothing wrong with sayin’ you’re scared. You know that, right? What he did to you-”
Dean nodded shyly. “If that’s...okay.”
Rory left the kitchen munching on an apple, and they spent lunch in Cas’s room, where Missouri brought the three of them soup. They left again a few hours after, retreating back to the cabin on the hill and leaving Cas to rest. He seemed to be in even more pain and refused to take medication as long as they were there, so Dean decided to cut the visit shorter than originally planned.
“Good,” Dean huffs a laugh. “Could use the help. When Sam leaves, anyway. Not sure how much you’ll make before then, if I’m being honest.”
Yulia nodded at Castiel and looked over at Dean, finally giving him a smile and standing to shake his hand. He realized she was much more petite than even he originally thought, his hand practically enveloping hers completely.
Ache swells in Dean’s chest and it shows on his face. John nods in understanding “
Sam looks up from his book again and shrugs it off, “I’ve been reading up on Nephilim-half angel/half humans, and it says that when an angel transitions from being an angel to a human it can take up to two weeks for the vessel to adjust from the lack of grace.” “Okay but it wasn’t like that the last time, well not that we were around for that but he never said anything about it?” “Why would he Dean? It would only make you feel worse about kicking him out of the bunker. Besides Metatron did it and he thought that he was doing Cas a favor, you know letting him live a normal life and all that so he probably took all of that away.” Memories flooded his mind,
Eileen walked out in purple flannel pajamas and one of his old t-shirts. Very lightly she touched him on the arm, looking at him with worry in her eyes.
Cas stood over Dean watching his boyfriend sleep with the puppy. “Wise men say only fools rush in but I can’t help falling in love with you. Oh boy am I falling head over heels in love with you. I know you don’t appreciate Elvis as much as I do, but I don’t know many hard rock songs. Oh wait, yes I do.” Thinking back over the lyrics of the song he listened to in the car with his hunter he began to hum the tone. “Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the boys are pretty. Oh won’t you please take me home.” He was home. Dean began to stir as if he was uncomfortable, he began to whisper something incoherent. “Cas? Cas? No, no I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.” The hunter was crying now, and Cas touched his forehead, trying to peek into the nightmare. Dean was kneeling over him with an angel blade in hand, oh it was when they had gotten into a fight. Now Dean was full on sobbing over him and holding his limp body trying to revive him. “Come back. Come back. Dammit, come back! Please!” Now he was crying as well, this was too much for him to handle. “Dean. Dean wake up, I’m here.” Removing his fingers from his boyfriend’s forehead, he moved to hold Dean’s face in his hands. “I’m here, everything is fine. Shhh.” “Cas?” “It’s okay, I’m alive baby.” Dean was violently sobbing into his shoulder, “How many nightmares have you had like that?” The only response he was given is a head nod into his shoulder, “Shhh.” He stroked the other man’s hair and rubbed his back. “I’m here, I’m alive. And I love you, okay? I know you never would have hurt me. You stopped, okay? It didn’t happen.” Dean rose his head up to look at him, “It almost did, and I came so close to killing you. I’m so sorry. I’m sorry.” Kissing him on the forehead, he planted kisses all over his boyfriend’s face. “Let’s go to bed. We can leave Harry out here.” “Okay. Alright, yeah.” When Dean got up to move he was stopped by Cas, “No, it’s okay I’ll help. Your nightmare really took a toll on you. “He picked up the surprisingly light hunter and carried him to their room. “Cas? Were you singing to me earlier?” Blushing he nodded, “Yes, I didn’t know the whole song, but I figured you grew tired of hearing Elvis.” “No, I liked it. Sing to me again, please?” Smiling he nodded, “Alright. Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can’t help falling in love with you. Like a river flows, surely as it seems, darling so it goes…But I can’t help falling in love with you.” Now Dean was resting comfortably against his chest, once again he pressed his fingers onto his hunter’s head. This time the dream was peaceful and they were in a suburban home, in his arms he was holding a baby. The baby had dark hair, green eyes, with freckles scattered everywhere. “Hello little angel, how’s our baby girl today?” Their daughter was adorable and he had no doubt that he wanted this dream to become a reality in the future. He removed his fingers from the hunters head and closed his eyes, not sleeping but resting comfortably. “Why’d you stop singing?” “Sorry, you fell asleep, I can’t help falling in love with you. But I can’t help falling in love with you.” He started the song over again while he stroked the other man’s hair. All through the night he sang to his love before it was morning time. “I think you’re going to like what I have planned for today.” He had no clue what Dean was talking about but trusted him completely, “Where are we going?” “That is for me to know, and for you to find out. Soon.” Oh well, this was going to be adventurous, “What about Sam?” “He’s out running again with Harry, said he was going to go a different route though. Guess he didn’t want to run into that chick again huh?” Reading the text off of the phone before showing Cas. He watched Dean crawl out of bed, “Come on, I need to shower, and I want you to help.” With a wink they were off to the shower and that was an adventure indeed. He never knew how kinky the hunter could be, and how dangerous shower sex actually was. Afterwards, they ate cereal in silence. “What’s wrong? We’re going to have fun, is it Sam? He’s a grown moose he can take care of himself.” “No, no it’s not that. I just like your cooking.” “I thought you didn’t eat food?” “I don’t need to, but I enjoy eating your cooking. It doesn’t taste like molecules, it tastes like love and home.” Dean got up and went over to where he was sitting and sat in his lap. “I didn’t know, I’ll cook more often. We’re just strapped for time is all.” Strapped for time? Why on earth would they need to be on time to some place? Weird. As they loaded into the Impala, he scooted over to where Dean was sitting in the driver’s seat. They held hands as they drove for countless number of hours before reaching a high school? “Dean why are we at a high school for adolescents?” Grinning like a mad man he put a finger up to the angel’s lips. “Just trust me, okay?” Nodding in agreement, he followed Dean out of the car. They interlocked hands and walked into what looked like a theatre. “The show has already started, what is this anyways?” On the program they were handed read Supernatural: The Musical. It was well into the second act when he recognized a figure on stage in a trench coat. “Is that me?” They found there seats before he got his answer, the person imitating him on stage was singing a song. “I’ll just wait here then, I’ll wait for you.” How did they know that’s what he said after the phone conversation ended? “This is based off the books that Chuck wrote, he knew everything that happened.” It showed Castiel watching over Dean as he slept, “I didn’t know that anybody knew that I did that…” “I did.” Looking lovingly into each other’s eyes they kissed right there in the theatre. “I love you.” “I love you too.” “Come on, this is only the beginning.” Oh boy. There was no telling where he would be taken to now. “When you we’re human, I wasn’t around as much as I would have liked to be. I was too worried about Sam, and Gadreel wouldn’t have let you stayed. It killed me to tell you to leave, especially after you told us about you and April. But now that your grace is fading I want you to know all the positives of being human.” “Aw, sweetie the best thing about being alive at all is being with you.” “Okay, okay enough chick flick moments, even Sammy said I was being ‘domestic’, but you know what? I kind of like it.” Smiling at each other they got in the Impala and drove for what seemed like hours. “Where are we going?” “You’ll see, just relax and enjoy the ride. It’d be nice if you’d sing again” “Dean that’s very flattering but I don’t know many songs. You can turn on the radio though, and I will sing along.” “Okay.” Turning on the radio he heard Taylor Swift coming through, “Boys only want love if its torture, don’t say I didn’t say I didn’t warn ya.” Dean laughed before pulling into a drive way, trying to figure out where they were he read a Welcome sign with a jar of honey next to it. “Dean, where are we?” “A bee farm where they make honey. I figured you’d want to see it.” He had the best boyfriend ever, and he would be sure to show him that night. “Of course I do. This is so cool.” Walking inside they signed the wavers and suited up to handle the bees. Cas had never smiled brighter than when he was with Dean, bees flying all around them. “They enjoy our presence and are happy to share their hard work with us.” “So that means that I can take some honey home right?” “Yes, we’re allowed to. What will you do with it?” “I don’t know yet, maybe we can store it and use it for some stuff later.” Oh. “This is nice, I enjoy it here.” “Yeah it’s nice isn’t it? They even have chairs for us to sit in.” Dean sat down and motioned for him to come and sit on his lap. Humming along the way he rested his head against his hunters, laughing as the mask got in the way. “Come on that’s get out of here.” “Okay babe.” A bell dinged above their head as they made their exit, “Thank you! Come again soon!” He had no doubt that they would indeed return, maybe Sam could come this time. When they got in the car he heard Dean’s stomach growl indicating that he required food sometime soon. “Are you hungry? We can get some burgers if you’d like.” “Yeah sounds good to me, hopefully they’ll have some pie.” “What is your favorite desert besides pie? If that’s possible.” “PIE!” They laughed and interlocked fingers as they pulled up to diner. “Two please.” The waitress seated them in a booth and set down the menus. “What will you two gentlemen be drinking today?” “Two coffees black, and a coke. Thanks.” “What are you going to order? We should order something odd and different.” “Funny. Who knew angels had senses of humor?” “I’m very funny, if you only knew me when I was in the garrison you’d think I was very humorous indeed.” “Bet you we’re.” He looked at the menu before deciding to order a run of the mill burger. “Two cheeseburgers with everything and fries on the side.” “We are so original it’s crazy. What would your father say?!” Dean frowned, “He’d call me a queer for being in love with a man, and then a freak for dating an angel.” He frowned at his boyfriend, he had only meant to be sarcastic but didn’t know how hard the Winchesters childhood was. Sure he was their guardian angel but he had only assumed that post the last ten years. “Was he always abusive? I mean no disrespect of course but…” “No, he wasn’t abusive, well. Not usually. Only when I lost Sam did he lash out against me. He was just so filled with revenge and bitterness that it over took his whole life. He raised us the best he could but, truth be told Bobby was more of a father to me than Dad ever was. Bobby taught me how to play baseball, he told me how to talk to girls and everything. I think he knew that you and I were in love too because he always checked on me like feelings wise every time you left or went God on us. All Dad ever taught me was how to make silver bullets and sawed off shot guns. Other than that, he didn’t much care about me. It was always protect Sam, watch over Sam. Sam, Sam, Sam. But I don’t hate him for that. I love my little brother and wouldn’t trade being his parental figure for anything. When he would bring a girl home, it was always me she met. If he wanted to do something he asked me, I cooked the meals, and I took care of him when he was sick. I still do. But I don’t care what my father or anybody else thinks about us being together. I cared for too long about that, it’s what stopped me from confessing my feelings for you in the very beginning. I knew when you rebelled for me that you were something different, and after purgatory there just no denying it that I was in love with you.” He was tearing up and it didn’t embarrass him to show what his boyfriend’s words meant to him. “I never knew the extent of it, I’m sorry. But all of those things makes you who you are today, and I would never trade that for anything. I love the man you are, and if that’s because John Winchester was a terrible father then oh well. You are a brave, selfless, strong, sweet and loving man who loves everyone fearlessly. I knew when I first raised you from hell that you were more than just a righteous man, I knew that you were meant to be my righteous man. It’s why I wasn’t scared to rebel, because you, and Sam are my family. If it makes you feel any better my Father is a major douche bag too. And to make things worse he has a serious God complex thing going on.” Dean laughed as he leaned over to press their lips together firmly. “You’re great, you know? And you’re very funny, actually.” “I know.” “That’s another thing, we have got to get you caught up on pop culture okay? I know metadouche filled your head with some things but I want you to experience it for yourself. Sound good?” “Yes it sounds awesome.” “You’ve picked up some Winchester lingo you know that? Don’t worry I like it.” Finishing their burgers Dean turned to him, “So how was the burger? Good eh?” “Yes, it was good. Although Sam tells me that you also make a good burger. Is this true?” “No. I make a kick-ass burger!” His face hurt he was smiling so hard at his love. “I’ll have to see that for myself.” “Oh really now? That’s okay, I’ll show you one of these days.” “Promise?” “Promise.” He realized where Dean had taken him when he saw all the other cars and the movie screen at the front. “What are we going to watch?” “Guess.” “I don’t know tell me? Please?” “Alright it’s called It’s a Wonderful Life. There’s an angel in it called Clarence, that’s why Meg called you that. Also I want you to watch it so you can understand Christmas a little bit.” “Okay love.” You want the moon? I’ll get ya the moon if that’s what you want, just say the word and it’s yours. The movie was half way over and Dean was curled up in his lap. They were sitting on a blanket sprawled out in front of the Impala. He ran his fingers through the light brown hair and made circles on the small of his back. “Do you want the moon Dean?” “Sure Cas, that’d be nice.” “Okay, I’ll call Crowley tomorrow then.” “He’s lucky to be alive, that red eyed bastard. Do not call him, please.” “Of course I won’t but he does in fact own the moon. Well hell does anyways. You don’t want the moon anyways, it’s ugly up close.” Dean chuckled at him, “How about a star?” “Sure thing. Close your eyes and don’t move okay? I’m going to move us to a more remote location so we don’t freak the locals.” “Alright.” They were now sitting in a meadow still on a blanket and in his hand he held a tiny ball of gas, “Here, this is a part of the little dipper, its size is much larger of course, but I had to minimize it in order for it to not burn me or your eyes.” “It’s beautiful Cas. It kind of looks like your eyes, the bright blue of it.” “Thanks. Jimmy’s of Russian descent and they have blue eyes like are like the sea. I can’t say they compare to yours. There very pretty, all of the green and tiny flecks of brown in there is gorgeous.” “Come here” was all Dean said before pulling Cas on top of him pressing their lips together. They made love slowly in an empty meadow where no one could hear there moans and sighs. He wrapped the blanket around them and hummed to his boyfriend, “But I’ve got you, under my skin. And I like you under my skin.”
this is a terrible idea.”
However, she scoffs. “Forget those idiots, man. I don’t give a flying fuck what they think.” With her trademark all-or-nothing attitude, she leans forward with blazing eyes, excited to fight for a cause again. He’s reminded of her war-painted looks at college protests, and wonders now if she had ever stopped attending them.
“I’m not going to change my mind,” he says, a little impatient. Closing his eyes, he takes a deep breath, tries to reel himself back in. “You don’t need to be there. I’m going to be fine.”
I want. I like you carrying me.”
“Dean, please, don’t say anything just because of some weird human obligation to-”
"Alright, you have to be careful because silver is hard to come by so don't spill it." Cas nodded and poured the silver into the holdings. When they finished up, Dean handed him ear muffs before putting on his own. Next they would practice at the shooting range. "Alright, this one doesn't pack too much of a kick, it's already loaded, but it's on safety, which is this switch right here. See?" Once again the angel nodded, he was familiar with weapons of all types due to his time in the garrison but he enjoyed being taught by Dean anyways. "Stand this way" the hunter said as he corrected the angels posture. "I don't think this lesson requires your hand on my ass Dean." Dean grinned, "Come on it doesn't have to be all work and no play does it?" "When I'm holding a weapon, perhaps." The hunter rolled his eyes but didn't remove his hand, until he moved to stand behind him and take the gun from the angel to show him how to place both his hands firmly on the gun," Alright undo the safety, move the slide like this and then aim- fire." Cas purposely missed what he was shooting for. "It's okay, you'll get it. Now it'll be harder because the freaks aren't going to stay still, they'll come running at you so you need to know how to aim at that but we'll work on that later. Try again, focus your eyesight and loosen your shoulders a bit." Cas did as he was instructed, aimed and shot again. This time he got it perfect. "That's my angel. Good job babe. Now let's see if you can do that good with a moving target." Pushing a button the targets began to move sideways, "Alright same thing except aim for where there going to be. You got it?" This was amicably harder than the first time and he missed the target, and this time it wasn't on purpose. "Dean, this is hard." The hunter resisted the urge to gape at how cute the frustrated angel was and instead showed him how to aim for where the target was going to be. "See? Don't worry you'll get it" Cas did as he was told and aimed for where he thought the target would be and shot closer to the targets heart. "See? That's better, now do it again, but relax, I guarantee that's why your missing it." He was so nervous about his lesson with Dean he knew he needed to relax and that was the cause behind him missing, why else would he an ex solider miss a cardboard target? Thinking back to the first time Dean told him he loved him he smiled, it always worked.
