"No. No, I was already up, do you want to come in?", Wade offered and Peter flashed a small smile.
. A home where he wasn't allowed to be by himself, not even in his
"Oh I could never.", Peter chuckled. "But there are a few things I'd miss if I met an untimely demise.", he said, sporting a knowing smile.
Two hours later Gwen was passed out and Peter's mind was going a hundred miles a minute. His body was exhausted but his head wouldn't shut off. He couldn't stop tossing and turning and eventually he just got up and made his way to the kitchen.
"Great, Love you.", he said and even though he was pissed off Peter still embraced Wade and gave him a quick kiss. Because the last time that they parted after a fight Peter almost died without confessing his feelings and he didn't want that kind of regret again.
"It's okay.", Peter shrugged before taking another drag. A beat of silence followed, then:"Do you think she's mad at me?"
"Okay, then let me be so nice to explain it. After your people pumped me full of drugs and picked my brain apart for days on end you just send me home because, 'hey, we solved the problem, let them deal with the aftermath'. But tell me, did you ever wonder what it feels like to recover from the shit you put me through?"
"Here we are, hold him still.", Gwen ordered, pushing Peter into the arms of their tormentors. One of them pulled out a metal collar, handing it to Gwen. She then reach up to Peter's neck and started to lock it around his throat.
Then he spoke, his voice strong and determined."Imagine her coming back to you, but she isn't quite the same, she's been through some shit, some horrible shit, maybe she's really fucked up, maybe she doesn't even remember you. Would you care?"
, that sounded like an awful idea, in light of recent events and Peter seemed aware of that. He was quick to explain himself. "It's not like that- I don't want to kill myself.", he added but Bucky wasn't convinced.
"See if I care." Weasel didn't pay attention to Wade's senseless mumbling. The two had been buddies for so long that none of Wade's psycho behaviour surprised Weasel anymore. He just poured him another drink and then another one and so on and so forth.
“It's good to see you awake stark,” Gaurd McCrawl (as tony had dubbed him now) said Running a hand up tony's ankle towards his knee “it would make this so much more fun” he continued rubbing tony knee there was an echo of chuckling in the room as the Guards cackled the feeling of dread run up his spine as McCrawl's hand went higher up to his thigh resting near his crotch.
“Daddy I can’t see”
Thinking fast tony closed his eyes but other then darkness he couldn't see a thing through Mason's eyes *Macie sweetheart can you hear me Come on honey answer me* tony called out toward Mason's.
“let me take care of your doll” Steve whisper as he grinds his length faster against tonies.
“yes of course, anyways your highness mind, if i speak to you for a moment in private” Tony ask T'challa, he didnt needs to wait long for an answer as T'challa nodded, making their way toward the balcony it was secure with security roaming the premises also private nobody could listen into there conversation.
“Yes thank you, but that is not what i wanted to discuss, ever since Enchanted humans or Mutants came to be in the world they were mostly run by the UN, judged unfairly due to their gifts” Tony explained.
The king rose to shake Tony’s hand before they took their seats “thank your highness for seeing me again I know you must be a busy man so I’ll make it short” Tony said.
“Thanks, cuddle bear take all the time you need right now we will find a way to protect her until then dont worry we got it covered on this end, kick their asses Godpappa” Tony chuckles ignoring the other man's glare.
I won't give out any spoilers but so you know i was this close to being right so close but nooo it didn't match the second name damn it i was thinking about changing it to those who understand what I'm talking about let me know if i should
The arranging of parties and meeting was also tiring him out, Tony was now almost 3 months pregnant and he could see the small changes to his body easy to hide but still a little alarming.
“And how will that be”.
“What can we do,” Steve said as he stood walking toward the window, the burning sensation in his chest had gotten worse, he needed to punch something, he wanted to punch something but he couldn't because it wouldn't help.
Tony has an uninvited guest
“I.i wouldn't know what ill do, yes Rogers Deserves to know but it doesn't mean he should know and even if he did there is nothing he could do about it, he is a wanted criminal in 117 country's Tony do you really want that in your daughter's life” Rhodey ranted on not even hearing tony say his name, he hated that Rhodey had a point not because he thought Rogers would be a bad influence but because there was nothing he would be able to do even if he had wanted to(which tony have doubts about) but none the less.
He was grumpy, he could admit it but at his current state who wouldn't be and nobody could blame him either “My feet hurt, my back hurts, my head hurts, i feel bloated and I'm tired, ever since she started moving I've been so uncomfortable, i can't sleep because she won't stop when she starts playing soccer with my ribs, not to mention she is sitting on my bladder making me want to pee every 10 minutes at most, so yes Miss Potts I'm grumpy you would be to, ” Tony said as he reached back to rub his back he didnt want to go off on pepper she was only doing her job and looking out for him, God he just wanted to go home.
“what the hell” Tony whispered.
“Start a new life tony, when the baby is born, go somewhere disappear raise her as a normal father, not as Ironman or tony stark, just as tony a    mechanic,” Rhodey said
“fine be that way,” was all tony heard as a needle was stuck into his neck and everything went dark.
Ooo what do we have here
Letting out a sigh Charles turns to go toward a class he knew he should be teaching at the moment but he was distracted when a barely audible ring zipped through his mind along with a few images of tony tied to a bed changing to a base covered in snow, with more images comes a rush spread up his arms and leg as enery goes through him, the last image that was shown was of a map and with big letters Russia was shown to him.
“Due to recent term of events with is unknown to the public i have come to a decision, I Tony Stark is retiring from The Avengers and as Iron Man” Tony Announced, questions after questions were thrown at him light flashing in his eyes as the crowd went wild he waited a few minutes before he continued “I have come to this decision because the safety and security of my child is my biggest priority i am retiring to raise my child, colonel Rhodes and vision is still active avengers member and will be active at all time if needed i will take to the suit and help but other then that i am fully retired even though i am retired ill always be Iron Man thank you” as he walked down the paparazzi stormed tony if pepper hadn't set the extra security they would have broken through.
Kings T'challa P.O.V
Clearing his throat the doc stated“medical researchers have been working on a way for men and trans females to became pregnant by transplanting a womb to there lower torso, but that has not been achieved yet, however, there have been few cases, that is quite similar to yours where a scientist named Josh debroski experimented on an involuntary patients, resulted in an unwanted pregnancy and debroski losing his licence and 12 years in prison.”
“ill give you all some privacy to talk” the doctor responded as he left the room.
“I do appreciate it, your highness, oh one more thing” Tony reached into his pocket retrieving the phone“Could you give this to Barton it has a number of a pilot that will take him to his family, oh dont worry it's not bugged”.
“So what do we do” Sam ask.
Anyways here are new chapters
Feeling tony pull away from the kiss, Steve looked at him confused “Tony what are you doing”.
Walking around the pools of blood tony reached masons side and started undoing masons binds making her scream in surprise
Coming out of shock from the pregnancy announcement meer minutes before putting a hand on Tony shoulder hoping to support his friend, Rhodey asked“what happened to the patients.” still couldn't believe what he was hearing. not liking the none-answer the doctor was giving Rhodey opened his mouth to ask again but was interrupted with pepper bursting into the room face full of worry
“like I told you I like seeing the red light blink” Tony stated putting his pad down “okay Ross you have me here what is it that you want from me if you haven't noticed I'm a busy man I don't have a lot of time”
Feeling a hand move up his chest tony turned his head to look who it was when he put his sight on a very naked Steve he only had a blanket over his lower body “Steve” tony gasp steve was in his bed how he didn't know but he was there naked and he couldn't bring himself to care
Anger was too little of a word to explain what tony was feeling right now ever since Hawaii Ross had been down his throat about LETTING rogers getaway, not the Roque Avengers getting away only the one and only Captain America, Steve Rogers which in case was kind of true tony did let them go but he  wasn't going to admit that to Ross no less, watching the vain pulse in Rosse's forehead was quite satisfying, Ross was getting more and more power-hungry by the day the fact that Ross threatened Tony with treason nearly made him laugh “Treason, ill like too see what you'll tell the population of 117 country's that catching Captain America is more important than their safety and you are quite willing to throw the person who sees to that safety in Prison” Tony had told Ross watching him go all kinds of red made his day a little infuriating.
“Well funny thing is, well not funny it's actually unpleasant and horrible-”
Letting out a tired sigh “alright let’s go” Rhodey did know better to argue with tony with that tone so he let it go.
Yauh i removed the chapter count because this is going to be bigger then i expected
Soon the clean air of the tower started to fade and the smell of mold and shoe polish came at tony but it was an undertone as a strong copper smell reached Tony’s nose he stiffens when he realized it was blood he was smelling on top of the mold and shoe polish, God he hope it wasn’t his little girls blood, straining his ears tony heard the sound of sewers and nearby traffic when suddenly the sound of Brooklyn’s train came to his ears and then he knew where she was *Hold on sweetheart daddy’s coming* tony said before he went out of her head and opened his eyes to two pair of worried eyes.
Time Skip by you ever loving author <3<3
*“No we don't, you need to go Steve” *
*Daddy* a tiny voice echoed into his head.
“I do understand that the Avengers or any other Enchanted individuals operations such as the Avengers, Earth defenders, X men, and Shield needs supervision the people are entrusting their lives in our hands and that is a trust we cannot lose but Giving even the United Nation that much power of deployment whenever and wherever they deemed fit its just too much I'm not saying their all not to be trusted I'm just saying there will be times where power like that could go to a person's head and they will abuse it and innocents will get hurt” Stark explained T'challa could see where stark was coming from he knew there are many unsavory characters within the Government that liked to hide in the back and also play with the higher powers strings to get what they want.
Turning back toward them, Hank and Erik had bow on the couch he had been on moments ago, the kid was still out cold he felt guilty even if he had no idea what had happened.
“the largest pulses are coming from New York boss” Friday answered.
“ Pep I know it's not normal and I know I'm not ready to be a father but who ever really is and god knows ill never idmit this I am scared, you and Rhodey has been the only family I had and then the others came and left now i only have you, Rhodey, vision hell even the kid but now he sigh now I have this baby growing inside me the only flesh and blood family I am ever going to get I'm not going to give that up so I'm asking you no I'm begging you to please support me in this”he looked at pepper with pleading eyes hoping she would support him
“Pep what is it everything alright”
“I know you did” replied her father the sound of a weapon charging up caught his attention he looked back “get down” he shouted pushing her uncle down raising his shield to cover them as the energy shot bounced off the shield blowing a hole in the train.
“ as long as you call me Charles, tony these are a few of my close friend's Eric lehnsherr along with hank macCoy, jean grey, and Scott Summers you can trust them just as much as you can trust me, shall we take this inside” Charles had to be cautious he didn't know stark all that well but by the look of it stark didn't trust just anyone.
“No, you wouldn’t even know I’m there”
“It’s okay we will look into it later let’s get you home first,” Tony said caring mason to safety.
“So your basically building another Robot,” Rhodey said as he glanced worriedly at tony giving at what Tony had been through Rhodey should have known that Tony would never create something like Ultron again and also that the program didnt have the mind stones influence on it.
“Any idea to where the money is going Fry,” Tony asked placing the paperwork on the neatly placed pile he had sorted out, he was already getting irritated at the pile (Why were there so much paperwork)he was really tempted to leave it be but out of the thing he had to do and the things he could do in his state right now the paperwork was a safer bet.
Walking up to Charles as he sat by the window look out the courtyard, it was late everyone was asleep Charles always go down the halls to check if everything was fine with the students, but tonight he didn't which was strange in itself.
“Your eyes,” Rhodey said gesturing towards his face so that Tony could understand.
°°°°°°#+#°°°°°°
He and Charles had sat one side and watched as mason played with Rex he still couldn’t understand what he had seen watching as his daughter turn a metal robotic dog that had only been made out of wire and metal into a really barking playing dog with a sleek metal body that shifted and changed as he went.
“How did you learn that Macie,” Charles asked watching as mason placed the energy ball back into Rex turning the robotic dog back to it yippy happy self-chasing it's tail as it bounded off to play.
Being led to the kings office sure was a reminder of when he was pregnant with his daughter and her first movement he also remembered he wanted mason to be able to protect herself meaning sending her for martial arts training when she was a little older, with just the thought of mason the tingle at the back of his head returned but he pushed it away as they enter the kings office.
Shrugging Tony placed the folders back into case “just higher up officials who uses their power for their own gain wanting the mutant and enchanted individuals as soldiers and slaves because they are unnatural and doesn’t deserve any rights not to mention a curtain one who had a size able collection of kiddy porn and so on I can go on if you want me to” tony said but stopped as T’challa raised his hand to make him stop the look of disgust and bitterness echoed on his face even the Dora in the room looked disgusted.
"He, actually.", Peter replied with a small grin of his own and MJ's smiled widened now.
If you wanna chat or leave some requests for fun, angsty or fluffy one-shots, hit me up on Insta: @dead_cherry_bitch or Tumblr: dead-cherry-bitch
"So that's what this is about."
. Peter seemed to have humor which was great news, it's usually the first thing you lose, unless you're mental of course, like Wade.
Peter didn't laugh or smile, he didn't reply at all at first. "So, you think I'm scared? And self destructive?", his tone was much colder than Wade expected. When Peter noticed his surprise he tapped against his ears with one finger. "I thought I mentioned the supersenses."
-", his whimpering turned into gasps and choked off sobs and Wade wanted to rip apart everyone that contributed to this.
"Are you buying my love?", Peter asked with a grin.
For a moment Peter didn't know what to respond. Sure, maybe she was faking the guilt but Peter didn't think so. He was good at reading lies. He was raised by liars. But just because she was telling the truth didn't mean that all was good now.
"And that I needed to tell you something. ", Peter completed his sentence before glancing up at Wade, looking so fucking vulnerable without seeming weak at all and it was killing Wade. "Did I tell you?", Peter asked carefully.
"Yeah...pack it all in...", the robber chuckled. Something was wrong with him, maybe he was crazy, maybe he was on something but he definitely wasn't right in the head. When Karen packed all the money into the bag she went to hand it to the man.
There was something heartbreaking about how matter-of-factly Peter spoke about himself. "Peter- I don't care about what they did to you, I thought I'd never see you again. I still can't believe that you're really alive and if you think that I'll send you away now, you're absolutely crazy.", Tony didn't know how to convince Peter, how to make him believe.
"Too fucking soon, Petey-Pie.", he scoffed and Peter's smile widened a bit.
"You're fucking with me, right?", he asked at the end of it and Peter stopped in his tracks to shake his head. Wade felt so fucking dumb, like the biggest moron ever. "Peter, the only reason I left is because I thought that you wanted me gone, I would've never done that if I-"

The fact that HYDRA could do this type of shit now deeply terrified Peter, it shook him to his core. HYDRA now had the power to integrate perfect sleeper agents whereever they wanted. Once they broke their mind down enough, they could activate them without even needing direct access. "She's glorious. ", Keipon sighed, stepping around Gwen and stroking her face gently, tracing her jaw with the tips of his fingers.
Gwen sat down beside him and leaned against his side before whispering so quietly that nobody but the two could hear:"Cameras?"
"Tell me about my father. ", Peter then said. "Do you know him?" Peter didn't look at him, still watching the scenery they drove by instead.
Peter blinked a few times, like he needed a while to arrive in the present, but when he did his eyes shot from Wade to Tony and he cringed. "Get- away from me-", he spoke through gritted teeth and even though they tried to hide it, Bucky could see how much his words hurt Tony and Wade.
A short one but I hope that you like it anyways, the next one will probably be a larger one so it might take longer.
"Go. We'll be fine.", MJ nodded.
Peter could barely hold his eyes open anymore, he breathed in air and breathed out blood, he was shutting down, but still... still he was comforting Wade. "Shh... it's all good... You were great, you were... the best...", he sighed, breathing out a final time before going completely limp, eyes shut, heart still.
"Look at you, being all autonomous, making decisions.", Wade commented and it took Peter a moment to understand what he ment. Peter never really just got himself food or planned stuff or anything. He mostly let other people do that for him. Taking control over his life was... frightening in a way that Peter didn't like thinking about. He didn't have that fear when it came to taking care of Gwen.
That startled a nervous chuckle out of Peter, too. "Yeah. I told you.", he shrugged, wrapping his arms around his torso.
Wade left.
"Nah, HYDRA gave me my powers.", he replied, keeping it as simple as possible. He didn't want to remember the experiments, the table, the needles.
"No but Bucky texted me that they'll be here in a few minutes. ", Steve replied, looking down at his phone screen. In the light of his screen Wade saw that he actually had a case of bed-head. Apparently the two had rolled out of bed for this.
There was no doubt that Bucky's Peter was Tony's son, all of a sudden it was clear as day. It explained how the boy knew who Bucky was without remembering him. It explained why he didn't have a tracker. It didn't explain why he ran off, why Peter didn't tell Bucky who he was, why he was hiding. "Bucky?", Steve asked on the other line and Bucky realized that he hadn't said anything in a while.
"Yes, Peter. Skinny guy, messy brown hair, doesn't understand pop culture. Ring a bell? You seemed pretty familiar with him last time." Wade had no time for Death's games but she never really cared much for what he wanted. Wade didn't mind her most of the time but he also knew that she was essentially a predator and he was her prey. If she wanted to play with him she would do exactly that. "Oh that one.", she said innocently as she leaned in on Wade, holding onto his neck and pressing herself against him. She wasn't warm, that's what convinced him that she wasn't Vanessa. She wasn't alive, couldn't even pretend to be, not fully. Death had never lived, she'd never understand how it felt.
"Not really the 40s... I miss my family, my friends, I miss who I used to be, who Steve used to be. But not the fucking time. The 40s sucked in comparison to now.", Bucky smirked, sounding more genuine this time.
"I'll try to not take that to heart.",Bucky returned, faking offence. But he didn't really seem bothered by it so Peter tried not to worry too much about it. Bucky wasn't mad at him, Peter wasn't being bad, at least he didn't think that he was. But he could probably do better. He put the phone away again and his eyes fell onto Bucky's phone that was still in the other man's metal hand.
Bucky must've been disappointed. He had thought that Peter could be saved. Peter always disappointed the people he loved. Still, why would he be here when they tortured him? Why would he watch? Wasn't it bad enough that the agents saw? But maybe this was his punishment, maybe they all wanted to watch him come undone, humiliate him. HYDRA used to do that. He could remember times when agents would tie his arms behind his back, blindfolded and put noise cancelling headphones on him, then they'd let him stumble around a room, completely disoriented. He didn't see the agents, he didn't hear them. He felt their stun battons. This felt a little bit like that game. Like he was completely out of control, and no matter where he turned, he was just met by agony and once things would clear he'd be met by their taunting laughs, by Lorenz' smile. Peter wanted everything to stop. He wanted to be numb again. He could be good if they just let him be numb again. He had behaved then. Things had been clear, nothing hurt.
He didn't say anything though, didn't move either. He only tracked Wade with careful eyes before he looked ahead. The highway in front of them was empty and you could see miles and miles ahead to where the blue sky clashed with the horizon.
"I... there was other things I ment to say... I don't know if I got the chance to say them. ", Peter slowly said, not meeting Tony's eyes.
"Home.", Peter replied. He had laid his arm with the broken hand around her again. Wade had never seen Peter so physically comfortable with anyone before and his chest grew tight.
I'm really happy about how this one turned out, especially since I didn't know what to write next, this kinda just spilled out of me. I'm just feeling real wholesome right now, idk.
"More like 100.", Peter pointed out and Bucky dared to smirk.
Hope you enjoyed it, as always, leave your thoughts in the comments!
"I missed you. ", he then said, quietly, carefully, like it was a difficult admission.
"I'm Peter.", Peter then introduced himself and now Natasha's eyes grew wide. She was quick and she knew Tony well. He knew that it would only take her a few seconds to figure it out.
Peter could remind them that he was deeply dissociating at the time and didn't have much of a will to live. But he thought that that might put a damper on the otherwise positive mood.
"No you're not, he just cancelled, now move your ass.", She then said, holding Wade's phone in front of his face. Wade quickly checked if that was true. Peter had texted him that something came up and that he'd call Wade in the evening.
Bucky turned out fine. That was Tony's single saving grace but even that was dwindling. Bucky had agreed to the treatment, Peter hadn't. Tony couldn't imagine how his son was feeling at the moment. He didn't want to but his mind kept spitting out one awful scenario after the other.
"I want you. I want you to stop avoiding me. You'll come back, every night you'll cone here and you'll be with me and you won't fight me, as long as you do that he lives.", Death said, looking up at him, now there was something new in her eyes, a fire, like she was challenging him.
"So did I." Peter's smile hovered for a second before fading slightly. Suddenly his eyes were downcast, his shoulders were more tense. Like he was bracing himself. Wade just had no clue for what.
Peter was only half listening but Wade's voice had a soothing effect while Peter tried to relax. Slowly, very slowly, he eased up a little, the warmth and the smell and the sound of Wade's deep voice all helping him to unwind. For a while he just allowed himself to melt into the warmth. This was okay. This was good.
Peter eyed over to the mercenary. He completely stopped wearing his mask when they were alone in the car, only putting it on when other people might see.
"They did not.", FRIDAY replied. As relieving as that sounded at first, it only confirmed Wade's suspicions that Peter wasn't the one to take the jet.
"But he's a kid, kids are protected in the accords.", Steve argued.
"I will!", Gwen threatened, taking the gun and placing it directly against Peter's forehead now, her finger on the trigger. Peter knew she wouldn't. Not when she was like this, cracking, seconds away from collapsing. HYDRA was wrong. They didn't build the perfect weapon. They couldn't. Because they weren't weapons,  they were people.
It's the Canyon chapter y'all and it's pretty fluffy! Tell me your thoughts in the comments!!!
"Why are you here...", he then asked, neutral. Peter was quick to put up his walls again once he was in control.
"You can threaten us all you want Peter but we're not leaving you by yourself when you're this-", Tony started.
"He asked for you.", Steve replied with a shrug and Wade tried to ignore the little jump his heart made. No, he wasn't supposed to feel happy about this. Peter had to be real fucked up, if he asked for him and that was not something to be happy about.
, a little voice in Wade's head said and this time it wasn't one of his boxes. That was all him.
"It's cool. I wasn't that into it anyways. I actually... I think I'm into someone else...", Peter confessed, hoping to lessen her guilt. It was weird to confess something out loud that he had barely even admitted to himself but it also felt freeing in a way.
He didn't know where they were going, and quite honestly, he wasn't interested in staying awake or pulling through. So he kept his eyes closed as he waited to fade away once more.
He didn't know what to say, how to relief the tension. Wade caved first, looking away, out the window. It was a clear day, sunny and bright. "Do you know where you'll go, already?", Wade asked, because the silence pained him.
"Boss, the communication channel between the jets is still open. We might get a reply. ", FRIDAY suddenly alerted them.
"'Cause of the crash sight, the blood, you really shouldn't be alive. Plus, your friend spoke to Death and she told him you were dead? Whatever that's about. ", Bucky sighed but Peter didn't seem to be listening anymore. He was staring into space, not a good sign. "Peter?"
This time he couldn't stop his eyes from spilling over and his throat closed up to the point that Peter wasn't sure, if he could even breathe, let alone respond.
"No, you don't...you... fuck!", Tony exclaimed, his tone frustrated,
"Don't look at me like that.", Peter said, glancing over and Bucky quickly looked ahead again.
"Don't worry, I'm getting you out.", he replied before gently separating from her.
"Where is your chatty friend?", Tony asked.
He'd be by himself, on the run from HYDRA. The thought alone made him spiral, his heart beat quickened and tears threatened to spill all while a voice that wasn't his own screamed in his head:"
"I think the bath made me tired...", Peter slurred before letting himself fall back into the bed, it was soft, like a marshmallow, or at least that's how he imagined one, he'd never eaten them before.
"I know, okay? I know. I love you, too Gwen.", He returned and she let go of his hands, pushing them aside to wrap her arms around him instead.
Of course that didn't answer any questions. Why was he alive? What did they do to him? Why put his real name at the top of the file? (That last one was quite easy, if he thought about it. Considering that she wrote this at 2 am, Janna, the author, probably had the mental capacity of a tea spoon and it was just too damn convenient)
"I don't want to die." It was a strange realization for Peter. He had wasted so much time with hating existence and now that he was dead he wanted nothing more than more time.
"What does that mean?", Peter asked, because he had no idea.
"Okay, then let's talk about it.",Steve nodded before glancing over at Peter. "Pete?" Peter's eyes grew distant for a second but not long enough for Steve or Natasha to notice. Like he checked out for a moment but then he was back.
"I see why you'd think that. But can't you imagine, for just one second, that maybe people aren't going to reject you?", Wade asked and Peter didn't need to think about that one for long.
Wade gave him a worried look but dropped the topic. "Yeah, sure." With that they fell back into silence. It seemed to be a bit of a routine with them. They'd find a topic, talk about it until it got to a point where Peter felt his own issues crashing down on him, then they would become quiet. It was stressful, and exhausting but Peter didn't know what else to do, he didn't know how to be normal, how to have small talk and be okay.
"I convinced him to take some time off. It's all been taking a huge toll on him.", Steve rushed to his aid, placing on hand on Tony's shoulder and he already felt fractionally calmer.
"Don't know, ask me once I know if this is a load of bullshit.", he snapped and Wade couldn't help but to flinch ever so slightly at the aggression in his voice. Peter noticed and seemed to immediately regret it, softening a little for Wade' s sake.
"I think he's disassociating. He isn't really here, at least not in his mind.", Wade explained before reaching out to cup Peter's face with his hands, the boy was trembling ever so slightly under his touch, not enough to see it, only to feel.
"Yeah three years ago, once I was released from SHIELD. Steve took me. It was one of the first things he did. Like he promised.", Bucky replied. This was a pleasant memory. Even though Bucky had still been half out of his mind back then, even though he couldn't remember his dream of seeing the Grand Canyon, even though Steve had to practically drag him there. It had been absolutely amazing. They spend a week there, camping underneath the open sky. No one around them but each other. It had been perfect. Bucky's heart ached with how perfect it had been. He had started to piece the broken shards of his mind back together at the bottom of that canyon.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Fuck you...", Wade sighed before stepping closer to Peter and lifting his limp body up again. God, he was as light as a feather.
From what he heard Peter had one friend in his life and she died. That's not a great track record. And it would definitely stunt someone when it comes to forming new relationships.
“Tony."Wake up”. A very familiar voice echoed in the room.
“i know that's what we love about Tony he never give up, he is going to need help and we will be there for him” it was going to be a rough ride for Tony he knew that and he wished he could take some of it away for him but he couldn't all he could do now was be there for him whenever he needed it.
“what exactly is it you want me to do Mr. Stark”
I dont own Marval just the O.C
“Don't know, just suddenly there was a sharp pain?” Tony said watching the doctor work tony couldn't explain what had happened he had never experienced that kind of pain before and he knows a lot about pain.
“Son of a bitch” McCrawl yelped as he stumbled back feeling up his mouth with his hand a single drop of blood told tony he bit hard enough to draw blood giving him a rush of satisfaction but it didnt last long as McCrawl grabbed him by the jaw again “Your going to regret that stark, you know i wanted to go easy on you but it seems you wanna play rough” the cruel gleam in McCrawls eyes spiked tony's fear, oh god he was really going to get raped, tony struggled as McCrawl start undoing his uniform the sound of sippers echoed around the room told tony the other guards were going the same“Grab and spread his legs we dont want him kicking us when we have our fun” McCrawl said getting on the makeshift bed and between Tony's legs, tony kicked and tried to get away as far as he could until the other two guards came and grabbed his legs and another one started undoing tony's pants.
“Is the, re a problem colonel Rhodes”.,
Pacing back and forth tony didn’t even want to think about what was happening to his little girl or how scared she should be, he shouldn’t have left it was his fault he shouldn’t have left he left her unprotected, he didn’t blame pepper he knew that she was a busy person with running his business and now helping him with trying to protect his daughter with all good it did she’s gone kidnapped by the very man he was trying to protect her from, it was all his fault.
“Like who the Avengers, the world..”Rhodey replied angerly
“Sir we saw him, yes he just left, yes sir he was alone, yes sir we will and no he hasn't shown any signs yet, we will keep watch, will do sir” Ending the call he started the car and drove the same direction stark went.
“Tony look, wait what” was all he got out before he was pulled down and kissed.
“Mr. Stark” Laura was completely confused the last time she saw him was when he had hidden out at her farm,“Did something happen,” she asked Tony.
Names Jilliezax247 also RedStarFox
“Okay, Goodnight Tony” Rhodey said.
Again thanks for the comments and kudo's
“I hate to be the bearer of bad news but our little escape artists have escaped,” Rhodey said pointing towards the empty high chair.
What he ever did to deserve her he will never know but he was thankful.
The lie was just simply a bad one even Okoye raised a brow at it but didn’t say a word and neither did T’challa although it made him curious to how did one man go from deaths door to be as healthy as a horse “what exactly is it you wanted to talk to me about” T’challa asked glancing at the folders curiously.
“Yes I’m sorry sir I need to go some, the thing has happened and they need, ed me,” Rhodey said shaking his hand.
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
“stark is nothing but bad news your highness and for all, we know it could be bugged” Barton sneered making T'challa's blood boil stark had so far done nothing but try and help barton and his family not to mention helping the avengers get free.
Tony could see he piqued the king's interest it wasn't every day someone came to the king with such a proposal, it was a risk asking the king before he got the ball rolling but he needed the support he was going to speak with Charles again after he did his 7 months check-up, he was really glad he didnt show as much as he should and oversized clothed did well to hide the bump that he had it was quite adorable and it had given him more time in the public eye the gala was his last so he needed to make it work it had helped that the king was here as well although he still thinks pepper had something to do with that he just couldn't prove it.
Jean had left to get the student Charles had referred too as stark laid down on one of the sofas as they waited so he took his chance to mentally ask, he knew Charles would hear him.
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
Upon arrival in Wakanda, Tony had to completely shut down his mind from reaching out the massive throb he had gotten was horrendous and he wasn't even in Wakanda when it had started the buzz that went underneath his skin when they went through the barrier was also very unpleasant the amount of power that went through his head when they had reached the city scared him and the fact that the metal was whispering at him was even more unsettling, he was now regretting that he had agreed to come to Wakanda but he couldn't say no to the king when it was offered so he wasn't backing down, it wasn't as if the technology wasn't impressive because it was but the info that had been trying to force its way into his head was overpowering he just needed to push through it.
“It would be best if i didn't plausible deniability and such,” Stark stated giving T'challa a half smile before continuing “Can't exactly have the masses wonder if it was some political movement on Wakanda's part now would we,”.
Little curious.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sitting in the principal office mason rubbed the sleep out of her eyes she had slept for an hour before tony had woken her up he didn’t want to but they both need to be there when they talked to her principle.
Disorganized to the point Charles started to get a migraine from trying to sort out some of the thoughts that went through his mind, the thoughts were going to fast for Charles to keep up with them and no matter where he dug himself in he always seems to get lost in starks mind, it was interesting and confusing all in one mind stack.
It was a somewhat normal afternoon he had gone to meetings in the morning, did the paperwork that pepper needed him to do and most important part got seen by his employees it was a weird feeling to be out and about after being cooped up for so long but it necessary giving that tony was near the end of his first trimester and he was really starting to show luckily he could still hide under oversized clothes and the excuse he gained weight is still in the works.
Making his way up to take a shower, he contemplated if he wanted to find out who the other father was he knew he needed to know if he needed to take action when the time comes to tell his son\daughter who their other father was and if he wanted to know if he was having a girl or boy it didn't really matter to him although he wouldn't know what to really do with a girl thank god for pepper
“I hope your right Tony” Charles turned and rolled back towards the mansion Tony rubbed his hand down his face he hoped he was right to God knows what could happen
Watching as Tony turned and looked into one of the reflected surfaces only to turn back around with a confused expression on his face, but not as confused as Rhodey's as Tony had turned back around Rhodey saw Tony's eyes had gone back to its natural brown “what about them” Tony asks.
He would bet that the procedure had taken out of tony it wasn't every day you give a c. Section to a man before nor being pregnant either.
“Rogers, what the hell are you doing here,” Tony asked ignoring the way his body vibrated with energy with Steve presents he looked older with his beard and messy hair, his suit looked well cleaned and repaired.
His baby, tony jerked upright feeling his stomach when he felt the flatness of his stomach panic started to set in, where is his baby.
“Tony we need to talk,” Steve said stepping closer to tony.
Sitting in the gardens of Wakanda was the favorite part of Steve's day, with the beautiful flowers and clean fresh smell he could come here and relax while he draws, they had made a small arrangement with T'challa he would allow all of them to stay as long as they stay hidden in turn they would be able to go out and do missions while keeping under the radar giving off the impression that they were never there, he had finished his daily exercise had a nice long shower and just sat down when one of the Dora came and stood beside him.
Tony closes his eyes as he braces for the pain to come he couldn't do anything the pain zipping up and down his body made him almost paralyzed, but only nothing came opening his eyes Tony saw the guard holding the gun towards him but something was off, it was as if the guard were on pause, he could see his hands shaking of how he tried to move but other then that he was frozen, slowly but surely the gun crumble in his hand until there was nothing left and guard unfroze in an almost dazed state the guard started choking he grabbed at his throat trying to remove whatever was choking him with no success before tony could realize what was happening the guard was lifted off the floor lifting him 4 feet above while he choked the coughing and sputtering started to go softer Tony thought that was it the guard coughed himself to death but not close as the guards body went limp the body dropped to the floor his head exploded painting the walls red he would be too if the shield came up around him protecting him from all the grime and blood them he realized what had happened his duaghter had protected him again.
Tony goes into his second trimester and OMG the project (psst it's not so fab as I wanted it but it would do
Tony started walking beside Charles again his mind running a mile a minute “So we can't be sure”.
Break from the state tony was in he walked to the window pressing his warm forehead against the cool glass, trying to catch his breath.
“I came to check on my patient his blood pressure was low” Mason lied it wasn't the best lie but one they would likely believe “how am i supposed to know where your guards check their posts” it wasn't a lie she didnt know where they were only that they had left their post and they were here so it wasn't an exact lie just not the complete truth.
"Yeah, it's me its okay,” rubbing Tony's back trying to comfort his distressed friend.
“They were blue” Rhodey bluntly stated he didn't know how he would be able to explain it Tony's brown eyes had turned blue.
Shaking his head tony worried there was something wrong with his baby girl, it was too early for labor so it couldn't be that he still had 2 months too go “I don't know”.
“I am, come on we both need to sleep goodnight Rhodey,” Tony said he wanted to sleep but every time he does he sees mason somewhere alone crying for him it bothered him.
Placing the baby plate of smushed peas in the sink Tony let out a loud sigh “I know she likes her Baby food pep but it's not feeding her properly, her metabolism burns its way to fast for her then she gets hungry again” Tony said wiping away the smushed food all over the kitchen they had gotten used to the teleporting since they realized she only teleported to two places, the avengers compound, and Xaviers Mansion it had nearly given tony a heart attack when he found out she wasn't at the mansion but luckily Rhodey had called and told him she was at the compound.
“you wanted to discuss something Mr. Stark,” Charles asked he couldn't help but noticed stark's irritation and distraction he wished he could have read what was bothering stark but the mental shield was still there to stop him.
“Sarah Maria Stark, I know but it seems fair since we aren't going to tell him and don't try to change my mind” Tony stubbornly stated crossing his arms in defense.
“Maybe it's best if we finish this conversation another time,” Rhodey said gripping tony as he still sways some more before he steady again.
Turning steve laid tony on the bed kissing him passionately rubbing his hand up and down tony's leg enjoying the feeling of tony's soft skin while they grind against one another, but Tony wasn't having it he wasn't going to be on his back again with Steve on top of him, pushing at Steves shoulder tony rolled them letting him be on top as he continued to grind their cocks together.
“Mr stark will not be answering any questions there for no question will be asked or answered” pepper finished and gave way for him to take the podium.
The continuing part of chapter thirteen
It pissed Tony off that Ross would use children to get what he wants he really needed to get rid of ross legally “even if he wasn't  there and even if he was, we are going to put the lives of innocent at risk so if that is all I have things I need to do”picking up his stark pad he made his way to the door he needed to get out he felt an uneasy feeling he didn't like.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe she likes her baby food,” Pepper said chuckling she had only came to deliver paperwork and say hi to her goddaughter when she walked into Tony feeding Mason all kind of food Smushed Bananas, carrots, peas, pears, and more the kitchen was a mess from all the smushed food being thrown around, Rhodey had already been there enjoying Tony's struggle they had come to peas when Mason had started glitching teleporting so fast it basically looked like she glitched nobody knew where she went luckily she had calmed down enough so Tony could try and feed her the peas with ended up on the wall as she threw it at Tony it was quite hilarious.
But now he had someone who depends on him to make the right and responsible decision and not only for his health and safety but hers too, the uncertainness was driving him crazy he had absolutely no idea how to be a father he didnt exactly have the greatest of role models, he was grateful he wasn't doing this alone.
“Look,” the purple giant said letting the blades emerge“ pretty isn't it” playing with it in his hand before balancing it on his finger“ perfectly balanced as all things should be, too much on one side or the other” He tilted his finger slightly from one side to the other letting it fall before catching it “here” he handed the blade to Gamora “You try”.
Steve felt the air get slammed out of his lungs he launched upright and out of his seat with the feeling of lightheadedness making him sway.
{If i have to tell you, Erik, i may wonder about your reading skills, one wrong question, and he shuts close like a vault, we need to be cautious and respectful}charles answers giving Erik aside glans.
Looking at Rhodey after pepper left he asked“you think I'm crazy for doing this don't you”
“Who are you, you’re not mason,” Charles said watching a smile graced the child’s face sending a shudder down his spine the smile was friendly yet disturbing a smile that promised pain.
“Tony what are you doing here, I thought you already left, you can't be ...” Steve said but was interrupted.
Taking the advice tony chased mason around the couch before abruptly turning allowing mason to run into his arms, picking her up tony lifted her high up into the air making her burst into laughter the adorable laughs made tony heart sing with joy “ Come one sweet pea lets get you bathed and ready for bed your GodMamma wants to say goodbye before she leaves” tony said heading towards the bathroom.
And what wasn't Steve telling them?
“I can make it work papa look,” Mason said lifting her hand for him to see at first he was looking at her bare empty hand when a spark flickered into her palm before a glow of white energy started to form it was beyond beautiful a bright white light was bouncing in her palm while little flickers of sparks and lights were moving around the light and it was alive Tony felt it, Mason moved her hand towards the robotic puppy bot placing her palm against it, the glowing light seeped into the metal white vain like glow shone through the metal as tony watched it transform, the wires glowed and sank into the metal as it melted into a sleek liquid form shaping and reshaping claws sprouted from his paws metals plates shifting and sliding into place its floppy ears flapped around as it shook its head and barked honest to god barked its wired tongue lolling out dripping un unknown liquid as it drooled wagging its tail playfully making its butt move with it making mason giggle with joy “I’m going to call him Rex”.
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
“Tony, stop I already know what you’re thinking it’s not your fault if it’s anyone’s fault its mine” pepper said shaking his head tony turned towards pepper her eyes were red, cheeks wet with tears and her face were flushed she was a wreck and not even a single bone in his body that he could even muster felt that he was happy about her being miserable, he just couldn’t it wasn’t her fault it wasn’t even his fault it was hydra’s and most certainly Ross’s fault, God he wanted to punch something.
Charles rolled his chair to mason stopping next to her tony sat back and watched Charles talking with his daughter until Charles called him over moving towards the couch.
*Papa*.
Shocked and confused Strange straightened turning towards wong the shock clear on his face “Please tell me you saw that too”.
•••••••••••••••
Shaking his head tony slide slowly towards a room to the left betting with everything he had that, that was the nursery.
The doctor steps through the door “well Mr stark most of the test states your in healthy conditions but there is something strange that showed up in your blood and urine test”. He reported confident yet confused.
“Seriously Tone after everything they did, what he did to you, he hurt you any harder and it would have damaged your chest even worse than it already was, not to mention what if the base wasn't as empty as you thought it was if Zemo could get in it so easily who knows who could have been in there also even if there were no one the cold could have killed you if you didnt have any way out of there, if something worse had happened to you i..i.”
Time skip<3<3
“Tony” Rhodey called out running towards him skidding to a stop when he spotted the blood-covered walls and the two dead bodies walking over and around them, Rhodey grabbed his bed and started pushing“Come on tony time to go”.
Approaching the farm tony had wondered if Barton had already taken his family away but since civil war tony doubted it, the words Barton had said to tony still hurt him he shouldn't be surprised that Barton took him so low especially after Ultron
Doubling over with pain tony cradled his stomach Rhodey was there in an instant taking him by the shoulders“Tones what is it, What's wrong” Rhodey asks panic clear in his voice.
“I believe its a child” wong helpful inputted also staring at the child like he never saw one before.
“Oh my god James is Tony alright, are they alright” Pepper frantically asks her eyes were red and puffiness told Rhodey she was close to crying, the tear streaks on peters cheeks told him peter already did, he couldn't blame them he had been close to tears too when they had taken Tony into surgery if only they could get any news.
A sound alerted her of someone's arrival the relief filled her at the prospect of getting out of here but the relief fled as it was replaced with terror when she saw it wasn't Rhodes or any of tony other teammates but the guard that she had shot in the legs standing there( with was quite impressive due to the bullet in each leg) holding the gun she had discarded.
Frowning Rhodey went and stood next to Tony on the monitor was a frozen video of mason and the hired men that had taken her.
“I don’t know but we need to try for mason's sake,” Tony said as he pocketed the devices again.
Another chapter *Gasp*WHAT
“how could you let them get him you where suppose to stop them do you even know what you let get slipped out of your greasy idiotic hands you morons, the testing, the procedure and the DNA fusing and combining took to him to his blood fused with his DNA and for what now his gone because YOU could not do your fucking job” pointing his finger infrond of the head guards face spittle flying out his mouth as he yelled at them he needed new people those that listen and do their job without making excuses but that was hard to come by he needed to get stark back and fast the last test they did come back positive and that is what mostly failed with all the other patients he needed to do more tests but he couldn't and that was a problem he was not willing to accept “find stark and bring him back I don't care who you have to kill to do it just get it done” debroski orders watching as they left.
Looking up pepper smiled at Rhodey “ i just wanted to see how he was doing but Friday already told me he went to bed so i thought I'll stay till morning to see for myself”
Tapping his fingers against the conference table“ yes stark I did notice although for someone who has been kidnapped recently I would have thought you would take some time to yourself”
“No” Mason screamed jumping in front of Tony as the gun went off the searing pain rocked through her body as the bullet lodged itself into her chest nipping her heart sending her over the other side of the bed with the force of the blast, she could feel it, she was dying she didnt want to but if she had to do it over again she wouldn't change a thing a child deserves to have a chance at a normal life and not some toy Hydra could play with, turning her head Mason looked at where Tony was laying he was staring at her with horror, sadness, and anger she only had a matter of second she needed him to hear her for the last time.
“We may be able to help with that, one of my students here have the ability to manipulate memories also known as Mnemokinesis, he will be able to let you see and hear any memory you want to see, but only with your permission of course”Charles told him trying to reassure him he could say no.
They had left early in the morning Mason had been extremely excited about visiting the mansion and had been babbling ever since they left.
Tony's project will be soon revealed
Coming back to consciousness the constant dizzyness and fog that lingered in his head was starting to become more of a pain than before, he could tolerate it before and move on but now he was tired of it, everything was fuzzy as he was coming to realize he wasn't at the hydra base anymore, when it all came back to him the attack or so say rescue attempt the pain of labor and oh god Dr. Halliway her jumping in front of him taking the bullet meant to kill his baby.
“which you shouldn't be having, did you drink the pills the doc gave you, you know you should drink it or else you get sick tony how many times-” as soon as Rhodey started to rant on about him not drinking his pills(which he does, throwing up half of his stomach is not his cup of tea) Tony interrupted him.
Tongues battling for dominates all he could hear was their heavy breathing, the taste of tony, the feeling of his body pressed against tony's Steve couldn't get enough it was driving him insane
“The ball has been rolled I believe” T’challa asked.
Nodding his head tony took a deep breath and closed his eyes his complete focus was with his daughter for a few minutes there were silence and darkness he fell into focus tony heard his heartbeat and beyond his, he heard his daughter's heartbeat it was a strong beat but he was still in darkness he couldn’t even make heaheartbeathing and other then the heartbeat tony could find anything.
“You wanna try and catch her, let's see how well you do then,” Tony said as mason crawled under through the coffee table before he could reach her.
Laying his head on the sofa arm tony closed his eyes, he felt Bow put his hand on his head, a warm feeling rushed through his head it was a different feeling from Wanda's magic, it was warm as memories were pushed front and center::
≈≈∆≈≈
“is there anything we can do about this, is there still time to consider abortion...”
He had a meeting with Charles Xavier in a week then he had a charity ball the week after that and so on and on and on.
Looking around Sam spotted Natasha standing by the window not really admiring the view and by the way, she was working her lip and her crinkle in her brow told him she was concentrating on remembering something he just didnt know what.
“Yes Tony I know”.
“But what if we weren’t meant to deal with it what happens if it’s out of our hand,” Charles asked looking up at tony.
“As i shall be for you Sir” vision whispered even knowing Tony was out the room tony needed his help and he would be there for him.
“What is this about Ross,” tony asked sticking near the door just in case he needed to make a quick exit he didnt trust Ross, he would never trust Ross he was hiding something tony just knows it.
But Tony could tell the pills were not working anymore the nausea was coming back and the constant dizziness was also returning, “you okay tone” Rhodey asked as he leaned against the doorway, it wasn't the first time Rhodey had seen him like this and tony doubt it would be the last, he was grateful for the support but he hated to be seen like this to be seen as weak starks are made of iron, they don't get sick but then again men don't get pregnant either.
She was curled up on an armchair, not dressed in scrubs but in sweats and a sweater, her legs pulled to her chest, her chin resting on her knees. No shakles, no collar. She looked unharmed.
"What?", Wade asked and Peter couldn't tell if he was shocked by the question or genuinely didn't understand Peter.
"Are you trying to guilt-trip me?", he asked and Peter shrugged again, continuing his intense glare.
Wade could see it. Drugged up Peter still spoke, he moved around normally, he didn't avoid eye contact. Right now his movements were slow, lethargic. He still shifted around, he was packing clothes into a large suitcase Tony had brought over. But sometimes he'd just sit on his bed, clutching a random shirt in his hands, staring at nothing like he wasn't even there. It was painful to watch but Wade couldn't look away.
"Does it matter?", he finally asked, looking up at Wade.
"You think that this is easy?"
"What's this?", Peter asked, putting the rest of the package aside to inspect the cards.
' Peter proved him right in the worst way. Instead of getting on his feet the boy sank to his knees, crossing his wrists behind his back and lowering his head in submission.
"Peter, I've been dying to meet you.", an unfamiliar voice said and Peter turned around, facing a woman that was curled up in a big leather chair. She was beautiful, probably not much older than Peter, with olive skin, long raven hair and large black eyes. A cheeky grin pulled at her lips and she looked amused.
"Okay... first off, you can relax. Nobody will hurt you here. I'm just trying to help. I treated your wounds.", Bucky tried a different approach. The boy didn't look at the bandages but he reached for the one on his arm. His hand was shaky when his fingers brushed over the fabric.
"... they're here.", He finished. It still seemed unbelievable to Tony, how they could've gone through all that and still come out on the other side. Tony wasn't a believer in any way, shape or form. He liked facts. But Peter's survival bordered on a miracle.
"Need to piss.", Peter replied, his voice sounded foreign, empty,
Peter chewed on his lip before looking up at Wade. "The whole eggshell thing. You know?", He asked sheepishly and it slowly started to dawn on Wade what he ment. "I mean Tony and Steve always kinda did it but... not you. Not all the time, not like now." He didn't look at him any longer as he admitted to that, his eyes downcast, almost looking embarrassed.
Peter had lost time, how much, he couldn't tell. All he knew was that Natasha came in and then everything blurred and he lost control. Now he wasn't sitting in a chair anymore, he was on the ground. He looked up and Bucky's face was hovering above his. A second later Peter realized that Bucky was holding him down and after two seconds Peter knew why. The familiar sting on his arm, the damp feeling on the tips of his fingers, Peter didn't need to look at his wrist to know what he did. "I'm sorry...", he whispered but he wasn't quite himself. Not yet. Somewhere in his mind he was still with Keipon, he was holding him. The gentleness of the gesture didn't change the fact that it was torture.
They were standing in a pile of metal, completely shredded and torn apart by the crash. And there was blood. No body but blood that dried days ago. It led away from the crash and they followed it, because there was nothing else to do. They followed it until they lost the trail. "He survived the crash, that proves it!", Steve tried to lift their spirits.
stopped. He knew that this wasn't enough, that this wouldn't kill him, that he should continue. He sank to the floor. His hands were shaking.
"Touche....", Peter admitted before starting to unpack his things.
"I'm not.", Wade replied honestly, making a point to uphold a calm demeanour. No reason to get heated, one emotional wreck would be problem enough.
Obviously he knew what a date was, Wade had made him watch a bunch of rom-coms after all. But he just... didn't make the connection? Because he didn't even consider that he could ever have something like that with anyone, or that someone could want him in such a way.
"Yeah... waffles...", he mumbled, his voice raw from all the screaming. Still, he seemed close to going back into full on panic mode, gasping for air, his eyes wide and terrified. "Can- Can we go outside- Can I- I-please-", he then stuttered and Wade got up with a nod.
"Have fun, and if anything happens- ", Bucky started but Peter cut him right off.
Wade needed to get him to wake up and he also needed to get him off the ceiling. He hesitated for a second, touching Peter wasn't the best of ideas, especially when he was in this state. Wade remembered how Peter flinched away when he reached for him. But did he really have another choice?
Still, he kept up the mantra but after a while it felt almost like he was taunting himself. 'Still won't break'? Who was he kidding? He was a
"I'll have the waffle tower.", Peter announced, putting down the menu and looking to the waitress. Her tag said that her name was Grace.
"This is disgusting.", Peter mumbled, pulling a face.
"No, just us.", he replied. A little smirk pulled at the corners of Peter's lips and he glanced over at Wade.
{Erik his mind has a mental shield over it, you and i both know that it is impossible to shield ones mind i want to know if it is his abilities or something else} it was a reasonable answer.
This is the second last chapter to this part
Tony left Mason to play in her playpen tony went to make her formula, with masons powers growing tony needed to take her to meet Xavier and due to masons unusual conception, he and Mason have a mental, physical and emotional link, a connection which goes beyond any parental connection, Charles had explained to tony that normal mutants powers begin developing at puberty, but Mason had protected tony with her powers while she was in his womb and had further developed as she was born.
“I can't say I'm surprised at that, but changing the Accords and pardons if i may ask what had brought this on” T'challa asks he was quite curious of what the reason might be there had been a plan set in place to gain the Avengers their pardons but it would take years for not only him or the Avengers to gain so many favors and there were only so much he could do without giving away of his country and that was one thing he would never do and to hear stark wanted the Avengers pardoned was a relief but he knew they had parted with good add so why did stark want them pardoned.
Tony listens like he was told, like every single one of them told him to but it didnt matter because even that was wrong, sign the accord to keep control wrong, keep Wanda in the base for her own safety wrong, trying to bring in Barnes safely so he could get the professional help he needed Wrong, Steve was so close to signing the accord so close for tony to get a better grip on their shaky situation to amend and revise the accord to better suit them and not give the corrupted more power than they wanted he was close if only the brotherly love steve had for Wanda didnt peek its head out, internment, merely confining one to a comfortable location so her blood doesn't paint the streets red was far from internment and for her to use her powers to defend herself would have muddied the water more than it already was, he was losing his grip fast but he refused to let go, then the attack happened Barnes got triggered steve went after him, Wanda left the base along with barton leaving a broken vision behind after that the airport fight and a two faced Natash, to be honest, he wasnt even surprised not since the first time they met, steve and barnes got away Rhodey and sam giving chase only for Rhodey to... fall taking the beam ment for Sam bringing Tony close to a heart attack then he would have liked, the rest of team cap gets locked away in the raft which barton blames him for of course he couldnt blame him tony even blamed himself for some of it.
Tony cursed mentally he really need to control his emotions and not broadcast it to mason accidentally but he couldn’t close it off completely that would mean he couldn’t feel masons either and he wanted to make sure she was okay at school during the day so he kept it on with caution “Oh sweetheart don’t worry about that daddies are supposed to worry it our job”.
“No Ms. Barton but you and your kids need to come with me this place isn't safe anymore”
“Yes thank you, Charles and thanks again for helping, we should probably get going still have things to do if anything pops up about anything you need to know ill call you” Rhodey said as he took a hold of tony's shoulder.
“Okay your right we need some time out,” Tony said wiping off his hands ever since he had taken mason to the park she had loved it, she loved looking at all the pretty colors and pointing out the butterflies, laughing as daddy puts her on his shoulders because she didnt like wearing shoes it made his heart melt.
“Mr. Stark”
“its alright tony, we should have expected this to happen” Charles stated.
“What's wrong Little one?” The purple giant asks.
Rhodey knew tony was having a hard time lately with everything he been through along with the pregnancy and not to mention the things he still needed to do, pepper was trying to hold off Ross while tony recovers but he was stubborn if tony doesn't go see Ross or even call him Ross is going to take things into his own hands which was going to be a disaster he will show up here unanticipated at any time and that can't happen not with tonys present state they needed to come up with a plan to deal with everything and try not to put too much on tony's shoulders work together even if he's not going to like it.
And then it went to hell and Tony Regrets it.
“ you know me,restless can't keep still and beside i needed to check out this Josh Debroski, something has been bugging me about this him.” Tony answered turning towards the screen, trying to ignore the concern he saw on rhodey.
Okay if he was going to be straight with himself he didn't have a plan, well not much of a plan anyway since the talk yesterday Tony had been boggling his mind in how to do this but he conceded that a phone call would probably be better seeing as he was now 7 months pregnant the baby had decided to show as it should leaving him no choice to stay in bed and completely out of the public eye.
Starting from one corner tony went through a the tower, living room, kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, masons playroom, the lab, tony's workshop, even the gym, and med bay she was nowhere as Tony came back to the living room tony started to really panic when a shrill ring sound of his phone echoed through the room, grabbing the phone tony saw Charles name on display, why would Charles be calling him.
“And since your so concerned about the welfare of the Avengers, don't, I'm already working on a way to change the accord and get them pardoned and to be the first few to know i plan on retiring from both the Avengers and Ironman,” Tony responded.
“So the baby is fine,” Rhodey asked the pure relief that went through tony almost made him feel numb his baby was fine.
Maybe he was too afraid to ask.
With jeans arrival tony nerves had settled, Charles had a great idea he just didn't like having poked around in his head a lesson he learned well thanks to Maximoff.
EIGHT HOURS LATER
Opening the door Steve noticed a worried looking sam standing in front of his door “Hey everything okay I've been knocking for ten minutes straight” Sam said.
Heaving a sigh of relief “ Oh thank God ” the pure relief in peppers' voice was almost painful to hear if he didnt feel the same way.
Tony gave Steve a questioning look at which he could only shrug. They were both slightly thrown, not because this type of humor was foreign to them. In fact it was exactly this type of shit that made Steve laugh and Tony knew that. But they were both pleasantly surprised that Peter seemed to have a sense of humor at all. Not only that but that he seemed to be pretty much at ease during his interactions with Wade.
"Peter-", Wade pleaded but Peter wouldn't let him whine.
The dread was still there. He'd be on his own. The idea of relying on Wade disgusted Peter so much that he didn't even consider it. Wade had done enough for him already. Even if he offered to let Peter stay with him, he couldn't imagine that Wade was serious about that.
"Okay.", Peter forced himself to say, his voice was foreign, an empty echo. He sounded dead but there wasn't enough left of Peter to be upset about that.
"Stop...", he pleaded and the tears were back, broken faucets.
"Because you deserve to be comfortable. And if anything bothers you, whatever it is, you should tell us. We'll take care of it.", Tony explained, desperately trying to keep the quiver out of his voice.
It was a good movie, it really was, but Peter's mind was a little preoccupied with MJ who seemed to edge closer and closer. At some point she leaned her head against his shoulder.
They'd stay in DC for the week. Steve still had an apartment there that he hadn't used in years. It wasn't really big enough for the four of them but none of them complained. They left their things there before heading for the SHIELD headquarters.
"Peter what the fuck!", she yelled which made him flinch which in turn pissed Bucky off.
Wade backed off. He didn't start the topic again.  He really didn't want to upset Peter more. Apparently Peter didn't really want to drop it, though. He let out a sigh and turned around, meeting Wade's eyes for the first time in hours. His face was expressionless. "You couldn't have done anything. ", he said with a shrug and Wade wished that he could believe it.
Steve was by himself with Peter for about an hour. The rest of them had promised to stay away as long as Steve had everything under control. Then they heard something hard crash against the wall and that was enough to alert all of them. When they entered the bedroom Wade was shocked at how much Peter's condition had deteriorated in the last hour. He had been irritated before but still controlled. That control was all but gone now. "Oh look who decided to join the party!", Peter yelled manically before grabbing an arm chair and throwing it towards the door. They all managed to dive out of it's way in time before it crashed against the floor. Wade looked over to his right and found the desk chair crumpled against the wall. So that's where the sound came from.
"Are you enjoying it?", Wade asked. He wasn't sure how far Peter's apathy went, if he could even enjoy anything right now.
AHHHHHHH
"Because I feel like you get it. I feel less of a pressure to be
"I skimmed over it, didn't read details, though. Your identity was far more interesting at the time.",Wade replied truthfully.
So, yeah, Peter's journey will continue and it will be difficult and harsh. But it will also be bright and hopeful.
"One? Gwen or Peter?", Steve asked from the pilot seat.
"What did you?!", Gwen snapped at him before grabbing at his hand and pulling it away. She was furious, another trait she wasn't supposed to have.
Peter hissed but quickly schooled his expression back to neutrality as Wade dabbed a damp piece of cloth against his wounds. They were already closing up so the bandages Wade wrapped around them after cleaning them were really unnecessary.
"Yeah.", he nodded slowly and Steve let out a low sigh.
"Psychological torment? Lovely wordchoice. So encouraging.", Wade remarked, trying to go for his usual dark humor. It fell flat.
"I think we should leave these two to themselves. ", Tony mumbled and Peter vaguely registered that Natasha and Tony left for the kitchen.
She had shot him. Gwen had fucking shot him. Peter quickly catalogued the severity of his injuries. One shot in his right thigh, one in his left shoulder, and one in his abdomen, none had hit any vital organs as far as he could tell but the one in his leg seemed to have hit his bone. These might not kill him but there was no way in hell that he'd be able to overpower Gwen now. Not unarmed and on his own and she knew that.
Surprise! He didn't. "I mean, as often as you want. I'd prefer for you to not leave by yourself but as long as someone accompanies you, you're free to go.", Tony replied simply and Peter froze on the spot.
"Fuck, what did she do to you...", Wade whispered horrified, taking Peter's head into his lap. He was trying to catalogue the damage but it was just too much blood, too much...
if Wade just got him the drugs. He was painfully reminded of Vanessa's colleague once more. "-
"Gwen...", Peter smiled up at her. She was wonderful, even covered in his blood she was the girl that Peter would always love.
"Because you love him.", she replied and sounded absolutely not like herself. Death sounded heartbroken. Wade hadn't even known that she had a heart.
Peter couldn't help it, he stared at Gwen. It was heartbreaking, what they had done to his friend. The person that used to keep him present, used to keep him human, and he couldn't do it for her.
"It was the right thing to do. But I'm glad to be back. If we stayed away longer, Bucky would've probably dragged me to every single national park in his pursuit to show me how beautiful the world is. ", Peter continued to tell him before stopping and looking down at the floor for a second, sharing a quiet chuckled with himself before saying this: "Like... no... don't kill yourself... the world's too sexy...haha."
"What? Why?"
"So this is about Gwen?", Wade asked, trying to not sound bothered.
"Patience, kid. I'm getting there. Well, he didn't take it well at first. Understandable, if you ask me. He just found out his parents got murdered and now the murderer is right in front of him. Still, your dad only needed time. I couldn't believe it either but... he forgave me. I think he never really blamed me in the first place. You seeing where I'm going with this?", Bucky asked but Peter didn't reply, only raising his eyebrows. "If he can forgive a random stranger that killed his parents, he definitely won't hold a grudge against you. Hard to argue with that logic, isn't it?"
The words played in a loop in his mind over and over again until they were the only thing, until nothing else was left, not even Keipon. They pulled Peter under, lulled him to sleep until he finally faded away.
Anyways, a few words to finish this off. First of all, I know I sort of spoiled that before in the comments but I always write happy ending. By that I don't mean that by the end everything is perfect and well. There are still problems, unresolved issues, unanswered questions. Typical happy endings are boring to me, they are not real, but hopeful ending... I love those. It's sort of my philosophy in writing. That you can put a character through whatever hardships you want as long as they get to make it out. As long as they get to have hope. We could all use a little more hope from time to time, I think, especially now.
"So... Will you take me?", Peter asked, after another beat of silence.
"It really is, though. Apparently it causes cancer. ", Bucky argued, pulling a face before frowning down at the cigarette between his finger. For a moment Peter thought he'd put it out but instead he just took another drag.
"I hope so.", Tony nodded, his voice a little cracky but still strong. Peter nodded and turned away, approaching the door. He had already wrapped his hand around the door handle when Tony called out his name once more. "Peter-" He turned around to face his father, waiting for Tony to gain enough courage to say what was on his mind. "I know you might not want to hear it, but I love you, and I'm very proud of you."
Wade carefully placed his hands on Peter's shoulders, trying to look him in the eyes but failing. "Peter- no one will punish you. No one will hurt you, I promise.", Wade whispered.
"But you do.", Bucky finished. "It's okay. You have every right to be mad at us." They all knew that it was a very real possibility that Peter would resent them after what happened. It hurt, but Bucky wouldn't tell Peter that he was wrong for feeling this way.
"Hey, Peter! Stay with me.", he pleaded and Peter looked up at him again.
"A bit, I was mostly just watching Wade which made you pretty unavoidable. Sort of sucks to watch the love of you life fall for someone else. ", she shrugged but she didn't seem malicious or bitter, just a bit sad.
"What?"
Gwen didn't reply, didn't pull a face or really react. Instead she just glanced at Peter, apparently waiting for him to answer.
Peter had tried to be better on his own. Wade, Bucky, Tony, Steve. They all thought that they could make him better. Before them it had been Gwen. She was too good. Peter wasn't. None of them could change him. Nobody could free him of this ugly venomous part of him, overriding all that he was. Or...Maybe there was nothing else. Maybe he was just this monster. He used to be good...no...not good...innocent. Good and innocent weren't the same. Peter wasn't sure if he had ever been good. But HYDRA took his innocence, they placed this darkness in him that chewed away more of his heart every year.
.' Contextually it really made more sense because the gun wasn't pointing at Peter, Gwen was pointing it at her own head, which worried Peter much more.
After he had gained some weight and strength Tony agreed that going to the gym might help him get healthier. The great thing that came with having Steve as a step dad, was that the training equipment was designed for someone with super strength, someone like Peter. It helped, it was exhausting but the physical strain pulled him out of his mind and into his body.
"It's in his possession but we didn't read it to respect his privacy.", Steve replied. There it was. Natasha assumed that they would say this.
"You're so beautiful.", Peter said with a breathless laugh, his eyes fluttered shut for a moment and only opened once Wade gave him a careful shake.
"What face?", she asked, still making that face. Oh, how Peter hated it.
Wade knew that his anger was misplaced. That he had no right to snap at Tony, but he never excelled at self control. Steve and Bucky were shocked at this outbreak but Tony only stared at him with tired eyes. "Pull yourself together, Wilson.", he stated simply before letting his gaze drift to the outside of the car again. Wade was left to fume in silence. Nobody else tried to strike up conversation again.
Wade couldn't believe that this was really happening, he was scared that if he made a wrong move it would all shatter to pieces so they stayed like that, just looking at each other, Wade rubbing gentle circles over Peter's cheeks with his thumbs.
Peter watched Wade for a while, blinking slowly, taking his time with his reply. "Was it like that, for you and Vanessa?", he eventually asked.
"You don't really believe that, do you?! The last few weeks have been baby step after baby step followed by huge setbacks. What you're doing right now is eradicating every tiny bit of trust and safety we managed to establish. You're catapulting us back to square one. Maybe even worse." Steve hadn't said a lot until now. Only sitting next to Tony in silent support. Now the dam broke and Steve Rogers was fucking furious.
"Don't give it to him.", Peter suddenly said, taking a step forward before the gun was pointing back at him again. He was trying to calculate how many shots he could take before he broke down, it entirely depended on placement. If he was lucky he could take 3 or 4 but a headshot would take him out for good.
"Is it always going to be like this now?", Peter suddenly asked and at first Wade genuinely didn't get what he ment.
It suddenly struck him how beautiful Peter was. And not just because he finally started to look alive, slowly gaining weight and muscle, looking less and less sickly and neglected. Physical beauty had long lost meaning to Wade, Vanessa had taught him that it didn't matter, not really. No, his beauty didn't stem from his appearance.
"Fuck this!", Wade exclaimed, hauling himself to his feet. "Let's go kill someone, I'm getting stir-crazy up in here!" But before he could even get to his suit his phone started to ring.
Quick warning, Peter's suicide attempt is mentioned but not in any detail.
"Tall, pretty, into memes and willing to put up with an emotional wreck.", Peter replied simply before staring intently at Wade.
"I love you Gwen- remember that I love you-", he said, his voice trembling with the strain of living. His vision blurred but he still saw the moment, the moment she switched. Her eyes grew wide and the weapon slipped from her hand, clattering to the floor beside them.
He couldn't.
"You have no right to keep her here. ", a voice suddenly said and it took Wade a second to realize that Tony had spoken. There was something to his tone he hadn't heard in a long time. Confidence, cockyness, like he knew exactly what he was doing.
They moved farther and farther into the inside the facility, taking on more and more HYDRA agents. Somewhere along the way Bucky's metal arm got damaged, it was not moving properly anymore. Wade was riddled with bullet holes, Steve had a couple of his own but moved like he didn't. They stepped into a larger room, seemingly the source of all the guards they had been fighting this far.
Peter sat up, it took him all his energy to do so but he managed. It was still dark and Peter needed a second to see Wade sitting next to the door still. Looking at him hurt so Peter didn't. He got to his feet, his body was numb. He moved automatically, step by step towards the bathroom. "Peter? Is everything okay?", Wade asked. He didn't look at him.
"I have to get some things ready before we leave. You should pack in the meantime as well.", Bucky continued to explain.
"What if he doesn't have time?", Bucky asked and he didn't want to hear an answer, not really. Bucky knew what awaited Peter at SHIELD because he went through it. They found a way to reprogram him. They used their own version of the halo to alter the memories placed by HYDRA in order to make the trigger words effective. That's all they really did, stop Bucky from turning into a mindless machine because of a few words. Bucky was left to combat the remaining traumatic memories and natural conditioning by himself.  It didn't really help in his day to day life, it only ensured that he wasn't a loaded gun anymore. Back then he was all for it. And sure, it was awful. The whole process reminded him so much of HYDRA that he tried to break free several times. To have someone deconstruct your mind, even if it's for your own benefit, wasn't fun. It were probably the worst weeks of his new conscious life. Still, he would probably agree to it again. But that was him and he made the conscious decision to hand himself over to SHIELD back then. Peter didn't get to decide for himself. SHIELD just kicked in the door, tipped off by Natasha, and ripped him from his family. He could still see the absolute panic in Peter's eyes, the desperation, could still hear him scream.
"I don't make mistakes and if I remember correctly I did warn you that this would happen. "
"Yeah, I saw your business. He's cute.", Death smirked and Wade raised an eyebrow.
Bucky wouldn't pretend that Wade was wrong, his first thought was to storm SHIELD, too. But Bucky couldn't afford to be so impulsive anymore. "You think that you can just take him? It's a death-mission.", Steve argued and Wade rolled with his eyes.
"It's important.", Bucky insisted. Peter was about to refuse again but Bucky wouldn't take his bullshit. "It's about Gwen!", he stated and Peter froze, but only for a split second, then he was up on his feet, taking the phone from Bucky.
