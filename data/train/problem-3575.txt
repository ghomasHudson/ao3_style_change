Dean is kissing him with such intention, it
“You okay? Still cold?” Dean whispers to him.
“Awesome. Incredible, really. The geology out there is fascinating. Did you know that mountain ranges can become extinct?” Sam answers enthusiastically.
plays through his earbuds, he begins to sketch absentmindedly. Before he knows it, a familiar pair of eyes is gazing up at him: Dean's eyes.
"Thank you, Sam, that's very kind," Castiel says quietly, "I'd like to apologize for calling you an 'abomination' that one time." Dean snorts out a laugh as Sam clears his throat, eyebrows raised in surprise.
“Yeah,” he answers, his throat suddenly bone-dry.
“Yeah. Got a few recommendations from a friend.”
“God, Cas! What the hell?” As dread takes a firmer hold, Dean’s fingertips and toes feel oddly numb. “This seems physical to me.”
“Dean!” Sam cries as if they haven’t seen each other in ages. Dean stands quickly to greet him. Sam immediately wraps his arms around Dean’s waist. Missouri smiles at them, gently shutting the door and leaving them to themselves. Dean knows they aren’t
“Hmm?”
Dean what he wants. But Cas is afraid of what the answer might be, so he lays silently for a long time before finally falling asleep in Dean’s arms.
"Thanks."
tonight, remember?” Dean says, laughing softly. Cas relaxes a little, smiling at him.
In the shower, Dean squeezes his eyes shut, fighting the urge to slam his fist into the tiled wall. He turns the hot water up hot as it can go, til it’s nearly scalding.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas breathes heavily, “Dean, fuck me, please, Dean.” Dean grins at him, nipping at the inside of Castiel’s thigh.
“Why? What does he do?” Dean asks.
“Do you think he’s hiding something?” Dean asks, trying his best to sound casual.
“Let’s get you cleaned up then.” Dean pushes himself up and hops out of bed with ease, circling around to the other side. He can’t help but notice that Cas doesn’t move as easily. Dean offers him a hand and helps pull him to a seated position on the edge of the bed. Cas winces and takes a moment to catch his breath.
while now, and now he’s going fucking exploring with his hands, his tongue, everything. He licks a long, hot stripe up the underside of Dean’s cock before sucking the head into his mouth, investigating the tip with his tongue, and then nearly swallowing the whole damn thing.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel says quietly, and Dean knows he isn’t talking about opening doors for him. He stares at Cas for a moment, wondering why he, Dean, means so much to this… being? Entity? To whatever Cas really
“I understand,” Castiel says quietly.
blares from the Impala’s speakers as Dean guns it, tearing down the long-ass driveway, away from the Novak home. To Castiel’s delight, he can see in the rear-view mirror that Dean’s spinning tires have showered his mother, uncle, and sister all with mud and clumps of grass, and he can’t stop laughing. In fact, he laughs until he is crying.
“Will you tell me if you’re not comfortable with anything?” Dean questions, “if I’m goin’ too fast?” His verdant eyes search Cas for an answer.
“You’re so good, though,” Dean counters, leaving Castiel’s question unanswered, “I’m sure you could get scholarships or whatever.”
“Know what?” asks Dean.
“Thanks to you,” Dean says seriously, and Sam lunges forward, crawling across the couch to wrap his arms around him once more. Sam isn’t usually so clingy, but Dean understands why that has changed, and likewise, he takes comfort in his brother’s embrace, knowing there is one person in the world who cares about him so deeply.
“I’m okay; I’ll still be here when you’re done,” Dean assures him. Sam huffs and crawls off the bed, trailing the social worker out of the room.
“Cas?” The angel’s eyes roll and converge on Dean’s face. Dean grabs a towel from the bathroom. “I hope this is clean,” he mutters to himself. “Okay, Cas, this will probably sting like hell,” Dean speaks roughly, pulling a bottle of rubbing alcohol out of his bag.
Dean dresses and is out the door with Sam faster than ever which, given their “pack up and go” lifestyle, really is saying something. He curses the fucking Portland traffic and the awful goddamn parking at the hospital, but before long at all they are being buzzed in to the ICU.
“Can’t believe you came on my cock alone,” Dean says quietly with a grin.
Even if Gabe turns out to be a dead end, Cas tried. Cas, a kid he's only known for a few days, actually thought about him and his problems with the intent to help him.
"I've been seein' them since I was a kid. When I finally broke down and told my old man, he smacked the shit out of me- told me I was either a liar or crazy. Never told anyone again." Dean glances sideways at Cas after this admission.
"Sarcasm! I like it," Dean says smiling, squeezing Cas's shoulder and eliciting a ghost of a smile from him. "Anyway, you look good, Cas. How you feeling?"
“Whatever you say,” Dean says disbelievingly as he pulls into the driveway, “welcome to
"Unless you count Meg, you're pretty much the only friend I've got too," Castiel adds. "I'm really glad I met you," Cas nearly whispers.
“Oh,” Dean says, “Cas, I’m glad you found a friend, but I don’t want you to hesitate to call me, whatever I’m doing. You’re so important to me; I’d drop anything to be there when you need me.”
“Uh, I don’t know what you mean.”
“Ugh, it burns,” he exclaims as Dean lays back on the other bed.
“Is he your age?”
"I don't remember anymore," Cas says after a moment of thought. "I know I witnessed its creation, but I don't remember that any more." Dean stares at him, his brow furrowed. "It seems every minute I am human erases a memory I had from before," he continues solemnly.
“It feels good; human happiness,” Castiel replies thoughtfully. “I never truly understood it before.”
Cas shudders with enjoyment at each soft touch. Dean pulls him up gently to slide the shirt off his arms and pull the tee shirt over his head. When they lay back it feels almost like electricity crackling between their bare chests. Maybe it’s Castiel’s lingering grace, or simple Dean’s imagination, but it’s powerful, incredible.
The spot he'd scratched raw the night before looks like shit. He'll try to wash it well with soap in the bathroom, but he's worried; it looks like maybe it's going to get infected, and that's going to raise a whole bunch of questions. For now though, he makes sure his bandages are covering it before he wanders out into the hallway, hoping to find Missouri. To his immense relief, she is seated at the nurses' station. He puts on the brightest, most winning face he can manage and saunters over to the counter.
And Pam was throwing holy water on him as she chanted all this Latin at him, and he was like screaming and writhing as Benny held onto him, and when she got to the last part, there was this loud
“Can I see? Will you show me?” Dean asks quietly, “please?”
“Dad, stop!” They hear suddenly, and John loosens his grip, startled. Dean cranes his neck to look back and sees Sam standing there, tears in his eyes and white as a sheet. “Dean…” Sam begins, taking a step toward him. John stands abruptly, allowing Dean to scramble backward and painfully to his feet.
“And what ‘stuff’ have you been questioning?” Billie asks.
“I’ve never heard of that happening,” he answers after a moment.
“Shut up, Pam,” Dean scolds, shaking his head. “At least we don’t got that to worry about, huh, Cas?” Cas actually huffs a little laugh, grinning briefly at Dean. Sam just looks thoroughly embarrassed by the whole line of conversation, wincing as he watches Pam continue, pausing every once in a while to wipe blood and ink from Castiel’s chest.
“Yeah, alright, whatever you want, Dean,” Cas smiles.
“Guess you’re not as dumb as your pretty face suggests,” Meg smirks.
” Pam snorts, “since when does Dean Winchester dig guys?”
As they hit a bump in the road, Dean notices Cas wince.
“Sammy!?” Dean asks urgently, pressing the receiver to his ear.
“So many things. This thing in my nose, and the one in my arm, and the needlework on my abdomen…”
"You mean, was he normal before all this?" Sam interjects.
"I know it's probably hard to believe," Dean tries to joke, "but I don't got a whole lot of friends... and... I like you; it's nice having someone to talk to, you know?" Castiel feels as though his heart could burst from his chest at any minute, but he fights valiantly to play it cool.
“Yeah, of course, anything,” Dean replies.
"Odd how?" Sara asks. Again, Dean suppresses a smile.
When Dean finally musters the courage to look back up at Cas, his eyes are red and his cheeks damp. Cas narrows his eyes in confusion, reaching up to touch the side of Dean's face.
returned. Unrequited love fucking sucks.
“This is different,” Dean finally spits out, defensively, “Cas is clean; he was a fuckin’
"Gonna miss you too," Dean replies softly. After a while, Dean speaks up again. "For the record, I don't care what Meg or Becky or anyone else is saying about us, Cas."
“Thanks.” Cas is clearly uncomfortable, despite Dean’s attempts at lightening the mood.
make the butterflies in Castiel’s stomach go freakin’ insane.
When the brothers return to the ICU, Castiel is just being returned to his room.
“Mhmm?”
“Do you think I’m sick?” Cas asks weakly as he begins to catch his breath.
“So this is probably gonna sound real crazy, but I gotta ask: did you kidnap someone?”
” Dean replies.
“Is it alright if I just lay back here?” Castiel asks sadly.
“Uh, I’m Dean,” Dean says finally.
“Uhhm,” Cas stalls, desperately wanting to give Dean the “correct” answer. The truth is, Cas wants it; he wants to feel Dean all over him, wants to feel Dean inside him, but he is afraid maybe Dean doesn’t want to do that.  Maybe Dean isn’t ready to do that with a man.  Maybe Dean will
Driving toward Mt. Hood from Hood River
“Where in hell’s name are you? I been asking everywhere ‘bout you boys!”
As Missouri opens the door, Meg practically falls inside the room from the position in which she had been eavesdropping.
Dean gasps. “Uh, do we have to talk about that right now?”
Something is wrong. Dean sits up in bed. He is still in Sam’s bed, but Sam isn’t. His heart begins to race, and his breath will only come to him in quick, stuttering gasps. Vaulting out of bed, Dean rushes to wake Cas. Cas is gone too.
help him out with Sammy? The thought makes his heart speed up a little. It sounds too good to be true. I mean, good things just don't really happen in his experience. But then again,
“Plain black coffee, no sugar, no cream, no hipster bullshit.”
"Hey!" Dean interjects in indignation.
“Why?”
“You did a great job helping your brother,” she speaks softly, “you did everything just right.” And Sam disintegrates, collapsing into her arms.
“Well, I tried,” Sam says to himself.
“Better than the women who have done this with you?” Castiel asks quietly when he takes a break for air. Dean opens his eyes slightly to glance at Cas’s expression then, sitting up a little, resting on his elbows.
” Cas stares at his hands.  A tear rolls down his cheek as he gently closes his eyes. Without saying a word, Dean stands from the couch, kneeling then on the floor in front of Castiel.
“Yes, thank you, María,” he replies before asking, “where did you get these?”
Dean exhales against Cas’s neck, “gonna make you feel so much.” Dean watches as Cas’s breath comes hard and fast, spread out beneath him, his hard cock twitching in anticipation as Dean carefully withdraws his fingers and slicks up his own cock.
“Oh,” Cas still sounds interested, if a tad disenchanted, “well, what do they do?”
“Mhmm, that feels great,” Cas sighs.
“You were fuckin’ thirteen?” Dean shouts in earnest.
“Uh, hi, um, could I please speak with Missouri Moseley?”
“Maybe next time,” the guy said as he turned and walked off. Dean collapsed in on himself. He felt icy cold although it was nearly 80 degrees even at night. He tried, but couldn’t help vomiting on the ground in front of himself. Eventually, he wiped his mouth, dried his eyes, straightened his clothing, and walked around the building back to the Impala.
“Stoned sex is pretty great,” Charlie says matter-of-factly, “in my experience, at least. I would definitely recommend you try it. Anyway, I should probably get going before the girlfriend begins to worry.” Cas straightens up, and the two exchange a warm embrace. “You take care, Cas,” she says, “and you have my number; call whenever!”
“It’s fine,” Sam answers nonchalantly. “How are you?”
"You seem to care a great deal about protecting the people close to you, and I'd like you to try and focus some of that energy on caring for yourself," Missouri says gently as she finishes wrapping his arm in gauze, securing it with plenty of tape.
" The last words are barely a whisper. "I'm probably being selfish again, but Cas, I
, and get the fuck out. I ain’t keeping a couple queers under my roof, and I don’t want any of this homo shit around Sammy.”
“You like that, angel? That feel good?” Dean asks in a low rumble.
“No,” Dean answers, “I actually don’t.” He smiles to himself.
Dean and Castiel are discussing their next steps when Dean turns the key in the ignition, and the radio comes on in the middle of an important announcement. The pair freezes.
“No, no, Dean, it’s nothing like that!” Cas rushes to assure him, “that was... it was perfect.” Dean grins with relief, kissing Cas again slowly, letting Cas taste himself on Dean’s tongue.
“What is it then?” Cas inquires softly.
"I couldn't be anything other than patient with you; you are everything to me." Castiel's voice is so even, so self-assured, delivering profound sentiment as if simply stating the time of day, and Dean is gutted by it.
“Doin’ alright. Got him some meds to help him sleep.”
“It also looks like Sam’s heading back into town tomorrow,” Dean adds, after checking his text messages. Suddenly his mouth feels dry, and his palms feel moist. Cas looks at him expectantly.
“I apologize, Dean,” Cas had said, still gazing at Dean, not truly knowing what he was apologizing for.
“Okay, yeah, that sounds good,” Cas says nervously.
“Oh, I understand.” Cas stares at the bowl of fruit in front of him, pushing pieces of melon around with his fork. “Human relationships are so
“Good morning, Dean,” Billie says pleasantly as he sits on the couch opposite her.
"You're in a hospital in Portland, Oregon. Been here for a number of days. We were hoping you'd be able to explain all this to us." Dean says, trying not to sound too disappointed.
“Guess I’m not the only one with a fucked up family.” Billie smiles, and is about to say something when there is a quiet knock on the door.
“Yes. That would be nice.” Only then does Dean extricate himself from the bedding, and from Castiel. He throws on his jacket and walks to the door with a promise he’ll be back soon. Cas sits up then, thankful that the room has finally quit spinning, and his head no longer feels like a lead weight. For once he feels like he actually slept well. As he swings his legs over the edge of the bed, he is suddenly aware that aside from feeling clear headed and well rested, his dick is super hard.
“Yeah. Don’t worry about it too much, Cas. Humanity probably won’t ever make total sense,” Dean says, smiling over at Cas. Cas returns the smile before turning to look back out the window at the lush greenery they’re passing by.
“Why?” Castiel’s gaze is intense.
With another hug each, she says goodbye, wishing them luck, and they return to the Impala.
“So, you gonna shoot me, Dean?” John asks finally, mockingly.
“Cas, I don’t understand what’s going on,” Dean says softly, “but I wanna help. Is there anything I can do? Are you sick? Has this happened before?”
“Let’s all introduce ourselves to the newbie,” Garth announces, “say your name and how about your favorite music group or movie, you decide.” This is really gonna suck, Castiel decides as a perky blonde girl enthusiastically volunteers to begin.
“Okay,” she says, not sounding convinced, “better go get something to eat.” Castiel nods, grabbing his iPod and sketchbook before heading to breakfast.
Cas gasps, feeling as though the wind has been knocked out of him.
“Yeah, that’s it, angel,” Dean murmurs, soft and low as he holds Cas steady against himself, stroking him a couple more times, feeling Cas shiver against him with each touch. “You like that, Cas?” Cas nods silently.
“Alright, you have my word. At least let me help you get cleaned up.” Cas slowly nods his agreement, and María rushes to gather some first aid supplies. When she returns, she finds Castiel still on the floor.
"Nothing, just wanted to see if Cas was in," Meg answers innocently.
"What? I'm just trying to sympathize," she replies. "Now, spill! What were you doing with the hottie next door?"
“What if they make me stay?” Cas asks quietly, anxiety clearly painted across his face.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m going,” Dean groans, untangling himself from Cas and struggling to his feet. He reaches a hand down to Cas who is still sitting, a little stunned, on the grass. As Cas stands, he falls forward into Dean with a soft cry. “Dude, Cas, you okay?”
-The Beatles
“Night, Cas,” Dean says as Castiel hops up.
"I dunno," he sniffs, "I just... I get so lonely, and he... he treats me like I'm a normal person. Every other guy I know either ignores me completely or treats me like shit; talking to him is nice for a change."
“Just… what’s the point of my being here?” Dean shakes his head as he listens to this. He doesn’t like the hole Cas is going down here at all. “I’m no use to anyone like this.”
“Well, you may ask me anything you would like,” Cas says calmly. “I will answer to the best of my ability.”
“I just wanted to be an accepted part of the family so bad, I would’ve tried anything to change, but it slowly became painfully obvious that I was never going to be able to change myself and that my family would never accept me. It hurt so bad having my own mother look at me like I was something abhorrent, and I was so afraid of being alone.”
“Yeah, come for me, baby,” Dean encourages breathlessly, grinding his own aching cock against Castiel’s thigh. Dean can feel Cas’s grip on him becoming progressively tighter until, at last, his body jerks a final time as he gasps out Dean’s name, spilling into Dean’s hand. “That’s it, baby,” Dean moans, working Cas through his orgasm. When Cas goes limp, loosening his grip on Dean’s shoulders, Dean gently lays on top of him, running his fingers through Cas’s wild sex hair.
“Don’t you roll those baby blues at me, young man!” Missouri teases. “Just use your common sense, Castiel.”
angel is, circling the drain. Dean can't take it. He wanders down a hallway With huge windows all along one side. It's dark outside and from where the hospital sits, up on a hill, he can see the city lights spread out before him. He rests his forehead against the cool glass and takes a deep breath. The lights of Portland's many bridges reflect on the surface of the river, and Dean has to admit there's a certain beauty to it.
"Dude, you're licking an empty Jell-O cup when there's a spoon
Dean wakes abruptly, shivering. It’s somewhere around 2 in the morning, and he’s drenched in cold sweat. Scenes flash through his head, scenes he hasn’t thought on in ages, so many ages he thought he’d managed to suppress them for good. Apparently not.
“No,” Dean replies, “and I swear I’m not just saying that so you’ll let me go. I truly regret doing what I did, and I promised Sammy I’d never do it again, and I intend to keep that promise… and I have the friend I was talking about. I’ve made him some promises too. For the first time in a long time, I actually feel some hope, you know?”
Cas asks disbelievingly. He doesn’t think Dean is lying, but he just can’t believe he’s telling the truth either.
"I'll miss him too." Missouri admits softly. "You, try not to worry yourself about Cas though. You focus on you, Dean. Let me worry about Cas."
“Because, Cas, sleeping together is kind of a special thing to humans.”
“No,” Dean lies, fighting to regain control over his breathing, “no, angel, go back to sleep.” He leans over, kissing the side of Castiel’s head, all the while feeling cold sweat trickling down the back of his neck.
“It’s like the goddamn strip club all over again!”
“What the actual
“I don’t know, Dean. I didn’t do anything consciously. I told you, if there’s some remnant of grace in me, it’s power isn’t available to me.”
"Nice to meet you both." She has two more chairs brought in and sits facing Sam and Dean. "I'm sure you are both anxious to know how your brother is doing."
“That’s fuckin’ awful,” Dean murmurs.
“Mmhmm,” Cas replies. Finally, Dean helps pull Cas’s tee shirt off over his head, followed by his own. Dean runs his hand over Castiel’s chest. He’s still on the thin side, but he’s looking a lot healthier. He ghosts his fingers over the scars running the length of Cas’s abdomen; they’re still brutally visible, but they’ve healed well.
“That’s a damn shame… you wanna put your purdy mouth to use instead?” Dean says nothing, only swallows the bile at the back of his throat, grits his teeth, and proceeds out the back door into the night with the guy, against all his better judgement.
As Castiel begins to toss and turn more violently, Dean isn’t sure whether he should let him continue to sleep or gently shake him awake. Eventually, Dean can’t handle it anymore and decides to wake him, sitting carefully at his side. He places his hand softly on Cas’s shoulder.
“I’m single. Haven’t really dated since dropping outta school. Don’t really meet many people working at the scrap yard. Couple of hook-ups, sure, but nothing where I ever saw the chick again. You?” And with that, Castiel’s hopes were first raised and then dashed, like a boat tossed upon the rocks by a wave. “Cas?” Dean repeats when Castiel fails to answer the question.
“I’m sorry if it seems like I’m pressuring you,” Dean says after a while. “It’s just really important. Cas, the shit I saw last night... the demon used you to kill Sam. And then he killed you too.” Tears are in Dean’s eyes as he struggles to relay his dream. “He made you stab yourself, and you bled out as I held you.” Cas shivers in his arms. “I won’t let that happen.” Dean sits up slowly, groping for Castiel’s pill bottles. Cas accepts another Ativan and a pain pill gratefully, swallowing them with a gulp of water.
“Hmm.” Ultimately, Cas goes with a hard pear cider, and Dean just chooses the one with the highest ABV, which, oddly enough, turns out to be the same pear cider.
“He doesn’t need to know about
He whimpers, crying out when it feels like it’s almost too much, oblivious to the noise he’s making. He grips more tightly, feeling a little dizzy, wanting more, his body asking for more.
So update: I’ve been watching season 9, and i’m Like what?! So um I started writing this before I knew Cas turns human in the show for a while or whatever...Uh so yeah, this fic is totally canon divergent, and follows no real timeline. Lol.
“That
“Woah, they’re heavier than I thought they’d be!” Cas says, and Dean laughs. He looks with great interest through the stack Dean handed him. The Doors, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, and of course, Led Zeppelin, but when he looks up, Dean is holding out another album: The Beatles’ White Album.
“Wanna show you one more thing,” Dean says quietly. He stands and tugs the bed sheet back in one place. Despite Sam’s best efforts, rust-colored stains remain evident, darker in some spots, faint in others.
“I’m good. Doc says I might get to come home soon,” Dean tells him.
“Yeah, really,” Dean affirms.
is real. Maybe he’ll be able to talk to Missouri in the morning about Cas, but until then, this is all he has.
“I, uh, well, I feel safe with Dean,” Cas says awkwardly, looking over at Dean who looks supremely uncomfortable.
“You mean, like it feels good?” Castiel asks, wide-eyed.
“I’ll be quick,” he states, “I understand if you want to wait out here.”
“Oh, shut up,” Dean snips back.
But Dean doesn’t flinch, he reciprocates, savoring the soft brush of Castiel’s lips. Now that Sam knows, and he accepts them, the rest of the world can go fuck itself for all Dean cares.
"Fine," he lies softly.
“So? Are you implying that I would think you’re not a ‘badass’ because you’re with a guy? Dean, I’m not Dad!”
Dean pulls up another chair to sit by Castiel’s side. Cas is still looking as the rose bush. Its leaves are dry and a few stems are bent. The few blooms it had are wilted pathetically. Cas picks up his water glass and empties it at the base of the plant. Dean watches absentmindedly as Cas runs his fingers over a few of the dry leaves and blooms. The next moment, Dean’s eyes are wide.
“Cool. No modern pop?”
Carefully, he puts his bed back together in an effort to appear sane and stay out of trouble, and he lays on his back, staring at the ceiling, trying to get his breathing under control. His head hurts, and he feels dizzy, but most of all, he wants to talk to Cas or Sam.
When he was given his phone call at the station, there was only one number he could think to call. It went to an answering machine.
"Want you to ride my dick," Dean elaborates further. When Cas
on him. Anyway, I’d never intentionally hurt him.”
"Mmmhmm," Missouri answers, disbelievingly.
place anyone is going to look for contraband. A biology textbook though? He’s pretty sure his parents would never suspect that he would damage a book in order to hide something in it; he’s a total nerd. This book, however, can hardly be called a biology book- it only contains information on “intelligent design,” the only life “science” his parents will allow under their roof. Evolution is out of the question.
“Really? When?” Sam asks hopefully.
not let this happen, because the one thought that keeps flashing through his mind is
“Castiel?” The voice seemed to be coming from a distance, “Castiel? Ground control to Castiel!” Garth teases good-naturedly, and suddenly, Castiel is aware that everyone is staring at him, and he wonders how long Garth has been attempting to get his attention.
“Shit! I almost forgot about your ankle,” Dean says before filling a glass of water for Cas across the hall. “Well, I’m glad you had at least one person looking out for you,” he says as he hands Cas the water and watches him swallow one of the pills.
"You can't do that to yourself, Dean. Please, just come with me." Sam is very familiar with Dean's pattern of self-loathing and self-punishment. He knows Dean will run himself into the ground if nobody steps in.
“Dean?” Sam calls more urgently, “Dad?” Still no reply. Sam sprints down the hall, arriving at the bedroom he shares with Dean. The room is dim, the only light filtering through the drawn blinds in places, but Sam can see Dean’s form lying on his bed in the corner.
“Oh.” Sam fidgets with his hands before looking back up at Dean. “Why did he do that to him?” Dean exhales heavily.
"Yes, I have. But when we were exploring the wound we found that parts of the intestinal tract and abdominal cavity were
“No one would ever believe me.”
“You’re a bad liar,” Castiel grins.
“Oh god,” is all Sam can say, but the look of horror on his face is worth a thousand words.
,” Dean says, rolling his eyes.
to make up to you," Dean says softly, pulling Castiel into his arms. Then their lips are crashing together and Cas is clinging to Dean's jacket trying in vain to pull him toward the bed.
Soon, the door opens and a woman wearing a lab coat over a black dress and high heels strides into the room followed by Leah.
. I know cars, some music, action movies, and how to kill a whole shit load of things, but that’s about it.”
“Do I even want to know why you did that?” Sam asks with a smug air.
“And you are not ‘dumb,’” Cas scolds gently. “You’ve been very quick to problem-solve from a very young age. You got Sam to adulthood relatively unscathed, and you’ve gotten yourself out of so many difficult situations, that I can hardly keep track of them all.” Dean, unable to take a sincere compliment, ducks his head, face reddening.
“You got money?” Sam asked almost happily.
“He’s worth more to me than you’ve ever been,” Dean states evenly, and John turns on his heel, stalking down the hallway. Dean hears the front door slam and the roar of his father’s truck as he peels out of the driveway. Suddenly, his entire frame is quaking, and he finally lets his arm drop, setting the gun at his side with a trembling hand.  The tears come, wracking sobs that feel like they’re tearing something inside his chest, and he is powerless to stop them. He holds Cas, rocking and weeping, unable to control the tremors jolting through his body.
“Did it seem like I didn’t want to do that?” Dean asks sincerely with a hint of a smile on his perfect lips.
“I, uh, had a real nice time with you too,” Dean finally says after clearing his throat. “It’s getting cold out here though. You getting tired yet?”
“Awesome!” Dean replies enthusiastically, “these are great!”
“It’s remarkable, really,” Cas reflects as he gazes out at the city, buildings glinting in the sun under a bright blue autumn morning sky, “what mankind has built with only the human brain to work with.” Dean raises an eyebrow.
“No... to both,” Cas replies, with a shaky voice. “It’s the withdrawal symptoms again.  My chest hurts. Feels like I can’t breathe.” Dean hears Cas sniff, can feel him wiping his eyes, and knows he’s crying again. All he can do is hold Cas a little tighter, kiss the back of his neck, and hope Cas can get a little sleep eventually.
“Yeah, for the most part. A little beat up, maybe, but I think he’s fine now.” Then Dean heaves a breath, “it really scares me, though, you know? The thought that a demon could get a hold of Sammy? Or you...” The last two words are barely audible, but Cas hears them, and they send a chill down his spine. “I have nightmares about it.”
“Cas,” Dean sobs, “Cas, I’m so, so sorry.” Slowly, Cas lifts his chin, raising his eyes to meet Dean’s. “Please, Cas, please forgive me,” Dean cries harder, nearly hysterical.
"Now, are you crazy, or are you a fucking liar?" John spat at him.
though he still feels the need to clarify to the barista that it is NOT for him. The barista clearly doesn’t give two shits about who it is for, as it is fucking five in the morning and it is already busy.
“Me too. I would take you in a heartbeat,” María says sincerely, and Castiel suddenly has tears in his eyes that he struggles to hide.
Dean gropes for the used towel that had been tossed on the floor at one point and cleans Cas up a little, wiping at the sticky mess he’d made of Cas’s chest. Discarding the towel once more when he’s finished, Dean tugs a blanket up over them, wrapping it securely around Castiel’s shoulders. Together, they fall into a blissful slumber amid the post-orgasm haze, Cas warm and safe in Dean’s arms.
“What? Wasn’t she?” Dean asks teasingly before becoming sincere, almost shy. “
"Me too, Dean," Castiel agrees, settling back, taking Dean as deeply as he can. Dean moans, throwing his head back onto the pillow.
“Anyway, I can get you Ativan or Xanax,” Pam says, “but they aren’t cheap, and you gotta
"When can I see him?" he asks hopefully.
“How is Cas?” Sam whispers.
“Alright!?” Dean says incredulously, “dude, it looks like a fuckin’ photograph. Seriously, man. Wish I had some kind of talent.” Castiel can feel his face practically burning up, he’s blushing so hard. It’s embarrassing, but he can’t hide his smile either. Glancing shyly up at Dean, Castiel can feel in his gut that the boy isn’t fucking with him. And Dean seems so confident, so genuine, that some of Castiel's nerves go away, and he finds himself having a
“Oh,” Cas says simply. “So, uh…”
been pissy with anybody?” Dean jokes and Sam shakes his head, grinning.
“Eww, Sam, gross!” Dean exclaims. “Trust me, Cas knows what he wants, and I’m not forcing
“If you say so,” Dean says, handing Cas a pill and glass of water, “probably time to take this, though.” Castiel complies. Then Dean notices that Cas is beginning to shiver.
“Why? You interested?” Dean teases him, grinning, and Cas rolls his eyes.
“Cool, ‘night Cas,” Dean says quietly.
“Can’t wait till you’re feelin’ better,” Dean whispers in Cas’s ear as he slips his hand up under Cas’s shirt. The press of Dean’s palm, warm and solid against Castiel’s chest, sends pleasant tingles through his body, and he shivers involuntarily. “Was that a good shiver or bad?” Dean asks softly, brushing his thumb along Cas’s cheekbone.
“Dean, are you mad because I masturbated in the shower?” Castiel asks evenly. In reply, Dean chokes on his coffee, coughing and spitting everywhere, his face bright red. Cas sits quietly on the edge of the bed, staring as Dean recovers himself.
“Yes, I think so,” Castiel replies.
"Was he able to tell you anything?"
He feels his heart speed up a bit, but tells himself Dean had
“Yeah, maybe, my head hurts, but let’s just go, okay? Please?” The overwhelming need to escape is building in Castiel’s chest. The feeling is an old acquaintance, a commencing panic attack, and he just wants to pack up and go before he becomes a useless, shuddering lump in the corner.
"Why what?"
"Shivering, Cas. You're shivering. It's a thing human bodies do when they're too fucking cold!" Dean grabs Cas's arm and realizes he's completely drenched. "We've talked about this. You have to take care of yourself now. You can't sit outside in the rain all night because you could get hypothermia and die!" The words make little impact on Castiel.
"Cas?" Dean breathes against his ear.
“Yeah, he is,” Dean grins. Sam just nods, eyes still averted. “Hey, Sammy, it’s okay, you can ask me whatever, won’t be mad or anything,” he assures warmly, and Sam eventually meets his gaze.
“Dean,” Castiel says seriously, looking into his eyes, a hand to one of Dean’s cheeks, “I love you.” Dean’s breath catches in his chest, and he’s sure his mouth is probably hanging open stupidly.
Cas begins to stir, mumbling something unintelligible to Dean’s skin. Dean feels the scratch of Cas’s stubble against his chest, so different from any sexual partner he’s had before. And then, something else. Cas is beginning to move against him, and Dean becomes acutely aware of the morning wood Cas is sporting, pressing into his side. Suddenly, Castiel’s eyes flash open, and he realizes what he is doing. He panics, pushing himself away from Dean, his sleepy brain forgetting Dean’s promises from the night before.
“It was for me too,” Dean admits, feeling his face flush.
“What?” Dean asks.
“Alright,” Dean says with a grin, flipping on the stereo and throwing the car into reverse. “Fuck you, uncle Zach!” he yells as they spin around, leaving deep ruts in the perfect lawn and throwing mud up the side of the house.
“Where to now, Cas?” Dean asks, turning to him as Sam and Ruby disappear into the school. “You hungry? Don’t got much at home, but I know a place with cheap breakfast burritos. Cas?” he says again when Cas doesn’t respond.
figure out where you live, and she
“Yeah. The meds they have me on seem to be working, and talking about it, and of course, being away from my family doesn’t hurt,” Cas ends with a grin.
a “chick flick” moment, but it’s fuckin’ awesome.
. The first time I listened to
“And was it?” Dean asks, “pointless?”
The near-constant erections are also going to be difficult to hide from Sam.
a wall, or you hit a wall?” Sam asks with a smirk.
"Don't be frightened, Castiel; I am only helping you. Now, come here." Again, Castiel complies, terrified and humiliated, standing before his uncle completely naked. "Turn around. Kneel... bend over the bed."
you know better than to try and play dumb with me. I saw you holding that young man's hand."
“Yes Dean, it was pleasant,” Cas answers calmly.
“So, how do we get it back?” he asks suddenly.
"Plenty of time for that later, angel," Dean says with a smirk, running his fingers through Castiel's surprisingly soft hair.
“Gonna take good care of you, Angel,” Dean assures him, tightening his grip, running his fingers through his silky, dark hair. “Don’t worry, Cas. Soon as Sammy’s up, we’ll go see Pam again. She’ll be able to help us. Once you ‘n Sammy get that tattoo, I’ll be able to breathe again.” Cas nods. He’s worried he won’t be strong enough, that he’ll cry or something during the process, and Dean will be embarrassed, but if getting tattooed will relieve even a little of Dean’s fear, Cas will try it.
“I don’t wanna go!” Sam shouts at his father, “I wanna stay here with Dean!”
, but at Dean’s side, maybe he’ll be okay. Maybe; but he’s beginning to feel paralyzed, unable to gain any control over the hammering of his heart or increasing pain in his head.
"C 'mon," Dean says, reaching across Cas then to push the door open, not an easy feat given the wind beating against the outside of the car. Cas climbs out of the car with a groan, Dean following after him, wrapping his jacket around Castiel's shoulders as the chill wind hits them. Dean takes Cas by the hand, leading him toward the low rock wall separating them from the cliff's edge. Cas leans into Dean's warmth as they stand together, gazing out toward the horizon.
"No, not about what happened." Well, nothing that didn't involve angry fucking angels.
Once Castiel is breathing at an average pace, Dean excuses himself for a moment, returning with another glass of water, a cool washcloth, and an ACE bandage. He hands the water to Cas with another pain pill, which Cas accepts gratefully.
“Um, no that’s ok, I’ll try back tomorrow,” Castiel replies disappointedly, but decides he’ll give asking for Dean a shot. “Um, is there any chance I could speak with Dean Winchester?”
“What didja do that to him for?” Dean asks, irritated.
I always remember that Castiel likes guys because I usually call him 'Cas,' which is three letters, like 'gay.'" Castiel wants to crawl into a hole and disappear at this point, but Dean can't help but burst out laughing.
“They attacked you?” Dean asks quietly.
"Amongst other things," she agrees. "Now Leah will see to the tests and paperwork. I wish you both the best, and I do sincerely hope that your decision not to be seen further doesn't end poorly."
“You’ve gotta be shittin’ me,” John finally mutters, shaking his head in disbelief.
“Fuck,” Dean swears, rubbing his face, “listen, I’m really sorry if I gave you the wrong idea about… I dunno… anything.” Castiel is silent for a while as tears continue to leak out of his eyes. He’s glad Dean can’t really see him right now. He wants to run and hide. “Cas, you’ve been drinking. You’re probably not thinking straight. You’ve been watching all that romance shit, and, well, You probably didn’t mean any of this, whatever happened… I’m sure it’ll be better in the morning, okay?” Castiel’s head spins with Dean’s words. It’s bullshit. Sure, he’d been drinking, but it’s not like he didn’t know what he was doing. And Dean, for once, wasn’t drunk at all.
“Thanks, you too,” Castiel replies with a smile before making his way back down the hall to his room. He doesn’t see Missouri shaking her head as she watches him go.
“Yes,” Cas whimpers, shaking and dizzy. Dean continues to massage his clothed cock while sucking and kissing at his neck, his breath hot in his ear, sending shivers down his body.
gave you your appetite back..." Castiel glares at her as she stands and saunters up behind them. "Hey tiger," she purrs against Dean's neck, grabbing a handful of his ass as she smirks at Castiel.
was the most amazing thing I had ever heard in my entire life. Going back and listening to it sober, however, did not disappoint. Seeing a Pink Floyd laser light show high was pretty fun as well, although it was like me, my fiance, and my brother, and a bunch of moms with kids, and I was like "oh my god! They're gonna be able to tell I'm high!" Of course, no one noticed, and likely, no one would have cared... Anyway, sometimes I'm pretty sure my brother and I were born in the wrong decade...at least music-wise.
“I’m sorry,” Cas replies, head bowed, “l didn’t know.” Dean smiles at him.
“How does the idea of being attracted to a man make you feel?”
"And you've always been so good about following the rules. You know I have always trusted you, and I've given you as much freedom as I am allowed to give anyone."
“Shit, neither of us are good to drive,” Dean says. “Damnit, I didn’t mean to leave Cas alone so long.”
“Oh,” she says, turning back to Dean as if he had asked her what “the offer” was. “I offered to take care of that pesky virginity of his,” she says nodding at Cas. “I think I could turn him if he’d give me a go at it,” she says with a wolfish grin. Castiel looks like he wants to crawl under the table.
The first time Dean mentioned this to his father, John had told the then four year old Dean that he had only imagined it. The second time Dean brought it up, he was six, and John told him not to talk about that night again. When he was nine, Dean had a nightmare about flames and yellow eyes. That time, John was angry. He told Dean to grow up, to "quit crying and act like a man for once." Only idiots believe in shit like that, his father had told him. The visitations began soon after that.
“No, Dean,” Cas replies, “it’s not your fault.”
“Let me help you up,” she offers. Cas nods and then remembers-
“The two aren’t mutually exclusive, you know,” she says casually.
“Listen, Sammy,” Dean begins, his tone more serious, “thanks for coming when I called.”
be. It leaves him breathless, but also
Cas and Dean walk to the center of the large standing stones. The Columbia River is visible far below, spread out in front of them in the openings between the standing stones. They have the place to themselves as they walk around the large circle of the monument, the wind ruffling their hair and rippling their clothing. Cas stops in front of a large slab in the center of the circle. On it he reads:
want you out of here and back with Sam and me. I never saw angel-Cas back away from a challenge, and I expect the same from human-Cas," Dean ends with finality. Cas looks up at him with big blue eyes full of fear and doubt.
“You want to shower first?” Dean asks casually, turning to Cas.
of all people should understand why I
“You’re not coming with me?” Cas asks urgently.
“I hear you. Jeez, and I thought being named after my grandma was weird,” Dean laughs, “but fuckin’
“Yeah, Sammy, us and Cas. Hoping there’s a way I can get custody of you away from Dad, so I’m the one with legal rights to you. That what you want?” Dean asks.
The roar of the waves seems to quiet, falling into the background as Cas hears only Dean’s breath. He lays his head on Dean’s chest after a while and listens to the reassuring thumping of his heart. He’s here, he’s real,
"Great. Now you'd best run along before you miss lunch." Dean
“Nah, I guess I like ‘old people’ music,” Cas admits.
“But, would they help with, like, panic attacks and stuff?” Dean asks hopefully.
“Dean, I apologize if I said the wrong thing again,” Cas says quietly, eyes averted. The hurt in his voice, however, hits Dean like a dagger in his chest.
“Yeah, Dean, I’m great,” he says confusingly, with both a wide smile and falling tears on his face. “Sorry, don’t know why I’m crying. I’ve never felt better.”
Somewhere in the distance, Cas hears Dean pop the cap off the lube, and then his attention is immediately drawn to Dean’s fingers, cool and slick, circling his entrance. His whole body tenses, with nerves, excitement, he’s not sure, probably both.
Dean pulls a chair up to the bed. Gradually he moves his hand to Castiel's. He takes the angel's hand in both of his. Fuck, he aint good at this. But he owes Cas this much, and so much more.
Dean can feel Sam’s body beginning to tremble, all of the boy’s fear and sorrow, and pain, pouring out of him suddenly after holding himself together for so long. Dean holds him tighter as Sam begins sobbing uncontrollably, his tears hot as they make contact with Dean’s skin.
“Never mind, Cas, we’re not having this conversation… oh, one thing though: if any website tells you there are ‘hot singles’ in your area, it’s a trap. Don’t fall for it.”
“Well, I dunno, maybe a little. I just... I guess I’ve kinda been feeling some unusual things lately, and I’m sorta... questioning some stuff, so maybe it bothered me more than usual...” Dean can’t believe the words coming out of his mouth, but they just won’t stop now that the floodgates have opened.
“Dean, sweetie, what’s goin’ on? You okay?” Pamela asks sincerely.
“Sammy, are there any kids at school you could stay with til I’m out of here?” Dean asks, wracking his brain for any solution that doesn’t end in losing Sam to the system or Sam being hurt again.
“There wasn’t a fire?” Sam asks softly.
“No, I get it. Dad said some awful shit to you growing up. I never understood it, still don’t, but I’m not surprised it fucked you up a little,” Sam says sadly.
“Hey!” Dean speaks in a rough voice as he inches closer to the bed. He flips on the light with one hand while keeping the gun pointed at the motionless figure in his bed. “What are you doing in here?” But Dean’s breath catches in his throat when the figure slowly shifts and his face comes into the dim light of the cheap motel room.
“Sweet baby Jesus,” Dean moans, “now
“No way, Cas,” Dean assures him, pressing his lips to Cas’s hair, “promise.” In turn, Cas snakes his arms around Dean’s middle, grasping handfuls of his teeshirt. “Was it one of your teachers?” Dean asks softly, but Cas shakes his head. Dean’s stomach twists; he feels sick, but he needs to know. “Someone in your family?” Cas doesn’t really answer, but the way his muscles tense and shake tells Dean he’s guessed correctly.
Missouri drops by once more before the end of her shift, telling him where he can brush his teeth before wishing him a good night and saying she’ll see him tomorrow.
“Why the fuck are you asking me this?”
“When are you coming home? Wanna see you,” Sam sniffs.
“Sit down, Dean,” Cas says unexpectedly.
“From a church, dummy,” Dean snarks.
“Oh, Cas,” Dean says past the lump in his throat. He grips Cas’s hand tightly, caressing the side of his neck with his other hand. “I’ll never understand how such a fucked up bunch of people could have someone like you come out of it.”
“No, Dean,” Cas says slowly, “I just thought… well, I thought you
“I’m not planning on telling my dad, though,” Dean continues, “not ’cause I’m ashamed, just that I know he’ll get piss-drunk, call me a ‘faggot,’ and try to beat the living shit out of me. The longer I can keep him from knowing about us, the better, for both our sakes.”
“Let me take a look,” Dean says, kneeling down as Cas pulls his legs up onto the couch. “Take your sock off.” Cas looks embarrassed, but obeys, pulling his pant leg up a little too. Dean frowns as he looks at the ankle. It’s very swollen and beginning to bruise. “Can you move your foot and toes?” Dean asks gently. Cas does, but it’s very painful. “It could be broken,” Dean says, “but it could also just be sprained pretty bad. What do you think? I could take you to the hospital or something.” But Cas shakes his head.
“Pamela, darling, Pamela,” he speaks again, nibbling her hair.
Meanwhile, Cas steps carefully into the shower, trying to balance mostly on his good foot. It’s nothing like the spotless, high-end shower he had in his bedroom, but the way he feels here, with Dean, makes it a million times better. He still feels like a ball of anxiety, but he is at least pretty sure he can sleep through the night without fearing for his safety. At least here, he isn’t alone.
Hesitantly, Dean knocks on Castiel's closed door.
a burden.” He puts a hand on Cas’s knee. “Dude, you’re family.” Cas smiles weakly at this as Dean hands him a bottle of Listerine. “Rinse and spit, Cas.” He does, and then Dean helps him to his feet. He sways, falling against Dean as they walk slowly back to his bed.
“Whatd’ya mean?” he asks.
“You sure you’re up to that, Cas?” Dean replies, unconvinced.
Cas is slow to wake, nearly slow enough that Dean begins to worry, but soon, he’s leaning heavily against Dean, stumbling down the hallway to the bedroom. He feels tired and boneless, moving in a clumsy, mechanical way, dazed enough that he doesn’t even wait for Dean to turn away before he’s removing his clothing, collapsing, naked, prone on the bed. Cas may be drugged out of caring, but Dean respectfully covers the lower half of his body with a blanket as he cleans the wounds on his back, only uncovering Cas as he needs to. Cas is asleep again by the time Dean is finished.
Dean turns and steps into his own room, flipping the light off and collapsing onto the bed. His arm is beginning to itch unbearably at the suture sights, and Dean really wants to scratch them raw. The only thing that stops him is the knowledge that tearing his arm open would likely prolong his stay here indefinitely, so he groans and rolls over in bed.
Cas feels his heart begin to race; it’s been slowly picking up speed ever since Dean paid the bill and they headed back toward the hotel. Now, as Dean unlocks the door to their room, he feels it may burst. He bites his lip, feeling altogether nervous and excited, hoping that Dean truly meant what he’d been saying all day about this night. Dean meant it.
Trigger warnings for implied/referenced self harm and anorexia ❤️ (Brief mentions of both- nothing explicit)
“Awesome,” Cas says, borrowing from Dean’s vocabulary.  Dean grins and kisses him thoroughly before suggesting they shower. Dean is the first to reach the bathroom.
Dean bit his lip, nodding almost imperceptibly as tears rolled down his burning cheeks.
maniac, anyway,” Castiel says accusingly.
, but now, as Cas experiments with his new body, he has started wondering what it might feel like if Dean were to touch him in a more… intimate way. He thinks he would enjoy it, probably enjoy it a lot. Yeah, actually he’s quite sure he would like Dean to put his hands on him, all over him, maybe kiss him. Definitely kiss him. Use his mouth all over him like he’s seen in the videos he’s caught Dean watching. Is that what sexual attraction is like for humans? He has also come to realize that he dislikes the idea of Dean touching another person in that way. The though of Dean with someone else has begun to cause a very unpleasant sensation in his stomach. Is that what love is like?
“But they think we’re brothers, Dean.”
Earlier that morning:
Sam packs up his stuff then, says his goodbyes to Cas, and Dean walks him out to the Honda Civic he’s been driving.
Gradually, Castiel falls into Dean’s rhythm, turning his head the way Dean guides it, opening his mouth with a thrill as Dean requests it with a light flick of his tongue. As Dean pulls him closer, he moves like putty in Dean’s hands, allowing Dean to mold him into any shape he desires. Dean brings him onto his lap, Cas straddling him, face to face as Dean continues to hold on to him firmly at the waist. Cas clings to Dean’s shirt before running his hands up into Dean’s sandy-colored hair. When he opens his eyes, he can see Dean’s freckles so clearly, sprinkled across the bridge of his flawless nose, and Dean’s eyelashes, which bolster Castiel’s belief that Dean’s eyes are the prettiest he’s ever seen.
Once again in the privacy of their room, Dean starts the shower and gently undresses Castiel, tossing his sandy clothes in a pile. Together, they step underneath the hot spray, the warm steam warming Cas’s lungs. Washing Castiel’s hair strikes Dean as possibly the “girliest” thing he has ever done, but he has to admit: he’s super into it. Cas seems into it too, sighing softly as Dean runs his fingertips over his scalp. Dean washes and washes, and finally gives up on getting all the sand out. Good enough for now, he thinks; if things go according to plan, he’ll have Cas back in the shower before too long anyway.
“She, uh... gave me a kiss goodnight,” Sam confesses rather dreamily.
“The wine list is pretty great,” she says, “the Riesling is probably my favorite: not too sweet, not too dry.”
Dean gasps. This
feel better, for now anyway. But he fears the end of this day, the end of Dean standing so closely, speaking only to Cas, no irritation in his voice, sharing his car and his music, the things that truly make him happy. Cas is afraid they’ll return to their motel and the next morning will be like all the others before. He is confused, unsure, but he knows they need to talk about what happened: the kiss, Dean’s reaction. Cas knows they can’t bury it, act like it never happened, and just move on. That would kill him; but he doesn’t want to bring it up now, not when he is enjoying Dean’s company so much. He doesn’t want to ruin the moment, piss Dean off again. That would be a long, awkward drive back. Or maybe Dean would just leave him out here. No, he tells himself, Dean wouldn’t do that; he promised he wouldn’t, but Cas is scared nonetheless.
Castiel can’t believe his ears as he listens with bated breath. Dean is equally astounded, though his initial reaction is along the lines of hysterical laughter, which he tries desperately to stifle so they can hear the rest of the report. The reporter goes on to provide physical descriptions of each boy, though she has Dean’s height and weight somewhat wrong. And then comes Dean’s favorite part:
"Even so, you know that physical contact of any kind is prohibited, whether it is romantic in nature or not. Now, I'm not saying you can't talk to Dean, you just need to keep it out in the open. And if he is having problems, he needs to speak with his therapist about them. I know your heart is in the right place, Castiel, but like everyone else, Dean needs professional help, and you need to focus on yourself." Castiel doesn't argue. Instead, he nods his head sadly, tears continuing to roll down his cheeks.
“God, you fuckin’
"Mary," Dean answers softly, "my mom's name." Cas pauses his tracing to look up at Dean. "Things would be so different if she were still here," Dean says wistfully.
“The woods,” Dean answers. “This is Charlie.”
“Dean tell you what it’s like?” she says with a grin, and Cas nods shakily.
“Sit,” Cas repeats with a grin, and Dean complies, sitting in the nearest chair, gazing, amused, up at him. Quickly, and rather ungracefully, Castiel rids himself of the remainder of his clothes, and Dean flashes him one of those crooked smiles that drive him a little crazy with want. Dean's gaze quickly falls to Castiel’s full erection, but before he can make a move, Cas is on his knees in front of him, unbuckling his belt, seemingly impatient to get in his pants.
“Sometimes, the only real problem with a kid is his shitty parents,” Dean replies pointedly.
“Do you think Sam won’t like our involvement with each other?” Cas asks sadly.
“Quieter, Cas. Quieter,” Dean says turning a little red again.
wants him, and he feels like he is going to cry. And then Cas notices: small round scars in rows on Dean’s abdomen. Cigarette burns. His breath catches as he wonders whether Dean had been a victim of abuse or only a victim of himself. Cas hopes that one day Dean can love himself.
“It’s Sammy, he’s hurt, and he’s alone in the ER, and I
“Need it,” Cas gasps out like he’ll die without it. Dean holds Cas close as he carefully positions himself and slides inside with very little resistance. Castiel trembles in his arms, moaning softly, his muscles clenching around Dean as they move together slowly. Dean rolls his hips languidly, dragging soft utterances from Castiel’s swollen lips.
“Yeah? You gonna come for me?” Dean grins down at Cas whose eyes are squeezed shut, his face all screwed up in pleasure. The next moment, Cas is gritting his teeth as his hips jerk, a strangled cry escaping his throat, and Dean can feel white-hot come spurting between them, hitting his belly and fist. As Dean continues moving his hand up and down the lengths of their cocks, Cas’s hot come coating them now, he knows he isn’t far behind. Cas is still panting hard, coming down from his orgasm, as Dean tries to stifle the loud groan from his own throat, coming hard against Cas’s abdomen, over the scars there. Dean collapses onto Cas, and they stay that way for a while, breath heavy, grinning against each others’ skin. When Dean finally groans and rolls off of Castiel, Cas runs a finger through the mess on his own belly, grinning and snorting a laugh.
“Guess again, Dean,” Cas’s mouth speaks, but it isn’t him. Not
“I’ll explain in a minute.” Dean puts the finishing touches on the intricate pattern he’s painted on the hall carpet. He double and triple checks it against the notes he has and ultimately concludes that it is correct and finished. He straightens up and steps gingerly around the symbols and over the salt line before closing the door softly behind him.
"Well, I'm not going anywhere."
happy I’m here with you.” Cas’s face lights up hearing this. He knows what Dean promised, and that Dean is a man of his word, but there is still an insecurity in Castiel that gnaws at the back of his mind, telling him that Dean could change his mind without warning.
"Meg! Quiet room, now!" Missouri's voice comes booming across the room before Cas or Dean even have time to react.
“But, you’ve,” Castiel begins again.
“No. Thanks though.” Missouri says her goodbyes, and Dean finds himself alone again. He thinks about Castiel sleeping in the room across the hall, and he finds himself thinking it would’ve been nice if he
“Sure, that'd be great,” Sam replies cheerfully.
“Yes, that’s a good idea,” Cas agrees.
"So I suggest you drop this whole fucking 'demon' idea and
“Okay,” Dean concedes. “What were you taking?”
When they arrive at the bar, Dean pulls the door open, holding it for Cas and Sam. The place seems cool, casual and “divey,” but lively enough with a couple pool tables in the back and a few pinball machines. Dean snorts a laugh when he spots the bartender whose beard and handlebar mustache give him the appearance of having just arrived from the 1890s.
“...hold your hand?” Dean grins. “‘Course I will.” He kisses Castiel’s forehead, and Cas relaxes a little.
Quickly, Dean scrawls out a message, followed by a sigil Sam is familiar with, the same one Dean has tattooed on his chest. Sam smiles when he sees it.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam says happily with a smile that makes Castiel’s chest feel all warm inside. He doesn’t know what he’d do if Sam disliked him for some reason; it would crush him.
"Eww, Meg, gross! I didn't need to hear that."
When the doctor excuses himself from the room Dean pulls out his phone and hits the first number on speed dial. Straight to voicemail.
Dean wakes up before it’s time for breakfast and decides to find Missouri. She has just arrived and is settling herself down in the nurse’s station. Dean approaches calmly, leaning against the counter, trying hard to turn on that “Dean Winchester charm.”
Castiel’s back aches. It burns every time he moves, cracking his scabbed skin. He has to wear only black tee shirts; anything else gets blood-stained immediately. The pills that María gave him help, but they also make him feel strange and sleepy. He takes another one though as he lays on his side in bed, thinking about Dean. Dean had promised to take him away from this nightmare, and although Castiel has his doubts about Dean’s ability to actually do so, he lets himself picture it: jumping into Dean’s car and holding on tight as Dean guns it, racing off to - well anywhere, really. Cas doesn’t care. Anywhere would be better than here, anywhere with Dean, at least.
