Or is it me? I'm not sure. Actually I'm not sure about anything anymore. It's like I'm just existing - everything is if and how now... nothing's will or is.Â  This isn't living. This is dying. And I don't like it.
John takes it, however he is a bit reluctant. "Oh, Okay." He pauses. "Em... what exactly am to do with this?"
Time to test his observation skills. I must know how sharp his mind is - see if he's been listening and observing my method's correctly.
I pant for air, breath catching in my constricting throat- it sort of hurts. I groan in distress, and bury my face in the shorter man's chest. It doesn't help much.
The detective turns instinctively to the unconscious soldier, and quickly bites back a sob- John looks so peaceful...almost as if he's no longer suffering.
He becomes diffident- his once sunny-blue eyes, now darkened with insecurity. "Oh, sorry. Too soon?"
Night had fallen, and John had not yet returned. He left after our fight, and oddly enough... I was worried.
He smiles and glances up at me, "Um.. not yet." He chuckles slightly, before returning to studying the menu. "How bout you?"
"We're here because there is still hope!-" the brunette refuses to listen- being stubborn as usual. "I know there is. I know it."
The only one I had intended on seeing during this period was John. No one else. But still people came to visit.
"Be reasonable, Sherlock, the doctors have ran numerous tests, done brain scans, examinations-" Mycorft shakes his head for affect, "and each time, each test came back with the same result, negative."
As he sails off I lean backwards, closing my eyes - now flat on my back. Observing. Thinking. Something that I won't be able to do for very long. Which is why I must teach John all I know.
He forces a smile, but it's wry. "Yea. Sure. Sounds good." He looks out from the cab, through the window; I presume to avoid being deduced.
Before we knew it the evening had come, and the sun had just begun to set. Lestrade gasps at the sight, realizing how long we had sat talking.
"I see my life being stolen - I see giving in - I see the pain, the drugs - your suffering... Taking my life will spare you the pain of watching this disease drain it from me."
This chapter was a real stretch- had to spend countless of hours editing, and shaping the piece to fit with the rest of the story. I just hope I did a okay job. I tried at least. Any feedback would be very, very appreciated.
her sweaty fingers gently grazing mine upon the exchange. They're sweaty. Obvious signs of nervousness. She worried. Hmm.. They all are. Human sentiment at it's finest.
Stares cast onto me, jaws slacked, and eyes narrowed. Dear God. I swallow, her smile falling quicker then the words left my mouth.
I shiver, head leaning into the soldier's soothing touch. "Ugh...th-thank you, John." A yawn parts my lips- mouth open wide. I sigh. "I'm tired."
They have words to say, yet there tongues are bolted down with pity. Now assuming John has already pre-instructed them on what to do and what not to, they'll most likely just remain quiet.. And go on as if nothing ever happened.
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery. With no other treatment available, Sherlock is forced to accept his fate, and brave through it by the hand of his only friend, John Watson. Together they find hope in hopelessness, and light in the darkness, in this heartfelt - heart wrenching fanfic
As of now sleep begins to creep over me, gradually drawing me away into unconsciousness. I attempt to fight it... But it's no use. I'm tired.
The heart and the brain. Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson - we were on. Case after case. Lost in the moment.. Foolish enough to do anything.
John clears his throat. "Uhm..." He hums a dull tone, then nods. "Okay." He hands me back my will. "I'm sorry."
Lestrade cocks his head. "Well.. as of yesterday, a girl who had witnessed the fall claim the man was already dead before he hit the ground."
With trembling lips I drink from the bottle - I shut my eyes, allowing the morphine to numb the pain. Then I curl up closer to the soldier - I'm fairly surprised that he returns the affection and buries his chin on my shoulder.
So I simply keep quiet and continue to listen to his heartbeat, as it gradually slows and returns to normal.
During the gift exchange Molly couldn't help but cry; perhaps seeing me dependant upon a machine to breathe, wasn't something she wanted to see. Though despite all of this, she did her best to hold herself together.
You bloody fool! Now you've lost the opportunity- the moment was just right, and you go and ruin it. So much for being clever.
"You know, Sherlock..." He licks his lips; something he normally does when he's interested, or worried, "...not everything has to be clever to be exciting."
John on the other hand doesn't seem to surprised. I'm guessing he expected the discussion to take a while.
My eyes suddenly slam shut, and tears begin to pour. I hold closer. "I-I'm not s-sure I have a choice."
He's so peaceful when he sleeps, almost as if he's somehow detaching from reality, and gradually drifting away into a realm of calmness.
My eyes suddenly go dead, and I am met with the stoic eyes of the soldier. I yelled at him. And now i feel guilty.
As John, and I lie side by side, our skin closer than ever- warmth, and comfort between us- the sudden urge to lean forward, and kiss him possesses me.
I turn to see John standing at my bedroom door. I attempt to straighten my posture, but unfortunately I'm too weak. "John... You've returned."
"Same exact cause of death... Strangulation. However, The Golem is not one to linger. I'm sure by now he's moved on. There's nothing more that can be done here. Molly, make sure Lestrade is alerted about this!"
Gracelessy, stuffing our faces with white, butterless, popcorn, and making an absolute mess of ourselves and the couch - Mrs Hudson will have mess to clean up tomorrow.
I sigh weakly "I mean, my work- I want you to take my place." John seems against it, but I continue anyway, "You're the only one that's truly observed my techniques- you know me more than anyone else, John."
With that he turns, straightens his shoulders and strides out of the sitting room, leaving me to once again abhor my existence.
He truly does...but unfortunately Sherlock is still too afraid to let go. He feels guilty. Guilty for not being there sooner- If he had been clean, and more observant perhaps Eurus would've never slipped under his nose- John wouldn't have gotten caught in the crosshairs of an old sibling rivalry, and would've never been shot. Sherlock feels completely hopeless. Like a failure.
My God. It's harder than I thought. I don't want to spoil the moment. He may find my reason 'unsettling'
I turn around, and return back the way I came - heart dangerously racing, and veins rapidly pumping with adrenaline.
"Good." Lestrade nods, giving me a timid smile. "You start at the crime scene." he stands up, straightening his coat. "Then once ya boys are done there, you can drop by morgue."
My skin crawls with Goosebumps. I flush."John..." I pull away again, this time with more force than before - wanting to make sure he gets the point, "We're not having this discussion."
Lestrade spends the next two hours highlighting a few topics; such as legal affairs, my will, and the situation.
John nods vigorously. "Uhm.. yes!" He exclaims. "There's a murderous killer out on the streets, and we're just gonna have dinner?"
He had to let everyone know he could play an instrument too. Just like when we were kids, he'd always have to prove he was the smart one. Hmpf... Brothers.
It's always going to be like this - if I don't end it, I'll forever be a subject to the pain - to fear. I'm too worn to keep going.
Now left with only the broken sobs of my best friend, I become a panting mess - my lungs straining to regulate each breath. I gasp. "John..." I pant weakly, "pl-please..."
It hurts - the pain is excruciating - sleeping is dreadful - eating makes me sick - right now I'm nauseous. It doesn't feel quite pleasant. But at least I didn't throw up again.
He gave a warm smile, before looking back out from the window. I'm oddly satisfied. "I'm guessing that took a lot of effort."
As we proceed towards the morgue, I become slightly reluctant - my feet halting at the door. I'm disquieted.
I set down my cup of tea. "Lestrade called, said he had something that might just be worth my time..."
"Yes." I lower my hands to my lap. "I made a few adjustments to it, I've left you everything, except for a few items of family sentiment." "Those will go to Mycroft, the rest is yours to have."
He glares back at me, deliberately ignoring my wishes and upping my morphine dosage anyway. I grumble weakly, relieved, sinking further into bed. "God..." I swallow. "Doesn't it get boring?"
John interrupts me, his hands ceasing my cold, but rapidly warming cheeks- short rough fingers smoothing over soft, pale pasty skin, as our bodies meet in a new found passion-
As a result, I was left home. Now alone, I stand, back erected, violin to my chin, and bow lifted - ready to begin.
"I-I bought this, and I don't really like it, so..." she pauses, hesitating, "here." She practically crams it into my hand. "Now at least someone will get some use outta the bloody thing."
"J-john.. really..." I say, attempting to sit in bed, but failing, "Jesus..." I sigh harshly, agitated by the discomforting pain growing in my chest, "J-john.. I d-don't nn-need it. I'm f-fine."
And for once in Mycorft's life he sees terror in those teary grey eyes of Sherlock's, and wonders if ever he had quite seen them so void before. Not in a lifetime, he knows it. "Oh, brother."
He begins to read it. His expression hardens. I'm assuming he is not very pleased with what he is reading.
"Hmm..." I steeple my fingers under my nose. Now in deep thought. I've got no other options. I might as well take it. "I guess we can look into it. See what we can find."
The lack of appetite - The confusion, disorientation -Medication, beta - blockers, nitrates, diurectics, nothing seems to be taking effect anymore.
I sigh, softly, leaning back against the bed's headboard, adjusting the Venturi mask on my face- "Am I?" a gentle smile takes my lips; this time it's genuine. "Hadn't noticed."
"Still awake?" I hear a familiar voice ask. John. He can't help but worry about me. "You hate to rest, don't you?"
And then we breathe simitanously, not moving, just holding. Waiting - I suppose for a word to break the piercing silence.
John's lips purse, and his nostrils flare. "Yeah. Okay. But what about your mother and father?" His hand trembles, but he is quick to hide it in his lap. "How will they take it?"
Words fail me- my lips part but nothing comes. I swallow. "J-John... When this is over..." I breathe, chest rising slowly, then falling, "I want you to take over for me."
I've discovered with happiness comes the misfortune of caring.. how can I care for something of such mockery?
However that's another story. As of now I am preparing to handle a bit of business with John. He steps into the room, and suddenly a pit forms in my stomach.
Sherlock's eyes narrow, that brown dirty hair lying lazily in that long pale angular face. "What is that supposed to mean?"
Initially I had planned to play a new Christmas CD that John had purposely bought for the occasion. But everyone kept insisting I play violin.
I stop - my feet now as still as the floor beneath me. He wants me to apology. I'm Incredulous. "You want me to apologise?"
Words can not describe the pain that struck my heart when I heard those words. Not even the pain of my heart failing could compare to it. It was indescribable.
He turns out the lights, leaving me to wrestle through my own restless thoughts. It's hopeless. He knows it.. I know it. Everyone knows it.
I gasp slightly at the others sudden touch, he's sitting right beside me, his hand in mine, and his head resting gently on the edge of the bed.
I can't help but chuckle. Does he actually hate playing board with me that much. "As I figured." I throw on my scarf, wrapping it around my neck ever so gracefully. "Chinese?"
I squeeze my eyes shut tight, trying desperately to hold back the tears forming in them, "John... Please understand. This is where we are. It is what it is."
"Almost never is. The shoe prints. Do you see? They're position. The killer was here. He hid behind the curtain, waited for Mr Harbor to face the window, and then struck." "And judging from what Lestrade has told us, Mr Harbor was dead prior to his fall.
So John let her in, against my will, and we resumed the party. I was showered with gift after gift- cards and hugs and kisses, and so much was happening I could barely think.
He shakes his head. "No..." He croaks, "no Its not. You know it's not." His hold tightens more. God. Now the pain is excruciating. I want to comfort him but it hurts too much.
Just like that the room goes dead silent - everyone's eye, now on me. I can feel their stares. Deep. Pitiful. Faces. All directed towards me. I'm dismantled.
At least he's smiling at all. I can afford to smile more.. but unfortunately, I am not given much reason to. "Thank you, Molly. It's lovely."
Tears wet my shirt - yet I don't mind it. "No it's not... It's not okay. I was wrong?" His voice cracks harshly, "I should've never asked you something like that!" His fingers dig into my shirt, "It was selfish. For that, I am sorry."

I know I've messed up. The bleeding silence, the expression locked in her eyes. She's going to make me eat my words, I can feel it.
"Sherlock?" A familiar voice says, shifting my focus to the door. It's him - John. Knew he'd be coming. "can I come in?"
Suddenly I feel John's head nodding, and his body beginning to tremble involuntarily. I comfort him with more care, despite how weird it feels.
John steps up closer to me, then breathes tremulously, "Sherlock..." He whispers from the very back of his throat, "I'm at the edge of sanity." He swallows hard, and flares his nostrils. "One more push..." His grip loosens, "and I'll fall."
John pretends to be surprised, turning up a brow, and gasping, "-That's shocking." he smirks, artlessly. "You notice everything."
He holds me closer, and continues towards the exit. "I know..." He whispers, "it's going to be okay. I've got you. Don't worry. Just listen to my voice. Okay."
I gasp. "J-john..." For once I struggle to find the words to speak. "if you're implying what I 'think' ...your implying, then the answers, no."
He chuckles, quietly. "Well...almost everynight." He pulls away to look down at me. I avoid his eyes. "Now...to get you cleaned up."
"Happy Birthday, Sherlock." She giggles shyly. Her eyes full of admiration, and gratefulness. "Um..aha.. it's all I could afford, but I figured you'd like it. So..."
The chronic cough - The Edema slowing my heart - the fluid gradually building in my body - the swelling - the wheezing,
"No." Sherlock won't hear it. "He's breathing, and alive that means he's not dead." the brunette insists, desperate to convince himself that he, himself, is right, when truly he knows he is not.
"However, that doesn't matter, as of now, all that does is the case." My eyes narrow just a bit. "though I'm not implying we'll take it."
Meanwhile I dart from behind the table, and begin to gather up the people; some hiding, some dead, and some already escaped.
I sniffle, then bite my lip in distress. "B-because, If I'm to d-die, I want it to be at the side of the one person I love and care about the most."
Before I can finish the thought, John grabs me, gently, carefully, pulling me into his warm embrace.
My heart freezes- no sound. No words to express what I am feeling. John's caught me off guard with those words.
I smile, then blow, before feeling lips press to my cheek. Molly's. Obviously. She holds out a gift to me.
But I think the worst part of it all, is that John has no other choice but to experience it with me.
And my brother he visited, but only when necessary. For instance, he dropped by once to discuss some legal matters with me.
And we agreed that if I died, it would be on my own terms - that whatever I decided to do would be provided for; to ensure the utter most convenience.
That face buries itself in the soldier's hospital bedsheets, and a white pale hand reaches out to touch the tall man's shoulder.
It's rather foreign to me. Strange. Byzantine - yet it comforts me, so I allow him to hold me tighter.

However, Mycroft, and even Sherlock, despite how much he tries to deny it, knows that is not the case. "He's suffering.' Mycorft exclaims, his voice barely cracking as it raises- "it's been five years, Sherlock, this is no life for a soldier."
Just as quick as my mouth open, it shut. As depressing as it may be, I can't bring myself to snatch away that tender smile from his face, by reminding him of how little time we have left. I hate having to... fff-feel.. but unfortunately.. I can't seem to help it.. when it comes to him. "Really, John. There's no need to thank."
I close my eyes, exhausted from the morphine dosage John gave me not to long ago. "G-good." I manage to open my eyes a little, just enough to see John's eyes glaring dead at me. I groan tiredly. "As long as John... is safe." I nod off, but quickly come back to. "Uhm... Do excuse mm-me." I clear my throat weakly, "er... the mm-medicine.. makes mm-me dr-drowsy."
"John, tomorrow, after the Christmas party." I close my eyes again. "I need you to end this." I blindly fish into my pocket, and pull out a little bottle containing a small pill. "I'm sick of the pain, John. I just want to be rid of it."
I awake to find my flatmate curled up beside me- he seems so at peace. Such a shame he will have to wake up to this.
My brows draw together. "My... Mycroft knows, ...an...and hhe's m-more than willing... to... to assure it's... s-success."
Sherlock shouts, "and I presume death is better!?", back in defense, and spins that head of curls around to eye his stoic faced brother. "He's my priority, not yours-"
I huff, and roll my eyes so hard it's a surprise they didn't detach from their sockets. "I know." "I was going to say it because...I love you."
I nod, but with great reluctance. "O-okay." I catch his arm, just as he turns, causing his eyes to fall back to mine. "Don't die."
Well... I mean... If you call being alone, being with a good friend. Then.. yes. I was alone quite a lot.
"Wh-what happened?" I croak, glancing around - my eyes vague and heavy. I'm in the hospital. I gasp faintly. "h-how long have I been here?"
"I won't let go." the brunette whispers over a painful sob, then closes his galaxy-grey eyes that seem almost colorless. "I promise, John. I promise."
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery.

I whimper, heart beating so hard I can hear it. His grip tightens, and I whine in response. "Oh God." Tears fill my eyes, as the pain continues to intensefy. "I need...morphine-" a sob rips from my throat- I scream, "now, John..!" I can't bear to breathe- hurts too much- "AHhuuh!"
I pull away, trying to conceal my emotions. "John, love is not an advantage." I turn my face, breath heavy and eyes wide open. "It's a curse." My lips quiver, but I bite them. "An ugly infectious virus. It blinds your insight, and clouds your judgement. Do you see?" I suddenly spin around and face him again. His hand trembles. He's afraid. "John... You're afraid. Yet love compels you to save me. Even when saving me... may ultimately kill you."
Right then my eyes fling open, and a soft, yet wry, smile spreads across my face - a dust of pink settling over my rigid cheeks. "Really?" I say in the smallest voice, eyes staring off into the telly screen vaguely.
I see him standing in the morgue beside me, spurting out suggestions, I see him shouting from the top of his lungs, because he's stumbled upon another one of my severed heads, and then, just as clear as day, I see him standing at my grave, crying and pleading for one last miracle.
This may seem crazy, but I want to die knowing I wanted to. I want to be aware til the end of it. I want to feel something.
After leaving Bart's, I and John, went out for dinner. We ended up sitting in a Chinese restaurant - the exact restaurant I had mentioned earlier.
I should tell him. Tell him why I really took this case. But no. Now is too soon. Bloody hell, I'm gonna do it.
Me sweating, and shuddering - in constant pain - just like in the nights I'd lie alone - shooting up to forget my wretched existence.
I blink and gasp, turning my back to them. The tear trickling down my cheek was enough to tell me I was crying.. in front of everybody.
My eyes narrow. "Well... Very well. John." I unclasp my arms from behind me, and face him. "I mean, you missed a few things of importance. But overall, very well."
He continues to hold me, his embrace becoming less firm, and more gentle. "shhh..." His fingers run soothing through my raven-brown curls, and I whimper in appreciation- "John?"
However, the universe has granted me the privilege of yet another Christmas. This time I'll cherish.
I chuckle. "Apparently not." I sigh, refocusing on the objective at hand. John has to learn my techniques before I'm gone. There's no time to waste. "Now, look... The marks around his neck..." My hands jam into my pockets. "What do you make of it?"
"Morning.", the soldier groans, half asleep beside me. I scoot closer, and suddenly his eyes open. I gulp. Heavens they're so beautiful-
Probably even angry. I don't know - he didn't freakout about it, and even now he's ignoring the scent of urine that's soaked into the couch and my pajamas.
He uncovers his face, then looks up at me. "Dead?" He nods. "Yes." He leans back, and folds his arms over his chest. "And the case is closed." He gives a mirthless laugh. "So it seems you've done it again."
He was unnervingly silent afterwards, seeming to be operating on emergency mode. His narvina. Comprised.
My eyes suddenly open. "You mean exactly?" I play dumb, only to by time to actually figure out how I am going to convince him that he can.
Feelings are not an option now. They're only going to make leaving harder. I must detach, before it gets more complicated.
As I sat in my room, I listened, and waited - eyes now closed and violin in hand - playing - wandering the vast halls of my mind palace.
I smirk and spike my collar, before arching a sly brow. "Managing is all I do. Come! We've got a body to examine."
"Shoe prints." I reply, glancing over the shoe prints one last time. My lips twist into a menacing smile. "The killer's shoe prints."

Sherlock collapses into his brother's embrace, and finally let's the pain show- the bottled up emotions that he's been containing- he let's them pour out like a ferocious waterfall- the ginger keeping him close to comfort that aching only human heart of the detective's.
After Lestrade left, John and I jumped right onto the case. We exchanged theories, argued about the solar system; which of course had nothing to do with case, and even shared a few good laughs while we were at it. It was simply perfect. I cherished it.. and I believe.. he did too.
"You know me so well." Our eyes meet briefly, but quickly they stray. I owe him an apology. "Ahemm..." My cheeks warm. I'm nervous. "John... About earlier..." My lips twitch. "I-i..." These things are always a challenge for me. "You were right." I did it. It's out in the open. "I am ungrateful."
During my sweep of the area, I am caught away by a peculiar sighting; shoe prints, on the floor, starting at the window nearest to me, and ending at the window that Mr Harbor had mysteriously tumbled out of.
I reach under my sheets, pulling out Cluedo - which just so happens to be one of his least favorite games - I grin, weakly, with a mischievous expression, knowing he'll refuse, "Cluedo?"
John's face instantly goes red, his cheeks warming like blossoming flowers in the carnelian yellow sun. He breathes. "Oh..." He chuckles with a tense smile- "Okay..." we smile together. It's sort of uncomfortable, but the feelings, from what I deduce, are mutual. "I love you too."
I snort resentfully, and totter away, dragging my oxygen tank behind me. I'm in pain. And I'm embarrassed. I had no control over what just happened.
Under me I can feel the cold wet sheets, clinging to my back like a caustic disease- so fragile- so close- must every minute be so reminding

We arrive on the scene, my nystagmic eyes miss nothing - glancing from side to side - eyes sharp and narrowed.
More time to care and to feel. I'm left with less time to complain - forced to finding meaning - to be happy.

"Th-they're wrong.", Sherlock whines into the taller ginger's chest, and beats his fist into it as the harshness of this reality sinks into him like the teeth of lion- merciless and untamed. Sherlock is broken.
I sigh. "Obviously." I shift on my feet, now heading towards the morgue's exit. "John, this man was a British spy." My lips twist into a cocky smirk. "It's highly likely that he had tie ins with powerful people. People who couldn't risk being exposed... People who'd kill to keep their secrets... Secret." I pause, and glance back at him,Â "Or if to be exact... Pay."
He grimaces at the sight of me. "What are 'you' doing here?" He squawks, assuming a wide wide stance. "I thought you were no longer taking cases."
"Yes!" I snarl. "I'm surprised I've managed all this time without driving a knife through my skull." My lungs release a resentful chuckle. "Human tendencies..." my lips twist into a resentful sneer. "The salt on the wound. The worm in the fruit!"
His eyes swim with tears, and his hands begin to knead into my back gently - his chin buried against my shoulder. "You can't leave me."
"I know." John steps in, flashing a key - he's copied mine. What a unexpected surprise - he smiles, tenderly, and still, so characteristically, I roll my eyes. "got a copy."
I sob harder, and my arms wrap around him tighter, even though it hurts. I don't let go. "B-but will you do it?" I croak. "Will you save me one last time, J-John?"
"Of course." I clasp my arms neatly behind me, and begin pacing the polished floor beneath me. "Now, John. Your turn."
Its Mycorft- standing behind his weeping little brother- devasted but steeled for show. Unwavering in the face of sorrow. Mycorft, the man amongst goldfish. He's the only reason John's plug has not been pulled yet- because a certain someone begged him not to end this yet- that someone being Sherlock. But now...there's no other option. It has to end. It must. 'Sherlock, it's time."
"Sherlock?" John pants in fear, quickly adjusting the venturi mask back onto my pale-blue face. Though it does little to ease the pain. "Oh God, Sherlock, you can't do that!" He scolds. "You can't just remove your oxygen mask like that, Sherlock."
Sometimes I hate it. I hate how time reminds me - how death binds me into it's mercilessly hold - it's teeth sharper than its sickle.
I've never quite seen anything quite like them- molten blue, like sapphire oceans glowing underneath a golden-sunrise.
We smile at each other, reading between the lines, then before we know it we're crashing out on the couch, in the warm den, near the crackling fireplace, watching telly, and chuckling like idiots.
That we are not immortal - that people come and people go, and that we should never take life for granted. Ever...

I nod weakly. "O-okay." My arm instinctively attempts to tighten around him, but it's no use. I'm too weak. "I'm.. s-so weak, John."
My eyes fall to him. "J...just as I...I'd have th-them." I breathe weakly. "I won't hh..have them trying to... to stop me..." I mutter from behind the oxygen mask. "C-cause I just may... consider it."
But nothing - silence lingers, with all to be heard is the faint wheezing of my fragile lungs, and the wailing cries of the blizzard outside.
The firey golden sun now seeping through the diamond-white translucent curtains curtaining my bedroom window-
"Hmm..." IÂ  hum weakly, closing my eyes to the sound of my heart monitor. It weren't long before I was fast asleep.
I've always found Christmas music to be rather cloying. But everyone felt it would evoke the true spirit of Christmas.
John's hold tightens. I gasp. It hurts, but I endure it for his sake. "John... John..." I allow him to lean into me - my palm gently pressed against the back of his head. I rub comfortingly. "Its- it's okay."
I swallow the knot in my throat. "Um, John.. it wasn't selfish.." I release a tremulous breath, "actually it's fine."
And now she's staring, packing on the pressure, making it even more difficult for my barbaric mind to register any type of human emotion.
Its crazy how one can spend nearly their entire life alone, but when they finally get a taste of not being, they will do anything to never ever have to be again.
John Watson. The doctor that never left the war. His John Watson, lying in a hospital bed, unconscious and dependent upon a machine for what most believe will be the rest of his life.
Immediatly my eyes narrow. I'm offended. "I see." I say, voice slightly muffled by the oxygen mask helping me breathe. I inhale deeply. "Very well, then, it's no problem. I'll readjust it, and see to it that the things that are left are disposed of." I snort, and sneer. "Are perhaps you'll make sure of that."
John stands beside me, jaw clinched and eyes blazing wide. He thinks I'm angry with him. "And for god sakes! Anderson! Get acting lessons!"
"Hurry!" I shout, quickly leading the survivors towards the back exit. Although all of me just wants to turn back around and leave them. It may seem cruel, but... John is my best friend. I can't leave him. "Keep going without me!"
"Because I love you." John confesses, and immediately it goes silent. He means? "Always have. It just surprises me that I have to actually say it. Thought I made it obvious enough two years ago?!" His hands go up, "are was my grieving not enough?"
However, I won't say he wishes to stop caring - no. He cherishes the opportunity to feel - to show me that even if I don't care, he will. He's practically my portable heart - ready to kick in at anytime necessary.
"Sherlock wait..." He grabs me by the arm, and stands to face me. "I made a promise." His lips knit, and his brows furrow, "a promise to protect you." He steels. "And I'm not going just break it."
Now closing my eyes I begin to wonder... do I really want to give up the fight? I mean... If I take the pill, it won't be much of a struggle. It'll be too easy.
"I'm sorry." I breathe, laying down my pride, just this once.. just because people like it. And John thinks it makes me seem more.. human, "What I meant to say was..." I feign a grin,"thank you."
John exclaims, "God, Sherlock!", and holds me closer. I sob, harder. Miserable. Small. Afraid. "J-John, it-it hurts, s-so much- Ahh!"
I've spent years trying to divorce myself from feeling- striving to bury away whatever traces of human emotions I could find, only to now find my body betraying me.
I shift. "Oh, there you are." I arch a sly brow, reaching out my pocket magnifier to him. He has to learn my techniques, if he's ever to take my place when I am gone. "I need a second opinion!"
"As will I." John interjects, shifting harshly in his seat to face me. I attempt to avoid his eyes, but it's basically impossible. "But, that doesn't mean I'll agree with you when your wrong." His lips set into a grim line. "They should know. I'd want to. They will too." His eyes grab mine, "It's only right Sherlock." His face tightens, "At least let them say goodbye."
I breathe lazily - my expression now duller than the menu. "Um.. unfortunately..." I exclaim "no..!" I yank of my scarf, while giving a sly smirk. "This menu is lacking something?"
All of a sudden a faint gleam conceives in his eyes - one of admiration and awe. God. I should tell him.
I hear a soft gasp. "Y-you want me to..?" Just then my eyes open, and I hand the bottle to him. He refuses, pushing them back to me. "No...Just no."
And John... He's no better. I heard him crying twice, both on different occasions, and each time more of me died.
I inhale faintly from behind the oxygen mask on my face, before exhaling calmly. "We ww-want to... to keep this... as discreet... as p-possible." I slowly lean back, and rest my head on my pillow. This position hurts. I breathe with need. "W-we've al...already agreed to not tell... Mm-Mrs Hh-Hudson."
A prison, but also a vast ocean of pain, and war- a battle for survival- that has somehow led me here.
And John... he just stands close, watching, eyes clean of any genuine emotion. Stoic. Yet still he bares a smile. However, it's forced. A front to hide his mental war.
Quickly, he administers some morphine to me. I drink greedily, only stopping when John pulls the bottle away.
We hold for a little while longer, before John finally breaks the silence to whisper, "Don't be embarrassed, Sherlock, I've done it before too."
John chuckles, removing his hand from my shoulder. "Rest." He gives a lackluster smile. "I'll be here if you need me."
I nod, and inhale weakly, cherishing such intimacy. It's quite alarming how much I've been starving for physical contact.
I breathe harshly. "Please... John." Once again our eyes meet, but only this time we don't look away. "I'm sorry."
To feel the cold, sharp, blades of death against my skin, and the hot, taut, burn of air gradually forsaken my body.
I breathe, sucking up the pit inside my stomach. "Is..." I swallow the knot forming in my throat, afraid of what it may become. "Is the golem..."
Love is only a chemical - a hideous disease that strips us of reason - an incurable, Infectious, and self consuming creature incarnated into our DNA.
Lestrade seems unsettled by the subject, but it's the way that it is, and it's better to accept it, than to keep living in denial.
It's John. Of course it's him. It's always him. Why wouldn't it be? He never leaves my side.. even when I demand he do.
"But then you're also not implying that we won't." He adds, voice bitter and incredulous. "Look." He frowns. "I get it. Okay. You're bored. Ya miss the action. I have no problem with that. All I'm asking is that you take a bit easy while your out there."
I become dizzy. My heart. It huts. "J-john..." My vision blurs, and then I stumble. "John ..." I croak, gradually drifting from consciousness, however I refuse to let go. He may need me. "John..."
I swallow. "Uhm..." I prepare to say sorry. It's always hard to do, but for John I'd do almost anything. "... Listen ... John, I'm.. " I begin to say, but the lift opens and disrupts me. I've lost my confidence. I look away. "we should.. um.. get to work. Hmm?"
At the moment, time froze, and all I could see was John in front of me. The look in his eyes - the soldier - ready for battle. He steels and time rushes me. "Everyone under your tables!" He jolts out of his seat, flipping the table and pulling his pistol. "Someone's going to die!"
John would've been against it. Which is why we waited until John had left the room to have the discussion. It's what was best for me.. and him.
I adjust my coat, then sigh. "Yes. The Golem's." John listens earnestly. "This is his work. You remember the security guard? Alex Woodbridge?"
My heart skips a beat, and I grab my chest, breathing in and out weakly. The situation - its too much. "J-John...please."
It involved my situation, and how I would like to end it. However, it was initially my brother who felt a discussion would be needed. I didn't think one would be necessary. It was my decision. But because it would make my brother feel.. 'better' I agreed to have one.
"John." I rise to my feet. "Unless you have a fresh heart in that hand of yours, I will be needing it." I adjust my robe. "more sooner than expected it seems.
I can't keep this going - having him... suffering. Watching me die slowly. Powerless and broken - that's John right now.
Gradually my melody becomes less muffled, and more piercing. My hands now moving faster than I can control. I'm angry. Furious!
I sigh, and steeple my fingers under my nose. "John.. now we both knew this time would come." My eyes narrow, and legs cross; one over the other, "I'm just hoping you are ready to come to terms with it."
Lestrade eyes snap back to life. "Yeah." He reaches a hand to me, and I shake it. "Take care, Sherlock."
I straighten my posture. "John, sit." I wave towards the chair beside me. "There's something that I have to discuss with you."
John's eyes soften, and his face tightens with worry. "C'mon." He secures my arm around his shoulder, and carries me towards the exit.
Love.. its such a capricious thing. One minute were in it, the next, were not. When has love ever spared us?
I grimace, then begin examining the shoe prints. "Size 12 feet, slim, but ... Tall." Something tells me these were not made by Mr Harbor. I need John's second opinion, but unfortunately, he's angry with me, so he won't come without incentive. I give a dramatic gasp. "Oh god! John! Living room! It's urgent!"
John scoffs in protest. He believes he's missed nothing. However, he has.. but still, he's gotten much better.
I don't want to feel it - to know that it is closer than I've cared to acknowledge, to know that tomorrow I will die.
His words hit me quicker than my mind can register. My eyes wet with tears. But I hold them back. John is indeed a soldier - but a foolish one.
My eyes fling open to Lestrade waltzing towards me, and John standing beside him displaying a timid smirk. "How's the world's famous detective?"
His brows scowl. "Terms?" He shifts in his seat, and places a finger to his temple, while resting his elbow on the armrest. "And what're the terms here, Sherlock?"
Molly expels a refreshing breath, before Lestrade comes popping up from behind her, reaching out a gift. "Happy birthday, you idiot."
He snorts, and gives me a broken smile. "That's just the point, isn't it?" He sniffs, and squeezes my hand, "I know you... But I can never replace you."
His fingers softly press into my back. I shudder. Human contact. Its strange, but still I need it. "J-just don't."
I'm so foolish, letting emotions get the best of me. I have to keep fighting. I have to... before it's too late. I can't begin to care. I can't. Or else I won't be able to go through with what I have tonight. And that will be bad.
The thought of taking that final breath - of letting go, and becoming nothing more than lifeless bone and tissue.
After washing up, which John assisted me with, I slipped into my comfiest pajamas, took another swig of morphine, and then headed to my bed.
Mrs Hudson gasped and step backwards slightly, not in fear but in self preservation. âSherlock, your brotherâs men came and took it, I couldnât stop them, I tried, I knew you would be like this.â She wailed and Sherlock growled again, not angry with Mrs Hudson but angry at his brother.
"You will do no such thing!" Sherlock snapped and stepped forward to try and shoo her from his flat so he could think about his case, he really needed to think about the case and get into his mind palace which was he reason for the drugs. "Sherlock Holmes, you need yourself a mate." She said to him and he rolled his eyes. "You have such potential and you waste it with this stuff." She said solemnly whilst trying to tidy up for the man.
âIs that is?â he said slowly after Mycroft didnât make a move to talk any further. âSERIOUSLY, you brought me room my flat to tell me an omegas blood was on the crime scene! That blood could be from anything, the omega could have had a paper cut and you bring me away from my flat for that?â Sherlock fumed and Mycroft growled at the man he had to call brother.
âAn omega, 16 was found in his apartment, trembling with the cold. His alpha at the time had been murdered in his home, it was a nasty murder, a lot of body parts in alot of places. However, we found the omegas blood on the crime scene and that is all we have to go on.â Mycroft informed and Sherlock blinked and looked at his brother expectantly.
He paced the room for a while, trying to decide what he wanted to do, did he want to interview the omega? Not really, he didnât want to risk biting it and becoming an actual mated alpha. It was inappropriate and foolish of him and the omega might not want to either. However, Sherlock had seen the way the omega looked at him and the fear and his instincts wants to change it desperately.
âWhen he first started Pursuing me I thought I was so lucky, I would come at his call and I would follow orders like my life depended on it because thatâs what I thought an omega did. When he bit me it wasnât both wanted. I hadnât wanted a bite yet but I accepted it and carried on as normal, he would use it against me and it progressed to hitting and beating me.â Sherlock hummed and stood to pace the room. His eyes flashed darkly as a wave of omega pheromones floats through the air.
He arrived half an hour later and stormed into the office where Lestrade was, the omega was still in the interview room. âWhere is it.â Sherlock said and Lestrade just pointed to the same room.
However Sherlock could sense something else, like total fear. It made his stomach twist violently but as he looked closer he noticed more.
Mrs Hudson peeked  round the door and Shook her head and looked confused, "No." she said and Sherlock looked back at the door where his brother stood shaking his head disapprovingly. Mrs Hudson came to Sherlock, patted his shoulder and excused her self from the flat and walked past Mycroft keeping her head down.
"Sherlock get up, go get changed," he commanded but Sherlock waved him off and stayed draped on the couch he was seeking comfort in. "Sherlock, I mean it," Mycroft yelled and Sherlock sighed again and stood himself up. Slowly and with little purpose, he began walking to his room where he stored his clothes.
"If you don't stop this Sherlock I'm going to have to get Mycroft involved and you know he will shut this down." She said pointing accusingly at the drug set up. This time Sherlock actually looked toward the landlady and growled. He bared his teeth, gripped the handle and growled. He was high already but he needn't tell her that he just wanted her to leave!
Sherlock growled at the repetitive knocking on his door. Not only was he trying to enter his mind palace he was also an Alpha who was territorial at best. He stood up, his dressing gown pooling around him clinging to him to his thin but muscular body.
He closed the bathroom door and grabbed his razor where he started shaving, it had been a long time due to the drugs, he didn't really care for his appearance when on the stuff all he cared for was taking hits and solving cases and that's all he cared for right now but his brother wasn't going to drop this he didn't think.
âMy name is John Watson. I found my alpha dead, bits of flesh surrounded his apartment. I know from the second I walked in it was his flesh because when I found the body it was almost unrecognisable.â John shuddered and whined quietly in fear probably.
John sat there in fear and stared at the alpha. âI didnât kill him, alpha. Sometimes I wish I could have the strength to do it, sometimes I wished he would die, the days where he slammed me into each wall, the days where I was forgotten about in the basement. Those were the days I wished he was dead. But I didnât kill him, I didnât kill him.â John said in a whimper as tears fell silently and little whimpers of pain were heard.
When Sherlock returned back to 221b bakers street he could already tell that something was off. The door handle looked cleaner, the windows seemed to have been polished and the stairs which were normally dirty looked to have been swept... his suspicions were confirmed when he walked into his flat to see his drug equipment completely gone and itâs place his  normal kitchen, any trace of any drug totally gone and they had completely cleaned his flat. He actually stood there numbly for a second or two before letting out an ear piercing roar. He entered the flat and went around systematically trashing the place, he gripped the desk form reassurance when he was done.
Sherlock huffed and turned to his left and walked to the sofa, he collapsed onto it and let out a large exasperated sigh and then looked toward the door where he saw Mycroft standing. "Get out of here Mycroft." He shouted but sensed Mycroft would do no such thing.
Instead Sherlock tried to occupy himself. âMycroft tell me about the case.â He said in a rushed voice as his hands began to tremble with the need of another hit. Mycroft stared at Sherlock in utter disgust, his brother had fallen down the rabbit hole and it appeared he wasnât even able to claw his way out.
âMycroft. Has there been any other murderers kept secret like this one.â Mycroft paled slightly but nodded once. Sherlock actually laughed.
âI may be a sociopath but it was a crying omega, my instinct to comfort arenât all strange you know.â He said as the omega wiped itâs tears and stared blankly at the scene infront of it. Sherlock strolled out of the room, stopping next to Mycroft.
The knocking didn't stop, if anything it got louder and Sherlock growled in response. He gripped the door, swung it open and growled again. "What do you want." He snarled as his mind reeled.
My suggestion on the development between Sherlock and John be lovely and comments are always welcome.
Sherlock moved silently so he was stood next to the omega. His hand soothed Over Johnâs shoulders. âYouâre okay now. Itâs alright, I know you didnât do it.â He voice soothingly and then the door opened and both Mycroft and Lestrade stood, ready to restrain Sherlock. Instead the alpha let go of the omega, walked to the opposite side of the room and shook his head disapprovingly at the males.
âUnfortunately brother I canât give you back what you desire, you need to get clean and if that means taking your... Toys away, thatâs whatâs ill do. Now if you want to do some actual work, come back to the station, finish your interview and get this case solved.â Mycroft shouted back and Sherlock growled, gripped the phone and hummed. âI canât interview that omega again Mycroft, I told you what Iâll do if I see it again.â Sherlock warned his self control threatening to slip.
âIt felt stupid Mycroft! I donât want to interview him!â Sherlock shouted and Mycroft growled lowly over the phone. âYou will go over there and do what you do Sherlock, for godâs sake!â Mycroft threatened and Sherlock slammed the phone down hard enough for it to smash.
Sherlock straightened up and looked directly to Mycroft. His eyes crinkling with amusement as the older Holmes almost resorted to almost biting his tongue in order to keep quiet. "Oh do spit it out."
âWe arenât looking for a motive then, we are looking for a serial killer and we are looking for a reason why this man came onto his list.â Sherlock said as he sat back and watched the car pull up onto the curb outside the interview station.
âIâm not going to be able to interview him again unless you want me to pin him up against a wall and bite down on itâs pretty little neck to  make him mine.â  Sherlock gritted out as Mycroft looked taken aback at his brothers words. Mycroft watched Sherlock walk off with a stunned and numb expression and just stared at the omega and then back at Sherlock. What was going on?
"Sherlock, please do try and understand from my point of view that this is dangerous for both you and the client." Mycroft let out in a sharp tone and Sherlock straightened up and stared at his brother. "Mycroft, I'm pretty sure I know why I'm here. You want me to solve a case. Duhhh." Sherlock said and smiled again as he humoured himself with antagonising his brother.
Sherlock looked at the omega, looked at the way it cowered in fear and then mentally scolded himself. âTell me about your alpha.â John looked up, His eyes puffy and red from crying.
Mrs Hudson came upstairs and peeked through the flat door to see Sherlock At his angriest that she had ever seen. âWhere is it?â he snarled as his eyes flashed red as he gripped the wooden desk even harder.
Sherlock walked through the White corridor to a large black door, didnât seem to be anyone around which was odd so he looker back at lastrade. âThey are waiting at the surveillance tapes.â He said knowing what Sherlock meant and then cautiously pulled open the door for the alpha.
âYour new to being an omega arenât you, youâve probably only presented a few months ago so the possibility that you formed a proper bond is dull. But by the looks of you itâs like then alpha might have gotten off on you being in pain, being hurt and whatnot. Your malnourished. Emaciated and extremely tired, you have clearly got bruises that run under your clothes, you wouldnât be flinching if not. Your alpha wasnât nice to you was he? He liked to see you in pain. You were terrified on him, you couldnât have done it, itâs again your every instinct,  he was superior over you, itâs impossible that you could do it.â
âYou have to care for the omega and in return they give off this...scent. John, the omega you interviewed canât actually seem to stop because he is so young and inexperienced. When you were in that room Tell me you didnât feel better!â Mycroft growled back trying to get his brother to actually understand that certain feelings werenât all bad.
"Why don't you deduce it," Mycroft said with venom, he growled slightly and Sherlock just raised his eyebrow and shrugged before he turned to his bathroom where he knew he would have to freshen up. He knew exactly why his brother was there, he knew exactly what his brother wanted him to do and he knew exactly what he would be forced to go and take a look.
Sherlock said merrily and clasped his hands together enticing a single clap as his drug induced high began to wear off and the urge to take another hit started. Mycroft remained silent, his foot tapping the ground and his hands placed on his lap as he stared blankly out of the window.
Hope this isn't to bad, and I hope I captured alpha Sherlock for you all and gave you a little show if his sweeter side...
He angrily punched the numbers into the contacts and pressed ring. âMycroft! Where is it!â he shouted and he could almost feel his brothers smile from this end of the phone.
âThis is the drugs talking Sherlock, trust me, when you meet the omega I can guarantee youâll be A bit more enthusiastic.â Mycroft assured and Sherlock went back to trying not to think about the high that was slowly wearing off leaving him jittery and shaken up.
âSherlock, has anyone told you that being mated is like being high.â Sherlock stopped slightly, he tried to think back to it. âNo, why would they be anything like that!â he shouted getting annoyed and angry. He just wants his stuff back.
Sherlock was shaking, the high completely worn off and he was aching for more! He needed his drugs back! He breathed heavily and tried regain some of his composure.
The fear sat on this omega like a pillow over his mouth and nose. Enough air got by it, allowing its body to keep functioning, but the fear was crippling all the same. The omega sat, it talked, it would appear like it always had, but its insides were dying slowly. There wasnât an omega Sherlock could reference who knew how to handle such abuse, the crippling fear that at any given point he would be struck, beaten, starved or killed by the man he used to call alpha had turned this omega into a statue of its own mind, a statue of fear and terror.
âOkay so we have one omega, two betas and an unknown figure. Most likely that the omega couldnât have killed the alpha, unless aided by a beta or other alpha, although if the alpha was under the influence of drugs or alcohol he could have possibly been worn down. He wasnât smothered or anything he clearly was stabbed and cut apart, that shows that the killer has a lifetime of hatred and wants to leave a mark, classic of a serial killer...â Sherlock paused, caught his breathe and widened his eyes... He stared at Mycroft who had zones out at the repetitive talking.
He stood up and breathed before waking over to the landlady and putting his hand in her shoulder. âI didnât mean to be like that itâs just, difficult.â He gritted out as he searched for his phone and Mrs Hudson left quickly wanting to give Sherlock privacy.
âAre you hungry?â Sherlock asked and John just stared blankly at the alpha, of course he was hungry, he was starving! But why was this alpha taking an interest. More importantly why was this alpha here! He was practically a model, high cheek bones, lovely figure, thin nimble fingers. His skin was pale but his lips were full and pink. His head was covered with a mop of ebony curls. What was he doing with a broken omega like John.
It was his landlady, Mrs. Hudson. She was sweet enough and Sherlock on his better days wouldn't mind her company, well, for a limited amount of him. But not today, not when he was about to crack a case that he was enjoying. Serial killers were always the best in his opinion. They were so eager to get caught yet so cunning about the way they did things.
âWere these all omegaâs or not?â Sherlock asked and Mycroft shrugged and stared out of them window where he began talking.
He was in a taxi, with his brother on his way to an interview for a case. He groaned and tried to get back into his drug induced high but with little avail.
âMy alpha was a wealthy man, he had property all over the world. He liked omegaâs though, he once told me that he had a numerous amount of omegas before, too many to count and that I was special. He made me feel special.â John stopped, licked his lips and tightened the grasp around his self that he hadnât released. âCarry on John.â Sherlock prompted.
Mycroft tutted and breathed into the phone âSherlock is it such a bad thing to claim an omega?â he asked and Sherlock stayed quiet and growled over the phone, his chest rumbling with the displeasure of having to show emotions. âyes it is! I donât want to have to take care of anyone else, I donât want to have to show...emotions.â he spat and listened to Mycroft breathing.
Mycroft sensed the lack of interest and stepped in again "It isn't just about an omega though Sherlock, this is also a case." Sherlock looked back at Mycroft, his eyes now glistening with delight. "Why didn't you say so, dear brother." He said as he stepped almost willingly toward the door.
"Sherlock, that is no need to talk to me. I came because the neighbor's have been complaining about your shouting." She explained and the Alpha just stood there with a vacant expression on his face as he stared at the annoyance in his way. "I haven't been shouting, Mrs. Hudson." she tutted and walked past uninvited and gasped at the state of the small flat.
âAre you hungry?â Sherlock asked again and John just nodded. Sherlock stood up in a fluid motion and stared at John expectantly. âYou want to join me to go get food?â Sherlock asked, it was almost as if he was courting the omega. John just nodded and stood numbly for the first time in hours.
He looked at the camera and reached up to turn it out of view before walking to John. âI know itâs hard at the moment, your scared of alphaâs and you think youâve dome something wrong but you havenât, I promise you.â Sherlock reminded and crouched down in front of John. They werenât touching but it was a safety thing.
Mycroft gathered his things and waited for Sherlock to appear out of the cab, slowly he stepped into the brisk air and then walked directly into the interview station. Lestrade was waiting for him or spears and Sherlock grunted a welcome to the man. âYouâre looking for a serial killer by the way.â Sherlock said with a smirk on his lips at the confused expression they all gave him.
He bites his bottom lip and squirms, but equally canât seem to tear his eyes away from this young manâs powerful body and tanned face.
âOh John, darling. Youâre here finally. Good. I have a special surprise for you.â She purrs. âHere now, take this off.â She pulls off his leather jacket and tosses it AJ, one of her minions, her hand goes right back to Johnâs shoulder and Sherlock doesnât miss how the knuckles go nearly white from the pressure she uses to try and pull John around so he faces her. Sherlock feelsÂ  victorious shiver when it doesnât work.
He doesnât like strangers and he hates large rowdy parties even more. But Irene had told him in no uncertain terms he would be cut from the dance team if he didnât attend tonightâs post-game party. Itâs the first football game of the season and the Reichenbach Bulls having won handily means all dancers and cheerleaders are expected to attend their victory celebration.
âWhat are you doing, John?â Maryâs voice is sharp as a tack. Sherlock notes a slight flinch John makes at the tone she uses upon saying name. Thankfully his steadfastness seems dauntless.
Ireneâs voice is clear as a bell in his head. Itâs one thing that has been painfully made clear to him since day one. Duty to the team comes before everything else. And while Sherlock doesnât go in for such militaristic attitudes, itâs quite clear John Watson does.
It tastes even more nasty than it smells. He starts coughing. Janine and the players all chuckle as Sherlock coughs harder now, bent double, the concoction burning his throat as it goes down.
He glances up to see John looking back at him, not in mockery but understanding; heâs miling gently. Thereâs stubble on his cheek. Sherlock deduces that he clearly shaved before coming here but he was in a rush, there are several places he missed. Sherlock wonders idly what it would feel to have that stubble rake across his face if they kissed ----
âSteady there.â A voice rumbles in his ear. It has a deep, gravelly pitch to it that is both sexy and comforting, the combination immediately sending shivers down Sherlockâs spine and flank. Unbidden, he inhales the spicy scent of his cologne; it adds to his already spinning head.
âWith an ugly bandaid? No thank you.â His slender hand pushes Johnâs away. âIâll take the abrasion.â He looks over his shoulder at his reflection in the mirror. Thereâs a tiny line of red surrounded by a faint hue of pink where her hand struck his cheek, glistening slightly from the neosporin. Altogether it looks artfully done. âBesides, I think I look rather good like actually.â
John splutters in his haste to apologize. âNo - no.â Sherlockâs eyebrow lifts âYes. I mean, yes. God yes, dancing is amazing.
He leans over, not even realizing heâs doing it. John shifts closer too until their mouths are less than an inch away from each other. Sherlock lets his eyes fall closed, dying of expectation for his first kiss.
âYeah, just as I thought. Itâs starting to bleed. She must have hit you pretty hard.â Johnâs eye-crinkling smile and his deep calming voice is so soothing that if it were not for the fact Sherlock feels obliged to correct his statement he would probably drift off there and then.
âOiâ Watson, whereâve you been, mate?â One of the boys in the kitchen hollars. The others grin and whoop.
âDonât worry about it, Watson. Weâll take care of doll baby here.â Two of the guys from the kitchen suddenly emerge on either side of him and take a hold of different parts of Sherlockâs body, drawing him inside the kitchen and towards the far back table in an alcove. He can feel the distance between he and John grow, and hears a rush of people fill in that distance. Sherlock sighs. Surely it canât be all that bad. Perhaps John will come back soon. Heâs dealt with idiotic dancers and gymnasts all his life. These dullards canât be much worse. Just as he thinks this, one of them grabs at the globes of his ass.
Sherlock shakes his head, trying to shake away the strange cascade of tingles from his neck down his back, a shiver of electricity through his nerves at Johnâs touch.
John must see the silent plea there because the next thing he knows the grip on his wrist lifts and a broad hand rests across the small of his back, steering him back to the kitchen area.
She walks up behind John and places a perfectly manicured hand on his shoulder in an unmistakably possessive gesture.
John shakes his head and growls. âNo way heâs only had one drink. Just look at him, he can barely stand up straight.â
âFuck. Youâre so pretty.â John says softly, almost reverently, before licking his lips. Sherlock canât help but stare at them. Theyâre thin and dusky colored and Sherlock wants them to kiss him so badly he can taste the passion.
Sherlock wiggles his hips once he knows he wonât fall and the man eventually gets the idea and releases him. He quickly spins around, ready to give this Watson a piece of his mind when heâs struck momentarily speechless, his mouth falling open. Before him is the most gorgeous man heâs ever seen in his life.
âI really am the best dancer on the team. Best out of the whole university really.â He exclaims, eager to reinforce Johnâs impression of him.
âThatâs quite a mark youâve got there. Looks like the skinâs broken.â John says, not unkindly, and completely ignoring Mary. His hand rises and comes oh so close to Sherlockâs pale face, hovering a centimeter away, stopping itself from touching. Sherlock blinks and blinks and blinks and his mind momentarily stops working. A bloom of something bright, something new, something dangerous, flares in his stomach at this manâs attention.
With that John carries Sherlock out through the back entrance of the kitchen, pushing past the now maddening horde of teens and young adults and even a few middle-aged adults, all shoutingÂ  things to each other or to John or to Sherlock. Sherlock blocks them out all too easily, giddily grinning the whole way, and, going by the broad grin on Johnâs face, he does too.
Sherlock braces a hand against the wall behind him as inconspicuous as he can. His mind whirrs to calculate the situation. Should he lie? He should just lie. John believes him completely. Going by their humbled expressions and turned-away faces, it doesnât look like the other players are going to say anything. Itâs his word against Janineâs.
âDrunk? Oh please. He only had a single shot.â Janine exclaims, looking around the room for the other boysâ approval.
âNo, but you are younger than most kids here. Seriously, you look about 12. How are you already in college?"
âThough, they do look much better on you.â John rumbles, stepping closer, his hands wrap around each long pale leg, mid-thigh.
Luckily, Coach Lestradeâs house is enormous, which means plenty of alcoves and bedrooms and other places for Sherlock to sneak off to.
Thereâs a loud snarling sound behind him. âLike fuck you will.â In a flash, John is back at Sherlockâs side, and this time Sherlock doesnât need to be drawn close; he instinctively leans against the young manâs muscular frame, ready to melt into it, but abruptly Sherlock feels two hands tucking themselves behind his upper thighs and lifting him clear up off the ground. Sherlock gives a startled squeak that quickly resolves into a small giggle, either from the shock of the action or alcohol in his system or both.
Sherlock feels a wave of nausea sweep over him. This is what he was afraid of: entertaining a bunch of dimwitted neanderthals. Strangely enough, John should technically fit in that odious category, he thinks distantly. But he doesnât really belong there. No, not quite.
Heâs just made it up to the third floor, having only having gotten groped twice, and sees several possible options for empty rooms when a girlâs hand wraps around his wrist.
John chuckles deeply as he tosses away the bandaid. âYouâre a vain little tart, arenât you?â But thereâs no heat to his words and Sherlock finds himself bursting into small, tickled giggles as well.
That Sherlock is only a freshman and has already made it onto the varsity team is remarkable enough, practically unheard of, but it means his position is more tenuous than most, as Irene Adler, their team leader, likes to remind him daily. Dealing with jealousy and backstabbing is as part of Sherlockâs routine now as his warm-up exercises. He can deal with that sort of thing; he dealt with it all through high school after all. But itâs Ireneâs devilish smirk anytime he does something out of line that twists his nerves. Heâs dangling from a thin piece of string and above him Ireneâs holding a pair of scissors.
They remain smiling at one another even after the laughter passes in a moment of affectionate silence. Thereâs a sheen of sweat across Johnâs forehead and a dark patch underneath each of his arms. Observing him, Sherlock sees some of his red and white sequins have become attached to his green checkered shirt.
Perhaps itâs the liquor, or perhaps itâs the exhaustion of pretending to be friends with someone so clearly odious as she is, but something in him breaks.
He flings open the door to the hateful sounds of the jocks and girls screaming below and another fog comes inside his head.
âEnough of all this nonsense. Sherlock, I happen to know Irene wants you out back with the lower classmen. Sheâs got a meet-and-greet planned for you there.â
should have another drink.â He struts up to the door, his firm ass cheeks swaying with his model-walk, as John keeps in step right behind him.
A head of blonde curls pops up. Sherlock rolls his eyes. Itâs Mary Morstan. Sheâs one of those girls who does cheerleading, dance, color guard, rotating around as the male athletic schedule dictates. Right now sheâs a cheerleader, dressed in her cheerleading outfit, a red and black skirt of the universityâ colors and a halter top plunging low enough to give ample view of the tops of her breasts. Sherlock hates to admit it, but having seen her at dance practice a time or two, sheâs probably the second best dancer in the entire university.
Mary.â Johnâs voice is dark and gruff. He drags Sherlock closer to him. Once more Sherlock feels the radiating heat and inhales the intoxicating musk of the man. He responds immediately, his eyes falling closed as John puts a strong arm around him, a bloom of warmth filling him. His body responds to Johnâs solid presence by relaxing immediately.
His dark eyes catch the lagoon blue of the freshman. âHow are you feeling? Are you still drunk? Woozy?â He rumbles, brushing his fingers down the nape of Sherlockâs neck.
But then... those eyes. Those deep cobalt eyes, so kind and so trusting, meet Sherlockâs light blue ones, and before he can stop himselfâ¦ âOne.â He murmurs, ducking his head to his chest.
Her simpering smile falls like a hammer. âCareful there sweet cheeks. You donât want me to report back to Irene how naughty you were. Sheâll cut you faster than you can say âpirouette.ââ
He takes a deep breath and steps back, out from the gloriously strong arms, shaking his curly head. He feels like a fool. Keeping John from doing his duty.
Itâs not tiny but itâs not large either. Sherlock deduces it must be a seldom used guest room. Thereâs a full sized bed and a large mirrored dresser, as well as a small half bathroom attached, but otherwise thereâs little in the way of furniture. John sits Sherlock on the bathroom counter and sadly Sherlock must drop his legs in response. Heâs strangely relieved when John doesnât move out of the space between his thighs though.
âI donât mind.â Sherlockâs eyes leap up at that, Johnâs guttural voice triggering something deliciously unfamiliar and sensual inside his stomach. Johnâs eyes are dark, twinkling suggestively. Sherlock swallows.
âYes, it does. It means Iâm taking advantage of you.â John sounds frustratingly nonchalant, as if heâs lecturing to a small child.
Sherlockâs mind reels, going through the names heâs heard of. Heâs never cared one whit about the football players to keep them in his memory. Heâs always been too busy making sure he outshines all the other dancers. He finds himself now needing, absolutely needing, to recall any information he can about John...
More people crowd in around them. More people and more voices. This time theyâre calling for John. âYo Watson, Coach wants us downstairs.â
Finally Janine pipes up. âOh that was nothing but a little spat between dance team members. Donât worry about it.â She says dismissively. âSherly here was just being a little brat. Werenât you, dear?â
Janine is the closest thing he has to a friend on the team, but too often Sherlock feels like sheâs using him for some unknown purpose. Like now, where she all but drags him down to the master kitchen where she shoves a shot glass of something dark and disgusting into his hand. Looking around he feels nearly half a dozen pair of eyes on him and a few more trickle in upon seeing him enter. He blushes a bit as he, along with the rest of the dance team members, are still in their dance ensemble that they wore for the half-time show: a sparkly red and silver number. Sherlock, who normally loves nothing more than to show off on the field or on the stage or a dance floor, feels downright silly now wearing such a skimpy costume amongst the football players and other boys who are giving him lecherous looks.
The man is wearing a black leather donkey jacket over a tight hunter-green checkered shirt. He looks attractive and casual and Sherlock blushes like a schoolgirl at how ridiculous he must look in his slutty outfit in comparison.
âI had to pick up Murray, Sanford and Jones. Brought another keg if we need it, too.â The man says these words to his fellow players but his eyes donât leave Sherlockâs body, studying him, up and down, from his pale face, to his small frame, and
John pulls away suddenly, and Sherlockâs eyes flutter open to find the man looking of all things abashed.
John gives her a steely look and she sputters on. âWe were just trying to be nice to the boy and give him a drink. He flipped out on us and started verbally abusing me.â She adds defensively.
Sherlock pulls away, nose scrunching up. âIf you think Iâm going to take another drink of that vile liquid youâre dumber than you look.â He says between breaths.
John hums. âI wonder - I mean, well, since youâre such a better gymnast and all, shouldnât you be on the cheerleading team instead?â
âWill you stop acting crazy for one second,â John growls. âAll I want to say if for you to be careful.â His mouth is a tight grimace when he adds, âYou donât know how bad some of theses parties can get.â
dancing is amazing. I didnât mean to imply otherwise, I just meantâ¦ I just thoughtâ¦ cheerleading is usually so sought after.â
"Sherlock..." He pulls me close, then looks right up at me. "stop treating this situation as if it's just another one of your cases... cause it's not!" He shakes me gently, and sniffles. "This is real! And it's scary!" He sobs - his eyes practically pleading with mine. "Let me help you." His eyes weakens, "p-please."
The taller ginger exclaims with pity for his youngest brother, and frowns hard upon him. "Sherlock, you're being selfish." the ginger attempts to explain, but he knows Sherlock will not hear it. "For god's sake, Sherlock, look at him!"
"Perhaps you're right, John." I feign a smile, making sure he doesn't notice that I am deducing him.
Sherlock bites back his follow-up, which is that cheerleaders are also known to be vain and selfish and the school sluts for football team. Heâs pretty sure saying such things when all the girls he recently named are in fact cheerleaders is probably a
Janine snarls. She launches herself to attack him but Sherlock staggers back just in time to escape her second strike. He stumbles, though, quite thoroughly, and falls backwards onto something large and hard and very, very warm. Itâs a chest - a manâs chest, which, heâs guessing must be attached to the two strong hands that suddenly enclose around his hips, holding him upright.
âAnyways, letâs finish fixing you up.â John pulls off the ends of the band aid heâs been holding and reaches for his cheek. Sherlock pulls back.
The question catches Sherlock fantastically off-guard and his mouth drops open. John certainly didnât mean to offend but Sherlock canât help but sit back, stiffer than before. He knows very well that cheerleading takes greater proficiency and skill in certain areas than those required by dance. Sherlockâs mind suddenly conjures up unbidden images of Mary performing incredible aerial and acrobatic stunts and John slack-jawed and awed by her.
John doesnât seem to buy it. He goes back to addressing the young men. âOh, I see. I get it now. You guys thought it would be funny to get him drunk. And then what? Throw him to the wolves. The boyâs clearly already had too many. What the fuck were you thinking?â
âOh! Sorry, this costume is as cheap as Ireneâs hair extensions.â He breaks into high pitched laughter as he starts brushing them away, floating and giddy on the alcohol, his own joke, and being able to touch the Captain like this. He doesnât miss how Johnâs hard abdominal muscles clench and tense underneath.
Great. Now Sherlock is stuck. What he said is only the very obvious truth but then John does seem like one of those humble types. Sherlock just listed off a number of his previous girlfriends - and they were just the ones he heard them talk about since the semester started - but John had appeared embarrassed more than anything, very rare for a jock of his position.
Meanwhile, John glares and saunters right by him. He gets several steps ahead when he stops and turns. âMaybe itâs a good thing you arenât a cheerleader after all.â He grits thickly before continuing down the hallway.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. âOh please.â He pushes at Johnâs shoulder. He canât believe he was this close to having the man of his dreams kiss him. âLet me down. I want to get down.â His voice rises as he continues shoving at the manâs chest, to no avail; John might as well be a stubborn bull for all the good it does. His dark eyes narrow, meeting Sherlockâs own furious glare.
So how many should he say then? Eight - no thatâs too high. Five? Sounds made up. Six then - ah yes six sounds reasonable.
With the exception of his mom and his mom alone, no one has ever defended Sherlock like this. He bites his bottom lip and turns his head, doing his utmost best not to blush.
He takes Sherlock upstairs, still holding him effortlessly. After the initial rush of everything before Sherlock is able to pick up on small details about John: like the scent of whisky and leather and earthy musk. One hand spanning the width of Sherlockâs back, making him feel secure and safer than he ever has before. Johnâs strong palm holding him up, naturally having to squeeze Sherlockâs plush ass oh so gently. Every now and again when Sherlock drops a little in the hold, before John hefts him back up, how a very prominent, very large bulge digs between Sherlockâs asscheeks. The feeling of the leather and denim across his bare legs and inner thighs. Inside Sherlockâs stomach is doing wild, giddy, audacious summersaults. 10 out of 10.
Sherlockâs mouth falls open slightly. If it had been any other person heâd have lied on the spot. Heâs rather good at lying and this John Watson, though he may be extremely good-looking, appears to be quite gullible.
Sherlock gasps. The heat John radiates is like a furnace. His hands rest there, not squeezing, just enfolding loosely. He doesnât have long fingers but his palms are broad and his fingers thick and strong, and Sherlock swears he can sense each small callous. The tanned skin makes for a beautiful contrast against the smooth white of Sherlockâs legs.
âPoor baby,â she croons in a fake voice. âHere ya, go. This will make you feel better.â She pushes another drink up to his lips.
âStill. Shame she was able to leave any mark at all on such a remarkably pretty face.â His voice is lower with an unmistakable husky tinge to it that causes Sherlockâs eyes go wide and he has to turn away, his face flushing a bright pink.
âGo ahead. Go ahead and tell her to kick me off the team.â Sherlockâs voice rises in pitch as he becomes more vociferous. âYouâll all be losing the best dancer and she knows it. Get rid of me and what, keep you? You can barely do a split and my dog has more rhythm -â
âProbably because most of the others only took a year or so of gymnastics, if that. I doubt Janine even knows how to do a roundoff.â
Johnâs brow knit in confusion, his shoulders rising. âAre you sure? I donât want to leave you alone like this.â
Johnâs face turns ruddier at this too, and now itâs his turn to look elsewhere, focusing on removing the wrapper from a small bandaid.
âWell, I know a little about you, too, you know. Youâre Sherlock Holmes, and youâre new to the varsity team, yeah? Youâre also a freshman which is incredible.â He looks right into Sherlockâs eyes when he adds, âBut then anyone having seen you dance knows what an astonishing dancer you are.â
