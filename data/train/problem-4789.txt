They had lunch after Dean helped prepare it, and afterward, he decided to go around for a ride with Baby. He had a shower in the bathroom connected to his bedroom. It was a lucky thing he and Sam had had separate bedrooms growing up. He felt his brother would become fed up with him from playing guitar so often and decorating the entire room with so many posters. The room still exhibited a great collection of wall "art" collected from different rock magazines over the years. As he got dressed, he found himself looking at Jimmy Page, James Hetfield, several concert banners he had traded with kids at school from all the classics like Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Iron Maiden, and Motörhead. He had two guitars in the wall, so many more in his little apartment, which he used mostly for storage- he liked staying over at his parent's too much. His beat-up record player was still in good shape, no matter how many years; it has actually been Harry's before, and he passed it to Dean, who, instead of listening to Chopin and Mozart, blared another type of classics.
The night went on, Dean forgetting he hadn't drunk that much since Sam was in college - which meant he kept drinking. Soon, both Dean and Gabriel decided to take up singing - which everyone else tried to stop - but they didn't care, ending up with an oddly tuned rendition of Too Sexy for my Shirt and several boos from the crowd.
Dean was confused to see double the amount of gear they usually had. Their corner was extraordinarily full of guitars, amplifiers, pedals, and basses, some still in boxes, others already out and ready to be re-strung. Dean grabbed the first bass he saw, a gorgeous matte black one, that Cas had presumably prepped.
He got a reply right after, on his way down the stairs.
"You're welcome, by the way." he snarls.
"Awesome! So where you joining us?", Dean seemed very happy with the news, he started walking away towards the stage to check if something was happening while still talking to the woman excitedly but always paying attention to everything surrounding him, something he had picked up from touring so many years. Castiel felt a little disappointed, he thought Dean was handsome and that his gaydar had picked something up but turns out it was wrong. "Better that way... Never good to mix dating with work anyway right?" he was thinking to himself, polishing some basses and Dean suddenly came back.
Oh, Crowley's drinking games... One night in the old days, one of these drinking games prompted him and Crowley to end up making out in the boy's bathroom. They never mentioned it again, but Dean is sure he remembers it as well as he.
Sam ordered another round for them, and Dean asked for a whiskey on the rocks - he was feeling like drinking something strong after the cemetery visit. He falls into conversation with Rowena.
Dean glared at him as if spelling "I'm gonna kill you if you say another word."
The show was set to start three hours later, though they wouldn't have more than one hour of free time. Michael passed them next to a water dispenser and quickly said, "Dean, I have your ticket for Kansas tomorrow, it's at 11." When Dean tried to protest, his boss was long gone, rushing around, his blue suit contrasting with his dark skin.
Rowena was going to be angry if he went into the forest at night. But John would kill him if he wasn’t a useful hunter. Dean decided that he was an adult and that if he wanted to go out at night that he would. He was a powerful warlock. A monster. He was capable of hunting down one measly thing in that forest. He had done it before, he can do it now.
As Dean got to the door he stopped for a moment and looked down. He was in his regular clothes for work, but he didn’t look awful. He flattened his tunic a bit, wiping any dirt off of it. He walked in to greet the two officers that were there, that being sheriff Mills and chief Singer. He knew both of them pretty personally. Both non-magic users. They had an on-off view of magic but made an exception for Sam, Dean, and Rowena. Only liking Rowena after taking in the boys of course. Chief Singer leads him to where John’s cell was, Dean trying not to internally panic along the way. Many of the criminals were magic users and kept in a different place than normal humans so it was pretty much just John there. The chief told Dean to let him know if anything happens but then quickly left them alone. So there they were. Separated only by some metal bars. Dean gulped as he watched his dad stand up and walk silently to the bars.
Later that night after both Sam and Rowena were asleep, Dean got up and got all of his robes on. He turned to his bed and said “replicate” while moving his hands. A clone of him appeared in the bed, fast asleep. It wasn’t a solid clone but it would be enough in case anything happened. He grabbed a bag as well as a weapons belt so he could carry everything he needed on himself. He quietly snuck out of the house and rounded it to find Sisco’s stable. He woke up Sisco and slipped him an apple to keep him quiet. Once he got him all saddled up he mounted him and set out for the dark forest. “Just one thing. Just kill one thing. Blood on your hands means nothing… No. It means surviving.”
“Yeah yeah. Don’t get your broom in a twist. We got all the plants on your list before doing anything else. Sam insisted on it.” Dean tilted his head to the bag on a smaller table in the other room. “Everything we need for a full restock,” he added.
Dean sat there, looking down a moment longer. “I’m heading to bed.” He says quietly as he excuses himself. He takes a moment to look back at Rowena and his brother but heads to his room without another word.
“Those boys… They are going to get themselves into trouble and I feel so powerless. It was so much easier when they were little.” Rowena smiles at that last thought. Thinking back to before Sam was taller than she was. Singing the boys to sleep when they had nightmares about their parents. Thinking about the first time Sam managed to do a spell. He nearly set his hair on fire but he had been so happy. She would give her life for those boys. She wouldn’t let anyone take them from her. Not John. Not anyone. She walked to the front of their house, making sure all the wardings were still strong so nothing could enter their home while they sleep. As soon as she knew they were safe she went to her room. Her mind was troubled but she soon allowed herself to slip into a deep slumber. She tried to believe the words she told to Sam. That no matter where he went, Dean would always come home.
Nothing infuriated him more than Dean did. That’s what brothers do. Fight and fight until someone else comes along to fight them and then it is a blood bath of protecting each other. But when it came to their dad their they had different thoughts completely.
“Come here,” John said quietly but sternly. Dean didn’t move. He tried to step forward but all his legs would do was tremble ever so slightly. “Your head full of fucking rocks, boy? Come here.” He says again. Loudly. Forcefully. Dean jumps slightly and steps forward.
Sam laughed before rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. “Magic worked all right. I didn’t attempt much. I don’t really think I am skilled enough to make even a simple hex bag work.”
The three of them talked amongst themselves. Many topics came up in conversation. Work, magic, friends. They enjoyed their food as they exchanged laughter. An odd family, but a found family. Their bond was tighter than that of any other “normal” family out there. But a sore subject had to be brought up. Everything in Rowena had wanted to put it off, to keep the happy smiles on her boys faces. But it had to be said. “Your father is being allowed visitors. I don’t need to reiterate my feelings about your father but… It isn’t my place to say you can’t see him. You both have work tomorrow but if either of you wants to go and see John then please just let me know.”
Sam let out an annoyed groan. “Like father like son I guess. Awful dad creates awful children.” He listened as Dean let out an annoyed huff. Not wanting to listen to the things he was saying. “I don’t get why you would put yourself through that. What are you going to do when you see him? Have the past eight years just meant nothing to you? Does Rowena mean nothing to you?”
“Talk to me, Samuel. I could hear you both screaming at each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if the neighboring village could hear you both.” She said placing a hand on his knee.
Sam was the first to look back up, anger filling his eyes. “I have no reason to see John. I would prefer to go to work and then come back home.” He continued to eat without another word.
As Sam slammed the door behind him he walked back to where Rowena was still eating. Huffing as he paced back and forth. Mumbling curses and spells he wishes he could use on his stupid brother. Rowena sets down a mug that was filled with the tea she had brewed alongside dinner. Quickly moving towards Sam to stop him from pacing. Without saying anything she pulls him into a hug to try and get him to calm down. Rowena wouldn’t try to act like she knew what was going through either of their heads, but she knew that now was a time for comfort and not words. Sam slowed down and leaned into the touch of the shorter red-headed woman. Pulling back when he was ready to talk. They sat on the couch, Rowena flicking her hand so that tea would float over to the both of them.
Dean tried to level out his voice to hide any emotion from his father. “I have been working. Not a whole lot of hunting… Most things are out at night and Rowena says we aren’t supposed to go out at night.” Mentioning Rowena seemed risky enough but mentioning rules that he obeyed might as well have been a death sentence.
Smiling softly she thanked both of them. Turning her attention to Sam she said, “and you, dear. How was that little game? All your magic work? Please tell me you were able to hex your brother.”
The leaves of the old trees crunched beneath a pair of dark leather boots. Crunching as a hooded figure raced through an old forest that connected to a village. The figure moved swiftly against the wind slicing through his layered robes. Nightfall consumed the flooding light of the earth some time ago, meaning anything could be in the forest right now. The figure kept their pace before another set of boots could be heard behind them. Quickly turning around and whipping out one of their gloved hands the hooded figure yells, “Illuminate!” In a rough and deep voice. A spark of light left their hand and swarmed the other being. “Got you now.” They say again with a smirk nearly hidden behind their hooded cloak. The figure stepped towards the other being before once again shouting out a spell which flicked the hood off the other being. A man with dark hair falling just above his shoulders was revealed. His hazel eyes filled with disappointment. The other figure laughed loudly while slipping his hood off to reveal his short dirty blonde hair and scattered freckles. His summer-green eyes filled with joy from his victory. “Nice try Sammy, but you should have been quieter. Can’t seek up on your big brother if your giant monster legs are giving you away.” The man spoke while still laughing.
“Boys!” Yelled the lady, fury filling her voice. “How many times have I told you not to sneak off to play your silly little magic games in the dark forest? Your underdeveloped magic isn’t strong enough to fight against some of the things living here.” She unfolded her arms to bring both boys over to her with a flick of her hands. Despite the cocky looks they were displaying earlier, now their eyes were filled with fear.
As the tall man gets up to go to bed he gives one last look to Rowena. She gives him a look that easily says ‘he’ll be okay. I promise.’ which makes him feel better. He walks to two doors across from each other. Resting his hand on Dean’s for a moment before entering his own.
The younger brother just stood up with him, glaring at him after what was said. “Really? Fucking really Dean? Boohoo. We had a shitty life. Don’t take that out on the woman who feeds your sorry ass. I didn’t even get to know mom. I couldn’t even begin to replace her. But if it weren’t for Rowena we would probably be dead because of the crazy shit dad did. If you want to repay her by slandering her and praising that monster then why don’t you leave? Go stay with dad. Oh, wait! He is in prison.”
“Rowena isn’t our mom. She isn’t our parent. She is a wanted witch who stole some kids. Dad is dad. Doesn’t matter if he is a total asshole sometimes. He is our family. Not that freak.” Dean slammed the book closed and swung his legs out so he could stand up to yell at Sam.
“Get the hell out of my room. You and your dumb girly hair can go keep playing witch with Rowena. Playing house as if this isn’t some fucked up situation. Get the hell out or I’ll…” He hesitated before saying the words that were building up in the back of his throat. He stepped closer to his little brother, briefly seeing him as the tiny crying ten-year-old boy he used to be. Then seeing him as the tall angry man standing inches away from him. At this point, they were nearly nose to nose. “Or I’ll curse you so badly you’ll be begging Rowena to end your pathetic life.” They stood there a moment longer before Sam turned around and left, slamming the door along the way. Dean flopped back onto his bed, cursing to himself because of how he was treating Sam. He was supposed to be the one protecting him, not the one threatening him with a fate worse than death. ‘Great job, Winchester. Just like Dad.’ He thought as he picked his book back up. He read over the page, trying to see what dumb creature he had just been reading about. He skimmed the page before reading over the word ‘Fairy’ in bold letters. “What a dumb thing to add to this book. Fairies aren’t real and if they were they sure as hell won’t cause me trouble if I tried hunting a few of those tiny sons a bitches.” The thought of that almost made him laugh. He soon ignored what had just happened as he tore out the pages about fairies, tossing them into the trash by his bed.
Dean [6:59 PM]: I'm sorry for hanging up on you.
Dean checks the time, finds it just a few minutes shy of noon — he has no recollection of that much time passing since he arrived here — and figures that he’ll need to keep busy for a few more hours at least. He can’t be sure when Cas will return to the motel but he knows it won’t be before the afternoon. Not if he’s catching up on whatever work he abandoned yesterday in favor of driving Sam to the hospital and keeping them,
Dean [2:18 AM]: To Cas.
Sam's squinting at him now and Dean hopes that they can move on from this part of the conversation soon. Because he'd rather not get caught already — or at all — and if he has to talk more about the work he's doing but not actually doing, he will be. Sam has enough on his plate as it is. He shouldn't have to worry about Dean's shit, too. Or their father’s for the matter.
He stays there, cradling him until there's no warmth left.
Cas slips off his coat and suit jacket, obviously preparing himself to be here for a while, and Dean watches him hang them up on the coat rack, watches how he places the Impala’s keys on the side table and how his mouth twitches when it wobbles underneath the slight weight of his hand. He doesn’t move aside when Dean hangs his own jacket up — there’s nowhere for him to go really, the entryway is not that big. When Dean takes off his shoes, Cas follows along, ignoring his quiet protest of, “You don’t have to.”
“Of course he does.” Jo sets down a small tablet filled with shots and plops back into her seat. “He's been moping since October. And it's only getting worse every damn day.”
Dean [10:08 PM]: Sorry for making it awkward.
“Then you've already made your decision.” Not a question. Just a statement, that might as well have been yelled, slapping into him full force and with no care for how much he doesn’t want it to be true.
"I won't." It's soft but the tug of fingers in his hair is insistent, a wordless plea that makes his stomach turn with want. He shivers, feels the sudden throb of his erection in his boxers and wishes he hadn't gotten so used to sleeping in flimsy nothingness already. It's not enough protection in his world. Not now, not ever. "I don't need to."
Dean smiles, lowers his eyes back to the screen, and tries to continue his work. But he can feel Bobby still starring at him and after a few seconds, he looks back up. "What?"
“Wow.” He purses his lips. “Way to go to make a guy feel good about himself.”
He doesn't find the folder. Well he does but it's not up to date anymore and there's a stack of already opened mail sitting on the shelf and Dean really hopes he finds everything else there.
“He-” Dean averts his eyes. “He didn’t ask.”
Cas seems to be about it.
And if he cries just a little bit during the night and even lets Charlie hold him for a minute there, it’s just that the movies she picked all include fucking sob stories.
With a sneer, the chattering girl clamped her mouth into a frustrated line and stomped away from the confused Novak. He wasn't sure what had just exactly happened. Something to do with the complex emotions of females (which, for the life of him, he wouldn't ever understand).
They were both silent at the mentioned of their dad. "Dad just ignores everything," Cas murmured, shutting his eyes to prevent tears he knew were beginning to form. Cas barely knew the man.
ALSO: I'm working a new Supernatural fic about Cas and Dean's adopted daughter-comment if you wanna read the description.
Dean's face widened with a cocky smile. "No detention this time, Mort?" His grin was broad as he pulled himself into a proper sitting position and slid over the low chair arms. Landing with a soft thud, Castiel realized Dean was only a few inches taller than him. But a lot cuter.
Sam wrinkled his nose in disgust. "I don't want to see Ruby. She-"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. She cheated on you with Lilith. We know. Now just shut up, and lemme drive." With a groan, Sam leaned against the window, pressing his fingers to his temples. "You'll survive, Sammy. I don't want to go either."
Not that there was much he could do about it. When the majority of the Novaks put their minds to something, it was hard to stop them. They were a force of nature (except for Cas of course, who didn't like conflict).
"I cannot 'hurry up', Gabriel is going much too slow," Castiel huffed, twisting to shoot a look at his younger sister, which she met head on. While walking backwards, he held the staring competition for a few moments, until Michael interjected.
"One. My little brother Sammy. He's a freshman and the geekiest kid ever born." Dean rolled his eyes, running his hand through his hair.
Dean wished tonight wasn't Ellen and Bobby's 'date night' (they went to a indoor shooting range every other Friday), because that meant he was bringing Adam to Meg's house. Jo and Charlie had taken the opportunity to sneak out to a date of their own, so that left no one to watch Adam. He wasn't toilet trained yet, and Dean did not want to clean up his crap. Of course, Meg probably wouldn't like it. Which made it very satisfying.
"What?" Dean asked, turning to the dark haired boy and offering his hand.
Dean hadn't let him dodge out of his way and back into the hallway of kids where he could hide his face.
Anyway,
It was fairly basic, with red, nearly blood colored, walls, and a sectional separating the television area from the table. And then Castiel spotted the cluster of drinks-like, alcoholic drinks-on the corner of the table. He felt his stomach drop. Not only did it justify his wariness, it increased it. When Luci was drunk, he was ridiculous, and fifty times more dramatic than usual, which most people could barely believe possible. Michael became irresponsible, yet stricter at the same time (once, he had gotten so drunk that, for some reason, he decided to wander the streets telling people that free will was an illusion). Gabe just usually made sure that someone had dyed or missing hair by the morning, and that someone was mortally embarrassed. And Castiel really, really did not want to discover what drunk Anna was like.
"Tessa."
"I told you, that was a mistake. I meant to say Castiel, okay? It's a hard name," Dean snapped, focusing even harder on the road ahead of him. He clenched the steering wheel, fingers pale from the force of his grip.
He wasn't very good at reading people.
"You aren't getting detention this time, Mr. Winchester," Principal Mort said, a small smile spreading across his face. "Now, shoo." He waved a dismissive hand at the boy, as well as the Novaks, and returned to his pizza.
"Uh, what do those say?" Castiel asked tentatively, squinting at the blobs of black.
That was just great. Poor, poor Cas.
"...we got to 'em first." Probably Abbadon. "...the crap should be from us..."
"Meg and Anna are cuddling at the moment, so I don't think we need to worry about that. Michael and, uh, that other Novak are curled up with Adam, and Gabe, erm, passed out on my lap. He's a practical midget. Can you get me soon?"
Of course, Dean had accidentally ticked her off a year or two previous. Because common knowledge was for losers.
"Oh, okay-thanks I guess?" Castiel mumbled, allowing April to drag him along and seat him at the picnic table.
Holding his tea with both of his large hands he let out a sigh before turning slightly to face Rowena. “I have had Dean threaten me before, but never like this. Never so seriously. Never because of dad. I know he loves me and I know he loves you. But dad messed up his head. I guess I feel guilty. Dad was extra hard on him because he refused to let him hit me. He hides how messed up he is as if it makes him less of a man. I just want to punch him in his stupid face. But I also want to hug him until he stops feeling the need to get dad’s approval.” His head sinks as he uses one of his thumbs to gently rub against his cup.
“Girly magic? There is nothing girly about being a witch. Not that a Winchester gifted with the powers of a warlock would care. Witches are the most powerful beings to exist. I suggest you bite your tongue before I hex it.” Rowena glared at him before letting out a sigh. Her look seemed a bit softer as she released her magical grip on both Sam and Dean. “Let’s just go home. Your dinner is getting cold and we have work to do tomorrow.” She offered a smile at the boys as she reached out her hands, wanting them to take them. As each boy smiled and took one of her much smaller hands, purple flames engulfed them. Soon they were back in their old but fancy-looking cottage. It was just beyond the busy human filled village. Sam and Dean went into the village often but Rowena only ventured that far for work. Not all humans were very accepting of those who possess magical powers. Then again, most magical beings were the only thing that could take on another magic being. It was good for the village or the higher kingdom to possess allies.
Quickly getting to the edge of the forest, Dean cast illuminate so that he could keep a small ball of light near him. He couldn’t ride in blind. He may be rusty but he wasn’t stupid. There was no telling what kinds of creatures he would be found here. “Okay, Winchester. Get in. Find some freak. Get out.” Sisco was hesitant about going in but Dean forced him. He rode around in the near darkness for a while. Jumping at every little sound coming from the depths of the darkness surrounding them. He must have spent at least an hour or two without finding so much as a regular animal. suddenly from his right, he could hear what almost sounded like singing or humming. It was deep and clearly coming from a man. Dean couldn’t help but follow the sound of the angelic voice. Wanting, no, needing to be closer to whatever it was coming from. Dean felt drawn to it. Like some being was calling out to him specifically. Almost as if by name. As he and Sisco crept closer and closer to the being, Dean could almost make out what it was. He saw what looked like a bright blue light behind some trees. It wasn’t blue in the way water was. It was more like the soft but powerful blue of a flower. Delicate and beautiful but insanely powerful. He could now clearly hear the sound of a man humming to a song he didn’t recognize. The man’s voice was deep and slightly scratchy but it sounded absolutely amazing. It was almost like he could feel it inside of him. Like his heart could follow along with the humming. Dean’s eyes went wide as he kept going closer and closer. Trying to see what was creating the sound. But before he could see anything more than blue light, Sisco stepped on a stick. The stick loudly snapped in half sending out a loud crack. The humming stopped. Dean felt as if his heart stopped. The wind around him picked up and loud sounds surrounded them. As the light got brighter Sisco began to panic. The horse was bucking and freaking out, not knowing what to do... “No no no no! Sisco! Shh! Sisco, calm down buddy.” Dean begged. The horse wouldn’t calm down and Dean’s magic gave out sending them into the pitch-black forest without anything to give off light. The warlock was quickly thrown off the horse roughly. His head slammed against a tree. Blue light once again filling his vision before black crept around the edges. “Sisco…” He muttered once more before slipping into complete and total darkness. As darkness crept closer he felt the shooting pain in his head as he felt his head droop and his body go numb. Sisco was long gone. Everything was gone. Dean was gone.
Her pushed through the waiting room, ignoring Principal Mort's flustered assistant and stepped into the main office.
Dean snorted. "That girl doesn't have limits. Trust me. Last year, she and Jo got into one explosion of a fight–Meg had this dog that attacked her, and it wasn't pretty. You're lucky it was just Abbadon, Blue Eyes. She might be older, but Meg can be scrappy." Dean handed Castiel a pillow, helping him get more comfortable. "I'm supposed to drive you home soon–I accidentally left Adam at your house. Lucifer and Michael seemed to really like him." He chucked, then stood up, strolling to the kitchen. The sound of a sink faucet pouring water filled Cas's ears as he considered his situation.
After opening the cardboard box, he found another, smaller one, inside - which was weird as hell - and he took it out, getting annoyed with the heavy amount of paper around it. After struggling for a few seconds, he looked at the box design, and his face lit up. Taking it out, he admired the adorable keychain - a big head and a little gun on Han Solo's minuscule hand. Further down the original box, he glimpsed a card - on closer inspection, Dean noticed it was a store-bought birthday card for a 5-year-old birthday, which made him laugh uncontrollably - It read, "We only watched one Star Wars movie together, but Charlie reassured me you would like this. Plus, he looked just like you!"
"All right." Dean wrote the message as Sam went off to pay the bill, pretending he was going to the bathroom.
Everything set for the show on his end, Dean glimpsed Penny photographing the band behind the scenes for a while and shot her a wink. They've been on tour with this band for years, and she never shut up about having a crush on the lead singer, Taylor. Dean always flirted with her, ever since they met, and it became a joking habit when they grew closer after she joked about "playing for both teams".
Dean is up earlier than everyone else on the tour bus. The soft sunlight comes inside through the small windows while Dean shuffles around, finishing the last-minute travel preparations. He's already dressed, his coffee long taken, and his clothes are finally packed, not so neatly, in his bag.
-------------
"Something came this morning for you, kid.", Harry handed the parcel to a scruffy looking Dean, who had just woken up after finally being able to wrestle his body into sleeping in.
-------------
He finally emerged from a sea of bodies onto an ocean of people with signs carrying various names. Even though Sam was tall, it took him a while to find him but, alas, there he was, looking the same as ever.
"I'm drained, Dean. It's not important, we've been sharing bedrooms for months."
"You bonded? Over Coyote Ugly?" Dean said, incredulously. "Why? Is any of you going around dancing in bars all wet?" He thought that was a pretty good joke but they ignored him completely.
"Well, I better get going too then, happy captures!"
Grabbing a piece of paper, he scribbles some words and carefully leaves a small box near Cas' pillow where he is still sleeping. Dean takes a moment to take in his sweet features, "He looks like an angel when he's sleeping."
The text came a few hours later after Dean had driven well over 100 miles and thinking of going back home. The name" Cas" popped up before he could even read the message; he answered since he was already parked.
Astonished, Sammy asked, "Cas? Your co-worker Cas?"
"You didn't deserve that. I'm sorry about both your parents. But I am glad your family found you." Cas said, in the most sincere, kind tone Dean had ever heard.
Tickets in hand, he wandered over to the nearest board with all the scheduled departures. Michael had told him the check-in was taken care of, so all he had to do was figure out where to go. The board said his plane was on Terminal 1, and he tried his best to follow the endless signs, passing shop after shop, snack bar after snack bar.
"You replacing Nick?", Dean suddenly turns back to Castiel, sounding too eager. When Castiel stares clueless, Dean quickly explains, "Nick was the bass tech, he used to help me manage this station, I've been waiting for months for someone."
"Wait a minute. Is there something you want to tell me?"
Cas is very silent, but Penny keeps rambling on, about how they could get bi and lesbian flags and each carry one on the shoulder like a superhero cape. Charlie and Penny are joking around until Penny catches Cas' eye.
"It's at 6. I thought I was the new guy here." His voice is sleepy but mocking so Dean plays along.
"Hey!"
--------------
"Okay, thanks." He was clearly relieved. "I don't want to tell everyone. Not that I think anyone would be unaccepting or anything, but I don't think anyone needs to know. It's my personal life, you know? And I told you because you guys are so open about it and... well, this isn't a work setting."
"I don't know who that is."
Castiel noticed he must have done something wrong and said, "No. I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation. I'm sorry if I said something wrong." Dean was still taken aback but, upon seeing Castiel's face, he knew the guy wasn't bad after all.
"The new guy from work. He was the one who got me that.", he said - tilting his head towards the ring on his mother's hand, at the word that.
Going back to the venue, Charlie fills Dean in on today's errands. "Cas was supposed to come instead, but the show's almost over. He said he still got so much to do before Load-Off, felt a bit stressed, to be honest. I guess not having you around made him have a lot on his plate, huh?"
"That's... I'm glad you're doing that." Dean said with a faint but genuine smile.
"Really?? Wow. I actually love that feeling, it's so... calm and light. I love flying."
"I was just joking around. We're not telling anyone. It's not our place."
(I wanted to call it Girl Crush after Harry Styles' song but I guess it's more of a boy crush)
Also, I wish everyone a very happy Destiel wedding this week <3
This took immediate effect, as Sam stopped joking around, getting awkward instead. A smug expression revealed itself on Dean's face as he thought, "Yeah, you don't like it anymore when you're the one being mocked, huh?".
Yes, that last sentence is supposed to break you because this is how I am. I'll try not to add too much suffering because we had enough on the show. But next chapter we'll have some Sammy!
"If you want to wake up at 4 in the morning just to shower suit yourself."
"So... Is he dreamy? Does he have beautiful blue eyes?"
After spending a few hours at home and Sam leaving, Dean decided to go to his apartment - see how things were holding up. His afternoon was mostly wasted away going through boxes, looking into his own stuff. The only things carefully packed were his guitars - and he still felt bad for not using them anymore - the only livable room being his bedroom, albeit with only a functioning bed and wardrobe. Even though it was his, it didn't feel like a home - something was missing, and not just furniture or decor, it was something else. He decided to get something to eat on his way since he wanted to visit the cemetery before going out.
They walked outside the airport, Sam trying to help Dean with his single bag, which he refused. They immediately started to catch up, asking each other so many questions that it was hard to understand the answers.
Feeling more and more guilty, the girls try to justify it.
"He had a rough few days in the beginning but he came over to our room and we watched Coyote Ugly and we bonded over it."
"And we respect women in this house!"
The days went by, and not a week after Cas had called, Dean received a package.
Inside, Dean found the living room as cozy as it had always been. There were two leather loveseats on each side of the room, a modest piano in the corner, and a fireplace near one of the sofas. The place smelled of magnolia and honey, a comfortable fire burning calmy. Sam took Dean's stuff to his bedroom and came back, finding him sitting on the piano, surfing through the scores on the music rack.
And with that, he left, without even looking back at John's grave.
Dean pulls up at the restaurant's parking lot, where Sam is already waiting, leaning against his car. He parks in the vacant spot next to Sam and gets out of the car, grinning.
"But he's being very unfair. It's her job, and she likes it. So she should keep doing it."
Dean left his things in the guitar tech assigned dressing room and readily got to work, leaving Charlie to attend to her duties.
Softly she says, "Hey."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is this all that's left to do for tonight?"
Dean peered over with a skeptic frown, adding, "Yeah, but Ben's gonna love that one. And Mark? Has he seen his new bass?"
--------------
"What time is the flight, anyway? I didn't even see Michael today."
"He got a new friend. That's why he's home now." Harry said in a jovial manner.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Each time the guy says Roxanne, bottoms up."
"Fly. On a plane." ("Man, this dude can't possibly think I'm gonna grow wings and fly does he?"), Dean thinks. Castiel starts laughing in a warm, cute way that has Dean feeling butterflies, though he quickly gets disconcerted because he doesn't understand what Cas is laughing at.
"You know, Cas, for a dude watching pretty girls dance with minimal clothing, you're looking pretty serious there, pal."
Finally getting a good look at Dean, Castiel saw how his hair fell slightly on his face, how his shirt looked wrapped around his waist, how his muscles peeked through the thin sweater, and he was speechless for a solid minute. "Will you stop staring weird at me and do me the favor?"
--------------
Bobby asked about said friend - Dean replied he was finally replacing Nick, which made his job a lot easier. Sam told them about a co-worker he seemed to like, who they thought would be helping him in a new case. He said she was very smart, quite funny too - and the jokes about Sam having a crush ensued. Harry and Ruth hadn't been up to much - helping around in the community was usual - and the conversation shifted to Bobby.
"I see you've had your coffee."
Coming out of the bus, they found Penny sitting on the stairs of the nearest of the five parked trailers nearby. She waved at them, a small camera strapped on her shoulder as if it were a purse. She was wearing her signature crew jacket, even though it wasn't cold at all. As they approached, she took her earphones out, getting them tangled in the process. "Why don't you be a normal person and buy one of those wireless ones like everybody else?" She looked at Dean quickly, with an upset face, one he knew was half-real half-joking.
"I went to Russia once." he winked, stepping inside the white room.
"It's dad. He wants to know If we'll be home soon."
"Thanks for the gift ^-^". Dean smiled at Cas' text and replied right away.
"We're okay. We weren't last time I came here. But we are now. I thought you'd like to know that."
"Heya Charlie!" Dean approaches his best friend grinning, and gives her a bear hug.
"So, you wanna grab a coffee or something? Could use the company.", the suggestiveness was clear in his voice, and yet, Cas seemed not to pick it up. "I don't feel sleepy now." "C'mon, man."
Usually, the last day of a US leg meant it was the last day of work for Dean. This year, though, the band had a fair amount of concerts in Europe, mostly festivals, and the boys (and Taylor) asked Michael to keep some of this crew plus the new one overseas.
He went inside, immediately feeling the warmth of lighthearted chatter, realizing his last thought was wrong, and Bobby had, in fact, already made it.
"Yeah, alright."
Cas' eyes went wider, shooting up at Charlie, who didn't even notice him looking over as she kept rambling about their movie night.
"Oh, sorry. It was hard enough to be able to get you at the airport. They're not letting me have the afternoon off. Come on, I only have the backdoor key."
"I'm going to my room now."
"I know, I'm not upset about that... I'm gonna have to fly."
"Thought you'd read my notebook enough by now to know they're called PA."
"Wait, what?"
Sitting down, he told him about tour life and how hard it had been without Nick but how he managed to get some time now because Cas came along.
Dean's eyes shot up, a guilty look on them, wondering how his little brother knew Cas' eyes were as blue as the sky. He gets an amused smile as a response, and, watching Sam preparing himself to keep with the torment, immediately retaliated, "Oh, you're one to talk. How about Eileen? Your co-worker? Is she dreamy?"
The morning was spent fairly calmly, Dean helping his parents around the house, dancing from the kitchen to the garden like he was in a song.
"It's not that. I'm comfortable with my sexuality now, thanks. But I can't like Cas, dude. He works with me, we do everything together back there. It would ruin our friendship."
sorry i took so long to post, I was having a real hard time writing and feeling a lot of self-awareness about this chapter.
Still being teased all throughout the restaurant and into the table, Dean tries to change the subject, "What is this place? Fancy roadhouse or something?"
-------------
"Yes, I will take the month off, but I'll drive. Listen, man, it's not a big deal, just a couple of hours. And I like the music, I like the road, I'll be fine." Dean was rambling about how if he left early he would still be home for dinner when the last part of Michael's sentence suddenly hit him. "Wait... Europe?"
"Dean!" Cas recognized his voice but barely turned around to greet him, "I'd hug you, but I have to re-string these."
Dean walks past the trucks and sees the local crew ready to start unloading them. He finds the guitar area and gets ready to set everything up in its place. Starting to see some crew members pushing huge black plywood hard cases with aluminum sides, he rushed over and asked what they were carrying. "Amps" "That way", he pointed. Right after, two men were pushing a set of boxes, similar to the last one but a slightly different shape and division. They affirmed "Guitars", and Dean immediately took over them, pushing the box back to his area. Some other gear came around and he helped the crew members assort each box to its designated areas as fast as possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
After the hectic journey from the plane to the Arrivals at Kansas City Airport, Dean rejoiced for having a light travel bag.
"Well, the dad joined her dancing in the end."
"Of course. We won't tell anyone else."
"'M text..ing Casss" with such a warm smile, Sam felt sorry he was going to take his phone from him.
"I'm doing pretty good, still in the music biz. That's all I could ask for, right?" he's grinning as he says it, so she knows it's true, seeming happy to hear that.
"So... Been talking to any angels recently?"
Her serious expression has Dean smiling, thinking how much he missed his family.
The man came inside the living room, promptly hugging Dean. He was a short chubby man with a kind face and a gentle smile, pronounced by a few wrinkles, proper with his age.
hope everyone is doing well <3
"Hey! How's my girl?" Dean answered happily. Castiel saw a redheaded woman on the phone and felt bad for glancing over. He saw that she was very beautiful.
"OH MY GOD!"
He picked up the simplest guitar and laid it out as the one before.
He still drank the coffee, smiling through it.
Eventually, he sat down and spoke.
The sound came in loud - too loud - which made Dean reflexively separate his phone from his ear as far as his arm could manage. Even then, he could hear a happier version of I Want You To Want Me play in the background. Was Cas at a party? He heard a door slam and the sound fade as Castiel screamed over the music, "Dean?"
"Dean, does me walking like this seem to you I have the time to talk?", it comes out a bit aggressive but Dean's used to managers behaving like that since they're under a lot of pressure.
But Castiel is sound asleep on his side, the blanket barely covering him, curled up next to the still open journal Dean knew so well. He stops at the sight, smiling to himself and thinking how sweet it is that his journal has become Cas' light reading. Unable to help himself, he walked over to the opposite side of the bed, pulled the blankets over Cas, and tucked him in slightly so he wouldn't feel cold. Hearing his soft breaths, Dean couldn't help but to imagine what it would be like falling asleep to that sound (instead of the usual eighteen indistinguishable snores) every night.
"Where the hell are you?"
At first, Sam thinks he is joking. Upon looking at his brother's face, though, he understands he's actually worried about falling in love with this guy.
"Maybe you just have too small ears." Cas didn't even realize he was taking Dean's side until Penny looked at him with an exaggerated glance of betrayal. They continued fighting over, this the way friends do, when Penny started rolling a cigarette. Dean asked if she wanted to grab some coffee with them after smoking, and he noticed Taylor, the lead singer, coming out of her trailer behind Penny. He didn't mention it to her since they were already bantering, and he didn't need to add any more fuel to the fire. Taylor looked around, taking a cigarette of her own from a pack, right from the pocket of her shirt. She looked for a lighter but, realizing she wasn't carrying one, looked over at the group. Penny was still chatting with the boys, waiting for her, her lighter in one hand, which caught Taylor's eye. She went over to ask for light and lingered on, asking Penny for some photo stuff from earlier. Dean and Cas saw this as a good opportunity to leave them alone, playing a little matchmaking. They excused themselves politely and headed to the coffee area, giggling halfway there.
He took the chance to text Castiel too, "Thanks for the gift. I'm gonna get you one of baby Yoda. He looks just like you, too."
Dean smiles triumphantly, showing off his new gift like a child on Christmas, "Yeah! Cas sent it in the mail."
Dean thinks of Nick, a funny guy who loved the job, not so much it seemed... "He went off to live with his partner."
"Well... does this mean my dad is gonna come out as gay too?
Cas squints his eyes as if their efforts to defend the movie choice were completely unnecessary to him.
Dean felt content, even with his natural morning crankiness. Harry was coming from the backdoor, cheery as ever, wearing overalls and bringing an assortment of garden tools inside. You could see how much he liked being in the garden from the condition it was in. Some would even think the decor was Ruth's doing, but it was all his work.
"Hey! Come on, there's nothing wrong with it." - he puts a hand on his brother's shoulder, trying to comfort him - "You've had boyfriends before. Mum and dad know about it, and they will always support you. I mean, you heard mum teasing you about Cas, so what's the problem?"
"Heya, Sammy!"
Castiel is making his way through the hotel lobby, back from his city endeavors on the first day off on tour. As he reaches the elevator, he finds Charlie and Penny coming from the Buffet. He waves: though he spent part of the day with them, he hadn't seen them in a few hours because he wanted to explore the city.
Garth whispers, "You're gonna have to drive tonight. He's going with whiskey."
Cas receives the key while Dean tries to protest. "Wait. Double room? There must be a mistake."
"He seems lovely, honey. You getting along well, then?". He noticed a hint of curiosity, the same as when he had his first boyfriend.
This chapter mentions drinking.
"I'm Castiel"
He finally drove back home, but the songs weren't really helping. He saw himself forced to change to some stupid radio station, and even then, every song was romantic. Eventually, he gave up, driving in silence, trying to hum some Metallica and cursing the fact he had only brought a Zepp tape with him.
"I didn't say anything!" she added defensively, a smile in the corner of her mouth.
He had to calm himself a little before driving, Cas' voice still tingling in his ear. He felt exactly as the first time he thought of kissing a boy, back in the summer of '94, and just like then, he felt wrong. "Fuck... I can't like Cas. He's my co-worker. I can't do that. And he's straight. Stop it, Dean." Thinking he's a hot piece of ass, or as Penny likes to say it: "piece of the bad pathway" was one thing, another totally different was developing an actual crush on him. Sure, he thought he looked like an angel when he was sleeping, but that doesn't mean anything. The guy's named after an angel, what's he supposed to think?
"Is it not enough? If you hadn't arrived, I probably wouldn't be able to do it."
Castiel starts helping Dean out, he has visibly had some experience before even though Dean has to help him in a few things and correct him in others, which is normal because every band is different.
"What, you're not coming with?" Dean replied, frowning.
Castiel glanced at where Dean was, already getting his hands dirty, while admiring the new instrument.
"I thought you wanted to see your family. Plus, you should really get some rest, Dean."
"What?" Dean stops in his tracks to look back at his brother's suggestive face. "Oh, c'mon, man... Not you too."
"Exactly."
Dean comes back from the stage and they wait until soundcheck is over to go get something to eat. In the bar area, they find Penny again, who Dean introduces to Castiel. "Hey, Penny! This is Cas, he's the new bass tech. Cas, this is Penny, the photographer." Castiel greets her in a friendly manner and notices Dean called him... Cas? He likes it, it's good to know he's making a good impression on his new co-worker.
As they walked up the minuscule stairs, Cas' hand still tugging at Dean's elbow, he couldn't help but feel his heart being seized by the intrusive thoughts of Cas' warmth near his own body. Castiel opened the wooden door drowsily, revealing the bedroom within. It was only big enough to fit the double bed, a wall-mounted TV and a small desk, having a bathroom tucked on one side.
"Dancing. Hot."
Reluctantly, Castiel stored the magazine under his pillow and came down from the bunker. He hoped Dean didn't understand the way he was staring at him was purely sexual but, then again, would a straight guy even wonder about that? He'd probably just find it weird.
"Gotta go. I'm meeting Sammy."
The Band Manager is a simple, sociable man, who hired Cas through a friend. He was talking with Alejandra and Frank (Production Manager) at the left end of the cafeteria when he saw Castiel. "Hey! You got my message."
Glancing back at the passenger seat, he added, "Listen, I'm not going to tell him. It's just a crush. It'll go away soon."
After walking around for what seemed like thirty minutes, Dean finally found Cas in the bus eating a PB&J on the top bunker. Since Cas first came on the tour, there were only a couple of bunkers available one of them right on top of Dean's, which he offered right away. He figured Cas was a quiet guy, and he missed the company of sharing a bedroom. Though, when you're on tour on a bus, you don't have much privacy anyway.
“Sorry, Rowena…” Sam muttered quietly.
Silence fell over the table. The happy family meal turned into something else. Both boys looked down and stopped eating. Sam is currently eighteen while Dean is twenty-two. Their father had been locked up when they were ten and fourteen. Their mom died when Sam was just a baby and for the entire ten years after that their father had been an abusive asshole who had taken up being a criminal. Forcing Sam and Dean to steal for him whenever their little hands would work better than his own. John had been the non-magical parent of the two but that didn’t stop him from making demon deals to add to his rage. To add to his list of illegal activities. Sam wanted nothing to do with him. As far as he was concerned, Dean was his parents for those ten years and Rowena was his parent for the eight after that. But Dean’s story was different. He longed for his mother and longed for his dad to be proud of him. He had taken the worst of his dad’s abuse. Not only that but he had taken all of the manipulation his dad threw his way. While he hated the old bastard he couldn’t help but fall into that life. To be his daddy’s blunt little instrument.
“Hey! Don’t be putting ideas in his head! I would like to stay un-hexed.” Dean huffed.
Both boys were losing their heads. Screaming at each other. Thinking about throwing punches and throwing magic.
“Where is Sammy? Typical of him to not give a fuck about showing up to see his dad. The kid has gotta be what? Eighteen now? Probably thinks he is better than seeing his own father. Damn freaks filling his head with things.” Dean looked his father over. Seeing his mess of dark hair and overgrown facial hair. The look on his face could kill someone from a mile away. “I don’t know what you have been doing for the past decade but you better be out hunting. Just like I showed you. Hunting those damn things in that forest. Because I am going to get out of here. I am going to get out and I don’t need some damn pushover who is too scared to go after the things that killed your damn mother.” John had become a criminal so he would be able to pay for weapons to go after mythical creatures in the dark forest. Mythical creatures in any forest. After his wife, Mary, died from an illness that he was convinced was a curse, he had been obsessed with hunting. Hunting down every last thing he could. He hated that Dean ended up having magic, but soon realized he could weaponize him to kill more freaks.
“Hi, dad…” He says with a small voice. The normal happy sounding and egotistical Dean Winchester was long gone.
Rowena and Sam just look at each other sadly. Dean had a horrible attachment to his father. An unhealthy one that was deeply rooted inside of him. Despite Rowena’s best efforts to parents him and undo the abuse that was done, raising an abused teenager was much harder than raising and comforting a frightened ten-year-old. She was able to bond with Sam through magic and many other things. He was a bright kid and it didn’t take long for him to open up. Dean refused to come out of his room most days. Refusing to eat. Being overly protective of Sam for a while. It took years for Rowena to get close to him. She gave him his space, knowing all too well what kind of demons were running wild inside of his head. With a pleading look at Rowena, Sam gestured to Dean’s room. She just smiled sadly before nodding.
Sam waved his arm causing the other man’s legs to sweep out from under him. He fell backward with a thump before shooting a glare to the spell caster. “Which one of us is the one on their ass, Dean?” Sam said smugly. Before Dean could throw magic back at Sam, a red-headed woman appeared from a puff of smoke.
Setting down both of their cups, Rowena turns to Sam and presses a hand to his cheek. He leans into it and smiles softly. After the years of abuse, he always loved the soft motherly gestures Rowena gave him. “Dean has things to work out. If he needs to see John to work those things out then that is what he has to do. He loves both of us. He loves you more than you could imagine. Whenever he leaves, no matter what he leaves for, you just need to have faith that he will be back. You wouldn’t leave either of us for anyone. Certainly not for a low life like John Winchester.” They once again sat in silence. Although this time the silence was nice. A happy silence with knowing glances. “Best go get some rest, dear. We have a lot to do in the morning. Dean needs us to be strong while he works through things. You two are the most stubborn boys I know. If he needs us we will be there.” She says softly before slightly snapping and saying, “Bed.”
Before speaking, Dean put his hands up defensively. “Sorry, Rowena. We know the rules. Just trying to teach Sam some less girly magic. Him being the only witch who isn’t a chick.” He laughed slightly before realizing this would only anger her further.
The next day the three magical beings ran around each other trying to get things ready for work. Trying to get everything together and loaded into their carriage. Dean and Rowena loaded the carriage while Sam hooked up their horse, giving him a few apples while brushing his mane. “Hurry up stable boy. Sisco’s gotta get up into town.” Dean said as he hopped into the carriage with the rest of their stuff. Rowena came out in her fancy dress with her bag. She pulled herself up to the front so she could help steer Sisco in the right direction despite him knowing exactly how to get into the village. Sam gave the horse a couple of gentle pats before hopping in next to Dean. The village wasn’t too far away but the ride there was a bit long. Sam and Dean sat in awkward silence for most of it. Neither wanting to talk about or apologize for the night before. Eventually, Dean caved in and muttered a small “sorry.” without really looking at Sam. As angry as Sam was, he knew he couldn’t blame Dean. They had different feelings towards their father. How much harm could John do from one talk?
Dean hummed slightly while tapping his leg a bit. “Okay, Sammy.” It was a simple reply but Sam could hear the emotion in it. Within the next couple of minutes, they made it into town. Sam helped Rowena and Dean booked it to the prison.
He doozes like that, the setting sun hitting his back and making him feel warm and comfortable despite the ledge of the frame digging into his body and the noises from the kitchen lulling him in. It’s perfect. It’s what’s been missing all these months.
Being ambushed by Jo and Charlie at 10 AM to go dress shopping for Garth’s wedding was in fact not on the list.
“And I don't want you sleeping somewhere else, so guess we have to find a middle ground here.” His voice comes out muffled and Cas's sigh brushes along his ear, makes him shiver. Cas's hold on him tightens.
Cas [11:59 AM]: Still mad at you though.
"The roads were a little busy," Cas says offhandedly, while he hangs up his coat and Dean has to force his eyes away, has to stop himself from letting them linger on the way Cas's button-up hugs his arms oh so nicely. There's laughter from the living room.
Cas hums on his end of the line and then he finally must reach his hotel room, because the background noise stops completely, leaving just some quiet sniffling and the rustling of probably a coat and scarf being taken off. The vivid image of his flushed cheeks and wind-ruffled hair, make Dean press his hands into the dough a little harder.
“And it’s something he can keep and hold onto until you’re back. He’ll like that.”
Though maybe he doesn't have to mend bridges today. Because this shouldn't be about him. The damn kid understands this less than he does. So let him be pissed at him, let him be sad, even if it's painful for both of them. Maybe Dean even deserves his anger. Maybe he is at fault for making Cas say no and the break-up, even if he doesn't know what he missed or where he went wrong. Maybe Dean simply asked too much of him.
Dean [10:15 PM]: This isn’t your fault, Cas.
"I'd love that." And yeah. He definitely just brought his best friend, the man he's fucking in love with, to tears. Real fucking smooth.
“You’re disgusting.” Sam makes a face before he sobers up again. “But seriously, you two are good?” “Yes, Sammy. And it’s already decided anyway so you trying to make me feel bad about staying, isn't going to happen. Let's just enjoy lunch and then go our separate ways until Sunday, alright?”
Bobby makes a noise that falls somewhere between a chuckle and disagreeing huff. “Yes, a brown pickup, kid.”
“Ah.” Dean laughs, can’t help it. He rubs his chin. “I actually talked to Cas already. Yesterday.”
“Oh yes, I’m sorry! I didn't have time to read it yet,” Cas says and Dean lets his head drop backwards in silent relief. “I will during the weekend though.”
Dean [9:03 AM]: No breakfast then.
“Are you going with someone?”
“Ketchup?”
— but the smile on his face is still genuine. “Old habits die hard, huh?”
He naps for a few more hours on the couch until Miracle licks through his face, demanding her morning walk and he has to give in and get up.
“Of course.”
Because he’s here, isn’t he? Cleaning up after his father, making sure he doesn’t overexert himself, that he gets to his appointments on time and eats proper, mostly healthy meals, and has everything he could need or ask for right there under his nose without too much effort. Oh and of course so that he isn’t alone throughout this whole stroke recovery process and has an emotional support system within arms reach that he can turn to whenever he pleases.
And Dean drops his head forward, can't help the short laugh bubbling out of his throat. This. This is what was missing, what he could've used at any point in the weeks since this mess kicked off. And he'll get to rejoice in it, take a hot second just for himself to enjoy this. Just as soon as they've gotten Sammy fixed up.
And oh, there it is. The other shoe finally dropped, after weeks of
“Sorry,” Dean bites out but tries forcing his scowl into a more neutral frown. Considering how unimpressed Bobby looks, he’s not doing a good job. “Had a rough night.”
He opens his mouth to say something — except he has no idea what — when Cas looks back towards him, eyes flicking down and something akin to recognition flashes over his face.
“Can we please not do this tonight?”
“And he didn't even text you?”
“Then yes, water is okay.” He straightens back up and reaches for the remote to turn on the TV more out of habit than the need for it. Out of the corner of his eyes, he watches Cas place both their glasses on the coffee tables, watches how he settles down next to him. “I’m sure you’d find a way to convince me. You always have before.”
Dean [8:01 AM]: Ah. You miss me.
________
The whole house is a little more lived-in now that his father is not just bound to mostly staying downstairs anymore. Despite that upstairs is still mostly Dean’s space. For whatever reason, his father seems to be fine with keeping his bedroom on the first floor and Dean would care more about it if it didn’t come with the added privacy. But it also means his father won’t lift a finger up here — not that he does much cleaning downstairs either. Or maybe Dean is just too impatient to wait him out.
On the surface, it was an okay day not much different from others. He went to work in the morning — spent more time in the office than with his hands on a car though because Bobby figured he could use his ‘college brain’ for once — he had lunch with Charlie at the gaming cafe and then bought himself a few new shirts — he’s no closer to figuring out how to go about getting his stuff — before treating himself to some pie and coffee because why the hell not.
"You're staying here." It sounds much more accusatory than he wants it to. Dean wishes he'd just kept his mouth shut, let him leave instead of making things worse. Sometimes - most times - that's just easier anyway.
Dean takes a deep breath, opens the trunk fully again and turns to stare into it. The trench coat is lying there, still bundled up the same way it was before. Not folded properly just wrapped up around itself and untouched since it's been put there. It's become a familiar sight, has found its home in his car. And he doesn't really want to disturb that, which taking it – touching it – would most definitely. Leaving it here, leaving it and him behind feels wrong though.
Sam [10:45 PM]: If you do want to talk, we're here.
Dean nearly knocks his glass over, feels the water spill over the sides and onto his fingers and the top of the bar. He blinks down at the mess before he looks up at Jo. She looks far too amused. “No, I haven’t.”
“I haven't told my father you're coming.” The words rush out of Dean along with his breath and he holds it, tries gauging Cas's reaction. But it doesn't come beyond his frown deepening. So he continues, “Well I kind of did through text while I was waiting for you. I was scared he'd say no to you staying over.”
Garth is standing there, holding out a knife - one of theirs, must have dropped from his pocket during the fight. He takes it.
“You know you’ll have to use words while talking as well, right?” Charlie says and her smile’s a little smaller now, almost fond. “But if you write them you don't have to give him the first draft. You can like, think about what you want to say. And rethink it. And no one's going to interrupt or distract you. Especially not him with his pretty face.”
Dean [3:30 PM]: No promises.
Dean [2:34 AM]: Sweet dreams, your highness.
But apparently working at Bobby's garage, waiting tables, and running after Oliver two to three times a week, have given him back his old glory. Who would have guessed? Certainly not him. Certainly not the junk food that he still has all over his kitchen — he learned a lot about eating healthy while cooking for his father and he’s keeping some of it up. But he’s not a monster. He can still appreciate the perfection of greasy pizza or a well-stacked burger and he’ll do it without a second thought.
Maybe it’s because he desperately wants to ask him to stay but knows that Cas is stuck in Boston until he finishes his PhD because that’s how things are and there’s too much money involved, too much of Cas's hard work, for Dean to even be allowed to utter that question without the barrier of at least a few states and a phone call between them. Because there’s no way he’d survive the rejection otherwise. Because there’d be no way for Cas to let him down easy when he shouldn’t be getting ideas in the first place.
Dean [6:07 PM]: He’ll bring you my key as well, so you don’t get into trouble whenever you move out.
Dean grins at her while he takes the cup she gently pushes in his direction. He knows it does nothing to cover up how pale he looks, how dark the circles underneath his eyes are. “Better?”
"It's fine. Very interesting but I don't think I'll be able to use much of my newly collected knowledge for my work."
"Cas?" He clicks the safety back on, drops the gun to the side, and scrambles towards him. The blanket is still caught around his legs and he nearly falls headfirst to the floor. "Cas."
He slumps forward, feels the dirty floor bite into his palms and knees as he crawls towards Cas. His hand hovers over his shoulder - his own tingles with phantom pains of a scar long gone - and then he touches and pulls. Cas' head lolls to the side, towards Dean, and their eyes meet. Except they don't, there's no one staring back at him. Just emptiness but blue.
Warnings: John having another stroke, mentions of the moment when John hurt Dean, just a lot of emotions really
The cookie he's trying to pick up gets smushed under his fumbling fingers and he hangs his head, presses his lips together. Tries to not just burst out and say it. It's not the place and not even close to the right time. He's just overly emotional, because of this whole thing, a severe lack of sleep, too much fresh air, and not enough substantial food besides raw cookie dough. He has to think about this rationally. Not joking, still doesn't mean that he meant it like that. Like Dean would have meant it. There's just no way.
Cas [10:03 PM]: Are.
Dean grins and wanders over. “What’s up, buddy?”
He rocks him like a child you sooth from a nightmare, clings to him like he is the only thing that's left. Except the nightmare didn't end when the darkness disappeared. It only began and it won't ever end again.
. He gets an elbow to the side in return. But by the way, Cas is looking at him, he’s not that far off. For the kid’s sake, Dean adds, “What do you two think about hot chocolate?”
“But I won't not have sex with you.”
It's a road he usually does not go down, tries to avoid at all cost because what good does pining over his best friend ever do? Nothing. That's the answer. Always has been, always will be. Sure he's had a few moments where he considered doing something about it, thought hard about taking action, and then threw it back into the pits of hell because why would he when everything was fine. This way he has Cas. Every other way he might not.
Dean nods, teeth grinding and Cas's presence loud where he can still see him standing in the kitchen from the corner of his eye.
Dean’s breath hitches. “Did you now?”
Dean [2:29 PM]: The answer is yes.
Kind regards
But he keeps quiet. And Cas steps outside.
"Yeah, I do," he breathes, barely audible.
“I'd ask you who you've slept with to get that deal but different states and all that.”
The unsettling feeling of panic is there in an instant. Dean feels the edges of his phone digging into his palm. He straightens up. Fuck he should have known. He’s setting himself up for disappointment and he’s apparently not even subtle about it. “I’m not.”
“Thank you,” Cas says, like being allowed to take care of him is something special, and steps away into the kitchenette.
Still, it had left him with a sour taste in his mouth and dread settling in his stomach. Like he’d done something wrong. Like he’d betrayed his own values or something. Which he didn’t.
“Nightstand.” Dean doesn’t make a move, eyes focused on Cas stepping closer and placing his phone down, even going as far as plugging it into the charger. There’s a piece of paper sticking to it and Dean considers asking about it. But he feels sleep drag at the edges of him, so he just closes his eyes and mumbles, “Thank you.”
