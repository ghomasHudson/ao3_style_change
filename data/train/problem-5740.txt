Peter nods and tries to speak, but only a small sob comes out. Tony holds him tighter, comforting him with soft words. He can feel Natasha’s eyes on him, but he doesn’t turn her way.
Tony stays between Steve’s spread legs, quickly reaching for another towel when Steve pushes again. It takes another two pushes before the afterbirth is passed. Steve pants and tips his head back.
Steve shakes his head and runs his hand along the smooth rail of the crib. “No. This is all new to me. My ma didn’t have a theme or any of this,” Steve explains, waving his other hand around the space.
“Are you kidding? I can’t wait to have another baby. Peter and Dodger are going to be amazing big brothers.”
“Maybe,” Tony replies. “She definitely noticed that first night you were gone. It was difficult but we eventually figured it out. I don’t know if you want to try breastfeeding again…”
The nursery is finally complete and all of the items Steve received for his baby shower have a home and are neatly put away. There was only a few weeks left until he’d be welcoming his baby boy, and there was still more that needed to be done.
It’s late when Steve is jolted awake. He lets out a groan from being disturbed from the decent night of sleep he’s gotten in a while. Peter hadn’t fussed like he usually does and their night together was a lot calmer than what they have been. Steve rolls over onto his back and listens, ears straining for the familiar sound of Peter’s cries. But no sound comes through the baby monitor.
Peter finds himself in the bathroom, huddled around the toilet bowl and staring at the bit of breakfast he consumed. He gags again and lurches forward, emptying his stomach for the third time that morning.
“What did you do?” Steve asks. When he doesn’t get an immediate response he shouts, “What did you do!”
Steve smiles sadly at his husband and gently runs his fingers through his soft, dark hair. “I guess it’s getting bad now, huh?”
His outburst only makes the situation worse. That fear Tony had is creeping up on him again. All he can think about is getting his daughter in his arms.
Steve tosses and turns, head rolling from side to side and fingers twisting into the cotton sheets. His chest is rising and falling heavily, breathy pants leaving his slightly parted lips. His heart pounds in his chest, the organ close to bursting through.
“Can you...if you can...I mean…” Steve sighs, internally screaming at himself for being an incompetent mess. Who knew having a baby could change so much? “Can you stay with me?” Steve asks, finally finding his voice.
“Yes!” Steve beams proudly and scoops Peter into his arms, hugging him close and kissing his cheek. “Petey, you did it! I’m so proud of you.”
He spots Peter standing outside a room and his stomach twists at the sight of Natasha. She’s hugging Peter and telling him something Tony doesn’t hear, then she’s glancing up and her piercing green eyes are locking with his. She pulls away from Peter and he sits down in one of the provided chairs.
“I’m surprised to see you here,” Bruce says and he walks over to stand in front of Tony. He folds his arms over his chest as he looks Tony over. “You look like-”
“And then-” Steve chokes back a sob and the tears in his eyes roll down his face. “I had a little girl. She-she looked so much like my mother. I named her Sarah. I swear I tried to protect her.”
“Tony,” Steve shakes his head with a sigh and pushes himself off the couch to go in search of his missing husband.
He finds it on the next thrust, forcing a scream from Tony’s throat and causing his back to arch off the bed. Witnessing Tony take pleasure because of his doing brings Steve closer and closer to the edge.
“Wait,” Peter stops his uncle from going any further when a picture captures his attention. “I remember this,” he smiles and peels back the protective film to take the photo into his hands. “He let me wear his helmet sometimes and I’d pretend to be Captain America. We’d play for hours.”
“Did he ever keep them?” Tony asks. Peter peers up at him, noticing the tears in his dad’s eyes. He hadn’t seen him cry, and wondered if he’d ever see it.
“Dad?” Peter’s soft voice captures Tony’s attention and he looks over his shoulder to find his son standing at the top of the stairs. Peter comes down toward him. “What are you doing?”
“You guys couldn’t behave for like ten minutes?” Peter raises a questioning brow at his parents. When both remain silent, he rolls his eyes and makes his way toward the stairs, only to stop when he’s called back to the dining room.
Taking down the first two men goes smoothly, but when the next three are coming for him, Steve is caught off guard when the pain in his stomach returns. It’s stronger this time.
Pierce cries out when Steve grips him hard by his hair and slams his face forward, his broken nose spilling more blood. The alpha continues to fight against the leather straps keeping him in place.
Steve sees nothing but red. He grips the alpha tightly and forces him toward the bench. He manipulates Pierce in the humiliating position he had been forced into multiple times.
“I see the way you are with our pups and how much you love them. But it’s the way you’re beginning to love yourself that I notice a little more. You’ve been to hell and back and you’ve got the scars to prove it, but it’s amazing how much progress you’ve made. I could never have done it. I might be an alpha and you're an omega, but I look up to you. I want to follow you.”
He loosens the tie around his neck, freeing himself from the restriction and gulping down air into his lungs. His stomach hurts and he wants to throw up. Now that he’s alone, he lets it all out.
Peter doesn’t protest when he’s placed on the soft carpet. As soon as the television is turned on, all of his attention is on it.
As promised here is the moment when they finally mate. They're growing closer and Steve is finally starting to feel loved. Poor thing has suffered enough as it is. Anyway, thank you so much for being patient with me and for being so supportive. I love you all!
Steve didn’t know the first thing about raising a pup. He only knew how to carry them and eventually birth them. After that there was no reason for him to stick around. Hydra made sure he was kept away. The pups didn’t belong to him.
“Almost there,” Steve grins and he rubs his hand over Tony's large belly, hoping the touch would coax their son to kick. It was late and they both should be asleep by now, but he couldn’t go to sleep without talking to their son first. It was irritating to Tony. He was always accusing Steve of waking Peter up. “Hi, Petey,” Steve coos, trailing his hand over the bump until it’s resting over the spot where their son is.
Tony rips into the present, his curiosity winning over. He peels the paper away to reveal a wooden picture frame, and inside the frame is a sketch of himself. It’s of him down in the lab, working hard on another one of his projects. The sketch is detailed, as if Steve had taken his time to achieve as much realism as possible.
He loses the fight and finds himself drifting off. It’s not until someone is shaking his shoulder does Steve’s eyes shoot open with a gasp. One glance down shows his son on the verge of falling asleep.
“I don’t want to rush you. I’ll wait if I have to. I just...there’s something here, Steve. I want to be near you all the time. And I don’t know, maybe it’s my alpha wanting to protect you, but I don’t think that’s the only reason.”
Those words make Steve’s stomach churn. He doesn’t want to be a part of Hydra anymore. He doesn’t want to bear pups or be punished anymore. He doesn’t want to hurt anyone else.
Being a heavy sleeper was something Tony never really considered himself to be. He didn’t get the normal amount of sleep a human being was supposed to get, and even if he did sleep, it wasn’t for very long. Being interrupted from sleep didn’t bother him. So when he’s awoken by FRIDAY’s alert, it doesn’t even faze him.
Tony is left panting when Steve breaks the kiss. He watches intently as Steve works his belt open, their connected gaze never breaking. There’s a smirk forming over Steve’s lips once he has the belt undone and Tony’s jeans unbuttoned. Steve doesn’t waste anymore time in freeing Tony’s cock and wrapping his lips around the head.
“I don’t need a reminder,” Tony retorts and downs the drink, not even grimacing from the intense and fiery taste.
Steve leads Tony out of the room and toward the elevator. He keeps a close eye on his husband, ready to catch him again if he were to fall. It’s not until they’re stepping through the front door of their apartment does Tony make a beeline for the guest bathroom. Steve rushes after him.
Tony moves closer to be near his little family. He wraps them in his arms, holding them close. It was a promise that he’d never let them go.
Steve doesn’t protest this time and he allows Tony to lead him back to their bedroom. The moment Steve’s head hits the pillow, he’s drifting off to sleep. Tony curls up beside him, making sure this time to wait for Steve’s permission to touch him. He’s granted that consent and he smiles.
“Eh.” Tony moves toward the coffee and takes the mug Steve left out for him. “Pete didn’t keep me up, thank God. But my back is killing me. Maybe you can rub it later.”
And that was fine. Tony was tired and too old to be flying around and fighting aliens or whatever the hell decided to invade Earth. The past 15 years have been the worst. He didn’t just lose himself during that time, he lost Iron Man too.
Steve doesn’t respond, not that Tony was expecting him to. Tony sighs heavily and leans down to kiss him on the head, then he gives him some space.
The one he’s living now was a step in the right direction. He had a mate who loved him, four beautiful pups, and a second chance to find his place. It was time to take that final step.
Bruce hands her a tissue and she wipes away at her eyes, but the tears keep falling, her makeup smearing. Pepper obviously didn’t care what she looked like. She was usually more put together, she had to be as the new CEO, but now she didn’t care about any of that. Her best friend was dead.
“Yeah. He is acting differently. And I don’t remember him owning anything like that. Unless Steve really was okay with it.”
It’s all a lie. Steve was far from okay. Tony didn’t even know half of the pain his husband was going through. All he wanted was for Steve to open up to him, let him in and express what he was feeling. Tony was doing everything he could to help, but it was impossible to do when he was left in the dark.
Steve whimpers when Tony bites and sucks along his neck. He clenches tightly around Tony’s cock, the pressure sending jolts of pleasure through Tony. It’s been too long since they’ve fucked like this. The last time Tony remembers had been before the-
Tony peers up at Steve when he hears him sniff. Steve’s a wreck, his eyes giving away just how much pain he’s really in. Tony wants to comfort him too, but he needs to get his daughter somewhere else first.
Steve shakes his head again, then he sniffs. He’s crying; it’s heartbreaking to see. Tony thought these days were behind both of them. Steve was supposed to be happy now, at peace on his road to recovery. But perhaps it wasn’t as cleanly paved as Tony thought it would be. The road was going to have some bumps along the way.
He’s the one forced to end their embrace when he picks up on soft whimpers coming from the vehicle. He turns his head toward the sound, a soft whine escaping him as the need to be near his pups grows stronger. Pepper senses this immediately and lets him go, watching with curious eyes as he helps a little boy out from the backseat.
Steve props himself up on his elbows and Tony crawls between his legs again, their lips meeting in another passionate kiss. Steve sits up to quickly discard his shirt, a pink hue spreading across his upper half and even higher until even the tips of his ears are bright red.
“Is it?” Steve quirks a brow at him. He joins Tony on the bed, crawling over until he’s hovering right above him. “You want me to beg, Stark?”
Steve nods and glances down at his lap again. He wrings his hands together. His nervous energy only makes Tony feel worse. A strange thought enters his mind. He wonders if this is the omega Pepper said he had been chasing at the party.
He’s about halfway done with the dishes when he hears Steve come in. The soft sound of his feet against the floor is difficult to ignore, especially since it’s a sound he’s been waiting for. He turns right when Steve enters the kitchen, and sends his husband a smile.
“What about what he did to Steve?” Bucky adds. “To all of us? We were supposed to be a team and he left.”
“Yeah,” Tony shoots Steve a small smile, then he leaves the room. He makes sure to slip the sweatshirt on before going downstairs, inhaling the familiar scent of the omega. It makes his alpha side happy. “Huh. Maybe this would be better on Steve,” he says to himself.
Steve’s face lights up and he takes the paper she offers to him, his smile growing at the sight of the perfect grade on top.
The doctor’s words ring loudly in his ears, but Steve can’t bring himself to listen to them. He glances down at his lap, one hand wrapping around his belly. It tightens painfully, pulling a gasp from his lips. Tony’s taking his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze.
Peter thinks it over, frowning as he tries to decide. “I think you should be Captain America forever. I want to be...Spider-Man!”
“I’m going to fix this. I made a promise to keep Steve and the baby safe. So far I think I’ve done a pretty good job.”
“If you don’t want to tell me then that’s fine, but I just want you to know that you don’t need him for this. If he doesn’t want to take responsibility then that’s on him. You still have me, your father and Ned.”
The giddiness is back in an instant. The special occasion Tony was speaking of could only mean one thing. Steve doesn’t ask, knowing better than to question Tony’s plans.
The doctor isn’t his usual doctor, doesn’t even come close, but he would have to do. Steve doesn’t even look up at him when he mentions getting Steve something for pain. It wouldn’t matter. Nothing could truly take away the pain he was feeling.
Steve turns back to the three pups huddled on the bed and slowly makes his way toward them. The oldest growls and tries to keep his siblings away from the strange omega coming toward them. It’s painful to witness his children so afraid of him and for them to not recognize who he is.
“What is this time? Because the pickled onions and ice cream was disgusting.” Tony can’t help but shudder at the memory.
“I’m not gonna stand here and tell you you’re wrong or he’s wrong. He’s not even here to defend himself. But, Tony, that’s the past and this is now. So what are you gonna do? Yell at your computer and throw cups around? Did it even help?”
Yay Steve managed to escape! I guess Hydra and Pierce should've done a better job at keeping him contained since he's already attempted an escape before. Oh well. At least Steve is away from that horrible place. Now I wonder who he's going to bump into ;)
“I love you so much,” Tony whispers. Tears gather in his eyes and he struggles to hold them back. He needs to be strong. “You can get through this. You’re amazing. You’re strong. Keep fighting okay? And don’t forget how much Morgan and I love you.”
Peter turns away when his eyes fill with tears. A sob builds in his chest and he tries his hardest to fight it. He can’t cry again. He’s supposed to be strong.
He wishes Pepper could be on his arm right about now, but she was caught up with work that couldn’t be delayed. He should've given her the night off so that she could tag along and be bored with him.
Steve studies himself one last time in the mirror before giving up and deciding to return back to his family. Sooner or later Tony was bound to notice, and that was the last thing Steve needed.
Steve smiles sadly. “Yeah. I wish she was still here. I guess we’re both alike in some ways. She sacrificed her life to care for others and I...I guess I did the same.”
“I want that. Steve, I want that so fucking much.” Tony ignores the bitter scent and rushes toward Steve, taking the omega’s hands in his own. “I love you. I do.”
Steve smiles and climbs into bed, his heart fluttering when Peter curls up against him and lays his head on his chest.
“What time is it?” Steve mumbles into his pillow. He opens his eyes fully, immediately regretting it when the brightness of the room nearly blinds him. He groans and buries his face back into the pillow to shield himself.
A loud boom fills the base, the walls and floors shaking. Steve loses his balance and stumbles forward, one hand flying out to grasp onto the wall for support.
“You should see what she's doing now,” Tony says and rises to his feet to cross the room and grab the diaper bag from off the bed. He pulls out a fluffy blanket and sets it up on the hardwood floor. He pats the center of the blanket and Steve catches the hint, laying Morgan down on her stomach. Tony drops down to his own belly to be at her level, smiling when she lifts her head to meet his eyes. “Hey, Maguna. Wanna show papa what you’ve been doing?”
Natasha smiles and adjusts herself so that she’s closer, but not too close to apply even more pressure to her friend’s belly. She places her hand over the large bump, hoping the ice cream has kicked in and awoken the little boy.
It shouldn’t hurt this much anymore, especially after the countless attempts they’ve made. But Steve would be lying if he said the negative result on another pregnancy test didn’t bother him. As of late, that seems to be the only type of result he gets.
“No,” Steve shakes his head and he directs his gaze on the screen. He gasps softly when the image of his baby appears on the screen. It wasn’t just a gray blob anymore, he can make out a tiny head and body. Steve props himself up on his elbows to get a better look. “Is that-that’s my-”
She slams her bedroom door hard behind her, not caring if it gets her in trouble. At least then she would be getting some form of attention.
Peter starts packing a bag of clothes and other items he was going to need. He didn’t know who he was going to stay with, but anywhere was better than his own apartment. It was too painful.
“Hey, hey,” Tony soothes and sits down on the bed. The omega tries to move away. “Steve, I’m not going to do that. I’d never do that. But listen to me, I need you to tell me who he is.”
Having a baby was the last thing Steve expected. For years he had put off the idea of settling down and starting a family to focus on being the hero America needed. The simple life was what he had wanted at one point in time, but that life just didn’t exist anymore when he picked up the shield.
“Well done,” Alpha praises and he steps into the room. He strides over until he’s standing in front of the omega, his smile widening when he reaches out to touch him. Steve can’t help but flinch from the contact. “You did good. There should be no reason for this to fail.”
But it was all a lie. Tony didn’t care. And Steve so badly wanted to have the same attitude, but he wasn’t like Tony. He might deny around his friends that there weren't any romantic feelings involved, but that was far from the truth. Steve did feel something.
“Y-yeah.” Steve nods and Happy helps him down the stairs. Steve stops once they reach the last step. “My phone!” He remembers. “It’s-it’s on the kitchen counter.”
“Great,” Tony says and his eyes flicker to the omega’s belly. He can make out the small bump under the form fitting shirt. There's still that bit of doubt he has. A part of him wants the pup to be his, but the other half wants nothing to do with the current situation. His life was screwed up enough as it was. Now it was like it had gotten a thousand times worse.
Giving up was something Steve never did. It wasn’t who he was. He was willing to stand up and fight until he couldn’t. Giving up wasn’t in his blood.
Tony lets out a heavy sigh and rolls over on his side, propping his head up on his elbow. “Steve, I-damn you’re so gorgeous,” Tony says, reaching out to stroke his thumb along Steve’s cheek. “God, I wish we worked.”
Steve decides at that moment that dinner was ready. The last thing he wanted was for his son to get upset. Peter had seemed better today and he didn’t want that streak to end so quickly.
Natasha looks around at the sullen faces of her family. The loss of Steve was great amongst all of them. He was an important piece to their family, the glue that kept them together. He was their leader. Their Captain.
He drops down to his knees, grunting softly when his own rest on the shower floor. He’s careful when he cleans around Steve’s legs. When he rises to his feet to instruct Steve to turn around, Steve is able to read his mind and turn on his own until they’re facing each other. Steve smiles softly, hoping it would be enough to wipe the frown off Tony’s face. It does. It always does.
“Yes you can. You’re doing so good,” Tony assures. He presses the towel against Steve’s opening, trying not panic when the towel is stained crimson. Steve is tensing up again from what Tony assumes is another contraction.
He was back in hiding now, shielding himself behind the comfort of the walls his lake house provided. He was probably better off staying in the city, but he needed to give Peter space. This was the only way he knew how.
I got around to updating this one! It's nothing special and I do apologize. Just some more baby bonding. Enjoy!
Hello! It’s time to welcome baby number 2! Thank you guys for being so awesome! I love all of you. And thank you to my friend, Marisa for helping me out with this chapter 😊
“I’ll go get checked out,” Steve finishes and moves around the counter to kiss Tony softly on the lips. “I’m okay,” he assures once they break apart. “You know how this part is.”
Peter’s eyes squeeze shut when his belly tightens. He breathes deeply through his nose and rubs the lower part of his belly. If anyone were to notice they might just think he had an upset stomach. Maybe he could get out of school and hide in his room until he knew what the hell he was supposed to do.
Peter smiles and leads the way. For the most part the tour is brief. They don’t spend too much time in the kitchen. Peter mentions the meals that were prepared together and the ones that left one half of the apartment in smoke.
“Tony?” Steve whimpers, looking up at him again. Their eyes lock, and Tony gives him an encouraging smile.
Tony glances down at his lap, fiddling nervously with his hands and toying with the gold band on his finger. He wonders how Steve could possibly love him or even want to continue being married to him. He was a monster.
A sob rips through his throat and he quickly cups his mouth to keep himself from disturbing his sleeping son. But he can’t keep the tears that flow freely down his face. His body shakes with each sob and he grips the countertop to steady himself. He hangs his head between his shoulders and cries.
“N-Nat.” Steve gasps and he tips his head back, hissing through gritted teeth when she touches him again.
“And neither did you,” Natasha adds, taking his hand again and smoothing her thumb over his knuckles. “It’s not your fault, Steve.”
Steve huffs when he struggles to fasten his belt. His brows pinch together in concentration, a quiet curse slipping past his lips when he continues to have issues.
Peter moves slowly toward his father, tears building in his eyes with each step. He ignores the other people around him, all of his focus is on Steve. Peter chokes back a sob at the sight of him. He doesn’t want to see the wounds and blood on his father’s form, he doesn’t want to see him struggling to hold onto life.
Peter’s eyes roam over the variety of options, his stomach growling in response to the delicious looking food and smells. He immediately goes for the pizza box, a smile forming over his face at the sight of the Brooklyn styled pie.
“Sorry,” Peter quickly apologizes when he catches the way Tony’s eyes drift in the direction of his sleeping daughter. “I felt bad about letting her sleep alone and then she started crying and-”
Natalie opens the door all the way revealing two men. They don’t look like police. One of them is dressed in black tactical gear with a bow and arrow strapped behind his back. The other man is older, his hair thinning in some places. He’s dressed in a black suit.
“Nothing. My mate used to be obsessed with you. In college he studied you and wanted to follow in your footsteps. Even joined the military.”
It’s not long until the food has arrived and they are sitting down to eat in the living room. Steve is still quiet, unsure of how he’s supposed to act in the alpha’s presence. The last thing he wanted was to ruin another meal between them.
The door to his room opens and Steve’s head snaps up. He quickly uncurls himself and scrambles off his bed, ready to greet Alpha. The smile Alpha wears is one Steve has seen many times before. He was pleased.
Tony had assured he’d take care of all the dirty diapers, but Steve wasn’t going to let him do all the work. Peter doesn’t fight him, not like he had during his first diaper change of the day. Tony of course had been there to step in and help when Steve became overwhelmed. Now though, he’s calm and confident that he’d have no more issues with his son.
Sam and Bucky share a look, then Bucky turns back to Peter and sighs. “You’re right. I guess I’ve been hanging onto the past. Him leaving didn’t hurt me, I wasn’t even a part of the team before he up and left. But I was angry because he hurt my best friend and my nephew.”
Steve smiles to himself and curls up closer to Tony, enjoying the warmth and comfort he brings. He wishes things could stay like this, but eventually Tony was going to leave and he’d have to figure out how to do this alone.
“Hey, don’t apologize. I can get up more, I promise. And if I don’t wake up just throw me out of bed or something,” Tony jokes. This was usually the part where Steve laughs, but he doesn’t even crack a grin. Steve appears calmer, though, so Tony wasn’t about to complain over the fact that his husband didn’t laugh over one of his lame jokes.
The line of cars in front of them began to move again. Tony keeps his gaze down, too engrossed in the conversation with his assistant to notice the figure running into the road. Happy slams on the breaks, the tires screeching and the vehicle coming to a halt, just inches away from hitting the man.
“I know but we could live here. It’s quiet and private. No one will bother us. Pete can play out here until the sun goes down.”
There was still a piece missing from the puzzle Steve was trying to assemble. Going out and facing the world was still something he hadn’t had the courage to do yet. He was from a different time and didn’t know where he fit into this new world. He was robbed from his old life.
Steve glances down at his son’s face, eyes filling with tears when tiny dark ones stare up at him. He does as he’s told, giving the alpha his pup.
“It’ll be okay,” Tony assures. He has no problem reaching for Steve’s hand. He doesn’t grab it, just places his own over Steve’s. He wants to do more but he holds off. Lately, he’s already been too touchy. They were supposed to be broken up.
“I got it,” Tony says and kisses Steve again before disappearing to the kitchen with a very eager Harley behind him.
“And I did! I did and it was stupid and with the worst person on this whole planet. Probably the whole universe.”
But then he’s reminded that he didn’t need to run this morning or have his running buddy with him. Peter sighs sadly and rolls over onto his side, hoping he’d fall back asleep. But he never does and he’s left to stare at the walls.
Steve hadn’t shared the news of his pregnancy yet. He purposely waited a few weeks to make sure that he was pregnant. The test he had taken when he started to feel off wasn’t enough of a reassurance. He didn’t blame himself for lacking trust in the drug store tests. They had let him down before.
“Fine. What are you working on?” Peter eyes the red boot on the bench and then his eyes are traveling up to the computer monitors. That’s when he notices the familiar design on the screens. “My suit!”
“Daddy’s going to be home soon and you’re a mess, and this place is a mess. I don’t think daddy will mind but I do. You are a stinker, huh?”
It’s that reminder that has him turning his frown upside down. Steve was ecstatic about the shower and celebrating their son. Tony could understand why his husband was acting the way he was. A family was another thing Steve thought he needed to sacrifice. The least Tony could do was give him a child.
“Yeah. I can find them a therapist if that helps. I know I’m gonna need to talk to someone and if you need that too then we can set that up. I want you to heal and get back to how you used to be. And I don’t mean the kid from Brooklyn.”
“Almost all the time. He promised he’d always be there so I like to think he kept that promise. Those had been the last words he said to me…”
The alpha trails a hand between their bodies, going lower and lower until rough fingers find the omega’s entrance. Steve gasps from the unwanted touch and he’s quickly shushed. “Shh,” the alpha croons in his ear. “I’ll make it feel good. Better than he could.”
The city is awake and bustling like every morning. The streets are already crowded with morning commuters. Peter is able to bypass most of it; swinging through the air was a much faster way to get around. Luckily no one notices him. The world didn’t know about Spider-Man yet.
Steve sends Tony a reassuring smile before turning back to his pup, hugging him close and nuzzling him affectionately, drenching the pup in the familiar and comforting scent. James responds with another soft purr.
Peter stops his rambling to catch his breath, the smile on his face faltering. He sighs sadly and adjusts flowers he brought with him, cursing to himself when the petals from one of the white roses falls to the ground.
Tony grins and steps further into the room. “Always. How is he?” He asks, coming over to get a better look at their son. Peter pulls away from Steve when he senses his other father and sets his gaze on Tony.
“Oh. That’s good...I think. And um I didn’t do anything stupid, right? Like chase after any betas or omegas? I tend to...do that.”
, he tells himself. He had to be strong even when he didn’t want to be. His family was broken and it was up to him to keep them from crumbling. Just like his papa used to do.
There’s only one guy left standing between Steve and his objective. Steve doesn’t make the first move, eyes trained on the gun the man has pointed on him, no doubt one of Stark’s weapons. The gun is going off and Steve raises his shield in front of him to block the attack. The sound of the bullets hitting the vibranium echo throughout the room.
Steve screams in outrage and brings a clenched fist down against the alpha’s jaw, bruising the skin there. He issues another punch, this time to the alpha’s nose and blood pours from his broken nose.
They decide to talk in his office. It was more secure and further away from the offices on the lower level. The last thing Tony wanted was for anyone to eavesdrop.
Peter nods his head and jumps up from the stairs. He moves shyly toward his brother. “Sorry, Harley. I won’t scare you no more.”
Tony rolls his eyes and turns around in his seat when a familiar scent wafts through the air. He’s not surprised to find his mate coming down the stairs; Steve knew the passcode and never hesitated to come down and spend time with Tony if he ever had the urge. Lately, he needed to be around the alpha more than usual.
Steve was already so in love with the baby. Tony for the life of him couldn’t feel that same emotion for the clump of cells. That’s all it was to him.
He stops himself and moves back; that other part of his brain has switched back on, even for just a moment, to remind him that what he was considering was wrong. This wasn’t who Tony was.
Alexander nods, then he’s gesturing for his men to follow and together they turn and leave. Tony watches as they go, making sure they’re out of sight before turning and heading back to the elevators.
Bucky chuckles softly against Sam’s neck. Sam smiles and pulls back slightly to see his husband’s face, and the small smile on his lips.
“And I like movies,” Peter says, still keeping his eyes on anything but his dad. “Papa loved them too.”
“I love you, Steve. I loved you before this and I love you now. I’ll always love you. I can’t truly understand how you’re feeling, but just know I’m here no matter what. I don’t want to lose you. You and Morgan are the only things that matter to me.”
“Okay. Did he say anything about medi-” Tony stops himself, not wanting to make Steve any more uncomfortable than he already was. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that-”
Steve gives it a shot. It’s just another failed attempt. It’s tempting to leave a message, but that wasn’t how Steve wanted to break the news.
He can’t help but hope that one day he’d have his family back together again. He wonders if his papa would’ve wanted the same thing.
“-then I don’t want to hear it. We work together, Tony. It would unprofessional for you to discuss your love life-”
Tony tenses, his scent growing sour and another growl forming. Steve whines softly and leans in to nuzzle around his throat, using his own sweet scent to calm his distressed mate. For once couldn’t alphas get along?
Steve opens his mouth to respond, only to shut it when a loud crash followed by another round of giggles reaches his ears.
“Steve, calm down. Hey, come here.” Tony pulls Steve close again. “It’s going to be okay. I promise.”
Trust was still something Steve found himself struggling with. He could count on one hand alone the individuals who he had trust in. Those people were gone now. But now he had a new person. Maybe even two.
“Okay,” Morgan says and gets up from the table. She takes the history paper with her, smiling to herself at the big red A. She was sure her dad would love to see it too.
“I did this,” Steve says, his voice quiet. Tony stil hears him and he gets up from the chair, moving to sit on the bed. Steve lifts his head when he feels the bed dip. “I’m sorry.”
Bruce nods in agreement and leans back in his seat, opening one of Steve’s books and skimming through it.
“Uh.” Steve scrambles for the remote and pauses the movie. “Just sketching,” he says and shows her his sketchpad.
“Steve?” The doctor’s voice is in his ears again. “Steve, I need you to stay awake okay? You still need to pass the placenta.”
It’s Peter who decides when it’s time for them to go. He wakes up from his nap, small but irritable whimpers escaping him. Steve gets to him first, releasing one arm around Sarah to reach down and place the pacifier back into his son’s mouth. Peter spits it out and cries, his tiny legs kicking off the blanket Tony had placed over him.
Toward her left, Bruce and Thor are sitting beside each other, both silent. Clint is hanging off the sofa beside Natasha, his hand on her shoulder. He squeezes it every few minutes. She’s grateful he’s here. She wouldn’t be able to function without him.
He thanks Jarvis and then makes his way back outside, searching for the lights he was told to follow. It’s not difficult to locate, and pretty soon Steve is following the twinkling, white lights that Tony used to illuminate the path that leads to the lake.
“You’re sure?” Steve asks again, still nibbling nervously on his fingernails. He’s asked that same question after Bruce’s examination on each of his pups. He couldn’t help it. He was worried.
Steve smiles behind the rim of his mug and his face flushes from Tony’s soft gaze. Tony tears his eyes away and takes his first drink from the mug, sighing in delight.
He knew better than to aggravate and push Steve’s buttons, and yet that’s exactly what he did. Steve was in a delicate state of mind; anything was going to set him off. Tony knew this and still decided to push and push until Steve had no choice but to blow up.
“Is he okay?” The beta asks. Tony nods and plops down in the empty seat he had been occupying earlier. He’s used to this space belonging to Happy while he occupies a seat in the middle of the jet and enjoys a glass of whiskey. That seat now has a scared and pregnant omega sitting in it.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut but he can’t hold back the tears any longer and they roll down his face. He keeps his arms at his side, fingers digging into the sheets when his body is rocked and pressed deeper into the bed.
Tony hisses and pulls away, sending a glare in his assistant’s way. Pepper frowns at him before leaning in to dab more antibacterial ointment on the wound. Tony hisses again, teeth gritting together from the sting.
“I know.” Steve sighs and steps into the room, shutting the door behind him to give them privacy. He takes a seat beside his son, his eyes immediately landing on the backpack. “Going somewhere?”
“Hey, Princess,” Tony calls out to his daughter, smiling when she pulls away from Steve to glance at him. “Do you want to help me with these cookies?”
“I have to. I can’t keep Tony from him. And maybe when he’s older, he’d want to meet his father. I wouldn’t be upset if he ever did.”
Peter frowns at the pair of simple looking sunglasses sitting inside the case. “I’m...confused. Are these super expensive or something?”
Tony places another kiss to the bond mark, then backs away to let Steve finish changing. He changes into his own night time attire and settles into bed. Steve joins him and curls up close, searching for Tony’s neck and nuzzling the spot once he’s granted access.
Tony playfully rolls his eyes and sets his Starkpad to the side. “So you hungry? You haven’t eaten much of anything.”
Sam follows after his husband, knowing Bucky was probably heading to their apartment to distract himself with Alpine. He finds Bucky in the kitchen, hunched over the sink and on the verge of vomiting. Sam rushes to his side, laying a comforting hand over Bucky’s back as he dry heaves.
Tony sighs. “Yeah, I guess so. Do you really think I could be a dad? I mean, you know how screwed up I am.”
“Fuckfuckfuck.” Tony repeats the word over and over again. He’s gripping Steve’s arms tightly, fingers digging deeply into the skin and leaving behind red marks. His back is curved and his forehead is pressed against Steve’s chest. He cries out suddenly, the grip he has on Steve tightens.
The concern doesn’t last long in his mind and he quickly pushes it aside when Tony renters his thoughts.
“You belong to me.” Pierce comes closer until he’s kneeling on the edge of the mattress, then he crawls on his knees toward the omega. Steve bares his teeth and growls in warning, but he goes ignored and strong hands are gripping him by the ankles and tugging him close. “Stop fighting me! You’re my omega!”
Steve knows better than to keep Tony waiting and he moves faster, harder. The room fills with the sound of their hips meeting and the delicious noises Tony produces from the rough fucking. Steve grips Tony’s hips, fingers digging into the soft flesh and leaving behind deep, purple marks. He realizes what he’s done almost immediately and loosens his grip. The last thing he wants to do is hurt Tony or the baby.
Harley, being the sneaky one that he is, dips a finger into the batter and runs away giggling before anyone can scold him. Steve just huffs and shakes his head.
There’s a moment of silence between them. They still needed to talk and it was clear neither one of them knew how to begin.
“I had no control,” Steve is quick to remind. The tone he’s using is dangerous in front of an alpha. A part of him is ready to apologize and beg for forgiveness like he’s been taught, but the other half urges him against it. He didn’t apologize to anyone anymore.
“Honey?” Steve’s eyes shoot open at the concerned tone of his husband’s voice. Tony is frowning at him. “It doesn’t really hurt.”
“Yikes. No thanks. I hated getting up early then and I hate it now. I haven’t slept by the way, which explains why I’m here.”
Tony cradles his son close, smiling every time Peter does something simple as yawning or stretching. Steve is already on the verge of sleep, his eyelids struggling to stay open.
Tony holds Steve close as they make love. He keeps one hand over his mate’s belly, wishing this would be the night they conceive their fifth child, but then he’s reminded of the obstacle preventing that wish from coming true.
“Yes! Feels so good!” Steve increases his pace until he’s bouncing in Tony’s lap, curses and moans spilling from his lip every time his prostate is stimulated. Steve whimpers and tugs his bottom lip between his teeth, eyes screwing shut from the intense pleasure coursing through his body. He never knew mating could feel like this.
That thought hadn’t crossed his mind before. He had trusted Steve and the story he told him. But now a seed was planted and Tony wondered if maybe that pup in Steve’s belly wasn't his.
“Just remember what I taught you. You’re strong, Pete. I know you have what it takes to...keep fighting.”
James slowly crawls closer to his mother, his scent still tinged with fear and uncertainty. Steve keeps his arms open, holding his breath when his pup gets closer and closer. Once James is close enough, Steve wraps his arms around him. James clings to Steve tightly, leaning up to nose around Steve’s neck, searching for the spot that offers the most comfort.
Steve brushes the pain off as false labor. He was at that stage and all the books mentioned it. They also mentioned that the pain wasn’t usually horrible and the contractions would be sporadic. Real labor contractions were supposed to have a pattern.
“Ah fuck!” Steve cries out from a particular hard thrust from Tony. He arches his back, a loud moan slipping past his parted lips when Tony continues to move inside of him at an unforgiving pace.
They spend the rest of the evening talking about other things, making sure Steve doesn’t get brought up unless it has to do with happy memories. Peter had plenty of those and he’s willing to share all of them.
“You’re a good kid. My dad treated me like crap and I couldn’t forgive him so easily. You’re strong, kiddo.”
“I don’t know. I've heard of it but this sounds different. You’re not the only one who’s noticed how you’ve changed. Are you sure you’re not-”
“Friday, what’s the time?” Steve asks the A.I. He works on finishing the last bit of preparation while he waits for her to respond.
“I can help!” Peter’s face lights up at the sound of an opportunity to create something with his dad. “Please! I want to help.”
“You can sleep now, Pete,” Tony whispers and softly kisses the top of Peter’s head. “I’ll be here when you wake up.”
His own food is getting cold from the lack of appetite he has. What was supposed to be a time for them to enjoy breakfast and talk was now ruined. And Tony blames himself.
Flash was walking in their direction, his own group of friends beside him. They’re laughing and talking about something Peter doesn’t catch, but knowing them, it was probably bragging about the poor kid they’ve made their victim before the first bell even rang.
“I just want to make sure he’s okay,” Steve says after he gives in and carefully places Peter down in his crib. He remains by the crib, not wanting to walk away in case his son woke up and needed him.
Tony expects another kick to his side, but instead Pierce’s fist comes crashing down and collides with Tony’s nose. Pain erupts from the blow, the impact strong enough to whip Tony’s head back and into the wall. His vision blurs with tears and blood gushes from his bruised nose.
He’s at least grateful that they don’t put the sack back over his head, and he’s able to examine the corridors he’s led down. It was almost impossible to guess just how big the base was, but judging by its mass size, it must have multiple access points. They would be heavily guarded, probably cameras on every corner too. Breaking out wasn’t going to be easy.
“Kinda hope it’s sooner. Not that I don’t like being pregnant but I really want to meet him and hold him.”
Steve chokes back a sob and squeezes his eyes shut. He tries to block out the sounds, the smell, the feel; all of it. He prays to be put out of his misery and to go back to a time where this wasn’t his life. He misses being with Tony and their son.
Hanging up the shield was Steve’s idea. The duration of his hiatus was unknown. Perhaps one day he’d go back to being Captain America, but for right now he was content with just being Steve and a full time father. He had missed so much of Morgan’s life and he couldn’t bear to miss another second.
“Yeah, boss, he’s here. Yeah. He’s-” Happy pauses his private conversation to glance at Peter, scanning him closely and making Peter shift uncomfortably. “Yeah he’s good. He’s smiling...or was. Yes-you know what I’m sending him up. Ask him then.”
“Take all the time you need. Pretty soon this room is going to be full of rowdy Avengers demanding they hold the baby. Fights are going to break out. My money is on Widow.”
“Day two of you being sick,” Steve corrects. “We don’t know how far along you are. I’m guessing maybe six...seven weeks?”
“Speaking of baby,” Tony says and sets Harley down so that he can put Sarah into the stroller. “We better go. Pete’s not having it.”
“Come here, Petey.” Steve opens his arms and Peter rushes into the room and crawls his way up the bed until he’s in the strong arms. Steve cuddles his son close. “Bad dream?”
By the time the party comes to an end, Steve is exhausted. He’s had his fill of delicious food and it was beginning to make him drowsy. Peter had other ideas and seemed to be having a little party of his own. Maybe that second helping of cake hadn’t been a good idea.
Tony cringes to himself when Steve leaves first and heads up the stairs. A part of him wants to call after the omega and beg him to stay. But he lets Steve go.
“No. My family’s gone. I ran away from...Alpha.” The last word is said in a hushed tone. Tony furrows his brows. He didn’t know the omega was bonded.
“I uh almost got it...I think.” Tony knows for a fact that he's failing miserably. Peter is growing more irritable, his face turning red from how uncomfortable he is. Tony sighs. “Okay. I need some help.”
“Peter, you’re kinda scaring me,” Ned’s worried tone is what has Peter finally facing his friend. Tears spring to his eyes and Peter quickly looks away, his eyes squeezing shut.
“Of course he will. Just not the way you want him to. I bet he’s watching over that kid, and you and me and the rest of the team. He’s probably wondering why you’re acting so grumpy.”
“Thanks,” he eventually says and leans his head back against the wall. “This sucks. And it’s only what, day two?”
“Guess we were wrong huh?” Tony smiles and leans down to press a kiss to Steve’s head. “We’re having a boy.”
Steve nods in agreement. “They need a lot of attention. I’m working on creating a bond and letting them get used to my scent but…” Steve trails off with a sigh. “It’s going to take more than that to get them comfortable.”
“Hey,” Steve soothes and Tony glances up at him again. His own eyes are just shiny. “This one’s on me.”
“Da!” Peter says happily and all attention lands on him. He’s pushed himself up, and on wobbly legs, takes a few steps toward his parents. He stops for a moment when he loses balance, but he’s quick to regain it and he moves his tiny legs a little more until he’s standing near Steve.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony assures and he steps into the room, moving toward the dresser and pulling out a fresh shirt for Steve. “I remember where you left everything,” he explains when Steve looks at him quizzically.
Peter stops fighting and stares up at his dad. He releases another sob. Tony wraps his arms around him, and this time Peter doesn’t fight back.
He exhales slowly and leans back in his chair, gripping the paper close to his chest. There’s a sense of relief hanging over him now that he knows the truth, but he can’t help but feel overwhelmed by the news. He doesn’t understand why he would have such feelings when he had decided early on that he would take care of the pup no matter what the test revealed. He promised Steve that he’d keep both him and his unborn child safe. That promise wasn’t going to change.
Hello, friends! I hope you all are doing well! This chapter is a little on the short side and kind of a bit of a filler. I’ll include more Tony & Peter moments in the next one and bring in some more characters and drama 😉
It’s the lack of warmth and an empty bed that jolts Steve awake. He gasps and sits up, eyes scanning around the room for the alpha that had been with him during the night. He’s greeted with an empty room. Tony’s scent still lingers on the pillows and sheets, but it’s not enough; Steve needs him.
“H-hey,” Peter stutters out a response. He tries the lock again, mentally cursing to himself when he fails a third time.
Tony smiles softly at the confession. He places a hand over Peter’s shoulder and squeezes the area gently. “You’re a good kid, Pete. And it’s not stupid. I see you as a son. I know Morgan loves you and you’d make a great big brother.”
“I have ears!” Steve snaps, peering up at Tony with red-rimmed eyes. He grunts and leans forward, resting his forehead against Tony’s chest. “‘M sorry,” he mumbles. “It really hurts.”
The beating gets softer and softer, then it stops. Peter can’t bring himself to look. He yanks off the sunglasses and the image of his papa's lifeless form dissolves.
Tony hadn’t intended for there to be any tension between when it came to discussing the future plans for dealing with Steve’s depression. They decided against the idea of talking it through with the team; this decision needed to be made without their input. Tony had disagreed at first, arguing that their friends should help them, but Steve was right, this wasn’t about them. It was about him and what was best for him. Even Tony didn’t have much of a say.
“That’s not you. Steve, whatever you’re thinking...it’s not you. I know you don’t mean the things you say or do because it’s not
The changes had been subtle at first. No one would notice them if they weren’t looking. But Steve was looking. He was always waiting for the signs to show up, even after Tony would tell him it was probably too soon to tell. You could say it turned into a bit of an obsession. Most days he found it difficult to focus on the team and his duties as Captain. All he could think about was Tony and their future baby.
Tony nods as he considers this. “True,” he says then turns to his mate. “How does that sound? It’ll just be one interviewer.”
Steve drags Pierce back into the room he had been held in, tossing him like a rag doll toward the contraption that was meant for Steve. Alexander scrambles to his hands and knees, desperately trying to crawl away. It’s pathetic.
“Wait until you see what he has.” The way Tony winks has Steve growing suspicious again, and he just knows their night was not going to be simple.
“Damn you, Steve,” Tony angrily speaks to the image as if Steve was really standing in front of him. “I’m not taking all the blame for this. You could’ve done more. It wasn’t just me.”
Soft footsteps reach his ears and he turns around, finding the woman coming toward him. She scans the badge clipped to the front of her coat and the door opens.
He gives up on the walking, deciding he’d rather lie down again. Bucky helps him back to the bed and adjusts the pillows for him, making sure Steve is comfortable.
“You hungry?” Tony asks and shuts the fridge door. “I’m not much of a cook but I can order something.”
“I just didn’t think I could have this. I think that’s why when something was off I didn’t think it would be because of him.”
He shouldn’t be nervous, but it was difficult to shake the uneasy energy coursing through him. This hadn’t been the first time Steve’s felt like this. The butterflies have swarmed in his belly before. It’s happened before missions and a few times in his personal life. Meeting Tony had been one of those instances, and again when Steve took his last name and promised to spend the rest of this life and the next with Tony.
“You’re so beautiful,” Tony whispers and trails his hand down Steve’s body until it’s lingering where the omega wants it most. Steve’s cock is already leaking, the head glistening with precome. Noticing the way the alpha’s looking at him, Steve grows more confident and spreads his legs, exposing his wet hole.
That same hand travels lower until it’s resting over the leather collar still secured around the omega’s neck. It only takes a second to have it removed.
This wasn’t making any sense. He didn’t look pregnant, didn’t have any of the symptoms. At least, he didn’t think he did. It finally dawns on him that the unusual changes in his body wasn’t because of stress or any illnesses. He was pregnant. And now he was in labor.
Steve nods and holds his daughter close, placing a kiss to her soft blond hair. She’s already dozing off, bright eyes threatening to fall shut. Steve kisses her again before handing her off to Tony so that he can kiss his son’s goodnight.
“Me, too. But I’ll be here when you need me okay? And don’t feel guilty about this. Enjoy the peace and quiet.”
Steve is immediately ambushed and greeted with hugs. He laughs and gives them each a kiss on the cheek. Tony makes his way over and picks Peter up so that he too can get a kiss from the omega.
The baby shower ends up differently than Steve expected. There were only five of them total, and yet Tony had prepared as if a hundred guests had been invited. Maybe a hundred was too big of a number, but Tony was probably used to having a guest list that long.
“It’s going to take time. I’m proud of how much you’ve grown since then. What Tony experienced wasn’t the same as what you had, and he probably just needs more time.”
Tony’s thought of leaving the team a few times. It wasn’t like he really belonged with the group Nick scraped together. They were all outcasts, and maybe that’s why he was chosen. It didn’t matter. He didn’t fit it, didn’t play well with others.
Steve cries out suddenly and uses Happy as leverage. The muscles in his abdomen coil, followed by a pressure between his legs.
“He’s not, Uncle Bucky! I don’t know why you don’t like him. Yeah he’s made mistakes, but haven’t we all? You’re not innocent.”
Tony connects their lips again, this time deepening the kiss. Steve responds instantly, wrapping his arms around Tony’s neck to bring him closer.
He’s taken into another room, this one a complete contrast from the one he was removed from. It’s clean, the walls blinding white and the air sterile. Tony inhales deeply, glad to be breathing anything other than alpha stink. The tiled floor is cold against his bare feet, but the rest of the room is engulfed in a comfortable heat.
Tony isn’t where Steve left. He’s not surprised to find his husband gone and probably down in his lab at this very moment. It was his way to calm down and blow off some steam. Steve both hated and loved it. He loved that his husband had an outlet, but he hated that said outlet would result in Tony spending long hours away from home, and forgetting basic human needs like sleeping, eating, and drinking. Unless the drinking involved coffee then he was fine. Steve still hated it.
Once he’s alone, he can’t stop the sob that escapes him. He wraps his arms around himself for comfort, but it’s not enough. One hand finds its way to his neck, fingers touching the mark there. He wonders if it even means anything.
Steve frowns as he listens to Tony and Pepper speak. The meeting was called to discuss what to do about Steve and the four pups that have magical appeared in Tony's life. Steve is still hesitant to come forward and face the world. It's been so long since he's been in it.
Peter is laid down in the bassinet and Steve crawls into Tony’s large bed, scooting closer toward edge so that he can lean over and brush his fingers along Peter’s face.
But he was sure his papa needed help now, and Peter wasn’t going to let him down. He may be young and still in training, but he could do it. This would be his chance to prove himself.
“It’ll get...easier.” Natasha doesn’t sound so sure. She honestly didn’t know how anything was supposed to get easier and return to normal. Their lives were altered permanently.
It’s not long until the vast living area is decorated with streamers, balloons and a banner. Tony decided to go against the typical gender colors frequently used for such occasions, and instead used red, white and blue as the color theme. It was Independence Day after all.
The death of Tony’s parents was unexpected. One minute they’re making a stop at the Pentagon and the next they’re being brutally murdered on an old country road.
“You feel so good, Omega,” Tony praises, pulling back slightly before sliding back in. He glances down, watching himself fuck his cock in and out of the omega’s stretched and dripping hole. “So fucking good.”
“I don’t want to pet him. Just- Steve, get him out of here.” Tony steps back, keeping one hand out just in case he needs to protect himself. The dog comes closer, his slobbery tongue making contact with Tony’s outstretched hand.
Not a day goes by when he’s not thinking about him. Steve never said where he went or what he’s doing. Tony understood. If the roles had been switched, Tony would choose to hide away too. He was a monster. A killer. Just like Steve said.
“It’s not the end of the world,” Peter sniffs. He wishes he believed his own words. In all honesty worse things could’ve happened to him.
“Can’t exactly do this part,” Steve sniffs, then he’s directing his attention back to Morgan when she continues to cry. “Shh, it’s okay, baby,” he tries to soothe, but the tone is off; there’s nothing comforting about the way he says those words.
Peter mumbles again and folds his arms over the island and rests his head on them. “Daddy, can you make more pancakes again?”
Steve steadies himself on his forearms, not wanting to apply too much pressure to the delicate bump between them. His own belly brushes against Tony’s. It’s smaller in comparison and for a moment that other half of his brain reminds him to think about it again, but then the pleasure is taking over and he’s forgetting about it.
Peter shrugs in response. “I don’t know. I know I should be angry but...I don’t know. You’re my dad and I love you.”
It never comes, and instead he’s forcefully brought to his feet and pressed against the wall. His arms are pulled behind his back and his hands are tied. He doesn’t bother trying to test out the strength of the restraints. He knew better than to escape.
It’s tempting to remain by Steve’s side and try and get some much needed rest, but sleep is the last thing on his mind. He makes sure Steve is still sleeping before getting out of bed and leaving the room.
Tony remains quiet. He rubs a hand up and down along Steve’s arm, reminding him that he was still there. Steve eases into his touch.
“Steve, he’s okay. When we go back to the tower he’ll be sleeping alone. Let's just try one night okay? He’s safe. We’re close by and Jarvis is always looking out for him.”
Steve’s face shows up on the monitors. The photo is a few years old, dating back to when Tony had been on speaking terms with him. His heart still clenches painfully at the sight of Steve’s face. It also brings anger, confusion, regret.
“It’s fine.” Bruce dismisses with a wave of his hand. “I was happy to help. I’m glad your son is okay. He looks like you.”
“We can’t. It only happened once and we weren’t even sober. Unless you suggest we do this job while drunk then maybe I’ll consider.”
Steve decides to end the conversation. His eyes land on the foreign device. He knew little about the different types of technology this new world had. Being held captive for so many years kept him from learning about this generation. He was still trapped in his old life. It was simpler then. It was all he knew.
“Are you okay?” Pepper’s voice snaps Peter from his thoughts and he nods. She doesn’t appear convinced. Clearly she can see the tears in his eyes and the red, blotchy spots on his face.
Tony pulls out the ring and it places it over Steve’s finger, just like he had done on that day when he vowed to love Steve for the rest of his life.
Steve huffs out a small laugh and lays his head over Tony’s shoulder. “I missed my babies. They do okay?”
“The tests came back negative,” the beta says and Steve swears he feels all his anxiety leave him. “It’s a little early to know for sure, but I can give you an emergency contraception just to be on the safe side.”
“I’m sorry.” Steve’s voice is quiet, broken. Their eyes meet, allowing Tony to see how shiny and full of pain they are. “I’m so sorry. This isn’t me. You know that, right?”
“Fine. Then I’ll punch him. Punch him until he feels like how my best friend felt for the past 15 years!”
“And then Ned was telling me about his new Star Wars Lego Death Star and I was like ‘that sounds awesome!’ and then he said we could do it this weekend, after homework and stuff.”
“Don’t.” Tony points a warning finger in his husband’s direction. “Don’t jinx me. Let me enjoy this. This is the first time in nine fucking months where I’ve been comfortable.”
The first stall is occupied, saving Peter from any embarrassment and teasing. He washes his hands and dries them hurriedly, not caring if they’re still a little damp. One look in the mirror shows that in fact his eyes and nose are red. He looks like a wreck.
“Ignoring you? I haven’t ignored you, and I’m sorry you hate Dodger being everywhere but this is his home too. Unless you want me to throw him out?”
Morgan is screaming at the top of her lungs, her face scrunched up and bright pink from her discomfort. Steve is desperately trying to calm her down, failing miserably when Morgan only grows more frustrated.
“What’s in here?” Tony gestures to the closed door they pass on the upper level. He reaches out for the knob only to pause when Peter stops him.
After Steve took a moment to calm down, it was time for presents. He told his friends about the baby moving, but to their disappointment, the kicking had stopped. He figured after consuming a little sugar that his son would be moving around again.
Tony turns toward his mate, ready to tell him about the family vacation he’s planning, only to rethink the idea when he senses the change in Steve’s scent. The omega is staring out the SUVs window, mindlessly playing with the messy hair atop James’ head. The little pup yawns and his eyes fall shut.
Tony gives a small shrug in response. “Could be. And if it is then there’s less of a chance of her turning out like me.”
“How are you feeling?” Bruce asks as he feels around Steve’s throat, his touch gentle when he reaches the bond mark. He notes the bruises around the mark, but again doesn’t ask.
“But not like you. Come on, Brucie, please? I swear I’ll explain all of it once I figure some shit out, but I need you, buddy. And if that is my pup...Jesus, I can’t even begin to imagine that. Just find out for sure. Run some tests or something.”
He’s reminded that he’s not entirely alone. He still had the rest of his family, so he decides to test the waters.
Tony keeps a close eye on him, not wanting to blink and find that he’s lost his husband too. Deep down he knows Steve won’t end it all, but he’s still cautious and always hovering just in case.
Pepper dabs at her eyes with a tissue, cleaning up the black streaks left over from her ruined mascara. Her attempts to make herself appear presentable are futile. More tears gather in her eyes, ruining the bit of progress she’s made. It would be hopeless to try again, and with one last look in the mirror, she exits the bathroom.
They barely speak after their fight. Steve calls to check in on Peter, but other than that he doesn’t have anything to say to Tony. He comes by sometimes, but it’s to never talk and work things out. Tony gets it. It was his fault they were fighting again. So much for being closer.
“O-okay,” Peter stammers and glances around the large living room before gingerly lowering himself down on the expensive sofa. He wipes his palms over his jeans a couple of times before fiddling with his fingers again.
They break apart and she disappears down the hall. Steve takes a moment to compose himself before going back into the room. Harley is asleep again and Peter has just finished nursing. Bucky is holding him while Tony struggles to clean up the mess Peter has made on his shirt.
I just want to say thank you to everyone who’s enjoyed this story and left wonderful comments and kudos. To the ones that didn’t enjoy it...I’m sorry. I tagged everything correctly and this was intended to be a dark!Tony fic. I have nothing against him. He’s one of my favorite characters. I just wanted to try writing something different, and if that upset you then I’m sorry. But I’m not sorry for writing this piece.
Steve chuckles and leans back on his haunches. He gives a small shrug in response. “Guess I just wanted to surprise you. And thank you for lunch.”
The alpha hasn’t changed a bit. He’s dressed sharply in a charcoal gray suit and black dress shoes.His eyes still hold their icy stare and his lips still form into that monstrous smirk.
Steve’s eyes burn with tears and he has to squeeze them shut to prevent them from spilling. He doesn’t say anymore, knowing there was no point. Tony wasn’t going to change his mind.
The living room is another painful reminder that they wouldn’t have another chance to watch movies together. It was something they did after Steve would come home from missions or during any of his days off. Peter’s favorite thing was to show his papa all the movies he might have missed.
“No!” Peter tries to deny it, but it was obvious his papa could see right through him. He still firmly believed that he and Flash were still enemies. Maybe acquaintances now since they’ve started talking more, but Peter would never consider them friends. They were just two people having a baby. That was it.
Great. Guess there was no point in Tony asking if the results were accurate. Three positive tests was enough proof.
He didn’t know how to express his fear of a possible pregnancy when Tony was dealing with enough as it is. The moment they returned home Tony was left to meet with the press and tell his story. He didn’t go into a lot of details, making sure to leave out Steve and their pups. Steve wasn’t ready yet and Tony respected that. He’ll face the world one day.
Tony is still frowning. “Only because you get up too damn early. If you would’ve stayed in bed longer I probably would’ve sucked your dick.”
The first night is the hardest. Tony’s already awake by the time he hears Peter’s stirring. Pausing his work, Tony lays his Stark pad down and glances over, finding his son whimpering and squirming in the bassinet. Tony doesn’t even wait for the real crying to start before he’s reaching over to take his son into his arms.
The thought of calling his best friends comes to mind, but then he’s reminded of the mission they’re tied up in. His hiatus affected the team and they were left taking on more work. They had more than enough people now on the team, but his and Tony’s absence still created a hole.
“I don’t know,” Tony says, his voice quiet. He keeps his gaze locked on Morgan’s face, taking in her shiny, dark eyes. She stares up at him, smiling that smile he can’t get enough of. She has Steve’s smile.
Steve leaves, slamming the door on his way out. Tony rushes to the door and throws it open, peering out into the hall and watching Steve disappear. With a heavy sigh, Tony closes the door and leans against it, one hand running through his hair and tugging at the strands in frustration.
Steve glances down at his stomach, gently placing one hand over his still flat middle. He knows he needs to tell Tony. Maybe this is what would bring Tony back.
Peter nods. “I’m glad you’re okay,” Peter says and rises to his feet so that he can lean down to hug his uncle. As far as hugs go it’s awkward because of the state Sam is in, but it’s a hug Peter wouldn’t trade for anything.
“Yeah.” Steve nods and glances down to lock on Tony’s wandering hands. “Don’t try and wake him. For once he’s not pressing on my lungs and I can breathe.”
She hugs him and Steve allows the touch. It doesn’t compare to the ones Tony likes to give, but it helps calm him down all the same.
True to his word, Steve doesn’t bring up the idea of having another baby. Losing their son was too unbearable. Tony can’t help but feel relieved but also even more guilty than he already felt. All Steve wanted was to be happy and have a child. And Tony ruined it. He took everything from Steve.
“Come on. Take them off.” Tony reaches down to take Steve’s hand and place it on the hem of his briefs. Steve slides the article of clothing down until Tony’s cock is popping out and resting against his belly, leaking evidence of his arousal at the tip. Tony takes his cock in hand, stroking it from root to tip, a playful smirk appearing over his face when he finds Steve’s eyes dark with lust.
“I guess this is the part where you want me to say you were right and I was wrong?” Tony questions and Steve chuckles. “Fine. You were right. He’s not so bad. Happy now?”
It’s not long until Steve is following after and he cums with a shout of Tony’s name. He stills his hips, grunting as he releases his load. He pulls out slowly, his cock going limp.
His high school graduation was meant to be a joyous occasion, and to a certain extent it was. Peter had been able to walk onto the stage alongside his friends and accept his diploma. His family had been in the crowd, cheering and expressing how proud they were.
As soon as his papa leaves the room, Peter gags again and rushes for the toilet to start another grueling round.
Bucky gets up from the sofa to join Sam in the kitchen, opening the cupboards and taking out three plates to set the table with.
Peter smiles brightly and then rushes out of the apartment, making sure to call out, ‘I love you’ before closesing the door behind him.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Steve tells her when Morgan goes back into the kitchen for a glass of water. He pauses dinner to wrap her into a hug. “Thank you, sweetheart.”
“Tony!” Steve screams, gripping onto Tony as hard as he can. His legs give out and with Tony’s help he’s carefully lowered back down to the floor. Steve pants heavily when the contraction finally releases its hold on him. “Tony, the baby’s...I can’t...I can’t…”
Steve sniffs and wipes his tears away. He turns away from the window and tips his head back against the seat, his eyes squeezing shut. He grips Tony’s hand tightly.
Tony sighs harshly. His usual morning had taken all of the wrong turns. He should be in his conference call right now and then preparing for the new interns to arrive. But instead he finds himself in an isolated conference room with an omega he’s never met.
“You’re gonna be late,” Tony’s voice captures Steve’s attention. Tony sends Steve a smile over his shoulder before turning back to his original task.
“I know,” Tony agrees. “But I want another chance to prove I can be a better father. I don’t have this all figured out yet, and to be honest it’s going to take some time for me to fully grasp this whole parenting thing. But I need another shot.
Steve senses his son’s nervousness instantly. If he wouldn’t have discovered the truth than he would’ve just assumed that Peter was anxious about homework or a big test. But now he knows the nervous energy is because he doesn’t want anyone to know his secret. Steve can relate.
Steve kisses him again. Tony pulls Steve closer until their bodies are pressed up against each other. He uses both hands to cup Steve’s face and deepens the kiss, both moaning softly in response. Steve gasps when he’s pressed into the counter.
It’s her papa who comes home first with a sleepy Harley in his arms. Morgan expects her papa to come check on her after he puts her brother down for a nap, but he never does. He’s probably tired himself. It has to get exhausting being Captain America and a full-time father. He was always taking care of the world and his family; never himself.
“I hope so,” Steve still appears uneasy. It was going to take time for his children to warm up to the new people in their lives. They were all trying to adjust to this new life.
Tony didn’t think it was possible to be so nervous. He was usually more put together and full of confidence, but truth be told he wasn’t always as confident as people liked to assume. He had his moments where he didn’t feel worthy and it was times like that when he chose to hide away from the world. It was easier that way.
“I know. I think I better get him some flowers. Something. I don’t know. I really screwed up, Pep. I honestly don’t blame him for taking the ring off.”
“No. No, Steve, no.” Tony drops down to his knees besides Steve’s limp body, taking him into his arms and cradling him close. He quickly checks for a pulse, panicking when he can’t find one. “No. No, Steve, don’t do this. Don’t leave me.”
“I just don’t want to let you down. I hate seeing you so upset. Let’s see how it goes okay? Can we at least do that?”
The elevator he’s forced into is cramped and the musky smell the alphas give off waft through the air, making his nose wrinkle. He was used to alpha scents, having worked with a few in the past, but those didn’t compare to the ones he’s forced to inhale now. They weren’t the good ones, like Steve liked to say, and their scent was proof of that.
They both turn around and the larger man-Peter is able to read his badge and discovers he’d head of security- approaches, ready to block Peter from getting any closer.
“Did you have a good birthday? Or shower? We were celebrating both, right?” Tony chuckles as he carries armfuls of stuff up the stairs. He wouldn’t dare allow Steve to carry anything too heavy, which left the bags of clothes and bottles for Steve.
“Am I gonna benefit from this too or…” Tony peeks into the bag, frowning when he pulls out a set of outfits and socks. “Pep, you know red is my color. None of these are red.”
“Ah fuck!” Tony cries and he reaches out to pull Steve close and in for a kiss. Steve moves faster, desperate to get Tony off. “Come on, Steve. Harder!”
Steve frowns. The shirt had been orange with black letters that read: This Is My Halloween Costume. Long story short, Tony had not been amused.
The feed cuts off. The footage did nothing to awaken any memories from last night. If anything, it made Tony feel worse. He should’ve remembered something.
“Hey, Peter!” Ned’s cheery voice fills Peter’s ears. Peter turns, meeting the smiling face of his best friend. He looks away quickly to hide his disheveled appearance.
Fuck. Tony loved it when Steve started throwing out orders. That pesky voice is back, pointing out that Steve probably only considers this a quick fuck. Tony doesn’t want to listen, even though deep down he knows that’s exactly what this was.
“I’m not doing that. I’m not forcing him to like a color because society says it’s meant for one gender only. And there is blue...with some white and red. It’s your birthday too so maybe I should add-”
“Not forever. I’m thinking of stepping away, for good this time. We can try living in Brooklyn, have a normal life.”
“How was school?” Bucky asks. He’s still playing with his new friend. Peter’s just happy to see him distracted and smiling again.
“One glass won’t hurt,” Tony says as he pours himself and Steve a glass. “You need something to take off the edge anyway.”
He glances down, eyes scanning over Steve’s blissed expression and then to the fresh mark on his neck. Tony leans closer to press a kiss to the bite mark he’s left behind, gently lapping at the spot with his tongue.
“No this one is...anyway, yeah it could be mine and I have to help him out. We didn’t exactly bond or anything-”
“I won’t. I promise.” Natasha pulls away and brushes away the hair that’s fallen in her nephew’s face. “I’m sorry I can’t be him, but I’m still here for you no matter what. I love you.”
“You’re doing good, sweetheart,” Tony whispers and brings their connected hands up to his lips, placing a kiss to Steve’s knuckles.
Steve waits to continue, only his body has other ideas and it bears down against his own volition. He whines through gritted teeth when the burning sensation between his legs worsens. His palm is still cupping the small head. More of his pup emerges, sliding out to its shoulders. Steve tilts his head back and pants, desperately wanting a break from the excruciating pain.
The only thing furnishing the room is an old wooden breeding bench. Tony’s heard stories about them, but he never thought he’d see one.They had stopped being used years ago. They were humiliating and unfair to omegas. It was inhuman. The times have changed and there was no reason for omegas to be strapped down and bred anymore.
“T-Tony.” Steve manages to get out his bloodied lips. He tries to speak again, but all that comes out is a painful groan when he’s thrown down and hits the hard floor beneath him. Steve finds the strength to lift himself and he crawls toward Tony, desperate to feel his alpha’s comforting touch. “Tony. Tony, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Yay Steve has his babies back! I’ll explain more in the next chapter, and then of course Tony needs to find out about them.
Steve blows out a breath and feels himself bear down against the pressure. It feels right and he takes another breath before doing it again. He grunts softly and continues to push.
Tears gather in his eyes and a choked sob escapes him. His legs wobble again and this time he’s unable to hold himself up. He falls to the floor, his head hitting the edge of the bed. The flare of pain doesn’t affect him. Not when he was feeling something more painful.
Hydra and Pierce were gone, but there was no telling if and when they’d come back. Tony wanted to hold onto the idea of them being gone forever, but he knew better than to get his hopes up.
“I think,” Pepper starts with a warm smile. “You, Tony Stark, can be a dad. Just don’t take that poor kid into the lab with you!”
She pulls off the bottle, her face scrunching up and small cries escaping her pouty lips. Tony shushes her gently and places the bottle back to her lips, sighing when she refuses to latch on. He wonders how Steve had done this.
Steve rolls his eyes and leans back in the chair, sighing softly and placing a hand over his belly. “No, but we need to think of something. We can’t keep calling him Tony Jr.”
A wave of guilt crashes over him, rearranging the thoughts in his head and making him reconsider. He tries to rid his head of those thoughts, reminding himself that this was the only way. But he can’t do it.
“Sweetie, what’s wrong?” Natasha asks, worry evident in her tone. Morgan only clutches onto her tighter.
Peter is shocked from the blunt response. He almost expected Flash to at least think about it before immediately jumping to not wanting the baby, but Peter is on the same page. Or at least he was when he first found out.
“You didn’t have to do this,” Steve says, his way of trying to thank the pair for spending time with his children. They were still strangers after all.
“Come on,” Steve urges softly, carefully adjusting his son and bringing him closer to his chest. Another whimper is made until finally the baby is latching onto Steve’s offered nipple. Steve smiles down at his son. “There you go.”
“Please?” Steve says softly. His eyes are still closed and his breathing has started to even out. Tony knows he’ll be out any minute now.
The rest of the day passes with a blur. Peter was sure his classes would help keep him distracted, but he couldn’t be more wrong. No matter how hard he tried to focus on the lessons, he just couldn’t. All he could think about was his father.
Inviting a complete stranger into his vehicle was one thing. Inviting a complete stranger into his home...well, that was something entirely different.
Steve gives him another hug before setting him down. Peter runs off to the living room. Tony waits until he’s out of earshot before turning back to Steve.
Steve snaps his head up at the sound of the familiar voice, finding Natasha standing near the sofa with her arms folded and an amused grin on her face.
“Sorry.” Tony can’t help but wince. “Maybe this was too much. Simple probably would’ve been better.”
Tony was the first person on the new list of people Steve felt he could trust. Pepper and Happy...he couldn’t say for sure. The omega seemed harmless and her scent didn’t give off any bad vibes, but Steve was still wary. The beta was another story. He had been against Steve the moment they met. Not that Steve could blame him. They were strangers.
“You’re gonna make me fall asleep,” Tony mumbles. Steve peers down at him, smiling when he finds his husband already drifting to sleep.
“Yeah. There’s no rush. We can wait.” Tony smiles. He personally wants to get a start on their son’s nursery, but he knows how tired Steve must be feeling. He was the one who just had a baby.
Steve rushes to get the car seat when Morgan starts to cry. He soothes her and adjusts the blanket around her, then he’s leaving the apartment.
They’re instructed to take a seat at the table, and both Steve and Tony gingerly lower themselves down in leather seats. Nick and Maria take the two seats on the opposite side of the table.
Ned sighs again. It’s obvious he doesn’t agree with Peter not telling any adults, but he doesn’t voice his opinion. He’d be loyal like he always has been.
“Yes! Everything’s good. We’re getting along and raising our son. Marriage isn’t even on the table.”
Another contraction begins to build, not giving Steve a break from the last one, and he cries out from the intense pain. Bucky can only hold him and encourage him.
Steve only groans in response. He can’t hold off and he pushes again, whining through gritted teeth when a burning sensation builds between his legs.
Steve screams again, doing as Tony instructed and pushing as hard as he can. The baby’s head continues to emerge, only to slip back slightly when Steve eases off. “Fuck...Tony, I can’t...I can’t.”
Bruce nods again and disappears from the room. Steve watches as they go, keeping his eyes glued to the door they stepped through. It was like he had been transported back in time. He’s just welcomed another pup into the world, only to have it taken away.
Tony whines, the sound so foreign to his own ears. It wasn’t a noise an alpha usually produced; their growls and snarls was their signature sound. But Steve was doing something to him. It was like their roles had been switched and Tony was the one begging.
“Oh right. Yeah. What if we take turns tonight? At least that way if it doesn’t work for me then we know it probably will work for you.”
He had figured Steve would’ve gone to stay with one of their friends until he was calm enough to work things out. But there was nothing to work out. Steve had made it clear that he was done. And it was all Tony’s fault.
She could stay with her aunt for a few days or a week or maybe even a few years. Auntie Nat knew what it was like to not have a home. Maybe she’d be more understanding.
The times were different now. The world was more accepting of omegas. But some things never change. Bad alphas were always going to be around.
Tony’s almost there. Steve must sense it too because he wraps a hand around the shaft, stroking it the way Tony likes. The combination of Steve’s hot mouth and the friction of his hand is what brings Tony over the edge. He grunts and holds Steve’s head down as he releases in his mouth.
“I got you, honey,” Tony promises and joins Steve on the bed, hovering over him and ducking his head down to kiss him.
“It was then. Omegas back then weren’t respected and they sure as hell didn’t get a voice to speak up. I was tired of living that way. I was tired of seeing all of us treated so poorly while alphas controlled everything. I wanted to make a difference. I fought for their rights, they looked up to me.”
Oh Tony *sighs* He's trying. Poor thing still doesn't know the whole story, but we're getting there! I will update soon!
Parenting four pups was a struggle, but it was worth the hardships. A family was what Steve had wanted for a long time. At one point it seemed as if he’d never get the simple life he envisioned for himself, but life had other plans and he was granted the greatest blessing in the world.
More tears are running down Steve’s face now. He never thought he’d ever have to experience the pain that came with losing a child. It wasn’t fair that this happened. It wasn’t fair that the baby they loved was gone.
For the most part it does the trick. Peter’s eyes bright up, and not just from the tears. His eyes are a little red and puffy, but at least he had stopped crying. Maybe he was getting stronger.
Steve sighs and leans back into the counter, folding his arms around his chest. He often wondered if he was good enough for someone like Tony. There wasn’t supposed to be a such thing as perfection. Lord knows he was far from it, despite Alpha calling him a perfect omega. Steve wasn’t perfect. He was damaged. Ruined and didn’t deserve anything.
They were better off friends. At least, that’s what Steve wanted to believe. But even a friendship was becoming difficult to manage. They had to make it work somehow. If not for themselves, then for their son.
Steve curls under the blankets and rests his head on the pillow, inhaling the familiar scent of the alpha downstairs. His scent was musky like all alpha’s had, but underneath that was his personal aroma. Coffee. Grease. Expensive cologne. Those were the scents Steve picked up on the most. It was comforting.
Steve wraps his legs around Tony’s waist to bring him closer, crying out when Tony goes deeper. Tony starts to move, rocking his hips slowly. He’s unable to keep up the slow pace and he thrusts faster, the sound of their hips meeting echoing in the room.
His skin is fair and unblemished; the pink hue that has spread across it is the only thing that taints it. His hair is golden, bright like the sun. Tony wishes he could see his face, but with the blindfold secured around his eyes, Tony’s wish can’t be granted.
“What?” Steve asks and then he glances down at the test in his hands, for a moment forgetting what he was holding. “No! No it’s not mine. I’m not pregnant.”
“Uncle Sam told me to leave you alone but…” Peter trails off and enters the room. He approaches his uncle and sits down beside him, his eyes flickering toward the item clutched tightly in his uncle’s fist.
Bruce shakes his head disapprovingly, and Tony waits for another lecture to come. But it never does.
“Wait…” Ned frowns. Peter can practically see his friend trying to piece together the puzzle. He’s wearing the same expression he wears when trying to solve an equation.
It’s Tony who moans this time. He grinds against Steve’s hand, chasing after more of the friction. Steve’s hand keeps going, playing with the belt Tony regrets wearing, and unbuckling it.
Another sob builds in Steve’s throat. He squeezes his eyes tighter to prevent any more tears from falling, but then they shoot open when his head is turned to the side. His eyes immediately land on his alpha.
Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s back, taking over and thrusting roughly into the omega. Steve comes again, wetness splashing over Tony’s cock and the sheets. Tony reaches his release, grunting against Steve’s neck as he comes.
“It’s okay,” Sam assures softly, his hand soothingly trailing up and down Bucky’s back. “I don’t care about the sink. Just you.”
They’re asked to step outside and wait. Tony is able to relax now and enjoy his drink without their presence.
Pretty soon it was going to be Steve in that room surrounded by unfamiliar faces and scents and having to tell his story. He purposely wants to leave out some details of his life. No one needed to know he was an omega from the forties who went up against alpha natzis and tried to stop their control, only to fail and wake up nearly seventy years later under the very control he had tried to stop.
“I got him,” Sam rushes toward the pup and scoops him up before he can get into any trouble. “What are you doing, huh?” Sam asks and tickles the pup, causing Harley to giggle.
“No,” Steve sighs and he glances around the aisle they’re currently in, glad to find it’s just them. “Pete needs more things. I guess it would’ve been easier to ask FRIDAY to do it but…”
