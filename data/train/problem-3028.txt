Dean led Sam to the basement, observing with satisfaction how his eyes widened when he saw the portal. Not an unexpected reaction, given how impressive the stone arch looked. Dean wished he could tell his brother something more about it, but there wasn’t anything to tell. After their séance with Josie they decided to try finding out who’d built it, so far without any results. The structure was so old that any written records about it were probably long gone. But who knows, maybe one day they would get lucky and find something.
Dean shook his head. “You saved me today, Cas. Shit goes wrong all the time, and the important thing is how you react to it. You were fast enough to kill the beast and save my life and that’s what counts.”
“You’re awful, you know?” Hannah punched him in the arm. “I’m revoking your ‘favorite brother’ status until the end of the day.”
“I’m just excited about bowling, okay?” Dean mumbled defensively. The plan was to enjoy the evening wherever it goes, and he was going to stick to it. At the moment that meant bowling. Maybe later it would mean something else.
“Oh, come on!” she said. “You’ve been disappearing into that forest almost for the whole week. Don’t you think we want to meet him too? He’s a
Then came the day when there was nothing more to do. Everything was planned and packed; Charlie, Ruby, and Anna had everything under control in the house. Dean and Cas could finally leave, start their journey across another world. They said their goodbyes and took off, leaving everything and everyone they knew behind.
It was still quite early and the Roadhouse was empty and quiet, Jo and Ellen nowhere to be seen. Dust motes danced in the light coming through the windows, the whole place smelling like wood and old smoke.
“They seem… afraid,” he added after a while, putting down the pen and looking at Dean. “Whatever is happening, they have no control over it and no knowledge of what it is.”
“Very well.” The princess didn’t seem to be put off by Dean’s frankness. “The portal was built to link our two worlds, and on both sides guardians were appointed to keep the path safe. They were the only ones that could open and close the door. For centuries it was a bustling trade route and we got many visitors from your side; many of our own people visited yours. Years ago, though, something changed, and the traffic slowly dwindled until the only person still visiting us was the guardian herself. Most of the Old Grove citizens forgot about the portal’s existence. Then, some day, the guardian stopped too, and the portal remained closed on your side.”
“Sorry,” he muttered, looking around. Chills crept all over his body. Before them was the same tree he’d seen in his nightmares for more than half his life. The same gnarled trunk and twisted branches reaching towards him, the same bent roots sticking out from the ground. There was a second when he felt like the tree was calling him. His head was spinning, his heart beating faster.
“Okay. Okay.” Dean tried to calm himself. “I’m not going to be a baby about this. But hey, can you at least do the same dream walking thing with Sam and tell him I’m alright when I’m already dead?”
Jo talked to one of the princess’ advisors about the purpose of their visit, and they were led to a small chamber with a bunch of wooden chairs and a tiny table, where they were left to wait. Dean moved to the window, taking in the astonishing view of the forest. Cas joined him a few seconds later, resting against the windowsill only a few inches away. The air between them felt charged, and Dean made his best not to move, silently wishing Castiel had a notion of personal space.
Josie laughed sadly. The room became even colder. “I certainly wished that was the case. But no, we were good friends. Henry would never leave his wife, not for me, not for anyone else.”
He finally saw his gun, lying a few feet away. As he picked it up, he caught movement with the corner of his eye. A dark shape creeped closer behind Dean, readying itself to jump.
“Uh, thanks,” he said, feeling his throat clenching. He had no idea what else to say. Conversations like this shouldn’t happen with people you knew for less than a week. Not that it would be that much better if he’d known Castiel for years. Actually, it would probably just make him run away, like had happened with Benny, and even with Charlie and Jo.
“Those two already saw the city.” Jo pointed Dean and Cas with her head. “But what would you say to a tour later, just the two of us?”
They ran into a bigger patch of trees not covered with slime, and everything was so quiet and peaceful there that it was hard to believe there was anything bad going on.
Ellen didn’t even flinch at his sudden greeting. “Hi, Dean,” she said, putting the glass down. Dean had a theory her nerves were made out of steel and therefore nothing could scare her. “New guest?” she asked, giving Sam the once-over.
“Me too, Dean,” Castiel smiled, bumping him with his shoulder. The setting sun painted his face with gold hues and Dean really wanted to take another photo. He resisted the urge and smiled back.
“I don’t know what I’d do without you,” Dean said softly, adjusting the bag of ice on his ribs, while Cas finished dressing his back.
“If you think that’s going to help,” Castiel said, shrugging, and disappeared without any further comments.
“As far as we know I’m your only successor,” Dean chimed in. “And I had no idea about the portal until a few weeks ago.”
The room was dark but Dean could feel something moving in it, the same alien presence he felt earlier. A single beam of light shot from somewhere above, illuminating a tangled mass of tendrils and tentacles in the middle of the floor. They moved up, entwining together until they formed a familiar shape. Cas. He looked at Dean with empty eyes, black slime oozing out of his nose and ears. His shirt was stained with blood, an oval hole in it, revealing a circle of rotting flesh where the monster had bitten him.
“Maybe you could finish one of your stories,” Cas murmured, moving closer. To distract Dean, to distract them both. They had this game, where Dean told Cas old tales and they both pretended to be main characters in them. Their own version of Arabian Nights, with him never finishing a story, so Cas would always have to come back to hear the rest of it.
He took the map from Castiel, folded it and stowed in his back pocket. “At least we have it mapped for now, that’s something.”
“I’ll see what I can do, boy,” Bobby sighed. “And tell my daughter that her mother expects her and Charlie at dinner as soon as you finish that hunt. I swear, that girl just never calls home anymore.”
“I can sprinkle myself with lemon zest and hop on a grill if that would make you feel better.” Dean grinned.
“Shit, I still have to go back for my car and then pray not to fall asleep behind the wheel on my way home,” he groaned, leaning back in his seat. It was less than ideal in any scenario.
The forest around him grew denser, shrubs and vines replacing cobblestone roads between the roots. The muddy path before him was dark, with no lanterns to light the way. That didn’t stop him from moving forward.
slow, Dean not wanting to fuck anything up, but sleeping in one bed shouldn’t be a big deal. They’d been together for over two months, it wasn’t going to ruin anything. He still felt his skin buzzing with a mix of nervousness and excitement when he entered his room. Castiel, on the other hand, seemed totally relaxed, like this wasn’t anything unusual for them. Damn those imaginary friends.
Two days later Dean was parking his car in front of a small inn in Oak Mill. The old building with its wooden porch and white windows was almost exactly like in his memories, except someone had repainted it recently, giving it a more presentable look.
Dean didn’t sleep much that night. It seemed like hours passed in slow motion. The afternoon found him pacing back and forth next to Castiel’s bed. The helplessness was going to kill him. He needed to be able do something, to help Cas somehow, not to just sit around and wait. But waiting was the only thing he could do. Waiting and hoping that Cas would get better.
was the one who broke into someone’s house. His pink shirt was rumpled, its sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He stood close enough for Dean to see that his eyes were unbelievably blue, bringing to mind a deep ocean. Dean would be happy to appreciate his good looks if only he wasn’t a total stranger doing who knows what in Dean’s room.
“Very funny,” Dean muttered, capturing Cas’ lips. Castiel put his arms around him, pulling him even closer. They kissed, and then the kiss gradually turned into a hug, Dean resting his head on Cas’ shoulder. He possibly had slightly wet eyes, but he would never admit that. Something in him melted, a great weight disappeared from his chest. There was a part of him still angry at himself, at Cas, at
“Yeah, but we would run out of food at some point before that. But except for the food, it wouldn’t be that bad. Maybe. If we had to.”
Cas’ heart sped up rapidly. “Okay. Great,” he said, lightheaded. He had to fight an urge to pinch himself to check if it wasn’t a dream. Dean was real, his words were real. Castiel lived in a reality where Dean loved him back, and it made him so awfully happy that he was close to exploding.
There’s something wrong with Dean’s throat when he tries to swallow. “Thanks,” he mutters, ignoring the growing lump. Once again he doesn’t ask about Castiel.
anything. Then I stumbled upon the real deal. A bunch of shapeshifters messing with people’s lives. That could’ve ended up pretty badly for me, I had no idea
did not want to be there anymore. Whatever he was going to find, it certainly wasn’t anything good. He should go back. He wasn’t prepared for a fight.
“Fucking shit, help!” he cried out, his foot slipping away under a root, his heart almost jumping out of his chest. There was a very low chance that anyone would hear it, but at this point he had nothing to lose. He moved as fast as he could among the tangled wood, hoping the animal wouldn’t be able to follow.
“It’s my fault we ended up sleeping in the park, it’s only natural for me to make it up to you somehow.”
They leave in the early morning on the last day, wanting to cover as much road as possible before nightfall. The city is still silent when they say their goodbyes to Bobby and Sam, who promise to visit sometime in the future, when Dean and Cas are settled.
Dean sat on the porch with a beer in his hand, admiring the view. They were alone in the house; all the guests were out in Old Grove, so they had the evening to themselves. Dean would prefer to spend it making out on the couch, but apparently Cas had other plans. It was hard to believe Dean had lost against a bunch of flowers, but he did his best to take that loss with pride.
“If that’s how you call it,” Castiel nodded. “It seems to me that most people don’t believe in… spirits, for example. And yet, here you are, acting as if things like this were nothing new for you,” he explained further.
Soon thousands of lanterns soared in the air, illuminating the night, yellow specks of light in the dark sky. Dean and Cas released theirs together, watching with their heads tilted back as they flew away. Dean didn’t know what to wish for, leaving that part to Castiel. Hopefully he was better at it than Dean. Somewhere in the distance, music started playing and people around moved with it, singing quietly.
Michael’s expression when he looked at them was full of distaste. “If I leave, Anna leaves with me.”
They were supposed to spend the last two weeks of December in the bunker, with everyone else. That obviously hadn't happened. Somehow, they had ended up in this small cabin on Christmas Day, far away from the world, buried under a thick layer of snow.
The month passed fast and Charlie, Cas and Dean turned up in the Roadhouse on a midsummer day, unsure what to expect. Dean had to admit Jo was very good at keeping secrets. She appeared not long after they’d gathered, walking from upstairs with four bags of colorful powder. “You will need this,” she said, handing the bags to them.
They’d walked around for a while, talking aimlessly, and finally ended up on a bench in Cas’ favorite spot near the pond, hidden from the view behind hydrangea shrubs. The place was quiet and secluded, perfect to sit down away from more crowded alleys. Castiel liked bringing others there — usually one of his sisters or Dean. It always felt like sharing some kind of a secret, and he wanted the people he cared about to be a part of it.
“It’s not far when you have a portal leading there in the basement,” Dean said. Charlie was a witch with toads popping up out of thin air around her; portals to other worlds probably weren’t going to be anything new.
Wind swayed the branches, breaking the silence of the forest, and for a few seconds the boy thought he saw something out of the corner of his eye. He instinctively moved the flashlight that way, but the space between the trees was empty. He sighed with relief, not sure what he’d expected.
They talked a lot. About what Dean did, about the people he had in his life now. About movies, old and new. About everything that came to Dean’s mind. Then there were the stolen kisses and touches, becoming bolder and more confident every time they met. Dean bitterly wished they had been braver in the past and allowed themselves to have this when Castiel had been alive.
“I have an idea,” he starts. “About what to do now, I mean. I, um. When my Mom died a few years ago, I did some traveling. I went far to the south, stayed a bit in a city there. Met a bunch of awesome people. I haven’t seen them in a while. So, I don’t know, we could go and visit them? And then figure out what we want, without having to rush anything.” He thinks about Ellen and Jo and their bar, and about Charlie, who probably has a spell for everything. It would be good to be able to see some familiar faces when they leave Haven.
“They’re not that uncommon, though they usually don’t show themselves to people.” Cas gently scratched the dreameater behind its ears. “This one here probably got drunk on all the magic coursing through the walls and that caused him to become visible.”
Cas sighed. He always knew what was on Dean’s mind. “Dean, everything will be alright. I will come back in a few months.”
“Dean, wait.” Jo got up too, grabbing his arm. “We don’t know where exactly he is! We can’t search the whole forest now!”
” Dean groaned, pulling out his phone. He spent the next ten minutes explaining the situation to Bobby.
“We have skyscrapers made of glass, and museums full of dragon bones,” Castiel weighed in. “It all depends on how you look at things.”
Dean sighed with resignation. “I don’t have a say about this, do I?” He wasn’t going to get rid of the dreameater if it became Castiel’s favorite pet. To be honest, the creature had started growing on him too, so maybe it was better that way. But Breadloaf was a stupid name.
“I don’t know,” Lisa rubbed her shoulders. “Everything else seemed normal.” She shook her head, sighing. “I should have paid more attention.”
Two days later Castiel came to the inn looking slightly agitated. He’d heard someone in the forest, a voice talking in an unknown language. This time it didn’t sound like just a random person. He wanted to follow, but the slime stopped him before he got close enough to see anything.
“Well, it is,” Dean said, his voice a little too gruff probably. “After some time you get used to it.”
“You think this is it?” Jo asked, taking the book from Charlie and examining it closer. “He wants to summon some gods?”
see it,” Dean argued. Even at that moment he could see the faint shape of antlers and many eyes staring at him with the same intensity he saw on Cas’ face.
“More like a result of misguided concern.” He did his best to sound dismissive. “And once she sets her mind on something, there’s no way to talk her out of it. She
“Uh, fine.” Jo paused. “Let’s meet in an hour. Charlie is still at Moore’s place right now.” She sighed. “I tried to get any additional info from the police, but no dice. I guess it was worth a try, though they probably don’t know anything useful anyway.” She sounded disappointed nonetheless.
Bobby drops in a few times to shout at Dean for his stupidity and tell him he's going to miss him. Sam does that too, but he also helps a lot. A couple of other friends come to say goodbye, though most people avoid Dean and Cas now, the Archstone incident never officially explained. It stings, but explanation wouldn’t be possible without telling everyone that Castiel was an angel, so maybe it’s better that way.
That was unexpected. Or maybe not, if Dean thought about it. “Let me guess, it started when I moved in,” he said, trying to keep his voice neutral. Castiel stayed silent. “Fuck.” Dean looked away, licking his lips. “I knew this was just too good to last. I knew it.” Of course he and Cas would have to break up if Castiel wanted to stay an imaginary friend. Cas would have to leave. Cas would have to leave and Dean didn’t know if he would be able to continue his life without him, now that he knew how it was to have him around, to wake up every morning next to him. It felt like his world was ending.
When the first bell rang Dean found himself sitting across from a stylish businesswoman named Kali, who looked like she could kill him with one glance if he gave her a wrong answer. He wasn’t sure whether it was the incredibly red lipstick, or just her general aura of
“Ice cream it is.” He nodded, doing his best to focus on the present. They turned around the corner, reaching one of the main streets, which was far more crowded than the quiet alley they’d just left. It helped in some way, anchoring him to reality. The thing that mattered was that he and Cas wanted to spend time together. The rest was just details. “Now, back to the important stuff, I wanna hear everything about your bet.”
Dean snorted. It had to be the dumbest excuse he’d ever heard. “Yeah, right. Now imagine yourself out of my house before I call the police.”
what I was doing.” To tell the truth Dean still had no idea what he was doing far too often, but he wasn’t as bad at this as when he’d started. “Fortunately for me, there was another guy hunting those shifters, Henricksen. He was an FBI agent, too, which helped a lot with getting rid of the evidence incriminating me for the stuff one of them did.” To this day Dean felt chills every time he thought that his hunter career could have ended in jail before it even began for good.
Dean took a sip of his coffee. “First, think back to before Ben disappeared. Anything unusual caught your attention? Something strange, hard to explain?”
Cas narrowed his eyes. “I’m not going to share the deepest twin secrets with you, Dean,” he stated in a voice so serious that Dean couldn’t stop himself from laughing.
“Yeah.” Dean hoped nobody noticed how weak his voice sounded. He’d agreed to this cover story when they’d talked about coming there, but now he partially wished he’d decided to pretend to be someone else. “A part of me always regretted leaving everyone behind, never checking how they’re doing.” It was only half a lie. “So, I see you run an inn now?”
He visited three more libraries, without any luck. The internet wasn’t much help either, search results showing mostly articles that treated imaginary friends as figments of imagination, and a few creepy ghost stories that didn’t look real.
He hoped Castiel would stay with him on the couch, though. Too much time had passed since he had someone he could just fall asleep with, and he didn't want to wait any longer. Not when Cas was right there.
Cas looked away. “I was unable to take human form for years. When I succeeded, there wasn’t anything for me to come back to.”
Benny put the knife away. “Come on, Dean, I’m not an idiot. I don’t believe you’d decide to come here on an impulse, you were always far too stubborn for that. And those friends of yours are going around and asking about missing people, not the best way to have fun if you ask me.”
The sun was setting, dark shadows growing longer, when they finished cleaning all the bedrooms. All that was left were the bathrooms, the attic and the basement, and Dean suggested they should leave it for another day, stretching his sore muscles. Castiel agreed, though he didn’t seem tired at all, and Dean envied him a little for that.
“You weren’t that far yet, Dean. You were still close enough for the trees to help you. I wouldn’t be able to get there personally.” Castiel explained, turning around. “Come, I’ll show you the way out.”
“You should check this out,” Dean said, holding up a pair of large gold medallion earrings. It was more a joke than anything else, but part of him wanted to see Castiel in them for real.
Of course, Castiel had no trouble with getting the little monster out. The blackball of fur actually
“I look as I choose to. I decided that a human form would be easiest for you to accept.” For some reason Cas’ voice sounded odd.
“I don’t know.” Cas shrugged, and then took a deep breath. “I was conjured years ago by a young girl named Claire Novak. She was an only child with a powerful imagination; a perfect combination to create an imaginary friend.” Apparently not only Dean was in a sharing mood.
After the seventh person he talked to, he promised himself he was going to endure one more mini-date and then bail, no matter the consequences. Who knows, maybe surviving over the half of the provided torment would be enough to appease Charlie. He approached his last date with a smile that was almost genuine. Only seven more minutes and he was going to be free from this hell.
Dean lay still on the ground, his shirt bloody and ripped. The beast was next to him, a pool of blood forming next to its head and slowly sinking between the leaves. It looked almost like a giant cat, with the exception of big, scaly spikes on its back. There had been a time when Castiel could have gotten rid of it with a flick of his fingers. Not anymore.
They stayed like that, huddled together, as the moon moved above, until it hid behind the trees, leaving the dark, starry sky behind. Dean felt warm, at peace. The stars seemed to swirl in circles, releasing tendrils that reached far beyond the horizon. It had been a good evening, he thought right before his eyelids became too heavy to keep them open. He could still see the night sky, as he drifted away.
“It seems we both fell prey to our friends in some way,” Castiel said, his voice somewhere between serious and joking. He didn’t seem to expect any details and Dean was thankful for that. “But at least we’ve met each other in the process, so there’s still a chance to salvage the evening.” He had a point. Dean was never going to admit that to Charlie, but maybe forcing him to go speed dating wasn’t the worst idea she’d ever had.
After the initial shock, Sam took everything pretty well. He listened to Dean with attention, and asked occasional questions when something wasn’t clear. Talking to him about all that had happened came to Dean so naturally he was surprised by it. It was a relief to share the stories with his brother, to see someone else not accustomed to magic react to them. Dean should’ve done this months ago. Too bad he had been too afraid Sam wouldn’t believe in any of it. Better late than never though.
“I wasn’t going to leave without a good reason. Why give them the satisfaction?” Cas stated, as his gaze snapped to the street lamps and the tiny balls of light dancing around them. Dean could see all the little details of his face again, including eye crinkles and a small scar on his upper lip. Somehow it made Castiel seem more like a real person, not just a random date.
“Wait, you can’t just drop something like that on us and then go without explaining it,” Dean protested. If there was something dangerous in the house, he needed to know what.
“I used to pretend I was Batman, swooping in to save my city,” he grunted, his grip firm on the rope. “Sammy refused to play Robin after he turned eight or so.” One push with his feet and he was moving, cool air washing over his face. He barely had enough time to pull himself up and place his legs on the seat before hitting full speed. It wasn’t nearly as thrilling as it used to be, but he still yelled in excitement passing Cas.
Dean opened and closed his mouth a few times. He couldn’t believe they were having this conversation. “I don’t know how to break it to you, but I live in this house too.”
By the time Castiel arrived at Dean’s place he’d managed to mostly calm down, but his calmness disappeared as soon as Dean opened the door. He looked gorgeous. There was a happy glint in his eyes and his face was still covered in gold freckles after the summer. Castiel had seen him a few days ago, but somehow this time everything felt so different and new, like he could properly see Dean for the first time in his life. It was maddening.
The fog came again. Another person went missing and it left everyone in a bad mood. They had no new leads, and their best achievement was convincing Sheriff Mills to keep people away from the forest. They had to figure out how to search the damaged parts of the woods without the risk of getting attacked by the slime, and in Cas’ case a way to actually get anywhere near those parts. And they had to do it quickly.
Dean felt his knees weaken under him, not sure if he understood what Cas was implying. “Take me back.”
They fell asleep tangled together, Dean stroking Cas’ hair and Cas hogging all the sheets. It was much better than the night in the park. Not only because they didn’t have to lie on the ground, but also because whatever happened next, Dean knew Castiel was sticking with him.
Lisa hid her face in her hands, laughing nervously. “Oh god, I’m so desperate. Who would’ve thought I’m going to trust a boy I knew years ago, whose work I know nothing about, to find my son.”
And okay, there was a faint whisper in the back of his mind that maybe he was wrong, maybe he was going to meet someone who would make this whole charade worth it, but he stomped that voice down right away, before he could embarrass himself any further.
The mental image worked like a bucket of cold water. Dean sat up so fast his head started spinning again. Cas, still oblivious, only whined in protest at the loss of his Dean-shaped pillow. Well. So much for his help.
But it was better not to get his hopes up even higher — he already started expecting to see this dream version of Castiel every night. He wondered briefly if those dreams meant he was finally losing it. He brushed that thought away.
The panther looked at him with its head tilted, sniffing his chest. Dean didn’t dare to move, holding his breath and looking the animal in the eyes. If he thought about it, the panther looked kind of familiar, but he couldn’t place his finger on why. He definitely didn’t know any black panthers. The most logical explanation was that his scared shitless mind was grasping at straws, looking for a sign that he could still come out of the situation alive. He didn’t know how, exactly, knowing the panther would help, but better friend than stranger.
speed dating.” Castiel gave him a smug smile, his eyes shining. “No one said I’m supposed to stay till the end.”
He froze dumbfounded in the middle of a foreign meadow, not knowing what to say, taking in the sight of Castiel standing before him. And Cas, with his stupid hair, and stupid eyes, and stupid trenchcoat, just smiled. And there was something sad in his smile. Maybe he too knew he couldn’t be anything more than a dream.
As Dean is moved to the front, he notices Missouri, but it’s hard to say from her expression whether she succeeded. There are other people he knows, too. He sees Bobby and Sam, both giving him grim, concerned looks. Sam has dark bags under his eyes. So they know. Everyone in Haven probably knows; it would be naive to assume anything else. Somehow Dean didn’t think about that before. He tries to grin when he passes Sam. He can feel it didn’t come out right.
Finally the anger disappears. It leaves Dean strangely hollow. For a moment he toys with the idea of trying to escape, but the cell surely is spellproof and there’s nothing that could help him get through the bars. The only thing he can do is wait.
“We can put him in one of the rooms upstairs,” Jo said with a huff, helping him carry Castiel up the stairs. “And I’m going to send someone to get Missouri. If there’s a problem with his magic, she should be able to help.”
“Well, you certainly act like you are,” Hannah said pointedly. “I don’t think Mom would be able to tell the difference.”
Castiel looked at his bleeding torso with confusion. “I don’t understand. The wound should’ve closed already.”
Webs. Enormous, thick webs, spreading between trees, wrapped around them, covering everything, forming a gigantic cocoon. Charlie took out a machete and started cutting through them. “If there’s a giant spider inside, I’m going to scream. And then probably stab him in one of his eyes.”
Dean’s stomach growled, reminding him about the pie. A trip to Old Grove without breakfast wasn’t something he wanted to do, but baking would have to wait. “Just let me grab something to eat and we’ll take you there,” he said, pointing Charlie to the kitchen, and resigning himself to a sandwich.
“I am.” He nodded. At some point talking to Cas had become… pleasant? What the fuck. “You said you have sisters? How many?”
Missouri had come as fast as she could, bringing potions and herbs with her, and an air of hope Dean desperately needed. She’d concluded that the bite was poisoned and even though she had something to fight the poison off, only time would show if Castiel would recover. His chances were good, given that he wasn’t human, but at the same time the whole situation shouldn't have happened at all so it was hard to tell how he would react to the treatment.
Castiel’s voice sounded just like Dean remembered, deep and warm. And this greeting, the greeting he had been so used to many years ago, made him feel like he was finally home.
“Okaay,” Charlie continued, her voice a little too innocent. “And is someone from the town cutting down the trees to produce iron and weapons? Have you seen a princess riding a wolf? A giant boar maybe?”
Castiel came back half an hour later, angry and empty handed. During that time Dean, Jo and Charlie had sat Benny and Andrea down in their kitchen, and briefly explained what was going on, after deciding it was the best course of action. They received information about Billy Benton in return, and then both Benny and Andrea decided they need a drink.
So. Now Dean can be sure that Cas isn't there. That leaves him with a few possible conclusions, all of them bad. Maybe when Castiel got his grace back he wasn't the same person anymore. Maybe he didn't care about Haven or Dean. Maybe he just left, going back home. Or maybe something went very, very wrong and it didn't work at all. And Castiel just died there, on the top of the Archstone tower. And there's no Cas at all.
His mind involuntarily moved from the shopping list to the movie night he was planning with Cas. They still hadn’t decided what they were going to watch, and knowing Cas he would make Dean see
They approached the bar, Dean catching snippets of conversations from the tables they passed, and sat on the stools next to Charlie. She didn’t even notice them, absently ogling Jo.
He send a short message to Jo and Charlie, telling them what happened. Charlie texted back saying they were both stuck at the library, going through old articles. Without much better to do, except for talking to Benny, which he still didn't feel ready for, he decided to join them.
Though maybe moving to another dimension wouldn’t be a terrible idea, considering Dean somehow ended up promising to visit Ash again. Hanging out with ghosts was nowhere near as bad as he’d imagined, but he still kicked himself for making that promise. Ash and Victoria would ask about Cas, and depending on how the rest of the night went, Dean might not want to deal with the answers.
Dean followed, hoping he wasn’t being led to some kind of spirit’s den, where he’d be sacrificed to unknown gods. For now everything seemed in favor of Castiel not being dangerous, but who knew. He looked at the spirit, noticing that the path between the trees seemed to open right before him. Handy, when you thought about it. He cleared his throat. “So, you can command the trees.”
“Seriously? You would do that for me?” Charlie beamed. “I mean, yeah, sure. As long as you don’t make plans to murder me.” She looked pointedly at Castiel.
“I wanted to see if you got those amulets from your friend.” Cas wasn’t looking Dean in the eyes, suddenly very interested in the pattern of the wallpaper. “I… might be slightly concerned that soon the taint is going to surround me and I won’t be able to get out.”
Dean swallowed. It looked like Lisa’s son was one of the victims of their mysterious monster. “Sorry to hear that. I hope someone finds him soon.”
Dean lost track of time, wading through the mud. He had no idea how long it had been when he saw a white shape looming between the trees. He nudged Cas, pointing in that direction. “I’m guessing that isn’t the normal decor of this place.”
“Maybe you should just tell her everything after all,” Cas suggested. “It would make things easier in this case.”
He moved to the ingredients for cheese muffins he was planning to bake, when Charlie entered the kitchen. “Hey, Dean,” she said, snatching an apple from the basket. “There’s a big guy waiting in the living room, asking specifically for you. I think you should go and see him.”
Castiel sent him a suspicious half-smile, dumping a large blue heap of powder on his head moments later.
They reached the forest as quickly as possible, Dean a bit out of breath, his chest heaving rapidly. The mysterious person was already nowhere to be seen. He cursed. They’d probably lost their chance.
Not hesitating anymore, Dean leaned towards Cas, his heart thudding so hard it seemed like it was trying to break free out of his chest, and pressed their lips together. Cas hummed in approval, cupping Dean’s neck with his hand. A pleasant warmth spread through Dean’s entire body. Somehow he didn’t think it was magic this time. The kiss deepened, Dean moving one of his hands to Castiel’s shoulder and Cas’ thumb stroking behind Dean’s ear. The relief of being touched this way after so long was almost overwhelming. Before he knew what was happening, they fell backwards and fully onto the couch, messing up the blankets Cas prepared for Dean.
Castiel was supposed to get his grace back and stay, protecting the city. And if that had happened, he wouldn't just leave Dean in prison. And Dean waited, but instead of Cas, it’s Missouri trying to get him out. And she didn’t mention Cas at all either.
Dean chuckled. “I have coffee for you, be nice.” He made himself more comfortable. “You know it’s still snowing? If this weather keeps up, we are going to be stuck here forever.”
The streets were quiet as they walked, the distant hum of cars closer to the city center barely audible. Cas shrugged, hands in his pockets. “The living don’t like them because they’re a reminder that the life we know is going to end someday. Even if someone stays, it’s not the same. It’s easier to forget about our inevitable death when ghosts aren’t around. But that way of thinking led to alienating them and forgetting they’re still people with feelings and dreams, just like us. Which is cruel and unacceptable in my opinion.”
Dean raised his brow. “So it tried to get me here to help by giving me more nightmares? That was like
For the next few days Dean had his hands full. He greased the hinges in the front door, fixed the kitchen sink and the leaking shower in the upstairs bathroom, rearranged furniture in the living room, and did a few other odd jobs around the house. Castiel helped with some of it, and Dean appreciated it a lot. It was nice to have another pair of hands to do the work, someone he could to talk to instead of spending the whole time alone with his thoughts.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat, unprepared to hear that. Somewhere deep inside he knew it already, but hearing those words leaving Castiel’s mouth was a whole different thing. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, unable to form a response.
Raised voices echo somewhere below. They’re getting closer, accompanied by rushed sounds of running feet.
“Of course it isn’t,” Dean huffed, falling silent for a while, his eyes half-closed. “Man, you’re so much more than I deserve,” he murmured.
Dean nodded and took the first paper from the stack. Jo and Charlie also got back to work. No one said anything more, the library drowned in silence.
Billy Benton worked at the drugstore in Oak Mill, and seemed like quiet, law-abiding citizen, a guy who’d never hurt anyone. Except, of course, that apparently he spent his free time using some heavy magic to kidnap people and keep them in giant cocoons in the forest.
“Yeah? What news?” he asked, not letting his hopes raise. The day couldn’t get much worse, but it was also hard to imagine it could get any better.
“Detective Henriksen,” Victor introduced himself. “Believe me, you don’t want to mess with a cop.” That was a surprise. Dean would’ve never thought Henriksen was a cop; his bets were actually on him being a part of some gang. Pretty ironic.
Cas’ frown deepened. “Should I be? The forest is sick, it’s spreading fast and I can’t do anything about it.”
Cas shrugged, his face more neutral now. “They knew I’d hate it. It’s rather mild considering Uriel proposed they should take my wet clothes with them and make me go home naked.”
As soon as they stepped outside the Roadhouse the world disappeared into clouds of colors swirling in the air. People were running around, laughing and shouting, throwing powder at each other. It was chaotic and overwhelming, like someone had plucked Dean up and tossed him into a pool of water without a warning.
“Come on, we can handle ourselves,” Dean protested. “And those movies are called fiction for a reason.”
“It never came up?” Sam repeated, his voice tense. “I’m sure you would find an occasion to tell me if you just tried. But you didn’t even try, did you?”
“No magic? Really?” Dean said with disappointment. What was the point of having a magic house when they still needed keys to lock the doors?
“You know what, maybe you should bring Mr. Fluffers with you, just like when we were kids,” Cas said, trying to calm down his heart, which was almost jumping out of his chest. “Good old times.” Mr. Fluffers had been Hannah’s favorite teddy bear when they were little, and she used to bring him everywhere with her. Castiel’s childhood was full of tea parties with the two of them.
“Nah, I just feel like this is a pie for breakfast day.” Dean shrugged. He needed to do something with his hands, and even though he decided to pretend that the dreams hadn’t happened, they left him with a carving for pie he couldn’t shake off. Of course, he wasn’t going to tell Cas any of that.
Not thinking anymore, he aimed and shot the beast in the head. Hopefully it wasn’t too late for Dean.
“It’s a phone.” Dean handed it to her. “So you have radios but not smartphones?” It was interesting to discover new differences between the worlds. After seeing the radio, he just assumed they had to be on a similar technological level, but apparently it wasn’t exactly the same.
Dean laughed. “Yeah I know, that pie turned out amazing. I outdid myself this time,” he said, still completely oblivious to Cas’ confession.
“I think so.” Castiel was already moving to the next cocoon. This time there was a sleeping bird inside.
“Hey, don’t be so sure about that!” Jo interrupted, as she resumed walking. “One wrong move and I still can shoot you!” she said without any real threat in her voice.
Dean shook his head with a sigh and moved back to let Charlie in. “Come in. Just try to keep those toads off the furniture.” Apparently they were going to make another trip to Old Grove, no matter what his decision about the portal was.
“Come on, I almost got him! This game is a joke.” Dean threw his arms in the air a few minutes later, interrupting Cas’ thoughts.
“The house was his,” Dean explained, swiping dust off a bookshelf. It rose in a cloud, making his throat itch. “He left it to me and my brother after he died,” he said, after a few coughs.
The voice said something Dean couldn’t understand and the animal jumped off. “I’m not a talking squirrel.”
“You think we can trust that guy?” Jo didn’t look convinced. “I get that he saved your life, but what if there’s something more to this? Everything looks too convenient.”
It wasn’t too late to turn away. He looked back at his car, parked on the side of a narrow country road. No. He needed to see that place again and finally get over it. Taking a deep breath, he faced the forest again. A bunch of old trees weren’t going to win. He wasn’t a kid anymore and there wasn’t anything to be afraid of. Well, except the mysterious thing snatching away people in town, but
right about the distance not being too much for me. But it’d rained before, everything was muddy, and I was drunk, so I only managed to touch the other bank for a second and then slipped into the water, getting completely drenched.”
Before heading to the basement they took the dreameater to the kitchen. Dean gave it a large chunk of cheese, which it started nibbling cheerfully after a few curious sniffs.
“I keep forgetting that you moved in not knowing anything about it.” Cas scrunched his nose. “The power comes mostly from the unused portal in the basement. As far as I can tell the house was built around it.”
The Roadhouse was almost empty, the only patrons being Tracy and Ellie, sipping beers at the bar. Dean and Cas sat next to them, as Ellen poured them all tumblers of whiskey. Dean was glad there was no one else there; he needed a few moments of peace and quiet after running for his life just moments ago.
“Yes.” Castiel nodded, catching Dean’s hand and entwining their fingers together. “She said that by feeling more, by living to my full potential, I’m becoming
“It’s okay Dean. You couldn’t predict something like that.” Sam shrugged. “I’m glad it all ended well.”
They finished around midnight, Victoria ultimately winning with a pleased smile on her face. Good thing she was already dead, because Dean doubted anyone alive could survive Castiel’s murderous glare. He made a mental note to never get on Cas’ bad side, unless he wanted his soul to depart from Earth with a one-way ticket.
dreams and nothing more — not a vision or a message. They had to be. They had to be, because Cas had been dead for years.
“There are certain things I can see in the future, child,” Missouri explained, sitting down. “You have a problem with your magic, is that right?”
did you tell me?” He was shouting now, no longer able to stop himself. “It doesn’t change anything! It doesn’t change that I lost you, that it took me
that the thought of being in another world didn’t sink in properly, but now he could barely believe he was really there. Maybe crossing the portal was worth it after all, at least to see all of this. Even Cas seemed to be somewhat impressed, an almost-smile dancing on his lips.
Dean was reluctant to leave Cas alone, but after a short debate with himself, he joined Tracy, bombarding the leviathan with everything he had. He wouldn’t be able to take proper care of Cas as long as this thing was alive anyway. The monster tried to back away to the living room, leaving a wide trail of black goo behind it, but Ellie cut it off, sending the rest of the detergent its way.
“Not an early morning person, huh?” Dean stretched, wincing as his joints protested. It looked like Cas’ magic didn’t save him from the pains of falling asleep on the ground. And teasing Cas aside, he would also do a lot for a large cup of coffee. Or for a sip of one of those weird energy potions Sam used to drink when he’d still been in school. They tasted like hell, but were strong enough to wake up a dead body. Probably literally.
Castiel smiled at him again. “Calling my name should work.” And just like that he vanished, leaving Dean alone.
Dean gives Haven a last glance with a heavy heart. There’s something constricting his chest, and for a few seconds he can’t breathe. But then Castiel, still half asleep, nuzzles into his back and mumbles something that Dean can’t understand under the roaring engine. Suddenly breathing becomes easier. He’s not alone. No matter what happens next, he’s going to go through it with Cas.
“Just try to keep it down with uh… your spirit form. It shows sometimes, I’m not sure how people are going to react if they accidentally see it,” he warned, while they sat at their spot by the river. He tried to ignore the fact that they already had
Dean discovered with surprise that Castiel was a good listener. Even with his sarcastic remarks and bluntness, talking to him was a lot easier than Dean had imagined. Sometimes their conversations were still awkward but it wasn’t unexpected; they were just getting to know each other after all. They talked about everything from books through astronomy to the current weather. Dean told Cas a little about working for Bobby and about Sam, not hiding how proud he was of his brother. Castiel seemed to be genuinely interested in what Dean had to say, and shared a few things about magic in return. Like stuff about unicorns.
The evening was warm and clear, just as expected in late spring. Blooming trees in a nearby orchard spread their sweet, flowery scent across the banks of the river; water burbled quietly around the stones, in harmony with chirping crickets and croaking frogs. The last rays of sunlight fell on the darkening forest, bathing trees in golden hues.
The creature laughed again. “Did you really think I was that pathetic sack of meat? Disappointing. He was useful for a time, but he finally got scared of you, he wanted to back out on our deal. So I took his body and
The waitress nodded, writing their orders down, and moved to the next table where a woman somewhere in her forties was nodding off over an emptied plate, her head propped on her hand.
“NO!” Castiel growled, jumping after it. The tree burst into flames, Cas vanished and Dean blacked out.
The ghosts turned out to be good company, and the first hour quickly morphed into another, even though Dean and Ash fell far behind at the very beginning and never recovered. Ash had obvious problems with his grip, and Dean wasn’t able to focus no matter how hard he tried. He could swear Cas was messing with him on purpose. He must’ve been, with the way his nose crinkled when he laughed, or the way his voice dropped even lower after a few beers. It was impossible not to think about kissing him, and at some point Dean stopped fighting it.
“Dean, watch out!” Cas pushed Dean back as one of the tendrils shot up, an oval mouth with rows of teeth opening at its end. It caught Castiel’s chest, sticking to it with a sucking noise. He grunted in pain, trying to tear it away. For a moment it seemed that it wouldn’t let go but then he smashed one of the vials, and the tendril retreated, its end charred. Cas backed away immediately, closing the door behind them.
Cas squinted. “Hmm… James attacked Alastair’s trade ships, stealing their cargo and killing the resisting members of the crew. Henry was one of the survivors.”
Cas raised his eyebrows, unimpressed. “I didn’t know I’m not allowed to enjoy anything more common than pork brains.”
The day grew warmer by the minute, cool wind from last night replaced by a light breeze. An earthy smell of grass spread in the air, accompanied by a faint, sweet scent coming from flowerbeds in another part of the park. Birds chirped in the leafy tree crowns. Despite the rude awakening, it was a perfect morning. The only thing missing was a good place to eat.
Cas. The person next to him was Cas. The guy who’d ran away with him from a speed dating event to spend the whole night wandering around the city. Did things like that just happen to people in real life? Because seriously, if Castiel weren’t lying right there, Dean would most likely brush it all off as his mind making a poor dream attempt at a romantic comedy.
“No such luck, unfortunately,” Dean said, turning right to the curtains aisle. Honestly, between the three of them, Charlie had the biggest chance to get anything out of Jo. If she didn’t know, that meant no one knew. “She really didn’t tell you anything?”
alive and that’s a lot more than we should be able to say! I became someone else, but I’m alive and happy. I wish you could see that.” Castiel spoke louder too, his voice full of emotion. “And I’m
Dean swallows, dumbfounded. He doesn’t understand. Cas touched the stone, but he is still there. He doesn’t seem to be changed in any way.
. I don’t know!” he grumbled. “Can’t you just imagine some clothes on?” He honestly couldn’t tell how he felt about it, but naked yoga in the living room wasn’t a thing you do after living with someone for a week. There were
After the fourth library Dean sat back in the car resigned, closing his eyes to think. It was late afternoon, and it looked like his only options were to leave the house, or get used to having Castiel there. He certainly wasn’t going back to Sioux Falls. It would be like giving up, not to mention he wouldn't be able to explain to Bobby why he changed his mind. But the thought of living with someone’s imaginary friend scared the crap out of him, and he would give a lot not to have to consider it.
Charlie made a confused face. “That seems a little… far. I was hoping to find something more local.”
Maybe he should find a way to get rid of Castiel, and forget about everything. The house belonged to him after all, and Castiel had no right to be there. The thing was, he had no idea where to look for any sort of information. There was no one to ask, and no one who would actually believe him. He had to at least try to do something though, or he would be stuck with an unwanted housemate for good.
Josie stood up, glancing at all of them. “Well, I guess it’s time to say goodbye,” she said, returning to the circle, her voice still slightly trembling. “I’m glad to see all of you here. It looks like the portal is finally in good hands.”
An unexpected croak pierced the air, making them jump and move away. A big gray toad leaped clumsily on the stairs, oblivious to what it interrupted. Dean never wanted to burn something with his eyes as much as he wanted to annihilate that toad. The moment had passed and neither he nor Cas seemed to have the courage to make the next move. Fucking great. Just what he needed right now on top of everything else.
“Does this make you uncomfortable?” Cas asked, changing his position again, so that he was touching the floor only with his hands, muscles flexing under his tattooed skin. Dean felt a wave of heat just from watching it.
“Are you sure you can find your way there when it’s dark?” asked the second boy. It sounded more like a challenge than a doubt.
“I want to see how far it stretches,” Castiel said, without a warning turning into a crow. Before anyone had a chance to react, he flew away, disappearing in the tree crowns. Jo stopped in the middle of the road to cast Dean a questioning look. Other people around them didn’t seem to care. They were probably used to stuff like that.
Castiel shook his head. “You did nothing wrong, Dean. In fact, I would be very happy if that happened again.” Something in Dean’s stomach did a happy dance. “But there’s something I haven’t told you that could change a lot. And I don’t want you to act without full knowledge, it’s possible you’d regret it later.”
Dean saw the forest for the first time in a week and in that time it had gotten significantly worse. It would be hard to move around the slime now, it seemed to be almost everywhere, oozing out of the trees, covering the ground, making little burbling noises as they walked. At least it didn’t seem to react to them and allowed Castiel to walk around, not stopping him anymore.
Jo rolled her eyes. “Yeah, but only if you’re not going to try to absorb the whole thing by yourself. In that case you can leave and get your own food or at least wait until we finish.”
“No. And don’t ask Benny either. I promise it’s not going to affect this case in any way, so you don’t have to worry about it.” He
“Well, we never went anywhere beyond Old Grove,” Castiel said thoughtfully. “We could travel, see the sights. Maybe look for information about the creators of the portal.”
A couple of heart-shaped butterflies broke away from the poster next to the door, turning into glitter a few seconds later. Dean gave the poster an offended glare. It seemed to mock him, with its bright pink letters SPEED DATING and LOVE AT FIRST SIT laughing in his face. Right. Like you could actually find love after talking to someone for a couple of minutes. One night stand? Sure. But love was a whole different thing.
“Thanks.” Charlie sent him a bright smile, entering the house. “So what’s the deal with that Old Grove? I didn’t see any groves around.”
Cas shifted next to him, murmuring something in his sleep. Dean smiled to himself. Yes, he had. He’d definitely found a match.
“Cas,” Dean sighs. Castiel is really going to make him say it, isn’t he? “You didn’t do anything wrong. And I like you, okay? I… more than like you. I want you there with me.” The kitchen suddenly feels too hot.
“Don’t you dare to laugh at me! That thing bit me!” Dean argued, showing Cas small marks of teeth on the back of his hand. “I just hope it isn’t rabid.” He shuddered.
Dean felt tears on his cheeks. He didn’t want to cry. This was stupid. He wasn’t afraid to die. But he wasn’t
In the end, getting inside the tower is easier than Dean imagined, probably because no one actually expects it to happen. The Archstone protects every person in Haven, so why would anyone want to steal it? No one is that stupid or desperate.
“Ellen? Jo? I need you here!” Dean shouted as soon as he jumped out of the portal on the other side. Cas was right behind him, his hand on Dean’s back. Somehow it grounded Dean, keeping the panic away. He was glad he wasn’t alone. He didn’t know what he would do without Cas being there
, but his heart still fluttered happily in his chest. He turned to the side, throwing his arm around Cas, and nuzzling into his neck. A sense of peace washed over him, and he fell back asleep, without any more dreams.
“Uh. So I guess at least now your curiosity’s been satisfied.” He swallowed. “But I’m still not going to talk about this.”
“Well, let’s hope you’re right,” Dean said, feeling his ears getting hot. “Because if you aren’t, we’re going to end up with a bunch of
He knew he loved Dean, but it suddenly hit him that maybe Dean didn’t feel the same and he was going to be stuck with this longing for the rest of his life. Maybe he should spare them both the pain and forget about everything? No, it was ridiculous. He should talk to Dean and say how he felt. The thing was, he had no idea how to even start that conversation, nevermind actually going through with it.
Cas sighed, dragging a hand across his face. Of course Dean had to misunderstand him, while he was going out of his mind in the middle of the kitchen because of his newly realized feelings. But there was no turning back now. “No, Dean, I meant it. I think I’m in love with you.”
“Yes.” Castiel nodded. “I believe that stories are the greatest treasure of humanity. They have the ability to shape our reality and our beliefs, and we carry some of them our whole lives. There’s nothing as beautiful as the power of imagination,” he said earnestly. Dean couldn’t stop himself from smiling.
“Hey, you two, I mean it! You can’t sleep here!” A rough voice coming from above sent a jolt of distress through Dean’s entire body. It must’ve been the reason he woke up in the first place, even though he was only now recognizing separate words as anything more than a series of jumbled growls.
“--we’ve found something else. Sorry.” Jo finished, looking suspiciously guilty and handed him an old paper. It was an issue from about seventeen years back, bold black title saying “
After spending a big portion of the evening going back and forth between thinking about kissing Castiel and trying not to think about it, it seemed surreal that Cas’ lips were suddenly so close that Dean could just dip his head and touch them. His stupid heart beat loudly in his chest. Should he do it? Was Cas expecting him to? What would happen if Dean kissed him and it turned out this wasn’t what Castiel wanted at all? He would be so mad at himself if he fucked this up.
“No,” Dean denied, maybe a little too quickly. It didn’t sound convincing at all. He sighed. “Okay, maybe I am.”
Hannah scrunched her nose and shrugged, observing the old lady and the ducks. “Ever since Anna got engaged, Mom expects both of us to bring someone home. Like it’s some sort of competition.”
Deep weariness settled into Dean’s bones, as he entered room after room, his fingers tracing old wooden surfaces, his eyes sweeping the walls with long glances. To tell the truth, the place was far too big for one person, and Dean had no idea what to do with all that space. Maybe he should get a pet. Or ten.
“I hate that blue guy! I hope he steps on legos every day for the rest of his life,” Dean grumbled, starting a new game.
Cas gives him a guilty look and that’s it. This is too much for Dean to take. His mind short-circuits and, just like that, the only thing he can think of is that Cas would probably look really nice if he let the stubble on his face turn into a beard. And really, who thinks about stuff like that right before they might be sentenced to death? Dean. Dean does.
, but it could be just his imagination. He didn't dare to look back. There was no time for that anyway.
“I’m going to escort you back to your world now,” Victor announced, catching Michael’s arm. Fortunately, Michael complied. He glanced at his sister for the last time on his way out. “You may have won now, Anna, but you can’t run away forever,” he hissed, going down the stairs.
Dean got up too, ignoring the sudden dizziness in his head. “If you can’t get close, how did you get me out of there?”
The man at the table didn’t return the smile, and Dean could swear he caught him rolling his eyes. What a dick. Dean sat down anyway, eyeing the stranger critically. He had over a week’s worth of dark stubble on his face, messy hair, and a creased shirt that looked like it had never seen an iron. This was the first person Dean had seen at this damn thing who didn’t seem to care at all about first impressions.
Something in Cas’ voice convinced Dean, and he stretched out next to Cas with a sigh, their arms nearly touching. There was a slight bump pressing against his back, and he wasn’t wrong about the dew, plus it was cold to boot. But it couldn’t be that bad if Cas did it, right?
Castiel let out a dramatic sigh. “And here I was hoping I’d spend the night with a trout, you just lost your whole appeal to me.”
Castiel laughed. “Then make up your own. We used to do that, remember? There was the Swing and the Ice Cream Cone and the Giraffe.”
They dragged all of the boxes into the open and started going through the books one by one, hoping to find out what Benton was planning. There was a high possibility that if there actually
They took their time drifting through the streets, talking about anything that came to mind, from the latest achievements of the local baseball team to the best way of getting rid of mold without using magic. The conversation felt different than before, their voices quieter, the silences longer, but still comfortable. Maybe it was the late hour talking, but to Dean it seemed almost like a dream. Moonlit sidewalks and a cute guy were already there; all that was missing was a dash of mystical fog and “Time of My Life” playing faintly in the distance. And maybe a unicorn.
“Don’t get too happy yet,” Charlie added. “There’s still a lot of cleaning to do and I’m sure you’ll get your fair share of that as soon as Cas is up.”
“You need more plants in here. And a cat.” A low voice startled him, making him jump. For a second he was certain he’d fallen asleep again. It had to be a dream. Only his brain playing painful tricks on him could explain this. Castiel was gone.
It wouldn’t have been the first time Dean had sex while sleep deprived, but he had to admit, it had never been the best idea. It wasn’t how he wanted things to go with Cas, and they had time.
“I’m not sure if the lantern had enough time to get to them.” Castiel scrunched his nose. “I think it was just you, Dean.”
And yeah, part of Dean wants to believe that Cas is all right, and that he’s going to get him out of there any minute. An angel could do that, right? But he doesn’t want to get his hopes up. In case it doesn’t happen. He doesn’t want to feel like a naive moron when they execute him.
They walked side by side, Dean stealing glimpses of Castiel. The faint shape of an antlered creature towering over him was visible again. Dean thought it looked content, with its half-closed eyes and something resembling a smile on its faces. There was a strange discord between it and the corporeal, barefoot man with ruffled hair, walking next to him.
For Dean Winchester it began on a rainy summer day when he parked his car in front of a large, three-story house, hidden behind a bunch of old beeches and black locusts, and a couple of untended azalea shrubs. The house didn’t exactly look ominous with its white siding and small front porch, but there was something hard to grasp about it that nevertheless sent shivers down Dean’s spine.
“Of course!” Dean said. He couldn’t be happier for his brother. “And don’t worry, she’s going to accept, everyone would want to have a sasquatch in the family.”
“Cas,” Dean answered mechanically. Both Jo and Charlie smirked and shared a knowing look. Dean rolled his eyes. “
Looking at how animated Cas’ face became when he was talking about it, Dean could believe that. “Do you ever get like… curious about humans?”
He hated dealing with expectations. Sure, he had lots of practice pretending to be an interesting guy, not someone who spends half of his free time in sweatpants, arguing with his friends about Star Trek headcanons, but it still left him internally screaming.
They stayed as quiet as possible, kissing and touching each other, and Dean quickly realized that it was the opposite of terrible. It was amazing to have Cas so close, to listen to the rhythm of his breath, to feel his hands on his body. He looked into Cas’ eyes, as Cas praised him in a hushed voice, his pupils dilated. Dean wanted that moment to last forever; the impossibility of that was completely unfair.
“ --Winchester, can you explain me why the hell I just saw Billy Benton escaping from my lawn?” Benny asked, completely baffled.
Days passed. Dean expected Cas’ garden to turn into nothing but a brown patch of ground, but to his surprise it continued to be full of blooming flowers. There were dahlias with their full blossoms, delicate hibiscus, long stems of sage and purple coneflowers, and others Dean didn’t know but still found beautiful. A small colorful heaven in the middle of the world readying for winter. Dean wasn’t into gardening, but he had to admit it was gorgeous to look at. Especially combined with Cas tending to it, his back hunched over, knees stained with grass, humming something softly. Dean was pretty sure that was the best part.
“Okay, that's good. Goodnight Cas, just yell if you need me-” Dean turns to leave but Cas grabs his wrist, curling his fingers into his hand. Dean can feel his own pulse quicken without Cas having to tell him.
“Try this.” Dean twirls his fork in the lo mein container on his lap and brings the fork over to Castiel’s mouth. They don’t break eye contact as Cas closes his lips on the fork. He moans quietly, only for Dean to hear. Dean stares at his mouth, Cas notices. He bites his bottom lip. Their eyes meet again and Dean notices Cas’s eyes harbor a dark and mischievous look. Cas leans over to Dean, lips grazing his ear, and whispers. “Meet me in your room in five minutes.” Cas gets up, stretches, and yawns. He bids the brothers goodnight and leaves the room. Dean begins to close up the leftovers and counts down the five minutes in his head.
“Dean, before we got together, I tried to stop loving you. It was impossible. So I guess I will just have to love you until the end of time.” Cas runs his hand through the side of Dean’s hair and pulls him in for a kiss.
“Don’t give me those eyes sweetie or I’ll be joining you two next time.” Rowena flashes a small grin as Dean fights the urge to glare at her. She struts to the middle of the room. “So, how about we put a pin in this awkward, little plot and deal with this after dinner? The last thing we need right now is Winchester drama!” Her voice grows stern. “Get over yourselves and don’t let this ruin the night! Can we all agree to that?” All three of them nod. “Wonderful! Now, we will start in the living room then we will move into the dining room when dinner is ready, which should be shortly after our divine guests arrive. Then we will retire back here for tea and a light dessert. If all goes well, you will have all the information you need for the case and I will have a blossoming relationship with the rulers of the Underworld.”
“No, thanks. I’m halfway done anyway. That blade is seriously messing with him, we need to dig into lore about Enochian blades like this tomorrow,” Dean replies, and Sam nods. “Are you hurt?” He looks over at his brother.
“Us, like normal I guess, but with more ‘I love you’s and more kissing and more mornings waking up with you next to me,” Dean pulls on a clean pair of jeans and smiles at Castiel who looks warmly back at him.
“I love you too,” Dean moans into his angel's lips. Soon, Castiel falls asleep with Dean wrapped up in his arms. Dean shuts off the movie, takes the blanket off the back of the couch, and pulls it over the two of them. He snuggles back into his angel’s side and drifts off to sleep.
Sam got in the car, placed the bags of food next to him in the bench seat, and huffed out a quiet laugh when he looks in the rearview. Dean meets his brother’s eyes in the mirror.
“Cas,” Dean laughs. “That is not what Sam meant, he knows you are his friend too.” He offers the angel another beer and Cas accepts it, throwing the cap behind him, missing the table completely.
Cas and Dean walk back to their changing rooms and back out again with their clothes on. They hang their pinned suits on the metal rack by the front desk as Theodora instructed them to do. Sam followed them out a few minutes later. Frank and Theodora handed them a receipt and told the boys they could pick up their suits Friday morning. Sam was paying and Dean told him to meet him and Cas outside. Dean and Cas walked out into the night and made their way to the car. He could tell Cas was exhausted at this point. They got in the backseat of the Impala and Cas fell asleep with his head on Dean’s shoulder with Dean’s arm around him and their fingers intertwined.
“It’s okay, I’ll help you.” They look through all types of suits until they both spot the perfect one for Cas. Dean takes the hanger it’s on and holds it up to Cas. He can’t help but smile at Castiel. “This is your suit, babe. Holy hell…” Dean whispers. The suit is dark blue, paired with a black dress shirt and black tie. And it would kill on Cas. “It brings out your eyes! Do you like it?”
Dean opens his bedroom door and walks in. He doesn’t see Cas but feels Cas’s arms wrap around his middle and his lips on his neck.
“Dean! I thought I called Cas? I tried to call you first but you didn’t answer,”  Jack says. “Is he with you?”
“Ciao! Welcome to Fine Suits!” A short man with a slight Italian accent and thick grey hair greets them. The man introduces himself as Frank and his wife Theodora, who is tailoring a suit on the only other customer in the store.
“So, Cas seems a lot better,” Sam says, Dean avoids his eyes and hopes the conversation doesn’t go where he thinks it will.
Sam orders the food on the phone before he gets on the road. He reaches the restaurant around the same time the food is done and goes inside to pick it up. Cas was still sleeping when Sam came back to the car, but now his head was resting in Dean’s lap.
“Very much,” Cas says, taking the suit from Dean so he can look at it. “What are you going to wear?” Cas and Dean look through more suits until one catches Castiel’s eye. “Dean, that one.” He points to a black suit with a dark, faded silver floral pattern on it and Dean picks it up and holds it up to himself. “Dean, it’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.” Dean’s cheeks turn pink, Cas steps closer and whispers in his ear. “The second you put the suit on, I’m going to want to rip that bowtie off… with my teeth.” Dean feels himself getting hot.
“I know that,” Dean says, still staying as close to Cas as he can. “I  mean we are two guys in Kansas, Cas. We have to be careful, some people, like my dad, don’t like relationships like ours-
“Okay, I’ll give her a call,” Sam says and gets up from the table. “I’m gonna take a shower then we should look at these books the professor gave us.”
“By the way, Jack and Claire are coming tomorrow. They found another blade with the werewolves they took down,” Dean tells his brother.
“First things first, let's go back and get that blade so at least we can keep track of one of them,” Dean suggests and begins to collect the dishes from the table.
“Put the shirt on buddy, you’ll get cold,” Dean says, trying to distract himself from the angel's touch. He stands up and pulls the covers on his bed back as Castiel puts on Dean's a-bit-too-big t-shirt. Cas pulls the covers over him but sits back up. “How are you feeling now?”
“It would be no,” Dean shakes his head but when Cas’s face falls he can’t help but laugh. “Oh baby I'm just kidding of course it would be yes!” He pulls Cas in for a kiss before caressing his face in apology.
Dean decides to make pancakes and bacon for Castiel. He discovered the last time Cas was human that he enjoyed pancakes with honey drizzled on top. He has the table all set, coffee poured, and the bacon sizzling when he hears his name being called from down the hall.
let me know what you guys think! i loved where this chapter went, even though it's kinda random, so i hope you did too!
“Cas, it’s me. Open up.” Cas opens his door for him and Dean slips inside, locking the door behind him. Cas only had his slacks on and his shirt half-buttoned. “You were right about this suit-” Before Dean can say anything else, Cas has Dean pinned to the door with his lips on Dean’s. It’s rough, it’s needy. Cas is nipping at Dean’s jaw and neck while Dean’s hands grab at Castiel’s back. Dean lets out a small moan under the other’s lips. “Cas…” His hands make their way up to Castiel’s hair and Cas’s hands travel down to Dean’s ass. Their hands are just as needy as their mouths. They freeze when they hear Frank coming to the changing rooms with Sam.
“What does a fight that you and your dad had have to do with Sam asking about us?” Castiel questions, his eyebrows scrunching together.
“Dean, it was over a decade ago,” Cas insists. “I never told you about how I felt, I didn’t even know how I felt.” Cas smiles again, dips his finger in whipped cream, and dabs it on Dean’s nose. As if right on cue, to ruin the moment, the boys hear the front door open.
“Hey, Cas, just breathe sweetheart, breathe with me,” Dean breathes deeply and slowly, encouraging Cas to do the same until his breathing slows to normal and the pair are breathing together. “You’re okay, babe.”
“Oh um, our crazy Auntie Rowena is hosting a dinner party for… politicians in her area and she’s making us go,” Dean responds.
“You love me?” Cas whispers as he crawls out from under the covers and kneels at the end of the bed, where Dean is standing with his back to the angel.
“Okay! Well on that note,” Dean stands up and collects the empty dinner plates. “Why don’t we clean up and watch a movie tonight? We can figure out this summoning spell tomorrow.”
“Why didn’t you say anything in the car?” Sam questions as the brothers help Castiel into the bunker and sit him at the map table.
“Nah, he will find out eventually so there is no point in hiding it I guess. I just don’t want him to catch us in flagrante delicto.” Dean pulls Cas’s lips back to his and locks the door as Cas pushes him up against it. Castiel’s warm hands travel under Dean’s shirt and grip his lower back.
“I know, it’s okay. I’ll guide you through it.” Dean does. And it’s the best blow job of his life. Cas has him writhing and moaning, maybe a little too loud for 8 o’clock in the morning but Dean couldn’t care right now even if he tried. “Cas! Oh my god, Cas!”
“Well, I found that bit of information in Greek, and ‘The Meadow’ could be referring to the Asphodel Meadows which, in Greek mythology, are in the Underworld. Then I was thinking about who rules the Underworld and it clicked, ‘The Lovers’ are Hades-“
The two of them pick out a movie and they settle in on the couch. Cas sits next to Dean and lays his legs over the hunter’s lap. The popcorn bowl rests on Cas’s thighs and it slowly empties throughout the movie. Halfway through the film, Dean slides up to Castiel's uninjured side and snuggles up. He drapes a leg over Cas’s, leans his head on his chest, and softly strokes the angles stubbled cheek with his thumb. Dean guides Castiel’s lips down to meet his. These kisses are loving, gentle, and almost sleepy. Dean can taste the salt from the popcorn on Castiel’s lips and sucks it off. He kisses down the side of Castiel’s neck and the angel lets out a soft moan of pleasure.
“Oh sorry about the mess,” Dean apologizes. “We were just blowing off steam I guess; rough night, ya know?” Sam nods in agreement, goes quietly back to the book, then looks up again.
“I know, the two of them are ridiculous but I thought they were too scared to make any moves. But, it's been ten years… they’ve been doing this for ten years and I didn’t know?”  Sam does some calculations in his head. Sure he’s caught them standing a little too close or having a too quiet conversation but Sam thought that's as far as both of them got.
I was stuck with this chapter but I think it came out well. Sorry, no 'fun stuff' with Dean and Cas yet but that's coming soon!  This chapter is longer than I planned but I hope you like it!
“Okay, we don’t want to keep you,” Sam says as he sits down next to Dean with a cup of coffee. “Stay safe, love you both!” The call ends in a chorus of ‘love you’s.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean asks as he walks back into the room, placing the beer on the map table. “Do you think you’ll be less tolerant of alcohol since you aren't at full angel power right now?”
“Um, well… I don't know. Nothing,”  Dean answers, knowing full well what Sam meant. “Just forget about it.”
“Can’t go to bed with wet hair,” Dean says, getting out the blow dryer. Using that as an excuse to play with Castiel’s hair some more, and it works.
sorry this took forever, school is a bitch but i wanted to give you guys some fluff in honor of Valentine's day and the DeanCas wedding at the Roadhouse that we are all just making up in our heads and loving it... so enjoy!
“Fuck, I love you.” Dean brings their lips together again then turns to face Cas completely. He loves the way they fit together like this is what their lips and bodies and hands were made for. Dean's fingers dip below Cas’s waistband and slowly pulls his sweatpants down. He kisses down Cas’s chest, down his stomach, and right under his navel. Cas has his hands in Dean’s hair and is coming a short while later.
holy hell im so sorry it took me like three months to get this chapter out. i had covid and i have school and work and life and adhd, ya know? but i have a PLAN so stay tuned! sorry of this is short and a little unedited but I wanted to give you all something
“We can deal with that later. Right now, Sammy go get the medical kit,” Dean orders and Sam runs into the other room. “Cas sit on the table, I am going to have to stitch you up. You’ll be okay.” He helps Cas sit up on the map table and take off his trench coat and suit jacket. “Does it hurt bad?” Dean looks up to meet Cas’s eyes.
Sam looks like he wants to say something else but the sound of a phone buzzing stops him. “It’s Rowena.” Sam picks up his phone and walks into the map room in order to not disturb Cas. “Hey Ro… uh yeah he’s right here.” Sam waves his hand, signal for his brother to come into the other room
“Sam’s out running errands or something so I thought we could have a breakfast date-thing.” Dean feels his ears go red when Cas looks at him sweetly. “Uh, it’s almost ready, have a seat.” He starts to lead Cas over to the table when the angel suddenly stops.
“Oh, Dean!” Cas breathes out. Dean’s mouth is warm and Cas is trying hard to resist the urge to thrust up, but it's a losing battle. Dean works around this by not taking Cas so deeply, allowing him room to move up. Castiel’s hand makes his way to Dean’s hair, pulling slightly, driving Dean crazy. Dean moves his hands from Cas’s thighs, sliding up to grip his hips. “Your mouth… so- oh!” Dean takes one of his hands down to Castiel’s balls. Cas pulls harder on Dean’s hair. “Oh fuck!” Did Cas just say ‘fuck?’ Did I just make an Angel of the Lord say ‘fuck?’ “Dean I- I want… can we?” Dean pulls off, still tasting Cas and loving every bit of it. “I want all of you, Dean, I need all of you.” Cas isn’t begging. He’s not asking. He’s demanding. And Hell if Dean won’t obey his angel’s demands.
“Put pressure here,” Dean says and starts unbuttoning Cas’s shirt. He gets down to the last button and loosens Castiel’s tie and tosses it to the side. Sam comes back into the room with the medical kit and leaves it open on the table next to Cas.
“Yeah okay, sure Dean.” Sam rolls his eyes. “Hey, um. Can I show you something I got something this morning when I was out on my run?”
Dean and Cas drive back to the shop to pick up their suits. By the time they get back, Rowena is in their kitchen with Sam making herself a cup of tea. Apparently she decided on wearing her blue Givenchy dress. She looks done up, even more so than usual. dress
“See, that’s what I said this morning, but Sam seemed dissatisfied with my answer.” Dean met Castiel’s wandering eyes with a confused look.
“That blade really messed you up, huh?” Dean says quietly, still focusing on the stitches. “Maybe it was dipped in some sort of angel poison.” Cas flinches in pain and grips Dean’s shoulder tighter. “It’s okay buddy, I’m gettin’ there.” He moves Castiel’s right leg to the side to get a better angle of his wound.
“We teamed up with some local hunters and they helped us take out the rest of the werewolves, there weren't that many left since we found out the locals took most of them out before we even got there. I felt something was off where we first walked into their hideout. Claire saw one of the werewolves take it out when they realized who we were. She killed it before it got over to me.”
Cas spins Dean around and pulls him in by his waist. Dean wraps his arms around Castiel’s neck and brings their lips together, taking note of how much he loves the little pleasure noises Cas makes when they kiss.
“Oh good,” Sam breathes out with a sigh of release. The brothers sit in silence for a little while, collecting what little information the books have on these blades. Sam starts uncomfortably moving around in his seat until he finally starts talking. “So can we finally talk about-“
Dean tosses Cas a pair of sweatpants and he pulls on his own pajama pants. They fall back into bed. The sheets stayed clean, somehow. They roll around some more, unable to part at the lips. Dean fumbles for a corner of a blanket and pulls it up over them. One pillow remained on the mattress, Cas lets Dean have it. He thought Dean's chest made a better pillow anyway. Cas gazed up at Dean’s face. It’s the most peaceful he has ever seen him, it's beautiful. He is beautiful.
“Uh yeah,” Dean pulls back and starts to clean up the medical supplies. “No problem, I’d stitch you up anytime Cas. Just don’t get hurt so I don’t have to. Um, do you want to take something for the pain?”
seen it as an angel, that's exactly it. I even first saw it when it was just beginning to be carved; but it was only a few hundred feet deep then; just another little gully. Later once it got larger, I've done some flyovers, when traversing the Earth on various missions, but from very high up and I was only using my angelic senses then, seeing it through other electromagnetic spectra, and via the ether and so on. I even visited the very base of the canyon once, quite recently in fact, just a century ago; but that time I flew sideways through the canyon walls, just materializing near the base, as I was on a quite urgent mission regarding a phantom-demon that had taken up residence in the base of the canyon, and of course there had to be an associated diplomatic negotiation with the resident river elemental—" (Dean's completely lost track of this story by now, and only vaguely wonders what an "elemental" is) "—and obviously I was in my true form the whole time, and I was only there for two minutes and I only glimpsed a very small part of the canyon, just this one alcove really, and only with my angelic senses. I even once was talking with another angel, very recently, about visiting it, but... well, we didn't manage to get there. So, in sum," he concludes, "I've seen it when it was new, I've seen it from space and from the ether and I've seen a tiny part of the base." He pauses. "But only ever as an angel. I've never seen it as a human."
“Hades hates the angels because of something stupid Gabriel did.” Cas pushes some of his food around his plate
Dean rubs Castiel's back and the angel's eyes flutter open. “Hey, Cas! Are you okay?” Cas throws his arms around Dean while the hunter cradles him in his lap.
“Welcome to the Masters’ Lake House, gentlemen,” Rowena says, extending an arm dramatically as she guides them up the steps. The inside of the house is more impressive than the outside with a grand fireplace in the living room surrounded by old money-type furniture and large, draped windows that gaze out to the lake. She shows them through the dining room as well, which is elegant, spacious, and dimly lit by candle sconces. The one element that stands out in the house is the plethora of erotic artwork. Dean noticed Cas examining almost every piece. Some of the paintings were simple and suggestive, a manicured hand tied with silk rope to a metal bed frame. Others were a little more intense. The mural in the dining room had the Last Supper depicted as a little more interesting than usual.
“What do you want me to say, Sam? You can’t change the past and it’s not worth bitching about! And Cas… I- I’m going to make dinner!” Dean storms off to the kitchen. He puts a pot of water on the stove to boil and looks for the package of meatballs he stuck in the freezer a few days ago. Dean doesn’t want to hurt his brother, but Sam keeps pushing him about this. He doesn't care if Sam knows what happened that night with their father, Dean just doesn’t know if he can get through telling the story. He puts the frozen meatballs in a pan and turns up the heat.
“When our ‘right time’ comes, will we take the next step?” Dean notices he’s oddly calm, he thinks he should be freaking out but he’s not.
“I sent you the article I read about it,” Sam says, Dean rolls his eyes. Sam has been telling him to read the article for weeks. Not that he would tell his brother, but he did read it and Sam is probably right. “Anyway, I was telling Eileen about the blades last night and she told me about one of her contacts who teaches Greek mythology at the local college. So I emailed Annette, Eileen’s contact, and I picked up some books from her,” Sam points to the bag he dropped on the table. “I was thinking, Cas, you said the Underworld is ‘hell adjacent’ right? So what if Rowena knows something about Hades since she’s the Queen of Hell and all.”
“Of course I want that, Dean. I just wasn’t- All you past relationships never lasted, no offense- I didn’t know how long this would-”
“You wanted to speak with Hades and Persephone correct? Well, the two of them like to be charmed so I figured a little dinner party would be appropriate,” Rowena explains. “These gods you can’t just summon. They need a little… foreplay, if you will. I set it up in one of my son's old safe houses, well, house is a little modest. It’s a lakeside mansion a few hours away from here. I’ve chosen a few of my more respectful demons to staff the dinner, so all you boys will have to do is show up and play nice. I’ve chosen a lovely Merlot and one of my demons was a top chef in Italy so he will be preparing the meal-“
“Cas!” Dean rushes to his side. “Cas, are you hurt?” The angel reaches a hand under his coat to his side and pulls back with blood on his fingers.
“I’m gonna touch it.” Dean picks up the blade by the handle, holding it out in front of him. The lettering along the blade slowly starts glowing blue, lighting up the library. Castiel immediately hunches over in pain as the blade lights.
Sam walks in, Dean holds the door for Cas then walks in behind him. The first thing they notice is the loud opera music playing in the background. The second thing they notice is the vast sea of suits and tuxes surrounding them.
“In those movies you make me- that we watch together- the guy always says nice things and then gives the girl a diamond ring,” Cas recalls. “What you said kind of sounded like that.”
“I don’t know, Sammy,” Dean begins to reply, but he doesn’t know what to say. He’s worried about his angel. “He’s been sleeping a lot, I was hoping that would help him replenish his grace or whatever. I’m starting to get worried.”
“Yeah but you love me.” Dean finds his place back in Cas’s arms and places light kisses on the side of his face and neck.
“Cas,” Dean says, taking Cas’s hands in his own. “You’re it for me, man. I have you now, and I’ve waited so long, and I won’t let you go, okay? Nothing in my past even compares to this. You’re the only person I want to wake up next to in the mornings. You’re the only person I’ve said “I love you” to and I never want to say it to anyone else because I love you so fucking much. I never want to feel anyone’s kisses but yours and the only hand I want to hold is yours. I want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side and I want to make you the happiest angel that ever fell from heaven. If you’ll let me.” Dean realized he was staring at Cas’s hands, which he was still holding. When he looked up, he saw Cas’s blue eyes staring at him lovingly. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and they fell back on the bed.
“We can do it every day, multiple times a day, for the rest of our lives.” Cas kisses his cheek in response. “We might not get to tonight since we have that dinner party thing.”
“No, just you and the beer.” Did Cas just say he needed me?  Dean thought as he entered the kitchen to get one of the six-packs stocked up in the fridge.
“I’m right here, Cas. I’m right here.” Dean rubs Castiel's back. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. I just got up to make you breakfast.” He lightly kisses the side of his angel's forehead. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas lets the words weakly escape his lips. He raises his hand to cover Deans, which is still lightly brushing the rag over Castiel’s face.
“Yes, and those people can be worse than some of the monsters we’ve faced. I’m sorry, I love you so much but we need to be careful.”
“It’s possible. I guess we were on the right track with that Hades-Persephone trail then,” Dean concludes, Sam nods.
“I’m better now, thank you. Rowena had some spell that did the trick.” They finish talking to Donna and say their goodbyes. Dean throws the phone to the other side of the bed.
“Dean, should we keep our relationship a secret?” Cas quickly asks while zipping up his (Dean’s) jeans.
“Dean your pulse is beating extremely fast,” Castiel points out, his words slurring as he reaches his free hand forward to place it on Dean's chest.
“No, it's nic- ugh!” Cas groans in pain again and his grip tightens on Dean’s shoulder as he buries his head into Dean’s neck. Dean leans his head on Castiel’s, just for a moment, to comfort him. If Sam walked in right now I’d never hear the end of it, Dean thought.
“And that's it! Fancy a cup of tea, Samuel?” Rowena asks, guiding Sam to the door. She hands Dean the spellbook and gives him a reassuring smile. Dean watches his brother and the witch close the bathroom door behind them.
“I want to do that with you.” Cas nods over to one of the paintings. Dean looked over to find a large, golden frame. Painted in dark, seductive colors were someone's hands being held down and in place with a necktie. He turned back to find Castiel’s eyes darkened with lust. “I wanna tie you up and make you feel good,” Cas whispers into Dean’s ear. “I want to explore your body with my teeth and lips and tongue and mark you all over. Even if nobody else knows you’re with me, it will be written all over your skin.”
A few minutes later, Sam makes his way back to the car. Dean tosses the keys to him, tells him to dive, and to stop and pick up dinner from The China Inn Restaurant on the way home.
“Hello boys… some trouble you’ve found yourselves in!” Rowena says over speaker phone. “How’s the pretty angel doing?”
“It's a good thing I remembered to lock the door last night,” Dean whispers to Cas with a smirk. “Just be quiet and he won't know you’re here.” He rolls back over to his side of the bed. “Now I am!” Dean yells to Sam.
“I hadn't,” Sam says, slowly walking into the room with a stack of books in his hands. Dean immediately straightens up and a Cas shuffles away from him. “It was one of the first times I’d ever seen dad get that pissed off.” He glances over at Dean. “Sorry, I was just coming to apologize and help you with dinner and I overheard you two talking.”
“My dear boy, it’s pretty obvious! I mean, the eyes, the tension, the drama!” Rowena attempts to sit the still shocked Sam on the couch.
“Just tired, the pain is not as bad,” Cas replies looking up at Dean. He looks adorable with his hair all messy and wearing Dean’s shirt, but of course Dean would never say that.
Back at the bunker, the blade lays on one of the tables as the boys dive into deeper research. Books scatter any open surface, leaving only a small area for three coffee mugs.
“Hey, you have nothing to be sorry for.” Dean reaches a hand up to his angels’ cheek, caressing with his thumb. “Where did you learn moves like that anyway?” He smirks.
“Got it.” Cas pulls out the tube and Dean snatches it from him. He slicks up Castiel’s cock, then his own fingers. He slowly pumps Cas with one hand, and with the other, he reaches to insert one finger inside his hole. Cas grips Dean’s hips harder and they moan together, both enjoying the feeling of Dean's hands. Dean makes Cas feel so good, he wants to do the same for Dean.
“Yeah,” Sam responds. “They are mentioned a few times and are the last people who seem to have had possession of the blades. It also says they keep them hidden in ‘The Meadow.’”
