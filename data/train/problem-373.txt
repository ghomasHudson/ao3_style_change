“Yes, chess, what great observational skills you have,” John grinned cheekily at Sherlock as he finished retrieving the travelling set from his duffle bag.
Sherlock hadn’t wanted to hurt John and he certainly hadn’t wanted to scare him. That wasn’t the plan. But he had underestimated Guerin and it shook him to his core that he could have miscalculated so greatly.
Sherlock sighed and tried (but failed), to ignore the voice in his head that quite chose to remind him at each floor he now had to ascend, that it would have been far quicker if he had asked John to accompany him.
John glanced at Lestrade. The DI seemed lost in thought or maybe it was just a pretense, for his sake. Either way, John was exceedingly grateful for the space and they sat in silence for a while, sipping the god-awful coffee. Time enough for John's hands to finally stop shaking and for the two other cups of coffee to go stone cold. Eventually, John made a move to get up and Lestrade followed, pouring the remainder of the coffee into one of the bricked flower beds and taking the empty cups with him. Lestrade led the way back. To the lab, not the morgue.
Finally, stirring and straightening the cup, Mycroft looked up with an air of detached civil servitude. “How can I be of assistance, Doctor Watson?”
“Back to being an inconsiderate arsehole again then, are we?” John regarded Sherlock rifling through his toiletries bag.

“Of course I did, it would have been less than appreciated by our fellow passengers." (Not to mention that John didn't think either of them would make it out of the carriage alive if John had to endure nearly two days of Sherlock’s artistic musings, breath taking talent notwithstanding.)
“Travel isn't always pretty. It isn't always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you - it should change you.

They arrived to find Sherlock’s and Molly's heads bent over a bench with the files from Lestrade’s box spread out around them and try as he might, John couldn't resist the pull of the light blue folder from which a couple of crime scene photos poked out. Picking up the folder he steeled himself to open it, grateful that none of the others tried to stop him or asked if he thought he should. If he had been his own patient, he probably would have advised against it. But he wasn't a patient. He was a soldier.
Sherlock’s change of topic didn't seem to throw Sandrine in the slightest. “About a year now. I first met him in Cairo when I was working for another production company. He was looking to expand and asked me if I wanted to join him to head up his operation. It seemed like a good offer.”

Lestrade didn't respond, just held John’s gaze, which achieved its (most probably) intended purpose of robbing him of some of his hysteria. Jaw clenched, John drew in a deep sniff through his nose and calmly but firmly stated. "I want to be there."
A couple of deep thrusts later and John joined him, his head thrown back, gulping for air as stars of white exploded behind his eyelids and his grip on Sherlock’s softening cock slackened.
“It’s just the drug, and it will only affect your memory of last night, nothing more”, John reassured warmly as he stroked his thumb rhythmically back and forth across Sherlock’s knuckles. “Your beautiful brain will be back to its genius brilliance in no time.” He leant down to place a kiss on Sherlock’s hand.
"Ahh, just the roof - that's where he goes to sneak a cigarette when he’s stressed. But I already looked there."
John knew he had about as much chance of finding Sherlock as he had of returning to his career of a trauma surgeon. But on the positive side, that also meant that the Met's chances were no better.
"I dunno Greg,” John sighed, exasperated, but determined to remain polite this time. “. Sunset? Around six? Why? What's he done this time?"
Alt text: Sixteen. J. Go then. do anything you like Touch her, feel them. Leave me be. Left. S. Discarded. self-abandonment, the easier choice.
An uncharacteristic silence settled into the call before Mycroft carefully spoke. “How are you involved with Jim Moriarty, Sherlock?”
The purpose of the journey had been to create marks in their memory, on their consciousness, in their hearts. Right now though, John wouldn't have faulted Sherlock if he thought that the purpose was just to torture him.
Alt text: Four. J. Favours the bold, favours the brave. If you should be so fortunate But not I. But not I. And you said S. naturally, as you began As if there was anything natural at all about any of this.
“No, not cyanide,” John drew out patiently. “Just chewable ginger, courtesy of the less than pleasant side effects of procreation.”
Sherlock stepped lightly onto a tarpaulin that had now been laid down to on one side of the pipes structure, and moved closer to the body. The forensic team, having donned their blue coveralls, had begun their task of cataloguing the scene in the now extremely cramped space; the floor, the walls, the door, and the victim herself ...
Sherlock took a few mouthfuls of his breakfast and then pushed the rest about his plate, trying to shut out the noise of John and Lestrade’s inane chatter about the abundance of sunshine, the lack of rain and all manner of other boring observations on the current state of the environment.
“What time was he found? When did he arrive? How long did it take him to get to the tank? Who else was here - Graveyard shift?”
The headlines read like the cover of a C grade crime novel, each trying to out-sordid the next in a desperate attempt to grab the public’s two-second attention span. Of course they had been interspersed with the regular news of the day; the Iranian oil tanker that was being held in Gibraltar, the 737 MAX still under investigation and costing Boeing and the airlines a fortune in the meantime, but everywhere he looked, the headlines of Sherlock's "death" blared. In the end he just shut it all out, holing himself up in Baker Street. It didn't stop them though, greedy bastards - the rapping of the Baker Street door knocker had been insistent, every minute of the hour, day and night. In the end, Lestrade had been forced to put an officer on the door by a very irate and also grieving Mrs. Hudson.
As the elaborately laid brickwork and towering chimneys of the Battersea Power Station came into view, Sherlock allowed that there was something to be admired in a structure that had managed to retain, even in its most neglected years, a stylistic dominance.
From the look on his face, it was the answer the DI had been looking for, but the information didn’t seem to relieve his concern, if anything, it just served to deepen it.
But just as he was closing the screen of his laptop, an image caught his eye. A Dublin University Football Club team photo; in white shirts and black shorts, a number of young males sitting on a set of bleachers in front of extremely well manicured turf. And there at the bottom in the roll call, one name stood out amongst the others. J. Moriarty. John traced the reference to a figure in the front row. Grainy, it was hard to make out the features, but there he definitely was. Then a building in the left hand corner of the photo caught his eye (h
Watson took her small pale hand gently in his, out of habit, searching for a pulse. None would be forthcoming, her lifeblood having drained from her veins some time ago, but as he eased her hand back down onto the damp stone, her fingers unfurled and a simple silver necklace bearing a Trinity knot fell out. Watson picked up the delicate piece and placed it carefully back in her palm (noting absently where the three corners had indented the skin), and tucked her fingers back around it.
Alt text: Six. J. when we go back then Do we see each other the way I see you now? Do we hear each other the way I hear you now? Do we love each other ... S. Fingers whisper of every kind of pleasure But demons still call. Speaking in tongues. Of love and loss And leaving.
John clenched his fist, clenched his jaw, and tried to keep smiling. He caught a glance of himself in the scratched Perspex window of the checkpoint office and thought he looked a little insane.
John couldn't fault him on that right now. And even Sherlock had the decency to look a bit guilty. But with a purpose, and Lestrade's calming presence, the awkwardness eased a little as they made their way downstairs to the morgue.
Watson didn't ask the question that stood between them. He was content to wait for Holmes’ to give it voice. But Holmes didn't speak again. He didn't glance away from the fireplace when Watson moved, an hour later, to pour himself a Whiskey. He didn't flinch when the groan of Watson’s chair announced his return, tumbler in hand. And he stayed silent when Watson drained the last drop and set the glass aside, pushing down on the armrests to take his leave to bed.
“Well, here’s the thing about that,” Lestrade mused, rubbing his chin thoughtfully as he leant forward, “I would, if I could … but we think he’s dead. And here you are, wearing his coat.”
"Just one left to run - we should have the results shortly, however … all the others have returned the same results - and the blood at the scene,
“Barts," Sherlock announced, shimmying a pair of dark, slim trousers up over his hips. "I need to look at the Battersea body. Lestrade will meet us there after his press conference.”
For Mycroft, John surmised, it was just to ensure that the court was satisfied that Sherlock was dead so that Mycroft could put an end to this sordid chapter and close the book on any “errors of judgement” on his behalf. John considered the creation of a partnership between an MI6 agent and a psychopathic criminal ranked somewhat higher than an “error of judgement” and somewhat closer to an absolute fucking disaster. He was quite keen on putting that opinion to Mycroft in no uncertain terms, but Mycroft had been impossible to get a hold of in the days since Sherlock’s dea —
“And this,” John kept Sherlock’s gaze and he gestured to the board, “is this a beautiful game?” John surprised himself by realizing that so much rested on Sherlock’s answer.
“I’ll give you a call later tonight,” Lestrade advised from the doorway. "And John … " he seemed to be debating what to say next before  settling on, "take care of yourself."

He stretched across the bed, fumbling in the nightstand for the tube of lube, Sherlock tracking his every movement. Pushing himself back into position, John poured some into the palm of his right hand, and tossing the bottle aside somewhere into the folds of pushed down sheets at his feet, started to warm it in his palms.
“Not particularly, but if you add and H in front of the “Amish” you get my middle name,” John offered.
Alt text: Prologue. Fix this. How do you fix this? How do you ford the river of lies? How do you, plaster over the cracks? In the beginning. In the beginning all things are new. Are fresh. Are crack-less. Are pure. Hope. Faith. Once there, now gone. Trust. What trust?
“Yes, certainly,” Mycroft cleared his throat and straightened his spine. “My late brother, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, through his work with the Metropolitan Police, had assisted in the apprehension and incarceration of a number of less savoury individuals. It is believed that these individuals could disrupt proceedings or use the knowledge gained as a result, to sully the family name. As such the family would very much like the inquest itself to be a closed matter as well.”
He nodded at John through the small window to indicate that he had gotten what they came for, but as soon as he started to push the second door open, he saw a shadow move behind John. His breath stuttered and his voice paralyzed by the sickening sound of a blow being delivered, the door swung open fully just in time for him to see John fall limply to the floor of the corridor and Guerin lowering a fire a bright red fire extinguisher.
“Yes,” Sherlock drew out the ‘s’, gritting his teeth. “I do know where he is stationed. What I want to know is where he is
“So I have already been informed,” John remarked dryly. Sherlock snuck John a glance and smothered a grin.
Pushing in on the side and sliding the base plate off the magazine, he captured the magazine spring and the follower neatly in his left palm. Taking the now oily rag, he wiped down the exterior of the magazine tube, coating it in a thin layer of oil then pushed it through the center of the magazine and pulled it right through, coating the inside as well. Not too much; he didn't want the magazine follower to bind. He wiped down the metal spring, put the follower on the spring, dropped the magazine body back over, compressed the spring and slid the base plate back into position.
“I’m sorry?” Clearly he was not, he never was, but Sherlock did understand the obsequious and unfortunately necessary art of information extraction.

Unlocking the door and entering the brightly lit room, Molly made her way over to one of the steel drawers on the back wall, turned the handle and pulled hard, sliding the tray of black-plastic wrapped body out onto a gurney.

John found Sherlock on the portside outer deck, the strong winds at his back drawing his curls out to sea and his (trembling) hands white-knuckled, gripping the peeling white metal railing. It took John’s brain just one second more to register that the tremors were running through Sherlock's whole body, not just his hands.
“So where is he now? I still need to have a serious chat with him about how he left the files, and the body!”
younger than him, he had met her in rehab. Kind, attentive, she was the first PT aide assigned to him. He had probably not demonstrated the finest of personal or professional judgement in undertaking a sexual relationship with someone in a caregiving role, but then, he had been in no mood to care about ethics and consequences, having recently returned and still trying to process the loss of his army and medical career. It hadn’t lasted long, their relationship - it was never destined to. He had progressed through the program and they had drifted apart, she wisely seeking someone who had more to offer than a physically damaged, emotionally unavailable veteran with no foreseeable future ...
When the image file arrived, John opened it to the sight of the Irishman looking straight into the security camera, blowing a kiss. John seethed, but his attention was quickly caught by the bundle under Moriarty's arm.
The precisely aimed barb found its target easily in an already wound up John who bit out, “I would if I knew where he was or how to get in contact with him!”
“What about the text messages, the other bodies?" John burst forth, demanding, no longer able to contain himself in the face of Moriarty’s seeming exoneration. "Moriarty has been involved in all of this since the beginning!”
He turned to head back down when suddenly Sherlock appeared in front of him, He appeared to be taken off guard and John wasn't even sure that Sherlock had seen him standing there until his saw a flash of realisation in his eyes.
was his second thought as he turned his head to the pillow besides his to find it empty, with no other sound to be heard in the flat.
“You like it?” Moriarty preened, turning over the label to examine the scarlet thread around the buttonhole. “It’s a bit …" the fingers of his hand fluttered, searching for a word, "
“You do realise that your fingerprints being found on a weapon at the scene of a crime is enough circumstantial evidence to justify an arrest?” Donovan warned.
By the time breakfast had been cleared from the table, the landscape passing by the window had changed from rural to urban.
John noted the desire in Sherlock’s eyes that he did not attempt to hide. As did Guerin. And with a self-satisfied smile, Guerin brought the evening to a close.
She led them down a hallway and out onto a metal walkway overlooking the warehouse floor. The set up was … impressive. Larger than it looked from the outside, it was split into four different sections. At the far end, open racking took up the majority of the space, forklifts moving in and out. To the right, an enclosed, temperature controlled storage area and to the left another. And right below them, a large glass roofed area housed what appeared to be a control room, with numerous pressure vessels, a bank of computer screens and some very scientific, very busy looking people. John shot a glance at Sherlock taking in every minute detail.
“Murder? Should it? The world can be quite a dark place, John,” she held his gaze “as I imagine you have already experienced. I can't say that I particularly like the brutal reality of the world men — and I do say men, because for the time being, they still hold most of the power — have created, but I am not going to shy away from it either.” Having said her piece, Sandrine eased back slightly in her chair, her gaze shifting to take both of them in now.
but he looked sincere. Sandrine smiled back and John started to wonder if the knock to his head hadn't been harder than he thought.
John harrumphed. He wasn't even in bloody uniform for Christ’s sake, but he conceded, (no need to call attention to his military service or his sexuality; same sex relations still being illegal in the country). Still, what exactly was there to draw anyone’s attention? Was it the polo shirt tucked in to the chinos? He
Two people dead, probably the third too because of him, because of a chance meeting in a pub with a goddamn psychopath. No, not chance - everything set in motion by Mycroft (bloody Mycroft!) years ago …
“Are you sure they're good?” Sandrine eyed them warily as she reached across John to fish a hair tie out of the glovebox and pull her hair back.
PS. And because I feel like I have so much to give back to a fandom that had given so much to me, I just wanted to add the following:
"About this. About what's going on, or any of this. About last night and what you are planning to do next."
Now, seated on one of the chairs set out around the main table where Lestrade had taken a seat next to Mycroft, Sally jerked her head for John to join her. He was just settling into his seat when the Coroner entered the chambers, settled herself in, and started to speak. So focused was John on his thoughts, that the first he noticed his fist clenching and unclenching was when he startled at the feel of another hand laying itself on top of his fingers, stilling them. He glanced quickly at Sally and she withdrew her hand, pursing her lips. The coroner’s voice slowly made its way back to him.
Releasing one of Sherlock's thighs, John reached for the cock that was bobbing rapidly between them. The deep groan Sherlock uttered when he gave it a firm stroke told him that Sherlock was close.
"Yeah, it'll do," Sherlock pronounced with a smirk, drawing John down to him ignoring the slight wince at the change in angle as he wrapped his arms around him.
rubbing the indents with his thumbs as his heart rate increased. His hands kept smoothing up Sherlocks neck, stopping to cradle his face
, that’s how Moriarty refers to himself. Rather catchy don’t you think?” There was a sly irony to Mycroft’s tone.

“Interview … this way,” he motioned John to follow him through the door and down the dim grey corridor to the room at the end. It was a room John was already familiar with, having accompanied Sherlock on his observations of a subject from the other side of the glass on more than one occasion. But being on this side, it was going to be different. And difficult.
When Sherlock shook his head, John wasn't entirely surprised. Sherlock was more than a little preoccupied at the moment and his focus on basic metabolic needs was never the most robust at the best of times.
In position, gun at the ready, John nodded and Sherlock headed in, crossing quickly across the control room and through the first airlock door of the testing lab. He eyed the protective suit hanging inside the door but didn't want to risk the extra time it would take to suit up
Drawing his shoulders back and his chin up, Holmes started off again, continuing his path down the cobbled street until his footfalls fell silent and his form was consumed by the grasping shadows.
John wasn't hungover, it took a lot more than three shots of whisky to do that, but he was definitely feeling the effects of spending the night dozing in and out of sleep in his chair. Though standing in one of the offices with Lestrade and Donovan, located off to the side of the holding cells at the Yard, he could feel the lethargy slipping away, being replaced by a sickening, nervous energy.

Sherlock was pretty sure that he could spend the rest of his life, right here, licking and sucking the length of John’s neck and listening to him whimper, eyes closed, neck arched back, the shivers running through his entire body making Sherlock shiver in return at every point their bodies touched.
Lestrade tried to bring Moriarty back again. “Where were you the night before last then, if you don't mind me asking?”
Breakfast appeared quickly after ordering. As John reached across the table to snag the marmalade for his toast the thought occurred to him that he actually didn't know how the case had come their way; it was too far outside Lestrade's jurisdiction, so that left the other usual suspect.
“No, it's not,” Sherlock echoed with a grimace as he lifted the glass to his lips. “But it is what it is.”
... an involuntary shudder racked Sherlock’s body as he closed his eyes to try and steady his (now shallowing) breathing and escalating pulse. John reached out to smooth the sweaty curls off Sherlock’s forehead and Sherlock burrowed into the touch.
But the case, this new case. He paced back again. This extraordinary, fascinating, scintillating case. A house, designed entirely by its eccentric owner, built by no less than five hundred expert tradesmen in the heart of Marrakech. A house that had seemingly not only driven its owner out, but also to his quite unpleasant death. And a perfumer, a chemist no less - the very thought of the secrets that house could reveal, would reveal, was irresistible. He had to have this case.
“Now,” John declared, rising to his feet and stripping his shirt off over his head in one fluid motion. “I know I said shower, but what is your position on, or, come to think of it,
John raised the gun to a raindrop on the window pane. Eye level, elbow bent slightly outward, he brought his right hand up to cradle the butt, thumb slightly below, applying equal pressure with both hands and locking his wrist.
In the inky near dark of their bedroom, he could just make out the steady rise and fall of the ex-army doctor’s bare chest, head to the side, star-burst of scarred flesh at his shoulder exposed, unguarded. He envied John’s surety, a soldier’s faith in his skills and his weapon.
“Sample testing for fungi, toxins, anything that would cause spoilage.” As if to demonstrate the point, movement on the other side of the door revealed a safety suit, gloves and eyewear being removed through the small pane of glass.
"With a middle-class background that wouldn't have put you in a position to pay off tuition fees outright, you would have had to apply for a student loan. Graduating and faced with double shifts where you only saw the inside of a hospital on graveyard shifts and saddled with a debt that would have taken you over a decade to work off, the idea of a life of excitement serving Queen and country along with the "golden hello" to clear your debts would have seemed quite appealing," Sherlock pronounced before smirking. "And ... what do the good girls like even more than a doctor, but … a soldier."

“Can’t they be looser? I am not going to be able to get out of these to help you if it goes wrong,” John started to worry.
“Involved, yes,” John squeezed his eyes tightly shut before opening them again, he really wasn't sure he could discuss this any longer. “Look, sorry ...”
Lestrade took a breath as he rubbed the back of his neck. “While there was initial evidence to suggest the involvement of Mr. Moriarty, he produced a corroborated alibi for the night in question and no subsequent evidence has come to light since then.”
In roughly the same amount of time it had taken him to locate Control Room A, Sherlock now found himself enveloped in the dark heavy, machinery of Switch Room B. Where A Station had been a study in preservation, B Station, always the less attractive of the pair, had been completely gutted, and the ground beneath his feet was mud pitted with the tracks of heavy machinery. No Italian marble or Art Deco stylings here; just function and purpose without the glamour. The Switch room gave way to a hoarded area behind it, and there in the semi-darkness, up against the pipes and vessels, in the cold damp concrete bunker, she was.
Despite lamenting the idiocy of the Yard's people at every given opportunity, Sherlock had a rare admiration for the Detective Inspector. Sherlock knew Lestrade’s dedication, had him currently poured over the case files spread out on his kitchen table, all the while trying desperately to ignore the nicotine cravings that always seem to worsen at night.

“Oi, that'll do,” Lestrade had called out, hands raised in an attempt to quiet the rabble as John had slipped, nearly shattered, under his arm and into the low brownstone building. “I'll be giving a statement when this is done, you can all just settle down until then.”
Sherlock declined to respond, his strop now reaching maximum velocity, and pushing back from the table announced “I think I will take that shower now.”

He had just placed his keys on the tray by the door and hung up his coat when the call came through from Lestrade.
And so we come to the end of this fic. I took my time in writing the final chapters of this one - it’s been my constant companion for so many months now, that I found it kind of hard to let go. So I let it happen in its own time and enjoyed every minute it took (apologies for the delay while I indulged).
Guerin nodded graciously, enticingly. “Of course. I will be back tomorrow morning and can take you through them. And perhaps a personal tour of my laboratory, if you are interested?”
Mycroft simply looked back at him impassively until John reluctantly removed his hands from the man's lapels and took a step back.
“Just tell him I'm here and want to have a word,” John wasn't going to move from the spot and Donovan knew it.
Sherlock was at a loss. Moriarty was succeeding in destroying John before his eyes - his latest blow delivered with clinical precision - and Sherlock seemed incapable of stopping him.
John took a deep breath, straightened his shoulders and grit his teeth. Here we go, he thought, as Sandrine started to march him inside.
“Your brother does care about you, Sherlock,” Lestrade carefully (and perhaps a little unwisely) pointed out.
, go deduce some passengers, but nicely!" John waggled his finger at him. “I want to stay on this bloody train!”
Why he found himself taken aback each and every time Sherlock reverted to his intractable self, he could not fathom, but surprised
He pushed himself downwards over Sherlocks lithe frame until he was kneeling between his parted legs, Sherlocks feet firmly planted on the bed, knees spread wide.
John’s mind’s journey from confused to suspicious took less than a second. “Why? Where are you going?”
John hadn't really looked to Sherlock since he entered the room and as he made to do so now, he wondered what he would find.

While the inspiration for this fic was of course the extraordinary life of Serge Lutens, his beautiful house and his captivating words, this is not a story about Serge Lutens. This is fiction, pure and simple.
Moriarty smirked and leaned back in his chair. With exaggerated nonchalance, he threw his hands open.  "Feel free. There are cameras in the lifts and stairwells of The Ned. They like to keep tabs on their guests, for their own protection. Oh, I just remembered,” he put a finger to his mouth in a dramatic gesture. "We have a witness. Do interview that nice boy who delivered the room service; I'm afraid he got quite an eyeful. I invited him to join in, but the poor chap just bolted. Didn't even wait for a tip."
After about five minutes of chewing, John was relieved to see the tremors in Sherlock’s body start to subside. Gathering himself, Sherlock pushed off from the railing and turned to lean his back against it, facing John.

And now, amidst coming to terms with the death of yet another person in his name and embarrassed about having to discuss the nature of his relationship with the victim, John’s main concern seemed to be what Sherlock thought about all this.
. He tried to shake the image of Sherlock, unconscious to everything being done to him on that stretcher in that room under the pale green light. And with it, he tried to shake the terrifying knowledge that if things had gone slightly differently, if he had taken a drink himself, that things could have, would have, ended in disaster. He suppressed a shiver and rearranged himself in the chair, using his physicality to try and ground himself in the here and now.
What had he been saying about impatient git, John chuckled. He should add impervious bastard to that characterization as well, he thought fondly.

A sense of duty, to queen and country, was something Mycroft had arrived with, straight out of the womb. Not something that Sherlock cared about, one way or the other. And Mycroft had dedicated himself at an early age to the ranks of the civil service to honor that calling. A less obvious commitment than shouldering a rifle, perhaps, but with the same deadly effect. Sherlock had always taken it for granted that measured against a civil servant like Mycroft, or a soldier like John, he would come up lacking in the "duty" department.
John showed Lestrade to the pool area and then headed downstairs to the bathroom where Sherlock was banging about loudly.
Slowly at first, despite Sherlock's insistence to the contrary, a long slide in and out as Sherlock shifted his hips beneath him searching for the right angle. John knew they had it when the string of "yeses" became "more's" and "harder's".
John crossed the room and headed to the bathroom. Before the handle had pronounced the door’s closure, John’s next words floated back to Sherlock. “And then the ferry.”
“Well then, by all means, let’s keep trying to get me in handcuffs, then shall we? Now ... where exactly did this
Alt text: Eleven. S. life is an act of faith, in this godless world. J. Here where you are now. Without me.
Lestrade took a breath and turned to Molly. "Molly, you are clearly very busy, but would you mind showing us the body?"
Sandrine eyes flickered in amusement at the droll inflection. “Raw product. Refined product. Extraction. Import, export. We source plant matter and oil from all over the world; lotus from India, lavender from Bulgaria, rose from here in Morocco, borage from China and agarwood from Indonesia, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea. Anywhere that provides the best quality and has a reliable supply. Some are easier to come by, some more difficult. With an inflated consuming market, for example, agarwood is rarer and more valuable than gold at the moment.”
"That's it, I've got you," John cooed as he applied a bit more pressure with his tongue and his finger, the latter slipping easily in up to the second knuckle.
“Then get something on him,” John snapped, then his face winced, instantly contrite. “Yeah, sorry about that.”
) changes of trains, Sherlock was quite convinced that Dr John Watson’s days on this earth were becoming seriously numbered.  However  he found himself, as he settled into the compartment of their second train, pleasantly surprised
As John was in the middle of dishing out the eggs and did not look like he was going to make a move to answer it, Sherlock huffed in annoyance (which he noted, John proceeded to ignore as well) and headed to the door.
Good god John tasted divine. Warm, salty, intense, combined with a lingering hint of the spices from the medina. Heady, the throbbing pulse under Sherlocks tongue matched his own, beat for beat.
John had started off low, but by the end he was practically shouting the less-than-a-foot distance across the table at distinctly ill-at-ease looking Mycroft.
Whilst Sherlock posited himself as only being in The Game for the resultant high of solving the puzzle, the thrill of cracking the case, John knew differently. John knew Sherlock believed that all that was necessary for evil to prevail was for good men to do nothing. What John wasn't so sure of, was whether Sherlock realised that he himself was one of those good men.
Making his way to the table in the centre of the room, Moriarty drew one chair off to the side and placed the other in the middle of the table opposite Donovan and Lestrade, who had in the meantime taken his seat. Then, whipping the tails of the Belstaff out with the overly dramatic flare of a concert pianist assuming his place at the piano before performing his first piece, Moriarty took his seat and leaned forward intently, hands clasped together and eyes overly helpfully wide.
John woke to the sound of drawers opening and closing and the rustle of clothing. Sherlock was never the most considerate of domestic partners in the morning. And when he wanted the other person, namely John, to abandon sleep for whatever endeavour he was focused on, he became even less so.
And John had his own mission. As he headed out the door, he passed Molly who seemed on the verge of tears. He flashed her what he hoped was a reassuring look. She nodded back, the words "you have to find him" written across her face.
“No fun, Detective Inspector,” Moriarty pouted, looking up from his position hovering across the table.
Just one word. Holmes turned on his heel and strode away and Watson’s startled gaze chased his retreating figure. Lestrade called out frustratedly, “Oi, I was hoping for a bit more than that!"
Sherlock heard them before he saw them. Half an hour later, eleven of the Yard's finest, approaching the crime scene like a gaggle of tourists viewing the Tower of London for the first time.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, encouraging one eye open to assist him in seeking the tablets from John's palm with his long fingers.

“The first order of business then, will be to establish the scope and conduct of the inquest. At this stage I would like to ask family members and other participants to raise any issues, particularly ones that they believe could be contentious, so that we can avoid, as much as possible, any surprises at the actual hearing. Perhaps Mr. Holmes,” she looked to Mycroft, “as the representative of the Holmes family, you could start us off.”
They sat for a while in the quiet of their own thoughts, the rain outside picking up to beat a steady staccato against the glass panes. Having given himself in to the nothingness, John was then a little startled to look up at one point and find Sherlock studying him intently.
Truth be told, all warmth had been stolen as soon as Sherlock had told him to leave. Go where? Sherlock hadn't said. But the message was clear.
"I really don't know, Molly," John rubbed the back of his neck as he avoided her hopeful gaze and instead studied the files in front of her. Then he looked up at her. “Hey, is there any place you know of that Sherlock hangs out in when he's here?
archives mentioning the fire, the two deaths and the survival of the child but nothing more. A reference on the Galway Blazers hunt club website to its “esteemed” (John treated that word to an eye roll and a huff) patron, one Jim Moriarty. But aside from that, not a lot more.
“You know it’s not that easy for me to just turn it all off,” Sherlock grumbled, albeit halfheartedly, titling his head back to rest his mouth against John's carotid artery.
It was more than a little bit overwhelming, to be honest, to be standing there, having flayed his heart wide open and invited John on in. There was a tremor in his fingers and a murmur in his breathing that he had never felt before.
be having a conversation about it upon Sherlock’s return. Resolved on that issue, he was however, still at a loss as to what exactly what was up with Sherlock. Not unusually, he had no idea where to begin in figuring out that puzzle, but he did have a very good idea about where to start on another. Putting the kettle on, he gathered his laptop from his bedroom, used his forearm to plough the remnants of one of Sherlock’s long-since abandoned experiments to one side of the kitchen table, and settled himself in for the duration.
“S’good,” Sherlock mumbled. “Go get yourself something to eat .. and, have a shower, you smell,” his eyes opened and his mouth turned up at the corner as he gave John’s thigh a playful push to get him moving.
“The crucifixion is not technically or historically accurate so most likely staged for shock value rather than a depiction of Christian iconography. And the flower - it’s been used for centuries as suicidal aid, to cure madness and to poison enemies. In folklore witches were also said to summon demons with it.”
Sherlock took the Talisker down from the cabinet with one hand and hooked the fingers of his other into a couple of tumblers from the shelf below. He set the two cut crystal glasses down on the mantelpiece above the hearth and after filling them both, handed one to John and held the other up in mock salute.
, a turquoise dinosaur. And if that wasn’t enough, Sherlock’s mind still reeling at the vision presented by the top half of the man’s body, what greeted him when his eyes drifted further down to .. cut-off fraying denim shorts. Where was that memory-erasing Rohypnol when he needed it?

As keyed up as they both now were, this wasn't going to last long, but John didn't mind, and Sherlock who was always and forever an impatient git, didn't look like he was going to mind either.
he was, just the same. His entire way home, past tube station after tube station, through platform change after platform change, John’s mood vacillated between annoyance and reflection. Annoyance In general at Sherlock's behaviour (
After some thorough searching and an overly animated but nonetheless fruitless conversation in which he tried to explain the nature of the issue to one of the wait staff in the restaurant, John finally spied someone who might be able to help him out.
Donovan had already taken her seat at the table. The interview room door opened, and John took a deep steadying breath as Lestrade led the way, opening the door to allow Moriarty to saunter in … with another person on his heel ...
“Hungry?” John proffered his bag of crisps as they crossed the airport concourse to the taxi rank outside.
When John, standing over him, shook a finger an inch from Sherlock's face, the man didn't even flinch. "You, you. Don't bloody tell me to calm down. You don't get to tell me to calm down. What is it with you Holmes’ always telling people to CALM DOWN?" He drew a deep breath and then challenged. "You think you can win this thing against Moriarity don't you? You're never going to win, Sherlock. He's never going to let you win."
“Don't worry, John, I will be leading the way. It would be a little bit difficult to shoot you in the back from the front, don’t you think?”
He took a deep breath. Then, placing backward pressure on the trigger at the precise moment of exhalation ...
Sometimes I see people expressing the fear that they don’t think that they write well enough or that they don’t think they are as good as other writers in the fandom. Me? I don’t know whether I write well enough, or whether I am as good as the other fic writers out there. But there is something I do know, and that is that I love to write, to create, to bring the scenes in my mind to life on the page. The stuff I wrote in the beginning is probably not as good as the stuff I have written recently, but you know what? It’s mine. It’s part of my journey. It’s how I got here. And I’m keeping every last flawed word of it. So to everyone who has that love, who wants to create and bring worlds to life and maybe is a bit nervous about doing it, I encourage you all to just do what you love.
John turned towards him, squaring his shoulders. “Linda Kearney, a PT aide at Headley Court in Surrey. I spent six weeks there after I returned, and then a few months as an outpatient.
He dropped the pistol and cocked his head to the side, tracking the path of the raindrop, which, having been joined by another, slithered down to the bottom of the frame under the extra weight.
Soft gentle touches increased in intensity until the small distance between them became too much. John pushed himself up onto his knees, bringing Sherlock with him. Tongues tasted more strongly, fingers gripped more tightly, stiffened cocks rubbed against each other maddeningly until John broke away with a gasp.
“Voluntarily?” John's eyebrows raised significantly along with his tone as he turned to face Sherlock. “You want to tell me what the bloody hell is going on, Sherlock? You keeping me in the dark is starting to piss me off.”
Sherlock reached into his trouser pocket, presumably for a lighter, but instead dislodged a used epi-pen which tumbled noisily to John's feet. Sherlock's eyelids fluttered slightly in alarm before he was able to school his features back into an unreadable mask.

"Just the preliminary ones. The others will take a few days. It’s … unlikely that they will yield a different result though," Lestrade cautioned.
“Doesn't mean it’s him,” John looked from Lestrade and Donovan who, in his absence, had seated themselves on the couch. “The blood at the other scene was taken earlier.”
For one tiny moment John was stunned into thinking that perhaps Sherlock was, for the first time, admitting to a personal flaw, but then he went on.
John stomped angrily down the stairs from the cab rank to the tube station below, each step punctuated by a muttered curse;
The room was quiet until Mycroft spoke, cool, calm and dispassionate. “The family has no reason to believe anything other than the Met’s preliminary findings.”
With those two hardly audible words, John’s shoulders fell and the tension that had held him hostage all night long seeped out to be replaced by a depth of weariness. “I know,” he sighed as he made his way back over to Sherlock’s side, reclaiming his position on the bed and drawing Sherlock’s hand into his lap. “I know you are, it’s just … it was, I was … just so
but what on earth had gotten into John in the meantime? He needed to study this new development very closely, but no need to alert John to his interest just yet.
Standing in the open cell doorway, Lestrade watched Sherlock pace back and forth in the confines of the small room. “You need a

Beautiful, flawless alabaster skin over lean muscle and flesh. Such a carefully elusive heart and a shimmeringly brilliant mind. But beneath it all, beneath the bespoke suits, the acerbic tongue and the impatience with the idiocy of the world, simply and overwhelmingly, a man who loved him.
John hadn't quite managed to get a read on Sandrine and the fact that she was the only one of them currently armed was making him more than a little uncomfortable. He didn't think that she had been a soldier despite the fact that she carried an Egyptian-made military issue Beretta Helwan 920, however he was quite sure that she knew
. He shook his head to clear the strangeness and brought his attention back to Sherlock who had in that time, turned back to the Land Rover. John climbed back into the vehicle. Sherlock drew the rear passenger door open and fished around in his overnight bag. John watched as he drew out the container of leeches and bent to release them in the ditch alongside the road. Still without saying a word, he tossed the now empty container in the back, shut the passenger door and climbed into the driver seat. Sherlock silently turned the key in the engine, swinging the vehicle back out into the road. John glanced back one last time.
Behind him, Sherlock heard John divesting himself of his own clothing, tossing his jeans and jumper over the arm of the chair and his shirt in the laundry basket.
He was prepared for … well, he didn't quite know what, but the images he was greeted with were not overly graphic in nature. Not the mutilated bodies from the field or the unidentifiable corpses from many of their previous cases. The victim,
“Sending smoke signals John? You know the cell phone reception here is actually quite adequate.” John turned sharply to take in Sherlock leaning against the doorframe, one eyebrow hitched, his mirth belying the dark circles under his eyes, the strain in his face and his body.
) all the way to the end of the building, stopping just short of the buzz of activity generated by the whirling forklifts.
And just like that, Sherlock, his Sherlock was back. And John smiled inwardly as he knew they would never speak of this experience again.
Behind the glass, John’s head throbbed. He couldn't tell if he needed something to drink or somewhere to throw up, to sit down or to stay standing. All he knew was he was seeing the colour red, and through the crimson tint, the grinning man who had killed the most important person in John’s life and the accomplice whose alibi just enabled Sherlock’s killer to walk free.
An image of leaning against the wall, shoulder to shoulder with Sherlock at the bottom of the stairs at Baker Street flashed through his mind and then abruptly left him when …
“The office. There’s a drawing of a panther in his office. Okay, this is what is going to happen,” John cut to the chase. “I’m going to be the bait. Sandrine is going to bring me to Guerin. We all get inside the house that way, with you hidden in the back.”
Sherlock looked down at the cigarette held unlit between two delicate fingers. "A useful stimulant."
Standing on the roof of Barts, on the top of the world, in the golden hue of dusk, John it felt like he had taken a punch to the gut.
She glanced at Sherlock and then back at John looking vaguely terrified, obviously he was just making things worse, so John decided to just shut up and wait. As it turned out, they didn't have to wait long, as a harried Lestrade, in suit and tie, arrived carrying a large file box, a few minutes later.
"That sensitivity relates to the highly unusual situation of having a crime scene that implies a death has taken place, but the body is not present. Am I to understand, Detective Inspector, that there has been no further progress in the attempt to locate a body?"
“An antique amputation knife?” Moriarty shrugged, leaning back into his chair again. “Not really my style.”
“She didn't let go of it to struggle against him, or to try and stop the blade, she let it happen. Why? Why would she do that. It doesn't make sense.”
Lestrade had, as promised, had sent John copies of the test results as soon as they had come in and John had spent every waking minute trying to prove the science wrong, trying to find an alternate explanation for the facts as Sherlock's words rang in his ears.
All of a sudden, the daze lifted and John was beset by a sea of black, blinding rage. Keeping his eyes fixed on Moran he tried to focus on what Lestrade was saying but he could feel the tiny hairs on the back of his neck prickle. As a thin film of sweat started to build at his hairline, John re-focused just in time to hear Lestrade finishing up with the same crushing words the coroner had just spoken being repeated. “.... A full jury inquest is being scheduled."
The Queen’s Gambit, one of the oldest known chess openings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit
"You know what," John suddenly pitched the auto-injector at the ground, the plastic case splintering, sending the blue cap flying across the concrete, startling Sherlock and causing him to jerk his head up suddenly. "I really don't give a shit about why you think you need nicotine or any other stimulant … because clearly you don't give a shit about all the people who were worried about you today. Lestrade, Molly …" his voice trailed off, too hurt now at Sherlock's lack of response to add his own name to the list.
Watson considered how he could possibly express the complexity of such an emotion. Faith had no rationality. It had no sense. Instead, he held Holmes’ gaze, placed his left hand gently on the extraordinary mans forearm and replied softly, “neither does love.”
“Always. Variables in climate, soil quality and agricultural practices all play a part. But government policy, market performance, environmental quality and the efficiency of natural resource use have the most significant impact, it’s managing those variables that proves the most difficult.”
John pushed past Lestrade, darted under the crime scene tape and dashed inside the church, Lestrade yelling after him.
"I dunno, Greg," John wandered down the hall to the kitchen, confirming his next words as he went. "He hasn't been home … have you tried his phone?"
“Not quite,” and for the first time there was a hesitation to Mycroft’s next words, “… he is the fire.”
Gritting his teeth he willed himself to calm down but before he knew it, he was rounding on Sherlock again, challenging. "You aren't going to tell me, are you?"
“So, I’m just wondering if you'd care to revise your explanation as to how you have come to have it in your possession?” Lestrade suggested.
“This is Sandrine,” John introduced, turning in his seat to face the back. “Sandrine this is Greg Lestrade.” Greg extended his hand forward for Sandrine to shake, “and Sebastian,” John indicated.
Moriarty’s lip curled slightly in annoyance. Then he raised his hand and summoned Moran to the table and gestured to the evidence bag.
Watson cast his mind back to the body. Exactly like the rest, he had thought; same wounds, same bruising, same assailant. But she had been different. He considered the peacefulness. Giving it over to the repose of her body, he hadn't thought much of it at the time. But upon reflection, with the exception of the marks on her throat and jaw and the evidence of her blood loss all around her, she hadn't looked like her last breath had been taken in fear.
“It’s okay,” he had assured her quickly. Perhaps too quickly but he couldn't cope with her guilt for the way she had been around Sherlock on top of the pile of his own guilt threatening to suffocate him.
Sherlock was about to insist but then glancing at the clock on the wall and back down the hall to their bedroom, conceded, "no, not now, but first thing tomorrow, with all the paperwork."
. Sherlock stomped off to his bedroom. If the only way he was going to get John to come along with him was for him to endure the monotony of the public transportation system, then so be it. Sherlock had a strong mind. Sherlock had an iron will. And if put to it, he could, with his single bloody-minded focus, achieve anything. Indeed, he could, and he would, he decided, survive the tediously mind-numbing journey of John's dictate.
Lestrade seemed to be vacillating, struggling with something but then resolved to ask, carefully.“I don't suppose you know what Moriarty's blood type is?”
“So, you see,” Moriarty was grinning now, all teeth. “Not my first choice of weapon. Would serve in a pinch but not very useful for extended blood play.”
If Lestrade had been hoping that the revelation would throw Moriarty, he was about to be disappointed.
he had chased down the man at the top. The Detective Inspector had been tied up, beaten unconscious and left for dead; it took him weeks to recover. Sherlock simply does not consider the consequences of his actions, nor their implications for those with whom he works…or lives, in your case."

) would have needed to arrive as unobtrusively as possible. So he had the cabbie drop him off at a construction service road at the rear of A Station; no expensive equipment, just piles of dirt and rubble - so no surveillance cameras. He pushed against the chain link fence and the lock swung free in invitation.
In the end Sherlock had begrudgingly done it, but not before snarkily informing John that he would be patching up any injuries he incurred as a result. John had told him not to be ridiculous, but in the end, there were injuries - to Molly’s pride and to Sherlock’s face. Truth be told, John was exceedingly impressed at the accuracy of the slap, but took care not to mention it to Sherlock as he handed him an ice pack to accompany his epic five-hour sulk on the lounge.
Mycroft pushed his cup away from him, having consumed none of it and stood, clearly considering the conversation over. He paused as he pushed his chair back under the table.
Read without inflection in Lestrade's easy Somerset-come-London lilt, the words spoken into the hushed hum of the brightly lit room seemed even more obscene than when John had first heard them on the recording, and he couldn't help but flinch.
“I spoke to the morgue in Galway, they are not there now,” the Gardaí apologized and then rallied. “But I was able to arrange for them to be there tomorrow for you … but not until midday — Sunday service first…”
about dying for one’s country. John knew that from years on the front line, months in Camp Bastion and all the time spent piecing together bodies in the improvised field medical stations in between. War, as far as he had borne witness, was nothing but blood, and dust.
“Not looking for him, looking for Lestrade,” John stated, stopping just short of the barrier and crossing his arms.
Watson contemplated joining Holmes by the hearth but could not tell, from this distance or the back of his head, whether he would welcome the company. However, Holmes’ next words beckoned him closer.

And of course, John had forgotten his bloody coat, so even the mildness of the Autumn night was chilling when he eventually left the roof. He walked around Smithfield, through Russell Square and a hundred other places, to let the cold of the night distract him from the pain of Sherlock’s words.
Stripping down to his pants and hanging his suit in the wardrobe, Sherlock wondered what it was that he had done to deserve this extraordinary man in his life. John, who not only saw him at his worst and was able to ride out the maelstrom of his black moods and tantrums, but who also saw in him something worth having.
Greeting him with a thin lipped nod, John stood back, allowing Mycroft to enter first and then following him to take a seat at one of the square laminate tables toward the back.

Sherlock glared at John as he launched himself up off the seat and out through the compartment door in a flurry of woollen Belstaff. It closed behind him with a sharp bang. John winced. And then John began to worry. What had seemed like a brilliantly devised
), John knew that Sherlock was about 30 seconds away from hacking into the laptop that was sitting on the desk when there was a knock and the door slowly opened.
Lestrade sighed and winced as he brought a hand up to the back of his neck, rubbing it roughly before looking back to John reluctantly.
Clearly trying (and failing) to keep up with the speed of Sherlock’s queries, Frank grasped onto Sherlock’s last question. “No, no one works overnight. We really don’t need many people to run the facility. Aside from ensuring that the leeches are developing as planned and transferring them between the tanks as they grow, the only other thing apart from packaging for shipment is exercising them twice a day.”
like a seat?” Lestrade offered, jerking his head to Moran still standing near the door. “Is he your solicitor?”
“Fancy place. But don’t you keep a residence in London?” Lestrade queried, looking down at his notepad and back up again at Moriarty. “Royalty Mews, Soho, I believe?”
“Jesus, Sherlock,” his words came out breathy and slightly weak, his eyes drawn down the smooth planes of Sherlock’s chest to his lean abdominal muscles.
Still slightly flushed from his mental meanderings, John turned back to the sink and gestured, without looking, to Sherlock to take a seat. “Sit down before you fall down”.

At the back of Sherlock's mind, there was a niggling worry that yes, John was probably right, that talking first was probably a good idea — a sensible, rational, practical idea. But when his teeth accidently grazed John’s pulse point and John growled — actually growled in response — his desire to see this through completely over-rode that concern.

John held his eyes tightly closed, pinching the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger as the sheer volume of thoughts threatened to overwhelm him.
(John's thoughts were accompanied by a mental eye roll). Interactions occurring courtesy of Mycroft Holmes’ elusive club membership were either orchestrations of foreign government downfall or the indulgence of  particular sexual  fantasies; the true nature of the Diogenes Club. Not that John minded (the sexual fantasies bit that is), he just wished he could indulge himself a whole lot  more. And he also wasn't keen on all the pretence;
“No. Average middle class family. Mother worked in the local post office, father was ... a gardener at one of the nearby estates I think. Nothing remarkable about either of them … except that at age six, Moriarty figured out that his parents had absolutely nothing to offer him intellectually or monetarily ...”
Sherlock pushed himself off the wall, flicking the end of his cigarette onto the ground in front of him. “Oh John, they just think I'm an eccentric Englishman, you know, mad dogs and all that,” he gestured to his Belstaff and the still-burning-at-4pm sun before smirking again. “Or maybe they just didn't like your shirt.”
“No, not for the time being. If you should decide to leave London in the next few days, you need to let my people know. You are still under investigation for what part you may have played in the death of Sherlock Holmes.”
of interests. Easily bored,” he explained with a wink. "Seb here shares some of them; we both like knives, antique ones like the one you've got in that bag. Are you sure that it's in the museum inventory? After all, someone could have just dropped it in place."
Behind the glass, John bristled, the features of his face pinching and his fingers curling painfully into a fist by his side. He felt the officer with him in the room tense up, so he shoved his fist deep into his pocket, trying to use the feeling of the metal rings to ground him.
washroom in their compartment to try and arrange himself into some semblance of a functioning human being. As he brushed his teeth and shook off the last remnants of sleep from his body he peered resignedly in the mirror at the bags under his eyes
He couldn't have been bothered to close the curtains last night and he was grateful now, as he wiggled his toes in the warm bands of light criss-crossing the duvet.
. His mind went to the small box he had hidden underneath the vests in the cupboard since Morocco, and the two bands of gold that lay within; soon, when this case was over. And he very much meant to return Sherlock’s whispered sentiment, but sleep overtook him first.
Then to the side, John caught a glimpse of an untidy pile of clothes saturated in blood and (he squinted to make it out) ... a single black Yves St Laurent Oxford shoe poking out from underneath.
Bringing up the rear, in a crumbled cheap suit, and announcing his arrival with a “bloody hell” was of course Detective Inspector Lestrade. And to be fair, the scene was … to say the least, dramatically staged. Strung up on a three horizontal, rusted pipes, between two large supporting vessels, the victim was naked, arranged in a pose of crucifixion, arms wide, legs together and head bowed, hair completely obscuring her face.
), John pushed off against the edge of the bench and reclaimed his seat. He continued his research for the next couple of hours. At one point he got up to dump a can of chicken noodle soup unceremoniously into a saucepan and throw a couple of slices of bread into the toaster. But soon, even food couldn't sustain him. His eyelids began to droop under the glare of the screen, the weight of the day and the fruitlessness of his endeavour.
“Nothing for the last little while, but Sherlock started off talking about a panther,” Sebastian raised his eyebrows in question.
“ … he found a way to replace them with people who could. An aunt and uncle in Dublin. Old money; forebears founded the Irish Kennel Club or some such ghastly endeavour. Both relatively intelligent, but their true value was in the access they could provide to the best educational institutions and with it persons of influence. Moriarty kept them around until they outlived their usefulness; they died in a car accident the month before he left for university”.
“Other product challenges, apart from price?” Sherlock steepled his fingers under his chin thoughtfully, elbows resting on his thighs.
Left open for ease of the killer (and now his) access. A gift he was grateful for in that it was going to save him from having to go in through the roof. Though it still would have been a great deal easier to have been doing all this without his overnight bag …
, Sherlock,” John rose wearily from the chair that had housed him for the night and crossed to the side of the bed, placing himself close — but not too close — to Sherlock’s petulantly flopping limbs.
John tried to drown out the inner voice of worry by concentrating on the sound of his footfalls down the stairs. Entering the morgue, his eyebrows narrowed when his eyes lit on the victim's body, out on the table and the figure of Molly hovering worriedly above it. His gaze went next to Lestrade, bent over a table examining something with another officer. And as he walked over towards the table he saw it; a phone with a smashed screen, the same model as Sherlock's.
Fifty-three bags - that was as far as he had gotten by the time Lestrade had filled and returned with the other two cups.
It took another 15 minutes for Sandrine to weave the Jeep through the maze of fractured, dripping streets to Guerin’s house.
His dreams were muddied, rapidly transitioning images. Getting into a cab, daylight. He’s texting. Texting whom? Texting why? John is next to him - no, in front of him. Driving the cab. He’s angry. Saying something. Shouting. He’s getting out of the cab, now it’s night. The cab is still moving. He doesn’t fall but then there’s Lestrade standing next to him;
Yes, Sherlock had been a pain in the arse, but no more than usual, and John certainly would never consider doing this to him on purpose.
Sherlock followed reluctantly (and for the time being, obediently) as Guerin directed him out the door. However, just before he exited, and out of the line of sight of Guerin, Sherlock removed one of the plates from his pocket and dropped it onto the toe of his shoe, the leather muffling its fall, before easing it to the ground. He slid it into place, and hoped his trust was not misplaced as he proceeded to walk in front of Guerin, not permitting himself to look back.
Nothing in the files, nothing on the bodies, and despite his considerable efforts to the contrary, nothing on the recording that could be used in evidence.
As Moriarty paused in the doorway, chewing exaggeratedly on the gum in his mouth and then running his tongue along the inside of his cheek, distending the skin obscenely, John felt the dull knife that had lodged itself permanently in the space between his ribs twist nastily as he realised what Moriarty was wearing. It hung slightly longer on his shorter frame, but it was definitely ...
John had cast a suspicious glance at the coffee as it was poured into their cups, but he had taken Sherlock's cue that it was safe and started drinking himself. Not that it wasn't inconceivable, Sherlock allowed, the heavy spices in the dark coffee would easily conceal any trace chemical bitterness.

But nothing, not retreating to his mind palace nor starving his brain of sleep was helping to summon the brilliance that he currently needed. And the low insistent hum reminding him that there was something that he was missing, wasn’t allowing him to sleep now.
“This last date?” Lestrade placed the evidence bag containing Sherlock's phone on the table and proceeded to read an excerpt from the transcript of the recording Donovan handed him.
He'd thought his journey back from Afghanistan had been tough. He'd thought he'd known how far a person could fall. He'd been wrong. Because lying on the burning sand, the blood pouring from his shoulder, he had pleaded to live. But now ...
Over the course of this journey I also had the absolute, (and if I am being completely honest), terrifying honor, of meeting two of this fandom’s most prolific writers; @7-percent and @jbaillier. If you know anything about this fandom, you know that both of them, together and separately, have written universes and universes of mind-blowing prose about these most beloved of characters, their cases, friendships and their loves. And over the course of a traditional English afternoon tea I discovered (having more or less been able to choke down my petrified indigestion), that @7-percent and I shared a love of all things Moriarty ...
“What?” Sherlock looked up dimly from under the fringe lying limply across his forehead. “And deny you the pleasure of subjecting me to yet another tediously long, unfathomably unnecessary journey on public transportation? Why would I do that when I am clearly enjoying it so ...”
A quick mental calculation of the volume present, put it at about two litres - about 30 to 40 percent of an adult's total blood volume and the rate of coagulation and discolouration pointed to it having taken place mere hours ago.
Moran came to stand off to the side of Moriarty’s left shoulder, hands clasped behind his back. He took a quick look down at the knife and then stared straight ahead, chin jutted out. “Seven inches of high-quality steel. Long straight blade. Efficient enough for a single stoke, but rapidly decreasing in effectiveness the more incisions required. The victim would need to be immobilized at the time for it to do any real damage.”
Only it wasn’t his stuffily suited, condescending snooty pratt of an obnoxiously annoying brother standing in the doorway with a ridiculously goofy grin on his face, it was
And so it continued for a number of seconds before Lestrade, took his cue to leave them to it.  “You guys got a pool around here?”
“Freak’s not here,” she stated, holding the crime scene tape firmly down in place in front of him as he approached.
“Estimated to be 30% total blood volume for an adult male; the amount is considered …" Lestrade paused before continuing, "catastrophic. Medical opinion says survival is not possible.”
"Brilliant, fucking brilliant," John proclaimed his smile wide, joined by a returning smile from Sherlock.
John opened his eyes and stubbornly forced his chin up. It had started to rain, delicately, against the cloudy pane of glass in front of him, tiny splodges distorting the view.
Moran rubbed his jaw consideringly, and then, looking across to John he grinned as he shook his head at Lestrade's question and then took his leave.
Lestrade's face appeared to crumple in worry (and perhaps a bit of guilt for the stroppy messages) but there was work to be done and Lestrade got to it, pointing the officer in the direction of the security office with instructions to locate the existence of any and all CCTV footage.
"You’re a doctor, John,” Donovan pointed out carefully, “you know no one could have lost that much blood and lived.”
Yes. Shaved legs, that was different. Adding a different element to his bedroom repertoire? No, John hadn't had a date in weeks, or maybe that was months now? Sherlock shook his head, it was unlike him not to keep track of such things; maybe he had been a little bit more distracted by his cases than he had first thought? A newly found obsession with road cycling? Hardly, Sherlock scoffed, if the
John clenched his fists under the table, trying to stifle the urge to raise his voice. "You owe me that much. You owe Sherlock that much," he finished evenly, trying to pretend he hadn’t heard the catch in his own throat as he spoke Sherlock’s name. It didn’t matter. John wasn’t above laying down the guilt card.
“No, not now, but you do, don’t you? And I carry mine for what I assume would be rather the same reason you carry yours. It provides some … additional insurance.”
“It is my determination that the balance of evidence at this stage suggests that a jury must decide between suicide or death by misadventure.”
With only one way in and one way out, the testing laboratory was a literal trap, so it had been decided that John would stand sentry while Sherlock retrieved the samples.
“You’ll have to ask him,” Moriarty replied, flinging one arm over the back of the chair beside him and leaning back, crossing an ankle over his knee. He let his eyes drift up to the ceiling, clearly signaling how bored he was of the situation.
As it turned out, he must have managed to get a few hours sleep because towards dawn, his mind swam into wakefulness to the sound of John's voice, lying on his back, whispering to the ceiling.
@johnlocklover221/@Dovahlock221 on AO3 and BakerEdits on YouTube, I know I have said it before, but I do hope you know how fundamentally important you were in the shaping of A Dead Man's Money. From the moment you gave me the genesis of the fic when I asked you for a suggestion of a track that would represent Sherlock and Moriarty's battle, to the playlist you made that helped shape each and every chapter. This fic would not be anything without your lyrical interpretation. You have an absolute gift. And whether you make it your career or it remains a treasured hobby, what you have is extraordinary 😘
John sighed but then resolved — this was after all what he had willingly and knowingly signed himself up for when he embarked on a relationship with the man.
Sherlock was a firm proponent of the belief that the only way to learn was by playing the game; win, lose, advance, retreat, things only mattered if there was something at risk. And just as John had been such a quick study of The Work, he showed an equally remarkable aptitude for learning The Game.
“I highly doubt that," Lestrade responded. "Sherlock Holmes really isn't the gift giving type. But ... assuming that he did, when exactly did you receive this “gift” from him?”
From physical harm perhaps. A bullet to stop a bullet. A sword to stop a sword. But what to stop a mind? There was no doubt Moriarty was a genius, a brilliant mind. And a brilliant mind required a brilliant mind, not one struggling to catch up. The razor sharp deductions, the nuances that had always shone so brightly for him had become dull since Ireland, since the unmasking of their foe.
And for a man who never said please any other time, Sherlock said it an awful lot at times like this. John quite liked hearing it.
“And deprive you of the opportunity to look after both of us? I wouldn't dare,” Sherlock grinned at the back of John’s head as he followed him out of their compartment.
The DI changed tack and pushed the transcript across the desk to Moriarty. “You and Sherlock Holmes chatted the night before last.”
consulting detective did not require hints like an bumbling amatuer idiot trying to solve an escape room scenario. So on he continued, tracking and backtracking until finally he reached it, bathed in orange light; Control Room A in all its archaic glory, filled with hundreds of dials and switches, Art Deco inlay and intricately patterned tiles.
“Stop thinking,” he felt John smile softly into his shoulder as strong, muscular arms wrapped around his waist from behind, John's naked torso pressed warmly along the lines of his back.
John woke the next morning to sun streaming in the carriage window and Sherlock studying him intently. “Good, you're awake, let's get breakfast.”
And Guerin had no doubt given his operations manager a heads up about their impending visit because as soon as they arrived, they were ushered upstairs into an office with Ms. Elmahdy’s name above the door, provided with tea and asked (
And whether it was the increased pace or the verbalised inducement, a couple of thrusts and pulls later, Sherlock's body stiffened as he cried out. Stomach muscles tensed as he came, ribbons of come covering both their chests and dripping in between John's fingers, as he stroked Sherlock's cock through the resultant tremors.
fuck have you gotten us involved in that has a raving psychopath like Moriarty making house calls on Sherlock at Barts, trying to recruit him? And why the fuck is Sherlock now nowhere to be found? If you don't tell me right now, I swear to God my next stop will be The Times and then we can see how
Every fic that I write is a wonderful journey and such a different journey. In The Real Great Perfumers (the previous work in this series) I was learning to write fic for the very first time. I had such a wonderful mentor in @88thParallel and I am so very grateful that she chose to continue to beta-ing for me on this fic as well. She’s my punctuation corrector, my “I’m not quite sure what you are you trying to say here-or” and my pom-pom waving, excitedly squee-ing, comment-or who holds my heart ever so gently in her hands when she provides her feedback. Without her, I would never have had the confidence to write Perfumers and as such, would never have been able to write this one either. I wrote because she told me I could.
Thankfully, lest he have to endure Anderson's inane questions any longer, his phone chose that moment to deliver a number of text messages.
Pouring himself a drink, his eyes ran over all the surfaces in the room. Knife pinning a letter to the wall, box of nicotine patches on the mantle. Just like the fridge, there wasn't a single space that didn't have evidence of Sherlock’s influence, on the flat and on his life.
His left hand scrabbled for purchase on the rough white bricks, his right hand clenched the twisted hessian rope, climbing, pulling himself upwards. An almost vertical climb up a tightly coiled spiral staircase.
No need to clarify who the subject of Lestrade's envisaged homicide was. John sighed, looking down to regard his bare toes. "What's he done now?"
" … and I know you are not big on this … talking thing. God knows I'm not keen on it either... But I'm going to try and say a few things.”
At first, their play was punctuated by sounds of encouragement and agreement (and in John's case, a fair amount of exasperated muttering as his pieces were quickly and deftly extracted from the board by Sherlock’s elegant fingers and cast aside). But as the hours slipped away and morning became afternoon, the intensity of their battle increased, and Sherlock was forced to stop admiring John's mind and focus on ensuring that he continued to maintain the upper hand in the game.
He slipped in through the second door. Even dimmer than the lighting in the control room, it took a second for his pupils to dilate in the darkness of the lab. At the back of the room, behind the safety-enclosed working spaces, a series of storage units monitored relative humidity, temperature and oxygen levels. On the right side of the unit, numerous agar plates were open and exposed, and on the left the plates were sealed, complete.
John was surprised however, when Sherlock gestured to the first cab and declared, “you take this one. I'll get another.”
“Firstly,” John started, turning towards him but maintaining his distance. “No one thinks you need a babysitter, but we
Groans became deeper and more urgent as John's cheeks hollowed, drawing his lips up to the tip of Sherlock's cock, tasting the pre-come that had started to appear and adding another finger.
He had already been frisked once when he arrived by the officer in charge, and now he was getting a secondary pat down by Donovan. She knew about his gun; probably thought he brought it with him, or that he had thought about bringing it with him. If she did, she would have been right. He had left it at home though, in the side table. She was thorough. Though if she had registered the two metal bands at the bottom of his trouser pocket, she didn’t mention it, just nodded her head to the officer who would be accompanying him that he was all clear.
“Yeah, sorry to bother you again but you don’t, uh, happen to remember what time it was that you saw Sherlock."
"Bloody hell if I know. He left as quickly as he came. Doesn't matter to me all that much right now anyway!”
) change in the way her suit jacket now fell down her back as opposed to the way it had when she had first entered the room. Just as he was carefully reaching out a hand to see if he could ascertain the reason without her notice, she abruptly stopped walking and turned to face him.

Located on the outskirts of the city, the warehouse stood as the lone building in a vacant lot in a sea of vacant lots, surrounded by a lot of very vacant dusty land. They had passed a modern-ish looking shopping centre about five minutes earlier but apart from that, things were very, very … vacant.
To Sherlock’s eternal chagrin, the cabbie had kept up his insipid, off key humming all the way to their destination
He launched himself off the top step and onto a slightly surprised Moran. Moran stumbled backwards, knocking a couple of journalists off their feet as John’s fist tried to find something to connect to. Lestrade and one of his officers were on him quickly and John had only managed to get in one or two glancing blows by the time they pulled him off.
"… I am informed that the sensitivity of this investigation necessitated a closed hearing so that a number of … complex issues could be aired prior to the inquest. Is that correct?” she looked up from the document she had been passed by her assistant and over her glasses at Lestrade.
The crescendo of rain outside had died back down to a slow drizzle allowing him to hear, in the darkness of the room, and behind closed eyelids, their shared even breaths. John swirled his tongue along the inside of Sherlock's top lip causing him to shiver and gooseflesh to appear on the chest that pressed into his.
"Ta," John responded, especially grateful for the DI's friendship in the midst of all, before he broke off the call and ran out the front door onto Baker Street.
