By the time nearly three hours had passed John was really starting to worry.  The Sherlock he knew before could sit and think for hours, yes, but never had he been so still.  He usually moved his hands, his shoulders, or at least his eyes as he scanned the images his brain projected into his physical world.
waited.  Of course he waited.  After sending Sherlock away he could only assume he would return for a second try.  Couldn't say he wasn't looking forward to it.  No use lying to oneself.  Only, when the person knocking on the door proved to be the other Holmes brother, he was left even more confused.
Sherlock decided not to reply.  It was obvious, it would have been obvious to anyone, so surely John must have worked out that of course he was on a date because he'd needed comfort from someone close and familiar right after his “best friend” left him (for a second time), so why would he press Sherlock to tell them something they both new?
"Well he's your best friend, right?  And he knows you're in a relationship, a relatively new one, too.  And you've got your job.  Maybe he just didn't want to inconvenience you by dragging you off to Norway for who knows how long."
On the plane, Sherlock sat by the window.  Normally, he didn't like sitting on the inside, as every person sitting aside of him would be a hinderance should he need to move.  But having a window seat gave him something to stare at without drawing attention to himself.
John had listened for Sherlock to make it down the stairs alright before sitting next to Mary on the couch.  He noticed her stiffen as he sat.  "Is something wrong?"
He set Dennison down in his bedroom, and pulled some night clothes out of the dresser.  'Dry off and get changed, then we can have some dinner.'
When all the boxes and suitcases had been filled and left by the door, Sherlock surveyed the room.  Most everything was gone in a matter of minutes, only larger furniture still sat out.  Sherlock grabbed his coat (a beige windbreaker) from a hook on the back of the door, put it on one arm at a time, and walked out of the apartment.
Mary took it with a bit of confusion, and read his writing aloud.  "I have, but I need to keep my mind occupied."  She scanned it again, frowning some more as if the color of the paper offended her.  "You know, it's okay if you don't like me."
Dennison pulled away smiling, but became more serious when he saw the absent look on Sherlock's face.  “Are you okay?”
Dennison rolled over and dug his hands down into the ground. “Come on, get in the mud, it feels nice.”
Lestrade waited until he was sure everyone had gone before he answered her.  "I need you to interpret some sign language."
Sherlock was laid out on a bed with bleach white linens, and he had stitches going up the side of his neck, near his original scar. He was also groggy, hardly able to keep his eyes open.
John bit his lip, glancing down at Sherlock who would still not meet his gaze.  He stuck his hand out to Dr. Parson.  "John Watson," he introduced as they shook.  "I'm his doctor."
“Although I disagree with my brother’s sudden interest in love, I don’t want to see him hurt because of it. He would never have made the decision on his own without a little… push.”
John gave a nervous laugh, but couldn't refuse. “Well that settles it then. I'll get changed...” He left for his own bedroom as the other two headed toward Sherlock's.
John sat in his chair in 221B.  It was the first night he'd spent away from Mary.    He appreciated everything she did for him, and her patience.  But he felt like he needed a night to himself.
John watched him for a while. He wasn't really tired, but didn't want to leave. Once he was sure Sherlock was asleep, he allowed his own eyes to close.
'Could be a week,' Sherlock wrote on his pad.  'Could be permanent.  It depends on the state of things.'
Dr. Parson's mouth opened as he realised.  "Oh...  You're the... the friend.  The one who wrote up all his cases."
Parson sighed and went back to his novel.  At least he was able to take that hint and leave Sherlock be.
“No,” John interrupted, “he is.  He's depressed, and he doesn't know what's happening to him.  I've seen it before.  My sister...” he paused to clear his throat.  “I know the signs, Mycroft.  I saw it before he left and I know I shouldn't have let him leave but the last thing you want to do for someone who feels that way is take away their power.  I was helpless and he left and now he doesn't want to come back.”
John laughed though his nose as he remembers the experiments Sherlock used to do on him.  And all the times he woke to find him there, just watching, no experiment in sight.  'Why are you so fascinated by people sleeping?'
Once alone, John pulled out his phone, checking for texts from Sherlock or a missed call from Mycroft.  There was nothing.  Sherlock he could understand, texting John meant acknowledging he'd done something stupid.  But he would have expected something from Mycroft, a strong voice telling him to take better care of his brother.
Sherlock grabbed the instrument from him with little resistance.  'You're tired.  You don't have to go to sleep, but you're not going to learn anything more in this state.'
'I don't know. I seem to know, while it's happening, but once it's over I forget. And it's not good, do you understand? I'm not good, and this isn't something people should do.  Dr. Parson had good intentions with what he said but I cannot lie anymore.'
a non-human.  And it took your suicide and then your miraculous return from the dead to show them that."
“John,” Mary said as their date came to an end.  He'd walked her home, intending on getting a cab back to Baker Street.  But she could tell he wasn't too thrilled to go back to the empty flat.  Just that morning Sherlock had left for Norway, and no one knew how long he'd be away.  “Why don't you... spend the night here?”
He stared at the screen, thinking back to his dream. He looked to Dennison, signing, 'Want to take a trip to London?'
He raised a finger to signal for John to wait, which he did, while Sherlock went back into the apartment.  He was only in there for a few seconds before he came out again and closed the door behind him, a small brown envelope in his hands.  He held it against John's chest.
He was just starting to think the basket felt a little heavy when he felt someone bump into him from behind.
John moved his hand so both here holding Sherlock's.  As he laid his head on Sherlock's shoulder, he thought back to a time when he would be afraid of someone walking in, seeing them so close.  But those worries were long gone.
Sherlock waited, thinking out what he wanted to say. He didn't want to disconnect yet, and there was something he wanted to ask. 'My scar.'
He did.  When he saw Sherlock had hardly even looked at the food, he stopped eating and crossed his arms, looking up at Sherlock.
“Yeah.  Is it okay if I stay here tonight?  You can't sleep in my chair and I don't want to be alone.”  He didn't wait for an answer, instead just sliding right under the covers after placing his toys on the floor.
Across the hall was a door he knew had to be Dennison's.  He knocked and heard something plastic be dropped on the floor before the door opened.
'I need to be as far away from him as possible right now,' he signed to the boy. 'We won't go far. If something happens, you can run back and get him.'
"At the time that permission was granted, he was under the impression that he'd lost your friendship for good; I doubt it applies now."
"Alright."  John calmed down a bit.  At least they would still see and talk to each other.  "Is someone going to be with you?  With your head and your ankle, you shouldn't be alone."
Sherlock was a bit surprised, but didn't push him away.  Two plates of food were set in front of them and Dennison started to eat right away, but Sherlock waited, hoping Dennison wouldn't notice.
As John prepared breakfast for the two of them, he couldn't help but feel the worry from last night return.  Sherlock had been fine with John helping him before, and he didn't have a broken ankle then.
Sherlock tore his eyes away from John's, unable to withstand the anger he saw in them.  He knew the anger was not aimed at him, but at Moriarty.  But it still hurt to look into those eyes and see the emotions they held, and the ones they did not.  He sent another text to Lestrade.
'They are the trouble.' Sherlock sent the message, wondering if he should be telling John any of this. The whole point of his being in Norway was to put distance between them, after all. 'They're the reason I'm here. They're dead.'
Sherlock nodded and followed him out into the hallway. He turned toward John and saw pain on his face.  He reached a hand out to grab John’s arm and steady him.
He wanted to begin unpacking.  He hadn't abandoned his plan of shutting out the world for a few days.  But a few more hours of delay wouldn't make that much difference.  'Lead the way.'
When John saw his friend's face materialise on the screen, he felt relief flood through him. All those minutes, days, hours without seeing for himself that Sherlock was alright. The tense muscles and the restless nights. But seeing his face, with a bit of a smile on it at that, finally allowed him to relax.
They weren't particularly interesting but they were something, infinitely better than sitting and doing nothing.  Most of the time.
Sherlock watched.  His clothes were almost soaked through, his hair flat and dripping.  But the rain was uncharacteristically warm, and he didn't want to ruin the kid's fun.
“Morning,” he said as his food was brought to him.  "Sherlock, I'm sorry about yesterday.  You were right and I shouldn't have made something up just because I didn't know what to say."
'I've been sober for years.'  It was true.  Since John, Sherlock had been drug free, save the occasional cigarette.  But he couldn't blame his brother for worrying.
Around midnight he remembered he'd planned on chatting with John again that night.  He thought about going to get his computer, but didn't want to leave and have Dennison wake in his absence, not after he'd told him he could trust him.
"Give me your arm," John requested.  Sherlock just stared at him, obviously trying to figure out the nature of this visit.  "Give."
John's hesitation made Sherlock curious.  He began to wonder if the news was good or bad; judging tone through texts can be difficult.  'Your news?'
John squeezed his eyes shut, pinching the bridge of his nose.  “How long have you known he's been sleeping with him?”
Mycroft stood and wore a face of stone.  "I can see you're frustrated, but there's no need to take it out on me.  Sherlock is mute, and, while it is unfortunate, it is not my fault."
Sherlock's eyes flicked up to meet John's.  He saw his own ghost in them, all the pain John had suffered in his absence.
John could see he wanted it, could see it in the tightening of his lips, the squeeze of his fists.  It wasn't a particularly interesting case, but how long had it been since he'd had anything?  He was itching for it.
Sherlock blinked, refocusing his vision.  'You startled me. I was a bit dizzy, but I'm fine now,' he signed in response.
He waited, wondering if maybe it was all a dream and Sherlock wasn't actually coming home any time soon.
Sherlock wrote out his response but contemplated scratching it out and rewriting it.  John new most of what had happened in his time away, the things he'd done and endured.  But he new very little of what went on in Sherlock's head, and he wasn't sure how much he was ready to share with him.  'I thought I'd never see you again.  I thought I was going to die.  I was sure of it.'
Another few minutes ticked away before he got Sherlock's reply.  'While I was away I was often injured, or tortured.  When Parson was brought in to treat me he was so gentle.  I didn't know I craved a kinder touch until he gave it to me.  He's just a convenience.'
John answered, 'If you want to change the subject we can, but I don't mind talking about this with you.'
He breathed out a shaky breath and looked at his arm.  Through the sleeve of his shirt he could see the edges of the bandage he'd kept wrapped around it.  He tried to imagine the burning sensation the cut had brought, but he could not recall it well enough.  And he tried to put it out of his mind the the feeling haunted him, begging to be relived.
Sherlock's eyes popped open in one quick, fluid movement before darting right, left, up, down as if he was unsure of his surroundings.  Once he figured out he was at home and felt the weight to his left, he finally looked at John, who wore a face full of concern.
“You caught us,” Sherlock said in his whispering voice.  “How are you feeling? About being adopted?”
“Yes, well, no matter what he says about 'visiting', after seeing you smile like that, I don't think he'll be leaving again.”
“Dennison. He said you like me.” He waited for Sherlock to respond, but he did not.  “I, um… told him I like you too.”
John shook his head and reached out for one of Sherlock’s hands.  “I meant it… I mean I didn’t really understand what I said until after I said it. Sherlock, if you… do you… want me?”
"What happened?" John asked, finding it hard to believe there was something that a protective and vengeful Sherlock Holmes couldn't do.
But Anderson didn't shut it.  "I'm just saying that normally he would have insulted half of us by now."
He found the garden, stepping through the glass sliding door and into the cool night air, and spotted a small figure sitting on one of the stone benches.
He knocked.  Nothing happened.  So he put his ear against the door and, hearing shuffling inside, knocked again, louder now.  Then the noise stopped.  He guessed Sherlock was deciding if it was worth opening the door, depending on who was on the other side.
John was awake, in fact.  The chirp of his phone distracted him, and he pulled his lips away from Mary's.
Sherlock knew he didn't want Mycroft to pick him up at the airport. He wanted John. He just didn't know how to tell John he was coming back to London.
John stood, the shock of Mycroft's words causing him to short circuit.  His brain rewound the tape, then played it again, and still it said the same thing.
'I had considered that.  But I think he has developed an emotional attachment to me, so I am also taking advantage of him.'
Then he felt guilt bubble up in his chest because that was not how he wanted to feel toward his friend.  He didn't want to feel like Sherlock didn't deserve to fall in love, because he did, he deserved anything he wanted.  John was just... confused.
Sherlock gave Dennison a long violin lesson after the call with John.  He'd had the staff bring food to them, as he figured neither of them were really up to stopping.
John didn't flinch at the pronoun.  As far as he'd known, sherlock wasn't attracted to anyone, so surely the gender wouldn't have mattered when he did finally love someone.  "Then why is he so... why is he here?  Why isn't Sherlock with him?"
By the time the sun rose, John had actually managed to get some sleep.  He'd dozed off for about an hour on the sofa, the sleep dreamless and constantly interrupted by fits of blurry almost-awakeness.
“Have you been doing your stretches?” John asked, the video feed skipping as he moved himself closer to the screen.
At her words, Sherlock pulled his arm free and put a few inches between him and John.  He got a quick glance from John but it was over in a flash and then he was talking to the women again.
Sherlock cracked a tiny smile.  'So am I.'  Although he would have been glad either way, if it had meant protecting John.  And the squeeze he felt around his hands told him John was aware of that.
“It's good to see you,” he said, not sure how to start the conversation. He'd been the one to insist on the video call, but Sherlock had gone along with it with little hesitation, so he knew they both needed this.
Once they arrived in Norway, a car was waiting for them.  Sherlock was desperate to get the the estate.  He was prepared to spend three days locked in the room provided for him, with no interruptions from anyone for any reason.
He ran his thumb over one of the scars, the shorter of the two.  He'd seen many similar ones throughout his life.  It only made him wonder how many more, similar or not, could be found on this body.  How many bruises, gashes, lashes had he endured?  Was this the only one, or the worst of them all?
Dennison read his books all day, not letting Sherlock out of his sight.  As day turned into night, and he began yawning, Sherlock suggested he get some rest.
'Thanks.'  John sent the text, but wasn't exactly sure he wanted to be congratulated.  'So, what did you want to talk about?'
The text came through and then he screen went dark, as Sherlock must have shut his laptop rather than properly disconnect the call.
He helped Sherlock sit up and kept a hand on his back for extra support.  "And you want to go traveling like that?  Why don't you just give it some time, yeah?  Give yourself some more time to heal."
John came downstairs a few minutes later, offering to make breakfast.  But before he could even light the stove, someone knocked on their door.
They stopped in front of a large wooden door, which she opened for him before disappearing around the corner.
John watched him try to navigate through the sitting room to his chair, noticing he was a bit wobbly.  It was different from his dizziness, when he'd sway and seem to become dead weight.  This was pure uncoordination.  "Have you been drinking?"
Mrs. Hudson told him it really wasn't a big emergency, nothing to ruin a date over, and after fussing over him for a bit she eventually returned to her own flat.
John's eyes moved down to Dennison, who was sitting on Sherlock's lap since it made it easier for the camera to catch both of them. “Has he been doing his stretches?”
"He gets dizzy..." John answered, not looking away from him.  He took his hands away from him but Sherlock swayed again.  John steadied him again and this time Sherlock held onto him, as if along with the dizziness he'd also lost a lot of the strength in his leg.  His fingers dug into John's arm, trying to stabilise himself.
John watched Sherlock work, his movements being the only source of noise as the others simply stared at the detective.  He could see Sherlock's lips moving, mouthing his observations and conclusions.
"Norway?" Mary asked when she found out Sherlock had gone.  She'd come to Baker Street to pay them a visit, only to find John sitting alone on the sofa.  "Why?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, making him giggle.  The brow fell then, allowing for his face to contort into one of confusion.
Sherlock shook his head and shifted his body so he faced Dennison. 'He told you something that wasn't true. And I don't want you to be lied to. I want you to always be able to trust me.'
Thank you everyone who has returned to this story and left me encouraging comments. This is the final chapter, aside from the epilogue which will go up a few minutes after this.
"You could have phoned me, I wouldn't have minded," John said.  Because he really wouldn't have.  Mary may be his first girlfriend since Sherlock's return, but she wouldn't be the last.  Sherlock would interrupt him and she would eventually break up with him.  He'd accepted that.
When it was over, John had a strange compulsion to applaud.  Sherlock's movements, as well as Donovan's occasional mimicry, appeared precise and choreographed.  It told a story of its own.  Behind the tale of the younger sister killing the older and then herself, was the parable of a man who'd lost everything and a woman who felt responsible and so, so ashamed.
John waited for the responses to come. He didn't know when, or even if, Sherlock would ever want to talk about the injury he'd gained as a result of his travels.
“As they say,” Sherlock whispered again, “‘Silence is medication for sorrow.’ But I no longer need the silence.”
“Oh! Should I bake something? I should bake something... Would you mind picking up a few things for me, since you're heading out anyway?”
She gave a small but understanding smile.  Even her own friends wouldn't stand by her like that.  "He's lucky to have you."
Sherlock tried to think of ways to entertain him. Nothing seemed to be quite enough, until he felt his phone go off in his pocket. It was a text from John.
"Are you injured?"  John asked, trying not to sound angry.  Really he was more concerned now rather than angry.  Anger could wait.  They had plenty of time for that, he hoped.
He shook his head, hoping she would understand that it was fine.  He never considered John being embarrassed by him, but he must be.  He pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to his brother.
Sherlock nodded and shooed John out the door.  He knew John was worried about him being alone, and even more worried that he would leave the flat alone, but he was tired of being treated like this.
“I couldn't.  Though he can be extremely childish he is a grown man and can sleep with whomever he likes.  As hard as I try to protect him, I cannot do everything for him.”
Which he did with a small smile.  Just like that, they'd made up.  John was still upset, but mostly at himself.  He thought maybe he just didn't know what to do with this new information, this new knowledge about Sherlock and his apparently expanded emotional capacity.
"Your letter."  John said.  His hands were folded together in his lap.  He stared straight ahead.  "It seemed awfully sentimental."
John managed to smile a bit at that.  At least Sherlock wasn't arguing with him.  'Now you're getting it.  Look, I think we're both tired, so let's both get some sleep, and I'll talk to you tomorrow.'
Mycroft shook his head, as close to an unknowing shrug as the man could get.  "I think he's just trying to make the pain stop.  But I'm not sure it's ever going to, no matter the distance."  Yes, Mycroft had warned him.  But seeing his little brother suffering didn't, for once, make him want to say 'I told you so'.  It just made him want to see the pain go away.
As he left, Sherlock held his thumb up, signaling that he would.  He kept the promise, taking the stairs slowly, not particularly interested in seeing any more doctors for the next few hours.
John, fist still balled and pressing against the wall, gave a quiet sigh when he realised. “He doesn't know,” he muttered to himself. “This is an emotional problem, the one thing Mycroft doesn't know how to deal with.”
"I'll let John know you're spending the night.  And if you try to sneak out I will know, and you won't get very far."
"Are you sure you'll be alright?" John asked Sherlock.  He was running just a few minutes late for his third date with Mary, the woman he'd met while shopping.  He'd left Sherlock alone in the flat plenty of times before, but he'd been doing it more frequently now.
“You should eat.  Normally I wouldn't make you, since you ate breakfast, but if you're dizzy, I think you should.”
“Not very well, yet, but if you two help me I’m sure I’ll get it. Mary has been teaching me but it just doesn’t seem to be taking.”
He took off running toward the park while John and Sherlock followed. They took a seat on a bench not far off from where a handful of the kids gathered around a tree they were trying to climb. Dennison went up to them and easily inserted himself into the group.
"Thanks,"  Lestrade walked in and locked eyes with Sherlock.  The three men were quiet for a long minute.  "I... I heard you were back.  Well, everyone's heard, but there's not much in the papers.  I assume that's thanks to Mycroft.  Anyway, we could use your help."
Sherlock turned his head to the side a bit, and lifted a hand to point at the scars running over his neck.
Hey guys, sorry it's taken so long for an update.  School is done and I'm settled at home for the summer (and all my medical issues seemed to have calmed down for now), so I should be able to update this every few days like I had been before.
John, in some corner of his mind, acknowledged that, among the multitude of things he was feeling right now, he felt a bit jealous.  Sherlock was a man who purged himself of most emotion, especially those that would connect him to another human being.  He was jealous that such a man would fall in love before he did.
, John thought as he typed his next text.  'Your cousin is smart.  He's attached to you because you're there for him in a time of crisis, but I think he's watching over you too.  And I'm glad, since I can't be there.  But I don't know how much longer I can handle you being away.  When are you coming home?'
Since he hadn't taken the sleeping pills that night, it wasn't difficult to stay up while he watched Dennison sleep.
Sherlock's eyes popped open and he sat up.  The movement was too fast and made his head hurt, and he put his hand on his head in hopes that the pressure would relieve some of the pain.
“You're not supposed to smoke inside.  Besides,” he placed a light kiss on Sherlock's knuckles, “It's bad for your health.  As your doctor I cannot recommend you continue this habit.”  He moved closer and placed another kiss on Sherlock's neck, this time not so light.  "Want me to keep your mind off it for a while?"
Dennison looked away, face scrunched up in thought. Sherlock felt terrible. He shouldn't be saying this to him. And why was it so important that he trust Sherlock anyway? Soon Mycroft would find suitable foster parents, and Sherlock would go somewhere else. He didn't know where yet, but he wouldn't be here long.
Sorry it's been abnormally long for this update to come.  The switch from old laptop to new involved all kinds of file conversions (I'd used Pages on my Mac, and now I'm using LibreOffice on Ubuntu) and lots of things got messed up in my outline.
Still nothing.  One of the luggage bags was now full, so Sherlock zipped it and stood it up, wheeling it over to store it next to the door.
"Ah, John, how lovely to see you again," Mycroft said from behind his desk.  "How have you and my brother been getting along?"
John's mouth fell open as he stopped pacing.  He looked down at Sherlock, who was gazing right back at him, a fierceness in his eyes he hadn't seen in years.  They maintained eye contact until Sherlock grabbed the phone back from John's immobile arms.
He thought maybe they could start their own little patch of a garden.  The staff were maintaining the ornate flowers and shrubs but it could be nice for him to have something all his own.
Dennison continued to talk.  “Don't you just love all the colors?  I know it's hard for you to answer laying down, but I guess you never really stopped to look at it.”
Sherlock now, but he could try to help him in this aftermath.  "I know.  Just... there has to be more than that, Mycroft.  I know he's upset about not being able to talk, but there's something else going on.  Every day he gets worse, more reclusive."
A day after Sherlock got his imaging done, thanks to John’s constant insisting, they received a call from Dr. West. She relayed some of her thoughts on the process, and scheduled a surgery for Friday.
They spent a long time in silence, the only noise being a page flip or fingers clicking away at the laptop.
John pinched his lips together.  "Ah..." He'd honestly expected her to end it.  "He's completely stubborn and usually ends up crashing quite a lot of my dates..."  Honesty was probably the best thing at this point.
John was about to speak when his phone rang.  “Sorry, it’s Mary.” He s aid before answering. “Hello? Oh! Sorry, I forgot. I’ll be right there.”
John just hoped he would be able to find him if it happened.  He hoped he was enough (strong enough, clever enough, important enough) to help him.
"Sherlock?" she asked.  "Why does he need-"  She stopped when she looked at him, eyes drawn to the raised skin on his neck that had previously been hidden by distance and his coat collar.  She remembered his silent entrance, remembered he spoke not a word the whole time he was examining the crime scene.  "Oh my god, is he..."  She had to look away from him.  "Okay.  Go ahead.  Not too fast though, I can't talk as fast as you... could.  Sorry, I didn't mean, just... go ahead."
“Sherlock,” she waved with a wide smile. “Welcome back, dear.” She gave him a hug, which he returned. Then she saw John, still carrying the child in his arms. “Oh, you must be Dennison. Hello.”
John took a deep breath.  "Need help sleeping again?"  He didn't think Sherlock would sleep again so soon, but it was the only thing he could think of.  And Sherlock nodded.  "Come here," he said.  Sherlock hardly moved, just looked up at him with questioning eyes.  "Sherlock, come here.  I'm not sleeping on the floor again."
They both stood and rushed toward him.  He tried to back away but they reached him first, each grabbing a wrist and pulling him down.
Sherlock shook his head quickly, pulling himself away from John's touch.  He could walk by himself, so he did.
Sherlock bit his lip.  Explaining his findings was the best part, but there was too much to type on a phone, or even write down.  'Can anyone on your team interpret for me?'
.  He contemplated getting up and putting Sherlock on the bed for a more comfortable sleep, but he didn't want to risk waking him.  Not to mention he was pretty exhausted himself, having spent practically the entire day worried about him.  So he just stayed there with him and waited for sleep to claim him as well.
This, Sherlock could agree with. Mycroft had gotten him the soonest flight, regardless of lack of luxury. Not that he minded too much; at least his brother knew him well enough to know that John was more important to him than flying first-class.
“Just sit there and wait. Sherlock will take care of everything. They’ll be gone before breakfast is ready.”
John tried to supply an answer.  “You should definitely come.  I'd love to meet you, and Mrs. Hudson wouldn't mind, Sherlock.”
A voice came from inside, “Hello?” Molly was standing over a severed leg.  “Oh, Sherlock.  Good to see you back.  Who’s this?”
When he didn't stop, Sherlock did the only thing he could; he pulled him into his lap and let the boy cry into his chest. He didn't know if it would help, but he did remember no one doing it for him when he'd been told of his own father's death. He hadn't cried, much, but only because he'd learned by that time that it was unbecoming.
Sherlock nodded, unable to think of anything else.  He wasn't so surprised this time when Dennison grabbed his hand as they walked outside.
'Of course I am.' Of course he was. He'd only discussed it with his therapist and even then he mostly talked around it. But if there was one person he felt safe enough with bringin up memories he buried down and locked away, it was Sherlock.
Dennison was awake ungodly early in his bedroom upstairs. He sat on his bed waiting to hear the sounds of either John or Sherlock waking.
After a few seconds, his strength was back and his head was clear.  He released John, using his eyes to send an apology for grabbing him too tightly.  John gave a tiny shake of his head, he knew Sherlock didn't mean to hurt him, and it wasn't really that bad.  And although Sherlock had let go of John, John did not let go of Sherlock.  Instead, he locked arms with him in case it happened again.
But Dennison didn't have much trouble catching on to what Sherlock was trying to explain.  What he lacked in musical skill he made up for in communicating, something Sherlock had always had trouble with.
Dr. Parson lifted his gaze from his book and set it on Sherlock's file.  "What are you looking into now?  Murder? Robbery?"
“You wanted Sherlock to adopt you,” John said, “So you’ll have to get used to him treating you like his child.  Come on, we’ll get you settled.”
John thought for a minute.  He seemed to reach a conclusion as he nodded to himself.  "I'll be right back."  He walked away, leaving Sherlock in his spot on the floor, the light flooding in through the door causing his head to hurt after sending so much time in the dark.
This is the end. For anyone interested, I have an original play and an original story in the works. From 2015 to 2017, I was working on my MA in creative writing, but lost funding as I approached my final semester. Leaving school without my degree depressed me greatly, but I have found that continuing my writing regardless of having a degree or not has been a great source of relief and confidence for me. If you'd like to read something original, and different from my fanfiction style but still recognizable as my own, I encourage you to contact me. I'm always happy for feedback. Anyway, onto the end of this mad old fic.
'I'm glad, Sherlock,' was John's response. Sherlock wished he could see his face, watch his lips moving and hear the words in John's voice. But he didn't want to wake his cousin. 'Is there anything you want to talk about tonight? We've mostly talked out your frustrations and things. But if there's anything else bothering you, you can talk to me.'
"Donovan," he started, "thanks.  For... translating."  He continued after she gave a reserved nod.  "We'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about him.  People will find out, eventually, but..."
Sherlock didn't know what to think of that.  He was, as he'd been told constantly, definitely not funny.  But he
That night, neither of them knew what to do.  The last time Sherlock up and left John, John hadn't known it was coming.  But now he did, and he didn't like it.  They were friends.  Not colleagues anymore, really, since Sherlock stopped consulting.  But Sherlock was an important part of his life, and he'd only had him back for a handful of weeks.
"Yes, but I didn't know about it, did I?" John asked loudly.  "You can't just leave me like this again."
Sherlock pulled out his phone and texted Lestrade.  'Murder-suicide.  House robbed after both dead for some time, gun stolen by robber.'
He tried to, focusing on her taste, mildly sweet and a bit earthy.  “I'm sorry, I have to check it,” he said as he pulled away again.  “It might be Sherlock.”
Knowing Sherlock would be returning soon, the flat suddenly felt one hundred times emptier. The silence almost made it impossible to think.
The staff had been taking care of him since his parents' death (of which he was unaware) so he supposed he wouldn't have to do much.
Sherlock passed the book completely into Dennison’s hands as he went to the door, knowing who was behind it.
“Maybe it takes some time?” John said, but the resulting look on Sherlock’s face told him his hope was most likely in vain.
Lestrade's mouth opened in shock.  "He can't..." He looked back toward Sherlock, but he'd already left the flat.
Sherlock stilled, the sudden contact causing him to panic.  His ears buzzed and his vision whitened out for just a second, before he remembered where he was, focusing on the arms keeping him grounded.
He blinked.  Why had he done that?  No, wait, what had he done, exactly?  He raised his forearm so it was level with his eyes and he inspected the cut.
"Yeah, well, I treated him longer," John said.  He turned back to Sherlock.  "If you need a doctor, I'll go with you."
John Watson stared at the door.  He checked the small piece of thin, delicate paper Mycroft had handed him again, even though he knew he was at the right address.  He'd double checked it ten times by now.  He just wasn't sure what to do now that he was here.
“Dr. Watson, we've been reading your blog!” Dennison said, voice high with excitement as he stood next to Sherlock and waved at the screen. “Did you two really do all those things?”
“Oh.  Well, I think you're good.  You used to save people, or find things that were stolen.  That's good.”
'We both knew this day would come.  From the beginning, we knew my time with him would end.  Get me out before he decides to leave.  I don't care where I have to go.'
Behind his closed eyes it was dark and starless, and he floated in silence until he heard a faint voice calling out from a Universe near by.
One laid on a sofa, dark hair covering her face, right arm dangling so her curled fingers almost touched the floor, left arm draped over her chest.  The second body was face-down on the sandy carpet in a typical sprawled-out pose.  Both had gunshot wounds.
"Sherlock," he said again, "are you okay?"  He found himself asking that question a lot.  Every time, Sherlock would nod.  Even if he wasn't, and even if he knew John could see it, he nodded.
'I wouldn't lie to you. I promised, remember? You don't have to read if you don't want to, but I like listening to you.'
Sherlock was still asleep beside him (and partly under him), having rolled onto his stomach sometime during the night.
Dennison didn’t get up until the following morning. John had gone to bed a bit early himself, leaving Sherlock on the sofa.  Sherlock had promised he would get some sleep, but he didn’t even try to keep his word.
What they weren't so good at was keeping him asleep. If his brain really wanted to keep him conscious, it could push through the barrier the drugs had created.
But he just felt heavy.  His body was light and lithe but he just felt gravity latching onto him.  It didn't make sense, gravity wasn't sentient and certainly didn't have arms to pull him down, but he was feeling it.  A thousand cold, skeletal hands rose from below and latched onto him, bringing him to the floor once more, pinning him there, filling him with lead.
John sat up and took in the sight of them all, soaking wet and covered in mud. “How are we going to explain ourselves to Mrs. Hudson.”
Every minute that Sherlock didn't reply, John's worry grew. But he tried to keep himself calm, reminding himself that Sherlock did say something about having to have a conversation, maybe he was too busy to reply.
John could tell something was wrong.  Not sleeping was normal for Sherlock.  Not being able to was not.  He put his book down between the sofa cushion and the arm rest.  "Come here."  He remembered the last time he held Sherlock; the man had gone straight to bed.  So he pulled him over, laying him down so he had Sherlock's head in his lap.  It might have looked strange to anyone else but John would do anything to get him to sleep when he needed it.
The back-and-forth lasted a few more minutes until Sherlock finally gave in and told John what time to meet him.
And for a week John wasn't sure why he'd said that.  Yes, he was angry at Sherlock, but all he'd been hoping, wishing,
At this time of night, Dennison was already asleep. In Sherlock's bed, of course. Neither of them had suggested Dennison return to his own room. Sherlock didn't want Dennison to become too dependent on him, but at this point he wasn't quite sure who was more dependent on whom. Nor was he ready to think about it.
"I raised my brother, John.  And all through our lives, I urged him not to get attached to anyone.  As hard as he fights me, that is one thing we never argued over.  He took the advice and made it his one rule to live by.  But he never bothered to figure out what happened if the rule was broken, if it was beyond his control.  He made this plan partly out of the pain he feels, and partly because that's the rule.  He can't deny he's attached, but he can put as much distance between them and pretend."
They were by Parson's door, and Sherlock took a deep breath, composing his face. He knelt down and tried to look as not-angry as possible. It wasn't Dennison he was furious with, after all.
John arrived at Mycroft's home, still unsure of what he wanted to say or do.  The maid who answered the door led him deep into the building, corridors like caves, dimly lit, the only difference being the carpets and framed portraits rather than dirt and ancient paintings on the walls.
"Something's wrong with him," John wastes no time with niceties.  "He won't... he's different.  I mean even more different, now.  He seems... defeated."
It didn't take him long to find the carton of cigarettes.  He pulled out a box and a packet of matches and again took his seat at the edge of his bed.
Sherlock would have laughed.  Instead all he could do was expel a soft puff of breath at the words on the screen.  John's concern, no matter what happened or didn't happen between them, never failed to amuse him, to make him feel completely weightless, if a bit confused by the sentiment.  Although that confusion was becoming increasingly rarer the more time he spent with John.
He saw his blanket. It formed a small mountain-like shape, with four fingers and a head of blond curls sticking out the side of it.
'You're upset with me.  Usually, when that happens, you leave.  You won't now because you'll feel guilty for abandoning me but I don't need your pity.  You want space, so I'm giving it to you.'
Sherlock had always preferred being alone.  People were tedious and annoying and the only way he could get anything done was to be isolated from them.
“I’m right here, and you’re safe at home on Baker Street, Sherlock.  Dennison is fetching you some water.  We’re in your bed and it’s raining outside.”
Then the latch clicked, and the door swung open only an inch, and the shuffling resumed.  John's brow furrowed.  He knocked a third time before pushing the door open all the way.  "Sherlock?"
Sherlock sat at the table in the kitchen. He kept his head down while he regulated his breathing, focusing entirely on the breath ebbing through his lungs. The room disappeared around him, followed by the flat. Within minutes all of London was long gone and then the rest of the world, leaving Sherlock at the center of the Universe.
But he wore a chastising frown at Dennison's still-dripping hair.  He pulled his discarded towel off his bed and stooped down to dry the curly, golden locks.  Dennison's giggles were muffled by the fabric.
Sherlock didn't even pause.  He simply swished across the room, opening a filing cabinet and pulling out a bunch of dully colored folders.  He looked through each one, sorting them into three piles on the floor.  The tallest of the three were thrown into a metal waste bin and then Sherlock pulled something out of his pocket.  A packet of matches, one of which he lit and threw into the bin, lighting the files aflame before he placed one of the remaining piles in a suitcase and the other in a small messenger bag sat on a wooden chair.
"But it is," Mycroft argued.  "You came to me for help.  Do you understand that?  You came to me because you didn't want to burden John.  But it's doing more harm than good."
Sherlock began moving his hands at an easy speed.  Of course he felt compelled to speed up, out of frustration with his thoughts moving faster than his body and out of the intense feeling of wanting to leave.  He didn't like this, wasn't enjoying it.  It was as pointless as everything else now.
Soon his breathing slowed and his eyes opened.  The hot sweat on his face cooled to almost freezing and he began to shiver.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.  'Am I?'  He wasn't a very teacherly person.  Either he'd get bored or the student would get bored or they'd both get bored and it wasn't really a good experience for anyone.
Clutching a small sandwich in his hands, Dennison walked between Sherlock and John, staring wide-eyed at everything he passed.
The last thing Sherlock wanted right now was a conversation with Mycroft.  But he knew it needed to come soon.  He'd put up with his brother's gloating if it meant getting away from John.
They sat in silence for a long while.  John didn't know what to say.  What did you say to a man who could say nothing back?  Sure, there had been times when Sherlock wouldn't speak for hours, days, weeks, even.  But this was more permanent.
“Do you want me to tell him?” Dennison asked. When Sherlock approved he said, “He says you’re fantastic, John.”
"Do you really think that?  That I would be better off without you?  Because that is absolutely ridiculous, and I'll never believe it."
John stood in front of Sherlock, and waved a hand to see if the motion would rouse him.  When that didn't work, he wondered if the man was sleeping.  It was a rare thing, even rarer for him to see it, but he did know what Sherlock looked like when he slept and it wasn't this.  He almost laughed when he thought up images of a disheveled Sherlock twisted up in sheets, limbs thrown about in all kinds of positions.  Sleep was when he was least composed, and that was probably part of his disdain for it.
Sherlock focused his strength on gripping one of John’s arms to pull himself so he was sitting upright.  He stared at him, eyes still wide with fear.
Sherlock opened his mouth but stopped himself before he actually tried to make any noise.  Why could he not remember hands not lips?  He shook his head.
"Your brother said you weren't taking cases, but... we've got a double murder, no suspect, no weapon in sight."
“Come here,” John took one of Sherlock’s hands and led him back to the sofa. They sat next to each other and John refused to let go of him.  “Sherlock, I… well. I don’t know if I’m ready for a new relationship yet. But… I know that I belong here. With you. That much I realized when you… died.”
So here he was, outside the flat Sherlock had been put up in since his return.  What was he doing here?  He'd expected Sherlock to attempt rekindling their friendship (in a very Sherlocky way, of course).  He'd been prepared for that.
John watched the way Sherlock's body seemed to tighten and become smaller with each passing minute. “Maybe you should go get some sleep. There will be plenty of time after you wake up to do whatever you want.”
A part of him knew they weren't really there.  They weren't real.  But the feeling was real.  With each passing second he felt heavier and heavier, and he began to wonder when the floor would collapse below him.
"I still have most of your things," John announced as they stood.  "I couldn't look at them, but... I couldn't get rid of them either.  It's all it storage."
"He... seems to like you," she pointed out, remembering the scene she'd seen when she first walked in.
John put one of his own hands on Sherlock's head and ruffled his hair, chuckling at the confused glare it got him.
Did I ever mention Dennison is blond?  Because Dennison is blond.  I should go back earlier in the story and work that in somehow...
And the look of scorn was back. Sherlock probably would have growled, if he could. 'Yes. Parson gave me pills to help me sleep.'
"No, it isn't.  I didn't want to upset you.  I just... I always worried about you, you know?  Anytime we had a case, if I couldn't be with you... I knew you could take care of yourself but I just worried so much."
“And how many people are there on this planet that don't bother you?  Sherlock, I am not going to let you separate yourself from him.  I don't know why you're running away from me, but I won't let you run from him too.  I am so glad that he exists because with the way you were... I don't know if you'd still be here without him to give you a reason to be.”
Sherlock watched John go up to his bedroom.  And the weight was back.  This time he could almost see the spindly fingers closing around him.  They were slower than before, but so much heavier.
They sat in silence for a moment. John took the time to look Sherlock over. The picture was jumpy and a bit grainy but he could see Sherlock looked more rested.
I should probably mention that I'm on some powerful pain meds right now (kidney stone, not pretty), meaning updates might be a little slow for the next week or two, but I'm gonna try to keep up.
That wasn't entirely true.  In his time away he'd been forced to sleep outside at all hours of the day.  Sometimes out in the open was the safest place to hide, especially when everyone who had a clue that he was alive expected him to infiltrate tunnels, obscure hotels, and abandoned buildings.  Though it was true he never did it specifically to look at the sky.
This chapter might seem a bit bleh since I'm just getting into writing this story again but it should get better.
"Okay, well I'll be prepared for it now," she said.  "Friends are important, I won't make you choose between us."
The artificial sound of a phone ringing on his computer managed to startle Sherlock, since the room had been practically silent all morning.
John had decided to spend the night at Mary's again that night. He made sure to bring his laptop with him, so he'd have it when Sherlock was ready to talk.
When they got down to breakfast, he set Dennison down and took a seat at the table, only to have him climb into his lap anyway.
Dennison smiled. “It's ok, I know not to walk off.” He let go of Sherlock's hand and stood, looking up at him and John.
Mycroft set down his expensive pen and looked up from his papers.  "What would you have me do about it?"
Even though he knew the conversation was over, John waited a few minutes to see if any more texts came.  He didn't know what kind of text he was expecting.  A deep, emotional outpouring?  A cry for help?  Even with Sherlock acting strange, he didn't think either of those were realistic.
John looked to Sherlock for confirmation. Sherlock just blinked the question away, and John smiled. “Good for you. You'll have to tell me your secret, I need some new tricks.”
Mycroft was silent for a few seconds before leaning against his desk.  "A lot happened to him.  He broke a lot of bones, took a few too many hits to his skull, and watched many people die by his own hand.  He was captured and tortured, and part of this torture resulted in permanent loss of his vocal chords.  He spent most of his time alone, planning, stalking, and killing.  But, somehow, in the midst of all that, he did something no one would assume he had the ability to do."
Sherlock looked up.  He did sometimes like to look at them.  He thought they were useless and refused to learn about them, but that didn't mean he didn't like the way they looked.  The way they twinkled and went on doing their thing without worrying about what anyone thought of them.
John was the first to move, hugging Sherlock around his shoulders. He felt arms closing tight around his waist, curly hair tickling his neck.
'She apologised.  Seems like everyone is apologising to me since I've gotten back.  I don't understand.'
Sherlock thought he should probably insist on having him go to his own room.  But he didn't want to.
She smiled again and looked to Sherlock, expecting him to give her the same assurances the other man had.  But he said nothing, only looked around, as if he were waiting for this exchange to end.  She saw their arms linked and bit her lip.  "That's cute," she told them, "couples doing their shopping together."
John looked up from the phone and saw the defeat in Sherlock's eyes.  "Okay, whatever you want to do, Sherlock."
John felt something tug in his chest.  Sherlock could remember so many things no other human could possibly hold in their mind, and yet sometimes he still forgot he couldn't talk.
Dennison looked up from his book and then slammed it shut. He ran into the kitchen to alert John, whispering, “The man who wants to put me with a new family is here.”
He felt a bit pathetic, staying at her place. He'd never invited her to stay at Baker Street, but she'd said she understood. She knew he needed time to adjust.
Lestrade had managed to listen to the entire explanation even though he too was entranced by the dance of hands.  "Well, thanks," he said, feeling embarrassed at not knowing what else to say.
She looked between the two and then at John, who looked just as confused and expectant as Lestrade.  "I don't-"
John chuckled at his own joke, and watched as Sherlock cracked a small smile, heard the soft puff of breath that left the man's mouth.  It took him a few seconds to realise that was Sherlock's laugh.  That his laughter would forever be silent, save a heavy exhale.
"I've found you somewhere to go," Mycroft told him when the silence became too much.  Unlike John, he still wasn't used to Sherlock being unable to speak.  It unsettled him.  "There's a situation with our cousins in Norway.  It's not a case, necessarily, just... you'll be looking after the estate."
John shook his head.  "You wouldn't hurt me.  You wouldn't hurt anyone.  Not without reason, and I know your brain is like a super computer, absorbing and processing data, and you may have developed an instinct to kill but you are not dangerous.  You know the difference between threat and non-threat, between enemy and friend.  You haven't even been startled by me."
He ignored the spark of anger when he felt worry building up inside him.  Sherlock had been on a dangerous mission...
I didn't mean for this chapter to be so short (trust me, I have every last detail planned out) but the end just seemed like it needed to have a pause bigger than a section break so yeah.  Chapter 8 is almost done though, so that will be posted either later tonight or sometime tomorrow.
“Will you come with me?” Dennison asked.  “I can tell you're not hungry, but I like having someone with me when I eat.  My parents are away and the staff are too busy...”
John put his arm across Sherlock's chest.  "Sherlock, something's wrong.  You've never... you've never really hesitated to talk to me about things, and so I've been worried about you.  It's okay if you need to keep some things to yourself, but... I am your friend.  I feel like I have to keep reminding you of that.  Whatever is going on, you're going to be okay."  John felt a certain amount of bitterness growing inside him.  Whatever Sherlock was thinking about, it had to do with the man who'd so obviously broken his heart.
Sherlock was caught between the urge to panic and the urge to laugh.  Even if he did take him to London, it wouldn't be at that very moment.
“Just give me some time. But I do have something else I wanted to mention. I was just… waiting for the right time.” He waited for Sherlock to say something, but he just waited for John to continue.  “I’ve been looking into surgeons. And I’ve found one that might be able to help you. You wouldn’t get your voice completely back, but she might be able to restore it so that you can talk.”
But sleep did not come.  He was so tired.  So ready to let go.  Gravity's hands were still on him.  Why didn't they pull harder?  Surely they could simply carry him down into the earth.  Maybe there he'd be able to get some sleep.
Any other time, he would put a hand on Sherlock's back and offer to make tea or to talk to him about things that didn't really matter but seemed to distract him.
A second later, the boy appeared, giving two little knocks on the door. “Sherlock, I'm coming in,” he announced before opening the door enough to get through. That was the general rule about his bedroom; if the door was open, you were allowed to come in. “Are you talking to Dr. Watson?”
“No, dear, I'm fine, thank you.” She noticed his impatience and invited him to sit down. “What's gotten into you?”
“Correct, as usual. My niece,” she said for John’s benefit, “comes to see me a lot. My sister is a single mum, you know, so she likes a break now and then. You got one out there, or…?”
"No, you haven't done anything, I just..." John tried to find the words.  He wasn't angry.  He was... hurt.  And he felt guilty for going to Mycroft.  As much as they acted like they hated each other, he knew that wasn't true.  "Yesterday, you... scared me a little, with the whole... sitting there and not moving thing.  So I went to Mycroft to find out if there was something going on.  Something I could help with..."
'It doesn't matter what you think. I am his temporary guardian, not you. You are my employee. Do as you're told.'
With what energy he had left he stood and walked to the mountain of boxes at the other side of the room.  He dug through a few, looking for one item in particular.  Something he'd asked his brother to send him.  He'd refused, of course, but the tone he'd used gave him away in an instant.
Sherlock wasn't exactly in a mood to play, unless squeaking and screeching would count as playing.  But he didn't have much else to do, and the stars were reminding him of things he'd been trying to forget all night.  'Go up to your bedroom, I'll be there in a few minutes.'
Tonight was a night they'd decided to skip the stretching. Dennison had gotten tired out playing in the rain. And it had taken all of Sherlock's willpower to get the boy washed and dressed for bed rather than just letting him go to sleep covered in mud. It wasn't because his pout had any affect on Sherlock, it was simply because he didn't have the patience to deal with a persistent six-year-old.
But upon opening them again he felt the heaviness from before returning.  First in his arms, the added force pulling at his shoulders so that he felt the joints might split.  He felt it in his feet as they seemed to lock in place on the floor, morphing into immobile constructs of marble.  His head felt so full and dense that he feared his neck just might snap under the pressure.  Well, he didn't fear it so much as wonder what it would feel like, what it sound like.  Would it actually snap?  Or would his spine creak until it popped apart, leaving his head to hang limp.  Maybe then it would be dark enough.
Sherlock moved his eyes from the files to her face and gave a small nod (and attempted a smile) to greet her.
John shifted onto his side.  Sherlock felt so cold.  He got as close as he could without making Sherlock claustrophobic, and laid his head against Sherlock's shoulder.  "You really are cold.  How long have you been down here?"
Once John was out the door and far away from Baker Street, Sherlock donned his coat and left the flat.
Before you jump right into this chapter, I wanted to let you all know that I have a couple of original projects in the works as I prepare to apply to graduate school. If any of you would be interested in reviewing these projects as they progress, please email me (my email address can be found on my profile page). I can't make it to any physical workshop meetups in my condition, but I would love to have feedback from the community who has supported me through my ups and downs. The program to which I am applying is low-residency, allowing me to do 95% of my coursework from home. I need my portfolio to be outstanding if I want to get in. I'd be happy to return the favor to fellow aspiring writers!
Dennison had wanted to spend the night at the hospital with Sherlock, but John had taken him home after Sherlock was dosed with another sedative.
Once the wound was out of his sight, he sat on the toilet and hung his head in his hands.  What was happening to him?  His cut stung, and he could feel his pulse throbbing in his arm.  But the weight was gone, at least.
So what was stopping him from ceasing payments to Parson? It wouldn't be because Sherlock requested it; Mycroft rarely sincerely cared what Sherlock wanted or didn't want him to do.
“You don't need to protect him, you just need to be there.  He needs to feel that he can ask for help.  So when you talk to him, make sure he feels like you want to help him and not run his life for him, alright?   We have to work together on this if we want him home safe.  Hell, I'll settle for safe, as long as I can be sure of it.”
"There you are.  I knew you'd be late but I didn't think you'd cut it this close."  It was Dr. Parson.  "Good morning, Dr. Watson."
John rolled his eyes, relaxing into the almost normal exchange. “What have you been up to? Lots of exciting crimes in Norway?”
As John climbed onto the bed on the other side of Dennison, he whispered, “I know I said this already, but it's good to see you again.”
John nodded to himself. He hadn't brought it up because he didn't want to upset Sherlock when he'd been doing so well. 'Yes. And you did promise to bring Dennison to London.'
John would silently stitch up the gaping hole in his throat with a long, white hot needle and every time he finished, the threads came loose, forcing John to sew him up again and again.
Dennison shrugged and sat up. Sherlock sat up as well, scratching his head as Dennison crawled into his lap. “I'm bored, Sherlock.”
John watched the man work.  Watched how he moved.  He recognised the flourish that accentuated every move, but it was different somehow.  More calculated.  More careful.  He kept his limbs close, rarely bending or stooping unless it was necessary.
"I won't.  I won't say anything about it," she promised.  "Sherlock?"  Once she had his attention, she signed a few words to him.
Another shrug.  It was one thing for Sherlock to go long stretches without sleep, but food was different.  At the most he'd go three to four days before finally acknowledging that he needed to eat something.
All of time seemed to pass by, and yet he felt outside of time completely.  What was he doing?  Was he on the floor or the ceiling?  Where was John?
But the door slowly swung open.  But he didn't see Sherlock.  Then he happened to glance down, and saw his flatmate sprawled out on the floor, looking up at him with a confused stare.
Sherlock pulled out the pad and pen he now kept in his pocket at all times.  He hated those things more than anything.  He just wanted to talk, he was tired of writing or texting just to have a conversation with his flatmate.  There was a time when he wished he'd never have to speak again, and now he wondered if someone somewhere had misheard.
With that cue, Sherlock managed to stand without releasing Dennison from his hold. He carried him back into the house and up to his bedroom. He put him down on the little bed and asked if he needed anything.
John shrugged in a large movement.  "I really have no idea.  First he said his brother was sending him on family business, then he told me he was going to clear his head.  But he never really told me what he'd be doing over there.  And he took that Dr. Parson with him.  I don't understand why he didn't ask me.  I'm a doctor."
The morning brought another video chat with John. Sherlock hadn't gone back to sleep that night, instead moving to his desk and allowing Dennison to spread out and take up the entire bed. He hadn't expected such a small person to be able to take up so much room.
He replied as best he could with one arm partially restrained.  Her hands moved a bit more and his only response was a low nod.  He tugged lightly on the arm wrapped through his.  He and John walked out, arms linked, and caught a cab home.
Also, some of you asked for longer chapters.  They're coming.  This story is going to consist of chapters that vary in length.  Consider this your warning.
'Of course.'  Sherlock really doesn't know why a kid would want to spend this much time with him, but he thought it was at least good that he wasn't refusing to see anyone.  This way he could keep an eye on him.
After coming back from his reverie, John was immediately at Sherlock's side.  He called the man's name.  "Are you alright?"
He breathed a silent sigh and laid back, letting his eyes take in all the blues and oranges above them.
Somehow Sherlock knew what he was asking and bent down to pick him up, carrying him like he had last evening.  It might not have been the safest idea, since he never knew when the dizziness would hit, but he told himself that it could be fine as long as he was very careful.
It was John who stood to open the door.  "Lestrade," he said when he saw who it was.  "Er, come in..."
She was probably right, even though it sounded a bit ridiculous to him.  But he would have gone if Sherlock had said he needed him.  He would have put everything on hold before Sherlock even said
Sherlock held up the paper that said 'I will be fine', as he'd answered that question a few times throughout the week and was tired of writing the same thing over and over again.
'I didn't break a mirror,' Sherlock signed, but wondered where he would go from there. He was upset that Parson lied to Dennison, especially since they hadn't discussed it at all, but he did know why he did it. It was logical, even if he did think it was wrong. What child needs to know such gruesome things? But, Sherlock was learning, lies could be just as bad. 'It wasn't an accident.'
"I know what it is," John said, nodding to himself.  "Yeah, you're worried that I might turn you away one day.  That I'll just move on, and leave you behind.  You're afraid.  So you're pulling us apart before you can get hurt.  Because you've gone against your own rules and made a friend.  I won't let you do that."
After Dennison had had all his fun and Molly stated she really needed to get back to work, the three of them headed home.
'I feel anger and regret. Aimed at myself. But it doesn't make sense. I didn't do that to myself. I can look down and see the scars on my arm and not feel anything like that. But the one on my neck was given to me by someone else and yet I feel responsible.'
Sherlock shook his head as he typed with his free hand.  'I just needed to get outside for a little.'
He did get a reply, finally, a few minutes later. 'We'll talk about it later. Tonight, if you're free for another chat.'
Tonight John was determined to show her a nicer time.  He was taking her to dinner, not at a particularly fancy restaurant, but tasteful enough to make an impression.  The place was quiet but didn't forbid conversation.
I hope anyone who's been reading this story will read this note.  I've upped the rating from teen to mature and added a warning for graphic violence because of some things that are going to happen (or be referenced, at least) in later chapters.
Already planning on it, Sherlock sat in the reading chair next to the bed. He watched him cry some more before he finally fell asleep.
Sherlock nodded.  Most people took him to be the sort of person who disliked children.  But he had nothing against them.  They were often more honest than adults, and more inclined to use their brains.  Still, he wasn't exactly sure what to do with him.
When staring out the window stopped being an acceptable distraction, Sherlock reached into his small bag and pulled out some of the files Lestrade had given him.  He'd stopped consulting, yes, but Lestrade knew he'd need something.  Something to keep him from other things.  So he'd accepted the box of unsolved crime files, packing a few in his carry on and the rest in things being sent over.
"Can I ask you something?" He giggled a bit as Sherlock's nod tickled his ear.  "What did Sally say to you as we were leaving today?"
"Ah.  Right.  Those look like they went fairly deep.  Like they should have been... fatal, given the location."
Sherlock knelt down to get eye level with him, glanced at John for support, and continued signing.  ‘Yes, I do. But I want to do what’s best for you.’
Sherlock breathed hard, ready to stand his ground.  Ready to remind John that he didn't care about pleases and thank-yous.  But the desperation on John's face, the face of the person he was willing to die for, reminded him that he did care.  At least when the pleases and thank-yous fell from those lips.  'A few weeks.'
Sherlock found most of his things had arrived and was pleased to see none of it was unpacked.  At least he'd be able to organize it so it became the strict chaos he preferred to live in.  He was also pleased that Dr. Parson had left him alone, getting settled into his own room farther down the hall.  He assumed Mycroft had asked the staff to room them as far away from each other as possible, a request with which he was perfectly fine.
John spent the day looking after his friend.  He seemed so far away, letting John feed him and check him for bruises.  He found some big purple ones on his arms, nothing out of the ordinary.  The ones on his hips, though, seemed a bit out of place since there weren't any on his chest or back.  But Sherlock was amazing at getting either no injury at all or the strangest anyone could manage, so John wasn't worried.
John sighed, leaning back in his chair, wondering what Sherlock's face must look like as he admitted these things to him. Sherlock had said his reason for text chatting was Dennison being sound asleep beside him, but they'd video chatted quietly plenty of times, so now he was wondering if there was another reason. 'You can still be a detective. Not just cold cases, but out in the field, chasing criminals. We can figure out a way. Or you may find something new you want to pursue. Either way, you're my friend and I'll be with you to help you figure it out. You helped me find a war to fight in. I'll find you a case to solve.'
He pressed his lips together and shook his head, finally disconnecting his fist from the innocent wall. For all his life, Sherlock's defense against emotional pain was to completely deny he had any emotions to begin with. He'd gone through something after which denial was no longer an option; he suffered an injury that rendered him voiceless and fallen in love with someone who didn't love him in return. And now he was alone.
Dr. Parson frowned. "There's no need for the drama, Sherlock. But fine, you're right, you're his guardian and I'll direct all his questions to you. But, if you do scar him for life, I won't be the one to deal with it.”
John’s hands would be covered in dark blood, followed soon by his clothes and then pools would form on the floor. Hot, red liquid starting to flood the room.
The boys arrived at the crime scene just seconds after Lestrade.  The entire building was quiet as soon as Sherlock entered, mocking him.  The winds died so the old walls didn't sway and squeak.  Everyone stilled, so there were no heavy, creaky footsteps one would expect in a house full of police.  All voices silenced, without so much as a whisper passing between any two people.
Sherlock might find a dead end and not be able to backtrack out of it.  He could find a room in his palace that he never knew existed before, and have the door close on him.  A memory might jump out and distract him, pulling him so far off his path that he wouldn't realise he was lost until it was too late.
It didn't take them long to find Sherlock's gate.  John handed him his bag and bit his lip.  He wanted to ask again, was this really necessary?  But he kept the question to himself.
.  Any attempt to get this from anyone else was in vain and he knew it, but he couldn't have this forever.
“I was talking to Sherlock.”  Sherlock glared at him, and John laughed. “Get your coats. We’ll get a snack while we’re out.”
Sherlock stared at him.  His first instinct was to correct him, to tell him that those weren't all that made a person good or bad.  But he didn't want to explain any of the bad things he'd done, not unless he absolutely had to.  So he just went back to work.
Sherlock nodded, face softening into one of his rare, genuine smiles.  A sort of straight smile that could pass for a frown but they both knew what it was.
'I'm sorry,' Sherlock started. And he was. He was so sorry that this had to happen to him. 'They're not coming back this time.'
'He doesn't know. Honestly I'm not sure what Mycroft expects me to do here; his people are looking into their murders and there are lawyers handling everything else.'
And thanks to everyone who's commented or given kudos.  I didn't expect this story to be received so well and I'm glad you're enjoying it.
He walked to Sherlock's room to check on him.  Sometimes, even though Sherlock has been back for a few weeks, he's still afraid to open the door.  Afraid to find it empty and cold, like it had been for so long.
“But I think the sky is really nice.  Especially when there are clouds, because clouds are fun to watch.  You can see shapes and things.  It's great when it's windy, too because then it looks like the clouds are racing...”
Finally the fatigue, and the anger, if he was being honest, started getting to him as the night went on, and he went up to bed, slamming his door behind him even though no one was around to hear it.
Sherlock, who'd heard her voice as she came up the steps with Mrs. Hudson, was sitting on the sofa with a few files open on his lap.
to punch him.  Not hard enough to knock him down.  And he definitely didn't expect him to stay down.  When Sherlock had stood, he didn't look at John.  Instead he'd kept his eyes fixed on the wall behind him.  He'd opened his mouth to say something, but stopped himself just before John shouted at him to leave.  So he'd left.
"I'm going to get you a glass of water, and you're going to drink it.  And then I'm going to get you some toast, and you're going to eat it.  And you're not going to argue with me at all because if you do, I'll drag you to the hospital because I am not going to let you starve yourself to death.  I won't watch you die again."
"I don't know if we can trust her," John whispered.  "She might not interpret correctly, she might tell people..."
“It’s Mary. She wasn’t… she didn’t even do a home test! There never was a baby, Sherlock.” John hung his head as he said the words quietly.  He was only slightly surprised when Sherlock took him into a hug.  He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and said, “Thanks. Is it terrible that I’m mostly relieved? We… we ended our relationship.”
They stayed locked in a staring competition, pouty faces slipping into intense, unblinking glares, until Dennison finally gave up and started to giggle.
Why wouldn't it stop?  This heaviness that constantly filled him?  It left him weary but unable to sleep.  The only thing that could drive it away was John, but being near him only made him wish harder to get away.
"And what about you?" John found himself asking, though he didn't know why.  He didn't know much of anything at the moment, to be honest.  "What do you think of it?"
Once his eyes adjusted a bit to the darkness, he sat next to Sherlock, offering him a pillow.  Sherlock accepted it with caution, placing it behind his head.  The other pillow was put next to his and the blanket thrown over him as John laid down beside him.
"Right," John remembered.  "Shouldn't you have crutches or something?"  When Sherlock waved his hand like it wasn't a big deal, John sighed.  "Doesn't it hurt?"
After making himself a cup of tea and sitting on the sofa to unwind a bit, he opened his laptop.  He wasn't really sure what he'd planned on doing on it, but as soon as the screen woke up, the chat window from the last time he'd used it was displayed.  And Sherlock was online.  So he sent him a call.
Sherlock didn't even bother to look up.  Communicating was tedious.  Even signing, with the easy flow of hands, required more effort than Sherlock was willing to give for this man.  It wasn't like talking to John; with just one look they could hold an entire conversation, even before he'd lost his ability to speak.
"When's the last time you ate?" John asked.  It was obvious Sherlock wasn't going to tell him anything about his injury or where he was after it was taken care of.  So now he just wanted to make sure the rest of him was taken care of.  "Or slept?"
John glanced down at the envelope and grabbed it.  When he looked up again Sherlock was walking away.  He had no choice but to accept the fact that Sherlock wasn't in the mood for making up with him today.
At long last, a real chapter.  Please consider taking a moment to skim through the rest of the story.  In the past 24 hours I have made a lot of edits.  Most of them are small, but I have slightly changed my characterization of Dr. Parson and his interactions with Sherlock. And do consider reading "Loud Hands" by Katzedecimal, whom by now I consider a friend.  It is a short companion piece to this story and really will add to the experience of this chapter, absolutely worth your time. I would include a link but have forgotten how. Again, thank you for your support in my time away.  Happy reading.
"No, you didn't.  And I sat here talking to him, wondering why he wouldn't talk to me.  I know sign language, John, I could have..."
"Go ahead."  Parson's arms swept open, inviting him to do as he pleased.  "Maybe you can get him to do his stretches."
Again he ignored it.  He switched the phone off and placed it on the table by his bed before any more messages could be received.
Sherlock stepped close, looming above him. 'Don't you ever dare to lie to him again. He is my responsibility, and I will not allow anyone to tell him lies.'
John put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder.  "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell...  I'm sorry."  But Sherlock wouldn't look at him.  He noticed Sherlock's hands balling into tight fists, so he covered one of the fists with his free hand, trying to calm him.  "Sherlock, please," he said in a soft voice, "I'm sorry I yelled at you."
He pushed the door open and looked around the apartment.  It definitely didn't look like he'd only lived there a week.  Sherlock, dressed unusually in a plain white tee and a pair of blue jeans, appeared busy rearranging things.  Packing some into boxes, others into luggage.  "Sherlock," he said again.  But the man didn't stop, didn't turn to look at him.  "It's been a week, why haven't you come back?"
He put his head in his hands, taking deep breaths.  Was this another trick?  Was Sherlock testing him?  Testing his loyalty?
for was that he would come back.  What bothered him more was that Sherlock had obeyed the command without protest, taking it a few steps further by not coming back.
John and Dennison sat up at the sudden shift of weight in the bed. Sherlock was hunched forward toward the foot of the bed, chest heaving, eyes pinched shut.
All eyes were on Sherlock.  Where else would they be?  He'd died a fake detective.  Did being alive make him more fake, or less?  Of course all eyes were on him.  Except his own, which were currently scanning the two dead bodies.
He saw the recognition in her eyes.  Of course she knew, everyone knew.  "John Watson," she said, getting it.  "I didn't realise... it sounds like a common name..."
Sherlock put the instrument down, standing it against the chair, bow at its side.  Then he typed something quickly on his phone and tossed it to John.  'You smell of Mycroft.'
Once he held Sherlock's wrist in his hand, John started stretching him.  He didn't know all of Sherlock's injuries, but he was able to figure out where he hurt, where he felt stiff, from the way he'd moved while packing up his flat.  He lifted the arm up over Sherlock's head, twisting it a bit in both directions, and bending it at the elbow a few times.  He went through the movements, counting them in his head, like opening night of a ballet.  He put on a repeat performance with the other arm.
He knocked.  "Sherlock, I know you're here.  I will find a way into your room if you don't come out."
John returned home, remaining as calm as he could along the way so as not to draw attention to himself on the streets. Once he was safely inside 221B, however, he quickly landed a punch on the wall around the door. It wasn't the flat's fault he was upset, but getting Mycroft on the chin wasn't going to help him.
'Yeah, and it was awful.  But you came back.  The way you're talking, it sounds like you won't this time and there is only one thing you don't come back from and I swear to god if you do that to me again I will break.'
So Sherlock grabbed the files and his laptop and sat next to him.   He pretended not to notice when Dennison scooted closer before opening his book.
Sherlock felt the fingers in his hair stop moving and opened his eyes.  He really did ruin everything didn't he?  He quickly jumped up from the sofa, intending on getting to his bedroom as soon as possible so as to be out of their way, but he moved a bit too fast and lost his balance, and the sudden pain in his ankle only caused him to stumble more.
Sherlock went into his own room while Dennison went into his to get his books.  He opened some of the files on his desk, ready to sit in his chair and get to work.  But when Dennison came in, he sat on the floor at the foot of Sherlock's bed, using it as a backrest.
PLEASE READ: I'm posting multiple chapters at once!  Please be sure to read the one before this if you haven't yet!
But John didn't want that to be the last time they saw each other.  He didn't want new friends.  He'd already have some by now if he did.  He just wanted Sherlock back.  He wanted to rebuild that trust, that connection they'd had.  No matter how long it took.
'I worried about you as well.  Even more so after I left.  Every day, you were all I thought about.'
Sherlock felt a jolt of panic, fearing that whatever held him down would trap John as well.  But soon he began to warm up, and the cold weight released him.
John was up in a flash to steady him but Sherlock shoved him away and left the room, pain and dizziness be damned.
He hadn't been much older when his father died, just by a few months.  But even today he still had his mother.  He never really got on with any of his family, but he was closest to his parents when he was little.  They were away a lot, much like Dennison's, and he was usually left in Mycroft's care but when they were home they were always spending time with him.
"Nothing," John said.  "We didn't have anything planned, and this is your last night here, so I'm spending it with you."
After they returned home, Sherlock sat on the sofa.  Perfectly still, eyes closed, hands folded under his chin.  No part of him moved, to the point that John wondered if he was even breathing.
The relief spread across John's face in an instant as he said, "Thank you."  Then he was hugging Sherlock loosely around the shoulders.
Sherlock pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to John, turning away just as he heard the other man's phone buzz.
something. Maybe get Sherlock and Dennison a present, he thought. He know it wasn't necessary, and would make Sherlock feel awkward as hell, but he needed to get out.
No more texts came after that.  John waited up for an hour, even after Mary had gone to sleep, before he decided to put the phone down and go to bed himself.
John didn't know if Sherlock was asking because there was no one else to ask or because he knew John must have dealt with something similar. He decided it was probably a bit of both before responding. 'It could be that you don't feel like you fought hard enough to stop it. Weren't smart enough to think ahead and prevent it.'
Sherlock spent the night in one of Mycroft's guest rooms.  He didn't sleep, of course.  He just sat in the centre of the large bed, knees at his chest, hands over his ears, eyes squeezed shut.  He didn't want to see anything, hear anything.  If he were able to numb each of his senses, now would be the time he'd use that power.  Ever bit of stimuli added more weight to him, as if taking up physical space with his head.  And when his head was full, it moved to the rest of his body.
Again, many thanks to those of you who have come back to read this story as I picked it up again. Like I said, this ending is similar to what I had planned, but not exactly as I've lost my original outline. But even though I had a much longer ending planned, this is pretty much how it was ultimately going to turn out. I'm pleased to see this story finally finished, and hope you all find it somewhat satisfying.
"Where are you going?" John said, leaving the kitchen and the tea he'd started making.  "You know you can't go out alone, what if something happens?"
"Well, I'll give you some space, then.  I'll be back tomorrow, Sherlock."  Dr. Parson left the room, closing the door behind him.
Sherlock's gaze momentarily migrated from the picture on the screen to the cracked-open door. 'Ask him yourself, he's coming to check up on me.'
John felt anxious the whole way back to Baker Street.  Once he was there he paid the driver and sprinted up to the flat, a bit worried to see that Sherlock hadn't come out of his room.
John entered Sherlock's room to find Dennison already asleep, Sherlock running his fingers through the boy's hair.
Mycroft sighed.  He didn't want Sherlock to remove himself from John.  Dr. Watson had kept him healthy, had given him a reason to come home alive.  But Mycroft didn't know how to handle these other things.  These things that caused Sherlock pain.  He hadn't experienced them himself, and so he, for once, couldn't be sure what was the right thing to do now.  "I'll look into it."
John came out of the kitchen just as his mobile began to ring.  He'd just gotten off the phone, but he answered it when he saw the caller I.D.  "Mycroft?"
He nodded, relieved to hear she wouldn't dump him over this.  He wondered how long this one would last.
When he instructed Sherlock to lay back on the bed, he did so with a jump of his brow but little hesitation.  John lifted one leg, bending it up and down, back and forth until the movement felt less forced.  He did the same with the second leg and helped Sherlock sit back up.  "Better?"
Hello. Been a while, hasn't it? I left the fandom for quite a few years as it just got too... frustrating. I'm still not into it like I used to be, but I kept thinking of this story and how I had left it unfinished.  I've long since lost my original outline for the story, so how I'm finishing it is probably not the way I planned from the beginning.  But I wanted to finish it anyway. A few more chapters I think. Thanks for reading.
"I'm his friend, Mary.  The only one he's got.  Half because he dislikes people, and half because no one else has ever taken the time to understand him."
He closed the door behind him without bothering to turn the lights on.  He could see just fine by the window light.  He approached Sherlock and plucked the cigarette from between his fingers, submerging it in the glass of water Sherlock had been using in the absence of an actual ashtray.
“Sherlock.”  The man spoke his name with such ease, such openness.  Sherlock hated it.  “One of the maids said she smelled smoke coming from your room.  I'm coming in.”  He opened the door, and Sherlock mentally chastised himself for not locking it.
Even though he could still barely believe his friend was alive, he was more than a little amused at what he saw inside the room.  Sherlock sat on the edge of a large bed as a doctor attempted to take his vitals.  Every time the doctor tried something, Sherlock would move away, silently protesting.
The children of the neighboring estates had come around asking Dennison to come out and play games with them.  Although the idea of being alone did not appeal to him, he insisted that the boy should go out if he wanted to.
'Then you know almost everything.' was what displayed on the screen this time.  Then he typed again.  'Everything was pretty straightforward.  Locate, approach, remove.'
Then he blinked again as it began to sting.  His whole arm felt hot, and the rest of him felt so cold.  No longer heavy, but still cold as ice.
After dropping Mary off at home, and managing to secure a fourth date, John returned to his own home.  He knew Sherlock probably wouldn't want to hear about his date, but he would tell him anyway and he would watch Sherlock roll his eyes and that would be the end of it for the night.
"Sherlock..." John didn't want to say goodbye, he hated that word.  He wanted to take Sherlock in his arms, hold him tight and take him back to Baker Street where he belonged.
Sherlock stood, still glaring at John, and put his coat on. Even though he knew John wouldn’t make good on that threat, he felt it was hopeless to act like he wasn’t going to give in to him eventually.
It was difficult to teach without talking, though he supposed that was some of what kept him interested in it.  It was one of the few activities he enjoyed having to work through without a voice.  He couldn't talk while showing the different finger positions, certainly couldn't sign while his hands were on his or Dennison's violin.
The violin lessons were nice.  Sherlock had Mycroft send over the size ¼ violin he'd used at that age for him to practice with.  He liked teaching him, even if Dennison wasn't exactly a natural.  He was still getting the hang of reading music to begin with, and occasionally became frustrated with himself, but he was stubborn and Sherlock was just as much so.
In a few minutes the plates were abandoned and they were getting ready for their trip. The cab ride was filled with Dennison chattering excitedly.
"I haven't learned it completely," the boy said.  "But when the maids told me you were coming, one of them mentioned you couldn't talk, so I got a tutor to teach me."
With a nod and a smile John walked over to where Sherlock sat, looking down at him with an expectant face.  "Tilt your head back," he requested softly.
Sherlock was stunned still at Dennison's words. He managed to type, 'We'll have to continue this conversation another time, John. I have to have a word with Parson.'
Every sound he made annoyed Sherlock to his core.  Every cough, every shift, every page turn made him grit his teeth and hold his eyes shut until the feelings of violence faded.
Mycroft took John's leaving as an opportunity to pay his brother a visit.  Uninterrupted.  He entered 221B with ease, going right to Sherlock's room.
Sherlock pulled a phone out of his pocket and began typing.  When finished, he turned and showed the screen to John.  'Why not at me?'
But all he could bring himself to do was sit next to him, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson at each other's sides again, and say, "I never stopped missing you."
Sherlock closed his eyes again as he felt John's fingers start running through his hair.  This was what he wanted, what he wanted to
“You’ll have to catch me!”  Dennison ran to the center of the park where he began going in circles while the other parents collected their children and headed in all directions. “Come on! Catch me!”
“We’d best get going, actually,” Sally said.  “Maybe next time you visit you two can play together again, hm?”
He opened his eyes, waiting a few seconds for them to adjust to the dark. When he'd gained enough sight to see faint outlines of the furniture in the room, he sat up.
He took the pad back from her and took his time writing out his response before handing it back to her.
“Sherlock would have figured it out himself if he weren’t blinded by his attachment. He had an ache in his heart, and our cousin needed someone to love him.”
He pulled it from his pocket, intent on turning it off so no one could disturb him.  But the notification on the screen told him he had a text from John.
He stared at the computer for a minute, wondering what was wrong. He didn't find it hard to believe Sherlock had gotten hurt, with his balance as of late. But Sherlock had had a bandage on his arm the last night he spent in London, and there was certainly no broken mirror in 221B.
John took the steps up to 221B quietly, so he could hear any sign of Sherlock being awake.  He didn't have to guess, though, when he opened the door and found Sherlock sitting in his chair, staring at his violin.
“I wonder what he could be nervous about,” John said, joining them.  “It’s not like it’s a special day, or anything.”
Sherlock put an arm around Dennison's shoulder and nodded, using his other hand to lead him through the book.
John rolled away and sat up, rubbing his eyes.  It wasn't the most restful sleep, but it wasn't too bad.  Should he wake Sherlock?  He wanted him to sleep as long as he needed, but if he slept too long he may be left feeling even worse.  And he should probably eat something.
He went to Sherlock's bedroom door, seeing it cracked open.  He knocked softly.  "Sherlock?"  He whispered in case Sherlock proved to be asleep.
Dennison returned with a glass full almost to the rim with water. He handed it to John, who put it to Sherlock’s lips.
He shook it off, letting it fall on the floor.  Then he surged forward and hugged Sherlock, locking his arms tightly around the man's neck.
But he was too tired. Too tired to go hunting for his drug of choice, too tired to even crawl into his bed. He laid himself down on the floor and forced himself to fall asleep.
Sherlock ran through a list of possibilities in his head.  He wanted just a little more time here, time to get used to the idea of leaving.  For good this time; coming back had been a mistake and he knew that now.  He'd known it before but told himself things would be better if he could just see John again.
John sighed.  "No, I'm sorry...  I'm just confused.  I guess I'm a little hurt that you wouldn't tell me that you... but I do understand if you'd rather keep it to yourself.  You just seemed so out of it last night, and I felt helpless.  I'm not upset.  Well, I'm trying not to be, alright?  If you still want to go out, you can, but I can't let you go out alone."
Not the light knock of a child, or the timid knock of the staff.  It was Parson, and he did not want to look at him just now.
Sherlock gave no response, only kept following John's lead as he tugged him at the arm.  John assumed that meant he
"I'll-" John cut himself off, figuring Sherlock would refuse his help and end up getting hurt again.  "Please hold on to the bannister?"
And so what if he had?  What did it matter to him what happened to Sherlock?  Did the man even care about him?  About what he'd gone through, thinking his best friend was dead?  Blaming himself.  Visiting the cemetery every single day until just looking at the name on the headstone became too painful.  Packing all of Sherlock's belongings away, but being unable to leave the dwelling they'd shared.
Dennison nodded as tears fell from his eyes. He didn't scream, he barely made any noise much more than a sniff or a soft hiccough.
"Dr. Parson, Sherlock's doctor."  At Sherlock's sudden cold glare, Dr. Parson corrected himself.  "I mean, I'm the doctor his brother hired to treat him.  He's very particular about that.  And you are?"
“There you are,” John said with a smile so incandescent Sherlock felt himself smile back, bringing him fully back to Earth, to London. Back to John.
“Mycroft,” John said with a glare, “I don't know if you realise this, but your brother is depressed.”
John was getting frustrated.  'Then what?  What do need to do without me?  Why are you running from me?  Whatever it is, I can help you.  I want to help you, Sherlock.'
He walked over to Sherlock and kneeled in front of him, trying to get a good look at his face.  It was pale and thinner than it had been, and he'd already been so thin when he came back.  "You'd really do that to me again?"
That made sense, of course Sherlock would have picked up sign language.  Lestrade didn't know how long he'd been without a voice, but regardless he doubted it would have taken him very long to learn.  There was, actually, someone who could interpret.  He just didn't know how Sherlock would react.  'Sally Donovan is the only one here.  We can try to call someone else in, if you want.'
It wasn't fair.  Whether this was one of Sherlock's silly games or not, it wasn't fair.  Sherlock had made all the decisions himself.  He'd decided to jump. He'd decided to push John away so he could do it. He'd decided to trick everyone into thinking he was dead while he rid the world of everyone and everything connected to Moriarty.  And now he was handing all the responsibility over to John.
He laid there, the darkness giving him hope that sleep would come.  His activities last night were less of a distraction and more of a reminder of something he could never have.  He'd never wanted sleep more than he did right now.  He'd rather have any nightmare than this, simply because he would be safe in the knowledge that it wasn't real.
'About this.' Sherlock held up the arm with the bandage wound around it. 'What did you tell him about this.'
Be aware that I've added some new warnings to the story, and may continue to add in the future.  I do have everything outlined but who knows what shape the story will actually take.
Dr. Parson nodded.  "His brother insist he bring a medical professional.  And I did treat him for quite a while."
But Sherlock made no move to embrace him.  He just stepped away, gave a small wave which John returned, and walked away.
Dennison seemed completely focused, but Sherlock's mind kept wandering.  These were all cold cases, all boring murders that had sat stagnant for years since before he even started consulting with the police.  Not particularly interesting, so he wasn't too frustrated when he found his thoughts straying.
“Shh.” It was a gentle shush, one form of vocal communication he could use. He didn't very often, because alone in their house he didn't care how loud Dennison was when he was playing.
Dennison was up in the early hours of the morning, asking Sherlock to read with him.  Sherlock agreed, trying to quiet his mind.
'I reminded myself that I survived. I had extremely limited use of my arm at the time, but I was alive. Honestly I wasn't entirely sure what I was alive for. For a long time I was sure it was a mistake that I pulled through.'
Sherlock felt himself stiffen.  There were plenty of things John didn't know, things he would reveal in his own time.  'What did he tell you?'
I've tried about thirty times to post this chapter and every time something has gone wrong.  Hopefully everything is good now.
John had a feeling Sherlock pretty much knew what John's responses would be. He'd deduced his whole life after knowing him for less than a minute, how could he not deduce previous emotional states after living with him for two years? But if talking about it helped Sherlock understand, it would be okay. 'I was useless, Sherlock. I was a soldier but I wasn't good enough to fight anymore. I don't believe in destiny; I chose that purpose for myself and losing it meant I lost everything.'
John took a breath and stepped out of the flat.  He approached Sherlock, but stayed behind him.  He didn't want to scare him away.  "Sherlock, I... Mycroft came by after you left the other day.  He explained things.  A bit.  I know why you... why you did why you did.  That doesn't mean I'm... okay with everything, but... Sherlock I don't want to lose you again.  I asked for one more miracle and I can't just give it up just because I'm angry.  Will you please talk to me?"
Sherlock moved further back onto the bed, using one hand to help himself balance and clasping the other onto Parson's waist so their bodies wouldn't separate while he found a comfortable position.
John sipped his tea, not taking his eyes off Sherlock, whose own eyes were closed and who had yet to touch his own cup of tea.
Mrs. Hudson handed him a list of ingredients, which he stuck into his coat pocket. “You look happier than I've ever seen anyone.”
“Just hear me out. I know you’ve been depressed. Whether that’s because of losing your voice, or what you went through the last few years, or any number of things, I want to help. And I think this would be a good thing for you to consider. I’ve gone ahead and scheduled you a consultation with her.”
Sherlock went back to his own room and followed his own instructions.  He dried his hair with a towel, allowing the loose curls to reform themselves.  He smoothed the frizz on top with a comb.
Dennison was waiting for him in the garden, sitting on the bench they often took to after dinner. He looked up when he heard Sherlock come outside.
He waited up for hours; he wanted to be awake when Sherlock came home so he could check him over himself.  Not that he doubted Dr. Parson's abilities, but he doubted he'd get anywhere with Sherlock.
Sherlock looked over at him and stuck out his hand. Dennison sighed and took it, both of them following John upstairs after thanking Mrs. Hudson.
John pulled away and put on as normal a face as he could conjure. “Let’s go check on Dennison.” He made his way back inside, expecting Sherlock to follow. He did.
But he always changed his mind, the inability to speak giving him more time to think about what he was about to say.
'While I was away, I occasionally had difficulty focusing on the task at hand.  I learned to focus my attention on one thing, one task, but block it from my immediate thoughts.  Dissociative multitasking.'
'Getting tired?' John asked, glancing at his clock. It was long past when Sherlock would normally be asleep.
'That kind of thinking only leads down dark roads. It's good to take responsibility for your actions but not to the point where you're blaming yourself for everything bad that happens to you.'
"He... said you'd, erm, fallen in love... with someone.  While you were away."  He stared at Sherlock, awaiting his reply.  He hoped for Sherlock to deny it.  For him to say Mycroft had lied.  And he wasn't sure why.
A few minutes went by and John thought Sherlock was ignoring him.  He felt a bit guilty about saying that so bluntly, but it was something Sherlock made clear to everyone who showed any bit of interest.
Sherlock wasted no time in standing away from the table.  He didn't bother putting Dennison down, just held him on his hip as he walked out of the room.
'Maybe I'm not just doing it for you.  Maybe this is a selfish act disguised by words of concern for you.'
Parson stood, pushing the chair away from him with his movement. “And what would you have me tell him, Sherlock?” he asked, almost pleading. “You want me to tell a six-year-old that you've been slicing your own arm open two or three times every night?”
Just like he'd paced around 221B, John walked aimlessly about the airport. He double-, triple-, and quadruple-checked the time and area for Sherlock's return. He thought about having a sign with their names on it, like in films, but decided it might be overboard.
Sherlock ignored the question, instead pulling John into a close hug.  He held his breath until John's arms closed around him.
"Good luck," the doctor said, stepping back from his patient.  "I can't get him to listen to a word I say."
“Has he done anything to try and help you?”  Silence.  “I think you need to find another doctor.  You won't let me be there for you, you at least need a competent professional.  He's not either one if he hasn't even tried to...” he trailed off, seeing the look on Sherlock's face.  “Has he done something to you?”
Sherlock nodded, but the tight look on his face told John he wasn't exactly sure.  What did alright even mean?  Was he alright or was he sick?  Was he alright sitting there?  Was he alright aside from his lack of voice?  What was the standard, what was alright versus not alright.
John nodded, understanding the flat feeling a bit stuffy during and just after an argument, even a resolved one.  "I was going to do some shopping this afternoon, we're running low on food.  D'you want to come with me?"  He said it mostly as a joke, the thought of Sherlock Holmes willingly accompanying him on a grocery run causing him to chuckle a bit.
It took a few seconds for John to respond. And when he did, all he could manage was a soft, sad, “Oh.”
"You were gone all night?" he asked.  "You could've texted me, at least, to let me know you were alright."
John didn't go to sleep that night, didn't even bother to try.  He knew his thoughts about Sherlock would keep him awake.  What went on in his head?  What did he dream about?
Sherlock's eyes opened and he reached for the pen and notepad kept on the counter.  He quickly scribbled something on the paper and pushed it toward John.  'I was watching you sleep.'
But after a minute a reply did come. A series of replies, actually, one following quickly after another.
Quickly Sherlock stepped out of John’s reach and joined the boy down in the mud. Dennison climbed on top of him and smeared a clump onto Sherlock’s face.
"Is there anything else I should know about him?" she asked after a few seconds of silence.  "He's your friend, and I'm your girlfriend, so I think we should be able to get along."
“Alright,” John agreed. “We can make a routine out of it. Let's get to it.” He scooted back a bit and put his arms up in the starting position. He lifted his eyebrows up, urging Sherlock to follow Dennison's lead.
John's confusion was turning into frustration, but he was trying really hard not to seem angry.  He was angry, and Sherlock knew, but he wanted them to work it out.  "Will you please just wait a minute?"
"Are you going somewhere?"  He'd just gotten back.  Where would he be going?  How could he even think of leaving again?  Or was he simply moving into another flat?  With Mycroft?  With John?
They spent a few hours (after John had gotten dressed) together on the sofa, John reading and Sherlock simply sitting with his eyes closed, running over plans and possibilities in his head.  Every once in a while John would get up and bring Sherlock something to eat or drink, and Sherlock would take it without a fuss.
The amused tone in John's voice brought a hint of a smile to Sherlock's lips.  He felt some of the weight lift off him.  But he still had no motivation to move.  'The bed wasn't working.'  He'd decided that if he couldn't fall asleep, he'd just lie there until he passed out.
He was further distracted when Dennison decided to speak.  “What did you mean yesterday? When you said you weren't good.”
Sherlock nodded.  Dennison was his first cousin once removed, grandchild of his mother's sister and her husband, who'd been killed eight days ago.
John's eyes flickered open and he breathed in a big breath.  Even through his squint he could tell it was still dark, definitely too early to wake up.  He rolled over, tugging at the covers to cocoon himself and go back to sleep.  He opened his eyes one last time to be sure it was still dark and found a face staring intently at him.
John tried to calm himself.  He'd always been protective of his friend, since the very beginning.  And now he just felt so helpless.  He couldn't
“No, don’t shut me out now. Not after all we’ve been through. If you don’t want to go, I’ll cancel. But I wish you would think about it.”
There was a short pause before John's next message came. 'Ah. Can you describe what it makes you feel?'
"I don't understand, are you ignoring me?" he asked Sherlock.  "You must know I'm here, you opened the door for me.  So why are you ignoring me?"
"He didn't return Sherlock's feelings," Mycroft said easily.  "He remains under my watch and protection.  They've kept in contact, although Sherlock has plans to put an end to that."  Mycroft's stone face faltered for a moment so small John thought he might have imagined it.
"No," John said, pushing the pad away as if it were the most offensive object he'd ever beheld.  "I forgot one thing, that doesn't mean I was forgetting you."
Sherlock stared at the screen after sending the last message.  He watched John's responses flash across the screen as the phone vibrated with each incoming message.
