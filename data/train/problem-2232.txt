“Mm, do too. Sorry.” John pressed his lips lightly against Sherlock’s nose and gave his head a shake as Sherlock sat there unmoving except for his excessive blinking.
“It’s like I can’t get rid of you… Not that I want too!” John began laughing as he wrapped his arms around Sherlock, pulling him close. In response, Sherlock proceeded to bury his face deep within the junction between John’s neck and shoulder. “There is hardly enough room on this sofa for us… Would you allow me, Sherlock, to take you to bed for a proper cuddle, and
John now took half a step  back and gave Sherlock a good long look, noticing for the first time since arriving the rather prominent tent in Sherlock’s trousers.
“Let me. Wouldn't want you to strain yourself.” Sherlock gave John a brief smirk before swiftly pulling loose all the buttons on his shirt. He was quite sure one or two of them had come loose in the process, but found he honestly couldn't care less at the moment. Sherlock then rolled off John long enough to remove his own trousers before returning to his previous position. John made use of Sherlock’s absence and kicked his own trousers off then whimpered happily once Sherlock was back on top of him. He closed his eyes, expecting to feel Sherlock’s lips on him but after a moment opened them again to see Sherlock staring at him with striking intensity.
“Mr. Mycroft Holmes has enlisted my help in ensuring these go directly to your hands,” the man said as he stepped a bit closer, handing John the thick manila folder.
Settling down over Sherlock’s thighs John sat up straight. Dragging his fingernails across Sherlock’s arse he sighed as Sherlock began to wiggle. “Stay, the fuck, still….” he brought a hand down hard on Sherlock’s pale arse and gave a satisfied grunt as he left a red handprint behind.
“Alright then, Husband, whisk me away for our romantic dinner. However I should inform you that I have to be back by the last stroke of midnight.” John rolled his eyes at the guard, who was standing beside the gate saluting them, then grabbed onto the side of the jeep as Sherlock stepped on the gas and they lurched forward.
If he was going to be honest, John really wasn’t paying much mind to what Sherlock had put on. Whatever it was most certainly wasn’t anything as spectacular as the man laying next him. Sherlock, despite not wanting to watch anything, was actually quite focused on the television. John silently watched as Sherlock’s pale skin lit up, the light bringing out all the colours weaved into each iris. The arm that had been covering his face, was now thrown over his head while the other was draped across his middle, fingers idly caressing the strip of skin that was being exposed by his shirt riding up.
With a growl John reached for the lube, snatching it up from the shelf. He popped the cover open, squeezed a liberal amount onto his palm and slicked himself up while assessing the situation. Sherlock was much taller than he was, but if his legs were properly spread like so, John used his left foot and kicked Sherlock’s legs apart; and if he were bent forward like so, he placed his free hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and pushed, he should be able to…. John thrust in, grabbing Sherlock’s hips with his slippery hand and leaned forward, resting his forehead on Sherlock’s back.
From behind, he pressed his body against Sherlock’s and clamped a hand over his mouth, drawing him in tight. “You know what you do to me,” he admonished, sliding his free hand down Sherlock’s torso, ever teasing and never touching anything below Sherlock’s navel. “The last week… mmmm no, month, you’ve been pushing every single one of my buttons. Why? Hmm? Waiting for me to snap? To take charge? Turn you helpless?” John was slowly grinding his cockstand against Sherlock’s body and Sherlock was limp, not fighting in the least bit other than moving away from the spray of water so he could breathe through his nose.
I can say one niceish thing about this place. Base is located in the fork of two major rivers. Being this close to water means I get to see a little more than just sand everywhere. There are even a handful of flowers that are somehow trying to survive just outside my hut. I think I might try to cultivate them. If I manage, I’ll send you a clipping when the flowers are in full bloom. And some seeds, if I can manage.
“Well, what are we still doing here?” John laughed and stood up, offering a hand to Sherlock, who took it and got gracefully to his feet. They packed up quickly, knowing they had precious little sunlight left, and Sherlock made no complaints when John declared he was driving.
“Hush, you.” John reached over with the pretense of sliding an arm around Sherlock’s hips, but at the last minute gave his bum a swift pat. “Come on, let’s get your stuff.”
“Sherlock?” John was just in time to see a flash of pale skin and white towel disappear through door on the far side of the room closed with a soft click.
one of them. They didn’t talk much on the drive, simply sat hand in hand, thighs pressed firmly together. Sherlock occasionally looked out the window, but for the most part, he kept his eyes forward. Just as they were pulling up to the airport Sherlock’s phone dinged. He pulled it out and hissed as his face turned into a scowl.
Write back soon! I find I’m quite enjoying this, us writing. Rather nice having a friend isn’t it? I half find myself wishing e-mail were an option. Would be much faster. Any chance your brother will be letting you use electronics any time soon?
“I loved it.” John cupped Sherlock’s chin in his hand and gently tilted his head up. “Loved it. But I want to be selfish first, I want you… to myself for a while before we think about adding anyone else to our family.”
“Turn,” John commanded, removing his fingers and wiping the lube off on Sherlock’s arse. He unzipped his trousers and pulled his cock out, giving it a few strokes as he watched his lover. Sherlock turned, and in one fell swoop John put his hands under Sherlock’s thighs and lifted him. Understand, Sherlock wrapped his legs around John and, using the wall for leverage John let go with one hand and lined his cock up. Then slowly let Sherlock sink down, sheathing his cock in the warm heat of husband.
“Mmm.” John nodded, now having to speak louder to be heard over the sound of the engine and rocks crunching beneath the tires, “Something like that. More like, I transform back into Captain Watson-Holmes at midnight.”
They stayed like that for an indeterminate amount of time. Mycroft did he’s best to offer comfort, while also trying not to smother. Eventually Sherlock’s sobs gave way to ragged breathing and violent shakes. A few minutes later Sherlock wordlessly pulled away and, using the table for balance, slowly stood up. Gathering the contents of the package he turned towards the bedroom he’d once shared with John.
“Trying to get rid of me?” John arched a brow over his mug but Sherlock just rolled his eyes. “We could go together?”
Sherlock’s hands fumbled as he attempted to keep his toothbrush from colliding with the bathroom floor. Swiveling his head to look directly at John, he was met with a side view of a pleased smirk and knowing look. Swallowing past the lump in his throat, Sherlock made a deliberate cough before returning to his morning routine as if nothing had happened.
Throwing open the closet door, Sherlock sifted through the possibilities. Normally he would have worn his dark purple dress shirt, however last night activities made that obviously impossible. Sherlock scrunched his face in contemplation, realizing he really had no concept of weddings and the specific details that went with them. He knew the basics, but that was where is knowledge stopped. Usually the groom wore a suit and the bride a gown of some kind, usually white to signify virginity. At this Sherlock snorted. The average female usually lost her virginity around the age of seventeen. Such a notion of glorifying something that obviously lost its meaning years ago never truly made any sense to him. None of this mattered however as neither him nor John were planning on wearing a dress of any kind.
“Sherlock you have about thirty seconds to decide if you want to duck, or grab a gun and help. Three rogue civilians at our nine o’clock. Could become hostile.” John was already fingering a loaded pistol, without hesitating Sherlock picked up the assault rifle from where it sat beside them and flicked the safety off. He’d never held a gun before, aside from an old rifle his father had hung above the fireplace, used in the days of foxhunting, and it felt foreign in his hands.
“Oi, fuck off.”  John rolled his eyes and picked up the closest thing he could smack sherlock with without hurting him. He rolled the manila envelope up and swatted at Sherlock’s arm with one hand, while trying to read for the keys with the other. “Give me those, mister!” he laughed and tossed the envelope back down on the coffee table.
“John, please.” Sherlock voice was hardly above a whisper and his fingers twitched on the cold table.
“Mmm.” Sherlock hummed, John’s cock still buried in his mouth, the hum sending vibrations shooting deep into John’s groin. John alternated between teasing Sherlock’s nipples and stroking whatever skin he could reach as Sherlock’s hair tickled his stomach. After a moment Sherlock’s hand, the one that wasn’t lazily tugging away at his own erection, came up to fondle his balls.
John, held him up as he continued to suck and swirl.  Sherlock was so lost in the sensation of John’s mouth that it was all nearly over before it had really started. Just as he was about to let go and spend himself less than a minute into his first blow job he managed to gasp out, “John.. John, stop! Not yet.”
Also, I am not sure if your comments on the different “H” meanings was a depiction of your stupidity or you displaying something I have been informed is called “being a smartarse”? Or possibly this is the Captain’s way of avoiding the subject; a means of deflection. Which would mean you are either embarrassed or disgusted by the answer. Regardless I will have you know that, not only are some of those definitions quite vulgar, but your personal favorite is also quite painful. I did manage to scar one of the on duty nurses however, so there is that satisfaction.
“I see.” Sherlock nodded, and somehow found himself comforted by John's words. He had never given having his own children any serious thought. Hell, he had never given the idea of surviving past his thirties any thought either. At least, not until he'd met John. “I don't know which it is, but I do know, whichever it is, I'm not ready to make that decision now.”
“Well, that’s that.” John said, picking up Sherlock’s discarded towel to dry his hands. “Now, I’m going to go get dressed, and then, Sherlock, we’re going to go get married.” he tossed the towel back down and grinned at Sherlock.
“Going… to…” he grunted between bites and thrust, “come so hard in.. inside you. You’d like that… wouldn’t you?”
“Mmm that… right there! God, yeah. Fuck, Sherlock!” John murmured into Sherlock's ear before locking lips with his boyfriends and bringing his left hand up to grab a fist full of damp curls. “So close… do that again… come on you gorgeous man. Make me come! Jesus!” John shouted as Sherlock’s cock shifted so it was directly beside his, rubbing him through their pants. “Yeah, god you're brilliant!”
“For the love of…” John mumbled, waving a hand in front of his face while doing his best not to gag, “if you insist on blackening your lungs, at least open a window so you don’t trash mine at the same time.” Still waving his hand in front of his face he stepped over the ring of papers surrounding his husband and opened both windows in the lounge, and then the one in the kitchen for a cross-breeze then went and sat in his chair, looking down at the mess in front of him.
“Where is he?!” Sherlock’s mind reeled at the implication. John, his John, could still be out there, alive.
I know both me and Tido have said it before, but we seriously can not communicate enough on how everyone's comments, patience and loyal readings mean to us. I can't speak for my other half, but this is the longest I've work on any piece and I have to say I am enjoying it immensely.  (⌒ω⌒)  ♡
“Not good?” Concern rippled over Sherlock's face and John felt the need to comfort him. He stepped up to Sherlock and brushed his thumb over Sherlock's cheek.
Early chapter is early. I work 9 hours tomorrow and it starts with me waking up at 4:30 am... *EEWWWWW**
I do hope you've enjoy our boy's little holiday together. This originally was only supposed to be 4 chapters, but these boys honestly write themselves and it was all we could do to shorten it down to what you all have. Thanks for sticking with us, and we hope you enjoy the following letters as much as we enjoy writing them.
Sherlock nodded with understanding and settled himself down on John’s lap. He let out a pleased hum when John’s talented fingers began massaging small circles over his scalp and forehead and closed his eyes.
*bows repeatedly* I am so sorry to my fellow readers! I completely forgot about posting my chapter for today! Went out grocery shopping, and something as simple as that takes a lot out of me sensory wise, so when I got home I just immediately curled up and called it a day pretty much until dinner. I know the saying, better late than never, but I still feel really bad about it...
“That’s not how it’s done.” John tried his best to look cross but as Sherlock reached a gloved hand up to brush the snow out of his hair, John couldn’t hold back his laughter any longer. “However, it is quite effective.”
“Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I think not.” John barked, and withdrew his finger. “Promise me you’ll be a good boy and not move.”
Sherlock nodded at John’s revelation. “If you look in the leftmost pocket of my bag, you’ll find a few packets of plant seeds as a gift,” Sherlock then gestured vaguely at his lower extremities, “thought it was better than merely putting a bow on my penis and saying happy anniversary.”
“I remember the first time I had sex, Mycroft. I kept the receipt.” Sherlock grumbled and patted his breast pocket while both men ignored the icy glare coming from their mother.
John chuckled and hummed again. Vibrations shot down Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock could have sworn he felt them in his toes as well. It was all over far too soon. Less than ten minutes into what was now his
“Mmm I think item number four will be my favorite.” With a broad smile John leaned up and pressed a kiss to Sherlock's lips. “So, you're certain you want this? It isn’t too… sudden?”
“Sir?” John ignored Mummy’s puzzled yet overly curious look and did his utmost best not to sound overly excited.
. In the bedroom. And you think I'm being dramatic?” John's free hand began waving wildly in the air and he was close to shouting now. “We
“This could actually be fun.” John smiled, but it didn’t quite reach the corners of his eyes. Sherlock had mentioned today being their last day together and it had created a knot in the very center of John’s stomach. How could he leave this man beside him and knowingly step into a active war zone? Sherlock sensing John’s thoughts, placed a soft kiss to John’s cheek.
The looked at the remaining photos. To John they held little interest, just footprints in the dusty terrain, leading in and out of the area and pictures of the tread of photographers. But to Sherlock, they told a different story.
Instead of obediently kicking off his shoes, Sherlock simply lifted a leg up into the air and grunted, giving his foot a little wiggle to make his point. John rolled his eyes, but stepped to the edge of the bed and (not so gently) undid Sherlock’s shoe laces, then pulled his shoes off of his feet.
OH... it has also been unbetaed for spelling mistakes or grammar. I do apologize, but I just don't have the energy in me to do that right now.
“No, not a side of me they’ve seen. As this has been my… second sexual encounter since arriving here, aside for our texts.” John fixed his trousers and gave himself a once over in the mirror he had hanging on the back of his office door. He brought a hand up to run a finger over the bandage on his cheek then turned to smile at Sherlock. “You did a good job, might just keep you around to help out.”
on any road known to mankind. Sherlock dove, with remarkable knowledge of the surrounding area, and drove as close to the river as the terrain would allow them. When they could go no further in the jeep Sherlock put it in park and pivoted, facing John as best he could.
Sherlock absentmindedly brushed his thumb over the fading scars. While most of marks were indeed gone, he knew that patch of skin would always be a reminder of the horrors he had suffered. Would John also see that particular area as such? Could he look at Sherlock and not be reminded of the dark reality that was Sherlock’ life? Sherlock knew that, as long as they remained in each others lives, John could do almost anything and he wouldn’t be the least bit affronted. However, Sherlock wasn’t so sure about where John stood. Granted, in his letters, the man seemed to be sincere about his devotion, though Sherlock knew from experience how quickly those emotions could change.
“Dull…” Sherlock sighed and accepted John’s offered hand, allowing his husband to pull him up onto his feet.
“Mmmmmm.” Sherlock smiled and leaned back, letting the water run over his chest as John’s lips wrapped around the tip of his cock. His whole body was suddenly warm, and he somehow knew it had nothing to do with the temperature in the bathroom. Sherlock was hardly aware of the noises he was making while John made his tongue swirl around the circumference of his cock, making Sherlock see stars and his knees go weak. But John, lovely John, smart John,
He came with a short grunt and his whole body went ridged. He felt, rather than saw, John’s hand  on his chest as he came undone, completely open and vulnerable. When he finally came to, John was staring up at him with a look of pure awe on his face, and his hands were on both of Sherlock’s thighs, rubbing small circles with his thumbs.
"Touch yourself. But don't you dare come until I say so." His voice was low and husky, demanding attention and obedience. Before Sherlock even realized what he was doing he had his hand around his cock and was stroking himself.
“Maybe I would… you know, want one. Someday, when the time is right. If it’s right.” John murmured, ruffling Sherlock’s hair as passed by to deliver the cups of tea. Sherlock’s eyes opened in shock, nearly spilling his tea as he scrambled to sit up.
“You can keep that,” John growled as he snatched it back, “when you grow a pair and pack your own bag.”
I don't need to know what's in here to know what I want, and that knowledge won't change how I feel about you. But if you want me to read this, Sherlock, I will.” John spoke softly, hardly above a whisper, as if he were scared that any loud noise might frighten his lover away.
"Uuugghhh, you'd better be."  John groaned and began tracing patterns on Sherlock's back. "I don't think I could stand a repeat of last night."
“Safe?” John shifted forward in the rickety chair and glared at Sherlock, “Like when we were on holiday, here, less than two hours away… And the fucking city got bombed? I wasn’t able to protect you then, how the hell am I supposed to do that here, in a war zone, on an army base, in Afghanistan.”
From the very start. You never hid who you were from me. Granted, I don’t know why you started using, but that is not my place to ask, and does the reason really matter? Your brother tried telling me why, but I told him off. I told him if I ever found out it would be because you wanted to tell me. That is your business, Sherlock, and I will never force it out of you. However, I will listen if you ever want to talk. Huh, this paragraph was meant to me
“Mathiesen broke down, halfway through my questions, and spilled everything.” Sherlock sat down in his chair, bum on the back of the chair while his bare toes wiggled on the seat. He propped his elbows up on his knees and beamed down excitedly at John. “Mathiesen, when he first arrived in Afghanistan, on his first night out to town, paid for Najmah’s services. It seemed… he was her first, shall we say, customer. She was so nervous she threw up, instead of sex he spent the night holding her hair every time her nerves got the best of her and cleaning her up. The next night, he again asked and paid specifically for her services. They sat together for most of the night, he said in a comfortable silence. He showed her pictures of his home back in the States.”
“Good. Because I’m willing to do a redo in about fifteen minutes.” John kissed Sherlock’s chin and laughed.
“I’m gonna use to use the loo, put my clothes back on, and then go figure something by way of a meal. Feel free to come keep me company.” John flashed Sherlock a smile then bent down to gather his clothing, giving Sherlock a full view of his arse as he did so. John turned to leave but just as he was about to step out of the room he looked over his shoulder and winked at Sherlock before making his exit.
“Yes, SherlockHolmes, very original. Also used the number three instead of the traditional e. Took me two guesses.”
“Screw things up?” Sherlock was still confused if he hadn’t ‘screwed things up’ with John by now, he wasn’t quite sure how a sink full of dirty dishes might.
John seemed to sense Sherlock's dilemma, and soon his lips ignored Sherlock's cock in favor of pressing soft kisses to the area around his navel. At first Sherlock wanted to demand that John return to sucking him off, but when one of John's fingers pushed inside, he instantly forgot all thought and gasped.
“There isn’t enough! I want to know what time this was discovered, who discovered it, WHY two seemingly lowly civilians were taken FROM the base, why the children were left behind. John!” He stood up so suddenly the papers on the table rustled, “I’m going to use your e-mail account, is that alright? Thanks.” Without waiting for John to even reply he rushed to the bedroom and came back a moment later with a laptop and soon was typing away in a mad flurry.
“Yeah, well, that person for me is Sherlock. He makes me want to do better, to be better, to be someone he can be proud of. I never… before him, yeah I’d been with a man or two… never would have considered myself gay though… but… it’s hearts, not parts. And his heart is the other half to mine. He makes me whole, makes me work harder so I can come back to him a better man.” slightly embarrassed at having said as much as he had, John cleared his throat and accidentally pricked himself on a rose thorn in his haste to stick the stem into the foam.
move, but it was one of Sherlock’s favorites. John could have a whining, snarky, sulking toddler Sherlock on his hands, and all he would have to do is say “Oh fine!” before Sherlock would give him the biggest grin he could muster and within moments would have his bare arse stuck in the air for John to suck.
Lestrade grunted something that sounded like “You’re welcome,” before jogging back down the stairs, closing the front door so hard it made Mrs. Hudson, who was still in the hall, squeak.
"John..." finally finding his voice he croaked out John's name, shuddering when John's fingers dig harder into his hips.
“Whatever made you think to come visit me?” John asked. Until then, they had been mostly been facing the river, but now John turned his back to the it in favor of watching the sun dip low on the horizon.
“Here.” He said, holding the flannel up to Sherlock’s face, “hold this for me.” But when Sherlock went to take it from his hand John made a clicking noise with his tongue and shook his head. “Not like that, open your mouth.” Being too turned on to be confused Sherlock simply compiled. He opened his mouth and John shoved the now balled up flannel into it. “That’s better. Now we won't be getting any noise complaints from Mrs. Hudson.”
“Sherlock Watson-Holmes.” John pivoted in his seat and looked over at his husband, taking in how Sherlock’s shoulders were slumped and his face wore an expression of unease. “Then you’ll text me, or call me, or we’ll video chat. You’ll talk me through what’s happening and you’ll come up with a solution. I have faith in you, so have a little in yourself.”
“Find that tea, would you? I’ll try to find us some cups. I think I saw some over here…” he moved to the far left side of the kitchen, to one of the still partially opened cupboards and pulled out two plain white mugs. “How do you take yours?”
John for his part couldn't keep his hands from moving. If they weren't  rubbing Sherlock's back encouragingly, they were grabbing fistfuls of arse and pulling him down for a more intense thrust. With one such hard thrust, John bent one of his knees, putting his foot flat on the bed for leverage. This new, stronger, friction caused each of them to cry out as pleasure coursed through their veins.
Sherlock glanced over at his husband. “You just answered your own question, John. We were two hours away. Here, on an army base? Where there are you and handfuls of other soldiers around? I think my chances of survival are considerably higher here. Logically, you would have to agree, yes?”
“I’ll behave myself, don’t worry.” John laughed and ushered his husband into the car. “See you in the morning.”
“Tomorrow then.” Mrs. Holmes said as she kissed both boys goodbye, pressing the container of lasagna into John’s hands.
“You’re pretty damn impressive,” Sherlock said softly, trying to change the subject. He didn’t so much dislike talking about his past habits, but being praised for being clean was rather embarrassing.
Sherlock to know. Wanted Sherlock to know how much this moment meant to him. To finally be able to kiss… Christ… it was perfect.
“Yeah, well… I'll be back. And we’ll see each other in a few months, and hey,” John pulled away and wiped the tears off Sherlock's face with his thumbs, “the plane has wifi, e-mail me when you get home so I know you're safe.”
“Then touch me, John.” Sherlock pulled the thin sheet that had been covering him off and let it slowly waft to the floor. Before it had fully settled on the ground John was naked and hovering over Sherlock on the cot.
We don’t want to lose any readers, so don’t force yourself to read something that may or may not trigger you. We love you all and don’t wish to upset you.
I had initially told myself that I wouldn't bring up this topic, but I find I can't. Sherlock, was that a joke? You leaving in a body bag? Or, would you actually do something like that? This isn't just the doctor in me asking, Sherlock. If I can help, in any way… I don't do this, feelings, well. But, I feel like I'm closer to you than anyone else. And the thought of losing you… well, it isn't pleasant.
“Mmm, back to your bossy self I see.” John chuckled as he pocketed Sherlock’s card and kicked a shoe closer for him to reach. “Thai okay? And I’m getting you that blue shirt we saw. God you’ll look great in it.” he grinned and took a few backwards steps then looked around.
fault that Sherlock had gotten his hands on enough drugs to level a small horse while in rehab. Told me to stay away and I lost it.”
“Harder, John!” Sherlock growled, needing to not only see, but feel, how very alive John still was. Had the bullet stayed even a millimeter to the right, their story would be a very different one right now. John's hand on his back felt like it was made out of molten metal, searing a brand into his skin, even the sound of John's breathing was amplified as adrenaline pumped through both their bodies.
Another day another chapter. I hope you enjoy. My muse gave up on me at the end, so I'm sorry if it seemed rushed.... I just had no idea what to do.
“This is for you, ‘Lock. Please, use them wisely.” Mycroft slid the heavy envelope across the table and allowed himself a brief smile at his little brother’s eagerness. Sherlock tore the envelope open and pulled out a brand new laptop and the newest model in the smartphone market. “Both you and John have international calling added to your plans, texting included, of course.”
“I ran into him, quite literally. It was during holiday, and the Chemistry Lab was going to be unoccupied. Needless to say I saw an opportunity to perform some experiments I had been wanting to indulge in; I had developed a close friendship with the janitor and he made sure to leave a particular lab unlocked. It was during one of those trips to the Lab that I collided into him.”
“Oi! Is that any way to talk to the man who just proposed to you? John tore the computer out of Sherlock's hands and tossed it to the side of the bed as he crawled over Sherlock’s lap.
Later in their bedroom John sighed and stopped in his third attempt to pack his bag. He stood next to the bed, looking over the mess and groaned, looking over at Sherlock who was gleefully running around the room snatching up random items, all of which belonged to John. For the past twenty minutes John had been attempting to pack, only for Sherlock come around behind him and pull everything back out of his bag.
“I was emaciated and emotionally dependent. Everything came crashing down when Victor attempted to take our relationship to the next level. As much as I was invested in our partnership, sex was just something I wasn’t ready or willing to take part in. You can imagine how someone like him took such a response. Thankfully Mycroft appeared when he did. I assumed that it was luck that he had been on his way over, though now I know differently; even back then Mycroft had his way of looking in on me.”
“You’re still handsome, Arthur.” Mrs. Holmes patted her husband on the bum and clicked her tongue as he headed out to bring the bags to the car.
“Hmmm? Oh!” It took John’s blissed out brain a moment to catch on to what Sherlock was asking but when he did he felt a warmth in his heart that he couldn’t explain. “I just..I saw you, with your dad. And I couldn’t help picturing you with a child curled up in your lap.”
For a moment, Sherlock was completely distracted by the feeling of John’s fingers wrapped around his own. He forgot that handholding was actually something they could do now, that John may have actually wanted to hold his hand outside the privacy of their own personal sanctuary. That's what Sherlock was starting to view the private little cottage as, his and John own personal hideaway from the rest of the world. He was even more surprised that he actually enjoyed such a small display of public affection, even desired it, even though there really wasn't anyone around to see it yet.
Sherlock found his hands cupping John's face. John. His John. Who was somehow here, with him, rutting his hard cock against his body, proving that at least part of what they'd promised each other still held true. John wasn't repulsed by him, he wasn't ashamed to be with a man. Quite the opposite in fact, if the steel rod grinding into him was any indicator.
Now that my lecture is out of the way, and I have voiced my concern, allow me to go on to more happier events. I wish you could have seen Mummy when she went to check the post and saw your letter. I actually think she was a bit heartbroken that you hadn’t mentioned her in it. When she found out that I was replying however, she immediately took my father and went to town. They came back with bags upon bags of items for you. I believe she bought out the entirety of the travel sized toiletry items in every store around us. I dare say they won't all fit in this care package.
“Why do you think he did it?” John asked after a while, brain firing on all cylinders again and now slowly going back to the breakout.
“You’ve already said that!” Shouting Sherlock stood from his chair and began pacing. “Clearly, If you are here with a bloody package in your hand you found some of John’s belongings and not John. Tell me how John died, and when I can see the body.”
As John’s mouth began to gently bob up and down one of his hands, Sherlock regretted to admit to himself he couldn’t tell which, began to trail lightly over his body adding to the already overwhelming stimulation. Soon a light sucking joined the friction, then John’s tongue was back in full force. It swirled over and around, and under, and god, It was every where. It was too much, and not enough, all at the same time. Sherlock grabbed fistfulls of blankets as he bucked up into John’s mouth, earning himself a chuckle and a humm..
“Mmm. It is.” Sherlock tucked the loose ends into his jacket then straightened up, blushing as he added softly, “I adore it.”
Well, as you can imagine the rounds heated up and went off. The poor bastard had metal and wood splinters embedded into his upper thighs and testicles. Two hours of surgery later, he was asking how long it would be before he got to go back with his troop. I believe you had mentioned something about how idiotic normal people were?
“Mycroft, fetch the camera, dear.” Mrs Holmes kissed her husband on the cheek then stood, eliciting a groan from both of their sons.
“Right….” Yawned John after having been on the phone for twenty minutes. “We've enough food to feed all of Wales for a week.” As he passed by Sherlock to take a seat at the table he squeezes his shoulder and smiled at the way that Sherlock's body curled towards the touch.
“Fuck yourself, both on my fingers and hand. Try and make yourself come if you can ‘cause God knows I’m about to.” John growled, shifting slightly so his cock slotted between Sherlock’s thighs. Oh, and did Sherlock move. He rutted back and forth, side to side, and whined as he tried to get John’s fingers to even graze over his prostate. But it wasn’t enough, John began grunting, his grip tightening as his body gave in to pleasure, leaving Sherlock groaning and rutting in frustration. If he could get John’s hand to slide down the length of his cock just once he could come. With a yell, John came and promptly removed his hands from Sherlock. Sherlock whined and ground his teeth in frustration but John just kissed his neck softly.
“Mess up like that again, Sherlock, and I’ll add in 5 more at the end… Oh, but look at this…” John bent down low and bit down hard on a perfectly formed handprint. “Isn’t that gorgeous?”  Without waiting for Sherlock to reply John stepped back and let the riding crop crack down 10 times in quick succession.
John adjusted his angle, adding an upward motion with each thrust causing him to slam directly into Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock uttered a  series of low grunts and his head went limp between his shoulder blades. Hi his chin hit his chest as his head bound up and down through the violent thrusting.
Your brother (Can I please punch him?) is staying here on base “On business,” which I interpreted as him spying on me. And while I doubt he’ll keep this letter sealed… I’m going to give him my reply before he leaves, if only because I know it will get to you much sooner than the regular post would.) So, that said, I’m going to wrap this up and deliver it to him. (And maybe punch him... I swear, that black eye was not my fault.) But, before I go…. Sherlock Holmes, don’t you bloody use before now and the 12th, okay? Please? For me?
Posted from my phone before checking it for typos/errors also written partly on my phone. Life sucks for me right now.
“Right erm… don’t…. Yeah, don’t move yet. I’ve got to get the floor cleaned up before it really stains.”
“Oh, you bastard…” John managed to whimper out as he tossed the bottle of lube aside and shuffled forward on his knees. His thighs met the backs of Sherlock’s legs and Sherlock impatiently pressed himself back against John, groaning in frustration when instead of going inside him, John’s overly slick cock slid between his legs. “Oi, give me a mo,” John grumbled out and gently pushed Sherlock forward.
Like Sherlock had predicted, they were able to find the basic necessities for what they had planned. While John silently wished they could have found something a bit extra, he was still quite satisfied with their purchases.
2) The majority of this chapter was written seconds ago! Blood wanted me to mention how amazing we were for punding it out so quickly lol
“You two do realize that I’m right here, listening to you bicker like children?” He shimmied into his coat and patted his pocket, checking to see if Mummy had stolen his cigarettes yet.
“What now?” Swapping tea for laptop John leaned forward and took a sip, still unable to hold back a bit of a moan at having a good and proper cup of tea.
I apologize for how long it has taken for me to get this out, and for how little it is... I've just entered into a new relationship, and he's been getting most of my free time. Plus work is insane, and we got 20 inches of fucking snow yesterday, so I was out taking care of that.  Until we go back to letters, the schedule might be a little off. I'll post when I have stuff written... I wont write much for this "meeting" because I simply don't have the time, and I have 4 other WIP's that have not seen an update since Feb... so I REALLY need to take care of those. Please be patient, as you always are!
“Because that’s why. Now come help me sort this out.” John rolled his eyes and began spreading the contents of the folder out on the table. He made three neat stacks. One of pictures, another of reports by Moran and the third contained reports from Rhodes.”
If anyone is interested: I've made a facebook group for Season 4 Spoilers. Just a place where we can discuss Season 4 as it happens!
Thank you for reading, and sticking with us! We'll do our best over these next few chapters! Day 1 of their meeting will come to a close in the next chapter, but they still have until December 26th!!!  And we have a few things planned for our boys during those days.
John ignored the strain in his pants as he entered the lab. At first glance one would assume that Sherlock was simply lost in his studies. Bent over the microscope, lost to the world. But John knew better. Sherlock was anything but focused, his feet were twitching, fingers tapping anxiously against the desk and his eyes were flicking back and forth.
blowjob, Sherlock heard himself scream as his whole body tesnsed. Thankfully, he had just enough time to warn John, allowing him time to pull away. John wrapped his left hand around Sherlock’s cock and gave it one final tug before Sherlock spilled himself over his own stomach and John’s hand.
John had heard of men having dry orgasms before, and as a doctor he knew they were medically possible. But he had never witnessed one before now. He soaked in every detail of his husband, who was now violently twitching, seemingly unable to move. John reached up a hand to stroke Sherlock's back, but thought better of it, not wanting to overwhelm the poor man.
“Uh… right… Yeah…” John blinked in surprise but began hastily ridding himself of his clothing and soon joined Sherlock on the
“Sweetheart, you've gotta go somewhere, and at least if you're with your parents I know you’ll be alright.” John tried to reason with Sherlock, but the younger man was having none of it.
Also, as you have written to me twice with the secondary purpose of relieving me of guesses concerning your middle name, I feel like it is only appropriately fair that you allow me two guesses of my own to counterbalance:
“Morning boys.” Mrs. Holmes smiled over at John and Sherlock as they entered the kitchen. For a man who had just been thoroughly shagged, Sherlock showed no signs of being embarrassed around his mother. He walked straight up to where she was flipping pancakes and stole a piece of bacon off the counter.
“Making babies… just in case.” John winked and tossed Sherlock the lube. “Your turn this time, don’t want it said I had all the fun.”
“Drab? Lackluster? Dull?” Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat back in the seat, crossing his arms like a child.
For a moment, it was as if time stopped. The noises of nature coming from outside and John’s movement beyond the walls phased out, leaving nothing in their wake except silence. It wasn’t deafening or awkward, like the silences that occurred during his school years or when Mycroft and himself were having a
“Mmmm…” Sherlock drawled and gave his bum a wiggle, sending a fresh stream of lube and come dripping down his perineum. John managed to catch it, just as it was about to drip off his bollocks.
” Sherlock echoed and emerged from under the blankets, eyes full of emotion, and if John didn’t know better he almost appeared to be on the verge of crying. “don’t miss what isn’t gone yet.”
I know a few more, but they’re calling for lights out. Possible air strike. Hopefully I’ll be able to get this out to you tomorrow if things calm down on my end. Might actually be able to go off base for a few hours! Maybe I’ll buy you a present.
One way you can do that is give me ideas, writing prompts, things you'd like seen/done. The more ideas I have swimming in my head the more likely I'll be to write! I miss writing, I just don't know where to go with these guys! I have SO MUCH planned for the end of the fic, most of it written down, but no idea what to do now.
Yes, that comment was pure sarcasm. As a doctor (which you picked up on shockingly fast) I do understand that it is impossible to snort anything through one's penis… Before I go into depths with what I fondly call the “Harry Situation” I’m assuming it is safe to guess that you and your brother don’t get along? Perhaps didn’t get along even before he placed you in rehab?
He moaned again and slowly rolled his hips forward, shuddering as he felt John's length slowly sliding out of him. At the last possible second, just as John's erection was about to spring free, Sherlock snapped his hips back and cried out as John's cock brushed relentlessly against his prostate.
“Like that did you?” he asked as he put the plug in place then picked up the flannel. Sherlock nodded and John smiled. “Good… now... Let me clean us both up, and then we can go out and get ice cream.
Watson?” as if he had no idea whose office he was in. (My name is clearly written on the door, and my uniform has my surname written in at least 3 places.) I nod, and remain silent. He then pulls something, an envelope tied around a small package, out of his inside breast pocket, (how did it fit there?!) and places it on the desk between us. Somehow, and I guess rightly so, I guessed I wasn’t supposed to reach for it yet; because then Mycroft cocks his head while wrinkling his nose and begins to question me about you.
“It’s like a phone call, only with video. Done over the internet.” John explained quickly, before either Holmes son had a chance to answer. “It allows you to see the person you’re chatting with.”
posh suit. His eye lingered on the purple shirt that almost seemed to shimmer in the light, changing colors slightly, and he had to remind himself that he was a grown man and drooling was not becoming. For a split moment he thought to ask just how Sherlock had managed to put that on in under two minutes, but instead he groaned for affect and held his left hand out.
As always, thank you to the wonder FourCorners... I could not have done this without her. She's really stepped up and helped out a ton since B had to step down! Any typos and miss spellings are my fault, please don't blame her. I've posted this without letting her give it a second "once over" because I felt bad for a lack of updates. If you see anything major please leave a comment and either myself or FCH will fix it (If AO3 lets us!)
“Yes, why did my brother have you hand deliver these. He alone has countless minions to do his bidding, probably some willing to wipe his arse for a paycheck,”
“Oh? Is that a threat, Soldier?” John stood, straightening up and making himself look as imposing as he could.
“John, you are aware that you’ve got a bit of something just there.” Sherlock screwed up his face into a bit of a scowl as his eyes dropped to John’s chin. “And a bit, well… it's on your nose. And cheek.”
“Honestly Mycroft, I’m hurt that you put forth such little effort. Are you sure your mind isn’t becoming crippled in your old age?”
John’s echo of navy blue with red accents rang out and Sherlock nodded to himself in understanding. Reaching back into what clothes Mycroft had brought, Sherlock pulled out a dark red dress shirt. The colour would not only go well with his dark suit, but should complement John’s attire as well. He didn’t have a tie available though, even if he did, Sherlock would have found some way to avoid wearing it. He didn’t enjoying having things around his neck, specifically things designed to be constricting.
“The women were found, still in the hotel room Mathiesen had rented for them. They were both beaten and left for dead. Presumably by Hakim or some hired men. The military doesn’t have the authority to press charges against him for what appears to be a domestic affair, and the local law enforcement didn’t care. Both women are being treated on base for their injuries. Rhodes said Najmah had it worse, most of the blows were to her back as if she’d curled up to protect her stomach. Rhodes said an ultrasound was done and it showed the baby was still alive. They’ll be keeping both women on bedrest until they’re well enough. Afifah will most likely be up and about, if not back to her daily duties, within a week; however, there is a good chance Najmah might be on bed rest until she delivers if she does. They’re unsure yet, the state of her uterus or other organs. I will be talking with my brother, once we are home, and will do what I can to see that Mathiesen isn’t punished too severely. He was clearly looking out for the mother of his unborn child and her best friend, albeit in a deranged way.”
“Sherlock, we’ve talked about this.” Sighing, John finished folding a t-shirt, placed it in the suitcase then stepped over to the bed. Crawling over his husband he nudged their noses together and cupped a hand around Sherlock’s face. “I have to leave, and sulking all day today and tomorrow won't do either of us any favours. Let’s make the best of today and tomorrow, well tomorrow I promise I won't leave the bed for more than five minutes at a time. Ten to shower. But that means I have to pack today. I’m not waking up at 1 am Monday just to pack.”
I’ve been told that mail here is a bit slow, and not always reliable. So please forgive me if this letter is old news by the time it reaches you, I just felt the desire to sit down and physically write something out to you.
in fact followed him into the kitchen, and was now lurking somewhere between hall and door. Knowing that the next few minutes would be crucial, if not the bloody key to their continued relationship, John attempted to make himself seem as harmless, yet human, as possible. At least, as well he could while dressed in full Army fatigues.
I am quite pleased that you liked the scarf. It was hand woven by one of my local patients. They can’t always afford to pay with money, so they give us what they can. I don't know why, but the moment I laid eyes on that particular scarf I knew you should have it. It just… god, would look amazing on you. That deep blue with your hair, and your skin tone. I bet you look gorgeous. As for your reaction to the way it smelled… I'm glad. I had mentioned in that letter how I had slept with it for a short time before sending it to you.
smoking. As if I believe for one second that Mycroft wanted to show Father the new tires on his car.”
“Right. Let’s do this then.” John let go of Sherlock’s head, but slipped a hand down to clasp Sherlock’s fingers in his.They walked hand in hand down a long, brightly lit hall, passing door after door; some were open, some were not. Sherlock looked pointedly to one closed door in particular and pulled a disgusted face.
“How am I supposed to do this when you won't take me seriously?” Sherlock snapped but there was no bite in his tone, just a twinkle in his eyes as he prodded John off of him. “On your stomach, I think. Want to try something new.” Sherlock positioned John so he was comfortably on his stomach, arms folded under his head, and a pillow under his hips, propping him up just a bit for ease.
“Now what?” Sherlock asked his husband while looking around their new home. His shy smile turned angry and he soon forgot about softly teasing his husband as his eyes landed on something that made his blood boil. He had suspected this, of course he had, but he thought that Mycroft would at least have the decency to wait until John had left. But no... With an angry growl, he got up and stalked over to the table behind his chair while glaring at a camera that his prat of a brother had put in.
Sherlock heaved a great sigh then rolled over, tossing the pillow aside as he did. John grinned and rubbed the remaining lube on his hands over Sherlock’s cock, then without saying a thing slowly lowered himself down on his husband.
"Cheers." John clinked their glasses together and held the rim to his lips with the intent of taking a hearty sip. No sooner had the liquid John's tongue did Mummy come bustling into the room, taking a seat directly across from the boys.
There is one more chapter before it goes back to letters/emails/texts. That will be posted for me by Blood on Friday.
“Mmm…” John huffed out as he stirred behind Sherlock and placed a kiss to the nape of Sherlock’s neck and whispered, “Jesus, you’re warm.”
I’ll have to have a shave and cut my hair before we head out. The operation shouldn’t take long, but I don’t know how long it will be until we’re back.
AO3 is messing up with e-mails. So I'm REALLY sorry if you guys don't get an e-mail letting you know about this chapter. B and I haven't been getting e-mails regarding comments or anything else. it sucks. So just... keep an eye out. We might mess up the schedules here a little bit over the next few weeks because of OUR schedules.
His stomach gave a loud rumble just then, and he tore his eyes from the pack and glanced into the kitchen. John had done the shopping yesterday and an idea overcame him. It couldn’t be that hard to cook breakfast, and wouldn’t John be surprised when he woke up to a tray of bacon and eggs in bed.
And he we are, the final chapter. I honestly suck at these sort of things, but I'll do my best. It's been a long and winding road since Tindo and I started this glorious story. Each of us has had our ups and downs. Personally, my downs had taken me away from this for a while, but thankfully I was able to find my way back. It truly has been an honour to interact with all of you. You have made this fic what it is. Without you, these would just be words on a page. You've helped bring this story to life. I'm hoping to delve into some solo projects at some point (that's my wish if my self-esteem would just allow it) and I hope to see some of you all there as well ♡〜٩(^▿^)۶〜♡
“Yes, the git knew today was our last day together, and he’s gone and crashed my sex holiday. Least I can do is embarrass him a bit by being overly sweet and mushy towards my new husband.”
I fear I must stop being so sappy before my heart breaks; because right now I want nothing more than to hold you close and press soft kisses over your face. Someday, my love. Someday, lord willing, I'll come home to you and we can start our life together. Will you wait for me, Sherlock?
Please expect a follow up to their fight in the next chapter, but for now, I'll give you what I have and go back to bed. (I have pneumonia.)
“Thank you, Office Lestrade,” John flipped open the folder briefly to see a report written by Colonel Moran and snapped it shut. “Mycroft must trust you, to have you deliver these.”
“When the needs must.” Sherlock backed away and let John slide off of the desk. John walked over to the door, opened it and checked that the hall was clear before shutting it and locking it. His window he left open to let in whatever bit of breeze there was then he turned to his husband, who was in the process of unbuttoning his trousers.
“Oi, if you get to keep stuff that smells like me, what do I get?” John crossed his arms and cracked a smile as Sherlock forced the last bit of pillow into his bag.
Ao3 is up down up down. I’m posting this quickly while it’s working for me from my phone. The format might be weird. I’ll fix it later.
“Hm? What , this?” Sherlock could practically feel John's smile as his finger curled again, this time sinking deeper into his body,
“You’re not kidding. Well, don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” Rhodes grinned at them both and gave John a wink.
“Oh, I had been hoping for that.” Sherlock sighed audibly from the bathroom, then the sound of running water filled the room.
Raising one of his jean clad knees, Sherlock began gently rubbing John’s groin while doing his best to look as coy as possible. “What should you do with me? I can think of a few things.”
John needn't have asked. The words were hardly out of John’s mouth when Sherlock let one testicle slip free of his mouth just to suck in the other one. It wasn’t until John wiggled his bum that Sherlock realized he was so preoccupied with his tongue that he’d forgotten to continue moving his finger. John gave a little sigh and settled back onto the bed as Sherlock sat up.
“Why to show him baby pictures of you, of course.” Mrs. Holmes teased her youngest son and she practically pulled John off the sofa. The twinkle in her eye was enough to snuff out Sherlock’s protests and she quickly added, “To help me with the Christmas roast of course! And maybe to give him a few tips on how to handle you when you’re bored.”
“Oh, don't worry about it, Sir.” John smiled, he didn't mind. In fact, he did find that under most circumstances he replied to Watson without even thinking about it.
Written and posted on my phone. I’m sorry I’ve been so busy I don’t have time to typo/grammar check. I’m lucky I have time to sleep, quite honestly. 4 hours of sleep and an 8 hour shift today and my heart is beating straight out of my chest from stress. Can literally feel it beat in my throat. Today’s gonna be a great day. -.-
Sherlock would be lying if he said that he was not taken aback by John’s sudden invasion of his body, however welcomed it truly was. Forgetting about his hair for the time being, Sherlock used the leverage from having his hands against the shower wall to subtly rock backwards into John’s hips. Sherlock then glanced over his shoulder at his darling husband, making sure he could see the smirk still resting on his features.
Let me just tell you... that I hope no one has anything negative to say about this chapter. I nearly fried my computer trying to use photobucket for these guys... (I have since found a safer site that does not have viruses pop up every five seconds)
“I don't know.” He bit his bottom lip and trailed a finger over Sherlock's jaw. Sherlock's eyes clouded over with confusion at his words, so John cupped his hand over Sherlock's jaw and neck, his fingers behind Sherlock's ear, gently massaging his head. “Do I devour you whole?” With a moan he leaned down and scraped his teeth over Sherlock's pearly white throat.
Also, Tindo (being the awesome, amazing person that she is) commissioned a piece of art for me for Christmas/Birthday and it shall be included in said chapter.  I'll also leave the link to the artists Tumblr at the bottom as well (:
” Sherlock shouted, into the carpet thankfully, so some of the volume was drowned out. “MMmmmm John… more…”
“Yeah, hearing is a bit… muffled, but we were both told we’d both fully recover.” John absently stuck his pinky finger in his ear and scratched.
“But not after this much time together.” John rested his head against Sherlock’s chest and splayed his hands over the small of Sherlock’s back, digging in his fingertips slightly as another sob tore its way out of his throat.
The morning traffic kept them cooped up in the car for nearly an hour. Living in central London certainly had its ups, but the rush hour traffic was
“Buckle up,” John reminded, squeezing Sherlock’s hand and letting go long enough for Sherlock to begrudgingly comply.
John tossed over the keys and watched as Sherlock skillfully flung his bag in the boot then slid gracefully into the driver's seat. He only hesitated a moment before getting in and making sure he was properly buckled.
Lifting his head up from its place nestled in John’s jumper, Sherlock gazed upon a rather shocked looking man below him. The doctor, thankfully, did not seem upset. In fact, once the initial shock of the fall had worn off John began to grin.
Sherlock pressed himself against the wall, head tilted up and eyes rolled back and came. He shook violently as he came all over John’s chest. John had to hold him up for the last few moments and soon he too was coming, and it took all his willpower to keep them both upright. Panting hard, John let go of one of Sherlock’s legs, letting him slowly get to his own feet, then half walked and half wobbled into their bedroom to retrieve the plug. Back in the kitchen h found Sherlock breathing hard with his face pressed against the floor, arse up in the air, but a grin the size of England on his face, the flannel now in his hands.
My Sherlock, please darling believe me when I say I keep my promises. Meeting face to face will only sweeten and strengthen our feelings. It will not destroy it, nor will it destroy us. There will be no pending destruction under my watch. When I gave myself to you, it wasn't something I did lightly. Nor was it intended as temporary. I will not hide you, or my relationship with you. Sherlock, you are worth every risk, and ever obstacle. I won't hide us away just because you are a man. If you were my husband, and I hid you away…. would you be okay with that? No. If I did what kind of partner would I be?
“John…” Sherlock gasped and pulled away enough to look down into the ocean blue eyes that were now rimmed with tears. “Not until tomorrow. We have today, still. Let us enjoy it. No tears.” But even as he spoke he felt a hot tear run down his cheek just for John to brush it away and nod.
John told Sherlock the story and how he'd be half overseeing the investigation from home, to which Sherlock was immediately intrigued. The rest of the evening was spent with John eating, while Sherlock picked at his food, too busy asking questions about the people on base, as he tried to figure out a suspect pool.
I’m sorry that this letter has bounced from topic to topic, and I’m sorry to leave it as it is. I’m tired, I miss you, and I’m hungry. I haven’t eaten anything since you left this morning, so I’m going to pull myself together and go bug the cook. I’m certain it won't be quite as good as our picnic last night, but maybe he’ll have made something halfway decent.
“Oi!” John slapped Sherlock's hand aside and rolled over, giving Sherlock his back as he mumbled, “I am
John stared at his mobile for a good solid minute before deciding Sherlock wasn’t going to reply any time soon. So, he turned up the volume on the telly, propped his feet up on the coffee table and wiggled about on the sofa until he was completely comfortable. It was another half hour before Sherlock replied. The current episode of Doctor Who was just ending and John’s eyelids were beginning to feel heavy. It was nearly 10. Blinking he picked up his mobile from where it sat beside him and read the text.
“Hmm… well, can’t promise it’ll be all that enjoyable. Might freeze my balls off in the process.” John rolled his eyes and gave a little shiver while silently cursing himself for being so cold. (There was a fire crackling away not 5 feet away from him, how was he
They cuddled for the better part of an hour. It wasn't until John, who was used to spending his days running around, every moment accounted for, grew restless. Reluctantly John pulled himself from Sherlock’s embrace and sat up. He ran a tanned hand up over his face, letting his short fingers run through his sandy blond hair before he gave up and collapsed against back into Sherlock’s waiting arms.
“Send those to Rhodes. Tell him I want to know what and how Mathiesen replies the moment he’s done questioning him.
“You don't look so wonderful yourself, John.” While she was kind, her voice was firm and John knew he wouldn't be able to get away without getting himself a thorough checkup.
“Are you sick?” John moved forward and was by Sherlock's side in a flash, pressing the back of his hand against Sherlock's forehead. “Hmm. No fever.”
, Sherlock? Hmm?” John none too gently grabbed a fistful of Sherlock’s hair and pulled down until Sherlock was staring up at the ceiling, mouth hanging open and his eyes blown wide with desire.
Sherlock gave John a slightly confused look. “What do you mean? I told you that I would inform you of anything I found uncomfortable. If anything I found holding your hand more than satisfactory.”
“Okay?” John handed the picture back and planted a hand on his hips while the other went to his hair.
“I will be…” John placed the envelope back down on the coffee table then sat with his back against the sofa, opening his arms as an invitation for Sherlock to come cuddle. “So come here, and tell me your story.”
This isn't quite how I imagined them finding 221B I had a bit of an... eviler plan for this flat later in the fic. But... it felt right that they have a bit or something go right for them.  With John going back in 2 months time, he'd be so much happier knowing that Sherlock was able to be on his own. (Despite being under Big Brother's eye, of course) A self-sufficient Sherlock, is a happy Sherlock.
Without speaking John snaked a hand beneath Sherlock’s body, wrapping his fingers around Sherlock’s leaking cock for the first time since arriving. He slid a finger up over Sherlock’s tip, coaxing back his foreskin and using Sherlock’s precum to help his hand slide more smoothly. With the first full tug Sherlock let out a cry and tensed around John, painting the floor below him with his come.
"I'm just...making sure you're alright. That there weren't any other injuries you hadn't told me about."
“Just what I wanted, tea-soaked toast. Thanks,” John rolled his eyes and sat took the tray from his husband. “You know, if you want to make this work it’ll need teamwork. What happens when we need lunch or supper?”
It was nearly teatime when John’s laptop dinged, indicating a reply from Rhodes. Sherlock jumped up from his chair, a map of his Uni campus fluttering to the ground as he moved from his chair to the table.
I was on bed rest, I’ll answer that now. I was sent on a rescue mission beginning of this week. A small town had been bombed and reports came trickling in of wounded in need of medical attention. Some were reported to be too unstable to move right away, so I was sent to help stabilize them for transport. It wasn’t supposed to be a dangerous mission, but with my limited knowledge of Pashto, my actions were misinterpreted from helpful to harmful. (I guess Belonephobia truly is the most common phobia.) I was attacked by my patient’s teenage son. After a short scuffle, in which I continuously shouted ډاکټر (Doctor) I was let go, but not before receiving a few minor injuries. And one… major injury. My Femoral Artery had been nicked, and idiot me didn’t realize it until a few moments later when my patient refused my help while pointing to my leg. Long story made short, I am now 100% fine, just bruised and tired. Now, please go back and re-read my last paragraph and stop worrying.
“The two nurses were civilians, locals even. Afifah Dunya volunteered to help after she came in with bruising… we suspected she was being abused. After the third time, she came to us seeking medical help one of our translators talked with her, offered her a job doing odds and ends. Laundry, kitchen help, OR cleanup, whatever we needed. She was so thankful she kissed his shoes and started weeping.
IF a tag makes you uncomfortable, skip the chapter and say in the comments. “Couldn’t read because: your reason here” and blood and I will give you a short summary update as to what happened.
These next two chapters, this and the following on Monday, will be shorter than the last few. I'm working on NEXT Friday's chapter now, their goodbye, so I went with short writing prompts I found to get me through the rest of John's stay in London. :)
“Ah yes.” Sherlock winked and pulled a small bottle of lube out of his pocket. “I believe… you’ll find me quite ready.”
“Cheers.” John forced a grin and once Mycroft’s foot had been removed, closed and locked the door behind him. “Is he always that boss-” John turned to look at the spot where Sherlock had been mere moments ago to find the room empty of anyone save himself.
Hi all!! FCH here, posting for lovely Tindo! A treat for our readers, we love you all! Our boys get a little smutty here but who's complaining? Enjoy!
All I can say... is I'm trying, really hard to just not give up, on you, on everything... I feel like everything is falling apart, despite having a great new job... I guess. I just need more help than I'm willing to receive right now...
In the dim light John could clearly make out Sherlock rolling his eyes. He was about to argue with his husband when Sherlock half-yawned, half-said, “You’re no good to anyone if you get yourself worked up with worry. Now go to sleep.”
“Mmm well.” John reached up and drew his arms around Sherlock’s back, then rolled their combined bodies over so Sherlock was on his back with him on top,
“Yeah, something like that.” John returned the smile and pulled away after a moment. “Let’s go see your parents off, and” he looked at his watch, “we should think about leaving soon too.”
Please know Husband, that I am not bringing this up in order for you to worry about me. Rather, so you can know that I am alright. Being home, rather than living alone, has helped me in way that I could never imagine. You are a wise man, John Watson-Holmes, and I love you all the more for it.
“Anything else I should know about, so I don't accidentally kill you?” Sherlock swivelled in his chair and gave John a curious look.
Over the past week, he’d started creating his own website. “The Science of Deduction” he was calling it. He wasn’t quite sure what he’d do with it, but for now, it was a mental exercise which he hoped would help him recover faster. While he was busy coding, John woke up beside him. He didn’t catch the slight movement of John’s eyes fluttering open, so when he yawned and said “Good morning, Luv,” he looked over in surprise.
“Good, Have a chat with him before he goes on. John,” Sherlock turned his attention from the laptop to his husband, “Is there anyone you trust, enough people to keep an eye on the children and an eye on Mathiesen?”
“Well…” John’s hand went from his face, where he was picking sleep out of the corners of his eyes, to run through his hair as he thought. “No, I don’t really think she was invited, so to speak. Afifah was rather shocked when she found out she had a guest, scared even. I was in the mess tent when the translator was called over. She was serving that day. She asked for a quick break, and we could hear the two women whispering outside the tent for a few minutes.”
Sherlock entered the bathroom just as John was stepping into the shower. He fiercely pulled back the shower curtain and flopped into the small shower, crowding John against the wall.
“Ahhh… I see you wear the pants’ in your relationship, as it were.” Mycroft rolled his eyes, then looked surprised as he sipped his tea and found it exactly to his liking. Extra cream and just over one sugar.
“Oh, Sherlock…” John placed his wine glass besides Sherlock’s and bent his torso as much as he could, while bringing his knees up, and Sherlock’s head with them in a sort of half crunch that allowed him to kiss Sherlock. “Jesus, I wish I could be done, could go home. Hell, I’d even settle for you moving here, but there’s no way I’m letting you live this close to danger.”
“No need to thank me, yet. These few next years will be trying. On both of you.” Mycroft wrinkled his nose and hid his worried expression behind his tea, but not before Sherlock saw it and nudged their feet together under the table.
“Video chat, what’s that dear?” She looked from John, to her sons, then to her husband. Mr. Holmes, who was stoking the fire, simply shrugged and went on whistling carols.
Acting as if John’s swollen cock wasn’t currently pressed between his arse cheeks, Sherlock began working conditioner into his hair while smirking at John’s threat. “Promises, promises.”
I’ve settled into my role here fairly well. For the most part, it’s very much the same as what I was doing before. Only this time I’m the one in charge, which means no more Short Straw shifts for me. I call the shots, and if my orders aren’t followed, I can pull rank and discipline as needed. For the most part, I’m the highest ranking officer here, most men are your basic (no offence meant) soldiers. Fit for battle, and here for one job. The hospital was mainly run by nurses before I got here, but with it being so close to the active warzone, it was only a matter of time before they needed a competent doctor. I’m happy to help, and much happier here (without Moran) than I thought I would be. A few of the men I served with in Kandahar were transferred here, good men, good doctors. I'm proud to have them with me. Still, I bloody miss you.
Sherlock opened the front door with far more dramatics then were necessary before practically bolting from the cottage. It wasn't until he stepped onto the dirt road in front of where they were staying, that he spun back around and shouted for John to hurry it along.
“What exactly is this, John?” Inquired Sherlock as he inspected the food as John placed a spoonful on his plate.
John found himself drawn to that piece of skin. He wanted to run his tongue across the small expanse, tasting what John has come to intimately know as Sherlock’s own personal flavour. He also wanted to be the only one who was allowed to give Sherlock any sort of pleasure, be it sexual or merely comfort. Deep down John knew his jealousy of Sherlock’s own fingers would be considered by most as “not good”, however he couldn’t help the claws of possessiveness from digging their way up his throat.
AMAZING Idea from cheekycheekbones: John should hide little notes around the flat before he leaves telling Sherlock why he loves him. (Don't worry, this won't be the only chapter we see the notes in!!!)
The rest of their ride was passed in silence. John kept a wary eye out for hostiles while Sherlock focused on driving decidedly
“One of the largest gun dealers in southern Afghanistan. You stole his property, essentially, by allowing them to stay.”
I've spent so long in the blazing heat, that I forgot how cold it gets here during the nights. Perhaps not as cold as my beloved England. But after spending so many months in the desert heat it certainly feels colder than it is.
As he opened fire for a second time, he heard John say “Shit!” and the car jerked to the left before continuing on course. They moved quickly enough that Sherlock couldn’t say for certain if he’d hit anyone, let alone killed another man, and soon the trio were out of sight and they could just begin to make out John’s base up ahead. Sherlock turned to commend John, not only for his excellent driving, but for spotting the men and being such a crack shot while speeding along through the desert. However, when he saw John, with blood streaking down his face, any compliment or praise he had disappeared as he gaped at his husband.
Lestrade blushed and gave a little embarrassed cough, but for a man who’d just been accused of sleeping with another man, held his head high. “Or he could have chosen me because I have the proper clearence to carry these files.”
“Huge scar, I’m afraid. People will mistake you for a pirate.” Sherlock joked as he soaked a wad of gauze in rubbing alcohol then cringed as he dabbed it against John’s cheek. “John it started bleeding again, quite a bit, actually.”
Sherlock happened to glance over at the waiting helicopter and was just in time to see Mycroft lean forward to look outside and see what the holdup was. With one last lingering kiss that was more tongue than lips, he tore away from his husband and began the solo walk to his ride. He didn't look over at John until his harness was attached and his bag properly stowed. When he did look at his husband, he found John standing with his hands behind his back, face set, determined not to cry. He nodded his farewell then there were butterflies in his stomach as the helicopter lurched and began to hover.
A lot of you guys have mentioned typos. I'm sorry if my replies are cranky, but I have bigger fish to fry than worrying about typos.
Wrapping his arms around the waist of his beloved soldier, Sherlock looked upward with a look that screamed self-satisfaction. “Well, yes. After all, he didn't do a proper job of it. Didn't even get down on his knees.”
“Right, then where the hell is the lube?” They both felt around in the blankets for the small bottle. Sherlock was the one who found it, and let out a chuckle as he pulled it from under John's pillow. John took it from his hand and collapsed on his left side with a devilish smirk.
“Git.” John said fondly and pressed his lips against Sherlock’s cheek. “Jesus, you’re freezing,” he noted as Sherlock began shivering beneath him. “We’ve been out less than ten minutes and you’re freezing. Skinny git, going to make it my mission to put some meat on your bones.”
“Are they safe?” John sat up, back against the headboard, ignoring Sherlock’s growl of frustration as he too had to sit up.
that I have been writing to a “special friend who is currently out serving our Queen in the war”. Mummy, in her usual manner, was all ecstatic about me “finding a nice boy” and began asking numerous questions about you. What your name was, how old you were and other tedious inquiries. Even after I explained rather explicitly that we were not dating,
As much as I would enjoy writing to you for the next few hours, so much has happened here since we talked last, I should practice a bit of self discipline and go to bed. We’re all running on fumes here and what little sleep we get is precious. The nearest town had a bit of action, and I've treated so many small children. Too many. Broken bones, open wounds from debris flying the air, starvation, god, Sherlock, it breaks my heart.
At the mention of food John’s stomach gave a loud growl. He hadn’t eaten since dinner the night before, having been too nervous on the flight here to eat. A quick glance at the clock told him it was only just past 11, nearly mid afternoon back on base, and he only then realized just how hungry he was.
Both men looked up from the kitchen table and watched as Mycroft stood and excused himself from the room. He returned a moment later with a large heavy looking envelope clutched in his hand. Without saying a word he sat back down at the table, tucked in and took a sip of his tea before acknowledging the curious looks.
They kissed, and kissed and kissed some more. All variations of kisses. Short, fast, hard, long, deep, light, whatever they could think of, trying them on for size. Neither of them pulling away, both of them moving closer, hands now moving roughly across the other man’s body. It wasn’t until the shrill whistle of the kettled startled both of them that they pulled apart. John jumped, and for one brief moment thought he was back in Afghanistan, that the whistle had been a bomb. But when Sherlock had reached around him to turn the cooker off with an annoyed sigh, John laughed. He laughed so hard his sides hurt, until he head tears in his eyes, until he clung to Sherlock with his head buried against Sherlock’s chest. His ears were filled with a soft rumbling that was nearly drowned out by the kettle and he looked up with a smile on his face.
“...Joh…” was all Sherlock managed before John was leaning down and biting hard on Sherlock’s neck. “FUCK!” Sherlock yelped but nodded as fast as he could, “I won’t move.”
I hope you guys enjoy this nice little email from our adorable, yet maybe not quite so innocent anymore, smol boy ♥ I had some difficulty figuring out what to write at this juncture, but I think it came out pretty well right? Let me know!
Something in Sherlock clicked, his focus snapping to where his and John’s hands were joined. He then looked up towards John, his face filled with worry and concern. His eyes continued to flick back and forth between the two points, words doing their best to dig their way out of Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock made a show of sulking as he pulled the covers down and sat up. The moment he swung his legs over the side of the bed John tapped the bedside clock and said, “five minutes. Milk, please.” Sherlock stomped the whole way into the kitchen and John just chuckled. What did he expect with their five minute rule? Just as the time was almost up Sherlock stomped back into the bedroom carrying a tray and sloshing tea over the edges of the two mugs.
John realized only a moment too late that he hadn’t been glancing out of his peripheral vision, but full on
If you’d like to read the letter but wish for details to be left out simply say so in a comment and blood and I will try and reply as quickly as we can (I’m at work so please allow me time)
“Come on? Come on what, you?” John laughed at his own joke and helped Sherlock divest himself of his jumper. Once it had been tossed halfway across the room Sherlock’s fingers flew to John’s jeans, however John was having none of it. “No, you first. God, get this…
“Consider it my Christmas present.” Sherlock grinned at the sour look on his brother’s face and reached for the bacon. “Sorry, Mycroft, mummy didn’t make scones for breakfast. But at least it has ‘cake’ in the name.”
Sherlock let out a needy groan, John's lips tasted of wine yet the deeper into John’s mouth his tongue went, the sweeter John tasted. Hints of frosting and cake exploded around Sherlock’s tastes buds. But it was the taste of
to think of any serious scenarios that could arise in their future that would hinge on Sherlock’s immediate and unclouded reaction, but suddenly his mind was full of them. These thoughts then lead to the possibility that John and himself may
“Cheeky bastard…” John began, but let out a soft “Oh!” as Sherlock leaned down and placed a sloppy kiss to John’s left arse cheek. Sherlock hummed in amusement and dragged his tongue over John’s cheek, down the crease of his arse, and began lapping circles around John’s hole as he slowly began working his husband open.
"Always." Sherlock purred and found himself arching his neck silently inviting John to continue with his kisses.
“It was… in a way, wasn’t it?” John rolled over and faced Sherlock. “I didn’t know… about Victor, and I didn’t go easy on you. In fact, I was a bit forward, then would pull back and tease you.”
John expected some sort of noise of exaltation, or at least an interested hum, but Sherlock’s eyes flitted over the screen as silence enveloped both of them. John waited until Sherlock had time to read the e-mail twice over before finally speaking.
Sherlock flashed John a filthy grin, all teeth, plush lips and that wicked tongue darting between his lips then scrambled to kneel, getting on all fours, in the space between their chairs. He wiggled his bum as John, for good measure, re-applied more lube then sank down on his on knees.
“Is that a challenge, John?” Sherlock's ears perked up in interest. He'd never quite seen a reason to go to university, had always found the thought dull and below his mental worth, but now? Now he felt like it just might be the very distraction he was looking for. Something to keep him busy, and clean, for the remainder of John’s tour, until his husband was finally back with him. “What would I study.”
“Mmm, he made his minions get me here. Didn’t see him until I got to the airport.” John piled his plate with food then smiled. “But that’s enough talk about your brother. Come on, let’s eat.”
“I'm taking him to see a friend of mine. Well, colleague. He was a professor of mine, back in medical school. One of the best neurosurgeons England has to offer. I've already arranged it with him.”
“None of those god awful experiments that stink up the whole place for weeks on end. Every once in awhile surprise him by bringing home the milk without being asked. And for heaven's sake, learn to wash the dishes. God know’s you’ll be eating off of paper when he leaves if you don’t.”
Sherlock listened as John shuffled about in the next room, the telltale sound of his duffle bag being opened and some of its contents removed. Sherlock made a mental note to suggest John properly unpack once they were done eating. There was a part of him that wondered if he should feel guilty for practically assaulting the man before he could settle in, however his mind then supplied him with the realization that John did in fact technically make the first move (and one honestly can not be expected to do nothing when given such a pleasant invitation) so if anyone was to be blamed for any late unpacking, it was obviously John.
"Mmmm." John hummed contently as he felt the bed dip around him and the head of Sherlock's cock pushing between his cheeks. Sherlock lowered himself into his forearms, pressing his lips against the nape of John's neck as he and John slowly became one.
After so much angst, hope your ready for some fluff and sweet tooth feels to use as balm for those wounds. We're in the final stretch now! Also, sorry for my absence the comment section. Just got over a nasty cold. I'm back to a hundred percent though so let's get it on! (not literally though cause that would be weird lol)
Sherlock took a timid sip of his tea, watching John as he swiftly brought all of his focus to his own beverage. In order to ease the growing tension, Sherlock decided to draw the attention away from them.
Sherlock drank in the sight, groaning as John lifted himself up a fraction of an inch then settled back down. John began making small movements, pulling off an inch here, two inches there, each time settling all the way back down on Sherlock before the next movement. After about two minutes of that slow blissful torture, Sherlock let out a grunt and brought his hips up to meet John’s.
NOTE: Sometimes links to pictures break: SO as this chapter is ALL pictures, I've also uploaded them to my tumblr, and you can view it there if you wish
"Try that again, soldier." John hissed into his ear as his hips snapped hard against him. His dog tags were cold and being pressed against Sherlock's lower back, causing Sherlock to groan.
John was beginning to realize that Sherlock’s tongue on his ear was his greatest weakness, and would earn his husband next to anything. John kissed the smirk off of Sherlock’s face and pushed him up, positioning Sherlock so his back was against the mattress. To John’s great surprise Sherlock needed little to no preparation. His first finger slipped in easily enough, and Sherlock wiggled, indicating he wanted a second one, then sighed in frustrating as John refused.
“Such a romantic,” John said as he blushed a brilliant shade of red. A laugh rang out and John turned to see Sherlock grinning from ear to ear, clearly pleased with John’s reaction. “Yours?” Sherlock asked, after a moment more of John blushing.
Sherlock sniffed with distaste at the mention of his brother. “Most likely one of his minions. My brother can't be bothered with such commonplace activities.”
Speaking of nudes. Do you know how alarming it is to enter your tent after a long day in surgery and find your commanding officer sprawled naked in your bed? No? Well, I do. It is very alarming. I didn't know if I should salute (Can't bring myself to stay “stand at attention” with a straight face anymore.) or if I should ask him if he’s got the wrong tent. Turns out, he misread my friendliness for flirting. And, as he's the Colonel, not many people turn him down, if you get my meaning.
“It’s alright, Mummy. I promise I’ll video chat as often as I can.” John gave Mummy’s hand a pat and took a sip of tea, noting how Sherlock seemed to straighten himself up from his sulk, if only a little.
“Yes, of course.” At the mention of John leaving, Mrs. Holmes glanced at her son. John had his back to them, and Sherlock let his shoulders sag and some of his smile faded. “Sherlock, you'll come visit your lonely mother now and then, won't you?”
“Mmm. Yes. Most people tend to be naked when they shower.” the shower curtain pulled back and John’s smiling face appeared. “You don’t have to, luv. But, it could be nice.” He disappeared again behind the curtain and soon the sound of water filled the small room quickly followed by a copious amount of steam. John’s form could just be made out through the partially translucent curtain and Sherlock found himself staring, straining hard to see with more clarity.
“Hardly difficult to guess, what with the way you ate my mother's baking all weekend,” With a flourish, Sherlock raced to the driver side of the car, a hand beckoning for John’s attention, “Keys, John, I know a shortcut.”
Again, before you go and complain (Comment..) that you can't see this on your phone, click the tumblr link.
“I wrote them, I hardly see why I can’t look at them.” Sherlock grinned and flopped down on the sofa with his back against the armrest, “Come read with me, John.”
“Hmmm…” John moaned out, licking his lips as Sherlock’s words sent a jolt of passion and pure want coursing through his body directly to his cock, which was now twitching in interest. The coarse texture of the towel doing absolutely
It didn’t take either of them much longer before they were pulling each other over the edge. John felt the familiar tug deep inside his groin. He had just enough wit left in him to mutter a warning to Sherlock before he was sending spurt after spurt of warm seed down Sherlock’s throat. John was so blissed out, that he hardly noticed when Sherlock twitched away, sending his come shooting over John’s face and getting it in his har. John collapsed on his back, chest heaving as he sucked in huge mouthfuls of air. He squeezed his eyes shut as the shift in position caused Sherlock’s come to slide from his cheek to the concave of his eye.
We are getting into the heart of this story, that little idea that sparked this huge monster of a fic. It is going to get dark. We will be adding all new tags both as ACTUAL tags, and here in the beginning notes. (And writing any tags that apply to the newly posted chapter)
The smile that was currently taking up Sherlock’s own features threatened to expand even further when John looked up at him. Part of him seriously believed all of this was some drug induced dream, and he would soon wake up back in his room in rehab. Or maybe everything up to this point wasn't real. Maybe he overdosed and is currently lying in a coma somewhere or even dead. Either way, Sherlock was comfortable, he was content, dare he say actually happy.
“So… it’s official, for real this time?” He read over the marriage certificate, the one he and Sherlock had signed just two days ago, and glanced from his husband to his brother-in-law.
“You’ll stay in touch, and let us know if you’re eating enough? We’ll send you care packages whenever you need them.”
I think in the next chapter I’m gonna skip forward a week or so. Maybe two. Have the boys do something domestic like? Maybe go to the zoo or If you guys can think of something more fun to write about lol.
Sherlock chuckled as he stepped away and continued their leisurely walk toward the nearest populated area. It took all of his willpower to pull himself away, however he knew that the quicker they arrived and purchased what they needed, the sooner they could get to what Sherlock truly wanted to occupy his and John’s time with.
“Yes, well.” Sherlock’s deep baritone caressed John’s entire body with a fire that was both dangerously alluring and overwhelming, even for the most disciplined individual. “I’m not sure… I could handle a second wager with you. We’ve yet to complete our first bet.” John involuntarily tilted his head to the side and shuddered as Sherlock’s teeth grazed over his throat.
It was short, I'm sorry. But again, ideas are more than helpful. They'll keep me going while my brain gets used to writing again!
“That good, was I?” Sherlock rolled over onto his side to better see John and pushed a sweaty curl off his forehead.
“Good morning, John.” The clacking stopped long enough for Sherlock to lean over and press a kiss to John’s forehead.
that he had married a man. Not that he had anything against marrying a man, but here they were, matching rings, groping for each other in the privacy of some little used study, and he was leaving. Tomorrow. His thumb began moving slower as he tried to catalog how Sherlock's stubble felt under his thumb, the way Sherlock's eyes were beginning to glisten with the first signs of arousal, the sounds his husband made as their bodies grew closer seemingly on their own accord.
“Shirt too. There’s no need for my little cock whore to be wearing clothes.” John flicked his wrist impatiently then began languidly stroking himself as Sherlock fumbled with the buttons of his dress shirt. Once Sherlock was fully undressed John stepped over to him, took him by the wrist, and lead him back to the table.
While I am not a fan of thievery, you have my full support should you wish to pick pocket your brother as payback. It seems, however, we are both victims to theft. In my office yesterday, I had just taken your picture out of my wallet to look at it, (Nothing more, I swear.) when Moran cocked his head to the side and pointed to where it was laying on my desk. He asked who you were, and I jokingly said my Nan as I pocketed it. He didn't find that particularly funny... and it was later that night while eating two men "jokingly" tackled me and pulled your picture out of my pocket.
Sherlock mumbled something and watched as John scooted around him and exited the bathroom, still only wearing a towel around his hips.
I would just like to note that these emails used are in no way related to us so please, refrain from actually sending an email to them.
“Not even covertly, and quite secretly, get me here just in time for Christmas for a four day Holiday. Alone. Together?” John reached out to hand Sherlock his tea, his eyes fluttered shut as their fingers touched around the warm mug. They stood there, fingers entwined around the mug, for a long while. John pulled away first, clearing his throat and reaching back for his own mug.
Back to letters on Monday, B is just having a rough/long week at uni and couldn't find time for an actual letter.
Mr. Holmes sniffed, and even without looking up from the flowers in front of him, John knew the man was on the verge of tears. John stood, cleared his throat and sucked on his bleeding thumb for a brief moment before gesturing to the table of flowers. “Think I’ll open a window… allergies and such…” Mr. Holmes nodded gratefully and together they fell back into a comfortable silence as they worked.
“Oh?” John gave Sherlock a very mater-of-fact look and stepped under Sherlock’s outstretched arms to turn the water on. “Would you like to make a bet?”
“Shitttt….” John swore as his hips bucked, pushing his cock deeper down Sherlock’s throat. “Sherlock, luv… Turn around. I need too..” Sherlock looked up and gave John a confused look, not comprehending what John was trying to say. “Head facing my feet, dick by my mouth, hurry.” John shimmied down lower on the bed and helped manhandle Sherlock into the right position. The second his cock was within reach of John’s lips, he lunged. Sherlock let out a broken sob as he took John’s length back into his mouth, effectively gagging himself on John’s cock.
John gently took hold of Sherlock’s hips with both hands and pulled his waist down until their mutual erections were pressed against each other. Sherlock made the first move; he rolled his hips down hard letting out a series of not-so-quiet whimpers that burned through John like wild fire. John kept a strong hold on Sherlock’s hips and pushed up, his groan matching the intensity of Sherlock’s whimpers as their clothed cocks slid against each other.
“Of course, dear. If you haven’t noticed we are all a bit frank in this family. What with my two sons not having filters. They just say whatever is on their mind.”
“Not precisely. I need to think, smoking helps me think but it’s illegal to smoke nearly anywhere around here. You clearly hate it, so sending you out into the fresh air for a bit will do us both a favour.
"Hmm." John hummed and pretended to deeply ponder his answer. He then wrapped his arms around Sherlock. "Think my place is here.  Wouldn't you agree?"
John, using a tissue on himself, laughed and rolled his eyes, “don't tell me you’re going to make your mother do you wash?”
I will say, you continue to surprise me John Watson. I have to say I am quite thankful that my letter found itself into your hands instead of one of the other soldiers stationed in the surrounding area. Otherwise, I believe I would have found myself leaving my prison of solitude much sooner than anticipated and under much different circumstances. Namely a body bag, as I would have ended my life to avoid the pain of having to converse with such idiocy on a regular basis.
We are getting into the heart of this story, that little idea that sparked this huge monster of a fic. It is going to get dark. We will be adding all new tags, both as ACTUAL tags, and here in the beginning notes. (And writing any tags that apply to the newly posted chapter)
“Right then…” he cleared his throat and looked around the table, adding truthfully. “Everything looks stunning.”
“Why midnight? Will your clothing turn into rags?” Sherlock grinned and expertly maneuvered the jeep through the gate and over the bumpy terrain.
Sherlock honestly couldn't remember the last time he had allowed himself such a sizeable amount of food, to actually sit and enjoy something and it not be an afterthought. Deciding that John’s mention of a walk sounded quite favourable, Sherlock immediately scooped up their dirty plates and deposited them into the sink, before maneuvering himself quickly toward the front door.
“Mmm, cheers.” John nodded and clinked their glasses together before taking a small sip.”Christ, that is delicious wine.”
“Yes, that one.” Sherlock nodded and lowered himself until his head was in John’s lap, his torso facing the setting sun. “After our phone call, I sat and cried. I cried because I desperately wanted you. To hold you, to be held by you, just to sit and talk with you. My father caught me crying, and you know what, John, he never once believed I was crying because you were angry with me. He somehow knew, knew that I was missing you, that your kindness was why I was crying.”
“All the more reason tonight’s on the house! Bit of a celebration then!” Angelo clapped Sherlock on the back and gave John a warm smile.
“So…” John cleared his throat after a while, “allergies. I’m deathly allergic to sulfa, It’s listed on my dog tags, which I wear daily while on duty. As a civilian, I’ll go back to wearing one of those metal medical bracelets. I’ve got one in my stuff that’s at Harry’s. Hmm, what else… Oh, I’ve got a standing DNR,” Sherlock looked confused so, John clarified, “Do not resuscitate…I’ll change that, now that I’ve got you. But you’ve got to promise that if it’s a choice of keeping me alive as a vegetable or letting me go… Sweetheart lets me go. I don't’ want to be alive if I’m not me.”
He almost reached for his jumper at that point, thinking to pull it on before he froze to death. But he was enjoying this, enjoying Sherlock’s look of wonder and how his jaw was hanging open ever so slightly. Deciding to go for the full effect, he pulled open his belt then reached for his flies, but stopped and caught Sherlock’s eyes.
“Mmmm.” Sherlock agreed, then let out a sigh as John's arms came up to wrap around him. They lapsed into silence, listening to the other breath, both content, warm, and sated.
“My thoughts exactly,” Suddenly Sherlock removed himself from John’s space and stepped under the shower head, immersing himself under the cascade of water. He reached over and retrieved the bottle of shampoo from one of the shelves before lathering a rather large dollop between his palms, “Except I rather believe you will be the only one getting their arse beat.”
John watched as Sherlock appeared to be briefly lost to thought and had to fight the urge to reach out and touch the man. Every part of him screamed to touch, feel, taste, smell. But there was a small warning bell in the back of his mind, telling him, “Not yet.” so he stepped back and looked around the room, nodding in the direction of what he assumed to be the kitchen.
They worked in silence after that, shuffled awkwardly together to get plates and mugs, sharing a quick giggle as they moved about the kitchen. John finally let go, just before the bacon was ready, to pour the tea. Then together they sat at the table to eat, letting their lazy Sunday morning start with shared smiles.
Also, this chapter marks our big one zero zero! One hundred chapters! *blows noisemaker* We're actually nearing what could be considered the "climax" of the fic (pun intended lol)
“Oh, you’ll see. I’ve got one more idea that I’m saving for after the bath.” John returned the wink and together they made their way back home.
that the noises he was making were desperate sobs as he wordlessly begged for more, but he couldn’t find it in himself to be even remotely embarrassed.
First please let me apologize for my tardiness. For the past 8 days I have either been ill, or tending to the rest of the base. A day after your brother left, a rather nasty bout of the flu tore its way through the ranks, and it was all hands on deck. (So to speak.) I spent three days in bed getting rather well acquainted with the inside of a mop bucket. Then, the moment I stopped throwing up my help was required in the hospital to help those who had gotten it worse than I.
“Grab the bag, John! I’ve got this!” Sherlock picked up the basket and took a few backwards steps while John fished the bag out of the backseat. The walk down to the river took them ten minutes, which they filled with idle chatter and flirty glances. Eventually, when they reached a suitable spot for a picnic,  Sherlock stopped walking and placed the basket down then took the bag from John. He made John stand back as he pulled a lavender blanket out of the bag and spread it out, taking care to remove any rocks from underneath. Once the blanket was laid out Sherlock placed the basket off to a corner and turned to look at his husband.
“Damit, you’re making it incredibly hard to stay mad at you.” John leaned forward again, resting his arms on his knees as he bent forward, closing the little bit of space between them in one motion. “Still, you snuck out, Sherlock. What if something had happened to you on your way here? Oh wait, let me guess. Some sort of failsafe, a text you had to delete before it auto sent, or an email saved? Damnit, what if you had missed out anniversary …. Shit… Sherlock… It’s our… anniversary!”  John checked his watch and nodded, “For… another 20 minutes.”
Again Sherlock nodded, this time adding a small whimper as John stepped away, his warmth against Sherlock’s back leaving in his absence and he chuckled as Sherlock visibly shivered.
“The Beret? Mmmm yes.” John pursed his lips and attempted to hide just how much he was enjoying Sherlock’s reaction.
.” He then moved so he was standing less than an inch behind John and leaned his long torso around John to snatch up his toothbrush.
However, we will be making sure that its one screen shot at a time for you guys, if you go back 2 chapters, I've already fixed it.  : )
“Excellent, Rhodes. Be sure to let the General know how little Colonel Sebastian Moran cared about solving this and finding these women. I too will be making a report about his abhorrence treatment of this case and those women.” Then, with very little fanfare, Sherlock hung up and placed the phone down on the table.
“Cut through all the red tape, if you will, thus making it official in every sense of the words. I’ve even forwarded the proper documentation to your new base. When you arrive you’ll just need to sign a few things, get your name fixed on your uniforms, and it’ll all be right as rain.”
Oh shit, fucking hate that this is an afterthought, but happy anniversary darling. One year ago today I received your first letter. You snarky bastard, don't ever change.
“We can at least make it memorable,” he suggested, picking up the bottle of lube and holding it out to John who took it and let a slow smile tug his lips upwards.
“Stop.” John shook his head and gave Sherlock’s hand a shake. “Stop thinking like that. You’ll be busier than you think.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock nodded his agreement and slowly rocked his hips. He didn’t pull out or thrust, he just kept slowly rocking his hips. “This is… enough…” he squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and gave a start when something wet dripped onto his abdomen. Thinking John had come already he looked down, only to find his husband with a look of complete ecstasy on his face, and a slow but steady stream of clear precome dripping from his cock.
“Me too, God, me too.” Sherlock was rewarded with a shower of kisses that trailed from his ear to his collarbone. “I mean, it makes sense, logically, as well. The army is good to military spouses, if.. something were to happen to me, you'd be taken care of, and the first to know. Probably would know even before Harry. Plus there are some reassurances in it for you. The military doesn't take kindly to adultery.”

“Yes, I can cook.” John laughed as he rolled himself out of bed. “I’ll leave you to finish changing then. Think I need a new pair of pants as well. God, please tell me we can do the wash here.”
John couldn’t help himself, he reached out and ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls and nodded. His eyes fluttered shut as his fingers carded through Sherlock’s still damp hair. God, his mouth was right
explaining that love bite on your neck to Molly!” With that John turned on his heels and darted out of the morgue, leaving behind a bewildered Sherlock who was now gingerly touching the back of his neck and grimacing.
Your excitement caused the biggest grin I've had since coming to this hell hole to capture my face until it hurt. I wish I were there, with you in person, listening to you describe the habits of bees. I don’t doubt that you’d be able to tell me how those habits vary from species to species. I know little about bees or gardens, but I love how excited it makes you. Why don't you talk to Mike, perhaps you can start a small garden in the courtyard? From the pictures online (yes, I googled it) the courtyard looks quite lovely, but lacking in colour.
“That was… god… the best… Jesus… Sherlock, I…” his next words slipped out of his mouth before he had time to think, with his lips pressed to the side of Sherlock's neck he whispered, “I love you.” Sherlock's body immediately tensed and John heard him take a sharp breath in, afraid that Sherlock was about to panic and bolt, John simply continued kissing, wherever his lips could reach, neck, shoulder, ears, face, head, it didn't matter. He needed Sherlock to know.
"Are you close?" The head of John's cock slammed into Sherlock's prostate, making the younger man scream his answer.
“Mrs. Holmes....” John began, watching as Sherlock rolled his eyes and practically stomped out of the kitchen.
“Probably someone for Mrs. H?” he asked. Sherlock started to nod but stopped mid-nod as their landlady's voice carried up the stairs with a polite “This way, he’s just up the stairs and through the door. Knock first though, he’s newly married you know.”
Speaking of Halloween parties, I was actually invited to one. It was some huge elaborate affair put together by Sebastian Wilkes and his family. I say his family, however his parents would not be there. Something about a last minute business trip. I just got back a couple hours ago...I wasn’t planning on going but the lunch gatherings had been going alright, and you and Dr. Nikiforov had been pushing for me to get involved in things outside of University, so I went. Apparently, a costume was mandatory so I went with Edgar Allan Poe. You would be proud to know I even bought a stuffed raven to bring with me.
They stood in Mycroft's private hangar, with his small jet parked outside on the tarmac. Sherlock had both his hands stuffed in his coat pockets, while John's hands twitched by his side. They stood looking at the plane, shoulder to shoulder, and neither spoke for what felt like ages. John broke the silence first by clearing his throat. Still looking at the plane he said,
Sherlock stopped mid type to turn his full attention of the man lying next to him, the man who was willingly sharing not only himself, but his entire life. Sherlock still wasn’t sure if he deserved such a thing, or if he ever would, but he knew that he in no way wanted to give any of it up.
John did not disappoint. He gave Sherlock exactly what he asked for, thrusting so hard and fast inside him that the desk began to slide across the floor, it's legs leaving scratches on the wooden floor as they fucked. A series of cat calls could be heard just outside the window, as a man, or possible two, listened to their Captain and his husband. John broke out grinning and let out a groan as Sherlock let out a cry, screaming for it harder and faster.
Heavy footsteps made their way up the stairs and a man in a black knee-length coat paused at the open door.
Bringing his focus back to the present, Sherlock noticed John was giving him a slightly concerned look mixed with some form of trepidation. Did he do something wrong? Maybe he was being too overzealous. After all, handholding was supposed to be a natural thing couples did right? Sherlock suddenly stopped in his forward motion, biting his lip and looked away in embarrassment. He quickly removed his hand from John’s and buried both of them in his the front pocket of his hoodie.
“And you...enjoyed that?” Sherlock whispered, not daring to look up to see what John’s face looked like.
“It’s alright, luv. I’ve got you. I’ll take good care of you.” John picked up the riding crop and looked around, double checking that they were indeed alone, then took four large backwards steps.
