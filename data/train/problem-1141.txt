“And you decided it would be a good idea to confront him alone, in his own flat.” John’s voice was tense with rising anger.

are staying here.
Caustlin broke off as Tyler shoved his chair back, jumped to his feet and made a break for the door. Sherlock, already standing, managed to get to the door in front of him while John and Lestrade were still getting up.  The teen threw a punch at Sherlock’s face.  Untrained and sloppy, it would have done little damage on its own, but there was enough force behind it to knock Sherlock’s head against the door frame with an audible
No answer, although a quick glance upwards showed him that Sherlock was still there.
“Your lot certainly fell for it.”
As a former soldier, John could recognize a losing battle. He settled in himself with the newspaper he hadn’t had a chance to read that morning.  More rhetoric – although little actual news – about the divorce laws.  South Africa and Australia were reported to be on the verge of changing their laws as well.  Canada already had.  An op-ed piece declared it highly unlikely that the States would follow suit any time soon due to the number of American politicians who drew their support from right-wing religious groups.  John thought of Campbell-Williams and set the piece aside for Sherlock.
“You’ve met him.  How many ‘friends’ do you imagine he has?  I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.”
John paused in the act of getting himself some tea. “Which beds?”
“I need a power source,” the creature announced suddenly.  His wings flexed, feathers rustling, in an apparently unconscious display of impatience.  He too began to circle the room, picking up and discarding bits and pieces of things, until he came face to face with Ivan.  The silver eyes narrowed.
“I wanted him to pick
As predicted, the crossing was stormy.  Almost all of the company were ill at one time or another, and poor Andreyev never did gain his sea legs.  The exceptions were Nadya and Rada, who could be found on deck in all but the stormiest weather, watching the sailors go about the work of the ship with great interest.  Ivan observed that the second mate seemed to take special care of them, often bringing them mugs of hot tea and stopping to talk awhile with Nadya.
“I may have been misinformed.”
“The man’s officers couldn’t have been too happy about that.”
“Because John can’t ever know that I lied to him,” Mary said grimly, her gun still in her hand.
For one horrible moment, he fell freely, the wind whistling past his ears as his stomach made a good attempt to climb into his throat.  In the next moment, something changed.  Something
! Yeah.”
“To flirt with. And tease.” John ducked his chin a little to look up at Sherlock through his lashes. “And you’ve never found the right partner.”
Harrieta darted out of an alley, almost directly in front of him.  “Are you happy, Vanya?  Be honest!”  She dashed across the street and vanished down another alley, the nursemaids close on her heels.
He turned back towards the living room to find two knowing pairs of silver-blue eyes watching him.
“He’s lucky you were able to forgive him,” said Sherlock seriously.
John grabbed one of his newly purchased books and answered the flat door book in hand, a finger poked in among the pages as if to mark his place.
Dexter glanced at his watch. “Uh, Janine?”
that?” John fumbled for his clothes.
“Sherlock?” asked Ivan quietly.  He felt Sherlock’s back move as the creature took a deep breath.
“The geniuses are at it again,” said Mr Holmes with a wink at John. He settled in with one of John’s novels and at some point in the afternoon, fell asleep over it.
“I cleared it a
“What, exactly, are you suggesting that I resist?”
John nodded, trying to steady his breathing.
Remembering his own childhood in his father’s court, Ivan nodded.
“I don’t doubt it,” said John, amused despite himself.
“And Lestrade?”
“Are you going to let me finish?”
“Nice to be going home, isn’t it?  Your drink, sir.”
The pair were already out of sight by the time he exited the pub, so they couldn’t have gone far before turning off the street.  A muffled noise to John’s left led him to the mouth of a narrow alley.  Further down, two tall dark shapes struggled together.  Light from a window flashed off something metal.  A knife blade, John realized.  The killer had been holding a knife to Sherlock’s side as they left the pub.  If John charged into the fray, he’d almost certainly get Sherlock stabbed.
want to do this.  But he held the case against his chest with one hand and used the other to steady his sheathed sword against his thigh.  He whispered a brief prayer to whatever gods might be listening.  And then, trying to throw himself as far out from the tower walls as possible, he jumped.
. Gypsy, in French. The work doesn’t use any authentic Romani melodies, though. It’s written in what Ravel perceived to be the general style of such melodies.”
“Always something,” murmured Sherlock.
Lestrade’s eyebrows went up.  “How d’you know there’s other cases?”
“So,” John began, “I’ve seen people – alphas and omegas – wearing these, ah, things.” He gestured at his own chest. “Carriers. For babies.”
Right, but that hadn’t stopped the two pieces of toasted cheese that John had placed next to Sherlock last evening from vanishing.  There was, of course, a chance that they’d ended up under the sofa.  John’d had a girlfriend for awhile whose cat had disposed of unwanted food that way.  He’d check under the sofa later, but in the meantime he’d make extra toast.
Sherlock shrugged.  “If you think so.  You’d might as well go to bed now.”
“Yes, it was,” came the mumbled reply.
“Yeah, that’s probably because you’re
“So in your opinion, Mr Consulting Detective, what exactly constitutes a date?”
“The only reason I would invite Bill Wiggins to my parents’ house would be if... Oh!” Sherlock brightened. “I could have him serve everyone punch laced with knockout drugs so that I could abscond with Mycroft’s laptop!”
with John bleeding Watson, she cursed
“I haven’t seen that these woods are so populated that’s likely to happen any time soon.  Either I’ll retrieve the bundle before anyone else finds it or I’ll likely be dead, in which case they’re welcome to it,” Ivan replied cheerfully.
“Unfortunately, he’s dead. Someone shot him,” retorted Mycroft, glancing at John.
“The mobile numbers are different for each message,” John noted.  “Are they codes?”
“John, wake up and put some clothes on!”
“George,” a woman hissed as she held her children close.  “George, come on.  Let’s get on the bus.  We’ll sort it out later.”
John would have guessed as much from the large desk that dominated the room.
should have got married.”
“When the police arrived, the first thing they had to do was to get people off the beach, as the tide was coming in.”
“I’ve got a team on the way, Sherlock, can’t you hold on until they get here?”
John held her a bit more closely for reassurance. “Absolutely none. Never mind him, love. My point is that aside from that fluke, Molly, well, for the longest time she had a desperate crush on Sherlock.”
,” repeated Sherlock, and clarified his meaning by reaching for the front of Ivan’s trousers.  At first his grip was awkward and his rhythm jerky, but he accepted Ivan’s guidance willingly and became more proficient with surprising speed, improvising new twists and slides that drove Ivan higher and higher until his wings melted in the sun and he tumbled back to earth, crying out Sherlock’s name as he fell.
“Give me Mycroft’s number,” Lestrade offered promptly. “I’ve got a badge
could have produced this effect.”  He turned and vanished down into the basement.
After examining the corpse for a moment, John shook his head.  “No obvious signs of foul play.  If it were medically possible to die of fright, I would say that this woman has done so.”
Bill also stood, less steadily.  “Good luck, John.  You’re a good man.”
“No, he went out somewhere.  I’ll tell him you came by.”
“Put these in your refrigerator when you get home, won’t you, dear? Sherlock’s always been this way. Special occasions made him too nervous to eat, but he’d sneak into the kitchen at night afterwards and help himself to the leftovers.”
From where he stood, Ivan had a clearer view of the dancing slaves.  They wore flowing, brightly coloured robes.  Their long hair – and the men’s long beards, for three of them were men – sparkled with jewels in the sunlight.  Yet they moved wearily, gracelessly, often stumbling.
“Poorly observed, John. Molly Hooper’s not one to hold a grudge. No, leave that the way I put it.”
This was how John ended up having breakfast in 221A along with Mrs Hudson, her niece, Marie Turner, and Marie’s three children: Billy, 16, Archie, 12, and Octobria-called-Toby, 10.
“Devil’s foot root,” said John, remembering his medical Latin.  “So... the victims follow the killer into a room, the killer seals the room shut and lights up a piece of root and the victims just sit there?  Why do they follow the killer in the first place?”
need to make tea, to go through the familiar ritual of making tea. You need to calm down and get yourself together, Watson. You’ve got a pregnant, fugitive assassin standing in your flat and the child is yours. Yelling isn’t going to solve anything.
“There’s something else that should be obvious, but I’m going to say it anyway. Mary had no business saying what she did. This isn’t going to be her family. Her opinion doesn’t count.”
“Hello?”
“You may want to try looking for someone who’s noticeable not for the degree to which they themselves shine but rather as a conductor of light.”
Sherlock had bought him a mobile phone?  That was... unexpectedly considerate.  And unless British etiquette was quite different from Canadian in this regard, it wasn’t the kind of gift one would buy for a casual acquaintance who was only staying a few days.
“Look, I don’t recall you being present when...”
“A context involving no hormones but our own.”
“Sherlock.  His heart.  I don’t know how, but – Sara, he’s
“No,” replied Sherlock curtly. “Hmmm, almost all the media stories showed close-ups of the Cherni Kucheta tattoo. Anyone could have seen it, but it’s relatively intricate and would be difficult to execute by someone untrained.”
Lestrade closed his eyes briefly and appeared to be counting backwards from ten, but Caustlin answered steadily enough. “It was done surgically.  I was only a few years old at the time.  My mother – his older sister – told me later that he had some sort of bone disease but that it wasn’t hereditary.”
“...come to talk to you about... Dr Watson. Good day. Perhaps you have somewhere else to be.”
The passengers were met by a fleet of buses with signs for various destinations, a portly middle-aged man with a clipboard, several smiling young assistants, a baggage crew and, off to one side, six armed... security guards?  Except that they looked more to John’s eye like soldiers.
“Oh, right! Yeah, you would. Except... You’re the kind of person who seems like he knows about lots of different things whether he actually does or not.”
“Possibly. Tell me, John, how did Mary get in?”
“Pheromones?” offered Lestrade. Both John and Campbell-Williams turned to stare at him.  “I read this magazine article...”
“Correct. However, my point is that in
, gentlemen.  But our work here will produce proven facts, not just guesses but
“Keep up, John. How did you think I’d managed it?”
John laughed.  “No, I meant the details.”
Instead, John sat back and enjoyed watching Mycroft and his birthmum bicker amiably with each other.
“Where were you anyway?” he asked over his shoulder.
, but close.  I had some admiration for him.  He had married, he was to be a father, he had lost both his wife and child.  Myself, I was still a graduate student, just beginning my career.  He seemed to me to be more...  more completely an adult than I had managed to become.”  Foucault gave a dry chuckle.  “The fancies of young men, eh?”
,” Sherlock snarled.  Then he threw the mobile at John, who was still mostly asleep and managed to catch it on pure reflex.
John shook his head.
“Why did you do that, Tyler?” Lestrade asked gently.
buying synthetic hormones on the black market and dosing yourself! It’s bad enough that we have to improvise without proper medical care for Mary...”
“Trust Sherlock to rediscover courtesy when it’s convenient for him,” muttered John.
John was about to protest that there was nothing wrong with his clothes until he realized something.  The dark suit that Sherlock was wearing was the first finely tailored item of clothing John had seen since landing in the UBR.
Sherlock ignored her. “I told you this would happen, John. Mrs Hudson did what people always do. She observed a bare fraction of the available details, made up a hypothesis and then instead of
“Okay, then,
This was, by Sherlock’s standards, fairly considerate, and John’s first sip proved the scotch to be decent enough. “Tell me why we’re interested in tall and ginger,” he proposed, keeping his voice down.
“Mary will take extra milk,” called Sherlock from the living room. “And have we got any biscuits?”
And he’d done it. Sherlock had reached out past old anger and old pain to tell the entire miserable story from beginning to end, so that John might understand the complications involved in being in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock had laid everything out for John to hear and John...  In the end, it hadn’t been a choice, really.  It had been more like recognition of the place they’d always been heading towards.
like you.”
“He should be in for at least a week. I had them put him in a room as far above the ground as possible.”
“Sherlock Holmes!” Mrs Hudson rose to her feet.
They sat there in silence awhile. Finally Sherlock indicated the skull on the mantel piece.  “That’s Victor’s.”
“Dobrieuzi,” insisted John from the kitchen.
“But you made sure he was taking them all, right?” Caustlin asked her son, breaking the focus between him and Sherlock.
“Thanks to the betas, apparently,” Mary added with a wink at John. “It’s this theory Sherlock’s got.”
“Hey, that’s not what I’m upset about.” John sat up as well, taking Sherlock’s wrist and tracing the line of Sherlock’s wristband with one hand.  “I
Sherlock snuffled into his pillow, and John stopped himself from reaching to stroke the dark curls.  The boy John had met 14 years ago had grown into a man, and the man, however gorgeous and brilliant, was married to his work.
“Appreciation!  Applause!”  Grinning, Sherlock emphasized his words with sweeps of his long arms.  One hand still held a scalpel with bits of liver on it.  “At long last the spotlight.  That’s the frailty of genius, John: it needs an audience.”
“Janine.”
“That’s up to the magistrate. In your favour, you’ll be tried as a youth and it’s your first offence.  The charge will likely be criminal damage but not aggravated criminal damage.  It’s possible that the magistrate will accept that you were largely an accessory to the crime rather than an active perpetrator.”
Now Sherlock led John the bed, rummaged in the nightstand for the lube. The first time they’d tried this, he’d used far too much lube. After an excess of preparation that had every hair on John’s body standing on end, he’d finally slid in – and promptly slid right back out.
“That I don’t.  I tossed it down a sewer grate when I realized the copper was going to nab me.  And I had to leave my overshoes behind a bin, so I need new ones.  Not that I ever wear ‘em, but Aunt Martha will be cheesed if I have to tell her I lost ‘em.”
“Any particular countries?” asked Sherlock with mild interest.
“Janine?”
By the time John had escaped upstairs, found homes for his new books and browsed through several trying to decide which to read first, the afternoon was well past.  Something light for supper, he thought, so he made himself an omelet.  For once he could understand Sherlock’s refusal to eat anything, but Sherlock was a civilian through and through.  John had been a soldier and had learned to eat and sleep when he could.
“Sorry about that, Mrs...”
“John, we must be going.  David, so lovely to meet you.”
When they arrived at the docks, Ivan was glad not to have spent gold on wagon rides.  It was late in the shipping season, and the captains were reluctant to set forth.  It took almost all the gold and jewels Ivan carried to convince one of them to provide the company with passage home.
Ivan cursed Muircheartaigh’s lies and straightened his shoulders, one hand on his sword hilt.
“...and you’re not inclined to celibacy, but you returned to the UBR alone.  Balance of probability says that over the course of eight years you’ve lost at least one serious girlfriend or boyfriend, causing the ‘period of stress’ you mentioned.  But no marks on your finger from a wedding ring, not even the hint of a tan line, so, not married.”
“Thank you,” Ivan said as he jogged to catch up.
“Sherlock?”
John continued to stroke his hair.
“John, your loyalty is the very core of your being. Even if I’d walked you through every detail that I’d seen, if I’d drawn the pattern the details made, even if I’d done all that, you wouldn’t have been
“Someone you knew?”
Lestrade chuckled. “Sounds like a pretty definitive opinion. So he’s doing all the nursing?”
“You’re 34 with a shoulder injury,” Sherlock replied petulantly.
“You don’t want to make yourselves ill,” Sara confirmed.  She held her own piece of bread in both hands and took small, precise bites, setting an example for the others to follow.
work and often as not he’s able to put them back together as well.  Between us, we managed well enough.  You should have seen him flying about the roof, patching the holes and cleaning out the gutters!”
seven, thank you very much.) He’d do a few extra miles on his bike tomorrow.
“Stop maligning my brain cells,” John muttered against Sherlock’s flushed skin. “It’s different

“You heard him, at our wedding, with that vow of his. He’s practically married us already. Maybe not, well, in a sexual way or even a romantic way, but as

“Yuh-ess. Yes.”
“I’ll just...” He waved a hand towards his bedroom. “Be in there.”
“Glad to hear it.” John sounded grumpy and knew it.

done by pro-bonders.”  They all turned to look at the blonde woman.  The man who’d been standing beside her was now gone.  “You wouldn’t believe the phone calls and e-mails my colleagues and I have been receiving.  Nasty, threatening things.  We’ve been reporting them as they come in, but it took
Ivan shrugged.  “I suspected it.  But I was also helping people who’d offered to help me.  It seemed fair enough.”
, like a grappling hook finding purchase on a wall.  Something held his weight as he floated gently to the ground several yards out from the tower walls.
When it became apparent that Mary’s latest absence was stretching beyond the usual, John hadn’t known whom to call. Sherlock, he thought, and then imagined himself sitting on the sofa like a client, yet one more client with a failing marriage and a vanished spouse.  In the end, he called Greg Lestrade, who listened with kind professionalism and promised to call him back as soon as anything was known.  It was only after John had hung up that it occurred to him that Sherlock would at least have conscripted him to help.
“Seems to be a long list, as far as I can tell. I keep following leads and then having them vanish. Or get cut off.”
“Completely. I’ve carried two – in my pouch, of course – and it’s like they’re part of you. I don’t think either of my spouses would have gone for wearing a carrier themselves, though.
“And this is the first time in almost a month that you’ve spoken to me!”
John thought of the past 14 years.  “Of course, yes,” he replied quietly.  “Enough for a lifetime.  Far too much.”
“Boring.”
John, looking expectantly towards the door of the house, didn’t immediately notice as the sulky and reluctant boy approached.
“Still on a case,” replied Sherlock promptly.
“She could, but when’s the last time we actually did?”
amazing.”
“The police were too slow,” Sherlock croaked. “He’d’ve escaped if I hadn’t got hold of him.”
But Sherlock merely shrugged.  “It will be convenient for me to have a way to contact you.”
John had one hand firmly planted across Sherlock’s mouth and the other holding Sherlock’s arm behind his back, with Sherlock’s free arm pinned between them. Sherlock first tried to twist away and then tried to kick him.
“Octobria’s a pretty and unusual name,” he noted.
“John, we both know there have been times in the past...”
to hit him, but he’d almost broken the man’s nose the night Sherlock returned from the dead. It was time for someone else to have a go, and manhandling corpses had obviously done nice things for Molly’s upper body strength.
“Dr Campbell-Williams will not be happy,” Sherlock commented in an offhand tone.
“Well, he laid a hand on it.  He didn’t manage to pull it off.  He said it felt like leather, and it was light-coloured, not black or brown.”
“That’s mine, thanks,” said John, holding out his hand. “Yours is, for some reason, on top of the refrigerator.”
“No.” And Sherlock smiled like a flower opening. “If it’s all the same to you, I’d rather we took
“Harry...”

“That felt like lying,” said Tyler miserably. Miranda hugged him again.  John took the opportunity to kick Sherlock’s ankle lightly.  Tyler didn’t need a genius puncturing holes in his adolescent logic.
I decide to date again for my
“Tyler, shut up!” yelled Caustlin.
Lestrade complied, wrestling the wooden door into place against the slightly warped frame but shaking his head when John made a motion to help.
“What did you mean by that?” demanded John, using his cane to stand up as well.  “Sherlock, what’s he on about?”
“I thought you said he was already dead when they got here.”
Sherlock’s mouth moved as if trying to shape a word.
“John, I sincerely doubt that your wife intended to start her day with a visit to a crack house, followed by a spot of impromptu nursing at St Bart’s. Perhaps you ought to head home and attend to her well-being.”
them.”
joking when he told me that!” protested Mrs Hudson.
Andrew had married off Harry first.  Then he’d arranged a marriage for John.
And so it went.  Alphabetical group by alphabetical group, passengers were assigned to buses.  The only break in the pattern came when, at irregular intervals, one particular individual, couple or family was told to board the London bus.
The man chuckled.  “Ah, yes. The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think?”  He looked at John sternly.  “What are your intentions regarding Sherlock Holmes?”
“Who’d want to shoot Magnussen?”
“Sherlock,” he called, “Do you want some leftover breakfast?  There’s a wedge of cheese as well.”
Sherlock shrugged. “The papers were highly informative.  I was impressed with the logic and clarity of Dobrieuzi’s deductions.  Also,” Sherlock’s eyes took on a sly glint, “my parents were not my only source.”
John rounded on him. “Wait, you did what?”
He could be kind. He could be caring. He’d cared enough about John (and Lestrade and Mrs Hudson) to jump off a building and spend two years hunting down Moriarty’s network.
“By the morning of Victor’s birthday, I had the results I needed. I cleaned up the lab, returned the rats and then took my supply of the modified drug back to my room, where I attached a note to Victor suggesting that we try it together that evening.  I took the package to his room, but he’d already left for classes.  I slipped it under his pillow and went on to my own classes.”
“Erm, well, ah...  Of course, I’ll tell them.”

caused the night you betrayed me to your brother’s guards.”
“My wife said we should run.  Her brother lived in a town far away and would shelter us.  But the lord’s guards caught us at the gates.  The lord said he would keep my wife as surety for my return, then had his guards throw me out.”
“Hand me the case, Sherlock,” said Ivan in a low voice as he sheathed his sword.  “Keep your eyes on Muircheartaigh, but reach back and hand it to me.”  The stones of the tower rumbled beneath him as he spoke.  He could feel a fine tremour in the floor through his boots.
“Please,” said Foucault, and stretched out his hand for the card. “I am the last of the research team that did this wrong to Donald McKinsey.  I would be grateful for the opportunity to make even this small amount of recompense.  I will call your DI Lestrade, Mr Holmes.  Thank you.”

“Shhh, shhh. Let me in, love.” Christ, Sherlock was so very tight. John was dizzy with the knowledge that no one else had been here before him, that he was the first one to give Sherlock this. He searched the posterior wall of the pouch, seeking... ah, there. Larger than the secondary nipples, sweet knots of slippery flesh between John’s fingers, Sherlock’s teats swelled and hardened.

John pulled a chair forward and sat down at the bedside. “You’re right, of course. She also provided breakfast to Bill Wiggins. My wife saw fit to wrap my gun in a couple of shirts and hand it off to a homeless crack addict to carry across London.”
“Uh, not foreign like Arabic or Chinese. I could read the letters, but not the words.”

“Did Lestrade give you much trouble?”
“You married Mr Wentworth shortly after the publication of his first novel, a highly fictionalized account of his voyage around the world on a series of tramp steamers.”
subconscious and however our subconscious minds managed to affect the skin on our wrists,” John said dubiously.
He was a bit taken aback when Molly handed him a large package wrapped in plain brown paper.
“The Committee...  Do its members wear posh suits and carry umbrellas and control security cameras and have people pulled off the street to be interrogated in empty warehouses?”
4)	The names given to biological divisions of mammals use our own species as the norm to an amazing degree.  Because we are placental mammals, placental mammals are considered to be eutherians – literally, good beasts.  Marsupials are metatherians, middling beasts.  Beasts that didn’t quite make the cut.
Sherlock looked up from his file and stared at John.
Umbrella Man’s lackeys apparently knew Sherlock’s preferences, because an equally pricey-looking pot of honey had been provided along with the jam.  Sherlock reappeared almost 15 minutes later (“Wrong – not more than 13 minutes, 17 seconds”), drank a cup of tea, ate half a piece of toast with honey and then more or less dragged John out the door.
“No, I don’t .  I take my tea black with sugar.”
“I can’t imagine why not,” muttered John .
“John,” said Sherlock aggrievedly, “This is an irrelevant waste of time.”
As John hesitated, Marie placed a possessive hand on his elbow.  “John hasn’t finished his breakfast.”
Smoky McPherson was an old man now and his hands were shaky, but in his prime he’d been the go-to guy for tattoos not just in his own cellblock but in the entire prison. Transferees from other prisons thanked their luck for the opportunity to get a tattoo from Smoky.
“Perhaps that’s why I’d like to meet them again.”
John smiled ruefully. “Sometimes Sherlock tells me things when I’m not actually there to hear them.”
“Hold on there! Sherlock, you can’t leave now!” They’d forgotten Mary, who was now glaring at them with her hands on her hips. “I’m too close! This baby could be born any time now.”
Of course she did. She dealt with Sherlock all the time.
Then he had to swallow, hard, but Sherlock didn’t seem to notice.  “You spent eight years in Canada under the impression that you’d be there for the rest of your life.  You experience physical attraction to other people under the right circumstances...”
“Oh, really?” She looked extraordinarily pleased.
On a cold, sunny day, the ship sailed into the easternmost seaport of Ivan’s homeland.  As soon as the ship was tied off at the dock, Ivan called on the port master.  Showing the tsar’s signet ring, he asked that a message be sent to the nearest imperial garrison, and this was done.
“They had a tiff and she slapped him across the face. Three times.”
Sherlock didn’t bother to look up from his microscope.  “Nope.”
“What
to tell you things. I’ll make you a deal.”
“William,” John repeated, trying out the sound of it. “Wait –
I’m here, Sherlock, thought John.
“They’ve always fit rather
Sherlock quickly weighed her (461 grams). Then he held her while John measured her length (28 cm) and took a photo of the miniature girl child cradled in Sherlock’s huge hands.
“It was inevitable, I suppose. My pouch is accumulating more insulation to keep the child warm, the lining is getting ready to exude aerosols to help it breathe and my teats are swelling. Which is all fine but soon none of my trousers will fit!”
Then the woman screamed, and Ivan had drawn his sword and spurred Bezimyan forward before he even thought was he was doing.  He would have ridden to her assistance except that Bezimyan stumbled over a root.  Ivan spared a moment’s attention to catch his balance – and realized that once again he was about to ride off the road.
“Ohhh.
“Ignore John, Dexter. He’s devoted to his evening paper and becomes grumpy when interrupted. Would you like some tea? Please, sit down.”
“I need to speak with Billy a moment,” Sherlock announced.  He let himself into 221A, leaving John to climb the stairs on his own.  He hadn’t known Sherlock was in London when he made the decision to return to the UBR.  He hadn’t thought of Sherlock at all.  In only two days, his life had reoriented itself around Sherlock Holmes so completely that it was as if things had always been this way.
“She, uh...”  Billy glanced at the closed door, leaned in closer to Lestrade and lowered his voice.  “She don’t always remember to pull the curtains when she gets dressed in the morning.”
“You are?”
“No, but Mary’s right. We’re definitely going to have a real need for a babysitter, so try not to piss off Mrs Hudson.”
“Death of the foundation of civilization as we know it!” insisted the telly.
Sherlock, left to his own devices, would simply bin the sheets. “Sherlock, walk with Mary in case she needs support. I’ll take care of the sheets.” And get rid of the strap while he was at it.
“Breaking into a sorcerer’s castle tomorrow.  Get some sleep.  But first, fire or no fire?  I’m counting to ten and I don’t have an answer by then, I’m building one.”  Odin, dva, tri...  When he reached desyat’ without further comment from Sherlock, Ivan levered himself to his feet and staggered around until he found a stout fallen branch.  With apologies to the blade, he used his sword to hack off a length suitable for a walking stick.  Then he set out to gather more fallen wood.
John thought of the perfectly nice cheese sandwich waiting for him in his desk drawer with regret. “Lunch it is.  Half past noon?”
“My...”
Lestrade shrugged. “The kid’s 16.  A bit young for it, maybe, but not excessively so.  Anyway, she goes over to the uncle’s flat.  Everything looks okay, but the uncle – his name’s Donald McKinsey, by the way – isn’t there.  So she phones in a missing person’s report.  When asked for identifying marks, she mentions that McKinsey’s right hand was amputated decades ago.  Because of the hand, the officer taking the report referred her to me.  I asked her to meet us here.”
“I slept on train.”
“I didn’t need your help,” Mary spat. “I could, I
“Can’t,
“Well, humans have secondary genders, of course.”
It was almost 5’o’clock when they left the Yard. John was about to suggest that they stop for take-away on their way back to Baker Street, but Sherlock pulled out his mobile and, unusually for him, placed a voice call.
“But not yet, we need to wait until after dark.”  Sherlock began walking again.  Willy-nilly, John followed.
“I thought we’d made progress on disabusing you of that notion.” Sherlock’s voice oozed out in its lowest register as he stepped up to Dexter, placed his hands on the alpha’s shoulders and drew him in for a kiss. The first kiss was almost chaste. The second, far less so. By the third, Dexter had gotten up the nerve to place both hands around Sherlock’s waist – and then reach down a bit to squeeze Sherlock’s absurdly luxurious bum.
He grimaced again, cried out and started to fall. The paramedics rushed forward to help John lower him to the floor. John stepped back and watched as they fitted an oxygen mask to Sherlock’s pale face and got him ready for transport.
The darkness and chill of the winter evening outside were just what John needed. He walked fast but aimlessly, taking turnings at random until he found himself at the Thames. He walked halfway out on the downstream Golden Jubilee Bridge and stood for a while, watching the dark waters flow below him.
. It was traipsing all over London that put him back in the hospital.”
John smiled, warm right down to his belly. “Can you, then.”
After the first couple of nights, John took it upon himself to change the sheets on his old bed at Baker Street. He went back to the flat he’d shared with Mary for a few more of his things.  Nothing more than he’d need for a week.  He

“Dr Robert Foucault,” said Sherlock, pronouncing the French r’s in “Ro-bear” faultlessly, at least to John’s ear. “Studied with Edward Blessington, who in turn was one of Dobrieuzi’s students.”
“You were in a monastery? With monks?
“They were useful,” agreed Sherlock, nuzzling Ivan’s hair.
Manya didn’t seem to think he was taking this seriously enough.  “I warn you, Vanya Stolitsky, not for injury or nightfall, no matter what you may see or hear, do not stop.”
“Sherlock, dear, even you can’t know...”
The Caustlins had taken the Tube to St Bart’s, so Lestrade drove them to the Yard, leaving Sherlock and John to take a cab. As it turned out, this was probably just as well.
told me I was amazing.”
“After you started doing his work for him, you mean.”
“Sally seems to be in good spirits, at least for her.”  Sherlock turned to look at Anderson’s face and then, rather pointedly, further down.  “I can’t think of any other means by which
“I think so.  But stand back – no, not in front of it, over there.”
, something else again.
“No... Yes, actually.  Black, no sugar.”  Without further invitation, she seated herself on the sofa.  She was dressed much as she had been the day that they visited the lab, except without a lab coat over her sensible blouse and trousers.  Also, she seemed to be wearing more make-up.
Harrieta had not been seen to be sober since.  It was open talk in the streets of the capital that perhaps the end had come to the imperial line, since there was now no one qualified to rule.

Manya smiled in relief.  “Well, really, no one can do more than that!”
“I’m fairly sure I’m owed some amount of paternity leave. Whether or not it’s all
“You’ve heard the rest. Victor’s family wanted me arrested for murder.  The university just wanted me
“David Watson.  Your cousin.”  Neither of them offered to shake hands.
Lestrade sighed. “Would you believe I miss Anderson sometimes?”
There was a squeal as the driver slammed the brakes on to avoid a crowd of pedestrians who’d all decided to cross the road at once.  Many of them weren’t even paying attention to where they were going but were instead either talking on or staring at more of those blocky cell phones.
With that he rose up on his toes and kissed Sherlock full on the lips, yet chastely and gently.  When he drew back, Sherlock stared at him a moment, then turned back to the books and papers.  Ivan couldn’t tell if Sherlock was avoiding his gaze or just more interested in the books and papers.  Shaking his head, he went to find out where Marfa Hudovna had bestowed him for the night.
of them. Together.
“She knows she’s coming in to identify a body?” asked John.
“You like Sherlock, don’t you, pet?”
Judging by Muircheartaigh’s giggles, the sorcerer seemed to find the question hilarious.  “No, Vanechka, this time the contents themselves will have sufficient
“I want to see you,” Sherlock grumbled.
I am?  Look, you, I’ve been seen by the finest doctors in...” – the imperial court – “uh, that my father could hire...”
“No, alone.”
“He’s married.  He’s got to go stay with his spouse.”
the UBR that’s invited us back.”
“I posted a message of my own which should attract the killer’s attention.  We’ll need to wait 24 hours for posting and then some additional time before he notices it.”
Once inside the hospital John looked around for Sherlock, only to be spotted by someone else instead.
The solitary blond glared at his mobile and clicked a button several times. As Campbell-Williams turned back to face Wentworth, there was a moment when she and the blond man appeared to look directly at each other.  He scratched his nose, she continued to turn and the moment was over.
But Ivan only felt embarrassed as he explained, “I can’t handle a scythe, not with my leg, but I can follow behind you and bundle the rye.”

“And they are idiots.  The doctors may have
“I was right, you
Having made this resolution, John was about to turn away and put the kettle on when he realized that Sherlock’s eyes were open and his lips were moving.
“Unless you’re holed up in an alley somewhere being shot at.” Mary knew far too much about their usual working conditions.
“But when their dance ended and they’d cleared off the stage, the music sort of... held its breath.  And then it sort of charged forward and just as it did, this male dancer...”
“Please, Inspector, I know you mean well, but... Can we get this over with?”
“Sorry.”
It was entirely possible that, despite Umbrella Man’s warnings, the life John had found was a far better fit than the life he’d expected.
“A pair of blokes from MI-5 showed up first time this morning and informed me that they were confiscating the contents of Magnussen’s office and flat. Just the contents. I’m still stuck with the murder investigation.” He sipped the cup of coffee sitting on his desk and made a face. John wondered how long it had been there.
“I hope you two are on your way.”
“Common courtesy?”
“Fine then, try this.  I’m looking for someone of royal or at least noble blood to marry.  I suspect my father would prefer a princess but really, a prince would do just as...”
Sherlock drew a deep breath and said – just a bit shakily – “I would like to do that again. The date, I mean. Good night, John.”
“More questions?” he asked wearily.  “I thought I’d answered them all yesterday.”
When the time came for the rest of the company to disembark, however, the second mate approached Ivan, Nadya and Rada following behind him.  “Gospodin, with your permission I would ask Gospozha Nadezhda for her hand in marriage, swearing that her companion Radost’ shall have a home with us for as long as we live.”
“He rides from the western gate this very night, before the dawn breaks upon tomorrow,” replied the tsar equally loudly.  “He is so eager to be gone, he will not wait for the sun.”  Murmurs ran among those gathered in the hall.
The door at the top of staircase was, to Ivan’s surprise, unlocked.  “I didn’t have time to lock it behind me when I was interrupted previously,” Sherlock explained.  “And apparently
“All right, wrong question.
Mary looked up from her book sharply. “She knows, then.”
, that was John thrusting in again and again, so hard that he had to grab Sherlock’s hips for purchase, he’d...
“Bloody hell, have you been making a habit of going through my pockets?”
And here they were again. “Sherlock, that’s not why he likes you.”
After supper, John set about locating Sherlock’s laptop.  This proved to be easier than he’d first thought because the moment he began shifting books and papers about, Sherlock leapt up, declaring that John was moving things “out of order.”
“Police work’s hard on marriages, bonded or not. Pretty much everyone in the Yard is either separated or knows someone who is, often enough for years.  Me, Anderson, lots of others.”
“Who pays attention to a maid scrubbing floors?” John said thoughtfully.
“The king and the Duke of Norfolk were already dead when Revolutionary troops captured the Duke of Clarence and hauled him to the Tower in chains.  Under threat of torture, he opened the lock to reveal – an empty vault.  An angry and impetuous soldier shot him on the spot.”
“Not at all, I’d appreciate it.”  John’s smile was genuine this time.  It felt good to be recognized as valuable.
“Interested in Sherlock?  Why?  I’m guessing you’re not friends.”
“Actually, he’s not my...”
“Because Mary was.”
“Was exiled?”
Sherlock leaned forward slightly. “What sort of questions did you ask?”
“Dexter – but not Janine? Oh, ta.” John accepted his mug of tea.
“No, that I didn’t, doctor. That would be cheatin’.” Bill swallowed the last of his tea and wiped crumbs off his mouth with the back of his hand. “Missus ‘udson, doctor, it’s been a pleasure.” And he sauntered out the door.
“Yeah, that’s right! I didn’t!  I just...”  Tyler trailed off.
John stared.
“She’s nursing. My abdominal muscles are contracting. It feels as if... Actually, I can’t think of anything comparable.”
John blew out a breath. “It’s... complicated.”
John hesitated.  “I’d say private detective...”
“No, not from Baker Street. From 22 Craven Hill Gardens. The 999 operator was annoyed because it wasn’t really an emergency. The caller apparently felt an urgent need to report that someone was projecting a large photo of Marilyn Monroe on the buildings across the street. By the time we got someone out there, the projection was gone. The caller – fellow in his mid 80s – was quite stubborn about his identification. Blonde hair. Blue eyes. Said he’d know her anywhere. Then again, he’d apparently had a bit to drink.”

, got his license suspended
– and should – control our transport, John.”
Leather strap?
“Look, Mary, you need to call Janine.”
, I’d wait for you to come to me.”  She had a low, pleasant voice.  “But I’ve got an early flight tomorrow morning, so I’m calling it an evening.  This is for when I get back” – when she leaned forward to tuck a bit of paper in his shirt pocket, John got quite the view – “in two weeks.
When John got home, he discovered a note from Mary saying she’d gone over to Kate Whitney’s. John spent the better part of the afternoon catching up on medical journals. When Mary reappeared, it was only to remind John that she’d told him ages ago that she had some sort of megs’ night out scheduled with people named Becca and Carol. She offered to cancel. He insisted she go, rather wishing that she’d cancel anyway and then feeling put out when she took him at his word and went.
“I may be able to help you there,” said Ivan, drawing Marfa Hudovna’s sack from his belt and reaching into it.  He half expected to draw forth more pastries, but instead he found four loaves of fresh rye bread and a dozen ripe, juicy apples.  When he looked up, he discovered that everyone else had gathered around him, their eyes huge in their starved faces.  Andreyev was actually drooling.
“Your forensics team failed to note the tattoo under the victim’s right ear that would have given them reason. Call Sofia.”
The bullets sang as they sped through the air and then another voice joined in.  John couldn’t make out the words but the tune was sweet.  Lulling.  Nice, like the scent of Sherlock’s bed.
“MI-5?”
“Gold band.”
“She was a mathematician?”
Within the moist warmth of the pouch, Sherlock’s teats were noticeably larger. They must have grown gradually over time. How had John not noticed?
“Windows,” suggested Svinarnikov sagely.
Ivan went, through the hangings and up the narrow, twisting stairs.  He could feel the tower quivering beneath him like a nervous horse.  When he emerged onto the battlements, the sight that met his eyes was appalling.  The entire keep was in flames, the southern tower already collapsed in a sprawl of loose stone.  Flames flared from all the windows in the walls that still stood.  For the first time, he understood the enormity of the task Sherlock had undertaken and wondered how long the creature could sustain the effort.
Ivan took a deep breath and got a grip on his temper.  “Fine, Hashen’ka.  I never wanted the throne, but if that’s the way it is,
“I do know my job, Sherlock. I also sent a sample of the splinters from his clothes.”
“When we were at the pool...”
. Was Janine in league with Mary? Did she
Greg handed over a sealed envelope containing something small and heavy.
“Christ, Sherlock!” John grabbed the base of his cock to keep from coming on the spot. “I won’t
John opened his eyes.  There were, in fact, two things holding him down.  He still lay mostly at one side of the bed.  Sherlock, on the other hand, had invaded the centre during the night and was now sprawled out over a surprisingly large area, with one arm and one leg (each rather long) flung out over John.
“Quiet!” snapped Ivan.  “You said he should be the one to explain, now let him do so.  Sherlock?”
But Ivan shook his head.  “I swore a solemn oath to the tsar that I would deliver it to none but the lord Mur-kheyar-tikh.  If you will not let me pass, I must return to the tsar and report to him that the lord Mur-kheyar-tikh did not receive the message because his servants failed to recognize the tsar’s signet ring.”
“I will.  Thank you.”  He turned to go, then heard her say, “By the way, that was a clever trick, pretending to be lame.”
“And I’m sure his parents were grateful for your
didn’t mention her either. He talked a lot about a meeting, but he was pretty well drugged up. You told me he had a meeting that morning as well and that was almost certainly with Magnussen. When I replayed the recording of Sherlock’s statement, it wasn’t clear whether he was talking about one meeting or two, let alone which one he was talking about at any given moment.”
John did so and tucked it into his jacket pocket.
The smile flickered out. Mary nodded and slipped out the door. The two men stood listening as she climbed the stairs, opened the bedroom door and shut it behind her.
“Actually, Mrs Hudson, it
“Almost,” answered Sherlock. “Tyler, what happened in the next few days?”
Hours later, after the information Sherlock had gathered in the club had led them to tall-and-ginger – after tall-and-ginger had turned out not to be a thief but also to be extremely protective of his identical twin brother – after Sherlock and John had reached said brother before he could act on tall-and-ginger’s warning to flee – after their target had pulled a gun while tall-and-ginger came up behind them with a knife...
Sherlock continued unfazed.  “Bit of trouble too, I bet.”
“Very little, I would say.
A search of the Soldiers’ headquarters and bank accounts revealed a newly-constructed cell in the basement and several unusual financial transactions. Members of the group who hadn’t been in on the kidnapping plan professed themselves to be shocked and were eager to prove their innocence by providing further information.
“No.”
Listening now to a passionate, impeccable violinist partnered with a symphony orchestra was an enlightening experience. And that was true even though John knew he was missing all the finer points. Which was fine, he could ask Sherlock about them later. Sherlock would enjoy explaining.
“...you can mop up the spill.”
“Mycroft’s people aren’t as invisible as they’d like to think,” she clarified.
“She never understood you at all, in any case,” said John, chuckling at the memory. “After we were married, I asked her what she thought about asking you to join us. She said you were only interested in being my friend and that you’d never want children. Omega intuition, my arse. She must have been quite surprised when she came back.”
“I... I’m sorry.  Were you there at the time?”
“Toast?”  John held up a slice of bread for emphasis.
John stared at her, then turned away and began wrestling with the zip on the duffle.
He waited until Sherlock nodded, then ran his hand down along Sherlock’s shirt again, this time pulling it aside gently when it crossed the other edge just above Sherlock’s navel. Just
“A what?”
“I thought it would be... nostalgic,” offered John. “Bring back memories.” He tugged a bit nervously at his jumper, a deep navy blue that Mary had once told him brought out his eyes. Knowing that Sherlock would be wearing a suit, John had considered dressing more formally, but... No. This was a first date. A sort of dressed-up casual was called for. For Sherlock, that happened to be a suit. John wore his navy blue jumper with a new pair of cords and hoped for the best.
“Small-time crook. Usually works with Bill Ives, who has an equally crooked brother-in-law named George Banks who lives in the States.  Specifically, in Massachusetts.”
to do?”
Mrs Hudson set the freshly refilled teapot down between them with a clunk.  “But the short answer is that yes, they are.  More toast, John?”
“We’re done here,” announced Sherlock, striding for the doorway. Campbell-Williams had to jump out the way at the last minute to avoid being knocked over.
“Then we’ll stick to kissing for now. Can you move up a bit?”
“Those too. Have you ever played Zee, ah, Zee-gone?”
“Indeed not.  He was promptly executed.  Perhaps a little too promptly.  I’ve often wondered if he was a plant.”
“What about that pathologist? At St Bart’s?” proposed Lestrade.
“But.”
“Still, no one should be alone at this time of year. Maybe you should have invited him too.”
John frowned. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but that hardly sounds like a ‘one’.  I’m surprised you didn’t turn Lestrade down.”
John sat down absent-mindedly as names came to mind. Himself. Mary. Lestrade, Mrs Hudson. Molly perhaps. He tried and failed to imagine Molly Hooper, however pissed off, aiming a gun at Sherlock’s heart and pulling the trigger. He shifted in his seat – wait, what was he sitting on?
The man looked at him closely for a moment, then took a notebook out of his inside pocket and opened it.  “What can you tell me about the woman known, among other names, as Mary Elizabeth Morstan?”
The constables arrested them all on the spot. Fortunately, Minnie proved extremely distracting both as to scent and sound. She was well and truly going into heat by now, her alpha was lying on the floor unconscious or dead
Finally, the Caustlins pulled apart. “Are we almost done here?” asked Miranda.
“...some exercise and...”
each other.  I loved her, Johnny.  I never meant to hurt her, and by the end I was doing nothing but.”
“Let me phrase it more generally.  What sort of stranger would most people trust?”
But Wiggins stared back at him calmly enough. “’E looked like ‘e was thinkin’ abou’ it. But then ’e said – ‘No, me blogger would objeck.’ Tha’s what ‘e said.” He stumbled a bit as John let go of him.
“Dunno. Hard to be sure when we’re both almost fully dressed.” John ran one hand along the edge of Sherlock’s shirt, following it down past his chest to where it still hid his lower torso.
Sherlock waited at the top of the stair, watching, assessing,
“You grabbed him and yelled at me to run. You were wrapped in Semtex, you knew there were snipers aiming at you. You tried to sacrifice your life to give me a chance to escape.” Sherlock’s voice was intent, focussed as a laser beam. “When did
John put down the newspaper he’d been trying to hide behind. “What I’m thinking... isn’t really any of my business.”
“It’s all right, gospozha.  Sherlock already told me who his mother is.”
“As you’ve noted yourself, what we are about to attempt is dangerous.  You should take this, but don’t let the guards see it.”  With that he plucked a long, crimson red feather from his wing and handed it to Ivan.  Ivan carefully tucked it inside his shirt, but when he looked up again, Sherlock was gone.
John approached and sniffed. Still Mary, still lemon tarts and orange blossoms, but there was something new, something mixed in. Something very much like... gun steel and musk.
have experience dealing with difficult children.”
Next Marfa Hudovna gave him what appeared to be an empty sack.  “Keep that with you, dear, to hold food for your journey.”
“But I haven’t mentioned a figure.”
“Sherlock, thank you.  This was very, ah, thoughtful of you.”  To John’s ears his own voice sounded awkward and stilted.
She turned slightly as Sherlock spoke again.
Tyler looked impressed. Miranda looked... interested.
“We’re going to be seeing action in a few minutes,” muttered Donovan. “Where’s the Freak?”
“Just leave it, okay? Please?”
opened the vault and removed the jewels.  It’s not unlikely that others were involved in the plot.”
Finally: “Okay, it’s safe now. I think.”
“Sherlock’s awake, his vitals are stable, he’s going to make it. But you,
it.  And if his army service came up at all, he could use the Fifth Northumberland to draw attention away from his more recent service and his actions during the Revolution.”
John was on his feet reaching for his cane before she was done with her sentence.  “Actually, I have.  Mrs Hudson, thanks for the meal!  Sherlock, I’ll just be a minute getting my...”
John licked Sherlock’s neck and then nipped it.
“What did I look like, then?” asked John, startled.
“All right,” said Lestrade, “this is what we’ve got. Miranda Caustlin goes on holidays for a couple of weeks.  She returns to find a series of message on her house phone from her uncle’s caregiver.  The caregiver hadn’t seen any sign of him for a few days and was getting concerned.”
“Let him in,” said another guard.  “What harm can a cripple do against us?”
“I’ll try.”
“Considering that we only have two...”
“It will help you see through illusions, dear.”
“Have you considered cross-dressers?” John offered helpfully.
“I could not stay once I realized. I am sorry.  Helen – Dr Campbell-Williams – she does not know why I left.”
Anderson stepped back from them, but persisted.  “I’m just saying that...”
“Since 14 years ago and no, he doesn’t have to,” John retorted. “If I may?”  He indicated Sherlock, who was now holding the yellow tape up so that John could enter.
The muscles of Sherlock’s jaw tightened, but the creature spoke no word of protest.
John took a breath.  “Funny how that worked out.”
in a way that the other had not been.  Ivan had long looked on his companion with appreciation and a fair bit of awe, but the growing warmth he now felt in the pit of his belly was new – and not unwelcome, at least not to him.  What Sherlock might be feeling, he had no idea, and so he stood quite still, waiting to see what Sherlock would do.
.  Further experimentation had revealed that Sherlock enjoyed (rather than tolerated) hand jobs and frottage as well as kissing.  Any good scientist will take care to confirm that their experimental results are repeatable.  John felt that he and Sherlock had proven themselves to be very good scientists indeed.
, Mary?”
John smiled, nodded and fled.

for your date.”
“He’s got the root in some sort of censer.  Why isn’t he affected by it?”
“Is she always like that?” John asked, somewhat incredulously.
John made a try at sounding convincing.  “No.”
“Yes, I do.” Sherlock’s voice was so soft that it was almost a baritone whisper.  He didn’t move away, neither when John sat down next to him on the sofa nor when, after a moment’s hesitation, John slipped an arm around his shoulders.
“No, thanks. Oh, ta. Mmmm. This is really good tea.”
“Well, yes.  But you’d know, being his h-, h-, husband and all.”
The paramedics looked puzzled. “We were told there was a shooting.”
“You wouldn’t want me as the third in your marriage, of course. I’d be too close, see too much. In fact, all but the most stupid and unobservant betas would have represented a risk to someone like you who has so much to hide. Too bad stupid’s not John’s type.”
“I’d assumed you’d, uh, broken in. Somehow.”
“Janine. With Sherlock.” Mary sounded a bit blank.
“Billy...” Marie began, but Mrs Hudson interrupted.
Wait.
“Right.  So, you gave a statement?”  When Sherlock raised an eyebrow, John explained, “We should keep our stories straight.”
When Sherlock said nothing further, Ivan opened the case.  He saw Sherlock’s eyebrows go up at the sight of the four feathers tucked in next to the heart, but he could not tell read Sherlock’s expression at all.  Was it surprise?  Amusement?  Puzzlement?  Or perhaps a mixture of all three?
By the time they arrived within sight of the castle, the day was beginning to turn quite warm.  Sweating and huffing a bit, Ivan was startled when Sherlock suddenly landed next to him.
Tyuleneva glared a moment longer, then muttered, “Sorry,” and sat back down next to Andreyev, who whispered something in her ear.
“Molly Hooper is no...”
Sherlock shrugged. “Obvious. So I suggested Wiggins, waited until John had handed over the keys the evening before and then went out that night while John was asleep to have a look before everything was cleared out the next day.” He preened, proud of himself.
given John permission to use.  After some grumbling and a few false starts, Sherlock excavated the laptop – a blocky thing that couldn’t have weighed less than a stone – and showed John how to access Uber.
He dreamt that he was flying.
should trust him.”
“He’d left the skull in my room, so the henchmen thought it was mine and packed it. I found it years later when Mycroft had the boxes sent to me at Montague Street.  Why do you care?”
Lestrade looked askance at Mrs Hudson, but John nodded. “The tabloids. Sherlock knew that once Janine’s story appeared in the tabloids, Lestrade would have more questions. So what does Sherlock know that he doesn’t want Lestrade asking questions about?” John started to pace back and forth across the living room.
Mike brightened.  “Teaching now.  Bright young things, like we used to be.  God, I hate them!”
“Deceased?” prompted Lestrade.
With another sigh, John rephrased. “I mean that I’m not going to allow you to create a situation in which I might hurt you because I’m not in my right mind.”
“Often enough I was able to make my way by doing people favours.”
“If you’re going to think that loudly, you’d might as well say what you’re thinking,” complained Sherlock, looking up from his microscope and glaring at John. He was well into his regular transition from post-case celebration to stroppy boredom.
“Victor was always greedy. As I’d half-expected, he didn’t wait for me.  He’d gone ahead and tried out his birthday present.  He was... still alive when I got there.  I called 999.  They were too late.”
“Why?  I don’t want coffee, I want the samples to compare them with the one I took from today’s corpse.”
“You do realize that all that was necessary for the ruse to succeed?”
Dinner was splendid. This didn’t prevent Sherlock from picking at his food. Mrs Holmes cornered John in the kitchen afterwards and bestowed several containers of leftovers on him.
“Because he’s not only gone to a lot of trouble, he’s been
“So’s John. Sentimental, I mean, not an assassin. If psychopaths are
“It wasn’t my fault he died,” yelled Tyler. “It was the fucking paramedics!”  And he burst into tears.
“Aha,” said Sherlock in tones of deep satisfaction.  He took the torch from John and began to examine the workbench.  To John’s eye, its array of precision tools was as diverse and well-organized as instruments in an operating room.
He boarded the bus.  The driver followed him and slammed the bus door shut.  As the engine started up again, John could hear the driver mutter, “Bloody cow.”
at you two,” John exclaimed. “
“Sherlock...”
John ran forward to grab Sherlock’s arm, hardly aware of Mary doing the same on the other side, hardly aware that he himself was speaking, almost chanting. “Come on, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.”
Sherlock finished his speech and more or less ordered everyone to dance. As the guests happily moved off in threes and twos to comply, John placed one arm around Mary’s shoulders and held the other out to Sherlock. “Come dance with us,” he invited, looking into Sherlock’s eyes and smiling.
Sherlock, it turned out, had travelled in Tibet. He regaled John with his detailed observations of local customs, his encounters with local cuisine...
Campbell-Williams drew herself up. “Our research, Dr Watson,

“Compared to
She kicked the coin towards Sherlock, making him bend to pick it up. When he straightened up holding it and spoke, John could hear the pain in his voice.
Surprised, John countered, “I’m not so sure about that.
The elderly man staggered out onto the pavement, spotted the cab and made for it with surprising speed, calling, “Taxi! Taxi!” even as he bore down on it.
The battle that day went badly from the first.  A fierce, hot wind that filled the air with sand and dust, so that the sun looked pale and sickly.  The regiment of which Ivan and his men were part was to attack from the east, eventually meeting another regiment attacking from the west, but their maps were inaccurate and they encountered the enemy before they looked to do so.  Still they pushed onward, not wanting to fail their fellow soldiers.  Too late their scouts brought the news that the other regiment had already fallen and that the entire main force of the enemy would soon be upon them.  The commanders order that the retreat be sounded.
“Then would you mind if I put a word in with our Committee liaison?”
“Prettily, no doubt.”
About to take another swallow of beer, Greg stopped and looked at John. “Five feet bored?”
“John, please.”
John couldn’t hold back his chuckles. “You’re the

Someone was clattering up the stairs, too fast to be Mrs Hudson.
door, stood up and produced a gun, only to have John twist his wrist sharply and remove the gun from him as the Yarders surrounded the cab.
Three different people suggested three different pubs.
“Just so.  Especially considering that the UBR has significant differences in political and economic structure.”
“There was some debate among the senior researchers as to whether or not we should publish,” Foucault continued. “Some said no, but Dr Blessington said it was our responsibility, that other researchers should not inadvertently repeat what we had done.  But I think you have already read the resulting paper, Mr Holmes?”
“Did you bring any morphine?” Sherlock replied. His pain was obvious now. “I asked on the phone.”
Muircheartaigh stepped out from behind the hangings.  Gone were his crown, his sceptre, his ermine stole.  He wore only his black robes.  The hem was noticeably singed.  “Did you think that little girl would be able to distract me for long?”
, then John will have wasted his afternoon by coming here.  Therefore...”
“Then how...”
The ride took more than three hours, with the bus bumping along badly maintained roads and meandering through incomprehensible detours.  The driver refused to allow any breaks.  The windows of the bus would not open.  From the smell, it was apparent that at least one of the children had wet themselves.
“I’d also advise against trying to bleach it, burn it or cut it out. Or scrape or sand it off.  Stop looking at me like that.  Doctors see a lot of things.”
Ivan got a firm grip on his temper.  “I need it because I’m lame.  Battle injury.”
John had not only made the coffee but drunk a mug of it by the time Sherlock exited the bathroom, blowing a kiss back inside before he shut the door carefully. With only a towel wrapped loosely around his midriff, he gave John a sheepish grin as he slid sideways into the bedroom. John was on his second mug by the time Sherlock reappeared again, this time wearing black trousers and a white shirt.
“Boring.  I have a search algorithm that hunts for keywords, not all that different from what the censors use.  Religious groups – other than Anglicans, obviously – often use BritChat to communicate, but they need to avoid words like ‘sin’ and ‘salvation’ if they actually want their posts to appear.  I accidentally had a post banned a few years ago during a case concerning several slaughtered sheep of various ages.”
Already beginning to sit down, John rose back up to his feet.  “Speaking both from experience and as a doctor, I can assure you that psychosomatic pain is still genuinely
“So to speak.  Oliver Cromwell was one of the leaders of a 17
“You’re suggesting that I give away everything in the house?”
Sherlock unhooked his claws, jumped lightly to the floor and reached into the opening in the wall, pulling out a small metal case.  This too was locked.  Sherlock examined the lock briefly as more masonry collapsed somewhere else in the keep.
“Thanks!” John called to Angelo’s retreating back.  He frowned at the menu.
“I’m here with Sherlock, my...”
For dessert, John ordered tiramisu and coffee, Sherlock only coffee.
of us is either an omegologist or a betologist.”
“Damn, I told her to get everyone clear!”
Appeased, Sherlock shrugged. “It’s what I’m doing.”
“Nowadays, yes. Historically, no.  And ‘unusual’ doesn’t mean non-existent.”
John waited a moment, but Sherlock didn’t offer further details.
Mrs Hudson returned from her sister’s as scheduled. A few days later she caught John as he was coming in the door with Tesco bags. Lots and lots of Tesco bags. Not only was he now buying for Mary as well as himself and Sherlock, he was also discovering that “eating for two” was not a myth.
After the concert they set out on foot, intending to walk for a bit and then call a cab. Instead they ended up walking the entire three miles. Sherlock lectured happily while John prompted him with questions any time he appeared to be running down.
John gave him a wary nod.
Except, thought Ivan, that Sherlock had presumably never been to your village.
“Because it is a message from the great and glorious tsar!”
“One of the ushers. In the interest of full disclosure, he
“You’re a doctor, she’s nurse.”
“Not me, mate! She did that on her own steam. If I were you, I’d go home and brush off my kilt.”
The shirt provided was short enough that it would have surely left a strip of bare skin above Sherlock’s trousers. On John, it fit nicely in terms of length but was uncomfortably tight across the shoulders and chest.  After a cursory glance around the living room and kitchen to see if he could spot one of his jumpers, he resigned himself to the situation and opened the door to admit...  Dr Campbell-Williams.
Sherlock shut his mouth.
Harry sighed. “’Cause I wouldn’t have listened.  You were right.  We were everything each other wanted and we were awful for each other.  We were awful
“You mean normally for Sherlock, of course. Was he working on a case?”
“Dr Campbell-Williams.”
“You can

“You’re married?” asked Ivan, somewhat surprised.
the widower had grabbed him by the arms.
“You’re like me then.  We’ve both done what we needed to do.”  John raised the glass of mineral water he’d chosen in lieu of wine.  “Here’s to survival.”
“Not always even after that,” John admitted.
Sherlock blinked and then smiled slowly. He lay back so that his head was practically in John’s lap and patted his own chest. “Here,” he said, and John could have happily drowned in the depths of his voice. “Sit here. Now lean forward.”
Bill looked mournful.  “Heard the arsehole got charged with DUI
The woman’s voice startled Ivan out of the haze which had begun to envelope him.  Her bright-coloured silk robes were finely embroidered, but they were also filthy and worn into tatters where the hem brushed along the ground.  Her silk slippers were in rags, and her track across the courtyard was marked by bloody footprints.  The long brown hair that fell around her gaunt face was dirty, matted and scattered with jewels.
“What do you want?” barked one of them, a stout fellow with fierce mustachios.
certain things.”
“Oh, please. A blind monk could tell that Molly’s as bent as a safety pin. I have no doubt that you asked about her. What better, safer way to convince John that you actually
“Did he mention any specific names?”
“That’s enough!” John bellowed.  “I’ve had a long and tiring trip, I’ve been carted around like a piece of baggage and for reasons I don’t understand, people keep telling me that there’s no room for me anywhere in London except this flat.  I’ll get that straightened out tomorrow and be out of your hair.
Mary looked puzzled.
“You almost married a woman, in Canada.”
John stared as Sherlock ushered Dexter to a seat at the kitchen table. Only when Sherlock glanced his way and raised an eyebrow did John stick his head back into his curiously uninteresting newspaper.
“At fifteen, you apprenticed yourself to a sorcerer whom you suspected of being a murderer in order to get more information?  Sweet gods, Sherlock, why didn’t you tell your brother of your suspicions and let him deal with it?”
“Or to one guard among many.”
“And yet it doesn’t seem to have occurred to you that home pregnancy tests can give false negatives even at two weeks.”
“Caregiver?” asked Sherlock.
on anything.”
Something in John decided that wasn’t fine at all. He’d pulled Sherlock back and begun returning the kiss before he even thought about it. By the time he
Behind the house stood a small barn.  Once Ivan had got Bezimyan settled down with hay and grain, he entered the house itself.  It was well-furnished but everything was in an older style and somewhat worn, so that the overall effect was comfortable rather than grand.
“The writer keeps mentioning jewels?”
Throwing his covers to one side – “Oi, Sherlock, you almost hit me in the face!” – Sherlock rose from the bed, tall and graceful in his pyjamas as he took a position in the middle of the floor.  He swung both of his arms to the left, took a sharp breath, rose onto his left foot and did a perfect full-circle pirouette.
“I had no need to break in. You left John with the job of clearing everything out. He arranged to have a charity come around to pick up the contents. He also gave Bill Wiggins the keys so that Wiggins could be there to let the charity’s volunteers in.”
It all made a horrible kind of sense, absolutely useless for pushing back the tide of anger that threatened to swamp John, to suffocate his reason. “Just as well” John had left his gun at home, Sherlock had said.
you, sir!”  He dashed out of the flat and could be heard clattering down the stairs.
“What was in the glass?” he asked Sherlock, knowing the detective would need no further clarification.
John fielded a decent supper of baked chicken, jacket potatoes and a green salad. He took it as a compliment when Mrs Holmes exclaimed, “Thank god, at least one of you can cook!” She also made Sherlock help her wash up afterwards.
. Everything they’d done up until now, Sherlock had done before – and quite possibly only for cases. This,
“For 0.69 seconds. She came to see me in the hospital after the story hit the tabloids. She called me a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard.”
very happy.”
Both Lestrade and John stared at Sherlock with expressions of disbelief.  When Sherlock merely stared back, Lestrade planted his feet and, with a couple of hard yanks, got the door open again.
“Oh?” said John. And then had to swallow back all of ten different things he thought of saying next.
John staggered up two flights of stairs, stripped down to his vest and pants and fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.
John refrained from entering into a debate on the existence of order in the mess and instead mildly pointed out that he was merely looking for the laptop that Sherlock had
“I didn’t sneak, I used my key. And the clothes situation was getting urgent.”
“This is quite an improvement over the last time I woke up in bed with you,” rumbled Sherlock.  He didn’t move.  In fact, he seemed quite comfortable where he was.
“You kissed Janine, remember?”
, so start explaining!”

“Everyone around her is so much less intelligent that they might as well be asleep.  There’s
“I was making do while you solved the case,” John retorted as he handed Madeleine over.
Sherlock’s lips quirked.  The expression was not a smile and did not reach his eyes.  “He is, perhaps, not all that impressive.”
“Wait a moment, you told me something like that before.  The night before we invaded the castle – you told me that’s how Muircheartaigh got his slaves.”
Everything after Lestrade’s call was a bit of a blur. Somehow John found himself sitting in an anonymous waiting room with no clear idea as to how long he’d been there. He’d been assured that Mr Holmes’ next of kin had authorized John to receive all information available
? My bridesmeg Janine?”
“No, I simply walked out. There was no sneaking involved. You sleep fairly soundly unless you have a nightmare. If you
“I’ve researched dating protocols on the Internet,” Sherlock said. “This is normally the point at which we would tell each more about ourselves. Hobbies, interests, that sort of thing.”
As Angelo bustled off, Sherlock considered the long, curved piece of metal rising up from the table. “You’re far more insecure than I expected from ‘Three Continents’ Watson.”
“Yes, Dr Watson. Everything was going well, we thought.  The colour reversal was already proceeding, although slowly, over the course of several days.  But Donald complained of pain in his wrist.  We did not realize at first.  We thought, the muscle tissue.  But x-rays revealed that the bone was heavily corroded – and that the corrosion was spreading.  It was necessary to amputate the wrist for to save the arm.  Donald was... angry.  Angry and shocked.  We were all shocked.  The research project was discontinued after this.”
The guards’ sloppy behaviour continued.  Ivan should have been disarmed but instead his sword drew only a couple of glances.  He touched the hilt and explained briefly, “Ceremonial,” then leaned more heavily on his stick.  The guards who’d bothered to look shrugged and joined their fellows in arguing over the signet ring.  Each one had to take Ivan’s hand and examine the ring closely for himself.  It was quite obvious that none of them had the vaguest idea what the tsar’s seal actually looked like, and equally obvious that none of them wanted to admit this.
He’d gone to his bank before leaving Canada, asking if he could buy some UBR pounds there.  The teller had replied knowingly, “You

Sherlock stiffened.  “It sounds to
John grinned as he reached for another piece of toast.  “Sounds like a guess to me.”
“For a bit. He tried to warn Sherlock off the Magnussen case.”
“Because your supply of Canadian dollars is going to run out eventually.”
Lestrade frowned slightly. “You mean someone was trying to make us
“That’s when two particles are in different places and you do something to one of them and the other reacts, yeah?” John felt proud of himself when Sherlock raised his eyebrows.  Not
“This one’s taken!” yelled Wentworth as he tried to manhandle Campbell-Williams into the back seat. A thick-set man started to get out of the front passenger seat to assist him.
The tech spoke up urgently. “Wait, wait!  They’re talking...”
“I can feel them shift against my pouch lining every time I move and I can’t stand it, you need to touch them!”
“Bravo!” applauded John.
“That’s not reassuring. I’ve seen
Lestrade looked puzzled. “New show on the telly?”
Mary stood, glanced at the door. Hesitated. Sherlock stood as well, and since this left John’s side feeling chilled, so did he.
“No. Seeing him in his element.”  Her voice took on an unexpectedly wistful note.  “Seeing him shine.”
“Hold your hand around the base to control how much you take in,” said Sherlock, far too coherent by half for John’s liking. He bent forward and kissed the tip of Sherlock’s cock, tasting bitter-salt pre-come, then licked a broad stripe upwards along the vein.  Another couple of licks, and then John Watson took his lover’s cock into his mouth and sucked.
looked amazing. His height neatly disguised the slight puffiness of his belly. Once he started carrying the child and especially as the child grew, his swollen pouch would become more noticeable. For now, John doubted that anyone who wasn’t already in the know could tell the difference.
“Obvious,” retorted Sherlock. “She’s been asked to come to a morgue.”
“Thanks,” said John. “It’s just for a few nights.”
“You can’t afford to,” was Sherlock’s cool reply. “The damages total more than £20,000” – Miranda gasped – “and you’re not that well off.  If you were, you would have hired a caregiver for your uncle seven days a week instead of three.  You took the trip to Spain because you won it in an office pool and you haven’t been able to afford a holiday in years.  That’s why you felt you needed to take advantage of the chance now, despite your misgivings about leaving both Tyler and your uncle on their own.”
“Mycroft is bringing his laptop.” Sherlock sounded like a petulant five-year-old.
“No, no, not at all. It’s just...”
Which was true. John couldn’t think of anything to say, and Dexter kept talking.
“No, no, that’s... just something doctors do. And, ah, I’m sorry about, well, earlier.”
Lestrade looked at John, who shrugged. At least Bart’s had a cafeteria.
“Sherlock, that was a bit...
When John returned from his errands, Sherlock was still on the sofa but now sound asleep, curled up snuffling into the sofa cushions with his back to the room.  John couldn’t help noticing the way his dressing gown pulled taut over his nicely rounded rump.
John collected the containers from the floor. Nothing had spilt. He shoved them all into the refrigerator, shoving aside experiments to make room. He’d sort it out later.
“Well, I hadn’t seen him for at least a month, I thought I’d drop by. People do that.”
In the morning John found Sherlock, wearing either the same dark suit as the evening before or its twin, sitting at the kitchen table peering down a microscope.  Much of the kitchen appeared to have been repurposed as a laboratory.  John wondered if he’d noticed this subconsciously the previous day and it had slipped into his dream.
“That’s what I’ll do.  Thank you.”
For the first time in the conversation, Harry cracked a ghost of a smile. “Oh, there’s plenty of ways to do that, trust me.  Are you having trouble, little brother?  Maybe I should give you Tim’s number.  But I thought your mad flatmate had taken you back?”
“Oh, are you still here?  I mean, not that you can’t be.  But Sherlock left ages ago.”
“Anderson won’t work with me.”  That was definitely Sherlock’s voice, becoming a bit clearer as the two men walked down the stairs.
While the company waited for the ship to be provisioned, Ivan spent the remainder of Harrieta’s jewels on warm clothes for the sea voyage.  The very last gold piece went for a trip to the bath house, a welcome experience for all of them after weeks on the road, washing up as best they could in cold streams.
“Oh, it’s not – but it
Things were still going well a month later when John scrubbed in on a coronary artery bypass graft at St Bart’s. It was a fairly common procedure among his patients, so he wanted to become more familiar with how it was done. The lead surgeon was pleased to invite him once he learned that John had been a trauma surgeon.
John slept soundly that night. When he woke in the morning, Sherlock was gone of course. John smiled when he discovered Sherlock in the living room, watching the film from the evening before. What surprised him, however, was that Sherlock paused the film to wish John a good morning.
John chuckled. “He’s underestimating... Hang on, what’s Sherlock got to do with this?”
They heard Mrs Holmes open the cottage door and yell, “Are you two smoking?”
Inside the bedroom, Mary stood pulling repeatedly on a rope dangling from what appeared to be an over-sized door knocker – nailed to the ceiling.
Sherlock shrugged, never slowing his strides.  “What you did, back there – that was good.”
“The Revolution cancelled all debts.  Indentured factory workers and miners, tenant farmers carrying generations worth of debt to their landlords – suddenly they were all free to move.  They moved here.”
“So you stole...”
Foucault looked troubled. “He would be in his late sixties now, Donald.”
“The officers didn’t get a good look at their faces.  However, an officer managed to get hold of the shorter one’s shoe as he went over the fence.”
After a moment, he opened it again and suggested with uncharacteristic diffidence, “Cetacea?”
“Oh, dear, Marie’s at odds with the appliances again.  John, the boys have the room upstairs.  Don’t hesitate to let me know if they cause you any trouble.”
“Run!” hissed Sherlock.  John was right behind him as they rounded the corner of the building and found themselves in a dead end, with wooden fences on all sides.  Sherlock took a running jump and scaled the fence that separated Wilson’s building from the one behind it.  He paused at the top, reaching down with one hand.
“He cleared my name.”
John discreetly checked his watch.  Five more minutes, he promised himself.  Five more minutes and he’d stop looking for a conversational break into which he could insert his farewells.  Five more minutes and he’d just walk out.
, but how would you know that, you’re a psychopath!”
of you.”
But Mary listened to something the real Sherlock said on the phone and pulled something small out of her purse. A coin, John realized, as she flipped it into the air – and shot it.
and no one came, not even with all the noise.  No one ever came.”  Tyler was crying by now.  Lestrade handed him some tissues.
“You wouldn’t have been with me. When I arrived at Magnussen’s office, Janine and the security guard were lying on the floor. You’re a doctor. You would have stopped to check their status and provide care if they were alive. I would have continued on up the stairs to Magnussen’s flat, where I would have found – did find – Mary and Magnussen. Mary’s back was to me when I entered the room. I thought she was... someone else.”
When he turned back to face Sherlock and John, his eyes were still wet.  “Sorry.”
off?”
“Probably not.”
“Better to be honest, Vanya,” said Harrieta, who’d come up behind him somehow.  She grinned over her shoulder as she walked away into the woods.  Ivan started to follow, but then the man in the meadow called out, “What do you want?” and he was Misha and the blade was a scythe.  Ivan remembered that he was supposed to be bundling the rye and went over to help, but Misha was always farther away.  Then he vanished altogether and the edge of the meadow was on fire, a ring of fire with Ivan in the middle, the flames leaping and dancing ever closer.
“Hold!” she commanded.  Tyuleneva twitched, but held her place.  So did everyone else.
“Ah, hello.  I’m looking for Sherlock Holmes?”
“I’m suggesting that you leave.”
And its feathers turned to flame.
“Yeah, that would be more useful if I had enough officers to comb the streets of London checking everyone’s left hands. Anything else?  What do you make of this?”
Then he regained a bit more consciousness and realized that his eyes were closed.  He opened them and for good measure, tried to wipe them with one hand, only to discover that while his eyelids obeyed his will readily enough, his hands did not.  They were not bound.  They simply would not move.  Indeed, he could not voluntarily move anything below his neck.  His heart still beat, his lungs breathed, his legs supported his weight – for indeed, he was standing upon them.
using the mother’s bloodstream to carry off its wastes,” Sherlock pointed out.
“The monks were meditating.
“Oh, well then. No gettin’ no fags pas’ you, I guess!” Smoky’s laughter became somewhat alarming. John was regretting not bringing his stethoscope by the time Smoky gathered enough breath to speak again and began to name names.
Sherlock’s blatantly sneering tone would have been annoying, except... This was Sherlock, who believed that alone protected him from, among other things, the burden of others’ expectations. Who
it was and ask how they came to choose that name. And Sherlock, the bastard, would smile and say, it’s his father’s middle name.
.  You can choose to destroy both hearts – or neither.  I suppose you could even destroy one heart at random, just to find out whose it is.  Are you a gambling man, Vanechka?”  Muircheartaigh giggled again.  The sound scraped at Ivan’s ears.
“...would have been taken as whining.”
Finding himself suddenly looking down the barrel of a gun, he stopped both moving and speaking.  The rest of the passengers froze as well.  The soldier holding the gun continued to stare at his target, while the rest of the soldiers spread out in a line facing the passengers.  A child started to squall and was hastily shushed.
“Cromwell Hospital,” he told the driver.  And then to John, “New Scotland Yard has all their autopsies done there.”
Suddenly, a horse neighed up ahead.  The chestnut stallion neighed in response.  A few more paces and the trees thinned and Ivan came in sight of Marfa Hudovna’s house.  But here he saw something strange, for in front of the house stood a well-grown apple tree, bearing blossoms and fruit together.  Next to the tree, grazing on windfalls, stood Bezimyan.
“Good.”
“The sorcerer.  He captures them and bespells them to dance until they die.  Look at the castle itself.”
“Being shown off.”
Now he crouched in a church doorway, his few belongings a tattered bundle by his side, sipping the sweet, milky coffee that Sherlock had ordered John to buy and studying the tattoo photos on John’s phone.
the little girl on the plane.  But Sherlock had never told John that.
“Yeah, alphas, I know. Anyway, punches were thrown, furniture was broken and the dean was called.”
“Sherlock.” John waited until Sherlock was actually looking at him, then gently touched Sherlock’s cheek. “If there’s a problem, we tell each other there’s a problem and talk about it. That’s all.”
“John Hamish Watson,” John snapped.
“You hit me,” whined a man.  Ivan whirled around to see one of the former slaves, his nose too large – and at the moment, bleeding profusely – in his thin face.
John remembered the two skulls, bison and human.  Did Sherlock engage in some bizarre form of taxidermy?  As a hobby or a profession?
John thought about his illegal gun, his addiction to danger and his penchant for psychopaths. “To be honest, no, not completely. And Sherlock and I
“This is more elaborate than the set-up he’d need for repair.  If I’m not mistaken, Wilson designed and created his own pieces as well.  Yet according to the police report, the only items for sale in his shop were unredeemed pledges.”
“Work has no place at a family gathering. We are here because Sherlock is home from hospital and we are
“Whose?”  The odd name sounded almost like something from Uilleam an t-Moireach’s language.
Sherlock sniffed audibly and turned back to his microscope. Molly had delivered a small cooler the evening before. John had decided not to ask about the contents, but he hoped they would keep Sherlock entertained for a while. Was the entire afternoon too much to hope for?
“Oooh, the puppy’s angry!  I’m so scared!  Did Sherlock tell you that you were worth more than that?  Honesty’s the best policy,
John went.  He was leaving footprints on the sand.  Was the tide coming in or going out?  Had he left footprints in the alley?  Sherlock would know.  Sherlock would take care of it.  All John had to do was to follow orders.
Lots on the news that evening about the changes in the divorce laws. A selection of interviews: a politician, a lawyer, a marriage counsellor, a theologian.  Two divorcing couples, one a pair of resolute men, the other a grim-faced woman and a tearful man.  The interviews were enlivened with footage of protesting pro-bonders, who were at least colourful and loud.  “Those whom fate hath bonded, let no one put asunder!” declared one man’s sign.  Another behind him read, “Dobrieuzi is burning in hell!”  The name rang a dim and distant bell in John’s mind, carrying a vague association with university lecture halls and chemical formulae scribbled on a chalkboard.
“Here, I’ll budge over. There’s room...  There you go, that’s it.”
At this there was much consternation among the guards.  They seemed to have no captain among them who might make a decision for the group.  There was some discussion of taking the matter directly to Muircheartaigh, but no one was eager to be the man who would “disturb Himself at His work.”
John was trying for levity, but Sherlock only stared at him, then shrugged. “We’d have ended up rolling around all over it when you attacked me.”
“We weren’t junkies, we were university students who used cocaine. Our families eventually agreed to let us marry after – and only if – we both graduated.  Victor’s grades improved considerably after that.”
Closer inspection revealed that the first Mrs Holmes was Mary, now wearing a wig, suitable make-up, the clothes Mrs Holmes had worn previously and some strategic padding. She was also carrying Mrs Holmes’ suitcase.
It turned out that Sherlock’s interest in urban beekeeping was genuine. Books on beekeeping and issues of
“That’s not...”
he was killed?”
“No, it’s fine. I’m, ah, used to it. Or should be. Sorry I broke down. You were saying?”
“I was getting there! Yes, our child is going to be huge. I’m going to waddle when I walk. Or maybe I won’t even be able to walk.”
“Which she’s never really gotten over, hence Tom. Let’s see, whom do I know who’s as little like Sherlock as possible? Short, blond...”
“Certainly he does, dear.  It was the first thing he set up when he arrived here.  Now come along,
“I wanted to stop a criminal and a murderer!  That was my goal from the first.  One of the many things you got wrong was that I offered myself as an apprentice
blood and urine. Neither Mary nor John commented when, shortly afterwards, a bottle of Beta’s Own Multivitamins Plus (“Everything you need when you’re carrying or expecting to carry!”) appeared in the bathroom cabinet.
Sherlock sniffed.
John drove the car back to the house, put the keys through the mail slot and took the Tube home.
Sherlock’s eyes fell shut. “First and last,” he muttered.
Sherlock looked blank.  “Milk?”
“One moment, gospozha,” said Ivan.  His voice was not quite steady.  “You have the advantage of me.”
Miranda shook her head. “Not that I ever heard.”
death - he knew this was important.  But he needed to focus on his balance, on the golden balance he held in the middle of the circle of flame.  On one side of the balance lay a coal-black feather, on the other side a beating heart.  The balance hung perfectly, absolutely level.  How could he decide?  And whose heart was being weighed?
Finally she handed him an earthenware jug and a cloth bundle.  If he tucked the bundle into the crook of his elbow, he could hold the jug in one hand and use the other for his walking stick.
“Sherlock...”
Mary seemed to think this was license to address John directly.
“Wait a moment, that man with her – he was in the lab this morning.”
“...leapt onto the stage and just took it over.  After that, it was his stage, no matter who else was on it.  I’d never seen a man move like that before.  Those tights...  I could see the muscles flex in his legs, his, well, arse.  I guess I was staring at his arse.”
“Oh!” Sherlock leapt up from the sofa.  “John, you have the potential to become genuinely useful.  We need to go interview the next-of-kin.”
A pause on the phone. Then: “Someone tried to shoot him in the heart and barely missed. The doctors don’t know if he’ll make it, John.”
“Rough day?” asked John.
Then the portly man began to read from his clipboard.  “Newcastle.  Abrams, Atkinson, Barton, Brennan, Catherwood, Charles, Cole.  Please board the Newcastle bus.”
John thought about this as he put the kettle on and set out two mugs for tea.  Sherlock came clumping up the stairs and headed immediately for the laptop.  He didn’t react when John set a mug of tea (with extra sugar) down next to him.  John drank his own tea, read for awhile and then turned in for the night.
“I’d like to be,” he answered finally.  “But first I am my father’s son.”
But he thought she’d enjoy his proposition, might go along with it despite the monitoring.  He spent the helicopter ride with his fingers itching for the feel of violin and bow.  Soon, he told them, soon.
Lestrade didn’t look happy. “What do you make of the toe?” he asked.
Bezimyan returned to the road willingly enough.  They rode all day past meadows and through woods, with a line of distant hills appearing gradually to their left.  Ivan made camp a short way from the road that night and slept well.  He did not dream.
“Oh, good, she was able avoid pastels.”
“And yet you claim that you don’t delete things,” Sherlock noted as he accepted his mug of tea.
The men began to retreat in good order, but then the new enemy forces arrived and all semblance of order disintegrated.  Amidst the chaos, Ivan and his men held together as a unit, fighting a fierce defense as they retreated to safety.  Suddenly young Wigginsky cried out as his horse stumbled and fell, its leg broken where it had stepped in a hole.  Almost immediately, one of the enemy bore down upon him, a huge brute of a man swinging an enormous mace.  Ivan charged forward to block the mace’s fall with his sword, but the sword broke.  He took the full impact of the mace upon his shoulder, where it burst the links of his chainmail.  Its spikes drove through his leather shirt, deep into the flesh beneath.
Once Mr Holmes returned from the airport, the rest of the day passed uneventfully. After lunch, Mrs Holmes suggested with extreme firmness that John and Mr Holmes should go out for a walk.
John felt a bit sorry for her, but mostly he felt warm all over and somehow lighter. “I’ve seen some strange things, practicing combat medicine,” he said gently. “I’ve seen some even stranger ones since then. I don’t believe in miracles either. I just believe in Sherlock Holmes.”
“You suffered a mace blow to your left shoulder, after which your horse fell on you.”
Cautiously, Ivan attempted to flex his toes within his boots.  It took some concentration, but he was fairly sure that he could move his left big toe.
Then there was the lanky bloke from the rugby team.  He’d had completely the wrong build for rugby, but he’d been a valued team mate because he was a brilliant strategist and could run damn fast, plus he had a wicked sense of humour that had enlivened many a post-match pub meet.
But Sherlock grinned.  “
all,” John shot back, “maybe I should date...”  Oh, hell, what was he saying?  He cut himself off, but Sherlock was still watching him, dark brows drawn slightly together.  “Maybe I should date again.  Absolutely.  You’re right, ah, absolutely right.”
Miranda sat up straighter. “What money?”  She looked at her son.  “Tyler?”
John stared. “For the dealer.”
Mr Holmes helped her into her jacket. To John’s embarrassed surprise, she gave her husband a friendly pat on the backside before adding, “And I daresay so will you.”

Sherlock glared blearily as John entered the hospital room.

“Less than half a centimetre off in any direction and he would have been dead. Even so, he’s only alive because he happened to fall backwards instead of forwards and because he didn’t go into shock. I have no idea why he didn’t. We thought... I’ll be honest.”
“Yes. I never said anything.  No point.”
you to bed.”
Hell, he needed to hear from the Cromwell soon about that job.  He was rapidly turning into exactly what Mrs Hudson claimed not to be: Sherlock’s housekeeper.
He’d saved John’s life, once upon a time.
“I’m not hungry,” Sherlock declared at the sound of Ivan’s footfalls.
Sherlock shrugged. “More than once, but long ago.”
“You weren’t surprised,” said Sherlock in a level voice.
thing I needed you to do was to tell me the truth.”
Sherlock refocused on John from whatever corner of his mind palace he’d begun to retreat to. “Yes.  Of course.  I always want tea when you make it.”
She and John watched Sherlock go.  “He new on the force?” she asked.
Apparently at a loss, Sherlock looked at John, who stepped forward.  “We apologize for having bothered you at this time, Mr Stevens.  The information you’ve given us will further our investigation.  Is there anyone we can call for you?”
Dexter surprised him by retorting stubbornly, “He’s not that bad. He’s kind, he can be charming...”
“Oh, that’s odd.   She’s standing to his right.  He’s holding his wrist horizontal and slightly out from his body, almost like – a barrier?  And...  Sherlock can you enlarge this?”
“It’s almost five.”
Eventually Mycroft got rid of the minions and John got rid of Mycroft before Sherlock inflicted any more physical damage on his brother. John couldn’t say that he himself was sorry to see Mycroft in pain.
Ivan looked at Sherlock, curious.
Sherlock stared. Then he smiled, a young and open smile.  “Amazing,” he said.
hearts, both crimson red, beating in time with each other.
you’re still interested.”
“It’s amusing to listen to you gather all the facts in your hands and still be unable to arrange them in a way that makes any kind of sense,” Sherlock sneered.
“And then it would be good if you could distract the guards while I let myself into the keep,” said Sherlock seriously.
Their plane landed in the midst of a grey drizzle.  Welcome home to Britain.
At which point Toby and Archie made gagging faces and chanted, “Ock, ock, ock, ock!” in unison until thankfully interrupted by a knock at the door.
He would have offered Sherlock his thigh to thrust against, but the height difference made that awkward.  He remembered himself at fifteen, though, and when they were finally forced to draw apart slightly for the sake of breathing, he reached down and gently ran his hand along Sherlock’s length.  Sherlock dropped his face against Ivan’s neck and
He removed one guard’s sword hand at wrist and sliced the tendons behind another guard’s knees, but his vision was growing dark around the edges.  He made a desperate lunge at a third guard – and stumbled forward and fell to his knees as his target vanished before his eyes.  Immediately he forced himself to his feet and turned to confront his foes, only to discover a pile of clothing, boots, chainmail, swords and branches lying scattered upon the ground.
Tyler swallowed. “Because I was supposed to go there on Ms Desimone’s off days, like the weekends.  So I knew when Mum heard the phone messages, she’d ask me if I’d gone and if everything looked okay, and then she’d go look herself.  I wanted it to look... right.”
“And what did you discover on your return?”
“And your girlfriend.”
“John, have you got photos of both tattoos on your phone, the previous one and this one?”
“Of course you do. You call it ‘forgetting’ and you do it all the time. The only difference is that
“I’ll be
Mike was already pushing through the door, announcing, “Sherlock!  Someone looking for you.”
“Is that why you talked Foucault into having the charges against Tyler dropped?”
“They’re still eating... Oh!  Here we go.  She says she’s feeling dizzy.  He sounds alarmed.  She’s standing up...  Chair fell over...”
“All right, so what’s the hyper thing you mentioned?”
“Where he over-exerted himself, hence the heart attack,” suggested Lestrade.
“The man in the grey-checked shirt towards the end of the bar has been staring at you the entire evening. He’s not drunk or unintelligent, just very awkward with women he finds attractive.  Also, he’s unbonded.  You’ll have to start the conversation, but you’ve already demonstrated that’s not a problem for you.  John?”
“My condolences to both you and your children,” said John.
John looked Sherlock in the eyes.  “You didn’t call New Scotland Yard, did you?  You dialed a number that you knew would be answered with a recorded message and faked a conversation.  One of my mates in Canada told me about his kids doing that.”
Sally Donovan glared and lifted a radio to her mouth.  “Freak’s here.  Bringing him in.”
“I took that to mean that you wanted me to make the decision.”
“You what?”
“Is this your idea of subtlety, Stolitsky?”
When he reached the top of the well, the rope stiffened and held him steady as he climbed out, shivering as the cold night air raised goose bumps on his wet skin.  But the fire wrapped around him, warm and caressing, stroking and soothing and then not soothing at all as it wrapped around his hips, close and hot and intimate.  He thrust forward into it, unable to help himself, and the flames chuckled and whispered his name, vanyavanyavanyushhhhhhka, and he thrust again...
.  You just couldn’t stomach the cost.”
“Why?  You’re at least capable of taking a simple message.  The killer will give you a time and place to meet.  Pass the information on to me.”
“Your turn, Greg.”
“Nom de dieu,” Foucault said again, softly. His eyes were bright, as if with unshed tears.  “Then it is over.”
“Who’s she?”
Campbell-Williams frowned. “You think that he’s come all this way to London to ask for money and have me tell him ‘no’ in person?”
He answered the phone anyway. “Why didn’t you just... No, I’m not... That was
“You should. You become irritable when you don’t have sex frequently enough.”
ever stay dead anymore? Did they have to worry about Magnussen or even Moriarty reappearing?
“Oh. I didn’t know that it was twice.”
Sherlock put the notebook down and ran his torch along the shelves.  He frowned at one shelf placed at waist height but hardly a hand’s breadth above the shelf beneath it.  “There was something Wilson wanted convenient to hand but not in plain sight.”  He passed the torch to John, reached into the narrow gap with his gloved hands and withdrew a large flat box of finely worked wood, which he opened.  The box proved to contain yet more precision jeweller’s tools.
by bringing them to me?  Can you imagine?”
“If you’d wanted me to keep my eyes closed, you should have kept yours open.  What were you thinking of?  It made you...”
Sherlock pulled away just far enough for John to see his face. He’d looked less drugged when he was on morphine.
“You let me know when you find out, Johnnie!”  Bill’s brief attempt at jocularity died swiftly.  They sat drinking in silence for a few moments.
my family out for a case of untreated anaphylaxis. Find out who the deceased’s GP was, get a list of known allergies and compare it to her stomach contents. She tried a new place today for her mid-morning latte and scone. Either she forgot to ask about ingredients – which is unlikely, she was attentive to her own medical issues to the point of hypochondria – or the server failed to give her complete information. In any event,
But Mary refused to back down. “No, this never would have happened if you’d managed to come to terms with what Sherlock did for you.”
“Don’t sorcerers sleep?”
thanking Lestrade for letting go.  “I never heard of this Wilson bloke, and I didn’t know there was a pawnshop ‘round there until the copper said there was.”
She and Andreyev began to move off.  After a moment, Ivan followed them.  He stopped, however, when he caught sight of one of the blazes he’d left.  “I’m going this way,” he said, motioning to his left, “You can come with me or not.”
?”  Sherlock was all but stamping his feet.
Once the tsarevna became qualified to succeed to the throne, the tsarevich applied to his father for permission to join the imperial forces.  Moreover, he begged to be allowed to join not as a high officer but as a mere captain, that he might prove himself to the troops and win their loyalty on his own merit.  The tsar indulgently gave his permission, and the tsarevich left the same day to join the forces at war in the mountains along the southern border.
Sherlock’s voice was bitter and angry.  It almost sounded as he were angry at the captives themselves.  But Marfa Hudovna said softly, “It hurt.  It hurt each time.  We instituted tests for those who could pass them.  And we tried to warn the others away.”
The concierge ignored him.  “No call for him to be taking up space here when there’s others who need it more.  Here.”
“No,” said Sherlock drily, “I ensured it.”
John hired her.
It was clear that the company was going no further that day, so they camped a second night in the same place.  When they ate supper, Sara went to the grave and set some bread and an apple down on a kerchief next to the grieving woman, but it seemed doubtful that she would eat.
, Sherlock the arsehole said, “John’s my husband.  I need to see the samples of the particulate matter you found in the corpses’ nostrils.”
“...forensics?”
“Which you refused to give.”
Sherlock frowned and seemed to be about to speak, but John was addressing Mary, who’d lowered her chin.
And yet.
Takes one to know one, as they say.
“Yeah, the uncle’s in his late sixties, has a heart condition and is in the early stages of mild dementia, on medication for both conditions. No other family except Caustlin and her teen-aged son.  He has his own flat.  A caregiver comes in three times a week to fix meals, keep the place clean and make sure he’s okay.  Caustlin does the same thing on the caregiver’s off days.  Actually, it sounded as if she comes by pretty much every day, but she specifically asked her son to visit on the caregiver’s off days while she was gone.”
The forest that rose on the other side was bridge was dark and deep, the road a mere track that ran between the trees.  No wind blew there, no birds sang, no small animals scampered among the fallen leaves and branches.  It was so silent that Ivan found himself straining to hear
Mrs Hudson could be heard announcing that she was going up there, hip or no hip.

one was shot rather messily in the abdomen. The tattoo was almost certainly applied after death.”
“Depends, love. How hard would I have to try?”
Sherlock glared. “You have ten minutes, John, no more.”  He flounced out of the room.
“None found on the scene. We should be able to extract one bullet from Magnussen’s skull and the other from, well, Sherlock.”
“We’re not calling her Cetacea,” he declared instead.
“It wasn’t the Union of British Republics that abandoned us.  It

“Mornin’, doctor,” he said with a broad grin. “Missus Morstan said I was to give this only to you. Right into yer ‘ands, she said. An’ she also said if I ‘ad to wait, Missus ‘udson might feed me.”
“I’m sorry,” John offered as they shook hands, “I don’t remember...”
“Like Lestrade’s. Campbell-Williams separated from her spouse – who

“No. You also don’t like it when I use cocaine.”

Sherlock started to smile. “Madeleine Virginie Lake Holmes.
“It was her off day! You said don’t bother her on her off days!”
“Quite. Foucault has worked on and off in the field of chromochemistry throughout his life.  However, he didn’t appear to be making any great progress until he met Campbell-Williams at a conference in the States three years before she returned to the UK.  Following that meeting, the entire direction of his research changed.  In the next paper he published, he gave credit to Campbell-Williams for her assistance.  In the next paper after that, published shortly before she left the States, she was listed as a co-author.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulder and clung to him, staring into his eyes. “John? John. I couldn’t tell you.” He grimaced in pain. “You had to be shown. But Mary did save my life.”
...And woke in the dark shed, very happy
,” Sherlock whined.
“John,” said Sherlock from the doorway. John wondered how long he’d been standing there. “We’re leaving now.”

John had never in his life felt so much like shooting something, and that included his time in Afghanistan.
that this is not the work pro-bond extremists.”
Ivan nudged Sherlock’s back and muttered, “Talk!”  He moved slightly sideways, more directly behind Sherlock, the better to hide his actions from Muircheartaigh’s view, and fumbled for the looking glass on its cord around his neck.
“Hmmm?”
It seemed to him that as he walked, he saw more people with black wristbands than he used to. Or perhaps he just noticed them more.  Before he’d married, his eyes had been drawn to the silver wristbands of the unbonded and sometimes to the gold wristbands of (presumably) happy couples.  Now he saw black-banders everywhere and found himself wondering about the gold-banders he noticed.  How many were like Harry, Greg, Campbell-Williams?
He squared his shoulders and marched back downstairs.
Once upon a time there was a vast empire inhabited by many different peoples who spoke many different tongues.  Thus, its ruler was known by many of his subjects as Tsar Watt Yakovlevich, by many others as Emperor Watt Jameson and by some – who lived mainly in the mountains in the north and west of the country – as Bhatair mac Sheumais àrd-righ.
beautiful and amazing.  Now he was ash and burnt bone.
“I didn’t know where Sherlock was, but I’d always... had the means to send him a message.”
“We accept.”
The next day started bright and early when John woke to sound of loud footsteps on the stairs.  He barely paused to pull on his jeans before heading out into the sitting room, arriving just as Lestrade entered hauling Billy Wiggins by one shoulder.  Through the open door, John could hear both the indignant voices of Billy’s mother and grandaunt and the irreverent comments of his younger siblings.
Sherlock was already home when John arrived.  The mess in the sitting room had acquired a new layer of books, all opened to specific pages, as well as some new file folders, one of which Sherlock was studying.
“The last one was an execution of a disloyal gang member,” Lestrade said, “so I’m thinking...”
Right, thought Ivan, and got ready to die fighting, however awkwardly.
“Thank you.”
, didn’t you?”
Nigel grimaced.  “Old ball and chain, eh, Johnny?  Keep in touch, then.”
. No, don’t answer that. Say ahhhh...”
, that John was
“Thanks, Suzanne. Hello?”
“I was trying to protect you!”
“I don’t mean that betas shouldn’t be able to do all sorts of jobs,” Mary replied somewhat cautiously. “But there’s no arguing that they have a harder time than alphas and omegas. It’s an out-dated attitude, but not one that will change overnight.”
“I’m fine, John,” replied Sherlock, rubbing the back of his head. “However, Lestrade is about to remind you that Tyler is both a civilian
John gave Sherlock’s cock another squeeze and then continued to stroke it with one hand while still fingering Sherlock’s teats with the other.
The second day passed much like the first, except that the hills rose and became true mountains.  The wind that blew down from them carried a scent of ice and pine.  Again, Ivan made camp for the night.  Again, he did not dream.
“Why?” John asked suspiciously.
Mary held his hand while he stood at Sherlock’s grave. Then she took him home, curled around him and let him hold her in turn, let him retain the illusion of his alpha pride even when they both knew who was comforting whom. He kissed her neck. He kissed her lips. Neither of them commented on the wet spots his tears left behind on her skin.
Right, never mind.
Within moments, Sherlock and Molly were completely focused on a large microscope, arguing over similarities – many, apparently – and differences between the particulate matter found in Molly’s corpses’ nostrils and that found in Sherlock’s.  Both appeared to have forgotten John entirely, so it was a something of a relief when Mike reappeared at the door with another man in tow.
Sherlock allowed John to pull him to his feet and then headed off to the bedroom, weaving ever so slightly but graceful despite his fatigue.  John turned out the lights and followed, pausing in the loo to brush his teeth.  By the time he entered the bedroom, Sherlock was already under the covers, lying along the edge of the bed on his left side so that his back would be to John.  His dressing gown lay flung out over the foot of the bed.
everything I knew and could learn.
“And don’t try telling me that Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
“We thought he had died on the table. He’d flatlined. We were getting ready to sign off. And then... His heart monitor blipped. And did it again and then again and we got back to work and were able to stabilize him. Dr Watson, I’m a doctor and a scientist. I don’t believe in miracles, but what happened in that operating room...”
“There were several minor incidents,” Sherlock replied calmly. “I presume you’re referring to the scars on my back.”
Staying angry had become a losing battle. “It’s the same thing, Sherlock, don’t you see?  Not telling me about your plan before you jumped.  Not telling me about... other things.  Not trusting me to make my own choices.”
“At the time of the Revolution, Mycroft...”
“But it’s Mrs Hudson’s favourite.”
John made it up to his own room, tried and failed not to think about what Sherlock might be doing one floor below and came all over his own sheets the moment he touched himself.
As crime scenes went, this one was noticeable for the absence of a corpse and the abundance of graffiti, far more than one would expect to find in a university research laboratory. There was also a good deal of smashed glassware and electronic equipment lying about.  Lestrade stood talking with two people in white lab coats, one a greying dark-haired man who looked to be in his sixties and the other a fortyish woman with blonde hair pulled back in a messy ponytail.
“So,” said John, “You have a megfriend?”
Foucault sighed. “By temperament, yes.  And also, she does not understand the complexities of experimenting on living beings, especially living human beings.  You know about the incident in Germany?”
.  The researchers can get more copies.”
Sherlock went out to see Lestrade’s betologist and returned quite pleased, with reams of notes indecipherable to anyone but himself, not because they were encrypted but because Sherlock’s handwriting was just that bad.
“Oho!”  Angelo gave them a broad wink.  “Good luck to both of you!”  As he turned away, Sherlock rose from his seat.
“Sherlock, there are people eating here!” scolded Mrs Hudson, although the children looked rather appreciative.
And consider the fact that we distinguish ourselves from marsupials as placental mammals even though marsupials do have placentas, albeit not as highly developed as ours.  Thus from marsupial!Sherlock’s POV, our placentas are hyperplasic.  Yeah, I stole that term from my oncologist.  Hear me: I regret nothing.
Ivan stared back, feeling as if he stood at the brink of a precipice.  The false tsarevich had ridden from the capital on a false quest to discover and defeat the sorcerer who had cast the curse, but what had been meant as a cover story had suddenly become real.  It was Ivan who stood here now, faced with a potential ally stranger than anything he could have imagined.
“Name and room number both. Have you got a bit of paper?”
“That’s up to you.  The guards will never notice me.”
George “Georgie Boy” Jones was an ex-con with a small tattooing business and a megfriend who ran a gambling ring. Neither of them were happy when her oncoming heat brought them home from the pub at a relatively early hour only to discover Sherlock and John searching their flat. When George panicked and began to spill a tale about a routine debt collection visit gone wrong, Minnie the meg pulled a gun out of her copious cleavage and pointed it at Sherlock. John distracted her by shooting the wall behind her, Sherlock jumped her in an attempt to retrieve her gun and then George – a big man, but a bit slow – tried to jump Sherlock but landed on Minnie instead.
They used contraceptives, of course, as they obviously weren’t ready for a child with just the two of them. Still, one morning three weeks after the end of Mary’s heat, John noticed a discarded home pregnancy test in the bathroom bin. Mary was apparently taking no chances. John thought it might be time for the discussion he’d been meaning to have.
“Can you tell if the tattoo was done before or after death?”
“Splinters of glass and plastic. I sent them for analysis of any residues.”
“Very good, John. She earned her doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and shortly after married David Wentworth, who’d just published a best-selling novel.  Unfortunately, his later novels failed to achieve the same success.  Five years ago, Campbell-Williams returned to the UK.  Less than two years later, Wentworth began to be seen frequently in the company of up-and-coming photographer Cheyenne Paul.”
Sherlock merely shrugged. “Mrs Hudson has her moments of intelligence.”
“Two sugars.  And yet all three of them did.”
“Look, that’s not... I mean, I agree with you, but he and I aren’t...”
John nodded, thinking about it. “But that can change.”
“Boring. The body in the canal wasn’t the one the police were looking for, which in turn wasn’t the one they
Sherlock glanced down at the paper. “Miranda Caustlin’s telephone number.  I’ve only ever seen you date women, and you seemed interested.”
John turned to see an overweight man approaching.  Brown hair, brown eyeglasses, white coat.
“Are you proposing to come with us and shoot back?” Sherlock retorted.
“Laptop!” said John.
John called Mrs Hudson on the unlikely chance that Sherlock turned up at Baker Street. Then he tried calling Mycroft but failed to get past Anthea.
of the blood?”
“I mean that you tell me I’m amazing because you’re dazzled by my deductive brilliance.”
The woman in purple entered with a steaming pot on a tray.  “Sherlock, you should have told me your husband was coming!  I would have baked something nice.”  And then to John, “Martha Hudson.  I’m so glad to meet you.”
Sherlock shifted, turning to face John more directly, pressed against him from chest to crotch now and there was no mistaking what John had done to Sherlock. And vice versa.
“Oh, hell, I was supposed to tell you that first, wasn’t I?” Her obvious dismay made John laugh and then he couldn’t stop laughing and then he was sitting down and someone had got him some more horrible coffee.
The man shrugged.  “Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?”
“Arrrrgggghhhh.”
John took a deep breath and began.  “When I was thirteen, my father was given tickets to a performance by the Royal Ballet, a thank-you gift from a customer.  We all went – Da, Mum, Harry and I.  I’d never been before and to be honest, didn’t expect much from it.  I’d begun to notice girls, though, so I figured there’d at least be pretty ballerinas to look at.”
John shrugged again.  “Won’t give me my surgical career back.”
Lestrade sighed. “Technically, it’s a police investigation and I shouldn’t be telling you anything. Unless... When’s the last time you saw Sherlock?”
“Does the UBR have television?” asked John.
“Not so familiar.  Did he offer you money to spy on me?”
, but uncharacteristically silent as John limped by with his kit bag.
“It’s not so much that. It’s just – when have you ever known me to

“No, because you’d never have told me.

“You want to compare them.”

with your sister’s artist, although I’d want to see samples of this person’s work first.  And we also might get completely undressed, because we look rather ridiculous at the moment.”
“Enjoy your dessert, John,” Sherlock drawled. His eyes were mirthful as he sipped his coffee.
“Not a problem. Thanks for helping with the phone.”
“It’s a one-patch problem, doctor,” purred the posh baritone.
exactly, that wasn’t fair, but whatever it was, it was
She stared at him and then shrugged, obviously having reached her weirdness quota for the day. “He’s the recovery area for monitoring, then he’ll be moved to a private room. You can see him –
“Not always, love.  Not that night.  But when I said you were amazing,
“I haven’t bothered turning either of them back on again.” Sherlock’s smile held of touch of wickedness. “My work and I have the night off. We’re on a date.”
“Took you long enough. John, will you check dilation?”
Despite occasional twinges of pain and stiffness in his shoulder, Ivan found himself the most able-bodied member of the company.  He enjoyed the easy walking in the pleasant weather.  He slept soundly at night, his sword close to hand and the case containing Sherlock’s heart tucked in against his chest.  Ivan’s dreams played themselves out to the lub-dub of the heart’s steady beat, but he never remembered the details in the morning.
Sherlock pouted.
Oh! “And I did.”
commoner who’ll figure out how to lift this curse, if there
“Well done!” Sherlock’s tone was genuinely warm, and Molly smiled.
Hours later, after John had promised Lestrade that they’d be in to give their statements the next morning and Sherlock had vehemently denied that his slashed arm required the A&E, John found himself ensconced with Sherlock in a cab, returning to Baker Street. Once upon a time he would already have been thinking ahead to how he would write this adventure up in his blog, reviewing the evening’s events, making sure he had the details correct...
“Except for him. I can’t justify keeping a protective guard on Sherlock much longer.”
When Sherlock handed John a pair of latex gloves, John indicated his own coverall.  “Aren’t you gonna put one on?”
John had barely joined Sherlock on the pavement when Sherlock hailed another ride for them.
“There is, actually. What have you got in the way of cold cases?”
“I’ll tell them
Smirking, the detective did so.
But the student who burst into the room wasn’t carrying a telegram.  “Watson!  Two blokes here to see you!”
Lestrade merely rolled his eyes. “Glad to hear Himself’s up to his usual form.”
to talk about it. Is... Is this visit a problem? Because we can get off at the next station and buy tickets back to London.”
The concierge stared at him as if the bus itself had spoken, but she gave his name to the person who answered the phone.  “No, I won’t be put on hold.  Yes, I know I have to wait, but every time you people put me on hold, the call gets terminated.  Yes, fine, I’ll wait.”
Sherlock looked at the bedroom door as it closed behind her and then back at John. “You’re angry.”
Ivan took a deep breath and squared his shoulders.  “It seems silly to come all this way and not at least try.  Mind, betray me and I’ll break both your wings.  So how are we getting through this gate?”
“It sounds irresistible,” replied Ivan in a dry tone, but when Sherlock glanced at him in question, he smiled and shook his head.  “Sherlock, I followed you to Muircheartaigh’s castle and then I followed you back here
“Uh, no, sir.”
“Actually, your testimony agrees with the information I’ve received from the university. They’ve been unable to identify any specific item as missing.  Everything is accounted for by the debris your granduncle left behind in the lab.  Lestrade, you’d have a difficult time proving burglary.”
More silence while Blond-beard tugged thoughtfully on the end of his beard.  “That sounds about right,” he allowed.
Smiling to himself, John began the trip home, stopping at Tesco’s as he neared Baker Street. Milk, bread.  The Weetabix that Sherlock sometimes ate, milkless and drizzled with honey.  Hmmm, better get some honey as well.  And eggs, because Sherlock would sometimes eat those if John cooked them.
Bloody hell, it wasn’t as if he hadn’t already seen most of Sherlock’s body already, at least from the hips up and the thighs down. He’d spent enough time patching the man up after various misadventures.  He knew that Sherlock carried scars from Mary’s bullet and from the surgery he’d needed afterwards.  Other scars on Sherlock’s back suggested that he’d been beaten.  John knew those hadn’t been there before Sherlock went hunting down the remains of Moriarty’s empire.
John lost his fight.
John was a stranger, reaching for John’s belt...
Ivan blinked, surprised.
“Yes, but I turned it off for the concert, of course.”
The silver-blue eyes snapped open again. “That’s not... oh.” Sherlock’s voice trailed off as John stroked the bite marks on Sherlock’s neck.
John left for the clinic on the 2
The smile vanished.  “Don’t be an idiot,” Sherlock snapped.  “I can’t escape him – or his ‘favours.’  That doesn’t mean I trust him.  And the fact that he approves of you as my... companion doesn’t mean
“Too early for a client,” proclaimed Billy.  And then to Archie, “Betcha five shillings it’s that copper fellow Lestrade.”
the medications made his stomach hurt, Mr Caustlin, or was there one in particular he avoided taking?”
“Good luck to him.  Or her, as the case may be.”  John had scrolled through another few posts – there was no apparent character limit and some were quite lengthy – when a thought struck him.  From the look of the flat, Sherlock had already been living here for some time before John showed up.  Why hadn’t he already had a flatmate?  Of course he could have just lost one, but John had seen no signs of anyone else living here recently.
the point you were about to enquire on.”
, Sherlock. Here you go, Greg!”
“Irene? It can’t be. She’s...” – oh hell, Sherlock didn’t know the truth – “...er, in a witness protection program in America.”
Ah.  As clumsy as a youth of fifteen with his first lover.  When Sherlock started to draw back, Ivan placed his hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck, feeling those curls brush against his knuckles, and tugged forward once, gently, prepared to release Sherlock immediately if the hint was not taken.  But Sherlock bent his mouth to Ivan’s again quite willingly and just as willingly let Ivan guide the kiss, slotting their lips together.
But Sherlock said only, “You’ll need the black feather.”
And if that didn’t sound maudlin and self-pitying, John didn’t know what did. Christ, he should know better than to get into this sort of conversation this late at night.  A couple of drinks, a run through the streets, a little physical danger and the next thing you know, you’re sitting in a cab pouring your heart out to Sherlock Holmes.
“Not in public, Sherlock!” John was fighting not to laugh. “Mr Chhapyian will throw us out!”
“Someone murdered the lord?” asked Svinarnikov.  It struck Ivan that neither Svinarnikov nor Sara Dmitrievna appeared to have heard this tale before.
to. That makes more sense, because I can’t imagine who’d want an underweight cocaine addict with an attitude problem to carry their children.”
“Also sloppy.  The keep itself?”
But they’d gotten better at this, at everything really. John wanted the chance to get better yet. He wanted to pat Sherlock’s arse when he was eighty and embarrass their children. He wanted everything Sherlock was willing to give. The pleasure that Sherlock was giving him right this moment was just the beginning.
John’s simmering temper was getting near the boiling point.  “Look here...”
“Spasibo,” muttered Ivan as he knelt to nurse the fledgling fire into full growth.  When he looked up again, Sherlock was still there, crouching awkwardly with his clawed feet splayed on the ground and the tips of his wings and tail dragging in the dirt.  Ivan studied his profile in the firelight.  Sherlock had said he’d been to the castle before.  Why?  What had drawn him here?  Ivan suspected that a direct attack would get him nowhere.
“No, of course you wouldn’t,” said John fondly, feeling the burn of the scotch in his stomach. He was far from being even tipsy.  He just felt... pleasant.  The music was pleasant, the club’s atmosphere was pleasant, even Sherlock’s disregard of personal space was pleasant.  It had been a while since he’d felt this sort of uncomplicated happiness.
“And phones you.”
Sherlock had stopped writing and was addressing Caustlin. “Ms Caustlin, I’m implying nothing at all.  I’m merely asking questions, and I have only one left.  What colour was the new windcheater you bought Tyler recently?”
John kept his voice calm.  “This is very clever and all, but whatever you have to say, you could have said it on the phone.”
“Some kind of doctor, I thought, except it turned out not exactly. Dr...  Uh, I’m sorry.”  Tyler’s face reddened.  “It sounded like fuck all.”
was true.  Still is.”
“He does appear to be fairly intelligent,” replied Sherlock, equally deadpan.
“Impeccable technique, paired with fiery passion, poetry and sensitivity” sounded like it might do the trick.
“Amateur medics especially.  One fellow seemed to think that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was an appropriate treatment for shock.”
“But you wanted to live.  Most living beings do.  It’s not a crime, Sherlock.”
Lestrade looked up sharply.  “Who’s this?”
“Bit of a domestic, was there?”
Six and a half hours after Mary thumped on the ceiling, she asked, “What have you two come up with for names?”
The Prospect of Whitby was pleasantly busy rather than over-crowded.  John ordered a pint of the beer with the most wear on the tap handle, paid for it and planted himself at the bar, keeping one eye on the door and the other eye on Sherlock.  Sherlock was further down the bar, talking with a man who looked a bit like a younger Christopher Lee.  He was about Sherlock’s height but with a heavier build, dressed in a dark trousers and a coat whose high collar recalled a cassock.
The left hand bore distinct red smudges along the outer edge as expected. In addition...
They both stopped playing.
This time the look on Sherlock’s face was definitely amusement.  “Problem?”
“As bent as my sister, I’m afraid. The only time I’ve known her to show interest in anyone on the alpha/omega spectrum, it was an alpha disguising himself with beta body wash.”
Sherlock gave John an approving nod and reassured their landlady.  “We’re all right, Mrs Hudson.  It’s just Mycroft sticking his fat nose in where it doesn’t belong again.”
“Don’t bother.”
“Haven’t we got past tedious introductions yet?”
“I do well enough, dear.  Friends like Mariya Tobyevna send me gifts.”  Then she looked thoughtful.  “But some things
“I saw that,” John interjected grimly.
John woke up the next morning alone, which was definitely
of us to get clear, you mean.”
“Correct.  In all of the posts the writer references both the past and current occupations of the target.  However, although only Wilson was a jeweller, all the posts mention jewels.  What do you know about the Crown Jewels, John?”
He felt as if he ought to say something.  “Good night, Sherlock.”
“No... No, wait. Lestrade said something about Sussex?”
pool.”
“No, I’m not.  I’m just not interested.”
“Sherlock gave me the gold feather to set fires around the keep.  It’s been very useful, but perhaps...”  She bit her lip, obviously not fond of the idea of giving away the gold feather.
The tiramisu was delicious.
Mrs Hudson reappeared with a plate of biscuits and negotiated the steps with hardly any more than trouble than John, who perforce moved further into the flat in order to stop blocking the doorway. Having felt that he’d finally arrived, he set his bag down. She bustled past him and set the plate on the coffee table, announcing, “I’ll just make us all some tea, shall I?”
, these young megs living on the streets and getting into trouble and having nowhere to turn. I just hope that you and Sherlock have thought this through completely. There’s such a risk of the child being born with an addiction or fetal alcohol syndrome or some such thing! Well, you’re a doctor, I’m sure you’ll know how to handle it. Do let me know if you’d like me to babysit. Not all the time, mind you, but I wouldn’t mind once in a while. And I
“To the point where he might have tried to follow Sherlock around at one time or another?” John persisted.
“Sherlock, wait.” When Sherlock made to continue, Ivan grabbed him by one wing.  “Wait just a minute!  What Muircheartaigh said, about you and Victor...”
“I’ll leave the gun home then, shall I?”
“And beta?” Mary finished with a grin. “That’s the best way to find your own match, didn’t you know? Look for one for someone else.”
“Oh!” said Manya again, and turned even pinker.  “That’s me.  Misha, did he, uh...”
“Sorry to bother you,” John offered.  “I was told that Sherlock Holmes lives here?”
“Mine is in my bedroom.”
“Wait, stop,” said John. “We’re getting off-track. Mary, you’re what? Two and a half months along?”
“No.”
Setting these on the counter, he opened the refrigerator to see if they had any milk.  And slammed the refrigerator shut again.
“Mary is teaching me...”
“There’s a guest violinist. Vadim Repin.”
The air steward busied himself with cups, cans, bottles.  Laughter rang out from one of the seats ahead of John.  He and the steward both glanced towards it.
The woman talked right over him.  “Come inside, then, and go right up the stairs.  I’m fairly sure he’s in.  Oh, you’ve got a cane!  I know what that’s like, I’ve got a hip, myself.  Just leave your bags inside there, then, they’ll be perfectly safe.  Go on, up with you!”
“I wouldn’t worry. I doubt Wiggins knows how to shoot.”
“I told Janine about the dancing, at the wedding.”
“The bond colour research guy?”
“Thank you for that, but there’s a wide sea between me and my homeland – and judging by your speech, between you and yours as well.  Gospozha Usacheva won’t be pleased to learn that we’ve left the price of passage by ship behind us just because you were in a hurry.”
“I decided no such thing,” retorted Sherlock. “He was supposed to be out to dinner with the Marketing Group of Great Britain from seven ’til ten.”
Sherlock picked up a spoon, studied it and opened his mouth to speak, but John cut him off. “This wasn’t my idea! Angelo came up with this on his own.”
“I noticed your black wristbands, see, and I just wanted to say...”
“Drug manufacture and use.  You’re obviously wondering how much of Anderson’s babbling was the truth.”
“They run a homeless shelter and also help people who’ve been living in the shelter find more permanent places to stay and get settled in. As a result, they have an ongoing need for donations of household goods. Anything their clients can’t use they can probably sell in their thrift shop.”
“You’re joking.”
“Right, well, I was just about to put the kettle on myself,” John offered.
told him about Victor, had been open on that point at least.
After twelve days on the road, they crested one final hill and looked down to see the port lying spread before them.  The wind suddenly carried a trace of salt.  Ivan saw Bezmolva raise her head and take a deep breath, a light coming into her eyes that had not been there before.
“No, she didn’t.  That’s what’s a bit strange.  After all, it’s not...  it’s not
“Banks is primarily a loan shark. It’s almost certain that Wentworth owes him money.  Curran and Ives, on the other hand, are middlemen.  Get in, get the job done, get out, get paid.  They’ve done a bit of everything, but murder’s not their usual style.  Kidnapping would be, or extortion.”
time, it was years ago and my financial resources were more restricted than they are now... Yes, he’s here... Fine!”
“Yes, at his suggestion,” snapped John. “Because even Sherlock could see that I couldn’t” – couldn’t handle, couldn’t deal with – “couldn’t be bothered to deal with it.”
Shortly past noon on the third day, Ivan came to a river, not too wide but deep, fast and cold, running southwards.  The road crossed it on a bridge made of stone, beautifully engineered and adorned with carved sculptures and inscriptions.  Time, however, had blurred the carvings, rendering them unrecognizable.  The few that Ivan could make out looked strange and foreign to him.  It was not his own people who had built this bridge.
“Rather impatient, isn’t she?” remarked Sherlock.
“No marks, you two!” warned Janine, “I’ve got to work!”
Lestrade’s grip on Tyler’s arm was firm, but his voice was curiously gentle. “Tyler Caustlin, I arrest you on charges of criminal damage and burglary.”
Sherlock’s navel... Oh. Oh,
Lestrade swore, fished out his mobile and put a call in for a forensics team. Sherlock was already back-tracking his way along the alley, following the alleged thief’s escape route. “He jumped, landed, he was running, cut around the first corner – oh!  Lestrade!”

Mary peered back in John’s direction and started to laugh.
The telly had moved on as well and was now broadcasting the results of the latest sports matches.
It was only when John was pulling on his trousers that he remembered the pen drive, still in the pocket. Grimacing, he took it out and tossed it onto his dresser before heading downstairs.

“Certainly, Mrs Hudson. Uh, I’ve got to...” John indicated the bags.
“Most likely pretending to be an Anglican priest.  Like many other religious sects, the Anglican Church used incense to create a sense of sacred space.”
John winced, but Dexter surprised him by straightening and smiling wryly. “You’re telling me to learn from what happened and move on.”
“Internal nose plugs made of soft silicone.  They’re almost invisible to the outside observer unless you know what you’re looking for.  They’re not easy to obtain, but neither is
“Alas,” said Ivan with mock gravity, “My sister’s eyes have long been drawn to other women.”
“No, thanks, it’s getting late for... Oh. Ah, Sherlock? The coffee part of dating protocols can be... Well. It’s really just an excuse to sit next to each other on the sofa.”
“Then you definitely don’t want that one. One, it’s poorly constructed. It won’t last a year. Two, it’s poorly designed. You’ll never use most of the features simply because they’re a pain in the arse to access.”
“Mary.”
Sherlock frowned slightly, obviously not seeing why this would be an issue. “You never said anything worth responding to.”
They didn’t talk during the ride home.
“Shut the door as tightly as you can,” Sherlock ordered.
After he’d seen to Bezimyan, Ivan studied the pile of logs sitting at one side of the yard.  It was a good-size pile, but the logs were too large for Marfa Hudovna’s woodstove.  He found an axe in the barn, already sharpened, and set to work trimming and splitting the logs into manageable pieces.  Between his leg and his shoulder, it was awkward, difficult work, but he kept at it doggedly, taking breaks to pile the wood against the house so that it would be convenient for Marfa Hudovna.
“We can’t afford to have Mrs Hudson spot her while she’s running up and down the stairs, so she’ll have to stay in my – in
“And I promised I’d get you there on time,” sighed Dexter, detaching himself from Sherlock with obvious reluctance and holding the door for Janine.
“Enthusiasm does not necessarily imply competence,” muttered Sherlock darkly.
“Huh. Was he hiding the client from you or you from the client?” Lestrade asked shrewdly.
let that happen.
“You’ll be so huge you won’t be able to see your own cock. I’ll get down between your legs and you won’t be able to see what I’m going to do next. I’ll use my hands and my mouth, I’ll touch you
John shrugged.  “As sure as I can be.”
“And neck.”
“Did you take it?”
Another woman fell on bread so ravenously that Svinarnikov had to restrain her from jamming the entire piece into her mouth at once.  She babbled nonsensically and continuously, her mouth open as she chewed.
Thud. Thud.
“Perhaps she didn’t want to interfere in a family quarrel?”
“It was Tuesday. I made us beans on toast for supper and we were watching telly, and suddenly Uncle Don stood up and said he was going to visit someone he used to know.  He was set on it, put on his jacket and everything.  So I figured the best thing to do was to lock up the flat and go with him.”
.”  Sherlock smiled slowly.  “But you and I don’t need annoying distractions while we deal with the unfinished business between us.  Let him run away – or not, as you please.  And
“Sherlock, I’m going to take
“I can’t tell you that.”
“Oooh, look who finally decided to join the game!”
Sherlock frowned. “Was your saag gosht drugged? We wouldn’t be having this conversation if I hadn’t
“You’d get dragged off to a small room somewhere and have your head kicked in,” John agreed.
“Oh?”
, Ivan Watovich.”
,” John protested.
He couldn’t keep from smiling.  “I already know I’m not the intelligent one in this room, sister.”
Sherlock stopped them well short of the wooden fence. “There!  Don’t trample them.”  Caught in the mud next to the fence were two deep footprints, created by someone landing hard after jumping.
John inhaled deeply, trying to compose himself.  “Many young Canadian couples don’t bother, not when common-law partnership works well enough for them.  But then we found out she was pregnant.  I was going to contact the UBR embassy, see if I could do something about, er, the previous marriage.”
fired that shot and now Phelps is the corpse, not I.”
This information sorted well with Ivan’s own observations of the man – and Sara Dmitrievna’s as well, when he discussed the matter with her.
John pulled away slightly, startled. “Sorry? What makes you think he’s...”
John sighed. At least Harry sounded reasonably sober this time.  “Hello to you too, Harry.  What’s up?”
“Please,” said the father, stepping forward.  “There’s been a mistake.  We have family waiting for us in...”
“There would also have been mud on the dress shoes worn by the killer, a man of about my height but with a heavier build.”  Anderson stopped sneering.  Lestrade nodded and John grinned outright.  “And I’ll need the files for the other cases,” Sherlock went on.
“Nothing I’ve seen or heard in London frightens me,” replied John, equally low.  “That includes you and everything you’ve said.”
“Because I did, when he was in the hospital the first time.”
marriage to be to my work.”  With that, he returned to his file folder.
“It’s newly assigned, no chance of recognition.”
“It’s quite effective under certain circumstances. It certainly worked in this one. Janine made a very strange squealing noise and let me in.”
?  Wouldn’t you love to do it
“How many betas were there in your class at medical school? How many did you serve with in the army?”
was the one in control,
Ivan ignored him and lifted the beating heart gingerly from the case.  He wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but the muscle felt warm and firm beneath his fingertips.  He was reminded not so much of the stench and gore of battlefield wounds as of a young animal just born.  A newborn puppy perhaps, not able to survive on its own, requiring gentleness and care.
“Well, indeed,” Pauline replied in a softer tone.  “My Joe served with the Fifth before your time.  He was on leave when we met and started courting.  I told him I didn’t want to be an army widow raising children on her own.  He had a good record, his superiors liked him, so he managed a transfer to the... a different regiment, one stationed here in London.  He served there until the Revolution.  We opened the pub after that.”
Where a stream crossed the road, Ivan turned Bezimyan aside and rode slowly along it until he came to a patch of meadow with surrounded by trees.  Here he dismounted and made camp.  Having allowed Bezimyan to drink enough but not too much from the stream, Ivan tied him off to a tree where he might graze on meadow grass.  Ivan always carried flint and steel on his person, and fallen branches gathered from the woods made for a merry fire.
Sherlock’s silent sulk spoke volumes.
They broke apart when John tried and failed to stifle a yawn. “Time to take you home,” said Sherlock lightly. And then as they walked, “Mycroft told me where to find you that evening. Blame him if you need someone to blame. He bought me the clothes I was wearing. I binned the shirt as soon as I got home.”
“Hang on, there.  What’s that on your arm?  Those patches?”
“Ooooh, the great detective makes his deductions!” sneered Anderson.  “We all know it rained yesterday, Freak!”
And yet with all of this, her voice was calm and sure.  “My name is Sara Dmitrievna Usacheva.  Please, let me see your wound.”
“Have you seen Sherlock’s back?” she asked after a few sips.
“Sherlock didn’t bring you here, then?”
John moved to the sofa and sat down, straddling Sherlock’s hips as he got hold of the other man’s mug and set it on the coffee table. The sofa wasn’t
about it.  I love the clever ones.  They’re always so desperate to get caught.”
“We’re developing a list,” said Lestrade. He waved his hand towards a junior officer and two young women whom John assumed to be post-grads.  They’d probably been charged with the day-to-day grunt work of the project and had a better idea of where everything had been left the day before.  “Dr Campbell-Williams, this is Sherlock Holmes and his partner, Dr John Watson.  They’re...”
“I’m not sure you’re going to get much more out of him,” warned John. “Any time I’ve been to see him, he’s been more or less babbling.”
the desk.”
“Not... not right away. But these news stories started appearing more and more and, I dunno.  For some reason they drove Uncle Don spare.”
Having eaten, Ivan now found himself growing sleepy.  Part of him argued that he should try to stay awake, that Sherlock was not to be trusted, at least not completely.  But if Sherlock was working for Muircheartaigh, why had he not been able to land within the walls of the castle?  Why take the trouble to wait until Ivan was sleeping before – what, signalling to Muircheartaigh’s guards to come and capture him?  And Ivan’s options were limited.  Tomorrow he would have to either trust Sherlock while they infiltrated the castle together, trust Sherlock to carry him back – or set off alone and on foot across unknown lands and seas in an attempt to reach his distant home.
shoes.  Suddenly, John felt as if his refractory period might be rather briefer than he’d expected.
“What?” said Sherlock petulantly.
response than yours.”
“I told you I needed an assistant,” said Sherlock blandly as he traded his leather gloves for a latex pair.
Still, even psychopaths need physical outlets. John walked through the building’s front door one day just in time to hear a loud thud from upstairs. He ran the stairs and heard Sherlock complain, “It doesn’t make sense! I’m taller than you are and weigh more...”
“Did you bring a torch?”

John cleared his throat and attempted conversation. “So, ah, you three are... in a relationship?”
Outside in the foyer, a man with an Estuary accent could be heard greeting Mrs Hudson and asking if “Himself” was upstairs.  He was climbing the stairs as Mrs Hudson came back into the kitchen.

“No, of course not. Ms Desimone’s reaction is quite understandable.  What did you do after listening to the messages?”

“Pale skin, dark hair, blue eyes, cheekbones? No? That’s odd. She told me to remind Sherlock that she wants to have dinner with him.”
“Then try to get him to open up a bit, will you? I can’t do anything to help with my hands tied.”
.  Sherlock had brought John back to 221B, and John had stayed.  Sherlock had done what he could to ease John’s way with Miranda Caustlin, but John had never called her.  Sherlock Holmes, of all people, could not have withstood the growing body of evidence arguing he might eventually, finally trust John with his vulnerable heart.
But when had John stopped being able to think of Sherlock’s body strictly in medical terms, as he would any other patient’s? When had his imagination begun to insist on drawing in the unknown territory between hip and thigh?  He remembered Buckingham Palace, with Sherlock sitting close to him clad only in a sheet, but the memory kept changing.  In his imagination, Sherlock pulled a corner of the sheet aside, revealing a nicotine patch like a bizarre beauty spot on the inside of his milky-white upper thigh.
“So Banks sent Wentworth to London to meet with Curran and Ives and do... what? Act as bait to draw Campbell-Williams in?
“Tyler is your son?”
“Sherlock, Mary said that Mycroft had her under surveillance. She won’t be able to... get away.”
John started coughing at his tea went down the wrong way.  When he could breathe again, he asked, “I’ll keep that in mind if I ever start posting.  Did you find anything last night?”
“Although to be honest, I’m not sure that Toby’s native tastes are all that much different from her brothers’,” observed Sherlock.  “She simply has more motivation to prove she’s ready for adulthood by emulating her mother and grandaunt.”
“What, show him up as an idiot?  It wasn’t difficult.”
“I do hear you and thank you for your counsel... gospozha,” replied Ivan, and was pleased to see her blush and smile slightly.  Perhaps if things didn’t work out with her friend Marfa, he could come back and court Manya herself.  It wouldn’t be the worst idea.
“Madeleine Sophia Watson-Holmes,” mused Sherlock. “No. Madeleine Sophia Holmes-Watson. The rhythm’s better.”
Now she led Mrs Holmes into the bedroom she’d been using. The door shut behind them.
“We do. And so did Donald McKinsey.”
“Let me do this for you, John.”
John climbed onto the foot of the bed and then crawled up, his hands and knees bracketing Sherlock. “Hi,” he grinned, looking down.
The incision was completely closed now, its purplish-red colour fading rapidly.  Ivan bent to place the feather back into the case, but when he looked up again Sherlock was shaking, vibrating from head to toe with a rapid tremour.
child.  She left.  I don’t know where.”
“Sherlock, I think your livers are beginning to go off.”
“Oh, yes, you get right upstairs and tuck the cold things away in the refrigerator. I see that you’re getting Sherlock to eat better as well!”
the address nor the phone directories were likely to be up to date, John became completely disheartened.
“Case.  Also, I prefer honey.  Shower... you may be correct.”  Sherlock reached up, ran his fingers through his hair and then sniffed at them.  As he did so, his dressing gown sleeve fell back.
“My heart.  You obviously came to return it.”
After his shower, Sherlock emerged from the bedroom in pyjamas and a dressing gown.  He made it halfway through a mug of tea before he ran out of steam and John caught him yawning.
The driver took a deep breath.  “Right, then, I apologize.  But look, he’s on
He lay awake in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, trying to work it out. How does one find Sherlock Holmes in London?
Molly fidgeted nervously under his gaze.  “It wasn’t working for me.”
“Mr Caustlin,” said Lestrade mildly, “I’m going to have to ask you speak up.”
“I know that!” Sherlock snarled. “Molly Hooper is no idiot. She’s also proven she can keep a secret for an indefinite amount of time under the most trying conditions, as
Gaunt and hardened, the woman’s face still held traces of exotic beauty.  “Sarya Tyuleneva.  That’s Msti Andreyev.
“Impossible,” declared Mycroft. “The sheer volume of information...”
“So beautiful,” John murmured, stroking Sherlock’s stomach. He kept one hand there, still stroking, as he ran the other back and forth along the pouch slit. He could feel Sherlock tense and then relax again, this time more deeply. Back, forth, back, forth and... in. John slipped his whole hand into the slick, warm tightness of Sherlock’s pouch. Sherlock jerked as if hit by an electrical shock.
“Well, I mustn’t keep you.  What brings you here today, anyway?”
John hung up and turned on Mary. “
“What about you, John?  What have you been doing this evening?”
form, thought Ivan, surprised.  Up until now, he’d assumed that Sherlock’s glorious feathers and wings were natural to him.  It was unsettling – and saddening – to learn that this beauty was rooted in an evil curse.  Yet at the same time, Ivan couldn’t help wondering what Sherlock had looked like
Lestrade swore. “Magnussen is 6’ 4”, light build, blond. What time was this?”
“Oh, fuck!” She grabbed a wad of napkins just as John shoved another wad in her direction.  He looked away awkwardly as she caught her breath.
“Victor told me the same thing, but he meant I was an amazing weapon. He never asked
But Sherlock and Mycroft were staring at each other.
“All right, we
“...but I appreciate the consideration. I know it was your idea, of course. Sherlock is a dear but this isn’t the kind of thing he’d think of.”
, couldn’t help imagining a tall, slender man with black hair instead of black plumes.  Black curls, maybe.  Sherlock’s pale face and hands suggested that he’d be pale, well,
“No, it’s a theory originally put forward by Goodey and Fossall in 1993 and now widely accepted among evolutionary anthropologists,” retorted Sherlock frostily.
“Now, Mr Caustlin, if you’d begin at the beginning. Your mother left for Spain...”
“’You people’?  D’you mean soldiers?”
hearts.  Two identical
The last thing John remembered before he drifted to sleep was the press of Sherlock’s lips against his own.
John could see where this was going. “And the catalysts that drive the reverse reaction are toxic.”
“It’s the only room where the windows are lit long after dark.”
“Dexter, you know John. John, this is Dexter. He was at your wedding.”
Make that both big toes.
John looked him in the eye. “You’ve also got a job. At the moment.”
“One fellow pissed himself.”
“D’you think it’s a murder?” asked Billy hopefully.
“Ta bloke wha’ did ta secon’ ‘un is lef’ hannit,” Smoky opined. “See ‘ere? An’ ‘ere?”
When the last stand of rye was finally cut and bundled and the bundles stowed away in the hay barn to await threshing, Misha declared, “There’s a job well-done!  Come up to my house and drink kvass with me, Vanya Stolitsky.”  So they sat on the porch of the house and drank kvass, and Ivan thought he’d never had a drink so delicious.
As the crocuses and daffodils began to appear outdoors in late February, Mary became noticeably more restless about having to stay inside all the time. Still, John thought she was bearing up with reasonable grace.
Sherlock shrugged.  “We already knew that, John.  Do keep up.”
Eventually John decided that he’d seen enough of Britchit and went back to one of the medical articles.  When he found himself yawning at the screen, he decided it was time to turn in.  He shut the laptop down.
, Dexter.”
Rather less gracefully, John staggered to his feet and hobbled after him. He too paused in the doorway to look not behind but forward, where Sherlock lay sprawled across the bed, still fully dressed except for his unbuttoned shirt, now parted to display his chest and throat.
“I’m not asking you. Greg?”
“You would have arrived here eventually, with me or without me.  What would your chances be, standing alone against a sorcerer?”
The shy smile on Nadya’s face told Ivan all he needed to know about her consent, so he gave his permission on the condition that the marriage should take place before Nadya and Rada re-embarked for the return voyage.  This was done, with all of the company as well as the ship’s captain and the first mate attending the wedding.
More puzzling was the young pageboy’s fervent demonstration of both an attachment to Sherlock and an interest in – if John heard correctly – beheadings. Fortunately, the boy’s mother didn’t seem to hear as clearly as John.
“Very funny. Seriously, though, it’s been almost two weeks since the shooting and no one’s made an attempt on Sherlock’s life.”
Mrs Holmes patted her shoulder. “Don’t cry, dear, we don’t have time to redo your makeup.”
“Oh, really, and when you were 16 you’d never broken a rule in your life? Should I call Mycroft to confirm that?”
Sherlock looked up from the peas he’d been pushing into patterns on his plate. “Just be glad you’re not an amarsupial. You’d have a lot longer to wait.”
“Perhaps. But as you’ve probably guessed, I obtained Magnussen’s schedule from Janine. That’s why I expected him to be absent from his office and flat that evening. And yet he wasn’t. Did Janine warn him? Was the security guard supposed to apprehend me after she let me in?”
John took a step forward without thinking about it.
“Christ, Sherlock, the man let his dog attack you, helped you evade proper medical care, introduced you to an addictive drug and persisted in having sex with you because he enjoyed it even though you didn’t. But apparently none of that mattered because he told you that you were ‘amazing.’”
Sherlock treated the question the same way he’d treated the toast.
“Does it have to be a choice, one or the other, not both?”
of it,” John snapped before turning his back and heading for the kettle.
“No more than nine hours ago, I would say.”
Sherlock blinked and grinned. “Couldn’t you tell?”  And then more thoughtfully, “Victor seemed rather bored, the few times he attempted fellatio.”
John and Mary were walking back to their car when John remembered something else.
“We need to enter separately.  I’ll go first.  Wait three minutes before following.  Order some common kind of beer or ale and then act as if you're waiting for someone.  Don’t stand or sit too close to where I am.”
Lestrade looked dubious.
“Couldn’t you use a disposable phone, as he did?”
Campbell-Williams wore a simple black dress with her hair in a messy knot instead of its usual messy ponytail. She also wore a wire, although this was not visible to the casual observer.  She looked remarkably poised for a civilian – far more poised than her dinner companion.  Wentworth was a handsome middle-aged man whose fine dark suit advertised his broad shoulders but didn’t do much for the visible sheen of sweat on his face.
“I need to review the terms of my trust. I deleted the bits about what happens if I marry and have children. Or just have a child.”
Campbell-Williams’s lip began to curl. “Bioelectric fields,” suggested John, before she could say anything.
“Please, I learned both of those skills as a child. I used to practice the former on Mycroft and the latter on Mycroft’s possessions.  As for your obvious assumption, you’ve met Shezza.  Would you pay him to perform fellatio on you?”
“Good quality clothes and shoes but worn past the time they’d normally be replaced. Married, with at least one small child. Note the spot of mashed food on the back of his trousers where the child hugged him on his way out the door. He needed money for his family and dealt with the wrong person to get it. Check the missing person reports. His spouses may have called in by now.”
“Thanks, Mrs Hudson. Sherlock’s out of milk.”
And there was the rub.
key card would have been immediately accosted by security.”
. Magnussen was like a shark – it’s the only way I can describe him. Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London Aquarium? Ever stood up close to the glass? Those floating flat faces, those dead eyes ... That’s what he was. I’ve dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them could turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen. I would have done
Smiling just a bit, looking almost embarrassed to be caught in an act of sentiment, Sherlock returned to his microscope.
“I’m younger and more flexible.”
much different from riding a horse.  A very skinny horse with very long legs.
“It wasn’t until that afternoon that one of the other students told me that the chief lab manager was looking for me. When I arrived, she presented me with two dead rats.  She’d discovered them in the midst of violent convulsions.  Since so far as she knew no one else was using them for research purposes – and since I had something of a reputation – she demanded to know if I knew anything about what might have happened.”
“Sherlock, it’s my
“Can you hear me, Sherlock?”
Left alone, Sherlock sniffed himself and looked disgusted. “I have a meeting in three hours. I need a bath.”
“I meant marry. Marry
Happily bemused, John made two mugs of tea and a plate of toast, then took them to the sofa. When he sat down, Sherlock leaned – really, almost cuddled – against him, sitting up straight only to make the occasional addition to his notes.
“The wrong sort of quiet, is it?”
“That wasn’t the only time you’ve been attracted to a man.”
If he had someone to help him... Sherlock. No, not Sherlock, he didn’t want to be responsible for sending Sherlock to the hospital a third time. But Sherlock might be able to contact Bill Wiggins, who’d already proven that he was willing to travel for food.
A few yards away, Sherlock stood up with a look on his face very like Madeleine’s and started to walk towards them. “Looks like storm clouds on both fronts,” said John, trying and failing to interest his daughter in a dummy.

“He’s been ordering me around as if I were his housekeeper, that’s what he’s been doing!”  Both men turned to look as Mrs Hudson made her way up the stairs with a tea pot, cup and saucer on a tray.  “First he wants tea, then biscuits.  Now it’s more tea!”
Sherlock sniffed again, this time at nothing in particular.  “The Committee decided that too much money was leaving the country in exchange for imported tobacco.  They’ve banned tobacco products until domestic tobacco cultivation can be established.  The Semois lines are showing some promise.  In the meantime we’re expected to make do with synthetic nicotine patches.”
Why were all these journal articles so dull? John could hardly keep his attention on them.
The stranger bent his head to whisper something in Sherlock’s ear.  Then the two of them left the pub, the stranger’s arm still around Sherlock’s waist, two lovers, perhaps planning to spend the night together.
“Busy.”
“With Moriarty.”
No response.

That was... very fine indeed.
“What Muircheartaigh said, was it true?”

“Watson, get down!”  Was that Murray?  But John needed to save the man who’d been shot, except the man was Mary, except that Mary had curly, dark hair and she was so young and he needed to save him and he yelled her name, his name, a name...

“Sherlock.”
“Yeah,” said John thoughtfully.  “I can see that.”
Carrying a full bucket of water in one hand while leaning on the stick with the other was no easy task.  The village streets were full of children, running this way and that.  Ivan remembered the jewels hidden in his saddlebags and thought briefly of hiring one of the older children to carry the water.  But Misha had asked him to thresh grain before he would give Ivan any advice, and now Manya had asked him to carry water before she would talk to him.  He was seeing a pattern here, so he made trip after trip to the well, even though his leg ached and his shoulder burned.
“That’s going to be her bedroom some day. She still prefers Sherlock’s pouch for sleeping, but that won’t last. Besides, Sherlock and I, well...”
began appearing around the flat. John began keeping a lookout for any unusual parcels, especially those that might hum or buzz.
“And I was right, wasn’t I?” she asked bitterly. “If I hadn’t gone, none of this would have happened.”
When he descended the stairs, Sherlock was waiting for him with a cup of tea and a banana. “Breakfast.  Now come on.”
