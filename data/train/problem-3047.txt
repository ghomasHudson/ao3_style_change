Dean took Cas' belt into his hands and made quick work of unfastening it and pulling it free from his pants, he threw it across the room and Cas' eyes followed, but quickly returned their attention to the sight of Dean kneeling naked between his legs. Dean's fingers slowly unbuttoned Cas' pants which were tented by Cas' erect cock then he slid the zipper down. Cas' thick cock popped out as soon as the zipper was out of the way, laying hard against his stomach and Dean smirked, looking up at Cas once again. "Commando, huh Cas? That is so hot"
The anticipation was racing through Castiel's body and he began to shake as he reached out and placed his hand on Dean's arm. He smiled at him nervously as he closed the last inches between them, their bodies now flush against one another.  Castiel let out a soft shaky sigh as Dean wrapped his arm around his lower back and pulled him in closer and took his mouth with his own. His tongue sliding out and over Castiel's lips gently before he parted them allowing Dean entry.
Cas's eyes fly open and he looks at Dean. Dean voice lowers, "What did I ever do to deserve you? For you to save me? To have you like this?" he sighs heavily "You are so perfect, I am the luckiest man on earth."
Castiel worked a third finger into Dean, scissoring them, and stretching Dean's hole, his spit slicked fingers gliding in and out with ease. Dean pulled away from Castiel's hands facing him once again and kissing him. He reached over to the night stand and grabbed the foil packets. He ripped open the condom and rolled it over Castiel's cock, then ripped open packet of lube and applied it liberally.
He heard Sam slide his chair out from the table and walk around. He bent over by Dean, grabbing the keys to the Impala. "I think you guys have some things to discuss... I'll be out late."
Dean looked up at Cas, his pupils blown wide as he raced toward orgasm. "MmM Cas..." He whined "I'm so close... Oh... Cas.... harder... please.... harder.... ooohh!"
Dean wasted no time working his way back down to Castiel's throbbing cock. He grabbed it firmly at the base and lifted it to get a better angle before taking it fully into his mouth. Castiel let out a load moan and Dean couldn't help but smile around his thick cock. Dean hadn't known how he would feel about having another man's penis in his mouth, but this was Cas, and he fucking loved the way his cock felt stretching his mouth, the way he tasted. He closed his eyes, taking everything in with his other senses, the firm yet soft skin, that musk of him so potent here. The little mewling sounds that Cas was making. This right here, this was his heaven, and he never wanted to leave.
"I don't have time today, I'll take a look tomorrow and let you know" She says walking to the door. "I'll also send you a new list of tasks to be taken care of."
Dean thought a moment, he'd really been looking forward to arguing with Castiel about the horrible movie from the night before, he hadn't even thought about his next movie. "I'm not really sure, to tell you the truth I haven't really thought about it." He paused a moment "I'm not really picky, what's the last movie you watched that truly blew your mind?"
"Castiel!" Darla cried out when she saw him through the living room doorway. He smiled taking off his shoes and walked into the living room. The tree in the corner was beautiful, Dean had the yule log with holiday music playing on the large flatscreen hanging on the wall.
Dean couldn't lie, even in elementary school, he had a crush on the younger of the two Novak boys. There was just something about that perpetually messy dark hair, those blue eyes and that adorable lopsided grin. What's more is back then, Dean didn't even know he was into guys at all... But there was just something about Cas that had always drew his eyes and attention.
Dean looks up, his green eyes lust blown "So beautiful Cas." he says before lifting Cas' leg over his shoulder, exposing the puckered pink flesh.
Castiel takes a step back. He most certainly wasn't expecting that. "Dean, I don't know what to say. I'm deeply flattered that you feel that way about me. Things will be ok. You will find someone at your new school, who is more apropriate age for you."
Dean smiles at the noise, and uses his hands to tip Cas' head back, wetting his hair as he runs his fingers through it. "Doesn't that feel good Cas?" He answers Dean with a soft moan, his eyes closed, lips parted slightly. Dean continues to run one hand through Cas' hair as the other runs down over his chest and settles back around his waist, pulling him in even closer as he nips at Cas' neck, sucking hard, leaving it red, and pulling another long low moan from his mouth.
Cas pulled back, and looked at Dean quizzically then glanced over his shoulder looking down the hall. Dean chuckled lightly placing a light kiss at the corner of his mouth. "Easy there tiger, I'm not suggesting sex." Dean smirked, grabbing Castiel's ass and pulling him in hard against his body. "At least not tonight. The couch is super comfortable though. And I know that Darla would love it if you were here in the morning when she got up."
Cas smiles climbing on the bed with him. "That makes two of us." He leans in kissing him deeply, running his hands over Dean's firm body, wrapping his fingers around his cock, stroking gently. He slowly kisses down Dean's jawline and over his chest. Savoring the taste of him and the soft noises he's making as he works his way down. He looks up at Dean as he reaches his cock, Dean's green eyes are staring down at him as he slowly runs his tongue over the tip. When Dean moans above him Cas' opens his mouth taking his full length in, Dean grabs a fist full of his hair crying out his name as he bobs his head up and down of Dean's length.
Dean let out a low groan and pushed Castiel back into the counter "What if I desire to have you on this here counter? "
Dean's fingers swirl in the gathering spit at the base of his cock and slowly teases his tight hole, slipping a finger in as he moans around Cas' cock again.
The kiss was brief but full of fire. "Cas" Dean growled "you need to stop doing things that make me want to eat you. Just being near you is hard enough, but when you bite your lip like that, and look at me with those beautiful blue eyes... I... Just... I dont know if I'm going to be able to control myself." Dean planted a softer kiss at the corner of his mouth.
As the music faded at the end of the song Dean realized that he had leaned forward and his forehead was now resting against Cas'. How long had they been sitting there like that? Dean took in a deep breath as he sat up sharply, the ear buds falling out of both their ears. "I'm sorry Cas, guess I'm more tired than I thought. I'm going to call it a night ok?" Dean shifted back, breaking all physical contact with him.
Dean winked at him, "Your birthday will be here before you know it." He kissed him again quickly before heading out of the room and down the stairs, gathering their clothing as he went. They stood in the foyer and got dressed, kissing each other often in between putting on pieces of clothing. When they were full dressed and Castiel had his shoes on, they stepped into the living room to find Jimmy sitting on the couch flipping through channels on the tv.
He turned and found himself face to face with the angel, who had moved in close to him without a sound. "Jeez, Cas. Personal space huh?" Dean let out in a burst, his voice catching. That smell again, like fresh rain hitting the earth.
"Even without my grace I can feel you Dean. I feel your longing, and I wanted to comfort you. I didn't know that this was what you were longing for though. I could have never dreamed this." he smiles softly.
"Cas...  Ngh" Dean grunted as he quickened his pace, slamming his dick as deep and hard as he could into Castiel. The kitchen was filled with echoes of slapping skin and moans from them both. "Oh god baby, you feel so fucking good Cas. God it's like you were  made for me. Oh....  Ngh....  OH Cas!" Dean's breath hitched as he raced closer to his orgasm, he could feel Castiel's cock trapped between their stomachs, sliding, slicked with precum, Dean was about to feel guilty about neglecting it when he felt Castiel tighten around him and suddenly there was a lot more moisture between them.
Dean's body jerked, back and forth, fucking Cas' thigh and hand as he raced toward orgasm, precum leaking out of him had slicked up Cas' hand and his cock was sliding fast and hard through his fingers. Dean's hand dug into Cas' thigh harder as he was losing control, and his other hand pulled Cas' head toward him, and Cas knew what he was asking for. He bit down hard on the top of the hunter's shoulder, and that's all it took, a wave of pleasure shook Dean's body as the orgasm ripped through him. Cas felt his cock swell in his hand before spurts of white creamy cum shot out of him and covered his fingers as he gently stroked him, milking every last drop. Dean's knees gave out beneath him, and Cas took the whole of the Hunter's weight.
Dean continued thrusting up into Jimmy as he rode through his orgasm, the muscles in his ass clenching around Dean and soon he followed Jimmy, thrusting hard as the white heat shot through his body and he came hard inside his tight ass."OH God!" Dean reached up and grabbed him, pulling their bodies together as his body shook with pleasure.
Cas licks around Dean's entrance, pressing in slowly with his tongue until Dean is moaning wildly above him. Cas pushes Dean's leg up, gaining easier access, slicking up a finger in his mouth before gently pressing it into him. He rather quickly is able to slide a second finger in as his tongue soothes over the stretched skin.
"Actually" Dean said, grabbing his phone "I think it's time for the cookies to come out of the oven. Why don't you take the expert out in the kitchen and see what he thinks."
Dean sat there for a moment, trying to fully grasp what had just happened. Dean had awoke to Cas sitting on his bed plenty of times, but he was always on the edge, and in his usual get up. Including that damn trenchcoat, which he could see now was draped neatly over the back of the chair, the rest of his cloths folded neatly in the seat. Dean's eyes flicked back to Cas, sitting with his back against the headboard, blankets pulled to his waist, no shirt, beautiful marks coverin his chest and neck. Dean knew that Cas could have healed them in no time, and the fact that he hadnt flooded him with such warmth.
Cas' eyes shyly darted to the floor beside them. "I, uh... It's what you like isn't it? It's how you kiss, I was just reciprocating what I could feel from you." His eyes looked up and met Dean's.
There was a moment of silence in the car as they drove, heading back to Dean's place. Castiel was reveling in the peace that had some over him when he felt warmth on his hand. He snapped his head sideways looking down as Dean took his hand to his own. "I couldn't imagine sharing this night with anyone else. Thank you for coming along." Dean smiled giving Castiel a wink before turning his head back toward the road.
Castiel found that he desperately needed to watch as Dean slowly pulled away his pants,  leaving him laying in just his boxer briefs,  his cock straining against the fabric. The look on Dean's face as he stared at the bulge between his legs was one of awe. Suddenly Dean's green eyes met his blue ones and Castiel thought there was a flicker of hesitation in them.  But if it was there,  it was gone just as quickly as it had appeared. Dean ran his hands up Castiel's legs coming to rest on his thighs,  before leaning in and gently rubbing first his nose and then his lips over Castiel's erection.
"Hello Dean"Cas said to the man sitting on the couch. He was wearing jeans and a white button up shirt.
Dean kisses Cas hard as he wraps the blindfold around his eyes. He sucks hard on his tongue, biting his lip as he pulls away. His eyes taking in the full sight of Cas as he gets off the bed. Black cuffs holding him to the bed, black blindfold leaving him unaware of where Dean's next touch is coming from. Tight black corset over his pale body, his nipples just barely peaking out the top. Sexy lacy panties stretched tight over his cock, which is so hard the panties aren't able to fully contain it, the flushed head straining against the elastic band at the top. Down to the sexy black fishnets encasing his long creamy legs. "Fuck Cas... You're a goddamn vision" Dean says standing at the foot of the bed, biting his lip. His cock twitching with desire.
A smirk tugged at his lips as an idea occurred to him. "I pray to the angel Castiel, to get his feathery ass in this shower with me and wash my back"
"Oh baby, yes. That would make this so much hotter! Besides, if you dont, I can't promise I wont flip you over right now and take you inside me, preparation be damned.... God Cas, I want you so bad!"
Dean gently took Cas' cock in his hand and softly began to stroke it. He wasnt in any kind of rush himself, he just wanted to make Cas feel good. After a moment, when he wasnt getting any reaction, Dean pulled back from Cas' lips with question in his eyes.
"Fucking fuck Cas!" he heard Dean groan above him and he smiled. Scooting on his knees he guided Dean around until he was leaning against the counter, the last thing he needed was for Dean to fall and give himself a concussion. And if he was already losing his balance, Cas would hate to think what would happen when he continued. Because Castiel was just getting started.
Dean flinched, he hadn't expected him to say anything, and to be honest he was still thrown by the boy's nearly identical looks to Castiel, but if nothing else had given this boy away as not being Castiel, it was his voice. He turned toward him and smiled. "Yes, I do enjoy independent films" he paused then asked "how about yourself?"
Before he knows what's happening Dean has him off the bed and thrown against the wall, his body crashing into him as his thigh spread's Cas' legs apart, grinding their hips together. Dean smashing their mouths together so hard Cas can taste blood. 'Finally" Cas thinks as Dean grabs his hair pulling his head back and sinking his teeth into his neck.
It was another moment or two when Darla came back in the living room with a plate of cookies in one hand and a glass of milk in the other. She set them on the small table next to the tree and turned to Castiel. "Castiel, will you be here in the morning after Santa comes?"
Dean swirled his warm tongue around his mouth as his hands wandered over his back, hungrily pulling their bodies closer and closer. Castiel's body still trembled wanting more, needing more. Dean broke the kiss and looked in Castiel's eyes. "Cas, you're shaking" he said kissing him gently "Are you ok with this?"
He pulls the band of the boxers down, exposing the stretch of skin over bone there, and softly runs his lips over it. Sticking his tongue out, tasting the soft salty taste of Cas just before he sinks his teeth in and sucks another mark to the surface. Cas' hips rise up into him, and dean can feel his erection hit him in the chest. That's all the distraction he needs to pull away from Cas' hips.
Cas was about to ask Dean where he was taking him, when the car slowed and turned left, Cas looked up and saw they were pulling into a motel parking lot. Neither of them said a word as Dean pulled into a parking spot and got out of the car, walking toward the door marked OFFICE. Cas watched him through the window as he talked to the young woman behind the desk, and kept his eyes on him as he came back out glancing down the building and then got back in the car. Still not a word was said as Dean moved the car down the lot and parked directly outside room 9.
"Fucking fuck Cas!" he heard Dean groan above him and he smiled. Scooting on his knees he guided Dean around until he was leaning against the counter, the last thing he needed was for Dean to fall and give himself a concussion. And if he was already losing his balance, Cas would hate to think what would happen when he continued. Because Castiel was just getting started.
"Ok, well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow, and we can discuss this movie." Dean smiled, it would be interesting to see how different the brother's taste in movies were.
"oh!" Dean moaned "Cas... I think we need...." Dean began to protest as the Angel shoved his finger in further, without the assistance of lubrication.
"Damn Cas, be careful with that forceful tone, you're giving me tingles." Castiel squinted his eyes at him, in an attempt to look stern. "All right, I'm going" Dean reached around and slapped his ass "But you better be ready for me when I get back" he winked at him and headed to his room.
Dean wipes his hand of the dishrag and hangs it on the handle of the fridge before walking out of the kitchen toward the living room. The apartment was really starting to come together, sure there were still boxes to unpack, but it was nice to see that his stuff was mingling nicely with Cas' and that he was so accommodating. He didn't just feel like a visitor anymore, it was really starting to feel like their place. Not that Cas ever had made him feel like just a visitor, with Cas everything felt right, no matter where they were, so long as they were together, that would always be home. Dean turns toward the bedroom when he doesn't find Cas in the living room and sees the soft flicker of candle light. He smiles to himself as a twinge of excitement blooms in his chest. As he walks toward the room he can hear soft Jazz music playing, he pushes the door open and can seen a dozen or more candles lit around their bedroom. Dean loved that Cas was such a romantic and couldn't wait to see what he had in store for the evening. He walks farther into the room his eyes adjusting to the dim light and he turns to see Cas sitting with his legs crossed on the edge of the bed.
Dean was looking at the floor, unable to keep eye contact with Cas as he had moved closer to him. There was a long silence that hung heavy in the air. Cas got off the bed, and took Dean's hand in his. "Dean, I need you. I don't think you will ever understand how much I just need you in my life. Please stay with me tonight." Cas sighed, lifting Dean's hand to his mouth and placing a soft kiss there. "I'm going to take a moment in the bathroom, and get dressed. I hope that you will still be here when I come out, but I will understand if you decide to go. Thank you for everything you have helped me with." Cas let go of Dean's hand, walked over to the table and grabbed the bag with the new cloths Dean had picked up for him.
Darla giggled again, quickly losing interest in her father and Castiel. She gathered up her toys and went into her room. Once they heard the door close, Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel's waist and pulled him in closer. "Best kiss you've had in quite sometime huh?" he asked teasingly.
Meg, her family and friends had all had dinner in the restaurant and migrated to the bar where they were now monopolizing the dance floor with their terrible moves set to a god awful playlist of pop hits. Dean scoffed as an 80's pop hit came on, eliciting a loud 'woo' from the group who proceeded to take the opportunity to grind up on each other. He finished his drink and turned to ask the bartender for another.
"No, Dean, I know. I know the feelings that you try to hide from me. I know what you are trying to deny yourself. I know" Cas still didn't move, but he felt like he was closer. Dean could feel his warmth, the smell of  him was washing over Dean.
Cas stands up taking a step closer to Dean. "Dean, do you... have you... are you..." Cas isn't sure what it is he wants to ask. He looks down at the floor, when he looks back up Dean is standing closer to him. "What was happening before, is that something you really want?" he asks, his voice low.
"mmmm..." Cas moaned into his neck. "How can I refuse when you ask so nicely" Cas gently untied the tie from his wrists, then softly kissed the marks it had left. "Looks like you're going to have bruises." He said with a touch of worry in his tone.
"get ready to hear more, because FUCK Dean, you feel amazing.... Now move!" Cas says, his voice rough and his eyes wild. He digs his fingers into Dean's hips as he starts moving again. The room quickly fills with the sound of their moans and the rough harsh sound of  Dean's hard cock slapping Cas' stomach as he bounces on top of him.
Jimmy pumped up and down on Dean's dick, panting heavily as he watched his brother kiss and tease the older man. Dean felt so good filling him up, he knew he wasn't going to last long, but he was determined to bring Dean to orgasm before himself. He leaned forward joining the kiss between the other two, flicking and rotating his hips as he rode Dean hard. He lifted his ass, almost completely off Dean before slamming back down hard, the noise that escaped Dean made him do it again, and again, until Dean reached up and grabbed his hips, holding him in place as Dean then thrust hard and fast into him. He felt like Dean was going to split him in half and then suddenly Dean thrust just right and hit his prostate, Jimmy was so close that the second time Dean hit it, he lost all control."FUCK" he screamed as his orgasm ripped through him.
How Dean sank to his knees before him, lifting his leg over his shoulder before sucking his cock into his mouth, taking him down in one swallow. Leaving Cas so lost in his desire that he had to grab Dean by the hair just to be sure he didn't fall over. How Dean's dirty little mouth was able to make him feel so much pleasure that he was left speechless above him, moaning incoherently. Dean pulling him out of his mouth, licking lower until his tongue runs over Cas' sensitive opening, teasing only briefly before pushing a long digit into him making Cas gasp, tightening his fingers in Dean's hair. Dean stretching and opening him up until he begged Dean to "fuck me". How Dean looked at him with burning passion as he stood up, slamming their mouths together with a growl. Fingers digging deep into his ass as he rolls their hips together, Cas' sensitive cock rubbing against the course denim of Dean's jeans. "Dean" he moaned into his mouth and Dean pulled back eyes wild with lust, just before...
By the time the movie was over, both Jimmy and Castiel were sitting up and very close to him. They turned to face him and discussed the movie, just like any other night at the store, except this time there was no interruptions and the movie was fresh in their minds. They all agreed that they enjoyed the film.
Dean spends the rest of the car ride trying not to jump on Cas, the anticipation is driving him mad, especially with Cas' hand running over his thigh, brushing across his jean clad erection. And Dean's moans just seem to further encourage the action. Luckily Cas doesn't live far, and they are both scrambling for the front door to his apartment within five minutes of leaving the parking lot.
"I'm glad she gave me a chance." Dean says focusing on keeping his voice steady, even though inside he was screaming.
I miss you every day, and I REALLY miss your pie. Seriously dude, you make THE BEST PIE EVER! I hope all is well and that you like your new neighbors, but don't make them pie, save that for me. Because I am coming back to you Mr. Novak. I am coming back and when I do I want your best pie. And I want my grown up kiss!
He let out another little moan as his hips began moving, slowly in small circles to start, but soon he was lifting his hips up and slamming them back down, spearing himself on Castiel's cock so hard and fast Castiel nearly forgot how to breathe. Dean's soft moans turned into needy desperate ones as he pushed Castiel down onto his back and rode him at a full gallop.
Jimmy took one last step toward him and in one swift movement slipped his hand down the front of Dean's shorts, grabbing his very hard dick. Dean couldn't hold back the gasp that escaped his lips and more than he could control how his hips rotated shoving his dick harder into Jimmy's hand. "You want this, don't deny yourself." Jimmy said softly, then whispered in his ear "Let us make you feel good Dean"
"53 days" Dean confirmed "C'mon Cas, you probably should be going now. It's getting late, and I'm sure Jimmy's pretty bored." Dean got up pulling Cas to his feel in front of him, he wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him close. "I just hope you don't get bored with me before the 53 days are up." He cast his eyes to the floor
"Not until 7, but I like to go in early and get stuff done before." Cas looks out the passenger window, he doesnt want to tell Dean that he's been sleeping in the back room.
"Cas..." Dean moans against his mouth, pulling his hips into him harder, bucking his own hips to meet Cas'.
"Shut up" Dean blushes as his eyes scan the bar. His eyes fall on a pretty brunette, who was looking their way. She was wearing a tan business suit, he winks and lifts his beer to her, she smiles politely but nods toward Charlie and winks back. Dean smiles knowingly and nods his head. His eyes return to Charlie as she finishes her drink. "Easy there red" he says. "Don't look now, but the brunette at the bar is totally checking you out. And if you keep going the way you are, you're not going to be able to walk, let alone pick her up."
Dean felt Cas' breath on his ear, could feel the rumble in his chest as he spoke, most of all he could feel his resolve melt. He wanted this so much, these words, this closeness, to just give into his desires.
"You wanna be my bitch Dean?" Castiel turned, pushing Dean back so he was sitting back on his legs. "You want me to fuck you like you've never been fucked before? You want my cock to split open that tight perky ass of yours, til it don't know what its like not to have a cock shoved in it?" Castiel pushed himself forward onto Dean as he spoke, first softly, then with more confidence as Dean let him take control, feeling a sense of power. "Want me to mark you up, so that everyone knows that you're mine." Castiel hesitated a moment, watching Dean's face. " I want to make you mine Dean, and I never want anyone else to have you."
Castiel flipped the lid on the bottle of lube and poured it into his hand, his mouth pulling off of Dean's cock with a loud sloppy pop. He grabbed it with both hands and slathered it with lube. He looked up at Dean who was staring at him, mouth opened, eyes wide. Cas leaned into him flicking his tongue over his lips and into his mouth, kissing deeply, eliciting a moan, from which one of them he wasnt quite sure.
Ok, so I'm gonna say sorry that I've left you where I did, but please hear me out, I do have a reason for it!
Castiel worked a third finger into Dean, scissoring them, and stretching Dean's hole, his spit slicked fingers gliding in and out with ease. Dean pulled away from Castiel's hands facing him once again and kissing him. He reached over to the night stand and grabbed the foil packets. He ripped open the condom and rolled it over Castiel's cock, then ripped open packet of lube and applied it liberally.
So here they are sitting in this nice restaurant, Dean trying not to be disgusted with his "date" and his rude, crass comments. Especially about and to their waiter, a very attractive man with blue yes and dark hair, and the most beautiful full lips he'd ever seen. Sure, he was thinking about how amazing those lips would be pressed against his, and how they would look wrapped around his cock, but he would never state it out loud, especially to the guy. Crowley was a rude pompas ass, and Dean was silently cursing Sam for getting him into this mess. Half way through their meal, after countless remarks, their waiter was changed for a young blonde woman, and the remarks stopped. Crowley didn't have much left to say, and Dean was tired of trying to keep a conversation going with someone who was literally making him sick to his stomach. He set down his fork and excused himself to the restroom.
Weeks had passed since he had seen Dean, not trusting his newly forming feelings for the green eyes man not to take over all his reason. Tonight would be the first time he had not only seen Dean, but also be in his apartment with him. Castiel knew things would be ok though, because Dean's daughter Darla was staying with him tonight. She was the sweetest little girl with her daddy's smile, and Dean loved her so much. Castiel had never seen his eyes sparkle as much as they did when he was looking at Darla. Dean and Darla's mother had gotten divorced a couple years ago. And while Darla lived with her mother primarily, Dean spent every moment he could with her.
So he’d shrug it off any time he felt the emotions boiling to the surface, and he would have continued to do so forever, if Cas had just left it alone, and not confronted him about it.
After a few moments of heavy panting and moaning, they've both caught their breath and Dean lies next to Cas on the bed, having removed the binds around his wrists. His fingers trace over the lace at the top of his thigh highs as he looks into Cas' ocean blue eyes. "I had no idea you were so kinky" he says with a smirk.
It was Christmas Eve and Castiel was making his last minute rounds to friends' houses distributing gifts and cookies before heading back to his own empty apartment. His family, not being Christian, didn't celebrate Christmas, instead celebrating the Winter solstice. The family had gathered the weekend before and he'd had an amazing evening full of laughter and love with all of his brothers and sisters and the sea of nieces and nephews.
He starts to pull away when he hears Dean sigh and feels his arms tighten around his back. "Cas" Dean's voice comes out almost as low moan. Cas lifts his eyes to Dean's again, and he can see something shift in them, the confusion and hesitation gone, replaced by something softer. Cas takes a chance and leans in, once again pressing his lips to Dean's and this time Dean kisses him back softly. His mouth opening easily when Cas moves his tongue across his lips again, meeting Cas with his own tongue and letting out a soft moan at the contact.
"Thank you Dean. " Cas leaned in for what Dean thought was going to be a hug. But no, those were definitely lips he felt on his cheek. It was soft and quick, but yes, Cas had definitely kissed him. "Goodnight Dean" Cas said as he turned toward the door.
Castiel had moved in next door to the Winchesters about 6 months ago fresh out of college and living on his own for the first time. John and Mary had been wonderful neighbors, helping them with anything that he had needed, and their sons Dean and Sam helped as much as they could as well. It was as a sign of appreciation that Castiel baked his first pie for them. A classic apple pie, still warm when he brought it over with the tub of vanilla ice cream. Everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy it, but it was Dean who went back for seconds and even thirds Mary informed Castiel the next day when she returned the pie plate.
"Yay!" Darla exclaimed, coming up next to Castiel and taking his hand. "Are you coming with us Castiel?"
"C..Cas..." Dean's voice broke, as Castiel slapped his ass again, and again, until Dean was a whimpering mess, laying across the table.
Dean reaches into the box and grabs the black fuzzy cuffs holding them up. "Want me to use these on you?" He asks
"I hope so! Merry Christmas Castiel!" She said hugging his leg before running back down the hall to her room. He watched her and met Dean's gaze. Dean crooked a smile and shrugged slightly before following her.
Cas held him there, lightly kissing his neck, hand still holding his softening dick as Dean's breathing slowly began to steady. Dean's fingers were gently massaging Cas' head eliciting soft whimpers from the Angel, who's cock was fully hard and pressing against Dean's ass as he rested on his thigh.
"You know I never kiss and tell. I am a lady Dean Winchester" Charlie says with a huge smile on her face.
"You'll see him again, I'm sure of it. I've got to admit, it's nice seeing you obsess about someone new." She says as she rubs my back lovingly. "Speaking of new guys though, I've met someone."
"Ok, so what about tonight? I mean, I get you two helping each other discover yourselves, man I kinda wish I had that when I was a teenager. But if you guys haven't been together in almost two years, and Jimmy prefers women. Still trying to wrap my head around that one... but why tonight. What brought the two of you to my door tonight?"
When she heard him stirring behind her she quickly got up and ran over to him with the biggest smile on her face and her eyes full of sparkle. "Castiel! It's Christmas! Look, Santa came!" she said jumping around.
Cas watches Dean's body shake through his orgasm. "mmmm... found myself a dirty boy who likes it rough huh?" Cas says before smacking Dean's other ass cheek. He moans out loudly from the sting his body rolling with pleasure "More... please" Dean says softly, and Cas is more than happy to oblige, smacking his ass until he can see the red welts of his hand print raising out of the skin. He brushes his fingers over the marks lightly, earning another moan from Dean. Leaning in Cas runs his tongue over the hot irritated flesh before taking his hands and spreading his cheeks. He glides his wet tongue over Dean's pink hole, slowly circling the tight puckered ring before pressing into him. Dean lets out another breathy moan, pressing his greedy ass back into Cas' tongue, his hole fluttering around Cas' tongue as he slides it in and out of him at an agonizingly slow pace.
"Mr. Winchester, care to share your story with the class?" Mrs. Moseley says, pulling Dean into the reality of his panic.
Dean spends the rest of the car ride trying not to jump on Cas, the anticipation is driving him mad, especially with Cas' hand running over his thigh, brushing across his jean clad erection. And Dean's moans just seem to further encourage the action. Luckily Cas doesn't live far, and they are both scrambling for the front door to his apartment within five minutes of leaving the parking lot.
Dean smiles again, running his lips over Cas' jaw to his lips kissing him deeply as his fingers continue to play with his nipples. Dean pulls back, leaving them both gasping as he kisses his way down Cas' neck to his collar bone, teeth scraping over the skin. He places wet open mouth kisses down his chest, finally leaving his nipples alone. He grips Cas' hips as he slowly runs his tongue over Cas' leaking cock head, which is peaking out the top of the lacy panties. "mmmmmm.... you taste so good baby." he says before wrapping his lips around just the tip, tongue flicking at the slit.
"Good" Dean pulled him in for another kiss, soft and sweet. "Wanna snuggle on the couch and watch a movie?"
The first time it had happened,  it was a completely unintentional. Sam and Dean were eating lunch at a diner in a small town in Ohio when Castiel appeared in the booth next to Dean with information on the case they were working. As Castiel filled them in on the information he had obtained Dean saw something out of the corner of his eye. It took him a moment to realize he was seeing Cas' wings. They were nothing like he had expected, though he wasn't really sure what he had expected, because he hadn't given much thought to Cas even having wings, at least not in the physical sense. Dean slowly turned his head, trying to stay focused on what he was seeing. A couple of times he thought he may have lost them, but suddenly he was looking right at them. They were gorgeous, silver with ashen streaks running through them. Dean couldn't believe he hadn't seen them before, he was mesmerised, he couldn't even hear Cas and Sam talking anymore. Slowly he reached his hand out fingers timidly touching the feathers.  They were soft, and he could feel a kind of electricity running through his fingers. His fingers slid deeper into the feathers wrapping them around the warm bone, gently squeezing. A soft vibration ran up Dean's arm and sent a shudder through his body.  He let go, with a sigh and quickly looked around, but there didn't seem to be any sign from anyone that he was just fondling the angel's wings. Sam was talking with Cas eating his lunch, and Castiel had just continued filling them in. Save for the faint pink that ran along the edge of his ears, there was no indication at all that Dean just had his hands on him. Dean smiled softly, turning to finish his lunch and discussing the case at hand.
Cas had taken to hanging out with Dean in his room when the boys weren't on a case, even though he had his own room. If it were anyone else, Dean may be more than a little irritated, but this was Cas. After the fall Dean had found him wandering on the side of a back road. Whether it be random luck or divine intervention, Dean couldnt decide. All he knew was he was happy to have the former angel safe where he could keep an eye on him. And if Cas wanted to hang out in his room with him, that was perfectly fine, it saved him all kinds of anxiety about what kind of trouble he could get into, even within the confines of the bunker.
Castiel shoved his shoulder "That's not what I mean, though I definitely want more of that, lots more." He leaned in kissing him again "But beyond that...?"
Cas growls spinning them around and pushing Dean against the car. He lavishes kisses along his neck, scraping his teeth across his collar bone. As he slides his thigh in between Dean's legs, Dean lets out a soft moan, grinding his hardening cock down into him. "Easy there tiger" Cas says nibbling his ear. "What do you say we take this back to my place?"
Castiel placed his hand on the center console as he turned around to look. "Yea, she's out" He turned back around smiling. "Thank you for inviting me Dean. This was really fun."
Dean shrugged, "I've rented the room for a month, I figured that would give you enough time to look for an apartment, which you should. You can stay here, but in the long run, an apartment will be cheaper for you Cas. I asked, the Gas and Sip is only a couple blocks away, so you can walk to work. I'm gonna go get washed up before getting back on the road."
As the music faded at the end of the song Dean realized that he had leaned forward and his forehead was now resting against Cas'. How long had they been sitting there like that? Dean took in a deep breath as he sat up sharply, the ear buds falling out of both their ears. "I'm sorry Cas, guess I'm more tired than I thought. I'm going to call it a night ok?" Dean shifted back, breaking all physical contact with him.
"Dean, what are you doing? Where are we going?" Cas stammers, shocked but keeping up with Dean as he pulls him down the hallway toward his room.
Dean obliges before once again lowering himself between his legs. His lips, tongue and teeth teasing the skin all around his cock, without giving any attention to the pulsing hot member, inches from his face.
"You looked so peaceful, I didnt want to wake you, and I didnt want you to get cold. I figured I'd stay a while, didn't want to just head out without saying goodbye." Dean sat up on the couch and stretched a little.
Dean decides he simply cannot take any more of the slow torture. He sits up, pulling away from Cas as he grabs the fallen angel and pulls him up onto the bed laying him flat. Dean kisses him hard before trailing his lips down Cas' body. He swirls his tongue around Cas' delicious cock getting him nice and wet before positioning himself on top of him once again. He looks into Cas' eyes as he slowly lowers himself down onto Cas' dick. He moves slow, adjusting to the intrusion, and is soon sitting flush with Cas' hips. He lets go of the breath he was holding with a low moan. "mmm... feels better than I ever dreamed Cas" he says leaning forward taking the fallen angels lips with his as he starts to slowly rock his hips into him. Cas slides his tongue into his mouth as he runs his hands over Dean's thighs up to his hips holding tight as Dean's pace started to pick up. He let out a low moan into his mouth as Dean lifts up and slammed back down.
All Cas can think about is Dean fucking him. He wants him to grab him hard by the nape of his neck and throw him against the wall. To then crash his body against him, shoving him harder into the wall. Wants Dean's thigh to part his as he grinds his body against him, seeking the friction they both desperately desire. He want Dean's perfect pink lips to smash into his dry ones, kissing him brusingly hard, tongue thrusting into his mouth until they are both panting , gasping for air. Cas wants Dean to rip his clothes off and kiss lick and bite his way down his body, leaving a trail of marks that he will be able to see for days. So he can stand in front of the mirror and trace his fingers over them and remember...
Darla saw Dean at the door way and bounded toward him "Daddy! Daddy! Look! Santa came! And Castiel stayed over too! This is the best Christmas day ever! Can we open our gifts?" she said pulling at his t-shirt guiding him toward the tree.
"Hmmm, I don't know. Sounds like it could get a bit boring for me. But I think you should definitely do it." He smiled and winked at Castiel. "I'll even cover your shift at the store to give you a little more time for discussion."
"Hell yea Cas! You were amazing, all that screaming and moaning..." He turned motioning to the white streaks drying on the floor "The mess on the floor there, all good signs that it was to my satisfaction."
Dean bucked his hips into Castiel slowly, moaning and reaching down running his hands through his hair. When he just couldn't take it anymore, he reached up, unbuttoning his jeans, he needed to relieve some of the pressure. His dick was trapped in a denim prison and being tortured by the most gorgeous mouth he'd ever seen.  Castiel looked up at him, his face flushed, his lips pink and swollen, and "Fuck Cas,  you're so fucking perfect"
When Dean regained control of his breathing he rolled slowly to the side, pulling free of Castiel and removing the condom. He tied it off and tossed it to the garbage can. He propped his head up on his arm and looked lovingly at his blue eyed man. "Cas" he said using his free hand to turn his face toward him "You know how amazing you are right?"
"Well Cas, that was... uh..." Dean started, finding himself at a loss for words. "Well I think I'm gonna be sitting funny for a couple days"
Dean plunged his tongue into Castiel's mouth, licking his way in and around, tasting himself on his tongue and lips. He ran his hands down Castiel's body pulling his shirt up and off, breaking the kiss only long enough for the fabric to pass between them before his mouth was ravaging Castiel's lips and jaw once more. His teeth scraping over the delicate skin of his neck, his tongue running over the red marks he had left earlier. His hands ran down Castiel's body sliding them under the waistband of the pajama pants and grabbing his ass tightly pulling him into his body as his fingers pushed in between his cheeks. Dean broke the kiss with a gasp as his fingers met the slick eager hole "mmm Cas" Dean moaned into his neck "Fuck baby, you're so sweet, you got yourself all ready for me?" Dean continued to lick and nip at his throat as Castiel pushed back into his exploring fingers, biting Dean's fingers dipped into him. Dean gripped him tightly and turned him around, lifting him onto the counter, and pulling his pants off in one swift movement. He took a step back and just looked at Castiel, sitting naked on his kitchen counter. He was never going to be able to walk into this kitchen and not see this sight.  "God Cas you're so fucking beautiful"
"Dean... I ... ungh.... OH.... Ahhhh!" Cas cries out as his hip buck up into Dean, his orgasm ripping through him.
"You too Cas." Dean smiled, before turning toward the car. He paused and turned back around. "Hey Cas? Are you sure you wouldn't like to join us? I mean, I  know the service isn't really your thing, but Darla is singing and we're going to look at lights after. I'm sure Darla would really like it if you came." He looked up and smiled softly."I'd really like it too."
He had received the letter a week ago. It had come as a surprise, after the letter he received from Dean three months after the Winchesters moved, he hadn't heard anything more from him. Castiel was actually a little relieved, hoping that the young teen was able to move on from his crush on the next door neighbor. However, Castiel had felt a kind of warmth when he opened the letter postmarked from San Diego.
"Dean.... ungh... I need you." Cas murmers and he feels Dean freeze beneath him. Cas leans back and looks at him. "Dean?"
Sam and Dean had just gotten back from a routine hunt. As had become customary, Dean headed right to his room for a shower, washing away the grime of the road. When he walked out of the bathroom, towel wrapped around his waist, he saw that Cas was curled up on the loveseat in the corner of the room. A small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. He'd be lying if he said he hadnt missed him while they were away. There was a comfort to knowing Cas would be here, when he got back. And Dean wasnt a fool, he knew what that meant, what this was leading to in his heart, he simply didnt care. There was a purity to how this was all happening, and why shouldnt they be able to find some kind of peace after everything they had gone through together.
Cas ran his hands over Dean's chest, rubbing the muscles, and teasing his nipples, as he let himself get used to the fullness inside him. as his muscles began to relax, his hips began to move slowly, grinding down onto Dean, like he was trying to take his whole body into him. The moan that escaped Dean, only made him want to do it more. His muscles fluttered around Dean's thick cock, pulling the dirtiest noises from Dean's mouth. Oh yes, Cas was indeed in charge now.
The silence is deafening, Cas doesn't know what he can say to make Dean just take him back to the Gas and Sip without asking him more questions. The feeling of defeat is overwhelming, he has to just tell Dean the truth. "Nora pays me a fair wage and I, um, I have a sleeping bag there, I will catch some sleep in the back room, it's fine Dean. Please just drop me off there, and you can make your way back to the bunker."
I wasnt sure at first that this was going to happen, but then I decided I needed one more really steamy scene between these two... I worked on this off and on for a couple weeks... I hope you like it. Though, I do feel like the tone is a little different than the rest of the story. If I ever go back and edit this, that will definitely be something I work on. But for now, this was fun. And I hope ya'll have enjoyed my very first Destiel fanfic!
Dean laughed, pulling Castiel's face to his, kissing him gently "That was half the fun, I like it when you get all power hungry and dominate, its fucking hot as hell Cas." Dean licked his lips before running his tongue over Castiel's lips, licking his way into his mouth slowly, taking his time, really tasting Cas. When he pulled away Castiel sighed softly.
How Dean sank to his knees before him, lifting his leg over his shoulder before sucking his cock into his mouth, taking him down in one swallow. Leaving Cas so lost in his desire that he had to grab Dean by the hair just to be sure he didn't fall over. How Dean's dirty little mouth was able to make him feel so much pleasure that he was left speechless above him, moaning incoherently. Dean pulling him out of his mouth, licking lower until his tongue runs over Cas' sensitive opening, teasing only briefly before pushing a long digit into him making Cas gasp, tightening his fingers in Dean's hair. Dean stretching and opening him up until he  begged Dean to "fuck me". How Dean looked at him with burning passion as he stood up, slamming their mouths together with a growl. Fingers digging deep into his ass as he rolls their hips together, Cas' sensitive cock rubbing against the course denim of Dean's jeans. "Dean" he moaned into his mouth and Dean pulled back eyes wild with lust, just before...
Dean's eyes went wide when he heard John calling for him. It meant it was time to go. Castiel quickly cut the rest of the pie and put the pieces in individual containers for the trip. when they reached the door Dean stopped and turned to Castiel. "Mr. Novak?" He said, his pubescent voice cracking. "I need to tell you something" He cast his eyes toward the floor. "I... I'm going to miss you"
Castiel absently ran his hand over Dean's chest. "Jimmy and I helped each other discover, without judgment, who we are sexually. Guess that's the best part about being a twin. Before tonight though, Jimmy and I haven't so much as shared a kiss since we turned 16. I love him, obviously and am grateful for everything he's done for me, but we aren't together or anything. Besides, Jimmy actually prefers women." Castiel took note of the confusion on Dean's face. "I know, it really took me by surprise too."
Dean smiles to himself "Such a kinky angel I have" he says as he smacks his ass again, his hips not slowing in their thrusts as he quickly approaches his own orgasm. "you gonna come for  me again?" Dean growls into Cas' ear as he lays his body forward, teeth lightly grazing the skin.
Cas lowers his head, breaking eye contact as he licks the taste of Dean off his lips, sucking the lower one in savoring it before he speaks. "I'm..." he starts, hes... he's what exactly? sorry? no, he's not sorry... he wants Dean, he'll never be sorry for that. "I just wanted to know what that was like. I... I'm just lonely Dean. I've been so alone, and I've missed you." Cas looked watching Dean's face soften. "I'm not going to say sorry, I'm not sorry that I kissed you. I've wanted to do that for a long time, and since I lost my grace, since becoming human, those feelings have only grown stronger, you are all I think about." Cas waits for Dean to reply and Dean just stares at him. "It's ok Dean. You don't have to say anything. I just...I just couldn't hold back anymore. You were here, you were holding me, and that felt so nice. After all of those years of me comforting you, it felt nice to have you do that for me. And you're leaving me again, I just wanted to take a little bit to carry with me... It does...."
Weeks had passed since he had seen Dean, not trusting his newly forming feelings for the green eyes man not to take over all his reason. Tonight would be the first time he had not only seen Dean, but also be in his apartment with him. Castiel knew things would be ok though, because Dean's daughter Darla was staying with him tonight. She was the sweetest little girl with her daddy's smile, and Dean loved her so much. Castiel had never seen his eyes sparkle as much as they did when he was looking at Darla. Dean and Darla's mother had gotten divorced a couple years ago. And while Darla lived with her mother primarily, Dean spent every moment he could with her.
"Not yet Dean, I'm not ready for that yet." Cas repositioned himself, spreading Dean's legs, resting his left leg over Cas' right shoulder and settled in, face buried in the crook of Dean's groin. He inhaled deeply, breathing in Dean's musk. He smelled like leather and the deep woods. Cas nuzzled his nose into the warmth there, before running his tongue over the soft skin around his balls. He reached his hand out without looking, searching for the lube. Dean's breath hitched as the cool lube it his hot skin.
He felt the sudden emptiness as Cas pulled away, his hand now in front of Dean's face. "Lick it Dean, get it nice and wet." Dean obliged licking Cas' hand like it was a melting ice cream cone in the middle of summer. Cas pulled his hand away and Dean heard him undo his pants, and Cas sighed as he ran the wet hand over his own hard cock. He leaned over his body again, Dean felt his cock slide between his cheeks as he whispered in his ear "Are you ready?"
"Yea?" Castiel asked, watching a touch of disappointment flicker across Dean's face, he stepped in closer, bringing his mouth to his "A kiss can be even deadlier if you mean it" he said pressing his lips into Dean's. "Merry Christmas Dean"
Castiel turned back toward the tree and sighed deeply. His heart was racing and his stomach was in knots with nerves. Dean came out and walked up behind him, placing his hand on the small of his back, and even though he thought it would make him more nervous, instantly he felt relaxed, like this had happened a hundred times before.
Cas reached back grabbing the base of Dean's throbbing cock as he lifted up and scooted back into place, slowly lowering himself down. He bit his lip at the slight burn he wasnt fully prepped for this, but it felt so good, and he just wanted Dean inside of him. As soon as the head of Dean's cock pressed past the tight ring, Cas slid the rest of the way with ease, moaning loudly as their hips now lay flush against each other. His eyes fluttered open and he looked down at Dean, who was staring at him with full lust in his eyes, mouth gaping, ecstasy written all over his face.
Dean was completely lost in this moment, he hadnt moved at all, save for the rising and falling of his chest as he breathed in Cas. It wasnt until Cas moaned and hitched his hips slightly, that Dean realized he should be moving. Slowly his hips began moving and a whole new sensation rose through his body.
Cas smiles shyly leaning in and pressing his lips to Dean's. "I want you to, I need you to." He says kissing him again. "I need to feel you" he bites his lip, eyes flicking down to the front of Deans jeans then back up. "All of you"
Cas closes the distance between them wrapping his arm around Dean's waist pulling him into him. He presses their lips together as Dean wraps his arms around him. He feels Dean's tongue lick over his lips and he parts them, letting Dean slide into his mouth. His tongue meets Dean's gently at first as he feels his body come alive. He lets out a low moan pulling Dean closer, their cocks rubbing against each other.
"Yay!" Darla exclaimed, coming up next to Castiel and taking his hand. "Are you coming with us Castiel?"
"Cas hmm?" Castiel looks at him with a smirk, "I like it". He pressed his lips against his again. "And what do I call you?"
Dean grabbed his arm, just tight enough to stop his movements. "You are family Cas.  Darla is thrilled you are here. Please stay"
"Oh God Cas... I love this fucking ass of yours" Dean says as he brings his hand down hard on the skin.
"Come on Darla, we're going to be late" Dean yelled up to her. Castiel opened the door and waited for them to come out. The air was cool, but not nearly as cold as it would be normally. The winter had been unseasonably warm.
Dean bit his lip and nodded his head, not trusting he could even find his voice. Castiel reached forward and ran his hand up Dean's torso, pushing his shoulder's until Dean's legs kicked out and he was laying flat on his back. He then ran his nails down Dean's chest, scratching red lines into his tan skin. When Castiel rested his hand on Dean's hip for a moment, Dean took that cue and rolled over onto his stomach, his knees pulling up and popping his ass into Castiel's face in one smooth movement.
"Well Cas, that was... uh..." Dean started, finding himself at a loss for words. "Well I think I'm gonna be sitting funny for a couple days"
Castiel thought for a moment, he really had no plans and couldn't think of anywhere he'd rather be. "I'd love to stay Dean."
"Oh, Cas, you feel so good. I love the way your skin feels against mine." Dean threw his head back as Castiel kissed his throat, nipping the sensitive skin eliciting a gasp as his hands ran down the Hunter's back and firmly grabbed his ass.
When he's alone again Dean sits on the stool by his laptop, trying to process what was happening to him. On one hand he was pissed at Meg, he hated how she treated him like he didn't know what he was doing, even though she was never there to run her own business. On the other hand he felt a spark of something burning in his gut as he thought about the way Cas had looked at him. Those eyes still got to him after all these years.
When Cas' thrusts became erratic and Dean could tell he was close, he placed one hand on his hip and pushed him down into the bed. His other hand gripped the base and began to work his cock with his hand and his mouth focused on the sensitive tip. He could hear Cas' breathing growing more and more ragged, and the Angel's eyes kept flitting closed as he was losing himself.
"just... No, never mind. You sure you're okay?" Dean asks leaning in a little. His eyes flick to Sammy at the end of the table. "Something you want to talk to me about?"
Cas turned and walked down the sidewalk toward the classic black car waiting for him. Dean was standing on the other side of the car, on his phone. When he turned to face him, Cas felt warmth and comfort wash over him. Things had been so hard for him lately, at times he was afraid he wouldn't be able to make it on his own. Even though he hadn't been happy to see him when he'd shown up unannounced at the Gas n Sip earlier, he was most assuredly glad that Dean was here now.
I wanted to send you a letter to say I'm sorry if I made you feel awkward the day we left. But I also wanted to say thank you for not making me feel foolish. I really wish that you would have kissed me, but I understand why you didn't.
Castiel opened the oven and pulled out the apple pie with his mitted hands. He heard the knock at the door he had been waiting for. Just like always, little Dean Winchester was just in time for his pie.
Cas stood frozen by the door for a long while before moving further into the room. It was small, but clean. There was a small couch on the far side of the room and a small dresser as well with a tv on top. By the window to the right of the door, there was a table with two chairs. To the left of the door there was a small nook with a very small stove, a refrigerator that sat on top of a cupboard in the corner, and a single basin sink, sunk into the small counter top. Cas ventured into the room and sat on the edge of the bed and waited for Dean.
Castiel stood up, his hand slapping Dean's bare ass once, before he slowly pushed his dick into his wet ready hole. They both moaned as the tip of his cock pushed in. Cas paused a moment, but when Dean rotated his hips, he slipped the rest of the way in, and again they moaned together. Dean was lost in the sensation of Castiel filling him up, thrusting slowly.
Dean smiles wickedly, pressing hard into him again, "Sure thing Cas." He plants another hard kiss on Castiel's lips. "So where is this bedroom you mentioned?"
When she heard him stirring behind her she quickly got up and ran over to him with the biggest smile on her face and her eyes full of sparkle. "Castiel! It's Christmas! Look,  Santa came!" she said jumping around.
Then the winchester's move and Dean confesses his giant crush on Cas before he goes and Cas thinks its adorable because Dean's so young and Dean asks for a kiss but Cas only gives him one on the forehead.
"you look incredible angel. I don't think you realize the effect that you have on me." Dean says as he strips off his own clothes. His hard cock weighing heavy between his legs.
"Dean, you didn't have to pray to me." Cas said pulling back from Dean's mouth. "And as I said before, this shower is completely unnecessary, I can clean us up without the need for water. "
"Cas, seriously, there's no way Nora pays you enough to practically be living there. Besides, you've had kind of a rough night. Let me take you home so you can get some sleep."
When Cas walked out of the room, he looked around, but Dean was not back yet. Not sure what to do with himself in just his towel, he decided to lay down on the bed and wait for Dean to return. He must have been more tired than he realized, closing his eyes just for a moment, he fell asleep, not even hearing the door open, when Dean returned. Before he opened his eyes, he heard the soft voices coming from the TV, he rolled over and cracked his eyes, the only light in the room was coming from the tv, and he could just barely make out Dean laying on the couch. "Dean?" he asked softly.
"Jimmy, are you sure? We can definitely still all play, there's enough fun to be had for all." Castiel turned and watched as his twin walked to the door.
Cas growls spinning them around and pushing Dean against the car. He lavishes kisses along his neck, scraping his teeth across his collar bone. As he slides his thigh in between Dean's legs, Dean lets out a soft moan, grinding his hardening cock down into him. "Easy there tiger" Cas says nibbling his ear. "What do you say we take this back to my place?"
Dean's left panting when he pulls away, and finally manages to find his voice. "not cats... but it seems like Cas likes it." He says with a smile.
Sam finally looked up at Dean. "And why exactly is that Dean!? What's so wrong with Cas that I cannot be in love with him?"
"What about him?" Dean asks, of course he knew who she was talking about, she talked about him all the time... all the girls talked about the smooth talking exchange student fom France. Dean wasn't so impressed by Balthazar, sure he would admit that he was very attractive, but there was just something a little off , even though Dean couldn't quite pinpoint what that was. He looked across the room and noticed how close the two of them were standing next to each other.
Dean smiles, "thats a little better" he says leaning forward and rewarding Cas with a light kiss. His tongue flicking across his lips, before his own lips just barely graze Cas'. "more?" he asks barely more than a whisper. Keeping his mouth just out of reach.
Castiel pumped his finger in and out of Dean, reveling in the sounds the man was making before him, when he felt the resistance loosen, he added another gently and paused a moment when he heard Dean hiss. When he felt Dean relax and push back into his hand he once again began pumping and scissoring his fingers in and out of him, and quicker than he expected, Dean was silently begging for more, and Castiel added a third finger.
"Oh" was all Dean could manage as he looked into the Angel's eyes. "and what do you feel when I touch you like this?" Dean tightened his grip on his wing, and a white hot heat filled his body. Dean's breath came quick and heavy as he staggered back from Castiel's touch. "shit Cas" Dean said when he finally regained control of his breathing. He had a new found respect for Cas and his ability to control that kind of pleasure. He looked down at the wet spot that now spread across the front of his jeans. Not ashamed at all that he had literally just came in his pants. "that's how you feel everything touch your wings?"
Up until now he had let Dean steer this ride, but now he wanted a turn at the wheel. Dean froze above him as Castiel wrapped his arms firmly around Dean's torso holding him in place. He bent his knees, planting his feet firmly against the bed and began thrusting up into him like a wild rabbit. Dean was making noises that Castiel had never heard before, his eyes rolling back into his head and he fucked him. Using strength he didnt know he would still have, he flipped them over onto Dean's back. Dean instinctively wrapped his legs around Castiel's waist as he continued thrusting into him with wild abandon.
"Thank you." Castiel threw back the blanket and stood, coming face to face with Dean,  he felt the blood rushing to his cheeks and ears and he swallowed hard. God he was so beautiful.
"Damn Cas, I like it when you're bossy, makes me all tingly" Dean said as he grabbed the small foil packet and bottle of lube.
Castiel kept his eyes locked on Dean's as he took him fully into his mouth. He tasted amazing and Castiel loved the feel of him in his mouth, the tip of his dick pressing hard against his throat as he bobbed his head down. He watched Dean's face his perfect lips forming an 'O' as he in turn watched Castiel. He ran his hands over Dean's thighs, reaching back and cupping his balls and Dean thrust hard into his mouth, shoving his dick even further down his throat. Castiel pulled his mouth off taking a deep breath "Fuck my face Dean"
You see, there was this one guy... Then again, there's always a guy isn't there? But this guy, he was THE guy, or at least thats what I thought at the time. Love at first sight, you know the drill. Beautiful blue eyes, the kind of smile that could pull anyone out of the deepest darkness. And it was amazing, wining and dining me all over the city, until my head was spinning, I was flying high on a cloud over everyone else, could this have been what love was like? And then suddenly, he was gone, and the darkness returned, I thought for sure that I would never find that happiness again.
Dean felt the deep pooling warmth in this stomach as Cas continued to ride him. "Oh FUCK Cas.... I'm so close.... ungh!" Cas sat up, forcing Dean's cock in far as it could go and stared rotating his hips, grinding their pelvis' together, and started doing that delicious thing again where his muscles fluttered and twitched around him. Dean felt his orgasm build from his toes and it racked his entire body, lifting him off of the bed as it rushed through him. His load filled Cas so full, that it was leaking out of him even though neither of them had moved. Dean collapsed back onto the bed, breathing ragged as Cas milked his cock through the rest of his orgasm.
SPOILERS for "Hunt, Chase, Wait".  If you haven't read that one yet, you're welcome to pop back in when you're done.  I'll hold your spot.
Cas huffed a cleansed snicker into the air as he followed at his heels.  As he crossed the bedroom’s threshold a vibrant colorful desire whisked into their light hearted closeness.  Words sat too heavy on their tongues to stand upright.  Dean closed the door behind him and cocked his head towards the bed, now their bed, watching him walk the few feet with bubbling urgency.  This time the angel left the tether bare, open, and lax.  Mouth to mouth, skin to skin, bone to bone, every interaction bounced back between them like an every diminishing echo.  The agent’s lascivious scrutiny felt like wide tongued licks of desire across Cas’s skin.  Even without turning his head, he could feel the currents trudge up that want for friction through every fiber.  Cas turned to face the agent and stretched long to the ceiling, pulling his shirt up from its southern hem to expose that mirrored want, let it seep from his being.  Dean’s lust heavy pupils traveled up and down his lithe masculine form.  Fingers begged for the mercy of his open touch. Tongue begged for the salvation of the angel’s taste.  How he clambered to worship his every facet.  The agent took up his post a hair’s breath away him, wishing all his sweet textures were absorbed by his wondering fingertips.  The angel seemed to shutter lightly under his touch and all at once any clothing seemed like an unnecessary abundance.  Admiring Cas’s acute and obtuse angles became a full time job ever since their first foray testing the mattress.  The splendid mechanism that led to the hastened rise and fall of his divine chest, the miracle that imprisoned all the blue of the world in his striking eyes, the crisp facial features that softened under his fondling touch – every piece echoed the perfection of the whole.  Once at long last disrobed, Dean set to confirming the divine nature of his all components with his own two hands.  Cas looked on with open mouthed appreciation, urging him on with little flicks of the tongue across his bottom lip and long blinks to keep himself collected and more importantly upright.
Garth’s smile was labored as he motioned Castiel follow him past the swinging doors into the warehouse.  At nearly a stage whisper, he announced their change of venue but the charged energy in the room remained stagnant, the pair not budging an inch to make room for the other.
Dean had gone for a drive, he was going stir crazy holed up in that motel room with Sam doing research on their latest case and he needed air. Driving baby had always calmed him, the nice crisp fall air coming through the windows and the low purr of the engine helped him clear his mind. Well clear his mind from the case they were currently working on anyway. As it often did when he was alone, his thoughts turned to Castiel, those beautiful blue eyes, and his lips, they way they always seemed to be chapped. Dean wanted to run his tongue over them, get them nice and wet before venturing deeper into his mouth, discovering the taste of the angel. Wanted to make him moan, he wanted to  feel Cas fall apart under him with pleasure. He thought about how Cas looked with that trenchcoat, how sexy it was, but also how much he wanted to see what was underneath all those layers. Damn, why did he wear so many layers, he wanted to see his muscles move under his skin, wanted to run his hands over his body and make him writhe. Watch his eyes go wide and his face soften as he took him into his mouth. Dean bit his lip, "Damn" he said aloud as he palmed his dick through his jeans.
"No" Castiel interrupted "you don't have to explain. I completely understand, Darla is number one priority." he smiled and touched Dean's hand.
So what I have done is left it at a point where it's up to you. You can let your dirty little mind take you to all the places you want it to between them, and still have the morning after be as it is given to us, or you can rewrite the story as it happened cononically. You could also let it all be a dream, and not have to face he questions of if they were together for those blissfully sexy hours, why did they still part ways in the morning....
"It's gonna be a long 53 days, but I think I can manage, if we can still do movie club, maybe once a week? Just so we can have a little personal time?" Castiel placed his hand on Dean's thigh tilting his head slightly.
Castiel stands in the doorway to the kitchen looking out at the table where the beautiful green eyed man sat. He smiled when he looked up at him, he nodded his head toward the back door and then went to wait for him.
After a few moments when their breathing started to steady, Cas made to move, before remembering Dean's wrists were still bound and wrapped around his neck. With a soft chuckle, Dean lifted his arms over Cas' neck. Cas rolled over to his back, pulling out of Dean with a wet pop, and Dean moaned at the sudden loss.
"Didn't I tell you Jimmy. Didn't I tell you that very first night, I knew he was going to be perfect." Castiel moved down beside Dean and kissed him. "I told Jimmy he could have first ride on your cock. But I'm going to be the first one to tap that fine ass of yours." Castiel leaned down and took Dean's nipple into his mouth, first sucking then biting down hard, before soothing his tongue over it. "How does that sound Dean, want me to fuck you so hard I can make you come again, even after Jimmy milks you soft with his tight ass?" Castiel looked up at Dean with his brilliant blue eyes.
Cas lifts his eyes and looks into Dean's face, concern written all over it. He can't say the words, so he simply nods.
The dream had started off as just two friends getting together and having a couple drinks with dinner, and had ended with Castiel pushed up against the kitchen counter with Dean's tongue down his throat and grinding his hard cock into his thigh. He had woken covered in sweat with a raging hard on that absolutely had to be taken care of immediately. the image of Dean standing before him, pulling his shirt off is what had taken him over the edge.
Dean let out a low growl "I do now." he said slipping his tongue into Castiel's mouth kissing him until they were both breathless again. At some point during their make-out session, they had moved to the couch, and their kissing transformed from fast and needy to slow and lazy. Neither of them took notice when exactly the kissing had stopped and it wasn't long after that that they both dozed off, Dean laying back on the couch with Castiel tucked snugly between his legs, arms wrapped around his torso, head resting on his chest.
Dean pops the driver's door and slides into the seat behind the wheel, where he looks more at home than any place Cas has ever seen him. Without a word he closes the door and starts the car, the engine roaring to life, and sending the familiar rumble through Cas' body. Every passing moment is one closer to having to say goodbye again, and Cas just is not ready for that. He turns and looks as his profile, light moving over his face highlighting different features as they drive down the street.
Dean's eyes fly open and he sits up in bed, his heart pounding in his chest. He's trying to catch his breath as he feels a hand run up his back soothingly. He turns his head and smiles, laying back down taking the hand in his own, kissing it softly before holding it over his heart.
Cas stopped just before him, his blue eyes locking with his own. "You don't know this yet, but we've had this conversation Dean. I know how you feel about me, how you've always felt about me." His lips spread into a wide grin as he ran his other hand down over Dean's crotch, feeling the bulge that was straining against his zipper. "besides if I didn't already know" his hand presses harder against his cock "this would give you away" Cas moves in closer to Dean, and he can feel his heart racing, his eyes flicking from Cas' blue ones to his own slightly older, more tired green ones and then back again. His tongue runs over his bottom lip as he lets his uncertainty go, leaning in and taking the fallen Angel's mouth with his own.
Cas doesn't hold back, lettting out the dirtiest moan as he rolls his hips back onto Dean's hand. "Dean!... ungh... more... I ... nnn..need more..... please!"
When their breathing slowed, Dean rolled to his back and Castiel wrapped his body around him, laying his chest on Dean's chest. It was a few more moments before Castiel tilted his head and looked up at Dean."Can I ask you a question?"
"Dean, ngh, I never ....fuck you're so tight..." Cas murmurs as he wraps his fingers around Dean's cock.
What makes me ask this (aside from my love of Destiel and wanting to give them time together even if its off screen) is a simple matter of timeline continuity. Ok, Cas showed up at her house at 7, and we already know Nora's date was a flop, but still we will say that its about 10:30 pm when they leave her house. Lets also assume that the Gas and Sip opens the same time most gas stations do, say 7 am... ok, so Dean drops him off a little early, but the sun is risen, so for the sake of arguement lets say its 6 am... that still leaves about 7 - 8 hrs of time unaccounted for...
The first time Dean touched himself thinking about Cas, in the back seat of the impala, Cas could almost feel the sensations, and it drove him wild.
Dean leaned down and licked the tip, lapping up the precum that was coating it. Cas tasted like he smelled, like the earth, just after the rain fell. As he pulled his mouth away Cas' hips rose to follow him. Dean let out a soft chuckle. "Yea baby, I want more too, but we gotta get the rest of these cloths off first." he said, grabbing the waist of his pants, and tugging down "Now, help me out here Cas, lift your ass." Cas did and Dean pulled his pants to his ankles before he realized Cas still had his shoes on. He quickly removed them and finished pulling off his pants, which went flying across the room.
Cas kisses his lips slowly "Just take control of me so you can have exactly what you want. " He says biting his own lip.
"Well yea, I mean, think about it. Cas is great, he's been there for us so many times. He tries his hardest to help whenever he can, even if sometimes he sometimes strays in his attempts." Sam hadn't even looked up at Dean, he was still staring at the screen on his laptop.
When Dean was easily taking his fingers, and the small winces had turned completely to whimpers and moans, Castiel hooked his finger, searching for that spot that would...Dean gasped and moaned loudly his hips hitching back grinding down onto Castiel's hand... there it was. Now that he knew right where it was Castiel, gently grazed the bundle of nerves with every thrust.
"Get on top of me Dean, I want you to ride my face" Dean's eyes widened, and even Castiel had to admit, he was a little shocked at the words that had come out of him. But it was true, he wanted to eat Dean, wanted to feel him writhe on top of him. Dean only hesitated a moment, before leaning in for another kiss and then climbed on top of him, his knees straddling Castiel's head. Castiel wasted no time working Dean's cock, thick and heavy resting against his face as Dean rutted against him. Castiel licked and kissed the flesh he could reach.
Castiel juggled the two cups of hot coffee in his hands as he climbed out of his car and closed the door. He silently cursed himself for not asking for a carrier. Stacking the cups on top of one another in one hand, he turns the handle on the door with the other.  Greeted with the sudden warmth and faint smell of Dean's cologne as he steps into the foyer, he closes the door and heads up the stairs. He hears the low rumble of Dean's voice as he reaches the top of the stairs and looking around he sees Dean sitting in his office talking on the phone. When Dean sees him he mouths an "I'm sorry". Cas hands him his mocha and sets his coffee on the desk before shrugging out of his jacket and kicking off his boots.
He turned his head, biting into the thick flesh of Dean's thigh, making him flinch and grind down harder onto his face. Castiel got lost in the smell and taste of Dean as he licked every inch he could reach, sucking his balls into his mouth and rolling his tongue over them, his hand still stroking his cock. Dean moved a fraction of an inch higher and Castiel has full access to his hole, licking and probing it until Dean was moaning his name above him.
I guess this has become my Tuesday ritual... breakfast in bed while typing away... I hope you like where i am headed... though i know quite a few of you may be a little upset (maybe frustrated would be a better word for it) where I leave you at the end of this chapter... I promise to try and get Chapter 7 to you later this evening...
He turned onto a dirt road and found a place tucked back to park the car. There was no way he was going back to the motel without getting this taken care of first. He turned off the engine and climbed into the back seat where he'd have more room to stretch his legs. Unzipping his jeans, he reached into his boxers and wrapped his hand around his already rock hard dick and pulled it out, the cool air hitting it made him hiss and he threw his head back on the door. His thoughts returned to Cas, his angel and those eyes, that mouth, his gruff voice that seemed to elicit dirty thoughts even when Dean was trying his hardest to ignore his feelings. Dean began rubbing his hand over his length, running his thumb over the head  in between each stroke. He thought of Cas, laying next to him, watching him jerk off, of Cas tentatively reaching out and holding his hand, watching it run up and down, faster and faster. Dean moaned aloud as his palm ran over the head of his cock grabbing the bead of precum that was there and running it down the sensitive underside of his cock. He thought of Cas, and his curiosity, wanting to watch. Dean wanted to show Cas so much, he wanted to show him passion and all the delightful sins of pleasure. He wanted to see Cas wrecked, reduced to whimpers and moans  beneath him. The sounds he'd make, "Oh" Dean gasped, orgasm ripping through his body at the thought. "Oh.... Cas... *ungh*..."
Cas smiles shyly leaning in and pressing his lips to Dean's. "I want you to, I need you to." He says kissing him again. "I need to feel you" he bites his lip, eyes flicking down to the front of Deans jeans then back up. "All of you"
Castiel took Dean's hand and led him down the hall to his bedroom. Once they were in the room, Dean pulled Castiel into him hard. Dean's hands ran over and down Castiel's body,  finding their place once again on his ass,  grinding their hips together. His devilish tongue was doing amazing things in his mouth and Castiel soon realized that air was completely overrated compared to the things Dean's mouth was doing to him.  The effect Dean was having on him was one that no other man ever had.  Lust and desire was building in him quickly, his own hands exploring Dean's muscular form.
"Sorry" I said softly as I moved out of his way, unable to find any other words, as I watched his bow legs carry him farther and farther away.
"you ok Cas?" Dean said "That wasn't to forward of me was it?" His hold on him started to loosen as he went to back away.
He heard water running in the bathroom and turned back to look as Dean walked out, stripped of his T-shirt and sweats. Cas' breath caught, he of course had seen the hunter naked before, but Dean had never been aware of his presence. There was something  about the confidence that radiated from him now that Cas found completely alluring. The way his muscles moved under his flushed skin as he slowly walked toward him. His beautiful mostly soft cock swaying between his perfectly bowed legs. This sight alone could have made him hard, if he wasn't already, but he did feel his cock twitch with desire. Mine, is all he could think.
"Well, you know that foreign exchange kid? Balthazar, the dreamy one with the muscles?" She smiles and her cheeks blush even more.
"How's that feel baby? Hmmm" Dean whispered leaning over him and kissing his chest, fingers still expertly thrusting in and out of him.
Cas' hips were moving in a slow but steady way, desperately seeking more of Dean' attention. His mouth moved without words before his voice finally broke from his throat. "Dean..." he whined, voice rough "Please.... Ooohhh, please Dean. I want you.... I want you to fuck me..."
Dean walked over to where he had set his bag and started pulling out cloths. "Shower's free Cas, you should clean up."
"Yes, did it first thing this morning, like I always do. " Dean tells her. "I have also e-mailed you a list of leads I have on some nice pieces, when you get the chance to look at them"
Castiel only had a brief second to take in the sight before he was suddenly shoved back into the house and up against the wall. Dean's hard body pressing up against him, one leg slotted between Castiel's thighs, his face mere inches from his face. "I'm ready for my grown up kiss now Mr. Novak." Dean smiled before crushing his lips into Castiel's mouth, his tongue running along his lips until Castiel parts them giving in and letting Dean lay full claim on him.
"Mr. Winchester, please have a seat" Mr. McLeod said pointing to the chair in front of his desk. Dean sits down and waits for him to fill him in on what happened with Sam. Dean could hardly believe Sam would hit anyone, but being as he did, there must have been a damn good reason for it.
Castiel grabbed dean's hips and stopped his movement. "Dean, wait." Castiel said moving his head to look at Dean. "Are you telling me you're a virgin?"
"Gimme what I want, and you'll get what you want" Dean says pinching his nipple hard. "let me hear you.... say my name" he whispers into his ear.
Castiel grabbed his coat and walked through the house. Darla was already down stair and let the dog out. Castiel joined her at the bottom of the stairs and waited for Dean. Darla let the dog back in and took him upstairs as Dean came down.
Castiel watched as the Winchesters pulled away from him, Dean sitting in the back watching and waving as they drove down the street. He sighed, thinking about Dean's confession. He had no idea Dean felt that way, he was such a good kid, and Castiel was really going to miss him and the rest of the family, and he really was going to miss making them pies.
"Of course Cas." Dean pressed play again. This time as the music started Dean mimicked Cas, looking down toward where their knees were touching. He closed his eyes and let himself get carried into the song. It was one of his favorites, but really there weren't many Zeppelin songs that he hadnt at one point or another concidered his favorite.
The room quickly fills with the sound of skin slapping again skin as Cas slams his cock inside Dean,  both panting and moaning out the other's name. Cas shifts his thrusts and Dean screams out his name when he slams full force into his prostate.  He's so happy he agreed to the date with Crowley,  because otherwise he would have never met this amazing angel who was making him feel things he'd never felt before.  He pulls hard against his binds,  wanting desperately to see Cas' face. He forces his hips down to the bed,  Cas' cock sliding of of him with a wet popping noise, quickly rolling  over and wrapping his legs up and around Cas' waist, rolling his hips up into him.  Cas looks at him stunned "I...  I needed to see you..."  Dean says,  his eyes searching Cas' ocean blue ones for forgiveness.  A mischievous grin spreads across Cas' face "look at you, all desperate and needy"  he breathes out running his hand along Dean's body.  Dean bites his lip whining,  hitching his hips into Cas' again,  his ass catching Cas' dick as he does.  He's able to push enough to get the head of his cock back in his ass,  but the tie binding his wrists prevents him from pushing back further.  "please Cas....  N.. N.. Need your fat cock inside me..."  Dean locks eyes with him,  desperately pleading with him which Cas apparently  can't resist as he thrusts hard into him,  ramming the head of his cock right into his prostate "Oh fuck Cas! Oh god! Nungh.... "  he moans as Cas continues to slam into him.  His hands roaming his body,  tweaking his nipples sending new pleasures through his body until his cock feels like it's going to explode.  "C.. Cas...."  he moans out watching his angel's face above him.  "p...Please... I need to come,  please let me come"  Cas breath quickens as he leans down bringing his face close to Dean's as they share the same air between them.  "not yet tiger,  I'm... Mmmm...  So close....  Wanna taste you"  he stutters out as his hips keep up their bruising pace.  Dean's lost in his staved orgasm,  he feels like he might bust his load through the cock ring,  but the promise of being able to come in Cas' mouth  is enough  to encourage him to hold on.
Dean slides his hands down, pushing Cas' trousers and briefs to the floor at their feet. He then runs his hands over his shoulders, dropping his shirt to the floor. Dean takes a step back looks at Cas from head to toe and Cas suddenly feels the urge to run, hide, pretend this never happened. But there's a hunger in Dean's eye that keeps him standing where he is. "you're more beautiful than I imagined Cas." Dean says softly.
Dean pushes the door closed behind him and takes a bold move toward Cas, and Cas is certain this must still be a dream, but people who are dreaming don't know that they are dreaming right? Dean is taking another step toward him, and Cas feels his heart racing in his chest. "Cas... Can I ..." He says softly coming to a stop before him, tongue flicking over his lips as he one again looks down at Cas' hands on his belt.
Dean felt like he was in a dream, lost in the pleasure still surging through his body as they both lay there, riding their climaxes together. Reality crashing in as Cas stood up and backed away from him. Dean pushed himself up off the table, turning to face Castiel, who was zipping up his pants, and straightening his clothing, eyes cast to the floor. Dean bent down and pulled up his jeans, when he looked up again, Cas was looking at him.
"You mean when I caught you in the corner with the guy you claim you don't have a crush on?" Charlie says, teasingly
Castiel opened the oven and pulled out the apple pie with his mitted hands. He heard the knock at the door he had been waiting for. Just like always, little Dean Winchester was just in time for his pie.
Dean pulls back, keeping just out of reach, barely a whisper between their lips. He flicks his tongue out catching Cas' lips before grabbing the blindfold. "do you trust me?" he asks.
That was all Castiel was waiting for, he lunged up, licking a thick wet stripe from Dean's balls to the tip, where he swirled his tongue gathering the bead of precum that had formed, before running his tongue back down to the base, then capturing his balls with his lips, sucking them both into his mouth. Dean let out a guttural moan above him and leaned forward, catching himself on the counter.
"Listen Cas, I completely appreciate, and actually love, that you enjoy that song so much. But how can you ever truly know if its good if you don't have anything to compare it to." They reach Dean's room and go in before Dean lets Cas' wrist go. "Go sit we're going to listen to some different songs." He walks over to the closet and grabs his ipod docking station, still in the box. He sets it up on the night stand before grabbing his ipod and setting it into the dock. Cas is kneeling in the middle of the bed watching Dean closely.
Dean chuckled before grabbing the back of Castiel's head and pulling him into a deep kiss. "I'm going to devour you later. I hope you know that." he sighed
"MMMM.... Cas, you feel so good.... You're so warm" Dean murmered agains Cas' mouth. Kissing his way down his jawline and burying his face into the crook of his neck.
The dream had started off as just two friends getting together and having a couple drinks with dinner, and had ended with Castiel pushed up against the kitchen counter with Dean's tongue down his throat and grinding his hard cock into his thigh. He had woken covered in sweat with a raging hard on that absolutely had to be taken care of immediately. the image of Dean standing before him, pulling his shirt off is what had taken him over the edge.
Dean takes a moment to think, what would be worse, Cas hearing what was practically a confession of his feelings from his own lips, or read by their teacher. Dean decides there's no way he could possibly read the story himself, so he stands and takes it to Mrs. Moseley's desk "Will you read it please?"
"I'm gonna go home" I tell her, knowing by look on her face she's just found tonight's bit of fun, and in exactly 10 minutes I would be sitting there alone. I grabbed my laptop bag, paid for the drinks, kissed her head and walked toward the door.
Dean let go of his cock and gripped his thighs, sliding him toward the edge of the counter and closer to him. He pushed up on his thighs and lined himself up with Castiel, pushing softly watching as the head disappeared in the tight ring of muscle. Dean felt Castiel clench around the intrusion and he paused allowing him time to adjust. When he felt Castiel roll his hips he pushed in further until his balls were resting on his ass. "Oh fuck Cas" Dean let out in a sigh "You're so tight baby, God you feel so good" he pulled back just a little and pushed deep into him causing them both to moan. He leaned forward and took Castiel's mouth in a wet kiss. He thrust slowly into Castiel, still letting him adjust.
"Cas, seriously, there's no way Nora pays you enough to practically be living there. Besides, you've had kind of a rough night. Let me take you home so you can get some sleep."
Dean furrows his brow slightly "So, am I just going to drive aimlessly, or are you going to tell me where you're staying?"
Cas simply shrugged, sitting back down on the couch looking at the floor. "Are you certain you don't mind me staying here? I can go whenever you want, I don't want to be a bother."
It was another moment or two when Darla came back in the living room with a plate of cookies in one hand and a glass of milk in the other. She set them on the small table next to the tree and turned to Castiel. "Castiel, will you be here in the morning after Santa comes?"
Dean bit his lip, glancing down shyly before his eyes looked back at Castiel. "Yes. I told you I've been waiting for this for 6 years. I've never wanted to be with anyone but you. You don't have to be afraid of hurting me though. I have toys, so I know what to expect. But you are the first person I've been with. I've been waiting for you Cas. I only ever want you." Dean placed a soft kiss on Castiel's lips. "Don't make me wait any longer Cas. 6 years is a long time, I need you.... I need you inside me" Dean pressed his mouth into Castiel's again and started lowering himself down again.
Castiel placed one hand on his cock holding it in place as Dean lowered himself down. He watched Dean's face carefully as his heat enveloped him slowly. He hadn't realized he was even holding his breath until Dean was fully seated on his hips and the air escaped his lungs in gust. Dean swallowed hard and let out a low moan. "Oh god." he breathed, leaning forward slightly, resting his forehead against Castiel's "you feel amazing" Dean's tongue flicked out over his bottom lip before sucking it in between his teeth. His hips moved a little as his muscles relaxed around Castiel.
"You, just you." Castiel paused looking up at Dean, a soft smile pulling the corner of his mouth. "The first night you came into the store, I went home and told Jimmy about you, and I've been talking about you every night since. Jimmy knows me better than I even know myself sometimes. He knew immediately that I had a crush, and he also knew that I would never act on it. After he met you at the store, he came up with the plan to seduce you together. His only stipulation was that he wanted to ride you first, after that, he said I could have you all to myself. I didn't agree right away, I didnt want to share you with anyone, not even with Jimmy. But I just couldn't build up the courage by myself, Jimmy even tried helping me when we were working together and you'd come in. I just, I couldn't stand the thought of you saying no and then not coming anymore. This way I figured, if Jimmy started things and you weren't down for it, he'd be the one you'd  awkward with, not me. I'm a coward, but I just didnt want to lose you."
“I’m aware of that,” he said, drawing him out.  His tone and body language reclined into careful observation.
, he grinned and swooped down for a prolonged, sensuous kiss, excavating an overcrowded moan Cas had holed up before he would move one.  He sat back up and bent a bowed knee to the side to expose all of his fantastic parts for his partner’s pleasure and careful demonstration.  He caressed his own nipple for a moment, letting Cas’s eyes travel down to his member which flexed upwards in delightful agitation.  The blues he had come to love in all their shades were barely obscured by his eyelashes as he failed to blink in the midst of such a show.  Dean to rested Cas’s twitchy fingers along his excited member, to encourage him to verify for himself how incredibly turned on Dean was.  Cas immediately took to tugging and twisting his wrist.  Dean’s focus skittered with each upstroke, but full on derailed as he swept his thumb across his moist head.
“Local police wouldn’t cooperate on a search for him since he was not being held on formal charges.  The bureau is just lucky he hasn’t gone to the press with his story of how we kept him cuffed to a bed for days on end on a weak handed trespassing misdemeanor.”
“We have to come up with $120 grand in three weeks or we lose Bobby’s house?  I lose Claire’s new home?  Am I hearing that right?” he demanded clarification gruffly.
Pounding feet stalked behind them and Sam looked over his shoulder to spot Dean just as he pulled Charlie by the back of the collar.
“I’m gotta get to the office to keep an eye on things, make sure no one misses a certain scruffy mute while I work things out on my end.”  Without taking the effort to stop him, he walked back into his bedroom at the end of the hall to get changed for work with the stranger a few feet behind him.  The doors were already swung open to the half empty closet, so he grabbed the first coordinated suit his hands landed on and stripped down to change.  The stranger took an inventory of what laid on his side table and sat at the edge of the barely made bed, paying very little attention to the man disrobing a few feet from him.  If conceit ran in his blood at all he might have been offended, but he continued to give him the rundown of what he could do to amuse himself in the house for the next nine or ten hours he would be gone.
The first door on the left “A7” housed what looked like hundreds of boxes made of thin pale wood, like large untreated cigar boxes.  Not wanting to leave any fingerprints, he pushed on one of the bottom shelf boxes with a gloved open hand, guessing its contents by how much the box resisted.  They were weighty and filled to brim, full of paper maybe.  Stories of this place littered his childhood memories, so the unquenchable urge to snoop played his id like a harp.  Again he checked his watch, vigilant in his desire not to end up in jail for trespassing – or worse locked up in a tomb of his own making.
His focus darted around the room, trying to pick out what would be out of place.  Lastly his eyes leapt to the headphones and a peculiar squint overmastered his brow.  His hand left open to Cas’s exploration closed halfway withdrawing his palm from easy access.  He looked down at the comforter and swallowed any word balloons he previously intended to fill.
“This is Cas,” Dean’s demeanor softened.  “He’s been to Hell and back twice to save us.  He’s been our one angel cavalry for years, got us out of the toughest spots ever.  Why wouldn’t we do the same for him?”
Befuddled amusement sheeted off of his frame.  “I’d been on the road a great deal as a kid.  Our dad had some law trouble so Sam and I spent a lot of time in hotel rooms or sleeping in the back of the Impala.  I’d like to get back on the road without a destination in mind.  A box full of tried and true rock music and a blank schedule would be a tempting proposition.”
“Or just maybe the Batcave,” he winked.  When he didn’t get the laugh he was looking for, he finished the unremarkable tour of every other above ground room suffering from harsh overhead lighting: break room, supply closet, secondary bathroom, and finished at the small loading dock.  “I reckon Dean will take you along to drop off the Roadhouse and MacLoed’s orders Friday before noon.  If the master of the Roadhouse is in, she will insist on a shot or two before you go.”
They both watched it sizzle and smoke then inspected the jar for confirmation the quarry had been wrangled successfully.  A long-bodied luminescence bounced in the jar but its wave returned to equilibrium as Cas tied the top on securely.  Upon closer examination it looked like a firm chested dog with two sets of back legs and long full fur wholly made of terrifying light.  “It’s still at rest,” Cas confirmed.  “But now we need another recording device.”
A handful of reports he recognized as the brewmaster’s sat in a pile on top of a binder at the far end of the desk.  With Dean’s enthusiastic permission, he leafed through the binder noting dates and revolving batch names.  His business partner went through the profit and loss reports, urging Castiel to interrogate him on each line.  The accompanying explanation was thorough, addressing his novice understanding of each metric with kind admonishment.  In turn Castiel related how each concept helped or hindered the projects he had experience with.  The remainder of the afternoon dwindled quickly as healthy debate and reciprocal education volleyed between them.  Before they could come to consensus on the ROI of hauling a fraction of the nutrient rich hop byproduct to the farms on property versus selling it, Dean cut the impromptu meeting short.  “I gotta head out.  I’ll see you tomorrow, right?”
The curt noise of a throat clearing pulled his attention behind him.  Sam stood in the doorway and cast an annoyed mien.  “Can I speak with you in the hall, agent?”
A thoroughly rankled Winchester burst through the swinging ‘out’ door, nearly barreling over them both.  Castiel yanked the empty hand truck backwards in attempt to spare Dean’s shins from ramming into the thin metal plate facing out.  At the last moment, Dean tottered off to the side to avoid it barely remaining on his feet as he compensated. “Watch it!”
Without umbrellas they had to make their farewells short under the much needed summer storm just making itself known above.  He counted himself lucky to have a chance to hug her farewell especially since she was much less robotic about it than he.
The pieces clicked into place across Dean’s face.  Practically cranked up to childhood Christmas morning levels of intrigue, Dean propped himself up further onto his elbow, “Alright, how do you test this hunch of yours?” Dean’s forehead scrunched in reaction to the secretive look he gave him.  “Cas?”
“I imagine it keeps people in line,” he introjected, seeing how withdrawn he looked swaddled in such a horrible memory.  “They sound like real peaches.”
The minutes remaining in the day were diminishing almost as quickly as his bottle.  He had to go for broke.  “Let’s just say we get someone who not only believes in the business’s future but wants to help build it.  Theoretically if we found someone like that, wouldn’t that mean making it on time to pick up Claire right after school like the other parents?  Wouldn’t that mean a chance to cook dinner more often instead of grabbing take out?  Wouldn’t you have more time to just
“Wait wait!  I uh, have another guess!”  He scooted forward in his seat, almost knocking knees with the secretive author.
In the months he had been gone he pulled at that string, positive there was no evidence of angels to be found.  Beginning his inquiry was daunting all the same.  Every initial question sounded preposterous.  Are there other angels?  Is unexplainable phenomenon proof of angels, God, or science as of yet undiscovered?  How do you even detect the presence of angels?
“I don’t think anyone has taken that much interest in my ceiling before, and I’ve had the lights rewired twice,” he said with a twinkle in his eye.  The cadence was happy, but suspicion colored his tone.
The lump in his throat stubbornly wouldn’t pass even with a hand lightly gripped below his adam’s apple to help guide its way.  “If only it were that simple,” he nearly whispered.
“Okay, you clearly need some shuteye; because that’s some delusional rambling you just did there.  Get out of here and I’ll see you back here after midnight,” he shooed him away with swatting hands.
“Until last year, I was fortunate enough to release about one a year.  The actual writing process only takes about nine months, but there is a cadence to how often they hit the market.  Due to the often grim subject manner, they often land on shelves in the fall.  The only book my editor referred to as ‘a summer beach read’ was a cross cultural analysis of humanist cults.”
From the far side of the couch, Dean attentively watched Cas put gumbo stained dishes in the sink.  The romantically leaning drama didn’t stand a chance of capturing his attention once Cas wasn’t pressed against his side with his handsomely sculpted nose pointed at the screen.  If the rush of fluffy feelings weren’t saturating his every thought, he would have been disgusted with his infatuated behavior.  “Hey, Cas,” he called out.
, his eyes flicked away from Cas’s a handful of times as if to gather the courage to hear the unwelcome answer.
“Hello, Sam,” he greeted and closed the door behind himself.  “Hello, Dean,” he lowered his head a bit in his direction then let his bag fall at the chair’s feet by Sam’s shiny wingtips.
“Like most cult leaders, he was a conman.  Control, resources, and unchallenged loyalty were his ultimate aims.  Ending my life would have given Reggie evidence of his true motives.  No, he had no choice but to show mercy as an example of his elastic grace as their ever evolving center of their universe.  Conmen never keep their story straight long enough for anyone actually keeping score.  They cleaned me up, sent me on guard duty at the perimeter unattended, and erased any evidence of the interrogation.”
Their jittery fingers intertwined loosely and thumb pads run in familiar patterns against each other’s hands.  “No poofing us there,” Dean warned ever so softly, like you would warn a tiny poofball about the dangers of being eaten right up.  “The point is to take time with each other, not just to get tires.”
“Did you just get out today?” Sam eyed him from head to toe with more than a bit of skepticism.  He was well groomed: recent haircut, new clothes, and new earthy smelling cologne.  The remarkably well stocked kitchen complete with plated baked goods told him the opposite.
The giant hunched over with the square message trotted out of the court, keeping his eyes down towards the cement walkway leading onto the sidewalk on the opposite side of the fence.  If he was the first agent on the case, instead of a second fiddle observation team, he would have kept several paces behind him but traced down where that sheet of paper ultimately landed.
Cas smiled with his chin resting lightly on Dean’s shoulder.  “The youkai batteries discharged when I corrupted the wardings.  Many spiritual energies can be used by angels to turbo charge our Grace.  Its brand of power was compatible enough for me to complete some tasks at the top of my priorities list.”
A blissful baritone hum called out for a momentary ceasefire.  They pulled apart just far enough to let their breaths find an even tempo once again.  Castiel drew along the lines of his strong jaw with an inquisitive finger.  Dean’s pink stained cheeks pooled up over his schooled but toothy grin.  “I never thought you’d want this kind of thing... with me.”
Cold air whipped past him as Cas stood up from the bed and shut off the tape recorder.  His shoulders curved towards the ground.  His dark head of hair crashed back and forth between heavy thoughts.  “A few times over our hunts together, I had been referred to as your ‘attack dog’ or ’bodyguard’ and the like.  Friend or foe alike knew there was a fierce loyalty between us.” He sarcastically snorted, “An Angel and the Righteous Man… People who knew nothing about us saw how I looked at you, how you looked at me.  If they were foolish, they were quick to use it against us.  Soon after they come to understand that nothing but horrendous torment befell whoever dared to pull us from each other.  How was it that what made our bond so strong they saw as a weakness?  The demons or opportunistic humans saw my need to protect and support my friend, my fellow fighter as subservience or blind devotion.  Those humans who know us best on this earth also call us blind when we set our sights to each other.”  His eyes flitted to Dean for a moment over his shoulder and his shoulders straightened.  “Till the end, I will be here, Dean.  Come feast or famine, I was resolved to be whatever you wanted me to be, however you wanted it.  The myriad possibilities were at our fingertips.  That array of choice is slimming by the moment now, for reasons I couldn’t even fathom.”
Feeling the density of their bond thin as he walked towards the door, Dean reached out a hand to pinch his shirt, barring him from leaving like he was one bed time story deficient.  Cas stopped in his tracks more due to the yearning sensation across their link than the tension in his borrowed shirt.
“Who the hell would try to take away a man’s coat in this frigid place?” he asked, knowing he wouldn’t get a discernible answer.  He looked around for the stranger’s clothes so they could make a less conspicuous exit.  A simple wooden wardrobe without doors stood against the wall behind the door with a paper bag resting on the bottom.  The stranger watched as Dean collected it and dumped the contents out on the chair beside the bed.  The same tattered shirt and jeans with holes at the knees fell from the neatly folded bag as if no one had touched it since the clothes had been placed there the week before.  Running has hands through the lump; he found no phone, no wallet, and no other personal effects.  He must not have known his trip to the mailbox would land him in a hospital for the better part of two weeks.  At least they had no odor after sitting for so long, he thanked the universe for tiny miracles.
No shower warmed love opened the door even ten minutes later.  He climbed back onto his feet and headed back to the bathroom.  The steam had cleared out.  None of his clothes were in the hamper.  Fright seeped into his gut once more.  No longer concerned how stealthy he was, he jogged back down the hall to their room.  Empty.  Surely he couldn’t have missed him on the way back.  Other areas of the bunker didn’t seem like likely destinations, but he checked the usual suspects, even startling his brother by tearing his door open.  A wide-eyed mien greeted him, but he just grunted apologetically at him and closed his door once more.  The floor squealed under his shoes as he trotted down the stairs into the cave.  Again flicking the light switch on he found nothing.  To his slight relief there was no evil cheerio either.
He scanned up and down Dean’s form and his shoulders stiffened.  “Aren’t we ironing out the sales plan in the office today?”
The dark brunet agent sat across from him at his own well-manicured desk and interlaced his fingers on his workplace.  “Nothing like being home again,” he mused.  “Just now I scheduled a five hour debriefing for tomorrow morning.  Hopefully I will be back to riding the desk for a few days neck deep in final reports.  You know I love a meticulously detailed summation of casework.”
His gate shortened, slowing his pace to meet Castiel’s.  A horrified look overmastered his handsome features.  “Do you not want me to call you that?  Sorry, ‘Castiel’ is such a mouthful and I wasn’t thinking and…”
His brisk pace towards the door remained unimpeded.  He called back from a distance, “That’s a problem for tomorrow’s Dean.  Gotta pick up dinner for Claire.”
The heavy lidded man stared at him as if analyzing the sound for a secondary meaning.  “Hello, Dean.”
“Just because I don’t want to spend an extra ten minutes a day weeding through your mess of a filing system, doesn’t mean I was jazzed to do it.  Anyway, I want to know what you think about bringing him on as an official employee – like an advisor or something.  We can wait until he has his seed money back with interest before we offer.  I know it’s unconventional, but his generosity with his time and expertise should be compensated.”
“Aw, Cas.  Are you saying getting Baby out of her dungeon was at the tippy tip of your honey-do list?”
When Sam and Dean reached the shady tree-lined spot they camped the night before the ground was still wet from the rainstorm the night before. The outline of their gaudy camper was still visible as a large dry splotch along the secluded dirt cul-du-sac.  There was a downturned tree near them with large burn patterns like the long tendrils of a deeply rooted plant.  They reasoned whatever happened to the tall conifer was after the group had left the area.  Sam was still concerned about the hunters, especially Lana who widened his regiment of yoga positions each morning they stayed with them.  Her lithe form curling and uncurling largely on her orange matt caught Dean’s attention a time or two, but he knew better than to comment on it.  Don and Chet were seasoned hunters as well, and their relationships with her were unclear enough that he didn’t know if stepping on her toes would unleash a intimate or fraternal possessiveness in them.  Much to his horror, it was a mixture Sam solved for when walking in on an unexpected configuration of tangled limbs during a late night common gig.  Sam huffed amused by the memory.
“Sure thing,” he nodded.  “Can’t imagine it’s rodents, though.  No traps have caught one in the time I’ve been here.  Just keep an eye out.”
“You said it.  We’ll keep an eye on it.  I spotted some messes in the warehouses.  When I get in tomorrow, I’ll take care of them.  Sorry you got dragged out here, too.  I’ll see you tomorrow, Benny.”
She rose to leave and gave him an almost paternal nod.  “You just give me the word and I will decimate his credit.  He won’t even be able to rent a bicycle.”
Cas gripped back just as tightly, ever careful not to hurt or injure his hunter with his superhuman enthusiasm even if it were hampered by the spell.  His jackhammering heart slowed in his arms at last.
“Mills told me about these lovely new toys they use to train new agents.”  Ketch grinned sadistically.  “Looked real, didn’t it?”
He figured he afforded himself a break looking at the fort of boxes he had erected thus far.  “It is, but there’s nowhere I’d rather be.  Listen, may I ask you about something, off the record?”
The memory of racing into the earthen pit to lay eyes on Castiel for the first time replayed in slow motion in his mind.  His eyes clung to the bright cerulean blue light behind the angel’s eyes as he shouted.
“Yeah, just to warn you, he’s a hugger.  At the end of his first full shift he caught me by surprise with one of his patented lingering whole being melting hugs.  It took five of six pats on the shoulder to detach him,” he smiled contently at the memory.
The angel turned to face Dean head on, but couldn’t look him in the eyes, his gaze drifting around his torso to a beat Dean couldn’t hear.  “You should know by now what you are to me.”
Despite himself, Sam smirked.  “A whole chapter, I think.  Thankfully he was tastefully vague concerning his intimate moments, but large swaths in between were still pretty gutting.  For your own family to organize your execution just because you’re a mildly rebellious gay guy is just beyond infuriating.  Makes me almost sympathize with the Men of Letters for taking Zachariah out.  Either way, we’ve left him out in the cold for a week already.”
He joined him in a crouch beside the brightly colored book spines that were remarkably anemic compared to their shelf mates.  “Oh, Claire would have my head if we put them out here.  She’s got them lined up in numerical order on the shelf in her bedroom.”
That same focus drew up to his face, still fidgeting with the empty packaging.  The broken stone and pulverized detritus underfoot crunched as he pivoted his weight from one foot to another.  He tossed the packaging into the same coffee can, exposing a small tattoo of a wing on his inner bicep. He caught Dean spying on him and crossed his arms.
“He didn’t know what I was at first.  Since I couldn’t speak and I appeared to be injured at the scene of an accident he brought me to a hospital.  I was there for some time.”
’s later and he tripped into euphoria so bright it threatened to burn him from the inside out.  Cas gripped Dean’s meaty cheeks fully as he drank him down.  If Dean collapsed in the wake of such an orgasm’s draining body high, Cas surely would have caught him once again.
Driving him to the ER his suit jacket was covered in his blood.  He begged him to hang on, pleaded with every deity he could name.  Hanging onto the seat like newly poured wax, Mick gulped in breeze from the open window, but uttered no secrets, corrected none of Ketch’s assertions.  Sam could only entertain the idea of his honesty in the absence of a single retort.  Mick’s only option would have been to admit to every transgression, throw himself at the merciful feet of whoever reviewed his case.  If Ketch’s claims that Mick operated under someone shadowy donor’s purview had merit, there might have never been a salvation to cling to.
Moisture started to gather in the corner of his eyes, but he didn’t blink them away or usher his emotions down a dark corridor, he reveled in their connection, folding the whole world away outside their small corner.
“You wouldn’t mind sharing a meal with me here in my mad scientist hideout?”  He rubbed at a nervous twitch at the side of his neck.
Castiel endeavored to silence the flickering panic from snapping up his knees.  “Well, if you’re still interested in making that mean steak for us, I’ll have a chance, won’t I?”
Sheepishly, the agent nodded and went into a small explanation of a personal matter Dean faintly ignored.  They parted ways with the younger agent none the wiser as to how unprofessional a visit that had become or the nature of the entity under his care.
The men sat on a cement park bench just outside of the prairie’s perimeter where the agent took closer stock of the man’s condition. There was no dirt on him other than his bare feet and he was dressed for summer even though the Virginia October breeze sent a chill down his spine.  It looked like he had just stepped out to get the mail, forgoing a fall coat or shoes he would have needed on a trip past the lawn.  There were no scrapes or bruises, so the pain he clutched at must have been isolated in his abdomen. Otherwise, he looked healthy.  His furled brow did little to hide his handsome features from the agent’s notice.  His shirt was mostly unbuttoned, so the agent helped buttoned it up to conserve warmth and tossed his coat over his lightly shivering shoulders.  “Don’t move,” he commanded as he stood up and paced a few feet away, feeling the deep, moody eyes boring into the back of his head.  His fingers played quickly over the face of his phone to tap in a relief agent, hoping he could call this whole thing in without having to go back into the office for the third time that day.  The rings subsided into an operator’s practiced prompting.  “This is Agent Winchester, badge number CT091808. Please put me through to Assistant Director Pileggi.  Thank you,” he sighed and swerved his head around to check on the man now nearly doubled over on the park bench. Dull rings echoed through the speaker until a stern, rich voice called out to acknowledge him on the other end. “I thought you were done for the day.”
“Work’s never done as you know, sir.  An unknown object fell from the sky over the highway and landed a block over from Lovette Park in a field.  I chased it down and found a civilian where I expected to find wreckage…”
The open floor plan kitchen left them open to discovery, but Dean hoped their efforts to remain silent would give them the upper hand.  No one was in the kitchen so they moved forward to the living room with their guns drawn.  Clearing each room with a hand gesture they swept up to the last room on the left.  After years of infiltrations and breach and clear ops, Dean was prepared to walk into almost anything.  As he side-stepped into the living room, Davies eyes barely flickered up as he came into view.  Exhaustion and radiated terror filled the far side of the living room where he sat handcuffed to the arms of a chair holding something between his shaking knees.  The other familiar mop swayed in the chair opposite Davies closest to them on the left as they entered.  They both pointed their guns at his head, but Davies gave them a purposeful grimace to dissuade them.  Unfortunately it also drew unwanted attention.  As they stepped into full view, Ketch huffed assuredly, swirling a metal ring around his pointer finger.
Sam tugged at his bottom lip then lit up.  “Remember when we met Cas on top of the bunker to let the raijyuu out for Raijin to reclaim?  Cas said he got a charge from the containers they were in.  Maybe that compromised his power somehow.”
A handful of his books were strewn across the corners of the couch with a small notebook wedged between the pages of a mystery novel he recognized.  Flicking the touchpad on the computer brought up a dictionary website.  Just how fast was Cas learning to read?  All signs pointed to Charlie posing more of the threat than he initially thought.  He opened the bookmarked page to find the spiral notepad holding his place had scribbled definitions next to a language he couldn’t decipher, but this one was less angular and pointed than the words he scribbled on his notepad before.  Just how many languages did he know?  Even his attempts at writing in his new tongue scrawled across several pages were very legible.  Dean sat down trying to imagine the deep tones of his voice forming consonants and vowels in a configuration he could understand.  The possibility made him anxious, excited, but a tad possessive that at that point only he could communicate with him in any expression post-mime.
“Wouldn’t leaving without saying goodbye be rude?” he asked, following him past Sam’s brown vehicle to the driver’s side door of his own.  The warmth between their palms had already evaporated into the cooling night air.
“Eh,” he considered.  “Belarus!  Safe enough being it’s an ex-soviet state, but no one wants to sneak into Russia adjacent countries.  Plus there’s the possibility you could come back unharmed later.  Let’s say we need more info from them at a later date – say another cell misbehaves.”
With his pointer finger he traced his length from root to tip then around the thick width.  “A little,” he whispered ever so quietly.
“We know someone with a direct connection to the Malkuth and to Zachariah,” he added finally looking up at Sam.
I had a healthy argument with a couple of people about how long a reasonably athletic male presenting person could keep something between his knees without letting go.  No one would really answer my question, only citing that keeping one’s knees together was harder for men due to anatomical considerations and the need to “spread”.  This amused me greatly, but I couldn’t get a straight answer so I had to go off of what I could do and augment the duration of the conversation from there.  While it was a red herring at the end of the day, it got the boys’ attention and that’s all that matters.
Dean relinquished his hold, regarding his urge to explore with fondness.  “Have at it.  A writer can’t help but get lost in a library, I suppose.”
A winded inhaled shook him at the admission.  His fingers curled around Cas’s and he found the strength to open his eyes.  There his face hovered inches away gazing into his eyes with a tender, patient smile, waiting for permission.  Ardent affections wafted from the angels adoring smile almost throwing Dean backwards to bask in its power more clearly.  Dean wanted to believe with the truth finally out, they would sync right back up, lift their hearts from the dusky swamp back into the cloudless joy they once resided in.  Of course reality was too hard to wrestle, too battle hardened to concede at so forthright a confession.  This is what Sam was warning him about.  How long had he known?
“There are always monsters out there to catch and kill.  After being stuck in the bunker for longer than usual during the raijyuu incident, we were all dealing with a bit of cabin fever.  Now, I understand it must have been different for you after Cas and I… you know.  You wanted to get out of town but hunting alone is hardly ever the best choice.  You had me or Cas or both around and well we had you around.”
Dean let out a moan around his cock as Cas continued to slowly thrust upward. Dean moved his knees up beneath him, and placed his hands beside Cas' hips, loosening his jaw he looked up at Cas who's blue eyes seemed to be glowing with desire. He nodded lightly and Cas bucked his hips up into Dean, forcing his cock deep into his mouth, hitting the back of his throat so hard that Dean almost gagged and tears stung his eyes, but he didn't stop him, and Cas continued to frantically fuck his mouth.
When they broke the kiss again panting, they looked at each other with lidded eyes and smiled. "Merry Christmas Cas." Dean said softly, nuzzling into his neck. "thank you Dean, this is the best Christmas ever" Castiel replied running his fingers into his hair, he had never been happier about saying yes to going to church in his life.
Castiel simply nodded his head, not trusting his voice. They got out of the car, Dean walking around to get Darla out. When she refused to wake up, Dean simply carried her, tossing Castiel the keys asking him to unlock the door for him.
Cas' fingers grasp at the sheets on the bed, back arching again as he moans Deans name. "More... ngh... Dean.. please... more" Dean smiles looking up at Cas as his mouth trails farther down his body and Cas' breath catches in his throat as Dean wraps his long fingers around his throbbing cock.
"Right, thats what I want for Darla.I asked her if she wanted to go and she did. There's been a couple times when she didn't feel like it and we didn't and if it ever gets to the point where she doesn't want to anymore, we won't. But for now she likes it."
"Alright then, why don't you come on over and sit on the bed, I'll grab my ipod" Dean chuckled as Cas tilted his head in that adorable way he always did when he didnt understand something. He explained as best he could so Cas would understand what it was, as he walked over to his dresser and grabbed it and the ear buds that he hated. But it would be very difficult for both of them to ear one set of headphones. He made a mental note to pick up a docking station.
Dean moans Cas' name as his hips hitch into his touch, needing more. He runs his hand up into Cas' hair pulling slightly "bedroom?" he asks as Cas looks up at him, his blue eyes almost black with lust. Cas smiles devilishly, kissing him. They make their way down the hall, losing pieces of clothing as they do.
"get ready to hear more, because FUCK Dean, you feel amazing.... Now move!" Cas says, his voice rough and his eyes wild. He digs his fingers into Dean's hips as he starts moving again. The room quickly fills with the sound of their moans and the rough harsh sound of  Dean's hard cock slapping Cas' stomach as he bounces on top of him.
Castiel found himself looking forward to spending Sunday afternoons with little Dean Winchester, he was a good kid. And even though pie wasn't his favorite dessert to make, he found he didnt mind so much because it made Dean happy.
Cas was only too happy to oblige, he snapped his hips into Dean harder, pulling almost completely out and then thrust back in to his balls.... over and over... harder and harder, until he too felt the warm pooling.... He reached between them and grabbed Dean's cock, pumping hard, his hand matching his thrusts.
Dean smiled, running his tongue over Castiel's nipples and then down his body. He gently kissed the tip of his cock, which twitched eagerly at the contact. Dean growled hungrily before grabbing the base of it with his free hand and taking the head into his mouth. When a whole new sound of desperation escaped Castiel's lips, Dean took him into his mouth fully, and a little too eagerly, his eyes watered as he choked around Castiel's cock. "Damn Cas, you make that look so easy"
Dean chuckled, letting out a sigh of relief. "Yea Cas, we can listen to it again. Or we can listen to something else, Led Zeppelin is my favorite band, I have all of their songs, we can listen to more than just one of them."
Castiel sighed, leaning back into him, tilting his head back, allowing Dean access to place soft kisses on his neck. "Dean, if you keep this up, there won't be any breakfast, and Darla is in the other room." He allowed Dean once more nibble at his neck before shrugging out of his embrace and turning to face him.
Cas closes the distance between them wrapping his arm around Dean's waist pulling him into him. He presses their lips together as Dean wraps his arms around him. He feels Dean's tongue lick over his lips and he parts them, letting Dean slide into his mouth. His tongue meets Dean's gently at first as he feels his body come alive. He lets out a low moan pulling Dean closer, their cocks rubbing against each other.
Dean snaps his head and looks at Cas, "Are you telling me that you've been living in the back room of a gas station!?" Dean pulls to the side of the road when Cas doesn't answer right away. He throws the car in park and turns to face him. "Cas? Answer me... are you?"
Castiel pouted a little "Can I still kiss you?" he leaned in, not waiting for an answer, and slid his tongue into Dean's mouth, his hands running across his chest to his neck, pulling him in deeper until they were both left breathless. "I don't think I can go 53 days without kissing you again. Not now that I know how you taste." He flicked his tongue across Dean's lips to add emphasis. "Please tell me I can at least kiss you"
"Sure thing sweetie! But first why don't you go and make sure Maddie has food in her dish" Dean bent down and gave his daughter a hug, then let her go off into the dining room to do her chore. He stood and walked over to where Castiel was now sitting on the couch, blanket still draped over him.
"Even without my grace I can feel you Dean. I feel your longing, and I wanted to comfort you. I didn't know that this was what you were longing for though. I could have never dreamed this." he smiles softly.
Jimmy pulled off Dean's cock with a loud pop and stood before them, watching as they kissed and Castiel tweeked his nipples. He made quick work of stripping his clothes, and soon was standing over Dean, one leg on either side of the man's body. He bent over and joined the two in their wet sloppy kiss. "Dean, I want you to eat my ass and get me nice and ready for you while Castiel sucks my cock. How does that sound?" Dean's eyes went wide and all he could do was nod his head. He shifted to the side as Jimmy went to his knees, straddling Castiel's face, his brother making quick work of taking his cock into him. Dean then straddled Castiel's body as he shoved his face into Jimmy's ass, pulling his cheeks apart and licking his puckered hole, forcing a loud moan to escape Jimmy's lips. Dean lapped at Jimmy's hole until he felt it start to quiver , then slowly pushed his tongue in, opening him up. "Fuck! Oh god Dean!" Jimmy cried out.
He shook his head, pushing away the memory of those first few nights after he left the bunker. He stripped his cloths off and walked to the shower, turning it on as hot as he could stand it. This was something that he did enjoy about being human, showers. He loved the way the water felt running over his body, how his muscles would relax under the pulsing warmth. He grabbed the wash cloth and soap, and began washing his body. As he ran the washcloth over his skin he started to think of Dean in the shower, only minutes ago, doing the same thing.
When Castiel walked out into the living room Dean was sitting on the floor watching Darla unwrap the last of her gifts. Castiel just stood there and watched the two of them together, perfectly content in the happiness he felt. Darla unwrapped her last gift, a barbie doll, she jumped up and ran over to Castiel "Look Castiel! look what my daddy got me! Isn't she beautiful?"
Dean came hard with a scream, white cum spurting from his cock coating both of their stomachs and chests. Muscles spasmed around his cock and Castiel soon joined him in orgasm, still thrusting as deep into Dean as he could get. Castiel let out a mangled cry and collapsed on top of Dean as they both tried to steady their breath.
"I find your room more comfortable than mine. I thought since you weren't here, I would just sleep here. But now that your back, I can go back to my room, so you can get some sleep." Cas stood up. "I'm sure you're tired"
When the kiss broke, they both stood there, panting heavily, pink flushing their cheeks. "Damn, Cas, where the hell did you learn to kiss like that?"
"that was me projecting my pleasure onto you. I want to make you feel, the way you make me feel." Castiel leaned into him, bringing his mouth to his "can I make you feel good Dean?"
Cas nods his head and Dean 'tsk's his tongue. "Uh uh, I want to hear you" Deans teeth sink into his ear lobe, "do you understand?" he asks again.
Cas stares at Dean unsure what to do, he isn't leaving and the way he's looking at him, Cas swears if he doesn't stop, he's going to cum in his pants. He takes a breath, "Dean can you ... Um..."
Dean always found it funny how she came bustling in with such purpose, but she wouldn't know what to do with the place if it weren't for him. "No customers today, but I sold that old bed set that we've been sitting on for five months, they'll be by today to pick it up." He tells her as she went through the papers on her desk.
The blue eyed man smiled, "I get off in a half hour. Think you can put up with the old creep until then? I promise I can show you a better time than he will." He ran his tongue over the shell of Dean's ear sending a shutter through his body. Dean bit his lip and nodded his head. "good, watch for me by the kitchen door, I'll give you a wave when I'm leaving and you can meet me out back." He pressed his lips against Dean's neck biting gently, "I'm gonna make you feel so good." he said grinding his hips against Dean's. He nipped at his lip before opening the door to go back inside. "Name's Castiel by the way" he said over his shoulder before disappearing behind another door inside. Dean stood shocked, and excited... and he didn't care that Sammy was going to get suspended, he wasn't letting this blue eyed angel get away.

“Interesting…” it mumbles, and Cas immediately takes a threatening step forward, a protective anger flashing across his features.
He knows Sam is calling him. The phone keeps ringing, over and over and over again. But he can’t answer it. He can’t talk to him. Not now. Not after all of that.

Makes me wonder if I’ll really, truly ever be able to go back to sleep.” Cas watches closely as it talks, prepared to do whatever he has to to protect those he loves. “And, after this little...charade of yours, Dean...well, let’s just say he isn’t doing so hot, far as I can tell. And if he’s not doin’ so hot, then he can’t exactly take on God now, can he?” It stops twirling, then, turning to stare at him. “He needs you.”
