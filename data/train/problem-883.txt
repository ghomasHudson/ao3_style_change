"Leave the socks on."  He waited for me to continue, only gradually realising I meant exactly that.  I gave him one of the two small bags I was carrying.  "If it makes you feel any better, I bought this for you today."
"For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery.  You would have wished to tell me something, or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run.  I brought Cartwright down with me and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar.  What does man want more? "
Holmes hissed audibly through his teeth, but made no other movement.  I would have liked to have seen his face, but he had expressly asked for the view of my back, so I remained as I was.  I did not hear him step forward, but suddenly his hands were on me.
I would have thought it could not get any worse.  But my mind was still in the grip of the drug, and despite the lack of logic I could only accept that my clothes had gone in the course of Holmes's transformation.  My arms were bare where the tentacles twined around them, and more began to entangle my legs while one slid around my back and blocked my attempts to retreat.  The monster that was Holmes pulled me forwards even as I had tried to pull him towards me before.
"It is not quite that simple, Holmes.  You were, shall we say, rather intimidating, but if it had been only that I could have accepted it as another of your odd moments of whimsy."  I forced a short laugh.  "Or to put it in the best possible light, I could take it as flattery that I managed to provoke such behaviour on your part.
But he was not finished.  "It hurt, but not with that sick feeling.  And it is one thing to ignore the clamouring demands of the body, but it is different when the body is not clamouring at all."  Indeed, he seemed more relaxed than he had been for some time, his habitual restlessness stilled.  "I feel like," and he glanced sideways at me, as if to judge my reaction, "I feel like going to sleep."
"Not at all, I mean it exactly as it sounds.  I wish to make a couple of suggestions about your attire; you always dress exactly the same way."
There was no resisting that tone; I moved as he directed.  Holmes looked at me for a long moment before continuing.
"Now you are thinking that I am going to take you, tonight, but I am merely looking, and anticipating.  Indeed, I will not even touch you."  Holmes paused for a moment.  "Not with my hands, that is."  And he placed the leather loop of the crop on that small plain square of skin known as the perineum.  With a delicate touch he began to massage the oil into my skin, dragging the loop back and forth over my sac, occasionally reaching as far as the very base of my member, but more often just falling short.
He started slowly, but as far as I was concerned I had paid my forfeit, and I had never promised that he would have things his way for the entire evening.  I braced myself on my good arm, and reached back between my legs to find his sac, caressing it and squeezing it gently in my palm.  He sped up immediately.
I also wondered why he had done it; had it been only for me, had he received pleasure for himself from his actions, or was there some other reason I could not imagine?
I stopped in the middle of the room, standing on the small carpet that occupied most of the open floor space.  Holmes dropped himself gracefully into the chair, seemingly relaxed until I looked at his eyes.  One word: "Strip."
I had just decided to close my book and go up to bed when I heard voices below in the hall.  The sound was loud and cheerful, the rapid voices of excited men, interrupting each other in their eagerness to speak.  Holmes and Lestrade, I deduced, and in a high good humour to boot.
I was breakfasting on my own again that particular morning.  One could never complain of routine when sharing lodgings with Holmes; he might be up before me, after me, or be totally absent.  On the occasions he did arrive during my morning, he was equally likely to enter from his bedroom or from the street.  I doubt I would have raised an eyebrow had he decided to climb in through the window.
"Give me fifteen minutes, by the clock.  And you might as well have something to eat while you're listening."  I placed a couple of slices of toast on the empty plate on his side of the table, and pushed across the covered dish containing the scrambled eggs.  I did not look at him; I simply behaved as if he had already accepted my offer. "Tea?  You don't have to natter if you'd rather not."
London.  What I want, and what is so hard to find, is an attractive, intelligent man of firm character who is willing to do utterly as I say, in private."  He laughed, short and bitter.  "And one I can trust absolutely.  It is not a common combination."
He was still struggling to find an appropriate answer when I shut the door.  I went up to my bed, smiling.
There were basically four rooms, two in front for use as dining-room and sitting-room, and two bedrooms set behind.  All of the domestic functions were provided from the main house.  The only oddity was that the table in the dining room was covered with a heavy woollen blanket, and all of the chairs stood back against the walls.
I sank gratefully into the hot water, submerging as far as possible.  The heat soaked deep into my bones from all sides, as nothing else could.  I tried not to think, especially about problems; the patients I suspected I would lose this winter, the state of my finances, the persistent ache from my wound.  I let them all drift away.
"So since I found out what you wanted, my mind refuses to deny you.  Do you know that I left a whorehouse tonight without finding any of them to my liking?  I compared them all to you, and they all fell short.  They were all too short, or too thick in the body.  Their movements were awkward or gauche, their makeup garish, their conversation empty.  And in their eyes I could see that they cared not whether I chose them or any other man did."
"I refuse to believe that my forfeit consists of accompanying you to the opera.  Come on, Watson, give!"
The first read only: "Yes, to both objects.  I have trustworthy reports. M."  The second was not much longer:  "Reported 21st May at 0916, just offshore Sheerness, heading north and west." and was from the Department of the Admiralty.
He was all affability, at least to the Inspector.  He played down his own role, bringing Lestrade's contributions to my attention.  When I spoke, he got up and wandered about the room, poked up the fire, or interrupted me to ask Lestrade if he wanted more tea or another biscuit.
yes" I moaned, my hips pushing up quite without my control.  Holmes moved faster, his hand still playing in that most sensitive area, and when he squeezed his interior muscles I screamed and thrust into him as far as my bonds would allow.  He moved in perfect rhythm with me, squeezing and meeting my thrusts, until I came so hard I felt I would tear apart, and I nearly fainted.
"Indeed."  was all he said, but if I was reading his eyes correctly, I was in for some serious trouble the next time it was me who lost one of our wagers.  "Would you mind closing your eyes for, say, a count of thirty?"
He was holding himself tightly, arms locked around his body, looking only at the ground.  I was aware, as I usually was not, that he was years younger than me, and in his misery he looked younger still.
I was alarmed at being left like this, naked and exposed in the centre of the room.  Holmes had never left me before; I saw now that I had been unconsciously depending upon him to cover for me somehow if we were discovered.  I tried to compose myself, and in truth it must have been only a few minutes before he returned.
I am glad the performers were not dependent on us alone to make up their audience.  Few people would have noticed Holmes' distraction, expressed as it was in tiny shifts of his weight or the occasional grimace, but to my perceptions he might as well have been shouting.  I was not much better off, since my awareness that his thoughts were constantly heading in carnal directions caused me to respond in kind.
I reached down, intending only to straighten myself up and continue with my walk, but my hand lingered.  I would not normally consider indulging myself out of doors, but it seemed a shame to waste the combination of such a delightful mental image and all too physical readiness.  As to privacy, I was probably more alone tucked into this corner of the moor than inside my bedroom at Baskerville Hall.
I do not know if the cephalopod body could experience climax, but I could hardly fail to be aware of Watson's completion, as he shouted aloud and spent himself over both of us.  Even without a climax myself, I felt only pleasure in his obvious enjoyment of my efforts.  The voice in my head was silent.
There are many possibilities, but I knew much of his pleasure tonight was because of his current triumph over me.  So I chose the most submissive position of them all, kneeling down on all fours on the rug in front of the fire.
"You must have some idea of my tastes.  I do not trade favours.  If I take you, I will take you as I want, and possess you utterly.  I may permit you to make requests, but I do not guarantee to fulfil them.  And one more thing:  you may end it whenever you wish, but while we continue, you lie with nobody else.  I do not share."
"Holmes, really.  These telegrams prove nothing, without knowledge of the questions you asked.  You will need to do better than this."
My member was rigid and aching by now, all the worse because as he moved he kept almost touching it, but without ever actually doing so.  Finally he did touch me there, a small lick at the very tip.  "Now, Watson, you don't want to drip in your dessert, do you?"
“If I am going to be accused of sensationalism, I may as well have committed it.”  I remarked, as innocently as possible, then plucked the sheet from Holmes’s fingers and read it aloud.
"Holmes!  Your brother has come to visit.  There must be something very seriously amiss to move him out of his usual routine and into our premises."
Watson began to move again, finally attaining his feet and reaching for me.  I understood his intention; he saw something in me that had convinced him I was in danger, and he was going to pull me from the cottage into the open air.  With a strange voice in my head I had to agree with him that the drug was actively affecting me, and I reached out to take his hands.
"Remove all of your clothes, then lie down on the table, on your back.  And no dawdling to use up time, I want fair payment from you."
And then Watson's clothes were gone, and with them went most of my composure.  I could not help but move closer to him, my new appendages responding as easily and unconsciously as my normal limbs had done before.  But these were boneless, and long; I found myself twining them around Watson's arms and legs, behind his back and under his head, supporting him in my embrace.
I knew that Holmes was not finished shaping me to his desires.  If he had asked simply for physical gratification I would already have agreed.  Perhaps it was the very readiness of my acquiescence that made it insufficient for him.  He desired my body; I had no doubt of that.  But he had greater needs.  He wanted my unmistakable, and complete, submission.
I knew him too well to contest it.  If he - and Mycroft - were certain, then that was how things were.  And now I had to ask.  "Well?  What do you name?"
"I will tell you if I do."  His voice was cooler than before, but I was starting to see the patterns in his responses to my actions.  I leant my head back against his shoulder and began to manipulate myself, the feeling just as sweet and spicy as I had been missing, those nights alone in my room.  But Holmes was not done exploring my limits.
"No, please... Please do that again." His voice shook, as if the act of asking for something took a tremendous effort.
I recall the night things changed.  Mrs. Hudson had cleared the dishes and bid us goodnight, and I was trying to decide if it was worth going out for a walk to occupy part of the evening.  I was staring out through the windows, so Holmes was behind me when he spoke.
He strode towards his bedroom door, but as he passed the hatstand he leant over and pulled his hunting crop from it.  I hesitated for a second, and he must have heard the hitch in my stride, since he turned to address me.
He'd like that.  If I took him now, as much as we would both enjoy it, then I would have won the wager but lost this stage in the subtle back-and-forth competition in our sensual lives.  Neither of us wanted a total victory, but neither would we simply let the other have his way too easily.  Two minutes ago I had been in control; now had to prove I could keep it.
Although fully spent, Sherlock couldn’t help but shiver and mewl as he felt his insides being filled.
On the other hand, he could maybe find valuable information. Maybe John’s blog would spark an interest in young children, a new bread of possible comrades. Highly unlikely, but John had taught Sherlock first hand to not lose hope in humans.
“I don’t want you to leave me here alone. You want your cum extracted from me. Logically, it would be best if you take me to the bath and wash your cum out of me.” Sherlock grinned. “You know, using the shower head, maybe even your finger, scraping it all out of me?”
Trying to maintain his fierce pace, John went down to devour Sherlock’s lips. Feeling the younger one’s nails digging into his back, he growled.
Sherlock’s eyes. Although slightly red from tears, as always too beautiful for John. He could forever look into them.
With military trained swiftness, John threw the product to the floor and grabbed onto a pillow to cover himself.
With the swiftness of a soldier and the precision of a doctor, John’s large thick cock penetrated Sherlock in one strong motion
There's still a bag full of sex toys on Johns bed. (Or at this point, probably on the floor) Pity to have a nice vibrators and other toys go unused, right?
Their shower session mostly consisted of of their lips crashing, John’s fingers in Sherlock, and Sherlock’s fingers around John’s cock.
“Yeah.” John sighed. “And, we need to do something about it. As a doctor, I know that it isn’t at all healthy to keep
This also meant that a case, any case, would be more interesting to John. It would be even more interesting now that it was basically off limits to him. His head would constantly thinking about the case, he would fail to seduce the women. Or maybe he would purposefully fail to get back home early, see if his flatmate had finished the case and explain to him what had happened.
Quickly turning off the stairway lights, he held onto the door knob. Adding a slight pressure upwards, he was able to turn the knob without causing a click.
He felt the taller man settling himself on his lap. They simultaneously moaned into the kiss as Sherlock rutted his clothed cock against his lube slick cock. John took this as an opportunity to slide his tongue into the other man. As John lifted his hand up to run his fingers into the detective’s hair, Sherlock pulled away.
He hated his overactive brain. When he noticed John’s slight change in posture, he saw what the older man was trying to conceal between his legs.
Maybe have an epilogue chapter of them using things? Or, just a whole new fic of that? What are your folks thoughts?
John straightened his back, and stood on his knees, lightly grasped his own cock and lightly stroked. Thumbing his slit, precum dripped down. John let out a sigh.
Comfortable silence that they were so used to. All they could hear was their own breathes, still panting, but slowly slowing down.
“Sherlock.” In his serious tone, there was tenderness within. He put his lips against the taller man’s ears.
Bending his knees, feet on the mattress, he opened himself. With his soft spit slick fingers, he drew circles around his opening. He felt himself buck a bit forward.
“I initially was going to accept payment when I took the silly case, as you always pester me about doing. But, well-”
“JOHN!!!” Sherlock screamed. The loudest sound that John has ever heard the detective make. Back arching, head slammed against the pillow, eyes rolling back.
But before any of that, next chapter will be the (I think) beautiful ending that you have all been waiting for!!
John had never mentioned about this woman he is seeing that night at all, he had only announced the date this morning. Someone he just met and exchanged numbers a few days ago. Most likely at the cafe across the street from the clinic. This means that John didn’t have much care about the who. He was more interested in the sex.
the violin.” Sherlock felt John’s how breath against his neck. “And, of course, you barging in on my while wanking.”
It was only to check if there were any immediate threats to John, to himself. He’s heard enough about internet stalkers turning up in real life.
A generic Tenga really just looks like a red water bottle.  I know this too well because, as discreet as Japan is about sex, adult products stores all have huge signs that say "TENGA SHOP!" in the windows.
John’s mouth went dry. Although, yes, Sherlock was wearing trousers, he wasn’t wearing anything under his dressing gown. The same dressing gown that was part of too many of John’s fantasies over the years. Thoughts of pounding into him with while the detective was only wearing that silky garment. Or, thoughts of ripping that bloody dressing gown off of him.
“Well, it seems that the internet cannot come to a consensus on who is the so-called top, you or me.”
He didn’t need a shower anyways. He was taken a shower before leaving for his date, cleaned himself thoroughly in anticipation.
Hurriedly, he undid his belt and slid down his trousers, sighing a bit as he felt less restriction. Unbuttoning the first three buttons of his shirt, he also quickly took his socks off. Taking a big breath, he opened the bag he had initially set on his bed.
“Or else, what?” Getting between Sherlock’s widely open thighs, John leisurely stroke his inner thighs.
Sherlock moaned out. Eyes wide open, mouth sucking in as much air as possible, drool sliding down this perfect lips.
“Oh, don’t worry. No silly product will ever replace you.” John gave him a lopsided grin. “It’s just, some nights, when you’re spending hours and hours in your mind palace, I won’t want to bother you.”
Scrolling down the search engine page, it was just for research. See what the world thought of John, and himself, of course. Of course, all very important.
So, yeah. Seeing things like this everyday on the way to work, makes you think about putting it into smutty fanfics. \_(ツ)_/
However, after almost finishing his 2nd glass of wine, he finally noticed. Her shoulder length hair was dark and curly hair. Her long slender fingers. Blue eyes.
Edit: I really don't have anything much to write here, so, uh. Enjoy this chapter? It's gonna start getting smuttier and smuttier from here. (´・ω・`)ﾉ
Not waiting for an answer, John held onto Sherlock’s thin hips and started to pound into him without mercy.
Clean, breathing somewhat normally, they tucked themselves into Sherlock’s bed, and Sherlock welcomed being held tightly in John’s arms from behind. This was more than Sherlock had imagined the night would lead to. Everything he had ever wanted. Where he had always wished John would belong.
No, it didn’t matter that Sherlock was in an adult store less than a few hours earlier (of course that knowledge did help), it was just listening to Sherlock’s voice. Listening to explain about the case.
One of the important things I like about Sherlock and John’s relationship (romantic or platonic), is how John knows when to put his foot down but also knows when to give up.
“John.” The last drop of calmness that Sherlock still had was poured into the name. John almost chuckled as a pair of long legs tried to wrap his body.
For once in his lifetime, he was thankful for his sexual frustration for the other man. Thanks to masturbating only a few hours earlier, his body easily accepted his finger.
“Oh, god, Sherlock, oh - “ John’s mumbling words dissolve into a choked cry as he comes between their nearly conjoined skin, the white hot electricity that races up his spine licking shiveringly through his nerve endings as he buries his face in Sherlock’s sweaty neck and tries not to pass out. His head is spinning.
John shudders above him and lays back down flat on his belly over the counter, his arse pushing back against Sherlock's hungry tongue. "Yeah, yeah, put your tongue in me. Fucking hell, you are fantastic, you - "
John takes Sherlock's hand and pulls him to standing, then down the short hallway to their bedroom. The late afternoon light is hazy, but bright. John leaves Sherlock standing by the side of the bed and goes to pull the curtains shut. He sets the mirror up against them so they don't drift open and wake Sherlock before night falls.
“No it isn’t. I’m so sorry, love, I didn’t mean to hurt you. I would never. I would never want to hurt you. Just got a bit - carried away. M’sorry.” John sounds ashamed and looks miserable, and it’s Sherlock’s fault. Again.
John chews on his bottom lip, clearly fighting with himself. Sherlock watches him as he’s hesitating, letting his gaze wander over John’s tight, perfect body, every angle and curve covered in glitter. He’s wearing absolutely miniscule gold shorts, with no pants underneath - the outline of his cock is evident, larger than average and definitely interested. His hips are devastating - the gentle hill of his pelvic bone disappearing beneath the shimmery waistband just begging for Sherlock’s hands to follow it where it leads. His thigh muscles are exquisite, cut and rock hard, his knees knobbly and scarred. He played rugby at some point. The image of John wrestling in a muddy scrum, cleats scrabbling in the turf, grunting and straining, is almost too much for Sherlock to handle.
you’re my best friend. You silly sod.” John puts his hands on Sherlock’s biceps, flips them over so Sherlock’s flat on his back, and crawls on top of him, straddles his hips. Neither of them is hard - he doesn’t care. There’s something heartbreakingly intimate and trusting about their soft cocks pressed together. He finally pulls his open shirt off, throws it across the bedroom, and they’re completely bared to each other.
Now Sherlock sighs, his eyelids twitching. “John?” He mumbles, twisting closer against John’s body, still mostly asleep.
Sherlock held his cut arm in front of John’s face. It was no longer bleeding, but Sherlock pressed it against John’s open mouth, “Suck.”
John cringed. He didn’t deserve that kind of respect. From anyone. “Just, John. Alright? No sir, none of that shit.”
"Pack that kilt." Sherlock could feel the heat rising on his cheeks, remembering the vision of John on top of him, the kilt brushing against his stomach.
Before Sherlock can do anything at all in response except grab helplessly at John’s hips, John rolls off him, unceremoniously yanks both his jeans and his pants off and slithers across the bed on his stomach. He looks expectantly over his shoulder at Sherlock, his eyes huge and round and seething with emotion.
. With you I would. I do, with you, I do." Sherlock puts his mouth over John's again, his hands coming up to splay wide across John's shoulder blades and press their chests together as the kiss deepens.
John got dressed while Sherlock was in the kitchen, tossed his rumpled wet clothes into the hallway, and settled down in his chair. The springs dug into his thighs as a cloud of dust rose round him, and settled calm and right in his lungs, seeped through his pores and into his bloodstream. This godawful, uncomfortable, cheap armchair which should have been put in a jumble sale for ten quid twenty years ago. This
John knows somewhere in the more complex parts of his brain that he's said that exact phrase to Sherlock hundreds of times, that this isn't how it goes, that it's him who gives the orders and Sherlock who takes them, but his hindbrain has completely taken over and all he can do in reply is let his head fall back silently against Sherlock's shoulder and nuzzle at the side of his face. He remembers he's not supposed to make a sound, so he doesn't, just flicks his tongue at Sherlock's cool cheek and tries to breathe through the sublime electric tension that contracts his lungs every time Sherlock moves inside him.
Jim is calmly sipping his wine when Sherlock reenters the sitting room. His eyes drift to Sherlock's and lock into them. "Making phone calls in the loo?"
John’s so lost in his own thoughts that when Sherlock suddenly pushes his hips up and tightens and whispers “Oh,
John squirms and pushes his hips against Sherlock's, their cocks sliding at each other through their pants. John shudders, feeling like there's too much blood in his veins and not enough air in his lungs, and says hoarse and strained, "Like this?"
John huffed and clutched at Sherlock’s hip, pushed his arse back into Sherlock’s now fully erect prick. “Christ, are you still thinking about travel plans?”
Sherlock rubbed his hand over his face as the train rumbled to a stop. He yanked the doors open and jumped out into a brisk foggy morning, the clouds laying low and orange across the horizon. He turned so he was facing due west, the sun casting his shadow stretched long and black in front of him.
Sherlock whimpers at the first pull of his skin between John’s teeth, the sweet pleasure-pain of blood vessels breaking. “I want you to push my limits, see how much I can take. I want you to -
They stay there until the sky goes black, the smells of dinners cooking rising up around them, listening to the neighbours taking out their rubbish. Harry does most of the talking, about a concert she saw last week, and roommates at uni who drink all her soy milk and have loud sex on the sofa and drive her crazy, and about how she’s failing chemistry. She makes them laugh, she makes
whoever had done this to John. He would kill them. Lester couldn’t give Sherlock more than a physical description of the pair. Didn’t know names or associations. Mycroft would, though, or he’d find out. Sherlock had contacted him last night, was waiting to hear back.
When their lips meet this time, it’s softer, but no less bruising. It reaches down inside Sherlock and
“Actually,” Sherlock began, all too aware of John’s fist clenching tightly beside him, and trying to redirect this conversation into something
in his ear at night before they fell asleep, pulled him down into his lap on the sofa in the evenings and stroked his hair until he was loose limbed and sleepy, then took him to bed and they made love slow and sweet, Sherlock pressing gentle kisses along John’s spine and whispering how much he loved him, that he would always take care of him.
"I know, sweetheart." John abruptly sat up, and Sherlock swung his head around to see what he was doing. John untied the sock around his ankle and tossed the bag of ravioli towards the kitchen. He slithered off the sofa and snuggled up next to Sherlock, looking up at him with undisguised adoration. The firelight flickered in his dark eyes, accentuated the golden tone of his skin. He raised his tumbler of scotch and smiled. "To us, and a long deserved holiday."
He pulled on a pair of old, soft jeans that were now too loose, one of his old army tee shirts and a thick maroon jumper that Mrs Hudson had given him a million years ago for Christmas. She smiled when she saw it, and they shared fish pie and salad at the breakfast table between the sitting room windows. Sherlock flew in the door as they were finishing cups of coffee, and dropped a casual kiss on the top of John's head. Mrs Hudson clapped her hands together, her eyes bright, and they both hugged her before they left.
They had just put the star in the the reasonably priced car when John heard the front door rattle open, and Sherlock’s rapid footfalls climbing the stairs. He hadn’t even had time to rise off the sofa when the door to the flat swung open and Sherlock appeared, windblown and ruddy, his curls wild, coat still flapping a little around his calves.
Sherlock doesn’t want to spoil it, this perfect moment, with the sunlight breaking over their laps and their saliva being exchanged on the cigarette filter.
Sherlock stays quiet, reaches out and picks up his wine glass, sips patiently while John nibbles on his lower lip and tries to reform what Sherlock's said in his own words. It's fully dark outside now, the room is lit only by the pool of light cast by the floor lamp at the end of the sofa. They exist only in this space, in this moment together, the yellow glow of the light holding them in it.
"But you like it? It’s alright?" John's mouth against Sherlock's neck is possibly more miraculous than actual miracles. He never wants to talk again unless it's against Sherlock's neck.
This chair, and the thought that must have gone into choosing it, felt like a promise. A vow. It was permanence. He had never made so large a purchase with both of us in mind, and the symbolic significance of it was clear. Watson had, with this simple gesture, declared Baker Street to now be
Finally Sherlock speaks, his voice dangerously quiet. "You interfered with my work. You prevented me from solving a case. And I permitted you to do it. That cannot ever happen again."
John smiled against his mouth, and nipped Sherlock’s bottom lip with his teeth as he knelt up. Silhouetted against the orange glow of the fire, his skin golden and shimmering with sweat, hair standing up in messy spikes, the kilt draped beautifully over his sinewy hips and thighs, he looked exactly like the rugged highland warrior Sherlock had been envisioning since he laid eyes on the kilt. Sherlock watched, rapt, as John filled his palm with lube, parted the pleats of the kilt and stroked his prick.
John opens the door to Sherlock’s bedroom and sets the lamp on a dry sink to the left of the door. Sherlock follows, looking round at another room that should be familiar, but isn’t
“Oh. Uh. Pret a Manger. I could...I still have some money. Do you want one? I’ll go --” John makes to get up, so eager. Too eager, too friendly. There has to be an angle.
“Mmm.” John hums in agreement, leaning forward and pressing a hard kiss to Sherlock’s mouth. “Happy anniversary.”
Sherlock peered over John’s shoulder and through branches thick with pine cones. Loch Fyne lay still and grey in the crease of the valley below, and perched on the edge of the water was a sprawling medieval revival manor, all grey stone and paneled windows. It reminded Sherlock of a castle in a children’s book - almost too picturesque. Too perfect.
. John." Sherlock isn't strong enough to resist this, the momentary comfort of John leaning against him, the pleasure of his mouth and his hands on him. The small remainder of his ability to protest dissolves, and he lets his head fall back against John's arm, opens his eyes and looks down at John's fingers wrapped around him. The sight of it is so beautiful, so filthy gorgeous, his hips jump up automatically and a deep groan escapes him.
“Yeah, alright. Maybe tomorrow night. Don’t wander.” He had been a good shag. Actually got hard and let John get him off. Some of them didn’t. John did like to make them come. He could pretend it was Sherlock, writhing and shivering underneath him. Just as long as this one kept his mouth shut.
Now, properly sterilised, Sherlock’s arm lay across John’s bent knee, the pale inner skin facing up, his cephalic vein bright blue. John considered his arm, where was the best place to start. He clasped Sherlock’s elbow in one purple gloved hand and pressed the scalpel to Sherlock’s skin, not cutting yet, just holding it there. He felt very much the doctor in this moment, the caretaker, which was absolutely paradoxical and also made complete sense. He was caretaking. This is what Sherlock wanted - needed - to feel safe and anchored, and it was John's job to give him what he needed.
“It was true. Every word.” Sherlock says again, breathlessly, letting his eyes fall shut as John continues his leisurely exploration of Sherlock’s chest and belly by slipping his hand up under his tee shirt.
“No.” Sherlock shakes his head, crooked grin lighting up his face, and licks his lips. His voice drops. “You can pay me back later.”
John's arse is aesthetically perfect. Round and taut, a definitive line from buttock to thigh, a curve of muscle defined at his hip.
"Do stop calling me that." Satisfied they're alone, Sherlock perches on one end of the sofa, his hand sweatily clutching the phone in his pocket. The flat is so quiet. Frighteningly quiet. Jim is sure to hear him turn it on, hear the click of the button. "Mind if I take a piss?"
“You’re beautiful, my god. I’ve never seen anything like your face when it takes you. Never.” John peppered me with kisses, running his hands along my chest and my hips, down the fronts of my goose fleshed thighs. “I want a painting of it.”
“I missed you too.” Sherlock raises his head and looks up at John, his eyes soft grass green. “I’d like to talk, if you're amenable. About last night, and about, well, some other things.”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open, black and gleaming. He met John’s steady gaze and then looked at his mouth. His pupils dilated, his cheeks flushing hot. “Oh, your mouth, John.”
"Fine." Lestrade takes a seat at the rickety table between the windows, and flips open a lined notebook, pulls a pen from his jacket and clicks it. "Mrs Hudson, ma'am, you can go on downstairs. These boys are of age. They don't need a chaperone."
-" Sherlock's exclamations dissolve into a long gasping cry as he spills hot between them, coming so forcefully it spatters all over John's throat and chin.
The spasming of Sherlock's inner muscles around his prick is too much, and John can't hold it back anymore, allowing the thunderous crash of orgasm to take him. He convulses again and again, his stomach flooding with heat, the shivery sensation of cool electricity exploding through his nerve endings. He hears
Sherlock laid his face against the smooth muscle of John’s thigh and stroked two fingers along his length.
There's enough leather clad emo boys in this club, he could have his pick. However, at the moment, he's
Sherlock swallows. What he remembers is a choked down breakfast of runny eggs and beans on toast at Speedy’s, a cab ride to Tower Hill, laptops on their knees, getting stuck in wretched traffic and deciding to walk the rest of the way, John forgetting his mobile in the loo at Starbucks and them having to run back through a downpour to retrieve it, thus being late for a meeting with Lestrade at NSY, and ending the day with dinner in front of the telly so John could watch the premiere of Bake Off. He remembers the blue light of the television flickering on John’s face, the crumb in the corner of his mouth that Sherlock wanted lick away. He remembers John saying Bake Off made him hungry and grumbling about it until he wandered into the kitchen and ate half a package of orange Jaffa cakes standing against the counter in the dark. He remembers John’s silhouette against the kitchen window, the streetlamp glow around his ears, the curve of his hip in his jeans.
He strips quickly and leaves the clothes on the floor, climbs back on the bed between Sherlock's spread legs. The heat radiating off of his skin is palpable. "You're so turned on, I can
"You're a berk." But his voice was thick and drowsy, contented like a well-pet cat. John did like it sometimes when he purred. He let out a soft little rumble and John nipped at his shoulder.
Soft laughter in the grey light of a winter morning. Moving boxes piled in a corner. Reading glasses. A cottage surrounded by lilac bushes.
Sherlock reaches up, sinking his fingers into John’s hair, and pulls him down into a breathless kiss, all teeth and tongues and not artful in the least, not even objectively a
Sherlock’s kneeling next to a teetering stack of empty produce boxes, counting out the day’s take on the pavement, trying to calculate how much he can score before night falls. Hollow stomach, hollow soul, collapsed veins. His brain doesn’t even work right anymore. He can’t
His last moments of solitude before entering the chaotic bustle of life at Hogwarts are precious, and he doesn't want to share them. The six hour train ride to Hogsmeade station is always nearly intolerable for Sherlock; it takes him time to readjust to the constant thrum of other people after being essentially a hermit during breaks.
Sherlock nods, his eyes closed, teeth buried in his lower lip. He allows John to pull off his dressing gown, to pull him up to sitting and divest him of his ratty tee shirt. His bare chest is flushed red and pink, oval nipples dark and peaked. John leans over as Sherlock lays back down, drags his lips over the ridges of Sherlock’s ribs until he finds one erect nipple and closes his lips around it, sucking gently and laving his tongue in wide flat swathes. He nips at it, pulling the hard nub between his teeth until Sherlock’s squirming, breathing out a long string of whimpers and desperate little noises.
“No. He’s not happy. Not at all. All the disappearances seem to be connected to people with Muggle families, or who were friendly with Muggles, et cetera. A rash of Muggle killings doesn’t look good for the Ministry, or for Harry personally.”
Sherlock isn’t even sure what he likes. He likes John. He likes that John’s not miserable and angry and sobbing. He likes that John is smiling against his overheated too tight skin and that his thumb is rubbing a comforting circle against the inside of Sherlock’s left wrist. He likes that John is alive and back home where he belongs, and that John loves him. He likes that John’s
“Well, that’s a first.” Sherlock mumbles, eyes still closed as a satisfied little smirk creeps across his lips.
His voice was barely a whisper, shaking lips against Sherlock’s Adam’s apple. “I slept with prostitutes, Sherlock. A lot of them.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer, just reaches his left arm out and around John, trailing his fingers along the fading wallpaper as they walk up into the flat. Mrs Hudson is remarkably and thankfully not there. They’d purposefully not told her when exactly John was coming home, hoping to avoid her well-intentioned fussing until John has a chance to settle in.
He sinks down, entwining their bodies even further. His knee pushes against the inside of Sherlock’s thigh as he rocks up and his tongue pushes just that much farther into Sherlock’s mouth.
won’t let me starve.” John glances at him out of the side of his eye, licks over his bottom lip and follows with his teeth.
“Baby, I’m not gonna...I can’t…” John’s head fell forward heavy against Sherlock’s collarbone, kissing messily at his chest. His hips shuddered forward, his cock rubbing just at the spot that sent Sherlock’s nerve endings sparking white and silver, liquid metal coursing hot and thick through him, and he knew he wouldn’t last long either.
.” Jim enunciates every word, watches Sherlock with an open mouth for a long second. Takes a deep breath and scratches his head, turns away. “You know, Sherlock, I might have left you alone, let you move on with the golden boy over here...but you just had to rub it in my face. I can’t have that. You had to know I couldn’t have that.”
Sherlock allows himself to be pulled down next to John, their thighs together. The bedspread is soft, fragrant, the aroma of lavender rising around him as the mattress depresses.
A constant quiet thumping bass emits from John's iPod, docked into a tiny set of speakers on the bedside table, the volume too low to hear any of the melody. Sherlock takes a sip of his cold coffee, foraged hours ago from the kitchen, just before John emerged into the doorway puffy-eyed and sleep-rumpled, dragging Sherlock back into bed with just a heated stare and a well timed nibble at his bottom lip.
John still says nothing. This is his part. He is patient where Sherlock is rash, quiet when Sherlock is shouting, calm when Sherlock is frantic. It's his job to be so, even when he's feeling the opposite. He'll know when and if Sherlock needs a push to speak, and until then, he waits.
Mike turns the paper so he can read it, and then looks up at Sherlock with a furrowed brow. “Mycroft works directly with Harry Potter, doesn’t he, Sherlock?”
“Yeah, yeah, of course. Jesus, Sherlock. I’m sorry.” John shakes his head and clears his throat. His eyes fall shut and he lays his head against the swell of Sherlock’s thigh muscle. He looks sad and small and about nineteen years old.
A ball of searing hot anger is rising in John’s chest. They’ve never fought like this, even before they were together. Sherlock has never spoken to him like this. John tries to make himself understand. Sherlock’s never felt this before, and he’s lost. Sherlock doesn’t know how to deal with himself. That’s John’s role.
“I won’t.” He swayed his hips, brushed his hand over John’s bare stomach. “You’re sexy. I like you.”
When John awakes, he’s sprawled on his back, one leg hanging off the side of the sofa, with an afghan tucked around him. A fire is crackling merrily in the fireplace, the flames reflecting flickeringly off the maroon tiles. The flat smells like tomato sauce and fresh bread. It’s completely dark outside. He must have slept most of the day away, for hours and hours longer than Sherlock, certainly.
John wrenched his gaze from the fireplace, where he'd been staring into the blackened brick. Tea. Tea was simple. "Yes, alright. I'm sorry this is so - I should be happy. I should be happy to be home. I
He smiled and tilted his face toward me, the strong square line of his jaw absolutely begging to be kissed. “I did. It is
"John. Now," Sherlock takes his fingers out of himself, puts his hand on John's hip and tugs him forward.
ness. It’s visceral, in their blood their neurons their epidermis. Their souls, if Sherlock believed in that sort of thing. Joined. Sherlock knew it the moment he looked up at the back of that sweaty red tee shirt, and he realises John has probably knew in the alley. When their fingertips touched over that limp dick pickle. That quickly, they both felt it. John's fighting with himself now, arms crossed over his chest, fingers digging into his elbows. He looks across the river, that square jawline working, chewing at the inside of his cheeks.
“I’m glad, love. I want it to be so good for you.” John kissed at his thighs, the hollow of his pelvic bone. “I could spend my life kissing you, every part of you.”
John was halfway out of the car before Sherlock had even pulled the brake. He stood by the open door and stretched skyward, back bending, silhouetted against a huge orange moon. He rolled his shoulders and jumped up and down a few times, then strode purposefully toward the cottage. Sherlock hesitated, unsure of whether to grab the bags first or not, but then decided just to follow John into the house.
Usually Sherlock is taking things apart. Deducing things - crimes, people, even John - down into their tiniest bits, pulling them into separate pieces so he can see what they’re made of. The feeling of doing the opposite, of taking all these disparate ingredients and putting them together to make something whole and good and simple...it’s more pleasant than Sherlock could have imagined.
"Completely." John grins, biting at Sherlock's lower lip and pushing his hands up over his head. "And you'll love it."
John immediately releases his wrists, hand skimming lightly down the length of Sherlock’s arm. He watches his fingers, head tilted slightly to the side, as they trace over Sherlock’s elbow and tickle briefly at his armpit. Sherlock laughs and jerks his arm down - he can’t help it, he’s always been ticklish - and John’s eyes darken. A shiver runs down Sherlock’s spine. This feels different than last night. Wilder. John is...different.
As if he's a dog that pisses on the floor when no one's home. Hot anger mingled with humiliation gripped the back of his throat, his jaw. His hand clenched. How Sherlock must hate this. Hate him.
"I know." Sherlock's voice is low and dusky, and he bites his lip as he lifts John's left hand off his hip and drips far too much lube over his fingers. "There. I need those perfect fingers inside me."
“Of course I was angry - still am, if you’d like the long and short of it. Probably will be for quite a while. You broke my heart, you prick. Tends to piss people off.” John nuzzles against Sherlock’s throat, his answering little rumble of contentment vibrating against John’s lips.
John looks up at him with wide eyes, and draws his fingers down the side of Sherlock's face. "You look pretty fucking gorgeous with my come all over your face, you know that?"
"I know." Sherlock smirks, knowing that people in general do find him gorgeous, and that John in particular finds him even more so than most. Sherlock himself sees bony elbows and scarred veins, strangely wide set eyes, perpetually messy hair, everything about him too long and gangly to be truly beautiful. John thinks he is, though, and that's all that matters.
Sherlock glances back over the article and sets the paper back down, chewing his lip thoughtfully. This
“Oh, hello.” Lester waved again, and John suddenly felt powerfully sorry for him, just for a moment. He was absolutely pathetic. Worse than Molly when he’d first met her.
They whirl and trip their way over to the bar again. Sherlock leans his elbows on the edge and waves at the bartender. The bloke next to him, pink hair and septum pierced, turns, looks him up and down. Cocks an eyebrow.
There's a flicker of confusion in Sherlock's eyes, but he does as he's bid and lays his arms back down at his sides. John picks up Sherlock's right hand, kisses it softly, kisses over his wrist, to the crease of his elbow, over the swell of his bicep. Sets his chin on Sherlock's shoulder, and murmurs, "You are exquisite. You're even more exquisite when you're desperate for my cock, like you are right now. You're desperate for me to fuck you, aren't you?"
“Sherlock.” God, he hadn’t said his name in so long. It felt foreign on his tongue, awkward. “Sherlock. I opened my eyes.”
it behind his closed eyelids. Sherlock's hands skim down to the top of his jeans and stop, and John pulls back enough to say, "You can touch my arse, Sherlock. It's not off limits."
"You're the smartest person I've ever known. Much more so than I am. You’re remarkable, John." Sherlock says shakingly. He’s trembling so hard, John can see it.
"Come here and lay with me." John gets up, and Sherlock does the same. He turns back the bedding and slips under. "We've never slept in a real bed together, like where we have sides to pick from. Can I have the right?"
him stretching, the catlike way he moves in the mornings, all loose limbed and slow. He smiles, despite the throbbing physical discomfort, because he can’t help but smile at John. He still has his eyes closed, doesn’t realise John must be looking at him, until the sharp intake of John’s breath.
John reached out to touch me, his fingertips barely grazing my hip, but I moved just out of his grasp, casting a glance back over my shoulder as I walked from the sitting room. I knew well John’s fondness for the shape of my arse, the musculature of my back, and I could not help but swing my hips back and forth a bit more than was necessary. I paused at the kitchen doorway and bit my lip at him, dropped my gaze demurely to the floor. I trailed my fingertips along the window in the half open pocket door, smearing the glass. John's nostrils flared as he tilted his head down and watched me hungrily.
John brow gentles, uncreases. He reaches up as he did the night before, and brushes Sherlock’s fringe off of his forehead. “Only if you want to.”
"How do you know I'm not with someone already?" John arches an eyebrow, his voice husky.  He really couldn't be more seductive if he tried. Sherlock's absolutely aching for him, his lower belly heavy and hot with desire. He wants to bend him over the bar, push him up against the wall of glass shelves behind, listen to the bottles crashing around them while Sherlock fucks him.
"Yes. I wanted you to - " Sherlock swallows, biting his lip, trying to move his hips against John's hand, trying to urge his fingers back.
"Aren't you?" The minute it's out, he regrets it. Just a stupid retort, but it sounds awful, the tone all wrong. Sherlock's face crumples for a split second before rearranging itself. "Christ, Sherlock, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that."
We remained leaning heavily against each other, both rapturous and spent, John’s lips moving lazily over my neck and shoulders, until finally he softened entirely and pulled out. The warm rush down the insides of my thighs as he moved away gave me a shiver of delight and I felt him smiling against my back.
he?” John mutters hoarsely to himself, leaning back against the wooden window frame behind him and bracing his foot against the brick wall.
John kept whispering it, even when he knelt up, kilt in tangled folds across Sherlock’s knees locked around John’s waist. He whispered it as he rubbed his hands over Sherlock’s belly, as he took Sherlock’s stiff and needy prick in his hand and stroked him gently and then harder and then not nearly hard enough. He whispered it as his hips stuttered and he lost his rhythm and nearly came before Sherlock, his head bowed and breath billowing cool over Sherlock’s thighs as he tried to hold it back.
. His breath caught sharply at the look I cast him, and his fingers tightened in my hair, tipping my head back enough to expose my throat. A shudder of pleasure pulsed through me that made my hips jerk.
Sherlock stretches and arches, and John settles his hands on his waist, and pushes up enough that he can put his weight on his right hand and wrap his left hand around Sherlock's cock, which is so hard and wet and beautiful that John's mouth fills with saliva at the sight of it in his hand. Sherlock's twisting and tensing, raising his hips up to meet John's thrusts and making low rough noises in his throat. His cock pulses against John's fingers.
John grins - all white teeth and glimmering lips - and looks up at Sherlock, eyes wide and dark with desire.
“Well. Yeah. But not just because it’s pretty, you know. I -- my sister used to bring me here when we were little, and we’d eat ice creams and watch the boats. She used to say,” John clears his throat, makes a rippley motion with his mouth. “She used to say things would get better. That we’d be alright. Somehow I always -- this bridge makes me think of my sister and ice cream. That’s all.”
And suddenly Molly’s in his arms, her thin arms wrapped tight around his neck, and she’s kissing the side of his face, and tears are pricking at his eyes as he puts his nose into her hair.
Our kisses grew ferocious, biting at each other’s mouths in our urgency, John’s sticky hands coming up to tangle in my hair and draw my face even more tightly against his own. I looped my arms around his neck and rode him in slow circles, my thighs slipping against the sweat-slick leather. John was covered in perspiration, his golden skin glowing in the flickering light. It was becoming desperately hot, the fire behind me crackling and popping. A bead of sweat trickled down my spine.
Quicker than John can process what's happening, Sherlock's rolled on top of him, caging him under his larger frame. John burrows into the bed, rolling his neck, the quiet intimacy of this moment even more intoxicatingly loving than what came before. Sherlock's soft cock, still wet and hot from their multiple rounds of lovemaking, brushes against John's lower belly. He bends his knees, brackets Sherlock's hips, hands automatically roaming up under Sherlock’s shirt, running warm across that expanse of marked skin, over his still peaked nipples, playing with his feathering of chest hair.
"I never want to leave this bed." John can't not kiss him, his lips so pink and full. They kiss quietly for a long minutes, kiss until John's belly starts to tingle again.
"What it would be like to go home. Because I haven't stopped thinking about it for a solitary second since..." Sherlock took a deep breath and sank deeper onto his heels, laid his arms alongside John's thighs. "We'll get a cab from Heathrow and ask him to drive us through the whole of London before we get to Baker Street. We'll get home in the early morning, when the sun is still low and orange, and the river will be shining and glimmering, the tide will be in and the water will be high. We'll roll down the windows and smell the water, and you'll reach across the seat of the cab and take my hand. We’ll have the cabbie drive up Regent Street right to the mouth of the park, and then turn left on Marylebone Road. Speedy’s will be closed, and there won’t be anything to eat in the flat, so we’ll stop at that Costa on Baker Street before we go home, and get coffees and breakfast rolls. When we get home, we'll stand on the kerb for a few minutes, just taking it in, seeing what's changed, how the stone's gotten just a bit sootier, the door a bit more scuffed. I'll make sure the knocker's crooked, and you'll laugh and tell me I'm ridiculous. I'll open the door, and we'll smell Mrs Hudson's breakfast cooking - rashers and eggs and tea - and the sunlight will be tumbling down the steps up to 221B, and you'll reach up and pull my face down to yours and kiss me, and it'll taste like airport coffee and unbrushed teeth and it will be perfect and we'll never want to stop. We'll walk up the steps, you in front of me, and I'll carry the bags. When we get in the flat, it will be dusty and stale and we'll throw open the curtains and the windows and run our fingers over every book, every old newspaper, every bit of clutter that's just as we left it. We'll sit in our chairs, and light the fire, and smile at each other, and you’ll make tea, and it will be as though we never left. Except it will be even better, because...we can say it now. Because loving each other won’t hurt anymore like it used to.  All this ugliness and being apart behind us forever.
John's pleasured whispers fill every corner of the empty room, echoing in Sherlock's ears as he inches his lips forward, forces his tongue down. He can't help a slight scrape of teeth as he takes John deeper. The head so broad it’s nearly choking him, he tries to disassociate himself from his gag reflex. His teeth scrape the underside, and he flattens his tongue, trying to somehow keep his teeth away from sensitive skin. John doesn't seem to mind, jerking and panting above him, murmuring quiet little encouragements and rubbing his hand in circles at the base of Sherlock's skull.
What they could do to each other, the force of this. It startled John sometimes, how frightening it could be to love someone with your whole soul, with every cell in your body. When he would wake in the middle of the night, watch Sherlock sleeping, and allow himself to really feel the raw, fierce love that he could never permit to overtake him when Sherlock was awake, he inevitably ended up in tears, with a vague ache in his chest that lasted all night.
John holds the oil lamp up to his face. Sherlock can see now that it has a curved mirror at the back, presumably to enhance the weak light of the wick. He also sees his own wavering reflection in the spotted glass. His hair is slicked back from his face and straightened, not in his usual loose curls, and he is wearing a high white collar buttoned tightly at his throat. He runs his hands over his own chest, thick tweed and braided leather buttons under his palms. He doesn’t even
Sherlock shakes his head into the soft cotton of John's worn red shirt, his nose rubbing against the buttons.
He pulled the blade in a short line, but deeper than the first cut, and the blood swelled up more quickly. He tossed the blade aside and lowered his mouth to the blooming pool of blood in the crease of Sherlock's elbow. Licking over the wound with gentle flickers at first, he experimentally dipped the top of his tongue into the opening and was rewarded with a bone deep groan from Sherlock that reverberated through his own arm.
“Oh, John. I love you so much." Sherlock curled over John’s back, tall enough to hook his chin over John’s shoulder and kiss him, sweeping his tongue along John’s lower lip. His hand skidded down the planes and swells of John’s lower belly, found his stiff and leaking prick and took him in hand. He thumbed rhythmically at the slit, soft skin giving just a little as he pressed enough to make John tremble.
John thrusts forward and stills, breathing raggedly through his mouth. He jerks forward once more and then there’s a rush of wet heat inside Sherlock that makes him clench his legs around John impossibly tightly. He’s filled up with John, John everywhere, in his pores and his cells and his bloodstream, and he can’t do anything but cling to him and shake as John collapses across his chest with a harsh moan.
Sherlock shut the door quietly and latched it, swept his coat off his shoulders and hung it up on the singular hook John had screwed into the doorframe a few months previous. Sherlock always forgot to take his coat off downstairs, and John couldn’t bear it laying over the backs of chairs around the flat. It was a pet peeve of his, clothes in places they shouldn’t be, and Sherlock had been corrected more than once over leaving his coat over the back of John’s chair.
Sherlock had never commented on the sudden lack of girlfriends, never once. He must have realised John wasn’t dating anymore, that every single evening they weren’t off chasing criminals and filling out paperwork at Scotland Yard was now spent in their pyjamas, often sharing a blanket on the sofa, Sherlock getting up occasionally to make a fresh pot of tea. He must have noticed John rarely spend nights at the pub with Mike, begged off when Greg invited him for poker nights. He must have noticed how John’s friendly devotion had transformed into a partnership unbreakable by anything short of death. But he never said a thing.
"I know I can. It’s not that. This isn’t easy for me to talk about either, John." Sherlock wriggles back into John's hand. "Submitting to you is simple for me. It's uncomplicated, really. Putting aside The Work for a moment, you are the purpose in my life. The only thing - person - I've ever loved enough to want to set aside my own needs. You being happy, you being happy with me, that's what brings me fulfillment. I want to cater to you, to what you want. I want you to always be pleased with me. And when you are, when you're pleased and proud of me, that's the most amazing feeling, John. It's like being high. It's flying. I've never felt anything like it before."
“Inside me, please, please. I want you inside me so badly, John, please,” Sherlock’s insensible now, biting at John’s lips and thrusting urgently and unevenly, no longer able to restrain himself.
As we slipped into bed that evening, well-scrubbed and full to the brim with Mrs Hudson’s mutton stew, John curled tightly against my back and draped his arm over my waist. The cool metal of his ring laid sweetly against my bare skin.
John sucked in a breath and tried to calm his hammering heart. They were right. He was all out of sorts, just drunk enough to be morose and tetchy. These were guys he worked with every day, who had been to Baker Street for dinner before, who knew and liked Sherlock. This evening was spiraling quickly downhill, and if he was honest, the real object of his ill temper was Sherlock. For missing the match, for not needing him on the case. That wasn't Owen's or Tommy's fault, or even really Sherlock's.
“Something like that.” Sherlock’s grin fades as she lurches an old green pushbutton phone up on the counter and turns back to her computer. He pulls a wrinkled slip of paper from his pocket and dials. “Mrs Hudson? Hi. How are you? Um. this is Sherlock, the boy from the -- yes, he’s alright. Well. I was just thinking about what you had said, and, um…would that flat, perchance, still be available?”
He doesn’t sleep. Instead he lies there, trying to conjure up what it felt like to be the broken, desperate junkie that he was just a few days ago. It seems so distant, so foreign. Like someone else’s life entirely. But it wasn’t, not at all, and it’s not far away. It’s close, it’s
"Mmmm, not yet." John bends down and kisses the middle of Sherlock's belly, smooth and warm and covered in soft downy blonde hairs. He pulls at the waist of Sherlock's trousers with his teeth, which makes Sherlock suck in a noisy breath and curl his fingers into John's hair. "These have to come off."
“Alright, boys. No fighting today, alright? I’d really like to just get this over with, and with a minimum of fuss.” John already sounds weary. He takes a cup from the coffee service Mycroft had brought in, picks up the silver carafe and pours. He holds the cup up to his mouth and blows a breath across it, rippling the surface. His eyes flick up to meet Sherlock’s.
” and then bobs his head and licks and licks until Sherlock is shaking, one arms straight against the wall, holding him up, and with the other, tugging at John’s hair desperately.
"First, I truly appreciate you respecting my wishes to be left alone this week. It wasn't easy for either of us, but I think it was necessary."
. The Sherlock-ness of that cut through the embarrassment, brought a slow smile to John's reluctant lips. He buried his face against Sherlock's damp neck and tried to breathe. They stepped onto the landing, and Sherlock didn't put John down. He nudged the unlocked door to the flat open with his shoulder and made his way to the sofa before bending down and carefully lowering John into it.
Followed all the way to the entrance hall by Professor Longbottom, Sherlock doesn’t have the chance to say anything more than, “See you tomorrow,” to John, as he ascends the staircase up to Gryffindor Tower.
John breathed in sharply and threw the blanket back off of them, then kicked his boxers the rest of the way off. Sherlock ran his hand up and then down John’s cock, over his bollocks, and down his left leg. He lingered there, massaging the swell of his calf, trailing his fingers through sparse blonde hair, rubbing the tightness of his anterior cruciate ligament. John had always had athlete's legs, bowed at the knees, shapely and firm and covered in tiny scars that spoke to the kind of life he had lived - spent skidding across rugby pitches, kneeling in rough desert sand, scaling alley walls in East London with a gun in one hand - but now they were even more so, every muscle defined, hardened, mouthwateringly gorgeous.
“You fancy that idea a lot more than you’d like me to think, genius.” John wiped his mouth with his napkin, scrubbing at the moustache and beard a bit. “Some long repressed fantasies involving rugby socks and locker rooms?”
- there's Sherlock's tongue, just the tip, sliding against the inner rim of Johns lower lip. John grabs at Sherlock's shirt, pulling him close, looking for something to anchor himself to, because shit, he's swooning, he's actually
“Now that you mention it, I did think you smelled rather strongly of latex on Tuesday night, but I didn’t want to insult you by mentioning it.” Eyes amused, his cheeks flushed, Sherlock looked so boyish and beautiful that John lost his train of thought entirely.
This he did over and over - rubbing me, stretching me - all the while kissing and nibbling at my arse and thighs reverently, until I was absolutely delirious. My body curled in on itself, head resting on my folded arms, my hips rolling uncontrollably against the press of John’s hand. His knuckles brushed against my bollocks and I groaned, my stomach contracting hard. I opened my eyes to see the maroon flush of my thighs, the streaks of sweat down my belly.
is actually entirely inadequate. I've died twice and come back. Who do you think I was coming back for?"
this. How to trust someone with his whole heart, to lay himself open and allow John to see how weak and stupid and useless he can be. He
beautiful. How I longed to see your beautiful face this week while you were away, to watch the furrow of that perfect brow as you worked, the pout of your mouth as you lay sleeping beside me, the fire in those emerald green eyes when you’re working at a seduction,” he teased, and slipped his hand from my grasp. He trailed the tips of his left middle and index fingers down the sensitive skin of my stomach, rubbed them over the crest of my hip, his right hand now sliding up my thigh to my other hip, and raised his eyes again to mine. “Well, you’ve seduced me well and properly. Tell me how I can please you best, love, tell me what you need.”
It occurs to him that as John is getting better, stronger, more like how he was before, that Sherlock too is coming back to himself. Now that the danger isn’t so immediate, now that they’re home, fitted back into the framework of people who care about them both, watch over them both, a weight has lifted from Sherlock’s shoulders. The caretaker, the strong one, those aren’t his natural roles. He hopes he can hang on long enough to get John well, to get this damned Malvo sorted, to put their lives back together. Because John is not quite well yet, and they’ve only been home for a few days, and Sherlock still doesn’t fully understand everything that happened to John while they were apart. He doesn’t have the data to predict how this is all going to go, and they still have Malvo to contend with.
"Sherlock, I am seriously, truly, not in the mood. Stop it." John grumbled, pushed back with his bum and elbowed Sherlock in the ribs. "I'm going back to sleep now. If you'd like us to
Both Sherlock and Pearl Nygaard had ended up with bashed in skulls, bleeding out onto concrete, brain matter spattered around them. Both at the hands of the men who loved them, had sworn to keep them safe. John was no less at fault than Lester.
"But you found me distracting." John smoothes the curl, then tucks it behind Sherlock's ear, which is something he's been wanting to do for five years.
"I - no, I did. I knew, but - I can see it." John rubs his nose against Sherlock's, sweeps a thumb over his closed eyelid. "Here. I can
“I just want to make sure you’re alright, John.” Half his words get lost in the press of his face against John’s chest as he burrows impossibly close and tucks three cold fingers under the placket and against John’s bare skin.
“Coming out, love?” John says easily, leaning out of Harry’s embrace, his eyes just the littlest bit red and wet.
Sherlock bites into his lip, looks down to John’s small red mouth, thinks about the last time he kissed someone when he wanted to. When it wasn't a means to an end, when it wasn't a stranger in a car groping him. When he wasn't trying to block it out. The hungry heat of someone’s tongue snaking into his mouth, their body sweet and heavy on top of him, the gentleness of warm hands cradling his face.
A doctor in blue scrubs - why is everything in hospital blue? - and a plastic mask meets them in the hallway. There are barely any other patients there. Must be a strange time for traumatic emergencies, 11:00am.
John spins round and kisses Sherlock’s bicep, looking up at him with eyes full of flame, his eyelashes reflecting blue and purple in the flashing lights. “I’m the jealous type, just so you know.”
. John infiltrating his entire consciousness, surrounding and holding him. John always had him. John was his soft safe place to fall. The only person who's ever wanted him for him, not for what he could do, not for the brain, but loved him brokenly and imperfectly human. Sherlock could never have let go like this before John, could never have let anyone see him begging for touch, moaning in pleasure, lost in the transport.
Left alone to wait for John, Sherlock doesn’t know what to do with himself. He stands up and then sits back down, watching John down on the grass, shaking hands and slapping backs, his face ruddy and his back soaked with perspiration. He looks up, for the second time that day seeming to sense Sherlock’s eyes on him, and smiles, then holds up his finger and mouths “Just a minute.”
"Nevermind." John laughs again, full and fond, and rubs his hand down his chest, pats his belly.  "I'm going to go make a sandwich. Want anything?"
Sherlock crawls into bed beside John, melds to his side, their bodies perfectly corresponding shapes. Made to be together this way.
I raised my eyes languidly to his, feeling weak with my passion for him, my normally composed mind nothing but a muddle of
He’s freezing cold. He can’t think. He watches, numb, as they load John into the back of the ambulance. A gloved hand lowers down to help him in. “Well, come on, then.”
“Shut the fuck up,” John says without anger, looking up at Sherlock through long honey coloured lashes. “I told you yesterday. I will never love anyone else, I will never do this with anyone else. I don’t care. And your judgment is shit, obviously, so shut up.”
“It wasn’t - horrible,” Sherlock pants, his calves burning as the climb gets steeper. They enter a little thicket of apple trees, the pale sunshine dappling in patches on the grass.
"Never thought what, John?" Sherlock mouths at John's hair, pulls him down close until their torsos are flat against each other and John's arm is now at an odd angle for what he's doing, and his forearm cramps a little, but he doesn't care, because Sherlock is against him, sweaty and naked and licking at his temple with his fingers clawing at John's back, and John's life has actually never been better than at this moment.
“Sort of,” he pants, because he really can’t find the words to say even half of that. “I’ll tell you about it later, okay? I'm a bit - occupied at the mo -"
"That's what Mycroft and I were just discussing. We're unclear of his precise associations - sufficed to say for now that he's a recipient in a money trail that begins with Moriarty, and involves dozens of criminals across Europe and the United States. I'll be meeting with Mycroft tomorrow to discuss it more in depth, and hopefully his people will have dug up more information by then."
John sucks in a hard breath, head swimming, and grabs at the table with his free hand to anchor himself. “Jesus.”
The weight of John across his thighs, the rhythmic smack of his hands on Sherlock's bare skin as he sings softly along with the song, it's all so. Almost hypnotising. Sherlock tosses the kindle aside, laying his head down on his folded arms, a cosy drowsiness spreading through him.
“Alright.” Sherlock stares up at the ceiling, focuses on the cobweb dangling in front of the window. He curls his arm around John’s shoulders - too bony, too small - and wishes he had a cigarette.
John’s forehead bangs against Sherlock’s as they both curl forward over the the mess they’ve made between them. “
“Thank you. I hope so.” Sherlock doesn’t tell John all his worries, that he won’t be as brilliant as Mycroft, that he’ll disappoint him somehow, that he’s not as clever as everyone thinks he is.
John clears his throat, ruminating on exactly how he wants to phrase the tumble of words in his mind. “You make me feel very loved.”
him. He wraps his arms desperately around John’s shoulders and buries his face in the crook of his neck, muffling the pathetic little sob that he can’t quite contain.
He pulled into a parking spot at the back of the hotel and ducked his head down against the swirling snow. He was half frozen and numb by the time he got into the hotel lobby, but he couldn’t be bothered to care.
Sherlock’s hands dive into his hair, frantically tugging. His eyes are brimming with angry tears. “I’ve never. Never not solved a case.
“I don’t deserve you.” Sherlock buries his face in John’s strong neck, lets him hold him up, run his fingers over Sherlock’s nape.
John reaches up and thumbs over Sherlock's mouth, sending tendrils of electricity shivering down his neck. "I really,
He takes his time sending the email, words it carefully, beginning and ending with a profuse apology for having forgotten, and then shuts the phone off. He doesn’t want to talk to anyone. Doesn’t want to hear it ring or buzz or interrupt
“Oh. Thanks.” Sherlock doesn’t take his eyes away from John as he sits down at the Gryffindor table with Albus and Greg, and begins piling his plate with food.
, and now here's Sherlock in his arms, kissing him, his warm tongue soft and slick and touching every part of John's mouth it can reach. It's all happening so fast, after all these years of bottling it up. No time to overthink, just to feel, to do what comes naturally. Sherlock's right hand twists up against John's neck, cradling the back of his head, thumb rubbing hot behind his ear.
- as his eyes flick down to John’s cock. Soft, larger than average, and just barely duskier than the rest of his skin, nestled in thick blonde hair which feathers over the insides of his thighs and up to his navel.
"Mmmm. Yeah. Breathing is good. I want you to keep doing that." John kisses the end of Sherlock's nose and nudges at his thighs. "Go on then."
It’s impossible to think clearly, not with the scent of John’s skin all around him, with John’s belly expanding against him with every breath. This is all he’s ever wanted, to be held by John like this, he needs to just absorb every detail of how this feels. Even if it's nothing but a dream, due to dissipate at any moment into the glare of daylight.
“Nearest cheap motel.” John ignored the persistent chirping of the phone and rested his forehead against the smeared glass of the cab window. The cab started, jerked, pulled out into the ring of the airport road. They left the airport and merged onto a sprawling four lane road, the silvery skyline of Minneapolis laid out in the distance.
. The water runs cold before John even has a chance to wash his hair, and they stumble out, pushing each other, shivering and laughing.
"Ha. Casework. Yeah, right. You can't even leave me by myself in the flat, apparently." It came out bitter and furious. He didn't apologise.
to be looking for his mark, a weasley little East London drug dealer who's wanted in a triple homicide, and also happens to frequent this club. He's
John kisses him again, gently this time, and slides his right hand down to take Sherlock’s left. “I want to take you to bed now.”
"We'll go next week. This case we're on now should be wrapped up by then, and we just won't take a new one until we get back."
They’ve been waiting for Mycroft for twelve minutes, closed in this silent cavernous room, when the door finally swings open. Mycroft closes the heavy walnut door behind him, a nearly imperceptible snick of the lock as it catches the only sound it makes. He pads across the thick blue carpeting and holds out his hand.
"You - that was - come here," John reaches out an arm to tuck it under Sherlock's head, and Sherlock inches forward, throws his left arm over John's waist.
Sherlock's head jerked back in surprise and he swallowed noisily, John’s fingertips pressed up against his throat. “What do you mean…”
"Yeah. Good." So nervous he feels like a virgin, he goes stiff as John's face rolls into his neck, breath hot against his Adam's apple. He’s so tender with Sherlock it hurts. No one’s ever touched him like this.
Sherlock wants to leap off the sofa and hug her, kiss her papery cheeks, and tell her everything. She would believe him, utterly and completely. She wouldn’t even question it.
“Okay.” Sherlock nods, his eyes ticked up at the corners, every laugh line and crease deepening as his smile grows.
John’s skin is sheened with a thin layer of sweat now, slick under Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock laps at him - animalistic and desperate - all his smooth seduction forgotten in the wake of throbbing visceral need. His nostrils are filled with the scent of John, masculine and musky under the layer of sugary sweet body glitter, and Sherlock has never ever wanted another person to come as badly as he wants John to right now. He slips his hand between his legs, plays with his balls, rolling them in his hand, dragging the pad of his thumb between them. John spreads his knees, tips his arse up, encouraging Sherlock’s exploring fingers.
“It’s fine, Sherlock.” John squeezes his fingers and sips his coffee, then sets the cup on the table with a solid thump. “Go ahead, Mycroft. I’m ready.”
"Yeah. I don't want to be gawked at like a fucking monkey at the zoo." John forced himself not to flip off his audience, pressed his palm against Sherlock's palm and pulled him toward the door. "Come on, we're getting drenched."
He closes his eyes and rubs his mouth against Sherlock's throat, and Sherlock instinctively wraps his arms around John's back.  Sherlock's hands are warm and bony, skating flat up John's back, fingers slow over each vertebra, mapping, tracing. His head starts to go floaty light, hormone drunk, just from this. Just from twenty seconds of Sherlock's hands on his bare back. He hasn't felt this, this kind of wanting to just sink down into another person, evaporate and drift into them until he can't tell the difference between their heartbeat and his, for years, forever, since before he even met Sherlock.
want to. Very much." Sherlock tries to take John's face in his hands, but John ducks and turns his back, walks past him into the kitchen. "Please don't be angry. I do want to. John."
.” John puts his hands against Sherlock’s chest, pushes him away. His mouth is open, panting, bottom lip so pouty and full from being kissed that just looking at it makes Sherlock shiver with anticipation. “I thought we were going on a date. Remember?”
“Good. I think he’s gonna need all of that love. He’s been through a lot.” She noted something on the chart hanging off the end of the bed. “I gotta finish my rounds, I’ll see you both later.”
He’s enchanting. He’s made of fucking starlight, floating down through Sherlock’s skin and his bloodstream and lighting him up from the inside out. Sherlock wants to consume him, wants to be consumed
She bustles in with a large wooden tea tray, cups and saucers in a sensible blue and white pattern, a mountain of baked good teetering on small plates. The scent of baked apples fills the air. She turns to set it on the breakfast table, and catches Sherlock’s eye. She looks exactly the same as always, her flyaway hair and a merry twinkle in her eye. It makes Sherlock’s chest ache.
Sherlock doesn't argue that he shouldn't be embarrassed. Doesn't protest that he didn't fuck up the case. He knows those things are true, and Sherlock won't coddle him and tell him they're not.
John can feel the delicious swell of Sherlock’s cock alongside his own, the wetness of his precome spreading sticky between his fingers as he approaches orgasm. “Sherlock. Sherlock. Come, love, come on. I want to see you, I want you all over me, come on,” He pants, desperate for him, desperate for this, this confirmation of who they are together, that they’re going to be alright.
He rolled down the window, seemingly oblivious to the rain blowing cold across his face. Sherlock watched as he closed his eyes and lifted his chin, his eternally furrowed brow relaxing smooth. “Ah, god, can you smell it, Sherlock?”
“I thought you hated me.” Sherlock pulls them closer together, though that hardly feels possible, and ducks his head down so he can press kisses along John’s cheek and over the curve of his orbital bone. “Though I realise now that was a fairly significant miscalculation.”
There’s a harrumph of frustration behind him and Sherlock’s hands withdraw slowly from his waist, though John can feel them still hovering at the small of his back.
The rest of the day is almost as if nothing has changed. They get a cab from Speedy's to Scotland Yard, talk with Greg about the case, and he smiles at bit more than usual at them and gives John a knowing wink as they leave which makes John blush from his hairline to his collar. They run a merry chase through Soho before John pins their target against a sooty brick wall and Greg cuffs him and hauls him in. They go home and have dinner with Mrs Hudson, who kisses Sherlock on the cheek as they head upstairs and says, "Finally," and they both giggle, because
? How it plays into what he already believes?” Sherlock can hear in his voice the wheedling tone that he loathes. Mummy always caved to it, and Mycroft used to mock him for it incessantly. He clears his throat and tries again. “John, he is convinced you’ll never stay with me, that this is just an interlude for you. If I go crawling back to him telling him that you’ve gone home to your parents, that he was right…”
.” He grabs the front of Sherlock’s shirt and pulls him down, their elbows getting all twisted together and John’s neck is at an odd angle, but it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters except Sherlock’s tongue in his mouth and his weight laying across John’s hips, and finally. Just fucking
He fell over Sherlock rough and fast, supported by his left arm next to Sherlock’s ear, while he skated his right hand up the back of Sherlock’s bent leg. Sherlock’s legs instinctively closed around John’s waist, heels pressing against the perfect curve of his spine. John smiled as the head of his cock pressed just that much into Sherlock’s loosened entrance, brought his hand up and brushed the back of it against Sherlock’s forehead, pushed his hair from his brow. The warmth in John’s desire blackened irises was aching, the intensity of this moment almost too much for Sherlock to bear. He closed his eyes against the surging emotions in them both, and John leaned down on his elbow, pushing inexorably into Sherlock’s body with a bone deep groan.
She smiles at him in the way Sherlock imagines everyone must smile at John Watson, fond and beaming, already proud of him for whatever perfect thing he's going to do next. "Well, aren't you a handsome one? It's lovely to meet you, John. Welcome home."
Sherlock's hand is immediately over his mouth. "I thought I told you not to make a sound. Or should I stop?" John shakes his head, fighting the urge to rip Sherlock's hand away from his face. He could easily get out of this if he wanted to. He
“No, fuck, it’s so good, that feels so - “ John’s voice breaks, and the sound of it lodges painfully behind Sherlock’s sternum. He wants John to make that sound underneath him every day for the rest of his life.
"It's...hang on, there's a note." John pulled out a folded piece of yellowy note paper with a spring of Scottish heather embossed in the corner. "
“I know.” Sherlock pulls back from where he’s been kissing at John’s jawline, his smile slow and sultry, his eyelids half closed.
Watson and I had lived together since very nearly the moment we met, our two lives immediately and effortlessly twining into one. Our more intimate relationship had come excruciatingly slowly, however. It was no small thing to trust another man with the secret interior of your heart, especially when a misplaced confidence could send you to the gaolhouse. So we had initially lived as bachelors and colleagues, and then many years as friends, though neither of us sought the company of anyone else after our acquaintance began. We were content to be exclusively with each other, every moment of every day.
“I see you’ve been at the pastries again, Mycroft.” Sherlock bites out, protectiveness over John welling up in him at Mycroft’s smug expression.
There's something simmering in the room now, the air charged. It feels to John as though they're in a roller coaster car, teetering right at the summit of the most brilliantly terrifying drop. There is no way back except to fall, no way forward except the same. His hands are shaking on his coffee cup.
John’s smile broadens. “Good. I would too. Maybe - it’s a Hogsmeade weekend. Do you want to walk down with me?
They made their way out of London, traffic getting thicker as the hour wore on. Sherlock hit the accelerator as  they merged onto the M1, turned up the radio - some Radiohead album John had chosen - and felt rather like they were going on a grand adventure. For his part, John had been mostly silent since they'd gotten in the car, just watching the city go by as they wound their way northwest on the A41.
“I do now. I understand now.” Back muscles stiffening, preparing for it, waiting for the rage that was about to be unleashed. He very nearly winced, as if against a blow. John probably wouldn’t hit him, but it would feel like he had. Every angry word a laceration, a scar that Sherlock would bear forever.  He whispered again, “I’m sorry.”
It was as if Sherlock wasn't standing beside him, warm and solid and breathing. The loss of Sherlock, of himself, everything that had happened since came crashing down on him in a suffocating wave. That was his life. Motels and misery, prostitutes who stole his money and half his soul. His own bloody arms in the dark.
"Don't you dare. I'm not ashamed of you, so you're not allowed to be either. You hear me?" John kisses him again, then his chin and his eyes, his forehead.
Sherlock feels the shudder that runs through John, their bodies barely discernable from each other, pressed together from mouths to toes. John lifts his head from where it was nestled in the curve of Sherlock’s shoulder, gives him a look of such intense tenderness that Sherlock has to shut his eyes.
“I won’t. I promise. I won’t.” Sherlock can’t pull his lips from the sweet hot smell of John’s skin. Somehow his hands are inside John’s tee shirt, kneading the thick muscles at the small of his back.
Ginger nodded tightly and hurried down the corridor. A door Sherlock couldn’t see creaked open and slammed shut, a din of strained voices escaping briefly into the quiet hall. The medics they’d seen pull up earlier blurred past the window to Sherlock’s left, head round to what was likely the kitchen entrance.
"You know how fucking impressed I am by you, right?" John squints at Sherlock, watching him as he hoists the telly on top of the dresser and looks for an outlet.
“We could, you know. Take a look. Being from London, and all. He’s worked with Scotland Yard a few times.”
John reaches down and yanks the blankets up from where they're bunched at the end of the bed, pulls them crookedly over both of them. "Better?"
John’s head was buzzing so hard he could barely think. He watched as Sherlock picked up the other scalpel and pressed it against his arm. Anticipation coiled hot in his belly. He laid the blade in his hand against Sherlock’s arm, and looked up at him.
Sherlock's smile is wistful, sad even. "I'm always lost without you, John, as you well know. Can't even get into the flat without you, apparently."
“Just a cab.” He didn’t even like to say the word. He could hear in his memory a thousand different iterations of Sherlock saying it.
“Shall we rent a car?” Sherlock nibbled at John’s left shoulder blade, rubbed his nose in a circle against the unblemished skin around the white raised scarring.
“Oh god that feels good.” John rolls his head to the side, nose against the underside of Sherlock’s chin. “You have no idea how good you are, you know. At all of this.”
.” Sherlock says, meaning it in every way John could possibly interpret it. He touches John’s mouth with two fingers, draws them back and forth over his bottom lip. "Are you still angry?"
- deepens the kiss and pulls John closer to him. His hand curls into a fist at the small of John’s back, the fingers of his other hand squeeze around John’s wrist, and he makes a low needy sound that makes John’s entire body contract. He gasps and bites down involuntarily, nipping Sherlock’s lip.
“Oh, god, Sherlock,” John husked out, his body in the state of constant motion that always signaled he was close - his hands scrabbling at the bedsheets, the headboard, running over his own torso and face, his toes curling and uncurling into the turned back blankets, hips trying to arch and buck even as Sherlock did his best to hold him still.
John breathes deep. Finally he breaches past the tightness into the heat and slick of John’s body, and they gasp together as Sherlock’s hips roll up to meet John’s arse.
"I fucking know that, Sherlock! I'm a goddamned doctor." He snapped, and winced immediately at the hurt that flashed in Sherlock's eyes. The searing burst of anger cleared the fog of panic for a moment. "Shit. Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm fine. I'm
I tiptoe into the bedroom. Your arm is thrown across my side of the bed, fingers tangled in my pillowcase. I lay down beside you, and you immediately pull me in, wrapping your entire body around me like a vine. You kiss my ear sleepily and murmur
"I don't, no." Sherlock brushes the dirt and gravel off his hands, brushes them on the back of his jeans.
Sherlock woke before John, the pale morning light casting a bluish pall over the hospital room. His arm was completely numb behind John’s shoulders, but it didn't occur to him to move it. John's face was tucked under his chin, resting heavily against Sherlock's collarbone. Only the nubby end of that perfect nose was visible, and Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from tracing a finger over it. John snuffled and sighed, the sound of which burrowed down inside, making a home right in the center of Sherlock's chest.
“Now it’s very clear.” Kiss him again. Gentle. Slow. Lips pliant and sweet. John’s hand at the small of his back. Sherlock pulls away this time. “We should go. Get it over with.”
"Oh John, oh my god." He knows he should be putting the condom on, but the feeling of John's hand against his naked flesh is mindbendingly good. He rocks forward into John's grasp, desperate for more.
,” Sherlock mumbles around the filter between his lips, taking a long, deep drag. “I’ve got enough in my trunk to last until Christmas holidays.”
Propped up on his bent right elbow, Sherlock drifted his gaze over John’s sleeping form. That always shaggy blonde hair - no matter how short and rigid the haircut, it just grew in messy - was currently standing up in little spikes, which suited John’s face enough that Sherlock made a mental note to make him wear it gelled up like this later. His face was paler than usual, but his cheeks and forehead were ruddy - probably windburn - and he had a small blackish bruise at the hinge of his jaw. Those criminally long eyelashes looked even longer than usual, resting gently against the whiteness of his cheeks. The beard he’d now had for more than a year had darkened to a deep rust brown, streaked with just enough grey to look distinguished and not enough to make John look older. It was slightly longer than John normally kept it, straggling down over his Adam’s apple and curled course strands up near his earlobes. Sherlock preferred it this way, a bit wild.
“Good,” John murmurs, running his hand possessively over Sherlock’s hip. “Glad to hear it. It would be pretty embarrassing at this point if you weren’t.”
John slams the back door closed and kicks the boot hard enough that the car rocks forward. He rounds the driver’s side, leans down menacingly into the window. His face is terrifying, hard and ferocious. All Sherlock can do is gape at the change from the boy in the alley. “I’m counting down to one before I pull you out of that car and beat you unconscious. Three...two…”
"Oh, god, baby. I had no idea - no idea - what this would do to you. Look at you." John brushed his knuckles gently down the side of Sherlock's face, blue eyes filled with tenderness and lust in equal measures. His hands slipped down to Sherlock's chest, and he pushed his dressing gown apart slowly, eyes fixed on Sherlock's. He massaged up Sherlock's stomach, rubbed hard over his arse and up into the curve of his spine, peppered his neck with soft kisses, until Sherlock was boneless and swaying slightly. John passed a feather light touch over his cock and Sherlock gasped, pressed into John's touch, but he pulled his hand away and trailed his fingers over Sherlock's mouth. "So beautiful. Lay down,
The gravel crunched resoundingly under his boots, nostrils filling with the sharp tang of pine needles, the musty odor of damp earth. It was an utterly foreign smell, nothing like the countryside round London which was vaguely floral and assiduously maintained by human hands. These smells were much more primal. Unspoiled.
“Ta, yeah.” Deep breath in. It was always such a struggle to keep the anger from bubbling out. Some people deserved it. This waitress didn’t. Try and act like a human being, John. Just, at least occasionally.
John lets out a little gasp of surprise and Sherlock licks it away. Bites down on John’s lower lip while he’s busy wrapping his legs around his hips. John groans at the contact, reaches back and runs his palm down the outstretched length of Sherlock’s thigh, digs his fingers into the fleshy part of his arse and holds on.
John pauses, tucks the phone against his shoulder while he walks into the bedroom and pulls a chair over to the wardrobe. “I don’t mean to be ungrateful -”
Sex has always been unnerving. To have another person touch him, to breach the facade, to make him moan involuntarily, and whimper and beg, is vaguely frightening. Losing control of his body, of his emotions, is not something Sherlock's been able to do without fear, without regret. Not with John, though. John’s hands work magic, John’s hoarsely whispered endearments bring forth emotions in Sherlock he hadn’t even known he had, and it's comforting, enjoyable, welcome. It's right. John touching him somehow makes Sherlock more himself.
They hadn't formally named it until they were comfortable enough with the dynamic to categorise it as a dom/sub relationship. For the last six months, it had been fairly straightforward in that regard, a negotiation of exactly how much John was willing to dominate Sherlock in and out of the bedroom, and of what Sherlock needed from him to make him feel safe, loved. Last week however, their self-imposed rules had shifted to allow Sherlock a measure of domination and control that he had largely given up for the last half year or so, and if John was honest with himself, he was happier this way.
"Have to stay awake when you get home, eh? Eh?" Owen gave him a lascivious grin and elbowed him in his vaguely aching ribs.
Sherlock, certainly. Mostly Sherlock. Though they'd certainly struggled and fought for what they had. Mrs Hudson understood John intuitively, without him having to spell anything out for her, as did Greg. Greg probably knew John the best, after Sherlock. Greg understood because he was the same kind of man, deceptively uncomplicated. He and John had recognised each other for what they were immediately, bonded over it before they even really opened up to one another. Sherlock had occasional fits of jealousy over John’s closeness with Greg, but John would always laugh it away as he wrapped his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down to twine their tongues together.
Sherlock rubs his cheek against the side of John's cock, velvet smooth heat and wet at the slit. Sherlock will have to wear a condom; he's a junkie, he's had sex with god knows how many people, he'll have to be tested for months before they know if it's safe or not, he knows that. But John doesn't. John he can taste, he can lick his bare skin, taste his come on his tongue. Just the thought of that twists hot and delicious down through Sherlock's belly, and his hips twitch forward automatically, dragging the tip of his cock against John's leg.
You buried your face in my shoulder when you came, whimpering and shaking, your hands pressing mine hard into the rumpled sheets. I kissed the side of your face and you murmured my name like you were praying. You laid there, all the evidence of my desperate need for you drying sticky between our bellies, until your breath slowed and your shoulders stopped heaving.
“For now. Don’t miss that package.” The man slid smoothly out of the bench seat. “I’ll be in touch.”
John pulls a pliant Sherlock up the steps to 221B, and they fall against each other in the hallway, hands tugging at shirt hems, fumbling at reluctant shirt buttons, the desperation between them sublimely beautiful. John’s body is amorphous, melding into Sherlock’s, sinking into his skin, filling the spaces between his bones. He can’t tell whose fingers are undoing his belt, shimmying his jeans over his hips. He can feel Sherlock’s heart beating in his own chest.
“Yeah, shut it. Brat.” She smiles and punches his arm lightly, affectionately. Harry points at Sherlock and winks, shakes two long orange plaits back over her shoulders. “Hiya, Sherlock.”
John's hand sticky and warm and perfect on his hip. John's back sweaty against his belly. John pale and far too still on a stretcher.
He swept his phone off the chair and walked into the bedroom. Laid out on a breakfast tray on the bedside table were two surgical scalpels, two vials with red rubber caps, several syringes, lilac coloured latex gloves, and various bandages and medical tape, all nicked from work over the course of the week. The bed was stripped of its normal high thread count sheets that Sherlock insisted upon, instead covered with plain tan sheets that used to be John’s, when they slept in separate beds. They would be making a hell of a mess of themselves and the bed in here tonight, if all went according to plan.
John leaned back into the sofa and squirmed, a tremulous little hum in the back of his throat. His eyes fell shut and he sighed. "Too tired, baby. I'm knackered. Right to sleep I go."
Now, he wanted to pound this little shit’s face in. But they apparently worked for the same man. So that option was probably off the table.
I laughed, and swiveled my head in order to press a kiss to his blushing cheek. “I believe I shall have to go away more often if this is to be my reception upon my return.”
“Oh god, Sherlock, oh god…” John’s arm moves up and back as he touches himself, his body curls inward, shaking.
, want to - touch you - ” Sherlock mutters, most of the words lost on John’s tongue, and works a hand in between them.
Sherlock swats at John’s arse as he turns to go into the kitchen. “You like it when I boss you around. I’ve been bossing you around for three decades now, and yet
“Oh, sweetheart. My wonderful, perfect, beautiful Sherlock.” John pulls back, presses a hard closed-mouth kiss to the lovely curve of Sherlock’s upper lip. “I’m sorry I had even a second of doubt. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
The cab came to squealing stop outside a grubby looking flat motel, squat and green. The paint was peeling, windows dirty. Cars in the U-shaped car park were old and rusty and abused. There was a homeless person asleep in a blanketed lump on the bus stop bench out front.
John’s face softens, just for a moment. He opens his mouth and shuts it again. His fingers tighten around Sherlock’s wrist, hard enough he can feel the bones moving. It makes him bend over, as his arm automatically retracts, trying to pull away from the pain. John releases him abruptly.“I don’t believe you. I don’t think you can help it.”
A painful lump rose up in Sherlock’s throat. The motive behind this one gesture, the realisation that John some simple reminder of how they were before everything went to hell, touched a place in Sherlock he wasn’t even sure he’d known existed a few moments before. He felt gutted. He swallowed through it and knelt at the side of the bed, still holding John’s hand. He looked up into John’s face, so tired and bruised, but smiling. “It’s not stupid.”
“Would there be matches?” Sherlock looked down at his own barely eaten dinner and tried not to look too interested.
"I don't get close to people. What Jim said, he's right. I don't have friends." The room is so cool, air conditioning pumping down through a dusty vent right above the bunk. There's a long tangle of dust and hair flapping against the ceiling; Sherlock fixes his eyes on it.
Every instinct in his body, in his mind is screaming at him to wrap his arms around John's neck and hold on. To kiss him tender and long, until their lips are raw. To stroke his fingertips down John's strong arms, put his mouth against his freshly washed hair and breathe deep.
“Thought you’d like it, knowing I was preparing for you all evening, eating my dinner, and reading some god awful novel while I -
Sherlock keeps groaning and moving, his fingers playing with John's hair and rubbing over the backs of his ears, and God, he's still hard, cock bouncing against his sticky belly as John pounds into him.
Lestrade rubs a hand over his face. John sinks into his chair, elbows on his knees with his chin in his hands. No one says anything. Sherlock's holding his breath.
He’s still feeling around the rumpled sheets when quiet and familiar footfalls sound in the hallway. The impending tears dissolve into a wash of relief, his entire body feeling suddenly and impossibly lighter.
Sherlock's breathing as hard as John is, though he's been sitting there silently. He's still staring at the fireplace. That's alright, that's fine. It would be harder, probably impossible, to say these things with Sherlock's beautiful perfect intense eyes boring into him.
. You." John yanks on his hair again, presses his hips against Sherlock's thigh. He jerks and shudders, rocks against him again, says in a voice low and rough, "I want to fuck you."
It's as though all the air has left the room. Sherlock can't breathe. He stares at Mycroft, and then past him at the blackened yellow bricks of the chimney, and shakes his head.
“Yes.” Sherlock loves kneading the dough, the feeling of it between his fingers, of it coming together under his hands.
"No, you're right. It's not my place to interfere with your brain work. I overstepped, and I fucked up the case. It was bollocks of me. Shit, I'm embarrassed as hell about it, Sherlock."
Sherlock can't take his eyes off of him. Tiny, blonde, boyish - not even his type, really. Usually his attention is caught by dark hooded eyes and skinny jeans, a leather jacket draped over wiry shoulders, a cigarette dangling from full pouting lips. Solitary and sulking is generally the base criteria for identifying a potentially good shag. He's self aware enough to realise his tastes in men run toward the narcissistic, and he’s fine with it, fine with fucking pretty dark haired boys with daddy issues.
“I know that.” Sherlock rubs his toes against the sole of John’s foot and wills away the tears in his throat.
These were the songs I was listening to writing this. They might be good soundtracks for reading it, too.
helpless hiccuping noises every time John rolls his hips, pushes in a little more and a little more. He wants to sound sensual, not like an overgrown pigeon. But he can’t stop himself, and John doesn't seem to notice. In fact, he's staring into Sherlock's eyes with something that can’t be described as anything but adoration.
He shoved his wallet and phone in his pockets, and opened the door. Sunlight sliced through the dim room, dust and god only knew what else floating through the air. The light fell on his dirty trousers draped over a chair. The lump in the pocket.
Sherlock’s desire surges at the look on John's face, the sound of his arousal-roughened syllables. He's never wanted anything in his entire life as much as he wants John Watson right now. He wants him in his mouth, in his arse, between his legs, inside every secret place no one’s ever touched him before this morning. He wants his beautifully dexterous short fingers, the hard length of that perfect cock, John's tongue leaving trails of saliva all over him - anything,
