“I never thought I’d find you,” Michael sighed, his hands stroking over his Castiel’s arms through the sodden robes. “Clarence,” he said, again and Castiel debated telling him what his real name was, they were true mates, he needed to know. It was on the very tip of his tongue when Michael cupped his face gently and said in a very small voice, “I can’t claim you.”
The man who had terrorised the merchants of the Caribbean had no business looking as adorably nervous as he did when he thought Castiel might not want to have dinner with him. They had had dinner together every day since Castiel had come aboard, save for the two days where Castiel had shut himself away. But that had been a matter of necessity, something they had shared in the mess or on deck, it had never been something private between the two of them.
It may have had little practical application, but Castiel
Considering the thing - a spriggan Sam had called it - had managed to rack up such a body count it had been surprisingly easy to kill. Dean hadn't even gotten a scratch. He'd hurt himself more when he'd tripped over the step into the motel room after they'd gotten back.
“Nothing,” Dean muttered.
But Cas is kissing him. Cas’ lips are soft and a little dry and the taste of mint toothpaste lingers a little but he is kissing him. And Dean is kissing him back. He didn’t even notice he was doing it. His brain is still offline though his heart has jumpstarted itself and is now hammering its way to a coronary episode.
” he shouted, dramatically, revealing what looked like an ear of corn. Dean narrowed his eyes, trying to see what was wrong with it. It seemed alright, the right colour, not misshapen, but there must have been something.
“Wait...you’re going to do it here?” Dean asked, gesturing to their decrepit surroundings. “Won’t that tip our hand? If he gets loose or if he won’t go along with it then they’ll know where we are.”
“That’s why you have family around you to help. Will you let me help you?”
Another hesitation, but whatever it was he was about to admit could hardly compound his crimes. “I have an arrangement with a demon.”
Dean rose from the table and reached over to the counter, picking up a cloth to wipe the partially chewed soup from his face. “Sam,” he sighed again, hating the way his brother tensed at the tone. It was an old conversation, but it would not be the last time they rehashed it. “You gotta be more careful.”
“Captain Novak isn’t it?” Roman asked, forcing Castiel’s eyes open. The man was leaning in to shake his hand, to refuse it would be a snub so he accepted it, relaxing into the most unimpressed posture he could manage. “So glad you could find yourself an invitation.”
“We’re close,” Meg said, coming to a stop in front of what looked like a ruined store. She looked it over and turned to Sam, “What d’you think?”
“We’re here,” Cas soothed. “You’re going to be okay but you need to put Dean under so he can help you get better.”
Dean had no answer. There could be no answer, nothing beyond the desperate moans that told them both Castiel had discovered a kink Dean had until this moment not known he had.
Beside him, Sam snorted, “That’s putting it kindly.”
in return.
In hindsight, he should have picked somewhere more comfortable to spend his last night as a free man. Though, as a prince, whether he had ever been
“Stay with me?” Dean asks and Cas gives a little scoff.
. He would not have known he was capable of such a thing and the first night had seen him practically throw himself from the bed in the morning, babbling about how they could possibly have been at the Citadel overnight. But, Dean had been laughing and coaxed him back to bed with soft kisses and soothing words, assuring him everything was alright. Ever since, Castiel had dreamt of kissing Dean somewhere in the sun.
Cas frowns before he finally says, “You can’t sleep here, Dean.” Dean looks up, alarmed even though he knows Cas wouldn’t throw him out, let alone at a time like this. Cas holds his hands out gesturing to the couch. “This couch is way too small for you.”
“Hm, I hope not.” Dean brushed away imaginary wrinkles from Castiel’s coat. He stepped back to make sure Castiel looked presentable, though Castiel knew that there was no disguising the flush in his cheek or the haze of bliss that surrounded him. Dean lifted Castiel’s hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles, “At least, not before you give me your answer.”
“Hello,” Castiel smiled, seeing no reason to further stress them out by bringing up whatever it was they had been talking about. “I assume you’re here to escort me to the ceremony?”
There was a man standing on the sidewalk just in front of the right-hand window seat of Dean’s coffee shop. From his view at the shop’s counter, Dean could see that he was tall, had hair that looked like the guy had run his hand through it every few minutes since he’d gotten up and he definitely hadn’t been there a moment ago. Dean had been taking advantage of the usual post-lunch lull in customers to clean the machines. Doing so gave him a clear view out of the front windows onto the side-walk and granted, he hadn’t been paying particular attention to the passers-by but he was fairly sure he would have noticed the guy in the tan trench coat come to a stop, from behind Dean liked what he saw. As it was, he hadn’t seen anything and was starting to wonder how the guy could have appeared from thin air when his brother’s voice called his attention away.
The flush of pleasure that warmed Dean from the core whenever he heard anyone refer to Cas as his husband was not enough to stop the fury from rising within him and he was on the very edge of doing something he would very much regret when the door opened from the other side and Cas stepped forward to hold him.
“Uch, gross Dean, real gross,” Sam groaned, catching onto what he was implying, “I seriously don’t need to know any more than I already do about your sex life.”
all you could muster to welcome us?” he said. He was right though, he wasn’t usually one to stand on ceremony, but from the tightness of his features, Dean knew he was just looking for a reason to lash out.
Castiel stepped back and cupped Dean’s face in his hands, tilting his chin so they could look into each other’s eyes. Castiel’s were streaked with tears too, but he was smiling. Dean leaned in and kissed him, it was desperate, wet and it didn’t take away from the tension between them in the slightest. But it was a kiss and there would be more of them. There would be a lifetime of them. That thought alone was enough to have them kissing again, pulling each other impossibly closer until they broke apart, breathless, panting and...laughing.
So instead, they kept walking, though it was a little depressing not knowing where they were heading. In his mind, Dean turned over their options which were dismally limited. They could make for another sector, that would seem to be the most obvious place to go, though they may want to try for one much further out. Long-range communication wasn’t exactly commonplace between any kind of settlements, but they might want to move beyond the potential of rumours following them. As newcomers, they would be treated with a natural suspicion but if anyone were to get wind of their journeys across The Fringes there would be questions for sure.
“Oh...Sam,” Castiel said, softly, when Sam realised that it was too late, turning frightened eyes towards the angel. “Sam, what have you done?”
Dean heard himself make an affirmative ‘hm’ that he hadn’t intended to voice but anything more trailed off when he realised Sam was looking at him. Sam was looking at him with
Cas couldn't meet their eyes, his gaze firmly fixed on a floor stain. Was that grease? Probably grease. Probably Dean’s doing actually.
Queen Mary was waiting to greet them at the great hall, having not been allowed to attend the wedding out of some archaic custom that everyone agreed was outdated but nobody had actually overturned. Still, she held the traditional honour of hosting the feast, probably the finest the kingdom had ever and would ever see as it celebrated a marriage, a coronation and the day of Wintertide all at once.
“Sam! You can’t! You’ve already been out three times this week, you need to rest.”
Castiel sighed but he was being unreasonable, Michael didn’t know…
This time Cas’ eye roll was dramatic enough to reach the shortlist for several Academy awards, “and when I ‘
He had the decency to look away when Dean flushed. Angelic orgasms he could get used to, but the idea that Cas,
There is not enough space.
“I love you,” Dean whispered. It seemed so insignificant and yet it was all he had.
,’ finding a strange affection blooming in his chest. It seemed like they were on the same page at least, but there was a tinge of melancholy to the realisation that all Dean wanted to do was find Clarence and tell him about Castiel’s offer. He could practically hear Clarence trying to hide a smile and saying, “I told you it would be fine,” but then he remembered that he hadn’t been entirely truthful with Clarence and he’d probably be more distracted to learn that Dean was a prince. That his name was Dean.
Weirdly, the king didn’t seem to mind that Cas had been flaying him alive with his tongue alone just a second ago. Weirdly, he was smiling. Dean noted it and if Cas hadn’t just collapsed in his arms he would have made a point to ask about it, but Sam was under Cas’ other arm, helping him up and Dean’s entire focus was on getting his mate inside, back to their chambers.
“That’s enough,” Castiel snapped before Meg could say whatever it was she had opened her mouth to say. Dean caught his eye, wanting to say something more, but instead Castiel nodded to the space behind them.
His husband.
seemed to pick up speed, as though she were personally invested in the outcome.
Castiel could do little more than stare at the man, and not just because he was gorgeous.
He allowed Dean to lead them from the temple, heading back towards the palace as the two of them waved, only a little awkwardly, to the crowds that had gathered to cheer them on. Unlike the assembled nobles, the crowds seemed thrilled that Dean and Castiel were getting on so well and when Castiel leaned in to kiss Dean on the cheek they went positively wild, screaming blessings at them and throwing camellias and peonies at their feet.
. But, it was them or his mate and there was no contest. He beckoned for Cas to move behind him as he drew the larger of the blades he’d brought with him. He readied it, his eyes fixed on the door as it rattled again.
Dean has always loved the way Cas refers to them as a
By the time Castiel returned to Benny’s side,
When Dean turned and caught black eyes staring back at him he was only a little disheartened. Demons were one of the hardest things Dean had ever had to kill, but it could still be done. Without even realising he’d reached for it, the blade that would do the job was in his hand. The demon didn’t seem particularly afraid, but then, they never did. They didn’t usually grin though and even at a distance, Dean could see the demon’s lips quirk into a malevolent smile.
He dropped Sam’s hand and walked over to the table. Without giving Sam a moment to protest, he threw the first bottle into the fire, watching the flames spark even though the bottle shattered and spilt liquid into them. He followed it with the next, and the next after that, until all the bottles were gone. The room smelled of demons and Sam looked ashen in the firelight, aware that his crutch had been taken from him. But they had made a start, Castiel thought, as the screams only he could hear from the fireplace grew mercifully quieter.
Folding his arms, Dean fixed him with what he hoped was his most glaring glare. “You’re not filling me with confidence right now.”
Neither of the cots in Dean’s cabin were big enough for the both of them to share, but that hadn’t stopped them. Tensioned had simmered between them, both of them knowing exactly what was about to happen, neither of them shying away from it. There was still food on Dean’s plate when Castiel had stepped towards him, laying his fork aside while Dean watched him, a small smile playing on his lips. They had looked at each other for what felt like a far longer time than it actually was, Castiel had given Dean every opportunity to move away. Naturally, he didn’t.
It’d probably be fine. But...their dad hadn’t been so…
And then, in barely more than a whisper, but no less assured for it, he heard Dean murmur, “Stay with me.”
“Taking?”
Evening had drawn in. The sun was low in the sky casting a red glow about everything and yet the city didn’t seem to be showing any signs of quieting for the night. In fact, some stalls seemed to be opening for the night in anticipation of the night's revelry; a combination of the season and the wedding of the Winchester prince. The air was still warm, the night chill hadn’t set in yet and on it danced a dozen aromas. There were nuts roasting over a firepit, spiced wine warming the soul of everyone who breathed it and over it all layers of woodsmoke as the torches were lit and fire bowls ignited, illuminating the streets.
“This is crazy,” Sam muttered under his breath for about the hundredth time in half as many minutes.
He broke into an insincere smile, “Welcome, I believe I’m having dinner with your brother tomorrow. Raphael is your senior I believe?”
Sam didn’t say anything.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Castiel said, resolutely, surprising both of them.
Cas raised his arms in a gesture of defeat. “She’s a djinn,” he offered. “That is their natural means of recovery...”
“There’s something...” he gestures to the pillow half afraid that something is going to jump out at them. Though whatever it is had felt disturbingly inanimate for a bed shaped like a heart. With a bravery Dean doesn’t expect, Cas reaches under the pillow and pulls out something shaped like an egg.
Dean scoffed and he wasn’t smiling anymore. Still, as he headed for the kitchen he still felt the warmth of his brother’s arms around him.
Dean led Cas back to the chair they’d been sitting in, unwilling to let him go too far from him even though he had no doubt his brothers were sincere. Well,
“I’m sorry Sam got hurt,” he sighed nuzzling into Dean’s shoulder. “However, I cannot promise I won’t rile an alpha up in the future just to see your reaction.”
Never in his wildest dreams had Cas looked so good beneath him. Even in the dim light Dean can see the sheen of sweat on his skin, the flush in his cheeks, the way he tries to keep his eyes on Dean but the sheer bliss of it forces them shut.
He pulled out and headed back for the bunker, the house already forgotten.
"Cash or credit?" the girl at the checkout interrupted, looking between the three of them with nothing short of mild horror.
“Alright, let’s stop here, we’ll carry on in the morning.”
Dean was always the first to say that he loved Castiel’s voice and at first Castiel hadn’t understood it. But then Dean would speak, low and hushed, right beside his ear as his lips ghosted over his neck and Castiel found he understood quite well after all.
“A thing accursed in the sight of God and man,” Dean said, along with the crowd.
Cas was free.
“Oh...” Cas stumbled for a moment unsure quite how to react.
He hated the way Cas had gotten out of the car which meant Dean had to get out of the car and had gotten drenched in a matter of seconds. That was to say nothing of the way Cas had insisted they take the dog...wolf...
“We’re-” Cas started, but then looked down at himself, in utter disbelief.
He sounds...disappointed. More than that, he sounds crushed. His voice is barely a whisper and he folds himself into the blankets as though he could make himself smaller.
He grinned, almost smug, but the smile that passed between them was unmistakeably fond.
“Well, it’s not like there’s a war on anymore,” Dean said with a smile. “Dad can’t ship you off to the front lines and pretend you don’t exist.”
Castiel quirked an eyebrow, “Do you know any other angels?”
The boat came to rest gently in the water and instinctively, Castiel moved to help loosen the ropes, even though he had long had a coxswain to do this kind of thing for him. Dean rigged up a short sail while Sam prepared the oars for when they’d inevitably have to make for land under their own strength.
“I have your second and third lieutenants’ written report as to what occurred between yourself and Mister Ishim aboard
Cas didn’t seem in the least bit surprised by the news. “That makes sense. Angels stopped caring about such distinctions long before the humans even conceived the written word.”
Dean gave up, even though Castiel wasn’t entirely sure how long his own resolve could hold out. The threat of Adam coming in upon them should have been deterrent enough though.
He hesitated on the threshold of Sam’s main chamber, noticing in the dim lights of the hallway that there was more light than he’d expect from a sleeping man seeping under the door. He sighed and rapped the door, gently.
Cas’ chest is firm beneath his touch, his lips, and he takes a long while to explore those hips that have begged to be explored every time Cas’ shirt has ridden up. He feels like he could cut himself on them but that doesn’t stop Dean diving in, letting Cas chase his touch. He wants to know everything Cas likes. Everything that drives him crazy. But it might take a while. Right now Cas is mad for his touch, pulling him close and reaching for him with Dean’s name falling from his lips.
An idea struck him.
Alfie. Castiel was looking up into the face of the most beautiful man he’d ever seen, with eyes so green Castiel could taste apples. His lips were moving, but it took Castiel a few moments to realise that the man was actually speaking, speaking to him no less, but the words washed over him as insubstantial as air.
Totally ridiculous.
, all you ever had to do was ask.”
Dean practically threw himself across the deck, throwing his arms around him, feeling the moment Sam let go and Cas let himself rest against Dean.
Castiel thought for a moment. He needed to get out of the city, but it was still very busy and he didn’t entirely know where he was. He was hungry too. And...he glanced up, catching Michael’s eye, there was something appealing at spending a little more time with the dashing young man before him.
“Are you hurt, Sam?” Cas asked and it was probably Dean’s imagination but he could have sworn there was an edge to the question.
“I...I don’t...Thank you,” Cas managed to say.
He must have been sitting awkwardly or misjudged the angle at which he rose, for as soon as Castiel straightened and took his first step away from the bed, he swayed, momentarily unbalanced though he couldn’t say why. He paused, considering himself, but he felt fine and his wings were not out of alignment. There was no harm done so he shook it off and slipped from the room, only a little surprised to find Adam still up.
Dean is still on the phone but he looks around the room and gives Castiel a thumbs up to confirm he can’t see anything out of place either. Castiel opens the door, slips off the ‘no service’ hanger and starts with the suitcase towards the car park. He knows Sam will be able to see him on the cameras so he forces his face into a scowl. To Sam, he’ll look like him and Dean have finally snapped, unable to occupy the same space for a moment longer. To everyone else he’ll just look like the honeymoon period has worn off.
Castiel pinched his lip between his teeth hard enough to taste the copper tang of blood. Maybe he should have taken Crowley up on his offer after all.
,” he said, his breath ghosting over Castiel’s lips.
He hadn’t gotten around to checking all of them out, but he’d taken a handful of them out for a spin. Nothing too strenuous, just around the broken roads that surrounded the bunker, mostly trying to get to grips with how to drive them. There were several manuals to be found among the very many shelves in the bunker and between Dean, Jesse and Cesar they had all managed to figure out the basics, though all of them had benefited from the practical experience of actually taking them out into the world. They’d even learned some basic repairs to varying degrees of success.
“Let me,” he breathed, holding his hand over the wound and trying to use what grace he could to bind the flesh together. Dean hadn’t known he could heal monsters and when Cas drew his hand away it was clear that he couldn’t. The stab wound had been reduced to a vicious gash, one that could be dealt with with greater ease than Dean had managed with his flannel. But Queenie was still struggling to breathe, a trickle of blood forming at the corner of her lips.
“Cas, that’s enough,” Sam called, quickly, but it wasn’t necessary.
Cas rolled his eyes, only a little but it was still enough to piss Dean off even more than he already seemed to be. “You can’t. I’ll be fine, I’m sure you’ll understand why I won’t be able to maintain contact for some time.”
Somehow they managed to make it back to Dean’s bedchamber.
Cas smiled a small smile. “Adam too.”
Licking his lips, Castiel pondered the flavour. It was...nice? Yes, it was nice. He liked it. He did not require it, but he liked it. The liquid was hot and bitter but tempered by the addition of cream. That was all the thought Castiel allowed it before he returned his attention to the space in front of the shop in which he now sat. The space where millenia ago he and his brothers had promised to meet.
Unsurprisingly, Dean glared at him, unimpressed. “Sam,” he sighed, his tone bordering on a warning.
still moved with them.
The sheaf of papers in Zachariah’s hands slammed against the table, but Castiel remained unfazed, keeping his expression deliberately neutral. Eyes front, chin up, he’d endured worse from far more trying people than what he was about to suffer under Zachariah.
“We knew this was coming,” Cas whispers and Dean is convinced he’s going to cry.
“They haven’t!” the reply came, barely audible over the din of the guns. Castiel doubted there was anybody left alive on the deck to strike.
“Captain Novak,” Roman’s second called, “You may return fire at will.”
With a roll of his eyes, Castiel straightened his uniform, “It seems the Admiral does not appreciate the reputation of his friends impugned.”
Cas is right about one thing though; the bed is surprisingly comfortable even if it curves a little, forcing Dean’s body to lean into Cas. Cas leans towards him in kind but there is still enough space between them to protect their modesty.
With a small shrug, Cas sighed. “While you were talking to Sam, Rowena made me one of the teas to calm me. After your display of dominance, I was ready to rip Sam’s head off for distracting you.”
“He can’t…he can’t do this.”
Dean nodded and once again looked at Castiel, almost willing him to stay close with a glance alone. Castiel frowned but followed obediently as Dean crossed the deck to where Crowley was getting ready to return to his own ship.
“What was the plan anyway?” Sam asked.
Adam’s enthusiasm was evident from his smile alone and he seemed barely able to contain his glee. The sight of it alone was enough to make Castiel smile; the way Adam looked so thrilled and the way Sam and Dean smiled indulgently was infectious.
Outside, the valet asks if he can bring the car around, but Castiel doesn’t let anyone drive his car. He knows Dean doesn’t either but in Castiel’s case it’s purely because his car has been augmented with several
“Tragic,” Balthazar said, as though it were the least tragic thing he could think of. “So, you’re going to Roman’s banquet and what, run him through?”
“So impatient,” Castiel whispers but he can’t help but indulge.
He had expected nothing to be able to lift his spirits and certainly nothing had so far, but his heart couldn’t help but swell when Kingston came into sight for the first time and his eyes fell upon the unmistakable shape of
It was an easy promise to make now that Hell was sealed but Cas’ eyes bored into him and Dean realised that he had to mean it. It took him a moment to think on it but Cas was patient. His touch was grounding and Dean sighed. “Okay, Cas. From now on it’s just the two of us.”
The same bell that had rung to signal the start of the wedding vigil rang out again at first light to announce the dawn. Benny rapped at the door to wake Dean up, but he did not come in. If he had he would have found Dean long awake and his bed untouched from the night before. Dean himself was sitting at his writing desk, something that had sat in his chambers as purely a nod to his role as prince than because he chose to write. In fact, this was probably the first letter he had ever written at it. He folded it, unfolded it and then folded it again, debating whether or not he was actually going have it passed on.
“I’ll be coming out later,” Sam told them, “It’s easier at night, though you wouldn’t think it,” he glanced up at the sky above them, scorched with black smoke and smog and scoffed, “Not that you’d even know it’s night.”
Thankfully, his hand stilled just as Dean called out to his brother, throwing his arms around him, letting Sam slump into the embrace. In hindsight, a demon was unlikely to be escorted to the main hall, unbound, flanked by officers of the royal guard. Castiel approached, a little more cautiously than he’d intended, but then he had been taken by surprise. He could hear Dean speaking quietly, his hands holding onto his brother’s shoulders tightly, while the not-demon muttered a response, beyond Castiel’s hearing.
“You think Raphael will help you? He’s sailing here under my orders, if I order him to surrender the report he will.”
A tense silence settled over them all and Dean found himself reaching for Cas even though they were already as close as they physically could be. “I won’t let them take you.”
This was okay. Cas had always said Sam would be supportive and-
“Okay, okay, Cas,” Dean said, leaning forward to leave a small kiss on his mate’s forehead. “Shall I send for the doctor?”
“Lead on,” Dean said, smiling at how happy such a simple request made his brother, who practically ran ahead of them.
It didn’t feel like home though and with a sigh, he pulled a blank sheet of paper towards him and started ordering his thoughts.
Cas fell against Dean, panting heavily against his neck, neither of them particularly caring about the mess they’d made of each other, or that in falling into it, Cas had only spread it further across their abdomens. Dean’s hands trailed along Cas’ back, soothing gentle patterns across it as Cas kissed his jaw, his neck, the shell of his ear.
But Cas isn’t deterred. “What if I want to change things?”
. This is Cas’ wife we’re talking about. She’s obviously got an interest in finding him.”
When Dean pulls back, Cas’ eyes are still closed as though he’s savouring the feel of Dean’s lips against his. Eventually, he opens his eyes and touches Dean’s cheek reverently. “I’ll always be here to watch over you. Of course I’ll stay.”
Stepping away from Sam, Dean moved to stand protectively beside his mate. “I swear, if you’ve brought anyone-” he started, but he wasn’t sure how the threat was going to end. Would he hurt his brother? He didn’t want to, but...Cas…the baby...
“A fake knot?” Cas asked, again with the head tilt, “I don’t understand.”
In response, Castiel tried to press himself flush against Dean’s chest which was practically impossible given how large his bump was. But despite Dean’s words he still felt the need to cross the additional distance between them and press their lips together again.
Dean rolled his eyes, but didn’t say anything. His brother wasn’t wrong. It
“Oh, Cas,” Dean said warmly as Castiel put the tray down in front of him, “What did I do to deserve you, huh?”
In truth, Castiel had not mentioned Adam’s contributions to Dean, but that was only because he had not prepared for Dean to agree so readily and easily before he had the chance to. Not that Dean would argue against praising his brother. And Adam looked so proud of himself, Castiel allowed himself the smallest of falsehoods. Dean trusted Castiel and Adam had helped, therefore Dean trusted Adam, whether he had voiced it or not.
Dean left his side to talk to his mother, but Castiel barely noticed, looking around the hall with undisguised awe. He knew living at the palace would be a far grander affair than he was used to back home, but even so, the great hall took his breath away. At least three times the size of the Comtissa’s hall, Queen Mary had managed to make the place look elegant when it could so easily have looked garish. The silvers and blues of the Novaks contrasted beautifully with the red and gold of the Winchesters, having the added effect of looking appropriately seasonable, even if it was purely coincidental. Castiel was admiring the table candles, bound in wreaths of winter greens and fire berries, positively glowing by the light of the flames when he heard his name mentioned.
“We’re not staying, Samuel,” Rowena announced, “Castiel was telling me that the thrones are after you,” she said, turning to Dean. “Luckily for you, they’re the weakest and the most easily fooled, I’m sure I can devise a spell to lure them away from here. Make them think Castiel is on the other side of the state at least. That should give you some breathing room while you claim him.”
must have had a vendetta against the merchants of the Caribbean given the frequency and intensity of the attacks. Even so, it was a great deal of effort for just one ship.
Dean puts it out of his mind and tries to focus on getting comfortable instead, which is easier said than done. Cas was right; the couch is way too small for Dean. He tries to lie flat, resting his legs over the arm of the chair, but they come up too high to be comfortable and his circulation protests almost immediately. So, he tries the reverse but that just means he’s more likely to break his neck than lose feeling in his legs.
“Cas,” Dean moans, finally letting his hands roam lower and palming his impressive length through the fabric of the boxers. It twitches against his palm and more than anything Dean wants to taste it.
Dean had come back to him, as he had promised, filthy and covered in blood, but it was not his own and he was relatively uninjured. He went out twice more that same day. And again the day after.
“Now,” Dean said, tapping Sam on the shoulder.
Dean took a breath, a huge gasping thing and looked down on Cas, their hands still locked together so tightly Dean wondered if they’d have to be physically prised apart.
Cas had wanted to ask what the point was, but she had already moved on and Sam just shrugged at him before they followed. Dean had wanted to go back and destroy the wardings, dig up the hex bags and kick the door down to their stupid hotel, possibly after putting up a sign saying ‘demons welcome’ and he’d been surprised when Meg had agreed fully. Cas talked them out of that, apparently, it would be inappropriate. Dean had grumbled but ultimately allowed himself to be dissuaded. No point putting his own life in danger even if he got to take those jackasses with him.
It was something of a surprise when Sam appeared later the same day Dean and Castiel had arrived and was nothing like Castiel had imagined. In fact, when Sam entered the room in which Dean and Castiel were waiting for him, Castiel’s hand immediately went to the blade at his belt, convinced a demon had found its way past the defensive fortifications.
“Your work is more than satisfactory, Adam, your brothers trust you.”
Dean’s hand was warm where it rested on Castiel’s shoulder. “He’s not going anywhere. He’s our prisoner and we’ll ransom him back when we’re ready to.”
Of course the bitter pill Dean had to swallow, the element that he and
I'm not doing so well health-wise at the moment so I've not been able to reply to comments on this for a couple of days but I still read them and really appreciate them ❤️❤️
“Okay, okay, get off me,” Dean grumbled, trying to sound annoyed when really he couldn’t help but be happy. “Bitch.”
“Of course you are,” Castiel said, dryly, “so you’ll have no trouble following my finger.”
“Told you we’d find them,” Adam said a little smugly, though he seemed as relieved as Sam.
Dean’s fingers twitched, reaching for a blade that wasn’t at his side any more. “Look, you may not give a crap about Cas, but we do, okay and-”
“It’s not going to bite, Cas,” Dean chuckles.
Still, one could not deny the slow buzz of anticipation that seemed to build across the deck as
He felt Dean smile back. “Perks of being the captain.”
There were planting boxes along one side of the house which Cas would grow herbs in. He already did what he could at the bunker but his efforts were hampered a little by the surrounding woodland that claimed most of the sunlight and almost all of the water. They’d be mostly herbs for hunts because old habits die hard but he’d grow stuff for the kitchen too.
The woman at the checkout didn’t bat an eyelid at their purchases even though Dean was fairly sure his face was so red it could set off every fire alarm on the block. Cas was similarly unfazed though he eyed the fake knots with something that was probably confusion. At least, Dean was happy to think it was confusion. He was not going to get drawn into what Cas might possibly be thinking about while staring at glorified sex toys, not in a public place at least.
“Shut the hell up, you’re not a part of this conversation.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean waved him off. “I’m sorry for the...” he gestured to the bruise starting to form where his fist had connected with his brother’s jaw. Sam rubbed at it but he clearly didn’t mind that much. “Why are you here?”
Castiel didn’t answer, squeezing the bloody rag over a bowl before helping Dean remove his shirt. Dean winced at the movement, but allowed it, realising that his shirt was ruined beyond saving. There were only a few cuts across his chest and a handful of small splinters that Castiel could easily deal with. Dean barely noticed him removing them, as he seemed to relive the battle in his mind, muttering about how unfair it was that Roman had a frigate. It didn’t take long, though Castiel wrapped a bandage around Dean’s head anyway. The larger of the cuts had stopped bleeding, but knowing Dean he’d likely open it doing something overly strenuous.
“As a hiding place for when your father comes.”
Deep down, Dean was surprised to realise, he wasn’t either.
The cabin had been built by Bobby a long time ago. Dean knew it was sturdy and he had never doubted Bobby’s construction abilities but the way the rolling thunder shook the beams made him wonder if they hadn’t been better seeking shelter in a motel. But then his eyes fell on Cas and he saw why such a thing was impossible.
Hearing such things was clearly a new experience for Dean and he flushed bright red, stumbling over a response, “Yeah well...your face is...everything...” he trailed off, but they both laughed anyway. Eventually, Dean sighed, “So, you go back to your uniform and I stay here...raiding uppity merchants and trying to rebuild.”
,” Castiel sighs, following him over the edge. He drops down, pressing his chest against Dean’s back, kissing the back of his neck, his shoulders, anywhere he can reach.
quarterdeck and find the man himself standing there, looking every bit as smug as he had in the Admiral’s office, totally apart from the flurry of movement around him.
“We’ll go on ahead,” Dean was saying, but not to Castiel, his attention on Benny who didn’t seemed thrilled that Castiel was going with the brothers. “We’ll scout the place out and figure the best way over. We’ll send up a shot if something goes wrong.” As though he sensed Benny’s unease he added, “We’ve done this a dozen times, it’ll be fine.”
“Probably just discussing our next moves,” Castiel sighed, quietly so that only Balthazar could hear him. Balthazar did not look convinced. “Set the mainsail there,” he said, a little louder this time, “We might as well make the most of this wind while we have it. Then send the hands to dinner, they’ll need it for when we catch up with her.”
It takes them far too much effort to wrangle the sheet onto the bed, trying to fold it around corners and curves no bed should ever have.
It didn't have to be, of course. If he told Cas he was going to pack it all in he couldn't imagine his husband actually minding. He could pull over right now and call the number on the sign. Sure, it wasn’t as easy as all that but this was a fleeting fantasy and reality played no part in it.
He didn’t look happy.
"Jerk." Sam let him go but he looked at Dean almost expectantly so Dean figured that he might as well get it over with. “So yeah...I’m with Cas and...y’know...not straight.”
Cas caught him and held him steady. “Dean? are you alright?” he asked, as though he hadn’t just disputed the doctrine that had been drilled into Dean and every other person since The Tribulation. The very reason anyone who deviated from “the Norm” was exiled or worse.
Dean grunted through a mouthful of food.
“Where am I?” Castiel asked, eventually.
Cas thought about it for a moment, closing his eyes in an attempt to figure out the changes in his body. “I think I’ll be alright,” he said, “But, for simplicity’s sake, maybe we should shower separately.”
His hands rested on Castiel for a moment longer, as though he were committing the sight to memory, before he nodded to Dean, looked one last time at Benny, and was then over the side, leaving them to it.
Sam and Cas exchanged a look, one in which Dean saw fear from his brother and reassurance from his mate. “Well, one of you tell me,” he ground out, unable to keep the frustration from his voice.
“Hey, it’s alright and thank you for your letter, it meant a lot,” Dean had just about managed to reign in the urge to ruffle Adam’s hair before he gave in and went for it anyway. “So, Adam, this is Cas,” he said, turning to introduce them, “Cas, this is Adam, my brother.”
“Dean-” Cas started, but Dean didn’t want to hear it.
The first mate was a charming man called Benny who began referring to Castiel as ‘brother’ within minutes of being introduced. And then there was Charlie, a fiery redhead in charge of navigation who claimed Castiel as her best friend when he pointed out an error on one of her maps. He’d expected her to be offended, but instead, she had thrown her arms around him and shouted emphatically that she had known there was something off on the charts. She’d asked Dean if they could keep him. It was all a far cry from the men who had all but torn Castiel’s boat cloak from him knowing that they would be able to sell the fabric.
The relief that Dean felt was palpable and the grin he gave made him look ten years younger. Castiel couldn’t help but smile back in the face of such radiance. He expected the hug, or at least the half hug that came when Dean threw his arm up to grip Castiel’s shoulder, he was not expecting the kiss that followed it. It was a swift thing but fierce and full of gratitude. He pulled back so quickly, Castiel didn’t get the chance to kiss him back, in fact, his brain had barely registered that he was being kissed before Dean turned away.
They’d gone out to see a movie and gotten some drinks afterwards. Too many drinks in hindsight. As usual, they’d gone back to Castiel’s flat which was generally closer to town than Dean’s place. As usual, Dean had grumbled about how lumpy Castiel’s couch was and Castiel had offered him the bed. As usual, they’d fallen on top of the bed, barely managing to make it under the covers after they’d clumsily stripped down to their boxers. As usual, Castiel woke up with Dean pressed to his back, though this time his arm was thrown across his chest, holding him close. And in a moment that was decidedly
“You feel so good, Cas,” Dean whispered against his lips, taking himself out so he could stroke them together.
Dean shrugged, “I guess. It doesn’t matter these days anyway, what little magic the royal family has left just goes on little things like,” he waved a hand at the fountain, “decorating.”
Clarence rolled his eyes, “I’m surprised you’d be this short-sighted,” he said, gruffly and Dean was sure his heart had stopped at how angry Clarence looked. But then there was the hint, just a hint of a grin and he said, “Don’t you think a people descended from ice elementals might be able to handle some ice-water?” Dean had a split second to realise what he was getting at, but it was a split second too late to dodge the splash Clarence aimed at him.
“Hm,” Cas sighed, happily, “And...did you kill your brother?”
Sometimes, at night, when Dean finally retired for the day, Castiel would hear him moving around the cabin, trying to make himself as small as possible in his own space, just so he wouldn’t disturb him. Sometimes, Dean would try and catch Castiel’s deliberately evasive eye. Sometimes, Castiel would hear Dean sigh, “C’mon Cas...” before he inevitably turned away. At least Castiel had stopped pretending that he was asleep whenever Dean entered the room. Instead, he would stare stoney-eyed at the ceiling, or turn himself to face the opposite wall. He had expected Dean to kick him out after a day of open antagonism, but he didn’t. He seemed as morbidly content to reach out and be rebuffed as Castiel was to lie on the bed wallowing in something between self-loathing and seething rage.
Rowena gave a hum that could have meant anything, but she let go of Dean’s arm, “Well,” she said, kindly, “It looks like you’ve gotten your head out of your pretty behind, so the hardest part would seem to be over. I’ll check him over, make sure everything is progressing as it should - and don’t make that face. I’m here to help!”
Adam laid the quill down and smiled. “I thought you would have gone to bed.”
. There was no need for him to exaggerate. But, actually, watching Castiel dig into it as though he had not seen food for days, Dean realised that he was being serious and he couldn’t help but grin.
It had probably been Cas.
“Do you think the Winchester Prince is celebrating?” Clarence asked, quietly.
“I don’t want you to love me like that,” Cas said but his touch was tender on Dean’s cheek. “Please. You’re my mate, the one who tamed me. I don’t ever want to be without you.”
railings, just looking.
“You’ll see,” Castiel replied, unwilling to voice it in case the walls could somehow overhear them. He had been right; they had arrived in the kitchens, there was no mistaking them as the busiest rooms in the fortress even compared to the barracks. There were serving girls and errand boys dashing around everywhere, weaving around each other as they somehow managed to discern their orders from the din of shouts from the cooks over the noise of the fires and another meal’s preparation. A hundred different smells clamoured for dominance on the air and Castiel tried to breathe through his mouth; he had never been sensitive to scents before, but then he had never been pregnant before.
would surely still be close by… he smirked, imagining Ishim’s face when he was told that instead of returning to the fleet they were going to help the same pirates they had been sent to apprehend.
“I don’t think we’ll need this,” Dean grinned, as Castiel looked across the threshold at what had clearly been intended to be his room.
“I...I love you too,” Cas frowned, “But I don’t see what-”
There’s a moment of silence before Cas begrudgingly admits, “it’s...surprisingly comfortable.”
His mate who was holding him tight, whispering assurances into his ear.
“I’m ready,” Cas begs. He surely isn’t. Dean is three fingers deep into him, marvelling at the way Cas takes him, wondering how he will possibly be able to survive the sight of him taking his cock. His fingers still but Cas doesn’t let him pause. “I want to feel you. Make me feel it.”
“We did it?”
“You look comfortable.”
“How you turned traitor, ordered us to sink
For the longest time, Castiel just stared at him, warring feelings within him. He was hurt and even more hurt by the implication he could ever find someone in his life that would be better suited to him than Dean. Dean. He had absolutely no intention whatsoever of finding himself a society wife who would look good on his arm at the admiral’s table. Ultimately he settled for, “You know there’s no such thing as the British Sea.”
Cas was looking between the three of them with visible confusion, his head cocked to the side slightly. “I’m an angel?” he suggested as though it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Sam rolled his eyes, "you've got fruit too, Dean, so you know it's not all bad."
glad I got to meet you. I was even before I realised you were my mate.” He sighed, heavily, “Remember I said I had a family thing? I’m getting married, Clarence.” Castiel snapped his head up, wincing at both the movement and how close to home the words were hitting. “It wasn’t my choice, it’s an arranged marriage, but I’m not in a position to walk away.” Michael dropped his eyes, steeling himself for a moment, “That’s not true. I could walk away. It’d be hard and we’d probably have to run pretty far pretty fast. I’m not sure what kind of life I could give you, Clarence, but if I ran, it’d be my brother having to walk up the aisle and I want so much more for him.”
The man threw his hands up, “Honestly, we were as surprised as you are. We managed to lose you and when we went back for the boats we found you. Your head was pretty banged up from the fall, but you’re one lucky son of a bitch you know that?”
Castiel did not recognise the blank stare that looked back at him. Even if he hadn’t been too late to affect the decision, it was clear that Dean would never have changed his mind. The boom of the cannons was shortly followed by the unmistakeable explosions of a ship falling apart. Dean stepped away from Castiel, already calling for them to resume their course. Castiel opened his mouth to speak again, wanting to remind Dean that they had a duty to pick up survivors. But he couldn’t form the words.
Dawn found them clinging to each other, as they had all night. Castiel hadn’t slept much, but Dean thankfully had drifted off though Castiel couldn’t say when it was. He still had no idea how
He smiled.
“Dean?” Sam prompted when both he and Cas had been quiet for too long. “You have a plan, right?”
“I’d rather not talk about any of it if you don’t mind.”
just before he decided to resign his commission. He’ll no doubt be hanged on sight if he ever shows his face near the Navy again, treason, dereliction of duty, murder, piracy and probably a hundred other articles, everything except sodomy, actually. Though...I’m sure he’ll remedy that soon enough.” Balthazar chuckled, slipping the watch back into his coat and turning to look back at where he’d come over.
There was another silence, in which Dean exchanged a meaningful look with Cas. “Well,” he sighed, “Sounds like a plan.”
Michael didn’t reply, not with words. Instead, he inched forward as he pulled Castiel towards him, kissing him with such tenderness Castiel felt his eyes burning again.
Sam looked at the shopping confused before he practically fell over as he tried to back away.
stared at them from the corner of the room which it seems to dominate.
“Castiel, that’s- How did you-?”
“Sure,” Benny said, his eyes still fixed on Castiel.
The blade had caught her in her side and, until now, he hadn’t appreciated just how much brighter a shade of red her blood was.
Dean looked around the room, his head already aching from the overlapping voices and raucous taunts.
Castiel shook his head, grinning from ear to ear, leaning in to kiss Dean again. And again.
afraid to come out to his brother. The whole ‘journey of self-discovery’ that had started with him realising he spent a little too long watching Doctor Sexy for non-medical reasons and ended with him comfortable enough to have a relationship with a man (but not tell his brother) hadn’t exactly been a fun roller coaster of love and acceptance. His old man had drummed into them both how wrong that kind of thing was and Lisa hadn’t exactly helped when she’d kicked Dean out of their white picket fence because he’d come out to her. She was fine with it, no really, totally fine but she couldn’t quite reconcile that him also finding men attractive didn’t change his feelings for her. It must, she’d insisted and Dean had been too new to it to argue. Not that he’d particularly wanted to. He’d left and figured that he’d tell Sam one day...probably when it became necessary. If things had worked out between him and Benny or him and Aaron maybe he would have but it hadn’t so he hadn’t.
There was another hesitation before the rustle returned as the assembled guests all bowed low before their new king and then, of course, the trumpeters engaged in yet another fanfare. Castiel caught Dean’s gaze and they both rolled their eyes, sharing a chuckle.
"I love you too, Cas," Dean whispered, his lips ghosting over the shell of Cas' ear. "C'mon let's go talk to our witness."
Beside him, Cas looked at a different grave. One closer to them. It wasn't recent but the flowers certainly were. Their petals moved gently in the wind - the only movement in the place beside the few mourners gathered ahead of them.
For a moment the only sound was the raggedness of their combined breathing before-
Any other courtier would never have allowed the surprise to show on their face, but Benny and Dean had known each other too long and too well to have such pretences between them. Benny tucked it into his pocket and gave a short bow, heading off to find the prince immediately. Dean watched him go before he closed the door and leaned against it, heavily. He couldn’t even remember what he’d written. But he'd gotten back and couldn’t stop thinking about what Clarence had said, about how the Novak prince would have been brought here with less say in the proceedings than Dean had had, away from his family, his homeland. So he’d put pen to paper, blabbering something about how welcome he was here and how in Dean he’d hopefully find a friendly spouse if not a loving one. It was the best he could offer. Now that the letter had left his hands he felt stupid for it, so when the knock came at the door he practically yanked it off its hinges in his haste to open it, grateful that Benny had no doubt realised that this was a monumentally bad idea.
“Alright. Let’s go say hi to my parents and then we’re coming back here and I’m going to keep you in bed until the baby is born.”
“It was mostly a matter of restraining him,” Cas said, dryly, which nonetheless made Dean’s heart constrict. He should have been there for his brother. The fact that Sam had chosen to shut him out would probably sting for longer than the fact that he’d turned to demon blood.
Thankfully, Michael was so concerned for Castiel, for
Just because every single one of his dreams is coming true in the form of the deliciously naked Cas laying himself out for Dean’s delectation is no reason to lose his head as well as his heart.
Castiel raised the glass and followed where Dean was pointing. There was a ship in the distance, flying Roman’s flag and making a damned poor show of turning from the pirates that had sighted them. They must have been caught by surprise.
“You will not,” Sam said just before Castiel or Dean could say it. Adam looked up at them all. Castiel decided to stay quiet – this fight had been going on for long before he came into their lives.
Castiel tapped the roof twice and let the carriage roll off, taking him back to
“We’ll beat to quarters if you please, Mister Ishim. A guinea for the gun crew that lands the first shot and another for the mainmast, I think.”
“Don’t say that,” Dean said, flatly, “Don’t say you’ll come back.”
Cas is kissing him.
Arching an eyebrow Sam regarded his brother, curiously, “Whatever you want. I figured we wouldn’t stay seeing as Cas and Meg will be there.”
“Coming up, Dean,” Castiel said and was rewarded, as he always was, with the warmest of Dean’s smiles.
had been, it felt heavy, too heavy. He wanted to lie down. “...the assist.”
Running his finger over the numbers one more time as though he might have mistaken them, he eventually looked up at Adam, who had started to look worried that he might have done something wrong. His expression softened a little when Castiel smiled at him. “I believe you may have something here which will allow us to be useful after all.”
“Must you be so crude?” Cas sighed.
Especially when they were lit by the soft smile on his lips as he lay against the damp grass, looking up at the bright sun as though there hadn’t been a storm just a moment ago.
“You sliced through your own mainsail?
“I may not have served in the human army but I was still a soldier, Dean.”
“Yes!
“Anything,” Cas breathes, pulling him back in for a kiss. “
“I’ll send it right away,” Adam grinned, but then it faltered when he saw Castiel’s hand resting on the doorknob, “Good luck,” he offered, grabbing a sheaf of paper and practically running into the halls with it.
“It’s not about that, okay?” Dean snapped, but there was a pause in which Castiel could practically hear Benny glaring. “It’s...it’s not just about that. Look, maybe he can do something, I dunno.”
The magistrate reached into the box, “
“What happened?” Sam asked. “What do you mean Dean banished you?”
Michael leaned his forehead against Castiel’s, so close Castiel could feel his breath on his lips.
It had been an easy thing for Dean to promise, that he would protect his mate and their child whatever may come. In practice, he wasn’t entirely sure what he could reasonably do. Where could they reasonably go? Their best bet was some small place beyond his father’s kingdom. Most of it had been devastated by Hell, but there were some pockets of civilisation that remained. They’d have to be careful though, Heaven would never stop looking for them, nor would Hell for that matter...actually...neither would his father but he at least had a finite lifespan. It wasn’t the most comforting of thoughts and it was probably a testament to how hopeless the situation was that the only sliver of hope Dean could hold out for was that one day his father would die and maybe Sam wouldn’t hunt them as mercilessly.
.” He even did the air quotes. Dean took the flowers and put them in the motel room’s sink. It wasn’t a good place to put them but it was all he had right now.
Dean laughed but didn’t need to think about it for long. “Sure, that sounds great. I’ll bring beer.”
“Say you get them to listen to you, say they shut Roman down,” Dean murmured against Castiel’s shoulder, so quietly that if they hadn’t been so close Castiel would surely not have heard it. “What will you do then?”
For what felt like a long time Dean stared down at his brothers, but Sam met his gaze openly. Eventually, Dean lowered his sword and the tension in the air broke. Everyone seemed to breathe out, even Cas relaxed beside him, finding his hand with his own and squeezing it reassuringly.
“Uh, yeah, that’s exactly right,” Sam stuttered, but Castiel didn’t mind when Dean was looking at him with such open pride.
Dean shrugged. “Not terrible. Dad’s mad as hell that we disappeared the way we did but he’s happy we sealed off Hell. Mom’s just happy we’re back.”
Which was ridiculous seeing as these were his usual clothes and he knew he looked good. Well, he’d never had any complaints. Plenty of compliments though. Given that he usually just made sure his clothes were free of monster gunk and he’d pick someone up with a winning smile and some of his better lines. Usually women but that was ‘coz he didn’t want Sam to see him with a guy.
The two of them lay in their bed, their bodies arched around the two additional bodies between them. Dean’s hand trailed patterns through Cas’ hair even as the two of them let their eyes linger on the perfect beings beside them.
Maybe he could.
. They found him in the surgeon’s bay with a woman, Eileen. Neither of them were doctors but they were apparently the closest that could be found aboard and looked ashamed at the fact, until Castiel assured them they were probably more qualified than the barber operating aboard the ship he'd fallen from. Dean had given him the most appreciative smile for that, not that Castiel noticed such things from a rival captain, and a pirate no less.
they’d be off the mission.
“Cas!” Dean breathed, dizzy with relief.
“No, sir. Sorry, sir. No we’re good, we’re-” Dean bites down a strangled cry, “
“What’ you got there?” Dean asked his brother, gesturing to the bag Sam had at his feet.
“It isn’t like this in Purgatory, is it?”
Dean and Castiel sat on a bench watching the small crowd gathered around a recently dug plot in the cemetery. The sheriff stood out as the only one in uniform rather than a black suit. Normally they wouldn't have spoken to him so soon after a funeral but whatever they were hunting had struck and killed every night that week and Dean didn't want it to strike again.
“Probably means they’re gonna strike on the spot,” Benny called out, but still Castiel wasn’t convinced.
Dean patted his arm and made to approach his parents, leaving Castiel with his brother who looked smug even by Gabriel’s standards.
Getting into the long-abandoned vehicle was a little harder than Dean had originally thought, however. The door was rusted to the point it was almost indistinguishable from the rest of the body, but Dean could just about make out the seam.
“But I’ve spoken to Gabriel-”
Dimly, Dean was aware that they’d gone, he could track the movement in his periphery, but his eyes were entirely on Castiel’s wings. Then they were gone, as quickly as they had come but with far less drama. He seemed to stumble a little and before he’d realised he’d done it, Dean had stepped forward to steady him.
Dean and Sam exchanged a glance, before Sam said, “Home,” but without any of the feeling sailors normally reserved for sighting land after so long away. Dean jumped out of the boat and pushed it onto the shore, pulling it to a cove on the beach where it couldn’t be seen openly.
Queenie had said-
“Its bloody slander is what it is, I won’t accept this.”
“Castiel Novak of The Seraph.”
would sail at dawn, so the duel had been scheduled for first light. Balthazar had returned after delivering the challenge to Roman with a face so grim Castiel might have already died. As suspected, Zachariah had tried to stop the proceedings but to no avail. Apparently, Crowley had been on hand to make a snide remark that Roman should listen to his Naval superiors, just to ensure there was no chance of him offering an apology.
"Gabriel,” he said, a world of exasperation condensed into one word.
Castiel recognised Dean’s attempt to school his features into something at least akin to innocence, but Sam had known him too long and too well. He folded his arms and glared at his brother. Dean was far from chastised. Castiel wanted to kiss him again.
“Oh, it’s the demonic equivalent of Gabriel’s horn.”
Together they peel the covers off the bed and Dean pushes the mass of cushions and pillows onto the floor. When he looks up, Cas is holding the bedsheet out in front of himself, almost comically trying to figure out how to best cover the awkwardly shaped mattress in front of them.
“Let’s,” Castiel said with faux innocence, as though he wasn’t doing everything he could to drive his husband wild without doing anything at all.
The best possible outcome for two newly married princes who had had no say in their choice of partner was that they would emerge from the side chapel with cordial smiles. In an absolute worst-case scenario they would discover that they hated each other’s scents and the marriage would be doomed from the start. They would emerge from the room scowling and it would be just a matter of time before they moved into separate wings or worse, separate palaces. Nobody could have predicted that the two princes would emerge arm in arm, beaming at each other. From the moment they stepped out, Castiel was aware of the hushed whispers that erupted around the room, but he wasn’t surprised.
, I mean...you know. Spending your last night in your chambers?”
“Wait,” Dean said, turning to face Cas, “You’re telling me, you tried to stop the
“It sounds like a plan to me. Better than anything else we’ve got,” Dean muttered. Cas didn’t say anything, but his eyes were bright and his hands tight around Dean’s.
“Dean,” Cas said, firmly, pulling away, so he could reach the towels.
“Don’t approach her, don’t risk it, deny everything even if she seems legit,” Sam said, dutifully and Dean ruffled his hair affectionately, it was part of the routine after all.
“What now?” Dean asked looking to Cas but not reassured by the look in his eyes. “Cas?”
“They’ll be here,” he said, with some certainty. It was impossible for an angel to break their word, after all.
“I’m...waiting for my brothers,” Castiel said, slowly. Nothing had changed.
“Hey Clarence,” Michael said, after a while, “you wanna check out the market? Maybe get something to eat?”
Cas nodded but the movement seemed stiff. “We did it.”
“The hell are you doing here, anyway?” Dean asked.
“If he gets loose or he won’t go along with it them knowing where we are will be the least of our problems,” Castiel said, grimly. He knew he wasn’t exactly assuring Dean, but then the situation had been hopeless from the start. Their plan was ridiculous, bordering on insanity having worked in several shades of impossible and yet… Castiel’s hand wandered of its own volition to his abdomen… It would work, he thought fiercely. Dean must have caught the drift of his thoughts for he looked up, determination flashing behind his eyes.
“Forgive me,” Castiel breathed, “I’m being ridiculous, everything about this is ridiculous. I don’t even know what I was thinking. Even if I could get back to my homeland it’s not like my family want me...”
, you know I have to.”
“Dean...”
“Give or take,” Cas said, unable to stop a smile from spreading across his lips, a definite twinkle in his eyes.
The roars, the screams, the horn and then a screech. A high pitch whine that drowned out everything else. Dean wanted to cover his ears but he couldn’t feel his arms to lift them.
“Dean,” Cas said again, firmer this time. “This is not your fault.”
“Fine,” Dean snapped, “But I don’t have to like it.”
Dean’s ears pricked when he heard the low rumble of an engine outside. Cas was still asleep but Dean froze, listening to the distinct sound of a car parking and doors slamming. Dean hadn’t brought his gun into this room,
After determining that Dean was sure, really sure, no, really
Eventually, Castiel sighed and whispered, “Wait here.”
“It helps, okay? You’ve seen what it’s like here. It’s constant and there’s only me...I didn’t mean for it to get out of hand but...it helps.”
“You could at least pretend to help, Gabriel,” Castiel sighed, after double-checking that the few customers that remained were satisfied.
He could see the relief in Sam when he breathed out. “Okay,” he sighed, “Alright. I don’t like it either, but-”
Dean reached up and placed a hand on his brother’s arm, gesturing to Castiel with the other. “Hey, Sam, meet Castiel, my mate.”
Not even the first spray of rain could dampen the ship’s spirits, even as they hastily took in sail, finally reduced to the crawl
“You’re amazing,” Dean said, again, leaning in for a kiss, even though they had an audience and Sam was clearly impatient to get underway.
“Looks like he’s running into some bad weather,” Balthazar said, beside him, his glass still looking out to where the other ship had yet to spy them. “Shouldn’t take us more than a few hours to catch up to her, less if our wind holds.”
“Cas-” Dean breathed, caught somewhere between terrified and amazed, “That was-”
“Dean,” he mumbles, bringing his other hand up to hold Dean’s shoulder, holding him tightly as though he fears Dean is about to disappear. As though this is still a dream.
“I don’t want you out there in the field, Cas,” Dean said, the moment the door to their chamber had closed behind them.
Since Sam had been old enough to talk about the friends in his head, Dean had been trying to ensure that he didn’t. Not out loud anyway, not with anyone except Dean. The Bible and Repentances said nothing specifically about Sam’s particular kind of...mutation? Talent? Deformity? Gift? Whatever it was to be called, Dean knew that it wouldn’t be tolerated. His brother would be ‘purified’ with the rest of the Blasphemies if he was discovered. Sam knew this of course, but he didn’t
“Good,” Dean grinned, “if it was just me looking out for you kids we’d all be dead.”
For all that he was being praised as the hero of the hour, Castiel kept himself to Dean’s cabin while
Cas’ hand reached up to cover Dean’s and for a moment they both seemed to revel in the warmth of the other’s touch. “Of course, Dean.”
“I thought you boys were only hitting Roman, how the hell did you end up with a navy captain?”
Even if Dean were to become Crowley’s plaything for the rest of eternity it would be worth it. Cas was safe. The baby was safe. Dean smiled even as he tasted blood on his tongue.
Dean’s body shook with silent laughter and the fingers curled into Castiel’s hair tightened a little. “No. I like
They’d never really been on a date though. Never a planned:
Dean wasn’t entirely sure how to react to that; to the story of the Old People that he didn’t completely understand or the way Cas’ voice had become soft and almost mournful. But, before he could stop himself he heard himself blurt out, “What was the world like?”
“I love you, Dean,” he said, suddenly, looking back just before his hand closed around the door handle. “I pray this won’t take long.”
“I tried to tell the Admiral,” Castiel sighed, drawing the tale to a close, “but he didn’t seem particularly interested.”
In fact, given that he still hadn’t even looked up, Dean took pity on the guy and went to make them some coffee. The real stuff that Dean would never admit to keeping back for the days that Cas came by. Benny knew of course and gave Dean a knowing wink as he took his mug from him. “Here you go, Cas,” Dean said, quietly, putting the cup down beside the man who looked up initially annoyed at the interruption, but his tired eyes softened when he saw the offering.
Castiel cocked his head and said again, “but, it’s my report, sir. You must accept it.”
Castiel took the bravado for what it was, nervousness and in a fluid movement discarded the hat and the coat. Dean seemed more comfortable for it, though he did look a little sad to see the coat go. He gestured for Castiel to take a seat and poured them both a healthy serving of whisky, which made Castiel chuckle. He could imagine his brother captains shocked at the notion of whisky with a meal instead of a watered-down wine.
looked. He saw the tiredness behind his eyes, the way his hair stuck up as though he’d run his fingers through it several times from frustration or worry, the way his wings seemed just a little closer to the ground, drooping a little as though they could sense their angel’s mood.
For his part, Dean hadn’t moved. He was aware that his mother was moving him, she’d pulled him into a hug and let him go before she patted Cas’ cheek affectionately, but Dean hadn’t moved. His body was frozen where it sat, though he could feel nothing of it. He had no sense of sensation, there was nothing, only profound shock. Until his eyes found Cas, who looked as shocked as he felt and they both forced out a laugh at the same time.
“You will be,” Cas murmured, which was funnier than it was sexy, so Dean elbowed him harshly in the ribs and they both laughed as they followed Dean’s oblivious brother.
Dean traced the words, ‘
“Yes, we. I know we’ve had our beef with Rowena, but she’s alright.” Dean hummed, noncommittally but Sam threw his hands up exasperated. “Anyway, what happened?” He looked over at Baby, his expression grim, “did the angels come for Cas?”
“What’s up?” Dean had asked, putting aside the coursebook he hadn’t been reading, seeing as he had a perfect view from his bed of Cas’ profile sitting at the desk, ostensibly doing his own work, even though Dean knew he didn’t have any assignments due.
“You son of a whore,” Roman growled.
A crowd had gathered two streets from Dean’s shelter, at the exact midpoint between home and work. If he’d been a few minutes earlier he could have carried on past them, but even though he picked up his pace to avoid them, the magistrate’s summons for ‘
“Cas, I’m not letting you put yourself in danger. You’re not going anywhere alone.”
“And what were you planning to eat, Dean?” Sam called, having the sense to announce his presence before either Cas or Dean noticed someone approaching.
The space was wide, open and looking up at something that might have been a screen once, but had cracked, fractured and mostly fallen down. Still, Dean wasn’t looking at that, he was looking at the cars. He’d read about such things and he’d even seen a couple with his dad one time. Apparently, they could transport you from one place to another, with distance only limited by how tired you were. The idea had always fascinated Dean, the notion that you could just drive away from somewhere, that you wouldn’t have to cross the Fringes, you could just
“About what comes next,” he added, meaningfully.
The rain had cleared and the sky was blue again but not as blue as Cas’ eyes.
Dean and Cas exchanged a grim look, the hopelessness of their situation which Dean had been attempting to hold at bay threatened to overtake them. They were on borrowed time and Dean knew it. He didn’t want to say it to Cas, didn’t want to worry him, but Cas knew. He had to. Everyone would be hunting them.
With a small huff of annoyance Castiel turned his attention back to the papers he had been consulting with Adam, deliberately ignoring his mate, even though he could still feel Dean’s eyes upon him. Beside him, Adam looked awkwardly between them before deciding to just stay quiet. Across the table Sam gave him a reassuring albeit a furtive smile, but Castiel ignored that too.
Queenie looked up to catch Dean’s eye, smiling at him as though she’d won an argument he was only vaguely aware they’d been having. He should say something but he settled for huffing a smile and turned his attention to the women on the rigs. One by one they slumped against him as he eased them down, disconnecting them from the various tubes the djinn had fed into them.
They tore through the crumbling streets, before Meg shouted, “This way!” and they all followed, without question. Not that there was time to question it even if they were inclined to. Dean saw something come into view, a building in surprisingly good condition in that it seemed to have all its walls intact and was recognisable as shelter.
Dean doesn’t bother to swallow down the laugh that threatens to escape him and kicks a cupboard closed behind him as he crosses the room to help Cas. As soon as his fingers curl around the red velvet comforter he regrets it, pulling a face that makes Cas laugh at him. Naturally, Dean flips him off before his eyes fall on the side-table beside the bed.
“Actually, I was going to ask if you could pass the ledger, that one by your elbow...Never mind,” he sighed, “I’m gonna...go check on the horses.”
Inside the booth, Gordon was spending a little too long checking a woman’s pass. Dean liked to get them through quickly and with as little fuss as possible. Gordon, on the other hand, liked to spend a little bit of extra time checking through documents he knew were totally fine, just to mess with their heads a little. Make the guilty ones anxious, then they’d be more likely to slip up later. Maybe it even worked on a couple of them, but his stoppage record was no higher than Dean’s or Benny’s. As soon as he realised Dean was behind him he seemed to drag it out even longer, but Dean stayed quiet and suppressed his eye roll. If Gordon wanted to waste his time even after his shift had finished, let him.
Benny squeezed his shoulder, “You did us a solid, friend. I’ll get us out of here, you get in there,” he gestured to Dean’s cabin but Castiel hesitated. He glanced back at the fading sight of
“What?” Dean scoffed. “That’s ridiculous, he’s my brother, I’ve nursed him through everything from a broken arm to the pox, what the hell does he think I’m going to do? Faint at the sight of blood?” He hesitated, “Is there blood, Cas?”
Benny caught the sigh and for a moment his eyes flickered to the door to Dean’s cabin.
“Alright,” Sam breathed, steeling himself. “You know I’ve been...ill-” If Dean hadn’t known his ‘illness’ had been a cover for something before now his tone would have given it away for sure. “That’s not strictly true.”
“Heat pads...and cooling pads?”
Clearing his throat, again, Castiel shifted uncomfortably where he stood. “He might say no,” he mumbled, “There’s no guarantee-”
Dean glanced around them, it was strangely quiet. Not the kind of quiet you would expect in a deserted place, the kind of quiet that prickled through the air. The kind that said something was about to happen, Dean knew it well, he knew to trust it, it had saved his life on more than one occasion. He was about to call over that they should keep going when Castiel cut across him.
Somebody touched Roman’s elbow and whispered something to him, drawing him away. He looked back at Castiel, as though he wanted to say something more, so Castiel smirked at him, knowing that it would annoy him further. It evidently did.
It was far too hurried, pleasure lighting up across every one of Castiel’s nerves at record speed, but in that moment it was everything. Castiel rocked his hips in time with Dean’s movements, knowing that neither of them would last long, it had been far too long since they’d been able to take each other apart.
Clarence arched an eyebrow, “Oh?”
want to fight, I did my duty, but I always thought the humans deserved more than to be collateral damage in a war that barely concerned them. Granted, having the Devil loose on the earth wasn’t ideal, but I’ve always found it somewhat ironic that we managed to do more damage to the world than the one called ‘The Destroyer.’” He gave a humourless chuckle, “I learned later, much later, that the host of heaven, the ones who were supposed to guard humanity, they had gotten bored of their charge and instigated the apocalypse to usher in paradise. I tried to stop it, but...by that time most of the damage had already been done.”
Still, reality would hardly hold for Castiel’s warring feelings and they bore down on the merchant ship, the cannons now firing in easy succession. The other ship might have been firing back, but their gunnery was hardly even in the same class as
When the shout came it seemed to sound of serendipity itself. Castiel, along with every officer on deck, turned from the merchant to look up at where one of the lookouts was calling to them. His words were lost somewhere on the wind between them, but his intention was clear, as was the direction in which he was pointing. Castiel had only to put his hand out and there was a glass slapped into it. He trained it in the direction the lookout had indicated and gave a small smile; there was the ship. It had more than a decent headstart on them, but
“Thank
Castiel did not sleep that night. There was little point. Even if he had found himself able to do so, he would have been able to do so for a few hours before he was woken to go to the duel.
“I told you as much. Did Roman invite you to his soiree to gloat?”
“Have they struck?!”
“Dean. In no way is that a plan.”
“At least I’ll know where to find you,” Castiel murmured, unwilling to release Dean’s hand, as though it could anchor him to the moment.
Immediately, Dean felt the rush of warmth through their bond but even if he hadn’t, he would have known Cas’ excitement from his smile alone. It wasn’t a surprise that Cas was so looking forward to it, after all, Dean had talked a lot about his brother, the most important person in his life, at least until he had met Castiel.
“I brought you straight here and your brothers have been ensuring we aren’t disturbed. I told them we’d face your parents when you were feeling stronger.”
“What if I want to change things?”
, Dean had argued, then Cas would have missed his chance to see something that he obviously wanted to, in a place he’d always wanted to visit. And what kind of best friend in the world would Dean be if he let an opportunity like that pass him by?
Even like this Cas is breathtaking.
The smoke cleared in increments, and when it did a cheer went up from those who remained on
no doubt.
“And?” Castiel asked but Dean only beamed at him.
Dean at the wheel, laughing and carefree. The kindest, most genuine man Castiel had ever met. A man Castiel had considered a friend. More than a friend. Hadn’t he been on the very edge of admitting that he was...at the very least
, basking a little as he heard the others mutter about how they wouldn’t want to run afoul of such a captain.
“There is a war on, we should be taking the fight to the enemy, not poncing around the Caribbean looking for one bastard pirate.”
Castiel needed to breathe. He needed to breathe, get himself under control and get back to his mate. He could do this. The baby took that exact moment to kick and Castiel could breathe. He curled his hand around his bump, as though it might connect him to the baby.
“You’re with child, Castiel,” the Queen said, kindly, smiling at Dean even as tears threatened to spill from her eyes. “My son, you’re having a baby,” she whispered, pulling Dean into her arms, even though Cas lay between them.
“What? Huh? Oh...yeah...I just,” a flush crept across his cheeks, “I was just… I uh...I was thinking of a different what comes next.”
“Hard a’ port,” Dean called, hardly needing to raise his voice to be heard. “Jo, rake them.”
“In the presence of the Gods of this world and the nobles of this land, I do take you to be my omega. I swear to protect you and honour you in-” he chanced a glance at Castiel and his voice faltered. It was Clarence smiling back at him, with such warmth Dean had to close his eyes against it for a moment.
“Oh, Cas,” Dean sighed, tracing a finger through his hair, ignoring that it came away damp. “Cas, I love you.”
“Adam, you are not helping,” Sam hissed. “Tell him Cas, tell him he can’t go.”
“I’ve got the kielbasa you ordered,” he says in what Dean supposes is meant to be a sexy drawl.
“I’d sooner shoot you like a dog,” Roman snapped, a gasp of surprise going up from those closest to them, but Roman had no doubt figured it out. He knew he had fallen into the trap Castiel had lain for him. Now there was nothing to do but for Castiel to close it behind him.
“You don’t think you’ll be back in time?” Castiel sighed.
“We should head back,” Castiel noted, holding his hand out to help Dean off the hood.
He laughed, doubled over, having to hold onto the fountain to steady himself as Clarence just stared at him unimpressed, his robes clinging to him as they dripped a puddle onto the floor.
Dean braced himself for it though he already knew there would be nothing he could do to guard against the hurt that was coming.
Castiel hesitated for a moment before he sighed, “Nassau. I told Benny to head for Nassau, I’ll disembark there.” Dean’s face fell but before he could turn away Castiel lifted a hand to cup his cheek, holding his gaze. “You asked me for my help, Dean. This is how I help you.”
“You alright there, Cas?” Dean asks, finding nothing when he looks himself.
Benny held his hands out expansively, “You’re the cap’n. Garth! Get your ass over here!”
On the eighth day, they emerged.
The offer was sincere, but Castiel felt his breath leaving him. As a captain, he had long mastered the art of hiding his emotions behind a stoic facade and right now it was what saved him. He wouldn’t show Crowley that he was worried that Dean would take him up on it. But Dean surely hadn’t gone into business with Crowley without knowing exactly what kind of man he was. No doubt the powers that be knew that Crowley was supplying both sides but he would hardly want to deliver a renowned naval captain who could confirm the truth of it all. If Dean allowed Castiel to step aboard Crowley’s ship, he would not step off it.
“Hey!” Adam called, having gotten a fair way ahead of them without either of them noticing.
“Obviously, I’m going to mention Roman in it.”
“I’ll have to check with the king,” Dean rasped, his voice a little lower than he would have liked. “Let’s get out of here.”
