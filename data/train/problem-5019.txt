Coffee cup held firmly in his right hand, fine leather briefcase (red and gold because he has style) hanging from the grip of his left hand, Tony opened his mouth to say … something.
The wind coming off the ocean suddenly turned sharp and hard.  Sand was dusted up in thick plumes, racing down the beach towards the cliffs.  The two men observing the east wall of Brooklyn Castle crumbling at the top of the cliff hunched their shoulders against the sudden onslaught.  The thinner man, who had a dusting of white at the temples of his dark hair, was suddenly seized in a coughing fit.  He hacked hard as sand flew around them, causing him to momentarily loose his grip on the thick sheaf of papers in his hands.  Almost as if sensing the weakness, the wind caught the papers and tossed them about, sending some pieces of parchment rolling down the beach. Most of the pages landed in the waiting surf which tried to snatch as much of it away and out to sea.
Logan came into Steve’s view, one of his rather bushy eyebrows raised and with a brown glass bottle in one hand.
“Exactly,” Tony agreed triumphantly. “Now, you two gonna keep distracting me or am I free to go get your coffee and your cake?”
“Oh please, my shit is exactly why you come here,” Tony retorted. “And the cake. I’ll admit, I’m pretty sure it’s mostly the cake. Don’t worry, I’ve actually already got your order in. Second I saw you two pull up I knew what you’d want. Bring us any new art this year, Steve?”
"Rhodey help me," Tony said the moment his neighbor opened the door. Rhodes stared at him for a moment, before waving his arms and rolling his eyes.
And so it went on this way for months. Steve started seeing Tony outside of his apartment, too, which was a nice turn of events. They'd been to a lot of movies. It was probably Tony's favorite thing to educate Steve on. Not just the current ones, either. No, they'd hit the dollar theater for older showings even more than they'd gone to the see the new releases. Steve had also gotten Tony to go on not one but three of his morning jogs, and while he had to go at a painstakingly slow pace to keep Tony from quitting he found he didn't mind the occassional company. Sam, his buddy from a wounded warrior support group, liked when Tony came along too. His favorite passtime was teasing Steve about the way he looked at the billionare, and teasing Tony about how his genes had to include a snail somewhere.
Problem was, by the time morning came and Steve finally opened his eyes the bed was empty. He decided he must have overslept. Of course Tony would use that to his advantage. Steve couldn't help it though. Curled up close with Tony, inhaling him and clinging to his familiar warmth had been so welcomed after days of sleeping alone. He always slept best this way.
"Well, some have been more of a problem than others," Tony admitted. "The ones that stay late.. they're the problem. Hell, one guy? He stayed til like. Two in the morning. Rhodes came out and threatened to 'shove this medal of honor up your ass if you want something there that bad'." He was grinning now, and added, "Looking back, it's hilarious, but at the time I was practically groveling to poor Rhodes and apologizing as much as I could."
"You mean to tell me you lost Tony?" Clint asked as Steve explained the majority of it- leaving the details of their fight out for the moment- and Steve didn't miss the light in Barton's eyes. "This is priceless. How's it feel to be in the doghouse?"
The water came to a boil and a few minutes later Steve was setting a piping hot cup in front of Tony. For a moment they just stared at each other, Tony trying to look angry and Steve unable to drop the goofy grin from his lips. Then he was leaning in to capture Tony's, kiss sweet and apologetic. As much as he was enjoying this he hated to see the man in any sort of agony. Finally he broke away and gestured to the tea.
he knew about and was waiting for Steve to clear) and talking so quietly and just for Steve that Tony could barely see his lips move.
As Tony opened his mouth to go on Steve brought their lips together, tugging Tony into his lap. There was a momentary struggle before Tony huffed and relaxed, and as they broke away the genius didn't even have it in him to glare. Steve pressed a hand to Tony's cheek, gently tracing the right corner of his bottom lip.
For just a few minutes things slowed. Their kisses were still needy, but they weren't quite as fervent and demanding. Tony was memorizing Steve's taste. Steve would break apart every now and then to suck another light bruise into Tony's skin, and Tony was delighted by the idea that Steve was trying to leave his mark. Steve was kissing up Tony's jaw line as he withdrew his fingers, and he pulled away from Tony all together as he drew himself up, kneeling over the man as he finally pressed his cock into Tony's now stretched hole.
I started writing this as a piece about my own personal characters, and I loved it, and I was in pure anguish about it. And then I wanted people to read this story, and I wanted you to feel my anguish, and so I wrote my first Avengers fic in like. A year? Who knows. It is not my intention to hurt you by killing Bucky, but someone had to die. It IS my intention to make you love his and Steve's relationship and then cripple your emotions. I just want you to be aware, you know. Bucky dies. He's not coming back.
going to be a man in the robotics industry, but the diner was his second love. He was invested. At twenty two years old, Tony Stark had personally paid for a visual update and become part owner of a business that he’d once thought of as a way to pass the time and maybe meet some folks. Tony realized that, despite it being
Tony was just so happy to see him. Even if it wasn't in the happiest of circumstances, and even if he wasn't sure why.
For a moment they stood staring at each other. Steve's instinct was to demand to know who the guy was, but as he opened his mouth he was beaten to the punch.
It was time to be cool and collected. Out of the car he got, glancing at his watch. Ten was a little late to hit the bar, but it was probably a good thing in the long run. Less time to be around that sweet, seductive bitch known as alcohol. A quick scan of the parking lot told him that Rhodey and Clint were here, and better yet..
"I'll help you," Clint offered, and a moment later Rhodey was excusing himself to go to the bathroom and- and...
There was something deliciously erotic about the sound of the cap popping off, and Steve easily shimmied out of his boxers and pulled Tony’s down. There was a moment of pure satisfaction, Steve dropping his gaze to admire Tony’s thick, hard cock and silently reminding himself that he’d been the cause of that. The moment passed quickly enough, and Steve helped Tony turn towards the mirror. Tony propped himself on his knees atop the bench, hooking one arm around Steve’s neck as the super soldier gently squeezed Tony’s right thigh. Tony sighed, Steve chuckled, and suddenly there was a slick, slightly chilled finger teasing at Tony. Steve was all too familiar with how to work him open and he wasted no time in getting started.
Silence fell between them for a moment, and then Tony was shoving Steve onto his back and flopping down beside him on the ground. Tony dared to look up at the stars. He decided it was fair to give Steve's hypothesis a shot. Steve wrapped his arm tight around Tony's shoulder, his free hand behind his head, occasionally freeing it to point up at different groups of stars and ask Tony what he thought they looked like.
“In the past few months I have learned the sharpness of your wit, the magnitude of your intelligence and the depth of your heart. I have doubted things I thought were truth and started to believe in things I thought were fairy tales. In the time spent in your company I have realized how barren my time before you was. No matter what brought us together, whatever the future holds, know that you will always be my home.”
The man in question was looking at the painting now, confusion on his brow. He looked back up and turned, presenting the painting to Tony. It was smaller than Tony had realized, no more than 16x20 inches. The frame was oversized and made of dark toned wood, the veins of it still visible. The woman in the painting was still glancing over Tony’s shoulder as if expecting to see something magical to appear.
The creak of the chair was at first a small idosyncracy. Tony was often on the move and rarely stopped in his office long enough to sit back in his chair so the small sound was an occasional annoyance that took up less time in his mind than simple multiplication did. On one rather inconvenient day, Pepper had managed to trap Tony in his office and direct him to the pile of folders on his desk. Folders! For the life of him he couldn’t figure out why a tech company still used paper anything but he sat in his seat and dutifully started reading. After 2 hours the squeaking of his chair was driving him to distraction and grating on his already annoyed nerves. So when he finally managed to sneak out of the office he told his secretary to get the chair replaced.
“I’ll be right back,” was all she said with another brittle smile before turning around the corner and out of sight.
Reluctantly he dropped Steve’s hand and turned to head up to the castle. Steve’s rather loud cough caused him to pause and turn his head back towards the blond.  He felt his jaw drop at the vision that greeted him.  Steve had removed his léine, leaving him only in the brown short trius.  His chest was broad with muscle and his stomach so defined Tony thought some of the laundresses would find it acceptable in cleaning clothing.  A thick dusting a pale hairs covered Steve’s chest, narrowing into a thin line that ran down the middle of his abdominals and disappearing into the tight twill covering him from low on his hips to just past his knees. He made a perfectly enticing image right down to his bare feet.
But before Tony could get really comfortable Steve was standing in front of him, a big, happy smile on his face showing off all his perfect pearly whites.  Like one of Pavlov’s dogs Tony instantly smiled up at the blond.  Belatedly he thought he might be more tired than he thought he was because he was reaching out and taking the remote Steve was offering before the warning bells in his head alerted him to something being off.
“Yeah, I painted her, she was my mom. You must be the man Mr. Erskine told me about. I owe you a great deal of thanks.”
He was moving to the shop’s door before he realized he wanted to move. Pepper had been mid-sentence and protested when Tony walked into the small gallery.  The bell above the door jingled sharply and the man with the painting stopped, looking over his shoulder to see who had come in.
Deflated, Tony slumped in his chair. He wanted to keep raging but it wasn’t Rhodey’s fault. And since no one who deserved his anger was present he didn’t have the energy to cover up the fact that he was scared as fuck.
It wasn’t until the art gallery incident that Tony had learned that the tiny whirlwind was an artist.  A very good and well-known artist.  One of the paintings in Pepper’s office was, in fact, one of his.  Of course, he also discovered that those tiny little cake forks were sharper than they really should be and a three piece Ermenegildo Zegna suit does not protect well from sharp objects.
A much better photo was blown up to show the intricate marking that curved from just under the prince’s right hip to just under his ass. Soul marks were complex and made up of more than a drawn on-like pattern on the skin. They combined scar-like tissues, raised and textured differently than the rest of the skin as well as a change in skin pigments in what, at first, was a hard to define pattern. There was a reason for that, in order to view the full picture the soulmate’s marks would have to be combined. Soul marks, and thus soulmates, were notoriously rare; in the past twenty years Steve had only heard of one pair being found.
“Captain.” Howard came into view from the hallway Jarvis had disappeared down.  Howard was dressed in deceptively simply looking fabric, his frock coat and vest the same dark color while his pants were a lighter tone.  Steve knew for a fact that suit probably cost more than an entire year’s worth of his own wages during the war. “Follow me.”
The texture of the paint made the woman’s skin supple with just a hint of worn weariness. She had been a working woman who could have easily faded into the blank background of the canvas, but instead she defined every inch of the painting, the lack of paint surrounding her portrait on the cloth seemed to make her more alive. It was as if all the world was defined by her and the realness of her.
“If I didn’t know you better, I’d think you three were planning my assassination,” Steve tilted his head at the woman across the room, acknowledging her with respect and smiling in amusement, his elongated incisors pronounced and unmistakable.
“And it will be.  Let me show you what real genius looks like.”  Tony squeezed his hand, just now realizing neither one had let go.
Steve’s head whipped around and easily spotted the billionaire leaning against the door frame, a cheeky smile on his face and a diabolical glind in his blue eyes.  Steve saw the exact moment Tony realized what was about to happen by the way his smile grew in size.  Tony was already turning and running down the hall by the time Steve had vaulted the sofa and gave chase.
“You’re fucking kidding me? This is a joke, right? Rhodey, sourpuss, is this some sort of payback for that thing in Florida?”
Maria frowned, her eyes shooting past Steve and narrowing at Howard.  “You will not. I’ve been planning your wedding for years. And I don’t see who’s going to stop me.”
’s and not less filled with life. Even though the man’s lips were turned slightly down in concern, his eyes held an infinite number of smiles - ones full of fondness, disbelief, humor, and happiness.
Steve blanched, which was pretty amazing considering Tony thought he naturally looked pretty pale.  The blond sat up quickly as if he expected Tony to snatch him and force him into the sea. Tony laughed in delight as Steve coughed conspicuously.  “No, one experience with Sallaga is plenty, thank you.”
Brooklyn Boys Art Gallery kind of looked like any other generic store front with the large glass windows flanking the glass door.  However, the 4 by 4 masterpiece in one of the windows was far from generic.  Tony’s eyes were drawn to the landscape which had an intense red sun baring down and lighting up the otherwise barren snow and ice landscape.  The snow truly looked like it was melting and there was the barest hint of free flowing blue water beneath the ice.  And Tony wasn’t even out of his car yet.
“Pep, spice of life and queen of my kingdom, you can find me a good looking replacement chair that doesn’t offend the sensibilities of blind people.”
Tony blinked suddenly, realizing that the droning voice in the background was gone and when he focused back on the board meeting it was only to make eye contact with Pepper.  She had moved from her usual seat and was sitting next to Tony, turned so they were facing each other.  She did not look pleased.  There was also no one else in the room.
He got his feet under him and made sure he had his balance before standing up completely.  It always took a few seconds to get over the weird sensation of standing on feet, but Tony had been switching between tail and feet practically every other day for the 5 months since Steve moved into the castle, so he was getting used to it. Steve was standing when Tony looked up from his own feet, a fond look on his face as he offered Tony his hand.
“Captain Rogers, I’m afraid Master Anthony is not currently at home.”  Jarvis was always polite but there was a glint in his eyes that made Steve nervous whenever he talked about Tony.  That glint made sure Steve never did anything inappropriate towards Tony more than anything Tony’s father said.  Not that Steve would ever do anything inappropriate.
Steve could tell he’d actually managed to stump the genius with his actions but for once Steve couldn’t appreciate it, Logan’s words from weeks ago which had been nagging at the back of his mind now coming to forethought.
The young woman gave him a thin smile and said with all the gravitas of someone chewing glass, “This will just be a few minutes, sir.”
Jan pushed and Tony found himself enveloped in the soft embrace of one of the sofas.  He was between Thor and Bruce which he was pretty happy about and laid his head against Thor’s shoulder with an appreciable sigh.  Jan flounced off to take her own seat while Thor put his arm closest to Tony across the back of the sofa, encouraging the billionaire to snuggle up next to him.
The scent of oak trees and dew reached Steve’s nostrils causing him to inhale deeply. The scent of coffee buried deeper in the complex aroma that Steve recognized as belonging to his mate. For a second he felt his muscles relax knowing Tony was okay but then he caught the sharp tang of blood coming from the direction Tony had entered. He’d bared his teeth in a deathly promise at the piece of shit cowering below him before turning quickly to see how hurt Tony was.
Mentally shaking himself he abandoned the distraction - certain now that was what the magazine was there for - and back to the remote.  He rounded the couch and sat down directly opposite where the remote was on the table and folded his hands, leaning his chin against his fingers in contemplation.
Pepper caught his eye and grinned, “I’m not hurt, and Rhodes only twisted his leg on the way back when he slipped on some bloody grass.”
She just sighed before turning to him and folding her hands in front of her on her desk. “The current program we use to update names was released in 2003. At that time certain assumptions were made about the people using the program and those assumptions did not include people born in 1918 still requesting social security cards. When I put in your date of birth it creates an error.”
The man’s brows drew close and down in confusion, his blue eyes shifting in shades of blues like a video of the clear sky at 3x speed.
All of her glares and annoyance was because he was so old it broke the computer program?  Steve was never going to tell Tony about this or he’d never hear the end of it.
“I, Prince Antonio Edward Carbonell Stark, Duke of Manhattan, Prince of Northern York, and Lord Legatee of Pack America, take Steven Grant Rogers, King of Southern York, High Captain of Brooklyn and Tiarna Vampire of America as my mate, as ordained by the stars and destined by the gods. With this ring, Steve, I promise to always love you, challenge you, make each of your days happier than the one before it. There are places a person belongs and journeys they must make. For me, my home, my place of belonging, is in your heart. For me, all journeys begin and end with you.”
Tony narrowed his eyes at the bowl placed in front of him. Tomato, he hoped. He’d only been at Castle Brooklyn for a week and he couldn’t shake the sensation of creepiness in the mausoleum-like building he now had to call his home. Glancing up from the soup he looked down the long table to where his
sat. Tony could admit that Steven Rogers was good looking. There were dozen of websites solely dedicated to thirsting after the man, as Tony had discovered by innocently stumbling upon, not that he was
Tony shrugged, “Not that I have been doing much of that in a long time, Pepper’s pretty much run things since I inherited the office.”
Steve tried not to look around at the opulence as he removed his helmet.  He remembered the first time he walked into the Stark Mansion and had no intention of making a fool out of himself, again.  His eyes were drawn to the portrait facing the front door. The three Stark’s were exquisitely dressed and staring imperiously at everyone who walked into their home.  Well, Howard looked imperious. Maria had a small smile, a twinkle in her eye as if welcoming people. And Tony. Steve’s breath caught at the rakish smile, smoothed back dark hair and the same twinkle in his blue eyes that Maria had in her dark ones.  Tony’s frock coat was heavily embroidered in a way that was to remind people his family had the money to waste on the extra thread. Maria’s dress was likewise done and the painter had done an amazing job of catching the glimmer of fabric which had to be a fine silk.  Not for the first time Steve wondered why he thought this was a good idea.
“You, Obadiah Stane, have shown a supreme lack of common sense and self-preservation here, tonight, and no doubt your King will find similar faults with the years of public service you have provided the people of Northern York.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed in concentration at the other man. “And what are your opinions of my entourage?”
Tony took the hand and jumped the couple of feet down to the sand.  He silently bemoaned the lack of height he had with his legs.  He was almost nine feet long with his tail but only 5’9” when on feet. He felt Steve squeeze his hand and looked up – he always felt a little affronted at the fact that Steve was several inches taller than him.
Howard’s words were decisive, his lips turned up in a smirk as if hoped the words cut and went deep.  Steve wondered if he’d been waiting for Steve to come and ask permission before announcing he’s agreed to marry Tony off to the highest bidder.  That sounded exactly like something Howard would do.  Cold rage flooded through Steve’s body and before he could stop himself he put his hand on the hilt of his sword and gave Howard a cold stare.
“I’d decided to stop painting, couldn’t sell a piece to save my life. I was days away from picking up my life and moving to some suburbs to be a house painter. Then you bought my painting. I decided to stick it out and well,” he gestured to the rest of the room with his free hand, “here we are. I’ve sold almost a dozen paintings just in the last seven weeks, so thank you for taking a liking to my painting.”
Steve’s eyes did shoot to Logan who was tipping back his drink.  When he was done, Logan scooped up the remote and tossed it to the super-soldier.
Tony gulped and stepped back, in awe of the execution of the painting. Pepper was forever telling him how paintings should evoke strong emotions and here he was standing in front of only the second painting he’d seen that was capable of reaching into his soul, pulling at memories and long buried emotions.
When Steve handed the form and his New York driver's license to the young woman sitting behind the counter, he had - perhaps naively - thought it was his name that made her eyebrows raise in disbelief. Her deep blue eyes skittered quickly over the form, jumped to him, and then back to the form. She narrowed her eyes and then held up his driver’s license to inspect it. Her eyes shifted back to him and then to her computer screen.  He was expecting some kind of excited realization and maybe a request for an autograph, not a drawn out sigh of annoyance and a glare that would have made Natasha pause in concern.  He really should not have underestimated government employees and the endless bureaucratic bullshit they have to deal with.
That got him another stink eye but she pulled another sheet out from wherever she was getting them under her desk and stamped it. “This is your receipt. Your name should be legally updated as of tomorrow morning and you should get your new social security card in 7-10 business days. Is there anything else I can help you with?”
The shooting pleasure stopped when Steve took his hand out of his pocket and Logan’s menacing stare switched to the blond man.
“Pfft, he is an idiot.  Your castle would look so much better if it extended over the cliff, Steve. Richards’ ideas are stupid.”
“You should have Carol appointed in the interim,” Tony injected, “she’ll probably do such a good job that when the elections come around she’ll win by a landslide. Bonus, then Rhodey will be First-Lady.”
Steve loved Tony, dearly, but waiting in line and being relatively unnoticeable were two skills the man did not possess.  Steve was changing his name and he wanted to do it himself, something Tony didn’t understand but thankfully didn’t badger Steve about too much.
Tony threw up his arms in exasperation but before he could turn away Steve grabbed him by the front of his shirt and pulled him forward.  The moment their lips met Steve slanted his mouth and kissed Tony like a man on a mission.  Tony’s lips parted easily and as their kiss deepened - as Steve’s tongue swept into Tony’s mouth - Steve found they’d wrapped their arms around each other and Tony had hooked one of his feet around Steve’s calf.  They were pressed as closely together as their clothes allowed and all Steve wanted was to get closer.
“My office is boring, and Pepper has everything covered.”  Tony turned a sly look Steve’s way. “I might have legally turned everything over to her.”
There was one rule about the remote war the others demanded - and that was only one prank per week per participant.  So it wasn’t really unusual for the two of them to be in the family room resorting to more traditional ways to fight about what to watch on TV.  Unfortunately for Steve, Tony had no reservations about invading Steve’s personal space.  Something he still blushed furiously at when he remembered trying to hold the remote above them out of Tony’s reach.
“Your lack of interest or knowledge in who Tony is seems to do you a disservice.  Tony may have done a great deal to garner favor with you in the past but that is the past.  It has been a long time since Tony has bent to your will. I came here because I respect traditions and that you are his father, but I know full well that Tony will marry me because he has already tried to convince me to elope with him.  I told him no in the hopes that we could marry among friends and family. As it seems you have no interest in securing him a future in which he could flourish your judgment holds no value. Tony and I will marry even if it does come to elopement.”
Tony did not, in fact, sit down. Not that Rhodey thought he would have. Instead Tony continued to pace the length of the office Rhodey had brought him to as soon as he’d returned from frolicking in Italy. He turned to his best friend and scowled. As his bestie, Rhodey had bestie obligations - like somehow preventing Tony’s life from being ruined - but Rhodey was also a Colonel in the Royal Guard and took his job far more seriously than their college years could have predicted.
Logan’s answer was another grunt.  Tony picked up his fork, scooping up some eggs, but before he could get the cutlery to his mouth a sudden shock of electricity ran up his spine.  He froze, trying to keep his reaction to a minimum even as the shooting lust settled in his groin.  Tony’s eyes slid to Steve who was hiding a grin behind his mug, his other hand suspiciously hidden in the pocket of his pants.  The genius shifted on his stool, trying to ease the sharp pleasure coming from deep inside of him.  A low growl came from Logan’s direction and when Tony dared to look at him the man’s eyes were narrowed into dangerous slits, his frown threateningly showing off his pointed incisors.
Tony dropped his hands and took a step back.  He wasn’t entirely sure what had come over him in the first place but he nodded to himself, mind made up.  “We should go out.”
Bucky spotted him and smiled. The smile was genuine and sincere prompting Steve to return it, his shoulders relaxing as the sensation of eyes crawling over him finally stopped. He hugged the other man tightly, glad to the depths of his soul at the sight of his longest friend.
“Well.” A voice spoke up from the doorway and Steve’s head whipped around to see Tony framed in the entrance.  His gold and red frock coat set off his skin beautifully, his dark hair oiled and swept away so that Steve could see the brilliance in his eyes.  Breath and heartbeat stopped as it always did when he saw Tony.
The prince was moving quickly towards him, the hastily donned robe fanning out around his legs and drawing Steve’s attention to the bared and slightly muddied feet. Other than patches of dirt and a leaf in his hair, Tony appeared unhurt. Behind him, though, Steve found where the new scent of blood was coming from. Pepper, Tony’s courtier and close friend, followed behind him. She was dressed similarly to the prince but the bottom of her face and visible cleavage bore the unmistakable remains of gore and gristle. Behind her, Colonel Rhodes and Bucky were likewise marred.
His hand was stiff where it was cradled in the grasp of Steve’s hand. Even after everything that had transpired in the past seven months Tony could not find it in himself to relax. He hated this marriage even if he no longer hated the man at his side. For Tony, as they walked down the aisle, wrapped in their traditional matrimony costumes, everything ahead of him felt like an end to a dream.
Tony’s grin was wide and open and only for Steve before he turned and looked over his shoulder.  Steve could make out Jarvis and Maria in the hallway. “Mama, looks like you won’t get to plan a wedding since I’ll have to elope.”
“Just for the record, you came into my place of business.”  Steve’s voice was a little rough and he moved his mouth a bit, stretching the muscles in his face as if checking that everything was in place.  “I am not violating the restraining order.”
Rhodey held up a hand before Tony could get really revved up with that line of thinking, “The King has already tried the political route and Pepper and Matt couldn't find a loophole for you to wiggle out of. If it makes you feel any better, judging by the messenger's face, the vampires aren’t thrilled with this development either. The message from King Rogers used the phrase ‘our marks are inconvenient’ or so I’ve heard.”
From behind Steve, Howard cleared his throat. Steve turned, noting Stane’s body was being dragged away before facing the other king.
The blond man gave the retreating figure a resigned look before sighing heavily in Tony’s general direction.  He made his way towards the outcropping and it was all Tony could do to not drool.  The pale blue léine was stretched wonderfully across the man’s shoulders and hung loosely to mid-thigh, but it wasn’t long enough to take away the magnificent view of the way he strode in his tight brown trius.  Tony sighed wistfully, his tail curling up into the air and towards his head.  So entranced was Tony that he hadn’t paid attention to how close his tail fins were to his head and inadvertently slapped himself atop his head.
A faint tint of red appeared on the apple of Tony’s cheeks and spread in a very attractive manner even as Tony kept his eyes locked to Steve’s in what Steve recognized as defiance.
Howard had dropped into a cushioned arm chair and was waiting expectantly as Jarvis came in and poured a dark liquid from a crystal decanter into a matching glass.  Jarvis presented the glass to Howard who took the drink without looking at his butler. The sharp smell told Steve it was brandy. Steve was not offered a glass.
It was impossible for the man to have not noticed, but thankfully he only paused for a second before continuing closer, now with an amused grin on his face.  By the time he made it close enough they could speak Tony was laughing lightly to himself at his miscalculation.
“What?  Are you not happy to see me?”  Tony rolled onto his back, twisting his long tail out effortlessly. He had pulled himself far enough up the outcropping that the tips didn’t even reach the water. Tony hadn’t missed the way Steve’s eyes tracked the length of red scales and the way they practically glowed with a golden opalescence in the rays of the sun.
“The police?  Little more than thugs and degenerates.  You are not helping your cause, Captain. I’m well aware of Anthony’s trivial affection for you but my dear friend, Obadiah, has put forth an offer for Anthony’s hand on behalf of his son.  Ezekiel Stane is a much better match for my son.”
Steve’s mouth was open in a greeting when his eyes locked with Tony’s and then there was nothing but panic in those blue orbs.  In a feat of rather impressive speed he turned and slammed directly into the door he had pulled closed after him.  The blond stumbled back a few steps cradling his nose.  Tony hurried over, not quite suppressing his laughter, which earned him a glare from the other man.  Tony didn’t see any blood so thankfully the impact hadn’t been as bad as it had looked.
Steeling himself he pushed the ‘on’ button and watched the obscenely large TV flicker on.  Steve immediately recognized the show as CSI and frowned.  He clicked the channel button only to discover CSI on the next channel - and the next.  He rapidly flicked through several more channels, all showing the exact same episode of CSI.
Steve nervously drummed his fingers on the counter and reminded himself to stay calm.  Government offices were so impersonal it felt strange being in them. He couldn’t help but wonder if he had done something wrong and racked his brain trying to figure out what the issue was. Looking for something to do, since the woman was taking a lot more time to come back then she had implied, Steve pulled out his phone. The first thing he noticed was a bunch of texts from Tony so he opened them to see what was going on.
Steve smiled and the next thing Tony knew Steve’d released his hand, “I know.” The blond put both of his hands into the front pockets of his pants while Tony’s hand still tingled.
Several others “ooo’d” while a few laughed.  Clint flicked a piece of popcorn at him which somehow managed to get stuck in Tony’s hair.
“Um, sorry? How much for what?” The man looked around at the various paintings and sculptures placed around the room, never once glancing at the masterpiece in his hand.
Tony let out a harsh breath, the curling bangs across his forehead fluttering from the force, “You were
“No, no, and no. Stop being so damn dramatic and sit down,” Rhodey stirred the coffee in his cup for lack of anything else to do. His only option was to just passively deal with Tony’s tantrum or watch the prince pace back and forth like a zoo animal.
Standing atop the platform in his throne room, Steve surveyed the man in front of him. Steve hadn’t bothered to sit on his throne and instead looked down the length of his nose at the bleeding and beaten werewolf on his hands and knees several steps below him. King Howard stood several yards back, conferring with some of the Northern York pack that had accompanied him to Brooklyn for the Engagement Gala scheduled for the night after next. At least the wolf king appeared just as angry over this turn of events that Steve felt. He’s be sure to have Natasha’s network of spies look into what specifically he was angry about - the failed assassination or the fact his Prime Minister had actually planned to assisinate his son.
“Then why are you always fighting for the remote?” Steve eyed the other man, noting every muscle twitch as he tried to figure out just what the last two months had been about.
Bucky smiled again and clasped Steve on the shoulder as he opened the door. Once inside, Stephen Strange swept behind them, closing the door and quickly forming sigils with his hands to seal the room. Across the room, her back to a corner of the room, Natasha Romanov watched silently, her hands tucked behind her back.
Steve’s smile grew wider, his eyes dark and infinitely fond as if to say “I have no idea what you’re talking about, but I’m happy you’re telling me.”
The second one had a link to a picture someone had taken not more than 30 minutes ago and posted to Twitter. Steve was looking awkward and trying to appear as small as possible in the uncomfortable plastic chairs in the lobby. He looked cramped, squished between a young mother with a baby on her lap and a man dressed in a bespoke suit apparently fuming at the mouth.  But despite that, Steve was grinning at his phone. He had been playing Tsuki Adventure while waiting with the others for his number to be called and the art always made him smile.
“Sir, I’m actually here to speak with Mr. Stark.”  Steve stood a little straighter and was proud his voice didn’t warble.
With Jan’s surprisingly strong grip on Tony’s forearm he marched dramatically into the family room.  Most of the team had already gathered for the impromptu movie night and Tony looked around at the three large sofas trying to decide where to sit.
Tony sipped at his coffee, enjoying the show as Steve cooked at the stove.  The blond was swaying his hips just a bit and the sweatpants he had framed his ass gorgeously.  Logan wandered in temporarily drawing Tony’s attention.  The shorter man was dressed mostly in his uniform with only his cowl pushed back.  Tony noted the suit held up famously as Logan took a seat near him at the bar, his own coffee in a take out container from one of the many coffee bars in Queens.
when looked back up at the man’s face again. Red had begun to tinge his cheeks though the concern was still clear in his expression. Their eyes met and it was the blue of the other man’s eyes that hit him. They were the same pale blue in Tony’s painting, darker around the iris than
When he moved into the second space he stopped, momentarily awed by the various paintings mounted to the wall opposite him.  There were only four of them but he immediately knew they were done by the same Steve Rogers who had painted
To celebrate Tony looked up local eateries and convinced Pepper they needed gelato from a shop down the street. They made it a block when movement in the display window caught Tony’s eye. A man was carefully removing a large canvas painting from the easel facing the street of a small run nondescript art gallery. The painting was a portrait of a woman. Her pale blue eyes seemed to peer over Tony’s shoulder at something in the far distance. She herself was turned slightly away in the painting, as if it was Tony who had caught her attention, drawing her attention away from someone unseen. Her blond hair was pulled tightly back into a bun but a few small wisps of hair framed her pale skin. Even with a pane of glass between them Tony could see the smattering of pale freckles covering her face and the way her eyes shone with all the brilliance of an ethereal smile.
It took a couple of seconds to fully process what the woman had told him in an almost bored tone, but he dutifully looked over the sheet. He felt a small thrill when he saw the name change on an official paper and quickly checked over everything else. He winced a bit at his date of birth but pushed the sheet back to her.
So he was an artist. Tony was wondering how lucky he’d be if this man turned out to be the Steve Rogers who painted
“Why are you up here anyways?  I thought Pepper had finally wrangled you into actually performing your duties on a semi-regular basis.”
It took several seconds of ogling the man before Tony realized Steve was holding out the blue léine to him.  Tony reached out to take the clothing but Steve didn’t let go.  Instead, he moved closer to Tony and pulled the shirt over Tony’s head.  As Tony put his arms through the sleeves Steve ran his hands down Tony’s sides, settling the fabric over his hips.
“I figured it had to happen eventually.”  And that hurt, Tony realized, that Steve had expected Tony to fail. “I imagine you’ll just stick with the alchemy part now?  You always enjoyed that more than the day to day duties of having to maintain the supplies.”
After steadying himself and the young woman he had looked down to the startling sight of a blond head between his feet.  The man had landed face down so Tony’s first impression was that the man had a nice head of floppy, golden hair.  The man’s head turned and a single gleaming blue eye stared up at Tony.  Tony had been more amused than anything but apparently, the downed man just freaked out, trying to get off the ground and away from Tony as soon as possible.  Unfortunately for Tony, the blond didn’t gauge the distance well, or something, and the back of that blond head ended up colliding sharply with Tony’s crotch.
“What? That’s not – I mean – Dammit, Pepper, have the damn order removed.  I’m going out for the rest of the day.”  Tony left the conference room to the sound of Pepper’s giddy laughter.
The remote was on the coffee table when Steve entered the room.  He stopped abruptly eyeing the small electronic device suspiciously.  It sat rather innocuously on the glass topped octagon shaped piece of furniture.  Also on the coffee table were two of Jan’s fashion magazines and a Time Magazine featuring Tony in one of his “poised businessman” poses.  For a second Steve’s eyes wandered instinctually over the features of the man, noting he could tell exactly when the photo was taken by the carefully covered up bruise fading on his chin and the lack of scar between his left temple and hairline.
The man shook his head, the sun lighting up the blond strands and making them a liquid gold.  Quickly, he finished his task gathering as many lost pages as he could before turning them over to the dark headed man.  They spoke quietly to each other before both men looked up and over to where Tony was relaxing on the outcropping he had decided to sun himself on, his belly to a flat sandy boulder.  Tony gave them a brilliant smile and waved again, this time only really using his wrist, making his hand look more like a flopping fish.  The dark-haired man looked heavenward before throwing his hands up and stomping away towards to the path that connected the beach to the castle grounds.
Tony took up the spot next to Steve on the dais, his predator eyes locked at the man gagged below. Steve took the cue and looked back to their prisoner.  Bucky moved down the steps as if to place himself between the traitor and his King but stopped short, instead waiting for Steve to give the word.
“Were you really using the remote as a means to flirt with me?”  Steve openly gawked at Tony in disbelief.
A chill ran down Tony’s spine. He knew the desert expertly hinted at in the background of the painting. He’d seen the men and women soldiers stand tall under the unrelenting sun. For a second Tony tasted sand in mouth, felt it move along his spine and dig into his fingernails. Tony blinked rapidly, focusing on the other details of the painting. The man’s right arm had excruciating detail, a bruise in the processes of forming while another healed; a cut still red with newness and forearm hairs slightly singed. In comparison the left arm appeared much less formed. It almost seemed slightly off, just slightly out of focus and almost like the lines of it were luminescent.  Looking at the card taped to the wall next to it, Tony noted the title:
Steve’s brow drew together in momentary confusion before his expression cleared, leaving no inkling of what he was thinking. “You will be Lord Consort after we are married, whoever you wish to visit or stay is up to you, no one will interfere. We may have options and express them but if you want someone to be here then your wish is law.”
Rhodey’s face softened, “I know, under bestie law I am both sorry and ready to maul the fuck out of any vampire that tries to hurt you - king or no. But as a member of the Royal Guard and thus under the rule of your asshole father, you’re getting packed up and moving into Brooklyn Castle by the end of next month. Obadiah has already written up the peace treaty and started making the arrangements.”
“Well, at least you got hurt first, this time.”  Before he could stop himself, Tony had Steve’s face cradled in his hand.  Steve’s eyes widened in shock and he looked truly baffled for all of two seconds before the glare was back.
Before the other king had even finished talking, Steve’s fingers began to tighten, the hard nails biting into flesh until it gave way to blood. Steve’s thumb sliced into the man’s trachea and he dropped Stane to the ground. For several seconds, Stane spasmed before succumbing to his death - whether from blood loss or drowning in his own blood - Steve did not care. He turned back to the dais as snarls and barking growls erupted from the dozen or so werewolves in the room; something the wolves were known to do as a show of dominance over the body of a defeated enemy.
“Sir, I don’t wish to take any more time than is necessary.  I have come here today to ask your permission to marry your son, Anthony.”  Steve watched Howard’s fingers tighten around the glass, going white before he forced them to relax.
Steve smoothed down the front of his coat, the blue wool helping to absorb some of the sweat on his palms.  He adjusted the belt his sabre hung from and avoided touching the hilt or any of the brass buttons forming a row down the middle of his coat.  Steve had spent too much time polishing the buttons and the gold-plated hilt to muss them up in the eleventh hour.
A smile bloomed across Tony’s face and he practically hopped over to the redheaded woman to give her a kiss on the cheek. “Deal.”
of the keys of her keyboard seemed loud, especially since there was a thick pane of glass separating them. He’d had to slip the form and ID through a small cut out at the bottom and as far as he could tell that was also the only way sound traveled between the two.  Steve imagined it was very difficult to actually hold necessary conversations with people this way, which was probably why there seemed to be a near shouting match going on at the other windows.
“That one's marked $800, but even I think that’s a bit much. I’d be willing to sell it for $500.” The man had decades on Tony, the top of his head bald and the fuzz circling his head wild and erratic. His pale grey eyes didn’t show any recognition in who Tony was and how much money Tony had access to, which would have been refreshing if Tony wasn’t so caught up in the brush strokes of the oil painting in his hand.
There was a sense of the uncanny in the way her lips were tipped up in the beginnings of a smile and the soft wrinkles around her eyes. Tony realized he recognized the expression as the one his mother gave him whenever she had caught sight of him. His body was frozen with the intensity of emotion swirling in him and as the man moving the painting finally disappeared with it into the bowels of the shop Tony felt the same pain he’d felt when he realized he'd never see that look on Maria Stark’s face again.
The summons to present himself to the Council’s Study was unusual enough that Steve didn’t outright dismiss it. If Stephen, Bucky, and Natasha were asking to speak to him there instead of his convocation or even his private study, they must feel discretion was absolutely necessary. Curiosity piqued, he excused himself from the assemblage of citizens seeking help from the crown and sycophants scrounging like rats. As he turned the corner that led to the Council’s Study he waved off the two guards following him and noted Bucky waiting outside the doors.
For Steve Rogers, Tony Stark shone just as brightly as any of those little balls of gas. For Tony Stark, Steve Rogers outshone the sun.
"Touch yourself," Steve suggested, breathless, and Tony nodded into the glass. Just like that the billionaire was fisting his own cock and Steve had such a good view. Steve was absolutely wrecking Tony and here he was with the best seat he’d ever had for the show. Seriously, after this, he’d explore just about and kink Tony had because hello where had this been all his life?
, he’d found a love nearly as pure as the one Bucky and Steve had. He’d made perfect moments here. It was good.
"Brucie!" Tony cried as he walked through the door, putting on his very, very best innocent face as the man stood with his arms folded beside his traitorous friends. "Don't tell me the kids went running to daddy the second they got here? I'm hurt. They don't trust me."
“They’re gonna be the same size Buck.” That was Steve, and his eye roll seemed to have been perfected and doused with affection over what Tony could only assume was perfected through the course of a
"Better neighbors in this sort of place," Tony replied with a shrug. "Like, my next door neighbor, Rhodes. He's some big shot in the military. And when he comes home he always brings me souveniers from wherever he's been. And Clint, on the other side, he's got hearing problems so I can blare my music most days and not bother either of them. Which is good, because I work best when I can't hear myself thinking."
"Oh," Steve replied, going back to the menu. "Well, it's nice to see you, Tony. I'm glad they needed help tonight." Rhodey dropped the soda onto the table, patting Steve on the shoulder. "I think I need a few more minutes, if that's alright?"
"Tony." This time Steve's tone was gentle. He was sure he'd figure this out easy enough. "Do you want to talk about it, or do you want to talk about technology?"
"I uh... Well, that is.. You know those little vaccum cleaners that move around by themselves?" At Steve's nod, Tony grinned. "I kind of invented the Jarvis. You know, the-"
Tony licked his lips, before surging back up for another kiss. He threw his arm around Steve's shoulders and tugged the taller down towards the bed, opening his legs and allowing Steve to slot between them. Steve was bracing himself on one knee, achingly close to Tony's hard cock, and for a moment they just explored each others mouths.
The blond seemed to mull it over for a moment, before he shrugged and grabbed anoth piece of pizza. Steve had one hell of an apetite- that was actually three so far, and he'd had barely been here ten minutes. Tony was probably wondering just how much energy museum work took.
"I have no idea what you’re talking about," Steve replied with a playful wink, and ducked out the door as Tony shouted curses after him.
From here in Steve's lap, Tony actually felt a little tall. It was nice. There was something actually quite comforting about surrendering to Steve and his antics, even if at times Tony didn't want to. Steve was learning how to bring him out of his dark places. Tony wanted to be annoyed about it, but rather he found himself loving it. Loving this whole crazy thing they were doing. Loving Steve.
"I'll help you build a better sandcastle." There was something playful in Steve's tone, and Tony waited. But he didn't offer anything more.
"You want in, Clint? You could help me come up with games," Tony offered, and though he wasn't derailed from his train of thought he did pick up a few of the folding chairs.
"So lets be a little later." Steve’s tone was playful, one that Tony absolutely adored. It was such a private tone. Not many knew this side of the super soldier.
They both paused, Steve pulling back slightly to search Tony’s eyes. They hadn’t dropped that line yet. Tony hadn’t meant to do it now- though he had been intending to do it sooner rather than later- but now that cat was out of the bag and Tony just flat out stared waiting for some sort of response.
"When you talk science it really drives me crazy," Tony confessed, turning from the stars to instead place a gentle kiss on Steve's forehead.
Some nights back in his time, during the war, he would look up at them and imagine he was a million miles away. For a few minutes he was free of the stress and the concerns he had about what tomorrow might bring. He loved to sketch the stars, constellations, create his own and morph them into beautiful pieces. He didn't get to start doing that until after he emerged from the ice, but now he spent whatever time he could really appreciating that he was alive to see those stars still. There was something about them that made him feel secure.
Steve wasn’t gone long, returning with the earlier-retrieved lube. Steve was very good about remembering that Tony needed preparation, and Tony was very thankful for that. He’d had a few over-eager partners try to go in dry. Not a thing. No one ever needed to try that again.
Soon enough the teams were set. Natasha led the opposing force, with Bruce and Clint on her side. Thor, Tony, and Steve stood against them. It was one hell of a game. Tony was a little useless, but that was why Steve had picked Thor. The highlight, however, was when Tony spiked the ball at Steve who in turn sent it rocketing up with some impressive speed, and Thor met it to send it sailing over the net and down into the sand. That was the game point.
"Not the hat," Tony pleaded, eyes shooting to the mock-dunce cap sitting behind the bar. 'I Make Shit Decisions' was written on it a few times, and it would not be the first time that Anthony Edward Stark was given the fool's crown. "I'll be good. Scouts honor."
"Stevie, I think I'm glad this guy ain't your boyfriend because-" Bucky started and Steve threw his hands up. Could he put his foot further into his mouth?
Tony groaned, trying to lift up and effectively shove Steve off of his back. “Teaching you about the dirty talk kink was such a mistake,” Tony grumbled, but Steve could see the smile on his face in the mirror before them. “Come on big guy, we gotta get dressed. Again.”
"Well that’s the main purpose for it," Tony grumbled, trying to shove some of his excitement over all of this down. His dick was definitely hard, and that was all the excitement he really needed. "But I used to use it for.. well, other things."
"You made me stomp around and holler up here for 2 hours last week so you could play hideout in his apartment," Clint pointed out, nearly earning a punch to the shoulder. He was a bit quicker than Tony, though, so the inventor was left with a miss and a pout. "Well, I'm in. Lets go to the bar and see you fawn over him in person."
"Volleyball!" Natasha called, hoisting one pole up in the air and digging it down into the sand as Clint worked the other into the ground.
"You know exactly what's on that menu," Tony countered. "You probably know it better than I do, actually. I should really have it memorized by now, but that would be hard work and I'm not here for that. I don't even work here anymore, not really."
Tony stood and stretched, glancing at his watch. "You know, there's plenty of things I could catch you up on," he offered. And okay, he would have said 'like dinner', but he was trying to behave. He didn't need one of his conquests to live a floor below him. Not that.. Steve would be a conquest. Steve was the type of guy you introduced to your parents. You know, if you talked to them, or if they weren't dead. But the point was he was that type. Tony absolutely refused to think about (today at least) how Steve was also the type of guy who'd have you fisting the sheets and crying into the pillow of your parents bedroom because good god look at him, he was definitely the type to fuck you thoroughly and-
The shovel talk. Tony licked his lip, trying to keep calm. He was getting the shovel talk. How much had Steve said about him? Was it that serious that they really thought they were going to hook up?
"Lets get out of here," Tony suggested, and was met with an enthusiastic nod. Tony chuckled and leaned in for one more kiss, just as Steve threw his arm around Tony's shoulder. Bruce knew he was good for the tab, so Tony didn't head for the bar first. Instead, he and Steve found their way out to the parkinglot and to Tony's car. There was a moment of silence, Tony staring up at Steve as the blonde stared down at him, and before Tony could ask-
"Shit, Pepper is going to kill me," he groaned, standing up and grabbing his now empty bottle, chucking it in the trash. "Listen, it was so nice to meet you finally. Seriously. But I've got to run- I have a thing- a uh- listen, if you ever meet Pepper you'll understand. I've gotta go." He swiped the screen and offered a nervous, "Pep!" The angry chattering that came through was enough to convince Steve.
"Want a beer while you wait?" he offered, headed for the fridge. Tony just nodded and soon they were seated in the kitchen chairs each holding a cold Budweiser.
"You eating anything tonight, stranger?" Tony asked, as though he didn't know his usual order. He'd moved to stand next to Steve's table after giving him a moment to sit on his own, but now he was here to keep Steve from caving in on himself. He looked like he might at any moment. He didn't just want to bring his usual though. He wasn't sure if cake was something that Steve would want tonight. He might not even be hungry. Tony might be sitting here with a customer after hours who didn't want a bite or anything more than a sip of soda. That was alright. Steve looked like he needed some perfect moments.
There was an awkward moment where Tony met Steve's eyes and looked like he wanted to say something, but then he just... walked past him. Was he seriously still upset with him over last night? Not even a hello? That was just about that, and he followed Tony into the kitchen as the billionaire opened his freezer and pulled out a firecracker. Stark had insisted the freezer stay stocked with the red, white, and blue popsicles as a joke at first, and it had apparently stuck. Steve's mood soured even further as Tony took to eating the snack but still wouldn't say anything to him.
There was no answer. The moments ticked by. Steve moved to knock again when suddenly he noticed it. The key was taped to the inside of the door frame. Steve felt a wave of disapointment. After all that excitement, he didn't even get to meet apart- er, A. E. Stark? Stark. That was easier to say.
"I won't be hanging out that much," Bruce admitted. "I own the place. Got some work to do. But there's a couple free beers with your names on them tonight." He shot a pointed, warning look at Tony, before heading back to his office to finish up some work on the books.
"Who?" Right, Tony, because Rhodey can't see through that falsely innocent tone. Sometimes it was easier to pretend that Rhodes wasn't nearly as smart as he was, or that he didn't know Tony better than Tony knew himself. "I'm just tired, the door was there, must've faded off somewhere for a minute. I'm not expecting anyone sugar bear."
The first finger dipped gently inside. Tony went pliant against Steve, back pressed tight against his chest as his hips rocked back and forth in shallow motions. Steve didn’t hold him still- not yet anyway- and instead pressed that single finger deeper. Slow, lazy kisses went to Tony’s ear, and Tony could swear that Steve wasn’t just breathing, he was whispering. Low enough that it was left to Tony’s imagination. Right now, that imagination was running wild and free.
The door opened with all the grace you could expect from a diner door; the bell chimed loudly from the force of him pressing his body into it, like if Tony was a second later he'd wind up missing Steve even though he was moving one step at a time. "Steve!" he called out, and watched the man freeze in his place and lift his shoulders. He didn't turn for a moment, and Tony left the safety of the door to come up and get in front of him, looking at that face. There was nothing good there. The usual spark to his eyes wasn't there. His hair wasn't styled the way it usually was, the shadow of facial hair he'd been able to note from inside under the dull light of the street lamp and the diner's sign was much less sculpted than he had thought. It wasn't thick- a light smattering that said he'd given up on it a few days ago.
It went without saying that they were gorgeous, but there was more to Tony’s instant admiration of them. There was such a softness to their interactions, something that Tony had never seen in all his life. His parents loved each other, sure. He and Howard might not always see eye to eye (they nearly never did, actually. Don’t get him started on the fight that broke out when Howard learned he was wait staff at a diner.) but he never doubted that his father loved his mother, and Maria was enamored with him despite his many, many character flaws. Tony might not understand it, but he’d always respected it. And so he’d grown up thinking that was the goal- for people to
"I think we can work that out," Steve assured him, letting his hands fall to lazily rest on Tony's hips. "I can't believe you fell for such a cheesy line. I can't believe I actually pulled that."
"You did that because I was going to beat you, right?" Tony asked. "Because you know I was going to. I was just uh.. warming up, is all."
"So why don't you live in some fancy penthouse with that kind of money?" Steve wanted to know, finding it a little bizzarre that Tony would basically slum it here when he could be living the high life. Not that their apartment complex was trashy. It was just.. they cost pretty much pennies compared to what Tony could be spoiling himself with.
"Steve, thank god," Tony called as Steve moved into the apartment, heading straight for the kitchen where... oh god, where Tony was trying to cook. Steve was smiling, tentative, not sure if he should be as happy as he wanted to be. Not yet. He had to be sure. Had to- "I have a huge problem." Steve paused, more than a little nervous, and Tony went on. "I have this fucking Adonis in my bed right now, right? And I've been doing a lot of thinking and I don't actually wanna hide from this one-"
At this point Rhodey was staring at him. He'd seen Tony worked up like this twice in the eight years he'd lived next door. Once when Tony had saved a kitten from a 'vicious hell beast' (the dog had been medium sized, a mutt from what Rhodes could make out, and not really as agressive as Tony would later swear) and hadn't known what to do with it, but also hadn't wanted to keep it, and then when Tony had fallen in love with Pepper and hadn't known how to handle it. Neither time had he been able to talk Tony down, and apparently he wasn't going to try now because he just grabbed his coat.
"Stupid!" he told himself, rolling his eyes as he headed for the bathroom and a shower. "Guy hides in your apartment twice a month from one night stands and you flirt with him. Nice."
"Right," Tony breathed, licking his lip as he tried to get the very, very vivid images he'd just conjured out of his head. "Well thanks again for the uh.. safe zone. Steve. I forgot about a thing. I have. Right. See you."
Steve laughed again, silencing Tony with a kiss. "On second thought, maybe you were better with a sore throat." Steve wiggled his eye brows and leaned back into the headboard, admiring Tony for the moment. "Waiting all day to tell you I'm sorry we fought. And more importantly, that I love you. Even on our worst days, Tony. Voice or no voice. Don't you forget it."
"Brucie baby, please!" Tony cried, reaching out to take the man by the face, searching his eyes for some sort of understanding. "Steve is an adonis and if everyone wants to see my actually put the moves on, I need to do it right, and I need to make this something that's worth telling people when they ask how we got together!"
"Don't-" Tony tried, but Steve either ignored him or didn't hear. With a sigh the genius gathered his tea and another popsicle and went to hole up in the bedroom. Lab would be nice, but he felt like moping now.
Steve made a good point, and Tony stood to take off his own suit and drape it over something. Within moments he was down to his briefs, and a quick glance to Steve found those cute Iron Man boxers Tony had gotten him for Christmas revealed.
And they kissed. God, they kissed. Tony felt Steve's lips press against his own chapped, waiting ones and his fingers slid up the back of Steve's neck to tangle in his hair. Steve encouraged this, though his hands moved down rather than skyward and Tony was pleasantly surprised to learn that Steve was an ass man. The beach seemed suddenly very empty, and Tony was very aware of just how many steps it would take to get the jet where they could have a little privacy. He was factoring in how many of those steps he could bear to spend parted from Steve's lips when suddenly Steve was pulling away for air.
"Technically?" the man demanded, and Tony didn't have to look up to know that Steve was smiling at the display.
"Stop trying to change the subject, Tony," Steve retorted. Tony didn't miss the fact that he looked a little flushed. "My point is, you're looking at the stars as a whole. You can't do that. Focus on the constellations. Focus on ones that don't even exist."
"Rhodey," Tony whined as he entered the bathroom, peering under the stalls for those familiar shoes. He leaned up against the door that sheltered Rhodey from his invasion of privacy, palms flat against it as he tried to talk himself out of what he was about to do. "Can you ask Bruce to play the dancey music?"
An hour later Tony was trying to hold one of his "towers" (please, it was little more than a mound of wet sand) in place and muttering angrily under his breath. The whole team had come to watch the spectacle. It didn't help that they were all giving Steve pointers while poor Tony (poor being Tony's description of it, because they should pity him right now) was left to do it all on his own. Steve's was actually looking a lot better than earlier and Tony was starting to worry.
"Anyway!" Tony said loudly, decicind this was perhaps a little too much when he was trying to make a good fucking impression on Steve's friends, who he was meeting for the very first time, just now. First. Time. Kill him. "So these are my lovely friends, Steve, and while I'm sure they'd love to tell you all sorts of dirty little secrets about me I think it's only fair that your friends get a chance to do the same for you, right? Right."
"So, Tony." Bucky had his arm slung over tony's shoulders now as they walked towards the table, and Tony did his best to keep that calm, collected smile on his face. He wasn't nervous, not even slightly. Why should he be.
"I still say we would have had more fun at an amusement park." Tony was grumbling at Steve's side, toes twisting in the sand. They'd been here a grand total of five minutes and already Tony was full of complaints.
"Bet you didn't think I'd remember," Tony said with a wink as Steve caught his attention. "Pepperoni good with you? I will hands down order another one, but this one is already here so-"
"Did you tell him you're a recovering alcoholic who doesn't drink?" was all he asked, and at Tony's casual avoidance of eye contact Rhodey pinched his arm.
"And then in walks Captain America like he owns the place- which he doesn't, by the way, this is my lab, and you can't just-" Tony was working himself up pretty good, and his voice was getting louder as he went.
"Seriously, fuck yeah," Tony repeated, and Steve's reply was a testing thrust. Tony grunted, wanting to lift up and draw Steve down, but this positioning was definitely good. Steve had just the right angle, and as his thrusts began to pick up in pace all Tony could do was take it. His hips were rocking with Steve's momentum, and the sounds Tony was making were probably enough to wake the neighbors. Good thing the neighbors were out at the bar.
"Tony, so wonderful to see you, I always love when you practically knock down my door at weird hours. I'm not doing anything right now." To be fair, he really wasn't. Tony could tell by the fact that there was no mess on the table and that he'd answered the door right away.
Steve was sitting back on his heels now, hands on his thighs as he stared down at Tony, drinking the sight in, and Tony was starting to feel paranoid. What was he thinking? It didn't take long to get an answer, because Steve was kissing his fucking chest, and before Tony could protest Steve was biting his nipple and Tony moaned, Tony wriggled, Tony begged. They could take each other apart and draw maps later; for now he just wanted to be properly fucked.
The super soldier's shoulders began to shake with silent laughter, before he was outright chuckling, and while Natasha fixed him with a quirked brow Tony only ducked his head and tried to flee.
Tony didn't notice the way Steve watched him bend over, but that was alright because Steve didn't seem to notice when Tony returned the favor moments later. Tony did notice when Steve started to pull his shirt off, and guess who didn't bother pretending he wasn't watching? That's right, Tony Stark.
"You'd better be the guy who lives here or I am so calling the cops," the serial-break-in told him, and Steve fixed him with a very stern glare. He was aboslutely NOT fighting off laughter.
"Hey, enough of that," Tony hissed, though his voice certainly lacked conviction. "We’re already going to be late-"
"I would never!" It was obvious Tony was trying to sound shocked at the accusation, but even he didn't seem convinced. "Okay, I thought about it. You don't have any photos of yourself. I almost went searching for one. But I figured it was bad enough I was breaking into your apartment. Didn't wanna go through your stuff, too. I've been watching your Netflix."
Bucky and Nat exchanged looks, but Steve was on his phone now and so they decided to pipe down. They were gonna get to meet Tony and decide for themselves what a great guy he was. Steve just.. hoped they weren't being quiet because they were saving the wrath of shit he'd expected for the man himself.
They broke away a moment later, offering each other dazed, happy smiles, before Tony opened the passenger door. The ride home was a bit of a blur. Neither of them really said much; Tony was quietly anticipating his next move, and Steve.. well, Tony just hoped that blonde adonis was as nervous as he was. This could make or break a lot of things. All Tony knew was that he was standing outside of his apartment, and he realized that this would be Steve's first time inside. The thought had him grinning like an idiot, and he popped open the lock, switched on the light, and swept his arm out.
"Because Steve asked you to do something and you would have gone to the inside of an active volcano if it meant spending extra time with him," Clint finished with a roll of his eyes.
It didn’t take long for Steve to get back, but when he returned to the dresser he had this.. look on his face. Like something was wrong. Like.. Oh god, Tony had pushed him into this hadn’t he?
"I guess I forgot to ask you if you wanted to dance with me," Steve admitted, and Tony realized that Steve was pretty sober. There was no slur, and his blush had been just that- only a blush, not a flush from alcohol intake.
"I know the constellations," Tony grumbled, a little put off that Steve thought he wouldn't know such a simple thing. Steve didn't let that stop him, though.
"Absolutely." And maybe it was too quick of a response but fuck it. Steve was completely enthralled with Tony. He didn't need to hesitate to agree to spend more time with him. Who cared if Tony slept around and broke into his apartment all the time? He was great company.
"We better get to work on that castle, huh?" Steve ignored Tony's groan and suggestive look. Sure the jet was on his mind, too, but he figured they'd get around to that. Something told him this thing with Tony Stark was just beginning. And Steve Rogers was a patient man.
"Sure, but I mean.. you're not even doing it right." There was something Tony's tone that made Steve smile, and the Captain looked up at him.
"Hey, man, thanks for not calling the cops. You know, any of those times." Tony sounded so sincere, and Steve had to wonder if the guy had ever gotten in trouble for this. "I try not to make a habit of it. But.. sometimes people just don't like to take no for an an-"
"I'm gonna-" Tony's mouth was suddenly dry, and he tossed the rag back over his shoulder. Steve had pulled his hands from his pockets, was fiddling with his left. "Maybe he thinks we're closed," Tony said, as though Steve had given a single glance inside to check. Maybe he had, maybe Tony hadn't noticed. The sign said open, but it was empty aside from him and Rhodey at the counter. Steve was polite. He was probably trying to decide if it would be rude to walk in and ask for a booth, with Bucky of course, who was parking the car. "I'll be right back." He moved around the counter in a bit of a daze, and just as he did Steve started to turn. Like he was going to walk off. Like he couldn't take the steps towards the door, and Tony's pace picked up.
"Anthony Edward Stark, you are a grown ass man and I am using the bathroom," came Rhodey's growl in response. "You go ask him!"
Tony shivered at this, and then he dove into Steve’s lips. Tongue forced it’s way in, his hands torn between tangling in Steve’s smooth blonde hair and groping his ass. It took the genius a full thirty seconds to realize he could do both, and by then it was too late. Steve had shoved him down to the bench and with that impressive strength of his shoved the furniture and it’s burden easily up against one of the floor-to-ceiling mirrors. The look in his blue eyes was enough to make Tony groan, reaching up to yank him forward by the back of his neck. Steve accepted the movement, biting at Tony’s bottom lip, before breaking apart once more.
Steve was moaning into the rough kiss Tony offered, and didn't that just get him going? Tony was backing up, knowing exactly how to get to his bedroom from here, and Steve was following along like a lost sinner on his way to sanctuary. And fuck was he coming to the wrong place, because Tony was all about furthering their sins together. If Tony's kiss was raw, Steve's was fucking filthy. He slammed Tony into the door to his bedroom, and all Tony could do was whimper and grind against Steve, looking for any sort of friction. He was achingly hard now, ready for this to get going, thinking about how it was overdue. Luckily, Steve had control of this part, and he hooked one arm around Tony's waist before shoving the bedroom door open and backing him in until he fell on the bed.
"Working on something, something important, I don't spend nights on end down here without reason. Not without good, logical, result-producing reason-" Tony wasn't stopping, but he was getting louder.
"I mean I've done some updates," Tony admitted. "But if you think ol' Adrian'd ever let me change the place enough that it was something brand new, you weren't paying attention all the times you've been here." Quiet fell between them, comfortable and yet so strained. Tony wanted to ask questions. Steve looked like maybe he wanted to talk, but didn't know how. That was fine. There was nothing that Adrian's cooking couldn't solve, right? "Please come inside Steve," Tony suggested quietly. "It's been a while. I've been practicing how to be piss poor at serving, you'll love the attitude. It's perfected, I swear. The MacKinnon's would be pissed if I closed up before I let a customer in."
Steve hesitated, looking like he didn't know how to answer the request. Tony assumed he'd come here for a reason. Whatever had happened, maybe Steve needed to do this tonight. Even if he was afraid to step through the door, for whatever reason, Tony was here to help with that. "Alright, Tony, I'll come in. But only because Rhodey looks like he really wants to leave, and I've never gotten over him spilling my milkshake all over the table." It had been such a riot at the time; Steve wasn't angry, Steve never seemed to be angry. His tone wasn't nearly as light as he was trying to it to be, but Tony would never call him out on it.
Pepper was running late. Pepper never ran late. That was enough to make Tony worry right there. He paced his office, muttering curses, trying to organize files and make sure he had the correct documents in his briefcase for the consultation that was scheduled for fifteen minutes  from just then. He’d managed to dab a bit of concealer on the light bruise of his eye. It wasn’t as bad as he thought it’d be, but the bruise made him feel guilty all the same. He should've known not to press like that. He hated when he had to deal with it himself. He'd wanted to apologize again, but it didn't seem there was any time for it. Steve had left around the same time he’d gone up to the office, not before kissing him and telling him that he loved him. Tony was positive Steve telling him he loved him was the one thing he’d never get tired of hearing.
Tony got up and stretched, his back popping as he twisted and put his arms up. He made his way to the bathroom, scratching the back of his head. He didn’t even realize the shower was running until he was right in front of the door. It was slightly ajar, Tony smirked to himself as he pushed it open, but was stopped dead in his tracks by what he saw.
“You might have to stick around so I can fix her.” Tony hadn’t even realized the low tone of his voice until Steve was looking at him, wide eyed, his tongue darting out to wet his lips, face cast in the red glow of the traffic light. Boy was that a pretty picture.
The party was bigger than Tony’d expected it to be. He nearly broke his neck getting out to it, the path his phone told him to take had him parking a half mile away from the spot. He carried the large bottle of vodka he held it close to his chest as he haphazardly stepped over rocks and shrubs. He was rather preoccupied, had been the entire week. He hadn’t even been able to get work done, and that was a first he wasn’t entirely proud to have. Steve was going to be here. Steve who’d plucked his phone right out of his hand and put his number in it. That had to be some sort of invitation, right? Tony felt his mouth go dry at the thought. What was Steve playing at? Could it be a joke? Tony didn’t really know him personally, but he knew him enough. Steve Rogers wasn’t the type to dump pig’s blood on anyone’s head at prom--or a party-- but Tony still worried the other shoe was going to drop. Mostly because he knew he deserved it, and the universe never seemed to miss out on an opportunity to give him just what he deserved. He was broken of the thoughts when he approached the party. It was in an almost too small clearing, if one could call it that. The surrounding trees were small and rather sparse, but there was more than enough distance between this spot and the camp grounds down the trail that they might get away with the music pumping out of the speakers without a noise complaint.
“Just didn’t know why I was surprised.” Steve said simply. He was moving quickly and with intent. There was no fanfare as Steve worked his first finger into Tony’s body, nor the second. He seemed to have done this several times before, because he found Tony’s prostate immediately and relentlessly swiped at it with his long fingers.
“ Right. I’ll be there.” Tony said smiling and sitting forward. He opened his mouth to say something where there was  a knock at the door, and Pepper popped her head in.
“Doesn’t matter where I was. Walk faster.” Natasha said, practically breaking into a run. Tony trotted after her.
been thinking about it. Tony turned, scratching the back of his head just as Clint popped back up and pulled himself out of the pool.
Morgan was very confused. She was looking up at a bright blue cloud filled sky. One of the clouds looked like a fluffy white cat, which was sort of funny until she realized this was not the place she fell asleep in. She'd fallen asleep somewhere dark and damp. It smelled like wet rock and the walls made a sound like breathing. The floor was cold and wet and lined with tiny, pointy rocks.It was a bad place to be. She doesn't remember why she was there, as there was no way her Pops would even let her out of his sight.
Which would be soon. Steve grunted as Tony took both nipples between his fingers, rolling them between thumb and forefinger. Steve’s hips actually lifted up off the bed, which Tony found to be incredibly hot, seeing as he totally thought he had Steve pinned.
He made his way back to her and sat down slowly. She grabbed one of the bars and started eating immediately. Steve counted the rest of them. They’d ended up with thirty six.
With shaky hands she pulled out the camera. She sat down at her desk, looking around the office, eyes darting from Tony’s office door to the modern space around her. From the waiting room couches, to the the mini fridge stocked full of water, juice, soda and coffee. It was all familiar, yet in no way comforting. She opened the camera, taking a steading breath. She knew she couldn’t go down to the consolation with Tony. She knew now would be the only time she could prep the video file to show him. She had an hour and a half. Maybe two hours before he came back up here. He’d be angry, that’d be hard to work around. He wouldn’t want to listen to her. She’d have to figure out a way to force him.
Tony had no doubt over who would win. Armed with Tony’s weapons and guided by Steve’s tactics, the Captain’s fleet was nearly invincible.
He was a Stark. Starks were made of iron. Tony squared his shoulders, facing the tent flap with his chin held high.
“At least he doesn’t actually have horns.” Tony shifted his weight to his heels, trying to ease the pressure on his knees. It was hard to believe that this time yesterday evening he'd been getting ready to go to bed at the end of a normal, boring day. Every time he closed his eyes, he half-expected to wake up and find out this had all been an unusually vivid dream, except that his dreams involving nudity and rope had never been this damn
It was already light outside when Steve next blinked awake. He propped himself up on one elbow and looked around. Thor was flat on his back starfished out on the mattress, with Bruce’s legs over one arm and Natasha’s head resting on his thigh. Clint was on his stomach with his face shoved into Steve’s hip, and Tony was on Steve’s other side, blinking up as Steve shifted.
Steve frowned at him. Tony glared right back. Steve’s eyes softened. His mouth kicked up at the corner, his shoulders started to shake, and then he was laughing, softly at first, then harder when he saw the poleaxed outrage on Tony’s face. He ended up shaking with great big belly-laughs on the floor, slowing down gradually only to start up again every time Tony huffed at him.
Even lying down, Steve was pretty clearly capable of looking out for himself, but it was less intimidating this way, with him lying below Tony. Body language mattered. Even more than that, he’d listened to Tony and acted on his suggestion. He’d
“Call it, Cap,” Stark said, hands in his pockets, his ambivalent posture belied by the restrained eagerness in his voice. Stark probably
Tony opened his mouth, then snapped it shut, acutely aware of Steve watching his reaction. “Yeah, so, I’m just going to stay over here,” he said carefully, trying his best to keep his scent even. Their relative positions helped a lot. He didn’t have to be nervous about Steve’s size, not when he was only watching from a distance. Tony thought again of heights at a distance and perspective tricks and had to fight back a nervous giggle. Steve was turning out to be a surprisingly tolerant alpha, but Tony didn’t want to test that tolerance by appearing to laugh at his dick.
Steve let him sit up the next time he tried. He looked at Tony consideringly, then reached down to slide a fingertip between Tony’s legs, just touching over his entrance.
“ I can’t hear you, you need to speak clearly. ‘I won’t hit my kids’ It’s not hard to say, It’s kinda common sense, really.” Steve said, holding the guy further away from him. He’d loved the shirt he was wearing until the asshole had bled all over it.
“I think I’m almost done. Don’t worry about it.” He reassured, unable to tear his eyes away from Steve eating the damn popsicle- because now it was apparent he had intentions. The way he was eating the popsicle could only be described as lewd. He swirled the tip of his tongue around the top and let it trail down, then back up to the top, which he popped into his mouth with a small moan.
“I dunno, it’s anyone's guess.” Tony paused. “ Just...you know I’m here for you right? If you ever feel...if things ever feel-”
“It’s been hours,” The man in the coat started. He turned on the screen. The Kid was on it, ankles and chest strapped to a table, her arms strapped  over her head. She wasn’t conscious.
“…Because people would have to be drown to-oh, ha.” Tony said, laughing dumbly, hating himself all the while. “I haven’t really seen anybody either,” he added, trying to save himself. It didn’t work.
Once he had his bag he went out the back of the building, through the alley were the guy was laying dead. Nobody would find him until morning, it was too dark, the alley was too small for any cars to go down, and then somebody would have to actually turn their head and look, so Steve wasn’t worried. He had plenty of time. Steve made his way to the boxing gym, and from there he called a taxi. He was exhausted, as he always was after he’d finished...doing his thing. He didn’t really like doing it in the first place, but he didn’t have much of a choice. He would’ve stopped, or at least tried to stop if it hadn’t been for Tony. Steve loved him, he didn’t even want to chance hurting him. He was quick to anger, and all it took was one argument. One lapse of control for him to fuck up and ruin the best thing that ever happened to him.
“I lost my phone,” he said apologetically, looking down at his watch. “But I’m off at one fifteen…” There was a question in his voice, and Tony wasn’t entirely sure what it was but he was defiantly sure he wanted to find out. He looked down at his phone. It was twelve fifty. He’d just have to get his pancakes to go.
Flirting between them was just so damn easy. Everything between them was easy, Steve had never had that with anybody before. Tony was so….Tony. He wasn’t like a single person he’d ever met in his life.
“Where’s Steve?” Pepper asked, walking into his office. Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes, dropping the file he’d been looking at to look at her.
It was dark in the bedroom when Tony finally emerged from the workshop, asleep on his feet. It was late, much later than he said he would be. He showered in the lab bathroom, not wanting to bustle around in the room too much while Steve was sleeping. The high pressure and hot water was for once more than enough to get his brain to start slowing down. He was on auto pilot, not thinking about much of anything. He might of fallen asleep leaning against the  wall of the elevator had JARVIS not prompted him that he’d reached their floor.
“Alright, it’s fine just try for me, okay? Focus.” There was a camera on a tripod next to him. Tony pressed record. “Okay. Does the kid have a name? Anything she answers to?”
. His cock was hard, straining against his stomach, a little sticky wet spot under the head as it twitched and pulsed from whatever the hell Steve was dreaming about that had him so wound up.
do it.” There was a deciding pause, and suddenly Steve’s body heat was gone. Tony could feel him slide his hands his chest, lingering around his belt. It took him a second to realize Steve was on his knees. Tony was positive he’d never been more hard in his life. The party seemed a million years away now, as Steve made quick work of his belt. For only a second Tony’s hazy brain wondered how many times Steve had done this, he was so good, so efficient-
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, but it caught up in his throat because Steve just started moving. Immediately, hips snapping forward and back in a pace that could nearly be described as angry, but it was perfect. Tony just wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and took everything he was willing to give.
“Get your shoes, we have to go to the field.” Natasha said. She sounded desperate. Nat, even after all this time, wasn’t a person who could be read. She kept a stone face at all times, but now? The stone was broken, she looked close to tears, and that made Tony afraid. So he put on his shoes, and he and Natasha set out.
By time the conversation was over, they’d reached the tower,and Steve thanked the guy and paid, then got out of the car with a sigh. He didn’t really want to face Tony, but he did a lot of things he didn’t want to do, so he pressed the button and waited for the elevator.
“Well maybe tomorrow then?” Tony asked quickly, sitting all the way up. Steve froze in the middle of pulling his boxers on. From there he just looked tired. There were dark smudges under his eyes and he seemed a little pale, despite the fact that he spent forty two percent of his time in the sun.
“Why?” Steve froze, mid chew. His eyes narrowed, the suspicion on his face clear as day. He wasn’t going to let her stay a weapon. He wasn’t going to let anybody hurt her like that again. He owed that to her in the least. He’d die if he had to, he’d come to that conclusion a long time ago. He looked back at the screen, watching Bruce remove the tubing in the girls chest he’d never really known was there. He’d seen the port sites, but never knew what was beneath them.  He was so engrossed in the mildly bloody task that he missed the next question. He didn’t even realize there was still food in his mouth until Tony snapped his fingers in front of his face.
Tony stilled. Steve said it. They hadn’t said it yet, and Steve just said it, like it was no big deal, like they said it every night, like it was normal, and Tony had no clue what to do. He swallowed thickly and took a deep breath, trying to regulate his breathing so he wouldn’t freak Steve out. Well, he had to say it back, he had to. Steve had said it, and Tony felt it too, he loved him, more than anything he loved Steve Rogers, but when he opened his mouth to say it no sound came out. Finally, Tony cleared his throat.
“ Your guy?” He asked, lunging forward and landing two solid hits to Steve’s middle, Steve doubled over, face red.
Tony doesn’t remember the mad dash to the field. His mind only checks back in once he’s actually there. He can’t see her. Had she gone in the mere minutes it’d taken them to get there? He calls her name, and nothing happens. Some birds take off from a random tree. The wind blows. Tony looks back at Natasha, who nods to Tony's three o' clock. A little head peeps above the grass. Tony feel weak in the knees as he walks slowly in her direction, despite his every last urge being to run. He approaches her carefully, remembering his own disorientation on arrival.
The room erupted. Steve took a single breath in, and let out a choked sob of relief. Tony, who’d been a coil of tense energy beside him,  punched the air and let out a cry of victory. He leaned close to speak in his ear.
“You-ah-you sure are t-taking your time.” Steve says, cracking an eye open. Tony doesn’t even reply. He just spins him around so he has to brace his hands on the wall, spreads his ass and sinks inside the hot, welcoming space. The both groat. Steve’s rim flutters around him, and Tony starts moving immediately, hard thrusts that jerk little ‘
“What’re ya doin’ up?” Steve mumbled, sitting up and squinting at him sleepily with his good eye. Tony smiled at all the Brooklyn in his voice, it came out the most when he was tired or not paying attention.
"You saw that, huh? " There was a long pause, Tony stared off into space. Steve moved on the the next stage of sandwich making. He looked behind him, the Kid was watching something on Clint's phone. His heart leapt when he saw her place a hand on his forearm. He saw him jump a little, then smile and nod.
“Night Tony. “ Steve muttered, pulling him closer, wrapping his arms around his middle and resting his head on his shoulder. Tony smiled.
