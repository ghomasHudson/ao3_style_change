It took a good half an hour for the blood results but the second John saw the results his eyes went wide and a huge smile came over his mouth. “Well it’s certain.”
‘Speak of the devil’ John thought to himself as he smiled at his friend, slightly thankful they could pause their conversation, or so he thought.
John smiled big as he watched the interaction and thought he even saw a small smile on his partners face. Now if only to get him to turn around on talking to his parents and the wedding idea.
“John maybe you can go down to the corner shops and buy knew biscuits these things look ghastly.” She said plucking one off the plate and looking at it in distain.
“Hush.” John said as he got a needle ready so he could take the blood he needed for the pregnancy test. He had debated on if he should do a urine test or a blood test and had decided to do both. This of course frustrated Sherlock.
Sherlock almost bounded out of the police station and out to the curb to hail a cab. On their way home he did something almost unheard of…for Sherlock anyway.
Once inside everybody quickly got a cup of tea and sat in the sitting room to drink it. It was Mr. Holmes that realized something wasn’t quite right with his son. “Are you back on the drugs?” he questioned bluntly.
John sat up his eyes wide, was Sherlock really going to talk on the phone rather than continue to jerk him off? Oh this was so not good.
John had to admit that was true, “Well as long as it’s not a bloody gigantic hound I am okay.” He then made a face. “It’s not a gigantic chicken is it?”
John was hesitant at first before shrugging his shoulders. “I get how you are…I knew how you were before I agreed we were going to start our relationship.”
John looked from the monitor and to Sherlock. “Oh yes everything is fine.” He patted his boyfriend on the leg in reassurance. “Do you want a picture?”
Sherlock moved his hands away from his face and looked at Mary, his eyes actually looking sad and full of expression. “Why should he stay?”
John finished his sentence in his blog and waited for Sherlock who was taking his sweet time. “Probably doing his hair.” He said to himself.
Sherlock sighed and looked at John who looked back at him in encouragement. “Oh for goodness sake.” He said throwing his hands up in the air, thankfully the glass had been put down at some point. “I’m blood pregnant.”
Sherlock was silent for a minute…a very long minute in John’s mind but when he spoke up he was a bit shocked.
“Seriously Man, stop it.” John said as he walked over and rubbed at Sherlock’s back trying to get the heaving under control.
Sherlock shook his head in the negative. “You said I’m precious…what in the world is THAT supposed to mean?”
“I would rather not.” John admitted sympathetically. “But seriously Sherlock can we REALLY talk about this now?”
“It is normal for him to do that and I just haven’t noticed?” Greg questioned not listening to John’s warning.
“So we’re having a baby?” John questioned, ready to spew many words of protest if Sherlock mentioned anything about terminating the pregnancy.
Sherlock looked at the calendar and then glanced quickly at his stomach another thing that did not go unnoticed but the doctor but thankfully in another way.
“John you might want to let him have what he wants.” Greg said speaking up from behind his menu, ready to get smacked if that was to come next. Thankfully it didn’t.
John smiled big, this was the reaction he was hoping for. Mr. Holmes walked over and patted John on the back. “Good job.” He said and smirked.
“That was slightly peculiar.” John said as he helped Sherlock to his feet. “I don’t think I have EVER seen you sick before…let alone vomiting.”
John took a deep breath and let it out his nose. “Sherlock you are NOT eating ice cream and blackberry pie for dinner.”
John heard Sherlock and was beyond shocked at his boyfriend’s admission. “Sherlock…you know that is not true. Plus you don’t even look pregnant.”
<><><><><><> “I’ve had enough for one day.” Sherlock practically whined from where he was lying on the couch looking up at the ceiling. “Tomorrow?”
Mrs. Holmes answered the door and squealed in delight to see her youngest son standing at the entry to her home. “Oh Sherlock it’s so good to see you!”
They could talk all day about dog parts where there was food but the mention of the food had Sherlock running towards the bathroom at breakneck speed.
John had NO idea where the suggestive comments were coming from but quite frankly he felt proud for ‘knocking’ up Sherlock…not that it took much effort obviously because they sure as heck hadn’t been trying. Realizing Sherlock was expecting an answer or comment or something he did. “I don’t see it as being bad. We’re in a committed relationship, we just happened to have sex and bingo.”
“You make it sound like I did one of your evil science experiments on your insides.” John said with a slight laugh. “Sherlock you seriously need to get used to this being pregnant thing or you’re not going to have any fun.”
This caught Sherlock’s attention and he looked at his boyfriend with a raised eyebrow. “Is she telling the truth?”
The elderly woman came to the door and was shocked to see the two smiling men. John actually smiling a true smile and Sherlock an awkward one but a smile non-the-less. “John…Sherlock, normally I come to YOUR flat.” She said as she moved out of the way so they could come inside.
I am completely awful when it comes to writing cases so that is why these will come off as completely ridiculous...totally apologize if you were looking for a fic with great cases but this is more about Sherlock and John and the fun I am having with them *evil laugh*.
“Sherlock it really isn’t that big of a deal.” John said getting exasperated by the whole topic because quite frankly all the talk of sex turned HIM on.
Sherlock pouted a little, “You make it sound like I have never found a woman attractive or that I have never had sexual intercourse.” He pointed at his stomach. “I have proof.”
“I do…want to.” Sherlock and when he could tell she needed more of an explanation he tried to give one. “I just don’t have the same desires he does.”
Shaking himself out of his shock Sherlock shook his head. “Nothing…I’m fine.” He answered the question he knew the doctor was going to ask next. “
John looked up from where he was typing his blog with a raised eyebrow. “Since when are you hungry?”
“Do I?” John questioned with his eyebrow raised. “I’m not sure that I do because you sure as hell never tell me.”
The plan was to talk to Mrs. Hudson but once they got back to the flat Sherlock noticed something right away. “Fuck.” He uncharacteristically cursed.
‘Right he’s embarrassed’ John thought to himself but nodded to Sherlock. They got a cab and took it home in silence. Both men needing time to think things through…but both were thinking on the same topic.
“You know when you talked about wanting something cute and cuddly a few weeks ago we should have bought a chinchilla.” Sherlock said. “Would require less vomiting on my part.”
“I never thought I would see the day when Sherlock Bloody Holmes is planning to wear sweat pants out in public.” John said with a chuckle but held his hands up in defense when Sherlock gave him a death glare.
Sherlock flopped into his chair again and steepled his hands looking pensive but to those who knew him they could tell he was upset about something.
“Sherlock you know I love you and you know that you can be honest with me.” John said reaching over and taking his boyfriend’s hand.
“God help us all.” Sherlock groaned as they walked into the building and up the stairs to the flat. Sure enough there was Mycroft sitting on the couch and flipping through the pages of a book…a pregnancy book.
“Sherlock you cannot compare sexual hormones with morning sickness.” Mary said as if reading his mind. “You should enjoy it while you’ve got it if you don’t normally have it.”
John caught on and looked over at what the other man was looking at. It was simply another one of the disgusting cow pictures. “What is so impressive about that one?”
Sherlock sat in bed with wide eyes. He was quiet for a second before replying. “Why do all those things lead you to believe I am lying to you?”
Sherlock’s face turned from a pout to a look of frustration. “I like sex and have always liked sex.”
Sherlock sighed and shook his head, he couldn’t believe how dense his boyfriend could be at times. “John the pregnancy test is for me. My period is five weeks late.”
Caught off guard about what to say Sherlock actually stumbled around his words. “I…I did this time, special case…very special about…about.”
Sherlock surprisingly wasn’t thinking about anything to do with termination. Actually his mind was on vomiting…not at that exact moment but in the future. Realizing he should probably answer John’s question he nodded his head, “We’re having a baby.”
John cursed the inspector and glanced to the kitchen before whispering to Mary. “You can’t let him know you know. He hates that Greg knows and has threatened bodily harm if I tell anybody else.”
When they arrived at police headquarters Greg was just about as pleased as John to hear that Sherlock was there for a case. “You’re bloody pregnant.” He hissed quietly so nobody else could hear. He wasn’t sure who Sherlock told but figured out the other detectives did not.
“There is nothing wrong with being horny.” John assured his partner. “Actually it is perfectly normal for your hormones to be exacerbated during the first trimester.”
As they pulled up to 221B John paid the cabbie and walked with Sherlock up the stairs and into their flat. At this point Sherlock had ended his call with the Detective Inspector and was heading straight for the bedroom to pack.
It seemed like Sherlock was living in his night clothes recently so John planned on changing that. Sherlock grumbled something about comfort and pregnant people as he went upstairs.
At first John had no idea what Sherlock was talking about and then got it. “Maybe you should really start taking a break from cases…” he said gently but by the look on Sherlock’s face he knew he made the wrong choice, especially sitting in a cab neither of them being able to run if things got heated…and not in a good way.
Sherlock was a big shocked by the lack of words his boyfriend was using. “Everything alright?” he meant with the baby but assumed he could be asking John too.
“Okay.” Sherlock simply said before heading out of the bathroom and then out of the bedroom with his suitcase in tow. He sat it down in the sitting room and then sat down himself to wait for Lestrade to pick them up.
“So we are keeping dog…members…in our refrigerator because they need to stay cold.” John said not sure why he was even asking for clarification. “Any reason it’s not in the freezer?”
The older Holmes shook his head, “No need to tell me. It is all here in this book and written all over your face.”
“Are you ready to leave? If we’re going to get to Baskerville by dark we need to leave.” John said still not sounding thrilled but felt like he owned it to Sherlock to go since he had spilled their news all over the station.
John must have been swallowing some siliva because he started choking. When he finally was able to talk he looked at Sherlock in shock. “YOU…Sherlock Holmes went five weeks without a period without telling me without getting a bloody test?”
John moved so he was sitting IN the chair and looked at Sherlock like he had gone completely insane. “YOU need a pregnancy test. What for a case? And if so why can you not go pick it up yourself?”
“Maybe.” Sherlock said finding himself not as excited about this case as he thought he would be…as he should be. “I haven’t eaten anything since my parent’s house.”
This caused John to start coughing on his own saliva and caused Sherlock to have to pound him on the back to gain his breath back.
Meanwhile Sherlock was busy heaving everything he had eaten that day, which hadn’t been much, into the toilet bowl, his hands gripping the sides leaving marks. He was getting so violently ill that he had tears running down his cheeks mixing with the sweat from his brow.
“Sherlock?” John called through a mouthful of his sandwich. He then put the food down and dashed after his boyfriend. He found him in the bathroom off of the now ‘master’ bedroom…their bedroom now that they actually were sharing a room much to Mrs. Hudson’s delight. “Oh Sherlock.” He said gently as he got him a wet towel and a glass of water for when he was fished.
John rolled his eyes at his almost functionally mute boyfriend. “He is pregnant, we found out yesterday.”
<><><><><><><> Sherlock was actually thankful for the crazy conversation for dog private parts because it caused him to forget about why the calendar was off the wall and sitting on the counter top. But the moment John mentioned it his furious counting and crying spell came flooding back to him.
“I wish.” Sherlock said smirking some more. He was about to say something else when his cell phone started ringing in his coat pocket. “Lovely.” He said removing his hand and going to answer the phone. “hello?”
They were arguing about continuing their conversations with friends and family. They still had yet to talk to Mrs. Hudson since Mycroft had made an appearance. John wanted to get her ‘over with’ so they could focus on Mrs. And Mrs. Holmes. That of course was still something Sherlock was completely against.
“What is going on?” Lestrade questioned as he walked in the flat just in time to see Sherlock grab the bin and start violently vomiting into it. “Weak stomach all of a sudden Sherlock.” He teased not realizing how truthful that was.
Mr. Holmes came to the door and looked surprised to see Sherlock and John. “Sherlock, son this is a surprise.” He said and then ushered them inside since Mrs. Holmes had yet to do so and they had been standing on the stoop.
“Excuse me?” John’s mind was still on his and Sherlock’s pervious conversation so he thought she was on that same topic somehow.
This story of course is semi-AU but I am trying to fit with cannon at least a little bit. This chapter might seem a bit off because I am still currently watching the Sherlock episodes and this chapter was written after the beginning (damn having to pause it to do homework!) of Season 3 episode 1 and through the end of episode 2. SOOO if things seem weird like characters are off and mentioned off kilter I apologize and just remind you that I have Sherlock pregnant so that is just odd anyway HAHA!
“Jesus Christ John!” Sherlock exclaimed almost literally jumping out of his skin. He had been so deep in thought about John coming home and composing himself the he had actually missed said man coming home.
“Oh…oops.” John laughed again still thinking the looks his boyfriend was giving him were hilarious. “Come on we have parents to surprise.”
“Right.” John grabbed his shoes and began putting them on before doing the same with his jacket. It was a nice spring day but he never knew about the London weather it could easily start pouring on his short trek down the street. “Be back then.”
Sherlock couldn’t help but shiver at the feeling of John’s hands on his skin. “I simply thought you should know what my body is doing…just in case something is wrong.”
Sherlock smirked as he continued his stroking, it was a bit hard to do with John still wearing all of his clothes but they couldn’t do anything about the cab.
“This is an absolutely ridiculous idea.” Sherlock said as they got out of the car in front of his parent’s house. He stood by the front gate staring at the house with pure misery on his face.
“Ha Ha!” John called after him before going into the kitchen to find something to eat. Of course when he opened the refrigerator he wasn’t surprised to find some sort of severed body part. This time though it wasn’t a body part of a human but of…was that a dog’s…? “Sherlock!”
“It IS a research facility who knows what the heck they are up to.” John pointed out as he finished filling his suitcase and placed it on the floor once he zipped it.
John sighed, “Sherlock we have sex like once a month, quite frankly I am unsure how you got pregnant in the first place.”
Sherlock lay on his back on the examination table his eyes wide as he looked at the sonogram screen. “That’s a baby.” He stated rather stupidly…something Sherlock Holmes was not.
John was a bit surprised at this but nodded his head as he leaned in the doorway of the bathroom while Sherlock used the toilet. “You’ve gotten less modest.” He said just as a statement.
Not wanting to get on that topic right then Sherlock changed the subject. “We can tell Mrs. Hudson tonight….get it out of the bloody way.”
“Oh my goodness you’re getting married this is so wonderful!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed practically bouncing in place, not realizing she was congratulating them for the wrong thing.
Mycroft found the whole thing rather amusing but realized the time and stood up. “I must leave, but I will keep on you to talk with Mother and Father.” With that he sat his teacup on the coffee table and headed out of the flat.
They were heading in the direction of Baker Street, John looking out the window and Sherlock seemed to be doing the same thing when all of a sudden there was a hand in John’s lap, squeezing. John couldn’t help the squeak that escaped his lips. “Sherlock!”
Sherlock grunted when his mum grabbed ahold of him and hugged him so tightly he was sure he would go into labor right then. Of course he was NOWHERE near time for that sort of thing but he was being overdramatic like always. “Mum stop.” He said after close to 2.56 minutes of cuddling.
“You are a queen.” Sherlock said with his best smirk and stomped out of the sitting room to go use the loo. He swore he was using the darn bathroom every five minutes.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he took the cup and went and did his business in the bathroom off to the side of the examination room. He blushed when he brought back the almost full cup.
“You told your mother you weren’t having sex?” John tried not to laugh but it was almost impossible to do. When Sherlock nodded his head John shook his own. “Well my friend she’s going to wonder how that little baby got inside of you.”
John threw his hands up in the air, “Well there is no way in hell I am going to work this morning without getting you your test. Actually no I am not going to get a test.”
Mary groaned, “The sexual urges. If you are worried you will lose John because of it then I would be using it while you have it…not that he would leave anyway.”
“What is with us having animal related cases recently? First the chinchilla and then the five footed cat.”
Both Mary and Sherlock looked at John like he needed to be carted off to the funny farm right that second.
So much for three days of work, during which he subsisted on bagged blood provided by Mycroft (in both the immediate and original sense, he suspected) and delivered by Anthea, and worked around the clock until his third batch was ready. At least by that point he had the synthesis and compounding process down to an art, and had doubled the amount of pills he made in that round. After three nearly sleepless days holed up in Molly’s lab, he had a year’s worth of pure blood-substitute pills. He had carefully cleaned his glassware, packed everything away into foam-lined cases, and hied himself back to Baker Street with the fruits of his labors.
It was a very, very sharp knife, Sherlock deduced dully, because the man was hardly applying any pressure this time either, and yet the (he forced down the word, not allowing himself to think it) was almost more than he could take. Why were there so many damn nerve endings on the skin of his nose anyway? Must remember to ask John at the first opportunity.
and figure that’s as good as I’m probably going to get with my damn hands shaking so much and hit SEND
The older man finally took pity and settled between the younger man’s thighs. In one fluid motion, he slowly pressed into Sherlock, drawing out loud moans from both of them.
“We’re not really,” I say, to put this silly idea out of her head. Drain the tea, grab coat and umbrella, head towards the door.
No, no what if. If (WHEN, some part of my mind insists, he said WHEN not if when he left) he comes back it’s going to be like last time, appearing out of nowhere, all barely concealed glee at his newest disguise, crowing about how long he’s been following me around without me noticing--
By the time the cab stopped in front of a brick townhouse in Muswell Hill, John had the beginnings of a plan and Sherlock just wanted it to be over. He shivered and wrapped the Belstaff more tightly around himself—John mustn’t notice. John must never suspect. The sooner this was over, the sooner he could get at the bottle of pills that he had stashed at the back of his sock index. Normally he didn’t go out on crime investigations without at least one or two hidden in an inside pocket of his coat, but he had forgotten them this morning, and—damn. And it had been about twenty-four hours since his last pill, and he already had chills, which gave him approximately an hour and a half before hypothermia started to set in.
It hasn’t happened again since then. I don’t know what he was trying to say with that message, but I’m listening now, Sherlock.
“This is hardly a kidnapping,” Mycroft pointed out. “Perhaps I fancied a…pint.” He gestured at the glass of amber ale in front of him.
Hardly ideal, but: make do. Deal with these two, and then retrieve the stash of supplies that is (hopefully) still hidden in a hollow in another tree, then get out. Spite Mycroft with survival.
“I don’t care what he wanted,” John said, as he put an arm under Sherlock’s less-injured shoulder and dragged him to his feet.”Disinfecting and dressing this disaster-” John waved at Sherlock “-is going to be painful for both of us and not a trivial amount of work, and I’d rather not do it here. We are leaving now, and you are going to stand up and try to walk.“
“After I wrote that letter I couldn’t stop thinking about the soldier who might get it,” Sherlock said, ignoring John’s words entirely. “I would make up stories in my head where I would somehow meet him, what he would be like, look like.” He paused, and something in his expression had become vulnerable, almost shy.
Sherlock must have realized he’d given something away, because he closed his eyes immediately and bit.
Apparently my lack of a reply spurs Lestrade into further loquaciousness; that, or he has nothing better to do while standing at a crime scene because he’s completely forgotten how to solve crimes on his own.
“I don’t know where he is, frankly” is what comes out instead of something well thought out, because it’s the truth. I haven’t seen Sherlock since he got on a plane six months ago after shooting someone who in my opinion seriously deserved it. So far I’ve managaed to put Lestrade off with endless repetitions of “he said he’d  be back soon when I talked to him Friday“ while I identify the cause of death of some poor sod (which I’m sure he already knew, there is an actual medical examiner at the police after all) and pretend I have to be at the surgery before he starts asking too many questions about Sherlock. Because I haven’t talked to him Friday, I haven’t talked to him at all in months, haven’t heard anything from him in any way that I can figure out. No emails, no phone calls, nothing at all.
“Yeah, I started recording them after the second one,” Lestrade replied. “I am an actual detective, you know. ” Lestrade tapped his phone a few times, then turned up the volume and held it up so they could hear better.
“Good,” John replied. At some point he had unbuttoned his cuffs, or maybe he had never refastened them after last night, Sherlock couldn’t be sure, and then John’s wrist was pressed against his lips and John, John, John was the only thought he could keep in his head.
“You UTTER COCK! Do you have any idea what you did to him, hm?” John was aware that he was yelling at this point, but did not care in the slightest. “Going on about how Slytherin was the only house worth being in, and him getting sorted into Hufflepuff-I was there, the hat didn’t even touch his head, with a sorting that sure you must have had some idea beforehand how it would go--” John paused, sucking in a long breath. “He cried for months first year but I guess you wouldn’t know that, and he’s still ashamed of being a Hufflepuff THREE YEARS ON and that’s on you, you bloody git. THA’S ON YOU.”
This time, he swiped the rosin across the bow in a series of quick jerks, no patience for preparation. He needed this now and if the sound was a little ragged, if the bow ground and slid against the strings more roughly than he usually liked, well, maybe he needed that a little right now too. Needed the ugliness, the scratch as the slightly gritty bow first touched the strings.
“N-no––no, of course not,” the doctor answered as he stepped aside to let Sherlock pass through the door. He followed behind Sherlock as the taller man walked into the living room.
Sherlock muttered something that sounded suspiciously like “do you not know what Google is,” and John stifled a laugh.
Sherlock was intimately familiar with all of John’s smiles. He had a large library in his mind palace dedicated to John’s smiles alone.
As always, I'll repeat my call for beta readers: I'm getting back into writing fanfic after a several year break, so if anyone wants to beta read I will seriously consider all offers!
“It’s deeper than I thought,” John said as he finished with the iodine. “I’d feel better about this if you let me put a few stitches – eight at the most. It’s not long but it’s deep. ”
And so here Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective and sometime vampire, found himself lying on the floor of his sitting room at nine o’clock on a Saturday morning, feeling as warm and cosy as if he were wrapped in a wool blanket in front of a roaring fire.
“Is this?” John asked, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s (also floury) waist and drawing him in for a hug.
John sighed. “Look, I know you mean well, mate, but I have it on pretty good authority that he doesn’t feel things that way, ok?” John said.
“R-right––right drawer,” Sherlock whimpered, mesmerized by the sight of John’s strong and compact body.
“Ha!” Sherlock scoffed. “Splendid advice from a man who married an assassin. An assassin who lied about everything––including a child who wasn’t even yours!”
He went to the door and checked that it was locked, then turned out the lights and got into bed, tucking the covers around himself like a caterpillar, and waited to see whether he would fall asleep before the yelling stopped.
His stomach turned and he found himself scrabbling backwards with revulsion, the word NO screaming through his mind. He wasn’t conscious of actually screaming, but he must have, because a voice from behind him chuckled.
“What’s your point, Donovan?” John asked tiredly. First Lestrade, now Donovan….The taunting was getting old.
He left after that, he just left with John spiraling in his seat with the kitchen a mess of spilt milk and a boiling kettle. John didn’t even bother calling after him; he just stood up, turned the kettle off, cleaned up the milk and went to bed. He was not ready to dealing with anymore nonsense today.
The reason I chose this is due to the idea in this universe that merfolk are not exactly the most "emotional" species, so to them they give one another the mark to mate and it will fade after a few days. Yet with these two, it is different as they are able to develop feelings over time, and so the marks develop with them.
Sherlock quickly made his way down the few steps to the lower level of the deck and back to his cabin. The thought of lying down with John for just a few more minutes gave him enough will to quicken his pace.
Sherlock and John were laid down opposite to him on a settee, tangled and curled up within each other’s arms. John’s hand rested within Sherlock’s tousled curls, while Sherlock’s rested along the apex of John’s shoulder, having found its way through difficult ties and shirt layers to rest against the warm skin. Gentle breaths intermingled as their heart rates slowed to a tender patter, and they soon fell asleep without any care to the movement and noise around them.
Sherlock was the first to slip away, but not for the reason John expected. He allowed the waves to lap against his skin as Sherlock kept a hold on John and kept their fingers interlocked before a gentle pull of John’s arm motioned him further to the edge.
He moved away to retreat into the comfort of his own chair, his chin likely purposely rested against his left hand as every so often, John watched as the slightest glimpse of gold along with a shimmering blue stone managed to catch his eye while Sherlock seemingly paid it no mind.
“John, you’re not observing again, but it’s fine. I’m tired and miss things too. Your blanket, me holding your arm, I literally hit you in the jaw when you yanked your arm away… What does that tell you?”
The anxiety what he hoped was only a passing thought became more prevalent as the seconds ticked by without a hint of breath from him. He could feel the will in his body begin to slip away, the urge to fall on the ground beside him and curl in on himself was tremendous that he hardly noticed the waving breath that fogged his mirror.
John swiftly asked for a gin and tonic while Mycroft had a whiskey on the rocks. This allowed the rather bored looking man to swiftly leave their presence quicker than most would so both men could turn their attentions back to one another.
He did his best to keep quiet as he pushed the door open, silently cursing himself when the door made a horrific squeak as it swung wide to reveal Captain Holmes working on straightening a chair when he looked over to John. An obviously tired smile met John’s eyes as he walked in. “Ah John, I was expecting to have a little more time to finish up but, since you’re here you can tell me what you think.”
He did not turn to him as he slipped off his shoes and tossed them off into a place to be forgotten later.
“I look at you, and I just love you, and it terrifies me. It terrifies me what I would do for you.” -Anonymous
John could only let out a shaking breath as his gaze turned down once again to the bed. His stare only lingered on it for a moment before he returned to look back to Sherlock with an unstable gaze.
“That is not the point, Mycroft. You of all people, someone who hardly comes to visit me because you claim it’s too far, suddenly is up on land even with the constant siren that is your voice that constantly says ‘I despise legwork’.”
He quietly groaned as he moved to rub his eyes open, glancing up to Lestrade with a tired smile as he stood up to dress without a second thought of the awkward situation between the two other men in the room.
The clerk returned to look at John shake his head his assumption. “I’m afraid I am just a doctor, my lad.”
I will happily accept multiple requests from the same person, as someone asked and I completely forgot to add it in
The soundless voice that lingered between them as Sherlock made his way to the bed and sat down. His head dropped down into his hands less than a second later.
It was clear that he was no longer speaking to Mycroft, and it was now Mycroft’s turn to silently endure listening to John’s pain as he stood awkwardly in the hospital corridor.
They were so close to the door, and John was so tempted to run out and find his own path to the dock by himself, but something did not settle with him. It all felt too simple, too put together.
(Also, another explanation that a gave to someone who asked. maybe this will also help bc I am horrible at explaining)
Lestrade seemed confident enough to understand that this was not Sherlock’s normal bout of irritable morning attitude, and soon set down his papers to walk closer to him.
“Hey, hey, don’t try to move too much.” The same hand rested on Sherlock’s side and carefully righted his position in bed. A quick movement of wires and he was right back where he started, with his gaze now locked on John’s own.
John once again pulled Sherlock closer to himself, a comforting hand trailed down Sherlock’s spine as John could almost sense the nervousness that ran through him.
“I do, I’m afraid it has been an all too common occurrence. Speaking of proper medical attention, how is your hand?”
The pain of his hands slamming down on the old wood of the window ceil drew him away from the cool night air, his legs gave away just as he made his way back to his chair, the cigarette case sat temptingly beside him, yet only cast another dark shadow upon his wall. His hand moved to rest on his bitten shoulder, the darkened marks dipped into his skin gave him some comfort while the impending feeling of doom began to loom within those shadows.
No one stopped to turn back to Mycroft, to check on the guard that now laid dead on the cobblestone laden ground, nothing else seemed to matter in that moment.
I've decided to start adding little quotes that go with each chapter, I will do my best to add others to the previous chapters but from now on I will do my best to have a new one to fit the theme of the chapter. Almost like a little preview for you to read into
“If I’m not mistaken, this is the part in the myth when the beautiful merman lures their victim to the water to drown them.”
His brother went still for a moment, another cigarette had found its way to his lips and his lighter sat limply in his palm as he allowed the smoke from his lungs to blow out between them.
A small shiver of repulsion ran through Sherlock at the reminder that he lived away from the rest of their pod. He knew Mycroft had a very similar situation to his, but he seemed to accentuate the fact that Sherlock was especially alone.
John could see the way the man’s nostrils flared at his retort, the way his fist tightened around the mahogany wood of his cane, before the flame that burned in his eyes eventually settled onto its embers. “No, I recently have come to the conclusion, as much as it pains me, that you in fact will not be tried for treason and hanged.”
“Well, of course I want that, but how will you…” He took a glance towards Mycroft, and he could have sworn all of the salvia in his throat evaporated at just the slightest idea of how this was to happen. “Oh…”
John was too tired for this right now. He could not put up with some petty silent treatment that Sherlock thought was necessary at this time of night.
He lightly pushed Victor away from him, as much as he hated to, yet the pit of his stomach felt painful at his touch.
Mycroft did not move, and instead only softened his expression in an attempt to appeal to his younger brother.
Over the last few months, Sherlock’s experiments had begun to get out of hand. They spread throughout the kitchen and often into their sitting room to where John often found himself waking up to the smell of burning hair, or would find the dishes needed extra sanitization after he left eyeballs on them for too long.
“Just… Can you do that again? Any time I have another one of these episodes, just hit some sense into me alright?”
The ride home was anything but settling, as someone who was completely new to the experiences of life that he was now to live in, Sherlock was stood from his seat at every moment, watching the people that they passed by. His eyes scanning the figures that they passed by in quick succession, the multitude of observations and questions building up in his head, many of which likely should go unasked.
Sherlock was then hastily shoved into an empty cabin, the door shut and locked behind him without a second to spare. Tears rapidly made their tumble down his cheeks without giving him even a moment to breathe; his throat was on fire, his gaze hazy as he collapsed onto the floor in front of the door, and silently wept as the world continued just outside around him.
The front door to 221B was slammed behind them as they made their way up the stairs, Sherlock silently walked to his room when they made it inside their apartment with John not far behind.
century artist would give to their depiction of the devil, with a long and thin base that led to a spade shaped end. which seemed closely accurate to the man’s own personality.
He glanced behind him every so often, and he swore he could see that the breeze blew silky and ink-coloured curls into view from behind the stone that peaked from the sea.
“Ugh, I know what I said John! I’ve been reminded of that for the last two days by the both of you,” He quickly pulled off the handkerchief in disgust before rubbing his face.
This chapter is a continuation of last chapter, after this I won't post any more of this story in the request fill. I am working on making it its own story called "There is nothing new under the sun" and the first chapter should be posted within a week. I have a new request in so it might take a little longer than expected while I fill it.
(I forgot to mention - John has a short tail, something like a goat's if I remember correctly and Sherlock had what I imagined a devil's tail would look like.)" -Shadowsoul_954
John couldn’t help but let out a small laugh as he pulled Sherlock closer to him and pressed a kiss to his lips.
Sherlock’s pale blue eyes locked with the man’s cold, dark ones and he knew in that moment he was meant to be dropped. Whether he would let go of his fingers before he did, or it he would break them off by holding them down before the fall was a question he didn’t know the answer to.
The criminal then grabbed Sherlock by the scruff of his neck and dragged him up to meet face-to-face, his foot kept a firm hold on his fingers and they bent painfully to accommodate for the stretch in his arm.
John would likely wait for the guard to make his way closer to him, as the range on his weapon was hardly useful in any other situation. Sherlock would say 20 paces would be where he would raise his weapon.
I literally completely forgot to add this at the end, but the description and name of the Helen Stoner are all Arthur Conan Doyle and his absolutely insane descriptions of people. In no way can I take credit for that imagination
Sherlock still did not move from his position, it was only when John gently tapped him on the forearm that he quickly turned around, hit John in the face with the tie on his dressing gown, and climbed up on the table before he stepped over every piece of furniture they had.
That guilt easily drained from his body as Holmes leaned in close to his ear, his hushed words caused John to strain to hear him over the violence around them. He would later wished he hadn’t.
He only got a sleepy laugh in response as Sherlock wrapped tighter around him. John was now stuck to that sofa until Sherlock decided to wake up or until his arm was crushed by his serpentine like grip.
“Just… for the love of everything could you stop stealing my groceries and replacing them with your things from the morgue? It’s unsanitary and we’re liable to get some sort of illness from this!”
Sherlock hesitantly moved to hold onto his shoulder as he sat down on what used to be his bed and Victor followed suit. The slightly possessive grip Sherlock held onto himself told Victor to just drop it.
“Come on, kid. I know you’re not asleep. I’m not going to play this game with you again, so we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.”
“Yyep.” He let the p to make a pop as his tail moved again to pick up a cup of tea that he’d made earlier, which he soon took from it and had a sip.
“John, I may not participate in the belief that there’s some higher deity waiting for all of us once we die, but I know enough to know that you were not
“Oh I am incredibly angry, I am possibly more pissed off than I have ever been in my entire life, but that’s not going to get in the way of us dealing with this and talking through it. Not again.”
He set his bag down and swam over to him, his hands moved to gently cup his face as his thumbs traced along the outline of his jaw. He moved to rest his face within inches of Victor’s, and allowed their noses to lightly brush against one another. The simple movement seemed to ease Victor’s nerves as he gave him another small smile; a simple reassurance that he would be back soon, before he gathered his things and swam away.
He felt himself nearly leap from his skin when he looked into the water to see a dark tail pass underneath his reflection. The animal it belonged to must’ve been an absolute behemoth of a creature to possess such a tail. Perhaps it was a dolphin that had been washed into the dock, or possibly even a shark.
“Yes, there is Sherlock! This stuff could kill you, how the hell do you not understand that after all this time?”
He let out a small sigh before he turned his attention back to the phone, took in a quick breath, and hit answer before he held the phone to his ear.
Sherlock took notice of his new appendages a little later when he removed his head from its contented resting place, and stared down at them as though he had never seen anything like them before. He unconsciously allowed a hand to move over the pale, smooth skin and drew his legs up to his chest before he turned his attention to John with one of the happiest smiles, he had ever seen him have. It was practically contagious.
“...Holmes, I meant Captain Holmes... I apologise, my mind just slipped a moment.” He looked John in the eyes for an uncomfortably long while before finishing up making the bed. The silence seeming to last for ages until Greg was finished.
John was just about to give another retort, when the nurse popped her head in through the entryway with a light knock on the door. A quick warning that John needed to leave soon was enough to make them separate.
me. If any other person sat on this dock that day and I spoke to them, I would likely be dead or in a tank traveling across the world…”
He turned his attention back to his work, as he attempted to ignore the sinking feeling of there being something more behind Lestrade’s intentions than just to scare John off “for his own good”.
He was nearly to the door, so close to his small world where there was only one other thing that mattered, when he saw
“But I don’t want it to change… I… I liked it how it was…” His head moved to rest on his book and his body turned away from Mycroft, this welling pain inside him began to grow up his chest and into his throat. A constricted agony that hardly allowed him to swallow as his hands gripped his book so tightly, he thought he was about to rip it in half.
“Ah, there’s our sleeping beauty. Now, how about you eat something?” He nodded towards a tray of food he had set on a table, along with a glass of water.
“Alright… I suppose- “He was swiftly yanked from the small shop and had to practically run to keep up the impression that he was not currently being dragged through the street by an absolute stranger. His cane trailed behind uselessly in his hand.
It was difficult to remember which one of them pressed their lips to the others, and it didn’t seem to matter in that moment as they leaned into the gentle touch of soft skin that brushed against the other. John was the first to pull away, mainly to catch his breath but to also comprehend what just happened.
He took a deep breath, his focus soon returned to cleaning his tools and placing them in their correct order. His mind quickly emptied by the menial task inside of the nearly silent room.
The line appeared to go dead after that, the only sound that confirmed John could still hear him was the shaking breaths that came from John’s end before he made a sound that Mycroft could only understand as crying.
He turned back to John, a slight anxiety hanging between them once again as it was down to Greg’s decision. John held the note tighter than he would’ve care to as their eyes met and the softness in the man’s eyes that met his own gave him more relief than any glass of water could have even in the most arid of places.
He paid no attention to it, as he adjusted his shirt cuff and moved to stand in the living room between them. His mask of machine-like intelligence found itself properly situated as his back faced John while their client stood to greet Sherlock.
“You have no idea what you are going into, Watson! You are hoping for something to happen that he never can, nor will give you!”
With what little awareness he still had, he attempted to move his head to see that he had now entered a room with nurses surrounding him. Hands moved and turned him every which way, needles were inserted in his veins, oxygen was moved in his lungs, and the sudden beeping that began beside him removed any peace and quiet he would’ve likely gotten without it.
Sherlock took a slow, lingering breath as he nodded. With his hand linked with John’s, they both walked down the creaking steps and to the kitchen to order their food. A quiet understanding passed between them as their hand never left the other’s.
Now that he thought about it, John had been acting very strange around him. He never could place the exact time when it started, but all of a sudden John was… sweeter around him? He didn’t complain as much as he used to when Sherlock did his experiments in the kitchen, he hardly made a sarcastic comment towards overlooking a slightly insignificant detail during a case. Worst of all, whenever Sherlock went on his bouts of boredom, he hardly made a fuss about it and instead pulled out his phone to ask Lestrade if they had anything.
John stopped in his ministrations to stare at Sherlock, a very obvious look of shock graced the doctor’s features even when he thought he hid it well. It was rather endearing to Sherlock.
“And why not? You have completely gone against your biology and have gone after someone who can give you nothing! He is unable to offer you anything that you have ever wanted, I cannot for the life of me understand why you would want him!”
He swiftly averted his gaze from him and attempted to calm the wash of red that had overtaken his face. The man didn’t seem to be in immediate danger, and the large fish he had seen before no longer seemed to circle underneath him, so he took this opportunity to collect himself before he turned back to him, and he had vanished.
John managed to pull Sherlock into his arms and thread his fingers into his curls after a painfully long moment of anxiety between the two. “How is this going to be done?”
Again, do let me know if you tried to message me, or even try to message me just to see if I respond because this is becoming very strange.
When I wrote there is nothing I haven't seen, there really isn't. Do not be shy to comment me a suggestion!
This seemed to soothe him fairly quickly, as Sherlock ducked his head underneath the blanket and settled there for a while. John did not know why and he wasn’t planning on asking.
The sound of joy he would have made was interrupted by a nurse that knocked on the door and then made her way inside.
to Sherlock meant that he needed to remain completely nude to do so. John found this out when the door swung open and his eyes briskly ran over Sherlock’s body for a moment too long before he turned away and covered his eyes.
Sherlock swiftly made his away through the exit he had so desperately tried to push Victor through and began to swim away, leaving Victor to make his way out of the cave and watch Sherlock possibly swim faster than he ever had in his life.
He looked up from setting his bag down and found that he met Sherlock’s eyes for longer than he had for the last week.
With a quick movement and another of those damned smiles, he was gone. It was now John’s turn to fall weak at the knees, and he certainly did. He wondered how he’d managed to make it back to his chair at all when he found himself sitting in it, contemplating how the hell the man knew of his previous military position. He must have been truly going mad after all.
He couldn’t explain why he slid down to the lower half of the door, but he did once he spotted John knelt down on the side of the bed with his head laid down on his intertwined hands. The gentle muttering under his breath was just loud enough for Sherlock to catch a few words.
He reached into his pocket to retrieve a few quid and handed them to the barkeep. As he made his way to the door, he turned back to Mycroft, who already began to lick his wounds while a few others gathered around him. John hardly had time to get a word in when Mycroft piped up from that crowd that surrounded him.
The two bickering men turned their attentions back to the squirming merman as he had slipped from John’s arms only slightly, which caused him to try and claw back up into them as though he would slip through the cracks in the wood beneath him. It was then that John managed to move Sherlock into his lap with his head cradled within the crook of his neck. The instant iron grip Sherlock took onto him, combined with the small whimpers that escaped him and collected in John’s ear only drew him in closer as his fingers ran through his curls.
The man seemed to beam at this news at him being correct, as a quick splash underneath him seemed to signify his legs kicked with happiness. Except… this dock had to be at least six feet from the water, and unless this man’s legs were truly longer than that and he had not already been sent away to one of the many freak shows that were currently touring Europe, something was not right.
John smiled to himself and looked to down to see Sherlock had quickly fallen asleep on his shoulder, which John couldn’t blame him for. He pressed another kiss to his forehead and laid down as well. The covers quickly surrounded them both as they kept the other warm that night.
John remembers an afternoon around the end of Sherlock's first year, back when there was something terrible about himself that Sherlock did not want John to find out.
“Sherlock, dear, is John back yet?” Mrs. Hudson called as she deposited a plate of biscuits on the kitchen table.
Sherlock opened his eyes slowly, lying on a concrete floor on his side, some objects in front of his nose...He blinked slowly. His eyelids felt heavier than they normally did and it took a bit longer than usual for the objects to come into focus.
“Mmmph,” Sherlock agreed, this time mumbling because his mouth was full of John’s wrist and John’s warm blood.
Sherlock groaned and rolled over, flopping unceremoniously off of the couch and landing in a heap on the floor. He rubbed at his eyes with his hands, trying to remember what on earth could have possessed him to sleep in the sitting room rather than his large, comfortable, and most importantly private bedroom.
“What kept you?” Greg asked. “And hand that back, you need another.” John handed over the shot glass as soon as he had emptied it, and Greg refilled it with the bottle that he was apparently carrying around.
In my mind, Watson is bisexual. I am not. While I have read up on bisexuality and read interviews with bi folks, I am likely to make mistakes while writing him. I'd appreciate any suggestions or constructive criticism on how I can write a more realistically bisexual Watson. I myself am asexual and the version of Sherlock that I write will be informed by that. I don't claim to speak for asexuals in general or really any ace folks other than myself.
Sherlock leaned around the corner and eyed the ladder with distrust. John had not yet seen his feet and didn’t know about the layer of first-degree burns Sherlock had been walking on thus far without complaint. He took a deep breath.
Everything was not, in fact, fine. Lestrade swore and cradled his bleeding arm, while John ducked, narrowly avoiding the fist of the man who had followed him first out of the surgery and then around the corner a few blocks until John had turned into an alleyway and confronted him.
“Hmmm, don’t you though? But maybe I need it.” John leaned in closer to Sherlock and took a deep breath, curling his hands around Sherlock’s waist and pulling him forward.  “Come on, let me give ye what you need.”
For a long moment they were both silent, and then John cleared his throat, his voice somewhat returned to normal.
“Come on, we all know you have a bit of a...thing for men in uniform,” Greg laughed. “But look at the August one. You have to.”
The conversation from eight months ago echoes in my mind, as though repetition could wring any meaning out of it. It hadn’t been six months after all. Sherlock, you liar. My eyes burn and I blink furiously. Sherlock, you bloody liar.
“The pills are my own design. I said that I have to have them to live—that’s—there are other things that I could have instead of them.” He paused, looked down at his arm. The stitches were done; John was washing the needle in the sink and replacing the contents of the first aid kit.
Getting shot changed everything, except that it changed nothing. Instead of looking down into the eyes of a terrified and bleeding soldier while he fished bullets out of them as gently as he could, John was looking up into the terrified eyes of another unit’s surgeon while blood dripped from a shallow cut on the woman’s forehead as she tried to remove shrapnel from his shoulder as gently as she could.
Mike inspected the picture, and nodded. “That must have been nice to see, all the way out there in the desert.”
And yet, when the man stopped, apparently regarding the fourteen ragged dots along Sherlock’s right shoulder as sufficient, and drew a vial and syringe out of his suit jacket’s pocket (Westwood again, and a different one every day. Sherlock was beginning to wonder if this design house gave a discount to sadistic lunatics), Sherlock knew what had to come next, what the man would expect if he were truly the addict—
“What is with you two?” Lestrade asked. “You’re a space case and John’s mooning over his hot date last night.”
Two hours after John left the flat, Sherlock was still standing in the living room. He can’t remember when he picked up his violin but it was perched against his shoulder now, a comforting weight against his body while his mind felt anything but calm.
“Ye-es,” Sherlock replied every time, because he was back on schedule with the pills, taking them regularly every morning as soon as he woke up, and every other evening before bed. Between the regular pills and the…other thing that they were doing that he did not want to think too much about, Sherlock was warmer than he had ever been since it had happened.
The eyes were flat and cold, with only the barest hint of anticipation. The lines in the man’s forehead said cruelty, and anticipation, and added to the laugh and the expression in those eyes and the well-muscled build and the thin, predatory smile meant one thing: this was a man who had hurt others, and enjoyed it. This was a torturer.
Hidden in a tree outside Dmanisi cathedral ruins. Georgia. Night settles over the hills, and the sounds of crickets start to overtake the chirps of birds as the passeriformes settle down for the night. It will be a long night, and likely as uneventful as the past few nights.
“Oh,” he breathed as he figured it out. John looked confused. He should explain. He really should. He shouldn’t tease him about it, as the rest of the school undoubtedly has been doing all day long, judging from the tense set of John’s shoulders. John clearly hadn’t done it on purpose. And remarkably, John somehow did not know that he had done it at all.
The bite was so quick that John almost didn’t feel it, though Sherlock certainly wasn’t paying attention to trying to make it painless. He wasn’t entirely sure that was even something that he had control over anyway, and at the moment his entire mind was singing John, John, John, warm over and over in a chorus, and focusing on anything else was patently impossible.
Well, hardly any point trying to sleep another half hour, may as well get up. Half a liver to remove at 6:30, and it doesn’t hardly inspire confidence when your doctor’s half asleep.
Sherlock took a deep breath and released all the tension of the day with a great exhale. He then opened the medicine cabinet and reached deep into one of the upper shelves, behind a stamped, black-on-white label that read TUESDAY, where he hid a thin tube of foaming cleanser. It was an Arab brand that he discovered while on a secret mission for Mycroft in Dubai. He also grabbed a bigger tube of exfoliant. Unlike most of his exotic beauty products, this exfoliating cream was actually purchased at a nearby Marks & Spencer. He loved the self-heating formula and it always gave his skin a nice glow.
“I’m not crying you’re crying what the hell, Sarah“  Ok now she is crying, shit Watson what did you do that for.
John’s smile for Brian certainly didn’t reach his eyes. It was quick and insincere. John also unconsciously puffed up his chest and straightened his posture. Did John feel threatened? Was he jealous?
“I’m sorry, I….I don’t know why I did that. I just…” Sherlock picked at the back of his hand, trying to get the words to arrange themselves in his mind.
“Come on, budge over,” John said, leaning closer to Sherlock and laying his wrist (warm, Jawn, John, Sherlock’s sleepy brain supplied helpfully) across Sherlock’s mouth. “A nightcap, shall we say?”
John also felt that this was not going well. He had frankly not expected Sherlock to be in such poor condition, and had in fact counted on him being able to walk out. He had also had some vague idea that when he finally found Sherlock, his errant, probably-asexual flatmate would finally deduce some....things, and then John wouldn’t have to say those things, and then maybe other things would happen, or maybe they would not, but most of all nobody would go to A&E and probably be admitted and have to stay overnight at the very least. And this talk of drugging, and someone trying to reestablish Sherlock’s addiction was just not cricket. Even Moriarty hadn’t gone there.
The dirt samples from Regent’s Park, Richmond Park, Clapham Common, and Victoria Park were neatly recorded in tables in Sherlock’s lab notebook and he was just about to make the first slide from a Hampstead Heath sample when the power went out at the lab. Grumbling a little, Sherlock tipped the used slides into a sharps bin, then stacked the Hyde Park, St. James’s Park, Greenwich Park, and Hampstead Heath baggies into a drawer. He scribbled “DO NOT DISTURB - SH” on a piece of paper tape and stuck it on the drawer’s handle. Molly was usually the only other person to use this lab and if anyone could be trusted with the Dirt Survey it was her.
“Do you think so little of me?” The voice chuckled again. Sherlock was rapidly becoming impatient with this conversation in spite of how satisfied and amused the other participant seemed to be. He struggled to sit up (Why? Ah. Hands handcuffed behind back. How dull. Sherlock resolved to pickpocket his gaoler at the first opportunity. In his experience, kidnappers were frequently unimaginative enough to carry the keys to handcuffs on their person.), then turned around to see a man sitting in a chair.
“Ok. We should have some help coming, but I don’t see them yet,” John says, scanning the horizon. They’ve emerged at what looks like a small airfield, with a single runway that trails off into an overgrown grassy field, and a narrow road of crumbling cement that presumably leads to other roads that will convey them back to civilization. Or so John hopes.
“Yeah. He probably has been,” John said, a little surprised. “And I will.” And I will also get the hell out of here before I get asked any more insane questions and end up punching somebody, he added in his head.
Sherlock shook his head. “Yes, but not for me. Mycroft…he said we should keep this quiet. Nobody outside Hogwarts knows, really. I think he used one of the old family curses—if anyone tries to say anything about it, they won’t be able to.”
But there was always the matter of the phone, and the near-certainty (now validated) that Mycroft was surveilling John quite closely. And if Mycroft couldn’t know that he was (still, stubbornly) alive, then that meant John couldn’t either, at least not in any obvious way. That thinking had kept him anonymous throughout most of the mission.
“Right,” John said when he returned. “Let me clean your arm a bit, and we’ll see if you need stitches.”
“Oh God Sherlock I’m so—,” John swallowed, then took a breath. “I said I wouldn’t do that. I want to show you. It scares me when you’re so cold, and knowing that I can make you warm…I want to help. Please let me,” he asked.
Calling him a stalker, (which he knew he was not, but could admit that it might look that way to someone else) or maudlin (he would readily admit to that), or even calling him to call off their---what was it? A date? John wasn’t sure of that--were nothing compared to how much it would hurt to lose the card.
Ok, that last one I was channeling my inner Holmes I bit. I admit it. I can just picture him standing my the window with that violin, punctuating his words by stabbing at the air with his bow while I read him Lestrade’s latest text, his expression at once irritated with how moronic he thinks Lestrade is being and excited about having found a clue, dictating to me because for some reason he’s decided it’s beneath him to text that day--
His phone buzzed, and he rolled over on the floor of the little fishing boat and reached for it. Texts from John? Ah, he must have worked it out then, Sherlock thought, smiling to himself. He put the phone in his pocket, and looked up just in time to see the small missile splinter through the deck of his boat.
John’s impulse was to jerk his hand away but he forced himself to stay still, and after a moment the sharp sting lessened, and he could swear—was Sherlock humming, a little?
“Probably not,” Sherlock answered absently, his attention focused on the pocket of John’s jacket where he knew the letter would be. “Anyway. The letter.”
“You know why,” John said, his voice coming out a little more gruff than he had intended. “What should have been my first year was the year…the year the ministry fell. They interviewed all of us before we were sorted…us mudblood students, tried to force us to say we had stolen our magic from a wizard. I don’t know why. It was obvious at the beginning that they were never going to let us come to Hogwarts,” John said, his voice level now. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter. I got in the next year, after Potter killed him.”
A bitter laugh escaped John’s mouth. It was probably for the best that he and Sherlock had this row. He really didn’t mean what he said earlier. He didn’t want to leave Baker Street. Baker Street was home.
Pause. That’s new. Finger hovers over the screen--a second’s pause before it sends the rest. Ridiculous to write it out every time. Sentimental. But he was reasonably certain that John didn't know how fast he could type, and was therefore assuming that these messages were automatically generated by his phone. That was the point of them, after all. He should have just written a script, set his phone to send them automatically, but that felt too much like ignoring John and he couldn't quite do it. Instead he answered every single message, with this answer that was not an answer.
John swallowed. He hadn’t told Sherlock about it at the time, but Sherlock’s “pestilential brother” had made the precariousness of John’s position very clear to him back in John’s fifth year, back when he and Sherlock had started the slow transition from best friends to...whatever they were now. The morning after the night when John had finally screwed up the courage to stand on his tiptoes and lean forward to press a kiss to the Hufflepuff boy’s messy curls and mumble “goodnight, love,” before turning and fleeing back to Gryffindor tower-- that morning, John had arrived at the Gryffindor table early, having spent the whole night pacing in his room, terrified that he had just utterly destroyed the most important friendship he had every had-- he had arrived early to breakfast, before most students were even awake, and had found a tall, unhappy looking man sitting in the chair next to John’s usual one. He had slid into his seat cautiously, sneaking sideways glances at the man, taking in his severe expression and green and silver striped tie.
And it had taken him some time, longer than he cared to admit, but Sherlock had eventually worked out that Doctor John “Not Gay” “Three Continents” Watson was bisexual. Of this Sherlock was certain. All available evidence indicated that John was not interested in Sherlock.
“Since apparently two saturdays before christmas is a busy weekend and there aren’t many cabs free, and I don’t want that,” Sherlock said, a note of irritation entering his voice.
So I’ve been hiding it, hiding how desperately I want him, and for a few weeks I even thought maybe it was a good thing, him going on this mission or case of whatever it is off somewhere. But then one month turned into two and now eight and damn you Sherlock fucking bloody Holmes you better not be dead before I can get to you. Not when you’re so close, finally on English soil if I can believe Mycroft.
“I am fine. You are fine. Go to sleep, yeah?” John tucked the afghan back around Sherlock’s shoulders as he stood and pushed him gently back down into the sofa. “I’m going to stay and keep an eye on you, for a bit.”
Sherlock skipped the scales and the usual études that he would play to warm up his hands and launched straight into the concerto, smashing his fingertips into the strings greedily, chasing after that burn as his soft, unprepared fingertips gave way to harsh metal. There would be bruises afterwards, Sherlock knew. He crushed his raw, unprepared fingertips against the E and A, playing a triplet more roughly than the score technically called for. He hurtled through the first phrases of the tone poem, fingertips heating up as the indentations formed by the opening notes were criss-crossed by the strings as he mashed his fingers against them in slightly different positions. At the brief, three-beat rest he barely paused, taking only the shortest moment before throwing himself back into the music.
As the light from the campfire begins to dim, he thinks he hears for the first time raised voices. Good. One waves his automatic weapon around, pointint it at no one bust gesturing wildly. Another voice, deeper than the first, also heated. Someone has found the note he left, then. They’re meant to all think that one of the others has ratted them out, that Interpol are on their way out of Tbilisi, have in fact been on their way for some minutes, and are likely (barring some absurd accident) already in the woods nearby. (The woods to the west of the embankment, he heavily implied, in order to direct suspicion away from the eastern woods where he kept watch. If these men were half as intelligent as Mycroft had given them credit for at the beginning, this gambit would not have worked. But fortunately, they were idiots.)
Simplest way to resolve this: dispatch them all with a sniper rifle. They are well within range of the gun that Mycroft insisted he take along, six months ago. The gun that he lost in a flood four months ago. Mission objectives: determine if suspects have been in contact with illegal arms dealer, and if suspicions proved correct, neutralize them in the most expedient and unnewsworthy manner; lethal force permitted.
“See, what if that hit somethin’? Ye’re basically making fireballs out of toxic metals in the kitchen,” John said.
“Started without me, I see,” John said, clapping Greg on the shoulder and accepting a shot glass of whiskey.
As far as sneaking into the EU was concerned, he was pretty sure he had the ideal route already mapped out in his mind. The difficult part would be the five straight days of walking (twenty hours by car, if he could hitchhike the whole way, but that could not be counted upon) to a port town in Turkey, chosen for the proliferation of tourists that would be present there at this time of year. Busy enough with tourists that a  man speaking with received pronunciation attempting to rent a boat would be assumed to be a sport fisher(especially once he had gathered the necessary fishing accessories, secondhand so that he would look appropriately dedicated to fishing) rather than an asiring illegal immigrant to the EU. Ideal for his purposes, once that tiny detail of the inconvient thousand kilometers across Turkey were crossed.
Sometimes, Sherlock lovingly, carefully slid the clear, honey-gold bar of rosin across the hair of his bow, hands moving lazily as he inhaled the faint scent of pine from bits of rosin that floated into the air.
“I--” John didn’t see any way out of this, but he desperately did not want to show Sherlock the card. Any chance (and he doubted he had any chance at all, but hope springs irrational and eternal) he had with Sherlock would surely be destroyed as soon as the man found out that he carried around a card he had written as a child every day. There would be no recovery from that.
With no new cases from Lestrade, Sherlock spent the next day and a half alternating between lying about on the sofa drinking tea and furiously composing on his violin. After the first four hours of violin, John called in to the clinic to see if he could pick up some extra hours to get himself away from the noise and his incredibly distracting and scantily dressed flatmate.
“As you say,” Mycroft replied. “But I’m afraid in this case there isn’t much that I can tell you. It is quite possible that you know more about Sherlock’s…situation than I do, Doctor Watson.”
John paused on top of the stairs for a moment, trying to collect himself for a possible confrontation with Sherlock but the flat seemed quiet. He gingerly opened the door and found the living room empty. Letting out a relieved breath, John slowly approached the center of the room, touching things and looking around at the bits and pieces that made 221B home. But John knew it wasn’t the odd knick-knacks that made this flat special. It was a person. One particular person.
By the time they got into a cab, Sherlock was deep in his mind palace. John was talking, of course, he could tell from the tone of voice that he was asking questions, but it wasn’t important. Predicting what they would find at the flat was important. The old numbers station had stopped broadcasting in the early 90’s; it was unlikely that the equipment would have been abandoned there. Not too many vacant lots in that neighborhood, no, the property would have been sold, possibly more than once, and whoever the new owners were….well, balance of probabilities their murderer was not using his own home as a murder base, so that meant he either had the owners’ permission (unlikely) or he was using the property (or part of it, basement most likely) without their knowledge. Add in the phone messages to the Yarders’ phones, mimicking an old numbers station, it was almost as if…
At some point Sherlock became aware that John was petting his hair and that the flat had become stiflingly hot, and he drew back, dabbing at one or two stray drops of blood in John’s elbow.
Sherlock shivered and burrowed deeper into the duvet stolen from John’s bed. He scowled at nothing in particular. It had been two weeks since their agreement and that was the longest he had gone without risking hypothermia ever since it had happened.
And then John had hugged him, and Sherlock had allowed it. There really was no other word Sherlock could assign to John’s actions. Was this just a bromance thing? Sherlock wasn’t sure. He wasn’t entirely convinced that the term was even real--Molly had introduced him to the concept, saying that she had learned it off one of those misspelt blogging websites, and suggesting that it might be an apt description of what he had with John. More intense than a simple friendship, but not sexual. Sherlock supposed that the term didn’t matter much so long as John stayed with him. And if you averaged it out over time (which Sherlock did), yes, they both had left but they had both eventually returned, and stayed. He supposed that at the moment it might not look that way to John, but he was not supposed to know that this current disaster of a mission had been intended to be fatal.
The man walked slowly over to the place on the floor where Sherlock had woken up and picked up the jar, shaking a small amount of something. (No, Sherlock insisted to himself. There is no need to pretend to deduce what is in that bottle. You know.) into the spoon. He uncapped the bottle and picked up the lighter, and Sherlock heard the hiss of the lighter fluid combusting. His body knew what was next even if his mind refused to acknowledge it and he forced himself not to look as the man drew the liquid up into the needle, then reached for the rubber band and turned around...
“Hello, John,” drawled a very naked Sherlock who was spread out on the sofa. He was lying on his right side, his right arm bent under his head. His other arm was loosely hanging down his chest. Sherlock’s legs were slightly bent up, artfully covering his nether regions. It reminded John of a Watteau painting. The one with the sleeping Antiope. If only John had paid attention to his art history lessons in school.
“Let’s check these guys out,” one of the stalagmites echoed him in a singsong voice. . “Welcome, Mister Holmes and Doctor Watson! I must say I’m glad you came alone. It makes this next part so much easier for me.” A squat, balding man emerged from behind the newspaper pile and John groaned.
“So is he coming or what?“ Lestrade takes short, irritable drink of his coffee, which smells like stewed cigarette butts.
“Sherlock. It’s fine. I think I—I think I get what you’re saying,” John said, tracing his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “You ah. You had a bit of a crush?”
“John,” Sherlock began, his voice muffled into John’s coat, and the words coming out a bit slurred--Jaawn. “John, you are a friend and an Englishman.” John wasn’t sure what to say about that, so he patted Sherlock’s curls awkwardly.
Once John was safely outside of the apartment, Sherlock stuffed his phone into his dressing down pocket and vaulted over the side of the sofa. He hurried to the kitchen and started pulling bags and jars off of the shelves. He checked the time on his phone--if it took John an average of thirty minutes to walk to the clinic...yes, there should be time. He switched on the oven, then turned to the ingredients arranged haphazardly around a mixing bowl.
John stayed in his chair for a few minutes, listening as Sherlock’s breathing evened out and he began to snore softly.
alone,” John finished. “I will hex anyone I have to hex. I don’t have to resort to shin-kicking anymore now I’ve got a wand and three years of Hogwarts under my belt.”
Sherlock couldn’t imagine where that could possibly be. John often acted this way when he had a date lined up for the evening, but he had gone through John’s phone while he was showering after Sherlock had finished using up all the hot water, and there were no texts to indicate that he had a date or even a potential date.
The same message I’m used to seeing is divided into two little blue bubbles on the screen, dated several hours ago, from just after my phone died I guess.  There’s a vague, fuzzy thought, like maybe that signifies something--seems important--but before I can work out exactly what I’m asleep again.
In John’s experience, a rescue operation that seems to be going well is always about to go completely to shit. He is therefore more exasperated than surprised when a man who he immediately dubs Moriarty Cosplayer, due to his Westwood suit and slicked-back haircut,appears in front of them, waving a gun. Of course. Of course he has a fucking gun.
He missed an accidental, then another, and groaned as he ground his index finger against the heavy G in frustration. Slowing the tempo just enough to be sure he could get his aching, abused fingers to the notes on the E in time for the theme to come through.
“You’ll recall that there is, in fact, no password or indeed no security of any kind on the door to Hufflepuff tower,” Sherlock said archly. “Besides, if my pestilential brother intended you ill he would have acted already. Really, you should just move in with me. You know I don’t have roommates.”
As far as evenings go, waking up in a landfill was not (to date) his worst. Close, though. The entire premise was the problem, he thought. A (supposedly) fatal mission by nature did not come with an extraction plan. At least the supplies stashed in the woods before the stakeout was (mostly) untouched. Rodents(mephitus mephitus, judging from the odor) appeared to have gotten into the bag of food, but the important part (clothes and phone charger) were still there. Without a passport or identification of any kind (Mycroft’s idea again-no point in secrecy if a week afterwards some peasant find a body with Sherlock Holmes’ passport in its all-too-recognizable coat pocket) getting back into Britain was going to be a lengthy (and possibly illegal) process.
Mary knew Sherlock enough to actually understand what was going on while John was completely confused.
“I assure you I would not.” Sherlock stated from where he was seated at his microscope at the kitchen counter.
Tears stream down Sherlock's face as he leans over John and presses his lips to his neck, opening his mouth to reveal his fangs.
But of course, now there's a war on and Sherlock has to admit he's more than a bit terrified. Obviously, he knew this was likely to happen, what with all the news reports and he knew John would have to go out into the field one day but after three days of no replies, Sherlock thinks the worst.
"Thanks, Amy. I'll get plenty of sleep and be ready for the all-night party." Maggie replies with a giggle.
He watches the fragile and abused form of his brother as he sways were he stands, his legs barely strong enough to support his weight, as depleting as it is. He's watched his brother since the day John was declared M.I.A and has seen his increasing decline and self destruction.
“It’s just a few things I noticed about you. You carry the somewhat typical dexterity of a doctor; it was fairly easy to see from the way you made the sandwiches and cut the fruit. You also have stitching on your coat that show a typical surgical stitch that you would likely know.”
John turned his gaze back to the young merman that sat beside him, who eagerly awaited to see his reaction, and a reaction he did receive.
He grumbled to himself as he eventually ended up carrying them all in without once seeing John come down. It crossed his mind that he was getting his revenge for the months that he had to do the exact the same thing without any help from Sherlock, but it was unlikely John would pass up the opportunity to help just out of spite.
He let out a defeated sigh as his sight must have been going as well as his nerves. He sat back down on the dock; his cane mockingly laid beside him as he gazed down into the water that waded in against a barnacle covered pole. It must have just been a bundle of seaweed is all, a clump of weeds that were sucked away by the current when he looked away.
He was then hurriedly pushed onto the naval ship without much grace as the rest of Mycroft’s men followed behind them, the board was lifted from between the walkways and the crew began to make their way around the ship to turn back around towards their destination.
His first thought was that it was a shipwrecked sailor that had been stranded not far from shore. It was a likely possibility as there seemed to be a large quantity of men that have been found washed ashore much like this one. He had just stood from his place on the dock to gain a wider field of vision and potentially to alert the authorities, when he looked to the rock again to see that there was no one there.
“I see we must’ve struck gold on this ship, seeing as you have an actual doctor on board instead of a drunken barber. He might be quite useful.” He soon turned his gaze back to John as he stood by the fore mast, that same grin on his face as he watched John’s jaw drop.
His eyes shot up from the letter and he swiftly moved to unlock the door, to which he was greeted to the sight of two men stood on either side of the doorway, who gripped the doorknob when he opened it too quickly.
He did not bother to think about it any longer, as he moved from his bed to run his fingers over the stone of his home. It was not much to look at, but he did his best to make it comfortable for him. Stacks of books were placed in small alcoves of the cave, half burnt candles sat in corners, never to be lit again.
“Would you like to enlighten me on what we’re talking about? I still have no reason to understand why you would be upset at me.”
I hope you all like this. I skipped ahead a few years. Just to keep the story moving along. So I decided to change this around a bit as it was probably a bit confusing so bear with me please xxxx
His hands slammed against the walls of the shower as he felt himself on the edge, before his ears made out the sound of Sherlock jerking himself off and that was it, the doctor came with a low moan and nearly collapsed with the force of his orgasm.
John tries to regulate his breathing, struggling to find his mobile with his free hand and searching for Greg's number; he presses the call button and hands it to Sherlock.
“Wait, you knew he'd do this? And what do you mean always? Mycroft, what haven't you told me?” Greg asks angrily, with a slight tone of betrayal in his voice.
Even John works out that foul play was involved and that the husband murdered his wife to claim the life insurance, simple really.
“I shall see you at half twelve then.” Sherlock smiles back, grabbing his bag before looking for his shoes.
It's nearing the end of Sherlock and John's second year of college and the boys have been together for seven months now. Unfortunately, it's also six days until John goes off to start his army training and Sherlock doesn't take it well.
Over the years, Harriet Hamish Holmes-Watson grew progressively in all forms. She became very tall within two years, could read at an adult level by nine and was creating experiments with her dad by eleven.
He takes a long drag and puffs it out into the night sky, watching as it slowly disappears into the air.
“Nobody hurts my John. Otherwise, you have me to deal with. Understood?” Sherlock growls at Mr Cambria; who's lying by the bed where he landed.
“Now, if you behave and clean up the eyes, I might even just feed it to you. In our room. With a lot less clothing on.” The teen whispers, straddling Sherlock's legs and leaning in to nibble his neck.
“Well … never mind. So, if you're going to break into my house at half six in a morning, I should at least know your name.”
John blushed at his daughter's critical observation before looking at Sherlock, who smirked and took a seat at the table.
"Okay, John, I need to turn you. If I don't you'll die. You know what you'll become. And you don't …" Sherlock breaks off to sob, “You don't have to stay with me but … You need to know that I love you. I'm in love with you. I can't let you die, my love. I'm sorry.”
“Exactly, I mean take me, for instance, I've always wanted to be a copper and yet, you know I have a bit of a record. Now, if I'd have used my brain, I'd have thought more before I did some of that shit.”
“So, how did you enjoy your birthday, love?” John asked his daughter as she helped him tidy away the dishes.
She decides to ring Mycroft and tell him to bring around bags of blood; lots of them. He swears he will be round soon and suggests Mrs Hudson go to her sister's once he gets there; a bloodthirsty new-born vampire shouldn't be around a human when blood-lust takes over.
Sherlock practically slams John against their dorm-room door as they enter and kisses him passionately, digging his nails into his boyfriend's hips.
“Of course I have. Isn't that what couples do when they're in love?” Sherlock asks cautiously, confusion furrowing his brow.
One day, the emails stop coming and at first Sherlock thinks that it's just because John can't answer them yet. John successfully completed his army training and is now a fully qualified medic, which of course made Sherlock immensely proud.
“Mmm, you taste as good as you look.” John grins back at Sherlock, cleaning the last of the sticky substance off his fingers.
Sherlock laughed, “You make out like I taught her how to pull off a bank heist, John. It's only blackmail, she wouldn't get any jail time for blackmailing the girls at school.”
“Come on, Sherl. It'll be fun.” The older teen says excitedly, dragging his friend off the couch by his wrist. “Now, go on. Get changed and we'll set off in a bit.”
. And as for the non-existent limp, you said mine was purely psychosomatic due to my duty in Afghanistan so don’t bring
. Now get over it. If you hadn't noticed, I'm not drunk anymore and I'm extremely horny. Now, shut up and kiss me.” John smirks and before Sherlock can reply, he dives his tongue into Sherlock's mouth again.
“I'll make it worth your while.” John whispers in Sherlock's ear, his hand running further down to the younger teen's cock.
"You're so good with her, not that I doubted you would be. And I know it's difficult for you that we used Irene as a surrogate."
“This is just something I have to do, Sherl. It's nothing to do with our relationship or whether I want you or not. I just have to do this. But I'll send you emails every day. I'm not going to forget about you, baby. Never in a million years.”
“Oooh, thinking of getting off with someone are we, Lestrade?” The young teen asks with a cheeky smirk.
John shot him a glare that clearly said 'shut the fuck up' and Sherlock went back to his food; albeit still smirking to himself.
Davies turns to look at the DI and sniggers, “Who's this? Your dad? Got daddy issues do you, kid? That why you're shagging men twice your age?”
“How was lunch?” Sherlock asks, getting into John's space and resting his hands on the other teens hips.
Sherlock nods in agreement, a lump forming in his throat at all the possible ways John could be killed.
John screams in the otherwise quiet flat as Sherlock drinks his blood and waits to see if John can survive the ordeal.
“I can't promise you a perfect relationship, John. But I will try my best to be a good boyfriend.” Sherlock replies softly, trying not to let his eyes wander down John's naked body but failing dramatically.
“Mm, fine.” Sherlock mumbles distractedly, before tugging the blanket off the bed and covering himself with it.
Apparently the younger man's experiment took presidency over his tan-trumming daughter; or so it seemed to the father currently wrestling to get the child's shoes on.
“Why the bloody hell would I want to do that? I'm in love with you, you stupid man!” Mycroft yells, shocking all three of them with his blatant honesty.
Mycroft steps around his assistant and reads the email from the account that only he and Anthea have access to.
John blushed but wrapped his arms around the younger man and kissed him softly as Sherlock ran his fingers through John's hair while they kissed.
“Wow, nice to meet you, Sherlock. Mags, I could do with your help in the kitchen sorting the last of the food, okay. Don’t worry, I won’t keep her too long.” Amy smiles, grabbing Maggie's arm roughly and dragging her to the kitchen.
“Thank God.” John sighed in relief, after all, they were running out of places to hide all of Harriet's alien presents.
Harriet quickly finished the last of her breakfast and quietly disappeared into the living room; her dad never approved of things that were 'Not Good'.
John moans softly and presses his body flush against Sherlock's and resting both his hands on the other's hips.
“Now, be a good boy and fuck me like you mean it.” The younger teen smirks, his fingers tangle in John's hair.
, either! And I said, no! Can't a guy just get a quick fuck and be done with it?” Sherlock snaps, glaring at the man.
The younger teen's eyes scrunch up as he feels the impending orgasm and he tries to pull John off so that he can let go but John just drops his head harder and suddenly Sherlock is seeing stars; his grip on his boyfriend's hair loosening as his eyes flutter shut.
“Leave, Mycroft. You won't want to see what happens next, especially not when your little brother is involved.” Sherlock says, looking at his brother carefully.
“Guess, I should have expected that.” John sighs, opening the door and watching his boyfriend curl up onto their bed.
John grips Sherlock's hand and moves slightly faster, pouring everything in his heart out to his fallen angel.
Firstly, this is going back to the second time Harriet met the Doctor and the boys reactions to it. There are also slight warnings for this of a sexual nature, only mild but still. I got confident and decided to write in a sexual scene rather than just the usual "and they made love all night" or "they showed each other how much they meant to each other". So enjoy and apologies if this chapter is too long. Anyway, please me nice ;) xxxxx
The younger Holmes ignores him in favour of bringing his knees up to his chest and staring into the fire, feeling as it warms him to his bones.
“Enough, Gregory! Remember, you're not supposed to know any of it.” Mycroft growls, silencing his partner.
“Not yet, love. But I won't give up, you know that.” Greg replies, walking out of the third drug den that evening.
He gets a lucky punch on me that actually leaves me a little dizzy and he's about to stab me again when I barely manage to pin him once again.
But when a strangely familiar accent; British, more specifically London of origin, calls his name, John isn't sure whether to be relieved or to worry for his sanity.
I try to help the doctor as he practically lifts me up each stair but it's just too hard; my head drops to his shoulder and I see the blood running through his veins.
“I know that too, baby.” Greg replies softly, letting his old pet name slip through for the first time in years. “And I will find him. Even if it takes me all night. I'll get our boy back safe.”
"It's like a mood stone. Sneaky way of finding out if you should talk to someone or not as they don't need to touch it, you can just tell what they're feeling from about two feet away." The Doctor replies with a smile.
“You know what I mean, sweetheart. I want to make love to you properly. Not fuck you roughly on a couch, so send your brother home and we can get to it.” John grins, climbing off Sherlock and heading to his mate's bedroom.
John looks up at Sherlock through his eyelashes and smiles again, speeding up as he digs his nails into his boyfriend's hips; knowing that there'll be bruises on his beautiful pale body in a few days.
Hope you like this one. It's the first glimpse of my own original character. Sort of. Anyway, enjoy xxxxx
“Yeah, I suppose you're right. And besides, I've always wanted to be a doctor. I always thought it was something I was good at, taking care of people.”
I need to be more careful when I'm around John, otherwise he's going to figure out that something isn't right and he'll leave me.
John moans loudly and continues to hit that spot every time, feeling Sherlock's body tense tighter and tighter.
“John. Stay with me, please. We're getting out of here. We're only a couple of streets from from home but I can make that distance in a few minutes. Hold on, John.” Sherlock says desperately, picking John up and carrying him out of the room.
"That's a lie. This is time and space we're talking about." I grin because Father's always loved a mystery, and time travel is just another one.
John continues to kiss and nibble at Sherlock's neck as he slowly runs his hands up his boyfriend's chest and begins to undo his buttons slowly.
The next thing I know, we're in a cab and I can hardly keep my eyes open as John tries to keep me from unconsciousness.
“What? Oh, your hair … We'll get one in the morning, Sherl. It's time to sleep now.” John replies softly, pulling off his jeans and boxers, throwing them off the bed.
