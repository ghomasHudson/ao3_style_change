“Yeah, and you’re the freaking customer!” Deans whisper breaks on the second sentence: “and I fucking
And with that little tidbit of information, Dean suddenly has butterflies, because apparently, he’s a thirteen-year-old virgin.
,” Charlie mocks, fluttering her eyelashes at him.
Mom turned back around, finally a glimpse of sympathy on her features, and she rested a flour-y hand on Dean’s that was fiddling with an old shopping list. Mom realized then that she forgot to buy peanut butter. “I know you’re smarter than this,” she squeezed his hand and with a twinkle in her eye said, “You just need to spend a little less time trying to impress the girls, and a little more time with your text books.”
The tutor was gorgeous. And crazy smart, and so far, pretty good at covering the material in a way that Dean could understand. But he had a broody quality about him. Like when they had first met, Dean had tried to flirt with him because, gorgeous person = you flirt, that was just how Dean’s brain worked. But Castiel had just stormed off for the library and gone straight to work.
It’s a game against self restraint
“And I love you,” Castiel whispers, cupping Dean’s cheek in one hand.
Jo got there the night before and Dean is grateful because that means she could get the boyfriend-teasing out of her system before Bobby and Ellen had to bear witness to that crap. He never did tell her that they can’t know but he thinks she gets it. She got it back in high school when it was Viktor.
They make their way to the bar to settle the bill, splitting it because this isn’t a date.
“Yeah, come back! Dean misses you!” Benny yells.
Dean reads the PDF after Sam has promised him is aims weren’t rejected. The comments are good, really good. There are a few corrections to be made but other than that Dean is all set to start on his full proposal. Which is great because it’s not like Dean has a thesis to write alongside the full proposal.
Dean shrugs, “I’m fine.”
They turned to each other and Castiel hesitated. Dean leaned towards him and kissed him. Castiel got over himself and stuttered out, “Would you like to come inside?”
Castiel grew up pretty normal, despite himself. He went to public school, he did extracurriculars, even some sports. He had a clique of friends. He went to prom. He went to the dentist.
“So why did you?” Cas says, tone clipped but voice low.
But Dean knows this time, “yeah, baby, come on. Fill me up.”
“Coward,” she said and closed the door. The two girls started making their way towards the front entrance and Castiel cursed under his breath before getting out and running to catch up to them.
A second into awkwardness he turns to Meg and smiles, “I’m glad you like it.” He somehow meets Dean’s eyes as he says it. Maybe because Dean seems to enjoy it more.
He’s still smiling to himself as he reenters the living room but stops dead in his tracks when he sees that his brother has now met Dean’s new… something. Sam is in his workout gear (of course) and Castiel has pillow-lines on his face.
“Things?” Charlie smirks, “Things like errands or things like dildos?”
Castiel tilts his head, still smiling humorously, “Hanna is my sister. And I’m not in the habit of dating women.”
Dean’s smile widens but he looks frightened. Are 21 year olds scared of love confessions? Cas thinks they might be. Well, too late now.
Castiel shuffled into the room and leaned against the arm of the couch. He chose the tassel of a throw pillow to fiddle with next, “And the premiere is this spring.”
Sam raised his hands in innocence. “Nope. If no one is cursed, except for me by having the room next to you two (you aren’t exactly subtle, guys), then I’ll turn in,” he said and left the room.
“Cas, I’m not sure that’s a good idea,” Dean says. “We need to be able to get out.”
And then before Castiel has any chance to react the guy has taken the last few steps towards him and has pulled the paper from his hand. He frowns as he reads it. Castiel can smell the guy’s aftershave and he wish he could just pass out into a coma for the next three years or until the guy has forgotten this encounter.
Dean frowned at the wheel and then finally turned his head to look at Castiel, “Why won’t you have time?”
Dean chuckles at his sarcasm, “And you didn’t even get a proper meal out of it.”
He makes it to the bathroom in time.
He checks the caller ID and groans. He lost track of time.
is the reply.
He tries not to smile down at his phone, but it is probably a lost cause. Victor throws an eraser at him that Dean throws right back. Thankfully, there are no other jabs as their professors are all pop quiz terrorists and the library is serious about their silent sections.
He gets his shit together and swallows his bite of burger, “I feel ya. If I didn’t work at the coffee shop once a week I don’t think I’d see anyone but my mentor and my brother.”
“Uhm," Castiel stumbles. It is close to midterms so he does not plan anything but homework further than 12 hours ahead, "I'm free right now?"
“Yes, Cas, it’s a movie,” Dean rolls his eyes as he digs through his closet for his book bag to find his laptop. He’d shoved everything in his closet to ‘tidy his room’ before Cas came over. The mountain of laundry that spills out at his feet is embarrassing.
She smiled at him and even managed to get them tickets and a ride to the academy that Thursday.
“I guess I can try to make it more obvious,” Dean replies, turning to Cas. He can barely make out his features in the darkness. Just his silhouette, the contours of his face.
Castiel’s features softened and he leaned closer, putting a hand on Dean’s arm, “Dean, what are you talking about?”
Dean locks himself in his room and sulks.
“Uhh,” Dean gets out intelligently.
They get in and everything smells like Dean’s cologne and leather. He gets so caught up in it that he loses points as Dean flirts up a storm with Meg. It doesn't really matter, because when they get to the frat house that Dean calls home, Meg instantly disappears to flirt with someone else.
A lump instantly forms in Dean’s throat at the question. He fucked up. He turns down the stereo before resting his hand on Cas’ knee. Castiel doesn’t put his hand on top of Dean’s like he’s supposed to. He really fucked up.
Cas comes to stand pressed up against Dean’s back as he hands him a glass of juice. He hooks his chin over his shoulder, and that’s all it takes.
“No.”
“If it’s not too much trouble,” he says looking up at Dean through his lashes, and okay, maybe it’s the Novak charm that’s irresistible.
Castiel nods and looks up at Dean through his eyelashes and Dean wants to touch his face where the shadow from his lashes fan out on his cheekbones. His cheeks are flushed and his lips are chapped and Dean wants to kiss him.
“Maybe just leave a note for him?” Meg suggests.
“She does not,” Dean says.
The guy grins then for some reason beyond Castiel’s grasp, “Dude, you should have just told me!”
He got there ten minutes late and spent another five minutes in the parking lot trying to appear as less of a sweaty mess.
Cas leans back in to kiss Dean, and Dean clings to Cas for dear life as a lubed up finger finds its way to his entrance.
Victor looks up from where he was sprinkling glitter on a cardboard poster that Dean can’t read from this angle. Benny’s sitting still while Ash paints rainbows on his cheeks. He stops and they look at Dean, smiling. Ash is wearing rainbow sweatbands on his wrists and around his head. More guys are busy painting banners and each other around the room, some are getting help from a handful of sorority girls. But they all stop to smile at Dean.
Sam twists the chair with his feet on the floor, never able to sit still, the overgrown child, “And you’re dating?”
Dean licks syrup off his lip before looking down to cut up more pancake, “We exchanged numbers, and we’ve been texting. Then he invited me over yesterday.”
“Do I sign it?” Castiel asks after they have constructed a page of what start as pleasantries and gradients into offensive and ends in downright insults.
He hasn’t talked to Cas in six days and he hasn’t told anyone about the fight. He knows he’s the asshole in this so what’s the point? He just has to wait until Castiel is ready to hear an apology. If that time ever comes.
you, since you paid and all.”
They sit in silence then for a while and it’s not uncomfortable despite the note it started on, and they keep playing footsie and sharing the milkshake, until Dean’s phone interrupts them.
“So what do you have that’s so good that Dean’s skipping Cancun?” Benny asks Cas.
He had been so caught up in trying to find the right words that by the time he even noticed that the crowd in the hallways had been thinning out if not completely gone, Dean had been nowhere to find, and his rose had been quickly wilting. Eventually some guy informed him that Dean had already left with the other performers to go celebrate.
Dean smiles at Cas’ good morning text instead of replying to Sam.
When Dean just stares at him with wide eyes, Cas leads him back to their room to let Dean freak out for an hour and a half.
Is what Dean learns.
The way to get in his good graces was to study ahead, and Dean figured that the likelihood of getting out of tutoring would be greater if he finished his homework beforehand anyway.
Hanna chewed on her lip, staring at him while she thought. “It’s not funny. It’s cute. I’m glad you have a crush… But you’re not taking it seriously, right?”
For once Dean didn’t have any plans. He had the whole day stretching out in front of him, and he didn’t even have any real homework to speak of, since Castiel never wanted to fool around before it was finished, and Dean always wanted to fool around.
“Cas! Come on already! Daphne’s being sick outside, we wanna go,” someone’s yelling.
“Hey,” he said, stripping free of his jacket and school uniform blazer, sweaty from the bike ride across town.
“Shit man,” he leans forward, hiding his face in his hands. This is bad. “Oh shit, I fucked up.”
“Are you done complaining? Can I go back to my paper?” Sam asks.
“Or not
He looked up, shocked at their sudden appearance. His eyes went to the cherub and went south very briefly before he settled his eyes on Fate. He cleared his throat awkwardly.
Castiel glares at him but tries not to because the man did just buy his drinks, but Castiel could have paid. He’ll buy the next round.
Dean doesn’t grab Cas’ dick, but rather his hips, and he puts his mouth on Cas’ dick, licking up the length and Cas groans.
doing homework? He enjoyed results. He told Dean, “I don’t find all of it interesting. I apply myself to my schoolwork because I want to do well.”
“A cappuccino, please, with a pump of vanilla,” he doesn’t look at Dean, he bends down to look at the pastries behind the glass, “And a cherry strudel.”
Dean does actually
“What did he say?” Hanna asked.
“Fine!” Dean says, frustrated that Cas doesn’t seem to grasp how urgent this is to Dean.
“No, Cas, baby,” Dean whines, “Come back tomorrow.”
She giggles. “He already covered it. 25%.”
Castiel gets his luggage from baggage claim and makes his way into arrivals. It’s a big airport, one that’s air conditioned, thank god. He revels in the cold gusts of air against his face as he takes a moment to get oriented. It’s likely the last he’ll see if A/C for the next six weeks.
“I guess,” he smiles as charmingly as he can muster under the circumstances and shakes her hand, “Nice to meet you, uh…”
Dean tries not to glare sullenly at him, “I know Cas, I was in class, remember? I’m just saying it bullshit.”
He frowns at the huge rainbow flag in front of the frat house. He never even noticed that they had a flag pole.
Castiel hesitated, “Are you sure?” He shot a look in the direction he was going, “It’s not that far now.”
Before he can protest she points to a cutting board of the apples she just sliced, “Get started on the filling, please.” She says with no room for argument.
“I do,” he confirms and waves down the bartender.
From there there’s rutting and hands roaming, and then it’s not long before Dean is out of his T-shirt.
Like he has a sixth sense Castiel trots into the kitchen just as the coffee finishes. “Your brother is hogging the bathroom.”
“Fine. Get in the car,” he turns and opens it for the other man who quickly gets in.
Benny shrugs and opens his book. Dean figures he ought to get back to studying too, but he only manages to open his laptop before Castiel shows up to distract him with his unruly hair and stupid oversized NYU sweatshirt that has replaced the creepy trench coat he wore during the colder months.
“You guys are disgusting!” Sam yells back, but there’s a smile and drunken slurring to be found in his voice.
Dean glares at her. He is starting to feel guilty about the porn thing. Honestly, he shouldn’t have been engaging anymore after the incident at the coffee machine on campus. Or at the very least after he’d found out his real name.
“What?” Charlie whispered back.
“I’m not a zoology professor or anything fancy,” Dean says as he slows the boat once they’re deep in the bayou.
“I… Appreciate that, Dean.” He says.
Sam looks between them, “You know each other?” he’s smiling like this is a reunion or some shit.
“I think everyone is already here,” Dean says.
His friends only stay for the hour Dean has to bartend and then they all go home. Or Charlie probably stayed; she’s friends with everyone there.
“Yeah, okay, I hear how that sounds, but I don’t mean he owes me. It’s not about the porn at all. I just don’t get him.” He mumbles. He feels like a fucking douche now.
Castiel looks down. He shivers a little in the breeze coming in through the window so Dean scoots closer and pulls the cover around Cas’ shoulders too. His blue eyes shine in the moonlight when he looks back up at Dean, now sitting almost nose-to-nose.
“You brought a bong?” Dean smirks and hands a beer to Ash.
Dean’s a college student. He works summers and he has a few hours at a student job, so it’s not like he’s broke or
But they’re eating chicken Parmesan and Dean is starting to run late (but he’s never been at Rainbow on time), so he’s starting to just stuff giant chunks of food into his mouth.
Castiel moves closer yet, one hand pulling Dean to him by his waist, the other still holding Dean’s between their chests. Dean grabs Cas’ bicep. Cas moves slowly toward him and Dean is too busy taking it all in; the lashes fanning out on his cheekbones, the blush on his cheeks from the cold outside, his lips pursing to kiss him. Then he gets with the program and closes his eyes as their lips meet, softly at first.
Castiel tilts his head in thought. A note? “What would I write? ‘Excuse me, stranger, I need this spot to pass my exams and to even sleep at night, and maybe I have a little untreated OCD I should probably see a doctor for?’”
Meg huffs next to Cas and he turns to her. “I’m going to the restroom,” she announces and takes off.
Castiel just smiles and gets his cardboard cup.
Dean sighs and sits down next to him. He lets Cas drag his head into his lap, so he’s lying across the bed.
“Clarence, you made it!” she smirks at him, “Dean and I are doing main course. What group did you get in?”
“Heeey, Dean-O,” Meg drawls when Dean makes his way to the counter. Dean hates Meg. They make out every single time they get drunk together but that’s just because Dean likes making out.
Castiel finally perked up a little at that, “Yes. We should book those soon.”
“We’re preparing for the parade at 3 today,” he says, like it’s obvious.
Castiel chuckled at that confession, “Well, I suppose that can be motivation too.”
Dean waits at the counter, wanting to ask if he can help with anything. Cas gets out orange juice from the fridge. “Never does with these two,” Cas replies to Balthazar.
“I could kiss you. If I may,” Dean says, grinning more than he should be.
It's the first Valentine’s Day that Dean didn’t spend hitting on desperately lonely singles while drinking watered down margaritas. And he thinks to himself that he’d be okay if he never did that again. That he’d be totally okay, in fact, if next year went a little like the one this year.
Sam talks about how much he hates corporate law and asks if Dean will check Jess’ social media to see what she’s up to, since Sam deleted her and Dean turns to look for the beer he ordered.
“Everyone knows.
“Good, mostly. Or, fine, I guess,” Dean catches a frown on Cas face when he spares a glimpse away from the road, “My sister visited.”
“No, but they’re just D’s,” Dean argued.
Before he can compliment Meg on it, Dean comes up to him, “Where’s your pie? I’ve been looking forward to it all evening!”
Before he can think Dean says: “Well, I am.” And when Cas smirks, he blushes beet red despite the alcohol. Instead of making matters worse, he grabs a ping pong ball from the cup of water and gives it to Cas.
“You don’t enjoy it?” he feels compelled to ask. Between a deadbeat, pocket money-stealing dad and a hungry little brother Dean has had an array of shitty jobs growing up, ranging from babysitting, busing tables and retail. And some shadier stuff, but he tries not to think about that. He knows coworkers can really make a shitty job endurable. Even Meg is nice to have when Crowley really gets going.
Dean tugs his lower lip in between his teeth and nods, “Mhmm.”
They make it to the parking lot and Dean has all the intention of opening the car door for Cas, but it’s hard when Cas’ intention seems to be pushing Dean against it, fisting the lapels of his jacket and pressing their chests together.
“No, I don’t
“Huh?” Cas says.
Dean is at Coffee and Eat with Benny and Charlie, eating paninis and flipping through notes on Saturday. They don’t have the same major, Benny doesn’t even go to the same school as them, and Dean gives Charlie a look over her laptop when she asks him some bullshit question about codes and programming again.
Dean tried his hardest not to slam any doors for the next week and instead put all his frustrations and heartbreak into rehearsals. So much so that Mrs. Engel eventually had to tell him to take a day off before he’d get an injury if he kept going.
“Okay.” Castiel says, nodding and begins walking again.
“Yes, just with the exams and stuff. It's been... quite a bit more stressful to maintain a porn career next to a grad school work load. In was not a problem in undergrad. I’ve been contemplating applying for a student loan next semester, and then I’ll get my masters in a year, which hopefully means I can find a job I’m passionate about,” Castiel tells Dean, and Dean can’t help but be surprised.
“Cheesy,” Cas complains. He gets out some clothes and sits down on the bed next to Dean’s legs to pull them on.
So Dean is still there, alone. There’s an empty mug, plate and glass pushed to the edge of his four-man table, notes spread across the surface. He’s too absorbed to think about refills right now.
, and it’s clear that you can’t handle that. And then you take it out on me. So
Castiel’s grand romantic ending did not go according to plan. He had let Charlie and Hanna go, meaning his ride was gone. Then he’d lingered in the hallways until he got creepy stares for not talking to anyone and sweating bullets while mumbling to himself.
At least a lot of their shared time is spent at the library. Dean thinks he could actually maybe take Cas' comp exam for him in a few months. (No, he can't, he's not sure he can even take his own).
Castiel frowned, “I thought you were a lesbian?”
Dean winks at him. “Affectionate.”
He’d carried the three mugs with him (he’s been a waiter for too long) and set them on the only corner of Cas’ table that wasn’t covered in microbiology lab reports and comp notes.
“Wow,” Castiel breathes. He’s looking at Dean who’s squinting against the sun, holding up his hand to shield against it. He’s wearing another ratty t-shirt and dirty cargo shorts and as he smiles at Cas. Cas finds himself thinking it again, he’s the most beautiful thing Cas has ever seen.
Castiel held out the plate with the muffin, eyes big and blue and right on Dean.
“You wanna go eat instead of this?” Benny asks, prepared to forget about the snacks he just bought.
Dean barks out a laugh at that and Meg smirks. The bartender finds empty glasses and looks at Dean while she pours, “You’re not driving tonight, are you?”
Castiel looks down at himself then back up at Dean, not sure how to reply.
“’Morning,” Bobby says gruffly, trucker cap pulled down to shield his hungover eyes.
After dinner, when the sun has set and their uncle has gone to bed, they’re sitting on the deck outside under the stars with a handful of drinks, and Anna’s boyfriend whispers something to Anna when Cas pulls Dean in between his legs to wrap his arms around him. Dean doesn’t hear it, but Gabriel does. And he’s offended.
Cas shrugs. “Who knows with these people?” He finishes the last sip of his wine. “Let’s go to bed.”
Upon deciding that Castiel was not to be single for much longer, Dean started arranging their study dates to be at a cafe in town. If their sessions took place in a public place where you can eat, it was practically a legitimate date, he figured.
“I don’t know… It’s- KU has a good program,” Castiel says and picks his menu back up.
“I’m terribly sorry, guys, but we have to give up your table in fifteen minutes. There’s a reservation for it at 9.”
He walks up to Cas and slips his arm around his waist. His T-shirt is damp with sweat because it’s been a hot day and he’s drunk and surrounded by a lot of people. His dark hair curls against his forehead and he smiles broadly up at Dean, grabbing him around the waist right back.
Dean gaped, “You can’t be serious!”
Cas sighs. “I think I may as well agree. It’s not like you’ll remember this conversation tomorrow.”
“Fucking work, you stupid high-tech, touch screen piece of
“Well, I was just about getting enough of this so you came at the right time,” he’d gestured to the stacks of paper.
“Then come,” Cas says. “Come all over your ugly apron.”
“Just... he’s doing it for the grades. They always are,” she says.
“Do you live alone?” Castiel asks, coming to stand next to Dean in the middle of the living room.
Castiel stopped behind a row of lockers, out of Dean’s view, and grabbed Charlie’s arm, “Wait,” he whispered.
Castiel raises his eyebrows in surprise, “Really? That’s valuable information.” Dean can’t believe he talks like that.
“I am tutoring him,” Castiel protested.
disgusting!”
Dean slams the stapler into the wall, missing the soft part of the balloon that instead pops loudly.
Dean owes Bobby too much to disappoint him.
Dean’s arms wrap around Cas, warm palms on his back, and his mouth is hot and wet and delicious, and sharp when he grazes his teeth against Cas’ lower lip.
“I… don’t know. I think I will just give him the rose after the show,” Castiel mumbled.
prepared to see my big brother in stockings!”
Who the hell stole his assignment?!
Dean snickers.
Castiel bites his lip around a smile. “Well, Dean, if you had a porn persona, I’d still prefer you, too.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean shook his head vaguely, “I thought it was pretty obvious? I like you.”
Castiel grins at Dean while they shrug into their coats, “I’ve fallen quite behind on my schedule today. Thanks a lot.”
“Unclaimed,” she shrugs, “But I’m leaning towards the humanities. And I’ve taken a few law-relevant creds.”
“You’re still a little behind there, Clarence,” Meg nods at three shots lined up at Cas’ elbow. Cas turns to them and, one after one, he downs them, not pausing for salt or citrus even once.
“Goody!” Dean says and presents a pair of soft, well-worn flannel pants to Castiel. He leaves to let Cas change in private.
“Yeah I know. I shouldn’t have gone so far in-“ he says.
“We can go do it now,” Hanna suggested, and when Castiel agreed they packed up their things and made for the computer lab.
Cas clears his throat again, “I have a shoot.”
Dean swallows and worries his lower lip. Are they being that obvious? Dean doesn’t think so. Someone would have said something.
“Fine,” Pamela rolls her eyes. “If he doesn’t laugh, I’m telling him it was your idea.”
Dean really wants to know what he said, but he’s certainly not going to ask. He doesn’t know any of these people. He hopes Cas will ask but he, apparently, doesn’t find it to be his place either.
“I thought that was just to get out of studying,” Castiel said, still confused at Dean’s admission.
He figured he’d start with answering Dean’s immediate question, so he gestured to the sidewalk in front of him with the half-dead rose, “Uhm… Walking.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “Just get in, okay? Please?”
And this is the worst part. When Cas spends the night, he has to sneak out in the morning. Because why would Dean’s nerdy friend be spending the night? They’ve used the ‘fell asleep watching a movie’ excuse a couple of times but it’s not believable three times a week.
Dean leans his hand on the edge of the bar, grinning in that way that always works. “And how do you feel about the fraternity kind then?”
Sam is right; Dean never has been this strung out over schoolwork. And this is his second year of grad school. He’s not sure what has changed; he used to not care about grades or comments, as long as he passed the course. Dean thinks it might be because he’s so stressed out about the financial stuff that it tears on his focus and confidence in other areas too. God, he hates his dad for doing this and he hates his bank for letting his dad do it.
Dean appreciates the Valentine’s offer, but how anyone could ever take a date here, he would never understand. And it’s not like he’s hard to impress, but the Burger Shack is just a Biggerson’s with a different color scheme, and Dean would have to have been fed some fun brownies to go here on a date.
“Things have changed a bit. I have a different contract now. I have for a while actually. I don’t do… partner stuff anymore,” he tells Dean, which Dean doesn’t really know what means. Cas can tell from his squinting, “Just solo stuff. Here,” he points to where he’s seated, “In my apartment. Uhm, live stuff.”
“Sure.” Dean sits up and wraps an arm around Cas’ middle, and runs the other hand under his shirt. “When are you gonna take your clothes off again?” he says, teeth grazing Cas’ throat.
, you dumbass!”
“I was
“No,” he’s talking quietly, like Crowley is
“Charlie!” Dean lets go of Cas’ hand to lean down and give her a hug. “Yeah, I got back a week ago.”
Meg excuses her self to go smoke a cigarette and Dean compliments the cinnamon-to-sugar ratio.
“What is it, sweetie?” she did not look up from her phone.
“Why didn’t he say anything?” Dean asks.
Dean shrugs, “I mean, he’s still into me. I don’t know, maybe he’s just embarrassed,” Dean wonders. The age difference is quite large. It’s very obvious when they’re out together. At least no one’s mistaken them for father and son. He shudders at the thought.
Dean leans against the table across from Sam, “Ugh, no. Yes. I don’t know, just put me out of my misery!”
Cas hands the jar back, finished while Dean held his mosquito monologue. Cas doesn’t reply, mostly because he’s not sure what to say.
Dean’s expression lightened up into a smile, “Well then, what are you doing on Saturday?”
And that’s when they finally remember where they are. The alligators were clearly disturbed by their yelling, and several of the big ones are in the water now, headed for their little boat.
“Well, you did just point out that he ‘fucks for a living’, like he somehow owes you for doing it professionally,” Sam says and Dean groans.
“Yes,” Cas nods solemnly. “We better go get your stuff right away.”
“That’s a fucked up sense of humor, dude,” Sam says, and Dean’s sure his nose is all scrunched up.
He waves him over, “Hey Cas,” he says, “You off the water wagon tonight?” It’s obvious from the beer bottle in his hand.
He gets along with Gabriel like a house on fire on the other hand.
Cas returns the sentiments as he’s putting on his dorky converse all stars. Dean really wants to kiss him again as he stands there in mostly Dean’s clothes and an obvious bedhead.
Cas keeps brushing his teeth, shrugging. He
Dean shrugs like it’s not a big deal, then swallows. “Especially since you told me they all hate me.”
Dean swirls the last dregs of his beer in the bottle. “What was that about?”
1. The obvious one.
Dean leans back to meet Cas’ eyes, resting their foreheads together “Fuck yes, I do,” he says, and he already looks completely debauched.
“I’ve suggested different things. Parties, yeah, but also concerts, movies, karaoke night, even poetry slam!” Dean lists.
In the end it turns out to be a lot of fun, and Benny and Dean are invited back as a duo the next week. They even make 100 dollars between them, which they instantly buy shots with, and everyone ends up getting spectacularly drunk, and Dean vaguely remembers Cas fucking him in the bathroom stall in the club. When Ruby catches them on their way out, she laughs, “You’ll fit right in here!”
He wakes up in Dean’s hut, Dean sitting against the wall next to him on their shared mattress. They haven’t been at Dean’s much, for obvious reasons (it’s a disgusting hut in a swamp, basically, and doesn’t have a shower), and also because of Sam and the lack of privacy. But they’d come in late last night and agreed to stay here for the night.
“Dean, your asshole is also good-looking,” Cas deadpans under a mountain of pillows.
It prompts a laugh out of Meg, “Oh, c’mon Cee. You looked cute. Very cookie-cutter.”
“Dean?” Cas says.
“History?” Dean asks when Castiel tells him his major (again), and whistles, “Damn, that sounds dry.”
happen. Cas had been content with making out at any chance at the bar as well as all the way home in the Uber, and then they’d both had too much to drink and gone straight to sleep once they’d gotten home. And that had been fine. If it hadn’t been paired with the blatant rejection the next day.
“Hey, you coming to Jody’s thing later?” Dean asks then. He grabs the hockey mask, getting ready to pull it down as he can hear the next group getting closer.
Castiel nods. There is another one of those weird silent moments where they stare at each other.
“Twenty-six today.”
He’d been at Cas’, finishing up an assignment one morning before meeting him in the shower. He’d closed it but hadn’t packed it in his bag, just leaving it at the edge of the table. So Castiel wasn’t entirely to blame. Even if it was Cas who’d been looking over his shoulder as Dean entered the living room naked and wet after their shower, running two fingers up his inner thigh to scoop up jizz, licking his fingers with a playful smile after, just to get Cas to call him obscene.
They spend the week lathering each other up in ridiculous amounts of sun oil, sharing sun chairs and making out. The one cloudy day, they spend in bed, and when they finally emerge late into the afternoon, Dean can’t meet Cas’ family’s eyes.
“You didn’t tell me you got a passing grade in biology,” Castiel mentioned, pulling a notebook out from his bag.
Dean doesn’t usually blush around Sam, but he can feel his blood burning all the way out to the tips of his ears as he coughs awkwardly. “Uhm,” he mumbles, “I wanna keep this conversation PG.”
*Got all the ideas for a 'verse but a schedule full of accounting classes and a newborn.
“I’m sorry! Ugh, it’s just… This shit is so boring!” Dean complained, “I don’t know how you can find this interesting!”
Dean cuts him off, “I just mean I don’t deserve it like Sam do. He's worked for this shit his whole life. You know, he’ll do great things. I’ve only gotten this far because no one has seen through my bullshit yet.”
Castiel cleared his throat and fiddled with a sheet of notebook paper. Dean felt guilty that he made him uncomfortable. Then he remembered that he knew one of those two gay guys at Castiel’s school.
Dean swallows. Does that sound kind of suggestive? Is he just being weird? Is Cas?
Dean rests his elbows on the table, “It wasn’t really ‘gap years’. I wasn’t planning on going to college. Wasn’t even planning on graduating high school if I hadn’t been forced to.”
“I honestly had another picture in my head when I said you should eat a proper meal,” Dean grins. They’re at a diner a few blocks from campus, two Cokes between them and freshly served bacon cheeseburgers.
Meg is the next one to round in on him.
Then she came back around the corner and her and Castiel left the locker room.
Ellen looks like she wants to say
It’s in some old building where Dean has never had a class. Maybe because it’s some lame literature elective that has nothing to do with anything, least of all Cas’ major. He just thought it was interesting because he’s such a nerd.
“Oh my god! I knew it was someone at this school, but I didn’t imagine it was
“Clarence! Come to win your man back?” Meg, the asshat, says to him.
“Fuck. Cas, come ‘ere,” Dean whispers now that it’s too late. He holds out his hand for Cas to take, which he does and they squeeze together in the middle of the boat as far from the railing as possible, which isn’t that far for such a small boat.
(He’s not sure he needs that space anyway).
liar,” Sam says, raising his eyebrow at him.
Castiel looked up at him in surprise, “Oh, uh, yes. That would be nice. Thank you, Dean.”
Dean takes a sip and smiles expectantly at Cas.
Dean has never been more ready for a date. He’s generally the type who’s five minutes late, even when he tries his hardest not to be. It’s not his fault most times, really; he wasn’t the one who decided it’s only 60 minutes to an hour.
Dean looks almost frightened up at him. “What?”
you been in KC?” Dean wonders because so far he’s only ever seen him at the library and Coffee and Eat.
Charlie rolls her eyes and giggles, not taking Dean seriously, “What can we talk with him about then?”
He guessed none of that mattered anymore as he leaned forward, closing the few inches of space between them to press his lips to Dean’s.
“Maybe he doesn’t wanna do college things,” San suggests.
Dean licks his lips. He’s sick of these fucking heart-to-hearts. He’s been ignoring his own friends to avoid them, for christ’s sake. “I’m not ‘off’, okay?” he mocks, “I’m stressed out. I’m fucking stressed out about all this thesis and proposal shit, and working every shift I can on top of it, and I’m fucking exhausted!” he instantly feels bad for speaking that way to Cas, but did he really have to ask? It just makes it worse when people acknowledge it.
Cas gives him a look before shrugging. “Well, they’re back in style.”
Victor left to shower without any comment though, and it’s certainly not like Dean is going to
“Wasn’t that your assignment?” one asked.
“Uhm,” Cas hesitates.
And right now it’s requesting “One cappuccino and one cherry strudel, please.”
“Where do you go to school? I mean if you live out here?” Cas asks.
“Baby, will you promise me something?” Cas says.
“Oh,” Cas mumbles, the smile evident on his voice, “Yeah, I guess that would make it more obvious.”
In spite of his mother’s ‘no distractions’ rule (and Castiel’s, to be honest) Dean had already found a new object of his affections. An object with which he was already spending 4 hours a week. The object just didn’t know it yet.
In between the game and Castiel and Dean’s unspoken drinking competition they’re soon too drunk to keep up with the rules anyway, and the conversation starts flowing on it’s own.
“No, Dean, even though you are. I know what your GPA is. I told them you’re in a fraternity,” Cas says.
“Of Tolkien? You’re a self-proclaimed nerd, you must have read the books,” Dean grins teasingly.
“Okay,” Dean says. “I’ll take it.”
Sam entered his room fully, sitting on Dean’s bed, “Where are you going?”
Dean notices the staring, as people tend to do with Cas’ staring and this staring is amped up by like twenty so go figure. A blonde eyebrow appears over the sunglasses and full lips curl into a smirk.
Castiel leaned against the wall, fiddling with the edge of one piece of eggshell wallpaper overlapping the next, “There’s this show...”
“Yeah,” Dean still refused her eye, “Pretty much.” A glimpse of eye contact.
“Could hardly be worse,” Cas says. “Anyway, my uncle has a yacht and he invited me and my siblings on it with him for spring break. My siblings are bringing their boyfriend and girlfriend. I figured I might as well bring you to avoid being the fifth wheel.” Cas grins.
Cas comes to the rescue: “Yes well, siblings are a treasure.”
they’re not gonna let that shit fly. They’ll give your part to Bartholomew or something!” he wrinkled his upper lip in disgust at the mere idea.
Instead of knocking, Sam kicked the door in. The cherub was glad that he could make himself invisible to humans at will, so that he didn’t risk being held responsible for the broken door.
“And doing molly at burning man. It was like being 25 again,” Gabriel finishes. “That was pretty much how my summer went.”
After getting ready Dean made his way to the kitchen, “Hey mom,” he said, kissing her cheek, “I’m headed back out.”
“These are my friends, Benny and Dean,” Charlie gestures towards them.
He can’t pick up more hours; he simply doesn’t have the time. Sam can’t pick up more hours at the bookstore either because he’s prone to stress. He’d feel bad for asking Bobby again, but that is an option. He’s just trying to think of a different solution first.
(Because Dean could never hate him).
Castiel smiled to himself before locking eyes with Dean and reaching his hand out to rest on top of Dean’s, “Me too.”
Dean gets back up without hesitation. Anything is better than this agony, “Great idea! Pizza?”
“Mosquito repellent?” He holds out a jar of a light green balm. Castiel accepts the jar and turns it to read ingredients but he finds none. Actually, the balm seems to be in a empty jar from Lush. He squints. He knows some mosquito repellents have a lot of nasty stuff in them. Especially if they are effective.
“Well, that won’t get you any tips, princess,” Crowley states and makes himself an espresso, “Lighten up, you have to sell the muffins, they’re only good till today.” And then he disappears into the staff room.
The mood is a lot lighter after that. Their plates are cleared and they skip dessert in favor of another round of beer. And another one. Dean’s friends aren’t going to be there till 9 anyway.
“There’s nothing to forgive, Cas,” Dean said softly, a finger trailing along the curve of the steering wheel.
Dean squints at her, “You saw one of his videos?”
“He is the most annoying person on the planet and he has no respect for other people’s property,” Castiel clenched his fist and Dean thought that was kind of adorably amusing.
pay for dinner.”
Bobby hums an agreement. He has to drive the one mile back that Cas has managed to walk to turn the jeep around.
Castiel did not react, not wanting to give in to yet another of Dean’s distractions.
“Yeah, sorry man,” Dean rubs a hand over his face. “I’m an early riser and I didn’t wanna wake you. Figured I’d come down and make sure the boat was alright for us to go out today.”
It’s hot, fucking scorching, and Dean has waited
“Hey cutie,” she greets him and closes one eye to better aim the stream of sambuca into the shot glass.
Cas smiles at Dean. “I do, actually.”
They cover an array of topics (and a lot of complaining about examination committees) and after a while the topic goes back to family. To Sam.
The cherub remembered that humans generally had weird hang-ups about nudity, and that his kind’s usual attire - or lack thereof - was uncommon on Earth in most - but not all - social settings.
Dean exhales. He squeezes Cas’ hip in thanks. “But I feel like shit hiding you away.”
“Dean, I know you’re a crazy OCD perfectionist, but it’s your first time and you said you were only doing it for laughs, so you really need to stop taking it so seriously.” Cas is taking the foam-pillows out of Dean’s hands, discarding them on the floor. And Dean swallows. What did he do to deserve a man like Cas, anyway?
He tries to relay it in the way he moves his lips against Cas’, in how he tangles his fingers in his hair, presses his body against him.
He puts his piece of toast down and turns serious, “hey, look, if this was just,” he gestures between them and hesitates, “like,” he shakes his head. “If this was just, you know, fun and ‘cause you were here and I was here, then don’t sweat it.”
Dean is sitting on the floor across from her. He puts his four cards face down on the table. “Well, ‘cause I’m a fucking adult for one. And there’s nothing predatory about Cas.”
Sam comes home on Sunday afternoon and Dean is eating dinner of a takeout cheeseburger in front of the TV.
But after a while, they mesh together and Dean ends up on his back, Castiel sprawled half on top of him and he has really sharp elbows but also very soft lips so it’s okay. It doesn’t heat up again, but Dean thinks they need to start slow.
everyone around these parts, even Cas now as he’d been there for a few weeks. And he doesn’t much want people to probe around in his sex life (or, you know) but he also wanted Dean to be safe. They hadn’t talked about it, but Cas just figured, Bible Belt and age difference and all.
He licks his hand, and then Dean pulls him back by his hair to meet his eye, because it just got serious, “Now, Cas.”
But for once, it’s not.
“Sorry, I gotta go,” Dean says to Cas, turning on the flashlight again.
“Hey Cas! Food’s just done,” he greets him.
Cas doesn’t lose interest and Dean falls asleep before the team has even made it to the finals.
Mary gave him a knowing smile, “I’m thinking it’s not all rehearsals, sweetie. I can smell your cologne.”
Bobby looks where he’s pointing. “Ah, there he is.” He leaves the office hut and walks briskly down the dock.
Sam turns it down, “what was it that you have to do anyway? Something at a gay bar?”
“Yes, of course. I have the space and my neighbors are all well-behaved,” Castiel grins, and Dean wonders if the weird vibe between them is something he has imagined.
“Yeah, it’s not… I just don’t understand why you don't trust me enough to let me in?” Sam looks so sad with his scrawny shoulders slumped like that and Dean isn’t going to cry.
It is only till next semester that the black car starts occupying the parking spot again. This time it is forgivable, as Castiel and Dean have coordinated their classes, and leave their apartment together most days.
“Hey Dean? What are Castiel and I going to do all night?” Sam asks. They’re exiting the movie theater and the freak still hasn’t finished his soda. It was a medium-sized coke! Dean had finished his super-size
Castiel frowned, “That’s what you want to do on a Saturday night? Study with me?”
“Dude!” Dean protests, “Do I give off a slutty vibe or something?”
“Your 'mama' give you a bunch of shit too?” Benny asks from his seat in shotgun.
“Dean, why didn’t you tell me you did drag?” Sam sips his juice. The freak ordered pineapple and spinach juice. Dean didn’t do as great of a job of raising him as he’d thought.
Gabriel looks at Anna. “You okay with that?” he asks, disbelief in his voice.
(It’s not like Dean isn’t enjoying the non-sexual aspects of the relationship. It’s actually really nice, the cuddling, the cooking for each other, the proof reading papers and back massages. But he is
He had drawn two robots fighting in a Walmart parking lot under one equation when Castiel finally reacted.
Sam gives him a disgusted look, “how do you put up with this?” he asks Castiel.
“Well, I think I lost it,” Dean complained.
“Oh,” Cas says.
That’s all over once they make it to the elevator though, and it’s Cas’ fault, really, because he’s the one who grabs Dean’s hand, lacing their fingers.
Dean doesn’t kiss Cas goodbye beyond his own room. All his frat brothers are milling about, packing for home trips, decorating for the holidays and day drinking a little bit because the holidays have started.
The snout appears right before the motor and Cas is sure about what comes next. Teeth, screaming, blood, death.
but he’s scared.
And it’s hard. So hard. Dean misses him.
Dean messes around with the dough while goofing off like he always does, the dork. But it takes Cas’ mind off the Meg situation and by the time Anna comes back to scold Dean for having left his partner to do all the work, Cas is even smiling.
spot.
“Did someone finally get the cute porn star's number?” she tweaks an eyebrow at him and he just smiles like the doof he is.
“You toned asshole,” Dean grins and pulls on boxers. He’s not going to wear pants today, and he’s not sure Sam can’t handle him in panties right now.
Castiel’s smile lights up the room, “I’m glad.” Then he smirks and leans forward slightly (and actually smirks! Dean’s ever only seen him do that on film) “Does that mean I get to kiss you again?”
Castiel takes a bite of his strudel. Dean folds his hand around his mug, letting the warmth seep through.
“Probably doesn’t help that you waited to the last second to decide,” Dean points out.
Dean shrugged, rising to his toes one foot at a time, “Who cares?”
When she comes back out Dean excuses himself to go to the restroom and sits in there for fifteen minutes trying to calm down and do his fucking job until Charlie comes knocking on the door to ask: “You okay in there?”
November 5
“I do. I’m a grad student. Microbiology.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I thought you guys left?”
“Dude! How’d you end up with a dude?” Charlie says a little too loudly and Dean shushes her, checking again if anyone he knows is within hearing range.
Dean doesn’t look at Cas. “The very ones.”
The guy looks surprised but not put off, "Okay, a bit sudden, but I think I can make it work."
“We’ll keep close together,” Dean assures him, entwining his arm with Cas’, and opening the squeaking gate to take the first few steps onto the gravel path.
has a girlfriend.
They don’t really get up again until January 2nd.
Balthazar is whistling loudly while scrambling eggs for everyone.
“Dude,” Sam says, “When are you gonna introduce me to this person? You’ve been seeing them for what, a month?”
“Oh,” Meg lifts an eyebrow, surprised. “Odd.” She thinks for a second, “Money then.”
“Ugh, I don’t know. I dress like a fucking lesbian, it’s not gonna work out,” she mumbles.
Castiel doesn’t come further into Dean’s space but rests his shoulder against the doorway. Smart, since he can hear the next group at Charlie’s station already. Cas smiles at Dean, and even with the rubber goo in his hair and all over his nerdy clothes, Dean melts a little. Gets a little gooey, if you will.
They started making their way out of the computer lab towards their next class, “Do as Charlie says: call him.”
“Yes, Dean,” he ran his fingers over Dean’s knuckles, “Always.”
“Castiel?” Fate gave him a hopeless look.
Another part of the reason is that they seem to be moving so damn
“Did you hear that?” Cas whispers.
Castiel thought over Dean’s words but didn’t think his conclusion made any sense. Sure, they got along better now than in the beginning, and maybe they could even be considered tentative friends but it didn't make sense to Cas, “What are you saying?”
Until Cas texts
Castiel only lets go of Dean’s face to rub his hand against the hard bulge in Dean’s pants.
“Uh, yeah? Where are you going-?” Castiel was cut off.
“What do I know?” He gestures to Cas, “Cas is a business major, he might.”
an apology!
“Oh yeah, real romantic,” She gave Dean a pointed look and sucked on her straw, gesturing silently to the empty junk food wrappers on the table and floor in front of them, and the screaming kids playing laser tag in the next room.
September 29
“Damn,” someone commented from his left, and Castiel turned around to see. The movement was too sudden, and his books fell out of his backpack, pages folding under their weight. Castiel groaned.
When Pamela’s other eyebrow joins the first one in a knowing look, Dean mutters a “Shut up.”
“I can't pretend like I agree with that lifestyle,” the boyfriend says, still keeping his voice down like everyone isn’t staring at him.
But they’re not gonna talk about it now either, and Cas quickly gets the tube and cardboard box from the plastic bag in his bedroom.
“Hey,” he says softly, carding his fingers through Cas’ bed head. And down his bare back, when he can’t help himself, barely past the waistband of his boxers.
She was sitting on the floor, elbows planted on the floor between her thighs, and red hair coming undone from her braid. Dean wondered how much trouble she got in for that. Some teachers did not care as long as long hair was tied up, but Mrs. Naomi Engel accepted nothing but netted buns on the girls.
Dean huffs, “What, because I’m already fat?!” and instantly feels like, if the other queens and the audience could see him right now, he’d win.
“Yes, Meg, I’m aware of what you are saying. And it’s very rude,” Castiel meets her eyes, glaring.
He blushes the second the words have left his mouth because he’s frustrated and ‘Jimmy Novak’ is
“Hm?” Cas asks, already walking away, facing Dean for a few steps more.
Dean’s not sure if he pales or blushes but he wants to die right at that moment, “Oh uh,” he clears his throat, “I meant in school. We should have taken some of the same credits, right?”
“Heh, yeah,” Dean says apologetically despite himself, cheeks still on fire.
Cas stops moving behind him and pulls Dean’s ass flush against his hips. Dean pants.
The fuck kinda wine are they drinking, Dean wonders.
Now, if I may have the honor,” the cherub said.
They finally let Castiel in and he toed off his shoes before following the brothers into the kitchen. There he dumped his book bag on a bar stool before greeting Mary.
“Dean, you don’t have to. Not right now,” Cas, endlessly patient saint that he is, says. “I know how hard it is to come out. I’m not going to pressure you.”
Bobby drives Dean to the airport on the 27th of December. They don’t talk on the drive, Dean nervously humming Metallica already.
The next time they meet each other Dean knows he’s not hallucinating but he kind of wishes he were.
Castiel frowns, “Don’t you have your own dish to finish?”
Dean rolls his eyes at Cas, but takes his offered hand.
“Don’t you got other shit to do than ogle me?” Cas asks. He throws the used towel on the floor in the bathroom and walks across the floor to the dresser.
“If you didn’t work there I don’t believe I’d be quite so social myself,” Castiel says way too genuinely for what Dean is prepared for.
Dean twists the bottle opener into the cork of the wine (he’d bought the fancy kind – the fancy $25 kind), “Nah, I have debt already so I can’t get approved. It’s actually a pretty fucked up situation.” He twists the cork out and it audibly pops. He gets them a couple of glasses and then finally sits down across from Cas.
“Hey Champ,” Benny says, and Dean can’t read whether Benny saw him and Cas on his face. “What are you doing here?”
“Seriously? I know you’re going to be a doctor but don’t you ever just wanna party with your friends or something?” Dean scooted his chair closer to Castiel.
“Oh my god, are you just gonna act out one of his porns when you get a home run?” Benny asks and Charlie nearly falls of her chair laughing.
bonding time. “Sure thing, mom.”
Castiel frowned and turned to see who Dean was making eyes at. When he saw the blonde, he turned back to glare at Dean, annoyed at his lack of attention, “If you find it hard to concentrate at the library, perhaps we should study elsewhere.”
“Do you wanna go back to my place? We could watch a movie and then study after if we’re up for it?” Dean suggested.
“Who are you tutoring? A freshman?” Hanna asked. She lived just a block away from school and Castiel was going in that direction anyway.
Dean’s frown deepened and he held on to Castiel to keep him in place, “I know what you’re trying to do. I’ll have you know I got a B on the last test. And a 100% score on the preposition part.”
gone out a few years ago.
“I don’t know,” Dean shrugs. “They’re not expecting some bookish type, are they?”
Dean smiles back before he remembers why he most certainly is not fucking
Castiel smiles wistfully, “I suppose I can’t help being a little upset. I view intimacy a lot differently than what my peers tend to.” Dean doesn’t get to ask what that means.  “I do appreciate you telling me. And that you didn’t have sex with him. I guess that means you’re Team Rachel.” Castiel’s smile turns a little more genuine.
“It’s from Cas. You said he was too much of a nerd to be in a frat,” Sam says.
Before Benny can say anything, Dean raises his hands to put an end to this, “Listen guys, I don’t think we can call him cute porn guy anymore now, okay?”
Dean rolled his eyes again and checked his fly, “What’s wrong now?”
upset, I know you are. And we were just in a fight. It’s not like… Things weren’t final between us or anything.” Dean explains.
Castiel chuckles too and his eyes are shining from the wine and the TV light, “He’s quite a character.”
Dean gapes. “Wha-“
Before Dean can reply Crowley has finally had enough, “Get back to work, girlfriends!”
“Dean! There you are. What did you guys get up to for so long?” Sam asks from where he sitting on the couch.
Dean got up and dusted off his butt, “Hm. Well, no worries.” He turned to walk with Castiel, “I have the car on Mondays. I could pick you up from school?”
The next morning Castiel wakes to an empty hut. He’s feeling a little disoriented and takes in the made bed across from him. He frowns at it and hurries to get dressed.
Used to sneaking around, it takes Dean a couple of hours to get used to Cas freely groping him. But then he does get used to it. Boy, does he.
It dawns on Castiel that this guy made the same mistake Castiel did and thinks Castiel is a parking inspector. And Castiel cannot really come up with a better excuse. Staring into the face of this beautiful man he knows he needs to get out fast, and this seems like as good an opportunity as any.
Castiel almost swore at him, and Dean felt good that things were more comfortable between them.
Cas points and Dean shines his light on the bush, that really is rustling in a way that’s not the wind. He grabs Cas’ bicep, and Cas puts his hand over Dean’s.
Dean looks at the brown liquid filling his cup, “’Fraid not, dude. You making root beer rum cream or something?”
“I can’t imagine I spend any more time on school than you do, Dean,” Castiel argued, and huh, he was probably right. But dancing was fun. Math? Not so much.
“I stress-email my professors in the middle of the night,” Dean grins.
“Well, yes, I think I’d like to come. Are you having a party?”
They finished in comfortable silence aside stray questions about scholastics and then they made their way through the library, Dean texting away on his phone. He looked up and around, and slapped Castiel’s arm upon spotting a vending machine, “Hey, I need a redbull. Do you want anything?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, Gabriel just laughed, and Anna asked how we even met, because she thinks I’m a loser who can’t make friends,” Cas says, rolling his eyes.
“Aw,” Cas deadpans because he’s an asshole who can’t handle romance. “What if I was just staying on campus all week?”
Ash doesn’t reply, and they just sit in companionable silence for a while, looking at Netflix’s suggestions because they saw Resident Evil.
Dean peaks out between his fingers, his eyelashes catching on a ring, “Cas brought my brother.”
,” Dean rubs his hand over his eyes.
Cas sighs and rubs his temples. “Why do you want my family to think I’m dating an idiot?”
It remains quiet between them as Cas’ dick softens, until Dean feels Cas tense, readying to move.
And that’s true, but Dean couldn’t come up with anything better under the circumstances.
Dean didn’t really understand it. He had never had a type, and if he did, it certainly hadn’t been the nerd. Anna was a hot, goody two shoes nerd, and they couldn’t connect? But who else in Dean’s life was a hot, goody two shoes nerd? It didn’t really make sense, but hey, what are you gonna do?
Dean turns to take in the ghosts hanging from the apple tree and the spiderwebs across the gutters. There are small tombstones across the grass in an indiscernible pattern.
Castiel stands back up, “You’re welcome,” he says with a smile like Dean didn’t just totally embarrass himself by throwing a bitch fit over two sheets of paper.
Sam pursed his mouth, looking a little uncomfortable. “They’re in the room next-door.”
“Yeah,” Castiel agrees. “I guess you could call them… screamers.”
Castiel chews his food and swallows, “Shouldn’t you get to have a future?”
Castiel has his burger between his hands, grease already running down one wrist. Dean finds that he wants to lick him. “I’ll eat a vegetable tomorrow, I promise,” Castiel says, focus on the burger as his twists it to see where it’s easier to bite off. “Besides it’s nice to spend time with someone who’s not my mentor for once,” he finally takes a bite and Dean knows he’s staring, especially when the tip of Cas’ tongue drifts out to catch a crumb.
The drink their coffee and eat for a while, talking, before Dean brings the tray and the empty plates and cups back to the kitchen.
Dean nods in recognition, “Ah, yeah, that one’s pretty good.”
Dean spends the rest of the day and most of the night locked up in his room. He tries to pack for his home trip for Christmas but he can’t. He mostly paces the floor with his face buried in his hands.
Dean wonders what just came out of his mouth, because surely a psych major has heard crazier things that what Dean thinks he just said.
He tries to rope in Victor to play with him, but he declines, he wants to go do a keg stand in the yard. Dean’s about to ask Pamela when he spots dark hair and a dark green flannel that Dean could have worn himself. He throws the ping pong ball in his direction, missing entirely but getting his attention anyway.
There is one thing that can pull him from his thoughts on protein structure and function though. That can pull him from just about anything.
And Dean’s brain is currently blowing a fuse but he knows that that’s in the med department.
It’s just that Castiel is soft-spoken and awkward and brilliant, and he’s always hanging out by himself and Jimmy is bossy and dom and can control a whole gangbang so maybe Dean’s brain just has a hard time connecting the two.
“But you can still get us out, right?” Cas asks, and he knows the hysteria is not in his voice because it never is.
Because here they are now, in Cas’ bed, Castiel leaning into Dean, a knee between the V of his legs where they grind together. Dean is all but humping Cas’ hip while Castiel runs a hand down his thigh and tugs on his hair with the other. Their lips are inseparable.
“That’s not long,” Castiel supplies.
There has to be explanation but Dean can't think of it as he finds himself and Benny dragged down to Rainbow by Charlie on Saturday afternoon, because apparently they have ‘open drag’ later that night, and Charlie wants to introduce them to someone.
Dean rings the doorbell and pulls at the sleeves of his mustard yellow sweater. It’s just a few minutes before seven.
Castiel shrugs, ”You’re sweet,” he says simply, with a soft smile across his face.
“What?” Dean feels so betrayed.
His voice calms Cas some, but it doesn’t last as the next alligator bumps into their boat.
Dean hums a few lines of the Monster Mash.
“Dude’s had two dicks in his ass at the same time. I don’t think he’s a prude,” Dean argues.
August 7
“No! Please do!” he says too eagerly and frowns at himself.
They sit in silence for a bit. It isn’t awkward but it’s not entirely comfortable either, though their hands are still clasped in Cas’ lap. Dean can’t stop thinking about this new piece of information. Has Castiel just never been interested in dating before? Then what about Dean has made him change his mind? And does this mean that Cas has never had sex off screen before? Or been taken out for dinner?
Castiel doesn’t step back when Dean steps into the hallway and they end up standing very close. Dean looks expectantly up at Cas, wondering what he wants. Don’t they have some place to be? Should they go back inside? Ask Sam to leave instead…
It’s not that bad yet. Sam has a savings account if it gets really bad. But he also has a law school ambition that’s just getting closer, and Dean really doesn’t want to ask Bobby again, and the worries are starting to take a toll.
Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes in this, I was watching RuPaul's Drag Race while editing.
“I said I’d listen to your presentation but I know fuck-all about this programming crap,” he argues and she about to counter when the bell above the door chimes behind Dean, signaling a customer’s entrance. It barely registers anymore, he’s not at work and it’s Meg and Alfie’s problem right now. But Charlie shuts her mouth and her eyes turn wide as she looks at Dean and to the customer behind him. She tries not to laugh so Dean turns around and makes eye contact with fucking Jimmy Novak, and fuck why does this keep happening?
“That’s my car,” the guy says, pointing at it and frowning at Castiel. And he is hot too. Castiel groans on the inside.
“It had better,” Dean mumbles back, ghosting his lips across Cas’ shoulder. “Wake up and eat it.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. He doesn’t understand the game Dean is playing tonight. He cuts both Dean and Meg a slice though. He tries to focus on Meg’s reaction, but somehow his eyes drift over to Dean who forks off the tip of the slice, inspects the bite for a second and then closes his lips around the bite. He drags the fork out between his lips and Castiel doesn’t look at them. It’s just that Dean has a little bit of powdered sugar in one corner of his mouth, and he’s gifted with really great genes. But he’s not staring.
He hears Cas inhale sharply, and then Cas is taking his wrist out of Dean’s reach, but only to lace his fingers through Dean’s.
“Night Dean,” Cas replies. “Thank you for saving us today.” The last part comes out very quiet.
or anything. But he’s not exactly rolling in it either. Not like Cas.
All in all, they were all much too distracted to notice the happy couple sneaking off to consummate their bonding in the coat room.
“Hey man. Dean, like he said,” his hand is outstretched and Cas shakes it and earns himself a smile that makes Cas take a sec to remember that he’s here for business NOT pleasure.
Dean sails them down a branch they haven’t been down before. They don’t encounter any other sailors, and the forest is clearing up, the trees spacing out, becoming thicker, taller. The water gets clearer.
Cas swallows his water in one sip and holds his glass out. “Please.”
Castiel stops and looks at him. “It’s not a swamp, it’s a bayou.”
? What the fuck do you think it is?”
Balthazar puts the spatula down and turns off the stove. “I’ll go tell Chester to turn the boat around.”
When he thought about it he guessed he was mostly in his ratty old dance wear around Cas. And the uniform. “Well, right back at ya. You know, I don’t actually choose to wear that uniform,” Dean said and sat down next to his tutor.
Castiel had grinned big enough that he’d bit his lower lip to reel it in and then looked up at Dean through his eyelashes, “I think I can fit you into my schedule.”
Dean shrugs. “I have some plans. But I’d rather spend it with you if that’s what you’re asking.”
Sam appeared in the doorway to Dean’s room while Dean pulled out clothes to change into.
The bonding is ordered by Heaven, but those who know Dean and Castiel know that how it is in Heaven is not necessarily how it shall be on Earth.
Castiel pulls the note out of his pocket and reads it over once more.
They all smile awkwardly some more and then the waitress comes and apparently, they all have to fucking order now, and Dean hasn’t even looked at the menu. Not that he needs to. As long as it has cheese and bacon, he won’t complain.
Cas leans in even closer, ghosting his lips against the shell of Dean’s ear. “Who said anything about sleeping?”
A soft smile spread across Dean’s lips, “I love you too.”
date. There are two openly gay guys at my school, neither of whom I’ve exchanged more than two words with. There’s no one for me. Not that it’s any of your business.”
Dean corrects, “or get my dick sucked.”
, but seriously?
He has a double at the coffee house the next day because he has to pay rent somehow and he apparently looks stressed enough that even
“Beer, please, whatever you have on tap” he says then.
“Wednesday,” Dean shares.
He didn’t know when he’d next be able to meet Dean. He worried that if he called Dean, he simply wouldn’t pick up the phone, especially after what he’d said to Charlie that night.
Castiel’s heart sank.
Cas gives him a look. “I’m aware,” he deadpans. “But since I broke your old one, I think it’s fair that I get you a new one. This is just a way to get around the insurance companies.”
They were sitting in Dean’s mom’s car outside Castiel’s house later that night. They had been on a date and then made out in an empty field a little out of town until Dean had to risk a speeding ticket to get Castiel home before his curfew.
They’re seconds into Dean’s room before Dean is pressed up against his door with a face full of Cas. He can hear the lock as Cas turns it, and he grins against his mouth.
Castiel frowns and tries to grip Dean’s hand tighter when he tries to pull it away, “What’s wrong, Dean?”
Sam doesn’t say anything because he knows from all the other times that Dean will yell no matter how he tries to help.
Dean rolled his eyes but smiled at Cas, “You’re a fucking moron. If it was just to get out of studying then why would I ask you to come over? Just because you’re tutoring me it doesn’t mean I don’t want to spend time with out. I
go with this. A beat passed before he asked, “Are you single?”
He goes to sleep almost immediately after, in Sam’s bed, on top of his covers.
Castiel rearranges himself, curls one leg up under him. His breath is coming in short puffs too and his hair is a bigger mess than usual (and Dean wants his fingers back in it) “Nothing is wrong. You didn’t do anything. I just- I’m sorry, but I think there are some things we need to discuss, if this,” he motions between them, “is going to… Happen…”
“Listen I’m sorry about what I said out there. You’re not a lame professor. You’re actually really interesting. And you can stare at me all you want.”
Dean does sleep some. Just a little. He wakes up around 3am and kind of wants to call Sam. But it’d be 5am on a school day there. And also, what would he even say? The only thing Dean has told Sam about Cas is that he’s a nerd he sometimes drinks coffee with.
Dean doesn’t reply for a long time. Right as Cas is about to drift off he says “Don’t let the bed bugs bite,” and laughs when Castiel sits up with a “
“Wow, brother, grad school getting to ya?” Benny asks.
Castiel catches sight of Meg as she enters the Starbuck’s right as he’s ordering.
Mom gave him a look for a few moments, like she knew exactly what he was thinking, “I kind of got the impression you haven’t been getting too much tutoring done lately anyway,” she smirked.
“Still,” he holds the door open for Cas, “I promise I will get real food in ya some day.”
“I hate you. If you don’t wanna go, fine. But I’m not cooking anything today,” Sam says and folds his arms over his chest.
5. They’re different
“Ha ha,” Dean mumbles.
“Don’t take it out on me,” Cas mutters back.
Charlie wins and woops, then turns to Dean who’s finally getting back to playing against Benny, “You know, we’ve never officially met him.” She gestures between herself and Benny. “Can’t wait to party with a porn star again. It was so awesome when you dated Carmen in sophomore year!” she sounds too excited. Dean kind of thinks Charlie still has a crush on her.
close enough that Dean feels it’s okay for him to bring up Castiel’s porn star status.
Anna warms to him too. It takes a few days and a lot of Winchester charm but by the time Spring Break is over, Dean thinks Anna is the one gets along with best (save Cas, of course). Then, he always got along better with girls.
“I’m gonna fuck you now,” he says, voice low and straining.
