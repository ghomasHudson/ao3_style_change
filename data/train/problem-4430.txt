Charlie had wisely chosen Saturday for her day off, which Cas respected. He had to applaud her for giving herself a long weekend. He’d been reluctant at first because usually Saturdays were long busy days for them, but he could always count on her just in case it ended up being super busy or something happened.
“No. But is she right now if she’s with another girl?” No. She hadn’t been for a long time. But she’d felt like she was anyway. He could pretend that she was missing him too.
Castiel vividly remembered the few times that he hadn’t been able to come, because he’d had school work, because he was working on his thesis. “She always used to be different if I disappointed her, which I get. She got disappointed, you know.”
The last step creaked. Dean was upstairs now and soon he would open his bedroom door, pull it closed behind him and this all wouldn’t have happened. They’d forget about everything and eventually Cas would leave.
“Not that I know of. Let’s keep it on the counter with the rest of the stuff. I’m sure someone will come back if they miss it.”
It had hurt even more to hear her say that, but it had helped. Helped him close that part off. She’d wanted them to meet up at a random diner. It was the place that they had their first date, the place that she told him that she was pregnant. Weeks ago, he’d have hated it.
He was vaguely aware of the bell ringing, another stroller coming in through the door, Charlie meeting whoever it was in hushed voices.
Cas didn’t know where that was right now. Home felt like a foreign concept when your home was now no more than a pile of ashes that almost buried your daughter. Chills ran up his spine just thinking about it. She might as well not have been here. She might have been gone.
He knew the pain of screaming kids the entire night because the parents either forgot to say something or they just missed them more than well enough. It wasn’t easy or nice and if he could save Dean’s rest, that would be completely worth it.
The boy nodded his head at that. He didn’t seem to be getting more of a response . It almost looked like the boy would be asleep before he’d even read ten pages of the story.
The Winchester family had slowly become the only family he had after his parents had found out about him being into guys too and promptly ignored him. He hadn’t spoken to them since the only comment on his wedding was that as much as they hated Meg, at least she wasn’t a guy. But the Winchesters were that for him now. Family. Dean was family, but not in the way Cas wanted him to be.
Cas’s choice was Tuesday. It worked for him, and that was what was most important. A lot of the tasks that he wouldn’t get done on Saturdays he was in the shop alone got done on Monday, including a big clean of the entire shop before opening that he usually came about an hour early for.
It was only part of him now. Not all of him, like it had been before. Something about the way she’d not told her new girlfriend anything about them had made something inside him go sour. It had made him fall silent.
For a moment, he looked around the dark room, trying to figure out where Dean was. Had Dean gone to bed and fallen asleep there, but not wanted to wake him up? Should Cas hurry upstairs so that Claire wouldn’t wake him up?
Thankfully, he had good things to think about.He knew very well that the second that he left the shop and came home, he would eat something and then immediately start falling asleep on the couch. It was just the way things usually went. However, he already had plans for his day off. He was determined to not let anything push them to the side. Nothing would come between him and a good long night sleep, together with reading on the beach.
“It’ll be official.” It scared him. That all their ties would be cut. “She won’t be my wife anymore.”
important, even if they definitely still needed to keep an eye out. After they got out of the ER and admitted onto the ward, he’d been able to give her a bath and get all of the soot off of her.
“It’s nothing,” Cas assured him. “It’s nice that we know who the teddy belongs to and that he goes back to his owner. If it means you’ll sleep better, why not.”
“She didn’t - I usually don’t sleep that well after a job with kids.” He took a sip from the mug. “I’ll probably sleep more on the couch or something, sorry in advance. Working 24 hours at a time kills me sometimes.”
he thought to himself. They had never been that. Part of him was glad that at least with this girl, she was different. That this girl wouldn’t get the same treatment as him. He wouldn’t wish that on anyone.
“What are you up to?” Dean came downstairs in just his joggers, putting on the t-shirt that he had forgotten to take up with him. Cas had done some laundry earlier that day and Dean had been…impressed, for the lack of a better word.
“Claire has something for grandma,” Dean said with a small smile, before pulling the small bouquet of flowers from the stroller. They’d had a long talk about what to do about mother’s day, and how to explain to her once she was older.
now. That it could be restored, built up again. That maybe things wouldn’t be as bad. Maybe something could be salvaged. “We’ll have to go some place for a while.”
okay. Dean had asked him and pushed him when Cas needed it. He had been the one to make him talk about things when it was good for him, even if he hadn’t wanted to.
In a panicked moment, he looked for Claire, didn’t know where she was. It was only then that he heard her soft whimpers and saw her in the fold-out crib flush against to the bed that he calmed down. She was safe. Unhappy? Yes. But safe, and that was what felt most important to Cas.
He’d be escaping the feeling that he was a stranger in his own home and he would exchange it for the feeling that he didn’t even have a home anymore.
Maybe it had been a last minute thing and they’d called in pretty late. Maybe Ellen had tried to call him, but his phone would’ve gone straight to voicemail.
“Thanks for getting started,” he said, catching the pillow more gracefully than Charlie would’ve liked. She looked at him, disappointed. “Did you manage okay alone?”
Cas still felt uncomfortable, as if something was out of place. A force pulled him to the crib, told him: check on her. He didn’t know why it was there but it was. She should be just stirring in her bed, probably asking for a bottle. Even with her schedule messed up, she should be doing it. She really
Words did come out of Cas’s mouth, and the startling realisation that he no longer was falling struck him as odd. For a moment, he had to orient himself, from the bright light of the room to the hands at his shoulders, Dean’s worried face just inches from his. The clock, blinking back 04:26 pm in red lights. His daughter, sleeping in the co-sleeper next to him. Clean. Breathing. Not even aware that something had happened. She wasn’t blue, she was happy,
He texted a couple of people during the night, the people he knew would still be up. All of them came back with the same answer: they were really sorry but it just wasn’t possible right now. There was one more person he could call — two, technically, but he would rather avoid calling the last.
Eventually, after a week, she picked up. He didn’t know if what was worse. The fact that she hadn’t called him back all week, or the fact that a sleepy, other woman answered the phone instead of his almost ex-wife.
Finally, after years, Cas could do the things he’d always wanted to do: kiss Dean, hold him, be with him. Cas remembered being fifteen when he figured out that actually, he kind of liked the asshole. Liked him a lot. In a way, it had been Dean who made him realise that he might be bisexual.
The man carefully got up, attempting to move the sleeping kid without waking him back up again. He seemed to succeedl - for as much as the boy stirred, he only settled himself differently in his father’s arms.
“You don’t have to do it alone, man. But you gotta do it. Talk to me?” When Cas stayed silent, Dean shook his head. “What was she like? What were you guys like?”
Whoever her new girl toy was, she didn’t even know about them. About the fact that Meg was still married. That she had a daughter.
New faces, unclear of how long they would stay. Their arrival had gone unnoticed to Cas. He usually noticed tourists arriving, had them stop by asking where the summer cabin exactly was. If not that, Ellen usually let him know.
“Hey, I’m tired,” he mumbled, looking away from Dean, who now had his cat on his lap. “Would it be okay if I go and have a nap?”
“So what happened with the insurance?” Dean asked him, before passing him a cold beer. Claire was asleep inside, the baby monitor outside with them. Cas had wanted to stay inside and be with her, maybe take a nap, but Dean had dragged him outside and told him that it would do him good. “What’s going on there, man? You’ve seemed down ever since.”
“Remember this place?” Dean asked with a grin as they carried the stroller up the streets to an all too familiar house. The blue trim hadn’t changed, or the way that the flowers outside of the master bedroom bloomed, even though they weren’t supposed to. “How long has it been since we’ve been here, man?”
Castiel walked barefoot in the cooled down sand - shivers travelling up through his legs to the bottom of his spine. Night was slowly dawning on Fernweh, the sun disappearing in the ocean, leaving dark embers behind on the water. He loved walking on the beach in the dark, loved the rustling of the ocean, how it was finally deserted.
“I’ll need to make a call to insurance.” It should be covered. With a house that old, they’d taken care to take insurance out on it, specifically for fires. Meg had always had a feeling something might happen. Sure, they hadn’t known what; she simply hadn’t seemed to trust the house.
Time came and went in the Winchester household. Slowly, they became a family; a well oiled machine. They woke up together and went to sleep together, either of them curled up on the other’s chest. One of them would go and cuddle with Claire, while the other took care of breakfast. But not before they should share lazy kisses in bed. Dean’s lips were very much Cas’ favorite in the entire universe.
“Look who the cat dragged in,” she said with a small smile when she stepped back from Dean. “Is that my little Cas?”
“I love you too,” Dean called from upstairs, before going to his bedroom and closing the door. Cas’s heart skipped a few beats at just those words.
It dawned on Cas that it had been years since he’d seen him like this. When they were younger, they’d had plenty of sleepovers, where mom Winchester would make them pancakes in the morning if it was the weekend, or they would rush out of the house to go school. Even as a kid, Dean’s hair had been tousled just like this with one side of his hair flat as a board and the other standing up in the oddest angles when he got out of bed in the morning.
They started talking about small things as they walked to the shop - how Dean was liking the community so far and where he’d been. Dean on his turn wanted to know if there were any things that Cas would recommend seeing or visiting.
They’d settled on focusing on doing it for Mary for now. When Claire was older, she could decide for herself. Even if Meg didn’t want to be part of her upbringing, Claire had a right to ask questions. To seek her out when she was older.
Anna had a similar story. She’d been seventeen when she figured out that the fires that randomly started on the school grounds had been her doing. It hadn’t been her who noticed, but him. He’d pointed out to her that every time she had a particularly bad class with a teacher she hated, a bush would catch on fire, or a desk.
His thoughts were disrupted when the door finally opened at eleven am. He had been so tense he almost dropped Claire’s teddy bear from his hand. He’d been mindlessly playing with it, glad for it to be something that could keep him busy.
“It somehow feels even worse the second time around.” It had taken Cas a while to open the papers when he had first gotten them, together with her wedding ring. For days they’d lingered on the kitchen counter while Cas tried to get his life in order. He’d felt lost without Meg, as if part of him was missing. He had to build an entire new routine without her in his life. And it had sucked. Now he had the routine, as shattered as it was right now, and it sucked to have to give it up again, possibly.
He called Gabriel on his way back inside. It was that that he hadn’t wanted to do. Even though he and his brother didn’t necessarily had a bad relationship, they still hadn’t talked in months. He didn’t want the only times that they called to be because one of them needed something. The last time they talked, he’d helped his brother move to his new house. As much as the move was tense and different, it had felt nice to connect with someone. That was the last time he’d seen anyone in their family. Still, he expected the call to go to voicemail.
Castiel was twenty-five, stuck in a bookshop on an island that made him feel like a fool. He’d done online school, gotten a diploma, he could move on with his life. He could get the hell out of dodge and get the ferry off the island.
okay. She actually made it sound as if just he was supposed to be okay. Didn’t ask about her daughter. “I’m fine. Claire had to be in hospital for a night but she’s fine. It’s not why I called, though.”
“I mean. The house is in ruins and I have no clue how I’m going to pay for a motel for more than a few weeks.” It came out harsher and more bitter than he’d intended to. Dean had done nothing wrong, he shouldn’t take it out on him. In fact, he’d been the saviour for him in more than one way. “Not great, but we’re trying and figuring something out.” He was attempting to, at least.
The only thing he hated about the bag was how everything seemed to get swallowed. Cas had to look for his car keys for five minutes, before he realised that they somehow had gotten between his copy of Rebecca and scrunched up the pages. He had picked it up for himself that day and seeing it already beaten up hurt him just a little bit.
He thought she’d finally dropped it, until a package had arrived at his door that morning with more herbs and general supplies. With it was an old worn notebook and a note from his mother, saying maybe his great grandmother’s recipes could help him.
The clean up was the worst part of having the reading hour. There was always too much clutter and candy wrappers on the floor and what felt like a thousand pillows scattered all around the reading nook.
She had packed up her bags late one night when he was working overtime, brought Claire over to the office with the excuse that she needed to run an errand and couldn’t take her with her, and left. He’d never been so angry. So hurt. Cas couldn’t describe what he had felt those first days.
“Oh, look, she’s in an ocean!” Castiel said, focusing his attention back on reading and the story. “She’s a pirate.”
If anything, it had been nice to catch up with Sam and his family. They’d never been the best of friends, but they’d spent enough evenings together. His little girl had crawled up and looked over at Claire from the safety of her mom’s arms and yelled
“So am I,” Dean admitted. “I’m surprised you remember, it’s been a long time.” It had been a long time. For some reason, it had always stuck with Cas, hearing about how they had had a house fire and lost their father. How John had rushed in because Dean himself was still inside the house. Mary had been outside, clutching Sam to her chest. How he had given Dean to a colleague, attempting to rescue something from the house. How it had collapsed before he could get out. Cas remembered how it had inspired Dean to become a firefighter, to make his father proud. Because he hadn’t been able to do anything last time. Because he did want to be able to help.
Cas now had a completely different theory on why she hadn’t wanted to go. He thought that she had known she didn’t want to be a mom all along, that she didn’t want Claire to be born.
“Never looked at it that way, you know? When you’re in love you don’t see things the way they are.” He knew that it could sound crazy, that he truly loved her as much as he did. But he did. “I’m only starting to see it now.”
Mary threw them the biggest smile. “Why thank you.” She held the flowers out so Claire could reach them too. She gladly pointed at them and kept saying ‘pretty!’ over and over and over again until it made all of them laugh.
The sand was still wet from the heavy downpour of that afternoon, but Cas didn’t mind. He focused his thoughts on the ebb and flow of the ocean. It always managed to calm him down, so long as he was alone.
Eventually, Dean and Cas took Claire for a stroll around the neighborhood once she was up and wanted to be active. It was nice for a change, a nice breather after the conversation from before.
Claire was back at the house with Dean and Cas kept telling himself that is was fine. Even though his heart had been heavy when leaving, he trusted Dean. It was only for an hour or two, they’d be back together soon.
His smokey clothes were better than a hospital gown with his ass on show, even if that would at least be clean.
That shit was reserved for movies, he realised now. Things didn’t magically feel okay. Yes, they felt awkward. Just sitting at the table together, Dean’s cat asleep on the window sill, made the air feel thick with tension. He could almost cut it.
It took him a moment to recognize Dean Winchester, standing behind him. He hadn’t seen him in years, and even though he hadn’t changed a lot, Cas hadn’t expected him there. Of all the moments, he wondered why now. Why show up now, when things were going to crap for him.
His father wasn’t in the picture anymore, but the stories he heard from his mother were enough. Even though she never talked about the day it happened, she did tell them about the past. He was
“I don’t know. If anything, it’s not the most important thing.” He had to get the insurance taken care of, he had to figure out how he could continue to work and look after Claire, figure out where they would stay in the long run. Yes, Dean was letting them stay for now, but he couldn’t continue to do that until the house was rebuilt, or until he somehow got the credit to rent out a new place.
Cas did remember Jess. She’d been in Sam’s year in school and while they didn’t see a lot of each other, they’d talked a little. “So they actually got together?”
“We’re currently in a divorce-” Cas didn’t want to talk to her, didn’t even know if she’d reply to his calls. His heart felt heavy at the thought he’d have to see her again, in real life; at the thought that she could be terrible about it and want some of the money. That she could state it in the paperwork. Maybe she would be terrible and suddenly demand that she wanted Claire away from him and only in her life. “It will be difficult to get in touch with her.”
“Will depend on this one,” Dean answered before walking to one of the strollers in the back of the shop, “But we’d love to. You do have a great voice. The kid loved you.”
“Good night, Dean.” He was walking towards the stairs, but seemed to hesitate on the first step. It felt weird, somehow, saying good night like this. “Dean?”
“Is there a mr or miss Winchester?” he asked, curious. Cas knew the answer in a way, knew that he’d never seen anyone with him, but he still had to ask. He still had to check. “Because if there are, I haven’t seen a lot of them in the time we’ve been here.”
Charlie had already started by the time he came back out. She was rearranging the books that belonged in the kids corner, plucking them up from the floor and back on the shelf. Castiel burst out in laughter when he saw her - crouched like a princess in her pillow and teddy bear kingdom.
“I don’t know.” Cas took a sip of his beer before answering. “They want Meg’s signature on the paperwork as well.”
He felt like an idiot, knocking on the door to a house he now was calling his home, even if it was only temporary. He should be able to unlock the door, just go in. Cas felt too awkward asking for the key, though. As if he was asking for something he wasn’t supposed to have.
It was silent for a long while after that. Dean finished his beer while Cas stared at the paperwork and eventually slipped a finger under the seal. He was brave. He would do it. He
Dean’s place was a home to them too. It was the place that he remembered kissing him in for the very first time. Where they slept together for the fist time. Bathed Claire for the very first time together.
Cas didn’t want to see her sweet smile, the way her lips curled up when she really meant it, the way she was when she was in a really good mood. He didn’t want to see the slight wave in her hair when she forgot to blow dry it. The way her shirts now clung gently on her belly, where it hadn’t quite gone back from the pregnancy. What if it would bring back the love? What if he wanted her in his life again?
“It’s my own fault, really. He dropped his teddy bear somewhere and I have no idea where. I thought maybe the walking would put him to sleep, because I know that it used to but it seems that it no longer works.” The rocking motions only seemed to make him more and more upset. Cas’s first instinct was to reach in and comfort the boy, but knew that it wouldn’t be the way to go. It wasn’t his place, not right now.
Two hours later, Claire was asleep again, they were having lunch and Cas had new clothes. Dean’s clothes felt awkward on him: they hugged where his didn’t, and were baggy in different places. Things between them still felt awkward, too. He somehow hadn’t expected them to.
Part of him wanted to light a cigarette and relax for a couple of minutes. But the thought of having a flame so close to his skin made his skin crawl. He lit it anyway, but put it out seconds after. It was too soon. He couldn’t.
He watched Dean walk up the stairs to his bedroom and heard the click of his door. It made something in his chest drop.
Cas fell silent for a little bit. He didn’t quite know what to say to that. Inside, he knew Dean was right. He had to do it and get it over with so he could move on. On the other hand, as long as it didn’t, he was okay. Things were okay.
“Nice to meet you,” Cas said with a soft smile. “Castiel, but please call me Cas. Will I be seeing you again next week?” It was forward of him, but he always enjoyed seeing new faces. Especially if they were cute, like Dean’s.
“We’d been together for a year, just moved to the house. We always joked she got pregnant the day we moved into the house.” Cas didn’t quite know when the pregnancy had really changed things. “It wasn’t nice, you know? Because at first she was very hormonal and emotional and we fought a lot.” He remembered the fight over leaving the jam on the counter by accident and how she hadn’t spoken to him for four days. “I even slept on the couch a couple of nights. Still don’t know what I did wrong there.”
Dean had coffee waiting from him when he came home from work, breakfast if he wanted it. Sometimes, he would get a nice and home-cooked meal without having to go to his mom’s.
The little grey dog stayed on the counter for the rest of the day, keeping them company. The shop had a quiet day after the reading hour - a couple more people came in and some purchases were made, but all in all it was calm. Castiel couldn’t say that he minded. It had allowed him to leave Charlie in charge for a little while as he went to buy a new phone.
“Of course.” Finally happy with the way the books were organised, she plucked through the pillows to find any abandoned teddy bears, pacifiers or drink cups to put on the counter so parents could pick them up over the next week.
And okay, maybe he liked looking at Dean sleeping against his shoulder. And maybe he loved it even more when he eventually settled in his lap. Cas allowed himself to play with his hair while he slept, pretending to watch the movie.
“How did you sleep?” Dean asked after taking a sip of the too hot coffee. The steam was still coming off of the cup and Cas wondered
guilty for getting it for her for her birthday, with how much she loved destroying things with it -- and they knew they were the last to arrive. That was even though they were the ones that lived in walking distance.
Cas woke up in the darkness of Dean’s guest room, the clock blinking 04:26 pm back at him. He didn’t know what woke him up, everything was silent. Almost too silent. The ticking of the clock was the only sound he could hear. Not his daughter’s calming breathing, or the sound of cars racing by.
It had been a comfort in the least, to have that again, be there again, even if it was only for a little bit. He had never thought that work would become comforting to him. Yet, somehow, it had turned out to be a comfort, the one thing that had seemed to stay the same.
It had felt nice, being able to help Dean. It felt good that, even though he hadn’t thought about it, he’d made a good decision. If he hadn’t walked up to Dean, maybe he’d never have found the teddy bear or only after a week of long nights full of crying.
“Of course.” His brother seemed to want to answer, to say something, ask, but decided against it. Cas was glad for it. Talking about Meg was the last thing he wanted to do. Gabriel left some stuff with him, knowing he’d need them. “Call me?”
“She got angry when I forced her to go.” He still had a piece of glass in his hand from cleaning up the glass she had thrown at him once they were home from the hospital three days later. They’d put her on IVs to calm things down and when they’d been happy that she was stable, they’d sent them back home. “It’s the reason we have Claire now.”
She’d have to open the shop by herself the day after and stay until closing so it wasn’t like she didn’t deserve to leave a little earlier than usual. They’d had the same arrangement from day one. Most days, they were both at the shop, doing the random tasks that needed to be done but no one seemed to have time for otherwise. It meant the shop was clean and orderly and that people always remarked on how nice it was when they came in.
Waking up in a strange bed felt odd to Cas. For a moment, he thought he was at home. Nothing had happened and he had just had a bad dream. In his drowsy, sleep-drunk state, he reached for Meg. Somehow, even after weeks, he’d expected her to be asleep next to him.
She had to be hungry. He’d fed her at the hospital, but her schedule had been thrown off so much by the fire and all the commotion. Usually, she’d be up at nine, ready to get a new diaper and some milk to satisfy her hungry belly.
Castiel grabbed the teddy off the counter and held it out to Ben, who was now looking with interest at what he was being handed. When Dean took over from Cas and held it close to his nose so he could smell it, the boy’s expression changed. For the first time since they’d run into each other, the boy stopped even his small whimpers. He just reached out his arms and gladly took the teddy.
His mother hadn’t been shocked or angry. She hadn’t given Gabe a lesson about how he shouldn’t have done it and how it was dangerous. How he could have emptied a steaming cup of tea in his brother’s lap and burned him.
In the emergency room, they’d put her through enough examinations. Her lungs had sounded clear and her heart had sounded good. Her oxygen stats had seemed to be stable and good even then. It had meant the monitoring wouldn’t be
“I didn’t feel like talking to my ex-husband.” She was getting annoyed with him, it was easy to hear in her voice. After being together for as long as they had, he could tell the subtle shifts in her voice. “Sorry, I guess.” He wondered if her new girlfriend knew it yet, the changes in her tone. If she had reason to know them yet.
But what if he didn’t? What if he needed Cas to ask for him to talk about things? What if Cas needed the same?
Dean’s cheeks actually flushed. “Of course. I meant to, but then I forgot.” He got up and came back with a set of keys on a
It did mean that Mondays were extra exhausting for him. He didn’t know what exactly it was that was the final drop that made the bucket spill - if it was the cleaning or the reading hour or the small easy tasks that seemed to be coming and coming and coming.
It hadn’t always been easy. Cas remembered vividly the day that they paid a final visit to the piece of land the house had sat on. They’d toyed with it, with rebuilding the house, with moving there, all three of them. They could make a home all for themselves, specific for what they needed.
“What about Charlie, are you guys still friends?” Charlie had been one of the only people he’d kept in contact with, mostly because she had kept messaging him and bugging him. He’d enjoyed that she did regardless.
“Listen, I am not calling you to get yelled at.” He didn’t have the energy to fight with her. Not with Claire starting to stir in her bassinette. “I just need you to get the paperwork my way and come sign the papers. Why didn’t you call me back?”
The diner was calm. Dean and Cas were so far the only people in, with Claire happily sat in Dean’s lap. The folder lay on the table, together with the papers from the insurance company. Cas had seven pens in his pocket, had made sure that they all wrote.
Suddenly, it made sense to Cas. After hearing the crying earlier and seeing Dean walk to the house, something clicked. It had been Ben that woken him up the previous night with his cries.
They’d gotten to the diner early. Meg had said around nine and they’d arrived at eight thirty. Just in case she would arrive early. Just in case they might otherwise miss her. The bad news was that Cas had already had two cups of coffee before Dean had told him to lay off and ordered him a tea.
They left late in the afternoon, with happy bellies and happy hearts. Cas had forgotten how easy Mary was to be around, how much love she had for everyone that came into her house. She’d promptly decided to make dinner for everyone.
Some days, they stayed up until nine and talked about what happened that night. Especially if Dean had had a rough fire. Cas remembered when someone in his team had gotten trapped under a beam that had fallen down. He’d broken his leg, but gotten lucky with that being his only injury.
Before going in for the night, Cas stood and watched as Dean walked up the road across from him and disappeared into the trees. Not long after, the porch lights turned on and he could see the faint shadow of a guy carrying a stroller up the steps. It had to be Dean who was renting the cabin, who would be his neighbor for the next two weeks.
For a moment, he said nothing. Dean just sat down on the couch next to him and leaned into him. Cas moved his arm so he could lean in closer. When Dean didn’t speak, Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair slowly. It smelled like Peppermint. It had been a shampoo Sam had gotten for him for his birthday and Dean was still using it, as much as he hated the smell. Personally, Cas loved it.
“Hey,” Cas mumbled, looking up from where he was perched on the floor. He was too shaken with the sudden realisation, he didn’t quite know what to say. “I’m -” His face still looked dirty in a way, even if Cas was sure he’d taken a shower before leaving the station.
Maybe he’d left the phone accidentally and they’d gone out for breakfast and he couldn’t reach him. That would make sense, right?
“They also had a baby girl. She was out with her sisters when we got there.” He paused, as if he was unsure of what he should say now. If he should say it. Cas squeezed his shoulder gently, an unspoken ‘
Castiel decided to start in the far corner, where the strollers were stored. One way or another, there were always pillows that landed there. Even though they tried to monitor and keep everything in the designated area, he knew that with kids, it was almost impossible to keep things the way they were.
“Yeah, sorry. I’m. Nightmare.” His heart was still beating in his chest. He felt like he’d ran a marathon in his sleep. “I’m okay.”
Charlie - the tech nerd that she was - asked to see it when he arrived back and insisted on helping him set it up. He was capable of doing it, but he also knew his best friend. It was like giving a dog a new toy.
“Do you know if this is one of ours? I keep losing track.” The in and out flow of the teddy bears in their possession was constant. “I don’t think that I’ve seen it before, but. It was here with the strollers.”
He’d gone out two days ago to the office, to get things sorted, pick up some paperwork. They allowed him to work from home for now, understanding that he had a lot to deal with. Some arrangements had to be made to make it possible. He’d been set up with a replacement laptop, since his had gone down with the house. They ordered a brand new one for him, but for now, the replacement had to do.
“Living together was great. We would get up late and stay in bed and watch tv series or get take out. It was amazing, to be honest.”
Castiel sat cross legged on the ground, one of the bigger story books opened up on his lap. The kids were spread around him, some equally cross legged on the floor, others in their parents’ laps. Some of the kids had their favorite teddy bears that they picked from the bin by the entrance, snuggled close to them, ready to get into the story.
Cas had wanted to see what he’d lost. He knew there was plenty that he didn’t save online. There were baby pictures of his daughter that he’d never see again, pictures of the wedding that had gone up in flames. Family pictures from Cas himself when he was younger.
“It can sometimes do that to kids,” Cas admitted, “and I won’t take it personally - that I promise you. Are you staying for long?”
He had thought he would scream. Instead he just stared at the little white hand holding her teddy bear, the pacifier half out of her mouth. She was covered in soot. Lips blue, skin pale, eyes staring.
His clothes still smelled like it, but there was nothing else he could wear. They’d shown him to the showers, so that he could feel a bit cleaner at least. Having to put his dirty clothes on didn’t help it much tough. The hospital had given him a onesie for Claire, but they didn’t have anything except the hospital gowns for him. He’d have to get through until he could get something.
They were drawing it out. Castiel’s hands didn’t move away from the paperwork. Not as the pancakes arrived and Meg and the girl ate. Anna and Dean filled the silence with pleasantries. Cas updated Meg on how Claire was doing.
Cas didn’t. Not really. The images were still too vivid in his brain. He couldn’t deal with talking about it just yet. Not with Dean, not barely hours after they had met again.
“Good morning,” Cas said, gentle smile on his face. He tried to hide that his heart was racing in his chest. He could feel his heart beating in his temples. His thoughts was running 120 miles an hour. “Or should I say good afternoon? Do you want lunch?”
“I’m glad,” Cas admitted, before falling onto the couch. He was tired all of a sudden. The kind of tired that he didn’t quite know how to explain. Once upon a time, the word bouncer had meant something very different to them. Instead of being a thing for babies, they’d guarded clubs when they went out. Somehow, it felt like that had been years ago now.
“I don’t know.” She had texted him that she would be in town two days from now, to sign the paperwork he needed. They’d only exchanged a few words: telling him that she didn’t want anything to do with the house or the money, that she didn’t care what would happen to it. She didn’t want to have anything to do with Claire, she didn’t want to have anything to do with him.
“Is this better? Or do you want a bottle too? Is it the time for both, huh?” It was her time for both. Usually, Claire wasn’t too bothered by wet diapers and she would wait until her next feed to get them changed. Cas couldn’t blame Dean for that being his first instinct.
Dean was just sleepy, had confused him with someone else but didn’t want to act on it further. Maybe he just hadn’t wanted to make things awkward between them. Because Cas knew that would make things weird. They had
Even as a kid, Cas had been mesmerised by it. Then, when things changed between them, he’d thought it was cute. Right now, with Dean clutching the cup in his hands, he couldn’t help but think it was still cute. Especially in this house. Somehow, the cluttered atmosphere fit Dean. It was a mix of Mary’s nick-nacks everywhere and a cleaner, more indie feel. As much as Cas hadn’t expected it from Dean, he liked it.
Dean sat up sleepily when Claire eventually stirred and whined. It was clear that he really wasn’t awake and if anything, Cas loved it. He wished he could stay in this moment forever. That Dean could be sleepy and cute and Claire small and that he didn’t have to make the scary jump into the unknown.
Just the way they were and as if they’d always been part of it. As if they belonged there. Even though Claire was not related to them at all. It warmed Cas’ heart more than he’d like to admit.
“It happens.” He didn’t know if the coolness remained in his voice, or if he was just dreaming it. “She left her daughter and her husband. The paperwork is almost done now, I just need to drop it off at the post office-”
He was clicking through them while Dean was in the shower. Dean had a couple days off of work and they’d decided to enjoy it as much as they could. Claire was asleep upstairs and they would put on a movie and get a few beers and get to relax. No work, phones were turned off except for Dean’s emergency phone.
Dean’s lips were soft and still tasted like the coffee that he had drank probably hours before. His hand was hot against his skin, just a little rough.
“Yeah.” He shouldn’t be sad about some of them. Memories like Meg seven months pregnant lounging by a pool shouldn’t be considered good memories. “I lost essentially everything that wasn’t online. And even then, I still lost a lot of those.”
Cas’s heart felt heavy, thinking about Meg so much again. He hadn’t ever looked back and seen it in the new light. Seen the bad nights and the manipulation for what they were. He wasn’t ready to recognise it in any case. It wasn’t the time. It was too much.
“Don’t have to mail it tonight,” Dean said, “but good for you, man. Well done.” He had a small smile on his face and Castiel loved seeing it there.
He stood there, ready to let himself fall. He felt gravity pulling at his body, pulling it down, down, down. He had to, he had to keep them safe, he had to.
Cas felt safe with Dean. Trusted Dean with his life. It had been a while since he felt this comfortable in a house. After Meg had left, the house felt strange and foreign, like a language he didn’t know, that he couldn’t learn. The one who made it home had left.
They’d had long conversations, while Claire scooted around and bothered Trix. Or while Claire napped during lunch hour. It was no secret that the space meant a lot to Cas. It had been the place where he had brought Claire home. The place where he’d, for the very first time, tried to build a home for himself.
“Hey, come on in,” Mary grinned, kissing them each on the cheek and pulling Claire in for a tight squeeze. From the living room, they could hear Ruby’s play guitar hitting the couch -- Cas and Dean now felt
had barely started when Dean fell asleep on Cas’s shoulder and if anything, Cas didn’t have the heart to wake him up.
He couldn’t wait for the messages from his mother, ranging from blaming to apologising and telling him she was just worried for him and wanted him to be okay. He knew they’d rain in once he’d get a replacement.
“Thank you,” she said and for the first time in a long time, she sounded sincere. “We’ll be able to move on. Don’t take any offence, but I can’t wait to not have to spend my days knowing I’m still your wife.”
He didn’t want anything to go wrong. The only thing that could happen would be that she could not show up or refuse to sign. He’d mentally prepared himself for her to bring her girlfriend, he’d mentally prepared for her being a bitch. He’d done his best to be as prepared as possible.
“It’s nice out, go and enjoy yourself,” he told her before giving her a gentle push. “You’ll be here long enough tomorrow as is. Go. You deserve it.”
After four days of being in Dean’s house, it almost felt as if they’d never been apart. The first time Cas had been alone felt awkward, like being in a stranger’s house.
“Meg.” God, he sounded bitter. More bitter than he’d thought he would be. “Did she tell you?” He bit back the urge to ask who the girl was. Why she was with someone else so quickly after. If she’d been there all along, if that had been why she left.
After being friends for so long, it almost seemed natural, to bounce back. To talk for hours and catch each other up. To instantly be friends again.
It was silent on the other end of the line. “You hadn’t signed the paperwork yet?” Cas was aware of the fact that it had been a couple of weeks. “Of course you hadn’t.”
“Hey, Char?” Cas asked as he saw a teddy bear in the far corner of the room. He crouched curiously, picking both it and the green pacifier next to it up from the floor. It was a grey dog, surprisingly soft for its’ chewed up exterior. He carefully maneuvered around the wet, mangled ears as he looked for a name tag or any kind of identification on it.
He hated the thought of it. Soon, Meg wouldn’t be his wife anymore. The paperwork would be processed and he would be out for the count. He forced himself to say the words. “Before you ask, it didn’t last. We all wanted different things. Meg and I didn’t - I thought we worked, but she let me know that we didn’t.”
“Watch it.” Dean was grinning now, though. If Dean hadn’t been holding Claire, Cas was sure that he would have gotten smacked in the head. “What about you?”
In a way, he’d seen a lot of the kids grow up and develop. Some started walking, some babbled now, others visibly understood more of the stories. Others asked questions where they’d been silent before.
“I know it’s not ideal,” Dean started. “But Sam had a kid almost a year ago. The little one stays with me from time to time, so I have some baby stuff in the house. A lot of it doesn’t fit Ruby anymore, so I figure they might work for Claire. It should be enough for you two to stay without completely breaking the bank. If it’d help you out, you’re welcome, man.”
“Did you hear what she said? She’s not in the box at all?” he read, shifting his focus from the latecomer to one of the older girls. “Where do you think she could be?”
“I couldn’t help but continuously see Claire in her arms. You know. I kept thinking she might have died too.”
The house had been a home to Cas. To Cas, it had meant a warm and comfy place, where he could relax on the couch with his wife. Where he could have a glass of wine with her and watch a movie, or sit outside and talk. Where he felt like he could be whoever he wanted to be.
On the phone, he’d said that there was no way that they could stay at his place, it was too cluttered and there was no room. It wasn’t an environment for a baby to be in, even if he’d had a baby in the house not even a year earlier. Cas had his ideas about why he refused, and respected them. It couldn’t have been easy on his brother. He did promise to help them out, to drive them around, maybe help financially a little bit. It still wouldn’t be enough for them to stay in a motel, but it would be something.
He needed to be alone sometimes - to just sit and think and connect. With his feet buried in the sand, he felt more at home than at his parents’ house, at his siblings’. There was no searching and questioning looks thrown his way here. No sly remarks made to him.
Cas supposed that the worry was normal in living with a firefighter. He was acutely aware of the fact that Dean would leave the house at six am to get to the fire station and that he wouldn’t come back until eight am the next day. That there might be a day he wouldn’t come back.
He stuck his head out, looking over the darkness of the streets. At first glance, there was no one to be seen. The lampposts were dimmed during the night, the light barely enough to see anything except for the half meter lit up around the poles.
“Meg,” he said, his voice more bitter than he meant for it to be. “It’s been a long time.” It had been months.
Her face had fallen a little, and the crows feet had gotten more pronounced. The smile on her lips was still the same, though, and the way her eyes lit up when she was around her son. Her hair was still cut the same way, and even though her clothes fit differently and were different, it was still her.
Gabriel showed up half an hour later, after a quick text to ask which room they were in. He told Cas he’d been on his way to work, but drove back for some stuff and called his boss that he’d be late today.
Dean grinned and shook his head before walking up the stairs. With every step, Cas’s heart sunk a little deeper in his chest. He shouldn’t have been so dumb. He had stepped out of line. Of course it wasn’t okay.
“Just tell her her house burned down.” Hearing the other woman had made something in him click. Made something grow cold inside him. He barely got to listen as the woman told Meg, but heard her taking over the phone.
“She can’t.” Claire stirred from her nap, but didn’t wake up. The movement was enough to take Dean’s attention away from him for a moment, something Cas was thankful of. “I called her this morning. I don’t think I have anyone. The motel is the only option.” But a single dad doesn’t make enough to be in a motel for weeks until he finds something to rent.
“Are you okay?” Dean sounded worried, half out of breath as if he’d run up the stairs to come see if something was going on.
He could hear Ben wail over his music. He felt sorry for the guy - he truly did. Cas had dealt with a lot of kids in his lifetime. Somehow, over the years, he’d become the designated babysitter. Maybe it was because he didn’t seem to be presenting his magic, maybe it was because he was always helping out.
It still lay in his lap now, the folder still shut. Cas hadn’t gotten himself to open it up. Somehow, it felt worse the second time around. Felt worse even though he knew that there was no ring inside of it, even though he knew that he’d seen all the words in the documents before.
It was when Cas was downstairs, feeding Claire that Dean walked down the steps. Cas barely heard him come down, got spooked when he was suddenly behind him making coffee with a very sleepy expression on his face.
Gabe didn’t talk about him a lot. After it happened, it became an unspoken rule not to bring it up. Cas remembered too clearly the way it had affected his brother in the months afterwards. How much it had hurt Gabe when they announced that Meg was pregnant.
He could see the soft look in the way Meg looked at her girlfriend though, in the way that she reached out for her.
The realisation dawned on him suddenly, seeing Dean’s tired face and the soot in his hair. Last night, Cas had been too into finally being able to hold his daughter and the pure anxiety that came with her being trapped inside. For all he’d known, the president could’ve walked up to him and handed her over and he wouldn’t have noticed.
“I’m going to go sleep,” Dean mumbled, before making his way upstairs. Cas was still too preoccupied with just how good Dean’s lips had felt against his. Just how right they had been. He’d longed for his hands on his waist and his fingers in his hair, longed for the kiss to be longer. Wanted to kiss him again and again until their lips started tingling.
Castiel got distracted before he could even properly start the car, the radio softly playing in the background. There were two all too familiar figures walking past him, or at least, one of them. He recognised the new father from the store - Dean. The one with the gorgeous smile and the sleeping kid.
Claire was finally fast asleep in his arms. Just the thought of having her sleep in the cot had made his heart skip a beat. Cas was almost afraid that she’d get away from him; that it would mean not keeping an eye on her properly. She seemed to sense it too, kept crying when she was in her bed by herself. Only when he held her would she settle and fall asleep.
His heart skipped a beat when he reached it; he was almost afraid to look down. There was an anxiety there that he hadn’t anticipated.
“Meg was the one girl who saw me when we were still in class.” He remembered the smile on her face when they randomly met at a club one of the few times Charlie had managed to drag him with. How she’d smiled and walked up to him and asked him who he was. If he maybe didn’t want to buy her a drink. “We fell in love fast, you know. Saw each other a lot, went out on dates a lot. She’d call out of nowhere and say she needed to see me because she missed me. In the end I slept over at hers most of the time.”
With Dean, it just felt right. They fit, like two pieces of a quirky puzzle that never quite seemed to fit before.
“It’s okay right now. I hate that I have no clothes, but that’s all.” He’d pushed back any feelings about the fire to the back of his mind. Cas didn’t want to think about anything but the fact that he was holding his daughter and that she was okay. His mind was still looking for Meg, but that too he had pushed to the side. It didn’t deserve to be there. Not right now.
It was with fear in his heart that made him get out of bed and take a few steps to the crib. It struck him as odd, that it was there now. He couldn’t remember moving it before going to sleep. He’d liked that it was next to the bed, how he could keep an eye on her.
He grasped at empty sheets, his hand falling off the edge of the single bed. It all came raining down on him like a thunderstorm breaking through: the fire, the memories of her leaving, everything.
It was just after one pm when his usual reading hour group started to trickle in. Monday had been a slow day so far and Cas was happy for the extra work. He loved his reading hour, where he could sit down and read to the kids, watching their fascination-struck faces.
“I’m sorry about the house,” she said. “I know you loved the place.” He had loved it. He really had. He had fallen in love with it when they had first gone to see it. He was the one who had pushed Meg to consider it. “I’m glad you’re okay.”
“This is Sadie,” he read, book out for the kids to see. “No, no. That’s just a box isn’t it. Where do you think Sadie could be?” The picture on the page was only of a box, just whisps of hair sticking out of the top. “Sadie is hiding
“That doesn’t sound okay, man,” Dean said. Claire was somehow still asleep on his chest, her hand clasped around the hem of his shirt. It made Cas’s heart melt and a grin form on his face.
“The beach is beautiful,” Cas answered as he punched in the code to the alarm. Dean was respectfully turned away from him, Ben now safe in his arms. This at least seemed to calm him down to some extent. “I don’t know if you’ve been, but that’s what I’d recommend. It’s one of my favorite places on this whole island.”
Castiel was happy to lock the bookstore door behind him. After checking one last time that he had indeed turned on the alarm system, he threw the keys in his tote bag. He’d been self conscious about carrying it around at first. People would stare at him and even his mother had asked him why he was carrying the thing around. It didn’t matter to him: it was a practical way to get all of his stuff from point a to point b without having to carry around a full backpack.
“It seems to have put him right to sleep,” Cas commented as he walked past them, a small smile on his lips.
Instead, Naomi Novak had grinned, put a spoon in front of him and asked his brother to make it float to her hands.
In their last year, seven desks had crumbled to ashes, thankfully without any students devoured by the flames. Their mother - who had worried about her daughter not having any skill at all - had been ecstatic, made her promise not to do it on purpose again and helped her find ways to take control over it.
“Hey, Meg. Something has happened. Can you call me back? It’s important.” He didn’t care for a second that he didn’t go into more detail, that he could worry her.
When Dean had been out sick, they’d call and ask him how he was. Cas only had Dean who would do that for him.
“Good morning, Cas,” Dean mumbled, before leaning in and pressing a kiss to the top of Claire’s head, who was now happily playing with a toy in Dean’s lap. For a second, he seemed to hesitate, before tilting Cas’s head up, one hand soft against his cheek, and kissing him.
Cas had moved away again during their final year of high school, because his parents job took them all over. Somehow, they hadn’t kept in touch, Cas didn’t know why.
He wouldn’t blame her if she had. If she’d wanted to put everything behind and start a new life. She’d made it seem with the way she left that they were just a blip in her existence. Something to just take out like trash. He couldn’t keep himself from glossing over that part, almost ignoring that she had. Yes, he hated it, but at the same time, he loved her. He probably still loved her.
He ate in silence and watched as Dean walked down the road with Ben. It was dead quiet, only the distant sounds of birds were audible. So it had worked and the boy had fallen asleep.
“Years.” There were two cars out front. Cas wasn’t sure if the Winchesters had for some reason invested in another car, or if Mary Winchester had visitors. Part of him hoped that she wouldn’t have company. It would feel awkward as is, not having seen her in such a long time. Being around strangers would make it worse. Still, it would be nice to spend some time together with Mary. Regardless of others being there.
She had been one of the constants during their childhoods: eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in the sun on a hot summer’s day, movie evenings with Sam, Dean and their mother, staying up too late on sleepovers.
Even though it was summer and the occasional tourist would drop in to the bookshop, they rarely came in to listen to the stories. Many came for a romantic get away, only bringing the kid if they really had to. Yet, here he seemed to be, by himself.
Cas hated the thought that he should probably leave the room so he could call around. He had to see if there was someone who could give them a place to stay for the next couple of days. Weeks, maybe - long enough for them to be able to figure out how to move on from here. He didn’t know what to do about it, either, what options there were for them.
“Come here, baby,” he mumbled before picking her up out of the crib. She was doing her pouty mouth, tears ready to spill onto her cheeks, her face red. “I’m sorry, Claire.” He glanced over to the clock before pressing her close to him. It was almost ten am.
“That I’ll just fall in love with her again,” he admitted. Even to him it sounded crazy. He knew that it wouldn’t be that way. Part of him knew that now, having mulled it over in his head again and again and again. “Though, I don’t know.”
“Isn’t it, though?” he asked. “You don’t want to see her again, she never called about her daughter. You didn’t call her for days after the fire.” He took Cas in, looked from his face to the still closed envelope in his lap and back to him. “You don’t want to open up the paperwork and get it done.”
They talked about Meg for an hour, while watching a lame tv movie in the background. Castiel talked about the things he hadn’t mentioned before, the ways she would lash out. The shard of glass in his fingers. The way that she left for a month when she was five months pregnant because they weren’t doing okay.
“There was a pretty bad fire,” he said, slowly. “A wooden house, a family lived there - grandmother, two parents and three kids. They didn’t have much, but because of the state of the house it lit up quickly.” Cas could hear the strain in his voice.
His escape to the beach tonight was because of his mother. She’d tried again - even though he had told her that it wouldn’t work - to see if he had a knack for potions. She’d started trying when he’d turned twenty-one; trying to get him to study various herbs and formulas.
“My pleasure.” Dean had a compassionate smile on his lips. He looked tired, but then again, he must have been working the entire night. “I’m sorry, I know it’s not easy. Can you go to your parents? Family?”
Cas called her after Dean had left for work the next day. Just hearing the ring of the phone made his stomach turn uncomfortably. Would her voice still be the same as it was? Or would it somehow have changed? Would the tone somehow be different?
She left the shop a little while after she’d finished with his phone, waiting by the door to ask him and make sure that he really didn’t need her to stay.
It was where they’d brought Claire home for the very first time and where they’d spent their wedding night. It was where he was supposed to teach Claire how to walk and talk and where he and Meg were supposed to grow old. They were supposed to dance around, all three of them, laughing and goofing out.
“I was awake,” Dean shrugged, rubbing one thumb along her back. “I might as well. Besides, she likes me.”
Just thinking about it made Cas’s heart clench. He didn’t know what he was doing, didn’t know what kind of things to take into account. Didn’t know where to go with what information.
“I advise that you get her to sign the paperwork.” The clerk shook his head compassionately. “I get that it is difficult, but it’s the easiest way.”
It was with shakey hands that Castiel found his way to the signatures and slowly put down one on each line. He worked his way through the entire stack and put it back in the envelope as quickly as he possibly could.
If anything, if Dean didn’t love it so much, Cas wished that he would do something else. If he didn’t know that he poured his heart and soul into it. But if Dean loved it, he supported him.
Cas pretended to be asleep as Dean came downstairs with her and fed her. Only when he accidentally dropped the remote from the side of the couch did Cas open his eyes.
Today had been a calmer day when it came to tasks, which was the biggest reason he’d asked Charlie to leave early. It didn’t mean that today he felt any less exhaustion. By seven pm, when he was finally closing up shop, he felt it in his bones.
It took Cas a good few seconds before he realised that Dean was upstairs with Claire changing her diaper. He heard the pull of the sticky tabs and a quick
As if sensing his fears, Trix - Dean’s orange tabby - came up to him and rubbed her face against his legs. Almost as if she wanted to say that it would be okay, that he didn’t have to worry about it. She meowed before rubbing her face against him again and hobbling up the stairs to her Dean.
He knocked on Dean’s apartment door, still deep in thought. He’d barely been conscious of the drive there. Didn’t remember parking the car, or even walking up the steps to the door. Didn’t remember unbuttoning his coat.
“Oh, Dean.” He didn’t know what to say. As much as Cas knew this couldn’t have been the first time he’d come across something like this. It couldn’t have been easier, to lose someone.
And yet, he couldn’t. The island, for as much as it made him feel like an outsider, it also made him feel at home. It wasn’t just his family - it was his childhood friends, the kids he read to in the shop, the people that talked to him every day and didn’t know or cared if he was talented. It was all of that.
They got to the house — or what was left of it — around eight am. With the morning sun resting on the remains, it was clear just how much damage there was. There was barely anything left. The skeleton still stood, without windows and doors. The once beautiful grey paneling had turned dark black.
“Anything else, Cas, and I’ll do it,” she promised him, before they hung up the phone and she went back to sleep. He couldn’t blame her - part of him wished that he could do so, too. But he couldn’t, he was too wide awake, despite the lack of sleep.
“Today might be your lucky day,” he said, not able to keep the smile from his face. “We found one just like that when we were cleaning up the store earlier. Blue paws?” For a moment, he was thankful that he looked at it before putting it on the counter with the other toys. “We put it up to see if anyone would remember and come pick it up, but no one has so far.”
They sat down on the other side of the booth without saying anything. The girl, who introduced herself as Anna, shook their hands before ordering a cup of coffee and pancakes for both her and Meg. They would share the pancakes.
“No, not really. “ Castiel remembered a night when she’d been seven months pregnant and hurt because he didn’t want her to go out to a club with her friends. “I think we just had different opinions on things.” He hadn’t wanted her to because he knew she would drink, because she still smoked sometimes when she was out. Because she didn’t know where her limits were. “She didn’t want to take it slow, kept going and going. Things really got turned upside down when she started bleeding eight months in and she refused to go to the hospital.”
Once the days grew longer and warmer, they sat outside with Claire in their arms and Trix curled up in Claire’s stroller. The cat had long ago decided that, whenever the crying human wasn’t in it, it was the perfect place to sleep. With a warm cup of coffee and breakfast, they’d watch the birds flying around and listen to their chirps.
“No, Meg. Just, it’s all I ask of you. Get me the papers? Maybe come around to sign the insurance stuff? I’ll text you the address.” He didn’t give her a chance to say anything before hanging up.
But he couldn’t, not tonight. It had been too much, too long a day. The thought of adding that confrontation to his list of things to do was too much.
They ate around the table like a family. Dean wolfed down two servings of his pasta, finally realising just how much he’d worked and just how tired his body was. Cas couldn’t blame him. It was hard work, tiring work, the hours were crap.
It was then he smelled the smoke. The all too familiar smoke. It was then that he heard the crackling of flames, could feel the heat of them. They were licking at the door, the smoke quickly billowing from underneath it. He reached for his daughter, his heart beating out of his chest, arms trembling. His lungs aching, closing in on him.
His mind froze on him. As if an internal computer just went: error 404 - emotions.exe has failed. Restart?
It was adorable, really. How much his friend wanted to help him. Sometimes, Cas thought back at how two months ago, they hadn’t seen each other in over three years. Now, it felt as if they’d never been apart.
“Yeah. Kinda like when you fall on your knee once and it hurts, but then you fall on that knee the next day and you realise that hurt was
“Yeah.” There was a small smile on Dean’s lips, maybe a bit of nervousness too? It was hard to tell for Cas. He got it, though. Even after years, sometimes it wasn’t easy to say anything. Sometimes it wasn’t easy when the way people saw you was on the line.
Dean had still been shook by it, and had taken an hour just sitting there, staring at his cup of coffee, before he’d started on the toast and even then, they barely talked. Dean didn’t say anything before going to bed, and ignored it afterwards.
The look she gave her daughter couldn’t have been emptier. He should have known that she wasn’t cut out to be a mother, the entire way there. From her reaction to being pregnant, to the way she’d reacted to the pregnancy. He should have known.
“She’s here,” Cas said, but his voice was thick with emotion. All he could think was: oh, he cares about her. He cares. And that was a wild thought, a reassuring thought. Something he loved with his entire heart. “She’s safe.”
After a while she had also done that when she wanted him there. He would say something and he would hurt her with it, but she would refuse to explain. She would refuse to say what was going on. She refused to have anything to do with him, going as far as being in separate rooms at all times.
“I have never been quite as popular as you, you know this.” In school, both of them had been in very different places. Even though Dean had been a bit of a side character, he’d had his group of friends that respected him. People had known not to fuck with him.
“I think Sadie knows,” he said, eyes once more flicking up to the person coming in, almost expecting it to be someone he knew. And yet, it wasn’t. It was a stranger. The guy sat in the back of the group, a brown haired kid sitting in his lap, stuffed animal pressed closely against his chest. The boy stared at Cas intently, pressing back just a little bit against the man’s shirt.
He too had walked around with wailing kids for hours until they finally settled and fell asleep or until their medicine finally kicked in and they didn’t feel the pain from teething quite as much.
Castiel got home half an hour later, pizza in hand. He didn’t even bother unlocking the door or putting his things inside before falling down on the porch chair and lighting a cigarette. It felt like ages since he’d taken a smoke break and even though he hated it, he knew it was a habit and he could enjoy it.
Cas heard the first signs of the visitors at three am that morning. Or rather, a tiny visitor. The sharp cries broke through the night and came in straight through his windows. He was too stubborn to close them, too attached to the cold air coming in and cooling the bedroom down.
It was a habit that had started in the last year, right after he had opened the bookstore. Slowly, it had become as much of a habit to the people surrounding him as it had to him. Even though there was a varying public, the same faces kept showing up. If anything, it was part of what made him happy - people liked him enough to return.
Cas had taken a liking to him though. He knew virtually nothing about him, yet something about the way that he’d been with his kid and the way that he held himself intrigued him.
Just one more signature and they’d officially be able to part ways. They’d soon officially be divorced and soon he’d get the insurance paperwork all sorted. He’d get the money and they’d be able to move on. Finally.
He hadn’t noticed it the first time around, but he would need some time to get used to the silence of the room and the house. Their house had been right next to the train tracks. Even during the nights, he could hear the loud rumble of the transport trains, the horns blaring.
It wasn’t until he was almost back to his house that he noticed the car parked at the summer cabin up the road. The lights were on, the windows still open despite the late hour. He stopped for a while, his keys in hand.
After a while, Dean had taken up baby sitting the little girl and had gone to the garden with her. She’d sat on a play mat and smashed random buttons that made animal noises. He’d played airplane with her, Jess sitting on the grass next to Dean and grinning up at them.
happy for Sam. Sam had always been a good egg. Yes, he had some troubles and no, he wasn’t always the trophy son. But no one really was. In which household was there really a golden kid? Not in his. Not in the Winchester’s. Not in any that he knew.
He still didn’t know what it would do to him. “I mean, we’re getting a divorce. No, it’s not on bad terms but-”
Dean came home around eight, with soot still clinging to his hair and the bags under his eyes clear. In the past weeks, they’d settled into a little routine. Cas would make him breakfast, get coffee ready and make sure he could have a quick meal before going up to bed.
They didn’t talk about it further that night, Dean took the hint. Cas knew that he shouldn’t push it off forever - he should call her and let her know. In all forms of the way, it still was her house too, right now. As fucked up as it felt. He should tell her.
The rest of the family was different. Gabriel refused to understand - his mother refused to even think about it or give it a chance. He was happy with the way things were. He had a life, a steady income, his own bookstore. A life that he was slowly building for himself. In between the moments where his family pushed him, he actually thought that he was starting to be comfortable with the place that he was in in life.
All he had was the window. It hadn’t popped yet, he could open it. Sure, they were one floor up, but he could protect her. She would be okay.
“Yeah. She got pregnant pretty quickly after too,” Dean shook his head. “Married too, you know? Mom and I were scared, because you know Sam - sometimes he gets in head over heels. But they work great together: she keeps him on his toes, she keeps her motivated to finish school. She was seven months pregnant, her feet were swollen and her back hurt, but it was a beautiful day.”
The postman had dropped off a thick parcel just that morning, before Dean woke up. Cas had needed to sign for it and everything - which gave away just which papers had ended up in his hands.
Cas wanted to share his bed and wake up with him, wanted to be able to ruffle his hair and kiss his cheek and his nose and his lips. Wanted to be fathers, together. Unless he stopped being a chicken and asked Dean, he knew that wouldn’t happen.
Twenty minutes later he came back downstairs. He’d changed into comfortable clothes, but his hair was still damp. His eyes were red and even though his face didn’t seem red of puffy, Cas wondered if he’d been crying.
Cas drove back home with a head that felt like it would explode. It was full of thoughts that he’d been trying to keep at bay for the past couple of days. He didn’t want to think about the confrontation with his wife or about the possibility that he would see her and fall in love with her all over again.
At least, as far as he knew, the car was still okay. He knew they had a diaper bag in the trunk with some clothes and diapers. She’d be clean and in her own clothes. He would have to look further, look for a goodwill, see if he could borrow something from someone. At least for a little bit.
“I’ve called everyone I know.” Cas had. Even if he hadn’t called, he had sent them messages. “And my parents… no.” He could barely stand to be in the same room as them, let alone live with them for a while. “I don’t think that’s an option at all.”
“I think you realise now, that she’s not good.” Dean spoke carefully, as if he didn’t know if he was overstepping or not. “I don’t think you will. But if you do, try and remember. She’s not the person you have in your head, man.”
Cas didn’t know what to say, how to even start with explaining the mess that his life was just about to become.
Living on the island had meant being out and playing by the ocean when he was a little kid. It never got cold enough for ice or snow so they’d make snowballs out of sand and try to hit each other. Every single time, the plan failed and ultimately they’d give up and lay down in the sand making angels.
Cas had never thought about this much. He knew the tension between them. He knew that some nights, he was afraid to touch her wrong. But the in between moments had been so great. They almost overshadowed the rest.
“Do you think I could maybe get a spare key?” He asked instead, despite Cas feeling like an idiot because of it. “Just so I don’t always have to knock, or stay in when you’re out. It would be nice.”
“Maybe.” He looked at the papers again. “You know. All of that I don’t mind? But she can ignore my calls for days and then have her girlfriend pick up the phone.” That
They were sitting outside, the sun warmer and nicer than Cas had expected it to be. Somehow, it had been three weeks. Three weeks had gone by since the fire. A busy, crazy three weeks in which somehow, life moved on. After the phone call, Meg hadn’t spoken to him again and everything seemed … normal, almost. His heart still ached, but things moved on. New projects popped up at work, Claire grew and Cas somehow swam upstream in it.
Cas knew his family didn’t understand what it felt like; they weren’t the ones who were born without the gift.
Later, after she left, he realised that it’d been because she never wanted to live there with him in the first place. She didn’t see it as her home. To her, it was nothing more than a house she spent the days in and couldn’t be out of quick enough.
“Not enough,” he sighed, shifting the bottle as Claire began to moan in his arms. “What about you? I hope that Claire didn’t wake you up? You didn’t sleep a lot.”
“Hey,” Dean said quietly, opening the door for him. “She fell asleep in the bouncer.” His hair was tousled in the way that made Cas wonder if he’d taken a nap when she did. “She’s been an angel, though. Very different from Ruby when she was younger. She’d scream your ears off.”
Cas called her again the next day, and the next and the next. Eventually a week had gone by and he was
Neither the cot nor his arms seemed to be good options when she was hooked up to the machines though. In the crib, she cried and made the alarms go off every couple of minutes. When she slept in his arms, she kept finding ways to kick the wires off. Both were much to the dismay of the nurses who had to come back and check on them. Eventually, she’d fallen asleep and they’d cleared her. Finally, she could sleep with just the oxygen monitor on her foot.
In seventy years, every single soul in his family had presented their gift before the age of twenty. Most of them started young. He remembered how his brother had been barely two and he seven, and how the teacup in front of him had hovered in the air. It had risen steadily in a straight line before going straight for his brother, who had taken it with a smile and just about managed to not drop it in his lap.
In the dark, it took him a minute to recognise him. “Cas? Hi.” He seemed surprised to see him there, which Cas couldn’t blame him for. It was a random hour to meet here again in the best of scenarios. Especially after they met only so briefly.
“Hello?” His brother, too, sounded sleepy, but the hum of the car engine in the background told him that at least he had already been awake.
Dean was talking him through the neighborhood, babbling about old friends that had now moved away and about the people who had lived on the block when Cas was there and still lived there. About the boy across the street that had once slipped on the ice and landed into a full split in the middle of the road.
“Thank you.” He didn’t know what else to say. He could have lost her. But because of Dean, he didn’t. “You.” He shook his head. “You saved her life.”
Their grandmother had the same gift as Anna, but had been a lot more focused and in control of it. She always told them she’d been ten when she managed to light the fireplace on fire.
“Thanks, man.” It was clear that Dean felt a little uncomfortable underneath it all, even though there really was no reason to be.
“Chief wanted us to stay for a debriefing, sorry I was so late.” Dean shook his head. “You know? It’s not even.” He fell silent, looked straight up at him. “No, forget it.”
She did. She went through each page as everyone painfully looked on. Then she opened the envelope for the insurance company.
Cas had gone back to the house twice, both times to go pick up more stuff. There were a few albums that hadn’t completely been destroyed because they were in the garage. He’d been able to set up his new laptop and get pictures from the cloud, but it wasn’t the same.
Cas on the other hand had always been seen a bit differently. He had also had friends and for a great part, they’d overlapped with Dean’s, but he’d never quite felt like he belonged. Part of him knew that it was because in some sense of the way, he hadn’t. He hadn’t quite belonged in the way that Dean had, or Charlie.
There was only one thing that managed to distract him from thinking about all the maybes. It was Claire, still asleep in his arms. She looked the same as always now that she was cleaned up. She was still herself. At least she was a constant right now. He couldn’t wait to take her home, and feel at peace too.
He knew that it was late, and if anything were to happen he’d have no means to call for help. It felt strange, not having a phone on him after years of having it glued to his hand.
“Don’t worry about us. We’re okay.” Cas smiled, aware that his voice quivered slightly. “I - I love you.”
“You know, you might be surprised at the answer,” Sam had said before stepping through the doors to join the rest of the family outside.
“They cleared her,” Cas said as he put a new diaper under her. “Told me just as I came back to the room.” It had been a pleasant surprise, the first inkling of good news after the last couple of hours.
“I remember.” Cas did remember what vague details Dean had told him about the fire. It hadn’t been a lot. “I’m sorry, you know. To be honest.”
It had been with a heavy heart that Cas signed the paperwork. He’d still gone home and asked Dean if he was sure that this really was a good idea. If they had done the right thing. Cas sometimes truly wasn’t sure. Dean would just scoop him up in a hug and tell him that yes, it was. That things would be okay.
“Two weeks, to get away for a little bit, explore some of the island. It’s been a while since I’ve been here myself.” He freed a hand from under the toddler, extending it out to Cas. “I’m Dean, this is Ben.”
He had forgotten to thank Dean yesterday, too. In the moment, everything was happening so fast: the cars arriving, the upstairs windows smashing, the house’s groans under the fire, but most of all his daughter coming out of the flames in the arms of a firefighter.
It had only taken him eleven years to make it come through. It had taken eleven years for him to open his mouth and say: I love you. He didn’t think he’d ever meant it as much as he did with Dean. Had ever felt it as deep in his soul with him.
Mary Winchester opened the door, a smile lifting her lips when she saw her son standing there. Castiel allowed himself a good look at her as she pulled Dean into her arms. It had been too long since he’d seen her. She’d aged, but she’d done so gracefully.
Maybe he should have opened them a long time ago. Yes, he had seen Dean feed her before, but somehow, it tugged on his heart strings that he had become so tender with her. When she was done, he laid her against his chest, where she promptly fell asleep.
“I don’t know,” Ellie whispered back at him, her little sing song voice cutting through the tension in the room. “You know?”
“I will,” Cas promised. He watched as his brother drove off, before going to the garage and opening the side door. He’d been lucky in that prospect, that the flames didn’t get to the garage. When they’d gotten the place, he hadn’t been sure why it was so far away from the house. The real estate agent hadn’t been able to tell him either, just a quirk in the building.
It was fine with Cas. It wasn’t that they were anything other than friends. In the past couple of weeks, he’d gotten more and more painfully aware of the way that his heart started clenching when he saw Claire and Dean together, at the way she clung to Dean more than she ever had to Meg, even if she’d been around her in the forming moments of her life.
“Yes ma’am,” he said and couldn’t help but smile at her too. She pulled him into a hug. “Not so little anymore.”
“I just closed the shop when I saw - or well, heard - you walking,” Cas said, almost apologetically. “Wanted to come say hi and thank you for coming to the reading. We don’t often get new faces - it’s always nice to see people joining in.”
“I had to call her afterwards and it... Well, it wasn’t pretty. We haven’t seen each other since the night she left,” he admitted. “I don’t know if I want to see her again.”
“Gotta pull off the bandaid one day,” he said. “Look, I get it’s hard. I do. It’s not like you’re buying flowers. You’re signing divorce papers and it sucks. It sucks ass. But you gotta do it someday, man.”
“We’re sorry,” he repeated, “but without your wife’s signature, we’re afraid we can’t proceed with the claim.”
“I don’t think so,” she said, head tilted. “Does it have a circle on the tag? I mark ours with a red sharpie when they come in.”
It occurred to him that he didn’t even know where she lived right now - if she was still living in the same state. She could have moved, gone far away.
“Not a comment on your reading skills,” the man whispered back to him. “Nothing has gotten him to sleep quite as quick, not since he got scared on the boat on the way here.”
Cas hadn’t told his brother yet, hadn’t had the heart to say that she’d walked out on them, that he was still hoping for her to come back to them.
Maybe it was just the company he had needed. Not being alone with a crying baby that wanted things all the time. Maybe it was that. He truly didn’t know. He didn’t know a lot right now.
He tried calling Dean twice, before resorting to sending him a message. Cas knew that if he was just driving, he wouldn’t be able to pick up the phone. He tried to tell himself that it was just that, that nothing had happened to him.
keychain. “You can put them on something else if you mind. I thought it might be easy to have them on something.”
Truth was, he didn’t know what to do. He guessed he needed to call her again and explain and see if she could file the paperwork again. See if she could arrange for it to be sent his way again. He hated it with all that he had.
It was well past two when all the families finally left. A couple stuck around, talking to Charlie as their kids browsed books or snuggled with the big teddy bears. Cas had withdrawn himself for a moment to the break room, just to get a snack and a drink in him. To catch just a little bit of a break.
“It sounds like it,” Dean answered, the relief clear in his voice. “I’ll come pick it up first thing in the morning. You might have just saved my ass.” He thought for a second, before adding: ”Actually, probably also my ears. I have no clue what I’d do with him if he continued to scream like this for the next two weeks.”
In the distance, the porch light turned on. He could see a vague figure come outside, with what had to be a kid in their arms. The cries soothed the longer the kid was outside and thankful, he closed his curtains again.
Cas sighed, taking another sip of his beer. Claire was somehow still asleep on the monitor, her little hand curled on the paw of her bear. He was staring at her chest slowly rising and falling. It was the only thing that kept him from freaking out about telling Dean all this.
It was like a slap to the face, a cold shower. He didn’t think he’d ever truly realised that, not until this. Not until this happened.
He got endless notebooks from his family filled with recipes and tried again and again and again to make them, but he didn’t have a feeling for it. Cas hated the process and couldn’t wait for it to be over.
It was why he sometimes dreamt of leaving the island. Why he’d been almost on a boat twice - both times the weather too stormy for them to leave for the hour long journey to land.
Dean was silent for a while, almost as if he needed to think about what he was gonna say next. As if he was weighing his words. “It doesn’t sound that healthy.”
Cas didn’t know if it was his place to mention it, or talk about it. He didn’t know if he should be the one bringing it up. If Dean didn’t want to talk about it, he shouldn’t be prying. If Dean wanted to share, he would.
The first thing Cas did was pull out the stroller, so Claire could at least sleep more comfortably. He then swiftly got to work, checking the stuff in the car, taking inventory of what got messed up because of the fire. Some of the things were too damaged, smelled too much like smoke for them to keep. He didn’t mind it so much for old textbooks, but for some of the unopened wedding gifts, and even some of the pictures they took when Meg was pregnant with Claire, he did. He felt his heart break in little pieces, watching the now soot-covered face of his newborn daughter. Some of their spare bottles had been in the garage as well, and with some washing up, they’d be useable. At least he had something for her.
“It’s okay.” Cas would probably do the same, take a nap when Claire went down after her bottle. “I’m sorry.”
