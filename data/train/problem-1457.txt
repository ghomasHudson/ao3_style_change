So this is new.
What in the world…?
He’s in his room. In Baker Street.
“John,” Sherlock says sternly, and only then John does turn to look at him.
much, and Mary… she was all dressed in black and had a gun and you were
“Sherlock, it’s the procedure,” Gregson sounds awfully tired.
“Happy birthday Daddy!” Agnes says, then turns to hug John’s waist.
Sherlock gestures to John who understands immediately, and docks the man.
He touches his mouth. There’s nothing.
“John Watson is definitely in danger.”
As they run down the stairs, they notice that Mrs. Hudson has electricians over.
“Daddy! Papa said breakfast’s ready, so you need to wake up,” A little girl’s voice says, and Sherlock turns on his side, grumbling.
“John, there’s a hitman set on you, or at least, there should be.”
Sherlock had proven that, time and time again, drugging John up to prove a point, and other unpleasant instances.
Sherlock looks over at John, and he knows they are both thinking the same thing.
“No, no, John, please. I… I’m in love with you too. God knows your wedding was torture. I left early, didn’t you notice? Couldn’t bear seeing you and Mary dance. I have always loved you too.”
. Sherlock can do nothing else but roll his eyes and gesture for John to follow him.
He thinks of his dull, married life with Mary, that month he had spent waiting for Sherlock to contact him, dreaming of him while in bed with his own wife.
In his thrashing, Sherlock turns on his side, panting like crazy.
I fell in love with you and ruined everything. You are welcome to stop talking to me now. I am going out for a smoke.”
“Drink up,” He says softly, and Sherlock, wonder of wonders, complies.
John decides to be patient.
“John?”
I fell in love with you.”
All that sorrow and grief, was the soil for the beautiful flower that is their life now. And they regret nothing.
“There’s no
“I know of the hitmen. I know the code is a fake. I know of your network. You’re over.”
Sherlock doesn’t move.
John doesn’t know Sherlock is still terrified of Moriarty.
“Fuck,” He murmurs, resting his head back.
But then they hold each other, or Agnes, and know that this is for real.
“We are working on cleaning your mess, and clearing your name. You’ll have to dismantle Moriarty’s network, though, I know no other man more capable than you.”
John is almost falling asleep when Sherlock suddenly jerks up. His blue, green eyes are focused on something behind John’s shoulder, so John turns.
John stirs, his foot touching Sherlock’s, but he immediately retracts it.
John thinks of when he met Mary. Of her being a fresh balm to his wounds. For the sense of grief, of guilt, of longing and regret he had experienced after Sherlock’s “death”.
“John, come see this,” Sherlock demands, snapping John away from his thoughts.
He and John haven’t slept in the same room, hell, the same house, since forever, he and Rosie living in another apartment close to 221B.
“Scarf… wrap, wrap scarf above wound, and call Mike!” John grits out.
John stops in his track. He can’t say it. He had shoved it down, repressed it so deep inside of him that he had convinced himself Sherlock was an emotionless robot. He can’t say it now. It feels too real.
“Sherlock, I don’t understand what is happening. I don’t know if we traveled in time, I don’t know if we are dreaming or hallucinating and why. But I do understand you’re the real Sherlock, and not s figment of my imagination. I know you for real.”
“Tsk tsk tsk,” John puts two hands on his shoulders.
John is speechless. His breathing becomes erratic, and he shakes his head.
Pain and regret shoot through Sherlock’s eyes. “I’m sorry you got wounded, how can I ever make it up to you?”
“Why did you never tell me?”
John is a PTSD expert. He
“John I-”
Sherlock snarls, passing his fingers through his hair.
What. Is. It.
His face
John’s chair is still there. Sherlock doesn’t let anyone but John sit on it. He is such a foolish sentimental.
Sherlock must read John’s desperation, because, slowly, he turns.
“You’re right, my love. I’d kill those bastard.”
Sherlock is married to his job after all, and John would never come before that.
A single tear streams down his face, before Sherlock steels himself, and his usual aplomb comes back.
Their lips press together. Once. Twice.
“The day I met you. We were laughing by the stairs in 221B, we made a joke about invading Afghanistan, then Angelo brought your cane. That’s when I knew.”
He likes this. This calm, peaceful, simple… being together. Just him and Sherlock, Sherlock working and John providing the usual insight or dumb idea that always puts Sherlock on the right path to find a solution to the enigma at hand.
What had gone through his mind, at the moment, was something along the lines of “It’s never gonna happen anyway, and I have the perfect excuse right now to taste John’s lips.”
A flash of confusion flashes over Moriarty’s features, but it is quickly hidden.
“Fuck, Sherlock, I’m sorry,” John says, “I didn’t-”
. The most natural position they have ever been in. Sherlock’s chin fits like a puzzle piece onto John’s hair, and so do their chests, flushed together, their arms and hips.
Which is so… weak and stupid and embarrassing and ridiculous.
God, the tension John has accumulated in all those years, finally leaves his shoulders. It feels so
But that is wishing for the impossible, John knows it, and so he sighs, and starts following Sherlock.
Then, a commotion, a woman yelling, “Sir, you cannot get in there!” And John can see Sherlock barricading himself in his hospital room.
“Of course, John, because the cold floor is a preferable option to sharing a bed with me.”
“Mary…” Sherlock breathes, and John tenses up, never losing sight of Moriarty.
He would not even pretend-kiss him. What, if he is so repulsed by Sherlock why doesn’t he go back to the stupid job at the clinic? Does he crave adrenaline so much that he puts up with disgusting Sherlock?
Sherlock slowly comes to, and he obviously notices the light, so he asks, “John?”
John sees Sherlock shiver, probably remembering the horrors of his mission.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says, ruffling his hair, walking back and forth.
“I jump.”
“Oh dear,” Mrs. Hudson exclaims, and the other workers stare in fear at the tiny man who had knocked out a man much taller than him in just a few seconds.
Biting on his tongue, realising he had said perhaps too much, Sherlock looks out of the window.
Tired of lying and pretending, and the Universe has given him a second chance after all, so why not grab it?
John nods, and he and Sherlock walk close to each other in the chilly air of November. However, John is not feeling cold at all, since the back of his hand is brushing against the detective’s, and that is enough to send his heart aflutter, like a sodding school girl.
“I’m a war veteran, and I love you, and I’m not letting you out of my sight again. Never again.”
He gets into the small hotel and up the stairs, before realising he doesn’t have the key.
Sherlock slowly calms down, sagging in John’s arms. They stay like this a little, hugging each other tight, breathing in each other’s skin.
She is about to answer him when a thundering voice reaches them from atop the staircase.
He needs to say it, prove to Sherlock he is serious. But a simple ‘I love you’ won’t be enough.
“What’s your plan?”
Slowly, his mind gets heavy, his thoughts sparse, and he finally,
But, soon enough - and much sooner than Sherlock would have liked, John puts his hands on Sherlock’s pectorals and pushes away, lifting his head to stare into Sherlock’s eyes.
now.”
John just… he doesn’t know shit.
Who could it be? Who- Fuck!
Sherlock, my hands were drenched in your blood, I… how are we in Baker Street?”
“Sherlock,” John implores, and Sherlock sighs.
“Cracking,” John croaks, before letting out a moan of distress.
“Call Mycroft, tell him about the hitmen, and stay in the house. I’m going to St. Barts.”
“Nope,” John says, “You are not working this late. Go to bed.”
“No… You… I heard you tell Irene you weren’t gay.”
The lady nods, smiling faintly, while Sherlock turns around with a sweep of his long Belstaff.
“So, have we really traveled back in time?”
Sherlock must see the determination in John’s eyes, for he just nods and says, “Mycroft, he’s coming with me.”
“Sherlock, please, I don’t understand what’s going on and I need to see your face.”
Sherlock snaps a “John? John! Are you listening? We need to go out now!”
“All this time… We could have been together. But I was an idiot. I ignored all the signs because it was convenient. I am sorry, Sherlock. I am so, so sorry.”
Suddenly, John’s eyes flash with anger. “Why have you never told me any of this?”
John,” Sherlock spits out, “I am
, John thinks, his heart beating fast and so loudly he is scared Sherlock might hear it.
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Nothing.”
“I guess,” Sherlock is shaking like a leaf, his muscles all tensed up, and John’s eyes are full of tears.
“I have reason to believe our suspect will be close by in the next three hours. He has already seen us so we should be careful not to show our faces.”
He has hunted down every single one of Moriarty's men and women, and not once the name Moran had come up.
“I have always loved you, Sherlock. Always. SInce the day I met you and you cured my limp, that’s when I fell in love with you. And with every shared adventure, every little thing you did, I fell in love even more. But I was scared, scared you were just an emotionless machine after all - despite all the evidence pointing otherwise. Scared of ruining our friendship, which had saved me from a life of loneliness. I almost offed myself the night before I met you. But then you died, and Mary was.... easy, comfortable. I never loved her like I loved you, but I couldn’t risk a - what I thought was, happy, healthy relationship for you to reject me. So I stayed with her. And then she shot you and we went back two years and a half in time and I. I still love you like the first day. No, even more. You’re the best person I know.”
“Where’re you gonna sleep?” Sherlock asks, a feeling of uneasiness at the pit of his stomach.
, his mind supplies)Sherlock rejects him, at least he won’t have any regrets. Also he’s seen how much Sherlock cares for him, at his wedding and now.
John scutters closer to Sherlock, his need to protect him growing stronger by the second. He rests his face against Sherlock’s back.
John rubs his hands together.
, his mind supplies.
“No, no…” he whispers.
They will stay friends no matter what. He takes a big breath.
Sherlock shuts his eyes tight, his heart pounding like crazy in his ribcage, echoing, dull and fast, in his ears.
John shuts his eyes. He is not going there.
me, John, I already know Moriarty’s tricks and schemes, and I’m ready. I won’t jump, I won’t get tricked by him.”
And Sherlock looks at them carefully, and notices one of the men is hiding a silencer and a weapon in his toolkit.
“John, up… up on the roof, y-you said you loved me. DId you mean it?”
Which means, John has never actually hugged him, not even when Sherlock had come back from the dead, and expected a tearful reunion, John had just… straight up attacked him.
“Took your time.” Sherlock is furious. He is furious at John for being his first damn love, for being the love of his goddamn life, and not reciprocating his feelings.
This is ludicrous, it’s just John, for God’s sakes!
“Say what?”
John smiles at Sherlock’s flushed cheeks.
John is going to say,
“You cannot arrest me now! I need to see John wake up,
Sherlock rolls his eyes and goes brushing his teeth. He just strips to his boxer briefs and exits the bathroom.
“Oh yeah, a real prima donna,” John says, but there is a softness to his tone that makes the lady smile.
John doesn’t know about the nightmares.
“You brought your lapdog,” Moriarty’s smile is like a snake’s, “How cute. Could you tell him not to bark?”
“Are you my mother?”
John is already in bed, his back turned to him. Sherlock takes one steadying breath and settles under the cover, his back to John’s.
“What do we do now?”
“Christ… You mean… all this
When his eyes adjust to the darkness, he immediately reaches to the side and turns the light on.
“JOHN! Hurry.”
They look over to Agnes, eating some pancakes, and smile.
There’s such determination in John’s eyes, the flash on an ancient pain and fear and something
“Most curious,” He just says, because even though he is freaking out, he doesn’t want to freak
“You’re smiling,” He states.
Sherlock leaving the wedding early, for example. How could have John not realised?
“There’s no time now, there are hitmen set on Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, too. They were bribed by Moriarty. Ordered to kill you if I don’t jump.”
Sherlock looks up and nods.
“I thought I had lost you… again,” Sherlock can hear it in his voice, that the man can hardly breathe.
Sherlock is not used to John hugging him. Like, at all. He had hugged Sherlock at his wedding, but Sherlock was such a bundle of nerves back then that he hadn’t reciprocated. So he doesn’t count that one.
, falls asleep, his last coherent thought being that John would look good in the morning, all groggy from sleep, waking up beside Sherlock. He doesn’t wanna miss it.
There is no other possible explanation for this feeling of
“Agnes, please,” Sherlock digs the ball of his palms into his eyes.
“Morning, John. And morning, Agnes,” He crouches to be at his five-year-old’s level, and she smiles.
John smiles bitterly, “I’m bisexual, though I’m not fond of labels. I have had men. In school and in the army - Sholto, remember? We almost eloped.”
John gets up from the bed, and takes Sherlock to the bathroom with him. He sits him down on the edge of the tub, and fills a plastic cup with tap water.
“We can share the bed, maybe? There’s not really space on the floor and it’s big enough anyway.”
But John was as dense as brick, completely clueless to Sherlock advances. That night Sherlock had cried himself to sleep, as the alcohol wore off.
John is tired of this maddening wait.
John sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose with a furrowed brow.
His heart now beating fast and loud, Sherlock starts climbing the stairs of his Mind Palace, the stairs that lead from the Cellar of Fear, to the Garden of Hope.
He sounds panicked.
He grabs Sherlock’s nape and pulls him down till their mouths meet.
But John
John gets his gun and points it at the madman.
Sherlock falls to his side, and holds his hand.
, and goes to the bathroom, without speaking a word.
Mycroft lifts an eyebrow, but then sighs, defeated.
It all fits so perfectly, Sherlock starts to wonder if there is a God who made it all possible.
“I would kiss you right now, if my leg wasn’t screaming bloody murder.” John murmurs sheepishly, and Christ, he’s not a schoolboy anymore. Why is he blushing? It’s just Sherlock. His best friend.
Sherlock does as instructed, and he cannot stop mumbling
Sherlock stumbles out of bed as fast as he can.
“Well, I’m
John bites the inside of his cheek, and buries his face in his palms.
With this, the detective disappears up the stairs, leaving a flustered John behind, exchanging awkward smiles with the lady.
221B.
Sherlock, his heart beating fast in his chest, runs over to his calendar and gasps loudly.
It feels so good, so right, John feels exhilarated. He starts smiling in the kiss, and he is grinning so openly it’s hard to keep his lips moving, but Sherlock is giggling too, so that’s fine.
“My wife is just the same,” She shakes her head, her lips still curled up.
John chuckles fondly, “Come on, go.”
“Don’t say it,” Sherlock murmurs, so softly John almost doesn’t hear him.
“You wouldn’t believe me,” he simply replies.
“JOHN!”
John feels rejection, which quickly turns to resentment, flash throughout his body.
That was all he had ever wanted, but not like this. Not for a case, not for playing pretend. John wants the real deal.
He thinks of Mary.
“Why would you have needed to know? You have Mary.”
John looks at Sherlock, “We are lucky,” He mouths.
“Right or left side?”
John inches closer.
Mary was now in prison, and John’s now two-year-old daughter, Rosie, was being looked after by Molly as he and Sherlock embarked on a case that would have given John some pocket money that would have been very useful indeed to buy Rosie a Christmas present.
Sherlock viciously bats his hand away. “Good job, John,” He snarls, “Our suspect has fled. Let’s go back to the hotel to study a new move.”
John chuckles, but that hurts his leg, and he hisses. Sherlock whips his head around, and upon seeing John is awake, he runs to him.
“We won’t.”
He thinks of when he had cracked the proposal, just because it was what you’re supposed to do, fall in love with a girl and get married. He thinks of always having to put up a nice-guy façade in front of Mary.
“Hey love,” John smiles from the kitchen, and Sherlock wants to grumble in response, but he can’t, he really cannot, and finds himself smiling despite his best judgement.
“Hmm?”
“John-”
John kneels in front of him.
“I see this is a… a
--- Ten years later ---
John steels himself. “How long?”
“Sherlock, Sherlock look at me please.”
Sherlock shakes his head,
They are finally living the lives they were supposed to live.
“No time to explain Mrs. H.,” John quickly yells, and runs after Sherlock.
Sherlock cannot breathe. “That is amenable,” he says, to which John smiles.
God, had the drive to St. Barts always been this long? No, it’s the traffic.
That’s John’s voice. But something’s off.
“Oh?”
“You can’t even say it, John. This is stupid.”
John looks awfully awkward, as he rubs his cheek with an awry smile.
His heart is beating fast in his chest, as he watched Sherlock struggle to find the words. Is he gonna reject him? After all, what he had said earlier awfully sounded like a confession of love.
Sherlock wears his Belstaff. Because this might be a dream, but in the slight chance he isn’t dreaming, he must act. And quickly.
This said, Sherlock sits up and is going to get up, when John stops him by grabbing his hand. Sherlock stills.
The wind gets knocked out of him, the floor swallows him whole. He feels like he is falling, spiralling down towards a dangerous darkness.
Fuck John.
,” Sherlock says, bitterly, crushing the plastic cup in his hand. “We missed that train, John.”
“I will sleep by the door’s side,” He declares.
Then, it all happens quickly.
“Sherlock is this the day…”
John might be in danger.
So it hadn’t all been a dream. Puzzled, Sherlock joins his hands and places his index fingers under his chin.
Feeling like a child, Sherlock sits at the desk, burying his face in his hands.
“Why did you never say anything?”
John’s heart skips a beat and he startles. He starts running up the stairs two steps at a time, carrying both his duffel bag and Sherlock’s (much) bigger case.
Moriarty is already running towards the fire escape, that Sherlock takes John’s gun from the floor and shoots at the back of the man’s head.
After a few minutes of Agnes bothering him, jumping on his back and kissing his cheek, Sherlock reluctantly gets up.
John was always second best. And he would have always been. Furthermore, Sherlock did not have romantic feelings.
“You are scared because you have never had a real relationship, and you’re scared of being a dad, and you’re scared of ruining our friendship. I would be lying if I said I am not scared of these same things. But Sherlock I- ”
“I want you to turn yourself in, and watch me destroy your network, piece by piece.”
“You… you can’t go. I cannot lose you. Not again.”
Sherlock’s mouth twitches at hearing John utter those same words he had said the night they escaped from the police, right before the Moriarty showdown.
“John, Sherlock, what in the world are you doing?”
Sherlock stops breathing, and it takes John a few seconds to realise what he has just called Sherlock. He jumps back, Sherlock frozen in his spot.
, to tell the truth, finally.
They hail a taxi, and give St. Barts’ address.
And wait.
Tentatively, he touches his chest. Incredulous at the sheer lack of pain, he grabs his tshirt by the collar and pulls it down. There’s no wound.
“That is never gonna happen,” He says, before taking his gun from his pocket and pointing it at his head.
The detective turns around and starts trotting towards their place, and John relaxes against a wall, his legs feeling like jelly. With a trembling hand, he touches his lips.
John lets out a relieved sigh. He really doesn’t want to go there.
Sherlock is waiting for John at the door.
Sherlock is staring up at him, his cheeks read from the cold, his lower lip trembling, his eyes shining. If John didn’t know better, he would swear Sherlock is about to cry.
He unlocks the door as Sherlock studies his face like he would a fascinating specimen.
Sherlock stiffens up, not replying.
“Giving me all the power, huh?”
It’s the end of an era.
“I love you, silly,” Are John’s last words before he faints, and Sherlock can only stare, dumbfounded, as Mike and other nurses come to the roof and bring John downstairs.
“He’s quite something, isn’t he?” She says, trying to disperse the tense air left behind by Sherlock.
John shakes his head with an amused smile.
John has never seen him like this. And yet, he has seen him like this a thousand times, but, he realises, he had never noticed.
Sherlock breathes out, relieved. So it was just him and John who had traveled back in time, and Moriarty was a few steps back.
Sherlock throws his Belstaff on the double-sized bed (ominous in just its presence, John thinks,) and sits down at the desk, extending his arm, silently demanding for the witness’s and theft victim’s statement he and John have collected that afternoon in Sussex.
There, John is in love with Sherlock. So much it hurts, so much it leaves a bitter taste on his tongue, so much that John doesn’t know what to do with all that love.
It’s Mycroft.
When John comes to, he can hear Sherlock scream.
“Are you out of your damn mind?”
He had done so just because Sherlock and Mycroft had told him to, explaining to him they would expose Mary as one of Jim Moriarty’s underlings. And they did.
Sherlock huffs. “You have Rosie, plus we are old. Let’s just settle for a life as colleagues.”
“John, John what do I do,” Sherlock’s hands are full of John’s blood. It’s disconcerting. It’s scary. It’s a bloody
Right then, the taxi stops, and Sherlock throws the car door open and flees.
Sherlock is crying. Silent tears stream down his marble features, and he even sniffles. He looks so fucking human and vulnerable.
“Then I’m going with.”
, please believe me when I say that I… Listen, I am not good with words but Sherlock: I fucking adore you. You’re the most impossible, beautiful, ruthless, genial, wisest, best person I know and ever will know.”
What a madman.
Before Sherlock’s death, maybe, perhaps, John might have hoped that-
“Sorry, sorry,” John mutters, and opens the door.
Sherlock is already opening the door, that John grabs his wrist.
Sherlock is confused.
“What if he attacks you? I’m coming with.” John runs to get his gun, he checks the safe is on, and then puts it in his jeans.
“Then why are we here and not at St. Barts?”
Frowning, Sherlock sits up, and, wonder of wonders, he manages to without any effort.
“So, what the fuck happened? Were we teleported? A collective hallucination? Did we travel in time?”
“We are not couple,” Sherlock chimes in.
“I can’t let you have her,” Moriarty smiles viciously.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock snarls, playing dumb on purpose.
“Tsk, me? Scared? Ludicrous.”
“No.”
Sherlock had confessed he had never been in love, and John had been surprised. Sherlock was wasted, almost as much as during John’s stag night.
you can do whatever you want to me.”
They have been given, by some immovable, ineffable object in the Universe, a second chance.
, John thinks but doesn’t say,
Sherlock shrugs. “Whatever, you decide.”
“Who did this to you,” John asks, voice of steel, tracing the outlines of Sherlock’s many scars on his back.
And then wait some more.
They enter the room, a simple double with a desk, a chair, two bedside tables with lamps, and a small bathroom.
Then he kneels beside a whimpering John, checking that the bullet hasn’t hit his femoral artery. It hasn’t.
John is actually relieved.
“Are you feeling better?”
could have been avoided if we had just been true to each other?”
He thinks of all the heart-wrenching
“Idiot,” Sherlock hisses, before kissing John.
Watching Sherlock watching him was pushing John very quickly toward the threshold of his own pleasure, even though Sherlock hadn’t so much as laid a finger on his cock.
He needed to say something, needed to tell Sherlock that he wasn’t going to leave, couldn’t possibly leave now after realizing how well and truly they’d become tangled up together. John might have his flaws, but Sherlock had them too, in spades, and it occurred to him in that moment that that was precisely what Sherlock had been trying to tell him.
Burns, who has also been pointedly silent until now, must notice Sherlock’s increasingly desperate expression.
He studies John from his place beside the curtains (he knows exactly where he must stand in this room to avoid being seen), watches his chest rise and fall with the rhythm of his breathing, watches his eyes flicking back and forth under his eyelids, counting the ticks, observing precisely when he shifts into R.E.M. sleep.
Over the sound of the creaking hull and the ever-present trickle of water running down the sides of the ship, Sherlock can hear the distant repetitive clanking of what he knows are the ship’s pumps—somewhere beyond the partition that separates the passenger’s cabins from the rest of the deck—but in and amongst all the other sounds, today, right now, he can distinctly hear the sounds of singing.
Sherlock was still holding the gun in one hand, John realized, as he brought it between them to reach for the buttons on John’s shirt. He pulled hard at the knot in John’s tie, tugging it apart, before tearing the buttons open with frantic fingers, diving forward with his mouth as soon as he’d parted the fabric to devour the exposed skin at the groove of John’s throat.
Sherlock scrubs a hand over his face in frustration, before hunching back over the page again.
The weight of John’s body is a welcome one against Sherlock, as is the presence of his very prominent erection pushing in against Sherlock’s hip.
“Didn’t you hear? The Colonel’s opened up a cask of his private store of spirits—and there’s more drink for everyone!”
It would be bliss to walk through the familiar woods and rolling hills around the home where he grew up, to see the soothing hues of England’s shores, but this—this entirely new landscape that is alive with sounds and smells and textures that are strange to Sherlock—well, there is no word for this.
“For failing utterly to convey my true feelings.”
The spray from their splashing is laced with starlight.
Sherlock understood.
The thought is grounding.
He has not moved that case since the day the porter deposited it at the foot of his bed at the beginning of the journey so Sherlock never noticed this blatant structural anomaly.
“You think you’re safe because you’ve got your precious sailor friends to protect you, but they can’t be with you all the time, can they? Like now for instance. Where is your precious John Watson when you need him, hmm? Where is he?”
When Sherlock pulls back after several moments to catch his breath, he says to John, in a quiet voice. “I think the same thing about you, you know.”
John let out a moan.
Sherlock’s eyes flicker back up to John again.
Sherlock hadn’t said a word since the encounter with Jones, and John could feel the weight of his silence starting to press against him, drawing his notice. They had been working for hours to help clear the warehouse and now it was almost midday, the sun burning unusually bright in the colorless London sky.
The hysterical parasol-wielder is led away by her companion and Sherlock is relieved to be able to watch in silence.
He needs more information.
Sherlock rushes forward to take Lestrade by his other arm, steadying him on his feet.
“John,” Sherlock says again, the joy in his voice vibrating underneath the word like a song.
“It will be fine,” Sherlock tells him, trying to convince himself as much as John. “She’ll be perfectly fine. And Lestrade will be back before long. He can look after her then.”
Sherlock’s bed was empty.
The day started out hazy and still, but now it is past noon and the sun has burned off the cloud-cover. A low fringe of puffy clouds clings to the horizon but they do nothing to alleviate the direct force of the sun overhead—Sherlock can feel every scorching beam of it beating down against his face.
Sherlock breathes out with John, before drawing in another long breath. He repeats the motion several times. Gradually he feels his hammering heart begin to slow down.
“Why are you telling me all this?”
Sherlock sniffs. “
Sherlock groaned in response and leaned over on one elbow to reach for something in the darkness at the foot of the chair.
Pleasure rolls through Sherlock’s body at John’s words, and he remembers his own cock lying heavy against his thighs.
Sherlock was so caught up in John’s singing that he only now realizes he’s been painting the same strip of railing for the last three minutes.
But just as quickly in the wake of all that sweetness comes a rush of bitterness.
It does not take as long as Sherlock thought it might to fill the gleaming copper tub.
Sherlock is quiet against John, digesting this.
“I need you… against me…” Sherlock licks his lips. “With… no clothing between us, just you. Just me.”
Where were the offices located on a ship this size?
Sherlock hears Mycroft’s voice in his head. It’s like the hiss of a serpent.
Worse still, seeing John look at him like that makes the tiny shard of jealousy wedged in under Sherlock’s heart feel suddenly like a betrayal. Why can’t Sherlock trust John as implicitly as John seems to trust him?
Sherlock swooped in close to John with sudden intensity, his eyes burning into John’s through the darkness. John was having difficulty concentrating. “I don’t…”
“I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to look her in the eye again.”
“We were hardly in a relationship before we left. Being forced to spend every hour together made it painfully clear how much was missing.”
With a feeling of unbelievable relief—he can now pull John to him, with
If it hadn’t been for Sherlock pushing him against the wall on that burning cruise ship, he probably never would have said anything at all.
The feeling, when he starts to stroke, is enough to make his eyes fly open again in shock.
“It was really… incredible, what you did. Giving us the chance to be alone like that,” Molly’s cheeks color briefly but she hurries on. “I don’t know how to thank you.”
“That’s right, run away, little rat! I’ll let you go this time but if I catch you skulking down here again….”
Patterson and Matthews are right behind John, standing by the anchor chain to await their orders, the rest of John’s mess taking their positions at the capstan with another group of sailors.
John was currently hard at work appreciating the vast diversity and dynamism of their flatware collection. He was lying on his stomach in the middle of the living room floor, surrounded by knives and forks, having upended the entire contents of the silverware drawer. His face was propped in one hand, feet waving merrily in the air, as he gazed adoringly at the handle of a shrimp fork.
Sherlock recognizes Anderson’s scowling face in their midst and gives the group of officers a wide berth, working his way instead back toward the quarterdeck, where he sees broad-shouldered Mr. Jackson standing beside Lieutenant Lestrade, deep in conversation.
For one horrible second, Sherlock’s heart stops because it looks as though John has dropped over the side of the ship into the sea.
But Sherlock does not question him. He simply follows the Lieutenant without a word, down and around the beams under the stairs, away from the forecastle where the party was held the night before, down to the deck below it where the ship’s cannons line the narrow gallery.
Sherlock is feeling slightly overwhelmed by the insinuations at work behind this good-natured man’s remarks. He’s struggling for what to say in response when John tugs on his sleeve again to lead him away.
The ocean is a cool blue on the horizon.
If Sherlock was certain the situation could not possibly get worse, he realizes now with dawning horror, just how unmistakably wrong he was. Anderson has appeared at the heart of the crowd of sailors, his smug face fixed with a pompous and self-important expression.
John is straightening up over him, and Sherlock arches his body forward like a bow, pressing the weight of his erection against John’s hip.
Sherlock expects this last hour to be the slowest, the most excruciating of all, but instead, somehow it’s over before he’s properly ready, and suddenly everything is happening too fast.
John’s mouth has returned to kissing the sensitive skin on the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, his fingers so close to Sherlock’s aching cock, but still not touching.
“What was your plan, Dr. Watson? Just stroll in and shoot us point-blank? Rather inelegant, wouldn’t you say? It seems you’re suffering in more ways than one from the loss of your friend.”
, this was erotic.
Sherlock nods again, and Lestrade, seemingly satisfied with this, turns and heads toward the staircase at the end of the gun deck.
“I can’t believe we’re actually here.”
He pictures John grinning down at him, standing, sun-bronzed and smiling, with his hands on his hips. He feels too self-conscious to turn around and look.
“Would you like to leave so I can show you what it is I’ve planned for us?”
Sherlock’s mouth was open when John reached it, his tongue pushing up hot and sweet into John’s. He tasted like the pastries he’d been eating—that, and a little like desperation as he pushed up into John’s mouth with a sound like a growl in the base of his throat.
Sherlock rushes forward, almost tripping over his own feet in his eagerness, but before he can get close enough to say hello, he is seized with a sudden lurching feeling of self-doubt.
“Good,” John says, his hand settling on Sherlock’s lower back to lead him off the dance floor. “I just need to stop by the table on our way out to collect my things. I left them with the lads when I came in.”
Sherlock wants to touch John everywhere at once, wants to rub his mouth all over John’s body but he knows John has been hard for a long time now and as apprehensive as he is about getting it wrong, he’s desperate to get his mouth around John’s cock, so he lets his hands slide back down to frame John’s hips.
“—not going to have this conversation again!”
Sherlock’s eyes fall on John, his cheeks burning scarlet before he can even open his mouth.
He looked like the god of sex—on his knees before the flames, hair tousled, lips bitten and swollen, eyes half-shut as he allowed himself one leisurely stroke before crawling forward, the hunger in his eyes like twin pinpricks of fire, bending his body down over John’s, lining the tip of his cock up with the entrance to John’s body.
“You can’t still want me! I’m nothing,
“Where are you going?”
“My god, Sherlock, you—you’re so beautiful like this. You’re exquisite.”
He licks his way down John’s neck, delighting in the strong curve of the muscles there, the way the tendon stands out as John lifts his chin to give Sherlock more room, fingers still scraping gentle circles into Sherlock’s scalp, sending little ripples of pleasure over Sherlock’s skin.
“On your feet!”
Sherlock finally sits back with reluctance, watching with sharp eyes as John flicks open the fastenings on his trousers with one hand and lets them fall to the floor.
John sits back, the damp cloth held tight in one hand, and Sherlock watches relief wash over his face like water from a burst dam.
There was something about Sherlock just after a case that had always been infectious to John, that had made him want to drop whatever he was doing and stretch himself out beside Sherlock, studying the gentle rings of smoke he blew from his mouth, trail his fingers over the prone curve of his throat as he tilted his head back.
He wants to demand that John tell him where he is going, insist that he cannot go unless he takes Sherlock with him, to rage at him for daring to leave Sherlock here for even an hour when they have so little time together, but then he sees the look on John’s face—soft and open and patiently waiting for whatever it is Sherlock is about to say and Sherlock feels something in his chest give way.
“It’s fine, Sherlock. It looks much worse than it is.”
It took a second for Sherlock’s expression to clear, and then, narrowing his eyes at John, he stalked over to the silverware drawer and dug out forks and knives.
John lets out a low breath.
“I can’t believe you,” John breathes. “Watching you play like that…You’d never heard any of those songs before in your life. How did you do that? How… how can you be so—?”
Sherlock finds he can no longer bear the sight of the misery on Baynes’ face, but when he averts his eyes to look up at Deverall instead, what he sees there is worse by far.
Lifting his head, Sherlock glances at the hazy beams of daylight slanting into his room. It must be almost noon, which means John will be switching from his position in the foretop down to working the pumps very soon. The captain told Deverall to instruct Anderson to come see him at the end of his shift—when would that be? The midshipman’s watch usually follows that of his mess, which means Anderson will be done working when John finishes his shift at the pumps at eight bells.
An angry silence ensued while John mulled this over.
“Did you—” John’s voice was halting. “That night, were you also—I mean, was it—besides being just a test, at that point did you also—?”
Sherlock licks his lips and forces himself to look up at John’s face. “What time is it? Are you… should we…. do we have time?”
Sherlock can hear the minor swell of pride in Ferguson’s voice that he imagines the other man could not suppress no matter how he tried.
“You see you’re the final bride. The next one for the chopping block. I thought it was appropriate given the carnal nature of your sins. I imagine you were something of a virgin in this context, and as you know, virgins lose their worth once they’ve been had. Once the maid has been deflowered, she’s dog meat. Worthless.” Moriarty pressed the flat of the blade against the underside of John’s throat, forcing him to lift his chin. “That’s the trick with virginity. Only valuable until it’s been taken.” He tilted the knife until the edge of the blade bit a clean line into the skin of John’s throat, making a mark identical to the one on the other side of his neck. “And it’s clear your card has been
John sat up, feeling worry beating hot and swift in his temples. The sudden shift in Sherlock’s demeanor at the mention of a case was typical; the gravity in his expression was not. He pulled his trousers back up his thighs, now regretting his decision not to shower earlier.
The sight of John like this, dangerous, full of fury, lit up at the edges like sun bursting through an advancing storm cloud, it makes longing pour through Sherlock like molten gold.
Molly looks back at him, eyes shining, cheeks still flushed with anger, but catching his eye and seeing the humor there, her mouth breaks suddenly into a smile, and Sherlock thinks, not for the first time, how different she looks when she smiles, how it transforms her from a plain, forgettable girl with faded brown features to someone vibrant and clever and full of life.
Sherlock’s chest swells with indignation, as if the man has offended him by the very suggestion.
“Let me look at you.”
“What? When?” John was suddenly horribly aware of Sherlock’s hands on his arms. “Don’t be ridiculous. No! No, of course not!”
“So the captain knows you care about me? So what? I don’t see how that makes our situation any worse than it was before. What I don’t understand is why he didn’t want the information that you said you had for him. Which was what, by the way?”
Lestrade shakes his head. “Thompson was a last minute addition to the crew—same as the captain. He came aboard the day before we left port. There’s a reason I didn’t send for him that night I fell ill.”
He shakes his head, frustrated. Now he can see that there is an unmistakable trace of worry in John’s face. That is unacceptable. Sherlock has to do better—he has to make John understand.
clean and if the activities that Sherlock is hoping will transpire actually do, well… there are certain places that he wants to be
“Deverall!” Lestrade shouts. “I need you!”
Sherlock’s arms come up around him and hold him in a vice-like grip. He can feel Sherlock’s mouth against his neck, murmuring soothing things, though he can’t hear them over the sound of his own sobs.
Sherlock lets out a long, shaking breath.
John moans his approval at this development, his hands still deep in Sherlock’s curls.
Sherlock staggered back a step. He looked at John and there was a flash of something in his eyes that made John’s heart pick up.
“John—”
“Change in the wind. That and all the heat we’ve been having. You can feel it in the air, can’t you? Feel that heaviness? That charged quality?”
“And did you?”
Or maybe something else would be just as effective…
“It’s called a guitar,” Mycroft told him later, when they’d left the spell of the enchanting street musician behind and were sitting in the carriage on the drive back home. “Very popular currently at the Spanish court. That man was certainly from Spain—he was playing in the Spanish style.”
“Would you like me to do what I did for you this morning?”
“Yes! Look, he’s not going to carve us up. It’s not as simple as that. This is Moriarty. It’ll likely be something much more psychologically disturbing.”
John’s arms are smooth and warm—so warm it’s as though Sherlock can feel the presence of the sun still on John’s skin and he slides his hands up, up over the cords of muscle, gasping into John’s mouth as he feels the shift and flex.
“It took everything I had in me not to go through that damned door in spite of that fuckwit Anderson standing there.” John’s voice is scraped raw with fury. “The only thing that stopped me was the thought of what he might try to do to you if I did.”
John dragged himself with effort into a sitting position and propped himself against the headboard.
He stares in horror through the darkness, blinking hard—his heart pounding in his throat.
He decides to keep it simple.
, he thinks.
John says nothing in response to this but Sherlock can see the worry etched deep between his brows.
“As much as I’ve grown accustomed to a life at sea sometimes I wish…”
“John.”
“You look… good.”
There is a small but frantic shuffle of activity as space is cleared in the center of the room. Old Leroy sets his stool down on the edge of this space, a man with a silver hoop in his ear sits down next to him with a tin whistle, and a younger sailor in a stocking cap pulls out a curiously flat drum with a handle on the inside, and a stick in the other hand to hit it with.
He cannot bring himself to say anymore, but he hopes it is enough.
John stands like that, leaning out into the sea to watch the anchor’s progress as it’s eased off another device with a hook at the end, before he climbs back over the gunwale.
The voice sounds just like John’s.
It took only a split second for him to recognize Sherlock, but the adrenaline that surged through him at the sight was enough to make him start violently.
Even so, Sherlock has rarely seen this many members of the crew up on deck and not working all at once. There are still a handful of men up in the rigging, but the majority of the crew are all splayed out in the sunlight, shouting and drinking and smoking; and what’s more bizarre still is the number of passengers also present on the sunny deck.
Then turning, he kicks the gunwale beside him as hard as he can.
The accident breaks the tension of the moment.
He remembers being treated to a few dried-out husks of an orange one night after supper, not long after the ship left Madeira. He cannot say he’s enjoyed anything that’s ever been put before him on the ship’s table, but he remembers forcing himself to eat those few slices slowly, with the knowledge that he did not know the next time he would see fruit of any variety.
“Tell me…” John licked his lips, reached a hand down to rest on Sherlock’s slender hip. “Tell me how it feels.”
Sherlock does, the passage of his fingers made easy by the slickness inside of John.
“It’s all right,” Sherlock said, kissing his wet cheeks, his movements slightly halting, unsure, but his hands still so gentle where they cupped John’s face. “You’re all right.”
“Still, taunting a man with a loaded gun pointed at your head? Not on, Sherlock.”
John sits up, propping his weight on his elbow, and grins up at Sherlock with one eye shut against the glare of the sun.
It doesn’t make any sense.
To put Sherlock at ease, he goes into the bathroom, cleans off the gash on his face and bandages it.
John fell quiet, his hand still circling Sherlock’s back. He stared into the fire, felt all the dark thoughts of the past two months licking at the edge of his consciousness like the flames climbing the logs.
He turns their joined hands over to study the back of John’s hand, the strong shapes of his fingers and the delicate crisscross of scar tissue over his knuckles that Sherlock knows now almost by heart.
He looked broken open.
The delicate chain is silver and thin as a spider’s web. It weighs almost nothing in Sherlock’s hand. Suspended from the chain is a small silver locket with the initials M.W. carved into its surface in elaborate script.
The realization stopped John cold.
Sherlock feels something hard and cold solidify inside his chest at the memory of Stevens’ eyes on him while he was speaking, the proprietary look as he’d stood so casually discussing helping himself to Sherlock’s body as though he were a whore up for bid at an auction. There was something chillingly clinical in the tone of his voice, in the blasé assumption of ownership, like Sherlock was a plate of meat presented to him at a tavern for the taking.
Miss Hooper suggests that they go for a walk up on deck after breakfast and Sherlock find himself nodding in mute agreement, swallowing down the lump of pain this suggestion brings suddenly into his throat.
John’s voice is apologetic. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I don’t mean to judge your mother. It isn’t my place to have an opinion on her treatment of you. Of course, I can’t know what it was really like. I wasn’t there. But I hate that she made you feel that way. Sherlock—”
Anderson opens his mouth, likely to say something nasty, but the other man cuts him off.
John’s touch on Sherlock’s face softens, his thumb sliding down to trace the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock shivers in response, his body leaning, as though of its own accord, to press forward into John.
I am sorry, my lovely readers, that it has been SO ABYSMALLY LONG between updates! But life has been very busy-and will continue to be so- until the end of this year. I will be spending the next month (starting next week) taking my TERRIFYING PhD qualifying exams which will keep me very busy, and sadly, will prevent me from writing (at all??/ at least as much as I'd like) for the next month. But if all goes well, I will be back after that, with a VENGEANCE!
John can barely speak above him.
He watched the look that passed over Sherlock’s face in response to the sound that he made and lifted his mouth to Sherlock’s as Sherlock dove forward to kiss him.
love ‘sweet sticky breakfast foods’.”
Sherlock’s hips bucked and he made an inarticulate sound.
“At least he hasn’t stopped them getting in the lifeboats,” John muttered in Sherlock’s ear.
“Tim Briggs evaded arrest. He’s not in custody. We’ve had no sign of him for a week but the murders have stopped.”
Instead, he retreats into his room, eying the bag that he packed earlier with a look of pure poison. The small parcel of items he’d arranged to take to shore sitting neatly beside his violin seems to mock him with its aura of hopeful expectancy, making something sharp and painful twist inside his chest.
Much as the sight of her tears makes the panicked feeling in Sherlock’s chest intensify, it also causes some modicum of human decency to come to life within him. He has a vague notion that leaving a woman to cry openly in his doorway is a violation of some basic social code. Not that Sherlock usually cares about things like that, but it also occurs to him—perhaps somewhat belatedly—that Molly is his friend before anything else, and whatever the reason for her distress he should at least try to offer her his aid in whatever capacity he is able.
“I can’t tell you, Sherlock, how trapped I’ve felt all my life.”
“You heard the boy’s punishment then?”
He does drink, deeply; feels John’s eyes on him all the while, watching the movement of his throat as he swallows.
“Well, then…”
He feels awful—worse than after any night of drinking he’s experienced (and John has done some heavy drinking in his day)—but the ache in his body is gone and he no longer feels the burn of fever.
“John…” he purrs, oozing forward, all his bones turned to liquid at the heat of John in his palm, the iron-velvet feel of him.
“I know… I feel exactly the same.”
“I saw him with you yesterday,” Sherlock begins reluctantly, already feeling foolish before he’s even spoken the words. “When you were coming up from below. You were… laughing at something he’d just said, and the way he was looking at you… it just seemed so obvious that he… likes you. Not in the way everyone likes you, I mean…
There’s still something like apprehension in his eyes.
Sherlock lets John tug him by the hand, out from the shadow of the cannon, and back across the deck.
“You didn’t have to sit up with me all night,” Sherlock said, his voice softening a fraction of a degree. He glanced up at John. “That must have been hell on your shoulder.”
Mr. Jackson inclines his head in a deferential gesture. “I do believe so, my lady.”
John had expected Sherlock to sneer at Mycroft’s insistence on propriety and turn his nose up at his brother’s gift, but it turned out if there was one thing Sherlock had a weakness for it was fine clothing.
Sherlock nods, his eyes clinging to John’s frame like a limpet to the side of the ship.
“Oh, my love.”
Sherlock wriggles his hips in closer against John’s thigh, his body responding with eagerness to the realization that he’s lying curled against John without a stich of clothing on.
Sherlock shakes his head. As much as he’s panicking at the realization that his feelings for John are perhaps more public than he thought, there’s a feeling of profound relief that Molly knows and doesn’t… well, hate him for it. He’s still not over the shock of it.
“Keep an eye on those two. See to it that this ‘friendship’ doesn’t turn into anything more unseemly. I’d hate to have to make an example of such a promising young sailor. It would be such a waste.”
Their shouts and laughter, and the pounding of their dancing feet, provide a welcome din to drown out John and Sherlock’s conversation from any eavesdroppers.
“I would have regretted that incident if not for the good friend I made that day in Mike. He’d been on merchant ships before. Without his help, I never would have learned the ropes as quickly as I did. Hell, I wouldn’t have lasted a single day.”
Sherlock pauses, absorbed in a sudden onslaught of memories.
“No,” Sherlock says, more adamantly than before. “You’re mistaken. You’re entirely mistaken. Miss Hooper is sweet on Lieutenant Lestrade! They were dancing together when he became ill. I promised her that I would let her know how he was getting on. She was so worried about him I couldn’t break my promise.”
“Well, you didn’t,” he snapped. “Besides, you were right. I’d already lost more than a significant amount of blood by the time they arrived. If you hadn’t phoned Lestrade, I would have bled out in that alley. As for my history with hospital personnel,” Sherlock’s voice was practically a sneer. “I’d rather not talk about it. Ask Mycroft for details if you’re interested. I’m sure he’ll be more than happy to fill you in.”
When he sits back, he runs his tongue deliberately over his top lip, watches John’s eyes track the movement.
“I’m going to have to disagree with you there. I would consider that an extremely exciting activity to witness.”
Surely, she can’t mean—
The guests in the boat screamed again, but this time in relief.
“What is it?” he asks, worry rising in him at John’s look.
John grabs Sherlock by the arms and spins him around, pushing gently until Sherlock is sitting on the bed.
He crouches down beside John, unfastening the first few buttons on his waistcoat before he returns to work. He catches John looking over at him.
Sherlock is so lost in the whirlwind of his thoughts that he almost forgets about Miss Hooper entirely.
Sherlock watches a man loading clay bricks onto a wagon, his face shining with sweat.
It’s quite possible that he already knew, that the demand for this piece of information, like all his other actions, was merely a power play—to show that he could get out of Sherlock anything that he wanted.
Nothing noteworthy occurs.
He emerges into the sunlight, blinking hard, his mind reeling as he tries to come up with a plan.
Sherlock sighs as the material slithers off of him.
slightly taken the edge off his arousal. His desire was still there, thrumming all through him, but it was as though someone had turned the volume down, and he no longer felt afraid that he might shatter into oblivion from the first touch to his cock. The gentle contact on his scalp was satisfying in an altogether different way, and helped put a check on the ravenous part of his desire.
Down, down they sink, never stopping, Sherlock’s legs still kicking weakly without result, the water growing darker the further they sink.
Then John recognizes Sherlock and he laughs.
John looked up at Sherlock, all his sorrow momentarily forgotten in the sweeping force of his rage. “Get off me.”
“Breathe into me. We’ll live down here together, we’ll be safe.”
John’s arms come up around him, and as he lies there, still inside of John, with his arms and legs twined around him, his cooling cheek pressed against John’s chest, Sherlock thinks,
His eyes flicker briefly up at John, to take in once more the sight of his body licked gold by the light of the candle, the grooves of his muscles lying deep in shadow, the subtle movement of his chest hitching with his breath, before his eyes come to rest on the lovely curve of John’s cock where it meets his thigh, the head of it flushed and swollen.
He turns frantically, looking for a means of escape.
Sherlock had delivered his most searing scowl and flounced into the carriage without another word.
This is John—
Sherlock runs his fingers over his sore windpipe, halting momentarily in his panicked pacing as a frightening thought occurs to him.
Not exactly an impressive line of deductive reasoning. John puts his face in his hands. It’s no use thinking about it. He isn’t going to get anywhere trying to figure it out. Not without Sher—
Sherlock closes his eyes in an effort to ignore all of the distracting, self-conscious thoughts clamoring in his brain; tries to concentrate instead on the feeling of John’s mouth against him, John’s palms hot on his thighs.
Sherlock’s heart is pounding hard. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.
“…Taking you apart piece by glorious piece in the sand… out in the open… the sun warm on our bodies… and no one around for
If Anderson is in control of John’s mess, that means that John now defers to him, and such is the nature of discipline on merchant ships that if Anderson decides that John has done wrong (regardless of whether he has or not) he is subject to Anderson’s word and law. If Sherlock does anything to displease Anderson then Anderson will make John suffer.
A wave of fury moved through him. “What’s wrong is that I don’t like being attacked when I’m on my way out of the bathroom! Now stop acting like a fucking panther and let me by!”
There’s nothing out of the ordinary in the ringing of the bell—it rings out every half an hour to mark the changing of the sailors’ watch—but as the bell continues to ring, far longer than it does for the changing of any shift, Sherlock realizes, sitting up with a start, that the bell is ringing to alert everyone on the ship of something else entirely.
“No, no, it’s best if I return on my own anyway. That way I won’t have to deal with any unnecessary questions.”
Sherlock holds his breath.
Seeing him, her face breaks into a smile.
“I… should have said something earlier in the evening, as soon as I noticed it but…” John sighs and the sound is full of regret. “I was hoping maybe I had imagined it, that I had… misinterpreted somehow. But I realize now I should have said something right away. It isn’t fair to either of us. In all honesty, I think I was trying to pretend like I hadn’t seen anything, hoping maybe that I’d imagined it. As though wishing it could change things.”
Molly’s eyes flicker pointedly to her aunt seated beside her. ‘Sorry’ she mouths across the table.
John couldn’t help himself. He lifted his chin.
“But John, one as fine as this…” He looks up at John, almost afraid to ask the question.  “How on earth did you manage it?”
John figured he should probably feel filthy and ashamed after what they’d just done, on their own coffee table nonetheless, but curiously, he didn’t. He felt relaxed and very, very pleased, happier than he’d felt in weeks, in fact.
He does this several times, letting his mouth linger over the place where he can feel John’s heartbeat, fast but steady, underneath his lips, before he returns his attention to John’s nipple, this time opening his mouth against the sensitive flesh and licking a lazy circle around the circumference.
John sets the bottle back on the desk and then passes the full cup to Sherlock.
Freakish looking, that’s how he has most commonly been described. Even when he came of age, he never fully filled out, the high collars of his dark frock coat rendering his tall, lean frame into that of an awkward heron.
John Watson was worried about Sherlock Holmes.
“It feels like…
John’s mouth is trailing slowly down the length of Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock can feel him pause and lick his lips against him.
Now that he’s said it out loud Sherlock realizes just how ridiculous it sounds. But he has to say it—otherwise the sour fear of his own doubt, which seems to live inside him always, cramping his stomach into knots, will never leave him. Better just to get it over with—to give John the chance to get out now, if he wants to.
He moans at the sight of it, his fingers shaking with eagerness as he drags John’s trousers down his thighs and then stoops to pull the garment off each one of John’s feet until John is standing—finally—completely naked in front of him.
John is still kneeling at his feet and although Sherlock cannot see his expression in the dark, he knows that the look on John’s face is a melancholy one.
After several minutes of the utter bliss of Sherlock’s massaging fingers, John heard Sherlock’s soft voice telling him to tip his head back. John did, and felt Sherlock use the cup he kept on hand for shaving to pour warm water over his hair, rinsing out the shampoo.
Then John had another dream, and this one wasn’t good.
“Anderson’s off duty then, so we shouldn’t have any trouble from that quarter. I’ll have Billy send word if I can—to confirm. The lads are going to help us out.”
“What is it?”
“Yes, my love?”
him? The captain of this ship? Sherlock…”
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to break away, his breathing shaky. He pressed his forehead against John’s.
Sherlock has heard jigs played at country dances, and he’s played one or two in his time—simple exercises to warm up, but never like this, never in the heat of the moment in the middle of a sea of people, pounding their feet and clapping their hands. He’s never played music like this before. It’s nowhere near as complicated as the arrangements that Sherlock usually plays, the symphonies and concertos on which he cut his teeth, but the energy of it is affecting in a visceral way.
There was something vaguely impossible about seeing Sherlock asleep and it occurred to John that although of course he knew that Sherlock slept, he had never been able to imagine it. Whenever he tried to picture it, he saw Sherlock in a meditative pose with his eyes shut, fingers steepled beneath his chin, or Sherlock sitting in lotus position on his bed, his spine perfectly straight, staring directly ahead. He had never been able to come up with an image of the impossibly energetic man not moving long enough to fall asleep if he wasn’t thinking.
In the brief time that had passed since they’d exited the elevator Sherlock’s mood had shifted again. The raw energy that had been sparking off of him since their chase through the icy streets had dissipated, or if not dissipated, had been pulled inward, out of sight. There was something there that John couldn’t put his finger on, something deep, but impossible to read, as vast and impenetrable as the darkness that lay beyond the window.
Sorry these chapters keep being so short- this is all I can manage to gasp out between writing final papers. I imagine they'll start getting longer as soon as I am out of school next week.
He pulls his mouth back from John’s, gasping slightly, feeling his pulse throb against the vial clutched in his hand.
John re-focused on his paper but the silence coming from the couch was so loud he found he couldn’t concentrate.
As Sherlock watches John walk away across the deck, his self-restraint crumbles.
John’s gasp in the darkness is like a gift, his hair sliding soft against Sherlock’s cheek as he stiffens in response.
Sherlock follows John’s gaze, but can see nothing in the starlit darkness that would suggest rough seas up ahead.
He reaches out blindly to seize hold of John’s arms, whimpering, senseless, his voice a dry rasp of need. “John—”
Pretty please leave a comment if you like what you read- I love hearing from you!
says a nasty little voice inside his head.
Ms. Grimsby is glaring daggers in Mr. McKinley’s direction.
He presses his forehead in against Sherlock’s and shakes his head. His voice is hushed between them, full of regret. “I meant to wait until we got there. This wasn’t part of the plan.”
It’s happening again, Sherlock thinks. He’s hearing emotions in John’s voice that surely cannot be there, but he can’t be mistaken this time. The reverence in John’s tone is so sincere it’s almost worshipful.
“Mmm, you smell even nicer than the coat.”
There was no bruising yet and the bleeding had long since stopped. He watched Sherlock’s face intently for any flickers of pain as he felt along the bone and was satisfied when he saw none.
Sherlock worries.
And he wishes he could see John better, wishes he could freeze time in this moment so he could forever capture the sensation of being this deep inside of John, buried in him, the exquisite perfection of this—Sherlock can feel the pulse
Thank you for reading, my nautical darlings! Next chapter is largely written so do not fret too much at the conclusion of this one- you have much to look forward to, I promise! Hang in there!
It’s too good—it’s perfect, and as desperate as he is for relief, Sherlock wishes it would last forever, that he could stay in this place always—pulled hard against John’s body, caught between John’s hands, John’s lips hot at his throat.
He watches John’s eyelashes flutter closed at the touch of his mouth and at the sight of John so visibly affected by this simple gesture, Sherlock feels tingling warmth fill his body.
The mass of people is so thick Sherlock takes a moment to climb up on top of an upturned barrel to catch his breath, and take in the sprawling crowd around him.
Molly lifts her pint to take a long drink and Sherlock, remembering his own, does the same.
“Sherlock,” John says in a soft voice. “You don’t have to do this.”
Sherlock draws an unsteady breath, but still he doesn’t open his eyes.
Instead, he stood resolutely at Sherlock’s side, lifting his eyes to the small gold numbers ticking by as the elevator climbed higher and higher into the Viennese night sky.
Sherlock’s voice was a snarl. "So you’re suggesting I sit back and
“You love me,” he breathed, his voice cupping the words the way you would hold something utterly fragile, utterly breakable in your palms.
“J-John.” Sherlock pushes his quivering body into John’s, unable to ask for what he wants, senseless to almost everything except for the feeling of the blood pumping through his cock.
“Oye!” Somebody shouts in Sherlock’s direction, “Tell Mr. Watson’s young man to go and fetch his fiddle!”
Sherlock swallows John’s protest with his mouth, pushing his body forward into John’s.
“That we’re what?”
In spite of the weariness of his body, his exhaustion from all that he has done that day, Sherlock’s body is wide-awake. It is lit up, singing, dragged to sudden vivid life by the touch of John’s lips against his skin.
“And if you’re nervous,” John goes on. “Don’t be. I’ll be here to guide you through it. I’ll show you what to do.” John’s thumb strokes back across the plumpness of Sherlock’s bottom lip. “And if you don’t like it—any of it, you just tell me.” His thumb stops stroking abruptly, his eyes deadly serious. “If you want to stop, we’ll stop. It’s all fine by me. But you must tell me if it gets to be too much. Will you promise me that, Sherlock?”
“Either way, you still owe me a kiss.”
After sunset, John said, but that may as well be hours from now based on the glacial pace with which the sun is making its descent. The longer Sherlock looks at it, the more convinced he is that the sun isn’t actually moving at all.
“How is everyone this morning?”
John’s hands on his body are unbearably gentle.
” He ground his hips down into John’s for emphasis. John let out a hiss that Sherlock mistook for anger. “You’re just a sore loser.”
when wet.
Sherlock twists as hard as he can to break free of the other man’s grip but Ferguson is stronger than he looks and he does not relinquish his hold on the back of Sherlock’s neck.
“I know.” And then Sherlock feels ashamed, and he buries his face in John’s neck and refuses to let him up.
He was so much more responsive, so much more attuned to his body after he’d allowed himself to drop back into the awareness of his physical reality, even after just a few hours.
They are loveliness itself.
John had never met a man in all his years who was both so enthusiastic and skilled at pleasuring this particular organ.
“That’s right. Easy does it.”
Anderson smiles and Sherlock doesn’t like one thing about that smile; it makes Anderson’s confidence look unperturbed, makes his eyes glimmer coldly with pleasure. “Oh no? That may be, but it just so happens that I
John makes a whimpering sound and Sherlock moves to reach for him, to hold him by his hip, to give him some support because if John is experiencing even a tenth of what Sherlock is experiencing in this moment then he must feel as though he’s coming apart.
, John told himself, his head swimming with the effects of the alcohol and his own anticipation. But when Sherlock’s hand began to creep higher up his thigh, John held his breath.
He can see
The hot feeling in Sherlock’s throat seems to choke him.
It took the better part of an hour and half for John to organize the chaos Sherlock had created and establish a methodological system for their search. As much as Sherlock could be tidy in his experiments, when it came to cases his order went out the window. He got too impatient, especially when he was close to getting the results he wanted, which is why it was a good thing John had an especially tidy mind.
John hesitates, something dark and fearful creeping into his voice.
“My god, Sherlock—look at you.”
“But to leave Miss Nancy Blair behind.”
He lifts his arm off of Sherlock, rubbing a hand over his face.
Panic flutters at the edge of his mind, like a moth around a flame, disrupting the clarity of the light, making it flicker in and out, so that he’s not certain whether he will succumb to it entirely.
John kisses him before he can finish the thought.
of it.
Sherlock pushes his chair back from the table and follows Ferguson out of the dining room.
“You said…” John swallowed hard, struggling to concentrate in the wake of the burst of desire that Sherlock’s words, Sherlock’s eyes had incited in him. “Earlier, you said I wasn’t the only one who’s been longing in silence. How long? How long have you felt this way about me? When did you realize?”
“Now take that, and don’t ask me who sent it! For I canna tell you.”
He ignores the small pang of sorrow that moves through him at the sight of John’s other hand, curled into the air at his side, clearly longing to touch Sherlock in some way but resisting.
“I’m ready, Sherlock. Give me everything.”
“Alright,” John says, his voice rough. “If you’re sure.”
to help people. He wouldn’t have stood by and let a man die if he knew he could do something about it.
John’s arms pull Sherlock to him in the dark, and Sherlock acquiesces gratefully, lets John turn his body gently so that he is on his side and John is lying close behind him, tucking his hips in against the curve of Sherlock’s arse.
John held himself very still, ignoring the intimate feeling of Sherlock’s breath on his temple as his fingers delicately manipulated the fabric around John’s neck. He smelled of aftershave and some sharp, clean scent that John recognized as uniquely Sherlock. He fought the instinct to shut his eyes and lean in closer.
Sherlock nods; mildly surprised by this request.
Sherlock took a large bite of egg and looked up at John. The innocent expression on his face looked unsettlingly genuine.
He still cannot believe that it’s true.
He’s doubled over, clutching at the rail. Molly’s joined him. She’s let her parasol fall. There are tears streaming down her cheeks.
“I know it didn’t really work. But she was worried someone from the ship would recognize her. It was the best I could do under the circumstances.”
The realization that Sherlock was almost completely right in his assessment did make John feel a flicker of real irritation.
His fingers shook in Sherlock’s hair. He made a sobbing sound under Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock pulled away.
It’s just after four o’clock in the afternoon and it’s the time of day Sherlock knows the sailors call the dog watch, which is half the length of a sailor’s normal shift. There are two dog watches, both two hours, that take place from four to eight o’clock—the shifts are shorter than normal because this is the time of day when the watch turns over, and it gives the sailors a chance to eat their evening meal. It’s also the time of day for members of the crew to take a break from work, for those who are not on watch to sit up top and smoke a pipe, or play a game of cards.
He offers Sherlock a smile but there’s no light in it.
“Oh, just before you come up.”
Sherlock turns, looking for the tell tale glint of John’s hair in the sudden commotion around him.
Sherlock takes John’s hand in his and leads him over the scrubbed surface of the deck, shining slick with moonlight, toward the staircase at the back of the ship, back the way they came so many hours earlier but now with their positions reserved, Sherlock leading, John following soundlessly behind, and Sherlock reflects just how much has changed in the short space of time. When he walked this way earlier, he did not know the feel of John Watson’s hands in his hair, the taste of his mouth, how he looked just before he kissed Sherlock, and Sherlock pities this former version of himself for all he did not know, how naïve, how inexperienced was this self from just a few hours ago.
The only consistent bright spot in the evening is the fact that Anderson is not among the guests. Every time Sherlock sees the flash of a uniform out of the corner of his eye, his heartbeat starts to pound in fear, until he remembers with a wave of relief that Anderson has been banished from the festivities.
Sherlock jumps like a spooked rabbit, immediately hurries to wipe the tears off his cheeks. It’s the young sailor—
Of this fact Sherlock is painfully aware—Anderson wouldn’t spare a glance for John Watson if it weren’t for him. His hatred of John is only by proxy of his true hatred for Sherlock, and his desire to see Sherlock as miserable as possible.
“Shut up, John.” Sherlock growled, thrusting his hips into John’s palm. “And touch me.”
John slid one hand up to the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulled Sherlock’s mouth down against his, reaching out with his other hand to grab hold of Sherlock’s fingers. He dragged their hands up above his head, arching his body up into Sherlock’s as Sherlock pushed down into him.
John’s heart was pounding in the hollow of his throat. He thought he could hear the words that Sherlock wasn’t saying, was almost certain he knew what lingered unsaid at the end of that sentence but he couldn’t be sure, he couldn’t count on it.
of coffee in this bed, you are calling room service to deal with it, not me.”
“It wasn’t much. He didn’t—he didn’t do much of anything. What he said was far worse. And the feel of his eyes on me.” John swallowed, remembering. He pushed the sick feeling away. “His eyes were almost worse than his hands. He put his knife to my throat,” John said, his voice tight with rage as he remembered Moriarty’s cold hands on him. “Made a cut to match the one I already had.”
Still, the man hesitated, his small eyes flickering from one officer to the next, as though weighing his options.
John finally looks up at Sherlock once he’s fully dressed, his eyes moving meaningfully to the gaping hole in the wall beside them. “We should probably move that back.”
’s midshipmen, so I asked Lieutenant Lestrade to introduce him.”
In an instant, Sherlock’s rage and frustration shift from his sullen former self to his brother.
After several false starts, and several gentle corrections, Sherlock slowly, stumblingly begins to copy the sailor’s movements.
John pulled a match out of the box and dragged it down the strip. He stepped in close to Sherlock, cupping his hands around the flame as he did so, and felt the corresponding heat from Sherlock’s torso as he leaned in close.
John could feel his pulse reverberating in the fresh wound on his forehead, making the room swim around him. His arms ached from the weight of his hanging body. He blinked furiously, struggling to keep both eyes open.
John looked up in alarm. “Careful!” He put out a hand intended to stop Sherlock in his tracks. “The floor is crawling with them!”
Sherlock considers briefly. He wants to ask Molly if she’d like to take a walk with him up on deck after breakfast. However, he isn’t sure whether it’s even worth asking after what he did last night. The pretense he was working so carefully to uphold, of being courteous and deferential toward Molly’s chaperone in order to stay in her good graces, has surely been completely shattered. He’s certain Ms. Grimsby’s opinion of him is lower than it’s ever been.
“I said, it’s a good thing the party proved such a hit with the passengers.”
Sherlock closes his eyes, concentrating on the sound of that instrument alone.
His gaze alights on Mr. Knott, the beetle-browed gentleman who seemed particularly keen on preventing the other passengers from speaking ill of the captain, wearing the same worn frock coat, sitting off to the side at the other end of the table, a pair of pince-nez perched on his nose as he studies a paper in his hand.
He remembers just flashes of that sensation—of what it had been like to play that music in the company of those other musicians—that soaring, open, weightless feeling—and realizes now how badly he has missed it; how desperately he wants to have that experience again.
Underneath the sound of their singing, Sherlock can hear the rhythmic clanking of the pumps, and it’s evident that the beat of the song helps keep the rhythm of the men’s work, helps set the pace as they push the heavy metal cranks up and down in synchronization.
“Oh my god,” he manages, voice trembling audibly.
! Don’t leave me here!”
He satisfies himself by tracing his fingers over one of John’s nipples through his shirt with his free hand, and is rewarded by the feeling of the little bead of flesh stiffening under his fingers.
John kisses him softly, slipping his tongue between Sherlock’s parted lips, as his hand slides down between them, over the trembling muscles of Sherlock’s stomach and along the curve of his hip.
“I think I’ll wait to take this bit last. I know how you cherish it, how worthless you would be without it.”
Thankfully, the captain has turned away from John. He turns on his heel, barking out one last order.
The risk they are taking by letting this happen is immense. If John is caught, they will all suffer the consequences.
He makes a mental note to ask John about all of this as soon as he gets the chance.
"I knew you'd come back," John says, and Sherlock holds himself utterly still to listen. There is pain somewhere deep within him but he ignores it because it’s only physical pain and this is a dream. "If you can come back from the dead once then you can come back again. Isn't that what they say?"
Luckily, John’s eyes are still turned up toward him so he cannot mistake the wild nodding of Sherlock’s head, even in the dark.
John discovered being drunk at a crime scene didn’t turn out to be such a terrible idea. In fact, he debated whether it wasn’t preferable to be mildly intoxicated every time. He had a much higher tolerance for the long boring stretches of Sherlock staring in silence at some minute and seemingly inconsequential detail, and Sherlock’s digs at Anderson were ten times funnier than usual.
Sherlock stares hard at a lantern swinging just beyond the others’ heads, working to affix his face with a look of pure and unknowing innocence.
It occurred to him that their current position was a mirror image of the night Sherlock had been drugged, with their positions reversed. There was something bittersweet in the realization that made the bright feeling in John’s chest glow hotter.
He used to nick things from the other students in University when they made him angry. Just small things: papers, keepsakes. In fact, he’d gotten quite good at it in the brief time that he was there. Not once did anyone ever suspect him. He’d always given the items back eventually, secretly returning them to the precise location where he’d found them. It was somehow more satisfying for the lost item to reappear, weeks later, in the place where it should have been all along, the result of which was to make the offending person suspect that they were going mad.
, Anderson! My god! What is
disappointed if it doesn’t play out the way it’s meant to. That’s one reason I treasure him. No one ever appreciated a complex crime more than Sherlock Holmes. You know that better than anyone, don’t you, John? You’ve seen his glee over a crime carried out just right. The casualties don’t matter. They’re just
“I’m sorry to say it was a rather charming young midshipman, who I had the pleasure of drinking with last night. Baynes, I believe his name was. Lovely young chap. But it seems he isn’t yet old enough to hold his liquor.”
Sherlock is so startled that at first he doesn’t know what to say.
“Because a man’s life depends on it, that’s why!” Sherlock spits, shaking with fury. “Every second you detain me leads him one step closer to death!”
“How is this?”
“Stevens, put the boy down for God’s sake! He can’t well answer you with your fist around his throat.”
“I better get back,” Sherlock says before John has to tell him himself.
Sherlock straightens up, suddenly mindful of the fact that he is using up minutes of Billy’s precious time off duty.
The others are all watching him now with curiosity and Sherlock realizes he has no choice but to follow after Deverall. He has no real reason to protest, and at this point, the sooner he goes, the sooner he can be done with it.
For once, he knows exactly what John is talking about because he feels the same way.
“You’re alright,” he murmurs, lips brushing Sherlock’s hairline. “You’re alright now.”
“Thank god you’re here, lad.” Matthews says in a low voice, glancing warily at John. “We’ve been trying to get him to calm down but so far nothing has worked. He’s really worked up this time.”
“Christ.” Sherlock groaned. “John… That’s… yes.”
“A tour of the—?”
He presses his damp face in against John’s neck, breathing hard, his body trembling lightly, the only thing he can hear for several moments the roaring of his own blood in his ears.
“I know,” Sherlock ground out. “I knew that then, but I couldn’t wait anymore. I couldn’t bear it.”
Every crewmember presently on deck has ceased working to watch the interaction unfold. The men stationed below in the longboats have climbed up the side of the ship and are peering over the gunwale to watch, the men in the rigging hanging motionless overhead.
Sherlock’s forehead was back against his own, his breath hot and desperate against John’s face. John pulled Sherlock still tighter against him, arching off the bed to push his hips into Sherlock’s with more force, increasing the friction that made him feel as though his body was a tangle of electrical currents gathering charge.
come. It was over, in the past. It had all turned out just fine.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Sherlock said, still holding John’s face between his hands.
John’s cock is so thick Sherlock is briefly worried about fitting the whole of its wide circumference in his mouth but he manages with no trouble, at first surprised, and then delighted by the taste of the fluid generously coating the tip.
There is something in John’s voice—regret? longing?—that makes Sherlock experience a strange flip-flopping sensation in his belly where the fiery alcohol is still churning. He suspects it must just be the drink.
“I solved it!” He yelled, slamming his bedroom door behind him.
Sherlock feels his own breath start to come quickly.
John smiles politely.
The captain.
“Leaving so soon, George?”
His movements are slower this time as he dresses; Sherlock can tell by watching him how stiff he must be, how sore. He moves as if his body is brittle, as if he’s lost all of the liquid vibrancy and strength that usually animates his movements, that Sherlock usually marvels at, that makes it seem like the most basic actions he completes are a beautifully choreographed dance.
“Wouldn’t let them out of the ballroom. I didn’t make it up to see if there were lifeboats. And there’s been no sign of Tilly since we spotted her earlier. She wasn’t in the ballroom when the fire started. I checked.”
The moon is almost full; its bright light coats the world in silver, draws the gleaming edge of shining things to life under its touch, makes skeletons among the rigging with a few strokes of its wintry light.
“Good,” Sherlock says, rising to his feet, signaling the end of the conversation. He reaches for the door handle and then hesitates, turning to Billy. “Oh, and one more thing. Tell him I miss him. That, more than anything—make sure you tell him that.”
Sherlock liked the dancing but hated the presumption on his mother’s part, the expectation that he must engage his partner in amicable conversation. He never had anything to say to the women he was forced to dance with. They had no interest in his experiments and he couldn’t care less for the vapid things most women spend their time thinking about. So as a form of protest, he always kept his mouth resolutely shut, and sometimes trod purposefully on his partner’s foot so that she would refuse to dance with him again.
Sherlock snorts against John’s chest, lifting his head with some effort.
The silence in the room is absolute.
In spite of the fact that the large stern windows at the back of the room are opened to let in a breeze, there is hardly any air to speak of today, and it seems the open windows only serve to let in more of the thick, oppressive tropical heat.
“We’re going to have such a good time together. You wait and see. Maybe we can play a little game before we begin. Let’s pretend the knife is Sherlock. We can enact
“Alright,” Sherlock says, licking his lips, which suddenly feel very dry.
He has just finished washing himself and is reaching for his shirt when he remembers with a horrible shock the disturbing events of the previous evening that resulted in Lestrade’s poisoning.
A woman standing behind him began yelling in a shrill voice. “What’s the matter with you? Open the door!”
The locket is warm against his bare chest and looking down at himself and realizing that he is naked except for the thin silver chain, the heavily ornamented locket glinting softly against his pale flesh, he feels his cheeks flush hot. There is something obscene about the knowledge that he is nude except for this keepsake that does not belong to him.
did you do that?"
“John! Thank God. Help me!” Sherlock started to rise from the wheelchair and the nurse made a disapproving noise but didn’t try and stop him. Lestrade came forward to take Sherlock’s arm.
In spite of Sherlock’s severe disappointment that John hadn’t suggested another
Sherlock grabbed hold of John’s elbow and steered them both into a narrow alcove between two buildings. He crouched down beside a collection of rubbish bins, dragging John in beside him.
“That’s more like it. Again, Deverall! And no slacking!”
He raised himself up on his elbows and looked down at Sherlock, grinning. “And how are we feeling about that?”
He hasn’t done it during all the time he’s been at sea, or at least not out loud to anyone. It’s difficult to stop the constant flow of information in his brain as he observes the world around him. He’s trained himself for too many years to really cull the habit.
The joy on John’s face is like that of a small child’s—absolutely pure.
Sherlock sees the change come over John at his words, sees the swell of emotion rising in his face.
Sherlock will never be able to look at his desk the same way again.
John gasps as Sherlock presses an open-mouthed kiss to the center of his palm, his tongue coming out to swirl over the sensitive skin.
John’s face is turned away from him but Sherlock can see the sorrow in his expression in the down-turned corners of his mouth.
Although this song has no singing accompaniment, that doesn’t deter the enjoyment of the listening crowd. Almost as soon as Aidan starts playing, the men begin to stomp their feet in time with the music. Sherlock cannot blame them—the rhythm is infectious. It’s impossible to sit still listening to it. Sherlock can feel it beating in his blood, feeding the notes to his fingers as they fly over the strings.
John nods, gasping, his hands sliding up into Sherlock’s curls to grip at the wet silk mass lying heavy on Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock has never seen anyone dress so fast.
The moist, pungent smell is so potent Sherlock cannot stop himself from gagging. He hurriedly lifts his sleeve to cover his mouth but he’s too late.
His eyes had changed color again. John would never cease to be amazed by the chameleon quality of Sherlock’s eyes. In the warm light of the bathroom, they shone a deep liquid green.
John spent the rest of the day trying to forget what he’d seen that morning in the butcher shop. More than anything now he felt embarrassed that he’d been so affected but every time he considered going back he was filled with horror at the prospect. He felt guilty for abandoning Sherlock so completely on a new case, but it was clearly the right decision to stay away, at least for the time being. Besides, Sherlock was probably so immersed in figuring out the details he wouldn’t even notice John’s absence.
. I can go wherever I like!”
It’s clear this time that John is ready, and he does not ask before slipping one, then two fingers easily in, savoring the feeling of John’s body gripping him as he buries both fingers up to the highest knuckle.
Sherlock seduces John with breakfast foods.
“JOHN!”
It didn’t hurt matters that the trip was all being paid for on Mycroft’s dime. He’d put them up in one of the most luxurious hotels in Vienna, in a penthouse room with a view of the city—well, actually the penthouse room had been Sherlock’s doing. He’d upgraded their room as soon as they’d arrived at the hotel with a charming wink to the smiling woman behind the desk.
The thought bores a hole through him, leaving a void for all the other nasty thoughts that are usually there—that John’s presence manages to magically keep at bay—to come creeping back in.
Sherlock bids the Colonel farewell. Watching him make his way toward the staircase to the upper decks, Sherlock makes up his mind.
John said nothing. He could feel the panic rising up the back of his throat as Moriarty’s words leapt and slithered to the forefront of his brain. No, he didn’t want to remember. Not yet.
He stands for one more moment, hoping John will look back so he can catch his eye, so that he can communicate
He shuts his eyes, feeling cold sweat prickle his forehead, and waits for the feeling to pass.
with you?” Deverall turns to Dimmock, disgust clear in his voice. “Come on, let’s get him out of here.”
John has explained to Sherlock that he is an able seaman, which means he is one of the sailors who goes up into the rigging to help let down and reef sails. Apparently not all sailors are able to do this work—others must simply man the halyards and help with the raising and lowering of sail with two feet planted firmly on the deck. John’s station is in the foretop, which means that when it’s time to reef or let down sails, he must climb to the highest possible point on the ship to do so.
“I’m sure you will,” John says politely. And then with another deferential nod of his head: “If you’ll excuse us, ladies.”
John laughs, the sound bright in the stillness of the sunset deck. He reaches for Sherlock’s hands, still laughing.
He was so wretched all those months ago when the ship stopped in Madeira that he never even left his berth, much less set foot on shore. He feels so differently now than he did then; it’s shocking to realize how much has changed in just a few months.
“What did he say to you?”
They had both shown their hand in terms of the way they felt about each other. It had been clear almost from the day they met that they were willing to risk their lives for one another, but when John grabbed Moriarty and told Sherlock to run, there was no mistaking the sacrifice he was prepared to make.
John takes another deep breath, and at the sight of John’s chest expanding again, his dark nipples standing out from his chest, Sherlock can’t help himself. Some part of his brain knows he should ask first, but another part of his brain is just as certain that this is the right course of action.
“What did you tell him?”
His own responses certainly feel slowed and Sherlock chooses to blame it on his alcohol consumption earlier this evening rather than the shameful possibility that he might actually be frightened of Anderson.
“It’s alright, John. You saved me.”
crosshatches you with shadows.
Over the course of that long, warm summer Mycroft taught Sherlock everything he knew. He taught Sherlock how to keep his head above the surface in deep waters, how to swim below the surface while holding his breath, how to float on his back, and how to breathe properly while swimming. He taught Sherlock not one but several strokes—the breast stroke for ease in rough waters; the side stroke for if he was ever lost at sea and needed to conserve energy while swimming long distances; and the crawl, for when he wanted to go very fast as efficiently as possible.
? This is exactly why I don’t waste my time on this! It doesn’t make sense!”
The seat on Molly’s other side is occupied as well, so Sherlock heads for the vacant seat opposite her.
Then he glides forward—and very gently, with extreme care—settles his lips against John’s.
Cold skin, slightly bluish—chance of cyanosis. Two abrasions on face, one still bleeding. Contusion on back of skull under hairline. Dislocated shoulder. Weak pulse. Not breathing. Not breathing. Not breathing.
“ ‘As I roved out.’” And then when Sherlock hesitates: “Don’t worry, they know it.”
“Oh, he took it alright. And when I find him I’m going to wring his scrawny neck.”
“Fraser, could you please help Dr. Watson be a little more accommodating?”
And now that the opportunity is suddenly here before him again, he can scarcely believe his good luck, can scarcely contain his excitement over the prospect of it.
John moved through nightmares like a ship through dark waves, each terrifying landscape transitioning seamlessly into the next so that there was no respite from the horror. It was like being suffocated under a heavy quilt. Every time he searched for a break in the fabric he found only more material weighing him down until he was certain he would never wake up, that this was his new reality, his own special circle of hell.
“Because I care what happens to you, and because you’re in danger, John,
But John is shaking his head. He looks up at Sherlock and his eyes are full of misery. “We both know that we can’t, Sherlock. We’ve tried and it doesn’t work. It isn’t—”
“See you tomorrow.”
Even though the night is hot, Sherlock feels his body go cold.
Sherlock’s voice was a snarl. “Get out of the way, John.”
He made a valiant effort to swallow down his rage.
Suddenly, everything about the way they are moving together now—their arms around one another, Sherlock’s thigh between John’s, John’s hands so light against Sherlock’s back, John’s hair soft against the edge of Sherlock’s jaw—is charged with erotic potential, until Sherlock’s whole body feels lit up, tingling, and sensitive; he’s desperately aware of each place he and John are connected—finely tuned to every minute shift of John’s body against his.
Somewhere very far away he heard the sound of Sherlock’s phone vibrating itself off the coffee table and onto the floor.
But even if he wanted to, Sherlock cannot stop himself from saying John’s name, not so loudly that the others will hear, but loud enough that he hopes to
He shakes his head.
But to his endless frustration, it turns out that Sherlock’s desire to write a proper response to John makes it no easier to summon the words he needs.
Sherlock breaks his mouth away, shocked, breathless.
He rubs his thumb over the back of John’s hand, following the curve of his knuckles, registering the faintly raised line of flesh that indicates a scar between the first and second knuckles on his index finger, feeling how rough the skin is there, how warm, as though John himself is full of sunlight—greedily taking in every scrap of information that this minimal contact gives him.
Sherlock feels John go still against him, the worry on his face suddenly supplanted by a look of deadly calm.
Still feeling somewhat breathless, Sherlock lets John pull him along by the hand, following the other members of John’s mess until they’ve found a slightly less-crowded corner of the deck, out of the way of the people queuing for their rum.
John thought back to that night, of his own hand on his cock with his back against the door, how hard he had been—god, if he had known that there was even a possibility that Sherlock felt the same…
He leaned against it and shut his eyes, feeling the tide of horror he’d been struggling to keep at bay break over him.
Sherlock nods. “Thank you, that would be—”
John heard a derisive snort. He crossed over into the kitchen and took a big bowl down from one of the shelves. He opened the freezer and filled the bowl with ice. Then he took out a popsicle (coconut) and peeled off the wrapper.
He waits until the feeling passes, eyes screwed shut, counting every heartbeat that shudders through his temples. He
His hand is still moving in a steady rhythm on Sherlock’s cock, and Sherlock experiences a twinge of sadness at the dawning awareness that he isn’t going to last much longer, not with his body pinned at these two places by John Watson’s expert hands. He tightens his arms around John’s neck; feeling like his grip around John is the only thing keeping him from floating away on an ocean of bliss.
Moriarty slid in another tight circle around him. John could feel his eyes on him through the back of his head.
“It’s an absolutely absurd assumption that one’s
haven’t you? Don’t you have better things to be doing than wasting your time with cast-off members of the gentry?”
John’s gaze is filled simultaneously with warmth and darkness; it reminds Sherlock of the light at the very heart of a fire; crackling, and dangerous, full of heat.
Sherlock tucks his head down and does his best to push his way through the crowd, making his way toward the corner of the deck where John’s mess usually congregates.
Sherlock wriggles his hips, encouraging John’s fingers to inch closer.
And then just when they reach the edge of the trees, John stops walking abruptly.
Sherlock does, and then immediately remembers why he’s spent the last ten minutes doing everything in his power to avoid looking at John’s body.
As soon as the food was in front of him, however, John momentarily forgot all thoughts of Sherlock in his hunger.
Sherlock shuts the door behind him, his smile still lifting the corners of his mouth.
“Let’s…” John ducks his head, licks his lips. “Let’s get out of here, yeah?”
“Mmm.”
John nodded. “Yes, thanks again for staying. I—” He took a breath. “I appreciate it.”
“Look, your legs are working just fine. What a pleasant surprise.”
a fantasy of Sherlock’s. Suddenly, it was all almost too much for John.
John leaned back so he could look Sherlock directly in the eyes. “I’m not going to leave. You’re right, it’s all… it’s him. I let him get to me. He’s gotten inside my head, and I—” John drew a shuddering breath, watched the pinprick of light in Sherlock’s eyes growing brighter with every word. John shook his head, his voice gruff, suddenly self-conscious. “I was being an idiot. Of course, I won’t leave. I’m not going anywhere.”
This is lower down in the ship than Sherlock has ever been, and the darkness takes on a different quality as they sink below the waterline.
John loved Sherlock’s nipples—they were a delectable pale pink, the color of the inside of a shell, but even more than the color he loved how unbelievably sensitive they were.
“Do you really?”
When Sherlock wakes, hours later, it is to the sound of John, shutting the door behind him, setting something heavy on the floor at his feet before turning around.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, without hesitating, his own voice rough suddenly, stumbling in his eagerness, in his desperation to convey his consent to whatever John is asking. “Anything, John—it’s yours. Take it. You don’t need to ask.”
They are standing so close together Sherlock can feel the heat from John’s torso in contrast to the coolness emanating from the stone wall at his back. John’s collar is open, and Sherlock can see sweat gleaming in the dip between his collarbones. There is a dark stripe in the shoulder of his faded jacket from where the strap of the bag he’s been carrying has stuck to him with sweat.
Or at least, that was what he’d intended to shout, had the polluted water of the Thames not chosen that moment to surge into his open mouth. What emerged from him may have been more of an unintelligible gurgle.
Keeping his mouth where it was, he alternated the intensity of the suction, lessening the pressure of his mouth in response to Sherlock’s body. He brushed his thumb across Sherlock’s other nipple while his mouth was occupied and heard Sherlock’s breathing grow ragged above him.
His breath began to come faster as he established a rhythm, and he pushed the sheets off his legs so he could see the movement of his own fist as he stroked.
Sherlock knows this is the most likely reason, and he tries to convince himself that it’s true, tries as hard as he can to ignore the teeming list of other possibilities his mind continues to offer up of what might be preventing John from sending word to Sherlock, tries resolutely not to consider the worst possibility of all which is that Anderson somehow intercepted John’s reply and that John is unable to write a response because he is chained up somewhere in the bottom of the ship.
Sherlock’s tongue had worked its way back up John’s neck, his teeth skimming the pounding pulse under John’s jaw, his thigh now rubbing shamelessly against John’s rigid cock.
It’s awful; he does not know what to do, what to say, it feels as though he is paralyzed by the wrongness of the moment. It’s as though because he did not reach for John instinctively he does not have any idea how to act.
His body is all the more hideous to him now in light of what he saw of John’s that afternoon—the power in his muscles coupled with the levity of his movement—so sure, so strong, as fluid as the surf.
John shakes his head. “It’s a simple matter of swapping shifts. Besides, we trust one another. None of my men would ever peach.”
“You’re not meant to be diddling around talking to passengers! Get back to it! Otherwise, I’d be happy to offer you another taste of the whip. Or has it been so long that you’ve forgotten?”
Sherlock waits, listening to the familiar creaking of the ship around them, the distant sound of voices from the adjoining cabins as the other passengers begin to wake up. He can hear the wail of the Damson baby from the deck above.
