Mrs. Hudson looked over at Sebastian, who was cautiously sipping at the tea that a servant had brought to him. She smiled at how adorable the lad was. He was very attractive, but there was something about him that made Mrs. Hudson want to lavish him in kisses and attention. She felt that this boy was kind, and that John and Sherlock were not lying when they said he would be pleasant company.
Sherlock was wasting his breath, to give such a formal apology to a man who could barely clean himself. Nevertheless, Sherlock was taught that he was to apologize if he was at fault, and quite frankly, he was at fault. John remained in his place next to the fireplace, the silence was filled with the cracks of the firewood. Sherlock cocked his head. John still did not trust him. He couldn’t be blamed.
“He murdered a child!”
John moved to the coat rack and spoke with fervor. “Sebastian, you must take me to them, I must help him, safety be damned!”
“Where will you go, Sherlock?”
The woman referred to as Lady Martin took off her veil. Sherlock caught a brief look at her face. She had applied an excessive amount of white paint to her features and garish rouge to her cheeks to hide the fact that she was aging, and rather poorly at that.
“I’ll be in your company, John. Why fear when we are together?”
Ever the stubborn git, John was.
“Don’t be daft, you are John...you are my…”
“Join me,” John mumbled, half-asleep, half-awake, and aroused.
Sherlock scoured his room to find another object to throw until he got a good look at the person he was attacking. The man was short, Sherlock noticed even in the poor light. He also saw that the culprit had no clothes on, as well as scars that closely resembled the ones that he’d sewn on his…
Sherlock placed a hand on his chest and mustered the politest smile he could. “He is a family friend.”
“Did I bother you when we...that moment on the sofa. Was that contact unwanted?”
“Why do you not simply sleep? Do you not feel fatigue?”
John had been watching Sherlock through the window, he had to have been. How else would he have known? He might have been there since Sherlock left, awaiting his return. Sherlock did not leave the flat very often, if only to acquire a meal for the both of them. This was the longest he had been out and he expected John to become worried. He wondered how John felt now, having to carry him up the stairs, nearly getting arrested, having to fight another person - all the things he had just done for Sherlock.
“Are you well, John?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He sighed as they rode on the carriage, thinking back on that night, which prompted Sherlock’s attention.
“It was everything I could ever hope for, John.”
“Off we go, Anderson. You’ll be sleeping this one off at Scotland Yard.”
Sherlock flipped The Bible to a random page and pointed to the first name there. Adam.
“Do you like it?”
“I’m glad that my struggle is of little importance to you, Sherlock. It was at your brother’s insistence that I was a troubled boy and therefore must be sent to an asylum!”
“May I come in? I wish to sit.”
“I could ask the same of you.”
Sherlock, dazed from the information, nodded. “Yes Ms. Donovan, our business concludes here.”
“Now, tell me, who is this dashing young man you’ve bought with you? I do hope that you are not looking to find me a young husband.”
Sherlock finished his treat and shoved the bag aside. He climbed onto John’s lap and began to pepper John’s neck in kisses. John stifled a moan. “You are quite active in the morning, Sherlock. However, I’m afraid that my surprise cannot wait any longer.”
They both nodded.
He reached over and began to fill out the paper that was in front of him. It mainly asked for the description of the stolen item, as well as a few questions regarding the time, place, and date of the theft. He finished quickly and rose to leave the building. As he neared the exit, he heard his name being called from the row of cells. He turned his head only to find none other than Anderson and Sally sitting behind the bars looking as miserable as ever. Anderson’s clothes were soiled, and although Thomas was not in close proximity with the two, the familiar sour scent of vomit invaded his nostrils.
With that, Sherlock left the room to throw on his coat again.
“Where is Sherlock?”
“I’ve not a clue as to what you are referring, John.”
-----
“Our dear Sebastian feels as if he is intruding upon our private life by staying. Also, we have nowhere for him to live and I should think that giving him our meager sofa is improper.”
“My love,” John began, his expression shifting into concern as he slid to his knees at the foot of Sherlock’s chair, “have I gone too far? All of those things I said were true but I fear I may have said too much too soon.” His warm, sturdy hands covered Sherlock’s, everything about him exuding a sense of care.
John only laughed quietly and replied, “Mind your step tomorrow.”
He looked down at his arm and grimaced at the burn he felt. Moriarty extinguished his cigarette on his arm as punishment for not releasing information regarding his whereabouts. He thought they would not be back until tonight, at the very least he would be able to see John and Sherlock once more without fear of being caught. He remembered the day after he was taken, Thomas and Moriarty seated in the carriage discussing Switzerland. He was finished with his business in London, Sherlock no doubt being such business, and he was ready to begin anew until something else caught his attention. Thomas sat there and listened with a solemn face and nodded once an inquiry was thrown his way. Thomas had not been the same since they left Baker Street with Sebastian. After his encounter with Sherlock, it changed him, made him more quiet. Sebastian did not care for Thomas.
“Holmes’ Manor. Please." Sherlock hopped in and immediately felt the movement of the cab, every step of the horses' hooves. He paid the coachman once they arrived and entered his home before the carriage left the front gate. He was immediately greeted by his maid, who gave him a warm smile. She took his jacket and his hat and was careful not to soak herself with his wet garments.
“John?”
John mulled it over in his mind and then grinned madly, laughing. He has wanted this for a long time then, why did he simply not ask sooner?
Mycroft’s study was as tidy as a human could possibly manage. Sherlock remembered the way Mycroft fussed over the tiniest speck of dust on his immaculate shelf. He always worked. Sherlock had to spend hours at a time coercing him to take a break, have a cup of tea, or even read the next chapter of his newest book. Mycroft had never listened to him, and seldom had intervals where he was inactive. He wondered if Mycroft ever slept in his bed or merely used it for his reading sessions. He laughed to himself, what a stubborn man. John walked over to the box that held things precious to Mycroft. Sherlock had already knew in his heart that he would not throw a single item away. With slow and careful steps, he made his way over to the desk. Everything remained as Mycroft had placed it and Sherlock was scared that even the slightest movement of anything on it would incur the wrath of Mycroft’s ghost. The first thing that caught his eye was a sheet of music.
There it was. How grateful Sherlock was that his back was turned to John. How shameful it was for Sherlock to blush at nearly every word John said. He only said two words - barely a sentence! He felt John’s hand on his own, how soft when they should be cold; hands that belonged to a dead man.
Sherlock smiled nervously and fiddled with his hands. Lestrade finished his tea and cleared his desk of any crumbs from his meal. He stood up to shake Sherlock’s hand, and the smile that the Inspector wore made Sherlock even more uneasy. Was he acting this way so that Sherlock would catch on that he was aware of his private details? Why was he being so hospitable towards, and Sherlock hated to even be associated with the word, a criminal?
Sherlock hoped that John would not see through his lie. Not as Mycroft had always done in his childhood.
He truly was the only one that would care if Sherlock died. He would never be able to move on with the pain. He could try to find a solution to his grief but he would always find his way back to that cold, dark, lonely living area played with thoughts about what once was. He could never put John through such turmoil, his love for him surpassing any desire to cause him pain. He wanted John to live a life of pure bliss and eternal happiness but he knew better. He knew that even the most content of people had to struggle. Sherlock could hardly stand to think of John’s reaction to hearing the news of Sherlock’s death. Maybe he would be caught in an unfortunate incident of a carriage that lost control, a freak accident, a fire, or the way he had planned during his adolescent years, suicide. It hurt to picture that, the way John’s knees would buckle, his eyes would water, obstructing his view of the letter stating the cause of death. He would try to be strong in the eyes of the postman, but behind closed doors he would cry and cry and spend every waking moment wishing that it was all an endless nightmare, and that he would awake to find his arms wrapped around the very person he ached for.
Sebastian did not speak or move and Moriarty’s face became grave. The hand with the cigar rose and hovered dangerously close to his skin. He could feel the heat singe the hair on his arm. He tried to steady his breathing. The trick was to make sure that he knew that you were not afraid.
“I do not want it to be forced, Sherlock. If we are to continue our activities, I would like it if you were happy doing so.”
Sherlock’s cheeks flushed. The man smirked and placed a hand on Sherlock’s wet back.
That was but only a few of the dozens of names that he suggested for his friend. Still the search was fruitless. Sherlock wanted to find a name for him, to spend every moment of the day finding excuses just to say it. He could hardly contain himself. He took a deep breath, and looked through The Bible for more.
Sally lost her nerve then, she looked over at her ailing lover and then back at Sherlock. “I’m sorry about your brother.”
“I’ll return, hopefully before you wake.”
“Sherlock, what did Thomas say to you? Before he jumped, he turned and spoke with you. What was it about?”
John frowned and rested a hand on Sebastian’s shoulder. “You must be dreadfully lonely.” Sebastian swallowed and shook his head. “Your face is a much welcome sight. I have missed you terribly.”
Just to clear any confusion up, the story takes place during 1895 because "It's always 1895"
Thomas cocked his head. “And do you not think that Sebastian would have come into your lives had we not ‘intruded’ as you call it? I find it unlikely. Tell me, had the thought ever crossed your mind to create him? To have another like you in the world? Another abomination?”
Thomas’ eyes lingered upon John’s hand on Sherlock’s. Sherlock nodded.
“So what are you planning to do? Admit me for insanity? Claim that I am mentally unfit to live in the public?”
“How...when did this happen, Sebastian?”
John blinked.
“I can hardly wait.”
John’s eyes widened.
“John? John are you alright?”
“If you prefer, we can do as such tonight.”
“Run along upstairs, and I shall fetch you and your friend tea and sandwiches.”
Sherlock’s smirk disappeared and Sally’s face turned smug at the victory. Anderson was escorted over to her by a policeman and she took her leave with him. Sherlock could faintly hear the bickering as they left the building. He sniffed and walked towards the Inspector’s desk. Thankfully, the man was already there and helping himself to a meager sandwich and a cup of tea. Sherlock cleared his throat and stared at the grey-haired cop until his attention was caught. After the third throat clearing Lestrade looked up at him with a mouth full of sandwich. His eyes widened at the sight of Sherlock and immediately he tried to swallow the food in his mouth, washing it down with tea.
Sherlock feigned offense and held his chest, “You are such a hurtful man.”
Sherlock hadn’t the energy to argue with her. He hadn’t slept, nor had he the will to come up with a quick enough response. He only closed the door and returned to the desk. He placed his notes next to the tray and read them over. He had an ominous feeling that something was amiss- and there was always something. It irritated Sherlock to no end. What did he forget? What was it that kept ease out of reach? Was it the idea of stealing body parts from corpses? Or was it the very idea of creating a man? He thought that maybe he should have created a woman, make her his wife, attempt to live amongst the other nobles. But what was normalcy anyway? Yet another social construct created by the privileged who thought that everyone who didn’t abide by their impossible criteria was to be treated with scorn and malice. Sherlock rolled his eyes. He was born into said privilege, yet he was subject to its bullying. He knew the others laughed at him behind his back, Lady Martin and her group were the first to ever do it within earshot. Sherlock realized that they only treated him with a modicum of respect because he was related to Mycroft, and no one dared upset him. That never stopped them from mocking Sherlock once they left the manor.
Sherlock placed his hand on John’s arm and began stroking it gently. “Fine. I will I aid you, since you are so incapable.”
“I do hope we have made the right decision bringing him here. I should think he would want to be near us at all hours.”
Sherlock shook his head. John had no right to berate himself for not stopping the kidnapping before it happened. He moved around again, in hopes that it would loosen the rope tied around his ankles. Whoever had tied the knots did their job well. Sherlock’s eyes darted back over to John’s.
“You do not have to do that, sir.” Sebastian refused to turn to face him. He was terrified, but knowing Moriarty, he already knew.
Sherlock closed the journal and put it inside the desk. He picked up his plate that once held a meager sandwich - evidence of his effort to prevent another bout of dreadful bedrest. The plate with the other soiled dishes, he left his floor of the flat and ascended up the stairs. He opened the door slowly, as if he might rouse the body lying in front of him. Sherlock managed to retrieve a cot for the body to lie on, something Mycroft kept for the rare occasions somebody other than Sherlock was to travel with him there. Sherlock’s full inventory of medical instruments was another gift from Mycroft. One of his connections, a man who was a doctor that retired ten years prior and was giving away his medical tools and Mycroft acquired them just for Sherlock.
“I’m not sure that I can. He may not be able to tell you or myself apart, but there is a chance that he...knows. He could have seen the stitches on my wrist when I moved to shake his hand. Though he may not understand the skill of speaking, he may be able to understand the tones of our voice. Or it could just be that we look upon him differently. You are human but him and I are...not completely so, perhaps he can tell that somehow.  Ah, I do not know what I am saying, ignore me.”
Sherlock had just finished his sentence when he heard Mrs. Hudson knocking at the door. She had come to appeal to his appetite once more. He hid his papers inside of his desk drawer and went to open the door. There she stood with a covered tray resting on her hands and a warm smile adorned her face.
They did not believe him. They saw, he had been stupid, so careless. They were going to report him to the police and he was going to be arrested. He would not last in prison, his mind would tear to pieces, he could not be away from John for such a long period of time.
Sherlock looked up at John and groaned. “Moriarty has no doubt returned from wherever he ventured. He would not leave Sebastian alone for long, he would not have asked for his creation had he not some use for him.”
“I...I could not...I am having trouble sleeping.”
Sherlock sighed and moved to sit up in the bed. He turned to look at John and pushed his leg. John smirked but did not budge, and Sherlock rolled his eyes as he slid out of the bed for the second time that day.
They were currently having a meal and Sherlock smiled as he watched John eat. The other man had wanted to practice his skills with the knife and fork so Sherlock allowed John to use the utensils on the egg that was cooked for him. He was careful with his cuts, not too small and not too large. Sherlock was so immensely proud of John, for his intelligence, cleverness, and for simply existing. Sherlock had come a long way from the first night he had begun the process of creating John and they had come so far already. Would he ever tell John the true nature of his birth? Would he realize that he was not like Sherlock? That he had scars and stitches in places that Sherlock did not?
“Boys, please escort Mr. Watson to the carriage. By force or without, it matters little to me, only take care to not kill him.”
“You mean to tell me that you have not heard of me?”
“And tell me, what do you know of normal? You know nothing! He harassed me,” He spoke with a harshness in his tone that set both John and Sherlock on edge, “The taunts, the beatings, he was a nasty boy who deserved his fate. He laughed at me for being Irish, so I stopped his laughing.”
“Atlantic Ocean, John. Spot on.”
“Eggs, ham, and beans with toast.”
Sherlock yawned and nuzzled his face into John’s back. His arms wrapped tighter around his waist. “It is his choice. I believe that this whole ordeal has relieved him of his separation anxiety. Also, we are not far from him, and I think that’s another comfort for him. He will do fine here.”
John chuckled and shrugged. “Such grim thoughts at this time of night.”
“Do you not feel the same?”
Sherlock laughed as he watched John’s face soften. He loved the feeling of John’s hand slowly gliding against his cheek.
“Mr. Holmes!”
John obliged, finding that spot unerringly the next few pushes in.
“What’re you doing, Sally? Why’ve we stopped now?”
She jumped when she laid eyes on him.
“I was present during your births, you know.”
“And what is the reason behind this statement?”
“Sherlock, this is the first time this week you’ve shown your face,” She tried to reason.
Immediately, John stopped struggling, but did not take his eyes off of the men who jumped Sherlock. The policeman released his hold on John.
Sebastian hummed and followed after him.
He could barely contain his smile as the memory flooded his mind. Mycroft had always believed in him, even when he did not believe in himself. He set the sheet down and fished through the box. He pulled out a collar, clearly belonging to a pet that they never had. Mycroft intended to take in the stray dog that Sherlock loved so dearly. The lame Irish Setter that was always found in the yard, playing with him. Sherlock named the dog Redbeard, and no matter how many times Sherlock was punished by Mrs. Hudson for playing with the canine, Sherlock had never listened. Then Mycroft presented the collar to him, black and decorated with small diamonds, but Redbeard had died. Put down by a man who suspected him of being rabid. Sherlock had witnessed the whole ordeal. He cried and he kicked and he shouted for Redbeard to wake up, for the evil man to be put in prison, to be put down himself.
“I like this.”
“Do you not want me to do this?”
“Come on Sherlock, budge over,” He whispered to himself, grinning amusedly.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
Sherlock was thankful for the short break he took stargazing. He rubbed his eyes, made his way back to his desk, and work began anew. He scarcely noticed the stars and the moon make way for the sun. He was nearly done by dawn, his sketch was complete, and his notes only needed a few modifications. He laughed to himself, ignoring the half crazed note to it. He was really going to do it - create his vitruvian man. He entertained himself with the idea that Leonardo was no doubt rolling in his grave, spewing curses and insults in Italian while Sherlock toiled away.
“Pardon, Thomas, John. John, Thomas.”
“Thank you.” He whispered.
Sherlock paused, but then started again, keeping his pumps in a rhythm. They were not sure for how long Sherlock kept at it until the man that they were trying to revive opened his eyes, revealing them to be a startling shade of blue. He sucked in the air around him as if it were going to be his last breath. After a moment, he shot up, screaming as loud as his lungs could allow him albeit his voice hoarse and scratchy.. He grabbed Sherlock’s hands that were still resting upon his chest and threw him to the other side of the attic. Disoriented and confused, the man got off the table and began staggering around, knocking things to the ground either by stumbling into them or sweeping them off surfaces out of sheer rage. The room, which was still wet from the rain and cluttered by the past few weeks of work, now was the complete sight of destruction.
“Are you unhappy?”
“We will find a way to stop him, of this you have my word, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock I’m...why must you fight me? How have I ‘come to be’?”
They all chanted it as they attacked him in front of his own home. The pain was beginning to be unbearable, and he was slowly losing consciousness. The taunts and the jeers suddenly turned into screams of pain. Sherlock opened his eyes, he could scarcely believe it, John pushed his current attacker off of him and returned the swings to the man’s face. The others who cornered him were groaning on the floor except for two of them who stood up and attempted to remove John from the man he was assaulting.
When he returned, he opened the door to find John, just as he expected, sitting at the table with two plates of food and reading the paper. When their eyes met, Sherlock was waiting for John to be cross with him. But there was something about John that prevented him from being angry at Sherlock unless he truly had done something wrong. John smiled and set his paper down.
“Oh Sherlock, what a wonderful sight you are.”
“Perhaps she felt as if you were not ready to read it, love.”
John smiled and smoothed the man’s collar back. “Hush, you now look the part of a respectable gentleman. I wonder where you learned such skills?”
“Have you a description of the victim?”
“S-Seb...bas…”
“You better be off now, Sherlock. I am sure John’s patience goes only so far.”
Sherlock smiled and set the plate on his night stand. “Good.” He pressed a kiss to John’s temple and joined him as they sat and ate in silence. They had said all they needed to on the train and now they just wanted each other’s presence and nothing else. The food was good enough, John supposed, but he had had better back at Baker Street. At the thought, John sighed. He missed their flat. He missed the security of it, and the intimacy of their bedroom. He set the plate down and moved back to lay down while Sherlock still sat on the edge of the bed finishing his food. John was surprised to see Sherlock eat as much as he did, he was probably just as hungry as John was. Sherlock set the plate down next to John’s half-eaten one and turned to face his sleepy love.
“You are quite welcome, John.”
Sebastian nodded, John knew now and he was forced to come clean. Perhaps this was not in violation of Sherlock’s command. John had come to the conclusion on his own, after all.
John had just left the dining room, he finished after Sherlock, but went ahead to get dressed. It was just Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock left. She already cleaned up the plates and the cups, exited the kitchen, and was wiping her hands on her apron.
The body he had assembled with such delicacy now he treated as if it were meaningless. Sherlock was grunting with his own exertion as he tugged the body down the steps, falling against the walls more than once as his feet missed the stairs, all the while the sound of thunder filled the narrow stairwell, amplified. By the time he reached the entrance of 221, Sherlock was breathless and bruised. He threw the front door open to the harsh roar of the rain as it came down in slants to instantly wet his person. He pulled the body through the door and dragged it across the cobblestone street to an alley. The downpour meant no sane person was on out on the streets but being seen was the last thing on Sherlock’s mind. With a final push of strength he heaved the body around, letting go to see it hit the wall and slump down against the ground. He felt compelled to laugh when he observed that the creature was still intact but when he felt a sob rise to his throat he locked his jaw and adopted a countenance he would uphold for the rest of his life.
“I wonder if you are among the stars, brother dear.”
Sherlock’s lips parted to take in a wet and ragged breath. The tears had spilled unbidden, every facet of Sherlock’s great mind focusing on John’s words. He knew they were truthful and even if the same doubts were to plague him again tomorrow, in this moment, Sherlock knew John really loved him. As John brushed the tears away, Sherlock could only think of one thing to do. He leaned in.
“What am I, Sherlock?” John’s tone became harder at Sherlock’s reluctance to answer his inquiries. The truth might not have been uncovered but John knew now that something was very wrong. Sherlock was keeping something from him.
“Nowhere, I need air, sir.”
John turned around.
Also, this chapter is mostly smut but we've constructed it so that if that's not your thing, you can skip it without really missing much. There will be one more chapter after this. We're almost there!
Sherlock pulled away first, panting deeply as his breath had been taken by John. His lips were swollen from the crushing kiss and the cut at the corner throbbed but with a pain he could ignore. John had never kissed anyone before, how he become so skilled?
“And why does he resonate in your brain, Lestrade?”
“Have you?”
They arrived in Switzerland towards the afternoon and went straight to their room. Thankfully Sherlock was able to get them a room with two single beds on either side of the room. They spent the remainder of the day getting settled in and by the time they were finished, the two were exhausted from the length of journey and from unpacking. John sank into the bed with his shirt half undone. He wanted to fall asleep entirely but Sherlock had not yet returned with dinner and he did not want to sleep on an empty stomach. Just as he moved to take his shirt off completely, Sherlock opened the door and closed it swiftly as he saw John’s bare chest.
“Water.”
“Leave my house at once!”
“It is, Sherlock. I had never intended for this to happen, I only wanted to see you again, and John. He caught me whilst I was leaving. It is all my fault,” Sebastian hung his head and his voice became shaky. Sherlock frowned, had he been given more time, Sebastian would not still retain his child-like mind, perhaps he would have been an equal to himself, or maybe even smarter than the both of them combined. He echoed the words that he heard John say so many times before. Sebastian was little more than a child mentally, and that was the fault of Moriarty and himself.
John slid the sleeve off of Sherlock’s arm and then draped it over the hook.
“Splendid! Tell me, what does this companion look like?”
It was his voice. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief. He was correct and John was still alive. Moriarty would have had hell to pay if John’s life had been taken. He tried to move around but his legs were also tied to the chair. Surely John was in the same predicament as well.
---------
John blushed and immediately moved toward the two accompanying bowls of mashed potatoes and vegetables. Sherlock placed a hand on top of John’s.
“In your bed?”
Did he deserve John? After all that he had put John through, did he actually think that John would still be there, ready to accept him with open arms? He had hurt him, had played with his heart, how could one be so easily forgiven after committing such a grave crime? John was kind, yes, but even the kindest people had their limits. What would he even say? He was awful at apologizing, even if he truly meant it. He would have to spend the whole walk home searching for the right words and piecing together something that would earn John’s forgiveness. If he was not able to continue his relationship with John, he could at least learn to live with him if they maintained a friendship.
John shrugged and stood up to take his seat on the bed next to Sherlock.
John shrank back into his chair.
John opened his mouth to respond but Sebastian replied, “His surly demeanor holds no candle to Moriarty.” It was a joke, but John found no humor in it, and from the way the humor did not reach Sebastian’s eyes, neither did he.
John nodded.
“My appetite has left me,” He gently pushed the plate away and rose from his seat. “My apologies for wasting such a lovely meal. I am sure you went through great pains to make it. I shall retire to my bedroom now.”
“Hear my words, Jeanette, tell Mrs. Hudson that I am not be disturbed during my time at Baker Street unless there is a dire need. Do you understand?”
“I have wanted you like this for so long now, Sherlock,” John whispered, burying his fingers in the man’s curls to bring him in for another kiss.
-------
The funeral ended shortly after the coffin was buried, and all the guests made their way to the church where the wake was previously held. Sherlock took his seat on the second pew from the front. He stared at nothing while the other guests stood three rows behind him and chattered away as if they were at a banquet and not a funeral. Sherlock shivered from the rain that had him completely drenched. He made no move to stand in leave.
Sherlock’s hand flew to his mouth, so that he could bite into the sandwich that rested in his hand. He shook his head and gave a sheepish smile.  John grinned and took another bite of his.
John raked his eyes down Sherlock’s chest to the darkened jut of his erection between them. Those gorgeous long legs were spreading wider for him and his hunger deepened to touch Sherlock more, to learn his body. He could never know Sherlock’s body like Sherlock knew his own, but he could damn well try.
“I do hope, my dear John, that you did not plan on abandoning me.”
Sherlock tried to ignore the crestfallen expression on John’s face.
“I regret leaving the fire in the flat.”
“It’ll be alright, John. I’ll get you out of this yet.”
Sherlock did not gift him with a response. He placed both hands on the cold chest and began to pump. John watched as Sherlock did this.
“Enlighten me.”
“I should think that it will not be completed in less than a fortnight, as well. We will sleep and continue our work in the morning.”
“I am retiring for the night, I shall see you in the morning?”
“That’s quite alright, John.”
“I did no such thing. My anger was directed towards myself and I could not handle the failure that was my life.”
“Is what, Sebastian?”
Sherlock moved towards the stairs and watched carefully as Lestrade inched closer to him with every step he took.
Sherlock’s false smirk turned sympathetic at Sally’s condolences. She let out a breath and said, “Right. Banville wrote us a letter a few days back. Says he’s with a man named Moriarty in Switzerland, on some sort of business.”
“How did he die?”
“I jest, Sherlock.”
Sherlock climbed into the coach and faced her again.
“I am afraid that is my own affair, Inspector. Alas, you’ve no reason to worry I have not been up to illegal acts, if that was what you are wondering.”
Similarly, Sherlock was speechless from the brand new pleasure. His back was arched, head tossed back. The stretch just touched on the border of discomfort but John had taken his time opening him up so that feeling was quickly replaced by pleasure.
That night, he was racing around the room, packing his clothes and everything else that he would need. He was already dressed in a simple white shirt and black trousers with shoes to match. The outfit itself was not one of his best however it was one he would not miss should it be ruined by mud, rain, or even tears. He emerged from his room and shut the door quietly. Mrs. Hudson was in her quarters, preparing herself for sleep no doubt. There was only one other maid that was up at the hour. Jeanette, he thinks her name was. He would have to give her the order to fetch a coachman so that when he returned he would be able to leave for Baker Street. He found her rearranging a vase of flowers. Why she never retired with the others was beyond him.
Since there were no clothes for his creation, Sherlock gave him his silk red dressing gown. His hair was wet, but Sherlock could not get over how relieved he was to be able to touch him, to feel the dripping locks. To have him wholly.
“Do you know what it was like? To be locked away in an asylum as a child?” Moriarty and Sherlock were now at the bottom of the falls, the roar of the water nearly overpowering his voice. Sherlock’s hands were behind his back and his face unreadable.
The next day, Sherlock was sitting in the living area awaiting John’s emergence from the room. They were to take a walk today, at John’s behest. Sherlock took care to wear his top hat during their outing so that no one would be able to see the marks on his face as easily. Sherlock opened his watch.
. Mycroft gifted him with the sheet when Sherlock first began to play the violin. As he expected, he mastered the instrument just under a year. It was on his twelfth birthday that Mycroft bought it for him.
“Why Mycroft?” He asked. “Out of all the men in the world, why would it rob me of Mycroft?”
He led Sherlock towards the back of the store, reserved for men who were too tall, too heavy, or too short. John was not the average height of a man, Sherlock paid little attention to that. The clerk held his hand underneath the various suits that were hanging up, as well as folded on tables and showcases.
“Inspector.” Was Sherlock’s parting word. He was led by John back to their flat. Sherlock frowned; John’s gift would have to wait, sadly.
Anderson’s eyes lit with fury as he recounted the moments after the assault. Curse that blond man, he thought.
Sebastian nodded. “I have never borne ill-will towards him, John. It was he who could not stand the sight of me.”
“Come, I’ll assist you.”
John resolved to writing soon after Sherlock’s departure. He was nearly done with his recordings once he heard knocking at the door. Immediately John closed the journal and made his way towards it, hoping that it was Sherlock so that they might finally clear the air between them.
He would want him to eat something, a full meal. Sherlock was going to wither away if he continued to lay in bed and watch the rain fall. One drop...two...three....
John’s mouth scrunched up as he stared down at the book in front of him. Sherlock had started him off with children’s books first, such as Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks, and Sleeping Beauty. To his delight, John caught on very quickly and was able to read every word in those books. Sherlock eventually decided to expand his horizons, and knowledge of things that were not written for a child’s amusement, although John became sad when reading The Little Mermaid. He did not understand why she did not have a happy ending, as all of the other characters did. It was then that Sherlock told him that happiness is not a feeling that everyone can come by, and The Little Mermaid was one such example. John did not like the answer to his question and told Sherlock that he did not wish to read such somber tales anymore. Sherlock agreed and hid the book from John’s line of sight. This happened some weeks ago.
“The Case of the Abominable Bride.”
The soft sound of Sherlock’s chuckle caught John’s attention. The way Sherlock seemed so calm, so relaxed around this woman, John decided that maybe he could come to feel the same way about her as well. He followed Sherlock up the stairs, leaving Mrs. Hudson behind with Sherlock’s coat draped over her arms.
Sherlock’s mother died first. She caught pneumonia, weakness growing until she became bed-ridden. The weather was harsh during her last days, whatever chance she had for recovery ruined thanks to the winter’s cold air. Sherlock didn’t remember crying when she died. He simply stared and admired how peaceful she looked. Morbid tendencies developing before he’d even realized.
“He’s something of a wallflower. Sir Mycroft used to bring him along to gatherings and balls and such, but all he did was sit and watch. He does say rather disconcerting things, I can only imagine that Sir Mycroft was simply embarrassed of him and so stopped bringing him all together. I’ve had the misfortune of meeting him on one occasion.”
Sebastian gulped.
John opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by another.
“Sherlock!”
“Right, I’ve complaints of noise coming from your flat. 221B is it?”
He had forgotten that John was even there. He meant to hide his suffering from him, but John had borne witness to it; Sherlock’s destructive behavior.
“Did he relay to you anything else?”
“There you are.” His eyes honed in on a brown suit on display. The ensemble went together splendidly; the shoes were burgundy, and the tie a dark plaid color. The suit itself was wool, and a lovely shade of brown, topped off with a bowler hat of the same color. Sherlock had no doubt in his mind that John would look incredibly handsome in it. He called for the clerk who rushed back over to him.
Sherlock shook his head, unable to find the words for it.
“No, no John that is not it at all.”
Sherlock and John arrived at the flat during the early afternoon. John lugged their bags back into the upstairs while Sherlock took care of paying the coachman. When they opened the door, immediately John dropped the luggage and laughed. Sherlock took over John’s task and moved them over to the side so that neither of them would trip over the large bags.
Sherlock clenched his fist and bit his lower lip. He had to attend to John, that was his first priority at the moment. He walked up the stairs to the door.
Sherlock cocked his head.
“You would think that, coming from a lineage of geniuses, he would have had the sense to bring an umbrella! Look at him, he resembles that of a stray mutt.”
They were seated in front of the tombstone for what felt like an eternity. Sherlock had not said a word and John feared that anything he said would only worsen the situation. It had pained him to see Sherlock hurt this way, and Sherlock had wished that John would not have to see him in his current state.
“You needn’t tire yourself waiting for me.”
The few days that passed after their return home were mostly spent sleeping and resting in quiet. What happened in Switzerland, though the outcome had been a miracle, left them tired and utterly thankful that they both were alive and together. Perhaps Moriarty deserved death for all that he had done, but to witness it, to play a role in causing it, inevitably had an effect on one’s person. In comparison then, the valiant death of Sir Banville was even harder to process.
“Oh John, my John...who has done this to you?”
“You would do this for me?”
He felt the familiar grasp on his wrist. How could he imagine such a realistic hallucination? The skin as smooth as his own, almost unnaturally so. His hand, warm to the touch. The stitching on his wrist in the same fashion as his own sutures. Was Sebastian truly here? Was this not a cruel trick?
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is the matter? Why are you crying?”
They had done their fair share of blushing for the day. John was only recovering from his most recent one, and Sherlock had not recovered from his own yet. He was not over the warm presence of John, he was not getting used to waking up and finding John sitting at the table or on the couch. He could not force his brain to understand that he was no longer alone, that he had John now. His hand snaked his way over to John’s own. A finger rested on the top of the tan hand, followed by another, until he was resting his hand on top of John’s. At first he smiled, feeling the smooth skin beneath his own, elated to be able to touch John in such a way that gladdened his heart. Until he saw the smiling face of the waiter flash in his mind.
“No, nothing pressing I’m afraid. I thought that I’d stop off and check on you. The flat is dreadfully boring seeing as how John is still asleep.”
Sebastian smiled and tears formed in his eyes as he nodded.
Sebastian smiled and moved back on the seat, John couldn’t help but stare at the two other men in the carriage and think about their survival that day, and the sacrifice of one Thomas Banville.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment. He had said too much already, John was now pushing him further into embarrassment.
“I appreciate the sentiment, Mr. Holmes, but if there is nothing else…”
Sebastian nodded. He was terrified, but John needed him, and with the man he was facing, Sherlock would need them both. He raced to the door with John to locate Sherlock and Moriarty without a thought more.
“Sebastian, what are you talking about? Moriarty is hurting you?”
As much as he wanted to believe himself, Sherlock knew better. His eyes never deceived him.
John stared at him. Sherlock grabbed his knife and fork and began to cut into the egg.
“I shall leave you to your thoughts, it is clear that you are in no mood to hold conversation with me.”
She walked over to the kitchen and Sebastian followed behind her. John and Sherlock looked at each other and headed upstairs to prepare for dinner.
Sherlock’s mouth formed into the faintest of smiles at John’s words. He folded his hands on the table and stared into John’s eyes - eyes he could lose himself in. They were gentle, compassionate, and they were beautiful.
“You talk as if we were wrong in turning you in.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and pressed the cold leather to his mouth. He saw the way John’s cheeks tinged from the sudden contact.
“John.”
“It is quite alright, I did not mind one bit.”
With a surge of anger that Sebastian did not see, Sherlock gently pushed the sleeve down and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Go to the inn, I will see to Moriarty and then we shall take leave of this place. You, John, and I. Do you understand?”
“Is something wrong, Sebastian?”
“Romeo? It is quite the romantic name. Ro-me-oh.”
“Not a problem at all, have good day, Mr. Holmes.”
There was a knock at the door and John smiled, as he approached it. He swung it open, half expecting Sherlock to be there, but it was Sebastian.
He smacked his right cheek, prompting a jolt from John’s body. It worked, but it did not bring Sherlock joy to inflict more pain upon him. He smacked the other cheek, and then the right one again until John’s head shot up as if waking from a nightmare. His chest rose and fell with each sharp inhale of breath and his eyes looked bewildered until they landed on Sherlock’s smiling face. Letting out a sigh of relief he planted a crushing kiss to John’s lips.
“John, John! Can you hear me?”
Mycroft said that one night after Sherlock came home a bruised and bloodied mess. He had cried when Mycroft inquired about his state, and to his surprise, he was given a hug and those words were whispered into his ear as if it were a secret between the two. He took Sherlock to the kitchen and prepared him hot chocolate, and even let Sherlock sleep in the bed with him. He tried to make him feel better, but he was ill-equipped when it came to emotion. Sherlock learned later on that it was the subtle things that Mycroft did for him showed that he cared. What would he say now? That man, Anderson, attacked Sherlock because they thought he became aroused by the sight of putrid, rotting bodies. They called him a freak, someone who did not deserve respect, a person to be ostracized by everyone else simply because they were not normal. He hated the very word. It was so cruel, so vile, and to be labeled such a thing incensed Sherlock. Though anger gave way to sadness very shortly, and so there Sherlock sat, struggling to hold back the bitter tears upon realizing that nobody would think of Sherlock as anything but a freak. As a child, he learned to ignore the taunt because children are vicious to people who are different. The whole world seemed to be. Then, as the years passed, the word went from shouts to whispers. It was the thing that everyone murmured whenever Sherlock was around. The way the men bent their heads and chuckled whenever he walked into the room, or the hushed voices of the women who stared at him during social events. It did not take him long to figure out what they gossiped about. It was him; The Freak, Mycroft’s Queer Younger Brother, The Strange One, or one of the mild ones he’d been given, Him. Mycroft had tried to distract him from it by dragging him around to meet some of the more esteemed guests of the party but Sherlock only looked like the peculiar sibling that followed his brother everywhere.
Sherlock immediately regretted speaking of Sebastian. It was not so long ago that the mention or implication of him could be easily addressed. John missed him terribly, and Sherlock found himself at odds regarding his absence. He could admit that there was a wholeness to their home with Sebastian, and it was not that he was not whole with John, there was not a word to describe the level of love and friendship that Sherlock had with John. With Sebastian, however, perhaps it was at how happy John was when he was with the two of them. The very thought of seeing John happy was enough for Sherlock. He had the most dazzling of smiles. No such expression was worn on the man’s face in this instance. John sank into the chair and his eyes looked heavy and darker than normal.
John imitated Sherlock’s disapproving head shake. Sherlock could hear John’s soft attempt at reiterating the word “Not”. Sherlock was never a man of infinite patience, but for John, he would wait as long as was necessary.
The innkeeper smiled at John as he walked out. The first thing that took John by surprise was the sunshine beaming down on him. London did not have this much sunlight, when the sun shone at all. There were greens and yellows so vibrant, John could hardly believe it. Perhaps Sherlock was right - they had needed this holiday, if it was truly a holiday and nothing more. John put his hand in his pockets. What underlying motive could Sherlock have for bringing them here? What business did Sherlock have in Switzerland of all places? If only they would have taken holiday in France, where they could at least be public with their love with no incident.
“I hadn’t a worry, I’ve only come to do my job. Tell me, before I leave, how is your face?”
Sherlock swallowed hard. He refused to look her in the eye after seeing her hurt expression.
“I am fine, love.” John smiled at him.
Lestrade tipped his hat and turned to walk away only to stop again and say, “Mr. Holmes, if there is anything the matter there is no shame in asking for aid.”
“Where have you been, Mr. Holmes? And do not tell me you were out to fetch the paper.”
“Well, we can’t have that, now can we?” Sebastian swallowed hard. Moriarty knelt down to be eye level. He rested a hand on Sebastian’s wrist and slowly rolled up the sleeve to expose his arm. “Well, my darling Sebastian, let us make a deal. I finish your drink and you tell me where you were.”
Sherlock groaned. He truly was the epitome of the wretched patient. John felt badly for Sherlock - How could he not? - but then he had warned Sherlock repeatedly of the consequences that would befall him if he did not manage his body better. If Sherlock did not get well before the end of the week, then he would send for a doctor even if Sherlock wished against it. The man was working himself to the very extremes of fatigue, dehydration, and malnutrition so this was a price he would have to pay. John found supplies to clean the mess on the floor, thankful that Sherlock hadn’t eaten anything or else it would be much harder to remove. At this point, Sherlock had fallen asleep again. John wondered if he should join Sherlock in his nap, or leave him by himself while he tended to the dormant body upstairs. He shook his head. He was no better than Sherlock, he could not keep his mind off of the creation. The body was complete, John saw to the retrieval of the limbs due to Sherlock’s poor health and refusal to step anywhere near a cemetery. Sherlock himself mustered the courage to piece the limbs together while John watched slightly horrified and slightly intrigued.
More awkward silence. How was he going to do this?
“The name is Jim Moriarty, hello.”
John had an opinion on the matter; Sherlock saw the way his eyes darted up towards his own and then back to his wrist as quickly as they met his. Sherlock cocked his head.
Sherlock sucked in a breath. The man would not dare. He already thought that Lestrade had found out, and it nearly drove him mad. If Moriarty truly did something so cruel as that, he would send Sherlock to a fate worse than death.
Sherlock sniffled. He did not know whether to smile and laugh or crumple and sob harder.
Thomas shook his head and pressed a finger to his mouth in an attempt to shush the hysterical man.
Sherlock nodded frantically, fumbling with the buttons at the distraction. “I as well. I know I refused you those months ago but I- I was only afraid.”
“Very good, John. Not.”
“Break it up!”
Sherlock had half a mind to continue to the laboratory and complete the last set of notes they needed before they could begin the actual construction of the body. He was thankful for John’s help, it would surely take longer had he done it on his own. However, the vacant spot on the bed looked enticing to the weary man now. He should not be such a fool to pick the lab but he could never resist John, and as of right now, he certainly could not resist sleep. With a pout on his face he returned to his side of the bed and settled in. He turned his back to John but this did not stop the other man from wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist and pressing his cheek against his neck.
“...Will he die, John?” Sebastian’s voice was soft and shaky, and it broke John’s heart into a million pieces. He was a grown man physically, but he betrayed that appearance by sounding like a frightened child. He only sighed and pulled the terrified man into an embrace. It probably did little to comfort him.
“You will do no such thing, Holmes. Bed, I’ve read that sleep is good for the body and good is what your body needs.”
“You are not a creature, John. Do not ever refer to yourself as such. You are my John, you are my saving grace, my best and only friend. You are the most kind and wise man to have ever graced my presence and I do not want you out of my life. Not now. Not ever.”
Sebastian stared at his feet as he shook his head. “You know that I do not like to drink. It made me...it was not a pleasant feeling, sir.”
“I am sorry, Sherlock. You’ll pardon me, I suppose this whole ordeal does not sit well with me. I do not wish to speak on this anymore for fear I will cause a disagreement between us both. I do not wish for there to be any bad blood between us, I think we have had our fair share of it.”
The moonlight shone through the window as the two slept, well, as John slept. Sherlock was nestled against John’s chest, listening to the sound of his heart and loving every soft thump that it made. John was more exhausted than Sherlock had ever seen him be before, but they had begun their progress on Moriarty’s creation with only a few notes and sketches to show for it.
They pressed foreheads, and later they found themselves resting their heads on the other’s shoulder, arms wrapped around the other’s waist. They were tired, but they were together and that was enough, was it not? Sherlock’s eyes watered at the thought. John’s utter devotion to him was heartwarming and motivating, but he would not take him to encounter Moriarty, he simply could not do so.
Sherlock watched with wide eyes as the blood-curdling screams died down to whimpers. The man’s eyes darted around the lab and finally landed upon Sherlock. Sherlock rose to his feet, favouring his left wrist. It was not broken, as he was able to move it, but perhaps it was sprained, or bruised. He watched as John restrained the man, only letting go once he was sure that nothing else would happen.
John pressed a kiss on the top of Sherlock’s curls, and also to the crest of his cheekbone. Sherlock smiled to himself at the warmth that John exuded. He had always wondered what it felt like to be held like this. To have someone be so intimate with him, and by choice, it made Sherlock tear up at the thought.
And he was a fool to be so devoted to Sherlock. He could barely work up the nerve to even kiss him, let alone share a bed with him in the privacy of their home. Mycroft had never explained such things to him as a child. He did not understand why people fell in love, why they wanted to marry and start families. Sherlock did not understand what love was, and what it meant to be in love. Mycroft himself never married, hardly the scandal since most of the nobles knew of his surly demeanor and the fact that he was tasked with ensuring the wellbeing of Britain. Unlike himself, Mycroft had reasons for remaining unmarried. Sherlock had only one reason; he was simply not loved enough to be considered for marriage. Suppose he did marry, what would his wife think of him? Would she think him insane? Would she spend every waking moment reminding him that she did not love him, that he was not normal? Would she even want to be around him long enough for a child to be conceived? The answer was no, Sherlock would never find a soul in the world that loved him for him.
“Oh dear. You have no need to fear, I am very sorry if I have planted...troubling memories in your mind from the time we shared upstairs previously. I was startled, and I might further add that you were as well.”
For so long Sherlock had tried to keep his desires under lock and key. Even when the perfect opportunity with the perfect man had established itself, Moriarty kept him from realizing his dreams. Now, free to really be with John in every sense without those restraints, Sherlock was hesitant. No part of his life had come without their trials and along the way, many people had come to hate him. Despite John proving himself a steady support as a friend and lover through all these months, that dark part of Sherlock’s mind would not quiet. You will ruin this. Do not be greedy. It’s only a matter of time.
Sherlock left, drenched and cold, empty. He entered 221 and went directly to his bedroom, stripping himself of his clothes and climbing under the sheets. The exhaustion that filled him was of a different breed entirely - a beckoning to a black void where absolutely nothing awaited him. Sherlock accepted the invitation wholeheartedly. He could think of nothing worse than waking in the morning to the dread of his existence. He would sleep for hours, days, years, and waste away until there was nothing left of him to offer a world he never belonged in. Sherlock shut his eyes and he was asleep.
“We ain’t scared of him.” Anderson said. Sally nodded.
John went over to Sherlock and helped him up. Sherlock scooped the box up from the ground as he stood. The officer looked back at them.
“In all the time that we have spent in this bath, you have not once made any indication to want...more.”
“Ah yes, quite the common name. What is it?”
Comments and Kudos are welcome!
“Oh? And tell me monster, who are your parents? Your family? Whose womb were you born from?”
“It all depends on the heartlessness of the courts, you’ve seen what they’ve done to Wilde, haven’t you? Sentenced to hard labor, that’s considered a light punishment in regard to the law he broke. It is Gross Indecency, John.”  He spoke with a soft harshness, and from the tone alone John could see how severe their situation is. “Which would you prefer, hm? Would you want to ingest medication that drastically changes your hormones so that you might ‘suppress’ your sexual urges? Or if that seems unappealing to you, why not simply go to jail and serve your sentence there, for however long that may be. Or if that does not suit you, there is always the very convenient alternative of  execution! John, listen to me when I tell you that there is no worse crime than to be a homosexual in these trying times. There are cases of rape that were not handled as severely as they would us should the police ever hear news of our being together!”
“Why does this concern you?”
Sherlock blushed and shook his head.
The smaller man surged forward, grabbing at Sherlock’s hips and urging him back until the back of the man’s knees hit the edge of the bed. Obligingly, Sherlock sat down and edged backwards, dropping the tin onto the sheets as John climbed over top of him. One of his legs was between Sherlock’s, his knee pushing right up into the man’s groin.
Sherlock pushed the yolk of the egg about with his fork. A few bites would suffice, and then he’d return to his room for the remainder of the day.
“Sebastian, pray tell, is this all?”
“Whatever possessed you to take the boy from the institution in the first place is for you to deal with alone. You have made your grave, now you must lie in it.”
“You will get on fine without her, Sherlock. You have me, and I am forever grateful to have you.”
He frowned when he heard his companion groan, unaware that John had begun to slumber. Sherlock hated to rouse him when he was tired but this was of the highest import. He made his way toward the stairs so he could open the windows, he had to make sure that the lightning found its way to the rods. This had to work, the creation had to wake up.
Sherlock felt disappointment at the reply. Why would he be disappointed? He wanted John to say that, as much as he wished that John would desire something else.
Sebastian’s hand went to his other arm and tugged on the sleeve.
Sherlock’s heart stopped beating altogether. There was a rip in John’s shirt, a rip right on top of the stitches Sherlock spent days sewing on John’s body.
“Perhaps you were able to wake due to your shock being directly from the storm with no means of conduction. Our friend here does not have the privilege to follow in your footsteps. We must perform compressions of the heart upon him, John!”
---------
“How does he fare?”
John beamed at being praised by Sherlock, and Sherlock was more than happy to compliment him on his intelligence. He noticed how hard John worked, he would even catch John reading before he retired to bed. How proud he was. Sherlock headed into the kitchen and returned with a sandwich, cut in halves. He had noticed that it was nearly three in the afternoon, meaning they missed lunch and breakfast altogether. He was not sure if John was hungry, if he even understood what hunger felt like. He smiled once he saw John’s face light up at the sight of their lunch on the table. Sherlock handed John one half, and then took his own seat in front of his half. He always waited until John ate first because he wanted to see John’s face when he took the first bite. Sherlock had not made anything too elegant, it was usually sandwiches or eggs. John preferred eggs and toast with strawberry jam but whatever Sherlock placed in front of him, he was more than happy to devour. John’s eyes closed and the only noise in the flat was John’s chewing. Sherlock chuckled and took a bite.
What use would the madman have for such a person? If John was anything to go by, then this creation would possibly be even gentler, more fragile, than John had been on the night of their meeting. Well, Sherlock did throw a vase at him, and it did little more than stun him. There was also the possibility that this one would not come to life, even John was nothing short of a miracle. He kissed the warm chest and rested a hand on John’s soft arm as he gently stroked the skin. John had been his rock during this process. Although it may have seemed like nothing to an outsider, they had made great progress in the time they had spent working on the project. It was John that would rouse Sherlock from his slumber in that uncomfortable chair in the laboratory. It was John that forced the breaks for food and baths where he would then do a remarkable job washing Sherlock’s hair. Today, however, it had been Sherlock who dragged John to their room because the poor man could not keep his eyes open for a moment longer. He placed a gentle kiss onto John’s lips and the man did not even stir.
John stared at Sherlock with a blank expression, which then gave way to a small smile and a nod. Sebastian hugged them both again and made a hasty exit from the inn. John shut the door and sank to the bed looking as tired as ever. “He said Moriarty left him all by his lonesome. He is not a person to be left in isolation, Sherlock. He needs to be around people….he does not know how to be alone…”
“Is something the matter? You’ve been rather dejected since our departure from the manor. Did you wish to stay longer?”
Sherlock did not recall ever finishing the short story, he didn’t remember falling asleep on the floor with John. What he did remember was waking up the next morning. There was no sun, as it was covered by the clouds. His limbs ached, and the fire was out, the wood left. The book was flipped over so that the pages were smothered by the chilled wood that had been his bed for the night. He stretched and sat up, John was sprawled across the floor adjacent from Sherlock. Sherlock smiled and ran a hand through John’s hair. So soft, he thought, how perfect he was. He stood up and walked into the kitchen. He did not have the level of culinary prowess as Mrs. Hudson but he was able to cook eggs and beans on toast with exceptional skill. He made a plate for John as well.
With that, John exited the room donned in the outfit that Sherlock had been dying to see him wear. He looked ravishing. The brown brought out the golden hue in his hair and the blue in his eyes. He was simply stunning and incredibly handsome in the suit. Sherlock grinned and rose from the couch.  All that needed to be done was the tie, the jacket, and the hat. Sherlock finished his ensemble with the tie and he buttoned up John’s jacket before they left the flat together. Baker Street was always crowded this time of day. An hour when everyone was working or heading toward their places of employment. Everyone except John and Sherlock, that was.
Sherlock cringed. He had not meant to inflict any harm upon John. That night he had been frightened and distraught over the failure of his venture. John awakening, mobile, alive, was that last thing he had expected.
“I’ve not a clue as to how we should proceed in the manor, therefore I think it best that we carry out your idea.”
Sherlock was en route to the nearest clothing store. He did not want John to look like a street urchin, he was with Sherlock, and Sherlock Holmes does not tolerate unfashionable clothes. Sherlock smiled, Mycroft would be proud. It took the driver nearly ten minutes to reach their destination. Sherlock paid a generous amount, and walked into the shop to find a suitable outfit for John, as well as a few shirts, trousers, socks, pants, and shoes. The clerk walked over to Sherlock with a smug smile spread across his face.
To be honest, John had not even thought of that. He was used to being around Sherlock every hour of the day, and, before his departure, Sebastian. Sherlock was right in his inquiry. Would he be able to be in such an open space? Sure he hailed from London, which was a densely populated area, but he had not been subject to its crowds for very long. As long as he had Sherlock, he supposed, he would be able to get by.
“That is the reason they attacked you? They spotted you in the cemetery and while they incorrectly assumed your goings on, they were not far from the truth. They remembered your face from all that time ago.”
Moriarty’s hand fell from John’s shoulder. Sherlock sunk into the chair, his eyes traveled away from John’s pain-filled ones.
“Anderson? How did you find yourself here?”
Lestrade did not look the least bit interested in hearing of this man’s monetary loss, but one look at the man told him that the issue would not be so easily swept aside. He quirked a brow for him for continue.
Sherlock resolved to look away and focus on the task at hand. He was ashamed of himself to think of touching another man in such a ghastly way. If he had, he imagined the police swarming into the flat and whisking him away for gross indecency. Sherlock covered the lower body with a blanket. His urge remain as he worked but he focused his attention on the man’s face. The sight of which brought a soft smile to Sherlock’s lips.
The smaller man set aside his journal and pen, resting his hands on the arms of his chair, a matching smirk on his lips. “How your lips look around your pipe - so plush and elegant. How they move as you ease the smoke into the air. How the warmth of the flat has pinkened your cheeks and how the firelight accentuates your cheekbones. All of that is remarkable to me, as if I am looking upon art. Shall I continue?”
--------
“Don’t worry, I’ll get you out of this yet.”
The woman scoffed her expression skeptical.
If Sherlock were to be granted one wish, he would wish that they could remain that way for forever and a day.
“He is of short stature, about five foot and six inches in height. Not quite heavy but robust in size, broad-shoulders, slight curve of the stomach, strong legs, long feet. Narrow-hips…”
“Only to assess the damage.”
He rolled over and faced the bright moon. There would be no sleep for him tonight, and John would surely berate him in the morning for not getting his proper eight hours, but he simply could not will himself to slumber. With a sigh, he heaved himself out of bed and walked around it to exit the room when he felt John’s hand grasp his thin wrist before he could be out of arm's reach. Sherlock turned his head to find John still half-asleep, staring up at him with glazed eyes and something resembling a frown.
Sherlock nodded but he could not bear to stay any longer. He had to return home.
“And how simply perfect it is that you have found them! Now, you will take me to them.”
“Switzerland.”
----------
John’s brows furrowed. “Holiday?”
One of them grabbed him from behind and he tried to shake them off but only succeeded in breaking some of the china in the kitchen. The other man, the one with the injured nose, came at him with a blunt object. The first strike did little else other than disorienting him.
Sherlock was dripping onto his stomach and he knew he was getting dangerously close to reaching climax. “Now, please, John! Enter me, make me yours, fill me up.”
“My condolences for your loss.”
“What are you implying?”
“We’ve had a rough time here at Baker Street, and I do not wish to be at the manor quite yet. Would you agree to leaving the country with me?”
John gave a poor excuse of a smile and Sherlock frowned. “I do hate to see you so troubled. This was not my intention.”
John shook his head and took the robe from him. He had wanted to let Sherlock try to establish a bond but none seemed forthcoming.
“Ah, that is too bad.”
John shook his head, “Again, this is for you to decide after you take us to Sherlock. If there is any good in you left you will do this.”
“Do forgive me then for announcing my excitement for being back in the one place I can truly call my home!”
John’s hand moved down to Sherlock’s shoulder and he gripped it lightly.
Sherlock spent the rest of the day working on the body. He finished attaching the head and frowned as he realized that he would have to dress his friend with high collars and scarves so that no one would remark upon his scars. All he had left was to finish was the innards of the body and his work would be complete at last. He did not retire for sleep until four in the morning, Sherlock barely made it to the bed, instantly falling asleep to dream of pleasant things , such as meeting his new friend in the morning.
John’s eyes darted from side-to-side. Sherlock had not meant to put him on the spot but he grew nervous as the thought manifested. John wanted to lay in the bed with him. Yes, he did attempt to get John to do such a thing on the night he appeared in Sherlock’s room but they had come a long way since then. On the other hand he would feel positively dreadful if he sent John away. And did he not crave this as well? Did he not stare at the man in front of him with the hope that maybe he would be able to seek comfort in his embrace?
Sherlock held the wicked hand to his chest and shielded it like it had nearly been chopped off. Sherlock felt the tears welling in his eyes. He had been doing well too, had gone without tears for nearly a month. It hurt, the memory, the words - they hurt and Sherlock could not stop the tears. He slowly backed away from John.
Sherlock held the box to his chest tightly the entire ride back to the flat. He could barely contain himself, he wanted to see John’s face when he opened the box. He would be ecstatic, Sherlock knew already. The suit was pricy, but such was the way of high fashion. John would be quite the dapper man. He had to be informed by the driver that they arrived at his destination.
“What is it, John?”
Moriarty was going to Switzerland? Why there of all places? Did he need a quiet spot to groom Sebastian to be the killer that he wanted him to be?
“The doctor did not permit you access?”
Sherlock opened the door for the carriage and held his hand out for John. “Come along.”
John let out a breath and removed his hands from Sherlock’s soapy curls, much to his dismay. He placed both hands on Sherlock’s arms and rubbed his thumbs against the soft, wet skin. Was this it? Was this all he needed to say in order to initiate it? Was he ready?
John waved his hand in the air. The laboratory, the cot, the notes, this was how he was born...no, this is how he was
The hours that came after the kiss seemed like an eternity to Sherlock. He tried to busy himself by conducting countless experiments, all of which took a little over two hours, he paced around the house, he did not wish to venture outside for the remainder of the day. He cooked for the both of them with meat he had acquired some days ago. It was a simple roast. A recipe that Mrs. Hudson had taught him years prior. Every so often he would halt his whirlwind around the flat to stare at John, who sat in front of the fire, so calm he looked, so content. He would not bother Sherlock or attempt to ask him what was the matter, just wearing a small smile on his face. Sherlock longed to join him - sit in the empty spot next to John. What would he say? What would they talk about? The assault or the kiss? Sherlock would prefer to speak of the kiss that he had loved and he wanted nothing more than for John to shower him in thousands more, but then again the thought of those kisses terrified him.
Sherlock could have sworn he heard something resembling a gunshot shortly after that statement. If only he could will himself to open his eyes. Whatever Moriarty’s henchman attacked him with served its purpose. He was tied up, going by the way his wrists burned from the coarse ropes. John. Where was he? They did not harm him, did they? This Moriarty, whoever he was, had better not have laid a finger on his John. That gunshot he heard- No. No, that bullet had killed one of the henchman. Not John. John was alright, they spared him, no harm had come to him…
“Are you not hungry, Sherlock?”
He opened the letter.
Moriarty laughed and shook his head.
“John and I have decided on twice a month. Have we not John?”
“It would seem so.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Moriarty snarled and shoved Sherlock. “I would have had you years ago. Your brother thwarted my plans and had me contained. He released me some time ago and I have spent every second of my freedom finding a way to stop you. To hurt you as you have hurt me.”

It was safe to say that Sherlock and John were not ready for the severity of the storm. It began slow at first, to the point where it nearly rendered Sherlock hopeless. He thought he had misjudged the weather, that it was nothing more than the normal bout of London rain. Then John noticed, nearly an hour later, that the rain became louder as it fell, and the droplets were larger. Sherlock knew that rain from before, the same rain that fell the night John came to life, and not more than thirty minutes later they heard the boom of thunder that signaled how far the storm was. Sherlock had been counting the seconds in his head each time the thunder clapped, waiting for the lightning
Thomas nodded and motioned for them to follow. John barely caught him say, “It will all be for naught if Moriarty has his way.”
Sherlock turned to the door and left his room. He sped up the steps, propelled by disgust towards himself and the physical manifestation of all his weaknesses in the creature that lay upstairs. The room was dark but Sherlock knew precisely where the creature was. He clutched it by the arms and hauled it off of its resting place to hear the thud of lifeless limbs hitting the floor. His eyes fell upon the creature as he dragged it across the room but his gaze was obstructed by the hot tears he was not conscious of shedding. Anger for himself was directed to the man who had failed him, showed him not only his own defectiveness but the lengths to which he would go to cure it. Such features that had brought him peace before he saw not, only the betrayal of someone to which Sherlock would have loved and cared for in return for the same.
