Sherlock's behavior was unnatural and strange.
What did John decide to take with him on the mission?
After some time, he couldn't help smiling. Sherlock must have had a hard day or he suffered from boredom because the phone kept vibrating. John finally picked it up to check how many messages he got. Fifteen... He shook his head in amusement and then he suddenly noticed the light from the other room. The light entered the bedroom through a crack in the door.
She looked a bit surprised, but she smiled a moment later. John knew her as Anthea and she wasn't going to change it.
An important note at the end of the chapter.
Flashing, intense blue light interrupted his thoughts. It reflected in the windows of nearby apartments. John knew he was going to have a long conversation with some police officer, but he would love to take the opportunity to spend the next few hours at the police station in the cell. It would give him some more peace. The thought of a single cell gave him courage, so he ostentatiously drained the beer bottle and emptied it in front of the approaching man.
"And that's the point," the detective muttered directly into the porcelain cup.
"What exactly are you talking about?"
John took a breath. He wanted to know how the older genius came to such conclusions. "How..." he said, but the young girl's voice interrupted him.
Mycroft cleared his throat because he felt his mouth was terribly dry. "I know you like surprises. I won't take the pleasure of unpacking a present." His voice was a little indistinct, and low. John noticed now that his steps were not the same either. Mycroft walked a lot slower than usual, and although he tried to hide it, the slight, almost invisible imbalance testified that the alcohol they drank that afternoon was starting to affect his body. Actually its amount. Franco Coletti offered them the best and strong wine, which was not a good combination with the hot afternoon heat.
Sherlock reached for his glass without a word. For a long time, they heard only the quiet sounds of music and conversations of other hotel guests. "You saw her before," he said nonchalantly. There was no irritation in his voice, but surprise and amusement.
"What shall I do with you?".

John didn't comment. He only stared darkly at his face and wondered why he enjoyed making bitter comments about his brother so much. Of course, he knew, Sherlock also talked about him, though he doubted Molly knew and could catch the nuances. John slowly started to conclude that Sherlock's behavior had one reason. Maybe he was testing his sexuality? Did he see his friend and brother and he wanted to feel the same? Maybe it awakened feelings that he did not know or avoided until now? When he became convinced that he was not feeling what he should have with the man - which he thought he should feel - he decided to check how things would be with the woman. John could have come to such conclusions easily when he analyzed Sherlock's behavior since they were in Venice.
It was a bit disturbing. Sherlock thought Mycroft had managed to deal with Stoner, who felt the taste of defeat, realized that he had lost and will leave John alone. That he would abandon all the plans he had about him. However, his announced visit and Mycroft's nonchalant tone confused him. He tried to read some details from his brother's face. Anything that would help him predict the outcome and the effects of their confrontation. "Mycroft, you didn't get along with him, did you?" he asked with hidden concern.
"Last days were very ... nervous and I thought we should take a break from each other," Mycroft said, looking at his feet. He glanced at the canal from time to time and narrowed his eyes. "To tell you the truth, I wasn't going to inform you about the party because I know you don't like these meetings ..." he said, still not looking at John, though he felt his eyes on him.
"You're here, Mycroft. Welcome to you too, Mr. Watson," one of the men in the gray suit said, walking to John and reaching his hand toward him. He gave him a quick smile, but then looked at Holmes as if he were the only hope for this urgent situation.
"Don't ask anything more, Watson," he interrupted immediately, cutting off his conversation with the coachman. "For your own good."
"Still, when he saw me he looked like a bird protecting its chick".
"I told you before. This person is attracted to someone." He couldn't figure out how John looked at him. Something between anger and jealousy, but wrapped in fake indifference. "Let's go this way" he proposed after a long moment, which he devoted to studying the face of his friend. John frowned, but went with him to one of the most famous bridges in Venice. On the Rialto Bridge, i.e. the lovers' bridge. He had a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone. He could show John how much he cares about him and at the same time get rid of the obtrusive stalker.
"What are you doing here so early in the morning?"
"It doesn't matter," Holmes waved his hand. "Details," he demanded, leaning over the body again.
Mycroft, who was now sitting with his elbows on his knees, looked at his reflection in the water flowing under their feet. "And I hope mine never finds out." He didn't even have time to raise his head when something flashed to his right. He looked sideways and saw Sherlock taking a photo of him with a smirk.
John dropped his backpack and looked around. The idea of longer rest improved his mood a bit. He took off his shoe and poured small stones from inside. "I'll take care of Arian," he said to Lucy who was kneeling next to him.
"Wait, no. Not like that," Josh focused on the task. He wanted to bring his colleague down. He pointed at the place. After a while, he changed his mind and proposed a different solution. "Try it this way ..." he stretched and imitated the positions as if it was him was in a problematic situation.
He came to Francesca. She grabbed his hands with slender fingers.
"Finally," Sherlock smiled with genuine pleasure.
He did not answer. Instead, he grabbed the violin and began to tune the strings.
John couldn't understand it, and the thought of it almost droved him crazy. Sherlock wasn't a small child and he didn't need a babysitter. The more he thought about the reason, the more he was convinced that his friend had not done it without a reason. John felt a shiver when he thought, Sherlock had a hidden agenda. He looked at Molly. The girl was completely different from the people he had met here. Her body language, clothes, and behavior were all very different from what he saw in Francesca. Molly was sickly pale - though he had never paid attention to this detail until now - thin and ... ordinary. This thought suddenly hit John. He slowly turned into a man from 'this world', he started to see others through Mycroft's eyes, because he was surrounded by people who, like older Holmes, dealt with high-level events, but also made sure that they stood out in the crowd. He saw the difference between ordinary people - he was one of them - and people from higher society. He wondered if Mycroft was looking at him the same way? And Sherlock?
"No. But I guess with who and what they are talking about," the genius muttered quietly.
Sherlock kept his eyes on him, he did it only when the calm in the room turned into a rather uncomfortable silence. He looked away and nodded at a single object lying on the table next to the bed. "It's a good choice," he said with confidence.
He looked around the office. He realized it would take too long for them to go through all of this. He had to think strategically. He remembered Holmes saying that the murderer was wealthy, and therefore he might have been well educated as well. Moreover, the detective knew who he was. He knew him. He joined the investigation to help the police catch him. And since he knew him and helped the police at the same time, the murderer could not be his friend. If not a friend, then an enemy. Friendly enemy? He smiled at the memory of the man he called that himself. He did not remember Colonel Moran too well, but he remembered what kind of relationship they had. He was glad that they had been serving in different regiments for several years. Right. The army. He was curious to see if this sizeable collection included the tools he used as a military doctor. He didn't look long. From a distance, he could see a small section with surgical knives. He walked over, limping and silently cursing his leg. At that moment he envied Holmes's efficiency and how quietly he could move. As he approached the exhibition, he saw something that brought back terrible memories of fighting, screaming, and chaos. More than once he had to amputate a limb to save the life of his companion. And he did it using this kind of tool. A long, straight knife gleamed in the centre of the dusty display case. Liston knife. The blade cut skin and bones with unprecedented precision and smoothness. However, to do the kind of damage Annie Chapman had had, the murderer would need a knife with a different tip. Surgical kit! The thought appeared in his head and dispelled the strange darkness that had confused his mind until then. Of course! Liston knife and another one, slightly shorter with a pointed tip, from the same collection. These knives matched the victim's injuries perfectly. It was this type of knife that the murderer used. And these type of knives was in the possession of medical schools, collectors and ... doctors ...
John shuddered as the genius slowly walked over to the bed, put his finger between his shirt and the tie knot, and removed it in one move.
The penetrating gaze sent shivers down his spine, and its intensity made it impossible for him to take his eyes off him. The proud posture of the man dominated him even from a distance and made him quite uncomfortable. A long silence, broken by muffled conversation on the other side of the building, penetrated his bones. Eventually, he shook off the strange trance. He grabbed the front of the bowler hat in a gesture of greeting and nodded slightly.
"They can't deal with one guy?" John asked. He did not understand the situation.
"My hands are wet, John. Could you?"
"I did as you asked," Mrs. Coletti said. She could almost see the smile of satisfaction on her friend's face. Although she wasn't convinced of her idea, she wanted to help because she understood her motherly feelings, which she also had for both Holmes brothers and recently also for John Watson. "I think it can work."
"Maybe it's because we see how you look at yourself? And especially how he stares at you."
The hotel was so big that it was easy to get lost in. He was happy to accompany Mrs. Coletti and did not even realize that they had been circling the main hall for several minutes. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a familiar figure. When he looked up, he saw Mycroft talking to a man. His husband didn't look pleased. He looked as if he wanted to disappear or free himself from the company of his interlocutor. His teeth were slightly clenched and his dead eyes fixed on a man who seemed to be enjoying his bad mood.
"Rather so. It looks like even Sherlock has accepted my decision ..."
Sherlock frowned.
"Really?" Sherlock asked, trying to make his surprise as audible as possible. "I think otherwise. You are not such a good actor, Mycroft. Do you expect me to believe that before this show in Venice, you did not intend to use him in your plan? That you used his name for these few years, because you didn't have other people to choose? " he asked a little louder than was needed.
The hum in his head drowned out his pounding heart. He forgot the sour smell of the damp room and relished Holmes' herbal perfumes. Blood rushed not only to his face. He felt it pulsate under the skin of his mouth and the tips of his fingers. He studied the detective with his eyes, waiting for his next move. The prolonged silence and the lack of any movement tore the last knots of his self-control. When Holmes's mouth, parted enough to reveal gleaming teeth... he could not hold back any longer. He reached forward and pulled the detective's face down. Their lips pressed tightly together in a wild kiss. They clashed, fought for the tiniest inch of skin. They crushed every obstacle with force. There was so much force and roughness in their movements that he did not care about the sounds he would have been ashamed of under other circumstances. He grabbed the detective's soft hair, trying to catch his breath while continuing to kiss him. It was extremely difficult. The detective pressed him against the wall with all his weight, one hand holding his neck. It took them a long time to work out a common rhythm. His lips were crushing Holmes's lower lip and he let him nibble on his. He trembled as the hot breath washed over his face. It was a real pleasure to listen to the quiet moans of the detective, who proved his desire more and more bluntly.
They both tried to squeeze through the crowd of talking personalities until they finally reached the double glass door. They walked quietly through the lobby and left the hotel. They were sure they were being followed but did not look back. It was crowded outside. It was not late, but people were gathering in nearby restaurants. Some tourists were already enjoying the charms of the night, others were passing by, looking for a free place at any of the tables. The promenade by the main channel was teeming with people of all ages and sexes. Tasty smells from all the surrounding hotels spread in the air, and conversations were heard over the water. Waiters ran around with full trays, from hotels to tables. The musician was sitting on a low stool with a mandolin on his lap at one of the restaurations.
Oh yes. Sherlock was using his trick again - I'm busy, hold my phone. However, this time he overdid it. Is this man have no shame? "Hold it" John didn't give up. He waved the phone to force Sherlock to answer.
He shook his head. He pulled out a few more shillings and handed them over to the pleased boy. "Speak."
John raised a corner of his mouth slightly. He nodded. He had to admit that he would happily go for a lonely walk away from the curious glances of others. He agreed to Lucy's rather direct offer, but he decided to make sure that everything was all right with Sherlock. At least, that it was fine enough that he would not have time to argue with others until his return. He came to a friend who, feeling someone's presence next to him, slightly opened his eyes, but did not change his position.
John managed to get to know the city and the surrounding area by heart, but he let Francesca take care of them that day. She showed them around the city and chose places where the crowd was much smaller, which made their walk more pleasant. He walked beside her, letting her hold his elbow. He listened carefully to her stories. He would have enjoyed more in this situation, if not for one detail. Actually two. Sherlock and Molly. They walked side by side behind him and Francesca.
John felt unbelievably sad. He was silent for a long time, staring at Mycroft. John knew that the older Holmes brother preferred loneliness. He knew he shied away from people because he considered them not worthy of his attention. But at the moment he felt sorry for him like never before. How many times has he sat locked up in four walls with a glass of whiskey in his hand and stared alone at the wall? How many trips ended in this way? Has he ever tried to break through this wall of egocentrism and aversion to others to spend time pleasantly in the company of someone other than his reflection in the mirror? At that moment, John's desire to be with two weirdos, - the Holmes brothers, - turned into a desire to help Mycroft taste a bit of normality.
"Do you have a meeting tomorrow?
The corridor was long and winding. Sherlock had the feeling that he wasn't in a secret government building but a maze. Finally, he felt a stronger breeze on his face. He knew they were approaching the wider hall. At one point, he saw the bright light that entered the building through the glass roof, and then John. His friend was standing by the wall and he was talking to a woman.
John gave him a quick smile. He leaned his elbows on the counter and joined his fingers together.
John never thought that his decision would upset Sherlock to this level. Genius had not spoken to him for several days and avoided being alone with him. Even last night, when John was standing by the door with a very small carry-on suitcase, his friend was playing the violin by the window without turning around.
He was angry with himself when he reached the centre of the room. There was a tall glass case there. At the level of his face, right in front of him, he noticed something that looked like a short sword. One look at the signature was enough to reassure him that his assumptions were correct. Falcata. Ancient blade. The warped metal was covered with limescale all over the surface. The sword was nothing like the lethal, terrifying blade it had been in the past, and yet something was mesmerizing about it. He wondered how many years the sword had been hidden somewhere underground. He looked closely at its edges and rough surface until he saw ... eyes. Only his training reflexes allowed him not to flinch. The bright gaze reflected off several layers of glass. When he looked up, he saw Holmes's gaze. He was standing on the other side of the cabinet, completely silent. The shadow falling across his face was disturbing. It made him look mysterious. His pale skin contrasted with the black coat. Twenty inches of air and two layers of glass could not contain the glow of his gaze. Bright eyes pierced every obstacle, burned the skin of his face, and made him shiver. The breath from the slightly parted lips misted the glass.
His left hand was holding a cup of tea. In the other one, he was holding a phone. He was smiling while reading messages from Sherlock. Genius tormented him with text messages and John understood it was really difficult for him to function away from his friend. Some of the messages were ratty, but he had already got used to it.
"I'm sorry. I wasn't going to take my frustration out on you, John."
John shook his head slightly, so the older man leaned over him again and kissed him calmly on the exposed cheek. He could feel John's eyelashes brushing against his skin as he closed his eyes. He put his tongue in John's ear and caressed his groin with his fingers.
The doctor almost smiled and looked at his friend. He had no idea that his voice would please him so much. "If your brother tries to put his hand where it doesn't suit me, I promise to stick my fingers in his eye sockets. My virtue will not be tainted by him, Sherlock. Don't worry so much."
If it wasn't for the nervous movement under the table, revealing a slight irritation of Sherlock with his words, Mycroft would be fooled by the compliment. "You envy me?" he asked with raised eyebrow and surprise.
"How do you have access to this information? You deal with the internal matters of your country and you do not have the right to possess this type of data" Mycroft no longer concealed his irritation.
"And yet we are not in control of everything." For the first time, the mysterious man nervously shifted his seat. "Let me reassure you. You helped make some decisions that will be valued later on. And some that may turn out to be... regrettable".
"... at's why I advised her to change her surroundings."
"I have to go," he said and stroked her shoulders comfortingly. He headed for the back door. He tried not to attract attention, so he avoided the largest clusters of people, stayed away from the dance floor and tables filled with food and alcohol. Despite his efforts many people tried to catch him for a short conversation. He apologized to everyone and did not stop moving forward. Suddenly he felt a firm grip on his shoulder. He didn't even have time to turn around when he heard his friend's voice on his right ear.
Thank you for your patience and support!
Younger Holmes ignored his brother's intense gaze and focused on further deduction. "The owner is either an activist or an elderly woman with a weakness for old cats," he continued. "She cares for him, you can see it in the combed fur and clean ears of the cat. He is used to caressing and even demands it." He looked at the red cat that cuddled more and more into Molly's hands and dug deeper into her dress. "Spoiled, little kitty." He grabbed the cat gently at the face with two fingers and gently shook it sideways. "This is not the only animal in her home. She lives with her family in the south of the city near the main canal. On the second floor I think," he said proudly. He leaned back in his chair and looked at his brother first, then at John. If he had to, he could easily show how he deduced all these things. The color of the faded fur that the cat had on one side, indicating that he liked to take a nap high on the windowsill with a view of the water. That his fur was mixed with the fur of other animals, and this was caused because the owner used one brush to comb all her pets. Or the fact that the cat avoided the company of young children, which he certainly simply had had enough of. If he had to, he would dispel doubts. However, this was not necessary. John and Molly looked at him in silence and with admiration. "The owner is an older woman," he added with satisfaction.
"And you are surprised because...?" John asked in a low voice and looked at Aaron. "We have nothing to talk about. But you have the opportunity to try what you've been training so passionately on me over the past week. You should do better with women."
Molly walked past him and made John gasp and turn his head away. He didn't want to smell her. It was absurd, he knew that, but the fear of recognizing his friend's smell on her was so terrifying that it disturbed his common sense and sober thinking. He knew the smell of Sherlock, it was a combination of the bitter smell of cigarettes, book dust, something chemical and pleasant cologne, which he didn't use every day - because Sherlock assumed that why he should use perfumes when he spends his days in pajamas or a bedding and experimented - but the smell stayed on his body and clothes. That's why he knew one deep sniff would be enough, and he would know if his guess was true.
"You have been alone for so many years and you rely only on yourself. You have gotten used to being lonely and you have not even noticed how your behavior affects Sherlock." Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his best friend flinch. "You two are so different ... and at the same time you are the same." Now comes the most difficult part of the conversation. The last thing he wanted was to hurt Sherlock. But he started and had to finish it. He took a deep breath, turning to his friend.
"I heard you talked to her yesterday. I have to thank her for this bill," he said and looked at John. He frowned and stared at him a little longer. John was silent and knew Mycroft was deducing him now, but he didn't feel like masking what he would usually prefer to keep to himself. He stood in silence and looked at the man who examined him with a short but very inquisitive look.
Mycroft gritted his teeth. He kept his eye on John for a long moment. "We are doing just that," he murmured with such certainty that his words left no doubt as to his sincerity. He watched John in silence. The doctor analyzed his words, breathing faster and faster.
John didn't know why he didn't protest when Stoner pulled him out of the hotel and led him into the city. He felt like a child, guided by a parent's hand. It was like he had nothing to say. He would love to get away and return to the Danieli Hotel, but the firm grip on his hand and the closeness of the man were so overwhelming and irresistible that he could not do it. Aaron looked pleased with the current situation. He wiped his forehead with an elegant handkerchief and did not stop even for a moment.
Stoner finally looked at glass doors in the main hall then at his expensive watch. "I think I should go. We start an important meeting in half an hour. The city is busy so it will be a miracle if I can get to the other end of the city in time. It was nice to meet you, Sherlock. I hope we will have the opportunity to talk longer in the next days ... "he said, bowing slightly towards genius, and then focused all his attention on pale John.
"This room reeks of sex."
"Why, Mycroft?"
He was awakened by the sounds of a soft knocking on the keyboard. He saw nothing but the light behind his back, which was reflected on the bedroom wall. He realized it was Mycroft. The man took the opportunity and decided to abandon the narrow sofa for a large bed. Of course, he took his job with him because it was most important to him. John wasn't even surprised. Every genius he knew valued his work above all else. The worst of them all was Sherlock.
He blinked thoughtfully and remembered the gift he had received from his army companions. He pulled a handkerchief from his coat pocket. It was white with embroidered initials of his and the army to which he belonged. He felt sentiment every time he looked at this gift and recalled the hot days in the deserts, and wilderness of Afghanistan. He handed the handkerchief to his friend who jumped off the cab and walked over to one of the horses.
"What is it, John?" he asked what caught his brother's and Molly's attention. He leaned away from the offered plate as if the view was disgusting.
5. Would you like to have a choice of your own ending or making decisions while reading a story (like in a game)?
"I can take a photo of you if you like," John suggested, and she gladly agreed. She gave him her phone, got up and went down to the lower platform at one of the banks. She turned and smiled.
"I'm going to work." Greg took a seat next to him. He leaned forward, yawned, and rubbed his face and hair. "On my way to the police station, I got a request to check if the area here was okay," his voice was slurred and muffled. "People have complained that some dodgy guy has been sitting in front of their windows for hours and he doesn't look like he's about to move," he gave him an eloquent look, and a smirk played on his lips. "Nice spot," he said, looking around the area. "There is no better view than concrete walls, smeared with spray and the stench of piss. The neighborhood can almost compete with Venice, huh?" he asked with a smile that faded quickly because John was in no mood to joke. Greg realized he shouldn't pursue the topic, although he was very tempted. He cleared his throat and sat comfortably on the bench. "Why are you sitting here, John?"
"And you?" John relaxed and leaned back on the bench, making room for the inspector.
Aaron pushed the door open and they both went inside. Mycroft saw a metal staircase leading to the upper floors on his right. Aaron went first, by Mycroft watched people and hotel staff for a moment. They didn't even notice when two unknown men slipped inside their hotel. The waitresses were bustling around the tables at the back of the hotel restaurant. The bartenders were busy preparing drinks, and the manager earnestly, but tactfully tried to calm down three men who were intoxicated by alcohol for sure. Mycroft didn't even want to comment. He followed Aaron. As they climbed the next floors, Aaron turned a smile at him with his hands in his pockets.
"I can feel the tip of the knife piercing the skin, fat, and muscle. I pull the blade to the side. The knife cuts through the lower abdomen ... stomach ... chest ... and breastbone ..." he fell silent, staring at the doctor but did not withdraw his finger. "I know I'm risking more and more with each passing moment, but I want to take something with me that will remind me of her. But what?" he asked softly, raising his eyebrows and giving him a greedy stare.
"I see ... But I was surprised when you said you would prefer to talk to him face to face."
John didn't see Mycroft for the rest of the day. For a moment he even wondered if the man was acting like that because of their kiss in the morning. Mycroft was a distant man, but pretending to be married had some influence on him. John had proof that even a simple kiss affected him. Blushes, trembling lips, and hazy eyes were proofs of Mycroft's normality.
"My John ... You looks much better," Francesca said, stepping up with a smile on her ruby lips. Her tight dress, slim hands and hair braided in a bun emphasized her beauty. John could look at her for hours. He came up to her and offered her his arm.
"Exactly," John nodded. "He would know right away what happened at night. I know it's ridiculous, in the end, he gave me the keys to your house. He suggested that I do what I have to do as soon as possible and that we end this strange situation. He said that otherwise, we both go crazy, and it makes no sense to delay the inevitable. But I'm afraid that nothing will be the same anyway. "
"What was he tormenting you about?" there was amusement in the detective's voice.
"Everything is fine. Why do you think he did something?"
The handkerchief did help. Seeing it, the people allowed the carriage to pass. The street was narrow, and people squeezed, to at least glance at the door of the building, where the tragedy took place. Finally, the carriage stopped. Lestrade was generous enough to pay the coachman and make him wait nearby. They got out of the hansom cab and started making their way to the crime scene.
Molly nodded. "Yes. If it will make us all happy, then yes."
The figures became clearer with each step. After a while, he recognized Holmes' slender figure. His top hat and long coat stood out against the white walls. The second man was a head shorter than the detective. The underside of his toga moved with every gust of air. He listened to the detective in silence, head proudly held high. They were both busy with the ongoing discussion. He approached them, hearing the thudding of his own heart, the rushing of blood, and the clatter of his cane. He wanted to tell the detective about what he discovered as soon as possible. He stared at him, hoping that Holmes would pay attention to him. But the one who finally looked at him was the other man. He turned his head and watched him intently. His dark eyes narrowed for a moment, then curiosity flashed across his face.
He moved to make room for him. "I'm going to meet Stamford this afternoon. He wants to introduce me to the man who is looking for a flatmate. There are a few hours left, so I have to fill them up with something" he paused, looking at his friend, who was occupied with his thoughts.
Francesca tactfully and respectfully continued to express her thoughts aloud. "But I see it is a good choice. You are happy. I see it. You fit together and I don't see other people than John next to you. You feel good in your partnership."
"To be honest, I'd rather go back to the hotel. It's too hot and I'm not hungry," John said in a resigned tone. He lowered his eyes and immediately sensed the presence of another man above him. When he looked at Aaron, a shiver went down his back. Stoner was smiling strangely, and his body was definitely too close.
John and Mycroft clutched their hands.
"Hmm. Valpolicella" he muttered contentedly, gently swaying the glass. "An excellent year". The strong taste of red wine suited the late hour and circumstances. "Leave the bottle, please," he said in Italian to the elegant waiter who was waiting for his reaction.
John couldn't help smiling. "Strong coffee, no sugar nor milk, please."
He frowned, tilting his head as he peered inside. "Same as entering the stranger's carriage."
"Sherlock, why are you in such a good mood?" John crossed his legs and leaned the back of his head against the chair's head with a smile. "You failed the experiment. We have no interesting cases. For several days nothing is happening ...".
He walked on, looking from side to side. He listened to his own steps, the noise of his cane, and the metallic sound of a police whistle tapping rhythmically on the buttons on his coat. He was well prepared to face the danger, but for his own safety, he decided to take something else from his room as well. The weight of the revolver in his pocket was satisfactory. Revolver hit his thigh as if reminding him of its presence with every step. Oh, yes. Walking alone through the dark alleys seemed much safer with his old friend in his pocket.
This time Mycroft reached for a glass of water, trying to hide his slightly flushed cheeks. "You looked like you wanted it," he muttered softly and took a sip of water.
"Because unlike us, she didn't come here by private plane," Mycroft interrupted him and satisfied his curiosity. "They changed her flight time." He came to the door. He waited for John, who took a bouquet of white daisies, except one flower from the table, and followed the genius.
John still felt chills and unpleasant pain in his stomach. When the door closed behind Aaron and Mycroft, he knew he had to do something. He couldn't leave him after what he saw. He was sure that Stoner was up to something and finally decided to take the lead. He had to help Mycroft, although he didn't know how. He looked at Molly, who was still looking at him apologetically.
He sucked in a breath because for the first time light from outside illuminated part of the stranger's face. He looked at his thin lips and the tip of his long nose.
"If you would be so kind ..."
"That's good ..." John sighed and tilting his head back, put his fingers together on his stomach. He enjoyed the warm wind on his face. "... I won't feel like the last idiot at least."
"Yes, please".
"You think John is as promiscuous as you?"
John shivered. It was like that every time Mycroft initiated intimate contact. He couldn't help feeling a bit dominated around him, and for some reason, he's been enjoying it a lot lately. He looked at his friend who nodded. The touch of raw flesh, Sherlock's interior, and boundless trust was everything to him at the moment. He sat more comfortably between his friend's open legs. He smeared some vaseline all over his penis, put the tip right next to the sensitive hole, and waited. Not for permission, but for a moment when Sherlock was ready. He could feel Mycroft taking off the rest of his clothes behind his back, then the gentle hands caressing his ribs.
"It's just small diversion to the banquet. Nobody thinks sincerely about dancing...".
"I walk closer to her. I try to gain her trust. I seduce her and offer money. The woman agrees. She leads me to this place. We try to be quiet because potential witnesses are sleeping right above us. We go down the stairs. I feel the excitement growing inside me. I know with what intention I came here. We stand close to the fence and look at each other. We need the right mood, so maybe the woman starts to stimulate me, maybe our lips connect for a while ... ".
He didn't wait long. He buttoned his waistcoat, grabbed his cane and wool bowler, and quickly left the rented room that had been temporarily assigned to him by the army since his return from Afghanistan. He grimaced as he closed the front door and rubbed his nose. The smells from the street still irritated his nostrils, even though he had been enjoying his return home for over a month now. He limped over to a teenage boy whose voice was heard all over the neighbourhood.
Holmes managed to grab the antique knife before it got stuck to the wooden floor. For a moment he froze in place with his hand outstretched. He straightened up very slowly. "This blade would cut the throat, but it is not suitable for gutting."
John left the flat. Standing on the sidewalk, he felt that if he turned and looked up, his gaze would meet the sad gaze of his friend who was standing behind the dirty living room window. He was used to this look though it was one of the last things he wanted to get used to. He would have preferred to see Sherlock smile as he waited for his return, and it was killing him that it was too late for such reactions.
Sherlock frowned but didn't answer. He repeated the words of his brother in his head. He felt like he was reading his mind. He did not doubt that Mycroft was well aware of his plans and that in his own way he was supporting him in his relationship with John. He seemed to understand that Sherlock could find true happiness only with his friend. That's why he couldn't understand Mycroft's motives. Why did he want their help right now? What was so important? Couldn't his people deal with the problem alone? He felt close to solving these questions, but he didn't want to think about them anymore. He did not intend to worry about the country and security matters at all. But John did ... It was because of him that he decided to make this trip to the other end of England, but if it was up to him, they would be sitting now in their flat and talk about irrelevant things, and he would have the opportunity to look at the silver hair of a friend and his bright wise eyes. Unfortunately, he couldn't resign when John contacted Mycroft and promised they would both come to the meeting.
"Fuck ..." said 'handyman'. "What I can do ... I'm in it too."
"But if I have to be there, I should at least know why, don't you think?"
He watched with relief as Holmes's face moved away from his belt. Later his eyes fell on the open hand holding the knife. He turned his neck to meet the detective's eyes. He noticed that he was staring at him with an uneasy twinkle in his eyes. They were silent for a long moment. "I said it is interesting, not that it resembles a murder weapon," he said, interrupting his gaze and gently taking the knife from Holmes's hand. He heard a pleased grunt behind him.
Holmes was sitting at the table with his head lowered over some papers. He was holding a magnifying glass in one hand and was writing something on a pile of carelessly piled documents with the other one. The room was messy, full of dusty books, a gilded microscope, and scraps of frayed material.
John's eyes fell on his chapped lips. He remembered their touch on his cheek, hot breath, and that wet kiss. He wanted to wipe the place where Stoner had marked him with such possessiveness in the previous night. He saw Mycroft behind him. Genius looked at him a bit longer than usual. He looked like he was thinking about something very hard. A moment later, Mycroft turned to the hotel manager and shook his head.
John was trembling with the effort. He wanted to move, make even a slight thrust, but all he did was leave light kisses to the side of Sherlock's face. At this point, Mycroft's warm fingers ran down his back.
The next emotions he knew, although they were not pleasant, were feelings of rejection and resignation. He was angry with himself for the pride and stubbornness he manifested at the beginning of their relationship. He regretted his behavior, coldness, and ignorance, which made John move away from him and at the very beginning gave up the idea to look at him as a potential partner. He knew where he had made the mistake, but he thought he had no choice but to accept John's rejection. He felt it when it seemed that his friend had found a partner of his life. He couldn't honestly enjoy his happiness, but he tried. He tried for John. He wanted happiness for him, even if he had to suffer because of it. Everything has changed. Now he did not want to give up and wanted to fight for him.
John wanted to accentuate his anger, so he set the glass loudly on the table without taking his eyes off Aaron. His grin made John feel blood running down his cheeks. The last person he wanted to talk about was Sherlock. John calmed down after a moment, took a deep breath and leaned his back against the chair.
John waited for his reaction but Mycroft did not turn to him. He slowly came closer to his husband, and finally stood right behind him. "I talked to Stoner," he said, wanting to get his attention. He hoped Aaron's name would make Mycroft look at him, or at least mutter something under his breath. He had to admit, he missed his attention.
"I'm 'trying' to be?" Mycroft asked with genuine surprise. John struck his pride.
"Nothing? No response? You won't ask what happened or what were we talking about?"
"I wanted you to rest. It was still very early ..."
"I am," he repeated emphatically.
"Like everything we do every day."
"Mycroft, it's almost four in the morning ..." he said, stepping up to his husband with crossed arms. He leaned his back against the window and stared at Mycroft's pale face lightened by the laptop screen. The older man sighed theatrically. John immediately thought of his best friend, who also expressed his annoyance in this way.
The thought that his friend might have 'trained' before, hit John like lightning. His eyes widened, and a small smile appeared on his lips, though he tried to control it. It was all the more difficult for him when Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked away. "Since when?" he asked, opening the bottle.
The tepid water was very pleasant to his skin. John stood with his eyes closed and let his mind wander. He didn't know what time it was and he wasn't interested in it too much. He wanted to relax. When he opened his eyes he saw a bottle of expensive gel. It belonged to Mycroft. Genius always hid his things, but not this time. John's hand reached for the bottle. He opened it and put the gel under his nose.
"And what would be wrong with doing that?" John did not give up. He kind of understood the way geniuses worked. He knew that style was more important than victory. Especially when the game was between people with similar intelligence.
"I doubt it, John. You're too noble for that." Another sip of wine eased his dry throat after what he heard about himself.
"Some people are lucky enough to decide this for themselves." The stranger brought his hand to his mouth, and as he lowered his arm, there was a little less amber liquor in his glass.
John was very close to the flat now. He heard his own tired breathing. He could feel the sweat trickling down his body. Sweat caused not only by sprinting half the way from the store, but also by what he had heard so far. Right now, there was an extended silence on the other side of the phone. It took a few moments for him to recognize Mycroft's voice.
"Ah ... Mycroft ..."
John was so overwhelmed by his thoughts he did not realize he was still standing in the middle of the living room. He only came to his senses when he felt a draft when the bedroom door opened. He raised his head and looked at the sleepy Sherlock, who had just got out of bed a moment before. When he saw John he stood in place and rubbed his eyes to look at him better. The wind blew his curly hair.
"Don't worry about it, Mycroft ..." John said, reaching for his glass. "... if I didn't like it, you would definitely feel it."
Mycroft raised an eyebrow and looked around. "Unfortunately, the hotel staff don't bother to make our lives simpler, John. We'll probably have to deal with this situation for some time. I hope this doesn't cause you too much trouble."
She shrugged as if she didn't care. John had more than once assured her that his relationship with Sherlock was purely friendly, but she apparently did not believe him. She leaned her hips on the table and sighed. "If you say so ... I don't care, but I'm slowly beginning to feel sorry for him."
Nice music changed its sound from time to time. Sometimes, something more lively and rhythmic occurred among the melancholic sounds. However, due to the late time, calmer melodies prevailed. With each passing moment, customers began to leave the restaurant. Tourists were returning to hotels, and the staff was finishing their last orders, which was only alcohol. The chef and his helpers finished work after one in the morning. Only the most determined customers remained on the dance floor and at the tables. When it was only about an hour until dawn, Mycroft, his brother, John, and Molly decided to leave the restaurant. Return to the hotel and a possible nap no longer made sense. According to the plan, they should sign out at six in the morning, and they had less than two hours. They decided to sleep on the plane on the way back to London. They wanted to spend their last moments walking around the city. The crowd disappeared from the streets. Only couples and wobbly gentlemen - who could not find their way back to the hotel - were hanging around the alleys. A barefoot woman slipped off the bridge, laughing and waving her shoes in her hands. They passed a man who gathered the chairs together, and young girls sleeping in a cool alley with dresses pulled up almost to the hips. They walked along the banks of the canal, breathing in the smell of water. Molly managed to get a portion of ice cream that John had bought for her from a tired and annoyed salesman. The sky was slowly changing color. From deep black to slightly less dark navy blue. The area was known for a beautiful view of the rising sun, so they stopped and sat on a low bridge. As usual, John took the place next to his friend. Molly couldn't imagine sitting next to an older genius, so she sat down next to Sherlock's shoulder. And Mycroft could not imagine sitting on a cold stone bridge. He informed the rest of the company about it, but gave up at their urging and sat reluctantly beside John.
"That's enough!" said John. He was fed up with this absurd situation and bizarre discussion. He still couldn't understand what had happened in those few minutes. He looked at Sherlock and Mycroft. His raised tone caught their attention. "Mycroft, I'll pretend I didn't hear your proposition. I don't even want to wonder if you were serious or not. Forgive me, but I have to go to the hospital, I'm on duty". Before John slammed the door, he looked one last time at Sherlock and Mycroft. He had the impression that the brothers were fighting a silent war. He did not support any of them, because no matter who won, he was always their only victim.
He was awakened by the sound of water coming from behind the closed bathroom door. It was a warm morning, John had no idea what time it was, but he wasn't going to waste more time. He slid off the huge bed very slowly and stretched with a loud grunt, looking out of the open window.
He noticed how his friend's gaze softened, how his breathing quickened, and he tried with all his might to control the flow of words that were surely popping up in his head.
"Buongiorno, signore!"
"I must," he sighed. "To make up for what I have thrown out of my mind, and John considers it important. I noticed that he appreciates your knowledge and insight in many areas."
"Mary Sue Collins was the first prostitute he murdered. I knew then she would not be the last victim. I followed the case and initially tried to get the police to take it seriously."
The drawer slid out silently. On top was a black pipe and a box of matches. Next to it, a small case and a few letters. Some stamps and a dozen broke metal pen tips.
John turned on his heel without waiting for the other man's response and then entered the room.
"Are you so sure of that?" he asked less distressed and put his arms around Mycroft's neck.
"... and that's what you want, right? I know what you desire and I would love to help you achieve it ...". He caught her fingers in his gentle embrace and kissed the top of her hand, trying to look like someone humble begging her to comply with his request.
"Daisies?" Sherlock asked.
"Actually, I'd like to talk to you." John was surprised at how decisive his voice sounded, given what he had to communicate. He watched Sherlock's eyes fill with relief and a strange joy. He did not have time to look at his older brother's face. His best friend's loud clap forced him to focus all his attention on him.
"... I give her a few more minutes," Sherlock said, but before he could add anything else, he heard a loud smack. He turned his head and looked at the couple. The girl stood furious, and the man sat huddled in a chair. She screamed something in Italian and struck him with an open hand on his back and head. People looked at them with the same surprise as John and Sherlock. But genius knew that sooner or later the girl's patience would end. They watched how enraged woman snatched the phone from the man's hand and throw on at the ground, then left and yelled some curses.
"Sorry, I have other plans, but thank you for inviting me, Molly," he replied, trying not to sound as excited as he really was. He passed the girl and walked to the stairs.
"We had a stressful morning, that's all."
"Just don't tell me you suddenly feel in the mood for sentiments," John with a slight irony raised an eyebrow and gave him a smirk.
The newspaper creaked in his hands as he turned the next pages. His smile might have been less ironic if it hadn't been for the title and the content on the cover, highlighted with thick, black ink. He shook his head slightly as he reached for his cup. He was savoring the taste of bitter tea, listening to the sounds from the fireplace.
He stopped, almost crashing into the detective's back. He looked at him and then at the inspector. "I will consider that option, but first I will help Mr Holmes catch Jack the Ripper." The face of his new friend reassured him that the detective was very happy with his decision. Maybe a little too happy.
"It's better now," John murmured with obvious satisfaction. "And maybe ..." he didn't finish, instead he stood on his toes and put his hands on Mycroft's collar. He quickly and nimbly untied the gray-purple tie and pulled it down with one hand.
"Sherlock, please ... Could we not argue at least this once. Why are you still resisting and trying to make my life more difficult?"
The genius watched him for a long moment, his mouth slightly open, remembering everything he could see. Every birthmark, hair, and scar. He took a step forward, wrapped his arms around him, and began to leave gentle kisses along his neck, and John's shoulder. He tangled his fingers between his hair and finally looked into his eyes with a blurry gaze.
"Fine. Play something if you have to" Lucy was finally convinced by Josh's pleas. "But it would be better for you if it wasn't a song about some slutty Catherine again or about Miss Eleonora's boobs," she said, looking threateningly at him.
John was walking ahead, completely ignoring what was happening around him. He was stunned and did not focus on conversations coming from behind high buildings, a dazzling sunrise, the sound of passing ships or the quick steps of his friend walking just behind him. He still did not believe what had happened several minutes earlier in this cool and dark street. Sherlock Holmes, the same Sherlock who was abstaining from all kinds of intimacy, has changed completely now. John did not recognize his friend, but everything started to make sense - his strange behavior, seeking close physical contact, persistent glances or that kiss attempt. Sherlock Holmes was up to something, and that was ...
"Aaron will come to visit us, John. But this visit will not take him long." Mycroft ignored him and turned to the doctor. He closed the laptop, put it on the table, then returned to the previous position.
"You were different before. Yes, you always kept everything at bay, you were cool and inhibited. But it's even worse now. You look offended at everything. What happened? I could get along with you until Sherlock came to Venice. It because of him you are more introverted? Are you so inaccessible and cold because of him? " John's voice was filled with compassion, and Mycroft couldn't stand it. He couldn't stand it when someone felt sorry for him. He clenched his teeth and looked at John the way he looked at him when he was about to leave the room.
John put his lips to his friend's chest. He could hear and feel his heart beating under his skin. With his free hand, he massaged his penis, doing it slowly and thoroughly, wanting to drive him crazy. He was successful because Sherlock was getting more and more impatient. He ran his fingers through his hair, lifting his hips meaningfully. John, too, was on the verge of endurance. He quickly licked the genius's penis, enjoying his desperate moan, and sat down between his legs. He was removing his fingers when suddenly the door to the room swung open and Mycroft stepped in, drawing all his attention.
"What did my brother do?" he asked when he learned everything. John wanted to shake his head because he still didn't know how Sherlock and Mycroft did it. He sighed and walked to the bedroom door.
* Chapter contains curses
"But I have to agree with you. Mycroft is reluctant to maintain close relationships with the people around him. Things are different when it comes to the people he cares about. There are not many of them, that's true. However, when Mycroft has an important person, he does everything to protect them and he starts to... be more interested".
"Thank you so much. Are you going to Whitechapel too?" he asked as he stepped into the carriage.
Mycroft watched him and didn't know how to react. John did what he wanted again and there was no way to stop him. Genius saw him approach Mr. Coletti. He bowed low and exchanged a few words with the man. A wide smile appeared on Francesca's face. A second later she went with John to the center of the room. Mycroft didn't know why, but his heart was pounding. He did not want John's behavior to be badly received, and at the same time, he felt calm, looking at his pose and behavior. Everything looked good.
At one point, one of the band members played a melody that revived Molly. "I know this song," she said, straightening up in a chair. "This was my dad's favorite" her words were not heard or ignored by the Holmes brothers because none responded. They had a discussion with John on a topic related to Scotland Yard.
"Savoir Vivre? What's that supposed to mean?" John asked, completely dumbfounded.
"I will accompany you then!" Stoner exclaimed with strange excitement and contentment. John was about to get the idea out of his mind, but Aaron took the documents from his hands and almost forcibly led him to the empty gondola that had just reached the shore.
"Trust, John. Trust is the keyword in this situation. You are a friend of Sherlock, there is no better candidate" Mycroft said with a quiet tone. It was obvious that he was already tired of the whole situation.
This time Sebastian stopped and turned to the rest of the group. He wasn't angry, but curious. He looked at John for a long time. He finally nodded. "All right".
However, it was still difficult for him to accept how one day could change his life and push it in a different direction. Only yesterday it was hard for him to get out of bed. Meanwhile, this morning turned out to be astonishing. He was involved in the biggest investigation in years, and he was also helping this unusual man, who stopped the monotony of his life and was the reason for his excitement he hadn't felt in a very long time. He felt the danger, the agitation, and the thrill. An explosive mixture that made him feel alive. And it was all thanks to Holmes. To the detective, who was sitting nonchalantly on the seat of the rocking carriage and watched him with a barely visible smirk on his lips.
"*Can't buy me love. Everybody tells me so. Can't buy me love. No no no, no... Why the long face, Mycroft? You don't know this song? I heard it by accident on the internet when I was looking for information about ... London ".
He immediately noticed his brother, who was sitting cross-legged at a low table and was busy reading something on a laptop. When Sherlock saw his older brother, he quickly closed the laptop. He got up off the floor and sat on the couch without a hurry.
"Thank you for your concern, John. I really appreciate it, but I have a private doctor. I don't expect any diagnosis or recommendations from you ..." Mycroft looked at his husband, who was still adamant and stared at him with frowns. The older man finally sighed and leaned back in his chair.
"John, we're here" Mycroft's tone was the same. Delicate but firm. It wasn't until a few moments later when John rubbed his eyes and looked out the window, he saw sunny Venice and he thought it was worth agreeing to Mycroft's offer. Even if only for the view.
"You have fifteen minutes."
"She did it because she did not want to expose the rest of the family to the humiliation that would be brought about by the fact that their son's chosen one was another man. Also, her brother would also face terrible punishment and condemnation for this type of practice. That is why she killed him and later she took her own life because of pain and loss. "
Of course. He could expect this kind of drama when John wanted to sound serious.
John raised an eyebrow. "Have you packed up yet?"
The moment he turned toward the door, Sherlock suddenly spoke to him after three days of silence. "John... Don't let him wrap you around his finger. He's not as holy and virtuous as he claims to be. If Mycroft, you know ... if he tries something ..."
"Your Mycroft is so shy," she said cheerfully.
Some of them stopped and pointed their finger at Sherlock, who was standing in the window, coughing. Other people took out their phones and started recording this amazing scene. Sherlock saw them.
"We haven't met today, Sherlock. You don't have to use one of your trained roles to talk to me ..." John sighed quietly and put a cup of coffee to his lips. From the corner of his eye, he saw Sherlock stare at him and had a strange impression, his lips were the object of his friend's interest. He decided not to think about if he was right and continued to sip coffee, staring at the colorful bottles of expensive drinks standing on the shelf on the other side of the counter.
"I know Mycroft better than he thinks, and I can assure you, John, that just as he avoids people, he hates the thought of relying on someone or needing their support and help."
"Maybe a keychain with the inscription 'Venice'?" Molly hesitated, looking from one souvenir stand to the other. Because of the buzz and the presence of so many people, she couldn't make up her mind.
"Mycroft ... do you regret it?" he asked a little more carefully and calmly. The older man stared at him blankly, as if wondering if he understood the question correctly and whether it would be about their relationship. John had to know his opinion and wanted to know if Mycroft could turn back time, he would make other decisions. Mycroft didn't answer but looked away. John took this as an unambiguous answer and let his emotions take control over him. He leaned slightly towards Mycroft and raised his finger, as he used to do during emotional conversations with Sherlock.
"I was looking for you," John said in a warm tone. He felt that Mycroft was having a hard time. When Mrs. Coletti released his elbow, he bowed slightly at her, then approached Mycroft and faced the strange but good-looking man.
"You have eight minutes."
"Do you think I'm so proud?" Mycroft asked with a raised eyebrow.
"A-aah!" Sherlock jumped up from the pillow and put a hand on his head. "Wait ... ah! John!".
He had mixed feelings because the room he 'borrowed' the keys to, was right next to his apartment. The two apartments were divided by a wall, solid and soundproofed, but only a wall. How could he endure these few days knowing that the reason for his arrival was so close and at the same time he couldn't personally control what was happening to him? These doubts intensified when he finally stood in front of the double door. He put the key in the lock and silently got inside.
He nodded.
The girl, however, stared at the floor and avoided his stare. "What? Ah, yes ... But you know ... Sherlock started to ignore me, and I have not had contact with Aaron since the morning ... It seems that both of them avoid me" she added with a sad and forced smile, glancing at John. He ignored the mention of Stoner, but the news that Sherlock had left her alone surrounded by so many strangers was a surprise to him. They looked like a couple until now. What was happening here?
John raised a corner of his mouth. "I didn't get lost in the Afghan desert or the mountains. Why should it be different this time?"
"The documents should be ready yesterday. If you are unable to arrange them in time, we will have to consider whether our further cooperation makes sense." Mycroft's tone was cold and very official. John thought he must have sounded like that whenever he worked. Mycroft leaned over the laptop keyboard and started writing something with one hand, his other hand still busy with the telephone.
was immediately associated with splattering blood and disemboweled guts. In other words, things that captured the imagination of plain folks.
"Why should I get orders over cell phone since Mr. Holmes is usually right next to me?"
When they arrived, the first thing that caught his eye was a small but elegant plane. Right next to him was a car with the door open and several people around it. Mycroft was among them, he was talking to the pilot of the plane. When John's car stopped a few yards in front of the machine, the driver opened door for him.
"My moustache, to be more specific" he quickly replied, pointing to his face. "He thinks it makes me look old".
Strangely, John felt good. Of course, he wasn't 100% sober and he knew it, but he didn't have problems keeping his balance. His eyes were not in the worst shape either, because he noticed that the box in his hand was one, not two or four. One small red box that almost fell out of his hand when he hit Mycroft's back, who stopped suddenly. John looked up and saw Molly in front of him. She was also coming back to her apartment. She was carrying a plate with some salad and a tiny amount of cheese. The blue dress fluttered lightly, just like her hair.
"My meeting with the inspector was pure coincidence. So was the opportunity to see the corpse. Lestrade needed my help because he couldn't contact Phillips. That's all."
The man kept his eyes on them, expressing his dissatisfaction. He was not happy with the sudden awakening and the whole situation he had seen. Sherlock didn't look upset, what's more, he didn't pull away from his friend.
Mycroft looked at his brother.
"I wasn't surprised when Mr. Holmes said who he asked for help. I knew about his preferences for a long time and I heard who he was considering as his potential partner," she said, looking at John who was left without a word.
John sighed, rubbing his sleepy eyes. "I really don't want to go home," he said honestly. "I didn't argue with Sherlock, none of these things. I just ..."
"Did you know the penis has no bones and can still be easily broken?" he asked. "It's enough to grab it like that" with these words he twisted his hand slightly, "and bend it like a baguette. This can result in constant impotence and even death in some cases." John's fingers tightened. He could feel the pulsing under his fingers. Usually, it was enough for him to see the terrified eyes of his victim, but this time he really wanted to do more than just scare him. It took him a moment when the attack of anger passed and when he felt Sherlock's breath next to him, he released Stoner.
"Then ... Aaron ... where are we going?"
"A pen?". Sherlock raised an eyebrow and sighed in a bored tone.
John was surprised. He felt Sherlock was angry with him, but he couldn't remember if he had given him any reason. Besides, he rarely saw him angry. Sherlock got angry at Mrs. Hudson or Mycroft sometimes, but he expressed it by making sarcastic comments, but he didn't ignore them by showing a complete lack of reaction. Sherlock didn't act that way, that is why John was confused by his attitude, even more.
"I shouldn't be surprised you joined," he said. "But are you sure you do not want to go back to the hotel? After all, you hate this type of ..." he looked at his brother, "... legwork" he added with amusement.
"You surely remember this bothersome incident that happened twenty-six months ago," he said and looked into Mycroft's eyes. "Near the Gulf of Mexico."
He did not answer. He put the cup down on a small table with a serious face and shifted in his chair. "You came to convince me," he said calmly "that my feelings for John are exaggerated because of the rush and with the flow of emotions. That you suddenly opened your eyes and saw what I saw in him from the beginning. You will definitely try to convince me that you are on my side. And the fact that you want to take John away from me will not affect our relationship. And you will present it to me in a gentle form. As you usually do, when you deceive your co-workers with nice words that do not actually reflect the seriousness of the situation and decisions".
"Maybe, but your brother needs the attention and feelings of the other person, even if he does not want to admit it ... Just like you ".
He was sitting in a comfortable leather armchair. He turned off the lights above his head, so he could focus. The bright light only annoyed him when he thought about something very strongly. He forced himself not to tap his heel on the carpeted floor and not play with the phone he held tightly in his hand. He may have looked calm, but in reality, he was angry and impatient. He wanted to be at the hotel and see what the situation was. The view behind the small and wet window has not changed since the beginning of the flight. He could still see the same black space lit only by the small light of the cities below. When he looked at the cities outside the window, he knew where he was and how long he had to travel. Once in a while, a bolt of lightning striking struck the air next to the plane. He tried to focus his thoughts only on the view of cities and fields below because every memory of the reason why he actually flew to Venice droved him crazy.
John listened in silence. The cheerful mood vanished within a second. Nobody dared to say a word and it became clear to John that despite hope, Sebastian had not changed in those ten years. He was imperious, implacable, and extremely dangerous. In the coming weeks, they will find out about his true nature and the extent to which he may be a threat to them. John was sure of it. In silence and without taking his eyes off the ground, he followed the rest of the group.
It sobered him up. For the first time in a long time, he took a deep breath. He looked around and noticed that the two of them had indeed become the centre of attention of everyone around - both onlookers standing in windows and a few policemen, who searched the yard. He didn't take that kind of interest well. He preferred not to think about how their behaviour was perceived by others. True, they had done nothing wrong, but the fear of being judged was much greater for him right now than the fear people had felt since Jack the Ripper began prowling the streets of Whitechapel. To his great surprise, the detective didn't seem to care about Lestrade's words and anything else. It was true that he took a step back and increased the distance between them, but the expression on his face showed neither nervousness nor embarrassment. He was smiling with a raised corner of his mouth, and he was giving him cheeky looks. He had to admit that such nonchalance was very charming. The detective was confident, and that was one of the reasons why he felt a great admiration for him from the very beginning.
He grasped the man's words while watching his face slowly slide into the shadows. He started to feel weird. As if his body remained in place, and his soul and consciousness tried to break out of the ongoing inactivity. His hands were heavy, but he didn't control them as he handed the empty glass back to the stranger. The outside sounds were muffled, repeating fractions of a second apart. He was silent because he was afraid of what might come out of his mouth when he was like that. Apparently, this did not bother the man, for he was watching him again in his usual stillness.
"Oh, our doctor is up," she said, smiling broadly.
"I made a fool of myself by talking about our first meeting and everything else" he looked up at Francesca, who was sitting smiling and watching the reactions of both men. "Well, it doesn't matter now." He cast a quick glance at Mycroft. "I'm glad you decided to make me aware of it at least now," he added and focused his attention on the woman again. "I'm sorry for all these lies."
Genius was angry, or at least irritated. He tightly pressed his lips together, lowered his hands, and turned to the door. "I'm leaving. I'm late already ...".
John frowned. He didn't like the sound of Sherlock's voice. It was calm but a bit dark. For some time they did not show that they knew about the person following them. They walked quietly down the streets, past crowded cafes. To John's surprise, the sun was hidden behind low clouds, which allowed them to rest a little from the heat. Although he knew that it would not last long, because the clouds looked temporary, which, however, did not disturb his good mood. He got used to the heat as he used to do in Afghanistan. They managed to hide behind tall buildings just as the sun found a hole in a thick layer of clouds. They immediately came across a crowd of people. They came ashore from boats, motorboats, and gondolas. The others stood in line to catch the opportunity and get to the other side of the main canal. John, Sherlock, and Molly stood in the middle of the city, near one of the most recognizable attractions - the Rialto Bridge. The bridge was surrounded on each side by tourists who photographed it. Some stood on the shore, others took advantage of the fact that they were on the water and had the opportunity to see the bridge from a different perspective. The marina was full of shops, souvenir stands, and narrow eateries, where even a simple bottle of drink cost four times as much as in a normal store. Molly recognized this place as a paradise of souvenirs, which is why she informed Sherlock and John that she was going to spend a long time in this area to find the right gift.
He sighed. He realized how close he was now lying on the morgue table among the other dead people. That his good luck was slowly coming to an end. He had to be careful. He realized that had it not been for Holmes and the increasingly intimate bond between them, he would have thrown himself into the vortex of events and would probably have died in a very pathetic way. He decided to stay close to the detective from now on.
"You'll see," he said, smiling mysteriously.
He twitched as he felt Holmes's finger on his abdomen, even though he was wearing several layers of clothes. His muscles tightened as the detective made his way very slowly upward.
"Molly also told me" Greg rested his elbows on his legs and looked at the pavement under his boots, "that she saw a different side of you and Sherlock" his voice was not as sure as it had been a few moments ago. It was as if he was afraid of John's reaction, or ashamed of the direction of their conversation. "She said she didn't see Sherlock ever so focused on some task. And you so happy. She said a lot has happened between all three of you ... or the four of you, I should say." He shyly cast a glance at John. It was hard for him to deduce what he was thinking because his expression did not change. "Listen...".
John realized Aaron had been talking to him for some time.
"Don't worry about him. He tends to recite long monologues, but rarely says anything specific and meaningful."
"I will look for dry branches," he pointed at the part of the forest that went down the slope. "These are not good. They are too wet and would only fume if we threw them into the fire."
"Absolutely. Actually, John, everyone is hoping you would come," he said, looking at the doctor.
Francesca accepted the bouquet of daisies with a sincere smile. She disappeared for a moment to put flowers in one of the many vases, then joined the three men on the balcony. Her apartment as one of the few had a big terrace with table and chairs. The day was beautiful, the chairs comfortable and the wine cool. John used every minute he had to spend surrounded by Francesca, her husband, and calm and relaxed Mycroft. Dinner started with a nice conversation. Mr. Coletti opened a bottle of white wine, which John found a bit tart, but he did not complain about it. They talked about the last two weeks, about food from different parts of the world, travels, a passion for architecture and art. Mycroft didn't say much about the last topic. He was not a fan of theater, ballet or opera. He became interested in the conversation when the conversation turned to more political topics. Franco was also interested in this. John and Francesca listened to this exciting conversation for a while, but the doctor was completely lost after a few minutes. Fortunately, the knocking on the door interrupted the ongoing discussion. It turned out it was the waiters who brought dinner, ordered by Francesca. Four plates appeared on the table along with a new bottle of wine. The men quietly and silently disappeared from the apartment.
Aaron didn't look offended. He sat and stared at John with a funny expression. John could have sworn the man was barely able to restrain from laughing. After a moment, Stoner grinned and looked at John's body. He kept his eyes on his hard gaze and chuckled. The sound was annoying to John, though Aaron's voice was always pleasant and kind. It was one of the few things John liked in Stoner.
John wrapped his legs around Mycroft's waist and held his neck with his free arm. He tightened the muscles around the genius's penis and encouraged him to push. Mycroft made the first move. And another one. He pulled out and hit the sensitive spot with the next push. John sighed with pleasure, so Mycroft repeated the move.
"... almost a month ago and I already had the impression that there was something wrong with you ... now? I find it hard to accept that ...".
Mycroft pulled the door handle. "There is no need today." He doubted that sneaking made any sense. The conversation that lurked somewhere on the horizon must have happened. The surprise effect was not positive in this situation, it could only cause unnecessary tension. In the end, it has been a little over a day since returning from Venice, and it's quite a short time to visit someone without an invitation. Besides, Mycroft also knew he wasn't an awaited and welcomed guest. At least by one person. No. A furtive visit was out of the question. He sighed as he slammed the car door behind him and looked at the building's entrance. The gold number glowed against the black paint. The knocker hung skewed. As usual, he corrected it as he approached the door. He expected them to be open. The door swung open after turning the door handle. It smelled like always. Slightly musty wallpapers. Old wood. The smell of dust and chemicals that have soaked into the walls after so many years. He remembered well when he was worried about Sherlock's health. His passion for chemistry and experimentation often had disastrous effects at home. Fortunately, John was looking after him now. However, this did not bother Mycroft in controlling his brother. He knew every inch of the apartment by heart, and to relax a little before the upcoming confrontation, he focused his mind on imperfections and other details leading upstairs.
"He's talking to someone. I've been waiting for an hour ..." At that moment his stomach made a characteristic sound, which only meant his body was demanding food. He looked at Francesca. She smiled and snuggled tightly into his shoulder and then pulled him towards the stairs.
The meeting of politicians, advisers and other government figures from around the world lasted for over two hours. They were sitting behind a glass door, in a part of the hotel that John had not known before. The rest of the company - the wives, husbands, and partners of politicians - spent time talking in the restaurant. Some of them visited the hotel or gossiped at the bar. They had a good time, but for John this morning went on forever. He felt it was some form of punishment. Mycroft must have been aware that sitting idle in one place was the worst option for John. This senseless sitting for hours was supposed to show him who ruled in their relationship. Francesca saved John's situation. She was always with him and she looked after him, so it wasn't the worst possible punishment. That's why Mycroft's plan would fail, if not for one detail - John was terribly sleepy and tired. He had not slept in almost thirty hours, and his only desire was to get on the bed, close his eyes and cuddle up in the big, soft pillow. Such a lack of sleep would not impress him a few years earlier, because life in the army taught him that he could carry out his duties without rest. Sometimes two hours of sleep was enough for him, for the whole day. However, this skill faded with time, as did the other talents he acquired in Afghanistan.
The boy sniffed loudly, not caring about good manners. What's worse, he wiped his nose on his patched sleeve.  "I'd love to help you, sir, but business is business," he added with a smile.
Their argument was interrupted by John's voice.
"I take your word for it," he said seriously as if the little flower he had forgotten had the highest value for him. Maybe it really was. "Then, show me what you learned from these videos," he said seductively, among the sounds of an approaching storm.
"Oh, let's not be so formal, John. We have known each other for some time now ..." he said with a smile.
The man looked at him quickly. "Watson!" there was slight disbelief and joy in his voice.
Mycroft looked at him intensely, then turned his body toward him and stood at a very uncomfortable distance.
Mycroft blinked and straightened up with his arms folded. "And what would that look like?" he asked with a slight smile, which was supposed to make the doctor realize how wrong this idea was. "Can you imagine me eating pizza in worn jeans, a stretched shirt with some banal inscription and a camera hanging around my neck?"
He agreed with Holmes. The first thing that caught his eye was a small yard, from which there was no other way out than to go through the same door they had entered. The murderer had to consider the fact that someone might notice him at any moment. "So the killer has to be very confident ..." he said, which caught the attention of the detective, "... determined, but most of all ... crazy."
"So I'm just a thing for you?" he asked without taking his eyes off the mask. He didn't see the consternation on his friend's face when he asked the question, yet he felt Sherlock tense and froze without a word. "I mean ... one of the things Mycroft can take away from you. You said so yourself this morning." John looked at his friend only now. His eyes must have been filled with sadness or pain because Sherlock blinked quickly and immediately looked away. He wondered how he should answer, but John spoke first.
"You think I'm glad to be separated from Mr. Holmes, and I don't have to ... as you said, train my patience and self-abnegation. However, the truth is that Mr. Holmes asked me to act incognito. I am not happy to follow the instructions I get over the cell phone. I'd rather hear what I should do face to face. "
The minutes passed slowly. He was getting bored of watching the dust in the air visible in streams of light sliding from exposed windows. He could call Mycroft and tell him about his arrival. If he wanted, he could arrange to meet him at a specific time and place. However, he was aware that his every move was closely monitored. He knew that Mycroft knew exactly where he was at the moment. That's why he waited patiently in his office. He wasn't going to disturb him in meetings or other things. He knew Sherlock's older brother would come when he had time. It wasn't even a quarter of an hour when he finally heard footsteps in the corridor and a muffled conversation. The door to the room opened without a murmur. Mycroft and some man stood in the door. He was tall with slightly graying hair. He had very bright eyes and a nice smile. John remembered it was probably the same man he had seen that day at Buckingham Palace. He stood upright in the middle of the room.
There was no living soul in the area. If, however, someone were there, they would see four people sitting on the bridge overlooking the main canal, and a beautiful sunrise. Molly slowly ate melting ice cream. She licked her wrist from time to time and waved her legs like a little girl. Sherlock sat nonchalantly. He explained something to John with a smile. He brushed his hair back from his forehead and spoke all the time. The doctor sat with his arms crossed and listened to his friend with amusement. He followed the things pointed out by the younger genius. He was cooling his legs over the water flowing below. Mycroft, however, did not look like usual. He had an unbuttoned shirt, rolled up sleeves and a flower behind his ear, and his face was flushed. It was obvious he wasn't too sober although he didn't show it. He put his left hand on cool stones behind him. In this way, he tried to keep balance and relieve his spine a little. He rubbed his tired face with his other hand.
"I want to get to know you more, John. Mycroft told me a lot, but it's still not enough. My husband like you too. He has a meeting with Mycroft and others today, but ..."
"Are they Stoner's people?" he asked.
"This must be very confusing for you right now," said the man, taking two tall glasses and a small bottle from his bag. "All this Mystery. Stress. Insecurity..." he continued, opening the bottle.
Among the small coins, a comb, a dirty mirror, and a key lay a broken lamp still stained with blood. A broken cane with small pieces of wood around it, and even a few splinters neatly arranged on a handkerchief.
"John, focus!" he said with a slight hint of annoyance.
He grabbed the book and looked at it several times. "So you say I don't know how to behave like a gentleman?" he asked in a rough tone, which did not bode well.
"I'm going to talk to the hotel manager, John. Please take your time with your meal".
John had seen angry Mycroft several times, but this time the atmosphere was overwhelming him. He hesitantly entered the darkroom and closed the elegant and heavy door behind him. He watched the genius. Mycroft emptied the glass in a few sips, then put it back in its place and rested his hands on the chair, leaning forward. The silence was terrifying. John could hear his heart beating and the sound of his footsteps when he decided to approach Mycroft. He crossed his arms and stopped just behind the other man.
Even that turned out to be too much for him. The news of not one, but two murdered women completely took away his appetite. Each bite carried a sense of guilt, self-loathing. He ate, breathed while innocent women died at night in the dirty streets of Whitechapel. He was so close. So close to catching the Ripper... His fingers tightened on the silver knife. The currant marmalade ran down the blade looking like blood, and the steaming tea warmed his skin like a murderer's breath. The previous night, filled with disgust, frustration and anger, had left a permanent mark on his memory. There was only one way to overcome the rage that was building within him. He should bring the murderer to justice. When Holmes informed him that they should leave, he followed him without a word, leaving his breakfast almost untouched. He barely noticed the creaking stairs, the buzzing of people, the tilting carriage and the smell of horses' hair.
"Oh?" he was curious, so he paused and waited patiently for his next words.
"All right. Enough for this demonstration, Mr Holmes," Lestrade interrupted. He has been watching them in silence with a red flush on his face. He was still on his knees next to Annie Chapman's legs. "I must admit that I did not expect such a turn of events, but restrain your imagination, please. People are watching us," he added more quietly, lifting his eyes and looking at the nearby buildings.
John pursed his lips. He only dreamed of crawling under light and thin blanket and separating himself from the entire surrounding world, especially from the grumpy Mycroft and the crazy Sherlock.
"Good morning, Mr. Stoner."
"Umm! H-ha!" Mycroft kept fucking him. With his mouth open stuck to his temples, he was losing control more and more. He held him tightly with his arm until he finally groaned loudly. "Aaah!" He shivered and came in John's hole, thrusting his penis a few more times, but this time slower and gentler.
Francesca made a small giggle and shook her head. Meanwhile, Molly approached them and stood next to Sherlock. She always was shy, that's why she surprised John when she came up to his friend and stood next to him very close. She almost brushed him with her body. But Sherlock's reaction was even stranger. It was true, he never made gestures that would offend women, he did not move away, he did not jerk, he only stood elegantly in place and left only when he had a reason. This time, however, he neither moved away from her at a more comfortable distance, but he also smiled at her in some unusual way. John felt a strange feeling in his stomach, so he looked away.
"What about me?" John asked, breaking the awkward silence.
"I agree. I will be your pretended husband."
"Curiosity was too big," he finished and raised the corner of his mouth. When his eyes met Sherlock, he smiled and crossed his arms over his chest, imitating the attitude of a young woman. There was a long silence between them. For a strange reason, John turned his head and looked as if he was looking at something across the hall. Sherlock did not understand the reason for this unusual behavior, but before he had time to deduce something, he heard the voice of a woman whom he had been watching for some time.
"You old wanton". She was laughing. She put the phone to her ear, massaging the burning spot in her lower back. As soon as she heard her friend's voice, she smiled even wider. "Francesca! Finally. I was slowly beginning to doubt you would call. Tell me." She immediately switched to Italian. She had no problem to do it just like her sons.
The song didn't end but Lucy quickly got up from the stump. She ran a few steps. She leaned her hand on the tree, leaned, and vomited. Everyone looked at her in shock, but the most surprised of them was Josh.
He was grateful, she finally understood his signals. He did not intend to answer her attempts to chat, and although it was not right for him to plug his ears, he was relieved when the cabin went quiet. He could focus on the only reason he set out on this journey. He could also analyze all possible scenarios that were to result from his sudden arrival. He smiled at the thought, but on the other hand, he felt an incomprehensible nervousness that did not leave him until the end of the flight.
"They're all for you." John might have been able to successfully hide slight jealousy in his voice, but he was betrayed by a frown and a quiet sigh.
"Did he do that?" John was surprised. He looked back and gave his friend a warm smile, which Sherlock immediately returned.
Holmes looked ahead with a thoughtful, distant gaze. He was stroking his chin with two fingers. He did not react to the taunts of children who ran to their hansom cab with outstretched hands. Nor did he react to the smell wafting in Whitechapel, or to the sudden and rough vibrations of the carriage. "Why were you there?"
John clearly saw Mycroft was in a good mood, even now when he read the messages he got from his brother. They both walked slowly through the main hall and enjoyed the pleasant coolness. The temperature outside was almost unbearable, that's why John was happy when Mycroft decided he could stay in the apartment today and not accompany him to conferences.
John was playing with the ring on his finger. Although maybe the word 'playing' was not accurate. He tried to turn the ring around its axis, but his fingers were swollen, just like his feet. His phone made a noise, but he never once looked at it. He didn't feel well and didn't want to read messages from Sherlock who was angry with him for not answering since the morning. Sherlock had the right to be angry because John had forgotten the phone and only after returning to the hotel he did realize his friend had unsuccessfully sought his attention.
"For God's sake, John! Act your age! You are no longer a child. Running away from problems won't solve anything! I know you leave Baker Street after quarrels and this is your way to relieve tension, but you can't do it every time! " Mycroft couldn't stand it. For the first time, he let negative emotions prevail over him in John's presence. But John didn't look scared. He stood with a hard face, tightly closed lips and frowns. He stared at him, but he didn't seem like he was about to leave the room.
Worst of all, however, was that John slowly realized why the Holmes brothers were acting in such strange and suspicious ways. It took him a while to understand they were waiting for his decision. The thought of it hit him and almost knocked him off his feet. Was he going to decide what to do next? He? Why did they leave this type of decision in his hands, or rather on his shoulders? What was he supposed to do? What decision to make? Did they really think it was okay with him? Where did the idea come from that ... what indeed? That he would choose one of them? It was beyond his strength. Recently, his unfulfilled dream was to get closer to Sherlock. He dreamed of hugging him and maybe even kissing his beautiful lips. He knew it was unreal and out of his reach. And Mycroft? He had never ever thought of him THIS way. How could he? Older Holmes had always been cool and hard to approach, and the idea that he might want more from someone seemed absurd to John. Still, two weeks were enough to completely turn his life and reasoning upside down. Suddenly Sherlock's arms became more real. If he wanted to, he might have known the taste of his mouth for a long time. Who knows, maybe he would also dare to finally confess to him his hidden feelings? It was even stranger with Mycroft. He not only got used to his touch but also learned that he could be jealous and strangely possessive. At the thought of his fierce kisses and strong arms, which, with gentleness and firmness, would not let him go, John felt pleasant shivers down his spine. He realized that in a dozen or so days he got to know them better than in all the years together. It turned out that Sherlock looks at him differently than before, and Mycroft wants more than the theatrical holding hands in the company of other people. The idea that he had to decide what he liked more was unacceptable.
Mycroft's slight hesitation was proof that John's words were reaching his ears. But after a moment, he returned to the normal rhythm of clicking on the keyboard. John did not give up. He learned, he had to be patient when he talked to Holmes brothers.
Mycroft's secrecy and his foresight made John feel safe knowing that he was in charge of the government.
"I'm sure you have seen worse things in Afghanistan as a military doctor," the detective continued.
"Exactly", the detective straightened and walked around the table. "For this reason, right after breakfast, we will go to the morgue to examine the two freshest bodies and their personal belongings."
A faint sound of amusement escaped from Holmes's throat. He was standing right next to the sofa.
John carefully took every step. He was holding Molly's left hand. She was right behind him. "Do you know where Mycroft is?" he asked Sherlock.
"Something important?" John asked.
They looked at each other for a long time. None of them wanted to give up, although it was clear that Sherlock was more determined to achieve his goal. Mycroft looked discreetly from side to side. "We have a problem with our mutual friend," he said and knew that Sherlock immediately understood who he was talking about. "Apparently, he was far more organized than we could have imagined. You were sure that you were able to destroy his organization, but our spies have learned that some places are still functioning and are doing good. So good that further procrastination may end badly. We need to find these hiding places and end Moriarty's story for good. "
"I have never met such a woman ..."
"Everything according to the plan?" Mycroft asked, walking over to John and shaking his hand in greeting.
"Oh, I understand" the detective's lips curved into a sly smile. "So the game is still afoot" he added quieter. He looked pleased, almost excited. "Satisfying your curiosity, Watson...," he added, "I also prefer to avoid interacting with people, especially if they are boring and not very intelligent... I prefer solitude."
This time he looked around the large living room. At first, he thought he had broken into the wrong apartment. The couch was skewed, the corner of the cream carpet was rolled up, piles of documents were lying around and the windows were only half-covered. The mess did not suit the character of his brother, who valued cleanliness and order. However, all his doubts were dispelled when he sniffed for the first time. He felt two familiar smells. They were mixed, but each of them was very characteristic. A friendly and calming fragrance that made him feel at home. Second irritating, causing him frustration and traumatic memories. It became obvious to him that he had reached his destination. There was no sign of his friend or brother anywhere. Of course not. Whoever would like to spend the night in the living room, when in the other room had a comfortable ... bed.
"Mycroft ..." John gave him a pitying look. "... eat something more. You can't be satisfied with this small amount of pasta." He looked into the eyes of the older genius and slightly waved the pizza in front of his nose. He ignored his face, which expressed disgust at what lay on the plate. He was aware that this type of meal was not a very common dish in Mycroft's kitchen and that he considered it not elegant enough. However, he was convinced that at the moment his stomach needed a bit more food. "Please," he added, which eventually softened Mycroft's face.
Instead of this, Mycroft clenched his teeth even more. "There is no point in having this conversation, John. There was a sudden change in plans, so you need to bring your appearance to order as soon as possible ..." Mycroft calmed down a bit and showing his total indifference towards John, turned on his heel and looked at his watch.
Before he answered, John grabbed a pile of branches, which he dropped during Sebastian's attack. "Exactly. Ten years ... And you still don't understand anything."
He looked away from the doctor to stare at Lestrade, who gave him an impatient look. If it was not for the man's name, he would have been prepared to assume that this was the detective that the inspector was talking about a dozen or so minutes earlier. He watched Dr Phillips unhurriedly fixing his glasses and opening his notebook, then focuses his gaze on the corpse with total and immeasurable indifference.
Russell Square was a charming place. The large garden allowed spending time alone away from the crowds, and a large number of trees and shrubs calmed down even the most exhausted nerves. Mycroft noticed that John visited the park quite often, after serious quarrels with Sherlock, and when he had some free time, to meet old friends. So he concluded that this would be the most appropriate place to 'kidnap' him from the street and at the same time not expose him to sinister glances because the sight of a familiar park would have a calming effect on him. As the black car rolled slowly down the street, Mycroft saw John walking in the opposite direction. The driver knew his employer, so without a word he drove towards him and stopped the car next to the pavement. If John was surprised when he saw the car, he skilfully hid it. He stopped, looked at the black car and got in without a word. The moment the car started to move, the driver pressed the button and the soundproof glass separated him from the two men who were sitting in silence in the back seat of the car.
"Nothing important?" asked John. "Then leave it now," he added and shut down Mycroft's laptop. The room went dark. Both men froze and, despite the silence, John could hear the blood pulsing in his head. After a moment, the older man sighed and opened his laptop. He stared at  John's eyes with a mixture of provocation and indifference, waiting for his reaction.
"Please, don't panic, Mrs. Hudson," he sighed and comforted her. "Your floor is safe."
Mycroft was silent, staring at Aaron with a fierce face and slightly narrowed eyes. "And what if you make the data public? How will it let you... seduce him?" he asked.
Mycroft was silent, but not for long. He slowly got up from the chair and went to the door to take his shoes. He put them on his feet without hurry and returned to the table. He didn't care about the carpet. It was enough for him to look at the floor when he came into the room for the first time and knew that the carpet was as Persian as the musclehead was stupid. When he returned to the table, he raised an empty glass and took his things. His eyes met Stoner. He never took his eyes from him. Even when he took the CD off the table and straightened up.
He immediately got up and approached his friend, making room for the doctor who had just arrived.
"Good morning, John. What can I get you? asked the owner when both men took their seats.
They passed the narrow streets and squeezed among the crowds of tourists who occupied the main streets. The smells of bars and restaurants were in the air. John and Sherlock passed the theater and a small bridge. At one point, John felt Sherlock's touch on his shoulder. He rubbed John gently with his arm. It would not be anything unusual if it wasn't for the fact that this kind of closeness was becoming more common. Strangely enough, there was no crowd around. John did not comment and refrained from giving him a questioning look. It didn't bother him, so he walked without a word. When they entered the main promenade by the canal, he slightly moved away from his friend. But Sherlock clung to his body again. Every now and then he grabbed his elbow and switched sides as he passed behind him. They rubbed their fingers and hands, and John was becoming more confused and intrigued. After another unsuccessful attempt to distance himself from his friend, he stood still and turned to him.
Oh yes. He remembered the cluttered rooms and professors' offices perfectly well. Shelves full of various artefacts and dusty books. University offices were full of rare collections.
He wrinkled his nose. He wasn't sure how to start the conversation with Holmes. He also did not know if he was still angry with him, or happy about the upcoming meeting. He wanted to accuse him of delay and lack of news. On the other hand, the detective had a lot of things to do, including the Ripper investigation. It was a stressful task and took a lot of time. He shouldn't have pressed. Most importantly, he managed to get things done and could move to Baker Street today to start a new and exciting life with a one-of-a-kind detective.
"You could feel ... confused if I told you now. Patience, please" Sherlock added mysteriously, looking at John.
"And the chance that we all will come back home?" This time ladies' man spoke. His voice did not hide his fears but he wanted to know.
"My brother is always trying to annoy me. And he often succeeds. Unfortunately. Now he tries to do it even stronger because you are with me. I guess he will never get bored of these games..." he mumbled the last sentence into his cup. When he took the last sip, he straightened up and sighed
"Yes, I know. Francesca showed me this part of the city. We were here ..." John paused for a moment and looked at the waitress who placed two glasses of water in front of them.
The car was silent. Neither Mycroft nor John spoke anymore. They both tried to calm down after what had happened. Actually, after what didn't happen. Mycroft regretted not being able to control himself. He was worried about Sherlock's reaction because it was certain that his younger brother would guess what had happened. He was also afraid that this would be his last opportunity to feel John's lips. He still wasn't sure what he would decide, and the prospect of spending the next days in doubt frightened him. He couldn't deduce what John was thinking when he looked at him. The doctor was looking at the buildings, shops and streets they passed. He rubbed his face and clenched his fingers on his left knee. When they arrived back at Baker Street, John sat for a moment, then finally looked at Mycroft, grabbing the door handle. He didn't say a word. He made no gesture. He opened the door and got out of the car. Before he disappeared from Mycroft's view, he leaned over and looked inside the car. He opened his mouth, ready to say something. He didn't do it. He closed the door quietly and entered the building.
He nodded, but the pathologist didn't react. She just gripped her arm tighter and narrowed her eyes even more.
"John, it looks like we won't be seeing each other until evening," he said.
He frowned. He didn't like the lightness with which the boy spoke about the murder. "When did you find out? Where exactly did it happen?" he asked, trying to concentrate despite the noise of the crowd and snorting horses.
. Or he would stay with
The inspector saw the change on his face. He was relieved that this conversation was over. "Alright!" he said aloud, patted his knee, and looked at his watch. "No more sitting here and scaring old women. Come on, I'll give you a ride home."
Aaron looked at him ironically. "Myc, if pride could turn into a human figure, yours would embarrass the Statue of Liberty."
"Buon giorno, signore. Welcome to our hotel. Unfortunately, I can not provide information about our guests, but if it is something important and you wish to meet Mr. Holmes, I can make a call ..." the receptionist grabbed the phone, but before he could dial the number, he saw a large bag that landed quietly right in front of his face on the counter in the porter's lodge.
The offer did not surprise him, but the time and place did. Does Mycroft want to distract him from the worries caused by Sherlock? It wasn't like him. He was glad of the invitation, but the thought of having to spend the whole evening with Stoner was the last thing he wanted to do. Since the day had not started well enough, and there were only less than two days left to the end of the trip, he decided to spend it in such a way as to avoid all possible situations that could upset him. He made an appointment with Molly and Sherlock, but he couldn't cancel it.
"Let my people know where I am" he insisted.
Sherlock smiled even wider, and it was because John may have sounded serious, but his expression was proof of something else. His friend was in a very good mood and teased him. "You may not have noticed, but lately I am increasingly beginning to consider this mood as an indispensable aspect of our lives." He surprised John. He saw it in his eyes. "I also came to the conclusion that I like it," this time he had to look away because the complete confusion on his friend's face almost made him laugh. He didn't want to spoil the moment for anything, that's why he put the violin under his chin. "I became convinced that being with another person helps to acquire some of their qualities. You are romantic, so it's probably obvious that I've started to notice and enjoy things that you value." He wanted to see if John understood his words and their message, but for the even greater effect, he decided to add something that must have completely surprised his friend. "Many couples experience the same phenomenon."
Holmes was calm. He showed no emotion, even his breath showed nothing. He looked at Aaron, who was pleased with himself and he waited for his decision.
"If only you could see it, John. The whole floor was sticking with some purple dust. All because of his experiments."
"Ex-soldiers too?"
"There is no point in going back to the party," said John, briskly walking down the stairs.
Holmes folded the newspaper, staring at the cups she had brought. "This is Mrs Hudson, Watson. Our landlady."
Mycroft looked at them but nodded towards the waiter. He should expect the last evening in Venice to cost him dearly, especially since he wasn't alone. He rarely allowed himself such expenses, but in the current situation, he did not want to behave differently. Soon, the waiting time for meals was enhanced by three bottles of expensive wine and the pleasant sounds of mandolin accompanying a pair of violins. John had to admit that Mycroft had a taste. The heavy and very intense taste of Valpolicella cheered the mood up after the first sip. He knew that the last night in Venice was to be a pleasant experience for them, which was facilitated by the amount of alcohol in each glass. So he enjoyed every slurp, drawing Sherlock's attention at some point.
"Take that hand away," he said in a voice full of bitterness and anger. But he spoke quietly and calmly. He looked pointedly at his brother's forearm, possessively wrapped around John's chest.
"Let's go" Sebastian's firm voice echoed quietly in the ravine, drowned out only by the whistling of the wind and the trees rustling in the distance.
John frowned, not quite understanding what Mycroft wanted to say. He blinked several times before taking a glass of orange juice. An awkward silence fell between them. John tried to focus on what he heard. That was weird. This type of care did not suit to Mycroft and John had the impression that he was the object of his game. Although, on the other hand, he felt an incomprehensible warmth in his heart when he thought that maybe Mycroft's behavior was not artificial and that he was not as a thick-skinned man as he wanted to be. Sherlock and Mycroft were similar, and for a strange reason, John could get along with each of them.
He sank into his thoughts so much, he barely realized when they started landing. He acted like a machine when he got into a private car, that was standing and waiting for them on the airport lane. He did not think about his actions, he was simply guided by instincts. Luggage, the presence of other people, the rest of the way - he did not care about these things in the slightest. Even as he drove through the famous Ponte della Libertà road his thoughts revolved around the only person for whom he left an interesting case and who would sum up this fact just by rolling his eyes. While his companion watched the storm move away from the city, he watched the train quickly overtake their car. He wished he had chosen the train, he would have arrived much earlier.
Seeing Mycroft and John, one of the bodyguards nodded slightly in greeting, without saying a word. John noticed a slight relief on his face.
John hesitated for a moment with an answer. "You could say so". He approached the fire. He sat down next to Sherlock and threw a pile of dry branches under his feet. He saw that his friend was watching him intensely.
John remembered the conversation they had a few days ago. He knew what she was talking about, which made him want to sink to the ground. "It's true" he stammered and thought for a moment, "he impressed me."
"Dear Lord. How these people can function here?" Lestrade wondered aloud, making this kind of comments from time to time.
"... Grazie, signora," he added and looked at Stoner again. Aaron never took his eyes off him, just watched him with that gleam in his eyes and an insolent smile on his face. "Francesca and I have been here recently. She is a wonderful woman and I am not surprised even Mycroft likes her," he said, then reached for one of the glasses.
"Molly, can't you see how fat this cat is?" Sherlock asked. "It's probably the tourists' fault," he muttered.
"Well done". John nodded slowly. He had to admit that the view from a moment ago was pitiable, but amused him a little. "The perfect end to a charming trip. It was probably a sign that it's time to go back."
