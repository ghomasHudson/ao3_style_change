A weight lifts off Dean’s shoulders as he steps outside. He catches sight of Castiel crossing the street, and his heart does a funny flip. And that’s when he realizes Castiel is making his way over to the store. Well, it’s a little bittersweet now, but it’s hard to focus on that with Castiel looking at him like he hung the moon.
Castiel clears his throat and draws back a little, putting a few more inches between them. Now that they’re not breathing each other’s air, Dean’s head clears. The world is a little less sweeter, a little more colder, and only getting worse the longer he’s not pressed up against Castiel.
More importantly, he should be working, but he lacks the drive. He doesn't think he's ever felt so restless and distracted before. Even on days when he has to survive without caffeine, he can put his nose to the grindstone and carry on. His work may not be particularly thrilling, but he derives satisfaction from putting in effort and seeing the results of a job well done. For the past few weeks, however, he has been lacking in his usual laser-like focus. Instead, his attention is drawn to his phone. And Dean. Case in point. His phone buzzes with a response, and he lets his computer idle as he reads Dean's text.
Embarrassment scalds through Castiel when he realizes he’s pretty much half hard, and he drops the phone on the nightstand before turning away. It doesn’t mean anything, he tells himself. Arousal isn’t a bad thing in and of itself. It’s totally natural. It happens to everyone. Besides, it’s not like he sought this out or initiated it. More importantly, he’s not going to do anything about it. Other than curl up on himself and forget about it, of course.
“No one,” Cas says firmly, and picks up the next card. “Have you ever caught me masturbating or having sex? What did you do?” For the first time since this started, Cas appears reluctant to meet Dean’s gaze.
“It wasn’t my intention to upset her.” Cas’ shoulders hunch defensively. “Anyway, Dean got me out of there. We got burgers. And we decided to room together. And I realized I’d found someone special that day.”
“No, it’s Charlie,” Castiel lies, before he can think of something better. He gets to his feet. “She’s been having some… relationship trouble.”
Dean blushes. He feels unprepared and underdressed for this conversation, so he tries to hide behind his mug.
“We’re feeling a little left out here,” Charlie says with a grin, and she drags Kevin and Castiel into the hug.
Castiel reaches out to thread their fingers together. “Do you want to split the chocolate chip pancakes with me? We’ll get the combo. Eggs, bacon and sausage?”
Other times, it’s hard to believe Castiel, who comes off as shy and kind of a sore thumb, is a goddamn tiger in the sack. (Or at least, his foreplay game is outta this world. It definitely leaves Dean aching and hungry for more, waking up from filthy dreams and jerking desperately in the shower.)
“I just didn't think,” he mumbles, ashamed. He’s not good enough, but at this point he can't bring himself to say it. “I can't be a cop, Sheriff Mills.”
Life with Daphne is painstakingly nice. They eat dinner together, make small talk about their day, and sort out bills and chores. Then Castiel runs out of things to say. He kisses Daphne’s cheek and all but flees to his room to read before bed. Lather, rinse, repeat.
Castiel’s heart skips a beat, then hammers furiously. He swallows, but his mouth is dry all of a sudden. Dean feels the same way. But his happiness is short lived. He breathes out shakily. He’s pictured this moment so many times, and he’s still unprepared for it.
“What, then?” Castiel demands. “Should I lock you in hell forever? Lock myself in heaven forever? Let every human that dies be trapped in the veil forever? I don’t know what the answer is, but it’s not letting you punish yourself. I dragged you out of hell, Dean. I’m never throwing you back in there. And I won’t let you or anyone else do it.”
Castiel pants at the onslaught of pleasure, nosing further between Dean’s legs. He licks a swathe along Dean’s perineum and Dean groans.
“You were running away,” Castiel says. With the words, a weight settles in his chest. It sinks its claws into his heart and begins to radiate an ache.
“Come on.” Dean’s voice is gentle, like he’s talking to a lost, scared creature. “Let’s get some food in you.”
He slides his thumb over the black letters, thinking about the way his name sounded in Castiel’s rich, gravelly voice.
“Ya think I don’t know that?” Bobby picks up the book and starts assessing the damage. “I’m answering the calls from hunters that are dying out there. Stopping you and your idjit brother from running after archangels. I get it. Quit whining.”
Dean clears his throat. “Sam called. He’s reached Bobby’s, so they’re working on the whole stairway to heaven thing.”
Castiel grins, sitting up and shuffling forward. Beneath him Dean whines, this big, lazy, insolent heathen in his bed. Castiel turns to face Dean, then spreads his legs open to settle between them. He pushes Dean’s legs up to his chest, and bends to kiss him. Once, he’s comfortably positioned, he reaches for the lube.
“Fine,” he huffs. “Whatever. You’re hired, son. You start Monday.” He glares at Sheriff Mills. “You come in here just to bust my balls or you actually got any business?”
“Okay. Um, I’m Castiel Novak, a graduate student. I’m working on a double masters in math and religious studies. I have five siblings, and I’m the second youngest. When I’m not working on my thesis, I enjoy running and knitting.” He lets out a breath softly. “How was that?”
“Please don’t,” he says wearily, even though he knows there’s little he can say to deter her at this point.
Dean looks up, startled to hear Castiel’s voice. The morning rush has dwindled without Dean realizing, and now Castiel is standing in front of him in a freaking sweater vest under a flasher trench coat. The look does interesting things to Dean; he’s torn between horny and amused.
when his phone beeps. And doesn’t stop. It just goes on lighting up in rapid succession. Castiel picks it up and watches the texts flood in.
“Of course.” Castiel waits for her to turn away from him and zips up the back of her dress. Her skin is pale and smooth beneath the grey dress, and a black bra strap cuts a sharp line beneath her shoulder blades. He’s done this for her before, of course, but it occurs to him that he’s never undressed her. He’s never seen her naked. He can’t remember if they ever even took their tops off in front of each other. He can’t remember if he ever even wanted to.
“Move, Cas. My arm’s asleep,” Dean grumbles sleepily, trying to extricate himself from Castiel’s Octo-grip.
But Castiel stops him. “Thank you, Dean, but there’s more. It’s in Chicago. Once I get a car, the commute is an hour from here.”
“No, it’s not that,” Castiel stammers. “It’s just late, and I figured you were probably tired and wanted to go to bed.”
Castiel can’t help but smile at the teasing praise. Dean always knows just how to put him at ease. He leans back against the headboard, already feeling a little more comfortable.
Risa’s bruise is purple and swollen but she looks well-rested. Dean’s cuts are bandaged but he has shadows beneath his eyes.
Castiel checks the time on the cell phone Dean had handed him. 3:27 AM. For a dark, frightening moment, the futility of the situation overwhelms Castiel. It’s over.
“Right. Alright. I think we should go back to the station,” he suggests, squirming in discomfort before settling down. “They might have some answers for us.”
Sheriff Mills heads straight over to Dean. “Kid, you’re looking for a job? Why didn’t you tell me? I told you to call me!” She glances at Bobby. “And you. You turned him away?” she demands.
“Worked it out?” Ash asks, when Dean steps up behind the counter looking less annoyed, and more ready to face another day in retail hell.
It’s Jane, bearing a plate of food. It has cooled considerably, so the smell of it doesn’t assault Castiel. Still, he tips some of the tablets into his hand and throws them back. Jane sets the plate on his nightstand. It’s toast slathered with peanut butter. Chunky peanut butter. He’s not fond of chunks.
Castiel opens his mouth, searching for the words. Finally he settles on, “Without you they’d all be dead.”
Castiel rolls his eyes and sighs. He should never have told Dean about this. It was one thing to fantasize about a sexy– okay, fine. About
“Yes.” Castiel takes a breath and it is already lighter.  He hesitates, holding a breath as he watches Dean’s hand slip under the robe. Breathing becomes difficult again. “Is this what humans do?”
The world. It's about the world. In the fucking toilet. It's not just him. It's never just him. If it was, he'd hunker down in a ditch somewhere and die. He's so tired. He rests his forehead on the steering wheel, sweats and breathes.
Human though he is, he still stands rock still. His movements are still so precise, so utilitarian. Secret, traitorous, disquiet voices within Dean wish for Cas to learn, or at least affect mannerisms. He wishes cas would just run a hand through that mess that passes for hair. Or worry the wrinkled wound of his mouth with his teeth, or even just shift his gaze to trace the walls.
The closest Castiel can come to the feeling is the memory of Dean’s face, lit by the glow of the burning ring of holy oil. Dean, red and gold and betrayed and let down and hoping against hope, asking, “Where were you?”
Castiel looks down, frazzled. “Oh. Thank you, Dean.” He grimaces in frustration, trying (and failing miserably) to fix the tie. “I hate ties, but I’m going to the job fair.”
The weight of Dean’s gaze flattens him but he doesn't look away. Castiel knows he has no proof of abilities to back up the claim. He still struggles with accuracy of aim when it comes to firearms and his reflexes are slow. Not to mention the greatest hindrance: he’s still recovering from their latest encounter with the Croats. The silence that falls over the group is tense.
A heaviness settles over Castiel. It’s a cold, wet dread. It’s one thing to walk around pretending he’s still an angel, but now he realizes they’ve known all along that he’s lost his powers. He’s not an angel, but Castiel realizes numbly that he’s not quite human either.
Despite the depressing train of thought on his mind, Castiel smiles. Seeing Dean talk so casually about meeting him sends a warm, fuzzy curl of happiness through him. He has wanted to meet Dean for some time now, but had no idea how to ask or suggest it. To know that Dean has not only felt that way, but also felt comfortable enough to make plans… it feels good. And it emboldens Castiel to reciprocate.
It’s not just stupidity. It’s arrogance. Winchester arrogance. Castiel can already see the cogs in Sam’s brains whirring. He thinks he can take on Lucifer. Or that he has to die trying. That leaves them nowhere. It also takes their next best shot– Dean– out of commission.
Castiel looks up, emboldened by the certainty in Dean’s voice. Then Dean starts to laugh bitterly, and Castiel is on uneven footing again. He doesn’t know how to feel and he’s not even a little bit hungry, so he waits for Dean to elaborate.
A big aching part of Dean wants to say something reassuring. It’s the part that wants them to breakfast together at the bunker. The part that wants to see Cas swagger into a hunt, in all his human mortality, with the confidence that Dean has his back. Something like, I know. It gets worse before it gets better. But the truth is, Cas doesn’t need his empty reassurances. Doesn’t need the bullshit credit cards. Dean’s been on the road long, but there can’t be anything he knows that Cas hasn’t already seen or heard.
It almost works too well. In fact, Cas is so absorbed in what he’s watching (infomercials again) that he doesn’t flinch or even respond when Dean cleans the cuts. Dean checks for swelling or stiffness along the ugly, purpling bruise that tattoos Cas’ wrist, but it’s just a bad sprain.
“And I’m telling you I got a job for you.” She socks him in the arm playfully, but Dean just shakes his head and scans her things.
“You need a haircut,” Dean says, voice echoing and floating. He runs a hand through Castiel’s hair. Then he’s gone.
It’s a nice memory. Dean kissing him against the side of his car, cupping his cheek gently, murmuring, “... I think you’re really fucking cute, so I’ll let it pass.”
“Gimme that,” Dean says, grabbing the phone out of Castiel’s hand and pressing a button. Sam’s voice fills the car.
Castiel feels a weird pang when he reads that. The other thing… meaning sex? He chews his lip, debating texting back, but he can see that the guy’s not done, so he waits.
Castiel has a peculiar way of talking, like he’s not used to going so long in front of a willing audience. And he’s awkward. Sometimes he’s serious and bashful, and other times, he has a totally offbeat sense of humor and is adorably nerdy. Halfway through the first year since Castiel moved here, Dean starts to admit to himself that he has a crush.
Dean sighs and hangs his head. “This is like, top ten worst first date conversations, but… you know what? Yeah. And no. I mean, it's stupid. Which is probably why Charlie tried to get me out here. I was— I didn't even know what the guy looks like. It was just texts, but there was something there, man. Or I thought there was. And I jumped the gun and screwed it up.” He lets out a bitter laugh. “Which, you should know is a theme, by the way. With me. Screwing things up Anyway, he said he needed time and… I took it badly. I went out, got drunk. Lost my phone. And it's been a while, and I haven't heard from him. I thought we'd at least be friends, you know?”
The truth is, he probably knew at some point. They must’ve scrubbed it when they slashed his tether to the Host.
“Dammit,” Dean grumbles. It was Thanksgiving; the one night he wanted off. He knows he can trust Jo to have his back, but there was only so much she can do when their asshole manager, Crowley, has a stupid vendetta against Dean.
Dean groans before he can stop himself. He’s actually too hungover to be horny. He knows he’s in Castiel’s bed, and a glance over his shoulder tells him that he’s alone. A stab of panic makes Dean sit up. His stomach turns and lurches, and he has to fight the wave of nausea.
That’s when Dean realizes Castiel is a little drunk. And lonely as hell. His heart pangs. He knows the feeling all too well. And if he stops to think about it, he’s sure Castiel is feeling wretched and pathetic on top of it, considering Castiel’s got no one better to invite than the store clerk at a CVS. He remembers that forlorn, mournful look on Castiel’s face the very first time they’d met. Dean had wanted to reach out, but he hadn’t. He wasn’t gonna make the same mistake again.
Castiel feels worse. It hits him one day, that he’s been in pain. Since he poured the last reserves of his energy into fleeing. Pain under the scabbing wounds. Pain in his head, between his eyes and at the base of his skull. When he takes the stairs down to the panic room, he realizes he has bad knees.
“You were the first person to encourage me after I left. Everyone else was determined to let me know that I would fail,” Castiel continues. “It helped. When you said I would be alright, I really believed you, Dean.”
Dean walks to his cabin the second Castiel shuts the jeep off. Castiel wakes Chuck, who in turn wakes the lady who’d been a doctor before the world went to hell, and together they carry Risa’s unconscious form to the doctor's cabin. Once satisfied that Risa will eventually regain consciousness, Castiel leaves. He stops outside Dean’s cabin, hand poised to knock, but he still doesn’t know what to say.
It’s about the last thing Dean wants to hear so he doesn’t even bother dignifying that with a response. He gets in the car and drives. It’s a cold, crisp day, and between the rumble of the engine, and the way the ice crunches under the tires, Dean relaxes. But after about ten minutes Dean can’t even enjoy the call of the open road. He can’t afford the gas.
Okay, so maybe he should get over his crush. He’s pretty sure he blew it a couple weeks ago, so it’s pointless.
Castiel spares the body a glance before he scours the horizon again. The smell of blood is in the air. Dean called the police, but no one’s here. It’s been five minutes. No sirens, no flashing lights. “Dean, something’s–”
“I should brush my teeth before I try to kiss you.” Castiel wraps an arm around Dean’s hips and tugs him closer. “I’ve got a spare toothbrush for you, if you want. Can you stay for breakfast?”
The husk-gold fields strip away under the wheels of Castiel’s car and he leaves them behind. He drives away from God’s green earth for one last sight of green eyes. Sightless, dead green eyes. Eyes Castiel first set sight on in hell. Eyes that bled and wept, that implored and rebuked, that said a million things and nothing at all.
“Dean. Where are you going?” Castiel steps up so he’s leaning against the open door and Dean can’t shut it on him. The wild, desperate look in Dean’s eyes frightens him. This close, Dean’s discomfort is obvious. His skin is flushed at the cheeks and along his throat. His temperature is elevated enough that Castiel can feel it emanating off him. And the scent. So strong. Amplified even more so than usual. He smells. Wonderful. Like swelter and musk and something else. Something inalienably identifiable as Dean. Castiel pauses, mouth suddenly watering. His hold on the door slips clumsily as he shifts his feet, trying to decide if he wants to step closer into the magnetic draw of Dean’s heat, or step away to clear his head.
Castiel had never spoken to God. He had never seen Him. Now that Castiel tries to think of it – why did he believe? Was it because, even as an angel who couldn’t feel, Castiel could imagine a creature so great as God? He remembers begging for a sign into the silent ether. As Dean had with his father, Castiel calls, and the phone rings, but no one answers. Castiel leaves voicemails with no idea if anyone is ever going to hear them. So he sits here at the wheel, listening to the dial tone. If God would answer the phone this one time, Castiel would ask Him to spare one man. Only once. One more time. Call off the dogs. One last time.
“No, I just needed to drive,” Dean admits. He glances at Castiel and then looks back at the open, empty road. “You hungry? Tired? Wanna head back?”
Dean sighs, forcing himself to focus on Charlie’s bright, cheery rambling. He rubs his palm on his thigh, then pinches the front of his shirt to fan himself. A bead of sweat trickles down his back. Why did he agree to this, again?
Dean can’t help but smile again. “C’mon, you dork,” he murmurs, pressing a hand to the small of Castiel’s back and stepping through the door with him. Castiel rewards him with a grin.
Cas doesn’t answer right away. He gets this squinty, faraway look in his eyes that usually means he's puzzling out a complicated equation for an assignment.
“I had to double-check! My gaydar is never wrong but there’s a first time for everything.” She goes from defensive to curious in a heartbeat after that. “Tell me everything. Now.”
Because he keeps thinking back to the way Dean had relaxed once everything was out in the open. It was like nothing had changed, and at the same time, everything was completely different.
“You wanna leave?” Dean doesn’t mean for it to come out like that, all wounded and uncertain. It’s just– he thought they were having a good time.
Castiel Novak. The address he’s filled in puts him in an apartment literally across the street from the store.
“You might be hot but I don’t have to want to fuck you, you know?” Dean snaps. “You ever think of that?”
It’s been a few weeks since they spoke, and Castiel can’t stop feeling badly about the whole thing. At first, Castiel had been tentative–
Look at him, they would say about Castiel. Maybe that’s how the story would be told. God, the angels knew, struck Lucifer down for loathing humanity. And Castiel, too, was one of God’s sons. A brother to the angels. The rebel. The leader. The lover of things.
Dean allows himself a fond smile at Cas’ back and settles down against the headboard to watch. Who would’ve thought, angels obsessed with freaking garden hose for crying out loud. On screen, a forgettable, pretty woman announces an irresistible offer and god, why are they watching this? As though he’d read Dean’s mind, Cas switches to something about home makeovers.
Castiel looks up sharply and sees the fatigue written on Dean's face. He looks, Castiel thinks, feeling overcome with a restless helplessness, he looks like hell. Dean scrubs a hand across his face, digging the heels of his palms into his eyes.
There’s a few quiet moments where Dean just watches him, and Castiel takes his silence for agreement.
“We know he took the bigger cities almost simultaneously but now it makes no sense. If there’s a pattern, it's too erratic to make out. I thought he was moving northeast from the midwest, but now the Croats have hit Nebraska and Florida, going by the news. I can’t tell if it’s on direct orders from him or if it’s just spreading like a disease.”
“We’ll know soon enough,” Castiel says, for lack of anything better to say. It’s not a reassurance. He simply knows everything will come to a head eventually. There’s no other way for it to go. One way or another, everything will end. It’s the middle of the end. They just have to get there. Right now it’s hard to focus. By some merciful stroke of luck, Dean changes the subject. “
Castiel expects to hear the sharp exhales, the aborted whimper he’s grown so used to hearing, but instead, he hears footsteps. In the next instant, Dean’s pushing the bedroom door open. He’s pulled his shirt off, but his sweatpants are slung low on his hips, cock jutting obscenely above the waistband.
“Wait, what?” Dean’s face heats up. His heart hammers, and he panics. He can’t kiss Cas. “There’s gonna be kissing? I didn’t sign up for that. We’re roommates, it’s gonna be weird–”
Maybe the humans will tell it better. Angels are mere agents of fate. They are pure creation themselves, but they can’t create of their own volition. It is the humans that God blessed with the true miracles – the ability to create life anew. It is the humans that have the talent for storytelling.
Then he remembers that working three jobs (more or less) doesn’t really leave him with any time to have a personal life.
Maybe this date, even if it is unpleasant, will put the impossible out of his mind. Charlie is more well-versed in moving on than him.
He doesn’t remember meeting her. She says she found him on the banks of the university lagoon one hot June afternoon. He remembers going out for a run that day, but he doesn’t remember slipping and cracking his head against the paved pathway that wound around the water.
"I mean, here, with us." Chuck smiles around a reedy, thin laugh. "Reading passages from the Bible at wakes. You were an angel."
Castiel sighs, feeling a headache come on. Daphne’s left him a voicemail, asking if he can pick up some groceries on the way home. Castiel absently texts her in the affirmative and then stares at the other texts. Whoever this is, clearly never intended to send that picture. And they’re quite upset about it. Castiel decides it’s common courtesy to clear up the misunderstanding and put their fears to rest. That’s it. And then he’s done.
“Not a debate, Cas,” he says without looking back. He manages to sound simultaneously cold and placating. Dean Winchester, a mysterious paradox of emotion. Paralyzed by the loss of his brother, yet galvanized into ruthless action by vengeance.
, and drives him. It barely adds five minutes to the drive back to the CVS, and as Dean hurries in, the clock ticks over to show he’s exactly two minutes late.
The walk from Fatty’s to Castiel’s apartment is short. Leaving Sam, Charlie and Gabriel behind had been easy. Mostly because Sam and Gabriel were still arguing and Charlie was busy hitting on a cute bartender.
“Your turn,” Dean says, a touch bitterly. He hates this game already. Cas chews his lip as he picks up the next card.
“Not your fault,” Dean mutters. The tension eases from his voice, but his brows remain furrowed. He soaks the wound in whiskey and Castiel bites the insides of his cheeks to keep from making a sound. He’s worse than useless. He’s a liability. How far he has fallen.
“No, shut up and listen to me. You’re going on this date. I’m not taking no for an answer. It’ll be a distraction from all this moping. Trust me when I say you need this.”
Castiel fights him for the check and wins because he surprises Dean by hooking his foot around the back of Dean’s calf.
At one point, Jess falls asleep with her head on Sam’s shoulder and her feet in Dean’s lap. Charlie is out cold on the floor leaning against Castiel’s legs, and Kevin already went up to his room, and presumably to bed. Castiel is still up, but his eyes are glazed and he’s not really paying attention to
He catches himself mid-daydream and stops. For the hundredth time he tells himself - he doesn’t really know Dean, and Dean doesn’t really know him. What if it really is just complacency and boredom? Maybe he’s just so set in his ways so he doesn’t know just how much he cares for Daphne. Maybe he’s confusing boredom for unhappiness.
Jody opens her mouth, looking poised to tell him off sternly, but she changes her mind and sighs. “Take care of yourself, you hear me? Spoil yourself a little. You deserve it,” she says instead. When he nods, she reaches over the counter, she pulls him into a one-armed hug. “And I’m serious. Come talk to me about that job, okay?”
“Dean.” Castiel pauses until Dean looks at him. He, however, can’t resist kissing Dean again, whose eyes are glazed, and cheeks are flushed, lips slick and swollen from attention.
“Lost contact with a town an hour north from here. Radio’s dead. Hit by Croats probably, so we’ll ride out, see if there’s any survivors and anything that can be salvaged.” Dean says all this with no preamble and he’s about halfway through before Castiel focuses on it properly.
They all end up sprawled on the couch, and Dean packs away five very large slices of pie. He feels a small, jealous prick of longing, because he wants what Sam and Jess have, but it’s quickly overshadowed by the joy he feels for them.
They find a motel. In the lobby, with their hands raised in surrender they walk right into a devil’s trap and then out of it. They weather the unceremonious sprays of holy water to the face. The guy behind the counter even insists on nicking them with a silver knife.
“What, like someone I’m related to? Dad had this other kid we never knew about, but he’s dead.” Dean lets out a short laugh that sounds wounded and flat. “Like everyone else in this godforsaken family.”
The expression that colors Cas’ face is probably a smile, because it sharpens the crow’s feet at the corners of his eyes, but the muted glow of the bedside lamp kissing the geometry of his profile into an exquisite silhouette distracts Dean. Cas might be human now, but he still feels like an angel and he sighs like a man, but he still sounds like a seraph. “I know.”
“This one is on me,” Sam says, as they sit at the table that witnessed many a frenzied shred of research, every other altercation, every rare moment of solidarity, every wondrous instance of– love. It was love. Quiet and unassuming and real.
There is nothing but this. Even if Cas forgives him, forgiveness isn't love. Love is love. Dean thinks of Cain, and now he knows what he has to do.
Four days later, Castiel is finishing breakfast in front of the TV when his phone goes off. The texts come in rapid fire, and Castiel doesn’t have to look to know exactly who’s texting him. No one else texts him like that.
Castiel stares at her in wordless exasperation as she starts to squint at him thoughtfully. “Charlie, I have a lot of work to get to–”
“Agent Costello.” The beta officer meets them outside, looking frazzled. “I’m glad you could make it. Is this your partner?”
“Fine, alright, it’s stupid,” Dean babbles, stumbling out of his pants and crawling up the bed. “You were right. You happy now?”
In the morning, Dean wakes up in his own bed and... kind of forgets. He wanders downstairs in his underwear and a sleep t-shirt, and stops short at the foot of the stairs when he sees Castiel still asleep on the couch. He’s folded his jeans carefully and left it on top of his shoes by his feet. Dean spends a few moments staring at the messy scribble of dark hair, the sleep lines marring Castiel’s cheek. The way his soft mouth is askew, blanket tucked just under his chin.
“‘Complicated?’ My ass. This is the Winchester kid Ellen’s always talking about,” Sheriff Mills says pointedly.
“I’ve wanted to do that for a long time.” His eyes are dark, focused on Dean’s lips. He sways closer and Dean’s ready for it. He winds an arm around Castiel’s waist and crushes him closer, breathing in sharply before he pushes for more, lips parting to tease against the seam of Castiel’s mouth.
“Far as we know, yeah,” Dean shrugs, hands in his pockets. “Alright, listen up. I was gonna enforce a curfew anyway. No one out of their cabins after sun down. We want to lay low. Lights and noises in the nighttime are only gonna attract attention.”
“Enough?” Dean asks lightly. The spoon goes back to the bowl and without a protest, the bowl back to the nightstand. “Okay, that’s good,” Dean says, pulling one knee up at a time to take his shoes off. “You got through half of it, champ. Time to get some shut eye so your body can heal up.”
When he looks up, Cas is smiling. It’s fond and nostalgic, and it makes Dean’s heart ache. “I remember that night.”
“What is this?” Castiel asks, even as he swallows an uncertain number of whatever falls onto his palm before Dean can reply.
The humans, they are lesser. Imperfect. They feel so much. They live in pain. They beg and they die. They crawl on their bellies. They are mere curs, going through life, rabid and senseless. They burn God’s gift to them and in its place raise weeds.
A knock on the bathroom door shuts him up, and Castiel loses the resolve to change anything for another day.
The apocalypse. It was a fitting, humiliating end for Castiel’s existence. He’d chosen Dean. Even when it seemed hopeless, it had seemed pure. If they lost, Castiel had always imagined the death blow to be dealt swiftly. Snuffed out by Michael’s righteous wrath. Alive one second. Not the next. Over. Instead they now suffered a slow strangulation. They lost Sam, and were forced to continue without him. They lost in the worst possible way.
Sometimes, Castiel has to get away from it. The restlessness in the house reeks. It makes his skin crawl. He takes Bobby’s books down to the panic room and reads by the lamplight.
God. If there was a way to come off more impotent and clumsy… Dean wishes the ground would open up and swallow him to spare everyone.
“Woah, wait,” Dean interrupts, alarmed. “You think that’s a good idea? You got enough juice to get by?”
“Listen, Cas, you can still take my help with you know, money. And things. You keep a couple credit cards on you. For emergencies and whatnot. Charlie set us up, so it’s gotten a lot easier. So just - get a room here or something. Sleep on a goddamn bed. I don’t get
, the Indian restaurant near Daphne’s work. Castiel slips his phone out and glances at it under the table. No new texts.
"... I don't think it's -- Dean. Hello," Cas inclines his head in a greeting and turns away from Sam. He's nursing a cup of coffee. His shoulders relax, and he sort of smiles. It's awkward and sweet and Dean feels a stab of fear in his belly at the sight of blue eyes. Sam clears his throat loudly and moves to fuss with the toaster.
“There’s no kissing in this one,” Sam hisses, slapping a palm on the table. “Will you just calm down and stop making a big deal of it all?” He sighs and pushes a hand through his hair. “Dean, please. You know I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.”
There's nothing to say to that. Castiel understands the desire to shield children but at the same time, this world, Lucifer’s world, has no place to shelter the innocent. Chuck doesn’t appear to expect a response because he simply busies himself and Castiel finds he’s grateful for that. He’s found that now, when met with silence, most people simply accept it and move on. It’s easier than trying.
Castiel hums in agreement, sliding into the passenger seat. He looks around, but doesn’t touch the tape deck or anything else. The five mile drive goes by in a short blur of small talk. Dean learns that Castiel is graduating in a couple weeks, and his heart sinks, but it doesn’t surprise him. This a suitcase university, and Castiel is a grad student. There’s no reason he’d stay in this tiny, rural town.
“These are biased against me,” Dean protests, already reaching for the whiskey before remembering he could’ve just lied. He could’ve just said no. Fucking hell. And now it’s on camera. And who the fuck knows is gonna see it, and–
“No, it’s okay,” she interrupts, smiling. It looks a little forced. “I know what you’re going to say and it’s not like you to say that sort of thing. So don’t. I always liked that about you, you know? You’re a good man. Honest.”
“Oh yes, it’s very traditional. I’ve got my sushi, my Mike’s hard lemonades, and I hope the gummy bears are cranberry-flavored.” Castiel eyes the bag critically. “They’ll go very nicely with my binge-watch of The Great British Bake-off.”
Dean just shakes his head, still smiling. He didn’t bother arguing or insisting he was kidding. Castiel is sweet. That’s what makes things so much harder.
“Fuck. I - I mean, Cas, what’re we gonna do?” Sam scrubs a hand over his face and sighs. “This is my fault. If I hadn’t let Lucifer outta the cage, we wouldn’t be here. I need to fix this.”
“But, Cas. I was some stranger out there that you knew nothing about. It’s understandable you didn’t wanna spill the beans to me right off the bat. And anyway, I kinda knew something was up.”
“The Angels are gone,” Castiel says bluntly. He feels a little dizzy, so he sits on the edge of the bed. His feet feel like they’re made of lead.
Chuck turns to Castiel in relief. “Her son wants to join Risa’s gun training session and she doesn’t like it. She doesn’t think anyone should be learning about guns at all.”
Dean raises an eyebrow, but if he smells the bullshit, he doesn't call it. He just picks up the menu and peruses it with a frown. Castiel follows suit, trying not to surreptitiously spy on Dean from behind his menu. The silence stretches, then grows awkward.
Castiel thumbs open his email and stares at the invite. He can feel Dean’s lips against his hair, and he’s grateful for it. Though Dean likes to pretend he’s terrible at feelings and talking about them, his insight, when he deigns to offer it, is thoughtful and considerate. And even when he truly doesn’t feel like talking, he’s compassionate, and supportive.
“Nah,” Dean says, sounding light-hearted and playful, like he hasn't in a long time. It surprises Castiel into staring at him. There’s certainly something different about him. “I bet he’s a no-nonsense-Dunkin-Donuts-ditchwater-swilling kinda guy.”
Of course Castiel knew. He could see the destruction Dean had wreaked laid out all around them. The lashes still hung from Dean’s bloody hands. And Castiel had been foolish to believe that words that were a herald from heaven, bellowed with all the confidence of an angel of the Lord, would offer comfort:
Castiel looks away. “It’s not just because of him. I’ve been thinking about this for some time now, and I realize it was selfish and cowardly of me to have waited.”
Dean exhales sharply and wipes his mouth. “Okay. Working theory. It’s one demon hopping bodies– but why? It makes no sense. Unless it’s a swarm of demons. And someone’s walking around with the Colt icing them? It seems unlikely, but– hey. Can you get the bullet out of his head?”
Castiel ventures close once to check if Dean was okay, and to ask if he’d eaten. He stops short in the hallway. A cloying, sweet scent filters through the cracks between the hinges, and under the door. It arrests Castiel in his steps. He spends a few minutes trying to draw that essence into himself before he catches himself. It takes him a long time to walk away.
Daphne nods, and she looks a little sad. “We had a good run,” she says quietly. When Castiel doesn’t reply immediately she asks, “Didn’t we?”
“Why didn't you just come to me?” she asks, brows pinched in concern. “I told you I had a job for you.”
“I’ll talk to Chuck,” Castiel agrees. Something about Dean’s posture clues him in, so Castiel hesitates and then asks, “Are you alright?”
"It's where people share short video stories with each other," Cas explains with infinite patience, and Dean pulls a face, but nods to show he's listening. "I think Claire will like this..." he pauses to read the label. "Grumpy cat. Based on what I have gathered from the vines."
Castiel waits outside. Dean returns in a few minutes, looking harried and twirling the room key. He grabs the files from the backseat and pushes open the trunk to snag the duffel stuffed into a corner.
Dean shakes his head, sitting down heavily. “He’s getting stronger, Cas. Pretty sure the power’s not coming back on and once the water’s gone… I don’t know. I can’t help these people. They need to know that.”
“This is the best idea you could come up with?” Dean asks, watching as Sam arranges the drinks, shot glasses, and question cards in front of him. “Why does it have to be roommates? Why not friends? Siblings?”
When he enters the kitchen Bobby wordlessly hands him a mug. Castiel doesn’t bother protesting. He takes a sip and realizes that it’s coffee doctored with whiskey. Strangely, he finds it… fortifying.
Dean savors the moment. He memorized the dark shadows of Castiel’s eyelashes, the glisten of his lips still wet from a sip of beer, the color in his cheeks, the nervous bob of his adam’s apple… the way he breathes in when Dean leans closer and kisses him.
Castiel chews his lip. The seconds tick by. Sweat drops down his back. The hair at the back of his neck rises. It’s taking too long. Something is wrong.
Castiel blushes, self-conscious. He doesn’t know if he’s ready to be trading pictures with Dean. He thinks that he’d be okay with it under different circumstances, but now, even if he ignores his relationship with Daphne, he can’t do it. Besides, he knows he’s atrocious with a camera, so he clings to that excuse for now.
“Or at least– just do this as a favor. For me, please,” Charlie pleads, looking so desperate that Castiel wavers. “If it sucks, I promise you can leave. I’ll send you a safety text and call with an excuse to give you an out and everything. Please, please, please–”
Dean throws the covers back, and is surprised to find he’s not naked. He’s wearing the plain dark t-shirt and the boxers he’d worn last night. The bed creaks loudly as he sits up. He gets to his feet and finds his jeans neatly folded and placed on a chair. His jacket is draped over the back. His shoes are placed neatly in front  of the chair on the floor with the socks folded on top.
Dean shrugs. Cas breathes out slowly and picks up the first card. He frowns as he reads it, and his shoulders slump.
He needs to accept it. He needs to move on. Castiel forces himself to get dressed and focus on this evening. If nothing else, it’s an opportunity, and he should treat it as such. In true fashion, Castiel is nervous and early for his date, and considers calling Charlie to cancel. He really doesn’t want to do this.
The whole town is on lockdown. Every road leading in and out of it is blocked. Police cars dot every intersection, flashing red and blue staccato against the black sky.
“It makes so much sense, now.” Dean covers his face with his hands. He’s not eating either, and his mood is so hard to read.
“Stop overthinking it, Cas,” Dean says gently. “No harm, no foul. You came clean. Daphne and I both know the whole story. She’s forgiven you, and even though there’s nothing to forgive, if you need it from me, you have it.”
He relishes waking up with Cas, whether it’s to a shock of bedhead under his chin or an erection nestled between his thighs, or a stubborn arm or leg wound around his person. He loves coming home to find Castiel’s innocent attempts at domesticity– slightly burnt lasagna on the table, the laundry Dean had done and dumped on the bed in a hurry carefully folded and put away, and on one memorable occasion, a disaster in the kitchen, and pie on the coffee table.
Chuckling, Dean scans the stapler quickly, and bites the inside of his cheek so he won’t offer to fix it for Castiel. “Good luck,” he wishes sincerely.)
“I’m in love with you, Dean Winchester,” Castiel whispers, pressed against Dean’s lips between kisses, so Dean has no choice but to accept them.
“And I wanna help,” Dean agrees. “I need everything you got on all these kids. The girl, the boy, these copycats.”
Dean looks around for an escape. This whole conversation exposes him. Makes him sound like the jealous friend who’s hiding a crush poorly. And while that is true, he doesn't want it to come out like this. Not here. Not now. Maybe not ever.
“This stupid religious literature club, or something. They took him to a strip club,” Dean grins. “He hated it. Poor guy looked like he’d shit his pants.”
“She put your number in my phone,” Dean says, with a groan. He sounds annoyed, but he looks impressed. “She switched out Crowley’s number for yours so when I sent the text–”
Castiel nods. “We took the same class last year as well, and partnered on a project. I knew Sam had an older brother named Dean. I didn’t know you were the same Dean. It makes sense, though. If I could afford the Coffee Grind, we probably would have met.”
Castiel studies the body. She’s young. Spots of sulfur dust the omega’s fingertips. The demon possessing her is long gone. Demons can ride a deceased body, keeping it functioning for their purposes, well past the original soul’s departure. Normal bullets don’t even slow demons down, so why did it leave now? Was it summoned away? Did it get bored? Other than the fact that the girl had been possessed, Castiel can’t say anything else for sure.
The first thing he does is lock eyes with Dean, but instead of lingering as he usually does, he flits to Sam. It… stings.
Castiel knows the answer to those questions but he carefully avoids it for weighing another thought. If he can feel so much for a stranger he’s traded texts with for a few hours, then he never really had much of a romantic relationship with Daphne. She’s a wonderful human being, and he likes her very much, but he’s never loved her.
Dean looks confused, and it’s enough to make Castiel falter. What if he’s wrong? The evidence is overwhelming, but it could be that his perspective is flawed.
“Pick up a card,” Dean says, beating Sam to the punch, and surprising himself. Cas moves his body to face Dean completely. Their knees brush under the table, and Cas scoots back on his stool so they’re not touching anymore. Dean sits still and ignores his bruised heart.
“Uh, all. Can I say all? It’s a little warm in here,” he says, pointedly ignoring the cameras facing him.
Rich-or-Mark laughs shortly. “It helps with the heat. Mellows it out. Distracting too, because you get hungry instead.”
He gets to make small talk with Castiel, which is nice. It helps him glean little things about Castiel, like the fact that Castiel is a student at the university. And like every other student on the planet, Castiel is pretty lazy about grocery shopping, so he ends up in CVS when he runs out of things like cereal and milk and condiments. Dean has to resist the urge to offer to cook Castiel a home-cooked meal when he hears the idiot has been surviving on Taco Bell and vending machine coffee.
There was also the fact that Castiel had never done this before. He knew he was going to be terrible about it. Dean had explained it to him, but it hadn’t been very helpful.
Castiel sighs. He’s not really interested in going on a date with a stranger. He wants to meet Dean, but he can't do anything about that.
“Listen, sweetheart,” Dean starts with a tired grimace of a smile. It doesn’t look pleasant. He’s caked in dirt and blood. One of the men cracks open a beer and offers it to Dean.
But yeah, Dean doesn’t hate his jobs. For one, he doesn’t mind being on his feet most of the time. Barring the occasional off day, and the occasional asshole, he’s good with people. He knows how to turn up the charm, make small talk, flirt a little now and then. He remembers their names, how they like their coffee, or that it’s even the time of the month (in more ways than one) for certain people. It’s very good for raking in tips at both the Roadhouse and the coffee shop. The CVS… not so much.
Castiel doesn’t bother responding to that. It’s clear Dean feels guilty and he retaliates by lashing out to what he perceives is an attack. The conversation ends. They have slightly soggy chicken salad sandwiches and split a bag of chips for dinner.
Ugh. Lesson learned. Never try to post a new chapter for a fic with this much formatting from your phone. No matter how much of a hurry you're in to post. Thanks, you guys, for muscling through despite the crap formatting. I thought I could handle posting this after a flight + batch cooking for the week. *shakes fist @ AO3* I realized the accidental post last night, but I thought I deleted it before the damage could be done. I didn't want to lose all your lovely comments, though so... ahh. Anyway. It's fixed. Pictures coming soon. Thanks again. So much ❤️
“What do we– ugh I already know the answer.” Dean scrubs his face with both hands. “What do we always fight about?”
“It used to baffle me. The way humans would just choose to fall away from the world for a few hours. But now I know. The body tires and so the mind tires. Living is a process that must be renewed, and for it to begin anew, it must end. It’s like. It’s a little death.”
He hates Dean, Castiel realizes with a roiling, sickening anger. It has to be hate because the alternative is unthinkable. Unfathomable.
“What’s my greatest asset, physically?” he asks, but he’s already beginning to fill Dean’s shot glass.
“Can we– I think we should skip this one,” he says, mostly to Sam. “I feel it’s not fair. It’s too private.”
But with each inquiring text that went unanswered, he grew more anxious. He’d confessed everything to Dean, in increasingly long texts, until the frustration of the silence pushed him to make a call. And that’s when he realized the delicate boundaries in place, though they may have been unintentional. Through some unspoken mutual agreement they’d never called each other.
Maybe Castiel pulls over in the service lane at the border of Kansas and cries. He can’t remember if he sobbed or simply held himself because it was late afternoon and all around the fields shimmered green. How was the world still so beautiful? How did it still turn? What does it matter? Why is Castiel here? Dean isn’t in Kansas anymore.
“What if we chose, for ourselves,” he starts, then clucks his tongue impatiently. “No, that’s stupid.”
What passes for strategic planning involves gathering a few other hunters, Chuck, and Castiel in Dean’s room. Chuck is grilled on his meagre visions. Castiel offers his knowledge on Lucifer and the angels. He may not hear the chatter, but he applies previous knowledge to the current situation and makes educated guesses. He listens to Dean’s plan of action and offers insight if there is scope for improvement.
“Well, it's not like I walked in on you. So I didn’t see anything. I just knew it was happening. And I left the apartment.” Dean runs a hand through his hair, trying to calm himself. Things feel awkward, and so Dean lashes out.
“The potato salad here is very good,” he says as he flags the waitress down for another round. “Although, it’s only a salad by the very loosest definition of the word. It’s deep fried potatoes suffocated and drowned in chipotle mayonnaise. Would you like to split a side of it with me? It’s a very big serving.”
“I was just telling Dean how much I miss Starbucks,” Risa says with a wistful smile. “You ever have anything hazelnut flavored, Castiel? I bet you would’ve loved a hazelnut frappucino. Heaven on earth, I tell ya.” Her smile turns wistful and she amends, “As close to it as we could get.”
Dean runs his fingers over the print. “Cas, tell me the truth. Is the answer in here? Is this– Is there a point to this? I mean, I don’t have a fucking clue. Do we have a chance or are we just sitting her twiddling our thumbs while out there-“ His voice shakes. He’s angry. Scared.
Castiel studiously doesn’t comment on the fact. Already, he's thinking about serendipitous meetings in grocery stores and coffee shops. He starts being more aware of his surroundings, just in case he runs into someone he might recognize.
And if Dean and Charlie could figure him out so fast, that meant other people could as well. Castiel was obviously not as good at hiding as he thought he was.
The man looked to be sleeping, still form unmoving under a white hospital blanket and hooked up to a monitor and an IV.
“What?!? What is so damn important-“ Dean started, but Jo and Ellen were both pointing out the window. He trailed off when he followed their gazes out.
He was alone. Shawn now slept in Krissy’s bed now that her heat was over. He was safe here. No doubt the encounter with the professor had stirred up bad memories, but nothing else had come of it. Not yet, anyways.
After he grabbed his keys, Dean exited his apartment and descended down one flight of stairs, making his way to the very end of the hallway to knock on Charlie’s door. He could hear the muffled sound of the television and Charlie’s startled laugh, and he shifted on his feet. Was there someone else in the apartment?
Just as Dean turned back to the task of rescuing the rest of his stuff, black shoes walked into view, right in front of him.
Now that he had brought it up, Dean’s brain reminded him of the news report they had seen this morning. “Ah, shit,” Dean said, and bee-lined it to Bobby’s old desktop computer.
“Man, I was really drunk last time if I couldn’t tell how much of a newbie you are at this,” Dean chuckled. Before Castiel could get offended, he continued, “It’s kinda doing something for me. Never spent a heat with anyone, have you?”
“Cas, look at me for a second.” Castiel couldn’t help but do as Dean asked. It didn’t escape him that Dean was using his nickname again. “Seriously, don’t apologize. It’s not your fault. I was the one who started this mess, and I’m pretty sure Henrickson was the one who forced us into this whole Siamese twin thing. And, y’know, waiting in the library
Bobby was silent for a beat. “Ah, shit,” he said, exhaling sharply. “Got you on a short leash, then.”
“I pride myself on being able to sniff out any gays, I mean – it takes one to know one and all that jazz, but this whole time you guys have been here, it’s been like a Bermuda triangle for my gaydar. Just, - spinning-“ she turned to Castiel. “He’s not listening to a single thing I’m saying.”
This order had needed a special blood collection tube, to test for silver. Castiel can’t see where the bandages are, but the sallowness of Dean’s skin, and the faintest hint of still healing bruises on a creature like Dean is a telling sign. He also notices Dean’s hands, and Dean notices them too.
Daphne put a hand on his arm, and he glanced over at her, distracted. “Dean, what was he drugged with?”
At that, Dean looked down at the clothing Castiel currently wore. His traitorous mind flashed back to the sight of Castiel re-buttoning his shirt in the hallway.
When he’d recovered enough to pull himself back together, Sam turned his head, surveying his surroundings. He was clinging to the side of a shuttle, and -
The whole bottle had been dosed with Red. And meant for Sammy. It was a good thing he’d only had a small glass of the stuff. Any more and he would’ve overdosed. Anyone who wasn’t an alpha could freaking die if they had too much of-
Dean almost missed a step, eyes coming up to meet Gordon’s, knuckles going white around the keys in his pocket. They couldn’t say that shit around Bobby unless they wanted to get their asses handed to them, and the rest of the group saw Dean and shuffled guiltily, caught. Gordon just kept looking straight at Dean, even smiling a little. An alpha like him wasn’t intimidated by a mere beta, not unless he was outranked. “Hear something you like, Dean?”
“Alistair,” Sam greeted, taken aback when the man sidled up to him to shake his hand in both of his. Alistair smelled like a beta, all clean and acidic, and Sam withheld a grimace.
“Is there a point to all this?” Dean asked, and Castiel raised his arm slightly to indicate silence. Feeling a small tug, Castiel glanced down. Dean hadn’t let go of his sleeve. Dean realized a beat after Castiel did, and snatched his hand back, looking away.
Castiel looked amused at the latter question. “My clothes? They stay where they are. It’s why we have the one, loose circular fabric in the Forests, to accommodate our bigger wolf. Confining clothing will split or hurt us if we try to shift while wearing it.”
Curious, Dean made his way over to Castiel. When Castiel reflexively glanced over at the approaching movement to see Dean, he seemed to consciously un-tense.
After a long moment, Dean laughed. It was a sharp, disbelieving sound. “That’s rich, coming from you.”
. The one that happened when people found out he was an omega. When they started treating him different. John himself had been the first one when he'd walked in on Dean experiencing his first heat in the middle of the night. They had both thought Dean would grow to be an alpha like his father, but that horrible night had shot
Ash laid down, back against the motel door, and John made his way to the bathroom. Once he shut the bathroom door, Dean turned around and gathered Raz close to his chest.
Bobby met them at the doors of the hangar and led them all outside, into the sunlight, away from the noise. Other sirens wailed in the distance. Bobby looked stonier than usual, but Dean knew that meant he was worried and trying not to show it.
The next time Dean saw Cas, he showed up on the Impala, naked and covered in bees, and tried to convince Dean that one was his daemon.
Charlie blinked in surprise before guilt crossed her features. Stepping almost into the hallway, she half-way closed the door behind her. “Uh, don’t get mad.”
“We’re back-“ Dean started, brought up short by the sight of several people he didn’t know talking to Ellen and Jo. They’d all stopped when Dean had rushed in, Sam almost barreling into his back. “Um.”
. Dean wondered if Sam knew, then decided he didn’t. No way Sammy could contain his geek if he ever found out he could talk to a real Preserver.
But they didn’t usually interact with the rest of the world, let alone live in it. They had retreated to the Forest Preserves, completely unconcerned with everything outside their borders, and away from most modern technology and customs. Some people still thought that the Old Hierarchy was still the best system, and their simple way of life of living in the woods had taken on an almost romantic quality. It made for great stories; whole packs running through the woods in wolf form, transforming back only in their villages and towns. They still had a lot of lingering power in the new government, a couple of alpha representatives were given permission by the Old Hierarchy to leave their territory and ‘advise’ this society. Dean thought they were classist assholes – only Tier 1 outsiders were ever allowed in, and they had to totally conform to the social norms, which was why no Tier 1 omega would ever join and give up the freedoms and status they had outside the Preserves.
Dean turned away from Sam, putting a trembling hand over his face. Sam could only watch as Dean tried to keep it together, breath shuddering.
“About being part of the Underground. Working for your government, and not for-“ he waved a hand, before settling on, “my side.”
Daphne stood up, “Okay, Shawn. Time for school.” Castiel rose from his chair as well and collected the dirty dishes.
Something unfurled, energy gathering. It concentrated in his head, behind his eyes, until the pressure was too much to bear, and then-
The reminder made his eyes burn red again. Enraged, Sam had both hands around Alistair’s neck before he realized it, uncaring as Alistair clawed bloody furrows into his arms, trying to dislodge him.
They were given guest access and she waved them through the first door. Like all medical centers, this one was a maze of confusing and long hallways, so packed full of people that they’d started putting hospital cots out in the hallways when they’d run out of rooms.
Any other news Dean got was not shared with him, but it made Dean get up several times and pace the living room. Their subsequent encounters were always a bit more heated after such an email.
The last page contained the photocopy of another photo, a real one this time – an aerial view of what Dean placed as a lone house, trees visible on all sides of the clearing at the edges of the photo. Well, what remained of a house. It had been burned down to rubble at this point, a dark trail of smoke smearing diagonally across the page, hinting at its recent destruction. Four dark shapes lay haphazardly around the clearing – four bodies prone on the ground, Dean realized, one in wolf form. Of the three still human, one had fallen facedown, and another on a side, faces not visible from the sky, but the third was stretched out, facing upward towards whatever had taken the picture. The figures were small and relatively hard to make out, but Dean could clearly identify Castiel – or Jimmy – with a dark slash across the throat. A dark stain had pooled on the ground underneath him. Poor bastard had probably bled out fast.
They also dealt in absolutes and liked to be paid in blood, which had Castiel wondering what exactly was happening back in Lawrence. Would this new agent let Gordon out? Or side with Ruby, since she had the blood of the Family running through her veins? He wondered how much of Dean’s superior telling them to run was only for Castiel, and how much of it had been for his omega police officer. Maybe they had come to the same conclusion that Gordon had; that their best leverage to capture Castiel was through Dean. It would certainly ease his mind concerning Daphne.
A muffled noise stopped him before he could turn the corner. He paused, and there it was again- a human voice - it sounded like-
this wasn't gonna happen at first but God, Dean would so do that. Shit gets real in the next chapter!
Scowling, Castiel flexed the hand resting on his leg. “I had seen him at the diner before, many times, but I never got his name. He never did anything untoward before this, but he came to sit and watch Daphne quite often. He always left me uneasy.”
That was impossible. Henrickson knew that just as well as Dean did, but Henrickson held his tongue. He knew what battles he wanted to win, and this was not going to be one of them, apparently.
Castiel didn’t deign to respond. That is, until Dean’s shadow crossed over him and he took Castiel’s book away to set it on the end table. “Dean, what-“
Sam led Jess forward by their joined hands, first at a slow trot, then building up to running as fast as he could to get them across the barren courtyard.
Jesus, what was wrong with him? Ever since he got up, he hadn’t gotten anything done without thinking of Castiel. Preferably naked.
This was some first-class karma shit right here; leaning over the same sink that Cas had an hour before and puking his guts out. He’d appreciate the situational humor more if he didn’t currently feel like a cement truck was in the process of running him over. This wasn’t normal at all, what he was feeling right now. It was coming on too fast to be normal. His stomach cramped, sharp and painful, and he dry-heaved into the sink again, clutching the sink edges for support, shaking. His head throbbed from the force of it.
“Well, it might’ve been spiked with a shit-ton of Red and it also might’ve had a note on the underside of the bottle with her diamond on it, so yeah, pretty damned sure.”
“So what are we going to do about Ruby?” Dean asked, effectively changing the subject, and Sam glanced worriedly at Jess, and back to Dean.
“Was that supposed to make me feel better?” They both knew that even though that was the case, a bullet to the brain would kill anyone. If Castiel was still alive, Dean needed to find him, fast, before the sniper did.
“Surprise?” Jess replied, “Shit. We were going to ask you to do something at the house tonight and spring the news then. It’s really becoming noticeable now.” She turned to Sam, “Everybody’s going to know within a few hours, aren’t they?”
“Yes, of course, but-“ Dean was making his way down the hall before Castiel could finish. “Dean, wait-“
Benny clapped his shoulder, and Dean jumped a little at the suddenness, still twitchy. “You’re just gettin’ in the way, now. C’mon.” Benny had arrived just after the first responders - mostly for moral support. A partner in trouble never sat well, but with the immediate danger past, Benny was probably ready to go home after such a long day.
During a normal day at school, they’d ended up in the janitor’s closet again during their lunch period. He was a fan of janitor’s closets, especially if the lights were off with a warm body pressed right up against him in the tight space. She’d taken a shower this morning, so her hair smelled faintly of strawberries. It was awesome. Things were heating up, and he found himself getting a bit hot under the collar as he mouthed down her neck, so he was distracted when Amanda tilted her face just a little and dragged her lips across his jaw, then his neck.
“You see him?” Dean asked, and Castiel glanced back at the solitary man jogging on the sidewalk opposite, made indistinct by his raincoat.
Castiel writes on the paper and offers it to Dean in lieu of an answer. Dean doesn't take it until Castiel gestures for him to do so, and it only takes him a second to read the writing.
It’s a well-known secret that incubi and succubi have a preference for werewolf strength and stamina, but Castiel has almost never seen them being this bold with someone who is clearly not interested. When the two demons say something to Dean as he tries to sample the food, enough for him to choke and frantically scan the room for an escape, Castiel has to smother a laugh.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Dean interrupted, and turned over to face the wall, back to Castiel.
Jess cooked an omelet for each of them – and Dean just hung around and watched her do so. If he offered to do it for her, she’d slap him with a spatula. He could tell she wanted to bring up the conversation from last night, but she had so far managed to keep it to herself. That didn't last too much longer. She got half-way through eating before she stopped and just looked at him. Oh no. “Dean-“
“Making dinner. Charlie and Cas are coming over.” Dean could hear the silent judgment over the line. “Ugh, Benny, we’ve been over this.”
Dean sighed, and they fell into a silence. Now that shit had hit the fan, Castiel was downright talkative.
Years later, when Sam ran away at Flagstaff for two weeks, they found him with Millie at his side, a red-golden retriever almost as big as the german shepherd Ash was. After John had finished reprimanding both Sam and Millie, and he finally noticed she wasn’t changing, he took them all out for burgers to mark the occasion.
After a few more beats of silence, Dean glanced over again, uncomfortable. “Man, why are you staring? It’s freaking me out a little.”
The next morning, Krissy came down to eat breakfast with the rest of them. It was easy to ignore the still inviting scent of a heat; it would dissipate before too long, probably even before the beta officer Winchester would arrive to talk to Krissy later that day. At first, she didn’t talk, just watched as Daphne served her and Shawn a large breakfast. Shawn looked a lot happier and more at ease with Krissy by his side.
When she led them all over to the rest of the group, sure enough, Ash diverted both Krissy and Shawn when he turned around first. “Hey dudes and dudettes. How’s life?” He nodded at Castiel in a
Castiel can still smell the sharp tang of blood in the air, and this one has a different flavor than most. Turned werewolves always smell off and distorted, an aftereffect of being one thing before turning into something else, but Dean’s blood smells clear and true.
“Fair enough.” The professor sighed and pushed off the wall. “Guess that’s that then,” he said, with finality. “No more Underground. I don’t think any more People of the Forest are ever making it out after that clusterfuck.” Gabe turned to Castiel once more. “That’s all I needed to know, so I’m outta here. I really hope we never have to meet again, ‘cause I’d rather not lose the life I have out here. No offense.”
Dean let Sam take this one, and Jo opened the next door down the hall. “And here’s yours. The exact same.” And it was. There was a lumpy looking mattress with sheets held down with restraining straps on top of it for use in zero-G, and a built in desk with a touchscreen and wardrobe on the opposite side of the tiny room. Dean wandered in and put his things down on the bed.
“Bobby?” Dean yelled, but the siren drowned his voice out. Heart jumping in his throat, Dean left his tools and put his comm around his wrist, speed-walking to the exit. Other mechanics emerged from working on the other shuttles and hulking machinery to do the same. The siren echoed through the large hangar, red lights turning the shapes of the massive mining equipment into unrecognizable giants.
They hadn’t seriously talked about long term plans, what would happen if one of them met their scent-mate (though the odds of that were slim to none; Jess’s parents weren’t, and although Sam’s parents had been, he knew their marriage had been on shaky ground at the end). Sometimes he thought he worried too much about it, but now the worst was happening-
“Have a nice day,” he smiles, handing the bag over to Castiel. But Castiel looks miserable, still on the verge of tears and Dean can’t ignore it anymore. “Listen– I mean, are you okay?”
(“You just, you know, you go with the flow, babe,” he’d murmured into Castiel’s neck, while being very distracting with his hands. “Don’t worry so much about whether I find it sexy. Focus on what you want, what turns you on. It’s easy.”
Castiel doesn't want to let go but he forces himself to. He lowers himself into his seat as the realization sinks in slowly.
And then all too suddenly he's got two minutes to not show up late, and he has to rush across the street to make it in time. First, he has to explain things to his date, and hope the person will forgive him; they don’t deserve to be stood up. Then he’s going to go home and talk to Dean. One way or another, he’s finishing this. He needs the closure. The maitre'd guides him to the table and when Castiel sees the man already seated at the table, his heart skips a beat.
“You…” he hesitates, and lets out a sigh. “You leave. The whole silent treatment thing. No texts, no emails. You just drop off the face of the planet for a few days. Used to scare the crap out of me.”
“Dean,” Castiel says with a hard swallow that clicks in his throat. “I should give you some privacy.”
“Unintentionally,” Castiel defends, annoyed. “As an angel, I was never handicapped by such base instincts.”
In his fantasy, he was seductive and charming, and Dean responded effusively. In reality, Castiel had a tendency to wax purple instead of poetic, or at least Dean reacted as though he was constantly torn between embarrassed amusement and sometimes… affection.
His hands grasp Castiel’s hips and tug him back, so Castiel has to flatten himself over Dean. And then Dean’s pulling his underwear down, and Castiel almost chokes on the cock in his mouth. He presses his lips to Dean’s inner thigh and tries to breathe, trembling as he feels the hot, wet heat of Dean’s lips and tongue murmuring along the erection hanging heavy between his legs. He makes an embarrassing noise when Dean’s tongue swipes under his balls, and then flickers over them.
And damn if the words don’t go straight to Dean’s cock, as he pictures Castiel’s head bowed between his legs, taking his fill. Castiel’s palm flattens over Dean’s lower abdomen right where the arousal pools, and Dean has to grip Castiel’s wrist or risk succumbing to the obvious seduction.
Castiel presses his lips in a line, kneeling in the water to feel out the edge of the seam, and shoves both hands into it.
They’re closer, Castiel braced so near that he’s practically in the chair with him, the outside of his thighs bumping the inside of Dean’s and Dean has the delirious nonsensical memory of Lisa in much the same position, only there was a rumpled bed and way,
When he sits up, though, he notices the bowl and lighter at Sam’s other side. Dean groans and shoves the now-transparent peace offering onto his bedside table, fork clattering. “Sam, seriously, I am so goddamn tired of the future.”
Dean’s fingers twitch closed around the Impala’s keys, searching out the visceral sense-memory they always, always jolt; the warm highway rumble, that bone-deep road hum that lingers for hours after a long ride— but nothing. Hardly even an itch to let the outside air fill up his lungs, just as hot as in here as it was dry as chaff out there.
Dean's murmuring husky encouragements in his ear that all soak together, Castiel’s mind ablaze with nothing but a mantra he’s long buried, circling in his ears as he melts into him and finally tumbles headlong over the edge-
Before Dean can ask him what he means, Castiel finally turns to him, lips pressed into a scowl. He doesn’t sleep, sure, but right now? He looks like he could use a nap or twelve. His hair’s a tousled mess, eyes bloodshot.
Dean’s reading had confirmed that much. But manifestations of the mind hold their own dangers, and he’d already been thrown across the hall like so much scrap once - he doesn’t care to find out what it’s doing here and what its intentions are.
Dean’s grip goes loose on Castiel’s shoulder, fingers sliding off. He hits the ground. The splash snaps Castiel back; he twists to find Dean, leaving behind the yawing black hole of nothing he’d torn open behind them.
Castiel’s grip tightens on the angel blade as if he can threaten the blurry remnant back into a memory, but it’s as useful as the blade itself had been… he thinks. Had it not worked?
“Okay.” The thin lines around Dean’s eyes crinkle, just for a second, and Castiel is tugged forward until their noses smudge together, Dean’s breath hot on his lips. Castiel braces a hand on the bed to keep from falling into him, as if he hadn’t fallen so much further than this.
“ ...You, uh. You good there?" Dean's voice breaks into his daze, ragged around the edges like he’d been shouting. It made sense; Castiel hopes after a moment that the walls were as thick as they seem. Dean had filled the room with his voice.
Castiel doesn’t bother protesting. He knows Dean’s just teasing. He hesitates when he hears the scrape of a chair, but then takes the leap.
He doesn’t really think of it. Much. Sometimes he does. He doesn’t have the picture anymore, but he remembers the brief flash of arousal. The instantaneous attraction. He knows there’s not much point thinking about this stranger who provoked such a reaction. He doesn’t intend to pursue a relationship with anyone else while he’s with Daphne. They may be little better than roommates, but they have an established relationship. Commitments to each other. A joint account for god’s sake.
It’s been six months since he last spoke to her, or saw her. Of course, he considers that Daphne simply forgot to remove him from her contacts, and sent the invite out to everyone. If that’s the case, it’s best to ignore it, consider it a mistake, and move on. Castiel is partial to this theory because Daphne was the kind of person to make things clear. If she intended to invite him to the birthday, he would’ve gotten a call or a text to eliminate any ambiguity.
It’s totally worth drawing the attention of half the coffee shop to see the way Castiel gets all pink and smiley and just
That’s… a very attractive young man. About a decade too young for him. It must be an old picture, he thinks, because the haircut and the necklace date it. Very attractive, though. His gaze lingers at the nipple before being led down by the arm to the crotch. His face grows warm, and he realizes he’s actually licking his lips.
Dean chuckles again. “I would, but I don't understand the damn cloud or whatever. Apparently it's not automatic? Charlie tells me now, when it's useless, that I gotta set it up once. So when I lost the phone, I lost everything. Lost his number.”
Dean pulls his jeans on and stuffs the socks in his pockets as he steps unsteadily into his shoes. He snags the jacket and opens the door to Castiel’s room, and nearly walks into a sleepy Castiel. He’s wearing those damn bee pajamas and no shirt.
“You’re all they’ve got, Dean,” Castiel says. He feels the hopeless anger bubble inside him, threatening to pour out. It’s a horrible feeling. It makes him hot and cold all over and sets his heart racing. When everything failed, at least it still came down to this. To the value of human lives, however few. And now, Dean wanted to wash his hands of that too.
“I do,” Castiel says hastily. “I want to be here. I wanted to say yes. I wanted to meet you for a drink. I wanted to ask you out myself. Believe me, please.”
“Uh, yeah.” Dean looks down at himself, then at the wall behind Castiel. Anywhere but at Castiel. He doesn’t know how to ask the question. He didn’t know which question to ask.
“Say hi to Sheriff Hanscum for me,” Dean says, flashing a knowing smile as he bags the donuts and beer.
“You do. It bothers you a lot. I know you don’t like her, but she’s never done anything to deserve it.”
“Dean,” Cas starts, tone warring between wary and warning, and Dean can see the confidence from this morning is gone.
“Do you want one?” Dean smiles, trying to sell it. “It takes two minutes to sign up. You get a discount on the ice cream.”
But this time Cas looks over his shoulder at Dean, blue eyes filled with a painful earnestness. He says, “Dedication to any sort of occupation is the sincerest form of prayer, Dean.”
There’s a pause and Castiel tries to think of a way to respond. He’s debating between asking if this virtual stranger is back ‘on the res’, or asking for an elaboration when a few more texts chime in.
Mark appears unaware of what to say to that, so he just nods and continues to smoke. Eventually he says, “I had a boyfriend. He was a beta, so that made everything a lot simpler. Then he got infected and well, here I am.” He gives Castiel an appraising look and guesses, “You’re probably an alpha, like Dean. Not exactly like Dean. I mean, Dean’s an alpha if there ever was one. You know, he’s like, poster boy alpha.”
Was it too much to ask for that they make love in his bed and cuddle after? No, instead, Dean had to go and waltz into his home and heart in tattered jeans and sweatpants and hoodies and old band t-shirts, bringing his stupid, beautiful face and kind heart and gentle hands and delicious chicken soup.
It sets something fluttering in Castiel’s chest, and the warmth creeps up his neck. He firmly tells himself that he isn’t thrilled to find out he has something in common with Dean’s brother.
Castiel could only watch as the two were dragged off into the night, unable to go up against four members of his own pack to save them. He paused and counted again. Four? But hunting parties always had five-
“Oh, trust me, same goes here.” Jo said, smirking in response as she looked to the side. Castiel followed her gaze to where Dean and Benny sat, unexpectedly meeting Dean’s own eyes before the man turned away, rubbing the back of his neck. Castiel squinted in confusion, but looked back to Jo when she started speaking again. “I have that picture as my phone background, you know.”
Dean brushed past him to the closet, throwing it open and rummaging for clothes. There were healing welts on Dean’s back, and Sam’s eyes dropped to the dark bruises on his hips as he pulled on a pair of pants.
Being stuck out in the rain had dampened his smell, but he’d been wearing the same clothes for three days now. He definitely did not smell good.
That dimmed Castiel’s smile considerably. “I – uh, no, I don’t have any embarrassing fighting stories.”
“Don’t worry; I couldn’t care less. Especially considering your competence on the job. There was one curious incident, though.”
Henrickson opened the door immediately, preoccupied with reading a slim folder he still had in his hand. “Come on in.” Dean followed him as he turned and walked back into the room, and waited, stiff and uncomfortable, as Henrickson sat back into the chairs and finished reading, ignoring his presence completely for the moment. His laptop glowed in front of him; more official looking data covering the screen.
Castiel ran for the two going after Dean, shifting just enough for the claws on his hands to appear.
Finished with their search, they both got into the car, Dean taking the driver’s seat. He didn’t know if Cas even knew how to drive. He tossed the atlas into Cas’ lap.
“I’m sorry. Dean is not in a position to help, at the moment. There’s an FBI agent that he currently has to answer to.”
After a moment’s hesitation, he started walking down the left passageway. The floor was of the same smooth gray material as the curved walls, almost like stone or marble, but his feet did not make a sound.
“No!” Sam cut him off, face heating up, “God no, Dean, I would never- I was asleep – and, and Jessica was there – and I was trying to- to save her-“ he cut himself off, looking away. Sam hated the fact that his voice wouldn’t stop wavering.
Thank you all for your comments and support! It means a lot, and even if I don't respond to all of your comments, know that I appreciate all of them and read them more times than I would like to admit!
Unfortunately, the door to his room is now behind Dean, so when Castiel tries to brush past him, Dean follows the movement, walking backwards to keep in front of him. “Hey, I’m sorry I woke you up,” he says with a bashful grin. “Thanks for letting me in - d'you mind if I borrow some clothes or something? Pretty worried about losing some extrem- extremities here-“
The professor turned around and scanned the crowd. “You!” he pointed at a male student, who looked around before pointing at himself. “Yes, you. Come up here and get the projector screen down for me.”
“I miss thunderstorms, but the temperate weather is good for my old bones.” Myers says. “I hear your coven has been doing well.”
His comm lit up with searing bright light, crackling on. “Dean, wherever you are, you need to go meet Pam at the AGF room
“Only Charlie and me figured it out. I didn't mean to - you knew my secret, so I just wanted, I mean-“
Dean groaned at that and found himself almost falling into the backseat with Castiel when they managed to get the door open. In such close quarters, he finally noticed that Castiel had pushed up his sleeves, revealing silvery scars along his forearms, a particularly deep one on the inside of his left elbow.
“No-“ Pam told him, “no, I think our receptor is working fine. Listen.” Pam fiddled with the console in front of her, and then the speakers let out a high pitched hum, like the feedback loop in a speaker.
“No?” Dean’s chuckle is dark and warm when Castiel spreads his legs and sags closer. “What happened to all that stuff about tearing up the pages? Making it up as we go?” He squeezes on a downstroke, smears a bead of precum on the upstroke, and then repeats it all over again.
“It’s fine, Cas,” Dean says, with exaggerated patience. “It can’t be that bad. Just read the question.”
There’s a few beats of silence, and then Castiel sighs. “Can I – I’d like to tell you something. It’s a little depressing. Do you remember the day we met? I don’t know if you realized, but I had been… upset, and you told me everything was going to be alright.”
“Yeah?” Castiel means to reply, but somehow the intonation gets away from him. It issues like a challenge.
“No. This is it for me. This is what’s real. Whatever else happens, this is where I end up. The only thing worse than an eternity in here is getting out only to be thrown back in.” Dean didn’t weep. Didn’t beg again. He said it with bitterness and conviction. It was the truth to him.
That pulls Castiel up short. It’s already time for lunch? The clock tells him it’s 11:45, and Castiel realizes with a numb sort of horror that he’s been at work for four hours and only responded to one email. His inbox is flooded with new messages waiting for a response… and he’s going to take lunch.
P.S.: I'm not above begging for comments- please consider leaving some. I await them with much nailbiting anxiousness and am always thrilled by any feedback! Love y'all ♥
Castiel struggles to believe this. How is this possible? It’s too much of a coincidence. Maybe Charlie hacked his phone and found Dean somehow, but Dean seemed to know Charlie too. Castiel’s mind races, but there are too many unknowns, and he needs to be present.
Castiel’s shoulder bumps into his and he looks up. And catches sight of his– boyfriend’s? Well, for now, at least, his boyfriend’s handsome profile. Not for the first time Dean thinks, Castiel has a face that was made to be admired. He’s so effortlessly beautiful like this, chin tucked into a scarf, one eyebrow arched as he studies the pavement, deep in contemplation.
Dean drops his head, chuckling. It’s the clumsiest line ever. He can feel his face heat up with a blush, but he tries to anchor himself with his hands clasped around the cool glass holding his beer.
Dean hoists the advent calendar he’s holding onto the top shelf at the Coffee Grind, and looks over his shoulder from his step stool. “Yeah?”
“It’s a series,” Sam huffs, brow furrowed. “We already did those. It’s like the one where the strangers kiss each other for the first time–”
Jane informs Castiel that Dean and about a half dozen other men have been gone for a week. The camp is filled with just enough arms and able bodies to form a protective perimeter. Chuck, Jane and two other men oversee the flurry of activity that engages the civilians and children of the camp. One woman in particular isn’t content to be relegated to laundry. By the time Castiel finds Chuck, she’s arguing with him vehemently, but she stops and walks away when she catches sight of Castiel.
“Was not telling me about Daphne a little sketchy? Probably, yeah.” Dean shrugs, then lifts an arm to wrap around Castiel’s shoulders. Castiel puts up a token resistance, because he doesn’t deserve to be comforted, but eventually he melts into Dean’s warmth.
It’s more than that, though. Yes, the flirting is insincere and jocular, but moments like these make Castiel think that there’s more to things than he forces himself to believe.
Dean reacts faster. He drops to the ground, and yells at Castiel to take cover. More bullets rain through the open window. Castiel doesn’t move. Instead he stares out.
The calm that settles over the camp is mutinous, but no one protests. They disperse almost immediately and Dean picks Castiel’s unmoving form out of the leaving crowd. Dean jerks his head towards his cabin and Castiel follows.
“We think they’re working together. They’ve killed– oh.” The officer stops short at the sight of the body behind Dean and curses. “Jesus. I’ve lived in Sycamore and worked in this town my whole life, and I’ve never seen anything like this. I couldn’t explain if I tried, so you just go on ahead to the student center. I have to call this in.”
Castiel masturbates soundlessly in the shower. He thinks of Dean. Him of the broken heart and big hands. Of the wondering, stunned look in his eyes when Castiel follows wherever he goes. He imagines Dean laughing with ease, touching him without guile. The knot at the base of his cock swells and purples as he comes, spilling white strings that float into the drain. He touches the oversensitive flesh gingerly, trying to sheath it in the warmth of his palms, but it’s a poor substitute for a channel. The orgasm itself clears his mind and relaxes his body. Without a channel to catch, the knot goes down as he slowly dries and dresses himself.
He shakes the snow out of his hair and gets about thawing his icy fingertips as he heads straight for the back room, but stops short at the snap of fingers. Crowley.
Dean shrugs a shoulder. “So you’re human. It took you a while to do the right thing. But hey, you got there before you caused any serious damage. Honestly, Cas, if this is really the worst thing you’ve done, it’s a far cry from horrible. You fucked up. Join the club. What matters is that you tried.”
Castiel sounds so serious, so perfectly earnest, it reminds Dean of the beginning. Of Castiel’s ill-fated trip to the drug store across the street. That first Thanksgiving. Castiel’s graduation. Every kiss and every promise in between.
Chuck scratches absently in the margin of his papers on the clipboard. "What was that like anyway? Heaven? If you don't mind me asking. Do you hate it here?"
Somehow it works even though they’re so different. Where Castiel is restrained and methodical, Dean is a colorful riot of passions and widely ranging interests. It’s gotten to the point where just hearing from him tends to turn Castiel into a smiling goof.
Dean turns his back to the tower and starts walking to the station. “It’s the student center. The upper floors are a hotel.”
Not one of the possessed survived the massacre in the student center. The cops handed over copies of what they could get at such short notice. Only a small percentage of the students were actually in their system. The files contain generally useless documents– transcripts, administrative records from the university, and in one notable case, a job application attached with a letter of recommendation.
Castiel’s head snaps up. He hadn’t heard Charlie walk over, or even open the door to his office. And his door has a purposely squeaky hinge. Even when he was completely engrossed in work, he kept a ear out for footsteps. A necessary skill when working for Zachariah, who liked to come up with cruel and unusual punishments for his unsuspecting underlings.
“Are we doing this?” Cas asks, when they come up for air. He looks a little afraid. Dean wants to wipe that look away forever. He winds his arms around Cas a little tighter and grins.
“I keep telling that kid to get a grip, but this time… Sam had it coming to him.” Bobby flips morosely through some notes on the table. He glances at Castiel. “Didn’t think it’d get to you, though.”
Dean shakes his head, and for once swallows before he replies. “No– well, sorta. A few reasons. It was more to get some intel in general. Try to figure out what's new, where the Colt is, blah blah.”
Sometimes it’s complicated to extract the meaning behind Dean’s metaphors. In this case, it’s a nuisance. Castiel narrows his eyes. “Yes.”
“I’ll move out, if that will make it easier,” he says. He doesn’t mind the trouble. He could move in with Gabriel until he finds his own place.
“I went a little overboard with the pie,” Jess warns, and brings over four pies with Charlie’s help. “And I may have had an ulterior motive.” There’s apple and pumpkin and pecan and sweet potato, and Dean could kiss her. She grins when Dean whistles, low and appreciative. “Glad you’re impressed, brother-in-law.”
Castiel knows that. He knows exactly what Dean likes. That Dean’s desires in life are simple. A good burger and homemade pie. Cheap beer and good company. A clean kitchen and a memory foam mattress. He loves his brother, adores his sister-in-law, dotes on his nephew, and is vulnerable with and kind to even estranged lovers like Crowley. He worries about everyone, even strangers he accidentally and occasionally texts.
Dean mutters something that sounds suspiciously like ‘waste of time’ under his breath but he exhales and agrees.
The ride up to the third floor in the elevator is quiet as Castiel checks his phone. “You were right. Dr. Sexy
Castiel nods, not trusting himself. Even the rich timbre of Dean’s voice, deeper than Castiel was expecting it to be, is inexorably attractive.
“It’s not raining hellfire or brimstone on us yet, and I gotta eat,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “So hold your horses, alright?”
“Have a little too much fun?” he jokes, scanning and bagging Castiel’s purchases of the day: coffee filters, cocoa powder and brown sugar.
Still, Castiel throws caution to the wind and taps send. Worst case scenario, the mystery texter loses his temper and decides to stop talking to him. Or maybe, since Castiel is supposed to want that, it’s the best case scenario?
Castiel suppresses the spike of irritation, but he can’t help the bitterness in his voice when he corrects her. “I’m not an angel. Not anymore.”
They didn’t halve and quarter themselves in self-examination. As he drives, Castiel supposes he’s an ‘angel’ on a technicality, only by the most generous of definitions. Inside, unlike any angel, he hurts as only a human would. It’s the only thing that feels real. It’s a pain so terrible, yet so intangible. He feels quartered and drawn, as the humans say. He is numb with grief. He never knew it could feel like this. Never knew that numbness itself was a feeling. The agony can be a gaping hole, identifiable only by the sinkhole sensitivity around the very frayed edges of the wound.
Dean mentally kicks himself. He’s been pretty good about not flirting with Castiel even though he flirts with almost every customer. Well, he charms the other customers. The only one he has any real interest in is Castiel.
“That’s not– I mean. You’re hot as fuck.” The words spill out before Dean means for them to. Damn Cas and his stupid way of pulling him into an argument. Dean rubs the back of his neck, knowing his face is aflame and coughs. “You’re… you look good, Cas. Your eyes. Those are some killer, uh, peepers.”
“Twenty seven people are dead, Agent Costello,” the man says, voice hard. “Two of them are my officers. We’re overwhelmed. We need to know what’s going on, and we need to know now.” He rubs the sweat from his brow.
Castiel looks up to see Dean standing over him, face black as hell, illuminated by the sun at his back.
As if sensing Castiel’s thoughts, Dean stops. Then he turns and picks up a rifle from the crate behind him and hands it to Castiel.
Castiel looks up at the tower down the street from the police station. The sun begins to rise, and the sky blushes a sweet rose. All the buildings are squat, barely over two stories. Except for one.
“So– what now you don’t got a problem? You’re gonna do this?” Dean demands, anger simmering in his chest. He can’t just forget what happened. What he saw. Meg, all over Cas. Kissing him–
Still, he can’t forget his manners. This opportunity came at Ellen’s recommendation and she has always been a kind, generous boss. At this point, his best option is to work his way up to a more permanent position, and he’s sure she’ll let him. For now though, Dean forces himself to look up, step forward and shake Bobby Singer’s hand.
Cas grins, and Dean realizes he’s a little tipsy. The grin turns into a chuckle and Dean finds himself smiling as well. He knows exactly what Cas is remembering.
Something charged ripples through the room and Castiel grips his head against the ache it brings on. He struggles to understand what’s happening, but all he knows is that he has the inexplicable urge to cower on the floor with his tail between his legs and whimper. Sam appears to be similarly affected. The darkness flickers away, and in its place his features are a grimace of remorse.
By the time Castiel is ready to leave for the day, he’s worked eleven hours. He turns his phone on as he walks to his car, squinting as it starts to light up with notifications.
The cut is clean, the bloodshed minimal. Getting to this point was difficult, but now that they’re here, it’s easy. It makes sense. Her eyes are dry when she looks at Castiel, and he knows that it’s goodbye.
“If someone offered you a million dollars to never talk to me again, would you take it?” he reads off the next card.
Dean looks at him, expression unreadable. His eyes are hard and unyielding, skin smudged with dirt, posture rigid. Finally he asks, “How many did you take?”
The aftermath is a hellscape. Dean can't sleep. The Mark is torture, a seething serpent, but worse than that is the regret. He sees Cas' face everywhere, bloodied and bruised. He feels sick with guilt. Running away doesn't shake it off, because Cas has gotten inside, under his skin, into his heart. He's been saying it for sometime now. Love. It's terrifying. He glimpses himself in the mirror and sees a monster. Tormented by regret and guilt, but a monster all the same. He closes his eyes and sees Cas.
Castiel breathes slowly, stares at the darkened ceiling, and wonders what it would be like to slowly forget things and never recover. Now that he’s not focused on something, he hears the quiet sounds around the house. The gentle background hum of the dishwasher. Daphne in the living room, watching the news with the volume on low– speaking of Daphne, Castiel’s mind wanders.
“Yeah?” Dean runs his hands down Castiel’s back, and wraps a leg around Castiel’s hips. “How d’you want me?”
Eventually, Castiel steps out of the cabin. He doesn't know how long it’s been. He stopped counting hours. Then days.
“Um.” Dean draws back, scratching his cheek. He thinks back to the first time he met Cas. He’d been drunk and he’d been immediately interested in the broody, dark-haired hottie in the corner. He’d hit on Cas.
No, thinking about the picture does no good. In fact, all it does is throw into relief the growing disparities between Castiel and Daphne. He doesn’t love her, and he’s known that for a while. And now he questions if he finds her attractive. If he ever did. If there’s something about her that captivates him. Maybe it’s something he’s forgotten because he’s used to it. Maybe he just needs to see it again in a new light.
He can’t begin to understand what he’s saying, or why he’s saying it, but Dean visibly closes off. He tries to tug his hand back, but Castiel’s grip tightens almost entirely involuntarily. That puts a different expression on Dean’s face, and it’s one that Castiel recognizes: anger.
Castiel wakes up sweating and in agony. There’s also the sound of insistent knocking. He reaches blindly for the bottle of pills on the nightstand and manages a hoarse call of, “Come in.”
“Consider those accounts balanced.” Dean’s touch is firmer now, fingertips tripping over the sensitive head, moving slow and easy. Testing the waters. He stops. “You could just say you don’t like it, you know.”
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel glances over Dean’s shoulder curiously, and then back at Dean. “What are you doing here?”
“I don’t know.” Dean elbows him and steps inside, tossing the duffel onto the nearest twin. He sets the files down a little more carefully on the small coffee table in the corner before slumping in the chair by it.
Castiel crawls over him, trying to think. He reaches back, taking out the gun he had tucked in the waistband of his jeans. The right leg of his jeans is streaked bright red with wet paint. The devil’s trap. Broken. He hears the footsteps and sees the shadow cast along the wall before a head looks over the edge of the desk. It’s a man. His eyes are black. Castiel shoots him in the face. The Croat goes down with a choked cry of surprise, slumping over the desk, dripping blood over him.
The policeman snorts. “Well, work on it fast. This thing’s escalating every second, and it makes no goddamn sense. What connection do these kids have with the girl? And why are they going on killing sprees?”
One of the older hunters standing near the back puts his hand up. “They’ve got generators at the edge of the camp, right by the unused cabins. We could get those running. For essentials?”
“Oh, that’s a shame,” Daphne laments, stepping in his way and taking his plate. “I really liked Dorothy. They made a cute couple. I hope they can work it out. Oh, can you zip me up?”
Cas walks past him, and Dean’s heart drops. He turns and sees Cas at the table, picking up a card from his discard pile. He tries to shove it in Dean’s hand.
Every now and then, Dean catches him perusing the aisles carefully, an intense stare on his face as he picks up every jar and box and roll, and reads all the minutiae about each thing. Sometimes Castiel is in and out in five minutes, grabbing granola bars and gum, or milk and honey, or band-aids and bread and candy. Other days are slower, and after much intense deliberation he chooses something from the meager pre-packaged comfort food offerings of the store: boxed mac and cheese, frozen lasagna, hot pockets, frozen pizza, ice cream, nutella, pepperidge farm cookies, and Dean’s personal favorite, Twinkies. If Castiel stops by during Dean’s evening shift, it’s usually to buy liquor and popcorn. Or barbecue flavored chips and a ranch dip. Dean wonders who Castiel is partying with, and wistfully hopes that someday it might be him.
Worse, tricked or not, Cas no doubt already felt responsible. But Cas had always broken too vastly. These attempts at making amends were too small. Playing sorry, restocking shelves. He’s trying to hold onto that. And he’s losing. He’s lost.
Dean shrugs. “Probably something in the lore.” He nods at Castiel. “You got any ideas? Don’t y’all have a plan or whatever, for when Lucifer gets out? What’s Michael gonna use to fight him?”
“Do you want to come to my apartment after?” Castiel asks, squeezing Dean’s hand a few moments later. “I can help you look for jobs. Or help you update your resume. Or we can just relax. Whatever you need.”
“This doesn’t look right…” Castiel frowns. His cheeks go a little pink and his shoulders go rigid. “Thank you, but Dean, you shouldn’t have.”
“Yes,” Castiel replies. He watches Dean walk away for a moment before he starts the jeep and does as instructed.
Somehow he’d imagined that he’d do the asking. That he’d have worked up the nerve to break up with Daphne by now. That he’d have the balls to ask Dean out. Dean likes cheeseburgers, so Castiel would take him to the Roadhouse. They’d talk like old friends, kiss like new lovers, it’d be good. It could be so good.
Castiel doesn't know why he bothers insisting anymore, since the guy consistently refuses to believe he has the wrong number. Still, he tries again. Now that they've been talking for little over an hour, it feels deceptive to let the guy continue thinking he's talking to someone else without at least trying to correct the misunderstanding.
Castiel cups his face with both hands, kissing back with a satisfied hum. He rests his forehead against Dean’s, dodging Dean’s attempt to kiss him again with a chuckle.
“I told you this the first time. I remember now. And I know you remember I told you. This is how it ends. You can’t force him to use the blade he controls on himself.”
“Mhmm, let me just look for that. Should be lying around here somewhere. I’m Garth, by the way, and you are… ?”
It’s not particularly cold yet, considering it’s September, but the temperatures are hardly unbearable– until Castiel realizes that the man means the biological cycle. Then the scent hits Castiel. It’s not just the smoke. The underlying notes are damp and musky, not altogether unpleasant, but only just approaching enticing. The man shifts uncomfortably and Castiel tries to pretend he wasn’t sniffing. Castiel decides he’s not fond of this smell either.
Castiel thinks he’d rather err on the side of caution. “May I have a few of your cigarettes, if you can spare them?”
Apparently, there’s just no convincing this man that he’s not Crowley either, so Castiel changes the subject.
Castiel considers his options. Continuing to talk about this is only going to antagonize Dean more. They have time. The world will still be ending next week.
“I thought Sam would be good for the position,” Castiel says, looking sheepish. “Since I got a better offer.”
Castiel is a bright sun at the center of this newfound life. It’s a relationship like Dean never knew it could be. Castiel is friend and confidant, but he’s also mentor and witness, and yeah, Dean has to admit, he is also a lover. They kiss and make love, but they also bicker and argue, and they fight and make up. Dean screws up, as expected, and for some dumb reason Castiel forgives him.
Castiel groans, picking up a pack of mini m&m’s before deciding against it. “Hardly.” He glares at the card reader. “Papers. And exams. Ten million of them all at once.”
“I think it has been a good relationship,” Cas says, looking thoughtful. But he’s looking at Sam– at the cameras, when he answers. “I would consider Dean my friend. My best friend, actually. I think we care about each other a lot. Like any two people with different personalities who cohabit the same space we occasionally disagree, but I like living with Dean.” He turns to smile at Dean tentatively. “And I’d like to continue being roommates– and friends– for the foreseeable future.”
“Uh huh.” Dean's smile is wry. “Tell you what, even though that’s strictly for the kids, I’ll hook you up. One jar.”
Dean Winchester wouldn’t remember this, no. Not in his mind or in his flesh and bones. His soul, however, wherever it went, no matter how well-concealed it was, remembered. Every so often, it would pull when Dean prayed, as the magnet draws the needle north. Come back, it called in tandem with Dean’s voice, an atomic thrum that demanded a response. Come home.
It takes him a few more seconds, but Dean manages a smile. “Give me another shot? Let’s eat. It’ll be nice.”
There’s no one he knows who would text him at this hour… unless it was an emergency. Or maybe it’s Daphne. Castiel grabs his phone.
when he hadn’t met Dean in person. It was a whole other can of worms to actually do it when he could hear Dean whistling in the kitchen as he cleaned up after dinner. When he would hear Dean laughing at his awkwardness.
Castiel is not sure why he doesn’t tell Dean about Daphne. It leaves a bad taste in his mouth, but he doesn’t even want to bring up the fact that she exists. That he has a girlfriend he doesn’t love (probably never has), let alone that he wants to break up with her. Dean would probably have decent advice on the topic, given that he’s had at least one unwanted relationship that Castiel knows about. Still, Castiel can’t bring himself to do it.
Dean’s knuckles whiten around the steering wheel. A muscle jumps in his jaw, but he doesn’t speak. They cross a few more miles in silence. The fields strip away as the jeep covers ground, husks of overgrown unharvested crop giving way to scorched, barren earth.
And immediately curses himself for it. God, that was stupid. This isn’t a business meeting. Dean takes it in his stride, though. He blinks a few times, but takes Castiel’s hand and shakes it once, firm and decisive.
Dean asks him to drive, reversing their usual positions, and is silent for the duration of the trip back to the camp. He doesn’t reply. He doesn't appear to have heard. He sits with the rifle across his lap and stares at the empty road.
Castiel finds Dean beside one of the jeeps early the next morning, hauling a duffel into the passenger seat. He’s in the driver’s seat by the time Castiel catches up to him.
When Castiel doesn’t reply, Dean’s expression hardens again. He begins to stitch the wound shut quickly and efficiently.
Dean looks up. He’s crouched on the floor with his knees pulled to his chest and his arms covering his head. Blood wells from the tiny cuts on his wrists. There’s broken glass pieces in his forehead, millimeters from his eyes. A second later, his eyes widen in fear, and he reaches to pull Castiel down.
Dean. He needs to warn Dean. They need to move. Leave. Preferably head back to the camp. He gets to his feet. His knees wobble. He takes two steps towards the door when he hears the quiet click of the safety and ducks. It’s too late. He gets hit in the shoulder and falls.
Castiel just lets out a surprised laugh, and Dean finds himself smiling back, heart thumping. Their fingers brush when Dean hands him the bags and the receipt. Instead of just murmuring his usual thanks and leaving, Castiel looks at the receipt. Dean flushes.
The bell above the door chimes when he pushes it open, but no one seems to take notice. There’s a crash from somewhere further in the shop, a muffled curse and some laughter– then the sound of a door being pushed open.
There’s about thirty seconds of dead air before Dean raps his fingers on the table to get Cas’ attention. “Cas, hey. Don't hurt yourself. Just take a drink.”
For a moment, Castiel stays frozen. He doesn’t know how to process this. It’s too strange, too unnatural for it to be coincidence. And yet, he can’t think about that. He can’t wonder how this is possible.
Castiel stares at his computer for a good ten minutes before he realizes he’s reread the same email four times.
Ramesh looks unconvinced, and continues to haggle over the amount Dean owes him. Castiel loses his patience and starts to step forward, but Dean shifts on his feet to block him from getting to the receptionist. “Alright, buddy, whatever. Just charge the card and point me to the nearest place I can grab some breakfast.”
“Dean. What’re you doing?” Castiel asks. The contraction wobbles, destabilizing his words, reflecting his own unsteadiness. He’s off-kilter. Out of bounds. They don’t cross the lines. It hurts to swallow again, but his breaths are wet and labored and Castiel is afraid he might set off a coughing fit. Dean lifts his head to meet Castiel’s gaze. His expression is calculating.
Castiel considers his powerlessness. He stares at his open hands in his lap, the lines of fate running across his palms and contemplates how he can’t help Dean. He can’t do anything for Dean. He can’t do anything but follow Dean. Twilight spreads across the horizon in a splash of colors– deep blue, orange, purple, shocking pink. The world is simultaneously beautiful and bleak.
Castiel hesitates. It’s not that he’s not interested, exactly. It’s a strange situation. Certainly not one he’s ever been in before. Then again, he is in a relationship. The problem is that he is interested. At least, his dick is.
Daphne shrugs. “We were barely a couple. In fact, we were better roommates. I was happy, but I could see you weren’t. I thought you were bored but I didn’t know how to fix it. I saw the signs, and I kept trying to stall. I knew you wanted to leave, and I thought if I just kept you from saying it out loud that you’d change your mind. And then something changed. The last couple months you’ve been… restless.”
“That pessimism? It ain’t cute,” Dean says firmly, moving the tray from the nightstand to a spot on the bed between them. There's a glass of water beside the bowl of soup. The liquids slosh precariously close to the edges but nothing spills. Dean is careful as he offers Castiel the water first, holding the glass to Castiel’s cracking lips. Castiel drinks it all. He hadn't realized he was thirsty.
Jack is bleeding a considerable amount from a head injury. His shirt is ripped and the tattoo below his throat has been scratched at, though not completely destroyed. Possible infection. He’s breathing.  Dean is shaking, Castiel realizes, when he turns to look at him.
Now, he catalogues it for private contemplation and revision. Dean: a myriad contrasts. The strong jaw. The soft mouth. Yes, now it’s the flesh that tempts Castiel. Blood trickles from a cut across Dean’s temple and his mouth is slack circle, dragging wounded breaths.
Risa lets go of Castiel’s hands to fidget with the hem of the blanket drawn up to her lap. She lifts her chin up at Dean, defiant. “That was for the kids.”
“When you’re lucid. I promise the world will still be going to hell in the morning,” Dean says. He crosses the room to manhandle Castiel back onto the pillows and arranges Castiel on his side, facing the door. In an unexpected gesture he sweeps a palm across Castiel’s forehead, pushing his hair back so it doesn’t stick damply. Relaxed, Castiel hums involuntarily. Oddly, he feels hungry for more of the touch. Before, the sensation was sharp and amplified and acutely uncomfortable to bear. Now, it’s warm with Dean’s body heat. The light pressure of the touch siphons off some tension.
He grits his teeth at the agony shooting down his protesting arm and lifts it to take aim when the sound of gunshot makes him flinch. The Croat freezes, mouth open. Dead center in the woman's forehead is the small black circle of a bullet. She dies without another sound.
“With what?” Sam demands, frustrated. “The Colt’s in the wind. Any other archangel killing weapons you know about just laying around? Go ahead, share with the class, Dean.”
"Fine," he lies thickly around the sweet, sugary goodness, because that's how it went now. He tries not to close his eyes. The phosphenes branded on his eyelids are the bright, blue, dead eyes; remnants of his nightmare.
“On your back. Keep your arms above your head.” Castiel sits back as Dean moves to obey. He spends a moment contemplating the smooth expanse of golden, freckled skin beneath him, and then he flips around to bury his head between Dean’s legs.
Dean processes this for a second, trying not to smile. “So you're saying you’d help me if it was like, a revenge murder, but not if I just did it to get my rocks off or something?”
He looks across the table and Cas is poking at a slice of avocado in interest, with the amount of intensity normally reserved for smiting. He wants to ask, because he remembered Cas scarfing down way too many burgers and drinking a liquor store, but then again there had been extenuating circumstances on both those occasions. He makes a half-hearted attempt to submit to the evil salad instead. Rifles through the leaves with his fork. Pomegranate seeds glitter like gems unearthed from a rubble and yeah, Dean's officially done. They'd had a perfectly good evening. Pizza. Beer.
Musty carpeted floors. Dean grimaces as he moves further into the motel room. Could be worse, much worse. When he drops his duffel at the foot of the bed closest to the door he turns to find Cas still at the threshold.
“They should be so lucky,” Dean murmurs, and the smirk that tugs his lips up is strangely endearing.
“I was under the impression that the sexual frustration was simply endured or suppressed.” Castiel nods to himself in understanding. “I suppose, ideally, in the presence of a willing mate, engaging in intercourse would be the solution. It follows that in the absence of one, masturbation would be preferable. It makes sense.”
The question is probably plastered on Dean’s face even though he shows great restraint by not asking in outright derision.
Instead of dignifying that with a response, Castiel leans back against the vinyl seat and looks out the window.
“Weed. Dean considered bringing you some,” the man explains when Castiel asks him what it is. Castiel distinctly remembers his name being Rich. Though it may have also been Mark. “You wanna try?”
“I have the sawed-off,” Castiel says, even as he moves to accept it. It’s heavier than it looks, though not much heavier than he expects it to be.
“That way we start on the same page,” Cas explains, and it makes no sense. “Besides, like you said, it’s free.” Dean shakes his head, but obediently pours out a shot for Cas as well.
Dean feels... something. It's wiser not to try and name it. "I'm sure she will," he reassures Cas. "It's an ugly, weird little thing. What's not to like?"
Castiel was the one charged with finding the Righteous Man and so he was the one who found the Righteous Man. Dean Winchester, his face like hell, little more than the blood that once ran through his veins. All that was left of him was a blackened miasma, the rot of hell that took over his core. All that fear, all that pain, all that anger, all that shame.
Castiel stares at his phone, amused but uncertain. He doesn’t know how to explain that he just sort of missed it? There’s no real reason behind why he hasn’t watched the movies beyond the fact that he simply isn’t inclined to consume much television. Or movies, for that matter. It didn’t help that he was raised in a very strict, religious household. But he’d much rather not talk about that if he doesn’t have to.
Dean grins. “Lunch's on me.” He starts to rush Castiel out the door, and Castiel doesn’t quite manage to stifle a yelp when Dean slaps his ass. “Let’s go, hotstuff.”
His conversations with Dean have trickled to a stop over the past week or so. Castiel thumbs through their old exchanges and smiles fondly at the past.
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam says warmly, looking suspiciously like he’s gonna cry. For once, Dean gives him a pass.
Sam, Charlie and Castiel’s friend, Gabriel, are busy arguing loudly. They don’t notice when Dean scoots closer to Castiel, metal legs of his barstool screeching across the floor.
