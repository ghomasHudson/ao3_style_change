He had his own car.
“Dad!” Jack cried, raising the wrapped box he held in his small fists. “Look what Santa brought!”
Dean watched with a smile as his brother was dragged away into the mall's cheap arcade room. When they disappeared behind a row of machines Dean finally looked away and to Castiel who was attempting to calm down Jack, the child having grabbed Castiel's left arm and was shaking it as harshly as he could. While Castiel's casted arm held a few shopping bags.
Dean grit his teeth, “Yah-” He muttered, “I was just leavin’”
Dean turned away, heart hammering, ringing through his ears. He stopped in front of Cas’s apartment, raising his fist and giving a loud knock against the wood. A breath parted his lips, his eyes glancing to the floor, studying the ugly floral printed carpet that had been chosen for the building's hallways. Dean shifted his weight from one foot to the other, pushing his hands into his pockets, then taking them out.
For a moment they sat in complete silence, Dean’s gaze on the empty glass in his hand, studying the little bit of alcohol left in it. His gaze stayed there for another second before he stood from his bed, a low creaking coming as he walked across the room and to the small kitchen where he’d left the bottle of gin.
“Nothing,” Dean whispered, “I’m sorry.”
“Oh come on.”
Slowly Dean reached in, picking up the small bundle of blanket, and bringing it to his chest. His eyes never left her face with each motion, he wanted to look at her for as long as possible. Memorize every feature, and detail, over and over in fear that when they left her he would forget his daughter.
“Do you have birthday plans yet?” Lee asked as Dean grabbed his phone from the bedside table, the screen immediately lighting with a text from Crowley, ‘On my way.’
“I wouldn’t bother, they were able to find someone else to cover for you.”
I hope you all had a great first of October!
“Hey,” Dean began slowly. He paused as Ellie turned to him, the trees lights casting shadows across her tear stained cheeks. “Why’re you hiding on us?”
Dean followed Castiel through the door, and into the building's lobby, a large room that much to Dean’s relief was fairly empty. With a minimalistic design, and only a  few people filling the large room, two at the far right corner waiting for an elevator, and one man stood behind a desk in the centre of the room.
Cas stared at the child for  another moment, the room sitting in a stiff silence. Dean almost took another step forward, to join Cas in making sure the child was okay, that not a single bruise or scratch marked his skin. Though no matter how much Dean wanted, he stayed in his spot, giving Cas the space that he deserved.
“He’s alright I suppose, he was better looking before he had his haircut.”
Dean looked down to his coffee. His heart was racing and he hadn't even gotten within five feet of castiel, hands sweaty against the white mug.
Dean didn’t respond, instead clenching his teeth together, attempting to stop the forming tears, and the burning at his nose. That’s all he seemed to do since rehab, cry and try to breath. Panic, and tear his hair out. Want to die, yet never find the courage to do the final step.
“Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter,” Dean continues, his voice hanging through the silent night, only broken by their footsteps as they move across the deck. “Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here.” Cas’s lips press lightly to Dean’s neck and he replies by giving Cas’s hand a gentle squeeze, it’s all he can manage. Any words would ruin the moment, nothing he could say would be as gentle as them swaying, sharing one another's warmth as the wind continues to blow.
He lifted the cup to his lips, taking another sip. As the silence fell Dean’s smile dropped, the muffled sounds of screaming, becoming clear. “What?” Dean muttered. He placed the tea cup down, as he stood up from the ground, walking slowly to the wall where Ellie’s bed was pushed against. He leant closer, the noises becoming more clear the closer he got until he  had his ear pressed to it, the words loud but muffled except for the occasional swear.
Sam took a shaken breath, then nodding agrrence. Together they walked to the front of the class where the teachers desk sat, a short man standing behind it.
“That’s what happens when you kidnap kids.” Dean spat. His gaze didn't leave Cas, the other looking back with the same intensity until Sam stepped between them.
Shit.
“Shower together.”
Cas gave a small laugh, Dean smiling at the other. "When I was young we went to sea world." Cas began explain, Dean watching as Cas looked down to creek. His expression was calm, his body posture much the same, as if going for Friday walks was a common occurrence. Something they'd always done and would continue to do. Standing close, under the moon light, alone in the park, so close that Dean could lean in if he'd wanted to "My father, I still don't understand why, had thought it would be a good idea to hold me over one of the tanks, then dropped me into the orca tank because my sister needed her shoe tied."
He had considered cutting it away, once, twice, the thought was always at the back of his mind. Grab one of their many knives and slowly carve out his own skin, cut himself thigh gaps, force a thin waist. Sam was the only thing keeping him from trying.
“You make a peanut butter and honey sandwich and expect me not to enjoy it?” Dean says, finishing the sandwich.
“Cas?”
It’s one fist to the face after another. Skin breaks, blood trickles down his nose and sprays out of his mouth and Dean thinks it’s to a point where bones are cracking and cartilage is dislodging. The left side of his face is so splintered with pain Dean can’t even feel it to begin with.
But ever since that day, Dean has caught himself wondering what it would be like. How would he react? Would it catch him off guard? Would he see it from a mile away? How could he accept those words were meant for him? He certainly doesn’t deserve them. But a very small, very concealed part of Dean wants them.
Castiel doesn't like the way his heart race increases at the thought of not having a home, at not being with Dean. Castiel doesn't know what he considers a home or where he could find it for himself, and then he looks to Dean, and all those worries flutter away on butterfly wings. He tries to focus on Dean's voice, on his plans for them when they get back, but it isn't working. He's talking about everything Castiel wants to distract himself from.
“Ever easy to please. . .”
The goo swallows his feet, enveloping his boots. It starts to swallow them, swirling up and around his ankles.
Cas sits on top of the comforter, passing a hand over the worn cotton. The orange and red flowers stand out against the periwinkle cover. Dean, on the other hand, unties his boots and crawls underneath the blanket. He leans back on his elbows, inclining his head towards Cas.
Jack lets go of Dean’s pinkie, and his tongue feels for something that will actually feed him. No such luck. Jack opens his mouth to start crying again as Dean grabs the bottle in the cup, giving the contents a swirl, and tests the formula against his own skin.
Dean stares Cas in the eyes. There’s not enough light for Cas to see their colour.
The radio crackles, and a country melody fills the truck cab.
The Empty follows the line of Dean’s jaw, its lifeless hold cradling his cheeks. It swims up the bridge of his nose, like a mask. Its trickles from his hairline, streaming down his face.
“Sandwiches. Jack helped me make them before Bobby and Rufus picked him up.”
Dean shifts the truck into drive and navigates the obstacle of the ditch with ease. With a slight jostle, the tires are grinding against gravel road. Some of the rocks kick up around the tires, clinking against the shell of the truck.
“That’s all, huh?” Dean asks. “Let’s take a walk.”
They’re in Baby. They're driving home. The sun has nearly set, the sky a ferocious blend of blood oranges and dark lavenders, melting together in pink strokes across the clouds. A deep blue settles from above.
Dean’s lip trembles. “So is that real enough?”
He’s tired.
Cas loves when Dean talks. He loves when he has a million things to ramble on about but nothing to say. Because he does. There’s so much hidden beneath the surface, trickling out between the Kurt Russell trivia and the plot synopsis of the latest Star Trek episode. Sometimes he lets things slip. Castiel isn’t sure if Dean lets them slip just for him, or if no one else notices. He’s seen Dean from the inside out, he knows what lies at his core, and he could stay there forever, if Dean would let him.
“I need you,
Cas rests his head on Dean’s. He hates to break the silence. He picks out the beginnings of Ursa Major. “Guess that makes two of us.”
The wind continues picking up speed. Its deafening as it howls and screams in Dean’s ears. Dean wonders if they’ll be ripped apart before it spits them out.
He kneels down beside Cas, heaving him up, fighting against The Empty's grip. He props Cas’ head against his leg, and reaches for his knife in Cas’ coat pocket. The blade splits the skin of Cas’ neck. Dean holds the vial to Cas’ neck, collecting the stream of crackling blue grace.
"Morning, Sunshine."
Dean shakes his head with a laugh, “No I think we can skip that next time.”
“I would love to go grocery shopping with you,” Cas says, resting a hand over Dean’s watch. “It’s a date.”
Dean drops the string of the necklace. "So what is it then?"
Cas’ heart warms. “What about the rain?”
Dean glances to look over Cas. “Yeah, no problem, bud,” he says, frowning. He turns the volume dial, letting the music run soft (
Cas smiles even brighter, all gums.
The ground starts bubbling in front of him, rocking the ground beneath him. The sludge spits and gurgles, and parts, revealing Castiel from its inner depths.
Dean’s head feels light to one side, his vision swims. He can’t see Castiel clearly through the swelling and the blood and the blurring. He doesn’t know how much longer he can hold on, how much time before –
“Are you sleepy?”
). “You good?”
“He and Eileen seem to have made a good business of it.”
Dean quickly finishes his line before wrapping up the project and setting it in the wicker basket next to the rocking chair. “I’ll get the keys.”
Dean picks at one of his nails, grimacing at the next song playing on the radio. “And we have to go visit this place in the middle of the goddamned night?”
What’s done is done. Dean said it, and he can’t take it back now. This is what he wanted, right?
Dean and takes a deep breath, and he waits. He brings his finger to Jack’s mouth, letting Jack latch on in an attempt to distract him from the wait. At the very least, it gives Dean a moment’s reprieve. Jack’s face almost begins to relax as he sucks on Dean’s pinkie, his cries quieting. Dean mouth tightens, pressing his lips together.
God, he hopes Cas can hear him.
There’s no colour, no life, no sunlight. It numbs his skin. It forces him to trust his gut. Something he should have done a long time ago.
“I know,” Dean says. He sounds reassuring.
Dean’s heart skips a beat. He lets his head fall, his hands scrape against the stone floor, gasping for breath. He can’t get enough air into his lungs, the back of his throat swollen and broken.
It’s supposed to get easier with time. That’s what – his parenting books say. They’ll fall into a rhythm, a routine, and soon enough parent and baby will bond.
“What’s up, Squish?”
, Cas keeps a hand on Dean’s. He’s tired, also another human sensation he’s getting used to. But with Dean singing along under his breath to the Led Zeppelin songs of their mixtape, its enough to send Cas into an easy sleep.
Cas thinks for a moment. The crickets have chirped up again, now that they’re done disturbing the peace of an empty field. Distantly, the deep croak of frogs from the creek further along the grid fills the air. The dark wraps around them in comfort, in shelter.
From behind them, back at the fire, the strum of a guitar fills the air, followed by the twang of a banjo. It’s far enough into the night that the family has pulled out the instruments. Cas wonders if the noise will be enough to wake Jack. He can see Dean running through the same thoughts. Thankfully, they keep the music quiet, plucking away at the strings in harmony rather than giving a full-blown musical performance.
Oh, how he misses him now.
The whole experience – growing up in the back of Baby, John never being around, losing his mother so young, and then the whole hunting thing – Dean couldn’t do that to another kid. And look at him – he wasn’t any sort of dad, let alone a decent human being. He had nothing good to pass along to the up-and-coming generation. Leave that to Sammy – he was always the better of the two of them anyways.
“You did?” Cas asks, looking back at Dean.
Cas doesn't look serene; his mouth is turned down, the lines deeply etched in his face. He looks pained, he looks exhausted.
It’s no different to the grasp of fear; nothing he hasn’t faced before. He should have fought it then. He’ll fight it now.
Dean knows how he feels, and maybe it’s foolish, to fall this fast, foolish to rush in like this when he’s on the brink begging for his friend to come back, to see him. He doesn’t know what it is or why he feels this way, but they’re already this deep. It’s all he’s got left.
“And splash around in the puddles?” Dean asks.
Dean pops the plastic lid open, and tugs at the wipe, letting it stick out of the container. He directs the container towards Cas. Cas pulls the wipe out, and scrubs at his hands. He grimaces again at the feeling of his skin against the wet wipe.
“Okay,” Sam hesitates, “and how exactly do you plan on getting them all back?”
“Up, up, Momma!” Jack says, looking to Dean. He has his arms raised way above his head, making grabby hands.
Ooze swirls around them, the wind whips at his skin, biting him. The Empty is creating a vacuum around them, the heart of the vortex.
Around his chest, The Empty retreats, sucking itself away from Dean’s heart. It pulls away from his hands, following the path of his arms back to his shoulders. He isn't burdened; he's glowing, he's free.
Jack nods again, and buries his head further into Dean’s flannel, and Dean rubs a hand up and down his back. Dean wishes they were in the rocking chair; he knows how much Jack likes the motion. He hums an old Johnny Cash song, letting the sound lull Jack to sleep.
Speaking of, there’s Cas. He’s sitting in a lawn chair, isolated from the main group, but close to where Claire and Kaia lie in the grass. His brow is relaxed, the bags under his eyes lessened now that he’s finally managing to sleep. The Empty had changed him, changed them both. It was slow progress, but progress nonetheless. Dean knew they would make it through; they always did. Some things just take time. He knows that better than anyone. Cas’ eyes are closed now, but Dean can see he’s not sleeping. His eyes are probably irritated by the smoke.
His eyelids fly open, and Dean sits up, his arms still around Cas. They're drenched and damp and stained with muddy, black residue.
It’s haunted Dean since the first night Cas left the Bunker. Cas had walked away, he didn’t want to hear what Dean had to say to him. Hell, Dean had nothing good to say to him that night. He just let him go. He’s tried not to dwell on it, but the thought itches at the heart of him. He didn’t say it. He let Cas walk away uncertain of his love. Dean can’t help but feel that Cas left that night certain that he was unloved.
He’s shouting and screaming at the abyss, calling out for Cas. It doesn’t do him any good; the ooze eats his words, smothering them.
It swims over his shoulders, wrapping around his collar bones. It drenches his clothes; the fabric fused against his skin. From behind, the ooze wraps around his stomach. The sludge rises, pressing against his ribs, crushing his chest.
“I can,” Cas says. “He’s happy. We’re happy. It’s time we get what we deserve.”
Sam blinks, taking a step back. “What?” is all he can manage to spit out.
He tries to ignore it, the cold ache in his chest. He tries to simply forget about him, to think every abhorrent and cruel thought he can muster about Cas. But with every negative thought he comes up with, countless bright and warm memories flood in, and it just brings him back to where he started.
“No, no, no,” Dean whispers under his breath, desperation clinging to every word. The crunch of his feet against the deadfall echoes around him.
It’s everything he never knew he wanted, everything that’s been staring him in the face for the past eight years, swaddled in his arms. He wants it, and in the dark, Dean realizes he’ll never have it. Not truly. Not without Cas.
Cas can’t stop his own smile from spilling across his face. “You trust me?”
Dean waves a hand at him, “Yeah, yeah. Where are we going?”
“With you?” Cas asks, “Yes. That would be nice.”
“Will you get the cooler from the back?” Cas asks, unlatching the hatch of the truck.
“Dean, it’s raining.”
“I didn’t.”
He ignores the stray tear rolling down his cheek, instead focusing on Jack. Jack is blinking at him, his eyes bleary.
Castiel has both hands wrapped around the angel tablet now, staring at it with a curiosity that should only belong to Cas. Castiel looks up from the tablet, and down at Dean. His brow furrows.
“Cas, I hope you can hear me.”
“Then what?” Dean spits back at him.
Cas’ eyes followed the yellow spec intently as it flew side to side through the air. At one point, the yellow bead of light disappeared. It took Cas aback briefly before returning. It eventually spiraled down, down, down to the grass, landing on one of the blades. Cas kneeled down, resting his elbows on the grass, and then his head in his hands, to observe the little creature so full of light.
“I’m driving,” Cas says. His hands twitch, he fights the urge lock them in a fist.
It leaves him shivering, shaking against the nothingness. The circulation returns; he stands to his feet. Blood rushes through his limbs, warming his hands. It burns under his skin. He stares at his left hand, pale against the inky sludge retreating from him. It's the only light he has against the darkness.
“What have you found now?” Dean asks in a quiet voice.
. He shudders at the thought. But that was a long time ago; their lives have changed so greatly since then.
let this weigh on him, too. And who knows? Maybe he can do it this time. Maybe against the timer counting down their demise, he can utter the words for Cas. If they’re going to be trapped here for all eternity, now’s as good a time as any. They’ve already wasted twelve years. What’s another three minutes?
Dean licks his lips, his ears twitch. “Jus’ give me something, man.”
. He sticks out a finger to offer the small Lampyridae. The bug reaches out one leg, then another, and soon enough it has crawled onto Cas.
Dean looks back down. Cas is awake; Cas is looking at him.
Cas walks to the passenger side without comment. He lets Dean air out his grievances to the crickets. He hopes the crickets enjoy this performance.
Doesn’t he?
Sam’s point does little to keep the grin from growing on Dean’s face. In fact, as Dean moves further into the library, the grin on his face seems to grow even bigger. “Sammy, you’re forgetting. We killed Chuck. The world is ours for the taking.” Dean claps his hands together.
Jack takes a big intake of breath and says, “Pleeeeaaase?”
Dean lets his hand fall away from Cas’ wrist. His throat doesn’t scratch and scream in agony with each intake of breath, he can rotate his jaw with ease, and he can’t feel the warm trickle of blood down his face.
Dean rocks Jack back and forth, shushing him lightly as they move from the bedroom to the kitchen. It manages to bring Jack’s volume down, but he still cries and cries all the way.
Dean places a foot on the first step before he pauses. He eyes Cas from the side. “You’re coming in, too?”
“What are you-?" Dean’s own brow furrows. "I said it, I said- I did it to save you!”
Cas presses a kiss to the crown of Dean’s head. “You were taking your time.”
Dean straightens, pointing a finger up to the sky. “We’ve got an in with the big guy.”
Dean does the same. “You saying this is something you could get used to?”
And maybe that was Dean’s first mistake – letting Cas find a place in his heart that overwhelms the years of self-loathing that eat away at him. Letting him think there was a chance.
, and he still finds himself falling further with each and every look.
Dean’s jaw is swelling, and he can only guess it’s shattered too, with the numb of adrenaline coursing through his veins.
“Cas,” he says. It’s all he knows, it’s all he can hope for.
“I’m telling you, it hides.”
It makes no difference to Cas. He plucks the marshmallow from Jack’s hand, pinching it with the tips of his fingers. His sincerity never falters as he says, “Thank you very much. This is an excellent gift.”
After getting Cas back, Jack also wanted to return. Cas was happy here, on earth, and Jack didn’t want to miss out on that. So, as all brilliant three-year old gods do, Jack separated his being into two distinct forms. His god-like, all-powerful being remained in Heaven, to observe and protect the earth realm, while his personality, who Jack was at the core, returned to earth in the form of a three-year old. It brought Cas to tears. Dean never knew how much he missed the kid.
Everyone gathers around the bonfire, watching the orange flames lick against the embers. The logs snap and crackle with the heat, sending out sparks every once and a while. The sparks float in the night, before evidently dying off, the ash falling to the ground. The sky is clear, dark. The stars are just starting to dot the midnight expanse. The grey plume of smoke produced by the fire trails up in the air, creating a comforting haze around them.
“It was worth it,” Dean says, slowly releasing the fabric of Cas’ sweater. “Like this sweater, by the way. Where’d you get it?”
“Cas.”
“Jack? He said he wasn’t interfering, he wants things to be different–”
“Cas,” Dean begins before trailing off. He opens his mouth, shuts it. He finally says, “I had to do it, to get you back.” Dean lifts the string out from around his neck. “It’s right here.” The ice-blue of Castiel’s grace swims in the small vial, its pronounced glow ebbing and flowing.
Cas hums, watching the fireflies blink to each other, dancing about through the air.
Then they turned onto the highway, the tires smooth against the cement. Like soft-serve ice-cream. Baby’s engine revved, adjusting to highway speed, like the stern voice of God's chastisement. The uneven splatter of bugs hitting the windshield reminded Castiel of the sound of plucked guitar strings. He misses the times when Dean would play for him. The wind blew against the car. It was like Sam’s hairdryer against Cas’ ear. It was like the vortex of The Empty chucking them back to Earth. Dean had to raise his volume to hear his own voice over the calamity. Castiel sat in the passenger seat, hands clasped in front of him. They’re two hours away from the bunker. A relatively short trip in Winchester experience. But there’s too many sounds, too many senses. Castiel can’t focus on Dean’s voice; he can’t wrap his head around
Dean should have never let him go, not alone.
When he’s around Cas, Dean is, well, he certainly doesn’t feel like himself. Cas will give him that stupid look with that stupid head tilt, and it’s almost like the responsibility of saving the world and defeating God doesn’t belong on his shoulders. It’s all the stupid expressions Cas pulls throughout the day, whether he’s studying an insect he’s found outside or from tasting foods with too many molecules or how his face lights up with the brightest smile after Dean tells a stupid joke to fill the silence. No, Dean is anything but himself around Cas. He feels so much better than that.
“We’re getting him back,” is the first thing Dean says in three months.
It’s so bright it’s blinding. Dean wakes up with spots in his vision, still.
Dean’s mouth falls agape before he quickly snaps it shut. His hand tightens around the wheel, he rubs his fingers against his thumb on his other hand, peeling away the grit. He readjusts in his seat. He chooses exasperation to hide his hurt. “Look, if you don’t want to stay-”
Dean stops pacing to yawn. It’s past two in the morning, and ever since Cas left, Dean hasn’t been able to bring himself to try and sleep in their room. He doesn’t want to wake up tomorrow and face the decisions of today. He doesn’t want to go to bed only to find his room empty. Without Cas, that bed is as good as a stranger’s.
He moves slightly on the bed and takes Cas in, arms tightly wrapped around him, and Cas immediately hides his face against his shoulder as he lets it all out, sobs wracking his body.
“I wrote to you, you know?” he says, trying hard not to break down. “The past ten years, almost every week. I’d write a letter that I’d never send.”
“Yeah, but you’re not the one who told me,” she argues. “Besides, I love Jess, but I don’t know if she even
“Does that mean we’re still friends?”
Where they used to be a gun under his pillow and the cold reminder of loneliness inside his bed, there’s now the shape of a former angel of the lord and warmth wrapped around them both as they slowly wake up curled around each other in the early hours of the day. There’s the Lord of the Rings trilogy on his nightstand- because he’s re-reading those with the same joy he had read them with when he was still a kid -instead of books about the end of the world, werewolves, or the reproduction patterns of ghouls. There are movie nights in the Deancave; date-nights where Dean exclusively uses things from Cas’ garden to cook their meals; nights when Jack comes over and plays board-games that they both desperately try to win (and fail to do so because at the end of the day, their kid is still one of the most powerful celestial beings in the universe — and that’s fine, that’s
Jimmy promised Cas after his second rehab that this day would always be the two of them. And now here he is after shift, making a mess of their kitchen with his usual band of friends, and Cas is standing there like a deer caught in the headlight.
“Dean, Earth is dying,” Cas scowls, moving away to grab another bag and visibly annoyed at him, “you should be as concerned as I am!”
“You know, ever since I left… ever since you and I broke up-“ he starts, but he has to stop as his voice breaks. He catches his breath and picks up. “I’ve tried my best to move on without you. And I never… I don’t think I ever really did. Somehow you were always there within me, even when I tried my goddamn best to forget you. In Virginia, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, on any fucking OP in any godforsaken country. I carried you along with me just like I carried my gun. You were always just
Castiel laughs on the other end of the line. “Wow, I think it’s the fastest you’ve ever picked up.”
“I just don’t want you to fall off the wagon again —,”
“I’m here, okay?” Dean says as he wraps Cas in a hug. “Anything you need, even if you just need to talk. I’m not --”
He wants Dean to re-learn him, too. Wants to feel the weight of his hands down his chest, taste the salt of his skin, the yearning on his tongue. Wants to feel his face buried in the crook of his neck, his breath skitting over his skin as he’d fill him up until all he could see, breath, smell, feel, hear, is Dean, only Dean, Dean,
, and Cas could almost sob because it suddenly clicks together that that’s what his soul has been missing all along.
“Dean, will you fucking listen to me,” Cas all but yells, his hand on Dean’s shoulder fisting his shirt and bringing him closer in front of him. “You’re not going to the fucking convenience store.”
“Hey Jim,” Dean says as he sits on one of the chairs at the kitchen island. “How was work?”
Rowena waits a few seconds to see if Cas has a follow up before she speaks.
Utter shit.
Cas will grasp at Dean’s shirt, a desperate attempt at trying to anchor himself to reality. Dean will brush a kiss on his forehead then, whispering into the darkness of their room.
Dean softens his grip on his shoulder, starts tracing soothing circles over the fabric of the old tee-shirt Cas is wearing.
Cas, who Dean’s almost sure- judging by the way his arms keep feeling like they’re missing something- probably ended up pressed up against him at some point while they were asleep.
“I’ve been thinking about what you and Charlie said yesterday and… well you’re right. It’s not like I’ve got something to lose. We’re already apart, so the only way this can go is up, not  down.”
Now though, it’s a whole other story.
Good lord, he loves him so much that sometimes there’s an ache in his chest when he realizes.
“Yeah.”
Prompt (by my friend
“Okay,” Cas ponders for a while. “So you’re still living at the motel?”
“Okay, come here,” Cas says and motions for Dean to come sit next to him.
Cas steps aside with a weak smile. “Come on in.”
“Then what?”
Cas' head is swimming into the memory of Dean’s hands, Dean’s skin, Dean’s lips moving against his. And for the first time in a long time, this morning doesn’t seem so dreadful anymore.
Some part of him really wants to point out that if this guy was Cas’ friend he’d have heard of him over the course of the past 7 months, but he keeps that little voice locked down and grits his teeth instead.
“You’re standing in my living room a decade after you bolted like a thief and you expect me to believe this is happening out of the goodness of your heart? What do you
“You gotta funny idea of romantic,” he says in a low voice, staring up at the faint white stars blinking down at them.
The other man's hair was in a mess. Eyes half closed as he rubbed at them, pale skin now contrasted with hickeys. He looked small without a shirt covering him. The skin around his collarbones seeming stretched.
The world tilted, or maybe Dean’s footing was off, as his breath hitched in his throat. He couldn’t breathe, no matter how many times he opened his mouth, attempting to fill his lungs, though nothing came. What was it with him and being unable to breathe “He’s gone?” Dean finally mustered, voice barely heard over the hammering of his heart.
“Thank you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"You should get some sleep."
At least they had that in common.
He looked back to Ellie for another second before he looked to his shoes, Sam’s phone still gripped tightly in hand. He could feel the vibration of text, though he didn’t check it, instead continuing to study his boots. Letting a soft breath pass his lips, and then another, his heart was hammering though he couldn’t be sure if it was from the adrenaline or withdrawal.
Dean watched until the other turned. His gaze quickly went to Jack, a hot blush creeping up his neck.
With a pair of scissors in hand Cas carefully looks over the pot of Marigolds, cutting off any leaves that had begun to wither and letting them fall off the porch and onto the street below. A concentrated expression rests across Cas’s features as inspects the plants, his lips pressed in a tight line and eyes narrowed, his fingers working carefully. How Cas had the patience to watch something grow, to care for something so frequently, Dean would never know.
“Cas-“ he didn’t know what he wanted to say, he wasn’t even sure if it was truly happening as he hesitantly walked towards the other, vision seeming to blur worse with each step. He was going to cry. He didn’t care. “Cas-“
With Jack still sobbing Dean walked past Sam, and then into his brother's bedroom. He closed the door behind them, continuing to bounce the child until he took a seat on the unmade bed.
Her feet moved forward, as she forced herself to take a breath. The conversation repeated in her head as she walked down the staircase, once then twice, making her more sick each time. The pain in Dean’s voice, the pain across his face, his kind words, the adoration.
"You've already told me."
“Do you think this could be a possibility for you.”
“No you didn’t.”
A tried smirk tugged at Dean’s lips as he watched Logan’s features drop for a second, before going back to his usual harsh look. “What?”
Lee only gave the smallest shake of his head, bringing his own bottle of beer to his lips, before placing it on the coffee table, and standing. “That bitch stole my watch.” Dean continued.
“Is everything alright?”
“Sure.”
How many people had his father said there would be, two hundred, three hundred. Even fifty seemed like to many.
"I swear man, that's all that's left. I've sold out!."
Dean smiled down at the kid, then glanced up to Cas who’d stood up. “Sure kid,” Dean hummened, his smile only widening as Jack cheered, bouncing up and down in excitement. He slowly stood, his gazing fall back to Castiel and that adoring look across his face that always came when he watched Jack.
“Probably Some Kind of Monster,” Dean paused for a moment, lips parted. He doubted Cas would know the meaning of the song though there was something about it that left him feeling bare, exposed, weak. “Or master of puppets.”
So he could feel stupid?
“Youtube!”
He already knew that.
Anyways I hope you enjoyed and are having a lovely day!
That thought passed Dean’s mind for less than a second before a soft meow got his attention and his gaze dropped from the kitchen and to the floor, where Atticus walked past his feet and towards Cas.
Before Crowley could argue, Dean slammed the passenger door closed, and turned away, beginning the walk up his own driveway. At the end, outside his garage was the impala, and next to her a dark blue Aston Martin's Vanquish, an expressive sports car, not worth the money, with an ugly outer, and an even uglier interior.
“She want’s Jess.”
"Oh, It's alright," the woman said in a shrill voice. Dean glanced up as the woman's own gaze darted back to the teacher, to laugh at something.
“I think I would prefer if you didn’t step on my toes,” Cas whispered back.
After dropping his things onto the kitchen chair Dean goes to get a glass of water, though his attention quickly changes as he stops at the kitchen counter where papers were spread out. A mix of bills and lined papers that were covered in Cas’s neat writing.
One of his hands cup Dean’s chin to stop him, the tip of his cock resting on the tip of his tongue.
Castiel fits his lips against Dean’s once more and they share a truly filthy kiss, just because they can do that now in the middle of their kitchen, in the house they’ve bought for themselves all those years ago. When they part, Dean still has that dazed look on his face as he watches his husband rise from his lap and feels him press against his back Hal a second later, lips back on his neck.
Dean doesn’t answer and the silence settles between them again for a little while.
“I love you too”.
“Listen, I’m exhausted.” Cas snaps as he finally turns to look at Balthazar next to him. “Yes, there’s something you don’t know about me and Dean. Lots actually. But I don’t wanna share it all right now, so please respect this. You can do that, right?”
When Dean steps back just by a hair, there’s a part of Cas that immediately senses the shift in his demeanor, from the way his shoulders almost guiltily set to the glint in his eyes when they find his.
• anxiety/panic attack
Tears are streaming down Cas’ face and he looks so fragile that Jimmy can’t help but push his feelings aside and grab his brother, wrapping him up into a hug. Cas goes easily, fitting his face into the crook of his brother’s neck, and Jimmy cards a hand through Cas’ mess of hair.
“Are you okay?”
Thank every single one of you for allowing me to share this journey with you. I'm glad I get to end this wild ride with you guys.
“I know,” Cas laughs. “Don’t pretend like you don’t like it.”
“It’s okay,” Cas says, his arms around Dean’s neck. “It’s good that you’re working full-time again, that means you’re doing good.”
“Don’t go.”
OKAY, SIDE NOTE  — HOW FUCKING GREAT IS BENNY?
He sits on the edge of the bed and extends a hand to brush Cas’ shoulder softly. The other man doesn’t make a sound, doesn’t acknowledge his presence.
It’s too good, too massive. Dean is tight and warm and delicious around him, and Cas could try and last some more if he really wanted to. But when Dean explodes into his hand, his come covering Cas’ fingers white and his moans buried into Cas neck, Cas follows mere seconds after, Dean’s ass clenching around him causing his delicious downfall.
Instead he just allows himself to watch as his body slowly wakes up. Dean looks younger in his sleep, his face more relaxed, his hair ruffled like it always his after a night of sleep. The sun is just starting to rise, but its beams passing through the blinds are highlighting Dean’s dirty blond hair. Cas’ memories flashback to a few years back and a younger Dean lying the same way against him.
“You’re gonna have to let him go, buddy. And it’s going to be tough, I’m not gonna lie to you,” Dean slowly says, crafting each and every word carefully in an attempt to soothe him. “It’s gonna hurt like a son of a bitch, and you’re gonna want to punch people in the face. You’re gonna want to tear your own heart out sometimes.”
God, he could almost laugh at the idea of not wanting to have sex with Cas considering how many years he’s dreamt of being in this position. He rearranges himself besides him, making a point of swiping both of his hands under Cas’ shirt in return, running his palms over the skin of his back. Cas sighs lightly at the touch but his eyes are still on high alert.
“Why would I be mad? If it helped you see through me, I’m glad,” Dean smiles, placing one last kiss on his lips before sitting on the bed behind him. “Plus I wrote them for you after all. It was only a matter of time before you read them. You do have a problem with opening other people’s mail though.”
They’re silent for a moment, Dean slowly sipping his whisky, his nerves quieting down gradually.
“I don’t know how to do this.”
• anxiety
“Dean, this is Teddy Watkins,” Cas continues, catching Dean’s eyes over Teddy’s shoulder. “Jimmy and Ted did their residency together.”
Real.
Dean looks at him, pain in his eyes, and Jimmy’s voice catches in his throat.
“Oh for God’s sake,” Cas groans, rolling his eyes.
“Would you mind uh-” Cas softens his tone, nibbling at Dean’s bottom lip. “Having extremely vigorous sexual intercourse with me, in the prospect of reaching climax together?”
Cas weighs his options for half a second before he decides that, fuck it, they’re not keeping things away from each other anymore, and Dean seems so at ease telling him about the letters.
“Okay, buddy,” Dean laughs against him, burrowing closer into the warmth of his neck, nosing at his cheek.
I’m tempted to pretend that I’ve been trying to get you out of me all this time. But the truth is that’s not what I’ve been doing at all. I’m terrified of letting you go. I’m no longer sure who I am without the pain to define me. You’re not the only thing inside me that hurts, but I guess it’s true to say you still find your way under my skin like you did when I left.
Dean’s pretty sure today is going to drive him crazy. It started with a spilled coffee on his desk, evolved into having forgotten lunch and running to Charlie’s in the midst of lunch rush, and now he’s stuck trying to figure out what the
“Uh-oh.”
Which means she now knows
“Dean—,” Charlie starts, growing more and more uncomfortable as minutes pass. “Listen I can explain.”
“I’m saying I don’t think staying angry at someone who’s not there anymore is fair. I don’t want to hold a grudge anymore because I love him, and I miss him. And I know you do, too.”
And then his phone rings, disrupting the religious silence that’s been bathing the room for long minutes.
“Sure.”
“I just sent everyone home. You were starting to get cranky,” he says before cupping Cas’ face between both of his hands, chuckling at his scandalized face. “What? You know I’m right.”
Taking the bus might actually injure his ego, but anything to stay clear from Charlie’s tin can of a car is on the table right now.
Charlie looks at him, still unimpressed. Steals another frie. “Not really. I still think you’re full of shit.”
Fuck. What
Dean brushes his thumb against the ridge of Cas’ collarbone carefully, trying to soothe him with a gentle touch.
Cas had seen the effects on Dean pretty early on- he’d take him with him to work every day, on a jog almost every morning, and Holli (that’s how Cas called their dog, making a point of refusing to use Dean’s stupid name at all cost- it made Dean stupidly proud for some reason) would be sleeping on his lap whenever Cas got out of his office, or home from a meeting. His PTSD crisis had started to decrease dramatically, and the last one he had to this day was three weeks earlier when he woke in fury at 3AM and ran to his safe to check if his gun was still there. It took Cas coaxing him back to bed and Holli being allowed to sleep on their bed firmly pressed against Dean’s legs for Dean to finally get back to sleep, Cas tightly wrapped around him.
Learning that you’ve been toyed with, especially for more than ten years is probably never an enjoyable thing to go through.
Dean tries to ignore the slight shiver that runs through him at the clear sound of astonishment in Cas’ voice.
Life goes on, but Castiel starts hating it.
They stay like that for a while, silent and cared for, the only sound disturbing the quiet comfort being Holli and Leia chasing each other upstairs. Dean thinks back to 11 years before and writing that last letter to Cas. He thinks of how broken-hearted he was, of how giving up on Cas made him want to throw up. He remembers grabbing the closest piece of paper, abandoning his neat writing for a scribble in capital letters. He remembers everything he wrote down, how his stomach twisted as he promised Cas to finally let him go.
“What?” Dean fires back, his mouth too busy going down the line of Cas’ jaw.
• anxiety/panic attack
He picks himself up from the mess he’s just created, tries to ignore the need to bolt and forget all about his entire life, and heads for the hospital home where Dean is waiting for him.
“Yeah. Yeah you can,” Cas pants a little breathless as he turns around into Dean’s embrace. “Can’t assure you that I’ll be able to return the favor though, I’m literally exhausted.”
Before
“No buts, Cas. If you don’t I’m going to push you in there myself,” Balthazar interrupts, and Castiel finally tears his eyes away from the ceiling to look at his friend. “And then you’re going to answer the hundreds of messages that your phone keeps receiving, and you’re gonna start acting like a decent human being again.”
“The next deployment will be my last. I’m retiring after that.”
“Uh-uh,” Cas nods, a moan escaping him as Dean starts trailing a hand down the nape of his neck and the expense of his back.
Cas closes his eyes, a smile on his face as he follows suit and explodes into his own hand, letting a loud moan fall off his lips to let Dean know just
A beat. Dean opens his eyes again, eyes shining with unshed tears.
“I don’t know. He looks really good. I hope he’s doing okay.”
Maybe today’s not so bad after all.
She seems nice and like she really wants them to be reassured, but all Jimmy hears is
“Sweetheart, you okay?”
“Feeling like I’m getting too old for this shit,” Dean says slowly, enjoying the warmth of Cas’ fingers over his skin, the softness of a thumb following the curve of his lower lip.
He reaches out for Cas’ hands and tightly intertwines their fingers together, squeezing lightly to offer comfort. It’s something he’s been doing more recently, knowing that Cas needs the reassurance.
The answer to his text comes in less than a minute, and Dean’s heart makes a back-flip inside his chest.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean I have any insight on what’s going on inside that pretty little head of his.”
As far as Jimmy could tell, being gay had never been a problem for Cas. He didn’t really struggle with his sexuality, but never felt the need to voice it until a certain point either. Jimmy always knew that Cas was into guys, and didn’t see why his brother would even feel the need to say it. Hell, the way he had been looking at their mutual best friend was enough of an admission as it was anyway. But he did tell Jimmy once around their 14th birthday, his voice wavering like he was afraid his brother might disown him.
“Best sniper in the game,” Dean laughs before taking another round through a new target.
It’s not always easy.
, thank you both for your incredible work 💜
“Dean? Are you alright?” Cas says on the other end of the line, obviously concerned.
“He did.”
“What?” Dean asks, forgetting all about his internal turmoil for the time being. “What’s wrong?”
It's the day after in the aftermath of Cas' crisis, and with Dean's help things are starting to feel a bit better... until more secrets unfold.
“Well, I wasn’t the medic on my team but I had some basic training before BUD/S.”
Cas has been reading in bed for at least an hour when Dean finally enters their bedroom, Holli following him in tow. He barely peaks above the page of his book, his glasses sitting heavy on his nose, but can’t help the smile that rises as soon as Dean sits down and starts arguing with their dog.
No one, absolutely
Good night, Cas.
A kiss right there, soft lips against the line of Dean’s shoulder, and Dean sighs slightly at the touch so of course Cas keeps going.
“Yeah,” Dean says, breaking eye contact with Charlie to stare into nothing. “I really do.”
“Don’t,” he warns, voice breaking, still out of breath. Still not sure that any of this just happened, and still mildly out of it. “Please,
He listens for a while as Cas’ breathing slows down and once it’s clear that the somewhat angel has finally fallen asleep, he wraps his arms tighter around him, brushes a kiss against Cas’ forehead and sinks into sleep in his turn.
Cas smiles. “Yeah, we met in class. He’s, huh,” he scratches his neck as they finally pass the exit door and starts walking toward the parking lot. “He’s in the grade above mine. His name is Arthur.”
“You’re not coming?” he asks, almost in disbelief.
He turns on his heels, making a big thing out of it, and starts walking toward his room.
Not that he’d admit that out loud in front of his best friend,
“Come on Cas, you’re going to miss your flight if you don’t go
“Can’t,” he smiles. “You coming over for lunch?”
“I’ve spent the last 10 years being homesick. Missing Lawrence, yeah. But what I really mean when I say “
And so he leaves. He makes his way out of bed and into the cold of the corridor, back to his own room. He closes the door and collapses against it, because the pieces of his heart finally clicked back together and he
“I just don’t get why you don’t ask Bobby to take you back in,” Charlie says as she sinks into the chair across from Dean, handing him a cup of freshly brewed coffee. “You loved working there.”
long, but of course that’s probably because Cas isn’t hopelessly in love with his best friend.
“I think so. We talked last night. He hasn’t made a decision yet.”
“Nothing,” Dean says lowly against his throat where his lips are pressed. “Just missed you is all.”
Dean through his fork down, looking up to his father. “Yes it fucking is!” Dean snapped “If you you want my grade so fuckin’ bad maybe you should go to the school and get them yourself.”
Dean looked towards his brother watching as he clenched his jaw, squeezing his eyes tightly. He wanted to make him better, god that was all Dean ever wanted. For his brother to be happy, but this was out of his control and Dean hated it. Watching Sam suffer, with no way to help.
Slowly Dean pulled his phone from his pocket. Every inch of his body begging him not to as he opened his contacts, though he had no other choice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“If he finds out that i’m-” gay, bi, head over heals falling out of plane in love with another boy. Dean didn’t want to know what would happen. “I’m- im sorry- i’m so sorry I pulled you into this.”
Meant to do what, stop his anxiety, that drugs had caused.
“Uh yah- I teach metals and mechanics,” Dean replied. He raised a hand to his hair running it through the messy strands before he let it fall back to his side, and instead licked his bottom lip. “I’ve also been pickin’ up some shifts at an auto shop.”
He was dying.
Then another.
Is this how Sam had felt around Jess. High without the racing of his heart. Addicted without the withdrawal. Like everything fit into place, the long gazes, the close contact, the feeling like everything was going too fast or too slow. Was that how Sam felt whenever he was around her, when he’d fallen head over heels for her.
“Dean, why would I lie to you?”
“I’ll show you sometime.”
The footsteps began again, becoming more distant, though it wasn’t until Cas could no longer hear John’s voice that he let out a shaken breath. Even then another few seconds passed before Dean pushed open the door and they stepped out.
Cas’s gaze met Dean’s, holding there for barely a second before he turned away. “Je-” Dean caught the word, just as Cas turned. “Cas, I just- You’re going to do great.”
“Sam?”
Dean continued to stare at Castiel until the other looked up, his gaze staring back intensely. “Dean?” Cas began in a low tone. “Are you alright?”
All around it turned Dean’s stomach, the whole situation burning worse then Cas’s glares ever could. He’d never hurt Jack, he couldn’t imagine laying a hand on the child, so why couldn’t Cas trust him.
He had eaten since he arrived, tons, though no matter how much he ate it never seemed to be enough.
Dean shifted slightly tilting his head so it still rested against Ca’s shoulder though he could now watch the empty street, only one of Cas’s arms now around his shoulder. It was peaceful, the night sky, the snow covered streets, the others warmth. Dean could almost imagine it was  any other day, when they just wanted to enjoy each other’s company.
Even if at moments Dean could almost pretend that they were together, that the smiles and laughs had never ended. That when they were close Dean could lean in and press a kiss to Cas’s neck, or to his cheek, or to his lips. That at the end of the day Dean would fall into bed next to the other.
Cas squeezed his eyes shut, a slow breath filling his lungs. From his right he could feel the other side of the bed shift, followed by the sound of Dean’s feet as he walked across the room, the way he always did when they were done. Then the opening of the door, the way it always did. Then the sound of the shower, the noise that always came.
The moment Cas saw Dean he turned, walking as quickly as he could to the stairway, “no wait Cas.” Dean ran forward, running through the hall, and into the stairwell, “Cas,” He yelled again  trying to get the other man to stop, though when he didn't, Dean reached out grabbing his wrist.
The smallest smirk tugged at Dean's lips as Sonny looked back to him, the disbelief across his face not incredibly clear but definitely there.
“Daddy doesn’t have lights,” Jack explained as his gaze dropped to instead focus on the string of Dean’s winter coat, his small fingers tugging at it, and tying it into small knots.
“You are going to be introduced, then you will share a dance, and finally talk with guests,” Chuck paused. “You will be excited for the engagement and polite to anyone who asks about it, understood?”
“Did I tell you ‘bout the bar yesterday?” Cas gave a small shake of his head, getting a wide grin from his friend. “There was this chick there, hot as hell, like dude, you might have even gone for her.”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, lips parted as he took an uneven gasp for air.
Dean looked to the nurse, who looked back with a raised eyebrow, “No.”
Dean could see the other’s expression drop in distress, for just a moment, before he was back to an emotionless expression. “It’s Jack,” Cas began, his eyes never leaving Dean’s, voice monotone, echoing through the silent hallway. Dean could see as the other took a deep breath, chest raising, “I- He’s missing, and so is Logan.”
He must've been sitting for hours, the sky now a light shade of blue. Had he watched the sun rise from the deck, he could've sworn he had, but maybe he had been staggering around the park. Slowly he pushed himself from the railing, shuffling to the deck and door, and stepping inside the apartment.
“What if we don’t.”
"He had insisted it would make it look nicer, I'm afraid he was wrong." Dean hesitated with what to say next, not wanting to pressure his friend but not able to hold it back any longer, Sam wouldn't tell him everything and Dean needed to know.
Dean didn't move, his hands folded in his lap, legs dangling off the deck. He couldn't exactly remember how he got back home, only that after the cocaine had worn, he had placed both acid tablets onto his tongue. Everything after that had become almost a dream. Wondering the streets for what seemed like days, starting at various lights as if it was for the first time, and even now the hazy feeling stuck. He still felt muffled, the cold air burning against his skin in the best way possible. Everything feeling so much brighter, so much more alive.
Slowly Dean pulled his hand out, letting it fall back to his side. Still he could feel the drug burning in his pocket, tongue exploding with the familiar minty taste. The spike that would be felt through his spine, the immediate euphoria that would wash over.
Sam looked to Dean, even through the dim lighting, the disbelief clear across his face. “Dude,” Sam began, raising an eyebrow. “More time then that.”
"I love you June bug," Dean choked out when he could finally speak. He couldn't open his eyes, he couldn't look at his daughter anymore knowing she was dead.
“I’ll take him! Dean offered which Sam raised an eyebrow to, seeming unsure. “Sam you're off three days a week, one which is spent in counselling, I've been here for two qeeks and the kids still don't like me. They don’t want me here! They want you, so you go have fun with them and i’ll take Cas to the hospital.”
Claire bit her lip harder, stopping herself from laughing. She could picture it easily, Dean in the matching tracksuits that all the coaches wore, overall excited and more passionate than any of the players. He’d be Annoying as hell and Jack would’ve loved it.
“Three,” Dean began counting down slowly, “two.”
Cas’s eyes stayed rested on Dean, his features seeming to soften for a second, “if that is okay with you?”
“Dean why not?” He clenched his jaw, vision beginning to blur with tears. How could he tell the other that it felt good, that knowing he was that sick ment he was doing something right. How could he tell Cas he enjoyed it, needed it, loved it. Dean attempted to take a breath though it came out as a gasped sob. “You can talk to me.”
He pushed open the drivers door, making sure to give Sam one last glare before he got out. “Fuckin’ idiot.” Dean continued to complain as he walked to the building's front door, typing in the code before he pushed open the front door, and stepped into the main entrance.
I hope you guys have a great day, or have at least one happy moment.
“They’re awesome,” Dean said. He raised the phone, so Bobby could give it a quick glance, before turning back to the road.
“Worse,” Dean mumbled.
Sam got home a little past four that night, and the moment the kids were done saying there hellos, Dean was there, pestering him with questions. “Why, didn’t you tell me?” Sam raised an eyebrow, his jacket not even off. He had only just placed his briefcase onto the table.
Dean didn’t talk as his brother continued to shower Cas in various questions, can you feel your arm, can you move your fingers, instead only being able to stare. He looked so sick. His face thin, not bruising yet but surely it would soon.
He was kind to the world, he loved with every inch of his being, and cared with everything he had to offer. Cas was good, and warm, and comforting, and radiating.
The rest of the drive was done in silence. The music turned up to fill the awkward silence, only being turned down when they pulled up to the school.
“Yes,” Cas repeated, “My answer to your proposal is yes. I will marry you.”
As more tears silently rolled down Cas’s cheeks, Dean took a step forward, wanting to comfort the other in some way. He took another step forward, though this time Cas stepped back, instead turning to the deck railing, slowly taking a seat on the ground, letting his legs dangle through the railing bars.
“Im not seeing another fuckin’ therpaist,” Dean snapped. “Isn’t this fuckin’ America, can’t we just pay a shit ton of money to get what we want.”
“Thanks,” he mumbled. Dean grabbed his duffle bag from the floor, even filled only with clothing the bag was heavy in Dean’s hand. He barely had the energy to carry his own weight from the sleepless nights, never mind any extra.
He let his gaze linger for another second before he looked to Lee. “where’s Sam?” Dean finally whispered, the rest of the hospital room was empty, other than another unoccupied bed a few feet away, and the few machines that surrounded him.
Even by what must have been the hundredth guest Dean’s charming personality hadn’t faltered. Instead he happily chatted with the older women who’d stopped them, Cas’s left arms still wrapped around Dean's bicep, while his right hand held a glass of wine.
(See the end of the chapter for
So much fat.
“I said, get out.” When Dean doesn’t make a move Claire squeezed her eyes shut. “Now.” She demanded.
Dean groaned, burying his face further into the pillow. His whole body ached in exhaustion, every inch burning as if he had been lit on fire, licking across his finger tips, burning hotter with every racing heart beat. Despite the heat of his skin, he was freezing, even under the weight of blankets. He couldn’t breath, not without one more hit. Not that he even wanted to if he wasn’t high.
“Fuck,” Dean paused. “Off.”
“I need to go.”
Dean laughed, this time not making another argument as he let his friend drag him, back up the staircase, and through the raves crowd. Dean’s legs seeming to feel heavier and heavier with each step they took, arms growing itchier. Was that normal, Dean wasn’t sure.
“Yah!”
For a moment Dean’s lips parted and he thought the words would fall, help me, save me, I can’t do this anymore, though nothing came. Even if they’d known each other for a little over a week, he cared too much about her, he couldn’t bring himself to pile his problems onto especially since she had her own alcoholism she was battling.
“You’ve slept with his sister, you’ve gone through debt, and therapists, and you’ve pushed him away, and torn yourself apart.” Was this supposed to be a pep talk, Dean wasn’t sure. It definitely didn’t feel like it. “Dean, he’s seen you at rock bottom, and he’s still with you, because he loves you and nothing is going to change that, He’s going to love how ever you propose, not because of how big the proposal is, or how pricey the ring is, but because it’s from you. Could you get that through your thick skull”
Cas doesn’t mean for the obviousness of it all to bleed so condescendingly into his voice when he says, “Then I’m staying.”
They’re gone. Everyone’s gone. It’s just him and Sam, now.
. Only to be found in the recesses of Dean’s worst nightmare.
He drops to his knees; he can’t feel his legs. The goo swims up around his thighs, circling his hips. Dean can feel it creep up his back, following the curve of his spine.
Dean laughs, the sound rumbling through his chest, “I know, I know, you rebuilt me just fine. It’s a figure of speech.” Dean has them moving again, not bothering to match the music’s rhythm.
“And no, I don’t know what’s growing here," Cas says, answering Dean's original question. "Barley?”
The lines at corners of Dean’s eyes deepen; he gives Cas a winning smile. “I’m hilarious.”
It’s not the first time Dean has thought it, nor is it the first time he’s felt it with every sinew in his body, but it steals his breath every time. Apparently, that feeling isn’t exclusive to Earth either.
“We could bring our rain boots,” Cas suggests.
“Momma?” Jack says, muffled into Dean’s flannel.
He can feel Dean’s brow furrow against his shoulder as he groans. “Yeah, okay. But not too hot!”
Cas sets his sandwich down, reaching for his orange juice box. He removes the straw and stabs it through the top. “Do you want me to come?”
He’d never experienced motion sickness as an angel. But as a human, Cas experienced vertigo from the strangest things. The beat of electronica music, the shift of the floor when someone paces back and forth, looking up after reading small-print for hours. He thought humanity would ground him to the earth; it only loosened his connection.
Cas looks at him, eyes wide. “Our destination.” He walks to the side of the truck and steps up on the wheel to swing a leg over and climb into the box.
Everything Cas was working for, everything Cas has wanted is resting in Dean’s arms, sleeping peacefully. Cas is gone, and it’s Dean’s responsibility now. And it’s hard work, it’s exhausting, it fucking sucks, it’s everything Dean swore he would never subject himself to again, certainly not unwillingly. But when Jack looks up at him, or when they’re in the rocking chair, surrounded by nothing but the dark, at least Dean can, for a moment, feel a little less lonely. He can feel a little closer to Cas.
Dean’s breathing picks up in pace, and he waits for whatever death has in store for him this go around. He can’t even bring himself to scramble away, to try and avoid Castiel’s fatal touch. Dean has known for a long time that in the end, he’d do anything for Cas. Anything he wanted. All for him.
“Good,” Dean’s shoulders relax and he finally sticking the straw into his juice box. “Sam was saying that the bunker’s been busier than ever these past two months.”
“Always.”
It’s over, basically. The trap was a success. They’re going to die here. He’s going to lose him. He’ll never know.
He wants to be loved, he wants his best friend, he wants to apologize for being a piece of shit and he wants to make it right.
Cas catches Dean’s eye from across the fire, the scrunch of his face melting into a grin. He holds up his hands, flexing his fingers. Dean reaches down and grabs the wet wipe container, and walks the circumference of the family circle to bring one to Cas.
Cas rests his arm against the passenger window, watching the raindrops stream against the windows as Dean accelerates. He has his head propped up by his hand.
The cold sludge starts curling around Dean’s neck. It’s trailing down his arms, dripping out of his sleeves, chilling his hands, staining his skin.
Cas squints at Dean. “You’re not funny.”
Cas blinks at him. His lungs aren’t constricted into shock. They inhale, they exhale. He’s alive, he’s here, and he’s real.
“Dean, please!” Cas shouts. His own voice grates against his ears. He grimaces, flexing one of his hands. “A little quieter, please.”
“I was cat-sitting for Mrs. Elmer. She has old trails connecting to the back of her property. I explored one day.”
“Then what,” Dean repeats airily. He tilts his head up, shaking it. “Whatever we want, man. Whatever you want, since you’re not staying.”
Dean gets the picture and quickly follows suit.
“Big yawn,” Dean says, rubbing Jack’s tummy. He grabs the swaddling blanket, and arranges it to wrap around Jack. He tucks Jack’s arms in, tucking the blanket around his sides, and brings him into his chest. Jack coos, and his eyes droop closed, and he tilts his head towards Dean. It’s the first time Dean lets himself smile all night, albeit a very tight smile.
It’s nothing like Dean has ever felt before. It’s nothing like the alley, with Cas shoving him up against the brick and leaving no room for breath between them. The angel blade in Castiel’s hand is no match to human sinew and muscle, and it destroys every bit of Dean it touches. There’s no room for negotiation, no chance to come out of this alive. Castiel will do anything to get the angel tablet, Dean means nothing to him. Castiel’s hand raises above Dean, the angel blade aimed directly at his chest. Castiel is going to kill him.
“Says who? You and me, Sammy, we’ve both cheated death more times than we can count. Who says we can’t do the same for everyone else?”
Cas’ eyes dart from one firefly to the next lightning bug to the next Lampyridae. He says, “Jack would love them too, I think.”
The admission of it all still makes Dean’s heart race. Loving an angel? That was never in Chuck’s cards. But Dean is still reminding himself that Chuck is gone. God does not rule over them the way he used to. Jack doesn’t interfere (much); he comes over for breakfast every morning.
The plan was already in motion so there wasn't a chance of going back from this. However, he was able to nick Billie's arm without a lot of trouble. It actually worked, he tried to push her back that wouldn’t last for a long time. Because Billie is right there, and she's angry, there's no need to go into Death's library. Sam and Cas already had a visit; they weren't able to check the book. Dean knew that this was a dumb idea but it was the best one he had at the moment. The hunter didn't want to drop the scythe but even so, he can't keep a hold of it. Dean was frantic but subtle with his movements. He moved back quickly but wasn't sure of what to do next. Dean still looked for ways, they needed enough time for both Sam and Jack to do whatever they needed to do. He looked over to Cas, Dean took a deep breath before he turned back to Billie
Compared to what Dean had, Cas's hands were still somewhat big but his fingers were a lot skinnier than his. Dean closed the gap and kept his hand interlocked with the angels. He liked that their hands fit perfectly with one another...he's probably enjoying this more than he should, with this the hunter thought that Cas is reciprocating in a way, would it be safe to go a little further? Dean still has yet enough courage to gain from these small gestures so in return after their fingers clasped with one another they left it there for a good majority of the movie. Dean decided, he started to move his thumb across the angel's knuckles typically this would be an affectionate thing you wouldn't necessarily do with your friend or best friend. Dean was a little hesitant when making this decision but he hoped that Cas wouldn't mind.
Castiel was currently helping Jack calm down with his emotional distress. All of the feelings barging right back in would obviously cause him to have a mental breakdown, which Cas could empathize with. He left him alone after he stopped crying, sobbing, and begging to be forgiven for whatever that he has done wrong. Cas understood where this came from, but couldn't exactly talk too much in the matter because he also was to blame for not trying to communicate with Jack before the "accident" occurred. He closed the door and placed his palm on the door and stayed there for a few seconds looking at it. he contemplated if it's a good idea to leave Jack alone in his state. Cas chose to do so, maybe personal space will help him out.
