his face in his clone’s arse. His finger was still there, too, prodding the other Sherlock from the inside and undoubtedly finding his prostate. Clone Sherlock cried out and inadvertently gagged himself deep-throating John’s cock.
Another twitch, and Sherlock’s erection began to fill out noticeably. “I’m confident wanking is considered rude in polite company,” Sherlock said with a grimace. “Didn’t need Lestrade to tell me that.”
“Your delicious arse, you mean? Someday. Not yet, but soon. And we’ll try it the other way around, too. I want it like this for tonight, though - we’re both going to get lube and come all over these dainty knickers. You’re going to hold your thighs together, as tight as you can, and rut against my hand. And I’m going to fuck that tight crack, every single thrust sliding along the underside of your lace-covered bollocks and jolting your cock against my palm. I’m going to lick the sweat off your shoulderblades and moan right into your ear when I come. And you’re going to fall apart beneath me.”
Sherlock made him question a lot of things about himself. Having some goddamn boundaries, for one, but also where the line between
That… was more humility than John expected from the world’s greatest consulting detective, honestly. “So we’ve established you like when I’m angry, possessive, homicidal, and ignoring you. Anything else?”
“I have, actually,” John felt obligated to say. “It’s called a sixty-nine and it is, indeed, enjoyable.”
“You think it was trans panic?” he asked, mostly to have something to say. “Her date didn’t know she was transgender and freaked out in a homophobic rage?”
“I can learn to cuddle,” Sherlock murmured, his voice a deep rumble against John’s stomach. “You don’t need a girlfriend. I’m taller - longer arm span. Better hugs.”
didn’t want to ask why Sherlock kept a lacy black bra and knickers set hidden somewhere in his bedroom, but they fit him well. The bright blue flannels wadded in the cups of the brassiere looked ridiculous… and surprisingly sexy. The whole combo was sexy, which is not something John had ever thought he’d say about his flatmate. Well, never thought he’d admit. Sherlock exuded an effortless sexuality when it benefitted him.
John closed his eyes, shook his head a few times, and sighed. “Good luck, I suppose. I’m going back to bed.”
“Other half.” Sherlock placed a light hand on John’s shoulder and nudged him lower to get a closer look at the stab wound. Which did, indeed, have all indications of being from a smallish kitchen knife. “
“G’morning.” John shuffled past the lump of dressing gown and dark curls on the sofa and stared blearily at the coffeemaker on the cluttered kitchen counter. “Is this safe to drink, or do I need to make a new pot?”
Sherlock grumbled something, then rolled sideways far enough to grab the edge of the blanket and tug it free so he could wrap their bodies together like a burrito. “Better?”
It wouldn’t be the first time, but John didn’t say that. The “friend” he’d lost in uni after coming out as ace was barely worth the title, anyway. The realization--and the freedom that came with understanding there was nothing wrong with him for not getting erections constantly through his teen years every time someone with tits entered his field of vision--had done more to boost his mental health than Bill’s friendship ever had.
Sherlock switched to his other leg, and John fell into a contented half-doze. He was virtually pain-free.
Sherlock reached up and brushed his fingertips over the line of John’s jaw. “I want you to show me what I’ve been missing,” he said in a low tone. “Because I didn’t believe I
Ultimately it didn’t matter, because halfway to the sofa Sherlock emerged from the loo and the entire plate went tumbling from John’s grasp onto the floor.
“Okay.” John poured a cup to wake himself up enough to brew better coffee. He was halfway through it before he noticed something. “Sherlock?”
John rolled to his stomach and let his forehead sink into the special padded facerest. The quiet strains of a lone violin filled the room. John focused on breathing deeply, in and out. This massage therapist was brusque, but the oil he’d just put on his hands smelled like cinnamon and autumn. It was pleasant.
. Each pass made John feel two centimetres taller. It also brought a twitch of interest to an area he was happy his massage therapist couldn’t currently see.
“The lacy knickers especially. I didn’t know I had a kink for you in lacy knickers, but apparently I do.” John traced the lower border of the knickers with his fingertips, skimming upward and outward along the edge and then back. The sundress hid everything from his view, but the feel alone was already the single most erotic experience of John’s thirty-eight years of existence. Sherlock’s skin was warm, smooth, perfectly formed. It was also exquisitely sensitive, judging from how the man’s breathing sped up every time John traced the line of the knickers downward and inward until there wasn’t space to go any further. Sherlock whimpered and tried to spread his legs, but John kneeling over him didn’t allow for much movement.
John had never undressed a corpse before. It was surprisingly difficult--and not just because Sherlock was watching him steadily the entire time.
Sherlock shrugged off the remains of the sundress and was trying to undo the bra clasp behind his back while John worked. That stopped being effective the moment John slid a blunt finger along Sherlock’s perineum.
“I need to determine how much your reactions differ from my own,” the first concluded. “Plus, you’d enjoy it. You’ve never performed and received fellatio at the same time.”
They left the biscuits on the floor to be hoovered later and settled into their respective armchairs with tea. Sherlock seemed entirely at home sitting in a short dress with his hairy legs demurely crossed. He had perfect posture, which was a surprise since his skeletal makeup was usually an afterthought when it came to his relationship with furniture. John eyed him warily and finished his tea in silence.
was hard. Sherlock’s hands didn’t stray above mid-thigh, but that didn’t seem to matter to John’s cock. John let out a long, deliberate breath and willed his erection to calm the fuck down.
“She was an idiot. I would say you should fire her, but luckily you already did. It’s astounding how many so-called medical professionals don’t have the vaguest understanding of human anatomy beyond what was covered in whatever excuse passed for their training.”
“Ah. I see.” Sherlock cleared his throat. “Please know that I respect many of your other positive qualities besides your arse, things that are much more important, but you
kind of massage parlor, and it’s not something I normally offer, but in your case I find myself willing to make an exception.”
The end came embarrassingly quickly. John tightened his grip and managed a “Oh shit, gonna--” before the world went white and he was coming his brains out. Sherlock hummed again, a thoughtful noise this time, then withdrew with lips still shiny from his exertions. John wanted so badly to taste himself on that expressive mouth, but he made do with groping for Sherlock’s hand and squeezing it. It seemed a more reliable method of conveying thanks than relying on words would be.
Sherlock looked at him blankly. “The brassiere, John. The skin irritation. No woman wears itchy undergarments unless she intends to have someone else see them. Not only was the lace abrasive, but the band size was slightly too small for her chest so it cut more deeply. I suspect she has similar lace divots across her iliac crests, but the blood made it difficult to tell for sure. Matching bra and knickers, then. Not a first date, but still early enough she bothered to wear something she thought her date would find arousing.”
“Excellent. Make sure you go online to schedule another appointment for next week. I believe this treatment will only get more effective with additional applications.”
“I mean it - if you don’t want to do this again, I’ll go back to the vividly sexy dreams and wanking first thing in the morning like I’ve been doing all year. I can’t help it if most of those dreams feature you, though.”
“Oi, Anderson. Shut up.” Lestrade massaged his temples and turned back to Sherlock. “Tell me what you’ve got.
“Sorry.” John quickly and efficiently ran the scissors up the rest of the bodice, revealing a pale stomach and lean abdominal muscles and then a brand-new view of the lacy bra. Even the flannels jammed in the cups didn’t detract from the overall effect. Sherlock wasn’t particularly hirsute, so the black lace stood out starkly against pale skin. John swallowed hard.
The flushed detective resumed fondling his cock. There was already a telltale sheen of moisture at the tip, John noticed.
Right like that!” Sherlock gave a full-body shiver but kept his thigh muscles clamped firmly around John’s erection. Each flex of his hips shifted the lacy black fabric of his knickers. John let himself flop forward and lie along Sherlock’s back, unable to stand the sight of those taut arse muscles any longer without embarrassing himself early.
“Sherlock.”  Lestrade cleared his throat again. “I know you don’t think much of my team, but most of them
John couldn’t help it--he started giggling. And once he started, he couldn’t stop. “I would too, you crazy berk,” he choked out between bursts of laughter. “Go write yourself a hypothesis.”
“Push it in,” the clone Sherlock begged. “We didn’t try this angle before and I want to know if it feels as good as the other way.”
When he next came downstairs, one Sherlock was examining slides under the microscope and calling out numbers to the other Sherlock, who was writing them down in a lab notebook. They both looked up with identical expressions when John entered the sitting room.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pointed. “Nails--look at them. French manicure, subtle, professionally done and not cheap. Also not temporary. Musculature in her calves shows she wore high heels regularly. Pierced ears, if you’d bothered to look. One hole each, very traditional. Discoloration line along her ribcage shows she was recently wearing a bra trimmed with lace. It irritated her skin, here and here. I expect you’ll find the same along the line of her hip.”
John definitely could use a good cuppa, so he put the kettle on and set about seeing what biscuits Sherlock hadn’t somehow contaminated. No surprise there--the TimTams were in pristine condition, because they were Sherlock’s favorites. The Jammie Dodgers looked like they had been gone over with a meat tenderizer. John dumped the remains onto the tea tray anyway, because fuck it, at least the filling held the crumbs together.
“You’re taller than she was,” he commented as he hauled Sherlock to a sitting position. “Think that makes a difference here? Or my height compared to her date’s?”
“Office worker would be my guess,” Sherlock interrupted, “going by the state of her hands. Look, here and here--the calluses are from typing. Her nose has faint indentations from glasses, too. Probably only wore them when the monitor was giving her headaches. Nevertheless, the wound positioning does point to this being sex-related, at least tangentially. Send me close-ups of the back of her head and details of any particulates once you’ve had someone other than Anderson collect them. Come on, John--I need to run an experiment.” He stood. “Oh, and Garrett? ‘Transgender’ is an adjective, not a noun. You might offend someone.”
“Sorry,” Sherlock murmured. “You’re very good at that, John. I’m going to perform analingus on myself now.”
Even if the sight didn’t make his own prick engorge itself in sympathy, the fact that Sherlock was aroused
“Excellent,” Sherlock declared upon his return. “I run my appointments by task, not time, so be prepared to stay until I tell you you’re done and not before. Flip over, please. I assume you have no objection to music?”
“Ah.” John licked his lips and willed himself to not explode at his--currently disturbingly feminine--flatmate. “I’ll just bring in the tea, then, shall I?”
John slowly lowered Sherlock’s unresisting form to the ground again, then straddled his thighs and lifted the hem of his skirt. “You sure?”
“Obviously,” the Sherlock at the microscope said. He was still in a dressing gown, but the other Sherlock was now in a different suit. “Now that I have a suitable control group that’s identical to me in every way, there are a number of experiments I can finally complete.”
The Sherlock with the notebook frowned. “Lestrade? No. Molly Hooper? Definite no. Mrs. Hudson?” He shuddered. “No, I think it’s just for you.”
“Up you get,” John decided, and slipped his arms under Sherlock’s knees and back to pick him up in a bridal carry. “Bed or sofa?”
“Off the record,” he murmured, “you have two choices now. One is deep tissue massage through your pectoral to reach the subscapularis and hopefully get it to stop pulling unevenly against the clavicle. It’s not particularly pleasant and will likely take several sessions, leaving you feeling off-balance and asymmetrically sore each time.”
“Your vocabulary diminishes the closer you get to having sex,” Sherlock noted in a muffled voice. “You need to learn a wider variety of profanities.”
“You’re all angles and contrasts,” John said in a lower voice. “Long limbs, graceful, even when pulling yourself off. I can tell how tense your muscles are getting, the closer you are to orgasm. When you throw your head back and close your eyes like that… how could I look away?”
Sherlock met his eyes. “The other is rather… unconventional, but much more enjoyable. Your primary source of tension is stress, so if you prefer we can end the official session right here and I can help you with that erection you’ve been sporting ever since I first touched you.” He flashed a cheeky grin. “Rest assured this is not
The Sherlocks broke apart reluctantly. One of them immediately started writing something in the notebook. “Controlled test,” the other Sherlock answered. “I’d say that was about a six for me.”
John thought. “I don’t think there was a specific moment, exactly. I got crushes, the same as the rest of my peers. Then, as we got older, they spent all their time trying to get into girls’ knickers while I was still perfectly happy to snog and maybe hold hands. Carry their books, write terrible poetry, I’m sure you know the drill. Although I can’t picture you with spots, blushing and stammering over your own name because a cute girl noticed you.”
“And…” Sherlock’s gaze seemed to have settled somewhere in the vicinity of John’s sternum, but then he looked up and John was hooked in that verdigris stare once more. “I don’t know how to do this,” Sherlock confessed. “I’ve never had a friend before, much less a best friend. I want to be honest with you but I’m not sure I can put the truth into words. I… care deeply for you. I cannot contemplate functioning without you by my side. You have become my cocaine, John. And I don’t know what to do.”
“Relaxing” wasn’t happening anytime soon, John was sure of that. Sherlock hummed contentedly around his mouthful of cock, drawing a loud gasp. John reached down to spear his hand through the man’s perfectly coiffed curls, an anchor to keep him from floating away into the aether of sensation.
“It’s safe,” Sherlock called from his bedroom, “although it’s the dark roast you said was too bitter. And it’s been sitting there a while.”
John’s laugh turned into a groan as the movement shifted Sherlock’s position in his lap. He rather suspected he was at least partially hard, which would be a Terribly Not Good thing for the detective to notice in the current situation. “The fact that I can see your bra and knickers through the fabric of your dress, mostly. Not a look most people go for.”
“Expedience, John,” the other Sherlock declared. “I can test both the giving and receiving end of things this way. And in a much more controlled manner than I could when I was limited to picking up drunk blokes at Uni.”
“Do it,” Sherlock demanded. Then twisted himself around enough to make eye contact. “Yes, I’m serious. I value your insight. Please, go ahead.”
“You’re only half right.” Sherlock stood and twisted sideways, waving John closer. “Which you’d have noticed earlier, if you’d have bothered to observe.  John, take a look.”
“The nails are optional; the penis isn’t.” Sherlock whirled and glared at him. “She was transgender, yes, but there are no indications of surgical scars or hormonal therapy so she either didn’t want it or couldn’t afford it. Not all trans women do, you know. Possible she identified as nonbinary femme, but statistically she’s more likely to be a trans woman.”
“Be right back.” Sherlock stalked--with astounding dignity, for a naked man sporting a raging hard-on--to the loo. Sure enough, two Sherlock emerged a few minutes later.
“Oh, spare me the wallowing,” Sherlock grumbled. “I did say I could fix you. Right, flip over. Legs next.”
“Did he.” John closed his internet browser and checked his email again, just in case something new came in during the last ten minutes. “I can’t help but notice that you tell me this only after nearly an hour of lying dramatically on the couch, stark naked, acting completely oblivious when I said good morning. Which most would also consider inconsiderate.”
Now that I'm done with that, though, I'm going to *try* to post a chapter a week of my unfinished fics on here. It may still take a while for some, and I'm not doing a strict rotation or anything, but I'm currently still poking at:
John propped himself up on one elbow… and promptly fell back flat on the seat cushions when one of the Sherlocks knelt on the floor with little fanfare and engulfed John’s cock in his mouth. “Guh.”
” John couldn’t hold in his chuckle, despite Sherlock’s immediate frown. “Hey, don’t be angry about it. I’m giving you compliments here. You’re supposed to be wanking.”
A nod. “Hence the body dump.” Sherlock looked down at his dress and grimaced. “I thought about using some fake blood for veracity, but I figured you would object to the cleaning involved afterward.”
Sherlock leaned back against the wall behind him and crossed his arms, smirk still firmly plastered on his face. “You, John Watson, are the most interesting client I’ve had in ages. I’m offering to suck you off. Repeated over the course of several sessions, if you like. If you unwind a bit, I think you’ll find your shoulder giving you much less of a problem.”
The man’s tone roused John enough to allow him to re-settle on his back, the sheet pulled back up to his shoulders. Sherlock flipped the bottom right corner dramatically upward and folded it deftly over John’s left thigh, exposing his right leg.
“Fucking hell.” John braced himself on the coffee table, now that Sherlock’s knee was no longer supporting his torso, and watched in awe as the spent Sherlock hoisted the other Sherlock’s arse higher in the air and fucking
John slowly fumbled with the sheet until he had it tugged down to his navel. The extra fabric conveniently helped cover his persistent hard-on. “The shot barely nicked the underside of my clavicle, luckily didn’t take out my lung, but blew the hell out of my scapula on the way out. Took two surgeries to reconstruct it.”
“That’s the most likely explanation, yes. Meaning it was someone who knew her enough to feel remorse she died but not well enough to notice how much care she put into her nail polish. That was a fresh manicure.”
“No, feel free.” John settled back in his armchair and crossed his arms behind his head. “Want to give me a more dynamic view?”
I” and “Please do” overlapped, but John chose to respond only to the latter. The Sherlocks watched keenly as he stripped off his jumper, unbuttoned his shirt, and shucked his trousers and pants. By the time he was reclined across the sofa and palming his already-interested prick, the Sherlocks were both fully aroused and fully focused on him.
“You got rather upset last time I did that,” the other Sherlock said, now lounging against his bedroom doorframe, “and I did promise not to do it again.”
“Ah, but I’m already dead, or as good as. And you know you’ll be the first to come under suspicion. Perhaps the fall wasn’t
work that great bloody brain of his, but sometimes it helped to pretend). He sat back and looked over the body as a whole. Which was… naked.
Sherlock nodded. “Second question: what is it about sex you dislike? Surely you’re not squeamish about the fluids involved, given your eventual profession?”
“We already established that I’m hopelessly boorish,” Sherlock said dismissively. “That was the starting point for this entire conversation, if you remember.”
“You do understand, right?” John asked as they tumbled onto his bed. “As nice as it would have been to ravish you on the floor of the sitting room, I refuse to have our first time be a continuation of you role-playing a dead woman. We moved up here because number one, I know it’s actually clean, and number two, I needed a bit of a mental reset button in between.”
“The trapezius runs all the way down to your mid-back and anchors to the T12 vertebra,” Sherlock murmured. “Focusing pressure entirely on your shoulder won’t do a damn thing because it’s ignoring half the muscle. Even warming up the entire trapezius--” he suited the action to the comment, rolling his knuckles in glorious undulations across John’s skin “--isn’t enough because the scar tissue is three-dimensional and the trapezius is relatively flat. We need to reduce tension on your entire spine. Being back in London is stressful for you, yes?”
Classic Sherlock. “I think,” John said, “I might find that an acceptable circumstance. There aren’t that many genius consulting detectives with sexy voices and an apparent lingerie kink out there, you know. I can’t imagine anyone else out there could meet my exceedingly high standards.”
The massage therapist’s office was unlike any medical place of business John had ever seen. Most doctors’ offices were dull, generic, and full of mass-produced beige furniture designed to withstand decades of abuse by patients without showing wear. This office had a blackout shade over the sole window and the walls were lined with an assortment of anatomical oddities. Nothing too grotesque, but the laptop on the tiny desk in the corner had what looked like a real human skull on it.
“Lestrade told me something interesting yesterday,” Sherlock commented. “He said it’s inconsiderate for me to walk around the flat in the nude.”
inadvertent. You shoved me, or tripped and knocked into me and sent me sprawling, or we were having a lovers’ spat and you lashed out. Or perhaps you don’t have a good history with law enforcement and know you won’t be taken seriously. However it happens, your date is now a cadaver.”
she a sex worker, then? I know that’s a stereotype, but transgenders are disproportionately over-represented in--”
, John,” Sherlock breathed. “I sometimes think about… there was that case, a few months ago, where you essentially tackled me in that warehouse when we heard gunshots, remember that?”
“The other me only lasts for half an hour,” the pajama-clad Sherlock added. “Would like to see if I can extend the duration.”
“Ah.” Sherlock stared up at the window in silence for a moment. His face was blank, but John could imagine the gears whirring away below the surface. Emergency remodeling of the mind palace, no doubt.
“I think I’d like to do an experiment of my own sometime, if you were amenable. I’d be interested in learning what parts of you are hard or soft, calloused or smooth… all that haptic data. You surprise me, sometimes, with how warm you actually are. When we end up huddled together for some reason or another and I can feel your body heat seeping into me. Your skin is warm even when your words are cold and cutting. That’s the part of dating I enjoy most, honestly - snuggling, cuddling, whatever you want to call it. Having a human being whose company I enjoy and who enjoys my company in return, voluntarily touching me in comfortable ways.”
The victim was completely nude, lying face-up in the filthy alley. Sherlock approached and crouched less than a foot away, bending practically double to examine at every possible angle. John had to give him a bit more room, given the narrowness of the alleyway, but he tried to peer over Sherlock’s shoulder as best he could.
“I can’t clone my clothes, obviously,” the Sherlock in the suit said. “I’m off to drop some off at the dry cleaner’s while the other me fine-tunes some details on the cloning machine. Since I’ll be going through them faster.”
“And showed his remorse by stripping off her clothes and makeup, dragging her out to an alley naked, and stabbing her?”
John toed off his shoes and relaxed onto the sofa. “Go ahead,” he said, and waved his hand indicating they should get on with it. “I’ll just watch from here.”
“We’ve been practicing all afternoon,” the other Sherlock said, seating himself on the corner of the coffee table and presenting his erection at approximately John’s current head height. “Unfortunately, I’m too tall for you to reach while standing and I don’t think I can get close enough while sitting without my legs getting in the way.”
“Forever is a long time.” Hopefully it wasn’t just the post-euphoric endorphins talking, because John was extremely tempted to take him up on it. “We’ll both get cold, eventually. Seeing as we only have one pair of trousers and pants between the two of us.”
“Oh, you like it when I say you’re mine.” It wasn’t exactly a genius-level deduction. “The list of people I would kill a stranger for is a very short one nowadays - be honored you’re on it.”
Sherlock’s body went impossibly taut for a long moment. All except for his hips, which were stuttering frantically as he fucked into John’s fist. One, two more thrusts, then John was joining him in a near-simultaneous climax. Sherlock went limp after, letting out a sigh that said more than the proverbial thousand words might about how much he enjoyed himself. John rolled off and sprawled next to him, still breathing heavily.
John shot "his" Sherlock what he hoped was a smug look, then set to focusing on the task at hand. Or at mouth, as it were. He balanced his chest over the man’s thigh and tried not to move his lower body too much as he worked. Luckily, both Sherlocks seemed to approve of the situation. It took a few tries, but John finally maneuvered himself to where he could palm Sherlock’s bollocks and pump the base of his cock at the same time while he was sucking on the tip. He knew it was succeeding when Sherlock gave a full-body shiver and moaned loudly. The sound prompted the other Sherlock to moan too, which felt goddamned amazing around John’s prick.
reason I was so happy when she got her own place, but it was certainly a contender. No one wants to see their little sister’s knockers. Or knickers.”
“I tried it, for a few years,” Sherlock admitted in a delightfully unsteady voice. “Piano is Mycroft’s thing, though. He’s crap at violin, which is why I stuck with it.”
Sherlock studied him quietly for a long moment. “It’s why you go through so many girlfriends,” he abruptly concluded. “They appreciate you being ‘gentlemanly’ the first date or two, but eventually they expect you to perform coitus with them. You’re unable and uninterested so they cite some other, more socially-acceptable reason to reject you.”
“I’m not exactly heterosexual either. Sorry if that messes up your deductions. I’m not usually interested in cis men, true, but that doesn’t mean I only like cisgender women. You’ve thrown me for a bit of a loop here. And I’m only saying it this plainly because if I don’t, I know you’ll disappear into that mind palace of yours chasing increasingly outrageous theories. It’s really not that complicated.”
“Squeamish, no. I don’t object to the concept of sex, Sherlock, I’m simply not intersted in the act when it pertains to myself in particular. Human bodies are simply… bodies. Everyone has one. I went to medical school because anatomy is
Sherlock thrust into John’s hand, but John moved with him and slowed the gentle stroking even more. “Tease,” Sherlock grumbled.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up a bit at John’s use of the correct pronoun, and he settled back further into the seat of the taxi. “Surely you saw the upward angle of the wound,” he said. “She was already prone on the ground when the knife went in. Slowly--someone pressed, not jabbed. Worked their way between her ribs by feel rather than by luck. And since there was no evidence of her moving or trying to get away, obviously she was dead first.”
He hadn’t even finished his sentence before John was shaking his head no. “Fuck, that’s not how I meant it to sound. Seeing you in knickers scrambled my brain pretty thoroughly - that’s my only excuse. This doesn’t change
a doctor,” John retorted before the man could dig himself in deeper. And then winced. “Or at least I was.”
“Yes. Sorry,” Sherlock murmured. “But that was one of the many times you’ve surprised me, and that’s the part
was putting it mildly. Not London itself as much as being broke and trying to make a go of it anyway. Moving out to some godforsaken village and becoming a country doctor would doubtlessly be cheaper, but it would be a slow death sentence for his sense of self.
“Why would it?” Sherlock sat up smoothly, hunching over his crossed legs and bracing his elbows on his knees in a way John hadn’t been able to manage since before getting shot. “You assume I’d find you less masculine and therefore less valuable of a person just because you’re asexual?”
Something akin to a smile slid onto Sherlock’s face. “That won’t be necessary,” he replied. “I don’t know how you failed to notice this, but I generally like being the center of attention.” He pressed a kiss to John’s bare shoulder. “The center of
“While we’re on the subject of compliments, though,” he continued, “there’s plenty about your ‘transport’ for me to appreciate, even if you usually don’t. Your voice, for one. Despite how often you’re an arsewipe to suspects, you sound good doing it. Part of me loves how you can sound so mellifluous even when tearing some poor sod apart. And you have such graceful hands - good for the violin, I suppose, with those long fingers. As well as for picking locks and scaling impossible-looking walls when chasing suspects. I bet you get told all the time that you should take up the piano.”
“You might need to sit up a bit more, John,” the other said. “The angle will be uncomfortable for you if you don’t.”
“Freak’s here,” Anderson grumbled from behind them, where the rest of the team were milling. “Going to tell us the bloke was stabbed, I suspect.”
“That was all nice and romantic until you got to the ‘cocaine’ bit,” John replied drily. “Drugs probably shouldn’t be to go-to analogy for a healthy relationship.”
John grinned. “I’m never going to object to you flattering me, Sherlock. I won’t be shocked, whatever you say. So make it good.”
For only requiring such a small action, the sight of the sundress peeling back in two halves and revealing Sherlock’s overstuffed lacy knickers was certainly having a large effect on John’s cock. The lace wasn’t doing much to hide the fact that the situation was having a biological effect on the detective just as much as it was on John. The longer he stared, the more Sherlock’s prick took an interest in the proceedings. John only realized he was licking his lips and blatantly ogling when Sherlock cleared his throat.
hadn’t been the case for even longer than the touch starvation. Army work - even medical work - was an exercise in pushing through discomfort. Lack of sleep, fatigue, pulled muscles, sand in places sand shouldn’t ever go, it all rolled together into something to be coped with. Usually involving sheer willpower and more alcohol than was probably wise.
“I concur,” the other Sherlock said. “Now we should go through it all again, but with John watching.”
John nodded. Two seconds later, he was flat on his back and his pants were gone. Sherlock nudged John’s legs to the sides, so from the knee down they were hanging over the edges of the massage table, and lithely hopped up to kneel between them. John’s cock gave a little bob of excitement all by itself.
Sherlock gasped and shot all over his flushed chest. The scene was pornographic, obviously, but John felt a strange longing to photograph the moment and frame it. Pornography and high art both. Even post-orgasm, Sherlock was beautiful - breathing hard, cheeks pink, body tense and then suddenly limp in his chair. John wanted to scoop him up in his arms and carry him to bed for a long nap together.
“Don’t be embarrassed,” Sherlock said quietly. “I can already tell you haven’t been seen to properly before. Your previous massage therapist focused exclusively on your shoulder?”
John nodded. “Been three months now and the doctors say there’s no reason my muscles haven’t recovered better. I
“It’s June,” John continued, “meaning there’s a good chance she really was wearing a sundress. Summer colors tend to be lighter, so the bloodstains would be obvious. And she
I merely need to know what the primary difficulties would be, and if it’s possible for you to remove the obvious feminine signifiers without leaving additional evidence of your attempts behind.” He let his arms flop heavily and started listing to the right, causing John to have to re-adjust his grip around the man’s skinny torso. “These are the clothes I had, so obviously an approximation.”
“Not a hallucination.” The Sherlock in the dressing gown sat up and plodded over to sprawl in the only free kitchen chair. “I was bored, so I cloned myself.”
Sherlock’s eyes locked onto his. “Yes,” he said quietly. “So it’s a good thing we’re more than either of those descriptors.”
there were incredibly well-placed. The sight of those impossibly long legs running from skirt hem to black stiletto was something John would be seeing in his dreams for the foreseeable future.
He got a cocked eyebrow in response, which was eloquent all on its own. “I could claim I’m just that dedicated to my work,” Sherlock drawled, “but also I find you sexually attractive and clearly you feel the same way about me. Nothing I can do about that while on the NHS’s time, but if the session is done we can… indulge… as much as we like.”
“A plausible theory. Blunt to the point of rudeness, but plausible. And I think that’s the first time I’ve ever heard someone use the word ‘coitus’ aloud.”
“Assuming you have room in your appointment book… I’ll see if I can secure the last slot in your day. If I were to do that, what are the chances you’d let me buy you dinner afterward?”
“Whenever I’m in bed ill, I always get extremely randy,” Sherlock said rather cheerfully, his words partly muffled by his pillow.
Of course, Sherlock could have just left it at that and let Violet know. But he was determined to solve the mystery in its entirety, including Bob’s motive.
He thought about therapy. (Although he would only be able to talk about his guilt in the vaguest of terms, of course). But Ella had never really been able to help him in any meaningful way. If anything, she was the one who had ill-fatedly talked him into trusting people more – which hadn’t worked out very nicely for him at all. (Although that was hardly her fault, of course.) But moreover, her practice was so far from where he now lived that it would take him longer to get there than the duration of a session. And he didn’t feel like organising a babysitter for all that travelling time. Still, he felt he needed someone to help sort out the mess inside of his head. If not, he knew it would only get worse.
Sherlock stared long and hard at John, his eyes suddenly very shiny. He cleared his throat. “John, I’ve been meaning to tell you.”
to be. The chances of it being someone else with the same name and of a similar age were negligible. That name was so rare it was virtually non-existent.
They briefly embraced, before John took some crochet yarn and hooks and a couple of ladies’ magazines from his bag and gave them to her.
“I’m sure she was. Well, I’d better leave you to it, then.” She smiled sympathetically and made towards the door.
THE FINAL CHAPTER, AT LAST! As much as I loved working on this for the past two years and eleven sodding months (which is over three times as long as I thought I would need, aarrgghhh), I’m really glad that this enormous opus and labour of love is now done. :)
“There’s also security personnel on their way to Ms Hooper’s, Mrs Hudson’s, and Mr Lestrade’s house, just in case. Anything I’ve overlooked?”
As if he had any right to miss her as much as she did. To imagine her lovely smile and her ubiquitous, brilliant, humorous remarks. He probably still imagined making love to her, too.
They silently walked over and sat down, some distance apart, leaving room to carefully open the envelope between them.
, how that could have happened. Suddenly, all the puzzle pieces were falling into place with painful clarity: Sherlock being distant and harsh to most of the outside world, Sherlock abhorring emotions, Sherlock not understanding relationships…
It vaguely started coming back to him then. He had only the faintest memory of ordering it and taking it with him somewhere, because he missed hearing John’s voice. To John’s therapist’s, it seemed. He’d obviously planted it there when he’d gone there to collect John for their visit to Smith.
The damage that Moran had managed to cause between Sherlock thinking she was gone and her actually being gone now was… pretty fucking impressive. In a devastating way, quite literally.
With incredible effort, John opened his eyes. To his surprise, he was lying down on a comfortable mattress, under white covers, with drips and tubes connected to his body. Sherlock was sitting right next to him, staring blindly at John’s bedsheets. He seemed sad. Then John realised Sherlock was gently holding his hand. That felt nice.
From the way he held the painting and approached them with it, Sherlock could tell it was another gift.
Lestrade’s reaction was slowly threatening to become even more embarrassing than Mrs Hudson’s, who had been harassing them with her smiles and winks and extra food ever since she had caught them kissing in the hallway.
“And very applicable to one person in our current situation, who showed up exactly in the place where she shouldn’t have been.”
Sherlock quickly opened his eyes and sat up straight. He ran a hand through his hair and went to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water.
Upon reaching the landing, the living room door flew open and John came out and hugged him. For several long moments, they just clung to one another, burying their faces in each other’s necks.
Despite his discomfort, John had to make an effort not to snigger at Sherrinford’s remark. He pinched the bridge of his nose so as not to reveal any of the thoughts going on inside his head.
Holding his fingers pressed lightly to John’s neck to keep checking his pulse, Sherlock took out his phone and called Lestrade. “Greg. I need you here. Right now. I think we’re looking at attempted murder. It’s John.”
“Well, yeah, I don’t really want to go into that,” John said. It was a stupid story, anyway. It would instantly fall apart under scrutiny.
Sherlock’s eyebrows had shot up and a faint smile started to play around his lips as he stared blankly ahead.
They both got up from their seats, startled, and walked towards the front door, to see what had happened.
He kissed Sherlock, smearing lipstick everywhere, two colours mingling, before moving over to his ear, where he whispered ‘I love you, I love you’ over and over as he drove into him. When Sherlock reached for his prick, John gently batted away Sherlock’s arm, swearing to himself to give him the best blowjob of his life afterwards.
John stood stock still, though breathing heavily, with his gun arm still in her direction, eyes wide with shock. The only person moving or making a sound was Vivian Norbury, gasping and muttering to herself “Oh dear. That’s
“Everyone has hobbies,” Sherlock countered. “Doesn’t say a thing about their age. Maybe he just looked younger than he was.”
“Now here’s the thing. Violet has an uncle who moved to South Africa years ago and has hardly been in touch since her father died; his brother. And guess what?” Sherlock held up both hands, palms facing the ceiling. “Turns out he’s made a fortune in the gold business and doesn’t have long to live. No other heirs except his niece in the UK.”
Unwilling to let go of her, he kept stroking her beautifully soft, pitch black fur. After a while, he walked over to his chair and sat down with the puppy in his lap.
Finally, Sherlock dared to believe. John really wanted him, no matter what. Strange but true, apparently.
The idea behind the text-flirting had been to lure John away from Rose, with the advantageous side-effect of annoying the shit out of Rose, once she would find out, of course. And Sherlock Holmes would probably not be amused, either – not even being second but third best – which was excellent.
(He was always quite pleased when an apparently useless bit of information he’d memorised turned out to serve a purpose later on. But not usually
He’d been planning to postpone killing Sherlock Holmes until after he’d had a nice number of sessions with him, but he was definitely going to rethink that now. He would first go and destroy the devices. And then, he might come back for the final round later this very afternoon.
At the same time, John couldn’t quite push away the doubts emerging in his thoughts – like little poisonous gas bubbles in a lake – about whether this was going to last. With Sherlock, you never knew how long something new was going to hold his attention; not to mention that John was wondering whether it would even be possible at all to have a serious relationship with a self-proclaimed sociopath. John had had so many relationships crash and burn for lesser reasons. Until yesterday, he hadn’t actually thought Sherlock capable of romantic feelings and although he had been proven wrong, it remained to be seen exactly to what extent Sherlock would be able – and happy – to maintain an actual relationship.
For years, waking up next to Sherlock had just been a far-fetched fantasy, and now the opposite – the idea of waking up without Sherlock by his side – seemed utterly unthinkable.
So now here he sat, on a train racing westwards, wearing his builder’s garb and a reversed cap, green-framed glasses, a silver earring, a large Celtic tattoo in his neck and seemingly missing a tooth, while all kinds of facts and curiosities on tile battens, ridge vents and roof insulation materials swirled through his mind. Plus, of course, the details of the missing boy’s case.
It took two days before Sherlock stopped trying to find the right moment and he just blurted out in the middle of clearing away the dishes after dinner, “Listen, John, I know you want out, right? It’s only logical.”
“Missing child,” Sherlock had lied. “Walked out of his parents’ back garden never to be seen again. Three years old. Had just hurt his knee ten minutes prior, so Toby might be able to trace the scent of his blood.”
They didn’t often share a closed-mouth kiss, or at least not one that lasted this long. But this one seemed to seal the most important promise they would ever make. To stick together, as a family. And the duration seemed symbolic of the durability of their pact.
But why do these damn women natter on at the speed of light – drowning everything they say in a sea of details – anyway? It’s not that Sherlock, for instance, never does that, but at least he compensates by being silent for a few hours after rattling off one of his deductions. Also, what he has to say is usually actually interesting. And relevant.
But while John was taking the tissue samples, a thought occurred to him. Would it be sensible to have himself tested as well?
John, never closing his eyes for more than a few seconds during sex, always making sure it was really him. As long as he could see, hear and smell John – his wonderful, steadfast, loyal John – everything was alright.
Thankfully, he’d come rather a long way since then, even though it had been a bumpy road (which also hadn’t exactly ended yet, but at least he had John by his side now).
gone back on drugs? Was that why he’d seemed to have completely lost his marbles, tweeting stuff like that? John wanted to see him, more than anything. But not like that.
Fully entrusting Sherlock with his body and soul – with everything he was – was definitely, by far, the most liberating thing he’d ever done.
To distract himself from the fear of John somehow finding out about the device, he started rummaging through the mess that was his desk in an attempt to clear away the clutter. He needed to tidy up his stuff as much as he needed to get his life back in order. Preferably with John still in it.
Sherlock grinned. “Dan White at your service, Your Lordship,” he said with a small nod and a slight Yorkshire accent. “I’m sure I’ve changed a bit since you last saw me, but here I am, in the flesh.”
“I’ll put it quite plainly,” John heard himself say. Here went nothing. “I don’t ever want to be with anyone else anymore. Ever. No matter what. So there. I love you. I love you with every fibre of my soul, Sherlock. I love you so much it hurts. Nevertheless, and precisely because of that, actually, I never ever want to stop loving you and I don’t intend to ever leave you.” John swallowed, fidgeting with his teaspoon on his saucer. “If you are one day actually going to keep bees in bloody Sussex, I still want to be right there next to you, and reminisce about the life we’ve had together as we sit in our little garden. Because I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Sherlock Holmes.” John paused and gently grabbed Sherlock’s hand over the table. “I will follow you wherever you go. That is, if you’ll let me.” They locked eyes. “Please, will you marry me?”
And then Harry said something she hadn’t even thought about before. It was as if sitting here peacefully with her brother, his baby daughter and his boyfriend had suddenly let the final piece of her click into place. “I’m happy,” she smiled, earning her three smiles mirrored back at her.
He nuzzled Sherlock’s shoulder, breathing in his wonderful scent as he pressed his chest close to Sherlock’s warm back. Not entirely coincidentally, his morning wood aligned perfectly with Sherlock’s bum crack. Without thinking, he undulated his hips to create some welcome friction. That felt good. He dozed off again, dreaming about a deserted beach, with not a soul in sight but for Sherlock and himself, where they lay on the soft sand, making love.
And just when John had started seriously considering acting upon his feelings, they’d had a row and Sherlock had jumped.
As he put the mugs on the table for them, and handed one to Sherrinford over at the window, he continued to chatter away where he’d left off.
“Oh god, yes,” John exclaimed, his words muffled by Sherlock’s collar. He pulled back to look at Sherlock, then pressed their lips together, before pulling back once more. “God, yes, I will. Always have been,” he added lightly. “We just didn’t know it.”
“I love you too, John. Love you,” Sherlock murmured before he drifted off again in a blissful fever- and sex-induced sleep.
This time, Sherlock did register every detail, but not because he felt he needed to commit the kiss to memory and make sure he never forgot what John’s mouth felt like on his.
“Yes, I think he could come in very useful. We need to create a circumstance that breaks the deal without any trouble.” Sherlock was staring into the flames, obviously brooding on some plan.
Slowly, John deepened his thrusts, until soft moans of desire became muffled cries of pleasure in the silence of the room.
He studied the live feed again to properly observe what was happening, trying not to focus on the obvious.
Don’t worry, the story isn’t finished yet! There will be five more chapters to round everything up. No loose ends. Not on my watch. ;)
John momentarily froze, then continued to fill the kettle and put it back on its base. He flipped the switch and went over to sit next to Sherlock.
It was the only way to let John know how he really felt, what he really wanted. Relief washed over him as the decision took shape in his mind. He knew the perfect place to propose, a quiet tea garden just outside London called The Golden Beehive, where his parents had taken him and Mycroft a couple of times when he was little. It was a picturesque location surrounded by hawthorn trees and intersected by elaborate flowerbeds; and they had the best scones he could remember ever having eaten. And 2 July would be the perfect day. Sherlock smiled. He would make a reservation as soon as John was out of the room, so it would remain a surprise.
She hadn’t been back in a while. Too much going on with work back in Volgograd. Especially with the current situation in Chechnya, just ‘down the road’ – in Russian terms, that was. Human rights being violated left and right, let alone LGBT rights. The Russian LGBT Network was busier than ever, especially since the new collaboration with the United Nations Human Rights Committee.
in the simultaneous sensation of blood rushing, skin flushing and vision narrowing down to only each other.
“Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate security concern,” Mycroft said sternly. “The fact that I’m his brother changes absolutely nothing. It didn’t the last time and I assure you it won’t with...” At that, he seemed to stop himself and paused for a long moment.
Sherlock turned his head toward John’s face to reply, but the only response his brain was apparently capable of with John pressed close to him like this was to kiss him. It was a motionless locked-lips kiss, which froze time and made Sherlock’s mind go blissfully peaceful and still. That was, until he suddenly became aware of a half-hard prick pressing against his leg, which promptly made his heart beat in his ears.
The little group of Holmeses standing there chatting away in that manner they all had in common, forming a rather colourful contrast with the rest of the guests, also made Sherlock realise that, try as you might, you can’t ignore your family. They give your identity a necessary context, stupid as that sounded, but it really was true. They played an essential part in shaping you as a person – even if you didn’t especially like how they made you turn out.
“John, I’ve lied to you.” Sherlock’s gaze fluttered from John’s knees up to his face and back again. “That one time when you asked me if I’d ever bottomed with anyone before and I said no, I lied. And then I lied about it again two weeks ago when I claimed I’d never had any sort of sex with anyone else, ever. It’s just that… I was fourteen, and… my geography teacher… I used to really like him… looked up to him, in fact, and I used to help him out sometimes with experiments, you know, in the storeroom... never once realising...” He swallowed and looked down again, focusing on his own hands now.
“Oh! That would be lovely, yes. It would make three visits in four months. Bad for the environment and all,” she chuckled, “but I’ll consider it.”
He’d sat on a bench facing their flat, reading a newspaper for several hours. Then he’d stood at a bus stop just across the street for a bit, until finally, he’d seen the pair leave the building. There was hardly anything to be deduced from what he saw, though. Steve was walking with crutches and looked weak, and Craig chattered as he walked beside him, slowly and attentively, apparently elated to have him back.
“Take care,” Sherlock said. He swallowed, trying frantically to think if there was anything else he could say. He was sure there was, he just didn’t know what it was.
Then, with that one hand still touching Sherlock, it is suddenly very easy to casually add his other hand and to rest it slightly higher on Sherlock’s other flank.
As he looked at his lover, no longer aware of the other people and noises surrounding him, he was suddenly overcome by an irrational feeling of gratefulness (grateful to who?) that he had been honest with John that fateful day – which he’d initially thought had ruined everything between them, when quite the opposite was the case, he knew now. Honesty had made their relationship so much stronger, in ways he couldn’t have imagined.
He laughed. “Thank you!” He turned away for a moment, shaking his head as if in disbelief that a woman was flirting with him just like that.
She gave a perfunctory summary of the projects she was coordinating with the local LGBT Network division, but to her surprise, Sherlock kept asking new questions about the things she told them, showing genuine interest and wanting to know more about her work, her ambitions and her new homeland.
Sherlock suddenly felt a deep shame as he realised he had no idea how or when John’s mother had died.
Feigning panic, Sherlock pointed a hand at Smith. He didn’t mind that his arm was shaking. “Watch him. He’s got a knife.”
Whenever John saw happy looking couples on the street, he wondered how long it would be before they started hating each other’s guts. And once they did, if any of them would ever have such a good reason as he’d had for hating his wife. Her behaviour surely had to fall in the ‘exceptional’ category, even though it had become a normal fact of life to him.
He jotted the time and location down in his diary, intending to tell Sherlock later that the lady had called.
She had only wanted to separate Sherlock and John in a way that was cunning and that her brother would have approved of.
Would he ever see John again? John hated him; that much was clear. The ferocity with which John had knocked him down spoke volumes. He could still feel John’s fist against his temple.
Since her eyes were already adjusted to the dark, she could vaguely make out Sherlock and John spooning with their backs towards her, Sherlock nearest. They both appeared to be naked and not covered by sheets, which in itself wasn’t strange for a warm summer night like this. But then she blinked to check if she was seeing correctly – and that it wasn’t her alcohol-addled brain imagining movements that weren’t real.
“I just wanted to bring you some of these,” she said, carefully setting the plate down on the little table beside him. “They are honey biscuits. I baked them this morning. I was trying out the recipe for Mrs Turner’s charity event next week. She’s raising money for the homeless pets vets.”
John realised he should probably soon go back to work, now that he’d almost fully recovered from the damage inflicted by the rubber bullet and the subsequent time he spent being in a coma, and the threat of Eurus had been eliminated.
He didn’t feel like telling her the official fake version, because it would take three hours to explain. Sherlock hadn’t exactly come up with a simple story that was easy to remember, either.
Sorry for the long radio silence, guys. Real life has a habit of getting in the way. :/ But starting this month, I’m working fewer hours at my job, leaving more ‘me time’, hence more writing time. :)
John frowned, wondering what had gotten Sherlock so worked up. Was he seriously that nervous about...
Trust Sherlock to do enough google searches until he’d determined that John would have a much bigger chance of getting full custody directly, rather than having the baby stay part-time with Mary in prison for the first 18 months, if he could prove that he had a proper bond with the child.
As soon as they were back on the lonely country road and out of anybody’s sight, they finally kissed. John ended up pushing Sherlock against a tree to get a better hold. They had almost three weeks of barely touching to catch up on.
She tried to smile and lifted her chin. “Sorry, I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. It has nothing to do with the case, of course.” She cleared her throat, looking towards the door, her face flushed.
By the time the last aspiring Prince Hamlet had finished, Sherlock thought he could recite the entire soliloquy by heart himself.
23 September. Sherlock was trying not to get his hopes up too high as he was preparing his morning toast.
When he came to, Faith was long gone, but her ‘anyone’ still echoed in his ears. And right then, the jigsaw pieces finally started to fall together in his mind.
After a brief glance at the offerings, John turned his head to look up at Sherlock with a blank stare. “What’s this?”
But Sherlock had one more plan up his sleeve to even further increase the chance of successfully getting rid of Jack, which was, after all, Violet’s primary concern.
He’d contacted Mycroft, who had informed him that Lady Smallwood had been in charge of foreign crises like these at the time. Sherlock persuaded him to dig up the file, to see if Mary (Rosamund) could have been involved. Mysteriously, there had been no file, which even Mycroft found suspicious. Mycroft then interrogated Lady Smallwood, allowing Sherlock to watch from behind tinted glass.
And soon he realised, this was no blog post he was writing. This was going way too far off the rails for that. This was a short
“Indeed.” Sherlock looked at his watch. “You have – I estimate – twenty minutes left.” Smiling, he walked towards the door which Smith was about to push open.
Trying hard to ignore his own by now rather painful erection, he started kissing a trail up Sherlock’s left leg towards his crotch. Once there, he planted another dozen kisses all over his cock through the lace, ending with one on the tip, which stuck out partly from beneath. John was imagining that even Sherlock’s squirming had a definite feminine edge to it now that he was in women’s clothes.
Sherlock had deduced back then that she’d probably used dice to determine where she went, linking the numbers to references in a pocket atlas, or something of the sort.
For how long had John been feeling this way, he wondered? Could Sherlock have made this move years ago?
“Jesus, sorry,” John said, holding on to a lamp post with a faint smile. “Perhaps I slightly overestimated myself.”
Had it been a mistake to mention Mary in this way? “So, um, what is this other story about, then? The Ring?”
Sherlock then gestured towards the therapist standing in the consultation room with a phone to her ear. “Who’s this one? Is this a new person? I’m
The skinny dark-haired boy with the dog-paw tattoo flat on his back with his knees drawn up high as the muscled blonde pushed into him. The same youth bent over a desk with the other man slowly entering him from behind, while he turned his head so that they could kiss at the same time. The boy with his back against a wall, his legs wrapped around his partner’s waist as he was being held tightly in place by the blonde, whose hips meanwhile rhythmically moved forward and back.
He stared at the strange, stripy impression of clouds on the black and white wallpaper behind his new therapist and wondered why he kept lying his arse off.
“Hmm,” Sherlock said. “I don’t know. Crossdressing, pretending to be other people? Acting? She’s trained as an actress. Not sure how any of that gets us anywhere, though.”
by surprise. As he instinctively clutched Chloe – who was still on his lap – in a protective embrace, he awkwardly, and much too slowly, turned around to see who the perpetrator was, while also telling himself how much of a complete idiot he was.
absence had burned a much deeper hole into her soul (despite her having had more time to get used to it by now, which she really hadn’t), because he’d always been around – not only for a longer time, but also on a more regular basis.
After tea was brought to their table, Sherlock said, “Listen, um, I owe you an apology. John made me realise I really shouldn’t have said what I did, last time. I’m sorry.”
“But she was adamant about this,” Greg continued, between sips of tea. “She wanted to thank you. She said, quote, ‘her life was now perfect and she was even back in touch with her uncle’. Whatever that means; I’m sure you’ll know.”
Just before blowing out the candles, he recalled he was supposed to make a wish. But there was nothing left to wish for. He smiled. Everything was perfect just the way it was. So he blew them out just like that, under loud applause.
The next morning, when Sherlock was in the middle of an experiment involving twenty-five dead mice and eighteen pounds of calcium oxide, the postman finally delivered the essential item for his other research. Or rather, practice.
Sherlock Holmes had been called back. And with that, the chances of John Watson eventually leaving Rose had at least increased to some extent again, seeing as it would clearly only be a matter of time not only before Rose would pull another stupid stunt, like shooting someone else John cared about, but also before these two idiot consulting detectives would finally realise they were made for one another.
“Having said that,” John continued, “the impression I got was not that of an unhealthy relationship. At all, actually. Although again, that might not say everything. Tea?”
The only thing that seemed to help to distract himself from these thoughts was to drown himself in work. He now regretted having only a couple of shifts a week at the surgery. So he repeatedly found himself scrubbing the sink and the worktop in the kitchen, and once even all the floors in the whole flat, just to focus his energy on something else.
Janine carefully cupped her hands around the hot mug, letting the wonderful warmth seep into her cold fingers. “Now
Sherlock’s Italian was just good enough to know that these sentences meant: ‘The special black pearl has disappeared’, ‘The special one is still not found’, ‘Speculations about the lost special one continue’ and ‘English police still baffled by the lost special one’.
In a flash of a moment, Sherlock was reminded of another shocked couple in a similarly fancy restaurant, and he quickly pushed the memory away. John had forgiven him and all had turned out well.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, contemplating. “Well, in my case I suppose it was fear of rejection,” he said softly, looking at John from the corner of his eye. “Despite all my deduction skills, I could never figure out how you felt about me. Ever since we met, I’ve considered that my greatest flaw.” He paused. “Perhaps I was blinded by fear. Fear of being rejected and then losing you.”
Today, he and Rosie were visiting the nursery he and Mary had enrolled her at, in order to receive the final bits of practical information. Thankfully, it was no problem for her to start there earlier. John had decided to go back to work the following week. And Rosie was definitely ready for some more action in her life than just the same old toys and no one else to play with but her half-depressed dad.
The waiter led them to a table behind a divider with plants on it and re-appeared shortly thereafter with the wine list.
John had made Sherlock responsible for her getting acquainted with solid foods. So Sherlock had drafted a possibility matrix, where he gave her two different kinds of fruit or vegetables in various stages of preparation each time: unboiled, boiled, whole, cut or mashed. He noted down all her preferences, and investigated how those changed over the course of time. It gave him a purpose, at least. And he loved everything to do with Rosie. Raising a little one had turned out to be much more of a challenge than he’d ever foreseen – and therefore, much less boring.
“No,” John said. He took a couple more steps into the room. “We’d agreed to stay out of touch for a while.”
However, just as Sherlock had explained to her they would, they soon took an exit onto a small country road, eventually bringing them to a tiny train station in a little village.
“Thanks, bye.” John stared ahead for a full minute, baffled, then opened a new tab in his browser to search ‘golden beehive epping’. Pictures of a beautiful tea garden appeared on his screen, with hedges and wild flowers and a romantic looking cottage-like building in the background, a close-up of an actual straw beehive surrounded by bees flying to and fro, as well as some appealing images of plates with delicious looking scones, cream and jam. All in all, it looked very picturesque. What on earth had Sherlock made a reservation in this place for?
John pressed his lips together. “Sure, you’re absolutely right. Let me help you.” He nodded and with gritted teeth – hidden behind an artificial smile – he stepped back into the shop.
They both looked up at a loud, banging sound: someone running up the stairs. Then the door flew open and a sort of tornado entered the room, startling a couple of the younger officers. A tornado that bellowed, “
John lifted his gaze back to Sherlock and he looked so afraid, that – with an electrifying shock – John suddenly realised it must be real. It couldn’t be an act.
well. His now-lover was sitting not twenty yards away from him and Sherlock could feel his soothing presence.
“And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, he seem'd to find his way without his eyes; For out o' doors he went without their helps, and, to the last, bended their light on me.”
As she was attempting to form words to say something back, Sherlock spoke. “So tell me, what are you working on in Russia at the moment?”
“Ten thousand pounds for the man who can say where your son is, right?” Sherlock said. “I’ll give you my bank details in a minute. Your son is right here, in your house. Do your fire alarms work?”
, he told himself as he let his eyes trace the colour-coded pieces of string connecting the notes on the wall, interspersed with key words.
“How was Sherrinford?” Sherlock asked, certain that Mycroft had visited him the day before. It had been his birthday, after all.
John was wondering whether she was still in love with Sherlock, and felt a little sorry for having stolen her love interest, even if there had never been and never would be any chance of Sherlock reciprocating her feelings. From her open posture, he seemed to observe that she was genuinely happy for him and Sherlock for having ended up together, but one never knew what went on inside other people’s heads and hearts. John liked Molly, and wished she could be as happy as he now was.
Sherlock nodded bashfully. “I’ve never loved anyone before this, John,” he then said. “And for the longest time, I didn’t think I ever would. But when you came into my life five years ago, it was very hard
Sherlock weakly reached out his hands to John. “John, you just woke up from a coma. You must have been dreaming.”
“To be honest, I had a funny feeling about this ‘freelance group’ from the beginning,” Vivian Norbury had said, “but Lady Smallwood had needed to act quickly. And this team had at least been in the region already. But they’d never worked with MI5 before, and their credentials were iffy at best.” She had looked thoughtful. “They called themselves The Peppers, I recall. Funny name.”
John’s blood turned cold when inside, he saw Smith at Sherlock’s bed, who instantly released Sherlock as he turned to look at the door.
Sherlock suddenly standing next to him at window, looking at him, then signing, “I want to ask something. You like to live in other house? Not far from here? Especially for deaf people?” He studied him for a moment. “There, everyone uses sign language. You want to go look tomorrow? Decide after?”
“And then, of course,” Sherlock went on, “there was the way they handled the situation after Redbeard was killed. I don’t really want to go into all that now,” Sherlock sighed, “and I really don't blame them for thinking Sherrinford did it on purpose, because that’s not the point. That wasn’t perhaps so much their fault, considering the way Nanny Forsyth had related to them what she thought she’d seen, and considering his previous behaviour.” He briefly closed his eyes. “But the fact that they never talked with me about what had happened, how I missed my dog, who was my closest companion at the time… and they simply pretended it had never happened, making it seem almost like we'd never had another brother… or a dog… That is something I find very hard to comprehend and accept.”
Ten minutes later, he clicked a link with background information in a mildly interesting looking case request. When his browser opened, however, he noticed another tab there with an unfamiliar web address. He must have opened it some time ago. When he loaded it, it turned out to be an audio link. He could hear a woman talking.
They were treating her nicely enough at Bronzefield. And truth be told, there was something thrilling about being seen as a spy, instead of the wallflower they usually took her for. And it wasn’t as if she was letting anyone down, or felt as if she had to explain herself to anybody. All of her close friends and relatives had died in the past decade, sadly – even her drunk brother (although they’d in fact not been close at all, of course). It was only Lady Smallwood she worried about. Should she tell her the truth?
“Plagiarised it. Didn’t you know? Couldn’t keep up her previous level of productivity once she’d had kids, I guess. The world is not fair for women.” She sniggered. “I hated my dad. God, he was
The sensation of being filled with John’s hard cock took over all active parts of his brain, washing out the annoyingly incoherent foggy shreds of useless, random, dreamy images that had been unsolicitedly invading his mind. There was only John, wonderfully aroused John,
Ten minutes later, he had successfully hacked Violet’s mailbox, using a trick he’d recently asked a programmer to teach him in exchange for verifying his alibi in a murder case. Then he typed an e-mail from her account to Bob.
I also want to thank all of the people who I’ve asked for all sorts of advice and who have given some of their free time to help me shape this story into the most realistic narrative I could: deaflock, ewebie, julzann, welovethebeekeeper, quietlymischievous, monikakrasnorada, smirkdoctor, myspecialhell, fatto-il-misfatto, johnlockismyreligion, chained-to-the-mirror and Hannah.
Sherlock had loved the way John had become undone below him, moaning and whimpering as if he were in danger of dying of pleasure. It felt as if he suddenly had magical powers, being able to make John squirm under his touch like that.
Hence, Sherlock had spent the better part of that Sunday reading up on roof tile laying, as well as watching instruction videos on the subject on Youtube, in between digging up a false earring, a pair of round-lensed glasses, the liquid eye-liner he used for fake tattoos and his black tooth wax, from his disguise chest.
“No, not that well,” Charlotte said (probably Charles in daily life, John thought). “He was really close to Sue Ann though, whom your friend is now talking to. What’s her name again?”
’, because of the way Eurus used to prey on my weak spot, back when she was just a random kid in our street.” He blindly stared at his mug in silence.
Just a reminder that Eurus is NOT Sherlock’s sister in this version! That was just a random thing she implied to John before shooting him. There’s no reason to believe that’s true at all, if you assume that TFP was John’s coma dream.
Through the tiny windows of the ambulance, Sherlock could see that they were almost at the hospital.
When they finally got to their floor, John let Sherlock open their hotel room door, as he thought he wouldn’t be able to muster the coordination himself.
“For now, shall we just book hotels only in the first three places she went to, with one day in between,” John suggested, “and then we can decide how fast and how far to travel further north once we’re there. Does that sound like a plan to you?”
However, in that indoor pool in Reading, where Sherlock had ambushed the intruder, switching on the lights as soon as the man had grabbed the Thatcher bust from the artsy glass side table, Sherlock’s final piece of doubt as to who he was dealing with here had instantly vanished. All it took was a glance at the man’s rare, limited edition watch, that Sherlock knew so well from the index of stolen items in the Colchester file (besides it clearly being the manly version of Mary’s watch).
His mother looked at Mycroft as if he was merely giving a mildly interesting academic lecture about something that didn’t concern her at all, absent-mindedly taking a sip of her drink.
He undid the safety straps and lifted his daughter out of the portable car seat. “You enjoyed that, didn’t you?” he cooed at her. “Always eager to visit new places, see new people. You curious little monkey. And you loved seeing Uncle Sherlock again, didn’t you? Yes, you
John and Rosie had practically been living at 221B a good deal of the time anyway, though, in the past months; every time Mary had disappeared, sometimes for days on end. And a lot of other days as well.
They’d not yet had a bath together, and although it was a bit of a squeeze, if felt wonderfully relaxing just sitting together: Sherlock leaning his back to John’s chest, surrounded by warm water and damp air as they listened to the little sounds of the bath foam.
“We bugged it with a GPS tracker, knowing that Mary would somehow manage to snatch it from us, which indeed she did – after drugging me – and that’s how we followed her to Morocco.”
It was almost as if he could feel himself turning into a new person, with an entirely new context. Like an old painting revealing new details when displayed in a different light. Or with layers of old grime removed.
“So, you’re from around here, then?” Charlotte asked, his fake eyelashes fluttering up and down comically under his earnestly wrinkled brows with every eye movement. John couldn’t help but notice how his purple eyeshadow had been applied with admirable perfection.
Something was definitely off, and Sherlock couldn’t put his finger on what it was. He realised that part of the problem was, he’d deleted almost everything to do with Sherrinford from his memory. “Can you explain why he’s never learnt sign language? I presume Mummy and Daddy tried to have someone teach him.”
John turned his head in surprise.  After eating lunch he'd picked up a book he was reading and he'd got so lost in it that he'd forgotten Sherlock was still in the room.  "Well," he cautiously said.  "It's fine if you never have anything to do with it," he added, just to ease Sherlock's mind.
The dog did seem to like him; she sat at his feet and looked up with an adoring expression.  He thought of Redbeard and his heart melted.  He sat down on the floor and let the dog crawl into his lap.
"I was fourteen. Too old for something so childish." That sounded so rehearsed to John that he suspected that it was something Sherlock had heard repeatedly.
Sherlock looked like he was about to comment further, but at that moment his mobile rang.  "Lestrade?" he said as he brought the device to his ear.  "Oh, that's good.  When does he want to meet with us?  Next Friday?  I'm sure that can be arranged."  He hung up.  "Speaking of the man, he got in touch with Lestrade and said he was coming to the Yard next Friday and he's willing to speak with us."
It was only when the punch came at him that he realized the man had taken it as some sort of commentary on age gaps in relationships and not that he'd been acting like a parent.  Sherlock was quick enough to bring up his arm and deflect the blow, using his other arm to make a fist and bring it within inches of the man's chin.  It was harder than usual, and he mentally cursed being stuck in a short body.  "Don't try that again."
"Your daughter said before she told you she had a hard time making friends.  Can you tell us about that?"
"I saw them carry one out.  I wasn't in the flat but was standing outside it."  Mrs. Murray looked like she was about to go on, but before she could Clark interrupted her.
Now John understood. Sherlock had apparently gone into a dissociative state as soon as the subject of childhood abuse came up. "I think we both need something to eat."
“Yes.  K's wealth is extensive enough that when no one else is available, children to assault can be bought.”  Sherlock was back to his calm deducting voice, even when Lestrade gasped in shock.  “Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena was one of them, and that money went to her mother's drug habit.  Since one threat she probably heard was that she'd be taken away from home if she told, her enforced stint in care was enough to make her not say anything again.  Like Moira Aherne, but more severe.”  He turned for the door.  “You may listen to the recording.  John and I are going back home.”
"Is it because you live in a flat? We live in one now. Dad says it's only for a while. He's working hard. He bakes." She shifted the bear to her opposite arm. "He works at home too, but once I get home from school Rory's my job."
"Did you already deduce that her brother wants to talk to you as well?"  Lestrade looked smug as he revealed his trump card.
Sherlock was the one who broke the long silence. "You're a very brave girl, Moira. Thank you for telling me all this."
"What's he doing?" John asked. He'd met her husband's brother, Martin, a few times. He knew that Martin had been living with Graham and Gloria for a while, first coming off drugs and then looking for work and looking after their son, Angus. Martin and Graham were part of a set of triplets and were very close. Their older sister had also crawled out of the pit K had put them in, but their brother had not.
Harvey apparently had not expected Phillip to say something like that; she froze in mid-step.  "Really?" she finally said in a tone of disbelief.
"Even when your daughter talked about this, did she ever say who was doing something to her?"  Harvey gave a slight shake of her head.
"Me and Michael - that's her father - shared time with her.  When Jennifer got taken in it was his week."
"Yes!  She told me that story about the airline that used to sell seats in the bathroom.  You have to admit that was funny."  He began to giggle at the memory.
"The Yard's attention, you mean? They were all seen at St. Bart's, the clinic. Most of them came in with unrelated injuries or nonspecific complaints, but there was evidence of sexual abuse on the examination. If we're looking at the pattern, it goes back about ten years. Different doctors at the clinic have documented it, and they are all listed in the file." Lestrade set down his now empty tea cup. "Phillip Rodgers was the one that caused the review of the cases. None of the victims said who the abuser was. There was one where the authorities thought it was the father, and his little girl was taken into care, but they were never able to connect him and he got her back eventually."
Once Lestrade had left the interview room, Mr. Ogbeide, Sherlock, and John arranged themselves in the remaining chairs.  Sherlock stopped to push the record button on the tape recorder before speaking again.  “As you know, Mr. Ogbeide, we're investigating a series of cases of child abuse, and your daughter has been mentioned as a potential victim.”  He nodded, and Sherlock continued.  “You are on the record as having brought your daughter to the A&E at Bart's.  Can you explain why you did this?”
He sighed at John's words.  "I guess."  He slunk back to the bedroom he'd woken up in.  The library books came with him and he put them on the side table before letting himself fall to the bed with a sigh.  It felt like he had fallen down the rabbit hole.
"You have nothing to make up.  She's the one who got tired of you."  When Sherlock didn't reply he added "There wasn't a way she'd take you back."
John was completely certain that Sherlock could have gone on about this for a great deal longer, but when he heard, "You brought him here, of all places?" and turned towards the sound of the voice to see a very indignant Gregory Lestrade, he was startled enough to not resume what he had been saying. All John could think was that he hoped this would not be considered his fault.
Since everyone else had already left, there was no crowd waiting for cabs, and in a few minutes he was back on his way home again.  As John ascended the stairs to their flat he smelled a faint bleach odor.  He hoped it meant that Sherlock had felt well enough to try some sort of experiment.  The very thought that an experiment was now a good sign made him laugh.  He opened the door and walked in.  Sherlock sat curled up in his chair, Hamish in his lap, watching the news.  The announcer was saying something about strife in the EU; the trial wasn't mentioned.
"Most of the time when someone comes early there's a crisis.  I live down the street and I make sure to get here a half hour early, in case someone shows up."  When John gave him a puzzled look, Eli went on.  "I'm the elder statesman here.  I've been coming to this group for nine years and some look to me as much as Dr. Dodson."
At noon on the dot, there was a knock on the door.  John got up to open it.  Both Lou and Susan stood there, each holding dripping umbrellas.  "Terrible day to be out.  Rain's coming down so hard I think I should start building an ark," Lou said, stepping inside.  "All right if I lean this against the wall?" He gestured to his umbrella.
"Not at first.  I felt sorry for him because he had no friends and he seemed so standoffish.  I couldn't believe that anyone would be fine with always being alone.  It wasn't until I saw him and his mother out for a walk one day that I realized there might be more to it."  Victor's face clouded with the memory.
"Hello.  Are you going to the trial tomorrow?"  John knew that Graham and Christine were going to be testifying that day.  Sherlock looked over at him as soon as he heard the word "trial," but didn't say anything.
The meeting was just about to begin when Tammy dashed through the door. "Just in time," she gasped out as she sat, her long blond hair sweeping off to one side.
He had no idea what to say in response and was glad when she left.  He'd have to ask John her name.  And no sooner did he think about him that the man appeared in the room Martin was in.  "Do you like Chinese?" he asked.
"You do have a lot of books about science." More footsteps, presumably moving back to the bed. He heard pages turn.
The man's whole bearing softened. "Come out of here and get something to wear. I'll lend you my mobile in a minutes."
"Why was your bee taken away from you?" John asked him. He wasn't sure what had made him pose the question, and fully expected to be mocked or given some non-answer.
"She was pretty shocked, even though we tried to keep it down a bit.  It's not like it's anything she's never heard, but I think it's different when it's her Mum they're talking about."
Phillip had just finished the cocoa when John heard someone coming up the stairs.  He took a deep breath.  Sherlock turned his head towards the door for a second.  Phillip didn't seem to have heard it.  Less than a minute later someone knocked on the door.  John jumped up to get it.  He opened the door to find a tired-looking Mr. Rodgers.  Before he could say anything, Sherlock jumped up from the sofa, blocking the view of the door.  "Good to see you here," Sherlock told him, carefully not addressing him by name.
"Of course they were," Sherlock said as he grabbed the sheaf of papers and began flipping through them.  "If they weren't they'd have been willing to make statements that She was nothing but kind to them."  He continued to study them until they were in one of the interview rooms.  "There are a lot of twins on this list.  Two sets of triplets, even.  How many triplet sets are taken into care each year?  It can't be very many."  From the way he was talking it was obvious that he'd drawn some sort of conclusion.  John wasn't sure if Lestrade had noticed it, and he knew better than to ask.
Possibly because Lou and Susan appeared to be alternating positions, John expected Clark to step up to the stand.  It came as a surprise that Harvey walked up there instead, looking like she was on a mission.  "Are you ever planning to move back to Ireland?" she asked Mr. Aherne.  Unlike when she had questioned Kieran, she did not attempt to soften her voice or sound anything other than accusing.
The whole scene would have gone on for an uncomfortably long time if Sherlock's mobile hadn't rung shrilly a half hour later.  "What is it?" he said in an almost normal voice.  "Do you want us to leave now?  Good, I don't want you to ruin the whole thing before Moira's had a chance to pick someone out.  We'll be there as soon as we can."  He disconnected the phone, smiling broadly, like he had been brought back to life.  "That was Lestrade.  He wants us at the Yard as soon as possible so we can go over everything he's been able to find about K."  He threw the blanket off like a discarded cocoon and reached for his coat.  John was glad to see him acting in a more normal fashion, and was also relieved that he had spoken of K and not Her with the ominous capitals.
For the first few nights after Sherlock's combination nightmare/flashback, John had waited for Sherlock to ask him to sleep in his bed again.  He always said yes.  After a few nights of this, John took the initiative and asked if Sherlock was still okay with this.  "It's fine," was all he would ever say.  After a few weeks, John didn't ask one night and merely came up to Sherlock's room shortly after he and Hamish had gone upstairs.  Sherlock didn't object and the next morning he stated, "Consider the current state default unless I say otherwise," a typically Sherlockian response.  Sharing a bed with someone who you were sexually attracted to, who themselves had admitted being romantically interested in you, and still not having any sex or intimacy was odd to John.  He'd shared a bed with nonrelated people before, but there it had been more along the lines of endless complaints about who was taking up the most room.  Since Sherlock always held Hamish in his arms the two of them didn't touch at all.  Their heads were close to each other, but their lower bodies stayed far away.
Mr. Rodgers sighed.  "We weren't together long.   Once she got pregnant with Phillip she wanted us to get married.  I refused; I knew a relationship between the two of us wouldn't work out.  Then the ultrasounds showed a girl, and she got excited.  When Phillip was born she was very disappointed."
"Phillip, you've done a lot of good work today. I would like to talk to you again if that is all right."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.  "Let me look at more of those medical forms you have," he said and without waiting for permission dragged the folder from the desk.  He flipped through the sheaf of papers, pulling out a few of them.  "The girl with the father who moved to Manchester, is this her?"  He held the paper in front of Lestrade's face.
John figured he'd have to be the one who knocked on the door, but to his surprise Sherlock used his free hand to knock.  In a few seconds the door swung open.  A woman regarded the two of them.  She was several inches shorter than John, with long black hair neatly pulled back.  As near as he could tell, she was in her fifties, with lines forming on her forehead and crow's feet near her brown eyes.  She seemed like a warm, motherly person, the type you felt at ease around.  She was holding a dish in her hands, as if she had been interrupted while doing the dishes.  "May I help you?" she asked.  John just stared back.  It seemed unreal that K was married, even if he logically knew lots of child molesters were married.  Sherlock's hand was now shaking in his.  Before either of them could say anything, her eyes narrowed.  "Sherlock Holmes," she said with surprise, and smiled at him.  "It's been so long since I've seen you.  I'd say you had grown, but you really haven't;  you might be a little skinnier though.  To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?"
John half-expected Sherlock to fall into one of his silent sulks, but to his surprise he responded with: "Why do you say that?"
Sherlock had been doing his best to avoid John for the past few days.  It seemed like any time John was at home he'd either be shut up in his room or just about to dash out of the door.  It made him hard to live with, but John knew there was no way they were about to be going back to whatever they had had before this case.
"I wish I could go back in time to stop all that."  He sighed.  "We've got an appointment with a therapist in a week and I'm trying to find him a tutor.  A psychologist did an evaluation for the trial and it came up in the custody hearing.  He said that Phillip was quite intelligent but the ongoing abuse made it impossible for him to do well at school and affected all his social interactions with his peers. So I'm trying to get him caught up.  I wouldn't tell just anyone that, but both of you know him well at this point."
"He's one of the children who was treated at the homeless clinic she worked at.  Once he found out she'd been arrested he disclosed to his parents.  He's got curly brown hair and different-colored eyes - one's brown and one's blue."  He tapped his fingers on the table unconsciously.
"Any musician who plays a brass or woodwind instrument will have a particular lip configuration and discoloration of the teeth. That pattern is narrowed in the woodwinds, due to the fact there is less space."
John recalled something Sherlock had said when the case broke.  “I remember.  You thought it was a man, so you didn’t think of her even though she had left the area.”
While Mr. Aherne wiped his eyes, Lou said: "No further questions," and he walked back to the prosecution bench.
"All he said at first was that she'd been hurt.  Social services rang me a little later and told me more."
"No," Phillip whispered.  "It was just like the other times and She had Her hand down my pants.  She had the same blouse on, the flowered one, and it was unbuttoned, mostly.  My head was against Her breasts and this time She said something about it."
"Are you and John having a to-do about something?  He's sitting in the sitting room like he just got unpleasant news."
"He's already had his social services visit, and he passed that.  His mother left him alone all weekend, she has done so before, and let him spend time with an accused child abuser.  What's more, he wants to live with his father."
Finally, unable to stand the quiet any longer, John said, "Are you going to wherever that flat is today? And are you just going there?  It might be a good idea to talk to the landlord before doing anything else.  At least you should call whoever it is after finding the building."
"You're very pale for someone who just was in Greece," John said to Peter as he sat down. John knew that had been the last destination in the trip. He didn't show any signs of having been in the sun, besides a few light streaks in his long hair and beard.
Mr. Aherne chuckled, the first time John had seen him look anything close to happy. "Dr. Watson, you must not have children. There's never one talk. You deal with those things as they come up. We've had quite a few conversations on the subject, and I knew she was aware it would happen to her. She'd seen a commercial for Tampax a few months back, and she asked me what it was about. I told her the truth, as much as I thought she could understand. I don't believe in lying to children."
Before John could even process what was going on, Sherlock had knelt down in front of him and was grabbing at his belt.  He undid the buckle, opened the button on the front of his trousers, and would probably have gone for the zipper if John hadn’t grabbed his hands and forced them on either side of him.  “What are you doing?” he said in horror.
"No.  Moira's intentions were good and she was trying to reach out to you with that.  You probably see it that way.  And you did lose your first one.  Even if you were really too old for it, I can see why it would be so upsetting to lose such an important part of your childhood."  Every time John talked to Sherlock so directly about his past, he felt like he was constructing a conversation from cobwebs.  "I would be pleased with it myself.  She did that because she cares about you.  That counts."
Sherlock had sat there silently for so long John looked over in surprise when he asked Graham, “What do you mean by apologize to Dominic and Martin?”
"Yes," John firmly replied. "All this... helped." A thought occurred to him and before he could think twice he asked: "Peter and Mari both said that their spouse was abused by a woman. How often do you see that?"
Phillip hesitated, and pointed a shaking finger to the dock.  “No further questions,” Lou said triumphantly.
“When I was listening to the interview with Phillip, I noticed that he said the flat didn’t look used, and I remembered that case.  Since it didn’t fit the pattern, and he didn’t live in the same neighborhood, he wasn’t originally thought to be part of all this. But he did say the flat was very clean and the shades were drawn.”  He opened the door to his office as he spoke, and at that moment a mobile let out a sharp series of rings.  Sherlock’s hand disappeared into the pocket of his coat and he pulled out his phone.
John wasn't sure if he was referring to Sherlock or both of them, but responded anyway.  "I've got an older sister."
“If we need to talk to you again, I’ll ring Graham and he can get all of you,” Lestrade said as the four siblings filed out the door in a great hurry.  Graham looked back and half-nodded before he vanished out the door.
"Once a week.  It was a bit out of my way but I didn't want to miss a second with her."  Mr. Ogbeide looked away as he spoke; the memory was clearly still painful.  "I'd go to the contact center and we'd visit there."
"I'm next if we're going by age," Graham said.  He clearly wanted to sound strong, but his voice wavered.  "You already know what it was like at first.  I thought living with Her was going to be all right.  Until one day.  There was a big bookcase in Her room with all sorts of books and magazines.  The other day She had gotten me a football magazine and I couldn't find it, so I went to see if it was in Her room.  I couldn't find it and was about to look someplace else when one magazine fell on the floor.  I picked it up to put it back on the shelf and then I saw it was a girlie magazine.  I'd seen them before but hadn't looked at one close up.  When I'd gone through a few pages She came in the room and asked me if I was having fun.  I figured She'd get mad at me but She said that I was just interested like everyone else.  Then She asked if I'd seen anyone naked like that in real life.  I said my sister and brothers and my dad.  She said anyone besides my family and I said no.  Then She asked if I wanted to see someone else.  I said yes before I could think about what I was saying and the next thing I knew She had taken Her blouse off.  There wasn't - She didn't have a bra on.  I couldn't help but look, and I really hadn't seen something like that before."  As he spoke, his face turned red.  "I just looked, and She said I could look all I wanted.  After a few minutes She put her blouse back on - She never took off her skirt - and left the room with the magazine.  I went downstairs then and found the football magazine on the couch.  For a while I couldn't stop thinking about how I'd done something wrong, even though I didn't know what it was."
"Did he tell you anything else?"  What John wanted to hear was that all four of them said that nothing had happened and K had been good to them.  He also knew that was unlikely.
The trial must have been more draining than John had thought, because as soon as his head hit the pillow he fell asleep.  He likely would have slept until morning without waking if he hadn't been awoken by an elbow to the ribs.  At first he just thought that Sherlock was twisting around in his sleep, but as soon as he was fully aware of what was going on he was hit by a thrashing arm.
“He was nice.  He said he’d help me if I was arrested and he knew what I was going through.  He’d tell me how he felt and I’d felt the same way too.”
"Yes. My wife, Nora, passed away three years ago." Mr. Aherne looked like he could say a great deal more on the subject, but did not.
"Yes.  You're probably wondering if there's still major problems.  Sometimes.  Not as often as before.  But I can always help the others."
John knew better than to dig deeper into that.  "Please get some sleep tonight," he found himself saying.
"I am going there," he merely repeated. "If you are so worried I will traumatize the child in question, you may stay with me while I speak with her. If you think I have crossed a line, you may remove me, although I don't think that will be needed."
It was a bee.  A large stuffed bumblebee.  Its yellow and black stripes shone like any new stuffed toy did.  It had two beady black eyes, six legs, and antennae.  Sherlock continued to stare at it as it sat in his lap.  He seemed paralyzed.
"He doesn't pull on the lead.  He is very well-behaved.  I made sure of that before I let Moira walk him by herself."
"I suppose that means you've had the sex talk with your older children?" John said. He wasn't sure if he was allowed to say anything, but he hadn't been ordered to leave, so he might as well try to help.
Sherlock looked up at him at that point, his flat expression dissolving into a scowl.  “I know that K is an abominable excuse for a person.  You don’t have to tell me that.  I’ve spent most of the night understanding that.  A thirteen-year-old boy has been constantly ringing me to give me somewhat more detail about what he and K have been doing for the past nine years.”  His voice was still flat.
"I didn't think about it until my father asked me that.  I'd seen his mother be horrible to him, but I didn't think that was quite what my father had meant."  The microphone made his soft sigh audible.
The next bit was hard to write for a variety of reasons, one of course being that since only Sherlock and Moira are in the room John can't see anything that happens.  Since he is also the point of view character, (and in this story, for mostly dramatic effect, there are no Sherlock perspectives), I had to write a whole scene based on what someone would hear. I think I did all right, but those sorts of things are tricky for anyone.
He pulled up a search engine and typed "fitton" into it. A ton of results came up, but nothing about the town.
"Yes, please," Phillip said, and John retreated to the kitchen with relief.  He made up another mug and put it in Phillip's hands.
John narrowed his eyes. "Sherlock Holmes. There might be someone in a book in your world or universe or wherever that's named that, but that is also the name of the person whose body you are in."
"You can ask her if you want, but if she's not comfortable coming here I'm sure Sherlock will talk to her at home again," John said quickly.
"She was neglecting Jennifer - not taking care of her properly.  And she wasn't trying to change.  We argued about it and she said she'd do something about it but never did."
"Quite," said Sherlock, his voice flat.  "Do you need us for anything at the Yard or should we part ways here?"
"That stage?" John could remember when Harry had been like that in one of her failed attempts at sobriety.
"The twenty-seventh.  They said there had been an arrest and Moira had to pick someone out of a lineup."
"I was hoping to tell him about his father.  Not right away, but before the court hearing."  Despite his words, he didn't sound distressed.  Or like he was feeling anything at all.
"Oh, they're just upset because someone swapped Skip for someone else. He looks just like him, but he's really Sherlock Holmes!"
"Hopefully you can go home in a few days." It was clear that the girl was feeling more at ease in his presence, but he didn't feel the time was right to bring up the issue of why she was in the hospital. "Is Rory named after Amy's husband on Doctor Who?"
“Is that information going to stay between the two of you?”  John wasn’t trying to be intrusive; he thought that those details weren’t really important to the case.  Besides, it was good for Phillip to tell all of that to someone.
As usual, once he got up to Dr. Dodson's office, someone was already there. Eli, the group's self-proclaimed "elder statesman" always showed up before anyone else. Today John was also greeted by Peter, who had apparently returned from his delayed honeymoon in Europe (the first one had been delayed by some sort of hospitalization of his wife).
“No.  At least he says he doesn’t know.”  He crossed his arms in front of his chest.  “I suspect he knows a lot more about this K than he is telling me.”
"Including me.  He lived on the end of the street I lived on and would walk home from school with me.  I made a number of comments to indicate I was not interested in his company, but he said that I was always alone and he didn't think anybody would enjoy that.  Eventually he brought up subjects of interest to me and I began to talk to him on those walks home.  He would also sit with me during lunch hours and invited me to his home on several occasions.  His mother and father were both academics; he used that information to convince me I would enjoy spending time at his home.  He also had a bull terrier, his family had several, and as you may recall I wanted a dog myself as a child but was not allowed to have one."  He stopped staring at the spot and stared into his lap instead.
When another victim showed up at the Yard a few days later, Sherlock talked to him as well. Sherlock even reassured him that he'd been through the same thing. Although Sherlock knew that John knew, he still maintained his silence. John wisely didn't ask. They spoke to more victims, their families, and other people they had been in contact with. It was a horrifying litany of damaged children, damaged, families, damaged adults. But no sign of the perpetrator until the victim that Sherlock had bonded with, Phillip Rodgers, had shown up at their door early in the morning with a note. The note led them to Yorkshire, and it was there they finally came face to face with K.
"Well, I tried to tell him it was a woman who did all that, but he just kept saying 'He' about the person.  I thought it was just because my English was bad, but now I'm not sure."  John held back a snort; that sounded like Dr. Arthur all right.
"There were several things that didn't endear him to the others.  He was very intelligent, much more so than anyone else.  His marks were usually excellent although he clearly didn't pay attention in class.  He didn't try to talk to other students, except for nasty remarks.  He didn't follow any sports and said several times they were pointless.  And he had a way of knowing things about people from observing them.  There were times when he did it to deflect others, but other times he seemed to be just saying what he saw and was true."
While he thought it was certainly possible that she'd blocked out the whole experience and really had no idea who her abuser was, John thought it was more likely she knew exactly who it was and simply didn't want to tell. He tried to imagine, without success, the sort of threat hanging over her head that made telling someone such an impossible task. Then he remembered that none of the victims had talked, and that was enough to turn his stomach to ice again. "All right. I just wanted to ask," he gently said and left the room.
Of all of the things John could think of that Sherlock might have said about the situation, that was not one of them.  It was an admission that Sherlock wanted a romantic relationship, true, and a small part of him rejoiced at the idea.  That small part, however, was accompanied by horror at both the idea that John would be okay with a partner enduring rather than enjoying sex and that Sherlock was willing to subject himself to such an arrangement.  Shock must have showed on his face, because Sherlock paled and fled before John could formulate a response.  He sat down on the sofa, suddenly feeling the need to get drunk himself.
Phillip had to stop to compose himself again, and in that time someone let out a guffaw.  John looked around trying to find the idiot who'd dare laugh at something like that, but whoever it was hadn't moved.  Judge Foster scanned the crowd with narrowed eyes.  "Who was that? Who's daring to disrupt this courtroom?"  Not surprisingly, no one responded.  "Let it be known right now that if anyone disrupts this trial like that again I won't hesitate to hold them in contempt."  After one more intimidating stare, he said:  "The witness may continue."
"I know that.  Why are you doing this now?  You've never wanted to do that before, and if you have you've never mentioned it."
, by Lucy and Stephen Hawking. And yes, there really is a Hitchhiker's joke in the book. All of the description there is to drive in the Aherne family is a good one, warm and loving. Sherlock gets this right away, and knows that will make his job very much easier. He's still angry, but the personal aspect of the case doesn't overwhelm him until he meets Phillip. Right now he's still able to be a bit distant.
"And guess whose brother got a job?" Gloria took a seat right next to John, while Jason sat next to Mari. She was about his height, but much smaller, chestnut-skinned and high-cheekboned.
"I kept copies of all the starter checks, and would list whatever was lying around in the flat when I went in.  I didn't think anyone would keep a flat they didn't live in for anything good, but at the same time I didn't have any real proof Dana Lester did anything wrong."
Sherlock pulled himself into a sitting position again, this time clearly aware of what he was doing.  He reached for Hamish with his left hand.   Only when the bee was pulled to his side did he start to look around.  He looked down at the front of his pajamas like he didn't know how he'd come to be covered in vomit.  "I see," he said, although he clearly didn't.
“Are you here for a reason?” drifted up from the window.  John looked out and saw Sherlock standing in front of Phillip Rodgers, hands in his coat pockets.
John knew very well he couldn't say that wasn't true; while the reasoning was certainly flawed, he also knew Phillip had no friends at school and his mother clearly didn't care about him.  "I like you," he finally said.
"Are you saying he liked those?" All his anger melted away from Sherlock and towards Peter. He barely resisted the urge to jump out of his chair and deck him.
"Who is up at this hour?" John muttered as he threw on a dressing gown and headed for the door.  He thought it could be a homeless person, a crazy one, or a client, but when he opened the door it was none of those.  It was Phillip Rodgers.
Phillip still stared, like he was expecting the whole thing to be revealed as a joke.  "You're... my dad?" he finally managed to say.
In a minute he heard from behind the door, "You can come back in," and John entered the room again.  The pajamas had joined the blankets on the floor and the bed had been stripped of its sheets.  John picked up the bundle without saying anything and headed downstairs.  Sherlock and Hamish followed.
"I know you have, but when Susan and I brief her for testimony no one else can be here.  Lestrade's going to talk to us before she gets here; he'll be testifying much later on."  He looked John in the eye before speaking again.  "I'm not calling her Victim Two because I enjoy it, you know.  It's easier to speak to the media if I'm accustomed to referring to her as that instead of Moira Aherne."  He looked towards the door.  "It's Susan's turn to bring breakfast, so we'll get bagels and some fruit pastry with the coffee - and the cocoa for herself, of course.  She says she needs the buzz from the sweets to begin these monster trials."
John assumed Sherlock would ask what she meant by this apparent non-sequitur but he only continued to look at her.  After a minute or two of silence, he turned to Mr. Aherne.  “Do you use sugar on a daily basis?”
Lou strode to the front of the courtroom like he didn't have a care in the world.  He turned to face the spectators.  "Child abuse," he said with no leadup.  John could feel the collective shudder of the people in the room, like just hearing the words hurt.  Before they could recover he added, "Sexual abuse," and a few people gasped.  And they know what the trial's for, John thought.  "You don't want to hear that, do you?" he asked as he looked at the rest of the court.  "No one does.  Doctors never stop being shocked at a thirteen year old boy whose arm got broken by someone, or a nine year old girl with vaginal lacerations.  The police say those are the hardest cases to deal with.  So it's easy to understand why the first reaction in a case like this is disbelief.  Especially when the accused is so normal-looking, and seems like such a nice lady.  No one wants to think that an abuser is someone who we see every day, who's not some mysterious other that you can avoid."  He paused as if to let that sink in.  "But the only victims in this case that knew each other were siblings, and they all picked out the same person.  They all gave details that matched the other ones.  And they were all found in photographs.  Kelly Martin had those photographs.  And I think that once you hear from all of the victims we could find, you'll agree she was the one who assaulted them all.  Thank you."  He returned to sit next to Susan.  John glanced at the people around him and saw that many of them were wide-eyed.  Most looked dazed.  One or two of them seemed on the verge of tears.  He looked back at K and saw she was still sitting calmly, with a small smile on her face.
"She started to spend more time alone in her room.  Kieran and her have been inseparable since birth, but she wasn't playing with him at home any more."
Things reached a head when Sherlock realized that they were going out on the airfield to whatever plane they had.  The group stopped in front of a very old-looking airplane that had clearly been given several touchings-up recently.  The customer who had left them money must have left a considerable amount, and the company had been hard-up until that point; no one would not give a salary to one of the few people making the company work without financial crisis.  Carolyn, the apparent owner, seemed unlikely to spend more than she could afford; therefore the debts must have been early in the business and related to poor deals.  Either she had never run a business before or had additional difficulty from some outside source.  A divorce, most likely.
Phillip, who had been watching him throughout the whole story, laughed once or twice before looking at his hands again.  "I did tell Her, though.  I was the one that did all that and She said it was good that She loved me or She'd have the police on me.  And if She was the one that I did all of that to it would mean I wouldn't hurt anyone else."  A flush spread across his face.  "Once She said I couldn't help it, I was born with it.  At least when I grew up I'd be able to make people happy."
Jason, Tammy, and Gloria came in roughly at the same time.  "Now that everyone is here, we can get started," said Dr. Dodson.  "Who wants to begin?"
So Arthur was the one who wanted to know where his hat was, whatever that meant. "I wasn't thinking of it." He was overly friendly, but he wasn't even as big an idiot as Anderson.
Phillip nodded.  "Yeah.  A few times.  The last time I did She said She was just about to go back home and I could come with Her if I kept my eyes shut.  I went out with Her to Her car and shut my eyes until we were in Her flat.  She got me some biscuits and a glass of orange squash.  I ate that and She said we should probably ring my mum, since she'd want to know where I was.  I knew she wouldn't care, but I let Her anyway.  She rang Mum and told her that She'd found me outside and took me back to Her flat and I was behaving myself.  I don't know what Mum said to Her, but when She hung up She said She just had to bring me back for dinner."
It was only once he was standing alone outside that he realized he had no idea of what would be said during today's testimony.  He'd already known what Moira and Phillip were going to say, and while he'd never met Jennifer or Sagnik he did have an idea of what they'd gone through.  Not only had he never met Thomas Davidson, he knew nothing about him other than Lestrade's brief description.
"You can sit on my bed," she said in response, and John could hear the sound of them shuffling around.
“The Rodgers boy called him?” Lestrade asked in disbelief.  John nodded.  “Has he done this before?”
"Come and see," Sherlock replied.  John came to stand over him.  It was a periodic table, an exact copy of the one Sherlock owned.  He had already wrapped it in bubble wrap.  A large box sat waiting for it.
Even before Phillip started to respond, John knew what he would say.  He'd heard all sorts of terrible things at this point, but that still made him feel ill.  Presenting violation as some sort of
The door creaked open.  "I hope one of those is for me," Susan said as she came through the door with several cups in one hand.  She put them down on the table and sat down next to Lou.  Lou pushed one of the remaining sandwiches in front of her.  "Thank you."  She took a bite.  "The foster mother got here all right?"
Sherlock doesn't know the bee was burnt since Mycroft didn't tell him, and I think that knowledge would just make him feel worse. His feelings towards Mycroft are mixed - he knows intellectually that his brother couldn't have prevented the abuse, but he blames him for letting it go on anyway. And as is the case with Victor Trevor, he also blames him for the end of the abuse. Sherlock's feelings towards K are profoundly screwed up, and he's both afraid of her and thinks she's the only one who ever loved him, and she stopped because he did something wrong. Like grow older.
"She's the one," John said right away.  "She might have not said anything to the police, but she and Sherlock exchanged words."
She stood up, and started to put out her hand with the drive, but stopped.  "It might put you in danger."
A hundred is probably not an exaggeration. K's pattern of abuse involves children at any clinic she's worked at (ones that are vunerable for various reasons), children like Moira who are vunerable at some point and are abused for a year or two but left more delicately than the longer term ones, strange children who are vunerable in some way (often drugged to forget it) and children she pays  (or pays their parents) for sex, and the victims like Phillip and Sherlock who are abused for many years and groomed carefully. Those are meant to feel special and unique, but there's usually four or so at one time (she makes sure they never meet). Usually she loses interest once the child finishes puberty. Her plan is to insult and abuse the child at that point so much that the child is made to think she no longer wants them as a friend for something they have done. In some cases she's been impressed enough by their desperate need to have her in their lives she has been willing to take them on longer.  Phillip and Sherlock both fit in here.
"It was a few months ago.  I think it was right after the new year.  It was late in the day and Moira'd gone to the park a few hours ago and me dad said to walk down there and bring her home before she froze to death.  So I walked down there and she was sitting on one of the benches with this lady I'd never seen before.  I was going to yell at her to come home but then that woman got up to leave and kissed her."  He scowled.  "Not like how me dad kisses us, on the cheek or the forehead.  On the mouth, like you see in those silly romance movies."
"That Sherlock Holmes was so good with her." Mr. Aherne's voice was still wet with tears, but he looked like he was making an effort to cheer himself some. "He's a good man. Any time he wants to talk to Moira again I'll let him. No wonder the Yard calls on him so often." John and Lestrade shared a glance, but were both able to refrain from bursting into laughter.
"No, I wasn't planning on ever playing the saxophone.  It seemed complicated," he admitted.  "Why did you pick the flute?"
“I would like to speak to the father of the girl taken into care.”  His eyes briefly scanned the room before focusing again on his chest.
"My little wall of the people I've helped." The sound of Lou's voice almost made John jump in his seat. "I keep up the most recent cases. The Davidson picture is the most recent. They're living in a real flat now."
As soon as Clark sat down, Lou walked up to the bench.  "The prosecution calls Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena."  The usher came in leading a girl John recognized from the photograph he'd seen months ago.  She wore a lavender dress with matching ribbons on her braids, and carried a rag doll with her.  The court seemed to gasp collectively as she sat down.  John understood why; while the other victims had all been older children, Jennifer was clearly still a little girl.  Hearing someone like Phillip testify about something that had happened when he was small wasn't the same as seeing a child of that age testifying to the same thing.  She was a representation of how young the victims had been.
“Correct.  Most random numbers are not random at all.  They can appear to be randomly generated, but they are pseudo-random.  There are only a few sources of random content in the world, and they are all from quantum events, such as radioactive decay.  Since this group has to stay under the radar, they can’t even use true random number generators online, in case someone logs the use of them.  So their transmissions are most likely randomized through a computer program, which will give them the code to use.”
As the audience filed out once more, John noticed that most of them appeared to be in a state of shock.  Whoever had laughed before certainly wasn’t laughing now.  In fact, no one appeared to be speaking at all.  He waited in silence with the rest of them and when the time was up filed back into court with the rest of them.
It was only then he began to think about how this Sherlock was doing with the MJN crew.  Arthur loved everyone (except maybe his dad), so he'd be cheerful regardless, but he didn't imagine Douglas and Carolyn would be pleased with someone who couldn't fly a plane.  He wondered if Sherlock was as desperate to get home as he was.  From what little he'd seen, and how John had immediately known that he was someone else, he suspected that he was quite a different personality than a certain Martin Crieff.
He went up to his room, rummaged around in his closet, and took out jeans, a jumper, a shirt, pants, and socks.  All were old but otherwise in good shape.  He then went downstairs and folded up the clothes beside the bathroom door.  "There are clothes for you outside the door," he told Phillip, and then went to the kitchen.  Sherlock was already in there heating up some water.
"Is this your boyfriend?" K went on in a cheerful voice.  "I wouldn't have suspected that, you know.  You were always so enthusiastic.  Was it just that no other woman could compare?"
"I, um, looked at Her."  He paused.  "Then She asked me if I'd ever seen a woman without clothes before.  I said no.  She said it was normal to be interested and I could look at Her all I wanted."
"Did you ever protest to your mother you didn't want to go there?  Did you ever say anything to her about it?"
“Sherlock?” he said quietly.  If he could wake him up before it got too bad he might just fall back asleep and not even remember that he’d had a dream.  (He hoped that was the case and that Sherlock wasn’t just choosing to push it out of his head.)  He switched on a bedside light.
"Do you know why you're in hospital, Moira?" John tried to sound nonchalant, like he was only asking about the weather.
Peter shook his head. "Married. For a year and a half now." He looked at Dr. Dodson. "She told me therapy is going well."
"First K's solicitors will ask you questions of their own."  Before Sherlock could continue he was interrupted.
"No, for a lot of reasons.  All the officers they sent in to talk to her were women.  The one time they did send a man in to talk to her, he was a doctor, which wasn't any better."
"It may be easier on all the involved parties if she is merely taken into custody by the government.  No trial involved."  He continued to look at John even as Sherlock shot daggers out his eyes at him.
He gave John a grave look. "I got advance notice. Tomorrow there's going to be a story in the Sun and a few of the other tabloids. One of the jurors decided to talk."
"Twins, I take it,” Sherlock said, not asking a question but rather stating a fact.  "They're from Nigeria?"
Once again Sherlock's confidence vanished.  "Phillip had given me a receipt from a supermarket.  He had gotten it from Her purse and he realized it could be used to locate Her primary residence."  He at least seemed to understand he could now refer to victims by name.
"I'm a citizen and I was born here, but my mother's family is still in India and as a result I've spent a great deal of time there as well."
As soon as he woke up, he saw Sherlock in the corner of his eye, sitting up, making no effort to get up.  "I'll take a shower first," John said to break the silence.  "You can get out your clothes and put them on the bed."  He suspected that Sherlock was just as overwhelmed as he was yesterday, and needed directions.
"I know you're taking this very personally, but that just means you have to do this right.  You want to connect the dots so K is in jail for a long time."
"Yes, you're a very brave girl."  He smiled at her.  "Sometimes people are too afraid to talk about being hurt." John wondered if Sherlock meant himself.
John thought suddenly of the "helper" comment K had made and felt a horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach.  "Well, I am.  Finish your tea."  Sherlock put both of his shaking hands on the mug and drank the rest of it in one long gulp.  He was still looking at John and wasn't curled up on himself again, and at that moment it became all too much for John to handle.  "Give me ten minutes to go upstairs.  I'll be back after that and we'll talk some more," he made himself say.  Sherlock nodded silently, his eyes suddenly very large.  That was enough to propel John up the steps and into his room, where he shut the door and finally allowed himself to cry.
Moira went even more rigid, if such a thing were possible.  Her eyes widened.  After a moment of silence she whispered: "The park near our flat with the play yard."
Lou clearly found her repeated use of the word disconcerting, but he managed to keep his voice even.  "What happened when you got in there?"
Phillip slumped in his chair more before responding.  "A lot of times.  For the next few years She'd pick me up and take me to the flat a few times a week.  Sometimes we'd meet at the park and sometimes She'd get me from school.  Mum never picked me up there so I had to walk home.  Mum did ask Her once if I was annoying Her and She said I was behaving myself."
"That he knew I was shy and it'd just take some time. He asked if they were teasing me and I said no because they really weren't.  The other kids just ignored me."
He almost couldn't blame him for fleeing. "I think it might be best if I don't head into work today."
He suddenly stopped struggling, arms and legs going limp.  It didn't look like he'd come out of it, as he was still saying under his breath, "Stop stop stop stop stop..."
"My turn, then," Kieran said.  Without waiting for Sherlock or John to say anything, he launched into his story.  "When Moira picked that woman out of the lineup, I knew who she was going to pick.  I'd seen her before."
Mrs. Murray gave him an annoyed look and said: "No, I said before there were several others.  They all left after a few months, though.  Dana Lester stayed and stayed."
Before John could say any more, she interrupted him.  "Don't call it 'having sex.'  That trivializes it.  'When she was abusing him sexually' is more accurate."
Sherlock reached out one shaking hand and reached for the sugar spoon.  He placed sugar in the mug (some of it winding up on the floor and table) and brought the mug up for a sip.  Without thinking, John reached out his hand and was about to put it on Sherlock's shoulder, but he suddenly flinched and John withdrew.  "I'm not going to hate you for anything you tell me," John said.
"He's so squirmy that I thought it might be better for him to be able to wander a bit.  Martin's very good with him," explained Gloria.
There was tea, and he sipped it, not looking at John at all. Drinks always seemed less horrible than food, smoother and thinner. If he drank enough tea maybe John wouldn't notice him not eating. No, he was still preoccupied by something. He'd been to his group, so maybe something had happened there. Ordinarily Sherlock knew he could have figured more out, but right now he wanted to get away from the food on the table, and if John kept thinking about something else it would be helpful for that. He made himself eat a few bites of the risotto, had a full cup of tea, and then fled the table.
They didn't speak any more that night, but when John got up in the middle of the night to get himself a drink, he could see Sherlock sitting by the window, staring out over the city. John didn't ask what he was doing or what he was thinking, because he was starting to realize there was a great deal he didn't know about Sherlock. He was so angry and determined about this case. He seemed to know exactly what to say to Moira and what she felt. This was creating a disturbing picture, but he only had vague remarks to go with. And he wasn't sure if he wanted to find out about more of it.
"You neglected to mention that the admitting doctor said outright he suspected you had abused your daughter."  Harvey grinned like this was her ultimate trump card.
"A few times when the weather was nice we'd stay there but we usually went to a flat nearby.  I thought it was where She lived but She said once it belonged to a friend.  Sometimes I got biscuits and ice creams.  If Rory was with me when I went to the park we'd stay there.  Then we'd just go in the bathrooms.  Sometimes I'd walk Rory home and come back after."
Susan started to walk up the steps again.  John followed her.  As she walked she began to speak again.  "Well, today we have Victim Five, Victim Four, and Victim Four's mother.  If all goes well tomorrow we'll have Victim Four's father, Victim Four's former foster mother, and Mrs. Murray the landlady.  Thursday will be Victim Ten and his parents. Friday will be Victim Six, Victim Eight, and their mother's cousin.  Monday should be Victim Fifteen and the current foster carer of Victims Fourteen and Fifteen.  Tuesday is Victim Thirteen, Victim Eleven, and Victim Twelve. So after the officer who arrested Victim Twelve testifies on Wednesday, he'll be up."
Sherlock gave Lestrade his typical "you're an idiot" look.  "Do remember that he had to keep his eyes shut the whole time.  K could have driven in circles for who knows how long and Phillip wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Furthermore, the park where this boy was left is the same one Moira met K at, if his description is accurate."
Whatever else Lestrade was going to say was lost, as at that moment Mr. Aherne walked into the room.  His face was unnaturally white and his eyes were reddened, but when he spoke his obvious distress didn't show.  "The bread's out of the oven and I'm going to start supper now.  Kieran, it's your job to peel the potatoes.  Moira, you'll peel the carrots.  The roast’s already in the oven."   Both of the children got up and passed by Lestrade as they went through the door, their father behind.  That was what seemed to snap Sherlock out of his reverie; he turned off the tape recorder that was still sitting on the bed, picked it up with his free hand, and headed out the door.
"Right before I left for uni I realized I didn't really need it, so I gave it and a bunch of other toys to charity."  John hadn't thought about that toy in years.  "Not that everyone does.  Harry's still got the lamb she had as a kid.  She's said she's going to be buried with it."
Even if all this was the case, he reminded himself, there was no way to approach it. Whether it was because his one attempt to describe what had been happening to him was so disastrous or because he was reticent by nature, Sherlock wasn't going to talk about it. He never talked about himself to begin with – hell, John hadn't known until recently that both his parents were dead or that he had never really known his father. There was no casual way to bring anything like that up in conversation, anyway. John also knew if he just bit the bullet and asked something like "So, that person you were 'telling horrible lies' about, can you tell me about him?" he would be met with stony silence.
I started this as an anon on the kink meme and wasn't sure I'd de-anon, or that I'd finish it. I certainly didn't know that this was going to be over a hundred thousand words and fifty chapters of angst, but the story took hold of me and didn't let go.
Sherlock finally stopped in front of a long walkway leading to a large sprawling house.  The grounds looked well tended, the driveway and the walkway were both in good condition, and the house looked cheerful.  It seemed to be the last place you'd look for a criminal like K.  He looked briefly at the paper in his hands before heading down to the house.  John, after sending one last text that named the street and house number, headed there himself.  Just before he got to the door, Sherlock spun around and stared back at John.  "How long have you been following me?" he asked.
He went into the bathroom, took off his clothes, and turned the shower on as cold as it would get. A few minutes of that, and he could get out and dress again. As he dressed, his mind drifted to Victor again. Before he could think another
John felt very glad that Mycroft summoned him shortly after he woke up.  It was another terse text message:  “Leave in fifteen minutes and you will be picked up.”  At fifteen minutes to the dot, he left Baker Street and got into the waiting car.  Mycroft wasn’t in it, but the driver took him to a nondescript office building.  “Vernet,” said the man before letting him out.  John was bewildered until he went into the building, where several buzzers lined the entranceway.  One did indeed say “Vernet” and when he pressed it, a minute later Mycroft’s assistant came out of the lift.  She beckoned for him to follow her, and he did, not bothering to make conversation or even ask what name she was using now.
"Jordan Ping Yu.  Ginger too, but he's also part Chinese.  Big hazel eyes.  His story's a little like Moira Aherne's.  Moved here from the States.  His mother's out of the picture and dad works a lot.   He went to Bart's about ten years ago for a physical shortly after they entered the country, and I think you can guess who the doctor was.  He told us they 'had a relationship' - his words, not mine - until he and his father moved to Hong Kong two years later.  He's nineteen now, and he came here to visit a relative of his father's two months ago.  Saw some of the media coverage of the case and rang us the same day."  Lestrade sounded a lot less hassled relating Jordan's story.  No doubt this was because he was another stranger to all of them.  "Victims Fourteen and Fifteen are siblings, Omowunmi and Isiaka Ehiwenma."
One of the things I felt the need to balance in the story was Sherlock's personal feelings in regards to the case in contrast with his more detached crime-solving nature. This is probably most present in the trial scene with him, but this is where the contrast starts. If he thinks of it as "just another case" he can work more effectively, but at the same time the victims (especially Phillip) stir a lot of emotion that he can't brush away. It's sort of a form of disassociation, but since I don't use that term often in the story he can seem almost chameleon-like.
Sherlock let out a loud sigh and picked the laptop up.  "I want to see the year when the city of Agra was founded."
John led the way into the clinic, hoping Sarah would know where Dr. Arthur had decided to wait for them.  She spotted him before he saw her, and waved to him.  She ducked into an examination room and John followed, Sherlock trailing silently behind.  "Thank you for getting here, John.  If I have to hear that man tell one more idiotic 'joke' I'll be part of your next murder investigation."  She raised her eyes to the ceiling.  "I hope he gives you some good information, but mind you he can be very certain about things, no matter the facts.  I remember when a well-known child psychologist was due to give a lecture here, Dr. Tracy Newsome, and Dr. Arthur kept going on about how he wanted to talk to him.  Bit of a shock when he was face to face with Dr. Tracy Alice Newsome," she added, clearly amused by the memory.  "Anyway, he's in the conference room on the second floor.  You know where that is."
Clearly their respective current positions didn’t hide much. “You’re… not exactly dead,” John countered. “Very much alive, as a matter of fact.”
A normal day at the clinic got cut short when the power went out and Sarah sent him home early, so John arrived back to the flat earlier than usual. He walked in on Sherlock kissing himself, nude, in the middle of the sitting room.
He could be practical first, though. Sherlock barely twitched when John stood and went to dig out a flannel from the bathroom cupboard. The feel of the damp cloth on his abdomen prompted a mumble that might have expressed gratitude, but otherwise Sherlock was still too blissed-out to care that he might have just thanked his flatmate verbally for the first time in… well, ever, probably.
of fingernails on your scalp makes your eyes roll back in your head. I suspect a fingernail run up the back of your neck would give you goose pimples all over. You’re exquisitely sensitive, aren’t you?”
“But you don’t mind seeing my penis, even though nudity is socially discouraged in the UK.” Sherlock looked legitimately perplexed. “Is it because we’re not genetically related to each other? Or because you have the same genitalia I do?”
It wasn’t the first time Sherlock had swanned off a scene with his Belstaff swirling around him before John had even said a single word, but somehow it never got any easier. John shot Lestrade an apologetic little smile and chased off after Sherlock.
Sherlock huffed. “She was an exotic dancer, John. She’s seen plenty of--ah. Wait. You truly aren’t bothered?”
Fuck.” John wriggled downwards, lining himself up, and slid his aching cock between Sherlock’s thighs. On the second thrust, Sherlock moaned too. John immediately slid his slick hand back into its previous position under Sherlock’s cockhead and made a tunnel with his fingers.
John put a pin in that observation and went back to looking at the evidence overall. The victim’s hair was short, oddly so, in an uneven mess which John had a hard time believing could have been an intentional style even before the struggle and the murder. Without touching or moving the body it was hard to tell for sure, but it looked like there may have been a contusion on the back of the skull--not from hitting the pavement, obviously not here (not enough blood), but perimortem perhaps? Sherlock would probably know the distance the victim traveled from the primary scene, but John couldn’t say more than that this alley wasn’t it.
They stayed there, slumped and sated, for several minutes. John felt like he had no bones left in his body but he still couldn’t tear his gaze away from post-coital Sherlock. Or Sherlocks, plural. One was staring at the ceiling and breathing heavily while the other sprawled across the coffee table and left visible smears of semen on the surface.
--so many discrete parts, nicely separable for diagrams in books but all jumbled into one big blob to make a person. And most of those discrete parts are absolutely vital for the functioning of the whole. Somehow this hodgepodge of organs and cell tissue has the ability to think, to learn, to react… how could I
It took a moment to regain his balance after his legs and back had been blissed into submission, but John managed to sit with the sheet piled in his lap. Sherlock prowled around him twice, muttering to himself. Once he reached out to press down gently on both of John’s shoulders, and a second time to graze the sizes of John’s ribcage and correct his sitting posture.
John jolted awake. It took a moment to get his bearings - Sherlock’s bed, full daylight filtering through the window in odd ways it never attempted in his own bedroom, and a nude consulting detective staring down at him from less than six inches away. No: not nude. Sherlock was wearing boxers and a blush.
John toed off his shoes, then swung a leg over Sherlock’s prone form so he was kneeling over Sherlock’s long legs. The dress technically covered all of Sherlock’s bits and a few inches further, but the view was no less sexy for it. The hint of black knickers showing through the thin fabric made the sight that much more tempting.
Interestingly, both Sherlocks’ cocks--which had been barely at half-mast--twitched at the same time. “I think I find that arousing,” one of them said. The other made a note in the experiment book.
John raised an eyebrow. “Not like you to pass on a chance to stomp all over the chain of evidence and collect samples yourself. Turning over a new leaf?”
About five seconds after Sherlock had folded the sheet down to John’s waist and started in on his lower back, John knew he was in trouble. The man’s fingers were like ten individual miracles come down from heaven to relieve tension he hadn’t even known he’d been carrying. He couldn’t muffle a near-orgasmic moan, then immediately cringed at how wanton it sounded.
“You astound me, John,” Sherlock said quietly. “How do you always have another layer I’d never noticed before?”
“And I,” Sherlock said as he pushed off the wall and prowled closer, “am overjoyed that you are not an idiot. Kick off the sheet, John.”
“You will be again once we get your tremor and your limp sorted. Hold your breath for me. In… and out. In… and out. Again.” Sherlock braced a palm against the nape of John’s neck on each
“You should know that I’m already about ten seconds away from going off, simply from feeling how hard you are for me,” John admitted. “I haven’t even got my trousers off yet. But I’m going to focus on you first.” He carefully coated the head of Sherlock’s cock in lube - only the head - and started massaging it with his thumb and one fingertip. The rest of his fingers kept brushing up against lace and satin every time he moved his hand, and it felt incredible. “Have you ever had intercrural sex, Sherlock?”
“I knew that was going to happen soon,” the sole remaining Sherlock said sheepishly. “Excuse me a moment--I need to clone myself again.”
He couldn’t possibly see the contents of the drawer with his head still touching John’s pillow, but he unerringly plucked the small pump-top bottle from behind all the other decoy detritus and passed it back over his shoulder. He’d snooped at least once, then. It was hard to summon up the proper outrage when presented with such a visual feast… John slicked up just his thumb and forefinger, then snaked his hand under Sherlock’s lean stomach. He followed the lace by touch until he encountered a lovely fat knob straining well past the length the knickers would have been able to contain it.
“Does it make you uncomfortable to learn that I’m not as straight as you thought?” It would kill him to face Sherlock’s censure, if so, but John had gotten used to pickled body parts in the fridge and mold samples in the loo. Sherlock could bloody well get used to the idea of John occasionally liking his partners--female or not--to have a dick.
“I’d rate it a three,” the Sherlock with the book said without looking up. “Having your tongue in my mouth feels odd. Two tongues don’t fit in my oral cavity as well, even if they’re both technically mine.”
He knelt again over Sherlock’s legs, got both hands thoroughly slippery, and set about slicking up the inside of the lean, muscular thighs he was already drooling over.
“Finally,” Sherlock declared, setting down his own barely-touched cup. “Now. Impossible to say whether the victim and the killer were at her place or his, but given the probable paring knife and the alley where the body was found, they were almost certainly on the tail end of their date.”
The Sherlocks exchanged a glance with each other. “Prior experience may affect the data,” one finally said, “but I’m still interested in the results.”
John had to blink a moment before he regained his powers of speech. “Mostly numb over my pectoral,” he admitted. “It’s the exit wound that’s been giving me the most trouble.”
“That was, perhaps, a bit less of a controlled fall than I intended,” he grumbled. “But fine, assume the contusion happened accidentally. It’s difficult to regain one’s balance in these shoes. I am now deceased, or will shortly bleed out.” He lay back onto the floor and assumed an awkward sprawl. “Head wounds bleed excessively, even when not fatal, so what do you do now?”
Sherlock glanced up at the clock on the wall. “Plan on… hmm, around five-thirty, then. Your shoulder feels better, I assume?”
There were some disadvantages to being bisexual, and never being able to predict when surprise hard-ons might appear was one of them.
“I’d know a damn sight better than you,” John countered. “Exactly how many women have you undressed?”
The next several weeks were among the strangest John had ever experienced, even after serving in Afghanistan, getting shot at, and living with Sherlock Holmes for nearly three years. Often one Sherlock was asleep on the sofa while the other typed furiously at his laptop. Other times, both Sherlocks followed him around observing him like he was an exhibit at the zoo. John started spending a lot of time in his room with the door closed. London’s criminals were unfortunately behaving themselves, meaning Sherlock only got to solve two cases with himself--one of which involved John doing most of the legwork anyway. Somehow Sherlock managed to keep the existence of his clone from everyone except Mycroft and John. Mycroft because he was probably damn near omniscient, and him because… John wasn’t entirely sure. Unavoidable exposure? Simply too lazy to bother hiding? He certainly wasn’t asked to participate in any of Sherlock’s new experiments.
“I…” Sherlock swallowed hard. “The ways I want to touch you are only ‘cuddling’ in the vaguest sense of the word,” he said. “Just fantasies, of course, but…”
remember. Being literally knocked off my feet by this compact ball of angry, competent soldier, who held me down without a word and proceeded to completely ignore my surprised gibbering while he scanned for further danger. You were lying on my lower half and supported yourself by one hand on my sternum while you looked around, but the reason I couldn’t move was because the arousal I felt in that moment was strong enough to overpower everything else. I felt
“Tell me if I’m doing something you don’t like,” John declared, and slowly slid both hands up under the hem of the dress to cup Sherlock’s gluteal muscles. “Because I want everything. Not all at once, not all today, but eventually. And you look tempting as hell right now.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, then sauntered over to the desk and dramatically clocked his hip on the corner. John was on his feet and extending an arm in an instant, but Sherlock was already on the floor and rubbing his elbow.
“For the record, I wouldn’t object to you doing something about that, either. As long as you don’t leave spunk all over the flat for me to clean up.”
John cracked an eye open and looked over his massage therapist again. Sherlock was thin but deceptively strong. His white t-shirt fit him obscenely well. His hair was the kind of perfection that probably meant the man spent hours to make it look like he spent no time at all, and it suited him. He was currently focused entirely on John’s left calf muscle, rolling it with a brilliant up-and-down motion which nearly had John moaning with pleasure.
“By the way,” the other Sherlock said, “if you’re about to use the loo, try not to touch the apparatus in the bathtub. It’s calibrated for my genetic signature, not yours.”
His tone implied John was unique in that regard. John fought back a flush of pride. “That’s what best friends are like, I suppose. You see parts of each other you’d never show to anyone else.”
“Lift your bum up higher, Sherlock,” the one John was sucking panted. “I want to finger your arse. My arse. Fuck.”
“Fellatio, by definition, requires the receiving participant to have a penis,” Sherlock said. “You’ve performed cunnilingus.”
John was shucking his jumper and unbuttoning his shirt even before Sherlock was done talking. He shrugged it off, leaving himself a plain white undervest and his jeans. The scar was an ugly one, mangled tissue spreading over most of his pectoral with tendrils curling over his clavicle and peeking out past the vest’s low collar, but the immediate gasp from Sherlock made the reveal worth it.
“Mmmm, ‘sfine.” Sherlock ended up sprawled face-down, the ruined dress draped over his back and arse like a particularly discommodious cape. It was going to be in the way. Already was, John mused, as Sherlock arched his spine and the merits of his arse became even more difficult than usual to ignore.
Strongly suspected, anyway. Sherlock had entirely too many expensive hair products for a heterosexual man who couldn’t care less about his transport. “
“Relax,” Sherlock murmured, leaning forward with a hungry look. “I’m going to do all the work.” And then he sucked the head of John’s prick into his mouth.
John found himself having to actually put some thought into the answer. Harry had hugged him when he first got back, but that might have been it since prior to when his unit walked into that ambush. There’d always been contact with patients, back when he was still useful to the RAMC, but that was only incidental. Despite being in a war zone, he and his fellow doctors had treated a lot more colds, fevers, and STDs than they did bullet wounds. Seeing how many soldiers mysteriously came down with the clap after getting time off base had done wonders for keeping John’s libido in check while deployed.
“Also given a blow job or two, though.” John shrugged. “I’ve always had adventurous friends. Some of whom were excellent tutors.”
Sherlock cocked his head, considering. “It would certainly save us a step,” he decided. “Fine. We’ll start with the easy one, then: when did you discover or decide you were asexual?”
“I didn’t know I had a kink for me in lingerie either,” Sherlock mumbled, voice distorted by how he had his forehead pressed into the pillow. “But it’s going to make intercourse impossible, so it needs to come off.”
was, but then the kneeling Sherlock got his lips around John's prick again and gave a particularly powerful suck. John copied the motion to his own fellate-ee and was treated to the most pornographic noise he’d ever heard his flatmate make. It was followed a second later by a gasp and then a flood of semen overflowing his mouth. John coughed.
attention, specifically. And I’m afraid I might be a high-maintenance partner - especially now that I know how well you wield your genitalia.”
“Nope--I meant my sister. Harry stayed with me for two weeks after her first stint in rehab, my last year in uni. Among her other annoying habits, she kept taking off her damn shirt because the ventilation in my flat was crap and that summer was particularly sweltering.” John shuddered. “I won’t say that’s the
“Fuck,” John breathed. “Even though I’ve just come, I might very well go back to my flat and do the same. Thinking about what you’re doing somewhere else in London at the exact same time.”
“You wouldn’t know,” Sherlock said. “Every time you’ve seen a woman in her knickers there was a man present, obviously. You. Although it speaks well for your carnal prowess that they continued to attempt to entice you even after the first sexual encounter. Bravo.”
“So, um.” John cleared his throat. “You’d be bleeding all over the place, including on me. Definitely on the floor. I think it’s safe to say your dress would be ruined--the bra too, probably. Maybe not skirt or knickers, depending on how you fell. The only way I can see getting you out of your clothes is holding you upright in my lap like this. Wouldn’t work as well if your skirt were longer, but…” He hitched Sherlock up from the ground for a moment, tugging the hem of the pale blue sundress out from under his arse before lowering him again. Sherlock was letting his body go completely limp, which left the back of his head lolling on John’s shoulder and his breath delicately fanning John’s ear. “That’s the first step, then.”
“Is that something Lestrade can have his people check? You don’t have a, what, nail salon index in that brain of yours?”
Sherlock turned a rather adorable shade of pink, the blush spreading all the way down his pale chest. “Apparently,” he muttered. “I’ve not done this before.”
“Just to clarify,” John said, “because I want to make sure I have this right. You can’t figure me out in one go so you’re attracted to me. Romantically and/or sexually. And you want to… what?”
Sherlock nodded. “I suspect it was unintentional, but without moving her body or viewing the actual scene of her death it’s difficult to determine whether the blow was the result of a true accident or whether it came about as part of an assault.”
John barked out a laugh. “Since when have you known me to be polite? When it’s just the two of us, anyway?”
“Your bed, then. You’re bloody tall.” John lay on the duvet, stripped off his vest, and arranged Sherlock to lie on top of him. Sherlock’s legs were probably overhanging the footboard, but his head fit perfectly on John’s bare chest and that was the important part. Sherlock summoned up the strength to squeeze John’s waist and then go boneless again.
John chuckled, but he did stand up long enough to ditch his only-slightly-sticky trousers and pants. His sheets were probably already a lost cause and were about to get a lot messier.
“Excellent. Fuck, you already feel amazing.” John spread the lube as quickly as thoroughly as possible. “Tighten your--
have some qualified lab technicians at his disposal. He’ll text me when more information about our mystery woman is available. If Anderson doesn’t muck up the data collection first, that is.”
on the fairer sex, but some women like wearing nice underthings because they just want to. Not to impress a man.”
“Delectable,” Sherlock declared, crispy snapping the consonants in the word. He leaned in, running the tip of his nose along John’s carotid. “I’m going to take them off you now. Yes?”
She and her date did whatever simple-minded people do on dates--dinner and the cinema, perhaps. They came back to one or the other’s flat with the intention of sexual intercourse. The victim acquired the contusion on the back of her head, which might have been accidental or might have been intentional. Her date panicked.”
“Right.” John studied his mad, beautiful flatmate for a long moment. “So from an aesthetic standpoint, I love your combination of pale skin and dark hair. I would expect dark body hair to show up more but you’re not a naturally hirsute man, are you?”
“Nope.” John slid his palms higher, cupping the round curves of Sherlock’s lace-covered arse. “That sounds to me like a challenge. We’re good at tackling challenges. I bet I can get us both off just like this.”
He did. The knife wound was terribly obvious, but there was something odd about it. Smallish wound, considering… the angle was off, maybe? John ignored it for the time being and tried to picture himself in Sherlock’s head (not that anyone except Sherlock could
, a daily account of John's blog from March onward - I originally thought it would take a month, but I capped it off at 200 days because I was running out of fluff :-) I honestly don't know when the last time I've written for 200 consecutive days was. It's been a lovely antidote to 2020.
“That’s precisely why I don’t take offense when you’re a knob-end about ignoring me.” No new emails, dammit. They were both spoiling for a case, no matter how minor. “As long as you practice good personal hygiene and restrict your bare arse to contact with only your chair and the sofa, I don’t really care. Both are leather and I disinfect them regularly. If you scandalize Mrs. Hudson, that’s your problem.”
You’re damn well beautiful, and you know it. I’m not blind. Living in 221B with you parading around nude all the time is like scoring a flat in the Louvre.”
“You damn well were,” John growled. “The hell if I’m going to allow some two-bit thug to shoot my Sherlock.”
John still hesitated. “You realize asking me to strip you naked and haul you off to a dirty alley isn’t generally a thing flatmates
Lestrade cleared his throat, which he always did before having to break up Sherlock and Anderson’s verbal sparring matches. “Half right--you mean to say he wasn’t stabbed?” he asked. “Sherlock, there’s a great bloody hole in his chest!”
“Welcome,” a deep baritone voice said. John turned around and blinked, because the man at the door had nothing except his profession in common with the petite blonde woman John had been subjected to thus far. Army pensions didn’t cover much, but the official recommended therapist had done diddly squat in helping John to regain motion in his shoulder after he was sent home from Afghanistan. This bloke looked like he’d have no problem pummeling John’s tense muscles into submission.
surprising, giving Sherlock’s show-off streak. And he did have a beautiful cock--thick and long, now that it was fully erect, jutting insistently out of his dark thatch of pubic hair. Sherlock stroked it slowly. John wasn’t hard but he also wasn’t naive: the man certainly had something worth showing off. “Do you like that I’m watching?” he asked suddenly.
“Mascara, blush, plush matte lipstick in ‘Freckle Fiesta,’ as if that were an actual color, and a touch of neutral-tone eyeshadow. You could see the remains of it around the victim’s superior palpebral fold. I need to determine whether her killer wiped her makeup off her face or whether she did it herself sometime prior to her death.”
