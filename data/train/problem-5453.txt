“Squirrel.” Crowley’s slick tone rolled through the room, an air of distraction so convincing that Dean nearly believed it. Had he not been there the last time he had seen Crowley, he would have even believed it. But he knew better. “I knew that you would get tired of that moose of a brother of yours, given the time. But I’m surprised that it was this quickly.”
“He agreed to try it my way. I don’t want a cure, Cas. I’m better this way.” Dean tried to speak both through words and with his eyes, pleading for Cas to get it and release him. The angel definitely looked unconvinced, however.
“I was just regaling our dear Moose here with some stories of your new adventures these past weeks. Explaining your true nature.” Crowley punctuated the word with another blow to Sam’s torso, breaking several ribs in the process. Sam struggled to pull in oxygen, as he begged with his eyes Dean to come to his rescue. But Dean made no move to stop Crowley’s abuse, staring lazily at the scene before him. “Care to give him a demonstration?” Crowley’s evil grin was met with a flash of black eyes and a devilish smirk from Dean. Sam knew he only had moments left on this earth.
He focused and brought the image into a clearer picture in his mind, cursing as he saw a devilish grin on lips that he knew too well.
Dean cut Baby’s engine as soon as he could. He usually controlled himself, taking all the steps he needed to do things the normal way, but he was just so damned happy to see the girl he counted as his sister that he opted for the quicker, more demony route. He teleported to her side, pulling her into a hug.
Sam sighed in a mix of frustration and weariness, wondering just what had brought them both here. How could it have come to this? He was hunting his brother, for God’s sake. He just couldn’t wrap his head around the feeling. It had always been the two of them against the world. Now it felt like the world had taken his brother and left him to drown.
“Demon or not, would I hurt my brother, Cas?” Dean interrupted and he felt his anger spike just a tad, and he couldn’t control his eyes. He felt Cas flinch and took his chance. He shifted his weight, rolling them across the wall, switching their positions so that he now had Cas pressed against the wall, angel blade remaining at his throat. He stared hard into the blue eyes he trusted so much, trying to find his friend there. “I don’t care if I become the damned Easter Bunny, Cas. You can’t honestly believe that I would hurt Sam. You have to know me better than that.” Dean held his ground and waited. He kept himself pressed hard against Cas, his hand still tight on the bottle in his hand, while he noticed for the first time that Cas held his other above his head, now just suspended in the air with no wall to brace it against.
they’re killing themselves or others.”
He headed toward the lot where he had left Baby parked, whispering to a brother who couldn’t hear him, “Let’s go home.”
. There she sat in all her beauty, pristine as the last time he had gazed upon her. Cas was not even concerned that it could be a look-alike - Baby possessed unique energy about her that Cas could not describe. He theorized that it came from all the years of love Dean, like his father before him, had given to her. Cas just stood there, ignoring everything around him, wondering where she had been these past weeks. Baby had disappeared the same night that Dean’s body had.
Charlie laughed, “No, nothing like that. I just wondered what has kept you and Cas apart this whole time.”
“Yeah, he did, and it was. You good already?”
It wasn’t the voice of the King of Hell that shocked Dean as he began to take in his surroundings; it was the mere fact that Dean in no uncertain terms could
He cried.
Dean’s face turned confused for just a moment before realization struck in the form of Aphrodite’s free hand as it plunged straight through Dean’s chest and out his back, his heart in her hand.
Sam let out a half-hearted chuckle to mask his pain. “Not one to soften the blow, are ya, Cas,” Sam waved his hand dismissively as Cas attempted a response. Squaring his shoulders, he proceeded, “Did you find the demon joy-riding around in her?”
“A new demon?” Sam’s eyes jumped to Cas, a sudden clarity in them that Cas found unnerving. “So it’s not my brother in there?” Cas could have wept at the blind hope he saw in Sam’s eyes. It almost broke his resolve to have to be the one to take that hope away.
He leaned against the counter, letting his new life wash over him fully for the first time since his brother passed. He pulled the phone from his pocket, reading the date on the display. Forty-three. That was the number of days his brother had been dead. Forty-three days that Sam had been alone in this world. Dean should have been long buried by now. He would have been, had Sam been strong enough to stay sober and find his body.
But most of all, he missed Sam and Cas. Even though they were still alive as far as he knew, they might as well be worlds away. It wasn’t as if he could go back now. What would he even be able to say once he waltzed back into the bunker, back from the dead and soul blacker than soot? Somehow, he found Crowley and the dive bar scene much easier to handle. Sure, the food sucked and the music was both kinds, Country and Western, but at least the women hadn’t been half-bad. But they never quite filled the hole his two best mates had left. Dean knew Sam would never be able to understand this new state that he was in. It just wasn’t worth the heartache.
Dean’s voice slid smoothly through the air as he began acapella in his rendition of Styx’s
“What do we have here?” Dean’s voice was a tone Sam didn’t recognize, a cold and disconnected emptiness that shook him to his core. The karaoke had filled him with a hope he hadn’t admitted he held, but that was gone now, burned away by the body standing before him. He resigned himself to the fact that he was about to die. His brother was not standing before him. There was only a demon set to kill.
“Sam!” Cas cut Sam off before he could ride the crazy train any further. His tone must have done the trick; Sam sat back down, though his eyes still troubled the angel. “Of all the souls I have encountered during my time here on Earth, I would know both of the Winchester brothers anywhere.” They were his only true friends, upon the Earth or otherwise. “The soul I looked upon may have been tainted and charred black by The Mark, but it was definitely Dean.” Cas tried to convey his sympathy and sorrow to Sam. He knew this would be a devastating revelation for Sam to process, as he too felt the same grief.
The man hung his head as he left the stage, which Sam realized held the band he had heard earlier, playing backup for the poor souls who tried to perform for the drunks in the crowd. Sam had been so wrapped up in Dean that he hadn’t even noticed the band when he first arrived. He shook his head, trying his damnedest to get it back in the game.
Six beers later and too many pages, Cas made a small grunt that caught their attention. He looked up briefly before relaying the text below his fingertips. “I believe we might be dealing with a goddess. Aphrodite has been written to have forced untold secrets and feelings out into the open. Many times these tales depict it as an act to bring lovers together, however, there are depictions that have darker tones and endings.”
Crowley didn’t immediately respond and Dean almost gave in to the pressure. He wasn’t sure whether breaking his facade would mean beating the hell out of the demon before him or begging for his help. It could go either way, he knew. In moments like these, Dean wished he could somehow tap back into the Mark and use its strength to push forward.
“I am much improved, Sam.” Cas slipped off the table, looking at the brothers for a moment. Sam’s concern seemed to be waning, but Dean seemed almost taken aback by the change. Cas tried to control the concern and frustration he felt, but he found it difficult. “I expected that my borrowed grace would expire. What happened while I was unresponsive?” Cas guessed correctly when it was Dean who spoke.
As the second song’s notes began to work their way through the air between them, Sam studied the demon on the stage that looked like a distant memory. Not only was the song not of Dean’s usual “Greatest Hits of Mullet Rock”, Sam was decently certain that it was still playing on current hits lists. Sam didn’t know the name or the lyrics, but he was sure he had flicked past the tune a time or two when Dean had actually relinquished the radio dial.
I want to thank Nonexistenz for the wonderful art for this. It was a pleasure working with you, and I sincerely love your art. I hope we can work together again.
“A demon is made through the tainting of a human soul. The Mark seems to taint the soul of its vessel in order to preserve itself. The demon is your brother.”
Dean chuckled uneasily, his stomach knotting as he realized what had happened. He embarrassedly admitted, “I may have been a bit distracted.” Cas seemed to not understand what he was trying to convey, so Dean continued, even though his life’s experience told him to shut up or change the subject. “I was sorta blinded by your grace. You’re the first angel I’ve seen since dying, Cas.”
Once the body disappeared, however, he found the nagging hope biting away at him during every sober moment he had experienced since. That was probably the actual reason he had stayed drunk these last three weeks, if he were being truly honest with himself. Because if he were sober long enough, he found, the hope would only last so long. Then the suffocating wave of despair would roll over him. It had been so thick that he had nearly passed out from the weight of it. That had been the first morning after Dean had died. Ever since, Sam had refused to tempt that demon inside himself again; every moment since had been spent with a drink in his hand.
Sam twisted the bottle in his hands. The beer in the dark glass had long grown warm, but Sam didn’t really seem to notice. His right thumb was absently picking at the torn corner of a label Sam hadn’t stopped to read. He had found himself once again sitting on the floor of Dean’s room, as he had every passing day since the body had vanished. Sam wished he had just buried his brother, not leaving him to be taken by one of Crowley’s goons. That had almost been as painful as holding his brother as his last breath had left him.
And this time, Dean looked like he was enjoying himself.
“Sorry, Sammy. Don’t know about you, but I’m just as much in a hurry to see Charlie as I am to be back in my home. I want a shower and a three-day nap in my own bed.”
Charlie nodded and headed a few feet down the hall, but by the time he turned the knob, Dean heard the footsteps stop. He looked down to see she had stopped and seemed to be perplexed by something as she looked back toward him. She smiled as she realized she was caught.
Cas swung his legs over the edge of the table, taking in the state of his vessel and grace. He felt much better than he had in the last moments he remembered. For a small moment, Cas felt a sense of relief, the horrible ache of his impending death having lessened. But then his mind began to process the impossibility of the situation and he realized what must have happened.
“Dean!” Sam’s sharp tone caught him off guard as he took the last turn that would lead them up to the bunker’s drive. “Shouldn’t we think about what’s gonna happen when we get there?” Sam seemed to be implying something heavy, something Dean should get instantly. Dean just cocked his brow and shrugged, not letting his little brother see just how much it irked him when his mind went daft like this. He hoped Cas might speak up from the back seat even, but Dean caught a stony face in the rearview. He wasn’t sure what was on Cas’s mind now, but he felt like the light air they had possessed was now sullied.
As he felt his breathing slow closer to normal, he opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling of the shower.
Dean felt himself be thrown across the room just before he got the ropes completely cut off Charlie’s wrists. The air rushed from his lungs as he hit the wall, and while he didn’t need it, it was still as unpleasant as hell. His gaze left his family, knowing Sammy would take care of it and he turned his eyes to the monster before him, shocked to see it as a beautifully deadly looking brunette woman in Greek robes.
“Well, at least we got a potential case, right? Didn’t realize how much I missed her, until-”
“We’re coming through Lebanon now, so yeah, we can meet you there.” Sam looked sideways to Dean, as if he wanted to ask the older Winchester a question, but Charlie cut him off with a laugh.
Ash, Ellen, and Jo.
Crowley there near him. He felt the force of the demon’s energy as he approached the bed, Dean’s eyes still shut tight. He tried to process where he was - it felt like his bed underneath him but he wasn’t sure exactly how he had gotten there.
Dean looked back to the doorway and didn’t miss that Sam and Charlie were staring at him with wide eyes. Cas patted him on the shoulder, and offered, “They’re just concerned and shocked. It will be fine soon enough.”
“I hate to ask, but you really are the same in there as always?” She looked embarrassed to ask, but he understood where she was coming from.
Boy, life just kept on kicking however, as Cas sighed and continued, “Yes, I did.” When he didn’t immediately continue coming forth with the details, Sam found himself growing anxious. He stood and made his way to retrieve the only consumable left in the fridge: beer.
“I definitely didn’t want you mentioning that.” Translation: sarcasm is apparently considered lying. Who knew?
“Well, not much surprises me anymore. Not since I met the two of you, anyways. Too many teeth on my old boss kinda does that to a girl.” Dean smiled at the quip and went to clap Charlie on the shoulder, pulling back and playing it off as an involuntary twitch when he noticed she flinched away. He kept his distance, forcing the smile to stay on his lips and not show her how much that hurt him. Charlie distracted herself quickly though, finally noticing that Cas had been there the whole time in all the commotion.
“Dean, what have you done?” He stepped just a bit closer, causing Dean to meet his eyes. Cas didn’t know if he was imagining the guilt he saw there. “The grace keeping me alive is from one of my brethren. How did you procure it?”
“You forgot one thing.” Cas couldn’t process the sound of Dean’s voice, coming through clear as day, though sounding like it was through gritted teeth. Aphrodite looked back at him, frozen as shock replaced the taunting on her features. “Demon now, a little less breakable. A lot more pissed off.” Dean gave a good kick and mental shove with his soul to dislodge himself from her grasp and arm. The goddess stumbled back away from him as he hit the concrete hard. Cas couldn’t believe the sight his eyes beheld. Dean pulled himself up to his knees and he watched as the demon brought his hand up to his gaping hole of a chest. Dean’s soul rippled and flared around him and he let out a demonic roar and the hole healed itself.
“Sorry about before, Dean.”
“I’m with Dean. I think we should get a few winks before we head out. The murders have been pretty close together, but I think a few hours wouldn’t hurt.”
“Dean, I am sorry, but I reacted with my gut, not my brain. I know you, and I know the hurt I saw on your face. If you didn’t kill anyone, where did you get the grace?”
Descending the stairs, Cas froze as he heard a voice call out.
“Honestly, Sam, I’m not completely sure. The best guess I have is that the Mark is to blame for this. There were rumors that Cain made a deal with Lucifer, but that may not have been a complete truth.” Cas paused, allowing the thoughts he had been harboring to process themselves in a clear manner. If he did not concentrate, he found his grief would take him down into spirals of despair. “I have begun to believe that The Mark cannot be killed, thus when the host dies, The Mark protects the vessel by creating a new demon to reside within it.”
“Yes, Dean, it is a ‘big deal’. Why would you go and make a deal with Crowley? You know how every deal the two of you have ever made has ended.”
Dean’s blackened energy whirled within him, twisting and turning in delicate yet sharp spirals. He had the slightest of tails running out from his spine, thin and long enough that it just barely kept from grazing the tiles below his feet. His skull shown below his features, and while it would seem to be off-putting if he tried to describe it, Cas found the features striking and hauntingly beautiful in their own way. He now also wore horns that protruded from behind his ears, twisting and bending back away from his face. They reminded Cas of a gazelle, more simple and delicate than some of the other demons he had seen. The final demon attribute that Dean now possessed was his wings. Few demons possessed them, but Dean’s were especially striking. They flowed wide behind him, long and graceful, his feathers dragging the tiles just a tad while standing up straight. The most peculiar fact about them was not their size, however; it was not uncommon for demons of power to possess quite large attributes, but instead, it was their appearance that still caused Cas to catch his breath. Dean’s wings were quite angelic in nature, large and fluffy feathers being so incredibly similar to those that Cas himself had, as well as his brethren. But instead of the usual colors that angels preferred to present, such as a pure white or perhaps a blue, Dean’s were such a dark pearlescent shade of emerald that they looked black.
hidden in here somewhere as well. Sam chuckled at the idea. They were both well past 30 at this point.
“I assume you’re Aphrodite then?” Dean looked like he was seconds from attacking but Cas knew him well enough that he was looking for an opening and stalling her with banter to distract her. Hopefully it worked.
Dean watched the two leave before standing to walk off to his room. He was looking forward to his memory foam and some decent water pressure.
He was pretty sure he heard Dean say his name before total darkness overtook him.
Dean lurched forward, his fingers skimming over Cas' arm, sickeningly missing him.
He fell forward into Cas, slumping against the angel.
He didn't understand. A pact? A price?
'Dean,' he said quietly, his eyes turned downwards. His face was a curious mixture of upset and happiness- how he had looked when the Empty had taken him.
'Yes.'
Dean stumbled forward.
Not like this.
No. No no nonononono.
'How..... how are
Fear. Terror.
And his nose was bleeding and his head hurt but he was holding Cas' hand, and the blackness was dissipating, diffusing and he could see him standing there again, the outline of the stupid fucking trench coat and-
'What?'
Then the humming sound was gone, and they both lay on the floor, Dean immobile, Cas shuddering.
? But you-'
Cas stood completely still, his lips cold, cold, cold, unmoving; a statue of an angel in a tench coat that Dean would go to hell for.
Dean rubbed his eyes. There was a figure standing in front of him, vaguely familiar through his foggy brain and pounding headache.
No. No way.
'It is a goodbye, Dean.'
Dean squeezed the cold fingers weakly, his head hurting so badly but Cas was still there,
'Everything you have ever done, the good, the bad-- you have done for love.'
Cas' arms went around him instantly, holding him tightly as he sobbed tearlessly into his shoulder- more in horror than sadness.
'Your best line.'
'What..I..'
But loved too late.Loved too much and too little.
'But I love you,' he whispered, reaching for him, to pull him back from the darkness.
'-But it's the-remember-the last night on earth? I didn't get to ask you-'
He felt Cas' shaky fingers on his, prising his clenched fists away from his collar.
'This is Hell, ' he said, staring Cas right in the eye.
'Dean?'
'Cas?
Loved and had watched in horror as he was stolen, stolen, and he never even got to tell him-
And that was the last thing that happened, before the room disappeared and then Cas was gone and then-
Dean felt so, so cold, where his lips were pressed to Castiel's.
'No. Cas,
- the face of someone Dean loved, too.
A beat.
Still there.
'You must have.'
Cas shrugged helplessly, tears coursing down his face.
He gripped on tighter.
“No, that actually kind of makes sense,” Sam said, sounding every bit the Stanford graduate he should have been, though the tone always irritated Dean.
“You love me?” Dean said, the words punched out of him, brows riding high as he stared at Castiel unblinking.
His skin prickled with discomfort. Light, bright and stark, filtered through his closed eyes. When he opened them, everything was too bright and he had to close his eyes for a moment. Through wincing squinted eyes, his surroundings slowly came into view. Tubes weaved their way in and out of him, and he tried not to think too much about their purpose. The mattress beneath him was shallow and hard, and the sheets were thin, though the pillows his head was propped up against were somewhat comfortable. Aches, from various parts of his body, thrummed in the background of his mind. He supposed that there was a severe level of pain being dampened by the painkillers he presumed were being pumped through his body.
“A witch?” Dean exclaimed, sneering as he looked down at the shotgun in his hands and wondered whether it would work on the ghost of a witch. “So we’re dealing with witch ghosts now?”
“Last time he died, you were basically suicidal and reckless and just so angry, and honestly Dean it terrified me,” Sam explained. “And this time, you got black-out drunk and wouldn’t say anything more than that he was gone. Now he’s back and he might not remember anything and it’s gonna be tough, and he might not even know who you are,” he continued, hands twisting in the air between them, “so I wanna make sure that you’re gonna be okay.”
“Okay Dean,” Cas said, and continued to stand at the edge of the bed. He still looked a little perturbed. It reminded Dean of the first day at school, when all the kids didn’t really know what to do and looked lost without their parents, and when he looked like that it was hard to remember that Cas was as old as dirt and could smite Dean in a matter of seconds.
“I’m taller than It’s A Wonderful Life over there,” Dean said, he titled his head toward Cas, and swallowed his feelings as he cocked the pistol.
“Oh, well that’s good,” Dean said, hedging his tone toward hopeful, just in case it wasn’t. He looked up at Cas from the corner of his eye.
“So what now, you’ve got your grace back?” Sam asked, always the smarter and focused one, asking the important questions.
“You’re welcome,” Cas replied and then he was gone.
“Yeah, that makes sense,” Dean muttered, scratching at his face, “we’ll get you some clothes and get you out of here,” he added, and shared a quick look with Sam from across the bed.
Squinting up at Sam’s face backlit against the stark early afternoon sun, Eileen nodded and began to herd Jack into the diner with one of those wide bright smile on her face. The boy didn’t seem to mind.
Something about being included in that list, though he already knew that Dean counted him among his family and friends, made a gooey kind of warm sensation spread out inside him. He wanted to hold onto it.
“Guys?” Sam called, his lumbering steps made the floorboards creak, the sound died in the doorway. “Ew, seriously?” he asked, looking between them as they reluctantly pulled apart.
He wanted to put his fist through the window, he wanted to scream, he wanted to bleed, he wanted to drown himself in whiskey. It was too much. Dean had thought that he could handle it. He had seen Cas all beat up so many times before, but it had never been like this.
“How many people get as many chances as we have Sam? Because I don’t think anyone else ever has, and I’ve fucked them all up, and I’ve left so much shit unsaid and undone and I’ve said shit that I don’t even mean so that maybe it won’t feel so bad when everything falls apart again, but this kinda feels like our last chance or our biggest one and I don’t wanna waste it with my usual bullshit,” Dean rambled, jaw tight, his heart was still pounding.
“Of course we’re gonna get her Sammy,” Dean said, returning Sam’s smile. “C’mon kid, we’re going to Arkansas,” he added, herding Jack into the backseat of the car.
Sam nodded, ran a hand through his hair, and looked out the window.
“Yep.”
With a sigh, Dean clambered into the crawl space. Gun in one hand and flashlight in the other, he swept the barren area, there wasn’t much there besides a mound of something in the far corner. And of course it had to be in the far corner. Dean sighed again and moved further into the tight space. He wasn’t necessarily claustrophobic, but he didn’t exactly enjoy being shut in somewhere with only one way out and a ghost who also happened to be a powerful witch hanging around waiting to snap his neck.
Dean took one arm off the wheel and held it open for Jack, and twitched his fingers to beckon him over. And in an instant Jack was plastered to his side. He squeezed Jack’s shoulder and held on for a moment before letting him go. Jack wiped his eyes as he moved back to the passenger side, Dean smiled and turned the music up a little louder, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel.
“See Sammy,” Dean said smugly, smirking that sharp smile that crinkled his eyes at Sam.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanks for reading!
“That’s, that’s almost impossible to explain,” Dean said, laughing bitterly as he shook his head, “it’s so convoluted that even if you know it’s true in here,” he went on, and tapped his chest, over his heart, with the pads of two fingers, “you still won’t believe it in here,” he tapped his temple.
“I understand that he struggles with his feelings and expressing them,” Castiel said, sighing as he began to trace his name with his fingers.
“Dean,” Cas groaned, “I’m sure you know what I mean.”
“Well,” Dean began shakily, and coughed into his fist before continuing, “we don’t exactly have health insurance and the hospital’s gonna realise that sooner or later, so we should probably leave before they figure it out,” he explained.
“She’s a friend, and she’s Claire’s guardian, or well she used to be, I guess Claire’s grown out of that by now in a way,” Dean said in a sort of roundabout way, obviously thinking as he spoke. “Jody kind of runs a home for wayward girls,” he added, grinning at Castiel.
“Why would God do that?” Cas asked, eyes squinted and head tilted, he looked more constipated than he did in his younger years and the thought almost made Dean laugh before he remembered what they were talking about.
“Well, you’re welcome,” Dean returned, just as mush mouthed and bashful as Cas had been, which was very. He knew he wasn’t doing enough, it wasn’t enough and it was never going to be enough, but Cas didn’t know that and Dean was dreading the moment when he figured it out.
“You killed Death,” Dean said, uselessly.
, he hoped he was putting Metatron’s little ‘gift’ to proper use.
each other, and I’m kinda freaking out because I’m not good at all of this, I’m famously terrible at feelings, so I know I’m gonna mess this up,” Dean rambled, wiping his clammy hands against the sheets, chest tight as he watched Cas’ blank face.
The smile didn’t leave his face. He listened as Sam explained the whole thing to Jack, watched as the kid nodded, brows rising up his forehead as his expression shifted into recognition, smile plastered to his face. Cas was watching him too, that fond look on his face, and Dean wished he could just give Cas all his memories back. That way Cas would know just how special this moment was. Their family was back together, for the most part, and Cas didn’t even know how lucky he was. Blissfully ignorant of everything they’d lost and everything he had sacrificed just to get there.
“I, uh, apologise if I startled you,” Cas said carefully.
“Yes, heaven also seems needlessly convoluted,” Cas said, and scratched at his stubble, Dean wondered if it was beginning to irritate him. Maybe he could help Cas shave at their next motel.
“Oh,” Sam breathed, brows raised. He turned again to sign for Eileen, and she had a similar reaction,
The diner sat by the roadside. Blistering late May sunlight bleached its mint finish and bounced off of the chrome accents, it almost reminded Dean of a vintage Cadillac. They all climbed out of the car. Stretching and groaning in the mid-spring heat, Dean’s joints popped and clicked, and he sighed at the small flood of relief. He really wasn’t getting any younger.
Dean didn’t reply, instead he cranked the volume up.
“Okay, I think I’ve got a way to describe it,” Sam said, uncertain, and cleared his throat. Castiel turned his attention back to Sam. “Do you understand what it means when someone says that something feels like home?” He asked, elbows on the table as he leaned forward slightly.
“Thanks to angelic abilities I no longer have,” Cas murmured, the corners of his mouth tipped down into a frown.
“Can I put this on?” Jack asked and held up a tape for Dean to see. He didn’t really have to ask, since the cassette came from Dean’s personal collection, but Jack was polite and earnest to a fault. The tape was Blue Oyster Cult’s ‘
Dean really had a knack for derailing conversations. At this point Castiel couldn’t remember what he had meant to say, and his confidence was all but completely depleted, there was no way he could steer the conversation back to Dean’s personal experiences. It was always a near painful endeavour to get Dean to talk about his feelings. This might as well have been a lost cause before it had even begun.
“Just get in the car,” Dean said and climbed into the driver’s side without waiting for Cas to follow. Cas followed anyway, sliding in beside Dean as he started up his baby’s engine. The radio came to life with the rest of her. He reached over and turned it down before he began to pull out of the junkyard, and Cas was staring hard at the side of his face all the while.
“Heh, guess we’ve just got to take it as it comes, just like always,” Dean said, smirking bitterly. “You think you’re gonna be able to go back to sleep?”
Sam cleared his throat and started talking about the case they were headed toward.
“Isn't it best to get more than one opinion?” Castiel returned, frowning again. Dean and Sam consulted as many sources as they could when on a hunt. It wasn’t unusual, even if it was kind of a lie.
Castiel gasped into the dead of night, heart kicking up like a wild horse in his chest, fingers twisted in the coarse motel sheets. Form and shapes came to him slowly as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. He turned his head in search of Dean asleep in the bed beside his, but the other bed was empty and for some reason that had Castiel’s heart stuttering to pound hard enough that he felt his whole body throbbing.
“’Cause I’m your favourite,” Dean said, he looked over his shoulder for a moment to flick a smile at Castiel, Sam snorted from the passenger seat.
“I did what now?” Cas asked, brow furrowed and eyes squinted, as he looked between the brothers.
“That sounds needlessly convoluted,” Cas murmured. “What’s the difference between a reaper and Death anyway?”
“Memory foam?” Cas asked, head titled just so.
“There is much that I love about Earth,” Cas began, eyes turned back toward the sloping hill, the town below them and the sky above. “Nature holds so much intricate beauty that I could stare at it for a thousand years and still find something new to see and marvel at. And mankind has built so much out of all of this, good and bad things, and all of it is a marvel both terrifying and awe inspiring. You all struggle everyday to live to the next one. And every choice you make is a gift, and despite everything it put you through Dean, I’m glad you made the choices you did, because they brought our paths together,” he said, speaking like all the books Dean had ever read and half forgotten.
“Sam has had a similar amount of luck in this area as you have,” Castiel pointed out, though Sam had nowhere near the amount of casual sex that Dean had, but Castiel didn’t believe that it was relevant to his own endeavours.
“Huh,” Sam breathed and looked back out the window contemplatively. “Well, I don’t know how much help I’ve been, but I hope you figure it out,” he added, his eyes returned to Castiel, his smile was small but genuine.
“Oh yeah, in Dodge City, he knew who all those cowboys were,” Jack signed, leaning a little further over the bed, mouth moving wordlessly around the words. “He even brought his cowboy boots with him.”
“Thank you Jack,” Castiel murmured. He took the items with some effort and struggled with them as Jack stood there. With the bottle of water held between his thighs, Castiel slowly worked the pill bottle open, and once he got the lid off he squinted up at Jack. “How old are you?”
“Do you know where you are?” the nurse asked, watching him, filing away his reactions to be reported later.
“What about me?” Castiel asked.
“Well, if I’m not human, then what am I?” he asked, unable to keep the harshness out of his tone.
“What do you wanna do Cas?” Dean asked eventually.
between you. He flicked his eyes to the rear view again and smiled back at Cas.
“Yeah, it’s what he deserves,” Dean spat. It was the least of it. To be just like the rest of them, powerless and insignificant, left to fight for his existence with the rest of the human race, the thought was vindictively satisfying.
“Seriously?” Dean grouched, brows raised as he stared between them, hands open.
“Right,” Sam drew out and rolled his eyes.
“No, thank
“That’s alright sir, we just need some information and then I can let you go,” she said, and Dean could hear the clacking of a keyboard.
“Dean, that’s not going to happen,” Cas said, voice low and serious, as though Dean had offended him.
“I was, for a little while, but now my head hurts,” Cas said, throat audibly clicking as he swallowed, the sound of him shifting against the headboard was loud in the silence of the night slowly spilling into day.
“Yes, it is good,” Cas returned, staring right back at Dean, smiling slightly. The sun sat fat in the sky behind his head, light cascaded down around him like honey spilling over his shoulders, gold leaf in his inky hair, backlit and moody in a way that reminded Dean of exactly what Cas really was.
“Like hell he’ll ever…” The words froze as he caught sight of Dean approaching the stage. In all their years working on the family business, Dean had professed a deep-seated hatred of karaoke. He had always claimed that it was where washed up rock wannabes went to die without dignity. While Sam believed that was well, he knew it was only a half-truth for Dean. While Dean could sing along to the radio with the best of them, Sam knew Dean secretly possessed quite a substantial amount of stage fright.
“One addendum, Dean. I give you what you need, and you agree to never step foot in my kingdom again. No excuses or exceptions.” Dean nodded and Crowley flipped his hand forward, throwing a vial to Dean. His finger barely closed around it before he was flying again, trying his damnedest to move as fast as he could. The phone was still calm and deadly quiet in his pocket, but was that good, was it to mean that Cas was still ok? Did Sam even know his own phone number to call if something went wrong? Suddenly, Dean felt the panic race through him that he had been pushing away and even though the trip back into the bunker had only taken mere seconds, he felt his breath catch in his throat as he came to a halt next to his brother, so sure that the younger Winchester would say he was too late.
Sam couldn’t believe his eyes as he watched the demon next to Crowley. Dean looked more alive and at ease than Sam could remember since they were kids. Even then, Sam could still remember Dean being too old for his skin, always on guard to protect his younger brother. But that all had been stripped away, and Dean didn’t seem to be carrying that constant weight on his shoulders anymore. If Sam hadn’t known better, he would swear his brother had an identical twin. It was just downright unnerving to watch him laughing it up with the King of Hell.
Written for PPB 2020.
“Why you still feel the need to hide your porn, I’ll never know.” Sam’s stomach dropped as the words left his lips. “You felt the need…” He corrected himself, realizing that it was the first time he had erroneously used the present tense to refer to his brother since Metatron had murdered him.
Cas looked up from the table, as if he were just now noticing that Sam was in the room with him. There was a pain in his eyes, which Sam understood only too well. If anyone had been as close to Dean as he was, it would have been Cas. But what concerned Sam was the fear he saw there, too. It almost felt as if the angel was afraid to tell him something. He couldn’t imagine how things could get any worse than they already were.
Aphrodite turned to face them, still holding Dean’s body in the air in front of her. Cas felt his stomach turn in reaction to the small twitches that were running along Dean’s legs as his neurons fired erratically. Blood ran down the arm that was still protruding through Dean’s torso. “You pathetic fools need to learn your place. All we hear is how the Winchesters and their pet angel keep screwing the world over. It ends now.”
He turned back and saw he had completely abandoned Charlie in his rush to sleep. “Sorry, kiddo. You can have one of the rooms down this way if you want. Think we still have the one you stayed in last time made up.” Charlie nodded and followed after him, but she looked a bit tense. Dean thought it was weird, but he knew she would tell him when she was ready. Which apparently came when they hit his door, his hand on the knob as she piped up.
It couldn’t have been more than three minutes since Crowley had pulled Sam into the alley, but boy had he made good use of his time tonight. Sam’s jaw was aching something fierce from a solid right hook he hadn’t known Crowley to possess. Gone was the usual banter the King of Hell loved to dish, instead replaced with an almost crazed need to bust Sam into bruised and bloody pieces. Crowley made quick work of Sam’s body, but he didn’t miss a chance to deliver a few psychological blows while he was at it.
He wasn’t shocked by the ire in Dean’s voice, though it still stung nonetheless. “Don’t sweat it. I deserved it, didn’t I?” Dean slunk back just a bit further, and Cas took the hurt in Dean’s voice as confirmation.
. Stupid stuff doesn’t seem affected.” What she said made sense, but he couldn’t question it since they were interrupted by Sam and Cas coming back into the room, six-packs in hand.
territory,” he kneed Sam in the gut to accent his possession of the bar, “and just take Dean away with you?” For the first time in years, Sam felt legitimate fear in the face of Crowley. The demon seemed to seethe with anger, an unhinged quality flashing in his eyes. His sudden fear was likely due to the sudden remembrance that Crowley was
in his body,” Sam opened his lips to speak, but Cas pressed forward. “It was
There was nothing he could think of that would even lead to the assumption that Cas and he were a couple. Sure, people made jokes about Cas being his boyfriend quite often, but Dean allowed that to pass as those people were usually dicks. Plus, they weren’t serious. That had to be it, Charlie wasn’t serious. How could she be? He was the most hetero guy he knew. She had to be joking, that was that.
“Not exactly.” Charlie pulled a page from one of the stacks, one that Dean hadn’t yet read. She handed it over to Sam, who began to take a look over the information. “I haven’t went to do interviews yet, but it almost seems like they’re telling the truth, and
Sam let the engine idle as he sat alone in the car, staring at the dive bar ahead of him. The sign proclaimed the seedy establishment to be The Blue Bird, “Home of the World’s Best Curly Fries”. Sam seriously doubted that. This place was even a bit low for their standards, but it was where his brother’s trail had gone dead. Sam hadn’t wasted any time leaving the bunker after Cas had given him the rest of the details.
Stepping into the show he shivered at the cold porcelain of the tub below his toes before twisting on the water. The spray was icy as it hit his skin and he chuckled. Sam had always told him when they were kids that he was weird for not warming the shower first, but Dean couldn’t imagine doing it any other way anymore. After all was said and done, a good shock of cold water went a long way to wake him up many nights and sober him when mornings came too soon. As the water heated up, he also reminded himself that you can’t really appreciate warmth until you’ve been cold.
“And why should I help you, Squirrel?” Crowley gave a quick grin that definitely shoved Dean right into the waves of anger that he needed. “Is poor Feathers not doing well?” The feigned concern was enough for Dean at that moment.
Kevin and Mrs. Tran.
Charlie leaned toward him on her elbows. “Wait-The cases are about people not being able to lie.
“Cas! Stop!” Dean held himself still, not actually worried about the angel blade itself, more so worried about why Cas would respond this way.
. Sam’s jaw went slack as he listened to his brother sing, not believing what he was hearing. He knew his brother liked to sing along with the radio, and in the shower at 3 am (much to Sam’s disdain), but he never knew that Dean was
“You didn’t kill one of my brothers, did you?” Cas leaned forward on his knees and watched as Dean’s eyebrow cocked up in surprise.
But if it was, why was he so worked up over it? Why was it that he had never seen anything between them, and now that Charlie opened her big mouth, he was suddenly doubting himself? He tilted his head back to wash out the shampoo and took a deep breath. He knew what it was. He was pent up. He hadn’t been out bar hopping for a quick fling in weeks. With everything going on, it made sense, but he realized now he was itching for release. He wasn’t usually one to take care of the issue himself, as he was unopposed to one night stands and just went trolling when the need hit him. But it wasn’t exactly the most opportune time, so he leaned back against the shower wall and steadied himself, taking his cock in his hand.
Sam sighed as he perused the bunker’s refrigerator. One irritating side effect of his constant drinking, besides the daily hangovers, of course, was the reality that had begun to set in. What scraps were left had long since gone rancid. Slamming the door, Sam began to accept that today might be the day that he finally left the bunker.
He sighed as he took a seat on the bed, running him hands over his face. “Just that I might not be exactly as straight as I thought and that potentially is the issue here, not my inability to express my feelings properly.” Charlie gave him a look that said she was a bit shocked at his forthrightness. He shrugged. “
When Dean’s next words left his lips, no amusement was left to be found. “You best remember who I am, you pathetic little vermin. I only followed you because I was worried about the people I love.” Dean spared a glance back to his brother, who saw concern wrinkling the skin around his black eyes. “I may be a demon now. There’s no evading that. But I am not one of your playthings. I am what you fear most.” Dean slowly approached Crowley’s hanging form as he spoke, bringing the Blade up to his throat. Sam swore there was true fear in Crowley’s eyes now. “And most importantly of all: You are no king of mine.” He flung Crowley away with an almost disinterested stare. “Go find yourself a new whore for the night.” Crowley looked up from the ground where he landed, his eyes burning with unspent rage. But Dean ignored it all with a cool smirk. “I’m sure there are still a few left that haven’t crossed that Daddy complex driven regret of their bucket list.”
Dean slowed as he felt his feet skim the dank that spanned just before the throne room, coming to a stop just before the doors. He rolled his shoulders, preparing himself for the inevitable torment that would be coming as soon as he stepped forward. He pushed down the anxiety he felt and instead flipped his eyes to black, for once wanting to feel the power of the demon taint in his blood flowing through him. He exhaled and then forced his strength forward, throwing open the doors before him with his mind. He chose to move with just a small extra flourish as he entered, hovering as he sent a strong gust of power forward with his wings. He rarely connected to this part of himself, but tonight it was necessary. It was the strongest part of himself, and he needed strength above all else.
He felt Crowley’s hand on his wrist, which would have normally made him flinch at the contact. But he felt like he was underwater, his brain not catching up to the sensations he was experiencing. Crowley slipped something into his hand - the First Blade, by the feel of its hilt in his fist- and suddenly he felt the night come back to him in a wave.
Dean knew how he’d move forward. It was just so simple and yet so perfectly poetic.
“How did you guys figure that out?” Sam’s gaze shifted from Charlie to Dean. Cas was somewhere, but of course, Dean was making sure not to make any sort of eye contact there for fear of what might happen. “I thought the bar was a bust?”
Cas froze. He couldn’t breathe. He didn’t need oxygen, but it felt like his chest would collapse. He registered the sound of Charlie’s and Sam’s knees hitting the concrete, sobs from one or both of them hitting his ears. He stood ramrod still. His mind was blank as he watched the color drain from Dean’s face, contrasted by a bright stream of blood running down his chin, as his eyes turned glassy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Crowley looked up from some sort of pile of papers in his as Dean strode forward, shock not quite hidden quickly enough on his face before Dean could see it. Dean watched as it morphed into an arrogance Crowley wore well, one that Dean knew meant that Crowley was thrown by his presence there in Hell. They both knew each other well enough to sense that the other was not up to the game tonight. Crowley was surrounded as usual by the cronies that were vying for the King’s affections, trying to prove that they were valuable to the plots and plans of Hell.
Cas’s eyes lit up and Dean felt shocked as he listened to the sound of Cas laughing. It was the lightest laugh, completely airy and light, and unlike anything he had ever heard the angel make. Cas calmed himself quickly, though the act didn’t seem too easy for him. “I am sorry, Dean. I believe your reaction was a completely appropriate one.” Cas still chuckled, and Dean couldn’t help but smile in response, the tension effectively broken between them.
He still couldn’t wrap his head around the new state of himself. He would have never had the guts to do this sort of thing before. Then again, he wasn’t the same man he was just a month and a half ago. No, that Dean had been human. Not a black-eyed monster of the night:
Sam was the first to speak, “How are you feeling, Cas?”
“We? Is Cas with you? I’ve been meaning to meet old Feathers for a while now. See you soon then, Bitches!” And like the whirlwind she was, Charlie cut the call, leaving Dean feeling like he had taken twenty rounds with Mr. T.
Dean hid his real feelings behind humor, his quickest and easiest defense when things got a little too close to feeling too deep for him to process. “I thought you said you could only taste molecules anymore. Why would pie be any different?” Dean expected a dry response, something he had found that Cas could pull out pretty quickly whenever Dean razzed him. Sarcasm seemed easy for the angel nowadays.
“Not exactly. We know all of the affected were couples, but past that they had very little in common.” Cas provided the intel but Dean still wasn’t convinced. He tried his best to see it, but he thought maybe that there was just nothing to be seen.
. He belted the lyrics with abandon, perfectly reaching even the highest of notes. He showed no hint of insecurity as he performed.
“Sure thing, Boris.” With a simple flick of his wrist, Dean sent the two goons smoking out of their meatsuits into the air around them. Another sent them pooling into the ground, leaving a scorch mark where they hit. With the loss of their grip on his body, Sam tensed himself as best he could for the incoming impact on the pavement, but it never came. Instead, he felt as if a hand was slowly lowering him down and backwards against the building. The eyes he met in his brother’s skull were still black as coal, but he swore they begged for his trust in that moment. Sam pressed himself against the wall as Crowley spun to face Dean full on with a violent hiss.
Sam nodded and looked to Cas. “I’m going to grab a few books from the library before we go, do you have any ideas about what it might be?”
Dean pushed down his longing for his brother, focusing on the lyrics of his song. As the final notes played, his eyes searched the crowd, pleased as he noted the generally pleasant consensus he saw there. However, he found himself floored when his eyes passed from Crowley onto brooding shoulders he would recognize anywhere.
He closed his eyes then and let the music take him away.
“Well, Cas,” Sam took a deep breath to steady his voice and calm his nerves. He had to hold strong for what was about to come. “You know what this all means, don’t you?” Cas raised an eyebrow but did not speak. He seemed to be frozen by Sam’s sudden resolve. Sam’s voice turned low and deadly with a certainty he did not feel.
started to play, but it was a pleasant feeling, so he decided to ride the wave. He didn’t have to think about his feelings tonight, instead, he could just lay back and relax at last. He was finally home.
to leave?”
Charlie shook her head. “Five of the vics were, but three were the partners of someone who was affected. And two were suicides, one of each.”
Cas helped usher Charlie back towards the entrance, keeping his eyes on the two behind them. Cas cursed internally that they had been taken so easily, but Aphrodite was a tricky one. She had let them get into the space before overcoming them. Being a goddess, she moved quickly and effectively at taking them out.
“Why don’t we take a few, hit the showers and get a hunter’s four?” Dean suggested, really hoping he could get just a few hours here in the bunker. The time away had been fruitful but he definitely needed to recoup after the excitement. Luckily Charlie spoke up and saved him.
He got the message Dean was projecting his way. Dean would not be saved by using any sort of cure. He wanted to stay the way The Mark had made him. The problem that lay before Sam was a killer:
They seemed to freeze for a moment, as Cas lowered the blade out of immediate sight and looked away in embarrassment. The silence began to press in on Dean and he said the first thing that came to mind. “Why did you go straight for my throat anyways? That sure of how evil I am?”
“Well, damn. Alright then. We need to kill this thing or reverse it, or something. Any ideas on who it is?”
Dean felt an urge to hit the angel, and he tried to staunch it down before he reacted poorly and rashly. “You think I would hurt my brother, Cas? Really? After all this time, you think so little of me?” He realized the assumption actually hurt when he thought about it. Cas was one of his best friends in this world, and he was shocked that he couldn't see that he was just the same as ever. He guessed that it might be as expected, but he had hoped for more. He just hadn’t stopped to realize it before that moment.
It’s not like I talk about my feelings. I might as well have the emotional capacity of a head of lettuce. I bottle everything up and even though I know I’m completely wrong for him, I want nothing more than to kiss Cas the moment he walks back in here.” Dean paused and caught his breath, but then it hit him that CHarlie wasn't shocked, she was stunned speechless, and he processed what he just spewed.
“Sammy.” The name left Dean’s lips like a prayer as he saw his brother’s body slump into unconsciousness. He sighed as he began checking his brother over. Crowley really had done a number on him. A busted upper lip, broken ribs, a probable concussion. Maybe more. He stood and lifted Sam’s body over his shoulder. He grunted under the weight, letting out a weak chuckle. Even as a demon, his brother really was a Moose.
you lie?” She waited expectantly for him to come up with something to prove it. Dean wracked his brain for a second, his temper flaring over the idea that he had somehow been affected in the few hours they had been in town.
. First and foremost. And one truth will always and forever rule my soul, no matter how tainted or charred it becomes.” His free hand flying out in front of him, Dean slung a telekinetic blast at Crowley, nearly knocking the elder demon off his feet. “
“How, Cas?” Sam’s voice was weak, trembling with an uncertainty that Sam rarely exhibited. His hand shook heavily as he ran it through his hair, a nervous habit that did little to pacify his fears. Cas sighed, both their pain and his dying grace really beginning to take their toll on his will to continue. Nevertheless, by the looks of Sam, Cas knew that he needed to be the strong one through this. Sam honestly looked worse than Cas had ever seen him, even having witnessed the aftermath of the trials. Cas pressed on, however, knowing Sam would not let it go until he had every detail, no matter how bad it would be for the both of them.
The final notes of the band were still reverberating through the amps as his boots hit the sticky cement. He quickly approach Cyndi at the bar, who flashed him a seductive smile. If only he had the time to use those lips the way he had several times over the past week. He cut her off before she could make him an offer he couldn’t refuse.
In a moment of profound cowardice, Dean retreated to the back of the stage to speak with the band. After informing them of his next song choice, he returned to the mic, squaring his shoulders. He passed a soulful stare to his brother, willing him to understand. He looked away and spoke into the mic, addressing the rest of the bar.
“Because I froze as well when I first saw your new visage. It seems that we both have thrown each other off.” Dean’s grin grew wider, comforted by the knowledge that even Cas could be thrown by him. He wasn’t sure why, but he found himself feeling almost prideful about it. Then it struck him and he frowned.
After popping the cap and swallowing a swig, Sam began to realize Cas wasn’t going to continue on his own. “Cas?” The angel met his gaze. “It was one of Crowley’s guys, right?”
“Does it look to you,” Crowley tilted his chin in a way of acknowledging the sight before them, “like Dean
Charlie sheepishly met Dean’s graze. “I’m sorry how I reacted to your new… lifestyle choice?” Charlie sort of shrugged and Dean shook his head at her turn of phrase, but let her continue. “It was a bit of a shock.”
“Dean doesn’t care about his little whelp of a brother anymore. Why do you think he came so freely when I called?” Sam winced, at both the blow Crowley dealt to his stomach and the harsh reality he had yet to face. Crowley’s words were echoes of the ones his fears that taunted his mind whenever he had dared stay sober. “Dean’s shaken himself from your pathetic grip on him. He’s living it up here in ways he never could when he had to keep his eyes on you.” Crowley hooked him hard across the jaw, grabbing Sam’s long locks in a single move that trapped his gaze on Crowley’s face. He struggled to breathe around the blood that was pooling around his tongue. Crowley lifted his arm to strike him again, but paused to send more verbal assaults into Sam’s face, his breath so close Sam could smell the liquor on it. “Squirrel has finally discovered his true nature. He’s no longer your brother; he’s
“Dean, why-”
his most recent conquest. Every day since Dean’s death, Cas had visited a different pie shop, trying one pie at each location.
He knew that a single song would never be able to convey everything that he wanted to say to his brother, but he vowed he would make amends the moment the final words left his lips.
“Sorry, kiddo. I forgot-”
“I-” Dean sighed and pulled the headphones completely off before sitting up straighter, crossing his legs. Even in all his bravado, Cas could see how uncomfortable Dean was to admit what was coming, telling Cas to think hard on how he would respond, no matter what Dean told him. “I went to hell. Traded Crowley for it. No big deal.” Dean scoffed and a small chuckle followed, Cas was sure that Dean found humor in the irony. But Cas had to hold himself together for a moment, trying not to yell at the Winchester sitting in front of him.
Cas shook his head, seemingly just as confused as Dean was. “No, I asked you multiple times, Dean. I didn’t reach you until I had repeated myself thrice.” Cas seemed so sure of this that Dean had to pause for a moment and try to replay the minutes prior. But all he could remember was the way Cas had looked coming down the stairs behind them, the way his grace had burned like the sun but also so lightly that Dean worried somewhere in the back of his mind that there was too much of it and somehow also not enough.
“Dean?”
Dean cursed as he cleared the third factory. Still, nothing to be found, and now Charlie’s car was parked next to Baby. Why wouldn’t they listen to him? The last thing he needed right now was to worry about them in the middle of trying to keep his mouth shut.
?” Cas stopped, wondering if Sam had been insinuating that same thought that was now passing through his mind. Fidgeting with the lapels of his trusted trench coat, he forwent the option of flying to Dean’s room, instead walking slowly down the hall. He struggled to think of the words to say. Knowing he had probably once again stuck his foot in his mouth, as Dean said.
Sam gave him the look that said ‘Don’t tell me I didn’t warn ya’ but stayed silent for the last half a mile. Down at the edge of the bunker’s garage drive, Charlie stood against her car, looking down at her phone, but at the sound of the tired coming close, Dean watched as she looked up and then cocked her head in a weird look of disbelief.
Cas tried to respond. Dean would have given a snappy comeback of some kind, but Cas couldn’t seem to control his mouth.
Dean took three long strides, stepping up onto the throne’s pedestal and pressing himself within a breath’s space of Crowley. “You and I both know what you fear, Crowley. I can make it happen.” Crowley tried in vain to keep a cool look upon his features, but Dean could see that he was faltering. He wanted this to move faster, however, and so he pressed even further, not letting up from Crowley at that moment, forgiving himself for not making Crowley squirm just a little longer. “I’ll sign a deal with you Crowley. You give me grace and anything you know that can help save Cas, and I won’t take hell from you right here and now.” Dean watched as a shocked and scoffing arrogance came over Crowley. He apparently had enough of Dean just then, and Dean stumbled back as Crowley threw him unexpectedly out of his personal space. Dean stumbled to his knee in the surprise of the moment. Crowley stood, stepping toward Dean with determination.
“Fine, we take a look. But I think we’re wasting a trip. Where is this place, anyways, Charlie?”
“It’s his grace.” Sam seemed to take this at face value, looking just as grim as Dean felt. He grasped at anything he could, trying to think of where Metatron could have taken Cas’s grace. Was there even anything left? They had been told there was, but could Metatron be trusted? Dean’s head whirled, thoughts spinning out of control until one floored him by the simplicity of it.
Dean didn’t try to speak as he popped the cork from the vial in his hand, worried he wouldn’t know how to respond or how to force the grace into Cas. Sam tried asking where he had gone, what was he doing, what was going on, but in his anxiety, Dean ignored him and just focused on Cas. And the moment the top came free of the glass, the swirling energy inside began to flow out toward Cas.
Sam spun on his heel, his rage boiling over toward his only remaining friend. “What I want to know is why you even came back here. We could have met up, wherever you were. We could have rid that demon from my brother’s body by now. I’d have my brother’s body back right now if you had just called me the moment you found the bastard!” Sam took a step towards Cas, finally releasing all the pain and sorrow he had kept locked inside over the past forty-three days.
“You find yourself a nice lady hunter on one of your adventures?”
“Wait, you didn’t freeze though. You pulled your blade, Cas.” Dean tried to think when Cas could mean, but he was coming up empty-handed.
He was going to kick his brother’s ass.
“What do you mean?”
“Wait, I didn’t respond? Yes, I did, Cas. As soon as you asked where Sam was. But you already had your blade at my throat by then.” Dean tried to keep his confusion from turning to annoyance, which of course he always found too easy with Cas. He was always the person who seemed to keep him riding a rollercoaster of calming thoughts and possible explosive confusion. He never really understood what it was about Cas that did that to him though. He really probably needed to think about it, but he pushed that away for later.
What came out, however, was the following: “I’m pretty sure you were spot on and I have feelings for Cas and I have no idea how to stop talking. Why am I still talking?” Once the words left his lips, he cursed.
“Shouldn’t we head out? It’s about an 8-hour drive, so we could probably hit town early if we get going soon.” Sam looked like he was waiting for the rest of them to agree.
Cas felt his heart leap and fall both at once, trepidation in his movements and he back his descent again, watching for the elder Winchester to turn the corner. Dean stepped into view, a beer in hand, a questioning look on his face. But Cas watched his soul instead, really taking a moment to process how the elder Winchester’s soul presented itself now.
they told the truth? What would make them do both?”
“Factories? That’s the usual hiding spot, so it makes sense. So what, we armor up then?”
Charlie listed the coordinates, giving Dean a general idea that the small town was deep in the heart of corn country: Small Town USA, Indiana. Dean sighed, not really getting any excitement from where they were headed. He stretched his shoulder, watching as Sam stood more quickly than he expected.
Dean opened his eyes to meet Crowley’s gaze and he knew his own were black as he looked up at the demon. Crowley wore a smug air about him, but Dean nearly missed it, seeing for the first time what Meg and Cas had described over the years, the demon’s true face.
Cas felt his cheek turn up just a tiny bit as he remembered the day he had first realized his feelings for Dean. He couldn’t remember what the two had been arguing about, but as Cas had watched Dean and Sam toss banter back and forth, he had felt a warmth spread through his chest. The laughter and passion he saw in Dean’s eyes that day had solidified how beautiful the hunter was to him, and from that moment forward, Cas had been officially lost.
Dean felt his irritation build but he tried to squash it down, tried to keep a level head about himself. It would be quicker to follow the rules, he knew that. “I’m requesting an audience, Crowley.” He kept his features neutral, but it was almost a losing battle when he saw the humor in Crowley’s eyes.
“Slow down a minute and-”
Dean paused as he wandered into the war room, looking to find Sam. He had heard his come back into the bunker and planned to give him a piece of his mind. But he froze when he caught sight of the blindly blue light that stood before him. It was one of the most gorgeous and surreal images he had ever laid his eyes on. He focused and saw the vessel below, taking in the sight and processing that, for the first time in their friendship, he was actually seeing Cas’s grace.
“Let me make one thing perfectly clear to you,” Dean slowly, methodically walked a perimeter around Crowley, who was quickly looking more uneasy by the second. If Sam didn’t know better, he would think Dean was pushing Crowley farther away from him. “You do not want to make me angry.” Sam would have laughed at Dean’s inappropriate pop culture reference if the situation had been any less dire on his end.
The radio had been playing idly since days forgotten at this point, but just then, Zep’s “Traveling Riverside Blues” began to wind its way through the room. Sam’s lips just barely managed to turn up at the sound of one of Dean’s favorite songs. He poured a shot of beer out for his brother, not caring that he was soiling the carpet, and then lifted the bottle in the general direction of the sky. “Here’s one for you, Big Brother. Wherever you are,” Sam whispered to his childhood companion, protector, and best friend.
Cas sat alone at a table in McKinney, Texas.
Dean felt his power roll inside him like a tidal wave. His wings extended out and he allowed them to beat menacingly as he started toward the bitch who ruined one of his favorite shirts. He wasn’t even sure if she could see them, but he didn’t really even give a damn at the moment. He was out for blood. Tensing just a second, he pounced, taking advantage of the shock still on her face.
Cas seemed to struggle to find an answer, but finally, something passed behind his eyes that Dean didn’t recognize and he spoke. “You’re right, Dean. You wouldn’t do anything to hurt him.” Dean relaxed as the words came out of his mouth, and he felt his eyes switch back to green as he seemed to blink for the first time in minutes. He stood for a moment, not sure how to proceed past the awkwardness they suddenly were standing in. “Dean, would you mind letting me free from the wall?” Dean jerked back, for the first time realizing just how close their bodies had been. He hadn’t processed just how close their hips had been to one another while they had been on the edge of fighting one another. He stepped away with a small shrug of apology, moving to lean back against the war table, trying not to show how he felt about their contact and the strangeness in his chest he began to feel at the loss of it.
Focusing back on the matter at hand, Dean did his best to ignore Cas from then on out as they started dividing up the books and trying to make sense of it.
to do anything. We’ve discussed this.” Dean watched as Crowley situated himself back into a proper position on the throne. He could see the contempt there. But he also felt Crowley’s mind turning at the possibilities.
Deep down, he knew what his problem was: without a body to salt and burn, he had no way to truly mourn the loss of the last family he had. He knew it was foolish and crazy, but without a body, he found he still harbored an insane hope that Dean was out there somewhere. Rationally, Sam knew his brother was dead. He had held his lifeless corpse in his arms until long after the flesh had run cold. He had hefted the dead weight of it into Baby for the long drive home.
“Then why are you laughing?”
“Might be nothing, but I thought we might try looking for a pattern.” The three boys leaned in in unison to check what she had discovered. Nothing immediately popped out for Dean. “There was no obvious pattern at first, but then I saw what was directly in the middle of where all the cases supposedly began.” Dean took a closer look before Sam answered the question for him.
He looked down, somehow knowing at that moment how to tell his brain to shut off the part that could now see all of the supernatural wonders, and focused on the physical aspects of the moment. He took them in quick succession, trying hard to comprehend what was now happening.
This time the look that crossed Charlie’s brow was contemplative, “Well, I was just wondering about something is all. I get why you and Sam are still single.” Dean almost took offense, but Charlie laughed and waved her hand at him. “No, I mean why you’ve chosen the bachelor’s life. Hunting doesn’t really let you have a normal relationship, ya know? But I just wondered, if two hunters were attracted to one another, would they stand a chance?” Charlie’s tone had turned serious, but Dean couldn’t help himself.
Dean choked on air. No, really. Air. Because it couldn’t be that he was shocked by what Charlie had just insinuated. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Yeah, yeah, laugh it up, Sammy.”
“Trust me, it was nothing, Cas. I told Crowley I’d take hell if he didn't make the deal. He couldn’t risk that I was serious.”
was the latest stop on his journey,
Dean wasn’t sure why that was significant. “Charlie, people tell the truth all the time. It doesn’t usually lead to death.”
“Well, I guess that makes sense.” She looked like she was literally chewing on the information for a moment, but she asked, “Was it the Mark of Cain? You did die though, didn’t you?” Dean was so shocked by the blatant acceptance that Sam had to respond.
Crowley’s eyes flashed red in warning. His voice shook with undeniable power. “Knight or not, boy, I made you and I can end you!” Dean chuckled at the threat they both knew held no value at this point. He brought up the arm that held the Blade in a quick motion, while Sam watched his brother in awe. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing with his own eyes. Dean seemed so in control of himself that it left Sam dumbfounded. Crowley’s body flew through the air, hitting the brick building hard enough to crack the wall behind him. Dean kept him suspended in the air, several feet from the ground.
Yet there went his brother, no look of dread in his eyes, instead an old playful shimmer that Sam had long thought dead. Dean whispered something to the band before approaching the mic, a deadly prowl in his hips as he walked. He shot a lecherous grin to the waitress as she took his spot on the bar stool. Dean closed his eyes for a moment and looked to be steadying himself. Sam realized his breath was shallow as he waited to see what the demon would do.
He kept his pace slow and steady, letting the tension work itself out of his muscles, even as they began to tighten back up for other reasons. He felt his breath quicken and he smiled a bit. He couldn’t help it, he just loved the feeling of his blood pumping. Other than the taste of pie on his tongue and a full belly, orgasms were probably his favorite feeling.
Sam stood, quickly pacing the length of the table. The hope in his eyes had transformed itself into something much more dangerous, something more unhinged. “But that’s all just a guess, right? It might not be -”
Charlie stepped forward, a look of amused shock on her face. “Oh honey, you can’t be that thick.” Dean shook his head. She couldn’t be thinking that.
The reality of the looks on Sam and Charlie’s face hit Dean hard and he fought to breathe. They were looking at him like he was a monster. There was actual fear back in their eyes. He didn’t blame them, but he couldn’t say it didn’t hurt. He wanted to make them understand that he wasn’t going to hurt them, but when he took a small step forward, he saw Charlie flinch and that did him in. One instant he was there with them, the next he was back in the bunker. He paced his room, trying to sort out exactly what just happened.
When he walked into the hotel room, Charlie was the only one he saw, her head down as she rifled through some papers. The sound of the door closing made her look up and she smiled in the way that said she didn’t have anything new to add.
Sam looked in the general direction of the rooms, before sighing and reminding Cas that he was even there at all. “Ignore him, Cas. We’re both grateful to have you back to full strength.” Cas made a mental note to correct Sam later about that, given that Sam kept talking and not allowing him to speak at this moment. “He did what he thought was right, you can’t fault him for that.” Sam seemed to think of something, but only verbalized a small portion, saying, “Do you think…” Sam raised an eyebrow to Cas, shrugging his shoulders and walking away, leaving Cas to his thoughts.
“So what if I don’t want it.” Dean took a step forward, beginning a slow but deliberate circle around the king, who kept his eyes locked with Dean, neither of them blinking from the other’s eyes. “That’s not the point. What matters is that you do. I have no problem taking hell just because I can, Crowley. And we both know that I can. And will, just to spite you.” Dean pressed in closer, bringing the blade lazily up to point somewhat toward Crowley, remaining on the surface as calm as possible. “You give me what I want, or I
It had been too long since Dean felt like they had a windfall. He was lighter on his feet, laughing along to something Cas had said, watching Sam eat in that peculiar way of his. Dean couldn’t believe it was back to the good old times and they were headed home, back together in the warmth of Baby’s interior, as if she alone protected them from the harsh world around them.
Separated by a mere pane of glass, he stood to stare at a car he would recognize anywhere:
Cas felt his eyes fluttered open as something poured itself down his throat. He only just processed what was happening, screaming out, “Cover your eyes!” He was unsure of whether Dean alone or both Winchesters were near, but he couldn’t risk blinding either of them. Once the grace began to take hold in his chest, he felt power rip through him and heard a light bulb above them pop in the middle of it all. It took mere seconds, but finally, Cas felt it was safe to open his eyes and take in his surroundings. He looked around to find both Winchesters looking at him in concern, though they seemed a bit short for their normal heights. Looking down as he sat up, he noticed he had been laying on the table in the bunker’s war room.
“So, Tom gets forced to tell the truth. Admits something big, like sleeping with the maid, and the Mrs. offs him. Not a bad theory, Cas.” Dean looked back to Charlie. “Were the vics all the ones who were talking too much?”
Sam scoffed, and chuckled as he flipped the sheet over, “You sure, Dean? What if you had to tell the absolute truth about everything?” Dean flipped Sam off and rolled his eyes, but listened as his brother continued. “You’re thinking that they killed
Cas wandered back toward the bunker, feeling discomfort in his chest. Anxiety wracked his body as he waited to hear from Sam, wishing the younger Winchester would keep him up to date. He had wanted to go with him to the bar, help him secure Dean and bring him home. He trusted Sam entirely, it was Dean that was the wild card in all of this. He couldn’t put his finger on it, but he felt something strange when he saw the elder Winchester in the pie shop.
“Oh my god, Castiel!” She bounced over to him and pulled him into a hug, which gave Cas an avenue to give Dean a completely confused look. “I’ve wanted to meet you for so long! I thought you’d be taller though! Chuck got the eyes right, though didn’t he?”
It might seem odd, he knew that other demons had seemed thrown if they heard, but Dean had not set a toe back into Hell since he had died. Since Cas pulled him out of the pit, actually. But he knew that the only possible solution was currently down in the depths and for Cas, he would go where he hated.
He of course still missed all those that had been lost since the beginning. But their loss had become a manageable ache, rather than a throbbing that never ceased to have him on the verge of sinking to his knees.
Sam’s arm froze as he went to take another swig. “What do you mean, ‘no’?”
Charlie kept chattering away as the four of them slowly started making their way into the bunker, and Dean couldn’t help leaning over to Sam as they walked behind, whispering, “Why do I feel like those two are going to be the death of us?” Sam said nothing response, just laughing freely as they went inside.
“And you forget what makes me who I am.” Dean’s voice turned deadly and Sam watched as the First Blade seemed to materialize within his brother’s grasp. “I may be a demon. A Knight of Hell, to be precise. I would have to be dead not to notice certain upgrades I seem to have been gifted with.” Dean flexed his neck and shoulders, as if he were loosening himself up for a good old-fashioned schoolyard brawl.
And that was the moment when Sam began to wonder whether his brother would be better off remaining in his new state of existence. He just seemed so free and happy, more so than Sam could ever remember. It hurt Sam to think he would end the happiness Dean had found, as well as to know it had taken becoming a demon for Dean to finally be happy.
brother. Dean wasn’t meant to be a demon. He was a hunter, deep down to the core of his soul. He wouldn’t want to ever be left in this state; no matter the cost it would present to remove him from it. Sam knew Dean would approve of his plan, if the tables had been turned around. His gut pushed him out of the chair he sat in, leaving him to abandon his untouched and wilted salad.
“I get that, Charlie. It’s been a bit crazy on my side too.”
Sammy had found him. How he had missed that Moose of a man in here, he would never be able to say. Sam turned towards him at that moment and Dean felt his eyes shift to black. His breath caught in his throat as he forced his eyes back to their natural green. While many in the bar knew what he was, he continued to play it safe, a lifetime of hunting being hard to break. He knew he should head off the stage and confront the spiritual demons in the room, but for the first time since the night he had died, he actually felt fear. He had avoided this confrontation for as long as he could, and now that his brother had tracked him down, he wasn’t ready to face him.
“Though I have to say I am surprised. I thought a Winchester would be a better fight than this.” She gave a small shrug before continuing. “Humans are so very breakable, aren’t they, Castiel?”
“Pissed is what I am.” Cas heard a clattering as the First Blade left the floor where it had fallen when Dean had first been thrown, and returned to Dean’s hand. For the first time since Dean had died, Cas witnessed Dean straighten himself fully, extending himself into his demon attributes. His eyes were black as he flicked his gaze quickly to the three of them before returning to focus on the goddess before him.
Sam felt Crowley’s shoulder shift to strike, but a familiar clearing of a throat gave him pause. As Crowley glanced over his shoulder to the newcomer, Sam’s heart leapt with an unfathomable hope, believing his brother was finally coming to save him from the demented agony Crowley was making his personal vendetta to dish upon him. However, as Crowley stepped back to reveal his handiwork to Dean, Sam’s stomach sank, his heart faltering. Dean’s eyes were cold and menacing. He felt the weight of it come crashing down on him, and he sank down into the psychic grip the nameless demons held on him. There was no doubt in his soul that Crowley’s words were spot on.
Sam’s gaze drifted back to the stage as the music ended, meeting his brother’s face for the first time in just under a month. His stomach dropped as brown eyes met endless black.
Dean stepped into the bathroom, dropping his towel over the bar next to the shower. He couldn’t help the smile that took over his lips. He loved his shower. There was nothing like the water pressure here in the bunker, and Dean made sure to never say anything bad about the old place within earshot, just in case it really was magic keeping the old girl running. Didn’t want to risk pissing her off and losing his one little piece of heaven here on earth.
He waved at her general direction to quiet her before trying something. What he planned to say was
“If no one has any objections, I’d like to sing one more.” While he hadn’t been looking for their approval, he found a healthy amount of enthusiasm sent his way, even hearing a catcall from the kitchen. He looked back to Sam again, just as the music began to play. “This one goes out to my little brother.”
“Don’t threaten me with a good time.” Dean’s eyes never left his brother’s face as he threw one last insult at the demon’s back. He portrayed a perfect picture of boredom, which Sam knew would only anger the King more. Sam knew it was all a facade, however, sensing the tension that boiled just below the surface of his brother’s skin. He was poised and ready to strike at a moment’s notice.
“So he just let you come home? What about the cure?” Cas held him there, uncertainty and a bit of anger in his tone. Dean tried to keep himself calm, knowing he was to blame for Cas’s current mood. He would feel the same if Cas suddenly looked like a walking puffball of evil. He couldn’t blame Cas for the reaction, but he would have to talk him down if they were going to be able to move forward.
Charlie gave a mix of a grin and grimace. He gave the redhead some points for trying to look remorseful about his suffering. “I think lying isn’t the key here. I think you can’t lie about
. He was the demon, Sam.” Cas paused, allowing Sam time to process the information.
Aphrodite laughed at Dean and his soul definitely gave away his anger at the nonchalant arrogance the goddess presented. It twisted and spiked around Dean like fire. “You foolish little humans and your threats. Do you think you can just kill a goddess? When we’re done here, you’ll be dead.” She paused, looking back at the three of them, throwing a taunt back over her shoulder. “But I’ll kill your friends first so you can watch.” She started to look back toward Dean. “Won’t that be-“ Her words were cut off as Dean charged her, throwing a punch that connected with her jaw. Cas waited for her to throw him again, but she caught him around the throat.
“Of course you would think that.” Dean didn’t wait for Cas to process that before he vanished, expertly teleporting to his room in a way of escape.
In his anger at their foolishness, he almost didn’t register that he didn’t see them anywhere. He shook it off, heading into the last factory, telling himself that there would be nothing inside and he didn’t need to worry. Of course, he was always wrong about that sort of thing.
“So, they’re just killing each other?”
Sam didn’t wait to be seated, but instead strode past the hostess station with determination - that is until he spotted his target at the bar ahead.
“Anything new?” Sam asked, putting the beer in the mini-fridge between the beds while Dean tried to keep his mind off anything that might incriminate him in his current state.
“Dean? What- How did-”
He brought the bottle to his lips, but the warm liquid did little to soothe the hurt inside him tonight. For some reason, the skunky flavor of it felt like the final stab to his gut. With a broken outcry of anguish, Sam threw the still mostly full bottle at the radio. The glass shattered, but the now soaked radio kept on playing, taunting him. Sam finally did what he had not done since the night his brother had passed.
be you. I swear we gotta find this thing before your head explodes.”
“The only person I interacted with was the bartender, but I watched her make the drinks. She didn’t roofie me or anything.”
With Dean gone and his belly continuously filled with sugary confections, Cas allowed himself to accept that he had loved the elder Winchester. It had been slowly growing inside him since he had pulled Dean from perdition those many years ago, but it burned inside him now like a wildfire. Small signs of it had littered their time together, evidence to Cas of his feelings for the hunter. But he had chosen to ignore them all, reminding himself that Dean would never return his interest.
The guy on the karaoke stage was butchering some Kenny Chesney hit, which seemed to leave Dean no choice but to heckle him into oblivion. But even Sam had to admit that, demon or not, there was no malice in Dean’s actions. He was just a guy in a bar, having the time of his life. Dean simply looked, for lack of a better term, free.
His first few days as a demon had been relatively quiet, but eventually an old follower of Abbadon’s had come for Crowley. As per the usual for the King, Dean had been left to do his dirty work. Fearing the worst, he had taken down the demon with more ease than he cared to admit. That was when he had found his complete acceptance of his new state. Without the lust of The Mark, he ironically felt more human than he had in a long time.
“It’s time we hit the road for a hunt.”
The building was mostly empty, some scattered machinery and parts strewn against the far wall being the only thing in the open space. That and his three dumbasses tied to chairs and gagged. He cursed under his breath as he surveyed the area as quickly as possible before crossing the space and cutting all their ropes quickly with the First Blade. Sam’s hands flew to his face as soon as they were free, but he didn’t get his warning out in time.
As he stepped back into the bunker, he tried to attribute the strangeness to seeing Dean’s soul so warped beyond recognition, but he knew that wasn’t it. He still saw Dean, the name he once pulled from the depths of hell, still saw the righteous man. But that was what he thought was maybe the issue of it all. He had expected to feel different, to see nothing of the man he knew. But Dean had seemed so much the same that Cas’s skin had seemed to be on fire from just being near him. He wanted to run to his then, but he had known nothing good would have come of it.
“Like if I ask how you feel about my hair?” Dean could hear the grin in Sam's voice but he could stop what came out of his mouth.
“Wait.” She pleaded with him as he pinned her high on the wall. He hadn’t even noticed his feet leaving the ground, but he now suspended both of them in the air, his hand wrapped around her throat. “Killing me won’t end the spell.” Dean paused, waiting for her pitiful attempt to weasel her way out of this. “You tell the angel the truth and you’re free. Or you release me and I’ll let you out of it.” She looked nervous, even scared. But Dean didn’t even give it time to sink in before giving her his answer.
he heard him whisper.
Cas stepped back into the blackness , tearfully looking up at Dean, finally extricating himself from his grasp.
'Cas?' He grabbed the angel's coat. 'Cas! Don't do this--I don't... understand! '
'The..... the Empty?' Dean felt coldness spreading through him, mingling with the painful heat of his stomach.
If Cas was here, then-
'I don't...understand. I was a good guy!' he grabbed the front of Cas' jacket desperately.
'Hey.'
He was lying on the floor in a dark room.
Dean didn't know what was going on inside him- his head was swimming and his chest hurt and Cas' hands were like ice but he knew he couldn't let go because-
He didn't know what happened but he felt a piercing pain in his head and someone was yelling, yelling-
Cas turned away slightly, before holding out a hand to Dean. Dean took it and pulled himself up, surveying the completely bare, dark room that they were in.
This wasn't supposed to happen. He was supposed to die of old age and go to heaven and drive his car through sunrise-lit golden forests.
'There's always a reason,' he said quietly, looking straight at Dean, 'that people end up  here.'
'No, Cas. You're
'I love you.'
'-I can't lose you, Cas!'
They were looking at each other then, and Dean broke.
'-Let go, Dean-'
he whispered.
'I love you, Cas!' Dean said again, yelling this time, needing desperately for him to hear, to call him back from the Empty.
He groaned and sat up against the wall, a sharp pain in his abdomen that was growing worse as he moved.
He didn't know what he was saying anymore, screaming at Cas now, screaming for him, barely able to hear himself over the nauseating hum of the black haze swarming around his Cas.
'Dean!'
He could barely see Cas' shadowy face.
But now Dean was shaking, the cold fear in the room cutting him to the bone as he looked at Cas.
He was still holding Cas' jacket, and wisps of darkness were beginning to appear, abstract patterns forming, randomly reminding Dean of some science experiment he had done with magnesium or something stupid in grade school.
'You don't.'
Dean blinked unconprehendingly, staring into the shadowed face of Castiel.
He looked at Cas, and saw the face that had told him he loved him before being swallowed by darkness. The face of a friend-
'The Empty, Cas?
He strode forward to his friend, who was simply standing, watching him, his expression so painfully sad Dean felt his chest constrict, hurting, his breathing growing shallow.
Cas placed his hand on top of Dean's stilling him. The sorrow was radiating from him in waves that crashed into Dean's heart like a vengeful ocean.
Then he was crumpled on the floor and Cas was laying on top of him and they were frozen, watching as the swirling blackness turned grey and suddenly he couldn't see anything for a moment, only feeling Cas' icy cold hand in his.
