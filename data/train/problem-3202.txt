with the joy of creation. He’d spent his whole life trying to make up for his human weaknesses with hunter tricks, spells, and whatever else he could get his hands on, but...just being a plain ol’ human? Man, it had never been more fun!
“Yeah, well,” Dean swallowed, heart still racing, eyes flicking back and forth between the angel next to him, and the coffee in his hand, “It’s, ah. Not something I tell
“You’re USING UP my EMPTY!” shouted the Empty through gritted teeth, becoming less Cas-like and more amorphous as it spoke, “My last
The taller guy had three popped seams, and the mop of hair framing his face was certainly not a professional haircut.
“Jack needs me,” Cas said simply, “I am sorry to go so soon. But rest assured that I will do all in my power to spend as much time on Earth with you as possible, Dean, for the rest of your human lifespan.”
Dean watched curiously as neither of them moved to touch the other, for a moment or two. Eileen’s little stint as a noncorporeal spirit was clearly weighing in the empty space between them.
As he walked away from his manifested lamps, the darkness enveloped him once more, leaving nothing but the little glowy bits to light his way. He still had no idea what the hell they were, but they didn’t seem immediately malevolent, so...they could stay. Their presence was comforting, in a way, in contrast to the unnerving absence of literally anything else. They reminded him of fireflies, quivering in the air on a warm summer night. Or how the stars looked, out the window of his last ill-fated airplane trip.
, that they could have had each other, for all that time. But Sam just looks at him with that dark, sad gaze, and all he says is, "Are you ready?"
Gabriel is perched on the couch, petting the little owl and swinging his sword around in complicated patterns. He brought Dean the colt, along with a ridiculous amount of ammunition that Dean has no idea where he got it from. He’d said something about time travel and also handed Dean a thin blade that looked like it shouldn’t exist, like it was made of shadow and light. It sings when he turns it in his hand and from the way Cas looks at him when he has it, he thinks he knows where it came from.
"I am sorry, Gabriel," Castiel says back in their language, he's already started a fight in this kitchen; he does not want another one.
He’d debated trying to let Cas down gently but every time the angel so much as looked at him he got all fucking tongue tied like puberty wasn’t some fifteen odd years ago. This was not making the tension with Gabriel any easier.
Sam doesn’t have a chance to process that, all he hears is Zachariah muttering, “You left…” and then Gabriel snaps his fingers.
Cas is already backing towards the panic room with Elle in his arms as Anna looks out the window. Bobby has stiffened as everyone goes on fucking red alert. Dean goes to Cas and looks down at Elle, who is just silent, clutching her lion and Castiel's tie. She's hushed, matching her father's stare out the front window.
Castiel's eyes flicker to the darkened bedroom window where he'd left Dean and smiles, remembering his
It's a nice day and if Sam just looked at the landscape and eased back against the house he could almost imagine that his brother and an angel weren't having a shouting match loud enough to bring the walls down behind him. Bobby had long since tuned them out and was working on a doze in his chair while the baby, Elle, sat in Sam's lap and seemed content with her bottle. This was well... pretty much as good as it got.
Dean groans softly, letting his head fall back. Cas' finger moves inside him, hot and slick, setting a easy pace that Dean's hips match. "What is that?" Dean slurs, heat pooling in his stomach.
Castiel opens the door, but it's not a housekeeper standing outside. It's the man with the crossword, the one from the diner.
With Dean's soul blocked, he hadn't needed to hold back his awareness or worry about skirting the currents of Dean's soul. There was no danger of accidentally perceiving any of Dean's thoughts or reactions—the sigil blocked almost everything, letting only brief blips of the very strongest emotions out.
Castiel is on the dock again. He turns his head to the left and sure enough, there is Dean, sitting on an identical dock ten feet away, staring out at the silvery water. Dean is alone this time, no malicious dream iteration there to strangle him, and Castiel finds himself smiling as he watches the way Dean tips his head back, the way the soft light plays on his face. Castiel turns his head in the other direction and there the dream-Castiel is, right next to him, so close their shoulders are almost brushing.
He kicks his bedroom door shut behind him and looks down at the glass in his hand for a moment. Then he throws it across the room. It shatters against the wall and maybe Sam will hear and come running and maybe he won't. Dean locks the door, just in case. Then he unscrews the cap on the whiskey and lifts it to his mouth and drinks, huge burning gulps that sear his throat and curdle in his stomach. He drinks and drinks and it isn't until a third of the bottle is gone that he finally lowers it and realizes his face is wet and his hands are shaking.
"I really don't care what you have to bargain with," says the Empty in that awful parody of Cas's voice. "I should kill you right now. But as it happens,
It's not—fury, exactly, welling up under his skin, on his tongue. It's something else, a torrent of grief and longing and the sudden desperation to be
Dean snaps his head around. Sam holds his gaze, smiles crookedly for a moment, just a little. It's an expression that Dean has seen before, so many times, on Sam's face, and maybe he just never admitted to himself what it meant, what it was trying to transmit, until now. He wonders if
Dean braces his arms on the floor on either side of Cas's face and looks up to watch as, mere feet away, the other tendril makes contact with Billie. As it simply—dissolves her. Covers her, absorbs her into itself, retracts with her.
Around him, under his feet, above his head, there's darkness. Impenetrable and inky. A darkness so absolute it seems solid, so that when he lifts his hand he's almost surprised he's able to move it through the void around him.
Cas blinks. “Dean, I should tell you...the books in Death’s library, they don’t hold endings, anymore. I’ve checked them all. All of the fated endings—they vanished after Chuck was defeated.”
Dean moves his hands to the front of Cas's t-shirt and twists them into the fabric, swinging Cas around as the angel's wings flare out for balance. He shoves Cas against the nearest available non-fallen tree and kisses him, hard.
"Because you—" Sam starts, and stops. He swallows. "Because," he says carefully, "because Chuck's gone, Dean. And—and I know how Eileen felt, okay? I know she was worried about what was—about what was real. But Chuck's
The kitsune girl steps forward. Dean stares at her, bewildered. She isn't looking at him—she's looking down at the angel on the table, her eyes unreadable. She reaches out and puts a palm on Cas's arm.
"Yes," says Dean. His voice is haunted. Castiel can barely hear him, over the silent pounding in his own ears.
Raz drops into a crouch. "And yet you were on your own when we brought you in," he muses. "And you've been rotting in this cell for days, without so much as a rescue attempt."
"Don't," Dean chokes, his limbs rattling in uncontrolled panic as his head is forced back. Castiel stares out of Dean's eyes at the grease-stained ceiling of the trailer, and then his eyes shut just in time, and a wet substance is spilling onto them, stinging the skin. It dries almost instantly and Castiel feels—he
He makes up his mind and with an easy movement, he slips his other arm behind Dean's knees and straightens, lifting Dean in his arms. He hears Dean's startled exhale, feels Dean's fingers momentarily tighten over his shoulders, Dean's body vibrating with tension as Castiel strides towards the exit. Castiel can still catch the muted roiling of Dean's soul, its ragged fear and uncertainty, the pain from the wounds Castiel couldn't heal. But Dean is alive—Dean is
"Careful," says Castiel automatically, worried the sudden motion will aggravate the wounds, unbandaged as they are. Dean lets go immediately, yanking his hand back as if burned and pulling it tightly against his midriff. Castiel misses the touch instantly, but chides himself for the feeling; it seems perilously too close to taking advantage of Dean somehow, of his need for comfort in this weakened state.
—and then Dean is arching his back, gasping out a ragged breath that unspools from the base of his chest all the way out into the open air, because Cas has his jeans open, has his hand down Dean's boxers and curling around Dean's—
The last spark of his grace is lodged deep in the core of him, sutured into his being. Castiel seizes it and
." He spreads his arms wide, derision curling his lip, while his soul spits a black self-loathing as caustic as lye.
Dean almost laughs at that. Because he could just shrug and say that he hopes he does. He could just say that they don't have a choice. But the fact is that Dean trained under Alastair. Dean spent a decade learning how to do this and he knows
There'd been gaps in his feathers, before—old injuries he was too weak to heal after he fell from Heaven's favor, as well as areas where the feathers had simply disintegrated as too much stolen grace chewed through his true form. Then, too, the remnant of his own grace, once he'd finally reclaimed it, had been paltry; he'd been unable to reconstitute his true form without additional losses, so that was more feathers broken or destroyed, sacrificed to Metatron's spell.
. Because I want to. Because I've tortured every sort of person who walked under the sun but I've never...
"How could you not know how I felt about you?" says Dean, and it feels like freedom, to demand this. To sketch the shape of this in the afternoon air in front of him, even if he can't bring himself to pin it down yet. "You know everything about me, Cas. How could you not know
Benny snorts. “Everything in a fifty-mile radius felt that portal open up, even if most probably didn’t recognize what it was. Now, your angel, on the other hand—
"Child's play with you so near, even before I'd pinpointed the exact location. Really stupid of you not to leave this place immediately. But then, I imagine you thought you were safe."
“Uh,” says Dean, inwardly cursing Sam’s ability to hone in on emotional distress like a goddamn bloodhound. “Yeah. I mean, haven’t really talked to him. Since.”
Castiel drops his eyes, feeling his breath hitch. The Winchesters are coming, he reminds himself. They've been through too much together for him to doubt the depth of their loyalty. They
Sam sets his jaw. He looks deeply unhappy, and deeply stubborn. Dean winces, because it's extremely evident that whatever Sam has to say, it's going to be said and there's nothing Dean can do to avoid it.
Cas fits his hands against Dean's hips. Digs his thumbs in a little, a touch that sends a spark through every cell of Dean's body. "What, Dean," he rumbles into the hollow of Dean's throat. "What do you want?"
"Dean." Sam twists his hands together on the table. He shoves his stupid bangs out of his face. "I know. What—what you had to do. When we were kids. What you did, for me. For us."
The sound of conversation and laughter floats faintly toward them from the direction of the house. They walk out of the shed together, into the afternoon sunlight.
He could kick himself for how inadequate the words are. He stares like he can sear Cas into his brain, overwrite the memory of Cas being swallowed up by the Empty, those few scant seconds that are going to haunt him forever.
Sam, predictably, ruins it with an awkward throat-clearing that Dean has unfortunately learned over the years always heralds an Uncomfortable Discussion. He opens his mouth to say good night and make his escape, but Sam beats him to it.
Dean will become the sword he was built and born to be, and not to save the world or to destroy Lucifer.
," says Cas, and Dean realizes, too late, that Cas is doing what he always does. That Cas is throwing himself on the sword. Giving himself up for Dean. Sacrificing himself again as if—as if Dean is going to survive this without him, as if anything is going to matter at the end of this fight if Cas isn't there on the other side.
Gadreel shrugs. "Perhaps; perhaps not. Who can say if the angels will ever be restored to what we once were?"
voice send a little spark of heat all the way down to Dean’s groin, but pie is important enough that he masters himself and swats Cas’s questing hand away.
"Please. He's been..." Castiel flails momentarily for an explanation that won't seem alarming. "Lonely. He's had a...a rough couple months, and he could use..."
Castiel plummets through a brief and sudden darkness, Dean falling away from him. He expects to wake with Dean on the bed in the motel room, but instead his feet impact something solid and he rocks and blinks and looks around him in surprise.
"I...don't know," says Cas, wonderingly. "I...I didn't think you could. I didn't think there was a way."
Cas reacts immediately, one hand twisting into the front of Dean's jacket as he kisses back, his tongue bumping Dean's as he opens his mouth into the kiss, his palm warm and insistent against Dean's jawline.
," Dean exhales, the words punched out of him, and he hooks his arm around the back of Cas's neck. Drags Cas toward him.
"Hon, relax." She shrugs out of her jacket, heads directly for Dean, heated interest very evident in her gaze. "I'm here for
“No offense taken,” says Benny mildly. He turns to Eileen. “I don’t have any love for Eve. Let’s just say her leadership style don’t sit right with me, maybe leave it at that. T’be honest, not all the leviathan are loyal to Eve, either. Most
"Cas," Dean blurts, even as Corin drags him towards the door. He turns his head, blind panic written over his face. His chin is smeared with his own blood; his lips are bright with it. "Cas, please, don't let him, don't let him take me, Cas, please, don't."
!” someone yells from off-screen, and Donna’s forehead fills the feed for a moment. “Merry Christmas, you guys!”
"My choice?" Dean forces out, with numb lips. He pushes himself to his feet, stumbles backward from the table, from Sam. "My
Cas's breaths are hitching—just shy of being sobs, his bare chest juddering shallowly—and Dean thinks distantly that if angels can go into shock Cas is almost certainly in shock, and they should get him a blanket, or some
"Just—just kill me. I'm done. I can't—let me take my wings back, and you can kill me, I don't care—"
This close, Dean can see the ragged patches, festering sores where the flesh is being corroded away, and he can see many of Cas's remaining feathers are dull and ragged. A spike of anger goes through Dean; he forgets about how blank the wings are and what that means—he's furious at whoever would hurt Cas like this.
Dean reaches out blindly, fumbling until his fingers bump against Castiel's nose and cheek. He splays them out on Castiel's face, runs them lightly along Castiel's brow and temple. Dean's jaw trembles. His hand is shaking. His soul contracts in on itself, the already-faint pulse of it dwindling even further to Castiel's perception.
Dean feels a soft laugh burst from his chest. There's a lump in his throat. "Hey," he says. "Hey, Cas, yeah. Yeah."
Dean looks back down on him, understanding clear in his eyes, in the trembling line of his mouth. "Three months," he rasps.
"Dean," he says, the word a rasp. Of course it's a rasp. Cas screamed himself hoarse while Dean cut him open on this table. Cas's blood is still pooled on the varnished pine, on the white tiles below. In the creases below Dean's nails. Dean wants to throw up.
Castiel lunges forward and is met with invisible resistance, the air thickening to impassability at the edge of his dock, keeping him from leaping into the dark water, crossing the space. He hammers at the unseen force. "Dean!"
Dean tries to speak, finds that his mouth is far too dry to create sounds. He swallows, tries again. "Hey, Cas."
. Castiel tips his head back, exposing the lovely clean line of his throat, and groans. Dean rocks his hips gently, then harder. Castiel groans again, softer, and his hand flits up to lightly cup Dean's chin.
“No, I just found out,” says Cas. “There’s a lot I still don’t know, about—all of this. It’s difficult.”
Castiel blinks, taken by surprise. The only illumination is now the faint pearly light that filters in through the blinds, though he would be able to see perfectly well even without it. He isn't sure what normal human protocol for a power outage is. In any case, he doesn't have much of a chance to react before there's a gasp and a set of muffled thuds from the bathroom.
"I don't know, improvise," Michael says icily. "Isn't that what the two of you are best at? We’re close by—you only have to manage a short time on your own."
, says Michael from up by the ceiling, his true voice breaking every piece of glass in the Bunker. Michael arrows down in a column of light and Dean Winchester lights up like the weapon he was, it seems, always destined to be.
Eventually he realizes that the sky through the window behind him is getting darker, not lighter. The air pressure shifts and there's a tingling on his skin, a faint trickle of static making the hairs on his arm stand on end. When he peers through the blinds, he sees that the sky is darkening ominously, with thunderclouds gathering in dense droves on the horizon. The trees on the other side of the parking lot sway violently in a strong wind, heralds of the impending storm.
, Dean thinks, stealing a glance over his shoulder at the various planes and angles of Castiel's body, the unkempt tangles of his feathery-dark hair. Just not while the dude is sleeping, is all. And since (regardless of how often Dean's fantasized about it) there's no way an
“You put us back in, we’ll fight our way out,” Sam says breathlessly. His eyes blaze; his fists are clenched.
"You know," says Dean, as the waitress bustles off, "you might have a better attitude about late-night grave-digging if you knew there was a reward at the end of it."
Castiel pauses. "I've been alone before," he says. "I went on some hunts, on my own. I never..." He swallows. "I never stopped looking for you, Dean. I didn't always have hope that I would find you, but I never—"
Castiel nods, careful not to dislodge Dean's palm. He shies away from the thought of—of Dean holding Castiel's head in his lap, listening to Castiel breathe, watching him sleep—it makes something warm and fizzing unfurl in his chest, a fluttering feeling that he can't unstitch from the mortal ebb and flow of his body.
the presence of Cas's wings, feel the buffet of air as Cas raises them, feel raindrops splashing off the feathers and onto his arms. He's pretty sure his jaw is hanging open.
And he'd be lying if he told himself he hasn't imagined this too—in his bed, in the dark, in dreams, in the privacy of the Bunker shower. He tilts his head up to look at Cas, who is staring down at him with a crackling mixture of reverence and desire.
Sam blanches, even as he pulls the angel blade out. "Dean—we can take him back to the Bunker, we can find out what this is—"
Dean freezes, his whole body going rigid, and then he melts forward into the kiss, his whole body relaxing into Castiel. For one glorious moment their mouths and bodies are slotted against each other, Dean furnace-hot and yielding under Castiel's touch, the taste of him electrifying, and Castiel wonders, with a kind of savage joy, why he didn't do this hours or
"I—" Castiel chokes. "I—he—" Out of the corner of his eye, he can see comprehension dawning on Dean's face, and the elder Winchester tightens his arm around him. Castiel forces himself to raise his head and look Sam in the eye, afraid of what he might find there. He can guess at some of the things Raz might have said to Sam, and none of them are good. But Sam meets his gaze evenly, his expression neutral except for a faint crease of worry on his brow, and he directs his next words to Castiel, "Thought you'd like to see his corpse."
The dagger blazes gold, under his palm. Dean sighs and lifts his hand to at last scrub it across his face. His knuckles come away damp.
“Dude, I don’t know.” Dean beats a staccato rhythm against the steering wheel with his palm, and laughs again.
Dean snorts bitterly. "We'll see what you think a month from now when you still have to carry my crippled ass everywhere."
—and the shot goes wide. The leviathan grabs the front of Sam’s shirt, drags him halfway off his knees with inhuman strength. “
"I know," says Dean. "And yeah, you're right, I would've done the same. I just—Cas, I was afraid. I was
After presents and washing all the dishes and finishing their pie and tidying up the war room—which didn’t take very long as the elves, in addition to reuniting the door with its hinges, had also magicked the tree and popcorn strings and even Jack’s gingerbread abomination back into a passable semblance of intactness—they eventually end up in the rec room with a pot of cocoa and the last of the craft beers.
"Come on, Dean," says Coren again. "Bare for me, now." He glances at Castiel. "Or watch the angel burn."
"Get your lighter," Sam barks, emptying a bottle of something viscous and golden—cooking oil?—over the thing. Thank god Sam is keeping his head, because Dean's incapable of doing more than following basic orders right now—he keeps staring at the eel, at its gnashing rotary of teeth, teeth that were
"I—I know you know a lot about me," says Dean quietly. He lowers his hands, curls them loosely into fists. "I know you know—what I did in Hell."
Dean stares at the blade, swallows convulsively, takes it. He holds it for a moment, his expression strained. "I want—" he says, and stops.
Cas makes a small, pleased sound and straightens up. Dean chances a look and sees that the blood is gone—and the rip in the shirt, too, which is a nice bonus, because...honestly, it looks really good on Cas, and on some other evening when they’re not being besieged by armed woodland fairies he would like to see how good it looks coming
Cas, as it turns out, has bought everyone socks. He makes a circuit of the room, handing out lumpy hosiery with giant balls of knitted footwear shoved into the toes.
The gravity of Gadreel's declaration sinks into Sam, and he has to sit and breathe for a moment, overwhelmed. He realizes that he's blinking back tears.
Silvery-white grace glimmers weakly around the blade, but after the first few incisions there's mostly just blood. It gushes from the wound, through his fingers and over Cas's twitching body onto the table, and Dean ignores it, works through it. He doesn't think about what he's doing to the body of his best friend; he doesn't think about what must be going through Sam's head, watching this. He cuts through the layers of tissue and peels them back one by one, the skin, the yellow fat, the red muscle, until—until—
“Why should we trust you?” Dean demands. He can’t shake the memory of Michael—real or not—looking at Chuck with such worshipful hunger, such eagerness to please. “Why would

When he raises his head he half expects to see charred lines on his chest, but around the ooze his skin appears perfectly untouched. And yet—it
"If we can remember them, it's real." He grips Sam's arms. "Okay, Sammy? It's not just us. It's not."
"I don't think you need to put anything on them," says Dean around a mouthful of noodles. "They aren't infected, I don't think." He shovels more soup into his mouth.
"Alright, let's be off," says Corin, suddenly brisk. He wipes his mouth on the back of his hand and grabs Dean's shoulder, yanking him to his feet. Dean goes without protest. He sways on his feet, his skin still deathly pale, and Castiel realizes that the feeding wasn't
"No," says Dean. "Hell, the real Hell. You pulled me out of the real Hell, too." There's something almost like wonder in his eyes. "I never thanked you."
Castiel's eyes pop open again. He isn't suspended in the eternal void, after all. He's lying on his stomach in a warm bed, and the dimness is the pillow he's face-down on. He turns his head slowly, wincing as the movement sends pain lancing through his—
Sam’s phone is bursting a flurried series of chimes. Sam swipes at the screen, covers his mouth with his free hand. “Dean,” he croaks, hushed. “Eileen, she just texted me—and Donna, too—Bobby, Charlie, Stevie, Jody—everyone's
Cas actually cracks a tired smile at that, his eyes drifting half-shut. "That's a good one. Not very original, though."
"Yeah, Cas." Dean grips Cas tighter, clenching at the fabric of Cas's coat. "God, I thought I'd...I thought I'd never..."
,” Dean snaps tersely. He watches Sam’s barely-there flinch and curses himself internally for raising his voice—he knows Sam is only stating the obvious because they’re all still reeling from the situation. It’s not like
Dean can't think. He can't breathe. He gets the door open and stumbles out of the car, trying not to be sick.
,” Chuck spits, and snaps his fingers. The air around him vibrates with power, and Dean feels something invisible blitz past him like a searing desert wind.
Cas shivers again, his hands coming up to clutch at Dean's arms in return. "I thought you would be disgusted," he confesses. "I thought you were—that you'd think—"
of them—is hot and swollen under his fingers. He curses himself for not having any first aid supplies on hand, but then, how could he have known he would need them?
"You changed me, Dean," Cas is saying through tears. Dean tries to think. Tries to make sense of what is happening, through a burgeoning haze of panic.
Dean wonders if he, too, looks different to Cas. If the afterlife has smoothed out some kind of tiredness from him as well, left a clearing for something else to be built.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. "To hide me, and keep me from dying. So that—so that they'll never lose me. They'll keep me forever. To drink from, forever." His mouth trembles and he presses his lips together, a narrow line.
Dean lets out his breath in a soft gasp. Those dreadful smears of black give his face the illusion of eyes, peering through the dark. Castiel squeezes Dean's hand, then lets it go. He waits.
"I should make you beg for it," Raz muses, working efficiently now, finishing first one arm and then the other. "Oh well." He winks, hooks a finger through the belt loop of Castiel's slacks. "Maybe next time."
"The sooner we get supplies the sooner we can move. The weather is good enough to make the drive back to—" Castiel hesitates.
Out of options, Castiel does the only thing he can; he clears his mind, shuts it down as best as he can and drifts in a hazy semiconscious state, riding slow waves of pain through the slowly dragging hours. It's a poor respite, and it doesn't last long. Another illusion of Dean arrives, slipping into the cell and sinking to its knees in front of him, hands held out but at a distance, as if afraid to touch Castiel, to reveal itself for what it is.
Michael’s stance changes minutely—a subtle shift of the shoulders, of the carriage of his head, and then it’s Adam who says, gentle, “Maybe not. But maybe we should start fighting for it anyway.”
"Hang on pal," he mutters. He reaches for Cas's limp hand, the fingers of which are about the same temperature as the water around them. "We're gonna get you out of—"
, Sam." Dean's face feels hot. He clenches one hand into the meat of his thigh. "I'm not—that. That isn't—that's not how I—I don't—because I would

...you saw what I had done and you didn't hate me for it. You could have cast me out at that moment, yet you did not. Not because you wanted my help, but because you saw my hurt. And I realized then that there could be no greater honor for any angel under the sun than to heal Sam Winchester."
The kitsune girl who'd helped them kill McGinnis is waiting in the basement when they struggle back through the trap door, Cas a dead weight between them. She covers her mouth with one hand as Cas comes fully into view.
,” Dean interrupts. “You don’t want us dead? You want us suffering for the rest of time? That’s fine. We’ll live in your game. Do whatever the fuck you like, and we’ll let you. Just
, he thinks Naomi would call it. A predictable flaw, a predictable reaction to something angels are supposed to be above, because Castiel is now broken in predictable ways, and the cracks in him can be extrapolated from Dean outwards.
"You must be new to the game, sweetheart. Always burn the body. My brain was just fine. Spinal cord, arteries?" He shrugs. "Not so hard to regenerate, especially when one has...precautions in place."
nothing, who has never been anything to most and perhaps not even to Dean—Castiel whose innumerable sacrifices and sins are similarly reduced nothing in the face of Dean's final, greatest sacrifice here and now—Castiel will let Dean go, because he must, but he will not watch.
, dude, they're freaking incredible—I mean, I can see what the dicks upstairs did to them, too, and that's awful, I had no idea, you must be in so much pain, I can't believe you didn't say anything. But they're beautiful."
!” Dean yells, and he dodges another blow and launches himself over the map table, vaulting across it in a way that’s definitely going to hurt tomorrow. The elf that stabbed Cas looks up just in time to take a scimitar hilt to the temple; they drop like a sack of potatoes and Dean drops only slightly more gracefully to his knees next to Cas.
“Thought you said we ain’t in the business of getting what we deserve,” says Dean tightly. He tries to ignore the lump rising in his throat at the mention of Cas’s name.
"Sam," Dean yells, frantically. Embers rain down around them—the earth around the blast zone is scorched black, a molten spot marking the spot where Chuck had been standing. "Sam, remember! We have to—"
Examining the sigils with renewed vigor, he still fails to recognize them. The symbols winding through the patterns, however, are ancient Greek, easy enough to read.
Dean has a pretty good idea of what said conversation is going to entail and he’s not in the mood to have it with
"Yeah, no kidding." Dean does a little half-turn, tugging at his jeans. "How'd you guess the sizes? You'd better not have been creeping through my laundry, Cas."
Dean opens his eyes, and his pulse is suddenly deafeningly loud, speeding up like a train gaining momentum.
"Not to my knowledge," Castiel admits. The itching has eased; he recognizes it now as coming from the new feathers, trapped as they'd been under the tight gauze, and almost laughs out of sheer joy. He curves his wings overhead, a canopy above him and Dean. "But you and I, we seem to make a habit of being unprecedented, don't we?"
“When you absorbed Amara, you set your own end in motion. This world didn't come into being until the two of you split apart—what do you think will happen now that you've joined again, for the first time since creation?"
"Fantastic," says Castiel. He half-turns, then pauses. "Oh, practice is pretty intense this week, there's a slight chance I'll be needing a quick power nap at some point tonight before the party really hits full steam. But if I'm asleep when you get there," he locks eyes with Dean, "just, you know. Make yourselves at home."
Cas looks away. "Dean, I was going to—" He stops himself. Closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them, they're filled with anguish. "I was afraid," he whispers. "I just—I just needed some time."
He pushes away the tired haze that fills his mind like a wad of fluffy cotton and forces himself to dial a handful of Sam's numbers on the way to the store, leaving messages whenever there's a voicemail set up. Nobody picks up on any of the calls, which doesn't surprise him so much as it simply contributes to his general feeling of weariness.
Jody's backyard is tidy but lived-in; in one corner Dean can see neatly stacked bags of rock salt, in another corner a passable vegetable garden only slightly beset by weeds.
He still has just enough grace to feel the agony again, lightning-quick, a white-hot flicker in the small of his back, licking at his nearly-human heart. Something terrible is
Castiel tries to breathe lightly, afraid suddenly that the slightest movement will cause Dean to lift his hand away. Dean seems to have no intention of removing it, though; on the contrary, he curls his fingers into Castiel's hair a little, thumb stroking over Castiel's cheekbone as if to wipe away a tear. Which is odd, as Dean is the one crying here.
It might be just the light, but it looks as though Cas is blushing a little. “I heard your prayer. I...seem to be able to hear some prayers, still.”
, Sam deserves more than this shitty lonely life, deserves more than a shitty lonely older brother who can’t—who doesn’t know how to do anything except hunt the things that go bump in the night—who can’t even do
One of his friends? Castiel tries to think, but aside from the Winchesters, he's coming up blank as to who the demon might be referring to.
the pain leaving Dean—can feel Dean's soul and body crying out in relief as the months-long agony dissipates at last. Without the sigil to obscure Dean's soul from him, its movements and contours are laid out for him, as familiar as his own grace.
"I just went to get supplies," says Castiel. "I need to look at your wounds. Some of them are infected."
Finally the forest opens up and the road narrows down in a way that he's fairly certain wouldn't typically happen on any kind of earthly interstate, and he glides the car over gravel and then dirt and then to a halt at the edge of a lake.
"Dean," Castiel murmurs, but the man in front of him doesn't react to his name being spoken. Castiel hesitates, then reaches up for the cuff on Dean's right wrist. He snaps the chain easily in his hands. Dean jumps, his head snapping up as he yanks his arm tightly to his chest.
"Come on, Sam," Dean says, punching Sam lightly on the shoulder. Cornfields race past, just beyond the window. "It's Seger—you can't
"I love you too," Castiel says. Dean screams a response, but it's wordless, or maybe Castiel just can't make sense of words any longer. That sleek darkness slides into place behind Dean, like Castiel could just pitch forward and tumble right over Dean's shoulder, into emptiness. Dean wants to help, he knows. Dean is so beautiful, bloody and bare and terrified like this, under the soft morning sky. His soul pulses bright, so bright, and Castiel aches for it. He's never believed in anything the way he believes in Dean Winchester. Dean can help him, if Castiel can only—if he can only—
Their teeth click together for a moment, a second kiss just as heated and unrelenting as the first, and then Cas is tipping his head to mouth at Dean's jaw, at his throat. Dean feels Cas's stubble grazing the side of his neck, and a coil of syrupy heat runs through his limbs like a slow electric current, desire pooling heavy and sweet inside him.
"Sam?" Castiel says, urgent. He doesn't look at the younger Winchester, even as he grits out the question. He'd see Hell and Heaven burn both, before he turns away from Dean at a moment like this.
“Alright," says Chuck, from the back seat, no longer empty. Dean and Sam jerk in simultaneous surprise. Chuck leans forward, propping his arms on the bench, and rolls his eyes with something like disgust. “Honestly, I thought this round would last a little longer.”
"Castiel," says Dean. The curl of the name is something lovely and strange on his tongue. Cas twitches almost imperceptibly, and turns the laser of his focused gaze onto Dean's face, which almost shuts Dean up right then and there. But dammit, this is
Cas slowly traces his eyes over Dean's face, probably taking in the last vestiges of tears that Dean's sleeve hadn't been able to scrub away. "Dean," he says, after a moment. "You know...what I said, before the...before. I said it, thinking that I was about to die. That those were the last words I'd ever speak to you—that it was the only way I could save you."
"Impossible like me sensing your soul even with those sigils carved into you?" Castiel says quietly. "Impossible like you feeling what I felt when we were together that night?"
Dean turns his face into Cas's neck, breathes out slowly. The syrupy heat settles in his limbs, a sleepy, yearning sweetness. He rocks into Cas's hand a little, shivering.
"I forgot to get something," Castiel invents wildly. "Some supplies for the truck." He knows this much: he can't stay in this room a minute longer, not with Dean so close, not with the firebrand
"It's me." He holds Jack to him. He didn't think he would get to do this—didn't think he would hug any of his family ever again, didn't think he'd hear their voices or get to know how they saved the world or be there with them for any of the seasons yet to come.
"You sure it'll work?" The female demon looks down at Castiel. Her gaze is contemptuous, disinterested, as if she's surveying a rather loathsome insect.
After a quarter mile of slogging through the increasingly muddy ground, Castiel stops and sits down on a fallen tree. His face was wet before he even stepped into the rain, but now his entire body and all his clothes are soaked. He sits and lets the rain pelt his skin.
Sam laughs quietly. He pulls back, smiles at Dean. His face is streaked with tears. "I'm gonna...I'm gonna go to bed, are you gonna be alright?"
“Oh yeah?” says Dean. Rage licks a stripe of white-hot fire down his insides and he leans into the comfort of it. Stokes it into a blaze, converts it to a furious recklessness. In the back of his mind, he's aware that Sam has shifted positions, is no longer in his field of vision. “Because I’m pretty sure we just figured it out, anyway. Your con job worked for what, a couple weeks? And now we’re onto you, so you can kiss your screwed-up plan to leave us on eternal screensaver mode goodbye, you fucking
“Alright, I think I found a likely spot for the lair,” says Sam. He taps at the screen to close out the park map. “Pretty straightforward.”
"Good one," sneers Chuck. "Rowena? Really? You thought that was it? You thought some witch from the Middle Ages had the chops to write
, so I don't—I don't fucking blame you, but it's bad enough I can't even leave this stupid room, I don't need any more reminders that I can't—that you don't want—that you—"
"You little fuck," the vampire says, and suddenly his hand is around Dean's throat, squeezing; Dean chokes and Castiel chokes too, stumbling mid-run as stars of light explode in their shared vision.
"I've got you," Cas murmurs against the corner of Dean's mouth, and Dean feels, again, that absurd hot prickle of tears for no reason. Cas palms over the head of his dick and Dean hears himself make a soft keening noise.
He stumbles, grasping at straws. Looks around. There's a lake, and a wet alleyway, and a streambed, and a creeping darkness like tar.
“Dean—I know you cared for me, before—that you considered me family, but—the way I feel about you, it’s something I know you don’t—” Cas stumbles, his words colliding with each other as he talks faster. “The way I—the way I want you, you
. He looks wildly around at the surrounding buildings, but nothing stirs in the shadows beyond the streetlights’ radiance. “Wait—wait.”
"No," says Sam, and he smiles again, and he squeezes Dean's shoulders, just a little. "I don't think it's too late at all."
Castiel doesn't have a particular destination in mind when he flees—no need to sugarcoat it—the motel room, but he ends up in a nondescript diner, toying with a plate of fries he has no real intention of eating.
After what feels like a long time but is technically only thirteen minutes, the oven timer goes off. Cas makes a noise of complaint as Dean starts to pull away.
He ends up doubled over, leaning against the wall for support, wheezing and gasping like Billie's still magically crushing his heart in a telekinetic fist. He's making an awful sound, a horrible ragged rhythmic noise that tears its way out of his chest and flays his throat on its way out.
"I was," says Castiel. He frowns. "Sam shouldn't have been able to save me. That fire, Dean, it was going slowly, but it was already so deep in my wings, I could feel it, it should've—"
Such a long time between updates! :0 All the apologies for keeping you guys waiting. Forgive me? I made this chapter nice and long! And filled it with copious misunderstanding and pain!
Dean swears and jumps about a foot in the air. Trust his sasquatch of a little brother to sneak up on him at the worst moment possible. He isn't sure whether to blame it on Sam's natural cat-footedness, or to chalk it up to angelic power. To be fair, he hasn't noticed any other superpowers manifesting in his brother; Sam is pretty much just regular Sam, albeit skinnier than ever, with deep hollows lingering under his eyes, the stubborn remnants of the Trials.
desire, which had reared up inside him, a response so immediate as to feel almost instinctual, even though such a thing couldn't—
Raz whistles, low. "Well, those have seen better days." He reaches out and jerks the gag out of Castiel's mouth. "What'd you do, fall on them?"
“Yeah,” says Dean. And he finds himself glad—glad that Jack at least is coming back with them, that Jack’s room at least won’t be empty. “Yeah, kid, absolutely.” Belatedly, he wonders if he should stop calling Jack
And then Dean pulls away, his mouth the first to go, and then the tender apology in his gaze, and last his hands, the thumbs brushing down the narrow bones of Castiel's face.
Castiel does move, then; he twists gracefully to catch Dean around the waist and roll him over, onto his back. Castiel comes down on top of him, angling his wings to balance. He braces himself on his forearms so that his face is inches above Dean's.
Dean tugs at his jacket, peers at the garment where it rucks over his shoulder. The fabric is pristine under the light dusting of sawdust from his woodpile collision. He'd thought—for a moment it'd looked like there was—but trick of the dim light, maybe.
Castiel trembles. He imagines killing Corin, doing it slowly, excruciatingly. Scattering the pieces after.
touch them," Castiel grits out, his voice hoarse from so long without speech. He tries to quell the panic sparking in his gut. He's never physically manifested his wings before. They're shaking uncontrollably, tiny muscle spasms running along them as he struggles to keep them folded close to his body.
Corin turns Dean roughly, steering him to the door, and some kind of recognition dawns in Dean's eyes. He starts to struggle weakly; Corin huffs in impatience and slaps him, a sharp blow that sends Dean's head snapping to one side.
, that insult had burned. Dean can banter all he likes, can come back swinging with easy confidence every time, but there's always going to be a part of him that recognizes the kernel of truth in every cutting jab.
you to be here, Jack. This is your home too, it always has been. I’m not going to kick you out just because I bump into you in the damn hallway.”
"Dean," Sam stammers. He steps back from Chuck, releasing the scythe haft. The blade slides out of Chuck's chest with a wet
"Cas," he whispers, tipping his head up as Cas slowly kisses down toward his collarbone. The sky is cloudless and blue above them. "I want...I want..."
There's a beat of silence. Sam looks down, hesitates. "I think about...everything that I've done, and I...I think part of me will always—feel like I'm unclean, y'know?"
"See, but you don't, though," says Dean. "Or you'd know that I'm in love with you too, you dumbass."
Castiel wets his lips, and thinks of something that Dean would say. "Did you torture your victims mostly with boring speeches? Or did knives come into play too?"
Dean tries to listen, he really does, but his hands are trembling and Cas’s blood is soaking through the fabric of the Zeppelin tee and Cas is
"Sammy," Dean whispers. He puts his hands over his ears, moves them to his face. Presses his knuckles against his eyes. "I can't do this."
Laughter rings in his ears. Castiel tears his eyes away from the fading illusion of Dean and sees Raz leaning against the cell bars, unnoticed somehow, whether through glamour or through Castiel's own idiotic focus on what he had thought—
"Oh yeah?" Chuck straightens up and advances on them. "How come it's so easy for me to bump you guys back to the starting line again and again? You guys are stubborn, I'll give you that. Guess that's why you were my favorites for so long. But you can't break out of this."
Dean flails wildly, but Castiel ignores the blows and focuses instead on his grace, channeling it out through his palms. He might not be able to heal Dean, but this external, physical barrier presents no such issue. He concentrates on not allowing his grace to pass beyond the black substance, not letting it burn or even brush against Dean's body. He isn't entirely successful, and Dean gasps in pain under his touch, but Castiel holds him in place and
“Cas,” Dean says, and he hears his voice crack around the word. It comes out like a plea but he doesn’t know what he’s asking for, just that his whole heart, his whole body, is aching with a wordless, depthless yearning. He tightens his grip on Cas’s coat and uses it to drag himself closer, like he can bury himself in Cas. He wants, he wants, he
. It was a lot, man. You were—fuck, you were in a bad way, Cas. I thought." Dean falters yet again. "I thought you were going to die."
. He isn't—he doesn't know if he's allowed this. He doesn't know what to do, here, whether to back away or move forward or let Dean open up space between them or—or—
On the other side of the map table, Cas is fighting two fey at once, ducking under their glittering shortspears, moving with a lithe, feline grace that looks just as angelic as it did when it was powered by grace. He’s empty-handed, no angel blade in sight, but he pivots expertly away from a spear thrust, hits the elf hard on the elbow and shoulder to send them careening past, and glances up across the map table to lock eyes with Dean, such a sharp, dangerous grin on his face that Dean almost forgets himself and gets impaled. He parries the swing at the last possible second and lets himself grin back at Cas for an instant, exhilarated, before the whirl of combat carries him away again.
Dean lifts his head. "Cas," he slurs, sounding almost drunk for an instant before his gaze suddenly sharpens. "I can
you thought that I didn't...that you thought I wouldn't..." He squeezes his eyes shut, opens them again. Sighs out a breathless laugh. "I thought you knew how I felt about you."
They break apart again but Castiel stays bent over, forehead resting against Dean's. He breathes in the smell of Dean, runs his hands over Dean's chest.
, and I—but I would've said it, I swear to you, I would've said it back. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry you died thinking you couldn't have—that I didn't—I just. I wanted to say it."
Cas, wide-eyed, reaches out. It seems to be the most he can move—his feet stay planted firmly in the earth, his body ramrod-stiff like the sigil is forcing him to stand upright. The sinuous symbol on his cheek is beginning to smoke and bubble, as though it’s eating into his skin. He stretches his arm out toward Dean’s outstretched hand; Dean, lunging, feels the tips of their fingers just barely brush.
Cas skims his hand down over Dean's ribs, along his belly. His wet fingertips leave trails of fire under Dean's skin as they skate lower, as they dip below the waist of Dean's jeans.
“Wha…” Dean groans, cracking his eyes open. He feels a faint draft playing over his face, though the room's heater has been quiet.
He catches Cas's eye, over Sam's shoulder. Cas is standing next to Jack, and his eyes are on Dean, and his mouth is still curved into that wondering smile. Dean feels something split in his heart—not painfully, but sweetly, newly. Something soft and growing.
, okay?" The words are tumbling out of him in no particular order, rushed and panicked. "I would—I would know, if I—if
in Dean, just moves and pulls that concentrated lightning out of every cell of Dean and drags it into a single cresting point—
"Why didn't you come back?" Dean blurts, and if he wasn't giving this whole self-esteem thing a shot, he'd hate himself for the way it comes out—plaintive and needy. A hairsbreadth short of accusing.
Cas waits, because he's patient, and probably also because he's a smug son of a bitch who knows exactly what Dean's trying to work up the courage to ask.
Castiel closes his eyes. He wills himself to lie still as Raz tugs off the rest of his clothes and runs two fingers down the outside of his leg, neutralizing the trail of gold ooze there. The Kaustos polyp has reached Castiel's ankle and is beginning slowly to reverse its course; Raz plucks it off with no more effort than it would take to pick a flower. He smears one last daub of ointment where the slug's progress had been interrupted, picks up the pot, and stands.
he's feeling, the touch of it is unmistakable despite how many years it's been since Castiel laid a hand on it, in all its light and warmth and protectiveness and love—broken though they are, his wings are a conduit to his true form, and—
Michael tilts his head, a gesture so reminiscent of Cas that Dean would look away if he could move. "You think that because you made the world, you aren't
Cas stares at him. Slowly, he reaches out. The dark tendrils wrapped around his limbs shiver for a moment, like they really are alive. And then they crumble into fragments, and then to ash, and then to nothing.
"Every time you thought you killed me, you just dug yourselves deeper." Chuck sticks his hands into his pockets, unfurls a sly smirk. "I
“They didn’t have any at the desk. We’ll grab some on the way, come on. Two more days to Washington, right?”
Dean stills, his hand on the bathroom doorknob. "Were dicks about it? Yeah, they were. We don't need to talk about it."
of Dean and Dean's easy smile and the pain that roils underneath it and Castiel's thrumming desire to soothe that pain, to hold Dean close and make him forget anyone else who's ever touched him—
He sees Cas in that storage room, again. Tears smeared into his smile, clotted in his dark lashes. Voice aching around the words.
"I..." says Cas. "Can I...if you..." He closes his eyes, breathes slowly and shakily even though angels aren't supposed to need to breathe. Opens them again. "Will...you have me, Dean?"
Dean shifts so that he's on his side, facing Castiel. He keeps the covers pulled up to his chin, but Castiel catches a glimpse of a bandage wrapped around his neck, and his stomach clenches as he remembers Corin's viciousness. Dean seems lucid, though—a little pale, but lovely and soft in the yellow glow of the bedside lamp.
He says it with a kind of quiet resignation, and Dean feels a deep pain in his ribs that's not just from the knife wound.
"Dean," says Castiel. His voice cracks and he can't find the strength to despise himself for that. Dean's shoulders fold forward as he shutters in on himself, but he still doesn't turn around. Doesn't respond. Dean has shut Castiel out, like an inconvenient fall of rain—has shut a door between them, and maybe it was a door that was never really open, anyway. It would make sense. Castiel seems to make a habit of wanting what he can never truly have. And maybe this is what Castiel needed to learn all along, the lesson that will finally put him back together into a shell that holds him.
"I know you're in my head," says Cas, and the momentary testiness in his voice is so incredibly Cas-like that it might pull a chuckle out of Dean if the situation weren't so goddamn dire. "Anything I know, you know."
Castiel shifts his weight forward, putting his free hand on Dean's knee to brace himself. Dean's breathing is already getting panicked—shaky inhales and exhales, his fists shaking visibly with the effort of not moving. When Castiel moves the blade towards the second sigil, the one blocking his healing, a tiny, involuntary sound of terror escapes Dean's lips.
. He couldn't have turned himself into someone who could be with Cas even if he had all the time in existence, and he certainly doesn't have that luxury now.
Dean stills. He resists, with a masterful exertion of willpower, the urge to throw his beer at Sam's giant head. "Don't."
Jack slowly sits back up, scrubbing at his face with the back of his hand in a motion that suddenly reminds Sam, very sharply and achingly, of Dean.
Castiel tears his eyes away from the thing that had tortured and taunted him for weeks, and manages to take Dean's hand.
Jack just looks at him with those huge puppy-dog eyes—chalk down another thing he seems to have inherited from Sam.
He's prepared to level his shotgun at someone to get an answer, but he doesn't need to. A vampire, needle teeth extending reflexively as it scents the blood on Dean's forehead, lifts a shaky hand to jab at a spot in the center of the floor.
"What do we need to remember?" Dean isn't sure if he's asking Sam or himself. He stares down at his hands, almost expecting to find a note scribbled across his palms.
The vampire snorts and ignores this, striding over to Dean, who flinches back but doesn't move from where he's down on his knees.
I felt," says Dean. He winds his fingers through Castiel's. "I mean. Uh. It felt good. Obviously. But it, it felt good for
loud to Castiel's ears. The terror of a few seconds before appears to have ebbed; Dean looks lucid now, fully awake, and he stares up at Castiel with a strange focus. Beyond the circle of lamplight the rest of the room seems to have faded away. But the rain continues to drum against the window and Dean continues to look wordlessly at Castiel.
“Please,” he says again. He takes a step forward, lifting his hands, almost in supplication. He doesn’t know if whatever harebrained plan Michael has hatched is going to work, but if he can—if Chuck can bring back Cas, at least—
"Dean," he growls into the hollow of Dean's throat. He kisses along the skin of Dean's ribs, moves back up to mouth at Dean's collarbone and then his jaw. Dean exhales in a harsh, needy pant, lifting his hips against Castiel's and tipping his head back to expose his throat. Dean's fingers are buried in his feathers, sending heat splintering through Castiel's body like lightning; even on this plane, his wings are as close as it comes to being an open conduit to his true form, and the sensation of it, the
(They’d driven to the general store in Lebanon two days ago, Dean handling Baby carefully around the snow-dusted curves. Caitlin had waved to them from outside the diner, on her way in for the afternoon shift. A handful of kids he didn’t even
“Oh,” says Dean. He might have been embarrassed by it, once. Or tried to deflect it, frightened by the immensity of what it suggests. Now it just makes something warm unfurl in his chest. He cups his other hand against Cas’s wrist, rubs his thumb against the pulse point, traces along the lines of Cas’s palm. “I figured maybe my book said I died by wendigo or something, and you were keeping an eye out.”
Distantly, he’s aware that he’s probably going into shock. He tries again to lift his head but the world is spinning

Sam makes a low sound, the tendons in his neck standing out like cords, almost vibrating with the strain as he tries to turn his head. Chuck returns his attention to Dean.
Dean hears Sam’s urgent shout and drops into a crouch without even really thinking about it. The leviathan behind him swings through the space his skull was just occupying; Dean hears the whistle of the club passing overhead an instant before he pivots on the balls of his feet, still half-crouched, and fires a borax round directly up the monster’s bow.
heat, and all the while Castiel's grip is like iron on Dean's hips, pulling him, holding him. Dean grinds down and Castiel hisses into Dean's open mouth and drives his hips up, lifting—
It's a bit of a longer update this week! Thanks everyone for being so patient. I hope you guys like it, and as always comments are super appreciated. <3
*me bashing the canonical finale to smithereens with a battered keyboard* THE POWER—OF LOVE—COMPELS—YOU—
Michael billows and burns, blue-white and glorious, coiling himself in the air above, readying to accept his Sword.
"They aren't," Dean falters, but he sounds uncertain. His face, upturned, is inches from Castiel's own.
Dean whirls, catching sight of Sam and Eileen spinning round as well. The vampire at the far edge of the clearing keeps walking toward them, unruffled by the fact that Eileen’s machete swings immediately up to aim in the direction of his throat.
The last streetlamp quakes but doesn’t shatter, as the figure finally steps into its pool of colorless light, in that deserted street corner in Lebanon in the middle of the night at the end of the world.
?" retorts the dream-Castiel. It leans onto its arm, adding to the force crushing Dean's throat. A trickle of blood runs from the corner of Dean's mouth. The sky darkens ominously.
And now Cas does look at Dean, a frightened dart of his eyes before his lips firm. His shoulders droop; he nods, resigned. "Alright, Dean. But you—you don't need those."
"Told you we weren't going to stop," says Dean quietly. There's a haunted expression on his face, and he looks away from the forest of empty bottles cluttering one end of the table.
“I thought,” says Cas finally, and his gaze is suddenly dark and distant, “I thought that I should try to keep some distance. That perhaps you would not want me around, as I am now.”
Maybe Dean makes a sound, as he stands there with his heart lurching and the vise around his chest clicking tighter and tighter. Maybe Cas just knows he's there, the way Cas always seems to know.
"You—think I don't want to be around you?" says Castiel slowly. The absurdity of it almost leaves him winded, and he has the sudden, ridiculous urge to laugh out loud.
He leans against the bars, smirking at Castiel. "That's right, the idiots are paying so little attention to you that my boss can fool them with a couple deadpan one-liners and a
Chuck turns to face him fully, eyebrows arching like Dean’s just asked a truly stupid question. “The point is that you two still
Sam looks around like he's just woken up from a dream. "Shouldn't we get back on the road," he says slowly, but it doesn't sound like a question. "Dean?"
"Well, consider yourselves invited now," says Castiel. "Actually I'm throwing one tonight. Nine p.m." He was planning on doing no such thing, but hey, he's Castiel Novak. What good is it being him if he can't pull together a party on twelve hours' notice?
all this. He breathes around the sudden lump in his throat, turns to look over his shoulder at Cas. “You know, we do have to kiss under mistletoe, and it looks like you have some right there.”
can't enter." Jack's mouth quirks in a wry smile. "The Empty is...even older than God. There are cosmic rules that govern it. Rules even I can't break." He glances over to the table, where Sam is bent over a yellowed scrap of parchment. "But I can bend them, with your help."
"Jack," says Sam again, helplessly. He puts his arms around the boy and feels tiny tremors, feels tears dampening the fabric of his shirt where Jack's face is buried in the hollow of his shoulder. Maybe the faith he'd seen was a mask, he thinks belatedly. Maybe under all that, Jack hadn't had faith in where he belonged at all.
“You didn’t have a soul,” says Dean tiredly. He isn’t sure if he’s reminding Jack of that so much as himself. He pushes up from the table, takes a step with no particular direction, and then just stands there, hip against the edge. Remembering the first time Jack had died, how the three of them—Sam, Dean, and Cas—had grieved and laughed and reminisced and blinked back tears, sitting around this table, mourning. He thinks of the moment after Sam had gone to bed, when Dean had turned to Cas, his tongue simultaneously too heavy and too free under the influence of too much whiskey, and had said,
Well, Dean stares at him now. He looks tired, like he always does. Rumpled, softer at the edges after ten years on Earth. A little bit creased with humanity.
"I will find him," says Castiel, his voice hard. "Wherever you go, whatever you try, I will find him." He keeps his eyes trained on Corin, but he's speaking to Dean, trying to reassure him.
Castiel Novak. High school senior, straight-A student, beloved quarterback of the football team, shoe-in for prom king this year, and taking a fucking nap at his own goddamn house party.
"You understand, Dean?" The dark-haired vampire's voice purrs out of the agony and the encroaching darkness, echoing in Dean's oxygen-deprived brain. "You go where we put you and you
"He's not the priority, you moron." Dean smiles, half-rueful, half-gentle. "You think I could bear it if I lost you?"
"I'm sorry," Dean is whispering, over and over again, the words muffled by the fabric of Castiel's shirt. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry—"
"Dean," Cas says again, stronger. He lifts a hand but Dean can't move, he's paralyzed. He should leave. Cas is alive, and Dean should leave, and never touch Cas with these hands again—
"Jack, it wasn't your job to rescue me," says Castiel, cutting off the torrent of grief and guilt currently being wept into his collar. "They told me that you saved the world. You did more than any of us could ever have asked of you. I am so, so proud of you."
"Don't what?" Castiel has the frustratingly familiar sense that he isn't doing what Dean wants, that he's messing up, somehow, but he has no idea what exactly the failure is. Only a few minutes ago, with the storm raging outside and his arms around Dean, it felt as though he knew exactly what to say to meet Dean's needs, and now he's floundering again, unsure what to say or do. At least he recognizes the pattern, anyway—this disjointed rhythm of alternating understanding and bewilderment that seems to govern all his interactions with Dean.
done things, himself, that turn his stomach to remember. They've all got blood on their hands that they're trying to atone for. And Mom—his throat hurts a little, thinking about it, even now, but it’s something bittersweet and gentle, seeped in love, not the wrenching grief and rage that it used to be.
,” says Chuck. He comes to a halt beside them and tucks his hands into his pockets. “That was the big reveal, boys. You're supposed to have it figured out now."
Belatedly, Dean remembers how much of a foodie the original Death was. Shit. “You been, uh, doing a worldwide food tour, then?”
With every day that passes since they averted the last world-shattering apocalypse—with every day since they beat Chuck, got Cas back, saved the world—Dean thinks he can feel a little more of the tension he carries around in his chest loosening. There’s a lot of years of accumulated tension to get through, granted, but this—
Benny shrugs. “This is Purgatory, right? Alliances shift around. She’s got some of them who’ve pledged loyalty. Well. As much loyalty as you can expect from leviathan. Backstabbing little shits.”
that Dean had tried so hard to bury, all those years. Knowing that Cas is Death now doesn’t help Dean to subsume that again, doesn’t give him a way to shove it back six feet under. Even if Cas decides to stick around, can Dean go back to the way things used to be? Can he live with all his armor flayed off, with all of his
"He's not going to just leave," Gabriel frowns, he has a headache and he just wants to snap his fingers and not be here. If he could just be anywhere but here.
