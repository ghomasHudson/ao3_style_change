“It’s true,” Steve says lightly. “You’re always beautiful.”
Tony turns the corner to see Steve and Peggy standing in front of Steve's locker. Steve's arms are around her as she tilts her head up, and Tony watches with cold frozen veins as she stands on her tiptoes to press a kiss against the corner of Steve's mouth. He watches as Steve sighs and pulls her close, burying his face in the crook of her shoulder.
Tony smiles, his mouth feeling tight as he tilting his head down to peck Steve on the lips before leaning over to kiss Pepper’s cheek. “Shouldn’t be too long,” he lies, walking out into the hall just as his phone is about to shrill its last ring.
He slides the watch drawer shut and turns his focus to his collection of cufflinks, making a quick choice of a simple pair made of black rhodium before he can overthink that too. He’s fastening them when his eyes fall on a burgundy leather box tucked in the corner of the drawer and he remembers the bangle inside. Perfect.
“You don't mean that,” Tony says after a moment of stunned silence as he tries to process Steve's words, wrapping his arms around himself.
is,” Steve interrupts, “I love you, Tony. For real real. I am so,
. You’re a dream. You’re beyond my dreams. I can’t believe you love me,
Tony scrambles out of Steve’s lap as soon as he sees them and runs at Rhodey with a loud cry, launching himself into Rhodey’s arms with a loud, “Sugarbear!” Pepper smiles affectionately as she walks over to greet Steve and the rest of their friends, leaving Tony with Rhodey.
Bruce, to his credit doesn’t push. “Bucky went first,” he says softly.
“I’m not young anymore.”
as his brain short circuits and completely fries again. He's reaching down and pushing his palm against Steve when a strong hand gently grips his wrist and stops him.
Pepper has to forcibly clamp her hand down on Tony’s wrist to keep him from running after Rhodey. He's two inches away from bawling like a little child and it's ridiculous, he knows. It's only going to be a few months, Tony tells himself as he clings to Pepper. They watch as Rhodey walks towards the car, turning back to wave again before he climbs in. A few very, very long months, and an even longer senior year.
. Even years ago, when they could've been something called friends, sitting together in detention week after week, even then Steve's dad—he was sick. And his mother had struggled so much to take care of her husband and son.
the old man.”
“Yeah, sweetheart,” Steve says gently.
“Et tu, Thor?” Steve asks, betrayed.
They end up ordering way too much food, and
” is all Tony knows how to say. He can feel the hot pinprick of wetness prickling in his eyes as tears gather in the sweep of his lashes. He’s so full of Steve in every way, and he wants desperately to be like this forever.
“You don't have to kiss me when no ones watching, you know,” Tony says, and immediately hates himself.
“Holy shit,” Tony whispers, turning wide eyes to his friends.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to any of that. He feels overwhelmed with everything Steve just told him, and his brain has to rewire itself to even process Steve’s words. He’s still reeling from everything Steve just said, the words washing over him and he’s barely grasping any of it, but that one singular thought keeps repeating in his head.
It makes Tony irrationally angry to see Rhodey tiptoeing around him too. Of all people, he had thought his best friend would be willing to be honest with him.
Steve scrunches his nose. “Yeah that was the weekend after the trip when everything was a mess—”
“I’m so sorry,” she repeats in a mantra, her voice clouded with tears. “I’m so, so sorry.”
“Let's get down to business,” Tony says brusquely before Steve can say anything else. “As I was saying, proposition. I think we can help each other, Rogers.”
“I think,” Loki says, turning to Nat and heaving a deep sigh, “Stark is just showing off. He’s not really complaining. He’s just rubbing it in our faces he somehow got Mr. Perfect when he’s a hot mess and we’re both still single.”
, sweetheart.”
They weave through the winding streets after leaving the shop, eventually losing the paparazzo after some sharp turns and calculated risks through narrow alleys. They end up having a quiet early dinner in a small restaurant with cracked plaster walls tucked between a florist and a butcher at the end of an unnamed street.
Tony turns back to their daughter. Morgan pats his cheek when she’s done, and gives him a bright smile. “There,” she says, nodding confidently. “You’re a twelve now.”
“They kind of remind me of us,” Tony says sleepily when Kirk and Spock finally meet at Starfleet, already feeling as though he's drifting off.
- I never wanted Peggy to come off as an antagonist or a bitch. While the role of the ex-girlfriend in the source material was petty and spiteful, I wanted Peggy to be empathetic and kind. Any negative thoughts about her are only Tony’s misconceptions about her relationship with Steve.
“Yeah I heard of you,” Barnes had replied sullenly, but he didn't say anything else about what he might've heard about Tony. He simply gave Steve an unreadable look before turning back to his lunch.
“Just Sarah will do, sweetheart,” she says kindly. “I've heard so many great things about you, Tony. Steve won't stop talking about how smart you are and all of the great things you accomplished. He showed me the paper you published last month, he was so proud of you!”
Tony doesn’t retort that Howard can fuck off whenever he wants, leaving his teenage son to handle the entire SI R&D Department, but it’s a near thing. That’ll only cause more trouble, especially if Howard remembers this conversation the next time he comes home.
“Gotta go in a few,” Steve murmurs sadly as he threads his fingers through Tony's sleep mussed curls. “It's getting late.”
“There,” Tony snarls. “Contract terminated.”
“Steve's most prized possession is a vintage comic book from the forties. Mint. The cover is his favorite superhero punching Hitler in the face,” Clint supplies.
Tony quietly pads over to the balcony doors, uncaring of his nudity, and steps barefoot onto the sun warmed clay of their patio and further out to their private pool overlooking the ocean. There, he sees his husband swimming laps, sluicing through the water in graceful form-perfect strokes.
Tony can’t help but feel a little flutter in his stomach at the idea of the last part before he sharply reminds himself that whatever notes Steve writes him are not real. He’ll probably be thinking of Peggy when he writes them. Tony swallows the bitter taste on his tongue and looks away to focus on the tablet in his lap. “Sure,” he says, trying his best to keep his voice blank.
Steve comes with a loud cry, and his eyes are wet when he pulls Tony in for another kiss and gasps, “I love you, I love you, I love you so fucking much, sweetheart,” against Tony’s lips.
Tony can’t help but laugh at his expression, and what starts as nervous laughter triggered by his own stupid comment becomes full bodied uproarious laughter Steve joins in on. Their faces are aching by the time they calm down, and when they notice the parents and kids have left a wide berth around them, they laugh again. The conversation somehow gets easier after that.
Natasha hums quietly to herself. “Maybe,” she says. “But you don’t have to do it alone. We’re all here for you.”
Boston, huh? Interesting.
“Captain America is also an ass,” Tony says.
Steve knows this isn’t all it takes to fix the issue and to eliminate the pertinacious negative thoughts in Tony's head. He would be arrogant to think so. It’s going to take a lot of hard work and love to pull Tony back out of the dark he more and more often slips into, but that’s a challenge Steve is more than willing to tackle head on. It’s what he had knowingly signed on to do with their wedding vows, and it’s a privilege to even be the one who can try.
“Are you sure you’re not just imagining the man I was all those years ago?” Tony quips, but there’s a wobbly edge to his voice that twists at Steve’s heart. The edges of Tony’s eyes are pink, and Steve notices distantly that his thumb that had traveled up to stroke along Tony’s cheek is wet.
They're interrupted by a kernel of popcorn hitting Steve on the nose, making him go cross eyed as he follows the trajectory to where it drops on the floor. Tony looks up to see Clint with more popcorn in his hand, ready to launch a full on assault.
“Is that a good
“Right,” Tony nods, staring blankly at the cup Steve places in front of him. “Thanks for that. But anyways. Proposition time. Here's my offer: we pretend we're dating until I can successfully play it off that this whole letter thing was a mistake. And that Pepper’s letter meant absolutely nothing, because obviously, out of all the people who got letters, I ‘chose’ you. I’m not going to get between her and Rhodey. So then we ‘break up’ and Pepper and I can go back to being friends, and everything goes back to normal. I'll of course pay you for your help, just name your price.”
Steve leans in to press a chaste kiss to his cheek as he says, “let’s go.”
“Holy shit!” Tony yelps, startling at the sudden wet heat that surrounds him.
“Bucky,” Steve groans. “Shut
?” Steve asks, his voice deliciously hoarse as he climbs back onto the couch on top of Tony. He looks smug and satisfied, a little grin curling the edge of his lips.
“That's me,” Rhodey says wetly, pulling Tony and Pepper into a tight group hug. “I'll see you both soon. You be good,” he directs this at Tony.
Tony is six when his heart is broken for the first time.
Tony balks.
“That’s not what I mean,” Steve says, sighing in frustration. “I—I just know you’re a better man than that, Tony. You would’ve regretted killing anyone. Especially since you’ve given so much to protect people. You would’ve regretted killing a brainwashed man who wasn’t himself when he—did what he did.”
“It's not exactly like SI is a choice,” Tony mutters.
“I didn't either,” Steve says softly from where he lays sprawled on his own pile of pillows. “I would just build them for myself. I don't know if you know this, but I was very poor growing up.”
“Well, why didn't you offer sooner, Stark?” Clint pipes up from the last row.
Steve’s eyes are infinitely fond when he says, “I like
. A little clumsy when their noses bump together and at some point, he knocks his forehead against Steve but everything melts away as Tony focuses on the press of their lips.
Steve shakes his head, but he’s smiling when he says, “you know why. Appearances and all of that good stuff. We have no excuses to not go. You need to get ready,” he says, eying Tony's disheveled hair critically.
“It's stupid,” Tony finally says, unable to stand the silence anymore. “All of it was stupid.”
Steve had always thought “making love” was a sugary graceless epithet, an outdated saccharine idiom that wrinkles his nose every time he hears it. That was until he got to have Tony.
Steve doesn’t visit him in the medical wing again. The chair sits empty for the next three days Bruce forces Tony to stay in bed.
“That’s not my name,” Steve smirks, smoothing his hands over the line of Tony's waist, fingers curling around the hem of his shirt, questioning.
“You are insufferable, you wastrel,” Loki groans. “We are going to the game, and that's that.”
Steve is swiping through the pages with increasing incredulity. There’s the Sullen Steve Stare complete with creases in his brow as he reads.
,” Pepper is saying. “Why did I ever join Student Council, Tony? This was a mistake.”
The equations suddenly line up in Tony’s head and the numbers fall into place. Time dilation. He knows before Bruce murmurs softly, “it’s been four years, Tony. You were gone for four years.”
Steve immediately drops his hands as though burned, and he looks as if Tony just slapped him, his eyes wide and pained. But he still doesn't budge.
That is all Tony can take before he runs out of the study, leaving the pieces of his bot scattered on the carpet. He will be stronger, Tony promises himself. Stark men are made of iron. He
“I look forward to it,” Steve says as they make their way towards the kitchen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Soon, Tony is whispering impatiently, “
Steve laughs and shakes his head. “Also not Mormon by the way, but thanks, I guess. Glad the disguise is working. They'll never see it coming when I finally reveal my true colors.”
He finds catharsis in Mark LXXXIV. The manic panic dissipates a little.

and plies them with overflowing platters of freshly fried sweet tomatoes and the best espresso Tony's ever tasted.
“Why the fuck should I do that?” Tony snarls, irrational anger flaring red poker hot in his chest.
s that has him wondering if Steve can hear it being pressed so close. His breath is coming in rapid little hitches by the time Steve's hands grip the crest of his hip, fingers dipping into his waistband and with another surge of courage, Tony reaches down to unbutton his own fly and push his pants down.
It’s tense seconds before the tall figure clears the shadows of the tree line and steps into the light of the wane moonlight and Tony falls to his knees then. The unexpected relief floods him so strongly, he doesn’t have the strength to hold himself upright.
now.”
“Hi,” he replies with his remaining IQ and wishes the ground would swallow him up.
“Doesn't mean you should treat it like rent,” she says. “Now let’s go. You can finish this another day. You can come back tomorrow. But we are going to get some food now and then
how I expected to meet your new boyfriend.”
Steve leans his cheek against the side of Tony’s temple, and takes him gently by the chin to tilt his head up until they’re staring back at each other through the mirror. He doesn’t move his hand until Tony stops trying to avert his gaze.
“Disgusting,” Loki replies through gritted teeth.
“This isn't a violation of the contract?” Steve murmurs against his lips and Tony pauses to look down at Steve's open expression that looks a lot like hope. But that can't be right.
“Please, Steve,
Tony smiles, slow and warm. He raises their hands where they're connected and gently spreads his fingers, Steve mirroring the action until they're pressed fingertip to fingertip, palm to palm.
“Did we just win?” Pepper gasps.
“So are you feeling better?”
“You know,” Tony grouches as he drops into the seat next to Steve, “we could've taken Howard's jet anywhere you desired if you wanted to go on vacation.”
phone.
Tony is in so deep, he knows this, and it terrifies him. Every time Steve takes him by the hand, it warms him to the core. It makes him ache bone deep when he sees Steve smile softly at him. Each innocent kiss pressed to his cheek and jaw makes heat creep up from his belly until he feels immolated, fever bright.
“She’s fine as far as we can tell,” Bruce says. “She wouldn’t exactly let us check. The only person she’s willing to talk to is Rocket, and that usually devolves into screaming matches. She’s been spending most of her time pacing the door outside your room the entire week while you were asleep, only leaving when Steve comes in—“
“Not yet,” Pepper replies with a fondly exasperated smile. “But I think I get the idea. And here—” she hands Tony a pen and spare notebook when she sees that Tony had come to school empty handed, yet again. “We need to have a long talk about forgetfulness.”
“You’re still pretty spry for a hundred and eleven,” Tony says with a slow smirk. “You never did tell me your secret. It’s pilates, isn’t it?”
Tony is so absorbed in his own thoughts he doesn’t hear the sliding doors open until it’s too late. There’s a soft “oh!” behind him and he turns to see none other than Peggy Carter standing on the deck with him. Speak of the devil, he thinks bitterly.
“You still draw?” Tony asks, surprised, turning slightly in Steve's arms to look up at him. He hasn’t seen any of Steve’s actual drawings in years, not since they had detention together and Steve would spend hours working on elaborate pieces to pass the time. Tony had heaped mountains of praise on his work then because it was true. Steve was extremely talented.
,” Tony repeats sardonically. “I might love Pepper but I know we'll never be right for each other. Not that it's any of your business. The last thing I want to do is hurt any of my friends.”
“Shut up, old man.”
They find their friends in the den as they walk through the house, Thor loudly and enthusiastically clapping Steve on the shoulder, clearly already several drinks deep if the empty plastic cups surrounding him are anything to go by. “Our captain!” he booms. Jane Foster from Tony's Advanced Physics class is perched next to him on the loveseat, sneaking glances his way every few minutes. Clint is sprawled on the couch between Sam and Natasha fielding admirers complimenting him on his winning play. He's laughing and joking but Tony can tell his hearing aids are switched off from his rapid fire signing asking Bucky to get him a drink. Steve waves to the other members of his team where they're gathered by the table of alcohol as they walk by.
The guilt of keeping the secret washes heavy in his breast again, a feeling that’s starting to become familiar with how often he feels that way and the words bubble up on the tip of his tongue as the urge to confess intensifies. Tony is saved from blurting everything out when Natasha says, “Tony, just let yourself enjoy something for once.”
“I want to,” Steve replies, and Tony almost smiles, thinking of old conversations when Steve said that exact same thing. And he knows by now that it's a foregone conclusion that if Steve Rogers wants to do something, there's no stopping him. Steve busses a kiss to Tony's temple and steps away to settle down on the couch.
Steve looks bashful as he replies, “Yeah, a little—”
“Tony! How do you feel about your mother’s apparent suicide?”
“You should be lucky to be in love with someone like me,” Loki scoffs.
It takes everything in Tony to keep from bolting for the door and running home to check the old silk hatbox but the burning pit in his stomach tells him enough. He won't find them there. He should’ve set them on fire as soon as he wrote them, why was he so stupid and sentimental, he’s such an idiot, his life is over now, everything is out there, oh god—
Tony almost whines. Almost.
“Hmmm?” Steve shakes his head slightly as though dazed and his eyes are heated and gaze locked to Tony’s mouth.
“Have I told you,” Tony muses, making no secret that he’s drinking in the sight of his husband from head to toe, “that black is most definitely your color?”
Tony smiles, and breathes.
Morgan tilts her head and looks up at him critically. “You’re maybe an eight right now,” she decides imperiously.
Tony doesn't know much about football, but he can tell they have a great team. Everyone works seamlessly as a well oiled machine engineered by Coulson and led by Steve.
Steve turns away again. “Yeah,” he says quietly. “Just in case.”
be fine. It may still hurt now, the wound still sluggishly bleeding, but he's never been so good at anything than healing his own stupidly fragile heart. He'll simply lance out the poison and excise the necrotic tissue, leave it behind like Steve had so carelessly left him, and he will be
Tony doesn't know how long he stands in front of the kitchen table, staring unseeingly at the phone in his white knuckled grip. He had spent three weeks on that model, and okay admittedly parts of it were interrupted when Steve and school and college applications and his peer reviews distract him, but he had worked hard on that build, damnit. Trust Howard to rip it to shreds with ten words or less.
It takes six weeks for Howard to realize Tony is distracted. The new concepts he comes up with are lacking, the prototypes are not innovative enough, the output not powerful enough.
Tony doesn't realize he's standing at the sink staring blankly at his phone until Jarvis gently takes it away from him and flicks off the screen. He leads Tony to a counter stool and sits him down before shuffling over to start the coffee machine.
He deepens their kiss suddenly, turning the sweet press of lips into a wet slide of tongues and sharp little nips of teeth as his arms curl around Steve’s shoulders to drag bring him downwards and press ever closer. Soft moans fall from Tony's lips as he grinds against Steve, using his legs as leverage and locking his ankles around Steve’s waist to thrust up. Their skin feels hot where they meet, Tony’s erection a searing line against his own.
Tony pauses momentarily in the kiss to look out over the open skyline where the sun is sinking low behind the high rises in its descent. The sky is already dark and lights are starting to flicker on around the city, New York spread out in an endless map of sprawling lights a hundred floors below them. He sits up a little in Steve’s lap.
“Do you trust me?” Steve asks, grinning.
Tony is jostled out of his spiraling thoughts by Pepper squeezing him tighter. The sideways look Pepper levels at him was far too knowing, and he tunes back in enough to hear, “don't worry about him, Rhodey. I'll keep him on track, and he'll be fine. We'll see you at Christmas, and we can come visit you during spring break.”
Steve finds him in the kitchen. Tony startles when warm arms wrap around his waist from behind and he relaxes back against Steve’s chest once he pushes past the fog of his Howard-inspired fugue. He can feel the sharp point of Steve’s chin pressing into the meat of his shoulder as Steve leans in close, his jaw aligned with Tony’s own and he can feel the movement when Steve speaks.
with a fierceness that leaves him aching.
Tony takes the piece of paper between cramping fingers and what he sees on the page takes his breath away. It's
in his back pocket. He groans and sets the bowl on the counter. They're going to have to make another grocery run. Maybe cookies will be a better idea.
He shakes his head, feeling numb all over and almost misses seeing the hangdog look on Steve's face, like he actually thinks—like he actually thinks Tony doesn't feel the same way, like he's resigned to Tony rejecting him, like he believes Tony hasn't been thinking about him after that day in freshman year when they were fifteen and stupid and every day since. Like he ever stood a fucking chance—
“It's okay, J,” Tony says. “It's nothing I shouldn't have seen coming. I knew all along that this would happen, and yet I was still stupid enough to let it go so far. Especially when I
In the hall outside the door, Tony nearly collides into Peggy Carter, Steve’s girlfriend. She gives him an unreadable look and moves past him to go into the bathroom. The door swings shut behind her, muffling the soft soothing sound of her voice and Steve’s anguished sobs.
“Don't fucking touch me!”
Tony settles back on Steve’s chest with phone in hand as he flicks through his notifications. Tony feels slightly guilty when he sees the thirty missed texts from Pepper and Rhodey that go from annoyed to angry to exasperated to resigned, but it’s too far into the night to even make a very late entrance to the gala. Besides, it’s hard to feel too badly about missing the evening when his husband is laying in bed with him and his skin is tingling in all the places where Steve had pressed soft kisses. He’ll make it up to them another time. He tosses the phone aside and turns back to Steve.
He barely notices Steve's arm wrapping snugly around his waist and their legs tangling together as he dozes off. He's sure a little nap until midnight won't hurt. They'll wake up just in time.
“Oh, yikes.”
“Tony,” Steve says, sounding raw and earnest. His voice is soft in the slow silence. “Did you really think that I would do all of these things for someone I didn't really love? That I would’ve told just anyone even half the things I told you? That I would’ve told my mom about you? That I would’ve let you meet my mom and brought you home for Christmas?”
- The last chapter jumped from around 5900 words to over 6800 in final editing.
Tony takes a deep breath and steels himself, ready for the deluge of disappointment. Amazingly, it does not come.
Tony cannot deny he's enjoying every second of this, relishes in the attention, and heat simmers beneath his skin with every graze and touch of Steve's fingers. He wonders if it would feel any better if this is real, and as soon as the unwelcome thought comes, he pushes it quickly away. He's determined to enjoy this as long as he has it.
There’s the flash of the red skies on Titan and the words that never left Tony’s head.
Tony lets Steve kiss him, distracting him with little nips to his bottom lip as his hand reaches behind him and curls into the soft snow. He gathers a handful of it and mashes it against Steve’s cheek just as he’s about to deepen the kiss, laughing and squirming away before Steve can properly react.
He thinks of Quill, whose grief and rage cost them everything, and Tony wonders if he can even blame that sorrow for its destructive fault. He thinks of Strange and the look in his eyes when he handed over the very thing they were all willing to die to protect, his hands shaking as they all sighed in defeat. He thinks of Peter’s last moments, and he can still feel Peter’s ashes clinging to the beds of his fingernails. He still doesn’t know what he’ll find at the compound, if he’ll be met with silent halls and empty rooms.
“We’re never going to live this down, are we?” Tony says.
“Let’s stay home,” Tony says imploringly, peering up at Steve from beneath his lashes with a pleading expression he knows Steve finds hard to resist. He leans up to steal another kiss before his husband, his better, more responsible half can say no.
“You have me,” Tony says quietly.
Tony pulls her hand up to press a kiss to her knuckles. “Thanks, Nat. Have you seen the tweets about us? Some of them are even kind of funny, like Steve dumping me because of some dark family secret, but imagine if they knew the truth—”
“Yeah,” Tony says, swallowing the burning sensation in his mouth. He will not cry about this.
Tony hums in agreement, arching slightly to look back at Steve behind him. “You married a futurist and genius, remember?” he replies smugly, heart warming when Steve looks back at him with adoration clear on his face. He leans in for another kiss and then there’s the wet blunt head of Steve’s cock pressing against him. It burns a little as Steve pushes in slowly, Steve’s cock is huge, and it was barely enough preparation but Tony wants it, wants all of him.
And yey, now the fic is done! Thank you again to everyone who’s read this, and left a kudos or comment. Your feedback is always loved and appreciated, and it really kept me going when I had doubts about this fic. Your support for this fic means the world to me.
“Ana?” Tony asks with a smile tugging at his lips.
“I'm glad,” Tony says honestly, his words working around the lump rising in his throat. His heart is aching for Steve. When he reaches up with his free hand to trace along the edge of Steve's jaw with his thumb, he can feel Steve's pulse beneath his fingers. “I'm glad your dad was amazing and I'm glad your mom is the strongest and most wonderful woman ever.”
Eventually, when the conversation becomes unavoidable, Tony adds a
He doesn’t. He's not going to be the third wheel when Rhodey is shipping out the morning after New Year.
“Hey, Brucie,” Tony says, finding his own voice to be hoarse and sandpaper rough. He clears his throat. “Give it to me straight, doc. How long have I got?”
Steve surveys the field for a brief moment as he cocks his arm back, eyes roving the field to look for an opening. Tony is on the edge of his seat, waiting with baited breath, Pepper equally tense next to him. Even Loki and Nat are silent. The whole stadium is quiet as they watch Steve make the final throw with seconds on the clock.
“April fools?” Tony tries and he can slap himself for saying something so stupid when all Steve does is raise an incredulous brow at him as though saying,
Tony’s heart is full to bursting by the time Steve is stripping quickly out of his own suit, letting the velvet and silk fall from his shoulders to be cast carelessly to the side, joining the growing pile of clothes. And finally, finally, Tony can run greedy hands over the illustrated skin of his husband, tracing along the birds captured mid flight at his throat, down to the roses blooming on his shoulder, to the letters TS on his sternum. To the radiant heart that belongs to Tony, and the very real beating one beneath the inked skin that belongs to him too. Tony pinches at Steve’s nipples, his fingers tugging at the barbell in one of them before sweeping his palms down the stretch of Steve’s arms curled around him. He reaches back to touch the Mark VII bracelets still circling Steve’s wrists.
They forget to set the alarm and end up sleeping straight past midnight. Tony wakes up in the early hours of morning cuddled with Steve beneath the pillowfort. It's a quarter after two and he is so warm and comfortable, he is loath to get up. He impulsively presses a small kiss to Steve's lips thinking he's still asleep. He doesn't expect Steve's arms to curl tighter around his waist and for Steve to sleepily return the kiss so fervently.
“None of that,” Pepper says, snapping Tony out of another spiral. Her hand feels warm against his cheek, anchoring and strong. “I can see where your brain is going, Tony. Just email Rhodey tomorrow. Everything is fine. He's just worried about you and he’ll call you back once he gets the chance.”
“He loved you so much,” Tony whispers as his heart breaks in two.
“Hey,” Tony says softly, a slow smile curving his lips as Steve moves closer, his expression set with intent.
That kiss, what you thought you saw, that was a goodbye kiss
“Gonna show you off to everyone,” Steve says, pressing a lingering kiss to Tony’s shoulder. “Walk around town with you gorgeous young thing half my age hanging on my arm. Everyone in the neighborhood’s gonna be jealous.”
Suddenly, he understands why she has never stood up to Howard, even when she knew what he’s doing. She’s seen the red marks on Tony’s hands, the bruises on his arm. She’s heard the way he speaks and yells and screams. She’s turned a blind eye to the way Tony’s expression goes flat as he hunches his shoulders when Howard walks into a room.
“Hmmm,” Tony considers after the last of his giggles die down. “Think I might be busy that night.”
“And you were going to promposal me? I missed that?” Tony exclaims.
“I'll join the army I guess,” Steve says, one corner of his mouth lifting higher, but his expression is clouded with sadness. “My dad served, before I was born. There aren’t that many options for someone like me. I’m not well off like the other kids at school. I wouldn't be able to pay my own tuition and I'm not going to burden my ma with a loan, not with Da gone.”
That fall, he meets Steve Rogers.
He makes to shove past Steve again but his stupid giant shoulders are filling up the entire doorway. Steve wraps his hands around Tony's arms as though to stop him and Tony jerks out of his grip.
“No,” Tony replies. “You’re more.”
“Fine,” Tony says with a good natured roll of his eyes. “My big handsome husband. A wet dream of a man.”
The walk up the wide flat steps to the school doors feels like a climbing a mountain and the minutes feel like hours. Tony's feet feel heavy and leaden and his heart is beating a mile a minute with a mixture of rage and grief and irrational shame. He knows there are crowds of students gathered behind the reporters, watching, staring, and judging. He clenches his fists tight to keep from decking any reporters that get too close.
The tiny restaurant is owned by an elderly woman who doesn’t speak any English but she knows just enough French for Steve to order their food. He wins her over with his clumsy American accent and his earnest “
“Steven draws comic strips of us as a group of superheroes who save the world together in his spare time,” Thor says. “You should show Tony your drawings sometime. They're terrific!”
“It hasn’t only been a month, Tony,” Bruce finally says.
“Hey, hot stuff,” Tony says quietly.
Steve concedes defeat first, and getting the hint, Tony throws down his hand too, even though he has a pair of aces. He makes hasty excuses about being tired for the both of them as they scramble up to leave. He can tell their friends don't buy that for a second if the exasperated look Sam and Bucky exchange is any indication, but he couldn't care less when Steve's hand is clasped tight in his own and the promise from the bus is echoing in his head.
, he's so lost in the kiss.
From the corner of his eye, he can see Natasha frowning. “I’m not nice to you just because you’re sad.”
Tony’s Twitter notification dings just as he steps out onto the sidewalk and with a frustrated groan, he flicks the app closed before his eyes can linger too long on the photo someone already posted of him and Steve kissing in the hall.
“Nothing as crazy as what you listed,” Steve says gently. Tony is not consoled by his tone. “One is, you must attend all my games and the after parties.” He ignores the face Tony makes.
He nods and doesn’t ask anything else. He doesn’t bring up Pepper again.
Students are not usually allowed outside to get lunch and Steve, goody two shoes, never done a thing wrong, perfect football team captain
It's not really a lie. Most of the letters really are meaningless by this point.
They should probably have an actual conversation, but even the thought of talking about it is more than Tony can bear, and so he resorts to using physical intimacy like a weapon. If Steve catches on to Tony’s distraction tactics, he doesn’t say anything about it. The first couple of times, he gives Tony a wry look, but he seems to be all too happy to drop the conversations too when there are much better things to do with his mouth.
“NDA?!”
They lapse into a silence that stretches long and heavy. Outside the Compound, the city looms in the far distance, a small speckling of lights. Tony remembers them being far brighter and much more abundant. Everything is too dark and too quiet, and both hang heavy, physically weighing on Tony’s conscience.
“Sounds like a shitty husband,” Steve says, the corner of his mouth tilting up.
“So,” Steve says, tightening his arms around Tony again, “I had this whole thing planned for Valentine’s Day where I was going to confess my love and everything, clear this whole thing up so you weren’t under the impression I was pretending. I was going to ask you to go steady and go to prom with me. It was going to be really romantic, Sam and Bucky were helping me plan all of it. There were flowers and balloons involved.”
Mark LXXXIV almost perfect. He marvels at the way the nanobytes crawl from the new arc reactor up his arm, fluid like water and tensile as Kevlar. The canon that forms around his hand blasts a hole nearly through the reinforced wall of the testing lab. Almost there.
“Guess it's your lucky day, Rogers. I kinda love you too.”
“It's been a bit weird to see people with their phones aimed at me whenever I turned around all day,” Steve continues. “A lot of the posts I saw in the couple of minutes I bothered to go online haven't really been flattering. Figured it would be good to escape for a bit and go outside, get away from the scrutiny for even an hour. It got overwhelming to be in there. Felt like I was surrounded, you know.”
“And no kissing?” Steve’s voice sounds a little off. He’s probably grossed out at the idea of kissing Tony, but he’s going to do it for the sake of their charade anyways.
Too soon, Tony is teetering on the brink of coming, and still Steve is relentless with his strokes. Tony's throat is dry and he barely has the ability to form words, garbled sounds falling from his mouth that only vaguely resemble Steve’s name. He tries to tell Steve he’s almost there, but the only sound he makes is another loud, keening moan.
fun. Instead, they're on a bus to the Poconos with the other seniors, headed towards a unchaperoned long weekend of debauchery, contraband alcohol and knowing some of their other classmates, lots of drugs. All under the guise of the student council taking them on a ski trip.
Tony laughs bitterly and it's an ugly sound. “Yeah, J. I saw them kissing in the hallway.”
Tony is gathered in the living room with his favorite people in the world, with the promise that Pepper will come by later with Rhodey who is finally home. Calling Rhodey hadn't been easy, but he had sighed much the same as Pepper, called him silly for worrying anything could've come between their friendship (“we've known each other for ten years, Tones. Have a little trust, man”) and promised to box his ears the moment he comes through the door for not telling him about Steve firsthand and he had to hear it from Pepper. All in all, Tony is relieved Rhodey is home.
This is home, in the truest sense of the word.
“Hey, gorgeous,” Steve says, voice low and rough.
Steve stands close to Tony the entire time, his bulk a warm press against Tony’s side and his hand a warm grip around his fingers. It’s really not bad at all, Tony decides when the train arrives with a
Steve takes him to a little deli at the end of the block. It’s a small squat bodega cramped next to a high end furniture store. The front has a hand-painted sign and there are wooden stands full of slightly wilted flowers near the door. The interior is stocked with overflowing shelves filled with cereal and baby food and cleaning supplies with a wall of clunky old glass faced refrigerators housing endless brands of soda and artisanal waters towards the back. A long counter housing enough candy to make Willy Wonka jealous sits towards the front with a grill somewhere in the far back and a handwritten menu listing sandwiches hangs overhead. Tony shouldn't even be surprised anymore, but the guy behind the counter knows Steve by name too.
“You can say it,” Tony says listlessly as he stares up at the ceiling after telling Natasha everything about his fake relationship with Steve, from the letters to the thought of hurting Pepper and Rhodey to the fake relationship agreement with the hopes of winning Peggy back. And the irrational pain of their stupid plan succeeding. It feels slightly easier to tell his friends now that he’s told Jarvis, but all of it still hurts. “I’m an idiot.”
Even Loki gets infected with school pride by the mid season game, probably because his stepbrother Thor is on the football team, but Tony doesn't have a drop of team spirit in his blood. Friday afternoons are spent in high expectation of the night to come, especially if their team is playing someone important, and Tony sits blankly through the lunchtime conversations, not paying one bit of attention.
There are people everywhere, and everyone wants a piece of Steve as they try to move through the rooms. Steve's large hand is held tight in Tony's grip as they try to navigate through the well wishers, Steve politely but firmly circumventing any attempts at conversation. Steve uses his bulk to bulldoze through the swarm, pushing past the throngs of people crowding makeshift dance floor of Thor's dining room packed with gyrating bodies.
, you uncultured swine,” Loki says, looking like he's about to tear his own hair out.
“I will not have Iron Man disparage my gorgeous husband like this,” Steve replies with a smirk, his fingers lightly pinching at Tony’s side.
Tony grins as he leans in to mouth along the length of Steve’s cock. He lightly nips at the skin as he strokes the head lightly with his hand, trailing a wet path down to the base. He licks back up to suck at the head, pressing his tongue against the underside as Steve moans and his hand in Tony's hair tightens slightly.
“This one is stupid,” Tony replies. “And trust me to find the only stupid one.”
run on a holiday?”
Eventually, they resort to simply holding each other close as they sway to the beat, Steve trying his best not to move his feet at all. Steve's hands are cupped loosely around the dip of Tony's waist, easily spanning the full width as his thumbs stroke along the line of his hips, slow and careful beneath the borrowed varsity jacket Tony is still wearing.
This was what they were working towards, wasn’t it? This is the end goal, and Steve is finally getting what he really wants. This is Steve’s choice, and it would have been the same even if Tony presented him with the option of a real relationship. Tony has always known this was coming, and he was still
“Is it the mirror? We can get rid of it.”
“Yep,” Steve replies as he tugs him out the school doors. “Today is one of the only days I don't have practice.”
Tony leans up for another long kiss, one that deepens into something soft and slow, and Tony can’t get enough of him, can barely believe he can have this, have
Tony bites back a breathless laugh as he settles his cheek against his arm, enjoying the way he knows Steve is staring at him, admiring the tattoo that had once started as a joke. Steve will never admit to liking it, but Tony knows it drives him crazy to see his name on Tony’s skin like this. He can feel Steve’s fingertips trace the letters and follow further down to the dip in his spine and lower still. He gasps when he feels Steve’s large hands settle on his ass, kneading at him and spreading him open. And then there’s the warm gust of Steve’s breath against his skin and the unmistakable wet trail of Steve’s mouth against the tight furl of his hole.
Tony sighs, knowing the battle is lost, and goes for broke. He rises on his tiptoes as they stop at Steve's locker, and with everyone watching, he presses a kiss to Steve's cheek. He grins wide, paparazzi bright before walking away with a coy, “see ya later, big guy.”
He tucks his head down and chips away at his MIT application bit by bit and eyes the Boston apartment rental website contemplatively. He has more important things to think of than football. Tony, personally, has a few hangups about the football team anyways. Namely, one captain in particular.
They don't end up going very far but the novelty of being able to leave school during fourth period is exhilarating and amazing. The sight of the brightly colored trees in the early afternoon light is extra beautiful and the crunch of dry leaves underfoot is extra satisfying. Even the smoggy city air feels great against Tony’s skin and he feels as though he’s just been released from jail. The bite of the late October chill does little to dampen his spirits despite his lack of a coat. The entire time, Steve keeps his arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulders.
And there’s the heavy thought that in a few short years, Rhodey is going to be far away, training for combat to possibly be deployed into an active war zone and he’ll be too far from Tony’s reach to save and what if the weapons he builds for SI aren’t enough to keep their own people safe not enough to keep Rhodey safe what if what if what if—
His heart is trying its hardest to beat its way out of his chest so it may land in Tony's hands as Tony's tight heat welcomes him again and again. There’s nothing but their shared breaths and shared space and shared bodies, as close as they can possibly get without metamorphosing into one creature. What can possibly describe what they’re doing, if not making love?
That year, on the last day of summer, Tony remembers the silk hatbox and writes his first letter, and he puts Janet out of his mind. They stay friends, but the thought of loving her never comes around again.
. He’s missed so much.
“I know,” Pepper sniffs. “But I'm also not crazy like you. I only took on what I knew I could handle, and I still get to sleep.”
Steve shakes his head and buries his face against Tony's shoulder as he shakes with rising laughter. The situation is so absurd, Tony starts laughing too, little chuckles that bubble out of his throat as he absently pets Steve's hair while they both struggle to gather themselves.
Last year after he lost his mother, Tony holed up in his lab, working on one project or another for SI and doing his best to ignore the festive cheer and forget things like holidays and families exist for other people. Pepper and Rhodey had to pull him out of his work just to eat. Their saddened fondness was often more painful and unbearable than lack of family ever felt. He’s never really known what a holiday should feel like, but he thinks maybe what he has now is what the storybooks and movies are trying to sell.
“That you are, sir,” Jarvis says drily from the other side of the kitchen where he's preparing dinner. “I'm quite sure Mister Rogers will be amply impressed with your delicious cupcakes.”
What must be two hundred pounds of muscle is suddenly pinning Tony immobile against the couch as dexterous fingers wriggle against his ribs. Tony shrieks and howls, trying desperately to writhe away as Steve laughs and presses his fingers harder into his sides.
“That sounds good, Pep,” Rhodey says. “I’m going to miss you guys,” he adds and it’s all Tony can do to keep the tears in when Rhodey bites his lip like that, as though he’s about to cry too.
“Now, you said letters,” Loki continues. “Plural. Who else did you write to?”
Steve wordlessly stands to pour Tony a cup of coffee that he slides over, and Tony sits.
Tony hums quietly to himself as he stands at his vanity, pulling out drawer after drawer of neatly organized trays. He taps at his chin thoughtfully as he browses his collection, running gentle fingers along each watch face as he thinks.
Tony turns unsteadily to see someone running out from the clearing of trees behind them. There are black spots crowding the edges of his vision but he fights for consciousness, in case he and Nebula might have to defend themselves. His legs are unsteady even as his tries to plant them firmly.
“Jealous?”
“Gosh, Tony, I'm so sorry.” The kicker is that Steve really
, Tony thinks, his heart feeling leaden and heavy. Steve has someone who can take care of him.
Impossibly, Steve somehow catches his eye from across the field. Steve looks like he wants to run over and say something but his jaw clenches and he turns away when Tony doesn't bother lifting his head from Pepper’s shoulder.
“Hey now,” Happy says quietly in warning, stepping between them to lay a firm hand on Steve’s shoulder. Tony shudders, twisting his wrist in Steve’s grip, but the hold is strong.
“The plan is perfect, see,” Tony interrupts excitedly, ignoring the vise squeezing his heart. “You help me fix this awkward state with my friends by fake dating me so they can see the letter to Pepper is meaningless and I help you get back together with the love of your life! It's so simple. It's ingenious. We get together, it makes Peggy a little bit jealous, and she realizes she can't live without you, and she’ll beg for you to go back to her.”
Tony throws his head back against the pillows, his neck a long smooth column Steve wants to taste. He presses his tongue against the skin there, tracing a wet line up to his jaw, while his fingers thrust shallowly to open Tony up for his cock.
It takes three months, but Tony is so excited to show his father what he'd made by the time he's done. He has a plastic robot arm with three clunky fingers that can close around a small plastic ball and pick it up. It also has a set of remote controllable wheels and makes a beeping sound. He is so sure his dad will be proud of him. His dad has been going on and on about how Starks are supposed be strong and brilliant and clever and inventive. Here Tony is, inventing!
Steve’s smile is still trembling at the edges, and so full of open joy it sets the butterflies in Tony's stomach into another frenzy. Tony's heart clenches in his chest, echoing his own happiness and excitement. For the billionth time, he wonders how he got so lucky and thinks wondrously back to how they even got to this point, to stand before each other now with their friends and family in witness on this day.
Tony grins. “It’s getting better.”
The soft blue glow is a comfort in the dark of night when he wakes gasping for breath, hands immediately flying to his ribs, looking for a wound that’s already healed. His hands find the empty space on his sternum where his arc reactor had attached, gone now into the guts of the
Tony swivels quickly and nearly elbows whoever is behind him before he realizes it’s Steve. It’s just Steve.
Steve is unfazed as he stares down the line of offense, his throws arching in tight spinning spirals, perfectly controlled tosses that land precisely between Bucky's cupped hands on the other end of the field. Tony watches the displays of powerful gyroscopic precession with rapt fascination, and thinks he can write formulae and equations and theorems for Steve's plays, ballads and sonnets arranged in numbers.
By the time fourth period lunch rolls around, Tony is frantically unloading his textbooks from his locker into his bag. He's going home before something else happens. He is
Loki makes a noise of consideration. “Who else?”
It’s over. Their nonrelationship. Their agreement. Their charade. Whatever.
Steve’s thumbs are sweeping along the skin at the dip of Tony’s back. Tony knows he’s tracing the tattoo there. The words “Property of SR” that were once a joke are now Steve’s favorite tattoo on Tony’s body, one he appreciates thoroughly at least once a week when he has Tony spread open on their sheets as he slowly eats him out until Tony is a whimpering babbling mess. Now, he traces over the letters blindly, the blunt of his nails scraping against the sensitive skin of Tony’s lower back, drawing raspy moans from his throat as Steve thrusts up into him again and again.
“Which is what?” Steve asks in a tone that very much says he would like to leave.
“Just look at you,” Steve pants. “It's like you were made for me. You're so beautiful. Fuck,
She runs inquisitive hands up Steve's arms, shaking her head in admonishment when he winces away from her. “You’re overworking yourself,
“Hey there, beautiful,” Steve whispers as he drinks in the sight of his husband spread out underneath him. Tony is all gilded skin and lean muscle and dark eyes surrounded by inky lashes, Steve’s beloved and only. He closes his hands around the tops of Tony’s thighs to draw him in closer and with some gentle coaxing and encouragement, Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist.
“I gotta go, Rhodey. I'll call you next week.”
style,” he tells Steve imperiously. “It’s called artfully tousled. One of the children told me,” he says but quiets under Steve’s gentle hands as he gently finger combs Tony’s unruly locks into some semblance of order.
The streets are quieter than Manhattan. Instead of harried businessmen and oblivious tourists, Brooklyn streets are mostly filled with families walking dogs and strollers. The pavement is covered with carpets of bright leaves that crunch underfoot. The evening light shines down on them through the gaps in the trees that line the streets as the sun sets to the west, the gold and purple unobscured by tall glass spires and concrete towers.
A deep rumble sounds from Steve’s chest as he closes in, pushing up on the lip of the pool to climb out. He moves quickly to the chair and leans over Tony, settling between his legs. He smells of sharp chlorine and salt, and Tony moves in to get a taste of the water dripping down the line of Steve’s neck. He can feel Steve’s large hand like a searing brand where it closes around the curve of his ass to pull his leg over Steve’s hip, fingertips pressing into the sensitive skin and dragging a moan from Tony’s lips as he arches up against his husband’s chest, needing to be close.
He looks into the mirror to watch the both of them as he strokes his hands down Tony’s sides. The familiar warm skin feels like home beneath his palms. He loves the way they look together, the contrast of Tony’s olive skin against his own paler beige, colored by the inks of their tattoos. The way his own bigger shoulders frame Tony’s smaller size like a frame to a painting, Tony slotting perfectly into the circle of his arms.
“Uh,” Tony says intelligently, a small burr of suspicion burrowing its way under his skin.
. I had these—romantic notions. My mom showed me letters Howard wrote to her and I was inspired. So I wrote some letters of my own. I would write one when I developed a new crush but I never sent any of them. They were just catharsis, my way of letting go of my romantic feelings for the people I write about and they’re not meant to be read by anyone. Yours was written impulsively. No big deal. They don't mean anything,” he adds, clamping his mouth shut before his rambling really takes off.
She pulls away with a sigh and reaches over to hug Pepper. “We’re about to head out, James,” she says gently to Rhodey, and heads back to the car while he says his goodbyes.
Behind them, Rhodey’s parents are finishing up loading the car with the rest of Rhodey’s things. Despite Tony’s offer of letting them take the SI jet, they had politely declined, wanting to drive their only son to college, even as Tony shudders at the idea of driving four hours. They’re loading in the final suitcase and it’s almost time. Tony’s best friend is leaving.
They start finding each other in the early hours of the morning. The first time it happens, Tony had just stumbled from his lab into the kitchen after tinkering with Mark LXXXV to make her better, perfecting her code. Steve is sitting at the counter with a plate of peanut butter sandwiches at his elbow as he scrolls through his tablet.
Steve, it turns out, is a pretty terrific fake boyfriend. Almost perfect, in fact, to the point where it’s unfair how great he is. He’s kind and considerate and observant and caring and he’s driving Tony insane.
“It gladdens my heart to have the house warm and full of laughter again,” Jarvis says.
Rhodey has been with him since he was a scrawny kid stepping foot for the first time in Boston, scared out of his wits and trying his damnedest to hide it. Rhodey had seen right through his cracking bravado and adopted him as little brother and best friend, and they have been inseparable since.
Pearl buttons glimmer in a straight line along his sternum, shimmering against the intricate white lace of his shirt. His jacket is long, nearly to his knees and colored a pale dove grey. His pants are tailored to skim the top of his shoes, oxfords buffed to a high shining gleam. His hair is pushed back out of his face, spots of concealer dotted on his cheeks to hide the redness on the worst of his scars. It’s as good as it’s going to get.
“Never had anyone to build a fort with,” Tony replies, not wanting to tell Steve that he never had the luxury of simple childhood pleasures like this. Most of his childhood was spent shadowing Howard so he could learn the workings of SI and after that, he was building projects and manufacturing weapons for his father's company.
“Didn't mean you, Barton,” Tony replies, pulling Steve's arm up to go around his shoulders and burrowing into his side as Steve chuckles.
On the sixth day, Saturday, he spends a day in his lab, barely able to eat, and drowns himself in work. He’s fine until he isn’t. It’s a wire that finally tips him over the edge. A red wire that would not cooperate with him, and the rage boils over from one second to the next. He hurls the motor he spent hours working on across the room, relishing in the way it breaks against the concrete floor.
Tony doesn't sleep for an entire week. All of his spare time is spent in the labs, tapping away at his SI laptop, trying his best to fix the project Howard tore apart with a handful of barbed words. That's the thing with Howard, he expects everything out of Tony and doesn't realize soon, Tony won't have anything left to give, not when he's this exhausted and running on empty. He reaches for his coffee cup only to remember he doesn't have any coffee left.
. Your heart that I love so much. A heart big enough for everyone.”
Tony knows intellectually this is all brought on by simple adrenaline, it's meaningless, but the desire burns firebright through his veins and he doesn't want to stop. His mouth opens against Steve's, and he can feel the warmth of Steve's tongue sliding against his own, hot and slick. The rest of the stadium fades away until it feels like it's just the two of them. He's floating, weightless in Steve's arms and all he knows is Steve Steve
Tony ignores the rest of the players and watches as Steve leans in to hug one of the cheerleaders. Peggy. His girlfriend. She looks so small in his arms, Tony notices. She slots into the crook of his shoulder like she's a puzzle piece made to fit Steve and they're so disgustingly perfect. She laughs prettily at something he says and whispers something in his ear before she pushes away from him. She gives him a soft smile and heads back to her squad, leaving Steve to stand in the middle of the field watching her walk away, expression unreadable.
Tony makes a loud noise to cut him off, but the teasing does its job. The butterflies in his belly settle a little, and his nerves calm just the slightest bit. The thrum of anticipation and excitement still feels like a livewire beneath his skin, but Rhodey’s calm steadying presence soothes him, and Tony is overwhelmed with how grateful he feels to have his best friend by his side.
“Get my best side,” Steve had said to Peter as he raised his camera.
Steve Rogers’ normally handsome face is twisted dark with rage, his eyes narrowed into angry slits. He's leaning so far into the other guy’s face, Tony has a hysterical moment where he thinks the reporter might fall onto his ass to get away from Steve.
“Every morning?” Tony asks.
She's definitely sassing him too, and to be fair, he's not really sure why the batter is green this time. They're supposed to be vanilla cupcakes and he doesn't even remember buying food coloring, nor would he have any reason to add it to his batter. He frowns down at the bowl in his hands.
Tony takes a final look and heaves a deep breath before turning around, feeling the hot pit of emotion bubbling in his chest swell. It’s a bright tangle of feelings he’s too overwhelmed to pick apart at the moment, and his stomach is tied up in knots. There’s a dense mass of anticipation entwined with a glowing line of excitement and happiness that heats his chest. His throat feels tight and his hands are trembling and there is a flock of butterflies flapping a tornado inside him.
Sarah makes him feel right at home, gets him to help with slicing the bread for the beef stew and shredding lettuce for the salad, simple little things just to make him feel included. She’s warm and bright and kind, genuine affection shining from her eyes whenever she looks at her son. That same affection curves the lines of her lips whenever she smiles at Tony and he is weak-kneed with gratitude, warm to the core with how easily Sarah Rogers accepts him.
“I don't want it to be,” Steve says firmly. His eyes are bright as he pulls Tony in for another kiss, a long press of lips that feels closer and warmer and far more desperate than the ones before.
. It doesn't stop Tony from selfishly taking while he's able, treasuring each minute they spend together, and making every excuse for just one more second, one more moment.
Janet gives him a sharp look, her nose scrunched in thought before her expression smooths into a slow smile. “I just know,” she says. “You're smarter than that. I can tell.”
“Pepper?” Tony manages to rasp, shaking. “How’s Pepper? Rhodey? W-where's Rhodey? D-d-did Rhodey—”
Steve doesn't say anything for a long time. He looks like he’s chewing lemons. The coffee between his hands is cold now and he still hasn't touched the remaining half of his sandwich.
sorry I’ve done anything to make you think otherwise, and if you really don't feel the same way about me, I can understand that too. Or if you don’t yet, but you’re willing to give me a chance, I would spend the rest of our days proving how much I love you. I just needed to—I needed to tell you this. I didn't want you to keep thinking I was pretending this whole time.”
. He's such a dummy. Tony is a dummy.
“You have it so bad,” Nat murmurs into his temple, where she presses a soft kiss to the curls there.
Tony pretends to glare at her as she giggles. “Only an
“Yep,” Tony replies. “Top secret and all. Happy is on your six and I have a Dragunov across the street waiting on my signal if this doesn’t go as intended. Red dot on your forehead and everything.”
Steve doesn't refute that he's going to remove all of his limbs and throw him into a fifty-five gallon drum of concrete though, Tony notices.
Steve's eyes are half lidded and dark in the dim light when he raises his head slightly. His voice is rumble deep when he says regretfully, “we didn't make it.”
Tony raises his arms to loop around Steve's wide shoulders as he tries to tuck his face against Steve's neck. He smells good from his post-game shower, like coconut and ocean. He wants to stay hidden in the curve of Steve's neck forever but Steve settles a gentle hand on the curve of Tony's jaw and tilts his head back up with the tips of his fingers until they're face to face again.
“I must have hundreds of drawings of you by now,” Steve confesses. “You’re all I want to draw anymore. I must’ve filled books and books with drawings of you by now, starting way back from when I first met you. All I can draw is you, all I can think about is you, all I
“What kind of stipulations?” Tony asks suspiciously.
“Jarvis….” by this point, the tears are free flowing, and Tony swipes harshly at his cheeks, trying to scrub the tears away.
How ridiculous it is now, to ever think Steve had been as small as Tony, as he stares incredulously at Steve's bulk towering over the reporter who looks like he's about to cry. Steve is huge now, with broad hulking shoulders that look like they can hold up the world, big hands gripped in the reporter’s shirt as he snarls in his face, star quarterback in all his intimidating glory.
That doesn’t make Tony feel any better or worse. All of the rage and sadness empties out of him in a rush as his stomach sinks to his knees with the quiet settling of everything. He just feels numb.
“Thank you, J,” he murmurs, stubbornly trying not to think of that inevitable future. He rubs absently at his chest as he leans against Jarvis, standing in a comfortable silence for a moment while they watch the snow fall outside the kitchen windows.
Tony is breathless, tingling all over by the time Steve guides a slick finger inside of him, unbearably gentle and Tony cannot stand it. He knocks Steve’s hand away after two fingers and despite the soft protests, Tony sinks down on him with fevered determination as Steve stares up at him with wide eyes. He relishes the burn as he takes Steve’s cock, the thick length burning hot like a brand inside him.
The house is cozy and everything is just the slightest bit disheveled and cluttered. There’s the smell of old paper and patchouli, and Tony can imagine what the place must be like during the holidays as he traces careful fingers over the plastic orange leaf garlands strung over the chipped fireplace mantle and the half melted pillar candles tucked in the corners. It’s warm, homey. It's so easy to imagine Steve living there, in the house that feels like a home.
“I didn’t do anything,” Steve replies.
“Drats,” Steve says mildly, not looking the least bit bothered as he picks up another fry and offers it to Tony. “There goes all of my big plans.”
“You can't just add players midcampaign, Thor,” Bucky growls impatiently. “That's going to upset the game and undermine a long campaign we all worked really hard on.”
Janet is beautiful, petite with delicate pixie features and sharp of wit. They become fast friends.
In the split second between the question connecting in his brain but before Tony can register what is really happening, the recorder clatters onto the ground in front of him and someone’s foot stomps on it, crushing it to pieces. The foot kicks the pieces of plastic away for good measure, and the hand that was gripping Tony’s arm is flung violently away from him.
Rhodey coughs lightly, bringing their attention back to him and Tony watches as a knowing grin spreads across his best friend's face. “Do I even need to ask if you’ll take each other to be your lawfully wedded spouses?”
“Untrue,” Tony mutters. “She does not make me uncomfortable.” There’s the familiar swell of guilt rising in him. How can Peggy be so lovely and selfless when Tony’s been nothing but shitty and selfish towards her?
"But maybe," Steve says quietly, "things happen the way they do for a reason."
Janet texts him sometime during second period. “
He takes it gratefully and downs three large gulps of the scalding hot drink before he manages to rasp, “Pepper….”
Steve is surprisingly compliant, even leaning into Tony and pressing him up against the locker and bracketing him with his huge arms. And the kiss, it's surprisingly
He and the team haven't gotten off on the best foot but they're getting there. Steve's best friend in particular wasn't all too taken with Tony at the start.
Not for the first time, Tony wonders fondly how someone like Steve Rogers even exists. He shakes his head. “No,” he admits. “But I want to.”
“Where have you fucked off to now, boy?” Howard growls as soon as Tony picks up, his words slurring together. He sounds like he’s about three drinks in; he’s only just started.
“Hey, you,” Steve replies, pulling him in for a kiss as his hand tightens around the crest of Tony's hip. His fingers slot perfectly along the day old bruises there, squeezing softly before his palm slides down over the curve of Tony's ass and further still to the dip of his spine.
“C’mon, c’mon,” Tony begs, whimpering when Steve draws out nearly all the way before sliding back in. He's barely coherent as he's blissed out on how full he feels, reveling in the slight burn as Steve presses into him again and again. All he can feel is Steve, deep inside of him, a thick fullness that feels overwhelming because there's so
“Howard pays them enough in donations,” Tony reminds her, rubbing a hand over his burning eyes. “He basically funded this lab.”
“Look, Rogers,” Tony says, not unkindly. “It’s not that I don’t trust you not to spill all my secrets to the press and sundry but I really can’t take that risk. Especially not with college next year, and my dear old dad breathing down my spine about keeping a squeaky clean image for Stark Industries. It’s nothing personal. It’s just business. Now, please
, whatever it is
“You’re a menace,” Steve repeats, rolling them over to pin Tony underneath him, his hand catching Tony’s to push it down on the pillow above his head. Their cuffs clink together as Steve leans down for a kiss.
Steve is sprawled on the rug dozing with his head in Tony’s lap. “You were elected, Madam President,” Tony laughs. “You even nominated yourself,” he reminds her as he runs gentle fingers through Steve’s golden hair. Steve’s eyes are closed as he smiles and burrows deeper against Tony’s stomach.
Steve's eyes are steady and impossibly blue when he looks back at him. “Yes,” he says.
“Happy, please drive,” Tony croaks around the boulder stuck in his throat.
Tony sighs, taking a sip of his tea. It's too hot and it burns his tongue, but he welcomes the pain. He relishes the sting that distracts him from the bigger ache that claws at his chest.
“I can just see the headlines tomorrow. ‘Captain America Gropes Husband at Stark Industries Fundraiser,’” Tony declares with a dramatic wave of his hand.
“Anyways,” Jarvis continues, “I don't think I shall ever be able to capture exactly those things, but I'll be happy to spend the rest of my life trying. I do look forward to drawing and painting again.”
There was a time in his past life, in a farmhouse, when Tony realized he could’ve had everything he’d ever wanted. It was splayed in front of him, sprawled starfish across the narrow shared bed, broad chest rising and falling in steady breaths. Tony had watched and ached as the flutter of golden lashes brushed across high cheeks and his fingers itched to reach over and touch.
They don't talk about how they were almost friends years ago, and they don't talk about Tony's letter where he tells Steve he fell in love with him because of his courage and reckless selflessness, the defense of righteousness.
Tony can feel Steve’s steady pulse beneath his fingertips as he leans up for a proper kiss. Everything melts away as Steve leans in and their lips meet. Tony feels engulfed by his husband from head to toe as Steve bears down on him, pressing them together skin to skin, and he feels protected and safe covered by Steve’s larger body. Steve above him shades him from the morning sun, but Tony doesn’t care. He has little use for sunlight when Steve is so bright.
“I'm just going to say it,” Loki announces imperiously.
A slow smirk crosses Tony’s lips. “Silver fox, huh?” he says with a quirked brow.
Tony doesn't say anything for a moment. “I do, don't I?” he finally agrees.
Sorry about the delay on this chapter. It's been a hectic week, but we should be back to a weekly schedule now. I'm the only one writing and editing this, and all of that takes time. Thank you all for your patience, and thank you all so much for the terrific response to this fic so far!
“You should, J,” Tony says around the lump in his throat. “Your paintings are beautiful.”
too much. The rest of them? They're all little better than sheep. Everything will be paved and paid by mommy and daddy and none of them will want to reach beyond what they're given.”
The drive to Thor’s passes in a blur, admittedly because Tony is far too busy trying to climb inside of Steve via his mouth to notice anything else. Sometime during the drive, Happy puts up the privacy screen. In one moment of clarity, Tony thinks they should probably talk about this and what it means for the contract, but then Steve hooks his fingers through his belt loops to pull him in for another kiss and Tony forgets everything that's not Steve.
Everything feels different that night, and Tony isn't sure if it's the high of victory or something else that allows him to believe the thundering of Steve's heartbeat beneath his palm might be meant for him. The haze of the darkened room and loud music that echoes in his bones allows Tony to be brave and stupid and he pretends just for a little while that this is real.
Tony knows now why Steve had always seemed just the slightest bit uncomfortable with shows of wealth and offers of money. Steve had never looked like he belonged in Tony's world of modern lines and soulless glass in the city with personal drivers and butlers and high rises bearing his father's name that touch the sky. Tony can't help but wonder how Steve ended up in their expensive magnet school uptown, and thinks maybe that's a question for another day.
Tony remembers a time when they weren't complete strangers. When things were a little easier between them, a little friendlier, a little less like they were separated by a wall of ice. Tony's heart twists, the bitter taste of regret welling in the back of his throat.
Tony might've been slightly too enthusiastic biting into his, finishing off the whole thing in five messy bites. He can’t help himself, not when there’s such a perfectly crafted delicious sandwich with juicy crisp chicken, perfectly toasted warm bread, and rich creamy provolone in his hands. Now there's cheese and marinara all over his fingers and he's laughing too hard to care about cleaning his hands as Steve tells him the story of how he found Peter stuck pretzeled inside a locker in the team changing room after a practice, apparently having been stuffed in there by some cruel seniors and ended up locked in.
Steve smirks and steals Tony's orange soda to wash down his pastrami rye. “If you wanted to see me naked, all you had to do was ask.”
He can tell Steve is vibrating with tension next to him and Steve’s hand is clenched around his in a vise grip. He had assumed that as the star quarterback, Steve would be used to this kind of attention, lavish in it and revel in it, but he's wrong because Steve's spine is rigid military straight and his jaw is clenched so tightly, Tony is worried for his molars.
tuts disapprovingly when she sees their leftovers, so they keep eating to make her happy. They laugh and eat and play footsie under the table like teenagers, Tony grinning back at the gentle smile playing at the edge of Steve’s lips.
There he is on the sheet of paper, hunched over his worktop with an expression of concentration scrunching his face, a portrait of determination. The drawing is rendered in gentle strokes of grease pencil with lines that speak of great tenderness, meticulous care forming the curves of his face, the line of his nose, the shadow of his brow, the bow of his lips. Most prominent are the eyes, where Steve clearly spent the most time. Graceful curves define the shape of his lid, shadowing the wet gleam of his iris framed with dark wispy lashes, softly lit by the glow of the screen in front of him. The drawing on the page is undeniably him, but Tony has never seen himself look like that before.
He shakes with grief in the hours before dawn in his old room.
Tony doesn’t try to push her arms off of him even though their points of contact burn like acid. He can only rock back and forth as he cries and distantly, he hears Natasha’s soft sniffles and sobs too, her litany of apologies. He cries until the tears dry up and his eyes are swollen and his nose is stuffed and his head feels like it’s about to split open, but that still pales in comparison to the compounded pain in his chest. He sits still for a long time as Natasha clutches him until he can’t stand it anymore.
Tony doesn’t give himself time to adjust as he thrusts all the way down to take all of Steve’s cock, moving immediately. He bounces up and down on Steve’s dick without any real semblance of rhythm, his gasps and whimpers swallowed by Steve’s kisses. Tony is fueled by the blaze of desperation that burns deep in his chest when he’s this close to Steve, and he still wants
“I'm glad,” Sarah says. “We all need someone like that. And I'm glad you have Steve now too, honey.” She pats Steve's hand and gives them both a warm smile. “But when I saw the both of you sitting together outside that office, scraped and bloody, clinging to one another, I knew it was only a matter of time. Took you long enough,” she says, directing this to Steve.
Size eleven Converse chucks, he notes dully.
Steve is waiting in the hall just outside his physics room when class lets out. The rest of the class stare unashamedly at the both of them as they file past even as Tony stands stockstill in front of his fake boyfriend in the middle of the hall, disturbing the flow of traffic and feeling unsure of himself. The note is still clutched in his hand. He quickly shoves it into his pocket.
“Then let’s not give them anything to talk about,” Tony says reasonably, resuming his caresses along the line of Steve’s chest. Steve catches his hand before he can start undoing the buttons, but Tony can tell he’s about to give in if the way Steve’s thumb traces the Love bracelet on his wrist is any indication, eyes half lidded and darkly intent.
Then someone darts in front of him and the next two minutes happen in a blur. When asked about it later, Tony and Steve will have very different versions of the story. It goes like this: one of the vultures manage to sneak out from behind Happy and gets close enough to grab Tony’s arm, voice recorder shoved under his nose. Tony instinctively turns, startled, and makes to wrench away when the question comes.
“When I came out of the ice, I had no one, nothing. But you gave me a home. You gave me a purpose, a team, and a family. I cannot thank you enough for that, for giving me the things and people most precious in my heart, you yourself above all.
And with that, Steve stands in one swift motion before bending to scoop Tony into his arms. He laughs and tightens his grip as Tony squawks and protests, carrying him across the patio back to their room. He had been doing that all vacation, insisting on carrying Tony over every threshold. Tony complains out loud but he doesn’t struggle too hard, tucking his smile into the skin of Steve’s chest as he settles in his husband's arms.
“I do,” Steve says quietly, looking steadily at Tony. Tony can't quite read his expression but there's something warm and affectionate in his eyes and the warm hand settled at the nape of his neck feels like a promise.
“There's always next year,” Steve murmurs, looking like he's already drifting off again. “Merry Christmas, Tony.”
“Your friends are a bunch of losers,” Tony murmurs in Steve's ear, pressing the words close so the others don't hear. He thinks he might've failed when he catches Bucky’s glare directed at him. He blows him a kiss.
Tony’s first step off the ship is unsteady and painful, the badly healed wound in his waist lancing a sharp pain through his side. The second step floods him with relief, and he could cry for the feeling of Terran gravity and packed earth beneath his feet. Tony breathes for what feels like the first time in days, inhaling the sharp cold air. It smells of pine and grass, with a bite of autumn chill.
The crowd roars with thunderous blue and red applause as Steve Rogers leads them onto the field. His ridiculous shoulders look even broader underneath the uniform padding, sharply contrasting his trim waist and long legs, and despite his best attempts, Tony can't get himself to stop looking. Steve jogs onto the grass with a jovial wave to the crowd and runs a lap for his adoring fans before immediately heading for the sidelines as the rest of the team follows.
Tony moans and trembles, ruing the day he encouraged Steve to talk dirty, and his husband hasn’t stopped since, coming up with more creative and filthy things to whisper into the curve of his ear. Steve is going to be the death of him, he thinks, as his husband continues to murmur encouragement. Tony pushes back greedily as Steve feeds him his cock inch by slow inch, both of them sighing when he’s finally buried to the hilt.
He reads the letters again, and his heart crumbles. It breaks for his mother, who had loved Howard so much. It breaks for the man his father might have been once, but will never be again, the wide eyed romantic left to rot at the bottom of a bottle. It breaks for how fervently he wishes he could have known Howard like that too. It breaks for his mother, who still hopes.
“Hi,” Steve says, and his warm smile is enough to freeze Tony in place.
Natasha looks unfazed as he grabs the phone and lifts one shoulder in an unapologetic shrug. “Texting Loki to come help,” she replies calmly. “You don't have to hide your phone from me. There's nothing in it I haven't seen before. And I already knew about the sneaky photos you have of Ste—”
I'll be right there waiting for you, I promise. Just like we planned,
“Ma, please stop embarrassing the both of us,” Steve groans, dramatically thunking his head against the back of the couch.
Tony’s brow furrows in confusion. “I didn’t do anything.”
The letters are all intimately private, gorgeous words of prose and love and little mundane things that reminded Howard of Maria while he was at MIT and she was in California. Tony can feel the emotion welling in his throat as he reads, disbelieving that the Howard he knows could've written these beautiful poetic words.
Tony barely pays any attention to the game, spends the whole time tucked up against Pepper’s side, munching listlessly at what's left of his popcorn. He can't stop thinking about the odd looks Steve is always giving him and he spends the entire last quarter trying to dissect what they can possibly mean.
Tony smiles down at his arm as Steve’s broad thumb strokes along the bone at his wrist and lifts his hand to press a kiss to the back of it. He raises Tony’s other hand, the metal one, and kisses the alloy knuckles too. Tony is so grateful for the new implant that allows him to feel that soft touch in his prosthetic, but before Tony has the chance to pull him in for another, real kiss that will most definitely make them late, Steve laughs and steps away.
It's the expression Steve captured in the eyes that stuns Tony the most, the exhaustion and intensity etched in black and white on the page, expressive and lovely. They're far too beautiful to really be his eyes, but he recognizes them finally. He realizes with a heart clenching pang they’re the same eyes Steve always draws in his notes. Those drawings are usually simple little things flowing in generous curving lines and rough hatches to indicate the barest hints of shadow. Steve draws a lot of hands, Tony remembers and he'd never really thought too hard about the scribbles until now.
Tony does have to admit that the mountains are beautiful when they pull up to the lodge two hours later. They rise tall like sentinels in the distance, snow capped and dusted white from the winter storms. The resort itself is enormous, with immaculate sprawling grounds and a tall main building built almost entirely of windows and glass.
person his friends believe got a genuine letter.
Tony wants to say.
Steve sucks in a deep shaky breath. “Tony, please. Just—” he shakes his head and rubs a hand across his face. He looks exhausted, if the dark circles under his eyes are anything to go by, not that Tony cares one bit. “If you don't want an us when I'm done with saying whatever it is I need to tell you, then I'll understand and I'll never bother you again. But please, just hear me out.”
“But I'm so close,” Tony says, despite the glare Pepper levels at him. “A breakthrough is three hours away, max.”
He only stops when Tony is gasping for breath, wheezing laughter between pants for air. Steve holds him down with one large hand gripping both of Tony’s wrists pinned above his head and asks again, “Do you surrender? Last chance.”
Tony laughs, the sound ringing as hollow as he feels. “No choice. It’s never a choice with you, is it?” he asks bitterly.
There are five letters. They were written so long ago, when Tony was young and stupid and had dumb ideas about love. They were never meant to be read, never meant to be sent out. So now comes the million dollar question: how did Loki even get that letter? And if Loki has his—where are the other four?
“That's okay, I still love you,” Steve says, pulling him in for another kiss, and Tony freezes for a moment in his arms.
Steve raises his hands, palms up. “Just two minutes, that's all.”
Up close, Tony can see the shine of moisture glimmering in Steve’s bright eyes. He can’t help himself as he smiles back at Steve, reaching up with one hand to catch one of the tears with his thumb and Steve turns his head to press a soft kiss to his palm, large hand closing atop his.
It takes Tony nearly a week to work up the nerve to try to talk to Steve. When Steve gets worried about his nervous frenetic energy, Tony hastily blames it on Howard and locks himself in the labs, doing breathing exercises with his hand pushing against his chest, once again berating himself for his weakness.
“I will never leave him. It will be this, always, for as long as he will let me.
Tony stares back as he swallows slowly, feeling the jerk of Steve’s cock at the back of his throat as the bitter taste of precome coats his tongue. Soon after, there’s a warning tug in his hair, and before he can stubbornly grip at Steve’s knees to stop him, he’s getting pulled off of Steve’s dick and back into his lap.
“Oh, don't I know it,” Tony says, not quite realizing what he's said until Steve chokes on his water and Sarah laughs. He joins her in laughter despite his burning cheeks, and with a heavy ache in his chest, Tony knows he’s going to miss Sarah Rogers once the gig is up.
Tony's heart cracks open, the familiar feeling of heartbreak washing over him at those words. He knows Steve is still half asleep and he probably didn't mean that. Or maybe he thinks they can be real friends once everything is over and done, but Tony doesn't know if he can be strong enough to be around Steve once Peggy is back in the picture. Not after having a minuscule taste of what being with Steve could be like.
as an invading threat and shot it out of the sky.
Just when Tony thinks maybe it's beginning to hurt a little less, it happens.
“Tony, we need to talk,” Steve says, and Tony can hear the pleading desperation in his voice, but he has no interest in anything Steve Rogers has to say.
clause to the contract. Steve looks crestfallen when Tony presents him with the tablet, but he signs it with a sigh. Tony doesn’t quite understand his reaction, he had thought it’s what Steve wants while he waits for Peggy to come around. It’s the only possible explanation for the new direction of their fake relationship.
“Ooh, free seat,” is all the warning Tony gives before he drops into Steve's lap.
marrying Steve feels like the end of a journey. Tony remembers their first night, a decade and a lifetime ago. A fumble in the dark on a small rickety farmhouse bed, Tony full of anger and self hatred as he hissed at Steve to fuck him harder, wanting it to hurt. And now—now with Steve tenderly pushing the shirt from his shoulders and tipping him gently onto their bed as he mouths words of love against Tony’s skin and fills him up like he’ll never be empty again, handles him like something precious—how did Tony live for so long without this?
“You ready, Tones?” Rhodey asks gently.
Tony digs deep to find enough willpower to tear his attention away from Steve’s skin long enough to reply with an exaggerated pout and deep sigh, “it hasn’t been a very good morning for me.”
“That was one time,” Tony protests.
The school year starts like any other, the air turning crisp as summer backflips swiftly into fall, the northern fronts bringing wind and lower temperatures overnight. There's the sharp green scent of grass in the air with a red bite of incoming autumn as September dawns, the wind flavored with anticipation and excitement. There is already a thin carpet of orange leaves underfoot, smelling like brown bark and charcoal tinder. They crunch loudly in crackles that echo against the flat asphalt of the concrete jungle.
Steve is laughing uproariously, cheeks pinked from the cold as he leans down to kiss Tony in apology, and Tony can feel the curve of Steve’s smile pressed against his lips.
”s and “
“Tony, Tony,
so very desperately, everything aches with the intensity of what he feels for Steve, wishing fervently for any truth in Steve’s words. But it’s just sex and Tony is smart enough to know that sex doesn't equate love, no matter how carefully and affectionately Steve handles him. Tony is also smart enough to know with unquestionable certainty that Steve does not love him, and likely never will, but it's nice to believe it for just a moment when Steve is inside him and whispering his name so reverently.
“Happy has the day off and I took the train here all by myself,” Tony announces as he shoves the packages of cookies and spice cake Jarvis baked into Steve's arms and loads the boxes of presents he brought on top.
“Yes it does,” Tony says, scowling. “Come on, Rogers, follow along here. It makes perfect sense and it's the best way to avoid all around hurt. And you didn't hear the best part of this proposition.”
Tony can almost fool himself into believing everything is perfect when he's gathered with his friends on the night before Christmas Eve decorating the house. It's admittedly a little late to start decorations with two days til the Big Day, but Tony has only just finished his finals the week before and spent the first couple of his days off of school editing yet another damn project for Howard, who decided he'll be spending the holidays in the Maldives.
“You love my ass,” Steve corrects.
“You don’t have to stop there,” Tony quips as he hiccups past the tears he knows are dripping down his face by now, as their friends laugh. “You can keep going on about my merits.”
Tony thinks of the open eye of space above New York years and years and a lifetime ago, the closing oculus that would’ve swallowed him alive. Almost did swallow him whole. He thinks of the guts of the alien ship that took him lightyears from home, and the orange planet that lives behind his eyelids late at night. He can still taste the grit of red sand, a metallic tang between his teeth. He thinks of the endless tapestry of space, and realizing after fearing it for so many years, it’s quite beautiful after all and maybe it won’t be so bad to die out there in the black.
Tony isn't even aware his mouth is hanging open in shock until Steve sticks a fry between his parted lips. He barely recovers enough to say, “Rogers, you absolute deviant. You slattern. This whole Mormon cornfed farm boy facade was all a lie?!”
Tony is covered nearly head to toe in powdery white as Loki and Nat laugh at him, and Jarvis smiles indulgently. Tony doesn't understand why baking is so difficult. He’s good at chemistry, and they're basically the same thing but he's already messed up the cupcake batter twice, and he's running out of ingredients.
“You’ve made your point. I demand to be taken to bed now,” Tony rasps, his breath hitching again when Steve pinches the nipple between his fingers. Tony rolls his hips back to press his ass against Steve’s crotch in retaliation, moaning when he feels how hard Steve’s cock already is pressed up along his back.
Nebula had dedicated herself to seeking vengeance against a titan who had taken away not only her family but her life and her limbs, and she had nothing to show for it but bitterness and the regret of having aimed that bitterness at her sister.
“Hey!” Steve says, voice edged with laughter. “I resent that!”
“Hey! Fuck you, Buck,” Steve protests laughingly as he throws another handful of water in Bucky's direction, who ducks and swims away with a cackling, “No thanks!”
“You chose that character,” Steve protests.
Tony sighs, wonders if he's ever known the mansion to be warm and full of laughter but he doesn't say that. “Yeah,” he agrees instead.
Time seems to stop when Steve is settled between his legs like this, and all Tony knows is the sensation of his husband's mouth against the most intimate parts of him. He’s over-sensitive and overheated, cock flushed and pressed against the chaise with nowhere to go and no friction to be had as Steve holds him down, licking into him again and again until Tony is an incoherent mess. Nonsensical words and sounds tumble from his lips, pleas and moans for more as he tries to push back against Steve. Silver edged darkness begins to creep into the corners of his vision as he tips further and further towards the edge, but just when he thinks he can come on Steve’s tongue alone, Steve pulls away and Tony nearly sobs.
Tony can’t find any words left in himself to reply. He can only hold onto Jarvis harder as he sobs.
“That's playing dirty,” Steve rasps.
“Hi, you,” Tony replies, feeling the tenderness well up high in his throat as Steve rises on his elbows to get closer so he can press a kiss to Tony's collarbone. He instinctively wraps his arms around Steve's shoulders, as though that can be enough to keep him there and sinks back into the pillows when Steve relaxes against him, draped over Tony like a heavy warm blanket.
At home, he digs up the box he keeps full of Steve’s notes, printed photographs, ticket stubs and restaurant business cards from their fake dates. Sentimental paraphernalia Tony was too soft to ever throw out. He contemplates burning the whole thing now but something stops him. He can’t bear to do it. The first note Steve ever wrote him is near the top of the pile, a simple “I hope you’ll have a nice day today,” with a couple of heart doodles. Just seeing that scrap of paper has Tony shaking all over again. He can’t bring himself to destroy the box, but there’s enough rage in him to throw it across the room.
of liquor pouring into a glass in the background. Drink number four probably.
The thoughts come unbidden anyways.
“What is this about?” Steve asks, holding up the envelope and sure, burning it might not make Steve unread it, but it would feel so fucking good to have it gone.
Tony is gasping and desperate by the time Steve gently slides his fingers free and before Tony can feel empty for too long, he's guiding his slicked cock in, hard and thick, the girth of him stretching Tony much wider than the two fingers. There's still the remnants of lube and come in him from earlier, and even with the new slick, there's just the barest hint of burn on the first slide beneath the wide swath of pleasure. Tony relishes every dragging inch as Steve pushes in, his nerves singing like livewires dancing across his skin. They're both panting by the time Steve is rooted deep inside of him, and Tony trembles, overloaded on sensation.
Pepper snorts. “I bet you tell everyone that.”
It had always been Steve. His first love, his greatest love. This is a love he had spent a lifetime running from, one he could never hope to shake, and one he didn’t think he would get to keep. But impossibly through anger, and pain, and betrayal, and hate, and happiness, and laughter, and healing, and love, they found their way home to each other. This is what the playwrights yearned for, and the poets envied. Somehow Tony gets to have this, gets to keep this, gets to keep Steve. Steve, his husband.
“Love is never stupid,” Jarvis says gently. “It can make us do foolish things, but love itself is never stupid.”
“How do I even do that?” Tony asks softly, flopping back down on his bed again. He swallows heavily to keep the confessions from spilling out.
“Is that—”
Tony smiles and arches closer, warmth washing over him. He wishes so hard for the truth in those whispered words, everything aches with the fervency of his desire. He's sure Steve can feel his echoing loud heart beneath his fingertips.
pills, the
Tony gives as good as he gets, his hands already at work with Steve’s fly. He can feel where Steve is already hard against his thigh, and he presses his palm down against him as they kiss. When he finally gets Steve’s pants open, he’s drawing his cock out to stroke along the length just as Steve’s hand reaches his nipple and pinches them between his thumb and forefinger. Tony moans low in his throat and has to draw away from their kiss just to breathe, his heart working overtime in erratic stuttering beats.
Tony knows that same shame of failure. He was close too. He drew first blood on Titan, and yet. And yet.
Steve's house sits on the corner of a quiet block, a little two story brick with storybook windows and a cheerful yellow door. It has a small front yard with meticulously trimmed hedges surrounded by a white metal fence.
“Ty Stone.”
Tony's hand smarts where he's still holding it up and open in offering. He quickly pulls it tight against his chest, rubbing at the ache he finds in between his ribs. There's an expanding pressure that overwhelms the burn on his palm but rubbing at it does little to soothe the pain there. The warm swell in his chest cracks open, wet and gushing over his heart and it burns, it
Tony tucks his face into the crook of Steve's shoulder and sighs. “I'm—better now,” he says, honest.
“Turn around,” Steve says, his voice rough and low.
front page scandals on my watch.”
There's a lump in Tony's throat he has to work past to ask, “And what happens if you don't get one?”
It's probably one of the most luxurious things Tony has ever experienced to wake up in the morning with Steve in bed next to him. The sun is just starting to rise in the silver hours of morning, washing the room with cold light and painting them in shades of purple and blue. The snow glimmers outside like mounds of diamonds, beckoning ice cold but the snowfall has stopped and the day is promising to be clear with blue cloudless skies.
“You should be,” Tony replies, stripping off his coat and scarf. “I had to wait for over half an hour for a downtown train and I didn't give in to the urge to call an Uber. Why the hell does
The kisses continue their path south, pausing to trace each nipple. Tony moans and arches up towards Steve, chasing the sensation of his lips when the kisses edge further down. Steve stops just above his cock, and Tony could cry for the sudden abrupt halt to Steve’s kisses.
Inside, the furniture is mismatched and overstuffed, comfortable old things that Howard would deem below him to even touch, but Tony gleefully runs his hands over all the soft worn fabrics. The walls are wrapped with faded blue wallpaper splashed with gardenias and little yellow flowers that bring sprigs of cheer throughout the rooms.
“Get a room,” Bucky says, raising his own fistful of kernels.
“I hate all of you,” Steve mumbles, burying his face against Tony's neck. The shiver Tony feels traveling down his spine is a simple reflexive physiological response to stimulus on the sensitive skin of his neck, and nothing more.
“Sap,” Tony counters, but his smile grows.
Tony nearly swallows his tongue at Steve's casual mention of their wedding, as though their relationship is real, as though that's something they can possibly have. He ignores it, knows it's probably just a meaningless phrase Steve doesn't even realize he said, and he wills it not to hurt.
“Valentine’s Day—”
Tony swallows hard, feeling a weighted heaviness that bobs low in his throat and sees Steve in the reflection looking back just as headily, blue eyes dark and sharp. There’s a small smile curving his lips that grows wider as he turns away from the mirror to walk back to their vanity, his long legs moving in slow loping steps, a predator on the prowl. Tony feels pinned, like a prey animal for the taking, but instead of pulling Tony in for deep kisses and forgoing the night’s events for their own night in, Steve reaches around him before stepping away again.
fuck.
Tony smiles and stands on his toes to kiss Jarvis on the cheek. “Pass that on to Ana for me, J. I'll come by day after Christmas.”
enough to get so deep. He has no one to blame but himself; this is all his own fault.
“He made us dress up in costume too,” Sam continues, pointing an accusing pickle at Steve. “And not just any costume! We had to make them. It's part of the experience, he says. I had to spend the entire weekend walking through giant crowds with enormous wings strapped to my back.”
“I expect these distractions to cease once the weekend is over,” Howard says, his voice deadly low. There’s the clink of glass and pour of drink again. “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re up to, boy. This so-called relationship of yours? I know all about it, seen your shameless parade on social media. There’s only so much I’ll tolerate. Make sure these distractions don’t get in the way, or I’ll remove them for you.”
“Hey, Steven Grant Rogers,” Tony begins, the start of another smile tugging at his lips.
Steve doesn’t have anything in mind when he crosses the room quietly and slips behind Tony, only knowing he needs to comfort his husband and erase the sad expression from his face. He loops his arms around Tony’s middle where they fit perfectly at the notch of his waist and it says a lot for both of them that Tony doesn’t startle. He simply sighs again as he melts against Steve’s chest.
Tony sighs and smiles gratefully at Jarvis when he hands him a steaming mug of coffee. He pushes off and away from the counter, mentally preparing himself for another long night in his lab.
Steve waves cheerfully at the security guard at the desk who, to Tony's amazement smiles and greets Steve by name as they head out the front doors, “Don't forget to grab me a Pepsi, Steve.”
Usually his memory is pretty damn good, but at the moment he has no recollection of what he might've done to make Loki look so uncomfortable and he's the guy who usually takes all of Tony's weird quirks and grossness in stride and matches it with his own.
“Well then,” Steve says, a slow smile tugging the corner of his lips. “Guess I'm leading.”
people didn’t.
Tony pulls away breathlessly as soon as he realizes what he's doing. He cannot believe he's kissing Steve in front of the whole school and their rival school like this under the bright glare of the Friday night lights but he can't help himself. He ducks down for another kiss, and another, and another. He feels possessed and unable to stop, drawn irrevocably to the feeling of Steve's lips against his own and he's already fucked, he's already addicted.
“You've never built a fort before?” Steve asks, arranging a quilt atop a haphazard frame he made with the love seat and some kitchen chairs.
Tony is regretting it almost immediately when he looks so small next to Steve. Steve is all glorious golden skin and defined muscle. Tony is scrawny and skinny, the hints of his ribcage shadowing his skin from his long work nights and days when he forgets to eat. He's tempted to cover himself, but the look on Steve's face stop his hand from reaching for his shirt.
First, Tony stops being able to sleep for more than four hours.
Distantly he hears the music start, a slow song both he and Steve love but at the moment, Tony can’t remember what the name of it is for the life of him. He takes a deep steadying breath and blinks away the tears gathered at the corner of his eyes, his blurry vision catching the end of the surreptitious swipe of Steve’s hand across his face. Beside him, Rhodey touches Tony’s elbow and they begin the journey down the long aisle towards Steve at the arch.
“You want the minutes too?” Steve says with a wry twist of his mouth.
“Take it back,” Steve demands, his eyes sparkling bright with laughter in the low light.
Their fake relationship is the ripe old age of four weeks, they’ve been on two fake dates, and Tony is finally comfortable enough to willingly hang out with Steve's team during lunch. Steve already knows Nat and Loki but Tony still isn't quite ready for him to meet Pepper and Jarvis yet, not when he’s still avoiding Pepper himself. Little steps, he supposes.
Tony sighs, the breath coming up from the tips of his toes to the top of his head, released in one long gust. “Yeah, fine,” he says, trying to inject lost cheer back into his voice. “Just SI stuff.” He waves his phone a little.
“Who else got one?” Steve asks, his tone placid and flat.
who looks inexplicably older and sadder and so, so broken, with furrows in his brow and lines around his mouth Tony has never seen before.
With his precious cargo in his arms and Tony pressing a smile against his neck, Steve makes the walk to their bed. He gently deposits Tony in the middle of it, and steps back to make quick work of removing his own pajama pants and sleep shirt. Steve watches with hooded eyes while Tony shimmies out of his shorts and slowly spreads his legs with a suddenly shy smile as Steve moves to crawl on top of him.
In the copilot’s chair next to him, Nebula sighs a soft gasp of relief. They’re alive. Somehow, impossibly, they’re alive.
Flurries of paper flutter down around Tony, giant assorted snowflakes. The scrap that lands nearest him is a copy of the school newspaper with him and Steve on the front page and Tony picks it up, holding it listlessly between numb fingers. It's the single piece of publication with him in it he's ever kept, simply because he and Steve had looked so happy in that photo. It was the night they won the state championship and they're standing front and center in the photo with the team surrounding them. Steve's face is turned away from the camera, his features cast in sharp profile as he kisses a smiling Tony's cheek.
“See,” Pepper says, “everything worked out. I can't say I wasn't worried about you when I got my letter, but I can understand, Tony. And I'm glad I got it, even though I know you don't think of me that way anymore.”
, and sheets are much easier to clean than cushion covers.”
Of course this is when Steve will tell him it’s been fun but it’s time he actually wins back Peggy for real now. And Tony will be left broken by the wayside.
“No,” Tony replies, smiling despite the fact. “But merry Christmas.”
“Yeah?” Steve says. He seems to take it as a challenge, and resumes his kisses with new determination, leaving Tony breathless and overheated as he squirms in Steve's lap.
“Yeah, Peps,” Tony says. “I'm glad I have Steve too.”
are going to sleep.”
Nat walks over to sit next to him on his bed, her small hand a comforting weight on his chest. “You’re not an idiot,” she says gently.
He spent an inordinate amount of time earlier in the day trying to decide what to wear before eventually FaceTiming Loki in a panic to beg for help. In the end, he gives up and wears his cleanest least tattered shirt, because it’s not a real date anyways. Which makes him feel like an absolute asshole when he sees Steve on the steps of the Museum of Natural History in slacks and a dark blue button down that strains across his shoulders.
Tony finds himself crowded up against the door as soon as it's shut behind them, and he returns the kiss with equal desperation, fingers reaching up to tangle in Steve's hair. Steve's strong hands are reaching under Tony's thighs to hoist him up and he instinctively wraps his legs around Steve's waist as he walks them both across the room.
This is where Tony knows he's supposed to tell Peggy how much Steve misses her, and how perfect she is for him, and Steve is doing all of this for her, but the words get lodged in his throat and refuse to come out. He can feel them rising like vomit from the back of his throat even as his feet carry him through the door and away down the hall. The words taste like bitter bile when he forcibly swallows them back down again.
When Steve startles and laughs, it feels a little like victory, and Tony can feel a little bit of his heart beginning to heal. He had forgotten what it was like to have Steve on his side, how heady and powerful he felt to have Steve’s strength and righteous conviction reflected back at him. Maybe they can get through this after all.
“Then what is it?” Steve prods gently. “You’ve been looking upset whenever you walk past it these last couple of weeks. We don’t have to keep it.”
“Why do you insist on that, J?” Tony sobs. “I've almost accepted that he doesn't.”
Jarvis gets out of his seat and comes to stand next to Tony. He strokes a hand through Tony's hair like he used to do when he was a boy, a habit Jarvis hasn't indulged in years and one Tony doesn't realize he missed as much as he did until he aches from the familiarity of the touch.
“Is that so?” Tony can feel where Steve is pressed thick and hard against his thigh and the only thought that comes to mind is
Steve laughs softly and steadies him with his thumb stroking along Tony's jaw, easing the kiss into something slower, sweeter. Tony feels a rush of blood that heats liquidhot through him as he arches closer to Steve, who moans lowly when he shifts in his lap. Steve's fingers are burning pressure points on the crest of Tony's hip and they grip tighter as he shifts again, earning another sound from low in his throat that Tony would do anything to hear again and again.
Tony could've graduated early and followed Rhodey to Boston. Why the hell didn’t he think of that? It’s not too late. Another option is finishing his senior year in Boston. It isn't too late to transfer now, is it? It is only the third week of August, he probably still has time and he can probably pay admissions to make it all go faster, and if he grabs his transcripts now and gets his application in before the semester starts—
“Sometimes that urge did get me into a lot of trouble,” Steve agrees, and curls an arm around Tony's shoulders as though hearing his thoughts, tugging him close again.
It was only a matter of time anyways, and this end is as good as any. Howard is constantly breathing down his neck, and it’s not worth his father’s ire for a relationship that isn’t even real. This is the only foregone conclusion he and Steve could’ve ever had. It’s
Admittedly, Tony has had a blissful few weeks spending every day he can after school with Steve, usually at Steve's house if he doesn't have practice and sitting on the bleachers overlooking the field if they're preparing for a game. Tony can't decide what he likes better: the late evenings when he cuddles warm next to Steve on the old couch as they run through a gamut of shows and movies they each insist the other to watch before getting up to help Sarah make dinner, or watching the team run drills with a hot coffee warming his hands from the late autumn chill, and Steve jogging up to him every so often to see what he's working on before departing again with a kiss on Tony's cheek.
Steve starts bringing him bagels, breakfast sandwiches, scones, tupperwares of oatmeal and yogurt bowls. Steve starts bringing him his morning coffees too, apparently after consulting with Natasha on how he takes it. At first, he’s shocked at the three extra espresso shots Tony adds to his coffee, but eventually he understands that Tony is so immune to caffeine at this point, he has to drink battery acid to even feel alive in the mornings.
Tony remembers the framed sketches and paintings hung in Jarvis’s house. He remembers asking about them when he was little and Ana's proud answers. He thinks also of the eyes and hands Steve doodles in the notes he gives Tony, and wonders who they belong to.
The bed next to Tony is empty and cold to the touch. That is unacceptable. They’re on their honeymoon and Tony just woke up without his husband’s arms curled around him. It’s absolutely criminal.
, Tony repeats silently to himself as he looks straight ahead, ignoring the questions.
Tony's world all but shatters and the bile rises in his throat alongside the animal anguished cry that bubbles loud and piercing. He barely realizes the sounds are escaping his mouth until the static roar in his ears dissipate slightly and he can hear Natasha again and he feels her thin arms around his shoulders as she holds him.
, but Tony simply is not strong enough. Especially not when it comes to Steve.
never was.
“Maybe,” Tony admits, his other hand already stroking along the hard length of Steve's cock as he grinds down on his fingers. “But c’mon, honeybun, don't you want to play?”
It feels strange to see Steve outside of school somehow when they meet outside of the museum on Saturday. They’ve never hung out before, not even when they were friendly and Tony feels completely out of his depth on their fake date. He’s never been on a date before, and he’s not sure what to expect, fake or not.
,” Steve whispers. Most beloved.
“Don't you fucking dare talk to him that way!” someone snarls, and it takes Tony a minute to recognize the person who had torn the reporter off of him.
He waits, vibrating with tension, Nebula equally tense beside him, her arms up and ready in defense. There will be little they can do to defend themselves if they’re faced with danger. Any guns and weapons they had were broken down and rewelded into parts for the ship.
“Hiya, Tony,” Bruce says softly, and his voice is so tired.
Tony finds it comforting somehow to know Steve is sitting in the corner of his lab as he works and nibbles his way through the sandwich Steve brought. He doesn't even need the loud music when Steve is there. His mind is clearer than it's been in days and he goes back to his code with renewed energy, getting lost in the lines. He's resolved almost all the bugs by the time he raises his head again, hours later. There are only a few minor kinks left to fix. Maybe he should have Steve around more often.
Janet can keep up with Tony's rambling brain any day of the week, and her knowledge of quantum physics far surpasses his own. She's the only one who doesn't ignore him because he speaks in tangents and she leapfrogs with him from one subject to the next. She's not scared of his parents and what the Stark name means because her own family name weighs like a similar heavy yoke. She doesn't shy from the challenge of his pendulum moods, doesn't frighten because of his short temper and bouts of melancholy.
“You’ll feel better when you’re more organized because this is ridiculous,” Natasha murmurs as she tries to navigate around his piles of garbage. She says something else in Russian Tony doesn't catch as she flicks a dirty sock off of his chair. Her mouth a moue of distaste as she sits, surveying Tony's hoarders paradise from her throne. “How did you even let it get this messy? How do you find anything like this?”
Steve takes Tony's hand in his and raises it to his lips, pressing a kiss to the rings he put there. “That’s Steve Stark-Rogers to you,” he says and watches as a flash of heat lights in Tony's eyes.
He runs for six days. For six days, Tony feels sick to his stomach thinking of what Natasha did. His whole body is left feeling cold with betrayal but his chest is redfire agony, and it's more pain than he's ever known.
Tony pretends to gasp in shock. “Why, Captain America! That’s positively scandalous!”
Maria lifts the lid carefully, and out of curiosity, Tony sidles closer to see what's inside. The hatbox is filled to the brim with envelopes, and upon closer look, they're all addressed to Maria. Some of letters are older than others, slightly yellow with age and crinkled in the corners. She lifts them one by one from the box with reverent care, placing a small stack of them in Tony's hands.
Steve doesn't say anything for a long time. He simply stares into his cup of coffee as Tony talks and just as Tony is starting to get irritated, he says, “I don't want your money and that plan makes no sense.”
His husband shushes him gently. There’s the rustle of fabric as Steve quickly shucks his pants and in lieu of Tony having to climb off his lap again, Steve simply rips the panties off. Before Tony can form the words to complain, the slick head of Steve’s cock is pressing at his entrance, and he sighs with relief as Steve finally, finally slides home inside him.
“You do archery!” Steve protests.
“None of that now,” Jarvis says softly as he stands to wrap his arms around Tony. “I know it hurts, and if I can take that pain away from you, I would. But please believe me when I say I think Steven loves you too.”
They stay friends after the summer ends and for a long time, Janet is one of Tony's only friends, his best friend after Rhodey, and Tony is besotted with her.
Tony sighs and leans against Steve's shoulder. “Long and painful.”
Steve spots an opening, his whole body twisting as he spirals the ball in a curving helix. The ball barely makes it out of his hand before Steve is tackled to the ground, buried beneath a wave of bodies and Tony leaps to his feet in outrage. He starts forward as though he thinks he can actually run down onto the grass before Pepper pulls him back down into his seat.
“Ten years ago,” Steve says, his voice serious again, “I promised you
they don’t ask.
Tony realizes he’s in way over his head sometime during the second week of their fake relationship. Sometime during the first week, Steve realizes Tony doesn’t eat breakfast and usually just downs a coffee before class. Steve takes it upon himself to start bringing Tony breakfast every day in the labs early every morning. When Tony tries to tell him he’s fine, he’s used to this, he doesn’t have time for a food break when his projects are waiting and the early bell is going to ring at any moment now, the Sullen Steve Stare is applied until Tony concedes.
“And the Peggy thing was all you,” Steve continues, barreling on. “I never once said I even wanted to get back together with her. I haven't felt that way about her in a long time, our relationship was over. We always made much better friends than we ever did as anything else and in the back of my mind, there was always you anyways, and no one could ever match up to you.” Steve sighs and shoves a hand through his already disheveled hair.
“Your husband is going to have to work very hard to get back into your good graces, isn't he?”
Steve presses a kiss to the side of his head and without even thinking about it, Tony turns so Steve can give him a proper one on the lips. Something between them has changed since the night of the state championships. The kisses are more frequent and natural, the affection free flowing, and Tony can almost convince himself it's genuine. He’s decided he’ll just enjoy it while it lasts, while he can still pretend he has Steve. He’ll deal with the aftermath when it comes.
By day four, cabin fever sets in and Tony clambers his way out of the medbay despite Bruce and Rhodey’s protests. Because he’s fine. Really. All healed, spic and span. Good as new. He just needs his own bed.
Tony tries his best to forget what Steve said as he steps into the shower. The jet of hot water pounding on his skin does little but echo the words over and over again until they ring hollow in his mind. He clenches his eyes shut and struggles to breathe. The water dripping down his face is salty and bitter by the time he’s finished, but the iron in his spine keeps his head up as he walks back out into the room.
It’s not so bad, Tony thinks as they wait on the platform for the next downtown train. It’s only moderately crowded, the odd time of day slotted right between the end of school rush and the beginning of rush hour means they’re barely jostled as other commuters jockey for position on the subway platform, craning their necks out onto the tracks to see if they can catch the headlights of the approaching train coming from the dark maw of the open tunnel.
All Tony can think is
“That’s not for you to decide,” Tony says anyways.
Tony wakes early the next morning, which is unlike him. He knows it’s early because the sun outside the large windows isn’t high enough to be noon yet and he frowns as he blearily blinks his eyes open. He immediately spots the problem, and the reason why he’s awake at such an ungodly hour.
