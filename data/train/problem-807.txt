Before long, he was leading a double life. Flirting with the nurses at the surgery, taking their numbers, but spending his nights wondering what he would do if they ever saw him dressed as a woman. He felt shame, not only towards himself for his desire to dress like a woman, but also for the pretence of doing things he felt no urge to do. He’d been so fucked up, so scarred from his years in the army, and he knew that he would be shit at any sort of relationship, but there was something about dressing up and being someone else that was therapeutic. So he dropped one love, and invested in the other.
Greg snickered behind his hand at the narrow eyed glare currently drilling a hole in John's head. Sherlock procured a key out of his pocket and without preamble, stepped forward and into John's space without so much as a forewarning.
Ella reached up to peck Sherlock on the cheek and did the same for John, to his pleasant surprise. "Bring him round again, soon. We'll make it a proper get together," she said, pointing a stern finger at Sherlock, who shrugged noncommittally.
Sherlock’s lips snapped shut, for once unable to come back with a quip or an insult, anything to run his brother off. All he felt was the burning sting of Mycroft’s question. The words “Of course not!” hovered over his tongue, heavy and uncomfortable, habitual. Yet, it would be a lie.
Afterwards, in the bath, Sherlock washed John's body with all the gentleness and knowing strokes of a man familiar with his lover’s body. John was wonderful, a perfect fit in the ‘V' of Sherlock's legs. Had Sherlock believed in a creator, then he’d be convinced that John was made explicitly for him.
Sherlock watched as the cells swelled until the membrane exploded, one after the other as if John's body were aging at a rapid pace, shutting down.
Sherlock didn’t bother knocking this time. A quick press of his ear to the door confirmed the hum of air flowing through the room’s ventilator; he could feel the gentle vibrations of it through the door. Inside, John’s bedsprings creaked and groaned, grating and metallic as he shifted on the mattress. A soft groan. Sherlock doubted there would be anyone else in the room. The last time they’d spoken, John hadn’t looked fit for company. He was sure much hadn’t changed in the short time that had passed. Night terrors, then, or just restless sleeping. Neither would be uncommon for a man recently discharged from the army.
Mycroft, Molly, Lestrade, even Irene, they were all there watching him. Mycroft was shaking his head sternly (
“Which one?” John asked, giving the human a hard stare. Sherlock's reverberating growl at his shoulder fortified his silent threat. Any games, and death would be swift.
Sherlock shrugged on his jacket, watching his son warily. “I'll be gone for a few hours at most. Is there anything you need,” he asked when Jasper still hadn't said a word. Jasper pushed his glasses up and raised his eyes from his feet, finally opening his mouth to speak.
He’d chosen his best tailored suit, the one that often received lingering looks. Although Sherlock wasn’t the best source when it came to analyzing human emotions, he knew the ins and outs of attraction, and he was no blushing virgin when it came to sex. John was not his first spontaneous fling, but he was the most unusual one. And he was, by far, one of the more extraordinary individuals he’d ever had the pleasure of meeting.
Sherlock smiled softly, crooked and charming and devoid of all the marble like quality it adopted during their row. "You care too much about what others think of you. What's between you and I, is and will always be between you and I."
John sat up, holding his weight on his forearms and reeling in his legs so that they could be closer. He wanted to feel Sherlock's weight on his back and his breaths against his neck.
From the bed, Sherlock retrieved the cotton ropes and knelt in front of John’s draped figure. “I’m going to tie your wrists together, and your biceps and thighs to the chair legs. I’ll leave your ankles free but it’s your responsibility to leave them parted, understood?”
Jim Moriarty was not someone that Sherlock had very fond memories of. Like with most of his past, Jim melded into the dark, murky waters like a creature familiar with it.
Michael laughed with authentic delight, before smiling fondly at Irene. “Melody would kill me if I missed John’s opening night.”
Holmes took a deep breath and the shutter fell over his eyes once again. He turned and flung the doors open effortlessly.
John heard a sickening snap come from the other side of the clearing, and turned to see the other wolf had the human pinned to the ground with his weight, teeth locked around the man's neck. Blood dripped from his dark muzzle as he pulled, ripping through soft flesh and cartilage, creating a gruesome display, his intelligent eyes glowing in obvious glee. John allowed himself a moment of fear, knowing that had the hunters not showed, that would have been him. This was not just a werewolf; this was a predator, a killer.
John chuckled incredulously, and the man’s eyes narrowed. “Um, yeah, well I did come to confess my sins.”
Sherlock paced, running the tremoring fingers of his free hand through his curls. “John's dying. I took another blood sample because he wasn't- he wasn't growing like he should, so I drew another blood sample. All of his cells are undergoing necrosis, self-destructing. He doesn't have long, Mycroft, send one of your lackeys - whatever you have to do.”
John pocketed his phone and waved a goodbye to Janine as the lift doors closed. His phone buzzed again ten floors down.
Mike's expression was the definition of apprehension, but John wasn't going to force the issue. Either he was going to join John in getting pissed, or he was going to do it alone. Either way,John was not ending the night sober and wanking to memories of a certain millionaire.
, John,” Sherlock shouted over his shoulder, flouncing purposefully back to John's bedroom. “We haven't got all day!”
Of course, they never knew that they were all just cheap imitations. None of them could truly match up to John. There was always something missing. This one doesn’t have the right eye shape; too large, not narrow enough, the colour was off. That one wasn’t short enough; John’s leg hair was sparse, his were too hairy, too thin, shoulders not broad enough. During the sex, he could hardly look his partner in the eyes, so he’d turn them on their belly and fuck them that way, gag their mouth shut so they wouldn’t speak and ruin the fantasy.
Sherlock would have wondered if it had all been some horrid nightmare if not for the burst of scar tissue on John’s shoulder, and the way the wings of his back jutted sharply from his paper-thin skin. Sherlock could just barely see the curving ladder of John’s spine. He’d kissed John there just before sleep claimed them both, watched the serpentine coil of it as John writhed beneath his lips. Sherlock had been mesmerized.
Before he’d even finished his sentence, John was already shaking his head in the negative. “We can't, Sherlock. Jasper-”
John strolled leisurely to his front steps, finding, to his surprise, that the door was already unlocked. He turned the knob and cautiously entered, wondering if Mike just forgot to lock up.
“Tea would be excellent,” Victor replied, collapsing into his seat with a huff. “God, if I’m not careful, I might just take a kip in this chair.”
But at a bang on the door, John ripped his hand away, panting as he nearly shoved Sherlock off, startled at the sudden noise.
Sherlock finds the perfect opportunity to isolate John when the news comes that Harriet has run off, angry with her older brother and throwing a fit that will be forgotten by the end of the night.
The smile was indulgent, but his eyes were bright and predatory, alert, as they skipped across John's face. Sherlock was transcribing his thoughts into written words, rendering his deepest emotions into tangible evidence that he could understand, and John found himself fascinated, but terrified.
John thought of the few women he'd engaged in oral intercourse, and what he liked to feel when his lover would fellate him, finding comfort in the fact that, at least, he had some reference to go by.
John was gone. It wasn't as if he would ever be there to rebuke Sherlock for being rude. It wasn't as if he could come back. He stopped by Mrs Hudson and accepted her hug with numb arms and a blank face.
The latter waved him over readily enough, while Sherlock's eyes scoured the tree line, vigilantly. He doesn't spare John a glance when he comes to stand beside Lestrade, though John can feel Sherlock's attention just as acutely as he would if the man were pinning him with his penetrative stare.
Thank you all so much for the lovely feedback on this story. I am so honored to have such wonderful, loyal readers. I never thought this fic would gain so much traction, but it's truly been a dream conversing with some of you.
Sherlock stalked around the room, fingers tapping restlessly against one another as he stopped at the unsturdy desk beside John’s twin bed. That dreadful cane leant against the wall in the gap between the bed frame and the desk. Sherlock smirked darkly to himself at another correct deduction. John obviously didn't notice that he was standing perfectly fine without the help.
Three men and a woman emerged from the line of trees, an old family of hunters that had been tracking John and his kin for months, with none of them the wiser. Stupid, stupid! How could they have missed this?
As they all prepared for the ensuing discussion, she found herself observing him and the way he hovered protectively near her son.
It was already beginning to sprinkle when they began to cover the bodies with dirt. John couldn't describe how he felt in that moment, burying the only life he’d ever lived for a future unknown. John had no idea what would happen after he killed those hunters and avenged his family. He was a man with no purpose any longer, no one to live for,
John scratched his neck, glancing back towards the stage where rehearsals were wrapping up. “Good case, then?”
John grimaced, turning onto his side so that the phone was sandwiched between his cheek and the pillow. "Yes, because I'm the one who left his lover in bed like a rent boy."
Sherlock wanted to pull away, but damn, the man cut an attractive figure, appealing and beautifully commanding. He wanted him, even if for a few hours. Sherlock was not so irresponsible that he didn't have a remedy for a situation such as the one he was currently in, sitting in his bathroom cabinet, so what was holding him back from retrieving it?
It stung more than John cared to admit, but isn't that what Sherlock told him, that relationships weren't his area? Maybe that was what bothered John more than all the other things, the tabloids and newspapers. It bothered him that there was no way he could answer their questions without coming to terms with the fact that all they had was sex. As much as it excited John, still excited him, it left a sour taste when John had to go home or sleep in an empty bed at 221B, because what Sherlock wanted from him didn't amount to more than a romp between the sheets and some power play, full stop.
There was just no possible way that John could tell his father that he was sulking because his boss, turned lover, didn't call him back after a night of shagging. Just... ugh.
The black wolf threw himself forward, artfully dodging their bullets, and John hesitated only a moment before he scrambled up and charged towards the enemies. The other wolf was a dirty fighter, a trickster, darting around and causing confusion one moment and a hair's length away from breaking every bone of their legs with sharp canines. He was intelligent and quick, where the hunters rarely had experience fighting one such as he, but they were also fast on their feet, making it hard for the wolf to get a grip, only ripping off pieces of fabric as they dodged.
John groaned, sliding down to give Holmes more room to work with. His hips stuttered as Molly simultaneously squeezed around him and Holmes’ tongue pressed flat against his arsehole, fluttering.
John shook his head, fingers itching to be buried back in that wild nest of curls. “That was amazing, I mean, what you did with the…”
… ugh. The only thing that came to mind with that horrendous word were terribly written Mills and Boon publications that lacked inspiration and originality.
Sherlock sneered, wishing that Mycroft could see him, because if looks could kill, his brother would be mince meat.
He folded his arms, head tilted as he returned that searching gaze. “Not saying it’s a terrible idea, buuuut it just might be,” he smirked.
When the time came for Janine to leave, John’s pounding heartbeat filled the cold silence of the foyer. He was a bit sad to see her leave, knowing that they probably wouldn't see much of one another in the following months, seeing as she would be working when John would be off and vice versa.
Like Sherlock, Billy was an Omega, though less restrained and therefore, the surge of pheromones were affecting him. Sherlock made sure that the both of them maintained a plethora of suppressants on hand and ready aids for emergency situations, such as false Heats and unintentional Alpha ruts. There would be no Heats taking place in Sherlock's flat, not that he'd found anyone even slightly worthy of sharing one with.
He heard panting and turned to see Molly slumped against the arm of the couch, thighs squeezed firmly together as she came down from yet another orgasm.
John sat back and planted his feet with one hand behind him on the bed to steady his body as he swiveled his hips. As he moved, his cock slapped his belly with slick, wet noises, and Sherlock fought the urge to come as he grit his teeth and pushed up into John’s tight passage.
With one final peck, John pulled away, filing away the taste of Sherlock for lonely nights, the unique angles of his face and the utterly heart-rending color of his eyes.
John’s hand began moving on him in earnest, a quick, ruthless pump that had him rutting into that hand with abandon. John’s cock against his thigh was rosy at the tip, pearling with a bead of pre-ejaculate. The sight of it drew a ragged moan up Sherlock’s tightening throat.
"Sherlock, I- I did John's autopsy and locked him up myself... but then I came in, you know, to write up the report and when I pulled out the drawer, well-... I-"
How could he put into words the extent to which he missed John during his absence, the extent to which he would go just to have some reminder of the man he loved. No amount of sex workers or blond haired doppelgängers would have satisfied him. They were all just synthetic drugs substituting for the real thing.
John rolled his eyes and soldiered on. "What I'm trying to say," he emphasized, pushing a finger in Sherlock's chest with a glare, "is that this is sort of a first for me, you twat!"
Victor sneered, flashing a fatal row of sharpened teeth, but complied with John and removed his hand. "Watch your fucking back, dog," he hissed, and somewhere in the room, he heard a quiet gasp, though he paid it no mind.
The wolves would be curious at some point, and if John didn't come to them, they would surely seek him out. He would just have to grin and bear it.
"Sherlock Holmes," Holmes returned blandly, before taking his hand back and turning to John, a blatant dismissal in his body language. In his peripheral, John could see Sarah's shoulders slump in obvious relief. "I assume your first day is coming along well, John?"
"Not for sex," Sherlock corrected, pulling John toward the hallway that led to his bedroom. "Not tonight."
Sherlock dropped the scarf and slid the coat off his shoulders, letting it fall into a heap at his feet. The jacket followed, and Sherlock began on the buttons of his shirt.
Sherlock returned the sentiment and gave no further warning before John's feet were leaving the floor. Quicker than John could follow, Sherlock had the buckle strapped around his ankle, and was moving around to lift the other.
Everyone, including John, flinched in surprise, turning wide eyes onto their leader, who was still messaging his temples roughly. "Anderson, sit down and be quiet, you're lowering the IQ of everyone in the room. I'd rather throw myself in a pit of hunters than be subjected to your insistent rambling and inability to form complete sentences with 'grown up' words."
John turned and opened the door just outside of the bedroom, to his right, as Sherlock indicated, and switched on the light. "Ehm, thanks," he croaked, before rushing in and closing the door behind him. With his back against it, he could hear the violin start up again, this time, taking a soft turn, almost like a rhythmic lullaby.
Sherlock tipped one cigarette out of the pack, anticipation building in his gut for the first hit of nicotine.
Morning came all too soon and John awoke feeling just as groggy as if he hadn't slept a wink. The light that filtered through the window was pale and grey, lending the room a melancholy ambience. The spot next to John was cold and unruffled. He ignored the throb in his chest and sat up slowly, rubbing the rheum from his eyes with the palms of his hands. It was Tuesday, meaning he had a shift at the office, so John swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood on shaky legs. The room was cool, and despite his occupancy, felt unused and unwelcoming without Sherlock's presence.
The callouses on his fingers, which John had clearly developed a fair while ago, hinted at long term use of a firearm. While it was not unheard of for a civilian to carry a weapon (though highly unlikely) - Sherlock could easily get hold of one by less than legal means - John's hair was just beginning to grow from a standard military cut. So, a soldier. John didn't seem like a very aggressive man by nature, simply a dominant personality. Although his body language was a clear indication that he'd rather be elsewhere, John obviously felt a responsibility towards his sister. Though the twins were both Alphas, John was the superior of the two, he could easily have ordered Harry to stand down. No. This was an issue that John knew needed to be addressed, although he was unwilling to acknowledge so aloud.
“At least you had the decency to take it upstairs,” Sherlock grumbled blandly. “Besides the fact that you were shamelessly watching as I fellated John,” at this, Greg nearly choked on his own breath, “You nearly ruined the moment with your terrible mouth breathing and skulking about. If you wanted to watch, you could have simply asked. Granted, John would most certainly have his hang-ups on the matter, and I don't know how I'd feel about you watching him in such a state—”
"And you're afraid that you will hurt someone if you can't contain it." It was a statement, but John agreed nonetheless.
Sherlock growled softly to himself, his thumb climbing to the tip of his cock to fondle the slit where pre-come was just beginning to pearl. He smiled through open-mouthed pants and said, “My flat, 221B Baker Street. Tonight. I can think of a few things, namely how many times I can make you come trembling around me.” The last bit was spoken around a gasp, before Sherlock was leaning heavily against the screen, his hand wringing stripes of semen from his swollen cock.
The final latch on his restraint clicked away, and Sherlock surged forward, only to be stopped with a hand on his chest. He nearly growled, frustrated that he had a wonderful, naked man before him and nothing was happening.
! Who falls into bed with a man they barely know and is surprised when they discover that there are more unsavoury bits about them?
So, here's the new chapter! Only a few more until the end of this book and the start of the next. Variations of Blue will be switch POV, because I really do love writing in Sherlock's point of view, and also, I think it also allows for a better grasp of the concept when you see it from the POV of both characters. Um, I didn't really like this chapter much (every author is their own terrible critic), but I would be delighted to hear feedback on it! Thank you to all those who take time out of their day to do so regularly! It's always a pleasure to read the comments and a motivating factor.
Sherlock leaned his hands against the shower wall, allowing the water to soak his hair. Drops of water ran streams across his face before falling down into the drain.
The water was warm on his tender skin, gentle over rope marks around his wrists, the bruises on his inner thighs from Sherlock's over-zealous tongue and teeth. Looking at them made his stomach clench in anticipation.
All of it was very childish and beneath him, and Sherlock didn't bother coming forth. Lestrade was a good man, but not worth the trouble. Besides, it was a prime opportunity to finish what he'd started with John.
Lestrade's face was grave when he hung up and stared straight ahead, his soft brown eyes as empty as Sherlock was.
John thrust up into that tight heat feeling ravaged, gutted open, blown out and wished Sherlock would stop staring. He was inhuman, ethereal, otherworldly. John could smell Sherlock's sex, could see the pearls of semen on the brink of spilling over.
an old hospital building, abandoned around the late eighties. The room was a mess, stockpiled with outdated medical equipment and a water stained curtain that hung limply around an old cot. There was so much clutter, in fact, that it would be easy to create the element of surprise.
"Not necessary, Molly," said Sherlock, turning the pram around to head towards the lab. "I know where you keep your results.
John's hand came up to tangle in Sherlock's curls, his hips jutting up to meet the hand now moving to pull the tied drawstring on his pyjama pants.
Sarah snorted, drawing John's attention back to the woman, as she rolled her eyes in an exaggerated fashion, reminiscent of a similar look he'd received from Holmes the day before. "Didn't see that coming," she spoke sardonically, though with more humour than cynicism. "Well then, she slapped both hands on her thighs and stood, "all the more reason to do this, then."
Jasper abandoned the notion of stealth and shot down the hallway. There was a door at the end and a sign that displayed a set of stairs. The door was a heavy, metal nuisance but with a few hard yanks, Jasper was able to wrench it open and fly down the stairs. It should lead to an exit, Jasper thought. At the base of the stairs, Jasper breathed a sigh of relief. There was no one there and he could still hear where they were searching for him In the halls, kicking open doors and making too much noise for men who’d successfully invaded underground bunkers of known enemies of the government. This seemed tactless.
They pulled away and John gathered their clothes off the floor, tossing Sherlock's into his face where he'd resumed his Sloth sprawl at the end of the bed. "Get up, you lazy berk, let's get cleaned up."
Lestrade narrowed his eyes, and John thought about telling the man that he was only the messenger. "You tell that prat to get out here; we have business to attend to. There's been another one."
The younger male reached up and placed a slow sensuous kiss on the detective's lips before pulling away, hands still clutching tightly to his coat.
Didn't quite cover their level of correspondence, but the word could mean a vast array of definitions without inciting much curiosity. Sherlock wasn't hard pressed to add a label to what he shared with John. No one else need know what they did behind closed doors.
Fortunately, Mrs Hudson had plenty of experience from babysitting nieces and nephews, and was invaluable to Sherlock when it came to John's care.
"I don't want this, Sherlock, any of this," John stated quietly, definitely. "I'm not-," John nearly choked on the lie, but he had to say the words, even if each one carved bloody lines down his chest. "I'm not in love with you."
Lestrade turned to meet the other man who strode in with a replacement bowl and refilled cup. Rolling his eyes, John caught the words the man hissed under his breath. "Damn it, Sally!"
Half an hour later and John had showered, brushed his teeth again, and combed his hair a total of five times, as well as paced a hole in the floorboards.
“You should rest. I can stand watch this time,” John offered, realizing that Sherlock hadn't slept in days. John had to force a packet of crisps on him earlier in the day, worried that Sherlock would fall over. As far as John had seen, Sherlock seemed fully awake, but John identified a few signs of fatigue popping up here and there.
They hadn't had sex, but it had been close. John was willing, had wanted him, but Sherlock was content to lie between his legs and rut against him until they both came.
John's rush to leave the room didn't alleviate the feeling of Mike's eyes following him as he went. He knew his friend was thinking of Harry, his sister, as always whenever it seemed John was turning to the bottle for comfort. Mike had been there when things had become really bad with Harry's alcoholism, and he worried that John would fall into the same tendencies.
John nodded, though the skin around his eyes was tight and his posture stiff as he approached the bed. Turning, he sank down, and boldly met Sherlock's gaze with an arched brow.
"What does he have on you?" Naturally, Janine was sceptical and as always, brutally honest with Sherlock. It was why he hired her to begin with.
The rhythm of John's hips sped up, until they were both grunting with the force of John's thrusts, wet bodies sliding against the wood in increments. It was unrealistically sensual and Sherlock could feel that surge of blessed relief creeping up on him.
The gentleman beside him chuckled gamely, trying to smother his smirk in the glass of his champagne.
Sherlock began to fuck him faster, until John's back was aching with the strain of his arch, and his shoulders began to twinge from pulling on the rope. Sherlock was panting in his ear and John was smashing his face against those beautiful cheekbones, the taste of sweat on his tongue.
This time, on the sensitive flesh of his inner thigh, where the skin was surely glowing rouge. John gasped and squeezed his eyes shut briefly, before refocusing on the man pacing slowly around the bed.
Greg had often thought of this very scenario upon the first few months of living with Sherlock and John. He had never met friends who gravitated around one another the way those two did, and though he hadn't so much as touched another penis in years, Greg couldn't help but to be pulled in by their odd relationship.
John didn't need him to say, though, because he had spotted them in the area surrounding his territory shortly after the massacre, while fleeing. He recalled using them during his time in the military when they went out on missions, but now he felt his stomach turn at the sight of it.
John was confused, and dazed by Sherlock's proximity and passionate ranting. What was he to say to it all?
Sherlock grunted and turned back to the window, though John could see those pale eyes observing him through the reflection, intrigued. "How so?"
The human breathed shakily, on the verge of tears. Trembling, he stuttered, “I-I've come with- with a message for you.”
As he sank into the bed, John glanced at the phone next to him, remembering the text from Sarah he'd neglected to check.
His advance was slow, cautious, and Sherlock was riveted to his every step. Curiously, the moment seemed to play out in slow motion. While logically, Sherlock understood that space and time were absolute, the relativity of such principles were rendered moot in the face of everything that was happening in that tiny bit of room between himself and John.
Jealousy. It wasn't an emotion that Sherlock was accustomed to dealing with, nor was he fond of the crushing, consuming weight of it. Jealousy sat heavily upon his gut whenever he thought of John with anyone but himself; it was a bitter plague that pushed every other sensible thought into the back of his mind, for example, when he walked into John's apartment to find him
John’s groans were guttural now, edged with hysteria and a deep-felt longing that resonated with Sherlock in ways he didn’t have the imagination to conjure up, the words to describe.
A loud snore cut into his careful response, drawing Sherlock’s annoyed glare to the exaggeratedly slumped figure in the other chair. With a snort, Victor snapped his head up. He returned Sherlock’s petulant grimace with a grin of his own. “Oh, sorry, sorry. Bullshit sort of makes me sleepy.”
"You've not heard a word I've been saying, have you, Watson?" Sarah pointed out archly. John shook his head, smiling apologetically. "Alright then, spit it out."
Sherlock was on top of John, around him, inside of him. John smelled like mouthwash and the eighteen-year-old scotch that Mycroft often kept on hand, but underneath that, his scent was robust. Sherlock inhaled it deeply, wondering if he would ever smell it again.
When the water was done and his tea steeped, John took the cup back to the couch. Irene’s lukewarm Oolong sat untouched on the coffee table as the woman frowned down at her phone screen. The moment he returned, she clicked off her mobile and gave him her full attention. John stifled his sigh, realizing she wasn’t going to let it go, and took a sip of his tea.
John furrowed his brows, unable to remember Holmes writing anything, which must have meant that Holmes had already planned to give his number to John.
To Sherlock, it sounded like a proposition, the way John looked at him, and then he wasn’t so sure that was a good idea. “I don’t think I should.”
The brush of a fully clothed body against his naked skin was delicious, and left John hard and wanting. Sherlock reached up and tangled long, thin fingers into his hair, kissing John with a turbulent force that reminded the younger male of the blossoming, aching bruise on his cheek. He gave back just as much as he got, forcing Sherlock to snog him harder with an insistent hand buried in a nest of silken curls.
“Good morning, John,” said Sherlock, his gaze intense as he took in the reddish hue of John's eyes, the bags beneath them and John wouldn't be surprised if Sherlock deduced how many cups of tea he’d had that morning.
John tore his eyes reluctantly from Sherlock's darkened gaze to the mirror. He gasped at the indecent display he made. The chain hung in a parabola between his clamped nipples, gleaming brightly against his pale chest. John's nipples were red and swollen between the clamps, pearly with Sherlock's saliva.
Lady Grey caught the cane from offstage and two dancers came to stand to her left and two to her right. In synchronicity, they swaggered forward, Lady Grey leaning on her cane, while the other held the tip of her top hat down over her eye. “Cause we are living in a material world, and I am a material girl.”
Lestrade had left the door firmly open, casting John a meaningful look as he exited. Directly across the hall, a door was slightly ajar, opening to what John assumed were Sherlock's quarters. The man certainly hadn't been exaggerating when he'd stated that he wanted to keep an eye on John. Sherlock would have the perfect view into his room, and likewise for John.
Holmes chose a table for them in a corner by the window, before going up to the cashier to place an order. John surveyed the café, noticing that there were only two other patrons at the late hour, one of which looked to be sobering up over a hot cuppa.
John's assailant lowered his hand, slowly, and turned to the curly-haired stranger with a cynical smile. "Well, well... Sherlock Holmes, innit? Nice of you to show your pretty face round here. Last I saw, you were turning tricks in the alley for a bit of snuff."
Jasper blinked rapidly, running a hand through his hair he took several deep breaths. John stood up, stretching his hands above his head, a yawn pushing at his lips. He was still a bit sleepy, but he reckoned it was too late to try and get a few more hours rest.
. At least he had time to make himself look presentable, not that he was trying to make an impression on Holmes or anything of that nature.
John shook his head, allowing it to fall back on a feather down pillow, as it eased the stress on his arms when he relaxed fully. "You are mad if you think I don't. Now shut up and fuck me,
His eyes felt glued open, straining and dyed a faint red, John was sure, from sleep deprivation. He wouldn't be able to sleep now, not after the unexpected meeting with Jim Moriarty. John never felt more awake.
Sherlock grunted against him as he fucked John with nothing but his lips and tongue, pressing deep enough to make John's voice deepen an octave. He pulled away, only to nip John's arse playfully before dipping his tongue into John's slick opening.
The thought that he could be just another conquest for Sherlock was what ate at John. Although he loved being the focus of Sherlock's attention, felt ingratiated by it, John couldn't help but wonder why. Though they had only had penetrative sex once, just the memory of it left him with chills, and he wondered if it was the same for Sherlock. John couldn't stop thinking of what it felt like to have someone inside of him.
Sherlock stepped forward, as if to shield John from the odd fellow, but this only made the man smirk harder. “Always the insufferable busybody, eager to stick your nose into my business. You would think I've already given you enough incentive to quit prying into my life, what with a stake in my company to keep an eye on and your own section of the government to lord about. Seems you're still the lonely, beak-nose prat you've always been,” Sherlock spat scathingly.
He breathed deeply, knowing that Sherlock was looking for a reason to provoke John. The room was filled with murmurs and the scent of anxiety and anger. Anderson was still condemning him, while Greg stood defensively in front of John, his deep growl underlining his words as he tried to put the other man back in line. Sally was speaking harshly with Sherlock, gesturing angrily in John's direction while Victor stared unerringly at John, a queer smirk settled contently on his lips.
"All right," Sherlock agreed, and like a switch, something in his eyes changed, became darker. "Undress."
Victor shrugged. “Well, take a bit of time off. Get yourself sorted—and by yourself, I do mean you and John—then you can get back to being Sherlock Holmes, the great narcissistic arsehole CEO of Holmes Pharmaceuticals and pseudo-detective.”
Sherlock stood, perplexed as he tossed the riding crop on the bed and went to answer the door. His skin prickled with excitement at the knowledge that it could quite possibly be Moriarty. Now that he’d resurfaced, it was hard to predict what he would do.
John's jaw was clenching rhythmically - unhappy but agrees that they shouldn't delay any longer - but he nodded, conceding to Sherlock's logical explanation. John knew Sherlock was right. He was
"I decided it would be best that this conversation took place in person." Oh, of course, mister control freak wanted to make sure John's answer would be in his favour. "A moment, please."
The atmosphere at the table had been uncomfortable after Holmes sauntered off to join his companion. John hadn't sought him out again, but for the duration of John's lunch, he could feel eyes boring into the back of his skull. It was awkward and disconcerting, but he couldn't deny the thrill he felt at the knowledge that Holmes was possibly jealous of Sarah. Although John was loath to drag his best friend into his complicated dance with his new employer, he enjoyed seeing Holmes' carefully crafted composure fall away.
Lady Grey placed her hands against his chest, not pushing or pulling, simply resting them there. “I should hope so. If not, that would mean I’m out of a job.”
As they entered into the room from before, John could feel the ripple of tension as well as a few notable glares from some of the other wolves. Victor, in particular, sat sulking on the couch, legs and arms crossed as he evaluated John closely with disdainful scrutiny. If looks could kill, well, John would be puddle of viscera on the floor.
Sherlock crouched, bringing himself eye-to-eye with John, and flashed a smiled. “Well, then. Let's begin.”
. "Shit, I have to get going." He jumped up, making sure he had his mobile and wallet. He leant down and brushed a quick peck over Sarah's awaiting cheek before he bolted out the door.
Mycroft was, per the usual, a busybody with nothing better to do than stalk his younger brother, but Sherlock also suspected that John was the reason for Mycroft’s impromptu reveal.
Miss Vicky had thrown him in a white shirt and tight trousers, rolled up his sleeves, and slapped on some suspenders. She hadn’t stopped there. John looked ridiculous. She’d put blush on his cheeks and mascara on his lashes, and for the love of God, he even had guyliner. Ugh.
The only other furnishing in the room was an antiquated chest of drawers pushed into a dark corner of the room. The temperature was a bit low for John's liking, but as far as lodgings, this was far better than he had anticipated receiving.
“Alright ladies, places- get into your places! John, where have you been, I’ve been looking everywhere-”
“I’m warning you, Sherlock, not to do anything drastic. If not for the sake of your company, then for the sake of your doctor.” Mycroft spoke without a trace of scorn or mockery, solemn in his caution. For once, Sherlock agreed. “When and if he makes a move that directly affects you, then you will contact me immediately. Until then, my people will be keeping a weather eye on Moriarty.”
Beside her, the acrobats flew and the dancers on the stage spun with their partners enthusiastically.
Sherlock's eyes flicked down to Jasper's shirt, though that wasn't really where his mind was. He waited. “He intrigued me,” Sherlock confessed, meeting Jasper’s eyes again. “You think I didn't wonder that myself? I have no desire to deal in emotions or delve into relationships.
The bedsit was cold and dank when John returned for the first time in weeks. The lights were off and the curtains drawn shut over the spider web cracks in the windows. The telly was off and the house as quiet as a tomb, or at least that was what it felt like.
Sherlock hated how every waking thought was filled with John, every sense memory and every breath. He could already smell John’s scent permeating his clothes. John’s skin cells were beneath his fingernails, strands of his hair tangled in Sherlock’s own, the taste of his lips on Sherlock’s tongue. It was more than enough to drive him mad. Instead, Sherlock neither ruffled his hair to remove John’s nor washed his hands or sprayed cologne because he wanted it. He did, and he hated himself, because it was everything Mycroft ever taught him was wrong with humanity.
It was at the end of one of Sherlock's anecdotes about a case he'd taken for the Yard that John noticed they'd been moving closer and closer to one another, like iron to magnets. John had noticed Sherlock would drift sometimes, the way his pale eyes would flicker upward to 221C and then to John, searching, burning. Sherlock was barely restraining himself, and the sexual energy radiating off of him in pulses said as much.
Yeah, so I never did quite get to the angst, so that will be next chapter. I didn't realize how much I actually wrote. See, I told you this story has a mind of its own. Feedback will be much appreciated. Thoughts, con-crit, it's all fine! Come join me on
Sherlock added another finger, gently, so as not to overwhelm John, though it was a pointless endeavour. He had already become undone.
Holmes was watching him, analyzing him while he continued to talk. "All of my employees are well-compensated and treated fairly. If you do good work, I will reward you accordingly, monetarily or... otherwise." There! What was that hesitation? Just what was Holmes hinting at?
John's body was singing for the change and the adrenaline felt like fire coursing through his veins, invigorating him and numbing the discomfort. He doubled over, unable to stand upright any longer as he succumbed to the wolf.
“Well you’re the one that insisted on lying down,” Sherlock grumbled, not slowing down his light, steady pace, pressing their foreheads together.
They twisted and turned through alleyways until Sherlock chased him down a dead-end street.  Panicking, the suspect spun round and lunged at Sherlock, aiming for his throat.  Sherlock reared back but before the culprit could make contact, he was thrown backwards.
“Okay, so, ex-army Captain and doctor, used to play rugby at some point, probably would have pursued it further but the military got in the way.  Shot in the left shoulder, you had a psychosomatic limp at one point, but the exercise fends it off.  Oh, and you have a brother you’re not close to.”
“I’m sure you will very soon,” Sherlock said distractedly.  Something outside kept on catching his attention and John was fairly certain their lunch/ mini-interview was over.  He didn’t quite know what he had learnt from it but somehow he had made up his mind.  He stood up.
He mused for a second.  “A Healer first, a soldier a close second.  And with any luck we might make a detective of you yet.”  And, as was his want, he flounced round John and through the shield, leaving John to trail after him.  He was trying not to grin too widely as he stepped through the shield.
At first John thought this was just another dig at the Senior Guards effectiveness but there was another answer.  “He’s only going to talk to you.”
Sherlock was not too proud to admit his knees buckled slightly at the sight but he recovered before anyone noticed.
), John felt he was something of an expert at compartmentalising his problems.  These symptoms, as John took to thinking of them, were nothing he hadn’t seen before.  After he had been discharged from his Defender team, he had spent most of his time in a state of constant hyper vigilance, even in sleep, no sound too small, no movement too insignificant.  It was exhausting and it wasn’t until he’d been forced by Molly to join the Healer community that he finally found some peace.  That was, until Sherlock came along with his own brand of observation and Mori-
Things had changed after the hug.  Not hugely, not loudly, but the subtle brushing of shoulders and bumping of elbows had increased dramatically and it. Was. Driving. John.
John, oblivious to the panic sirens upstairs, was downstairs in the kitchen, humming to himself while making some breakfast. Not wanting to disturb Sherlock, he’d dressed in a pair of pants and an old t-shirt he’d found in the pile of washing waiting to go back upstairs.  He needn't have bothered as 10 minutes later a ruffled looking Sherlock appeared in the doorway, red dressing gown slung on over his pyjamas and looking, in John’s opinion, as if he was going to be sick.
He still had to sign some paperwork however so he strode over to the desk.  When in doubt, be overly confident and hope it intimidates people into not yelling at you.
“Fine,” he said, grabbing the pen and scribbling down a few names.  “Now I’ve got to get back to work.”  With that he strode off towards to the kitchens and disappeared.
They didn’t realise their problem as went to go and get ready.  This took an half an hour longer than expected when Sherlock broke into John’s room for a surprise snogging session, and they only realised the time when John’s phone wouldn’t stop ringing.  (This turned out to be Mycroft who, although he would prefer not to know, knew this would happen).
“I was in the shower this morning and I thought of you,” he said, his mouth unwilling to explain further.  John was a smart man however.
but some of his favourite moments were not, as everyone always suspected, filled with imminent danger, but the quiet ones, the ones with John absentmindedly running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair while they watched telly or when he would spy John, accidentally asleep in his chair and Sherlock would look at him and feel his heart squeeze (
“Sherlock are you sure you know what you’re doing?” he said as he shot a pleasant smile towards the woman getting out of the lift who shot them a startled look.  He had a bad feeling the only thing preventing them being stopped was Sherlock’s imperious demeanour and that wasn’t exactly full proof.
"You are being ridiculous.  If you like the man, text him.  If I have read the signs wrong, which is highly unlikely mind you, then you don't have to see him again.  But anything has to be better than you sulking up here alone."
“I’m not asking you to.  In fact, the decision has already been made.”  John looked like he was going to argue again when Sherlock played his closing card.  “You said you made a decision to follow me.  Now I’m making the same choice back.”  He paused, looking away, before guiltily adding, “Also, and not that this makes a huge difference to my choice, bu it appears my wings are also gone.  A side-effect of being a former Fallen according to Mycroft.  So odds are I cannot return either.”
“John.  There is nothing between me and Victor.  I can see how you might think that but I swear I don’t think I can or will ever feel for anyone the way I feel about you.  I love you, plain and simple as it is to say.  And yes I did just say that,” he added, noticing John’s shocked expression.  “All I talk about sometimes is you.  My friends set up a drinking game around it.  They even had to complicate the rules because simply taking a shot every time I mentioned you would have given them all alcohol poisoning.  I’m mad about you.  I’m sorry I haven’t shown it recently but I was worried about you.”
He hadn't always had powers; he was made, not born.  It had happened in Afghanistan.  The official story was that a mission gone wrong had led to a bullet wound and infection in his left shoulder which he was lucky to have escaped from alive.
“Then we have no further business.”  John was startled by the voice, not for the crackling deep undertone that characterized Fallen’s speech, but by the sheer evidence of the voice itself.
“All that trouble John, really?  Also, if they’d switched the plates, how do you explain this, which you clearly think is mine?”  Sherlock shook the feather disdainfully, as if his wings would ever disobey him by moulting like a common Labrador.  He placed it into a clear plastic bag which had been produced from the never-ending pockets.
waiting for the Fallen, John took the car back and meandered his way home, and if he took the longer route, giving ample time for any certain person to arrive back in his flat, then that was just good luck.
This however, was a progression on his old way of life.  Something new though, was the acquisition of a
When he'd imagined this moment, briefly, always briefly, he'd thought of the two of them lounging in their chairs beside the fire. The room was only lit by the mellow colour from the flames and the small lamp on the side table. It was quiet and peaceful, each person content. Their feet were dangerously close to touching, always pushing the boundaries of personal space. John would smile at him and get up from his chair. He leaned over and there would pause for a brief second before their lips touched.
“And on that insult I have to go.  Take care John and don’t forget to call us more.  We want to hear all about your fancy London life.”
Sherlock had to concede the point.  “I’m sure you can still get into a host of trouble without the ability to magically pick-locks.  I’ve always admired how resourceful you can be.”
John felt like his heart had stopped dead, somewhere in his throat if his difficulty breathing was a judge.
“John?  It’s been a while.  Thought you’d forgotten about us,” Greg said but without venom.  His usually weary voice (caused mainly by the fact he was surrounded by problems both at work and at home) had undergone a change recently, no doubt thanks to a certain Miss Hooper, and now sounded lighter, as if he’d realised everything wasn’t quite so bad after all.
) or someone would report a sighting.  John tended to ignore them after quickly checking there was nothing tracing back to him but did find it amusing he apparently had at least 16 love-children from 13 different women.
Sherlock smiled slightly and gambled taking John’s hand.  Gratifyingly, John didn’t pull away, but continued to look at Sherlock forlornly, as if he was going to disappear any moment.  “I don’t want to go back without you,” he said.
“What?  It explains how you’re all chipper after both stropping off like operatic divas last night.”
Mycroft nodded.  “Luckily I am well versed in Sherlock and can translate easily.  As for not contacting you with news of John’s arrival, contact with the Above world became rather difficult.”
“-But you think it’s something similar.  Something you can do at a party or other inane gathering, something you can be given?”
“I need you to make sure it’s real.”  A piece of ex-soul was extracted with a pair of tweezers and gently put onto a slide.  It was strange seeing Sherlock being so delicate, much of his life seeming to happen in bangs and crashes and explosions.
Sherlock cut in.  “We need to save John and possibly the world as we know it.”  Lestrade’s dramatic outburst was apparently catching.
They had good intentions.  They really did.  But sometimes good intentions led to bad decisions.  Like trying to keep their relationship a tightly controlled secret instead of simply doing whatever the hell they wanted and letting everyone else deal with it.
John realised he should be more concerned with the fact that Sherlock could deduce him without even being in the same room but he was too busy being grateful that the decision being taken out of his hands.  He changed quickly, checked his freshly washed hair and overall appearance in the mirror.
Sherlock didn’t reply straight away and so John turned back and said “Sherlock?” in the direction of the Fallen’s right ear.
Sherlock blinked.  He had assumed Lestrade was calm and he still appeared relaxed, but perhaps some moral support would not be unwelcome.  However, moral support was never really his area.
“A small advantage of warfare is you become accustomed to sleeping when you can rather than when’s comfortable,” Sherlock said softly, looking at what he could of John’s dozing face.
John.  His perfect, intriguing John, who thought he was brilliant and didn’t think he observation skills were weird or annoying or any of the countless adjectives used to describe it.  His brave John who had decided that, after everything that happened last year, he would become a human doctor, using his old skills from his Healing days with his new found interest in human biology.  Best of all, was the fact that after a year of being either under the same roof as both Sherlock’s relatives, or agonising miles apart due to Sherlock needing to go back to school (
“But why kill them?  And why hang about, not run somewhere else?”  John would have thought the first step would be to leg it as far away from the scene as possible and in the afterlife, they could have gone very far indeed.
And so, a week later, they found themselves pulling up outside the castle-turned-hotel venue. They’d arrived at noon, as the afternoon event didn’t really begin until 2pm. They had not yet realised their problem.
Sherlock was less slow in waking up, his mind powering up in only a few moments. However he didn’t make any attempt to move, partially because he was very comfortable but mainly because he was struck by the odd sensation that this was not his bedroom. He twisted slightly to get a better view and was much relieved to notice he was still within 221B. Then he was struck with the new sensation of being panicked because he was still within 221B. Which meant this was John’s room. The same John who he’d been watching for the past few months.  Oh God, he’d done something, hadn’t he?
The first workout, with the endlessly perky Victoria, was brutally paced but mainly billed as cardio mixed with weights.  This, in contrast, was ultimately slower, based on focussing tightly on muscle groups which ironically made it high-intensity.  The aim was for people to use their own body weight rather than rely on weights so naturally there was a lot of push-ups, sit-ups, and planks.  Glancing around Sherlock was fairly sure he should not be shaking as if a magnitude 6 earthquake had hit his mat but despite his quivering he was not going to give in.  Not while John was watching anyway.  God his muscles hurt.
“This belongs to someone?” The Fallen looked at the arm with some surprise.  John merely raised an eyebrow, so the Fallen continued.  “Well obviously it
Sherlock tilted his head to the side again in question.  He was going to have to control the urge to run his fingers through those curls.
, “a brilliant brain.  Actually the blank background is a good idea, so bring your face over here where the light’s better.”  John nodded over to where the door to the tiny kitchen was propped open and the natural light shone through.
John released his hand from Sherlock’s grasp only to wrap them around his neck as he considered.  “I think we can give it a good go.”
“What the fuck are you doing?” he asked bewildered, as his arms were jolted about.  He started to panic Sherlock was having some sort of fit when he replied.
).  One thing he hadn’t factored in was latecomers.  It was 10 minutes into the lecture when Sherlock noticed a slight breeze tickling his ear.  Curious, he risked a peripheral glance and saw that the door behind him was being gently pushed open.  The lecturer, thankfully, seemed blissfully unaware and kept wittering on but Sherlock turned himself slightly so that he had a good view of the door, without drawing too much attention to it.  The door hovered between open and closed for a few seconds.  A head popped round.  Sherlock took a quick assessment.
“That must mean Greg took it instead.  Good, hopefully he’ll buy a suit jacket that fits.  And he’s right by the way, it’s a much quicker route.”
John nodded.  Plenty of time.  “I’m going to buy a new toaster,” he announced to the kitchen and wandered back upstairs.
Sherlock looked at him with a special ‘John don't be slow’ look.  He liked wearing it and used it often but this one held a very thin balance between ‘I believe you can do better’ and ‘how did I end up with this idiot?’
“That you wished to forget yesterday night and return to our previous arrangement.”  John felt simultaneously weak-kneed from relief and like hitting his head against a wall.
He twisted back on top, knees bracketing Sherlock’s hips, rested on his elbows so his face was centimetres away from Sherlock’s and whispered onto his lips “Tell me more.”
“Look, whatever he’s said or done, we’re real sorry but he’s not going to apologise so you’re wasting your time,” Irene drawled out the familiar speech.  They’d considered just getting a sign with it on to hang on the front door but Molly had insisted that people should at least get an apology from a real person.  It was surprising then that the boy simply laughed.
As they secretly hauled the guilty into holding, with the help of Mallory, he was itching to move on to the next target.  All he needed was access to was the right data.  He was scouting in Lestrade’s office when he was brought even more bad news.
John almost smiled again.  “That’s not it, and I don’t know whether it is sweet you would defend me from a murder charge or worrying you had that ready to go.”  He paused, mouth twisting back into a frown.  He addressed his hands rather than looking at Sherlock.  “The actual problem is the lack of wings and the fact I don’t have my powers anymore.  Something about the jump, it means I’m not an angel anymore.  And if you’re not an angel, you can’t go back through the portal.”
The next was how much one woman could cry about a man she had spoken to about three times.  It turned out a lot.
An unspoken rule established at the start of the sketch lunches was that John did not hide his drawings, even the roughest of little doodles on the edges of the pages, small flowers and dogs and houses littering the pockets of space on the page.  Often he’d hand over the entire book for Sherlock to flick through, usually having to defend his robot army doodles.
“So glad you didn’t hold back on that.”  Molly then hesitated and Sherlock’s heart plummeted.  “And I would love to.  But-”
There were many techniques employed.  Some used the newbies or the tech department who were unfamiliar with Sherlock’s ....
Happy New Year's everyone- I hope you enjoy this chapter and I promise we will get to the end of this thing soon!
“Oh don’t be like that.  I know history isn’t your strong suit.  And really isn’t history what this is all about?”  He flicked his eyes back to Sherlock.  He paced just behind John, brushing up against him occasionally.  “Did you know he was genuinely a Fallen once?” he stopped, turning to John.  “Made quite the name for himself before he ran away and joined this circus.  Never could settle.”
“You okay there gorgeous?”  Sherlock shivered at John’s hoarse voice.  He’d done that.  They’d done that.  Together.
A few things happened in quick succession.  Jack lunged at Sherlock, grabbing a pen-knife from his pocket before he sprang.  Both John and Sherlock noticed this.  Sherlock froze for a second before jumping away and bracing for the sting of the cut.  However, this didn’t happen.  Instead, Jack was sent sprawling as the full force of ex-army Captain, current fitness instructor, and the possible love of Sherlock’s life, John Watson slamming into him and restraining him on the floor, knife clattering uselessly to the ground.
“Couldn’t hack it anymore.  Said you were driving her crazy with all that banging and crashing about,” Lestrade shook his head, imaging only too well what havoc had occurred.  He was suddenly quite thankful that he had the option to only deal with Sherlock in case-mode.
John scowled, unhappy with the image of Sherlock facing their captors alone, especially with the equivalent a raging hangover.  He was a good fighter with his wits about him, but they’d outnumber him and overpower him easily.
“We have to start again?”  He didn’t intend to sound so crestfallen.  At this proximity it was impossible to not notice Sherlock’s eyes soften.  They really were quite lovely.  Even if he was looking at a complete moron who had managed to fuck up the biggest investigation he had ever been allowed on.
“Because I’ve just spent ten minutes talking about how much I love you, that’s why,” John said, frustration bleeding through.  “What I meant is that I shouldn’t have kissed you without explaining properly.  About the wings situation.  It’s just-”  He struggled for a moment and looked out, towards the lush garden.  “When you said I love you, I just wanted to pretend for a bit.”
John wondered if Sherlock would ever give him a straight, non-cryptic answer to a question.  It also suggested this would be a problem for Future-John and he’d like to know in advance what it was he would be berated for not noticing.  “Despite the fact that one of the first things you said to me was that I was in danger.”
"Oh, yes. Hi, " John said and there was no way he could cover up how startled he sounded. "Sherlock, these are some of my rugby friends. Bill, Johnson, Mike, this is Sherlock."
“For me, it feels like I’ve been here about two months? Ish?” John seemed surprisingly fine with this information. “So I’ve had a lot of time to think, about a lot of stuff.  To think about what I was missing.  So I thought about us.  How, before I met you, I was just bored with
“Sherlock, who decided to be there?  Who chose to follow you into that danger?  I did.  I chose that because it was a million times more interesting to me to spend time with you than it was to be safe and normal and quiet.  I get to decide what I do and where I go and I chose you.  Every time.”
“Yes, fine.  I’m going to need to do some research, I’ll contact you if I find anything.  Look after your friend.  He’s going to need it when reality hits him.”  Sherlock stood up slightly too quickly to be entirely natural and left.  He could feel Victor and Oli’s stares but he chose to ignore them.  Victor would blame it on the case.  Oli didn’t know him well enough to disagree.
After what felt like hours he was on their corridor.  There was Sherlock’s door.  He kept on telling himself that everything was under control.  He could do this.
John glanced over at him.  If he turned his head fully, he could rest his forehead on Sherlock’s.  It was a tempting idea.  Instead he simply smiled, and said, “I’m fine.  Really.  I’ll let you know if it gets bad.”
It was then John played his ace card.  He leaned in so he was whispering in Sherlock’s ear.  “And maybe if you’re really,
.  “Yes,” he replied to both questions.  “Would Jasmine mind if I brought John?” he added hurriedly, before he could over-think it.  If he began doing that he wouldn’t ask and he’d be back to square 1 again.
After hearing there might be a chance of John being alive, Lestrade had jumped up and pushed past Mallory to the scene, falling back into leadership mode.  Mallory scuttled off to assist, yelling at an idiot putting weight on a flimsy looking balustrade.  Sherlock had to admit he was not entirely insufferable, as far as Guards went.
John had a sinking feeling he already knew what it was but he had to ask to be sure.  “Sherlock.  What is that?”
“I’m not staring,” John answered automatically, despite the fact he emphatically was staring.  There were very few times in the day that he wasn’t staring at Sherlock, though he justified this by telling himself it was to avert disasters before they happened.  Sherlock tilted his head to stare at John staring.  John, caught, stuck his tongue out, eliciting a small smile from Sherlock.  In retaliation, Sherlock winked at him.  They grinned at each other, until the sound of the door on the other side of the glass swung open and shut.  Yep, he was definitely adorable.
Then John came over and touched his arm.  Sherlock shivered involuntarily which made John frown.  “Are you sure you’re alright?  You seem a bit spacey which might be shock,” his voice soft and concerned.
Sherlock watched him leave, then returned to his chair, turning the paper over and over again between his fingers.
On the way over John’s fears only grew.  Sherlock was quiet while they walked (John refused to get taxi’s unless absolutely necessary- they weren’t made of money).  John hoped he’d become more sociable once he was surrounded by his friends, otherwise this was going to get very awkward, very quickly.  Unless, of course, his new friends knew of his habit to recede into his own mind.  It wasn’t like he, John, would know if they knew.  He mentally shook himself.  Gods, he had to get a grip, these people were probably lovely.  Probably.
?”  Lestrade’s ban on the case also involved materials pertaining the case, including all their work identifying symbols near the underground.  John could have cried for the hours he’d spent on it.
One such thing was to not push the physical side of their relationship too far, too fast. Even though Sherlock was not as innocent as everyone believed him to be, it had still been a while since he had anything resembling a relationship and so John had quietly insisted they wait a while.  It wasn’t like they were on a deadline.  Sherlock was not exactly pleased as his main thoughts were about how to get John into bed in the quickest time possible (he had 8 working theories so far) but he was also slightly pleased he had some leeway.
the figure was shadowy.  The guy had solid black wings.  John almost hadn’t noticed them as they blended into the grime of the street and walls but they were there, rippling across the alley.  This only meant one thing and it came with a
They wandered around corridors, and around the edges of open abandoned factory floors until finally,
It wasn’t that he was ungrateful for the chance to experience things as humans did, as this would surely be useful with cases, and he had a number of experiments that he was eager to try.  However, the problem was that he never seemed to have time for experiments because of the demands of his humanity.  Breathing, eating, sleeping, walking.  There was a constant list of jobs and expectations and requirements.  It wasn’t that these were difficult tasks individually, but collectively they were
“Thank you,” he said automatically (and since when was the automatic?) before his brain registered the start of the sentence.  “Wait, fine with what?”
John laughed softly as Sherlock huffed angrily and twisted a little to see three heads disappear back round the kitchen door.
Sherlock stared at him again, using what was left of his scrambled deductive powers to check if John was lying. Either he’d become an excellent actor or John was being serious.
Also I swear this was not supposed to be this long- I couldn't seem to make the boys stop chatting. Next time: a date!  An actual date!  Cue boys hyperventilating, the longest Saturday known to man, Angelo's, and after Angelo's...
Mrs Hudson must have used his absence to clear the bomb site that was their living room.  This was evident in the fact that the floor was actually visible, there were no longer a variety of mugs all containing cold tea, and the spectre on the sofa had a blanket thrown over him to stop his feet from getting cold.  He hadn’t moved since the last time John saw him.  Well, hadn’t until a packet of biscuits dropped on his head.
Then John looked at him and he honest-to-god felt his breath leave his body.  Dark blue ocean eyes had him pinned in place, rooted to the spot next to his mat.  If he had been paying attention to anything around him he would have heard Molly stifle a giggle but he could not think of a single other thing than the eyes he was currently trying not to drown in.
“Stairs!” Sherlock shouted a few minutes later, pointing to a small set of steps, which John would have walked straight past. Maybe not entirely without direction then.
It was as he rounded the corner that he realised he was going to be stuck in a car, possibly for several hours with both of them.
“Who’s this?” Lestrade asked, bobbing his head towards the blonde, at the exact same time as Sally spluttered “You’re an Omega?”
“Excellent.  My room’s closest,” he said, scooping up their stuff with one hand and grabbing John’s hand with the other.  John simply laughed and allowed himself to be led to what was promising to be a
Sherlock’s coat.  Which meant that it was probably Sherlock he was sleeping on.  Which meant that it was probably Sherlock who was stroking his back as he slept.
John tilted his head.  “Well I left it on the side to charge and now it’s not there so either you’ve hidden it or we’ve got a very inventive burglar on our hands.”
John heaved a melodramatic sigh which he felt even Sherlock would have been impressed by.  “Fine.  I promise not to forget your birthday present.”
because he did not have the energy to deal with that right now and all this was to say: John did not hear the banging on his door.
John blinked at him.  Sherlock was practically vibrating with barely concealed excitement, hands fidgeting and feet twitching as if he wanted to race about the room like a ten-year-old. However, there was just a small, tiny, minuscule detail John needed to clarify first.
“Because you left me no other choice!  All the time, every day, all I hear is about how you and Victor had a wonderful time that day and what great adventures you’re going on tomorrow, and oh look you’ve got another party to go too together and who do you take along to your first ever crime scene?  How can
After ringing Molly and blurting out “JohnaskedmeoutwhatdoIdohelp”, and then repeating it so it was actually intelligible, Molly made a noise that can only truly be described as the sound equivalent of “!!!!!!!!”.  After her squeaking stopped they were quiet for a minute, both trying to wrap their heads around this earth-shattering news.  The conversation that followed did not start off as one of their most eloquent.
“This could be the first time!”  Sherlock scoffed and returned to glaring at the screen.  “You don’t think they'll look like Faber anymore, do you.”
contact with, but also deigned to work with the Guards and won himself a flatmate who has a military background and a clear penchant for danger. Along the way he insulted many people in leadership positions, managed to be kidnapped, illegally broke and entered into someone’s home, and destroy a tube station causing a level of damage which is frankly astounding even by your standards.  I was wondering if you had anything to add.”
John wanted to protest that no, Sherlock shush, but he simply sighed, kept quiet, and tried to concentrate on their quarry.  Sherlock slowed as they arrived at the turning.  John knew the instinct well.  If the target had clocked their appearance, then he could well be stood behind the corner waiting to jump them, but luckily, he had yet to notice.  John suddenly wished for the secrecy of Sherlock’s black wings which blurred into the darkness.  The white of his own reflected against the murky streetlights and were practically a neon sign saying “HEY.  YOU’RE BEING FOLLOWED.”  He tucked them closer to his body and hunched in his jacket.
As he drifted off, John’s hands stroking his back, he felt that there might be some advantages to accidental humanity.  After all, every demonic cloud has to have a beautiful, charming, blonde-haired silver lining.
“Jake you’re not seriously going to keep up with this?”  Oli was looking at his friend as if he’d never seen him before.  Victor was remaining strangely silent but looked vaguely sick.  Jake remained silent, playing with the napkins on the table, shredding them up.
at you.”  He saw it right?  He had to see it.  John looked at Sherlock’s confused expression, the cutest little head tilt and furrow of his brows.
“Yes, you and Victor, and don’t you bloody lie to me Sherlock Holmes, otherwise I swear I will,” John couldn’t finish his sentence before frustration got the better of him.
jealous of the dog.  The sign off was what tipped him over the edge.  Not from the company or a generic greeting but something that showed he genuinely cared.  Sherlock for once agreed with Mrs Hudson.  He had to meet his dog walker.
“I can hear you,” Sherlock tried to snap but it came out as a whisper.  He sluggishly pushed Lestrade’s hands off his face.  The Guard’s eyes snapped to his face.
Sherlock knew in his own mind that he’d been attracted to John, wanted to touch and taste and feel everything. But John hadn’t given any clear sign of reciprocation and so he’d dropped it and hoped it would go away. Of course it hadn’t but that was beside the point. To be confronted with a reality where John did want something
He started sat in his chair.  Casual worked, right?  But maybe too casual.  Sofa?  He’d noticed John’s eyes roving over him while he’d been lounging, sleep shirt riding up to expose his stomach.  However, when he tried to lie down, somehow he couldn’t find a comfy position, the pillows weirdly lumpy, his t-shirt twisting strangely, and nope, this wouldn’t do.  He stalked to the kitchen to bash some equipment around in annoyance.  This was ridiculous.
He sucked in a breath, counted to 4 and then let it back out again.  When he opened his eyes again, they immediately locked with Sherlock’s, who was staring at him from his chair, clearly concerned.  Sherlock appeared to be frozen, half hanging out of his chair, as if to come over and comfort, but he hadn’t made the journey across the room, as if he was afraid he would be unwelcome, as if John would push him away.
Sherlock was good at crafts.  He would deny this until the universe imploded but the decorations around the house for the Halloween party and everyone’s birthdays begged to differ.  When confronted he said they were store bought
At Baker Street, with no further word from Moriarty, and given Mycroft’s assurances that both he and Moran were, in effect, not in the country, John and Sherlock were able to continue their lives, navigating the waters of their business, the cases, John’s journal, and his shifts at Barts. There were nights running after criminals, or huddled in watch outs, there were hours in NSY, and at the morgue at St. Bartholomew. Molly Hooper had relaxed quite a bit with John and was still shy, but attempted to be friendly. There were nights at 221B when a tall, slim man paced around, quietly, or as he complained or occasionally threw things around. There were experiments, and violin music. And there were cuddles, and love, and a whole lot of sex.
Stranger eating at the table with his Sherlock and making him laugh? Not on!! He approached quietly and overheard the conversation:
So Sherlock stayed, at John’s invitation. He changed the channel on the telly, when John told him to. He had some tea and said “That did soothe my stomach.” and they talked. About Greg and the party. They laughed at the stripper. John commented on Sherlock’s dancing abilities. They talked about Donovan, and Sherlock working with her. About Lewis, her niece, John hadn’t known about her. It had hurt to see he had not known this girl, that had made Sherlock reach out to find a better situation for her. It explained the thawing he saw in Donovan. Sherlock had busied himself with helping her right after John had moved out. John talked about the Science workshop and the progress with Rosie.
“It is my understanding that the two of you are bringing Rosie up…,” said Dr. Q carefully, “...therefore, it will be necessary for both of you to communicate effectively, join efforts, and ensure you have the same goals and behavioral expectations in mind for the child. Sherlock you also need to make this relationship clear for yourself. Is it co-parenting to maintain a family for your child? Is it a friendship, are there any other prospects for the two of you? I believe there is still work to do there, for you to be able to continue your progress effectively.” The doctor looked at Sherlock, whose leg jumped in place as he sat before him.
They reveled in being together, in using the week they had alone to reconnect, to get used to sharing the same space again, to fitting in with one another. There were cuddles, and shared showers and baths, and cooking together. There was the violin, and John revealing his art to Sherlock, who was very impressed, and there was a healthy amount of enthusiastic sex. John enjoyed, and learned, and tried not to think of how Sherlock had furthered his education in that specific topic. They also packed John’s flat, bringing the boxes back home. They bought some things they considered they needed for the flat and the one in the basement. They went to the Yard to hand Donovan some reports, and had coffee with Mike, finally going to Dr. Quentin, to sign up for monthly couples therapy sessions at least for the time being.
“I didn’t want to spoil this.” he said, showing the two of them with his hand. “I didn’t ever mean to stay at the conference, to miss the wedding. What I want is to dance with you. I want you to…” His words got lost in his nerves, as he tried to swallow the knot in his throat and his eyes moistened up.
“I told you I wanted to be with you. You reminded me you were married and you lied that you were straight. I begged you: ‘Greg, Greg, please’ and you said…”
Our men open a tentative communication line, and lay out some serious feelings. Rosie and Nyla have fun with an experiment at 221B and their parents do too. Mango rum, anyone?  John is feeling a bit left out. Sherlock reassures him. Then, the mysterious messages Rosie is getting. It turns a bit interesting, when the perpetrator is revealed.
Across the dinner there was a big room, the library that John had said he had wanted, with floor to ceiling bookshelves, rolling library ladder included, covering a whole wall, and a media center with three computers, a fax and a copier, a file cabinet, two rolly chairs, a proper desk on the other side. A large sofa, which seemed big enough to be a daybed, was against the window wall.
As if on cue, the man seemed to know when John had been thinking about him. They had been out to meet the “Team” of Huskies they would be working with and his first thought upon seeing the happy, energetic dogs had been; ‘oh, Sherlock would love this!’ He had seen the face the detective would make, his eyes shining with delight, the real smile that John loved, the multitude of chins, surrounded by the beautiful creatures. John’s mind had gone as far as to thinking he would find out about booking them a stay when he remembered with a start that they were broken up.
John had known what was about to happen from the time he saw Sherlock walk towards Luther. It had been little more than two months since the night he had seen Sherlock dance. Now, Luther held Sherlock’s hand with their fingers intertwined, here at his grandkid’s party, as if they had been together forever, and steadily walked towards the parking lot with him, talking and making Sherlock laugh out loud.
He poured out two cups of coffee, making hers the way she liked it. “Is that what girlfriends do? Feed you up?”*
John shifted Sherlock’s leg, took a moment to apply lube and went back to caressing his fiance, playing with his rim, and teasing him with his finger tips, eliciting some beautiful sounds, Sherlock tried to contain. John  held his cock tight in his hand, and introduced his finger. Though John thought this approach was tamer than some of their more energetic sessions, Sherlock seemed to find himself overwhelmed with the sensations. John could feel Sherlock’s back trembling, his breath fast and short, his hands reaching for any part of John he could touch. John entered him then, the sensation of filling him completely was breathtaking, the knowing that he was giving Sherlock pleasure making him thrust harder, the rhythmic contact with his body making Sherlock groan quite loudly. John’s agile hand flew over Sherlock’s cock, varying it’s grasp and speed. Sherlock was always vocal, and trying to tone it down must have added to his torment. He pulled the pillow to his face and started rocking back hard. John cursed a couple of times, and picked up his own pace. Sherlock came first, his usual noises lowered to whimpers, John quickly after, breathing hard, but having managed to keep the noise down to approved levels. As they came together again, in bed, after their trip to the shower, John noticed Sherlock had his ring on.
They held each other, skin against skin, for a long time. When John was about to turn the lamp off, Sherlock pushed him belly up and raised his head on his hand. “May I touch you?” John nodded his consent, and watched Sherlock touch his arm, his chest, making circles with his index finger through John’s chest hair. He got on his knees and drew the contour of John’s body, trying to temper his feelings by collecting plain and rational data. “You’ve lost fat. These muscles are newly defined.” He touched John’s legs, rubbing his hands against the body hair. He touched both feet, enveloping each one in his hands, pressing on the soles as he did when he gave massages. He then went back up to the shoulders, the left one, with the old scar. Sherlock followed the outlines with his finger, the lines around his eyes spoke of longing. The slight tremor in his hand of suppressed desires, “How I have missed you,” he sighed.
“Mike Stamford told me D.I Harris needed help with a case of a disappearing veteran. I took these as my volunteer hours.” John gave Sherlock a look over. Looked well, not lost any weight since last time, clothes impeccably clean, except now for shoes and Belstaff. The git was looking anywhere but at him.
“He really meant it, that we were coming back, you see? He says he doesn’t want our visits to change. I stropped and had a fit, and was really nasty on the way there. The attendant came and she took me to the front of the train. She talked about how she was divorced and her children spent days with her and days with their dad. She was nice and gave me a fizzy drink.”
Ms. Lane got down to business. “Rosie is doing very well in school. She continues to perform above grade level, even being the youngest student in the class. Her social skills are still appropriate, I’ve observed her getting closer to Nyla, whose parents are going through a divorce. They talk a lot during class. One thing I have observed, is that Rosie seems to have the need to solve problems. She has been striving for nothing less than perfection in her work…”
Our heroes have a busy chapter! What has gotten into John? Oh no! Sherlock is hurt. He has to spend the night at the doctor's.  John gets a glimpse of Sherlock's life during his time...away. An old friend comes around to help Sherlock with the case! John is on it too. Together, they close the Missing Veterans Case! One more friend is invited to celebrate with them. John takes advantage of the situation and invites Sherlock for some drinks, further confusing him. Those pesky trust issues! John is determined to find ways to mend what was broken, some cycling, or some crepes might just be the icebreaker!
Rosie, safe and at home at last, finds out what Sherlock thinks of her behaviour.  John gets a chance to explain his actions, but is Sherlock ready to move on? As they are both busy, Sherlock with work, John with his and his drawings, we get a glimpse of what they are working on in therapy. (Welcome to this universe's take on S4). John joins Sherlock when there is a break on the Missing Veteran's Case, with some..., interesting developments.
The boy, no,  Sherlock, seemed rapt. He listened and looked and John had never felt so… seen before. Sherlock asked questions no one else had thought to, such as what kind of side effects had the medicines he received at trauma center had on him (the ongoing hand tremors) What did he think would help him with the PTSD? (Getting back into action? Not happening with his leg and his shoulder). Was he planning on moving closer to Barts now that he had a job? (John could barely afford his current bedsit).
“I doesn’t appear to be broken, or sprained, sir. Mashed up and torn, yes. You should go to hospital and get x-rays. That is going to need some stitching and anti inflammatories. A cane would help keep your weight off of it.”
Sherlock was frozen for a moment, blinking, while John fidgeted around in his pocket and found the bag.
The musicians, who were playing classical music, suddenly quieted, then started playing. The guests started hooting and cheering and clapping. The trio of little girls came down the aisle in coordinated dance moves.
tie your hands, John,” Sherlock warned. “I'm attempting to teach you discipline, but if you refuse to learn, I'll have to punish you.” And God, John wanted it more than anything.
Finally, the door to her dressing room was in sight, and Sherlock could see the glow of her vanity lights seeping beneath it invitingly. Once they were inside, it was impossible to keep from drawing her close. She allowed it, spinning to slide her hands up his shoulders and around his neck to drag him down. For a moment, neither of them moved. Whatever happened outside of those dressing room doors was of no consequence, because nothing could sever the connection between them.
John felt his eyebrows nearly touch his hairline. Sherlock, for all that he was dressed like a holy man, was no longer talking like one. Well, he hadn't been to begin with, but honestly, had he no shame?
"You were so delicious like that. In that position, gravity does all the work, and I remember how you felt, taking me all the way into you," Sherlock bit off with a groan, and John mimicked the sound, bypassing his erection to knead his balls. "I love your thighs, how soft they are, but strong. I can't get enough of being in between them, the way they squeeze around my waist. Enough strength to remind me that it's a man I'm fucking."
The problem lie in the fact that John found Sherlock fascinating, and though he would never confess to being damned near besotted with his employer, that's exactly what he was. John found the temptation of Sherlock erotic and impossible to ignore. When he allowed himself to come anywhere near the man, John was no longer in control of his body, and his mind was, most assuredly, a slippery slope.
know. Jim Moriarty's presence had ruined the best thing that had ever come to him, and now, there was no one and nothing to use as leverage against him. Moriarty had made one fatal mistake.
Sherlock ignored the child and walked past Molly, swinging around the corner with still no sign of John. He turned to glare at Molly, wondering if she'd played him, anything to get him to the morgue, to see John before he was... buried where Sherlock could no longer reach him.
Holmes brought his hands up under his chin and steepled them, acquiring an expression that landed between bored and pensive. "If you're asking if there was anyone that helped me through the process, then no, I credit no one." The man's eyes narrowed as he paused, chewing over his next words. "I'm not what you would call a man of the people; I am a man of science. I simply took something that interests me and hired like-minded people. The work did the rest."
So, um... oops. Haha! I guess this is going to be a three-shot. I didn't want to leave you all in suspense, and also I was very much inspired and motivated to write this chapter. Thank you all so much for your support of my story, and I hope you enjoy this chapter! Also, on a side note, I have ventured into my first tumblr foray. I was approached by a read who asked if I had a tumblr, and I am ashamed to say that I am a lurker, and have no real idea how to use it, but if anyone is curious, here is my url. I suppose if I learn how to use it, I will post update info, or excerpts, if anyone would be interested.
“Actually,” Greg began stiffly, at the the same time that Sherlock raised one brow and said to John, “He thought we were having sex.”
The interior was no less decrepit than the face of the building, and Sherlock cursed himself for feeling anything close to pity for John, that he had to return to poverty. Sherlock promptly stuffed that particular emotion away. If there was one thing he knew about John, it was that he was stubborn and prideful. Pity of any kind on Sherlock’s part would push him away faster than any contemptible words.
The last question only encouraged John to clamp his lips shut and keep the fanciful thoughts to himself.
Again, the room faded away to the tent, where John was removing his shirt, pulling it over his head and letting it slide down his arms while Sherlock's eyes tracked down his chest. “Sometimes, they would want me to undress quickly, but others liked a strip tease, so I'd pull my shirt off slow for them.”
It wasn't a promise or declaration of love, but it was more than John had ever expected from Sherlock. The man seemed surprised with himself and John couldn't blame him. Who knew Sherlock could be so chatty?
Sherlock's fingers were back to his cuffs, toying with the button although it was perfect, just like the rest of his ensemble.
"Please, restrain yourself from thinking quite so loudly." Sherlock's chocolate baritone pushed through his thoughts, frayed with annoyance.
Sherlock cleared his throat awkwardly, which John found endearing. He could see why phone conversations weren't to Sherlock's usual taste. It seemed goodbyes were the most uncomfortable part for him.
No. John wasn't ready. The events from earlier in the day had proved that. John was hurt, and Sherlock was angry. Not because John was hurt, but because he was at his end with the hunters and their game. He deserved to live, every wolf did, and not in fear for their lives. Sherlock wanted to kill them all. Every last one of them, even the innocents. Then, the wolves could begin a new world, maybe keep a few of the humans and make examples out of
“Oh no, oh there I go again. I need a spanking, 'cause I've—” Sway. “—been—” Sway. “—bad.” Sherlock’s erection pressed insistently against his trousers. Watching Lady Grey dance so flagrantly sexual, so shamelessly was nearly too much. Not only was his mind overloading with all the possible positions he could take her in, but data was spilling into his mind palace at an alarming rate. Rooms were filling up that he hadn’t even known he had, and Sherlock was helpless to stop it. “So let my body do the talkin'. I'll slip you that hot, sweet, sexy loving.”
There was no actual washing happening. Instead, John had him crowded against the wall and Sherlock was three fingers deep in John’s arse, groaning as a slick tongue trailed against the slit of his lips.
It wasn't long before the food was out, and John was huddled over the plate, eating as if it would be his last meal. Turkey, he noticed, and mash along with the trimmings. a Christmas meal, John thought with pleasant surprise. Vaguely, he thought that he should be embarrassed, eating like that in front of an extremely attractive man that he barely knew, but the realization that there was tangible, warm food sitting in front of him, far outweighed any humiliation he might have felt.
She giggled as John stood in front of the tiny mirror on his bedroom wall, attempting to brush his cowlick into submission. "John, you're to wear a hole in your head."
Sherlock snickered, earning himself a mullish glare from John before he took pity and reached over to help. “Honestly, John. I was under the impression you were of—at the very least—average intelligence. Perhaps I overestimated.”
There wasn't a relaxed muscle in Puppy's body, but Jim? Jim was quite at home. In fact, he had many good memories in that chair that Puppy was occupying. Sherlock had been quite the imaginative lover.
John turned back to the fridge to hide his smile, shaking his head as he retrieved all the fixings to make a new sandwich. "How long have you been here?"
Mycroft cast John a long, searching look, before turning to Sherlock and nodding, his hands tightening over the handle of his brolly until his knuckles bleached white. “And what of you, brother, it seems you have a different agenda in mind.”
“Yes,” Sherlock replied. “I’ve something I need to look into.” He stopped, hesitating with his heart in his throat. He didn’t know why he was nervous all of a sudden. Perhaps he was anxious to be leaving John at the flat alone. The thought of coming back to an empty home made his stomach churn. Feeling restless, Sherlock shifted from one foot to the other. “When I’ll return, we’ll continue where we were?”
The man backed out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him, a tiny smirk lifting the corner of his lips. No sooner than the door had shut than John was stepping into the shower, turning the handle to it's warmest setting. God, it felt so good to be cleaning his body. He had been sitting for too long in that dank basement covered in mud and sweat, with no clothes to cover his indecency. Lestrade had been a godsend.
Slowly, John brought his forefinger to his lips and let it rest there for a moment, just to tease, the way he would a hard cock.
"He's not a very nice man, Mike. Incredibly arrogant and self-serving. Why would you possibly want to interview him?" John was genuinely curious.
"John," the middle-aged woman greeted him enthusiastically, not looking at all out of place behind the counter of her store, filled wall-to-wall with odd trinkets and rare old books that John would have once found himself intrigued by. Now, he didn't have much time for such fanciful notions. "What can I do you for, love?"
Fortunately, the lady from before was nowhere to be found, and his clothes were neatly folded on the couch, where he'd left them. Without Sherlock to distract him, the flat seemed oddly quiet, though comfortable, and John couldn't deny that he felt the least bit reluctant to leave. Already, John felt he'd overstayed his welcome, so he beat a hasty retreat and hailed a cab to take himself home.
Rather abruptly, the tenuous tether of their connection was snapped when Sherlock turned away, slamming the door behind him as he retreated to the main room.
." The last words were hissed against his ear before a hot mouth enveloped the lobe, suckling messily on the flesh.
Since he'd left home, Jasper had drifted from place to place, never staying in one for too long, knowing that his father and Uncle Mycroft were looking for him. It was nearly impossible to avoid every CCTV camera, but the clothes he'd purchased from Oxfam created a better disguise. Someone had stolen his glasses the night before at the shelter, and so he squinted into the distance, searching for signs of a tail.
Sherlock panted, dropping his head against John's shoulder. His breath pushed out in hot puffs of air against the smaller man's shoulder. John slumped back against the tree, though Sherlock's trembling arms still held his thighs captive.
Sherlock turned, pulling the infant possessively to his chest. He wasn't going to let Mycroft take John.
Sherlock didn't look away throughout John's speech, just settled that unnerving gaze upon him and was dissolving his layers piece by piece, reading him like the open book that he was.
Gillian was red in the face, and up close, John could hear his teeth grinding against one another. "Sod off, you fucking freak! Can't you see we're busy 'ere!"
John thought that he'd been so totally wrong, that he didn't read between the lines, because there's no way Sherlock could not have loved him back. There was no feigning heartbreak, and that one word -
John pulled his knees up to his chest, attempting to curl away the anxiety, but it kept building and building. He didn't want his last time with Sherlock to be this way. “Sherlock-”
Sherlock swallowed. He blinked. It might have been the light, but John thought he saw those pale, razor-sharp cheekbones redden a little.
"Sherlock…" John stared in awe at the boy before him, dressed to the nines in an elegant navy tuxedo and felt his face burn. "You look…stunning."
Greg opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by the teacher snapping at them both to stop talking and get on with their work. It was with reluctance that Greg did so, but John was grateful for the interruption.
No, John! It was my fault, if only I’d warned you about Mary, if only I hadn’t rushed in there thinking I knew what I was doing, if only I hadn’t been so selfish and so, so stupid –
A little tentatively, Sherlock took John’s hand, and they began to head over to the floor. “Who’s going to lead?” he whispered, happily, in John’s ear.
We passed through to the back room. It was low-lit, the only windows facing the buildings across the narrow lane, and vintage wine bottles lined the walls. Sherlock chose a small table for two in one corner and I sat down opposite him.
“This is nice,” said John after a while, turning momentarily to his companion. The image of Sherlock – the drama of his billowing coat and his scarf streaming behind him like a banner, juxtaposed with that ridiculous bike helmet – filled him with a great warm flood of fondness. The detective glanced at him and a corner of his mouth twitched into a half-smile.
“Watch the road, John,” he said. “Don’t want you falling flat on your face because you were staring at me instead.”
Gloves, yes. I didn’t think. But I always think. Why didn’t I think? Oh. I was thinking about John. Again. Why does that keep happening? It’s distracting. I can’t focus on the work. I can only focus on him. Do I need to focus on anything other him? Why do I need to focus on anything other than him? I like to focus on him. My John Watson.
Deep breath. Steadied myself. Felt almost as though I was intruding, as though this was something too close, too intimate, but… I couldn’t stop reading. Suddenly my eyes were moving of their own accord, my brain interpreting involuntarily. Had to continue.
Sherlock was far from convinced, but he refrained from commenting. This led to an awkward silence. A deafening silence. A silence so tense, the air pressure probably increased because of it. It was a wonder their ears didn’t pop.
I closed my eyes. "That was the last time that gun ever pointed towards me. The next time I picked it up was to save you - a much better use, I think."
Sherlock jumped up from his foetal position in a sudden energetic bound. He crossed the room and snatched his coat from a peg by the front door. John tracked his movements with wide eyes. It always amazed John how easily he could lose control of a situation to Sherlock.
Serviettes, hundreds of them, folded into origami replicas of the Syndey Opera House, and the occasional swan. Me, sitting there, like a child, surrounded by them. Like a prisoner, surrounded by sentries, guards, isolating me. Alone. So alone. And, and Mary, too. And John was there! Except he wasn’t. Mary, she wouldn’t let him – she wouldn’t let
I couldn’t read it anymore. Too much. Too personal, too… intimate. I scanned the rest. Couldn’t give part of it a second glance – the fall. I’ll never forgive myself for what I put him through. In trying to save the one person I care about most I made him suffer so much it was almost for nothing. Oh, John, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. John…
He rolled his eyes, sliding the phone from his breast pocket and handing it to me. He watched as I unlocked it (he changed the code every day but taught me the algorithm so I could work it out) and read aloud the message, which was indeed from Mycroft.
“Come on, before I change my mind.” Sherlock gave one of those alluring half-smiles before whisking around, coat fanning in a cloak-like arc, and leaving the building.
or something at work. Devine intervention, like. Y'know? And God, it's a bloody good job I didn't, because you know what? Not an hour later, after I'd put that damned gun down and told myself I had to keep fighting, Stamford rang."
"Look, Sherlock," I began, in the most commanding voice of which I am able in order to get him to pay the least bit attention. "It's somewhere I've always wanted to go to," I said, "and, now I've been granted the opportunity, I'd like to go there,
I ran my fingers over it and no: it’s older than any of those serviettes could be. Not one of those, then; unrelated. Irrelevant. Good.
“It’d, er. It’d just be you and me. Together. Erm.” John licked his lips – an action which Sherlock observed very closely – and looked away. Some of the contempt seemed to dissipate from Sherlock’s face.
nobody can love me, I'm... I'm a freak. I'm a sociopath. Everyone knows I'm... I'm just an emotionless, hollow
I wondered how ever it had taken me this long to realise that my affection for him exceeded that of simple friendship (as I had foolishly presumed) and strayed into a far more romantic, serious form of love. I wondered how I had ever lived without knowing how the passionate touch of his lips felt on mine, and without craving that feeling again.
"It's okay," I reassured him. "It's okay because I didn't, I didn't pull that trigger. I wonder... although of course you'll just scoff at this, but, but still... I wonder if it was some kind of, of
But enough of that. At this point, however attracted I was to him, his whining was really beginning to test my patience.
John frowned. “You never know, you might enjoy it. I find it quite relaxing. You should give it a chance.”
"You know what, Sherlock? Stop being such a stubborn bastard and let loose a little, just for one weekend. I'm going to take you all round Venice and you're gonna enjoy it, or at least keep your mouth shut for long enough for me to enjoy it." Yes, at that point I had finally snapped. What could I do? It was a desperate, pathetic, even, attempt, but this was the best chance I had at getting Sherlock completely alone, in a calm circumstance...
I couldn't live with the one who had endangered his life again, so soon after he had, against all odds, granted me that miracle I wished for at his 'grave'. I couldn't live with the one who had almost stolen him away from me again. It was then that I had realised that it was
I nodded, dropping my gaze to the dark, choppy waters behind us. "I met you, Sherlock. The single best thing that has ever happened to me."
“John, my life is continually under threat from murderers, criminal networks, vengeful adulterers, assassins, and on bad days Mrs Hudson when she’s cheesed off with my experiments. A bike helmet is not particularly one of my concerns.”
He nodded forcefully into my shoulder. I could feel the brisk rise and fall of his chest pressed against me; the rapid beating of our hearts combining into a mellifluous rhythm through only the thin fabric of our shirts.
“You two are looking very dapper, gentlemen,” drawled Greg Lestrade, amiably smacking them both on their backs.
Ignoring him, I continued. "The night before we first met, I had a gun to my temple. Alright? I had a gun to my temple because I had nothing to live for anymore. Nobody to love, nobody who loved
"Not really, no. It is freakishly quiet for a city of its apparent cultural importance. The only people around other than all these gondoliers seem to be pathetically over-enthusiastic tourists. And some pickpockets
John's innards seemed to turn to cement, and then to solidify. He swallowed, and licked his lips. "C'mon, that's even more ridiculous.”  There was a moment’s silence. Sensing Greg was unconvinced, he went on, his voice taking on a despondent tone. “As if he'd go to prom with me.”
Things like when we went out for a walk one day. Together. He said I’d been cooped up too long and needed to breathe so we should go out for a walk. Just John and I. Just us. How I like it to be. How it should be.
"Honestly, John, I've told you before..." he said, looking up to the heavens as if they could offer some form of solace for my evident shortcomings, "romance is a superficial concept that leads only to trouble and regret. Who would wish to visit a place that inspires that?"
“Sorry,” said John, as carefree as he could manage. “I didn’t mean to intrude, I just, er, was surprised, that’s all. Erm.” John prayed he wasn’t blushing, but even if he wasn’t, his rapidly beating heart was threatening to make a break for it from his ribcage at any moment, and that, he thought, would probably give the game away equally effectively.
Ignoring John’s embarrassing exclamation with unusual tact, Sherlock slipped on his gloves. “I thought you wanted to go cycling. I presume you did not intend to do so within the cottage.”
They came to a stop. John, not releasing his flatmate’s hand, dismounted his bicycle, took a step over to Sherlock, who just about remembered to put a foot on the floor before John closed the distance between them and suddenly they were kissing.
"Jo-- sorry," he shook his head. "I don't... I don't understand. What was that? What does it... what does it mean?"
At this point, I think it may be best to confess that over the last couple of years, since Sherlock's... return, I have felt a little differently about him.
Sherlock sat there, an almost unreadable expression playing across his sharp features, and blinked. He seemed to be trying to form sentences, or just words... some way of verbalising what was going on in that beautiful mind.
I tried to prepare myself for the inevitable worst, but how would I be able to survive without Sherlock by my side? If I had frightened him so, then what if there was now an awful, awkward tension between us?
Back against the wall in a little alcove between a cupboard and a locker tower, John wiped his eyes and took a few deep, shuddering breaths, until, to all appearances, he was utterly calm, unfazed. He held up his hand: absolutely still. Good. But even with this near-perfect façade, could he really hope to fool Sherlock Holmes into believing that nothing was up?
John tapped the red plastic monstrosity on his head. “Better than the alternative. Aren’t you gonna wear one?”
Upon making it outside, John Watson found Sherlock Holmes poised on a bicycle, balancing another by his side. He gave it a nudge, and, after a short moment of eye-contact, John climbed onto it.
I was taken aback by the question. I hadn't even thought about it, about what it really meant. It just meant that I loved him, and, apparently, that he loved me.
He stepped out of the alcove and turned to see Sherlock standing at the foot of the stairs, his beautiful alabaster face lined in consternation. John avoided his eyes.
There came a point when John could stand the crushing weight of it no longer -- there was an elephant in the room, and he now realised he was going to have to be the one to point it out. He steeled himself. And then he did what he had vowed never to do. With a few words, he put everything on the line.
He said my name with the softest, lowest, (dare I say affectionate?) voice I have ever heard, and my heart was in my throat.
Noticed my own name. All over the place. Almost every paragraph. About me, then? Why was John writing about me? A feeling, in my chest, just inside my ribs, like a chasm being suddenly filled with some alien substance. Strong. Overpowering. I blinked, shook it off.
With the hint of a smile, John pushed off, the wheels spinning with ease after the initial exertion. Sherlock caught up and they cycled side by side.
"Sherlock…" murmured John, still clinging to the lapel of the other boy's blazer with one hand, and his wrist with the other. "Sherlock," he said again, so overcome with joy and disbelief that no other words seemed to present themselves, so that his vocabulary was momentarily limited to just one name. He kissed him again, because he was there and he could, and he thought that maybe if he did it enough times he would realise that he actually
The background music started to fade, and the room turned expectantly to the DJ, who announced that it was now time for the slow dance, and will people please make their way to the dancefloor with their partners. Sherlock looked back at John, his face a picture of joy and surprise. “You didn’t tell me there was going to be a proper slow dance. I love dancing. Always loved it.”
"And for those two years it was the thought of seeing you again, of keeping you safe, that gave me the strength to keep fighting. And then... and then when I returned, there was..."
And John reached out and wiped it off, so gently, and he smiled at me with such a tender look in his eyes and, and, and I thought…
It was an accident, what happened. I didn’t mean for it to happen. Really. I only put my hands in my pockets! It’s a habit, an old habit, putting my hands in my pockets when I’m standing around. I don’t like standing around. Boring. John’s not boring.
Suddenly the gondola struck a wall and rocked to a halt, and Sherlock leant back from me. Our trip now over, he stood up and stepped out of the boat, then stretched a hand out to me, which I took, and helped me out too.
A wave of emotion washed over me as I stared down at Sherlock. His dormant figure was just too reminiscent of the body I had seen... Then.
For maybe half an hour they pedalled, appreciating the scenery, and each other’s company, and speaking very little. It was on a flat stretch of path, wide enough for them to ride next to each other again, that it happened.
Trust John. He can see straight through me. Like glass. Cellophane, maybe. Trust John to understand.
"Well," I said, trying to stay calm, "what's the first place that comes to you when you think of romance?"
John grinned; this was one of the few times he’d seen Sherlock act excitedly over anything other than gruesome homicides. “We could take turns. I’ll start, you can finish.”
"Anyway, what about all the canals?" continued John. At this point I admit I was starting to sound rather desperate. As if the great Sherlock Holmes would be interested in petty canals.
John’s jacket. It was too short, yes, it was much too short, really. I suppose it looked ridiculous. But I didn’t care. I don’t care what people think of me. Except for John. I care then. Does he realise that? Can you see that I try to be a better person for you, John? I make sure I care. I want to show I care, John. I want to show I care about you. I care what people think of
"Right, she's horrible to Sherlock." Greg laughed, but then his grin slowly morphed into a serious expression of realisation. He raised his head, his features a picture of clarity. "God, you'll be going with him, won't you? Surely you're going with Sherlock?"
It was John’s own fault, really. Except it wasn’t. Don’t blame John. Mustn’t blame John. But it wasn’t on purpose. Should never have happened. It was just an accident.
-John. Your daughter has your mouth. This kind of vocabulary may not be conducive to a harmonic interaction. I will attempt to defuse the situation. In the future, please refrain from trashing Rosie’s objects without her knowledge, especially those with the apis mellifera on them. SH
The older man practically purred. Sherlock’s mouth fell open again, alarmingly red faced now, while he heard someone having a cough attack. Yes, John. Whom Luther did not seem aware of until Sherlock took a deep breath and turned a little. He tried not to see John’s upset face.
“I’m trembling in my britches thinking about what the good doctor will do to me!” Sherlock said with a snarl.
Lizbeth gasped, put her hands to her face and half sat, half fell into the armchair behind her. “Oh God! Charlie knows? Sherlock, why are you doing this? Aren’t you back with John? Charlie told me there was nothing between the two of you!”
“To be with a person we should have gotten together with a long time ago.” John said, all businesslike.
I will recommend another favorite, among the first fics I read when flirting with the Sherlock Fandom:
“Being a grown-up is horrid. When I fight with Nyla, we can get so angry and scream, but the next day, we talk again and it’s done. Pepsi doesn’t even fight, she just sighs, rolls her eyes and needs some “space”. Sometimes she goes and sits to lunch with someone else. I hate that, but the next day, we talk and we’re ok. You guys separated almost a year ago, and are still sorting it out. Dad loves you Sherlock. He got drunk at Molly’s when you left with Luther. They thought I didn’t notice or understand but I did. I felt a tiny bit mad at you.” Rosie got up and went to brush her teeth, leaving Sherlock to blink the new information in.
So they stood together, looking at the people dancing until Greg left, with his daughter holding his arm while he waved goodbye with the other hand, and people started following. They watched some late dancers. That was, John watched, as Sherlock walked, not quite steadily to the bar for one more whisky, then came back to stand next to John. The dancers started leaving, the club emptying out. John looked for Molly, and thought for a moment that Sherlock had disappeared. He hadn’t. He was now, sitting on the floor, giggling, whisky in hand.
One Sunday, after doing some errands, John came home with groceries, intending to drop them off and join Sherlock at Barts, where he was going over some results for a case where the victim was supposed to have mistaken his medicine with somebody else’s that had been ‘accidentally left’ in the family’s kitchen. Mrs Hudson, stopped him as he came in. “John, dear, please come see me after you put that away, I have something for Sherlock,” she sounded anxious.
John looked at his little family, as they were in a cab back home. Mrs Hudson talking animatedly with the cab driver, about ‘herbal’ alternatives to pills for hip problems, the cabbie, responding to her perkily. Rosie, fast asleep, head on his lap, feet on Sherlock’s, his guy sitting so quietly, wide awake, looking out, with his elbow on the window, his fingers bothering his lower lip. As they got near 221, he turned to John “Could I …? John could I …”
“No.” He said sternly, and heard her gasp. He was never stern with her. “Sorry Little Bee. I’m not alright at the moment. I need some more time to sort myself out. Please go back to Nana’s, get a couple more hours of sleep and help her with breakfast. I’ll be better by then.”
She was lulled to sleep. When she woke up, the sun was full on her face, close to noon. Had they been stopped? The trip usually didn’t take so long.
Sherlock blinked, and blinked. Daddy? To a young man like Hal? He did the math in his head. Goodness! He could be this young man’s father! Before he could think of anything to say, or even process that Hal was in his personal space, he felt a force yank Hal away.
“Quite frankly John, given the amount of interaction we have had this year, it never occurred to me that you would notice my absence, much less ‘go crazy’ over me. And even if you had noticed, I would have thought you would be happy without me to distract you from the predictable, ordinary life you have chosen to live under our roof. God forbid I try to tell you what the cases are about, or try to ask you for help!” Sherlock was projecting an ‘Iceman’ so cold, Mycroft would seem cozy.
One of the men groaned, and the boy turned around and bolted. John took a moment to think of the best way to get out of the alley, when the creature came back, took his hand, and scolded him, his nose scrunched and his brows furrowed
“Yeah. You know why? My mom was soo happy! It made me remember how things used to be, before we moved and they separated. Over there, my family is, open, you know. Grandma is happy, she likes to go to cookouts, she goes to dances, Grandpa guides people through the appalachian trails. My Pop has three kids, and they’re my brothers and my baby sis, too. My aunt loves to do my hair and my nails. She made me outfits! We have a big family and Sundays we all get together. Here, it’s each mom on her own, and I always worry about “Mom” when I’m with “Mum”.
“Yes love of course.” So John coated his fingers and prepared him, as they kissed, and he used his other hand to stroke Sherlock’s arms, his legs, When Sherlock said, “I’m ready, John” he didn’t ask about positions, because his husband clearly wanted to look into his eyes,
“Yes, it did happen, while I was unknowingly under the influence of hallucinatory drugs, at the time we were working out what my wife had been doing. I felt horrid about the incident. I confess I started drinking. I ended up going to anger management therapy for years. It was the worst of times, and I have never laid a hand on him in anger again. However, my sister helped me realise I did criticise him harshly, make fun of him and singled out his mistakes. Harry said I was behaving like my emotionally abusive, dead wife.”
Daddy Holmes handed John a manila envelope. It held the title to a cottage in Sussex Downs. “What is this? This is way to much, Mycroft.”
“Well, I did know of you. Your husband obviously loves you very much. We talked about our loves. John, please do finish coming in.”
“The bloody evidence was circumstantial! Sherlock we need to talk!” John said, his voice raising on it’s own.
“Oh baby, that was so good, you are beautiful baby, so gorgeous, so good.” The man’s evident happiness, his praise and the way he looked at him made Sherlock feel good about the experience. He could feel himself smiling. Luther got up to the loo to wash himself up and brought wipes for Sherlock. “You can stay, alright?  Nobody is going to bother us here.” Sherlock was quite overwhelmed by his first John free orgasm in so long, that he surprised himself by falling asleep in Luther’s big, strong arms. It had been so long since he was held like this, since someone stroked his hair and made sure he was under the covers. The big man woke him up in the morning by stroking a different part of him, slipping a condom on him and taking him in his mouth, fitting all of him and sucking just right, then sucking just at the tip, and it had been so long since he had been on the receiving end of this particular act that it was almost over way too soon. The last time John had...Nope. Shut that thought down. It was certainly mind blowing, his head blanking out of everything. Later, Sherlock took a shower and shared a coffee and toast breakfast with Luther. He asked Sherlock for his phone and put his number in it.
