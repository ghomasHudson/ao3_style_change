"A sleepover," John repeated, laughing at Sherlock's baffled expression. "It's what friends do - they invite each other over to their house and have fun."
“What? I’m your guinea pig?”
“That’s true. Bloody hell, I never thought of it much. But yeah, you have a point. Poor guy. I was thinking of making him a nice present for his birthday anyway and leave it with Mrs Hudson to give it to him when we’ve gone back to university. You know, to give him something pretty he could appreciate? Perhaps he and his special person broke up on his birthday and it’s somehow tied together and that’s why he hates celebrating it.”
“Yes, well,” Sherlock murmured into the crook of John’s neck, though a smile crept up his mouth, threatening to lift the corners of his mouth. “Now you know I was running about like a right idiot.”
“Mike’s a good guy. And I think you should be more serious about our homework,” John replied, skipping the last two steps, jumping down on the cold marble floor. It was getting late, fires lighting the way for them to the Great Hall. John insisted on them going to dinner every day; it was tedious, but Sherlock indulged him. Keeping John happy was an easy task this way, and Sherlock found out he loved it when John was happy.
At last, Dimmock put handcuffs on the man, wheezing for air. The policeman victoriously raised Lestrade’s handcuffed hand, which jerked away immediately, banging into the car acoompanied by a, “
“Perhaps.”
It was at that moment not only John, but Greg and the rest of the carriage sucked in a breath, sharply bracing themselves for the verbal blow Anderson was about to receive.
Ironically enough, it wasn’t the portal nor the inevitable anomalies that worried Greg. No, that prize was taken by the Club. They were a bunch of well-bred morons, but he shouldn’t underestimate them. If they plan to buy out properties across the Falls like the cult that they are he will need to take more precautions to ensure John and the kids and the Shack are safe. That shouldn’t be too hard since they’ll be going to university in the last week of August after John’s birthday. However….
After the Feast was officially over, he met up with Sherlock outside the Great Hall, Greg having been lost in the crowd.
“I’ll remember it for the occasion when I open a gallery,” she promised, peeking in the cupboards. “Is there any apple juice left? We could do shots.”
"What's wrong?" asked John when they stopped in the middle of the sidewalk.
"Believe it or not, there are better things to do than study Astronomy," Sherlock said lightly.
Sherlock was sitting at the Ravenclaw table for once (he didn't eat consistently as John came to find out, which was bewildering to the Gryffindor) so John plopped down next to him, ignoring glances from the other Ravenclaws.

She was supposed to meet Moran here. He wanted a report on her journal deciphering. She didn’t understand why on Earth a phone call wouldn’t suffice but she had to listen to his ‘orders’ since he was her superior. She rolled her eyes at that, willing this pain to be over. If there was one person she wanted to punch more than Adler, it was Moran.
Hello everyone! Welcome back to Reichenbach Falls, where John deals with his ex, Irene has his back, and Sherlock is pining~
"He has his uses," Cedric agreed, patting him on the back. He readjusted his backpack on his shoulders, prodding Blake to walk with him. They didn't have classes since it was Sunday, but he still carried something in it.
“Too late to worry about that now,” Dad said, half-laughing. He let out a sigh. “The system isn’t flawless, and I’m sure there was more that could be done. Even today, a word from someone in a higher position is valued more than the truth.”
, I haven’t learned
"No one important," purred the Prefect. He leaned comfortably on the desk behind him while John froze to his spot near the doors. "A concerned party, if you will. An enemy, even."
“Anyone’s right for the course,” she said, expression unreadable but firm. There was something aloof and yet guarded about her. She fished her phone out and asked for Sherlock’s name to put in her calendar, frowning upon hearing it, fingers hovering above the screen briefly before entering the information into a pixelated box with rapid efficiency. Sherlock was used to a variety of reactions to his unusual name, this being the mildest.
Take care,
Cas peeks out from the kitchen that is separated from the living room by a counter.
“The task will take place on November twenty-fourth, and the other students and a panel of judges will be present to give out a score after your performance.
“Nah. Anything’s better than staying in the same room with Nic. Crazy dude, that man.”
“You don’t need to take seven days off, but five are enough. Tomorrow’s Sunday, Hudders can pack in an hour’s notice. You can go at noon and get back on Friday afternoon. We’ll keep your Shack as shaggy as it is, no need to worry.”
I hope you peeps are good! see you in 5
After a while he stumbled upon a photo post that had someone tweet ‘
“Yes. They’re theirs, but didn’t want to come in because of the toi tois. Which brings me to the question of why on Earth of all that is holy did TARDIS have to put us next to portable toilets?”
“Your worst nightmare,” Sherlock sneered, crowding the elfs space in long strides. “Where is she?”
They already got everything they needed, even milk, which John made Sherlock grab by himself and deposit it in the cart quite childishly, but Captain Watson was relentless in the wars he waged. There were enough groceries for one large bag maximum. Sherlock hovered in front of the honey display, a finger tapping against his chin, lost in thought. He barely listened to John saying something to him.
“Dunno, I’ll ask,” John said, tapping away on the keyboard, vibrations the only sound in the room. He sent the message and tossed the phone on Irene’s bed. Sherlock sat down on the floor, back resting against the side of his bed. John settled himself on his mattress, close so that he could peer over Sherlock’s shoulder. He tried not to shudder when John’s breath tickled the skin where neck meets shoulder.
“Freddie, with all due respect, sir,” Mike said, precariously. “We really need to go home. Our parents are waiting for us to return by eleven.”
Thank you all for reading and I wish you all a very nice day/night wherever you are~
“Dunno. Maybe we missed a secret entrance somewhere,” John joked, observing the statue in front of them again. What would Sherlock look for? There’s not much to look at besides ivy and the arm, which was now robbed of its only decoration. And he sure as hell didn’t want to stick his hands into the ivy, God knows what insects were hiding under its leaves.
he wagged his tail, and Sherlock imagined what may be going on in that small head of his.
Reluctantly, Vitto obeyed and took the money.
It was as though night time reigned in this part of the forest. The flora grew so tall and close together that it was dark everywhere, and only luminescent mushrooms and flowers lit the way. Quite a few of them shone brighter than lightbulbs. The view reminded Sherlock of James Cameron’s Avatar, minus the vampires.
Sherlock picked up the Daily Prophet and giving it one last eye roll, he tore the paper apart into pieces. The sound woke John up, who groggily shifted in his armchair and yawned loudly. Sherlock offhandedly threw the clumps of would-be newspaper in the bin with the help of his wand before John got there.

“Of course, dear,” she tutted, looking wistfully at the flowerbeds. John exhaled in relief, pushing the cart forward and to the right, where… Oh God fucking damnit. Flowers and trees and
King’s Cross was disgustingly filled with too many people to count. All of them were in the way, walking up and down the platform nine-and-three-quarters like headless chickens. Granted, it was minutes until the red train’s departure so it did make sense, but it was annoying nonetheless.
“We can go, Greg,” she said. She came up to John and hugged him. “Take care, will you? I’ll call you once we get to Florida.”
"I have a place in mind," Sherlock said and lead the way downstairs.
Sherlock’s breath hitched, his stomach fluttered. John looked up at him, smiling. God, they were both besotted beyond repair, weren’t they?
“Aha. But… you were the leader of a garrison. Why didn’t you come down here more often? I imagine it would be beneficial to see how, you know, the divine business is doing like.”
Into battle!
. He felt like a part of him that was missing for months was retrieved and safe with him again. Truth be told, he sensed that feeling the very first time he set eyes on Sherlock, but now they were a thing in reality.
“No idea, Bumble.” He crouched and offered the dodo his palm to… sniff it or whatever. The dodo made a strange sound and inched closer. Flocks of birds gathered round, and John felt as though he were a Disney Princess -- or Steve Irwing. He can shake hands with Greg. “Hey there, buddy. We’re friends.”
“Nothin’,” was the muffled answer. Sherlock’s eyebrows rose up and they both went to investigate the commotion.
"Listen, I know you think differently, but there are better ways to say such things," John said, hoping to get some sense into his friend. He also graciously ignored the insult Sherlock threw at him.
is what you should read.”
“That’s not really --”
The golf cart rode over a small rift in the ground, sending them swerving again. They did a three-sixty before John managed to gain control over the cursed vehicle again.
“Yeah, I had the most terrible hour and a half of my life. I thought I was going crazy. Every time we got to the fucking boards for repair, it was as if time had rewound or something. I was sure I blacked out from a heat stroke.”
“Absolutely not,” Sherlock quipped, taking their daughter from John’s arms into his own. John’s shoulder would start hurting soon, anyway. “We’re not supporting any creature of fables who exploits capitalism to spy on small children all year.”
“Anthea,” he said, the lump in his throat almost suffocating him. That’s it, he had to stomp on the breaks.
He rushed into the kitchen to check the knife drawer. God forbid the dolls started acting up again. He’ll have to bury the cutlery in the front yard and buy the plastic alternative. He won’t have these shenanigans with the kids around.
“Christ, alright, we’re

Irene read the anxiousness on his face. Something wasn’t right. She noticed Sherlock leaving minutely two times before -- maybe he was nervous and had a quick smoke, like Greg? But Sherlock had wanted the date as badly as John, and they were enjoying tonight, as much as Greg and Kate allowed them at first -- so where was he?
“Why else do you think I wore that atrocious baseball cap that day on the Lake?”
, did a spectacularly shit job.
Irene peeked out from where she and Kate hid in the crease of Mary’s scarf to see Greg whip his head around, significantly calmer. Seeing an unknown, cheerful woman, however, put him on guard again. The cold look of his ice was icier than the biggest iceberg on Earth. Irene never saw this side of Greg, and she sure as all bloody hell never wanted to have it aimed at her.
“Not gonna lie, I’m freaking out.”
“I think I know what you’re aiming at,” Sherlock said, his toes wiggling excitedly on the floor. “You think we’re connected to the Colour Wheel! Primary colours of the symbols technically correspond with what you’ve said. John has yellow and the bee. Irene’s is red and has a rose that she had collected in the cemetery.”
They came to the barricaded front doors, hearing the group’s muffled chatter outside. Sherlock filtered them out, observing what could be done. No mechanism blocked the entrance per se, even though that was his initial speculation. Instead, there were racks used as props to hold the doors in place.
“Hey Bumble, how was training?” John asked Sherlock as he rounded the corner. Sherlock flashed him a smile and hugged him briefly, not wanting his sweaty stench to be so obvious. He used a lot of his deodorant to mask it, and even though a shower would be better, this had to suffice.
“Because that’s supposed to soothe me. No, really, Sherlock. Is this your theory? That the Chamber of Secrets is under the castle?”
See you in two weeks! Take care & stay healthy~
She came closer, arms crossed and eyes narrowed at the writing up front that proclaimed the blue box to be a ‘Police Public Call Box’. Huh, but those used to be common in Britain, long ago, and not in bloody America. What was it doing here? Was it another, less frequented attraction? No wonder if that was the case; the stench got even stronger up close.
Sherlock straightened his back and paced out of the tunnel towards the light at the end, John right behind him. He expected to see a bland land, but instead he was presented with a jungle full of abundant flowers, plants of unknown species, and a shit ton of birds of every kind.
‘grunkle’. You drag him out of that shop.”
He gave a hollow chuckle. “Yeah, Redbeard would despise it.”
Greg hurried to clarify. “He was my… friend. His brother, I mean. His mother got in touch in March and asked if he and his sister Irene could spend the holiday here, so I said sure. She and her husband went on a trip around the world.”
“I didn’t wanna risk having them thrown out,” John said, frowning at his toes. There was a particular memory
“I know!” Irene squeaked, and she and Kate held each other by the elbows as they jumped around in a circle. She wasn’t all too familiar with this ship -- iron-strange, was it? -- but whoa. In that case, she may convert John to shipping davekat one of these days if she convinces him to read Homestuck with her… “Alright, alright. Lemme calm down. Oof. This is good news, but back to my original topic. When do you guys estimate Johnlock is going to happen?”
“But we’ve never heard of an organization that dealt with extraterrestrials. It never crossed my mind either. I’d like to meet the Doctor and Donna, though.”
“What do you mean?”
The car hitched, snapping Sherlock’s mind to attention. Lestrade put both hands on the steering wheel, straightening the machine, nodding to the beat of ‘
“I do have my enlightening moments,” John said, taking his chance at surprising Sherlock by grabbing his by the nape of his neck and putting their mouths together. Sherlock hummed, taken aback slightly since he was busy glaring at the offensive droplets of rain, but he quickly melted into the soft and sweet brush of their lip, and here they were, kissing in the rain.
. “You could say that.”
John peered over Sherlock at Billy, who listened intently. He nodded and gave him a thumbs up. “That’s gotta be tough, man. What will you do? Look for clues?”
“Why does it matter?” Sherlock said with a mouthful of sandwich. John circled around the desk and grabbed a glass of lemonade for himself, hugging Sherlock with one arm wound around his waist. “I’m taller than all of you combined. You’re definitely shorter when it comes to me.”
. Am I really that flustered? He didn’t seem to mind -- did he lie? Is he taking pity on me?”
“I just want them to be here already,” John said, peeking out the window. “I wanted this sleepover for so long!”
“She has a Quill that writes utter nonsense,” Blake told him, resting his head on the wall. He regretted ever speaking in that woman’s presence. “Be careful what you tell her.”
“Just comfortable,” John said, pressing a final kiss to Sherlock’s cheek as he extricated himself from their embrace. “Okay, we have to stop or we’ll hug until the end of days.”
“That’s nice of you, John. I have to agree. Greg’s been working himself too hard this year, because of…. Well, he’ll tell you by the end of the summer, I’m sure.”
“No, this is the second time I’m actually playing it,” John said, dabbing the brush softly against the canvas surface to make a detail sharper. “You only kipped for an hour, the playlist has less than twenty minutes total.”
drinking liquid sugar,” Donna warned the Doctor, scribbling out the letter ‘v’ in those pointy brackets. Sherlock tapped his marker against his cheek.
“Fifty for the inconvenience of mine having to waste my brain cells to deduce you.”
“What do you think about you being her pity target?” John asked Carl as they crossed the threshold of the Hall.
“Have fun, sweetheart,” Lestrade said, checking his phone for notifications, not really listening to her. Sherlock’s gaze followed Normandy out of the house. Something was not right. “Does she date so randomly in Toronto as well?”
Sherlock’s interest piqued. “What did your grandfather say?”
“Right, let’s go. The sooner we go the sooner we can eat our pie.”
it's chapter 70, and I really missed this the last time, but we're still on 69 kudos if ya know what I mean *insert lenny face*
“Yeah, but I like when you wear my clothes. C’mon, Cas will make sure Irene’s fine while we’re gone.”
“Sure is. Scoot over, my legs are turning into melt.”
and the audience applauded for five minutes. During the rest of the show, John, Sherlock and Irene had to sit through Mary listening to people’s problems, sorting them out. This irritated Sherlock greatly, because he kept firing off deductions he’d made from what they were saying and their appearance if he was able to see them. Sherlock wasn’t too confident with them at first, but his assumptions turned out to be true in eighty percent of the cases. But then his foul mood resurfaced when Mary’s sympathies filled the air as she gave out advice to people going through breakups, those who had unreciprocated feelings, and so on.
“You absolutely cannot bear any weapons, she can sense them,” Sherlock told them, getting a chuckle out of Dean.
“Thank you, Severus.” Dumbledore’s voice was firm, and Snape went quiet immediately, though his eyes lingered on Harry malevolently.
“Me too. I also have Percy Jackson somewhere here, and the Chronicles of Carter Kane. Greek and Egyptian mythology respectively. Harry Potter too, naturally, I have five books in russian.”
and into different figurine vessels.”
“You mean Cas. Don’t bother, he’s an angel.”
Now, almost at the Shack, she seemed to be coming to her senses. She whipped her neck around, resting her cheek on Sherlock’s shoulder. Her brother frowned, but didn’t try to shrug her off. He attempted it once and she smacked him.
Greg and the trio parted ways, John leading them to a square nearby where a lot of locals had gathered. There were stands with numerous trades going on -- candle dipping, weaving, skinning dead squirrels, cooking said squirrels…. a wide selection, truly. At a corner of two streets a man holding a beaver stood in front of a makeshift altar, ten people acting as witnesses in what appeared to be a….
Sherlock let his hand fall in frustration, but the man grabbed it and put it on the bed with much more tenderness than necessary.
Dean took the lead and shoved the upper skeleton aside with the scythe, telling Sherlock one could never be sure what was alive and what was not. When Dean’s post-mortem stabbing proved that the bones would indeed not resurrect, they searched the clothes.
“I woke up to y’all gone except for Irene and Cas, so we thought we’d explore the forest,” Dean explained. “Irene read up on the pit, we went there, she slipped. Cas and I tried to get her but the ground crumbled under our feet and we had been falling for like, an hour.”
They went, and Irene closely observed the fabric and colour schemes of the dresses spread out in front of her. They weren’t bad per se, but some of them were in less than ideal condition, old and worn out. Irene’s tiny fashion heart cringed at that, but she won’t criticize it, they were still good dresses and she’ll make do with what they have. A couple adjustments that are quick and efficient will be enough.
Dean was silent for a heartbeat. Sherlock fervently listened to their exchange, hungry for knowledge.
“Not yet,” John brushed him off, smirking.
“OH MY GOD I WAS RIGHT! GREG, PAY UP!”
. As they passed a giant potted tree was propped up on a metallic table that was covered in dirt, fertilized soil, and bark chunks, one of the thin alloy legs gave out and sent the tree falling. Weren’t it for John’s fast reflexes, the tree would’ve squashed Mrs Hudson to the ground. He jumped between the upkeeper and the offensive overgrown plant and hissed as the twigs dug into his arms; it’ll leave minor scratches. He maneuvered the tree out of the pathway, huffing at its weight.
“What Rift?”
“Uh… Have I told you you have a mesmerising smile?”
“Maybe, but you’re still a little bitch,” John mused, drawing Cage’s attention to him and Sherlock. A lightning struck outside, the light flicking brighter and then darker and Sherlock registered a faint outline of a shadow behind Cas. A second lighting later the shadow became bigger and for the first time ever Sherlock caught a glance of Castiel’s wings. Oh.
. Irene’s inner fashion police fainted at the sight of him and she had to blink to regain her composure.
“Damn. Never mind, but thank you.”
“Neither did I. But if it is tied to You-Know-Who, it must be interesting. The man wasn’t powerful because of Zonko’s little tricks, after all - it has to contain strong magic. We have to go to the library!”
(See the end of the chapter for
She shuffled down from the attic room onto the second storey of the house where the bathroom was. The Shack was quiet, eerily so. Over the few days that they were here she got used to the static and orderly footsteps on the creaky floors and stairs, but it was almost like the house was fully empty.
Irene dropped to her knees and snuck under the porch, her skin registering the cool air immediately, relief washing over her from standing out in the sun. It was not even lunch and it was scorching hot already. Kate followed and they crawled to the back until they could shift on their butts and slide into Jake’s pocket dimension.
special thanks to bee, dee, and mah lipsticks
The Shack quietened gradually, the clutter of dishes passing as the boys cleaned up, the dog paws coming to a halt as Redbeard cuddled closer to his mom, the exception being Greg and his plate full of food. The metal scraped against blue ceramic, poking at the comfortable bubble of silence lazily stretching above them.
Special thanks to Bee and Dee who sent me Marauders memes that helped ease some of my nausea
“Watson! We thought the Queen prohibited you from leaving the Shack or something,” a chubby boy named Mike Stamford grinned, leaning on the minivan. The vehicle belonged to his mom.
Irene looked at Kate, whose jaw dropped. “
Mary hummed, not really believing it. Something told her that those two pages were somehow significant. “I’ll look into it.”
Everything was melting. Candles that weren’t lit melted. Ice cream, naturally, melted. But no, it wasn’t only stationary objects that were prone to disintegration that succumbed to this ungodly heat. Cheap wallpaper on the walls rolled in on itself, water inside pipes and plumbing boiled, and even Cas, in spite of his grace granting him a shield from nasty human perks and needs, started sweating.
“I never cause brawls,” Lestrade said, shoving hands in his pockets. They all knew that was a lie. He was never in the centre of it, but certainly behind the scenes of the fights. “Fine, whatever. I never intended to, you know. It’s family time with John and Sherlock today, anyway.”
As a matter of fact, he sat on the floor surrounded by letters from John in which he reacted and responded to Sherlock’s own inquiries and stories from this dull time fo the year. Sherlock for sure didn’t anticipate that he would miss the other boy’s presence as much as he did. Not that he would
"No-no, don't worry about us!" Hermione interrupted, not wanting to cause trouble or draw attention to any of them. It was too bad already, she didn't want their help to be in danger right now. "We got here just fine, going back will be a breeze. Right, boys?"
The sky was bright orange on the horizon, slowly setting down so that night could take over the reins of the little town. John stopped the cart on top of a hill so they could all take a moment to take a short mental rest to process what had just happened. Their adventure seemed to be over.
I added some stuff to this chapter today as I revised it, it's 9am, apologies for any typos (feel free to piint them out)
“Enough, Alastor,” Dumbledore said, his tone suggesting he shouldn’t finish his sentence. Harry next to Blake stirred.
“What does ‘pining’ mean?”
“No,” Sherlock groaned. “Don’t even start. You and Mummy talked, haven’t you?
“Sherlock, can you give me the tea we packed? It’s getting hotter,” John grumbled, rolling up the sleeves of his yellow shirt, exposing his forearms. As he turned to get it from Sherlock something sticky smudged across his cheek and chin. “What --”
“Uh, I mean, I could help?” John said, shrugging. He tried not to let the pang of rejection show on his face. Damn, he shouldn’t have suggested that. He got carried away. “If you don’t want me tagging along, that’s fine, I get that. We don’t know each other that well, in the end and…”
“Ew, the universe hates me,” Irene cringed, hiding her face in her hands. Sherlock laughed at the timing, Kate falling from her chair to save face of a hard working employee.
They parted ways, Dean gushing about his car already before they even left the house. At least he found a similar enthusiast to talk to about it. Sam backtracked to the kitchen, only to be ambushed by Cas.
“You overestimate your comprehension of the supernatural in this town, Miss Morstan. But then again, you’re not the one to take hints.”
Take care,
Donna shrugged. “She does that when she feels like it.”
. Such an offensive term, and yet she couldn’t do shit about it.
Irene held a little plastic spoon and dug into her ice cream. She offered Dean a bite, so he tasted the mango one to be polite, but it wasn’t exactly to his liking. It was alright, but nothing spectacular. He was more of a cookie guy himself.
“You alright?” John asked once he came closer into his personal space. Sherlock jerked his chin in agreement, mind racing. What did the journal say about vampires? Usually the mainstream knowledge applied -- stake through the heart, Holy water (unfortunately Irene couldn’t provide that through her religious delirium), and… Damn, what else? Why was his mind so patchy today?
“These are colourful,” Sherlock said, his curiosity piqued. “And some pairs aren’t even identical.”
Before he could reply, the volume on the TV went up considerably, the decibels bouncing off the walls, startling them in their seats. John scrambled for the remote to turn it down to tolerable levels.
“Thank you, Greg. Are you sure you will manage?”
“What do you mean?” Irene frowned. There wasn’t anything bad between John and Sherlock as far as she was aware.
“I waited all summer for this,” said the older boy, possibly a fourth year. John vaguely recognised him. “Do you think you’re that smart? To just sneak around and frame people for stealing? I think not.”
Irene and the rest got up, but before Sherlock could scurry off, John grabbed him by the elbow. “No, you’re not slithering out. You’re helping me wash the dishes.”
“That’s because he was ginger like a fox in cartoons,” Sherlock smiled, and John was glad to see it. Grace climbed into his lap, apparently liking John enough to use him as a bed. He petted her belly, and she repositioned herself to seek out the comforting touch. John settled on circular motions and she seemed content. Sherlock laughed at the next sentence. “His name was Mycroft. And the summer before last he tried to grow out a beard, hence the nickname.”
Irene jogged around the Shack, but both John and Greg declined. Greg was finishing up a tour, directing the tourists to the gift shop where John patiently waited at the cash register, ready to brush up on his skills as a scammer. He asked her whether she’d seen Sherlock, but unfortunately, it seemed like the genius hid in the shadows. Or he was taking a nap. It took Irene ten whole minutes to locate him in the attic, where he artfully and compactfully slotted himself under his bed, poking at dead spiders in the corner. She gave up on the why, opting instead to just inquire whether he’d like some proper tea.
Greg plopped down on the soft cushions, groaning from the relief of his back having a support in the softness. Irene occupied his armchair, so he could lay down and slouch like the lazy sloth he was. He laughed at how Irene commented on the boys. “Ah, that’s young love. At least they’re happy and are finally together.”
“They are, aren’t they?” He nudged her in the ribs good-naturedly. As much as he hated to admit it, she was probably the only person who could make him relax and calm down. Not that he would ever voice it. There was no need for that, Irene was vain as a peacock (and him too, occasionally) and there was no need to add fuel to her ego.
“Because memes! Gen Z culture and shit like that, you know? Didn’t Irene ever show you?”
"What's an x-ray?" Sherlock asked, not looking up from his potion.
They both nodded and Irene outstretched her hand, telling John and Sherlock to do the same. The two put theirs atop hers as Sherlock, looking from John to Irene, said, “Just the three of us against the rest of the world!”
“Yep! How are you? Seeing you come out of the gym, have you taken up boxing?” he asked airily as his pleasant persona slipped into its place.
“I’m figuring it out,” Billy said. He was crouching behind Wilkes, tinkering with the sound board and settings on the digital panel. “Gimme a few minutes and we’ll be ready for a proper PARTY!”
When he looked back at his cauldron, he frowned. It wasn’t exactly red like Sherlock’s, it was more of a sunset orange. “But I did everything like you!”
“No, I’m pretty durable,” the reflection said, knocking on the frame. “Takes more than a ‘five to get me. Now come one! You’ve come so far, dude!”
“I don’t need sleep. Besides, I think I slept enough as it is in the sanctuary.”
“I’d be bothered too. It makes us look like Jehova’s witnesses.”
Well, this was awkward. John held Mycroft’s gaze as the older boy observed him, his lips curled in a sly smile.
“You never asked,” Greg shrugged, leaning back in his chair. “But long story short, it was in Texas, and I would’ve won if it weren’t for this Florida man who put even David Bowie to shame by how much glitter he put on.”
In the safety of his apartment he took off his shades, tossed his car keys wherever fate desired it and collapsed on the living room sofa. He shielded his eyes in the crook of his arm and sighed. He hated waiting but patience was his greatest weapon at this stage.
On their left shy of the grandfather clock was a door slightly ajar. It was masked by the old wallpaper that covered it for so long and well that the impression wasn’t visible much. Only now were there cuts and tears where the door was pushed open around its edges and length.
“Yes?” Sherlock’s own eyebrows knitted together into a frown.
“But my brother is!”
“Please, there’s nothing I haven’t seen before on myself.”
They walked into History of Magic classroom where they were welcomed by the sobs of a Slytherin girl. Her friend from Hufflepuff who held her around the shoulders tried to cheer her up.
words: 5423
“You know her?”
“If you don’t mind saying, that is,” he added somewhat awkwardly. He took a sip from his glass -- it was too small for his large hands. “I don’t want to upset you. I know that thinking of past events can bring up some unpleasant memories you’d rather forget.”
“Very much.”
“Correct. I don’t know what triggered it.”
child who was wearing the same jumper as Rosie!”
And with that, Irene graciously turned her back to them, draped a thin blanket over her legs, and switched her lamp off, promptly falling asleep. John chuckled and scrambled to his feet. They were dismissed. And he didn’t want to test Irene’s temper while she had cramps. He’d given her a pill for the pain, so it should have started working.
The shining full moon outside was so bright that they didn't need to use lightning of any sort to get by. Sherlock examined the shelves with the utmost interest, fingers trailing backs of books ever so tenderly. John, on the other hand, nervously hung around, ears pierced for any sound that would indicate they were discovered.
Blake did as he was told, and Dumbledore put the Sorting Hat atop his combed hair. And then, as Dumbledore took a step back, patiently waiting, Blake heard a voice.
Cas’ eyes gazed at the constellations above, the ones he made and named, others he named this present moment to himself, just for fun. He loved this aspect of being on Earth -- seeing God’s work, no matter how sour he felt about the creator.
“First Ron, then you,” he heard an angry voice say. “
This fic will be huge, I am not gonna lie. But that’s what makes it fun and exciting. Feel free to join the ride!
“Hey, I have to go, sorry to cut it short,” Florida said at that moment, checking his Apple Watch. Hateful invention. Greg hated most of today’s technology. He didn’t trust anything made after 2005, especially printers. Vile fuckers. He usually checked the phones he got and installed some of his own upgrades that made him pretty much invisible to the government. “Gotta bounce, I have an appointment with my attorney in five minutes.”
“No, it’s hot as balls,” John said, sitting up. He arched an eyebrow at Sherlock. “Tell me, why do you dress in a flannel t-shirt and long pyjama bottoms?”
Irene bid the dolls a goodbye and scrambled out of the pocket universe. She listened intently for a few minutes before deciding that no one stood above her on the wooden parquets. She slithered out, stood up, and dusted off her shorts and t-shirt. All was well. Until Kate’s voice reached her ears.
“We’re seeing him tomorrow, bugger,” John said, plopping down on his chair as he went through the letters again.
I also apologise to any hardcore potterheads if they find smt out of the line, I'd like to be more precise if you find smt inaccurate, so let me know, but I also don't have that much time to pinpoint everything in the books to take reference from due to my schedule now, but I will do my best :)
“Alright, Shorty,” Sherlock smirked, ducking away from John who prepared to whack him with an old dirty cloth.
“Tedious.”
“First things first, the timing is important.”
"You're mad," John sighed, coming to a halt at the next corner just behind Sherlock.
“Sorry, Mum doesn’t like it when we eat there,” John said, spreading out the boxes and opening them. Steam lifted off to the ceiling, it was very fresh. “Do you want some coke to go with it?”
“Who are you?” asked him the second vampire, a man with short greasy hair and a tattooed face. “A hunter? Are you with the Winchesters?”
It was now 9:30, and he sat burrowed in his duvet like a gremlin, taking in the forgotten knowledge. There was a very interesting section on aliens and shapeshifters, as well as witchcraft and its folklore in Reichenbach Falls. Witchcraft had, unfortunately, died out with its last witch roughly fifty years ago in the eighties, with no successor known. As such, this passage was therefore useless, with the exception of the time frame - that had given Sherlock an estimation of sorts of how old the author could be or was, but it held no value if he didn’t know when they went missing.
“Ridiculous,” Sherlock said, but the blush was unmistakable. He settled on his side, head propped on his fist and gazing into John’s eyes. “But if I’m a Prince I suppose that either makes you my righteous Knight or a King.”
*gasp* IT HIM!
“To be frank, all the evidence the professors had found under your bed suggests otherwise,” Sherlock said dryly. He stood more firmly on his feet. “So please, don’t kid yourself. Why would you have the need to steal, though? That is still unclear, but not terribly.”
John looked over his shoulder at Sherlock, brows furrowed. There was an adorable crinkle that made his confusion all the more cute. “What do you mean?”
And, having only three people at the Shack -- the dogs wanted a trip, so Greg put them on leashes and took them to Hudders’ place -- a small incident happened.
T̶h̷i̶n̸k̸ ̶o̸f̶ ̶i̵t̶ ̷a̵s̷ ̸a̷n̴ ̷i̴n̶v̶e̸s̶t̸m̸e̶n̴t̷ ̷f̵o̵r̸ ̷t̴h̴e̴ ̷f̸u̸t̴u̶r̷e̵,̸ ̶C̸a̶s̶
John sighed. He swinged his back over his shoulder and made for the doors. Once outside the Great Hall, a hand seized his arm and an out-of-breath Greg appeared.
“‘Course I do. You’re important to me, why wouldn’t I know? I practically knew you like the back of my hand since you were four.”
“Git. Greg, open it!”
He kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock as he placed his hands in John’s open palms. The merfolk’s skin was colder to touch than a land dweller’s - a quality John came to perceive as normal once Sherlock was stabilised. Sherlock tilted his head to the left a trifle, prompting John to initiate the next step. Which was a literal step.
“So he’s the innocent kind of angel,” Kate concluded thoughtfully, leaning her elbows on the glass casing of the adjacent desk. “How old are you, Cas?”
“Oh! Can we have a sleepover?” Molly looked hopeful. Then she gasped, realising how it must’ve sounded, blushing furiously. “Sorry, ehm… We just really like you, you’re cool! And British! And I said that already… Uhm, but…”
Greg blinked, and an almost irrational sense of happiness filled his whole being. He could jump over the fence like a newborn foal and call it a day, die, and rest in peace in Valhalla. He let himself laugh and pulled John into a bear hug. “Finally! Jesus Christ, John. It’s taken you
Sherlock is elated, but he is restless. He goes out to the mall, where a badass called Anthea provides boxing training. He may join a competition eventually, too, who knows? In the meantime, Irene helps Mrs Hudson get a date. It’s matchmaking time! On the other hand, Sherlock is a little insecure whether John really is interested in him enough to go on a date with him, because… no one ever did, why should this be any different?
They weren’t holding hands, but Irene had no need to do so as of now. What she needed to do was examine Normandy’s nail polish - it was magnificent. Before she could take action herself, though, Normandy beat her to it.
“I checked before we left; she’s ready to go. Seems like the Rift powered our trips and simultaneously managed to give her enough power to travel.”
“That’s the wrath of Gordon Ramsay,” John deadpanned and Sherlock smirked, depositing his stature to the table, plopping down dramatically. He fleetingly glanced at John, the softness in his eyes betraying his put-up front of grumpiness. John waved at him from where he stood by the counter and got to making him toast. “Also, you should stop smoking, Greg. Those things’ll kill you. You’re already out of breath after walking up the stairs.”
"Yeah, does it bother you? I thought we might be friends."
“Will do! Should we watch High School Musical 2 or a Disney movie?”
George Holmes was a busy man, but he made sure to be there for his sons during the holidays. At least the shorter ones. He oftentimes read bedtime stories to the boys when they were children, and he indulged them in their hobbies. And while Sherlock’s were a bit more cryptic than Mycroft’s, that still didn’t stop their father from taking interest. He was, after all, the first to take Sherlock out take samples of… whatever it was for his ‘experiments’. Mycroft didn’t see much sense in it, but it made Sherlock happy. So why rain on his parade?
“I’m too tired and lazy to stand up. Carry me?”
“I was awoken by the sound of mockery,” Greg yawned, head bumping on the doorframe. Then, as if struck by lighting, he came to life, energetically clapping and saying, “Where is it? Show me the object of ridicule!”
“Which reminds me we’ve got to shop for clothes,” Sherlock said. “I have no idea how their clothes changed with Irene and Sam, but it’s the only clothes they have for their size. And one outfit to wear in summer heat is not substantial.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he said that, his mouth clapping shut with an audible
Into battle!
“I… Gimme a second, I’ve got to remember…. Myrtle… Warr..en? Yeah, Warren, or something,” he said, shrugging. Sherlock huffed, but stayed silent as not to interrupt Greg’s storytelling. “Okay. So she was killed, OH - and she was a muggleborn, I think.”
“Hm, wouldn’t be so sure about that. You do tend to doze off more, love.”
Her response was almost immediate.
“What?”
He caught up with Irene; she’s been pacing back and forth trying to see anything relevant from the top. The cemetery lot was vast, but its flora coverage made it look more wild and fuller, if a little packed.
Endless falling. It got boring after fifty suspenseful, uneventful minutes. Dean would tap his foot or pat some flat surface in front of him instead of staring into blank space, but he was robbed of it, and it made him stim. At least he got his bracelets and rings, which helped to keep him occupied and stimulated in this weird limbo experience. Even though the pit was dark and ever-expanding, irony made it seem suffocating and claustrophobic.
Special thanks to Bee and Dee, who coincidentally got Lucifer's waterfalls at around the same time as me. Fun-not-fun. Also TMI.
John avoided getting his face licked by the dogs, wary of the fact that they had been vaccinated only yesterday. Honestly, Sherlock could be reckless, but this took a new spin on it. Not that John was mad, just… flabbergasted. He’s holding onto his promise to wait until Sherlock washes his face. No dog saliva for him, thank you very much.
One such recommended literature dealt with the settlement and origins of Reichenbach Falls. It all started as a lonely outpost for missionaries and travellers and merchants, which helped develop local infrastructure. The native people were friendly and welcoming for as long as they were able to. Unfortunately, Balexander O’Leary, the famous first mayor of this town, imposed laws and rules that played a big role in pushing back the natives’ human rights. In other words it was as vile as the rest of the US history when it came to settlements and many more. O’Leary’s achievements were described for the better length of the book after this, and Sam let it slide out of his hands as another chronicle found its way to him. Nothing exceptional had revealed itself to him, though he found small scribings about certain unrevealed excavation sites on the outskirts of town, but there were no names or coordinations written to give them even the slightest lead. Maybe in another chronicle or history book. Sam made a mental note to check in with the rest and to dig up information on the aforementioned cave systems, no pun intended. Apparently certain sites were also caved in and proclaimed dangerous to the public.
Bemusement dissolved into giggles as he and Irene enjoyed the vine reference whilst Cas and Dean frowned, utterly lost in this century’s youth.
“Hey -- you okay?” John asked, huffing as he seated himself next to his boyfriend’s sister. Not the best starter sentence.
There were little notes available to explain this particular phenomenon in the journal. The authors had written down the symbols and colours in a column on the left and speculations about the silver lining on the right side. Nothing else.
A nod.
"No I just pretended. I observed people in the library."
“Kate’s right, you’re a tiny guy compared to Sherlock,” Irene nodded, poking John in the shoulder. He put on a poker face, staring into the abyss as both girls picked on him.
“Excellent! Be there at seven P.M. sharp,” she instructed, her heels clicking against the floor. She waved at Sherlock and Irene, though detached. “It was nice meeting you! Hope you enjoy the rest of your summer here.”
The crowd held their breath awaiting their every move. But before they could curse each other off, a chilling voice from behind the mass of people told them off.
“You must be Sherlock, right?” he had said earlier today. Setting his sight on Sherlock while the other boy wasn't paying attention to him was one thing, but the moment their eyes connected… Man, that was a whole another experience.
long time,” Lala explained, her blue wings fluttering. Irene was aware she must’ve been wearing a bewildered look on her face, but none of them addressed it. “And we lack the guidance of someone old and wise.”
Irene got to her knees and grabbed a stick. She put it under the scrutiny of the magenta beam and watched as the stick elongated endlessly, and continued even after the far end expanded beyond the border of the light until it cracked in two from the added weight. “Kinda like Pinoccio’s nose, don’t you think?”
“Sounds good to me,” Donna said, mouth full, putting the popcorn box on a worn-out greyish seat.
. Don’t omit a single bit of information. Be as specific as you can.”
“Jesus, that’s a big fish,” Dean said, appearing next to Sam. The enchanted scythe glistened and reflected the sun, and he handed Sam a knife to be even. “She got Irene?”
“Fifteen years. My biological father died when I was eight months old. Don’t say sorry, I never knew him. Irene’s father raised me like his own. He’s the one I call dad.”
Sherlock blinked, a faint blush climbing up the length of his neck. He cleared his throat and walked up to John. “How do we get to the other side, then?”
“Yeah, we could do that experiment where you try to deduce what flavours I like by looking at me looking at ice cream,” John grinned, closing the window. Sherlock sat up, excited.
“Sure, but that’s all muscle. Pick it up, I’ll make sure Irene won’t blow your cover.”
Donovan nodded silently, her head tuning to the side to observe two men stepping out of a beautiful car Sherlock recognised to be an Impala. His mom liked the car rather a lot, and she even had one back in England when she was young.
“Yes, it would seem so.”
special thanks to bee, dee, and the crazy peeps of Smosh
Greg knelt back on the balls of his feet and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. Fuck, he was getting old. His back hurt like hell from the frequent bending over and whatnot. He stood up, tossing the hammer in its kit, wincing at the loud sound. He walked back to the observation room and collapsed in the chair there, grabbing a water bottle. Looking at the portal from here, he had to admire his creativity. Having only one third of the blueprints proved to be a pain in the ass when it came to building it from scratch, but he managed to teach himself enough maths and physics bullshit to understand and develop the rest to how it approximately looked like before and completed. He deeply regretted his inattentiveness to the matter when he, his husband, and their friend first started this. True, back then he was more the muscle of the operation than the brain, but he learned a trick or two. And now it was only him, his other friend going insane months prior. He’d left the project years ago, but the recent tragedy was a blow nonetheless.
“Relax, we’ll find a way,” John said, leaning on his arm he put behind Sherlock’s back. If Sherlock didn’t know better, he’d think John sniffed the scent coming off him from his shampoo.
the end is nigh, but the adventure is only beginning!
“Hm. To tell the truth, I wouldn’t mind.”
“Obviously.”
“I did, why?”
“That’s…. Sappy,” Irene smiled, bumping him in the shoulder. “All that love is getting to your head.”
“No matter,” Sherlock shrugged, arching one eyebrow. “Irene and I are nineteen. We study in Toronto.”
“Fine. So. Jesus, alright, I’m an idiot -- but is it lavender that you wash your hair with?”
John shifted weight from one leg to another, dipping his head to his palette, then at Sherlock. “I said that we should get cleaned up, not that we will.”
Cas shrugged. “For masochists, maybe. But if an angel possesses a vessel, then their true form is subdued, though the wings are ever-present. You can sense their presence if you focus, but they should be invisible to you.”
. You’re jealous of the dog.”
Sam is obviously disgruntled and sighs in aggravation. He fixes the camera with a soulless stare and we can see him reconsider time travelling in TARDIS and joining Azazel and eternally deleting Heaven in point three seconds. However, that wasn’t exactly available, so he has to roll with it.
“No, I think that the OTP is called a ship, right? Because it sails…?”
“Mycroft Holmes,” the man presented himself smoothly, shaking Mrs. Watson’s hand. “Pardon Sherlock’s fussiness, he’s a little grumpy because Mummy didn’t allow him to take Redbeard with him.”
“You’ve been parked in TV shows while the Watson-Holmes pair and I talked like grownups,” he said, a levitating tray full of coffee and tea following him towards them.
Greg stared at her, and Mary was sure a number of thoughts passed his mind that weren’t the friendliest. “
"Anything but the green snakes," he said, shivering. "Not during the war now for sure... What about you?"
Sherlock watched her inch closer, and he saw her tail wag. A good sign, in his opinion. He tried to minimise himself; in times like these, he became hyper aware of his height and tried to mentally shrink so as not to seem too threatening. It worked, and the mother padded closer. It didn’t escape him that she slightly favoured her right hind leg over her left.
“WHAT THE FUCK-” he hollered, legs bucking backwards, stumbling. Greg had to grip the doorframe not to fall, gasping for air.
“That was….” Greg began, eyebrows hitching up, “.... something. Pretty good, too.”
Sherlock ignored him for the sake of his food, and John made it a  point to bring him some fresh water. Keeping the merfolk hydrated was essential. So far, Sherlock seemed to be adjusting just fine to the land, but John feared what obstacles might arise as they go on. What if someone is looking for Sherlock? Is he important? The next International station from where he could send a message was two weeks away, which could be two weeks too late if politics are involved. Welp. He will talk to Sherlock about it later.
“Go, go, GO!” Irene urged John, but he already hit the gas and they darted off, narrowly escaping a fist that would have smashed the golf cart into mere metal pieces.
Greg was dozing on the bed, limbs akimbo and his snoring disturbing his airways. He was still out of it.
“Obviously,” Sherlock said at the same time as John.
“Come in!” he had said, thinking it was Greg who caught a wind of him. Instead, he had found himself facing a short, cute girl with long dark hair woven in a fish tail. Dark blue eyes locked on his, just as piercing as Sherlock’s. “Oh, you’re Irene, then!”
“That was… I expected everything, but not… Did it say
“What? No!” John said, blinking at Mrs Hudson. His family energy was as chaotic as Sam and Dean’s, but held less death count. Mrs Hudson went over to the stove. “No circus guy was here. Gerta just… appeared. She barged into the house uninvited and made herself welcome. She’s not bad, just stubborn.”
Poor guy. Maybe they should’ve left him a note…. but wait, was that a sticky note on his forehead? “Cas, what is that?” she nodded at the paper that escaped his notice.
“Okay,” Greg said simply.
“Uh, Winchester,” John supplied, trying to play it cool. Sherlock guessed he made the connection purely from his associations with the Winchester brothers, since angels normally do not possess last names.
"Last time you said it we ended up being escorted from the National Museum," John reminded him.
“They’ll have a bath once we’re at the Shack.”
“I’m not!”

ever explained things properly. On occasion, yes. Crescent Moon would’ve made sense, however…. Greg walked to the window to peek outside. The lawn was sparkling in the beams of the August moon, the air still and suffocating in the heat. He was sweating again, but an inner voice prompted him to move his legs and go out. He shut the door of the gift shop behind him quietly and had a look around the property. Not a soul there. But crawling whispers carried themselves over to his person, lurking and patient in their pursuit.
“You know it, I’ve got that from Sherlock,” John winked, and Irene laughed out loud. As they got on the sidewalk, a glimpse out of the corner of his eye made John flinch. He thought he saw the printed Nicolas Cage picture in the library’s window. Jeez, his imagination was playing tricks on him. But who wouldn’t have mild PTSD after fighting off a maniacal doll who stepped on Mr Rabbiarty in cold blood? Plus, that fucker swung a real-ass katana at his boyfriend. It was personal.
“Ten thousand bucks,” John said, and Irene choked on her drink. She quickly gulped the rest of it and Sherlock sipped on his own. “Yeah, unbelievable. I think some sort of bet was involved. I wasn’t here that day, but Greg had a shit-eating grin on his face for a week after that.”
“Nope.”
John shook his head at his
“Yep.” Lestrade backed up out of the parking spot, then the lot of the mall. “I do like her flowers a lot. She makes the nicest arrangements, you’ll see. But I mostly take the seeds for Hudders to plant since it’s her passion.”
you know that Cas is gonna be reading Ao3 in no time nonstop
“Oh, how I wanted to scream for Gloria, to let her know I was home! When I woke up next, I found myself constrained to this cave. I knew I was dead, but my fury had no effect and I couldn’t break out. For a long time, I couldn’t even have a form like this one. Until now.”
Eventually, Sherlock turned to a page about a particular creature that haunted his dreams when he was a little boy.
So, he sought out a solution in the form of their library. He found a book on potions with a section on aging potions. He learnt that taking a minimal dose of one could technically give his growth sprout a kick in the right direction.
John tuned her out for most of the show. Despite the no-hard-feelings he had, he still felt a bit queasy, seeing her back in the Falls. He did not want to put up with his past right now, not when things were good for once.
-sibling banter, nothing else. I am going downstairs anyway. I need to settle a bet with Mrs Hudson.”
“Yes, it is, but we can’t change that now, can we?” Sherlock said. “What was the name of the student who was expelled?”
“A little,” he conceded, returning her smile, albeit sheepishly. “Humanity’s compassion never ceases to amaze me.”
Pixies? Pixies?! Of the things he had expected, pixies were the last on his list. Actually, they weren’t there. But Sherlock and Irene weren’t prepared for this plot twist either - that was some consolation.
“You don’t know that,” Sally said, glancing at him for a fleeting second before drinking the rest of her martini. “But it’s a nice thought, I’ll give you that.”
“I do have wings,” Cas replied, turning to her. “But human senses are usually too dull to perceive them.”
Sherlock and Cas looked at each other, unsure whether to move or not, but Mrs Hudson’s insistent cough told them to move their asses. She pulled them both into an embrace and then went to sit in the driver’s seat. Greg patted his boys on the back, let Irene depart with a last hug, shook Cas’ hand, and got in the passenger’s seat.
“You are coming with me, like it or not,” John said, flashing him a mock innocent smile. He took his hand and led him downstairs.
“I did, long ago. That was even before the Shack opened. But… let’s say something happened and I couldn’t take care of it anymore. And it wouldn’t really fit the Mystery Shack aesthetic, eh?”
he knocked another skeleton’s head off like baseball.
John scanned the moist dark walls at either side. He half expected something to jump them at any moment, and Sherlock's commentary didn't ease his anxious mind.
“I like your sarcastic enthusiasm, John.”
“As you shall. You are my most trusted person, you did earn the right to choose your targets. Your sniper skills are handy at social gatherings.”
John choked and dropped his fork as he tried not to suffocate. Sherlock patted his back, hissing in sympathy and then he squinted at Irene. “Really? If you kill him, there’ll be no sex.”
“Yes, the oldest are the four Archangels Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, and Gabriel.”
But apart from that, the castle moved on and Professor McGonagall didn't care it was a time of festivities, she still unloaded essays upon her students like it was raining cats and dogs.
“It does shine through occasionally,” Kate said, scooping Redbeard up in her arms to coddle him. “When he thinks no one’s looking. I think he’s overworking himself to exhaustion sometimes to be able to just turn off and stop wallowing in whatever is going on in that greying head of his. He’s good at hiding it. But he also made it clear that he’s not willing to talk about it yet. Who knows?”
“Sherlock Holmes.”
girl. Huh. Well, at least he knew he certainly wouldn’t willingly go to her stupid show now. But… How and why did they start dating? And when exactly? Not that it really mattered, no…
to fool guys like
“The champion for Beauxbatons,” Dumbledore said, clearing his throat before the lingering excited chatter died down, “is Fleur Delacour.”
The atmosphere got a little tense, but after assuring the step-siblings everything was alright, it eased significantly. Sherlock stayed silent for a while longer, turning the new facts in his head.
So, Gloria Scott, eh? I borrowed a bit of her lore from ACD canon, though obviously adjusted it as it fit, but more of that later... Poor Henry is right and only four people are aware...
“Well, okay. Sherlock didn’t say that outloud. In fact, he wasn’t very talkative at all. But I have a feeling. In my guts. You know how idioms go.”
He took off as he was saying it, gaining a few meters on Sherlock. The lanky bastard was fast, however, and caught up with John easily enough. What Sherlock didn’t know, though, was that John had taken up jogging during his university year, and had both the stamina and leg muscles to keep up with him.
Irene burst out laughing, and not long after so did Sherlock. It earned them quite a few glances of confusion, but who cared? They started walking around the funfair, elbow to elbow. Banters like these felt good. Light-hearted enough not to be taken seriously, and Sherlock could invent new insults tailored specially for Irene that weren’t too harsh for his tastes. He never minded her crude usage of the typical British curses; they sounded funny coming from her and she didn’t overdo it.
Sherlock inspected the metal balconies above. Fortunately, the ladder leading to the first floor was let down. Easy job, then. A bit disappointing. He really hoped the theatre was infested by blood-sucking vampires now, just for the excitement and adrenaline rush.
“So, what exactly happened today?” he asked, hugging his right leg. He shuffled closer to Sherlock so that he could see the journal better. Sherlock coughed into his fist, adjusting his position a little and then he got to explaining. How Sherlock found it, that its author is unknown and either dead or missing (not exactly a calming piece of information). There were other creatures documented besides pixies or vampires, but the journal was unfinished. It cut off approximately halfway through with a cryptic message saying that the author was discovered.
“Can’t.”
But regaining it so aggressively has had a slightly deteriorating effect on him, even though he loathed to admit it to himself. Simply put, he had no clue what to do, or how useful he was to the Winchesters or his hosts. He liked to think that he did fairly well on that night when Nicolas Cage tried for on his third occasion to wipe John, Sherlock, and Irene out, but in the end the house sustained collateral damage and they had to repair it on short notice so that John’s uncle wouldn’t be angry. Even if it came to it, Cas would likely come clear, it would be reasonable.
Well, there goes the first chapter of episode 1, Pixie Cut! Another update is coming on the 5th, so if you liked this premise, do come back, there are more shenanigans awaiting :)
“Yes, they take care of injuries. What do muggles have?”
“Irrelevant.”
“Hard to say,” Cas said, smelling his crumpled shirt. “A long time.”
“You called?” said the girl, scaring the ever living shit out of them. “Sorry. So, what about me?”
“Another lake dunk?” John asked, wiping sweat off his brow. He sat back on the heels of his feet, feeling his swimming trunks cling to the skin of his thighs and groin uncomfortably. “I’m sweating bullets.”
“I’m afraid you’ll have to walk the plank,” Sherlock sighed dramatically, lying flat on his back by a way of fainting.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh yeah. Still no idea how you got there?”
So, here he was, walking himself into oblivion because of his dislike for public places. John, Irene, and Mrs Hudson went in, all needing to shop for groceries or other useless products. They wouldn’t talk him into entering that hellish box even if it was the last thing on earth to save him from the inevitable doom going by the name of boredom.
“Ah, Doctor Watson’s orders, you know the drill,” Greg smiled fondly. “It’s not so bad. I can write tax pay-off and evasions all I want that way and I don’t waste my time during the day, so I can take on more tours.”
"Yes," John said, sitting down next to him in the library - the normal, student-friendly section.
allowed to do that now, wasn’t he? Someone had to appreciate the view and how the denim hugged John’s thighs and his butt.
“Will you help us find the truth?” Cas asked, wrangling his hands.
“Poor guy. Is it bad?”
Greg spoke as John opened his mouth to undoubtedly speak on the contrary, beating him to it. Despite his occasional exasperation with Sherlock and his mould experiments, he wouldn’t stand this form of ostracizing. Sherlock barely huffed at the name. “He’s
He shot forward, grabbing the hound by her neck, nails digging into the rotten, burned and flaming flesh -- it caused him no pain nor injury, unlike his iron grip on her. The hound rasped as he pressed the edge of the knife to her throat, drawing a few drops of pitch black blood that highly contrasted with the polished marble-looking sharp tool.
"I've heard what 'deductions' or whatever you call it he made - make sure you won't regret this friendship. Oh, also dinner's ready."
He cleared his throat before he spoke into the stream of his walkie-talkie. “Hey. It’s me, Greg.”
He sent Henry to deliver the message and waited. Ten minutes later, he heard John stumbling down the stairs, hair dishevelled and eyes almost closed. He had Henry perched on his forearm, intending to let him fly outside the Gryffindor Common Room.
Irene leaned on the railing of the stairs platform that descended to the dance floor below. The lights were dimmed and turned purple and pink, several decorations she and Kate hung up reflecting the light on the walls and floor. Mrs Hudson operated the DJ set, headphones on, shades shielding her eyes.
“That’s in half an hour,” Irene looked at her wrist watch, brows furrowing as she made out the tiny handles of the clock. It should be shameful how she had trouble telling time from classical wrist watches, but who could blame her? And especially in an age where the world was becoming more and more digitalised! Telling time the traditional way required effort she didn’t bother sparing it. “Sure you don’t want that cuppa?”
“But John,” Sherlock said, his silver eyes resting on John’s. “How can we know for sure if we don’t try it? It’s an experiment!”
“I suppose,” Cas replied, kneeling when Irene came up to them. He discovered that she liked to give hugs a lot, especially him or Sherlock. It was awkward at first, her hugs being more of a death grip, but he got used to it. Hugs from Irene were nice. He could get used to them. Now, however, she presented him with Barbie’s corpse. Cas was told by Dean and John that you sometimes have to act surprised with children and possibly feign interest so that they don’t get discouraged or feel unheard, so he figured it was one of those times. “Oh, what’s this?”
“Me too,” Sherlock mumbled in John’s ear, sending shivers down his spine. “Terribly.”
And this made the connection between the puppy and Mycroft uplifting and sad simultaneously. Did it mean that, by giving the puppy the name of Redbeard, Sherlock allowed a suppressed part of himself to be brought to the surface again? Did it mean that he let himself be free of the past, letting go? Or is he merely clinging to it? Whatever the answer may be, Irene will let it simmer and see for herself. She’ll keep an eye out for her brother, in case he finds himself in a vulnerable position when recollection of memories strikes him at a yet unknown moment.
"He didn’t mean biscuits," John said, laughing. "She’ll pack you a whole dinner for you all, I bet."
She waddled to the built-in closet left of the door and scoured through her belongings. Mrs Hudson took care of the laundry, or John, so she had plenty of clothes washed and ready to put on. She decided to wear her short-sleeved grey t-shirt that had a tiny fanart of grumpy Karkat Vantas on it. On days like these, she sympathised with the troll. She was exhausted from every supernatural bullshit targeted at her.
“A flag!”
Their stomachs grumbled, asking to be fed. John tugged Sherlock to stand up and together they had breakfast accompanied by Lestrade and the dogs. Sam was up and about, reading the local newspapers. Sherlock asked for the page where Anderson’s column was written -- his guilty pleasure, he took delight in that man’s stupidity and flawed journalism -- while John made small talk with the rest and prepared breakfast.
“No, if he were, he would’ve known Sherlock likes him from the get-go and we wouldn’t have to facepalm continuously for two weeks.”
“And what if this,” he gestured vaguely to convey everything, “ends up being worse than we think? You’d likely be forced back whether you like it or not. Trust me, I know what it’s like to have a shitty family, but if my sister turned up with partial amnesia, I’d help her. Cas might be in danger, Gabe. He needs our help.”
Speaking of which, this merfolk was fascinating. John hadn’t seen one in years, and even that memory wasn’t that clear or merry to think of. But Sherlock…. His calm took John aback. He expected him to trash and attack on sight, but none of that happened. Maybe that could change if Sherlock felt threatened, but so far he was good. And helpless. So John stepped up to provide. And nothing made him happier than his ability to use sign language like this. He thanked his younger self for diligently practising it nightly for then no discernible reason.
“Oh, really?” Cage spat, jogging towards a window, his jump allowing him to pull the knob and open it. “
“Just pet his snout once, he won’t bite,” Sherlock nudged the lizard closer, the animal oblivious to the stress it was causing the wizard boy.
The young, not-so-bright children gasped and reached deep into their pockets to deposit them into the piggy bank. Greg held it out for them, casting sideway glances at the parents buying merch in the gift shop. It was only illegal once someone noticed. Plus, the parents had overrated ideas about their offspring’s intelligence. That meant mo’ money, mo’ profit! And also better retirement.
She swam closer to the floatie until she could rest an elbow on it. “Wow!” she grinned, hoping to be as good looking as she imagined. “Oh my gosh, how crazy seeing you here even though we don’t know one another!”
So it is decided.
“So, what do we do now?” John said, appearing next to him.
“Call Sam. Tell him what happened and ask him if they’re still at Martha’s.”
“You can buy more dog food if you’d stop by at Lilly’s,” Lestrade said, petting Redbeard in his arms. “We’re running out. Maybe buy them treats. Gotta bribe this little guy to train him properly.”
stay tuned for the 30th!
“You have to stay. We’ll go on a walk later, okay? I’ll get you some dog treats.”
Greg’s right eyebrow shot up and down as he shrugged and took out a second cup. Martha swatted his bicep with the spatula. “You promised John you’d cut on caffeine,” she reminded him sternly.
A few ear-piercing shrieks later the hallway was cleared of any giggles and stalkers, although Peeves remained. He made fun of Blake and Cedric as they rushed back downstairs by a slightly altered route that involved the latter to practically drag Blake out of the confines of the castle out on fresh air faster than anyone could've registered.
Professor Trelawney greeted them uncharacteristically and grimly. To an extent it reminded John of BBC sketches, but he couldn’t laugh in class. The room smelled of incense, and a fellow Gryffindor muggleborn classmate almost got an asthma attack and had to sit by the window.
He must be referring to his back. Ah, that’s a story… Sherlock had been thrown around rather a lot, unfortunately, namely due to his unwilling capture, but he couldn’t give this man explicit details if he didn’t understand signs! The man must have interpreted his silence as reluctance to talk about it, for his hand came to rest on Sherlock’s forehead one more time before he stood up.
episode 10, chapter 5
“What’s cookin’ today, folks?” Dean clasped his hands together inside. The dogs were roaming the house, already fed.
“Oh, don’t blame Dumbledore, Karkaroff,” said Professor Snape suddenly with an air of softness. “Potter’s rather determined to break rules, he’s been at it since he arrived here -”
Using every last bit of patience they’d had, they navigated through the web of wires and strings and breathed more easily. But not for long.
When Dean sighed, Sherlock took a deep breath, expecting this to take the wrong turn.
with Sherlock. He was absolutely taken by the young man like a Japanese schoolgirl. Not that there was anything wrong with that.
in which there is a lame funfair
“I changed my name from James Armitage to James Trevor, but someone pointed them in my direction and they jailed me and accused me of stealing and murdering a local businessman. Of course, I didn’t do it, and before they dragged me away I promised my darling Gloria I would come back. I gave her my ring which Hudson helped me acquire for our wedding and she gave me hers, an heirloom after her grandmother which would remind me of her, and I hid it well. It’s a simple ring; her grandmother wasn’t one for fancy jewelry.
He took them out, the pack, being lighter in weight and obeying laws of physics, flew up but the man didn’t notice. Irene clapped her hands, curious to see what Dean would do. He divided the deck into two piles of approximately the same size and tried to shuffle them, but the cards decided they had enough of his nonsense and flew out to his grasp and up above to join the empty pack. Dean stared at his empty hands and then tilted his head upwards.
Dinner was…. an okay affair, as it turned out, but that was mainly thanks to the food. Mrs Hudson was an exceptional cook, and Sherlock couldn’t imagine eating anything else, ever. Lestrade had it good, and Sherlock vowed that if he ever did as much as to criticise the upkeeper, he’d take matters into his own hands.
To avoid the embarrassing moment of silence, John tried to come up with some topic they could talk about.
Little did they know they were wasting their time. The ghoul was long gone on his way for his happy ending, out of evil’s grasp.
“Aren’t you a happy little badger tonight,” John said, biting his lip so as not to break down laughing. The mirth in his eyes was infectious. Sherlock felt a wave of amusement as well. John looked at Sherlock, nodding his head for him to continue.
“Shit, sorry,” she said, realising where they were at the moment.
special thanks to bee, dee, and my grimoire
“Please, Morstan. I have a higher body count in killing than you could ever imagine.”
Everything was peaceful, unlike his mind.
“Says you who ate half my serving,” John said smugly, elbowing him in the ribs. Sherlock dodged the attack, retaliating with the spoon. It clinked against John’s knuckles, and he let out a hissed ‘ouch!’ before he lifted it to his mouth to blow on the hurt skin and bones.
in which the peeps get plushies
“Not funny. Good morning to Cas, and Cas only,” Sam said groggily. Cas gave a reciprocatory reply and off they went.
Cas had an uncanny feeling that his grace won’t be able to do much. This creature was too big an enigma for him to pinpoint despite the two of them battling each other for the past ten minutes. Somewhere in the house could be heard the sound of glass shattering and a howl. Cas tried to sit up, but with a mere snap of his fingers Cage had him pinned anew.
A number of emotions floated through John. Anger, fear, indescribable anxiety thinking about what that would cause, a mixture that resulted into him surging forwards, tackling the impostor to the ground just as the rock almost left his hand. He heard Sherlock saying something, the words too fast for him to comprehend. Slowly, they came back to him, the other Sherlock under him squirming and wrestling for freedom. John grabbed him by the wrists and pinned them above his head. Under different circumstances, this would be thrilling, being to Sherlock so close -- but this wasn’t
smart. Intelligent. Witty,” John started naming, eyes looking to the left and twinkling as he came up with more. “Cutting and sharp. Handsome.”
Where is she? Where is the stroller? Surely kidnappers were more obnoxious and obvious than that, especially in a Tesco setting during the day.
and!! crystals!! borrowed from the original GF episode, but the circumstances and outcome differ ofc >:)
John called after their beloved landlady, voice still raspy with sleep, Sherlock stumbling on the doorframe as he nonverbally called for his wand. They flew down the stairs in a matter of milliseconds, wands ready.
“Have at thee, then,” Irene prompted, and Mike took a baseball from the stall owner, a forty-something bloke with receding hairline and beer belly. He disappeared on the side to allow Mike a full view of the bottle-pyramids constructed for customers to aim at.
“That, Mr Watson,” Sherlock purred, stepping past him with a smirk, “is very true.”
That made her shut up, but she still warned him to be wary around Sherlock.
Irene spared them an argument by snatching the journal from under his nose and putting it under her butt to sit on it. Sherlock looked as though he could murder her on the spot. She fanned her eyelashes at him innocently, reminding Sam of Dean when the latter tried to piss him off or when he ate Sam’s food and acted clueless. Typical siblings.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, confused. “If you’re not skilled at it, why bother?”
. I’ll swallow orchids, but
Events from yesterday’s evening kept resurfacing, breaking out from his Mind Palace and roaming free, messing up his logical and rational side of the brain. He couldn’t help but over-analyse that moment his and John’s eyes met, smiles tender and sincere. And then John asked him out on a date. Like,
“You’re wrong. He knows what he wants.”
“No,” she cut him off, sadly. “No, but you should’ve seen the looks they kept throwing at each other. Greg, I think they’re falling in love.”
“My, aren’t you interested? I know he had a magazine or two on military fashion, but…  You’ll have to find out on your own. Just not in the attic room, mind you.”
John grinned back, tilting his head to the left as he considered it and mentally tried to remember secluded places nearby. There was one. “Deal!”
“Are you feeling okay?” she asked. He wasn’t very confronting about his own emotions, and she suspected that, by the looks of how Heaven operated, angels in general were very emotionally constipated. He could also be lonely. He woke up at a loss of where he was, according to him, and that saddened her.
barked his testimony in court. Grace growled in response from where she was lying.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course you did,” Sherlock grumbled, the whites of his eyes appearing when he rolled them. Such a habit. “Don’t you have people to talk to? To ensure your position at the Ministry?”
It wasn’t until two days later when Sherlock suddenly bolted downstairs in the morning to the kitchen that John felt a pang of realisation of what they originally planned to do during the sleepover.
“You could use some food first, Greg,” John told him, spitting crumbs all over his plate and Sherlock’s arm. He apologised to him by nudging him with his knee and a wink.
“A bumblebee, John!”
we'e putting the WHO is superWHOlock >:D
Into battle!
“Wow, seems really wild in there,” John commented, sneaking a glance into the room behind the orange-and-red stained glass. “And pretty packed. I’m actually glad we have some space.”
He ran after Donovan, slithering through the narrow gap of the closing doors leading inside. Slightly out of breath, he made his way to her desk. She looked up at him, eyebrows arched in silent query.
“I love you, Sherly,” she said, cuddling him tighter and John and Dean cooed at them. Sherlock rolled his eyes and patted Irene on the back, putting her on the ground. “You’re the best tallest brother ever. Dean, do you want to be my brother too?”
----------------------------------
“I suppose we wait here for further instructions?” he tried conversationally, to no avail. Fleur pierced him with her blue eyes longer than he considered comfortable, and Krum still stood next to the fireplace like he was rooted to the spot. Blake shrugged noncommittally. “I guess so, then.”
“Nah, it’s coffee or death,” Greg replied, dumping yesterday’s brew in the sink and rinsing the carafe thoroughly. He refilled the reservoir with water and dumped powdered coffee in the filter, switching the machine on. “Irene asleep?”
“Call me a coward and I’ll incarnate as a cow next time to kick you square in the
party on the Reichenbach Lake! It was my intention to make this announcement at the beginning, but I wanted to see what peasants do in collapsing houses like this one. And since I proved that I am the queen of parties, I’ll be the one to guide you to one where we have chocolate fountains!”
Sherlock smirked and his back straightened a little. “Transfiguration is one of the more interesting subjects, and McGonagall is a very competent teacher. Though I have suggestion on improving some of the old-school techniques…”
Inside, he washed his hands compulsively and he let them stay under the stream for a long moment, hypnotised by the flow of water and the deafening sound it sent across the bathroom. Suddenly, a nagging feeling made him turn to the right, his sight catching a glimpse of something covered in an old ragged cloth propped against the wall tiles. Uncharacteristically, an invisible pull and faint whispers lured him forward, dragging his feet over to the object. Hand outstretched, he tore the sheet down, letting it fall to the ground in a hushed rustle.
“But… It’s true that Homestuck is sort of… weird. Extreme. Atrocious. The fandom knows it. Hussie -- the creator -- knows it. Am I overbearing with it? I reference it when I get the chance and the dots connect. Is it annoying?”
“Who said it had to be recycled?” she said dismissively. “Toss it out, poor bugger had enough, I’m sure. I have just the right amount of wool and rags at home to make a life-sized doll at home, Greg.”
“Bastard.”
“It wasn’t my fault!”
Cas nodded. “Alright. But I have a request.”
“Yes, John, that will do,” said Sherlock flatly, chin resting on the tips of his long fingers. “I believe we should introduce ourselves first properly. I’m Sherlock Holmes, a consulting detective,” – the other man shrugged helplessly when the trio shot him a confused look – “and this is John Watson.”
Fletcher huffed something incoherent into the piece of garment stuck in his mouth. He was seated in the Uncomfortable Chair no one ever wanted to sit on. He did not enjoy it.
“Anything you wanted to talk to be about, Sherlock?” their father said eagerly. He enjoyed mental sparing with his sons.
She mumbled something about ‘that wild Canadian blood’ and spooned more batter on the pan. Dean’s pancakes disappeared from under his fork as he watched this cinema unfold. Ah, this was good. He could get used to this.
“And I pet lizards willingly.”
As Dean’s speech continued, Irene’s face fell. Her lip trembled and eyes watered. Oh no. She was going to cry. Dean wanted to avoid a scene, and he certainly didn’t account for Irene to be so keen on hoarding colourful clothes. In an effort to diffuse the situation (Cas didn’t utter a word, looking on the verge of a freakout himself when a sob left Irene’s mouth), Dean swept the girl into his arms and on his hip.
Thank you for reading and I wish you all a pleasant day/night, wherever you are~
“High School -- no. That can’t be your only cinematographic background. We agreed on the HP marathon, but you need the
“Oh, have you met John already? He’s out grocery shopping right now but he should be back in about an hour approximately.”
Magnussen raised an eyebrow. “Then we erase him from the map of this town. Simple as that.”
The men were both wearing shades, the younger one taller than Sherlock, and the other was of similar height to John. The shorter man ran a hand through his hair, looking around. Nothing interesting about them, except for the car. Sherlock turned his attention back to John and Lestrade, when suddenly a man stormed back on the beach from the pier, clearly distressed.
Whev, everyone! They finally talk without being lil' shy bitches about it!! And all it took was a possible vampire threat, hah...
John scratched his temple, propping his chin on his fist as he leaned into the table. His gaze focused on the journal’s document that lied rolled out in front of him. He had grabbed a couple books on ciphers and secret codes that now lay spread out between him and Irene. His boyfriend’s sister was currently listing through a book from the 1860s while the Civil War raged in the US. They had to go at least thirty more years into the past.
“I think so too!” Jake nodded. “When she goes to the show she either goes with her grandpa or she gets in her own car. She doesn’t bother with disguise but she still wears the glasses. Not the shawls, though. Oh, and I heard her speak to someone named Moran. Or Moron? No idea, honestly. He’s a guy.”
“He’s tame so far, and the Winchesters trust him. Besides, it’s not like I had another option. The kids snuck him in during tours, I had no idea they brought him in until Irene slipped up. And a day later I overheard them talking about it, and it clicked. He seemed uncanny, but this narrowed it down tremendously and explained why none of the conventional invisible traps had an effect on him.”
“What? How do I do that?”
“We can ask him after the tour is done,” Mrs Hudson said, closing her custom-made briefcase. “He is going to be stuck with the group for another half hour, and I have to clean up in my shed.”
and yeah, Freddie is not really Freddie, but it's the effort that counts and he sounds amazing! we'll certainly be seeing more of our new friend
“No, it’s all fine, trust me. Have some rest, we can discuss the other things later.”
“Yes, this is Sherlock,” he introduced the boy, “son of my good friend, Minnie Holmes. He and his sister Irene will spend the summer here. John and I brought him up here to show him how we fish around the Falls.”
“Uh-huh. So you’re saying I don’t have a video of you practicing
John slept like a log for hours before he resurfaced to the land of the living. His eyes snapped open suddenly, if blearily. He lay staring at the wall, hands tucked under his pillow. Yawning, he used his jelly-like legs to turn himself on his back, stretching out, back arching as his muscles sang praise to the luxurious movements.
May you never get your heart burnt out~
Dean, who started stuffing his cheeks with cherry pie one-handedly, almost choked. “What problem?” he asked, but it all came out as a jumble of ‘
“Do I look like I fool around with the supernatural?”
Cedric raised his hand. “Are you going to teach us how to become animagi?”
“And what then?”
“I haven’t. Now I will. A
McGonagall flicked her wand, but nothing came from their pockets. She sighed, definitely being done for the day.
Shivers ran down Mary’s spine like ripples of water. The way he off-handedly revealed this fact was disturbing. She had killed two ghouls, telling herself that they were better off dead than in the outcast condition they had been living in, but Moran’s approach was much less merciful. But he could be bluffing to throw her off. Either way, he was revolting. She joined the M Club for John, to make him fall in love with her as he should have two years ago, not for killing. But as long as it stays in the supernatural territory she will be fine.
"I thought that-"
“August twenty-first,” John said, sighing dreamily. “It’s what, 2022? I’ll turn twenty-two as well. Jeez, I’m getting old. When’s yours?”
“I’m sorry girl, you can’t come with us,” John told her, petting her head. Sherlock scratched behind her ear. A whine formed at the back of her throat. “We’re going to buy food. Dogs aren’t allowed in shops. Yeah, I know, but the hygiene control wouldn’t agree.”
“You okay?” he asked, smirk barely repressed. Sherlock avoided his gaze and set his bottle aside. That’s a partial win. It’s all in drawing it out.
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Sherlock mumbled, definitely not rosy-cheeked. John won’t tease him about it. Much.
it was here. This precise place!”
The clock was ticking, thin handles showing precise time with rhythm: 11:30 pm. The Shack was quiet, and the occasional snoring coming from Greg’s bedroom was muffled by the telly in the living room and John’s careful footsteps.
“Yes.”
“Wait,” John interrupted. “We don’t exactly have the money to go on a shopping spree.”
Damn. Busted. “Remind me to give you more credit,” Sherlock told him, running a hand through his hair. It needed a wash.
Kate looked Irene over head to toes, smiling slyly. “Nah, I’ll show you how to do it!”
John leapt up the ladder, Irene and Alex cheering him on while Cage charged at him akin to an enraged bull in Spain. Cage almost caught John’s ankle, but his rigid legs gave out and he slumped down, his head hitting the ladder steps with precise rhythm.
Sherlock sighed and rubbed his face with the knuckles of his hands. There was no escape. Curse this. A more in-depth conversation with John Watson was inevitable, too. And worse, what if he turned out to be interesting and intelligent and even more captivating? That would be his utter defeat. That would mean that
Irene giggled and let her gaze wander over the surrounding forest. Birds chirped happily in the rich crowns of trees, although when Irene thought about it, she could ask Jake to translate some of that gibberish for her.
“No, John was surprised like you that he’s able to see the wings,” Irene told her, crossing her arms. The holidays sure were getting interesting. Speaking of which, they should check up on Jake and what he dug up on Mary and the stinky M Club. Hm. Not that she doesn’t trust Cas, he was chill, but Jake hasn’t explicitly said yet whether he wants to meet Sherlock and John or not. They had to be careful getting under the porch. They needed to distract the Johnlock duo and Cas. Oh! “Cas, since when have you had these clothes on?”
“He doesn’t. We managed to keep it all a secret until now, and believe me, it’s better that way.”
part two of John and Sherlock's Second Year at Hogwarts
“Bland,” Sherlock judged, swallowing.
“There’s two more people in the house, it’s to be expected.”
“Or Nicolas Cage.”
“Mork?” Greg whispered. Mork stayed quiet, concern furrowing her nonexistent eyebrows.
“They’re not in this world. Not yet, at least. They were checking up on me, apparently, but caused me no injury or loss of memory. They also said we will meet soon. I knew it wasn’t God, and then the being went on a small rant about how they’re better than Him and that He doesn’t care about us. Hasn’t for ages. They thought it would be ‘hilarious’,” -- Cas used exaggerated air quotes here -- “to snatch me but that He didn’t notice. They think of me as an investment for the future.”
“He does!” Sherlock confirmed, a smile tagging at the corners of his mouth. “He’s as talented as the real Freddie. He’s our friend.”
“Are you kidding? My dad was so happy when I told him; he thinks understanding how muggles live will help me get a position as an Auror one day,” Greg said.

John entered through the kitchen. He nodded at Sherlock, placing three medium-sized canvas pieces into his armchair and a plastic bag full of what appeared to be paint next to it. He then disappeared back in the kitchen.
“Yep. Like ‘em?”
“Didn’t you whack him on the head with a journal to paralyse a pixie?” Dean chimed up, and Sherlock sighed.
Dean, I hate this.
episode 13, chapter 3
John himself poured himself a glass, following Sherlock out to the corridor. He stepped over the cardboard that prevented Redbeard from dashing around the house and peeing on the carpet and shrugged off his shirt. Sherlock disappeared up in the attic, probably to change his clothes, so John wandered into his room and gathered his dirty clothes to throw them into a hamper and have a quick shower. It was after six and already hot as balls. He couldn’t wait for autumn, he loved that season.
It wasn’t until five minutes later that she heard the door hinges creak and light footsteps make their way to Sherlock’s bed. Her brother was quieter than usual. A silky shuffle of the nightstand drawer indicated he was fishing for his lighter. Did he get a craving this morning? His smoking was becoming more and more frequent, and it was no longer tied to stress but likely just a leisurely use of nicotine. Mummy won’t like that. And neither will John, if he smells the smoke on Sherlock. So far it seemed like none of that happened.
“Better. But I do deserve the right as your boyfriend to come over to you and snog you senseless if she sees you in public and tries to flirt with you.”
The man considered Irene. He walked up to her, towering over her, the bloke being as tall as Sherlock. Maybe even taller by a trifle. “Now that you mention it -- I’m looking for my companion. Also an Englishwoman like you, this tall,” he held up a palm to indicate the height, slightly above Irene’s, “red hair, brow-length fringe, wearing dark jeans, blue-grey jumper…”
“Irene, are you staying with us?” Sherlock asked his sister, crouching on her level. She shook her head.
“I heard you talking about Gloria Scott’s ghost,” Sherlock breathed, John huffing as he tried to catch a breath. The other man’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, but he continued acting like he never even heard of the word ‘ghost’ itself. Sherlock gestured to himself and John, “I think we may be of help.”
Sooner than he was able to register, he bolted out into the hallway, struggling to get his shoes on his bare, cold feet. He cursed, rushing to fetch the mystery journal and in the meantime he called out to Mrs Hudson and Lestrade, but both were absent and no reply came. He ran out on the porch, sighing in relief when he saw John loading up a box with leaflets onto the golf cart’s passenger seat.
Deciding that he’d rather not have his melted ass glued to the hood of their car, Greg went to sit in the driver’s seat and turned the AC on. He scrolled through his social media to pass time. He frequented Instagram these days and lurked in the feeds of beauty gurus to see what drama was on. So what if he had a guilty pleasure? Pissing people off was his favourite hobby. Just get them started on highlighters and have a field day watching all their foundations crumble to dust.
Glancing at the digital clock on Irene’s bedside table, Sherlock thought it was about time to ‘officially’ wake up. He dressed in blue jeans and a simple white shirt with rolled up sleeves. He didn’t bother putting on socks, it was hot already and he would suffer enough, not having proper shorts to wear. He would have to buy some with Irene’s help.
“Huh. So without your powers you’re basically a baby in a trenchcoat.”
They formed a tight circle, surveying the army of the dead that kept on coming. And then, Sherlock saw it. The low tide revealed a structure shallowly buried under the lake’s surface that resembled a long pier leading all the way to the waterfall. He saw its outline, not too far from where they were standing now. He would just have to make a run for it. There had to be something in there. Gloria kept looking there, so logically James told her he would be arriving from that direction, though he never did. He opened the journal again, getting a glare from Dean, but he kept on listing until he found relevant information.
John marvelled at how hyped and lazy at the same time his friend could be. It drove him crazy that Sherlock couldn’t be bothered by subjects like Charms; they were interesting, but not as much as the other two. It was also unfair that while John worked his pants off during History of Magic - not falling asleep was a skill he worked hard to achieve - Sherlock simply memorised chunks of information in the span of an hour, acing the tests. Then, he ‘deleted’ the information, deeming it unimportant.
Vivien’s knuckles went white as she gripped the steering wheel. Mary chose to lift an eyebrow over rolling her eyeballs. Nervousness, she was familiar with. But at this stage her crewmate should be good enough to put themselves on ease during an active case.
look of fake confidence, he nodded at his reflection and said, “Into battle, then.”
"No idea. Go to sleep, it's alright, Carl, sorry for waking you up," John said apologetically. Given that Carl had nightmares, he didn't want to give him more fright than he could be already experiencing.
EDIT: ALSO HAPPY FATHERS' DAY TO BOBBY SINGER AND GREG LESTRADE ONLY (also Cas and Dean but inside this universe it's only Bobby and Greg for now)
“Uhm, sure! Or, you know, just someone who lives in the town.”
“Hey, there’s two more necks -- well, three since your friend Cas is staying for a couple days -- to feed. Food tends to run out faster as an ill effect of that. How about you and Sherlock go shopping for groceries? You can buy some junk food for your girl’s night too for all I care.”
He sighed once more, this time with exaggerated exhalation from deep within his lungs. John stirred, but still didn’t do as much as roll his shoulders, three-quarters of his body turned to the book he was reading. Sherlock turned on his chair on his right side and pierced John’s figure speculatively.
to kissing Sherlock. Thinking of him, he glanced over his shoulder to see him look just as sour as John felt.
“Why lavender?” John asked, scanning Sherlock’s hair and face. It was now his turn to flush.
“And this is Grace. Redbeard’s mom. She likes you. Both of them do.”
“I wanted to check on you, Greg,” she said, tutting and pushing past him into the room. “Dear me, you’ve chosen well! My room is a bit bigger, though.”
“Take care,” Cas nodded, letting John take the wheel from there. “And don’t get eaten by cartoon characters.”
“But what could’ve scared him?” Sherlock thought out loud. The three turned to him. “What? He was probably attacked. Could be a mountain lion, or a wolf, but in that case he may have not survived. You said he was constantly checking the forest when he was found. That sounds like he was being hunted or followed.”
Heaving a ragged sigh, John sat up, worrying his lip between his teeth. He reached for his phone, absentminded and unbothered by the outside world for the moment. Swiping his thumb up, the screen unlocked (no need for password at the Shack), and his finger tapped on the Messenger icon. Curious how he, Irene, nor Sherlock made a group chat for them yet. Actually, they haven’t even sent out friend requests, even though it’s understandable since they talk to each other daily.
“Yes?” Greg looked at her, his brows furrowing at today’s generation. “I mean, this is obviously trash. So I’m getting rid of it.”
, and I met the Queen of England. Which I might have with Holmes.”
Hi peeps! We're back!!
“Thank you. And your guess?”
"Will do," Harry gave her a quick smile, taking two steps at a time to get to the flat upstairs.
But Sherlock, clearly agitated for some unknown, insane reason, grabbed him and they went to investigate the source of the sound.
“No matter?” Wilkes repeated, tone incredulous. He stepped closer but stopped when John put his hands on his hips in a silent warning, beckoning him to try. “You’re the one talking weird and offending people! All these ‘deductions’ or whatever you called it. Pretty dumb tricks, if you ask me. You watch too many criminal shows to differentiate what’s real and what’s not. Sure, you solved the Freddie problem the other day, but if you keep running your mouth like a childish freak, insulting people, I won’t be the only one desiring to beat you up.”
words: 3520
“‘Yo mama’ jokes are outdated,” Kate pointed out, showing her disapproval through her frown. Sarah nodded, saying that it could work only situationally according to her most recent poll in her story on instagram.
Mrs. Hudson led them upstairs, talking about how she and Greg - so, mostly her, but don’t tell Greg - renovated the Shack from the inside, though there was still a lot of work to be done on the outside. Sherlock couldn’t agree more.
“Goddamnit.”
“Good. Now, what is more acceptable is Transfiguring oneself into an animal. It requires a great deal of concentration, otherwise you may get stuck in a half-animal, half-human form, which is not pleasant for anyone involved, spectator or not.”
“What did you find?” Dean asked, following after the child in case she fell.
Take care,
“What, you didn’t notice?” John laughed, hugging Sherlock.
“Then how come you have, presumably, healthy wings?” Sherlock said, craning his neck to look at Castiel. He seemed lost for an answer.
He took out a piece of laminated paper and gave it to Donovan, who read it and immediately looked at Lestrade as though to say,
John smirked. “I thought you hated repeating yourself? But jokes aside, I do. Very much. I…”
“Oh, you!” Mama grinned, prosthetic teeth shining at him. Sherlock couldn’t resist the urge to smile back. The woman emitted contractive energy that made him feel full of life -- well, fuller than the two-hundred percent he was at right now, given that he and John got together. “Is he yours, Gregory? What a handsome young man, this boy. And the voice! You could lull me to sleep any time, rawr! Haha!”
Fun fact: The deer junkie was a spontaneous addition while I was editing, and I'll be honest - I love it. To quote Dee: "I JUST IMAGINED THAT STONED LOOK ON A DEER, IT'S PRICELESS" - I have a screenshot for proof. So. This happened :D
John lifted an eyebrow, intrigued. He typed out a response.
“You heard me. I know, pretty shocking. But she’s telling the truth! I saw her tentacles and she’s been stuck here for years when some fishermen caught her. She escaped, flopped through the forest and almost died, but forest animals like the deer and skunks licked her awake and helped her plop into this lake from that cliff overhead. Pretty crazy!”
“Getting a green thumb, are we, brother?” Irene stepped inside, leaving the doors wide open to create a draft. The room was too hot. Blood hell -- the whole world was. Sherlock stopped mid sentence as he rattled on about another dirt sample, glaring at her.
“Yeah, and you rocked the stage yesterday, too,” John said, nudging her conspiratorially. “God knows Janine needed a slap from reality. Sad that she bribed her way to the crown.”
the slow burn is almost over guys o:) hang in there!
“Greg, we need to talk,” John said. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sherlock open the fridge door and peer inside to grab a juice carton.
“Be nice, Holmes,” she scolded him, but she also gritted her teeth when Kate continued on with her ghostly wailing. John heightened the volume to maximum. That offered small relief and a lot of sound waves vibrating through their bodies. “Why don’t you show us how to sing then, you smart-arse?”
“John isn’t exactly predictable, and it is merely a checklist,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly in his scientist voice. Long fingers played with the hem of his sleeve. “I cannot apply my accumulated internet knowledge of dating tips to John because he isn’t ordinary. But what is there for me to do? Seduction isn’t my forte. Deduction by seduction, that’s awful to say the least, and I had already deduced him.”

So, at the beginning of December when teachers were giving out tests left and right, he decided it was the perfect time to rouse John from his slumber in the middle of the night.
“You better,” John grinned up at him, tipping his chin up to meet him in a kiss. The sloppy sound of it apparently interested Redbeard enough to stuff his snout into the action, breaking them apart. “Ew, off, Red!”
"What are you talking about? What did I miss?" asked Greg upon seeing how effective John's tactic was. So he decided to tell him about their short adventure during the night. At first he didn't believe him, but when John told him the details, he couldn't contain his laughter.
“I can? Dude! And here I was searching the swamp! Jesus, I’ll ask my attorney. Anyway, gotta go. Take care, I’ll send you an email about the toxic waste!”
“But it made you smaller?”
“Yes, exactly. So, will you come? It’s just a friendly dinner. I’m curious what’s new in your life,” she said mildly, eyes darting minutely to Sherlock and Irene. John wasn’t sure he wanted to see their reaction to this mess. “You know, university life and all that.”
. Sherlock had heard of this memory technique before. He even intended to try and use it, but he always got sidetracked by one experiment or another. From what he remembered, the technique consisted of assigning words and information to furniture and easily tangible things one could see if they were to imagine a room they’re very familiar with. This Mind Palace, however, seemed to be slightly…. advanced, per se.
“If this is about ‘fate’ or similar topic --”
“Your generosity is astounding,” Sherlock said, sipping his coffee. His content hum meant it was exactly to his liking. He looked everywhere but at John. “But I meant what I said, John. I’m not easy to deal with. You may not see it now, and you may not even by the end of summer, but eventually you will.”
“For a while. He snores five percent louder than you.”

“Don’t call him ugly,” John reprimanded him, even though he found the human-bird rivalry hilarious. Who’d have guessed Sherlock Holmes would be jealous of a dodo? Meep clicked his beak at Sherlock, who crouched near the river bank to get a better look at the peculiar swans. “Do you want to stay here for a bit? I can go have a look around and call you if I find something interesting.”
“I’d rather not risk spilling liquid on these documents,” Sherlock said, straightening a file to perfection. “Twenty minutes won’t kill us. If anything, we can order more and take it with us for later.”
“Sherlock, do you seriously not see that John is interested? In you, I mean. He was since the day you collided in the gift shop. I swear, it was like from a romcom movie Mummy watches on lazy Saturdays. The moment you locked eyes there was an immediate spark. As if you two knew each other already.” She shrugged, but there was a thought nagging at her mind as though begging for recognition. She repressed it, her mind was just in overdrive.
Mycroft sticked his pointy nose out in a proud manner, his face blank and innocent. “Oh, nothing serious. Just a minor position in the government. After all, I'm only eighteen. Time will tell where it leads us all. Farewell, John. I'll come collect Sherlock on Monday afternoon.”

Sherlock figured he was not going to read right then, so he put the book on the nearby nightstand with John’s help when it proved to be too far out of his reach. John’s fingers sneaked into Sherlock’s hair and started massaging his scalp, and he had a hard time focusing on anything else.
There was a loud thud of the door lost among the many chattering voices of pub-goers, alcoholics, bikers, and locals. Uninteresting on the whole, except for the bunch of the unnatural folks that had waltzed in hours prior. At first glance they were no different from humans. They were dressed according to the century, they looked like bikers with their leather boots and jackets, and they looked cool. Respect was dripping from them and nobody dared to start a fight with them.
Irene rubbed at her eyes and lay her head on her fluffy pillow. Cas could see the residual glitter reflect on their skins and hair. It really was everywhere. “Where’s Sherlock?”
He pushed past the swinging door, the smell of chocolate and cinnamon batter and frosting intensifying. Oh, and the
“Wait, what’s your companion’s name? And yours?” Irene called after the man when he departed for the City Hall. He turned around and walked backwards.
“Alright. And what about the third guy? The one who likes his trench coat in weather like this.”
“It’s fine, don’t apologise,” Sherlock said, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
said. He had to sleep on this, but perhaps it was too late.
Irene and Sherlock waited for John’s reply. None of them realised how hungry they were. John sighed, hugging Greg around the shoulder and steering him in the square’s direction. “We’ll order eight. What did you do this time?”
“My sonic screwdriver,” the Doctor said, showing it to the rest of them. “Convenient. Let me see if it fixes the monitor.”
The Doctor merely lifted his eyebrows at the profanity, and Donna nodded in appreciation. “What if it’s…. I don’t know, a fixed point in time?”
Meep clucked and turned his back to the swans. Sherlock snorted. “Someone’s an ugly duckling. Ouch! What for?”
