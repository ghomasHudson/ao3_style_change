“Can I help you?” His tone is curt, letting her know he has no time for any bullshit she may be about to spew.
"Where d'you hide your wings? Cause I know they're there somewhere." The angel didn't reply, rolling his shoulders and then Dean couldn't see. A mix of midnight blue and emerald green swam before his eyes when the light reflected off the dark that had taken Dean's vision, and then it moved, snapping him out of his staring. Dean's mouth was left hanging open as they moved and Castiel faced him instead. Worry was written all over his face, the fear that the now adult Dean wouldn't share the same enthusiasm about them as fledgling Dean.
And then their foreheads were touching and Cas could feel the relief flooding through their bodies and they just sat in the deafening silence with their hands tangled and breaths timed perfectly to match one another. Cas closed his eyes as Dean’s hand caressed the side of his face.  “All that said,” the hunter whispered, “if you ever pull that sacrifice shit again I will end you.” Castiel chuckled. “The point of the sacrifice part,” he whispered, “is that there's nothing left to end.” And then they pulled apart and Dean shoved him playfully and Cas drank his lukewarm tea and it was good. It would be good. And that was all they needed.
“Fuckin’ finally!” Ellen shouted dramatically from the bar. “Honestly, I was starting to wonder if y’all were being a bunch of freeloaders.”
He trekked up the ridge of a rocky cliffside for a while, until he came to a massive overlook. One side of the rock was sheet, straight down for hundreds of feet. Below his boots, a waterfall erupted from the cliff, water tracing the rock face all the way down till the bottom where it fed a massive lake. Dean dully wondered what would happen if he fell.
He’d look content in those moments. Sometimes, Dean imagined that the sunlight would erase anything that was wrong, the years, the bruises, the fear, the dirt, all of it, just for a few blissful minutes.
Everyone laughed. Dean still felt stuck in the previous conversation. His brain was trying to catch up. A beer was pushed into his hand by Jo.
“Yes, this morning. Let me talk Bobby. This morning I woke up and there was a radio playing. I didn't own a radio, and I’ve never owned a copy of the song. It was one of kaia’s favorites she-”
Dean tried to open his mouth to speak when suddenly Mary was by his side. He hadn't even seen her enter the bar. It was unlike him, he thought dully. Usually he scanned every space so carefully, kept a log of ins and outs even when he didn't mean to. She smiled.
Today he was gonna take the cards as they were played and eat bacon with his dead parents in a dimension he didn't fully believe existed until he actually got here. He was here for eternity. He could wait.
It wasn't until he’d pulled up to the cabin, stars twinkling in the navy twilight sky, that it occurred to him.
He hung his head back, face turned up towards the sky. “Cas,” he started, voice at a low whisper. His brain felt fuzzy again. Fuck it, he pulled himself up to his feet, standing up right, arms up and face looking directly at the sky.
long, and now I just get to drive around in my car all day, and that’s it. That’s all I’m supposed to do.”
The sun was starting to slink down under the mountain ridges, golden rays fighting for visibility through the tips of red firs and whitebark pines.
“It was ridiculous! And she's gettin’ closer and closer to lil Dean and she’s gotten him pinned on his hay bale and her eyes are glowin’ she's getting ready for all her lobotomy shit and he looks like he’s ready to piss himself and finally! I take the shot. It’s a perfect hit.”
“And I get it. That’s your right. I uh, I wouldn't wanna talk to me either.” He sniffed awkwardly. “Anyways I’m sure you are busy with angel business. Off with capital-G God. Tell Jack I love ‘im for me, will you? I hope he’s doing alright. It can't be easy.”
He felt like he’d turned into a dying supernova or something, like a cup knocked over and spilling and spilling and spilling until there was nothing left.
He kept hoping if he tried really hard he could sense Castiel’s touch here. Bobby said he helped. So Dean kept looking for his marks.
That evening, Dean went on a long drive. Midway through what he imagined to be heaven’s version of the Sierras, he pulled over and clambered out of baby. Bird song danced in the air, accompanied by the gentle sound of branches in the wind.
“And then-” Bobby wheezed, barely getting the words out through the hysterics, “I realized I’d forgotten the salt!”
When she came back, Sammy was happier than Dean had ever seen him. It was pretty remarkable. He looked like a golden retriever, all things considered.
He got to see Charlie again, real Charlie, not other-world-Charlie, and damn had Dean missed her. She was as bubbly and geeky as always, joyously showing Dean the newest LARP set up that involved magical weapons and pegasuses, because this was Heaven, why shouldn't there be winged horses?
Dean’s face lit up. Whether or not he could remember drinks with Bobby was no longer of importance, because this was a story. He crossed the room in long strides, picking up the piece of paper where he’d hastily scrawled down the lyrics earlier.
Mary slapped his thigh, as if she was a scolding housewife from a 60’s sitcom, as if he had made a mischievous joke, as if he had fondly called out Dean for something silly and sweet and goofy. It felt off. Sickly sweet. Unreal. Dean still felt half-asleep. His brain wasnt responding right.
Because see, the truth was becoming unavoidable. The truth was that he didn't want a hookup, or the domestic life as Steve the employee, he wanted Dean. And now, here he was, in a bar practically designed for humans to seek out eachother, to seek out sex or romance, and Dean was a million miles away.
Suddenly, he could feel pain again. It was everywhere, in his ribs and his eyes and his head and his legs. He could feel his nose bleeding. It was all-consuming, this pain, lining every orifice of his body. He considered screaming. He didn't think his lungs could take it.
Dean didn't laugh. He ate a bite of scrambled egg instead, ignoring the part of his brain that wanted to explore whatever memories were attached to the flavor.
He resisted the urge to clear his throat again. He settled for a pause instead. “I miss you. I’m sorry.”
He wiped his eyes and started up baby again. He could go back home, he thought dully. Learn some ASL for when Eileen gets here. It would be a nice surprise.
Bobby said it took a minute to adapt, to get used to the new life. To get those hunter’s impulses driven out of his system. He was paranoid, he knew that, his fight or flight triggered by shadows on the wall. But for some fucking reason he felt like he was holding his breath and he just needed to
As the figure changed, Dean quickly slipped his hand into his pocket and whipped out the paring knife from that morning. He slipped it up his sleeve.
The Roadhouse looked the same as it had years ago. He knew it was cheesy but just seeing the building still almost brought him to tears. The burnt husk it had become didn't linger in the air here. Here, the Roadhouse stood as if it had been there for centuries, unmoving and solid.
Cas stopped thinking about that. He tried not to during his moments of solitude. Those thoughts would be shoved back down his throat when the Empty made the rounds.
Cas’s gaze had fallen somewhere on the floor earlier. This made him look right back up. He looked Dean in the eyes.
Maybe, he wondered dully, that’s why he felt so shitty here. He’d lived a long goddamn life, and forty of those years had been spent, well. The opposite of here.
Part of him felt self conscious- he was sitting there in a smelly stained white tee shirt and navy sweatpants, his hair stuck to his forehead and nails bit to shreds. His Mom looked perfect- white v neck top and casual jeans with curled blonde hair. She’d painted her nails, he noticed. He never remembered her doing that before. John wore what he’d always worn, a big canvas coat and flannel with heavy boots, his dark hair slicked back. It was commanding, put together.
He didn't know how long he’d been in there when he first became aware of the disturbance. There was a shift in the darkness, somewhere. He could feel something was different. He gazed out into the darkness. He closed his eyes again.
“And after you left I was thinking. Like I said. I would lay awake and I’d remember how goddamn much you gave up.” He wiped his nose. “I mean, you disobeyed God. You-” He was starting to sound hysterical. “And I started thinking “what if that was all for me,” and I know I’m probably just a raging narcissist and that was never even in the cards for you but,” he choked again. “But I couldnt live with myself anymore, knowing how fucking much you gave for us, for Sam and I. And then everything was fixed and Chuck was gone and Lucifer was dead and I still just. There was something missing, you know? I was supposed to be thrilled we’d finally saved the world, and I’d lie awake and think about you.”
Heaven was fascinating- you could only interact with people you’d known before. Like he could meet up with Ellen and Jo for tea, but no matter how far he traveled he’d never get to meet anyone really cool, like Joan of Arc or John Lennon. They were somewhere else, in some other brand of heaven. Probably a brand of heaven that included actual cities, not just sprawling wilderness.
“This wasn't supposed to be some full-circle bullshit,” Cas said, a small amount of unfamiliar range sneaking into his voice. “You know why I did it, Dean. I told you. Say it.”
It hit him like a wall, and then it was gone. The entire world was filled with static. Dean hit the floor, hands over his ears out of pure instinct.
The kitchen was empty, as was the adjacent dining table. Through the windows, Dean could tell there was no one on the porch either. There was just a small radio, old fashioned, sitting on the table.
The knocking on the door came again. Dean shook himself from the memory and strided across the living room to answer it.
“I know I was a shit father to you, for a long ass time. I told myself I was doing the best I could, given the circumstances. Maybe in the beginning that was true. It stopped being true after a while.”
Dean looked at the ground again. “It’s just. Sometimes I almost miss the life. Maybe that’s what this is. I had so much to fight against for
Dean spent days, years, hours, however time worked up here, driving along the most pristine slices of America. Dean knew it wasn't really America. American-inspired, for sure. There was a postcard quality to everything here. Everything felt like a snapshot. It felt nostalgic, no matter where he went, somehow, despite the landscapes being new and invented and perfect. Sometimes, he’d pull over the impala at a particularly beautiful overlook and gaze out at the sky or watch the bees as they flew low over meadows of flowers.
“I assume that feels nice?” Dean nodded, unable to form words as Castiel chuckled and resumed grooming the wing that was closest to him. He began to pitch forward the more relaxed he became, threatening to fall off the edge of the bed before Castiel pulled him back towards him, laughing at the confused look on Dean's face.
- couldn’t cast spells but I made damn sure that every little injury or problem could be dealt with.” Dean visibly deflated at the memory, sighing again as he wiped at his eyes with a little more force than Castiel thought was necessary.
“I’m the oldest. It’s the law.” Sam grumbled, turning away again as Castiel offered Dean a soft smile at their antics.
"Dammit Cas! Dop avoidin' my westions!" Dean was sat on one of the beds, pouting with his arms folded crossly across his chest, giving his best death-stare at Castiel, who had his nose in a book.
” Dean stepped out of the kitchen, the pot momentarily forgotten as he knelt down by the sofa; confusion working its way on to Castiel’s face as he looked down at the small book in his hands.
"No - the grace that lets you have wings will stop you getting an 'ouch'." Big eyes were turned to him again, and he saved Dean the bother of asking. The air around Castiel's shoulder seemed to melt as his wings were brought into vision, and a lamp suffered as a wing crashed into it. Dean looked at Castiel, then to the broken lamp and back again, eyes wide in amazement before breaking down into giggles at the carelessness of the older angel.
“Yes.” Sam reeled at the abruptness of the answer, and Castiel took the moment of shock to grab Dean's feather back off the younger Winchester, slipping in to one of the internal pockets of his trenchcoat as he made his way to the door. Sam still stood, shocked as Castiel turned back to him.
“Ah, Cas...!” The slow movement of Castiel's fingers was driving Dean crazy, wings flapping erratically as the pleasure almost became too much. An empty feeling suddenly filled him as fingers were removed, and Dean opened his eyes to find Castiel looking at him hungrily. The bright blue was hardly visible in the angel's eyes, pupils blown so wide with lust that it sent any excess blood Dean had south.
“Yes, your blades. Angel blades, silly.” Dean laughed, and the witch moved her hand from his face to his throat, cutting the laugh short. “What's so funny, hmmm?”
“... I... Don't know. But something's changed.” Castiel didn't offer any more explanation before leaving the Impala, Sam scrambling after him.
“Perfect!” It was then she pulled, Dean crying out as she ripped a feather from him, grace crackling in his eyes. “Thank you, dear. Now, you behave yourself here, hmmm?” He gasped in response, the pain unlike anything he had felt before, consciousness threatening to leave him.
“Ow.” Dean shook his head, the last of the spots disappearing from his vision. “What... The hell... Was
“Are... Are you okay, Cas?” Castiel looked the hunter in the eyes, still breathing heavily but more steadily than before.
“It may be easier to show you rather than try and explain. And Sam?” He looked up slowly, one eyebrow raised in question.
“It’s the day I rescued you from Hell.” It’s said in such a matter-of-fact tone that Dean’s brain briefly short circuits, gaping uselessly at the former angel opposite as he takes another drink - as though he’s just told the hunter the weather for today rather than reminding him of one of the most painful experiences in his life.
“I still mean what I said, Dean. There isn’t anything you can’t do if you just apply yourself.” Castiel shrugged as Dean groaned, wings dropping.
“Gonna assume that’s all you’re gonna tell me about that too, isn’t it?” A knowing smile was the only answer before Bobby picked his bottle up again, taking a long drink from it before letting out a satisfied sigh. Dean couldn’t help the small laugh as he sat back in his chair, content with the silence between himself and the older hunter, basking in the warmth the sun had to offer.
“... Shit. I am sorry that I hit you with my car. And no, that definitely won’t have helped. So again, sorry about that.”
More research turned out to be the answer to Dean's question, and normal sized Dean was much more distracting than fledgling-sized. Odd noises were made, drawing Castiel away from the pile of books that had steadily grown, but everytime Castiel turned to look at whatever Dean was doing the noise stopped.
To you. The one you ran away from?” Castiel slowed down, almost coming to a complete stop before looking up at Dean.
“What the hell do you want with me?” The words were spat out, vision clearing fully now as he looked around for the source of the voice. He tried to lean forward to get a better look, shooting back as the nails dug deeper in to his wings, gasping at the pain.
"The witch! Her spell... My grace changed it, instead of just de-aging you, it gave you wings, turned you into a fledgling..." Castiel's voice trailed off towards the end of the explanation, stopping pacing after realising he'd started. Dean just followed the movements with his eyes, falling back onto the bed that the older angel had vacated whilst staring intently.
“Gonna taste better.” Dean shrugged as he pulled a jug from the fridge, closing it with his hip as he turned back to Castiel. “You want to keep an eye on this while I whip us up some pancakes too?”
“My apologies, Dean. I think I may have found the way to go, if that’s of any help to you?” Castiel points down the corridor, Dean realising the sound of fire crackling coming from the direction he had pointed. Sam rolls his eyes, moving past the pair of them with his gun drawn, hammer pulled back and ready to shoot should any witches try to pull anything on them now. They’ve been in the warehouse barely half the night, patience for their trickery well and truly spent now, itching to get the job finished. Dean’s eyes glow with grace again as he realises they’re close to being free, muttering about
“In more than once sense of the word, yes.” He ignores the glare Dean gives him, opting to start the short walk to the entrance of the Bunker instead. “There may be some things in the Bunker I can use to stabilize it, and it’ll be easier to get a better look at once we’re there.”
here since he was a puppy, he’s never been anyone else’s dog.” He hopes that Castiel heard him enough to go along with the plan he just pulled out of his ass, sending a silent prayer to the Familiar that it broke through his terror.
“How long d’you think this is gonna take?” Dean’s voice was weak as he glanced at Castiel, face paler than Sam had seen it for quite some time. Some of the glee drained from him as he watched Dean swallow thickly - no doubt trying to stop himself from vomiting all over the side of the road again - as it was replaced with concern. Castiel gently clasped his hand, giving it a soft squeeze as his other hand came to rest on his shoulder, an equally soft smile on his face.
“That sounds good too.” Castiel doesn’t see the small smile on Dean’s face as he turns to the pan, brows briefly furrowing at the warm feeling that washes over him, quickly looking back to see if anything about the Empath gives him away. Dean is hunched over a bowl whisking pancake mix, his own brows knitted together as he concentrates on getting the perfect consistency and the right amount for the two of them; this time Castiel knows where the warm feeling comes from as he laughs at the way Dean’s tongue juts out in concentration. He smiles again softly as he turns back to the bacon, turning it over as he continues to let the pure domesticity of the situation warm him through.
“One mystery at a time.” He dragged two fingers across the table's surface, grimacing at the tackiness of the blood, frowning when his fingers came away black. He rubbed the substance between his middle finger and thumb, noticing the burnt smell that accompanied the powdery texture, these answers only adding to his confusion. Now he was closer, he noticed they almost looked like... Burns? He shook his head, the marks not deep enough on the table to be called burns. Maybe scorch marks? He took a few steps away to get a wider view of the whole table, heart dropping when he realised what it was. There had been an angel here at some point, the darker stain the imprint of wings as they'd been killed, covering the whole top of the table.
“Seriously?” He strained against the restraints on his wrists, wings involuntarily trying to flap slightly as he pulled as hard as he could. The rumble rose in volume as he pulled, dying down again when he stopped.
"Jus' try Cas. Pwease." Castiel looked down at the de-aged Dean, who held nothing but hope in his eyes, and the angel could feel it. He desperately wanted Dean back to normal, but didn't know how far the witch's spell reached. Castiel sighed, again, and gently placed his fingers on Dean's forehead, almost willing his DNA to revert, his molecules to switch back to adult form. He felt something inside Dean pull away when Castiel's grace reached in to help, but Castiel ignored it and tried to find what it was. A tendril of grace brushed past whatever it was, causing a feeling like electricity to pass back up through it and Castiel yelped, almost dropping Dean.
The word came out as a whisper, catching in Dean’s throat as he took a hesitant step forwards. He took another step, the haze almost disappearing as the figure took on a more solid shape; Dean didn’t realise he’d started to run until he skidded to a halt at the end of the pier. The breeze caught Castiel’s hair in a way that Dean couldn’t help but stare at, billowing his trenchcoat around him in an equally captivating way.
Castiel stopped, slowly lifting his head off Dean’s chest to make sure he hadn’t stopped breathing, blinking slowly as green eyes lifted to meet blue.
“I am doing it slowly! If I go any slower, I’ll just drop, and I think I’ll take a hard pass on that thank you very much!” Dean’s thankful that there’s nothing around the vicinity of the Bunker for miles, embarrassed blush working its way onto his face as he looks down at Castiel on the ground. The angel made landing look so
“They are beautiful, Dean. They match you perfectly.” Dean blushed, turning away from the angel. “I mean it. Every angel had their wings created to match their unique personalities – yours apparently seem to be no exception. Beautiful, but there's no mistaking the strength there.” He lifted the hunter's chin up, placing a chaste kiss on his lips. The blush on Dean's cheeks had only intensified, making its way to his ears.
” Castiel froze as the bubbling stopped, Dean’s eyes going wide as he slowly turned back to the other room. “... Uh. Not… You?” Castiel whined as whatever spell Dean had managed melted off him, shaking as he shifted back to human form again. He cautiously made his way to the kitchen, to Dean’s side as he continued to stare at the frozen pot. Dean was quiet as he spoke, eyes glued to the stove as Castiel gently placed a hand on his arm.
“Cas, I’m warning you…” Dean threatened. A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth but he kept his tone even so Cas wouldn’t know.
“Sam, young women are dying. I think that comes before a stupid love spell on me and Cas,” Dean bit out.
“Yeah, ya do,” Dean said taking the hardness out of his tone and replacing it with a softer one instead, even though it killed him to act like he was okay with the whole date thing.
Dean tilted his head to the side as he looked at Cas. His face softened and his voice dropped an octave when he said, “Because I’ve been holding back way more than you have been, so it was my fight.” Dean leaned in and gently brushed away the dirt from the light scruff on his cheek and smiled. They had been here less than twenty four hours and Cas already had a fair amount of peach fuzz. He brought his other hand up and held Cas’s face in his hands, his eyes roaming over every inch of his face. There was something that he needed to say. It had been on his mind for a while now and he finally found the courage to say it. “I’m a little late to respond to what you said when you almost died a few weeks ago, but I wanted you to know that I love you, too.” The words rolled off his tongue without hesitation and Dean wondered why it had taken him so long to finally tell Cas.
A smile appeared on Dean’s dirty face. “I think I know what’s going on here. Let me see if I can help you out. Do you suddenly feel certain about anything?”
“Don’t worry, I won’t do anything that will ruin my chance of this finally happening,” the young girl said as she went and opened the bedroom door. “Thank you so much for doing this.”
Cas slowly opened the door and peered inside. Not seeing anything unusual, he opened it all the way. The closet was a huge walk in type, filled to the max with clothes and accessories, and a head to toe mirror on the far wall straight ahead. Cas looked back at Dean and shrugged as he stepped inside.
Dean swallowed hard, a lump full of regret stuck in his throat. Why had he let Cas leave in the first place? As he stood on the sidewalk staring up at concerned blue eyes, he now had no idea.
Dean quickly jumped up and said, “Let’s go!” as he pulled out his keys and began to jiggle them impatiently.
Cas turned to him, the Christmas lights casting beautiful colors across his skin, and when he saw Dean staring at him, his smile turned softer.
Dean smiled and said, “Good,” as he grabbed his leg and yanked it towards him, pulling Cas under the water. He laughed as he watched the Angel flail around, trying to get his barrings. When Cas finally shot up out of the water, Dean couldn’t stop laughing. Suddenly, he forgot about being cold.
“Awesome,” Dean said under his breath. “We’ll let’s do this,” he said, clapping Cas on the shoulder.
The sun rose even more, casting its rays across their faces. Birds began chirping as morning descended upon them and Dean felt reluctant to get up, but knew they needed to start their search for a way home. “We should get going,” he said hesitantly.
They both stood staring at each other in the dimly lit storage room and then they looked down at the wet spot on the floor. Their eyes flew back to each other’s in pure panic at the realization of what just happened.
“Did you find out any information on the case? The faster we solve this case, the faster we can concentrate on our problem. I don’t want Dean any more angry at me than he already is.”
Squinting in confusion, Cas nodded and handed the waitress the menu. She glared at Dean and then gave Cas a sweet smile before turning to place their order.
Dean eyed him up and down, alcohol letting his desire creep in even more, and he was suddenly second guessing his decision to drink. Now, he felt even more vulnerable. He watched Cas take the shot and found his gaze falling to his lips. They were wet now, glistening from the alcohol that he’d just drank. He knew Cas was doing his best to not look at him, but suddenly Dean wanted him to look at him. He wanted him to notice him, wanted his eyes to lock on his, wanted to feel the intensity of this spell even more than he was right now. He watched Cas down two more shots and could feel the lust growing between them with each sip of alcohol that they drank. Their inhibitions were coming down, allowing the spell to completely consume them. Dean pulled him in even closer to where there was no space left between them. This spell felt good now and he felt his soul beg for more. And with that feeling, he felt Cas stiffen beneath him and saw his jaw clench as he drained another shot of Whiskey. He briefly wondered if he’d gone too far.
As soon as their lips pressed together to seal their proclamation of love, there was a loud pop of air and a flash of white light.
“Funny,” Dean said. He turned when he heard Sam erupting into laughter. “What?” he asked as he cocked his head in confusion.
“I think she likes you. Should we name it?” Dean asked as he ran a finger up its horn and winced when his finger ran across the tip. “Yeah, that’s sharp.”
“Yes, you humans and your traditions always surprise me. But, I guess since I’m newly human, I can now join in on all those silly traditions,” Cas said, causing the buggy driver to look back at them with a questioning look on his face.
Cas scowled as he continued to mop up the beer. “Well, Dean, we can’t all be perfect,” he said, his eyes finding Dean’s.
Standing upright, Cas said, “I’m not sure, but I think it’s an animal of some kind. And it’s coming our way at a very fast pace.”
Slowly, their kiss became desperate, needy, and Dean found himself wanting more of Cas. He slipped his hand around his waist and underneath his white dress shirt, his fingers finding the bare skin along his side. He raked his fingers up and down, feeling Cas shiver at his touch.
Cas walked over to him and Dean stood and ran his hand through Cas’ hair, knocking the pine needles onto the floor. He planted a kiss on his lips and said, “Now, we just need to decorate the beast.”
“Um, are we ready?” he asked. He looked Dean up and down and narrowed his eyes. “Are you okay? You look like you’re in pain or something.”
“Hmm…” Cas placed a finger to his lips as he thought about it, and then his eyes brightened as he said, “How about Willow?”
They laid there together watching the sun as it slowly lifted from the ground, sending bright orange and red hues out into the sky like laser beams, and Dean couldn’t help but think how beautiful the scene was. Whatever was happening between them felt right, he was no longer in denial about his feelings, but there were still doubts and worries that simmered beneath the surface of his mind.
They finally pulled apart and with a shaky voice, Dean said, “I’m glad I finally had an excuse to do that.”
“What’s the matter, Dean? You look troubled,” Cas said as he slid one leg onto the bed and turned towards him.
A rush of relief washed over Dean as he stared down at the word. He felt Cas’s presence behind him even more clearly now, and when he turned back to him, he felt the love he had for him emerge from a hidden spot deep inside his heart. He’d had these feelings tucked away, trying to deny their existence for some time, but the key had finally been found. He stared at him not sure what to say exactly when Cas reached his hand out to him.
“Cas, dammit, open your eyes so I know you’re okay,” Dean said as he gently wiped away ash that covered Cas’s eyelids.
The corner of Dean’s mouth twitched into a proud smile. “I guess you liked that tape I made for you?”
“What are you doing?” Dean asked and watched as a startled Cas jumped, his long fingers skimming the edge of a bottle, knocking it off the shelf, and sending it sailing down to the floor.
With Cas so close, his warm breath tickled Dean’s neck as he spoke, but he found that he had no urge to pull away.
As they got in Baby, Sam said, “Were you guys riding with the windows down the whole time? It’s like thirty degrees outside.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll be right there,” Dean said, knocking back shot number five. He felt Cas’ presence beside him without looking. It was hard not to feel the energy and tug that pulled him to Cas.
They followed behind her, Dean casually looking from left to right, always on guard. The old boards creaked as they walked across the huge wraparound porch and into the house. Dean felt Cas tense behind him which caused him to be on guard even more. There was definitely something off about this place. An energy hummed inside, just like what they’d felt when they had pulled into the driveway.
Cas narrowed his eyes towards the front. “I’m not acting weird,” he said as he ran a hand nervously through his dark hair.
“I know what you are,” the woman whispered. “You’re a hunter,” she hissed. “How do I know you won’t kill me after I tell you?”
They pulled up to a little diner fifteen minutes from the hotel, and as they shuffled inside to grab a booth, Cas wondered if he should sit next to Dean or not. But as Sam and Dean took seats opposite each other, he saw Dean was the only one who had scooted over to give Cas enough room to sit. He slid in next to him, trying his best not to accidentally brush up against him.
As Dean started to loosen his grip on the witch, she smiled slyly as the beginning of a spell flowed from her lips. Without hesitation, Dean instantly slid the blade across her neck. As she fell to the ground at his feet, he pulled out his gun that was loaded with witch killing bullets and shot her directly in the heart. He turned and headed towards the door with Sam and Cas following behind him.
Cas studied him for a moment, raised one brow, and nodded. “Thanks, Dean.” And then turned and left.
Dean was use to their gazes lingering on each other longer than normal, but right now it hit him harder than usual. There was a different feeling that was pulsating between them right now, or maybe it had always been there and Dean was just seeing it for the first time with a different outlook. He felt himself leaning towards Cas, his body pressing into his, and Cas was leaning into him as well. Was he finally going to let this moment he’d been fantasizing about for years happen? And was Cas actually wanting it to happen?
“I need to eat first before I do any fighting,” Dean said. He turned around and eyed them both. “You both just going to sit there or are you coming?”
Giving him a sideways glance, Dean said, “Yeah, I’m freaking cold. The sun is setting which is taking away the little bit of warmth that I had.”
Dean found himself melting into Cas’ embrace, finally letting himself relax for the first time in forever. Cas’ fingers were on the verge of putting him to sleep, but he remembered there was something he had wanted to ask him. “Hey, Cas, why do you think the spell affected us differently? I was in pain, but you weren’t.”
Dean stood speechless at the bank as he watched a naked Cas slowly disappear into the crystal clear water. He looked down at his own dirty clothes and shrugged his shoulders as he began to undress himself. As the last piece of clothing fell onto the rocky bank, he began walking towards the water. He dipped one foot into the water and jerked back. The frigid water stung his skin and he winced. “I wasn’t expecting it to be so damn cold,” he said as he stared at Cas and wondered how it wasn’t bothering him at all.
He paced faster as his body ached harder. Every need flowed through his body in painful waves. He dragged a hand through his hair and pushed his bedroom door open, not able to fight it any longer. As he rounded the corner, he came face to face with a disheveled Cas. They both stopped and stared at each other, chests heaving hard, and lips parted in surprise.
They sat across each other at the table in the bunker the next morning. Cas had not seen Sam yet- Dean explained he was out picking up Eileen from a hunt in Pasadena. He also explained what happened with Chuck, that Jack had taken his place, and all the resurrections that followed (“except for you,” Dean said hoarsely, “Jack couldn't quite reach you.”)
, somehow. He thought he knew what that felt like, that 40 years in hell prepared him for every type of heat but this was different.
John Winchester strided over to the two of them, hand finding Dean’s shoulder almost immediately. “You know,” John said confidently, “Ellen and I always thought you two would be a cute couple.”
Dean was about to pick up the bible and read through the rest of the verse for clues when there was a slamming on the door.
“Oh uh, let’s see.” He strained to remember. His brain still felt fragmented, his thoughts not quite connecting.
Dean bit the inside of his lip again. He discovered that no matter how hard he bit, it wouldn't bleed.
He was still angry, he knew that. Rightfully so. How fucking dare his father sit there and talk about ownership and apologies without giving him one.
And before Cas could say anything else, Dean pulled him close, right into his chest, a sob racking through his body. They sat there like that for a while, Dean holding Castiel close as he shook. “I’m sorry,” Dean croaked. “I’m so so sorry.”
John opened his mouth slowly. “I’m sorry.” He shifted in his seat. “I’m out of excuses. I’m just sorry.”
And then he was on a floor, it was cold and dusty and Cas knew the scent and there was a feeling of euphoria slowly taking over the fear. He could feel someone there too, Cas was all tangled up in their arms and Cas knew it, he knew those limbs. Cas’s shoulder burned. His veins pounded . The world was free of white noise and there was something else, something familiar.
And so he’d go home and lie in that soft bed with the navy sheets as the sun set.  Dean would watch the golden rays light up the sky until they faded into a brilliant orange, and he’d try not to think about what he was doing wrong.
Mary smiled. “Of course, you’d see us again, silly.” Her smile was wide. Her teeth were whiter than Dean remembered. Heaven must do that. Amplify your happiness.
His chest heaved as he remembered what he’d said, what he’d confessed too. He pulled over as his stomach twisted.
“Exactly.” Bobby interrupted. “You miss him. It’s natural.” He elbowed Dean. “It was the same way with me and my family. I missed you. I feel more complete now that you're here.” He chuckled lightly again. “Don’t get me wrong, you died way too young and way too stupid but. I’m glad you're here.”
Dean nodded. It’s what he expected. “Yeah, yeah, I know. It’s just. You said Cas helped. Before. That just seemed like the type of thing he’d have wanted to sort out.”
Eventually he got into baby and drove over to Bobby’s. He was already on the porch, cooler by his side and a stained baseball cap pulled low over his face.
Cas pursed his lips. He’d probably known this for years. It was an inconvenience. But it was there. He googled the term once. Unrequited. It was a pretty sounding word. It made him feel meek and gross and twisted inside. He almost felt dirty for wanting Dean in a way he knew Dean could never want back. But that's how it was.
He caught John's eyes. “You never met him. He showed up a little bit after you, uh. Passed.” He nodded in Mary’s direction. “Mom’ll remember him. Anyways one morning he showed up on my car,” he readied for his dad to correct him and hurried his words “Uh, on baby, completely naked and covered in bees.”
“Dean, let’s think about how things work here for a minute.” Bobby held out his hand, a beer appeared in it moments later. “The physical being of this place is attached to what you want, right? You want a beer, you get a beer. Want to go fishing, the perfect road suddenly opens up.”
Chuck was now standing where Not-Sam had stood, adjusting his jaw. ‘Ugh. Shifting. What a process.” He shook out his arms. “Always makes me a little uncomfy.”
But now there were no explanations. Just silence. Cas looked down at his tea. Dean cradled a coffee. Cas knew it was at least 40% bourbon.
“It’s just. You- you never gave me a chance to say anything back. I wish you had. Cas you-” He was crying now. The tears ran warm down his face, and he snuffled hurriedly, trying to keep his composure. He had to do that. “Anyways. I fucking miss you, man. I uh. I hope we can talk soon. I-” He sighed. “I have some things to say.”
Bobby nodded. “Yes, Dean, I’m aware of your affinity for classic rock. You make it at least 35% of your personality.”
“I just, I thought-” He looked at Jo for help, but she just looked at him blankly. “Nevermind. It’s not important. Let’s get drinks.”
“What you said, it uh. It made me want to change.” Dean leaned forward awkwardly, putting down his coffee and leaning his arms on the table. His face fell into his hands. He looked back up.
Just moments after he had all the words down, the radio began to smolder, smoke pouring out of the panel in the back. The song stopped midline.
Dean still smiled every time he saw him. He knew it would take a multitude of heavenly sunsets to ever stop being a little surprised when he pulled up to that porch and saw the man sitting there, alive and happy.
He’d even gotten up the courage to wander down to John and Mary’s place. He stood just beyond the porch, debating, for what felt like hours, the back of his neck clamming up and his stomach churning. He didn't go in.
“See? Practically 12. So I ask Dean to go wait out in that barn so that the banshee ‘ill spot him and take the bait. And it’s fuckin’ cold outsude so we’re waiting and waiting and my hands are getting all numb and that’s been the bitch shows up.”
But just being happy, having that be the defining trait of one’s existence, that was a strange and foreign concept to him.
“Because, Dean, this is heaven. If it senses you aren't happy, it’ll try it’s best to create an environment where you are. This-” he paused, wetting his lips. “This is a wild goose chase.”
“What a view!” She said enthusiastically. Dean nodded, mouth full. She was right, it was a beautiful view.
“I just. I don't understand why.” Dean’s voice was filled with more emotion than Cas knew what to do with. “I don’t. You said it too, I was so angry.” His voice was broken again. “I was this ugly husk of who I used to be when you said it. I had treated you like shit. I was-” He took a steadying breath. “You're an angel, Castiel. You're this, this incredible thing. I didn't used to think angels were capable of love, you know, back when we first met, because you were all so autonomous. But Cas, god, you just. You have so much of it for this world, for Jack, for Sam,” his voice cracked violently now as silent tears made their way down his cheeks, “for me.”
and he threw off the sheets, hurdling down the stairs, already thinking about what he could use as a weapon because who the
Bobby leaned back in his chair. “And see,” Dean continued, “the song references this one bible verse, right? So I’m thinking it’s telling us there’s something wrong, something to investigate that relates to that exact verse. The road thing was to get my attention and now I need to figure this out and it’ll fix everything.”
“Yeah, it’s not on ANY of my cassette mixes. None of them. I only got into it right before-” He stopped for a moment. “Yeah. It wasn't on my mix that was playing at the time and I hadn't set it up to play, but it did. But it was iffy- it started skipping lines and repeating and then the road glitched.”
Reflexes took over and he pulled baby into reverse, the fastest he’d ever managed to do it, and he hauled ass back down the road, tossing his burnt hand over the passenger seat to see what was coming up behind him. He could feel the blisters developing on his fingertips already.
He bit his lip. “I think I liked thinking that there was some reason everything felt wrong. Some conspiracy. Instead it’s just me, I guess.”
“Anyways. It was just like that. And we’re fightin’ these vamps and they’ve got clown masks for some godforsaken reason and it’s going just fine. We’ve done this dozens of times. You know how it goes.”
Sure, he understood the concept. He’d seen it on TV, watched Sam and Eileen smile at each other across the table in the bunker, fingers constantly linked. He’d seen people in bars act like magnets as they got closer and closer and closer to each other, whispering in ears and hands making their ways slowly down closer and closer to reproductive organs.
“No, really. I don’t. I want Sam to be happy on Earth, more than anything. That’s- that’s all I wanted. For a long time.” He gazed off the porch blankly as he realized the harsh truth of that statement.
Heaven, and he still wasn't content. How fucking selfish could you be, he wondered, to be in eternal paradise and still not be at peace, still not feel at rest.
“Oh. Him.” Chuck yawned again, glowed a pale white, and within moments Jack stood there instead. Jack looked like Jack, not like how Not-Sam was a replica of Sam. Dean wanted to run to him but he knew it was Chuck there instead.
John waved him off. “Right. Anyways, I’m pokin’ around and I realize I’m gonna need two pairs of eyes for this job and none of my contacts were that far north. So I figure Dean here, he’d just turned what? 12?”
Dean opened his eyes and let the tears fall silently. He pulled his hand into a fist, letting the little nubs of his fingernails dig into his palm.
It’s not that he planned on being unhappy specifically, but reaching personal contentment wasn't exactly something he had ever visualized fitting on the roster. He’d stopped treating happiness like a given long ago.
He took another sip. “And that’s exactly what it tastes like! It’s fantastic and makes no sense. But there's.” He paused again. “There's something missing.”
“No, no, no, let me explain. I know it sounds batshit, trust me I fuckin’ know, but let me explain.” He reached across the table to push out a chair for Bobby, gesturing at it wildly. Bobby got the idea and sat.
It felt strange, being reborn like this. It was his body, he knew that, but without the tattoos and the bruises and the wrinkles. It felt like someone went over him with a magic eraser, taking away his past and present in a single movement.
Not-Sam kept talking. “Honestly. I was worried this was too ambitious but come on, I had to try.” His face slipped into a sickly grin. His eyes burned white for half a moment, and Dean watched as his skin stretched and folded and melded into a new shape.
He threw his head back, a shot of whiskey already appearing in his hand. It tasted like what Cas smelled like.
Maybe just because Cas was already on his mind, but for just a second, the bunker flashed through his mind. He remembered Billie’s fist on the door, the panic in his lungs, Castiel’s gentle smile as he threw him into the wall.
“And she shows up, she sees Dean, she opens her mouth to scream, and I’m about to take the fucking shot when my hands just. Freeze up. It was too damn cold and I couldn't pull the trigger.”
Mary Winchester was standing in his kitchen, frying up bacon like there wasn't a problem in the world. “You're up!” She cried happily. “Hope we didn't spook you, sweetie.” She smiled again, tilted her head at Dean as her blond hair glowed in the sunlight.
Not-Sam scowled and sucked through his teeth. “I thought I went too forcefully on the heavenly reinvention thing. Honestly, I really debated it.”
Jo waved him over. Dean grinned. He’d seen her a few times since he’d came back, but seeing her never failed to make him a little giddy. Not the kind of giddiness a teenager gets when they see their crush or anything. He didn't think of her romantically, not anymore. Maybe once, years ago. Back when he was 20 years younger and had seen seven fewer apocalypses.
If John Winchester taught him anything, it was that happiness was a temporary vice. A vixen that seduced you until you were at your most vulnerable, and then it left you gutted and bleeding out on cold concrete.
“But Cas you were right. You were so right. I had let anger fuel me for so long. And it wasn't fair to you, or Sammy, or anyone else. I hated what I had become. I was so much like-” his voice cracked. “Like my father. And after you. After you said what you said I knew I couldn't be that person anymore.” Dean sighed. “I’m sorry.”
Dean was in the impala again. He didn't remember leaving Harvelle’s. He didn't remember finishing his conversation with his dad. He was just
Instead, he thought about other things. The warmth he felt when Jack wanted to wear matching ties, the buzzy sensation he felt when he drank enough of a liquor store, the cozy familiarity of his trench coat. He thought about Dean’s smile and his worn leather jackets. He thought about Sam’s face when he saw Eileen. And then, he thought about nothing at all.
to be in the empty, but after Jack’s little temper tantrum the empty has been a bit, well, weakened. There's some cracks in the walls. And she won't cooperate with me.” He slammed a foot against the floor angrily, like a child throwing a fit.
“Two songs you don’t usually think about but know have played. Dean, they just played because you missed the people they remind you of.”
Maybe it was because everything here was still partially built from memory. It’s how the food could taste how it did- everything connected back to his life on Earth. The people he met, the places he saw, the beer he drank, it was all a messy web right back to forty one years of living-breathing-earth-dwelling Dean Winchester.
“You hit me.” Dean interjected. “It was not a perfect shot. It grazed my neck, I still have the scar.”
But why would he be sent a song about atheism and the romance of rebellion? He was in Heaven. There was a God- he’s a four year old named Jack. And for the romance of rebellion, well. He’d passed up his shot at that already.
He was gone. Castiel was gone. He wasn't in this place, for some reason or another, and he was gone.
“Cas, uh. I hope you can hear me.” He cleared his throat awkwardly and opened his eyes, tilting his head to gaze at the ceiling. “I’m sure you can. I know you can. Uh. This is my,” he paused, trying to remember. His brain felt fuzzy. “Eighth?”
“That’s exactly what I mean, yes.” Bobby took a longer overly dramatic drink. Dean wasn't looking at him but he knew his eyes were probably rolling.
Chuck laughed, hysteria dripping into his voice. “You know,” he said, “You’ve always been so easy to predict. It’s always Dean and his daddy issues ready to sacrifice himself for the world.” His voice slipped mockingly. “But that angel! You wouldn't have jackshit without Castiel and you can trust me on that one. I can never predict his bullshit.”
But this face? This wasn't Sammy. It looked like someone was wearing a Sam-suit, trying to replicate his movements and stand like he would.
He spat on the ground. “That’s what I get for building this place so close to the empty.” He shook his head. “Who would've known there was so little real estate left for new dimensions? Honestly. Pricing these days. It’s ridiculous.”
Dean dragged his bloody fingers across the cement quickly, trying to draw the sigil as quickly as possible. He knew the sigil like it was a part of him, etched to his bones.
“But I snapped today, at the roadhouse. Dad was telling some story about the first time he took me hunting as a kid, and I just, I couldn't hear it.”
Dean hadn't realised how far away from him everyone had moved, their chairs crowded together tightly. “I’ve survived worse. You know that. Every single one of you has. I just-” He paused. “I couldn't do it anymore. So you’re right dad, I got my hero’s death. Went out in the heat of fucking battle, huh?”
Sometimes, it flitted by so quickly he couldn't believe it, other times he felt like he was fighting his way through weighted air. “Eighth” He said it with certainty this time, “time praying to you since I got here.”
Dean felt like his entire body was being consumed in a wall of mist. “Give in,” Chuck whispered. “Don’t you want it all to be over? Again? No angst, no pain.”
“No. We didn't. It was nice, actually. They seem.” Dean paused for a second, trying to pick the word. “At peace.”
“I don’t,” Dean choked, “I don’t understand why’d you do that for me. I told you, I’ve been thinking. I was so shitty to you near the end.” His face was becoming wet. He threw his hands up in the air. “I told you that you were dead to me I mean-” he took a deep breath, running his fingers through his hair. “I don’t understand how you could see past any of that. I wouldn't have. I couldn't have.” He chuckled humorlessly. “You shouldn't have.”
A silence had fallen over the table, only broken by the clinking of John’s fork on his plate. Mom wasnt eating, and Dean was starting to dully wonder why when she spoke up.
He hoped they were together now. Sam and Eileen. He knew Sammy had been waiting to see her after Jack brought her back. He spent a lot of time being worried about Dean, right after it all ended. Dean pretended not to notice.
Dean was a mess. He ran a hand over his stubble self-consciously as his foot started tapping out of anxious habit. This was good, he told himself. This was nice.
And so, when he was running through the halls of the bunker with Dean from Billie, a familiar fear filled him. He knew this could be the one. For either of them, maybe even both. Billie was not forgiving, especially not of the eldest Winchester. So when they ducked into that room, when the door slammed and Billie shrieked in anger, Cas knew what he had to do.
Bobby sighed again. “Just yesterday, right before whatever glitching happened, you told me you were bored. You missed working.
Dean almost threw himself into the kitchen, heart hammering,  ready to grab the paring knife that he knew he’d left on the nearest counter when he was greeted by a smiling face.
He sat on the cliff face, gazing off into the sunset. A gentle breeze filtered through his hair. He closed his eyes.
, John had assured Dean with a slap on the back) and left behind a small cloud of dust. Dean had stood there for a moment, watching the dust particles hover in the sunlight.
He took a quick bite of sausage. He couldn't explain how, but he knew he’d had this exact sausage before. There was something there, some happy memory, some brand of nostalgia. He closed his eyes, trying to place it exactly. He thought he remembered Vegas and blue eyes, but he was interrupted by John chuckling.
Dean gazed down at him, his green eyes crinkled with concern and fear and something Cas had not seen in them before. Time had clearly passed. There was some silver mixed into his hair now. The lines around his eyes were more set than before. Cas numbly wondered if he had changed too.
The second thing he learned was that there wasn't really google in Heaven. If you asked a question, like “Who invented air conditioning?”, a book with the answer would appear in your hands (So in the case of air conditioning, you’d probably get a biography of Willis Carrier. You might also get a magazine detailing Frederick Jones’ discoveries, and then a shit load of printed blog posts detailing the controversy.)
“I heard you had breakfast with the folks this morning!” Bobby shouted down at Dean as he walked up the front steps.
And just like the other day with Come on Eileen, the song began to stretch and lengthen. It felt like it was being pulled apart and patched together again with static crowding the gaps between song and void. For a second, it was quiet.
He put his hand down on the stone, fingers splayed out as wide as they could get, and he closed his eyes, reaching, searching, fucking praying that somewhere here he would feel the angel’s presence, feel his eyes, feel his influence. It had to be somewhere. If Cas helped, Dean would find exactly where he was responsible for and he’d let the energy wash over him, claim him, seep into his bones.
The song was clear in it’s messaging- Heaven wasn't real, in order to exist as a free persona one must shed the cage of religion and stop living for an afterlife that wouldn't exist. It was a love song, Dean thought with a small smile, to rebellion and to those you rebel with.
Dean felt tears welling up behind his eyelids. There was no feeling here. There was no gentle touch, no aura of love, no smell of pine and nutmeg. Cas hadn't done this. Cas hadn't been here.
Yes, there was a time where he loved Dean, every part of him. He loved learning about humans, about kindness and persistence and rebellion. He adored Dean’s irrational affection for a car. But overall, he loved how the man remained so selfless. He’d try and hide it. He’d pretend there was always some other selfish motivator behind his actions, but there wasn't. He would build up a wall for him to hide behind, but even when hell raged in his mind or the world turned against him, he tried so hard to be good.
Dean could feel some weird anxiety growing within him as he tried to explain. He wished Sam was here. He’d know what to say. “Just. This. All of this. Something hasn't been right since I got here and this-” he pointed at the scattered pages, “Is why. It’s telling me how to fix it, Bobby.”
He sighed. “I’m wasting your time. I know I am. You’ve got universes to rebuild or whatever. I just. I really need you, man. I’m not right when you aren't around.”
“Dad, you brought it up at our truly lovely family get together the other day. Say it.” His voice was loaded with venom. It felt good.
A silence filled the room. It was deafening. “I uh. I know you probably don't wanna talk to me. It’s why you haven't. Responded. Yet.” The silence expanded. Dean felt sweaty.
He waits in darkness now. The darkness is better then when the empty turn’s its attention on him, making him relive regrets and guilt and horror. In the darkness, sometimes, he forgets who he is.
For a while, the thing most akin to god in his life was his own father- commanding and strict and all-knowing. John Winchester could define what was sin and what was sacrifice and demand them both in a single fell swoop. He’d tell Dean to repent and he would. For years, that’s what Dean Winchester was- a loyal soldier, a holy weapon, the one believer in his father’s church.
Dean shook his head. “It’s not more complicated than that. It’s not. I saw my shot and I fucking took it. As soon as that rebar hit I decided I was done. No ambulance, no angels, no cheats, nothing. I wanted out”
He remembered Cas’s love for mountain overlooks. Again and again on long haul trips to rural destinations, Cas would lean over from the backseat and ask to pull over and look out at the mountains and the trees and the light. Dean would watch the sunset reflect in Cas’s eyes, the golden glow enveloping the angel.
“... Holy crap.” He inched closer, ignoring the urge to reach out and touch, opting for reaching the angel instead. He knelt in front of Castiel, wonder plastered all over his face.
“What d'you mean 'and no'?” Castiel looked down at the motel carpet, now trying to avoid the piercing green gaze that seemed to bore straight into him. “Cas, what d'you mean?” Dean's hand gently gripped the angel's chin, lifting his head so they were looking straight at each other.
“Thanks.” He cleared his throat and tried to shake off the nervousness that seemed to have settled in his chest from nowhere. “So, yeah. I've been thinking. What if I decided that... That I don't want to get rid of the wings? I mean, I'm still me, I can still hunt, I can get used to them being there-” Castiel cut off his rambling with another kiss, but this time Dean could feel the passion behind it that wasn't there last time, the longing that seemed to cross over. Both hands cupped Dean's face as he tried to express as much emotion as possible through the simple act, only pulling away when Dean tapped him on the arm.
“Air. I need…” He swallows, putting a hand over his mouth as he waves frantically at the door with his other. Sam’s eyes go wide as he flings his door open, wrenching the rear door open just in time for Dean to drag himself out and promptly vomit on the side of the road. Sam steps back just in time to avoid his shoes getting splattered, unable to keep the disgusted look off his face at his brother emptying his stomach just inches away. Castiel joins him, lending a hand to Dean as he pulls the rest of himself out of the Impala, careful to avoid standing in his own mess as he lets a full body shiver work its way over him. He sighs as he stands, stretching his arms above his head and letting his wings out as far as they’ll go before bringing them back to a relaxed position behind him, taking in great lungfuls of air.
“Hey, Cas… Can you smell that?” Confusion crossed both Sam and Castiel’s features as they turned to Dean, wings now in a more relaxed position behind him.
it.” Castiel clicked his fingers, a small flame appearing as he watched the light dance before letting it go out. “And I didn’t think when she’d gone - I needed to make sure you were okay, even if I was still covered in flames.”
“Shh… It’s okay.” Dean releases his hands in favour of stroking soothing patterns into Castiel’s fur as he whines again, equal parts of despair and yearning washing over the Empath - he can’t help the single tear that rolls down his cheek, wiping it away before Castiel has a chance to see it. He blinks, looking towards the ceiling as he wills more errant tears to stay exactly where they are, letting out a slow, drawn out breath as he tries to calm himself down.
Dean gave him a flat look, rolling his own eyes this time. He stood slowly, stretching as he did so before turning to the island in the middle of the kitchen. Castiel titled his head in confusion as he reached for a herb above his head, gracefully throwing it in to a large mixing bowl before reaching up for another one.
“It may be better if you go first. The words aren’t exactly wards, but they will cause us less harm if a human passes through first and breaks the barrier.” Sam squints at the door in all its plain glory, shrugging as he moves to push it open with the barrel of his gun. Nothing screams out at him as out of place, motioning for Dean and Castiel to follow as he holds the door open. He furrows his brow in confusion as they both visibly pale as they pass him, looking back at the door again with curiosity as it silently closes behind them.
"Cas..." Dean made an 'up' motion with his arms, and Castiel's expression turned to one of alarm. He didn't know how to deal with human children, but he had a rough idea of how to deal with fledglings, so he picked Dean up, holding him awkwardly. Dean squirmed until Castiel held him properly, noting how much more comfortable it made holding him. Dean looked up at Castiel, who still looked panicked, and gently headbutted the angel's chest in a comforting gesture.
Castiel slowly came too, muscles he didn't even realise he had aching. He tried to move but pain racked his body, stiffening again as a voice he didn't recognise wriggled it's way through his addled brain. It spoke in hushed tones, unaware that Castiel was conscious.
Weeks had slowly turned in to months; the leaves from Autumn disappearing under a blanket of snow that had allowed the new fresh blossoms to adorn the trees, the beginning of longer days brightening Castiel’s spirits after an interesting winter. He stared out of the kitchen window, allowing the steam from his morning coffee to swirl as he absentmindedly drew patterns in the air, the steam following the actions of his fingers. A chuckle from behind him almost drew him out of his reverie, allowing a small smile to settle on his face before joining his hands together around the mug, the steam dissipating in to the air.
growl at me, ungrateful dog." The fireball barely missed Castiel's head, getting close enough to singe some of his hair as he darted out of the way as quickly as his ankle would let him. He scrambled for the door, fireball after fireball leaving scorch marks on the walls as he dodged them, just about managing to grab his coat from the hook as he wrenched it open. He briefly looked back, the furious look on Naomi's face etching itself into his brain as she threw the final fireball after him, shifting just in time for it to go over his head and smack in to the gate. The force knocked it open, and Castiel ran. He made a beeline for the forest, zig-zagging through trees to make it harder for anyone to follow him, not caring where he went so long as it took him further away from Naomi and her fireballs. His lungs burned with the effort of running so fast for so long, his head feeling fuzzy from not taking in enough oxygen, his ankle probably irreparably damaged. A deep rumble spurred him onwards, only briefly noticing that the forest floor had given way to tarmac before returning his attention back to just
"I dunno… One hell of a busted ankle, something's up with their ribs but I won't know if they're broken or just bruised until they wake up. Wait…" Hands brushed over a small area of his head before freezing. "Dude, some of the fur on their head is fucking
Dean’s knuckles go white as he grips the collar still around Castiel’s neck, the metal cold in his hand. Something other than the made up name catches his eye, turning it over as a cold shiver runs down his spine.
Castiel stands again, shaking loose fur off himself as he stares down Naomi. The confused look on her face briefly morphs in to one of terror before settling back on confused; Castiel taking a step towards her as she unconsciously takes a step back. He glances down at himself, blue flames running up his legs as he stands straight, allowing the flames to engulf him before taking another step forward. He can feel the sensation of flames on his fur, looking down again before closing his eyes. The change back to human form takes less than a second, opening his eyes again to look down on Naomi, flames still coating his skin. He reaches out, clicking his fingers as she trembles in place.
Cas trailed his lips up Dean’s jawline towards his ear and whispered, “But you’ll regret it when this spell wears off.”
“Great,” Dean muttered, and as he held his hand up to knock on the door again, the door flew open, revealing a short, gray haired woman.
They pulled up to a small stone house and parked. Evidently this was the home of a woman who owned a small antique shop that the last victim had visited just before she’d died. The sun was setting in the distance, falling to the earth and splattering a beautiful mix of orange and pink hues, and Dean had a vision of him and Cas watching the sunset together, his arm around Cas as he nestled under Dean’s arm. His heart ached, almost painfully, and he clutched at his chest at the vision. Longing and sorrow filled his soul and left him feeling empty. Was this his vision or Cas’? They were so intertwined now that he had no idea, but when he looked to his right and saw Cas staring at him with a look of what seemed to be shame etched across his face, he realized it must be coming from Cas. He bit the inside of his jaw, realizing it was just the spell and that was why Cas looked ashamed at what was crossing his mind. He had no control over what was going on between them. Cas began to take a step towards Dean, probably to apologize again he assumed, when Sam opened the car door and got out, eying them both.
They rode in the buggy for another fifteen minutes as the horse wove them in and around traffic along the snow covered rode. Cas would point at certain lights that would catch his eye and would occasionally discuss what he liked and disliked about how humans celebrated Christmas. Dean found himself nodding and half listening, sidetracked by the spark of excitement in Cas’ eyes and the cozy warm feeling as they sat close in the buggy.
“Because you only have two options right now. Tell me how to end the spell and there’s a chance I’ll let you live. Or, don’t tell me and I won’t hesitate to kill you.” He cocked his head and shrugged. “You have a 50/50 chance.”
“Dean, he just cooked us breakfast last week,” Sam stated as he took a seat across from Cas, eying his plate of food.
Sam gave Cas an exasperated look as he stood on the bottom step, and when he noticed he was staring at Dean’s ass, he rolled his eyes. Cas just shrugged as if to say, “What?”, as he continued to stare at Dean. Sam huffed, threw his hands up, and said, “Fine, Dean, whatever. But, I don’t want to hear you crying if you’re heart explodes or something.”
Cas looked at him and said, “Well, it is better than walking through all these woods. Plus, it will be faster.”
They started walking down the path towards a small stream. Dean leaned down and washed his hands and face off before cupping the water in his hands and drinking. Cas mimicked Dean, and when they were done, they turned to find their unicorn waiting for them.
Cocking his head to the side to study the animal, Cas said, “It appears to be a… unicorn.” The horse let out a whinny as if in agreement and reared up into the air. When all four feet were on the ground, it walked calmly to them and stopped directly in front of Cas, lowering its head. A note was attached to its horn and Cas reached out and pulled the post it note free. “Your ride,” he read out loud.
The bird cocked its head, one beady eye studying them, as it calculated its next move. It flew down a few feet above their heads, but not close enough for them to reach it.
Cas looked up at him and nodded. “I would assume if there is a way in, then there should be a way out.” Seeing Dean’s eyes fix on him, he said, “What?”
The waitress brought their food and gave Cas a flirty smile before turning to leave. Cas shot Dean a look and asked, “Dean, can you pass the salt?”
“Do I have ‘Chef Dean’ written across my forehead? But, if it’s that big of a deal, Sam, I’ll make you eggs, too.”
“She’s anxious and frightened which means something is coming,” Cas said, letting his blade drop from the sleeve of his trench coat.
Keeping his eyes on the road, he waited for Cas to continue, but suddenly cheese puffs were flying in his face and he caught sight of Cas in his peripheral vision, flailing his hands around, yelling, “Dean! Dean!”
“I’m not sure, but I have a feeling we will find out soon enough,” Cas said, as he tossed a look over his shoulder.
Thirty minutes later, they were lying on their backs, staring up at the stars in the sky. Cas had one leg draped over Dean’s, his bare foot constantly rubbing against his, and every once in a while he would brush against a sensitive spot that tickled. Dean would jerk back and Cas would smile but wouldn’t stop. Dean’s hair had grown out enough that Cas was able to twirl strands around his fingers. As he did this, he hummed a soft tune in his ear. It wasn’t lost on him that it was always a Led Zepplin song, which tugged at Dean’s heart.
Dean sighed, feeling ridiculous at his earlier thoughts. “Nothing. I just thought…” He paused and looked away.
Dean smiled and pulled Cas in for another kiss, liking the fact that he could freely do so now without needing an excuse.
“His favorite is the sunrise special, so he’ll have that,” Dean broke in, giving Cas a wink. “Isn’t that right, Sunshine?”
A smirk appeared on Cas’s face when he said, “Well, it’s better late than never. Isn’t that, uh, what people generally say?”
“Very much so. I now know all the words to every song on there.” Cas took a seat on the bed as he began mouthing the words to the song while nodding his head.
“We’ll what?!” Dean exclaimed, but when he looked into Cas’ face and remembered how excited he had been to celebrate his first Christmas, he knew he would be riding home with that damn tree strapped to Baby’s hood. “Fine, Cas,” he relented with a sigh.
“Yes, it was, Dean,” Cas agreed, giving him another kiss before collapsing on the bed next to him. He wrapped his arms around him and pulled him in close as he began absently running his hand through Dean’s hair.
Cas tilted his head to the side and said, “I didn’t say anything after I asked what was on the label.”
“You’re in a lot of pain. We need to do something to fix this,” Cas said as he pushed Dean backwards against the wall.
Dean gave him one last uncertain look before he gave in and scooted over, letting Cas envelope him into an embrace. He immediately felt his warmth. He closed his eyes as he felt his body begin to thaw and smiled when he felt Cas’s fingers trace the side of his bicep. The slow intensity of his fingers sliding up and down his arm began to lull him to sleep. His head began to fall and Cas situated him so that his head was lying in his lap. He felt long fingers slide through his hair as Cas began to play with his hair, and the soft humming coming from his chest made Dean relax even more. His eyes fluttered to the beautiful sunset for just a few seconds before closing.
“It’s about time, sleeping beauty. I thought I might have to come kiss you to wake you up or send Cas in to do it,” Sam said with a laugh.
“Shut up. I’m not bullshitting, Dean. A break will do you good. Sam will get here soon. Just hold on.”
“I. Well you know I get upset sometimes. And since you,” he paused. He still hated saying it. “Since the empty took you, I’ve tried really hard to keep my anger in check. I should’ve done it while you were here but I’m trying now.”
‘Better then how I went out, anyways. Goddamn deals. Never take the deal.” John was already moving on, grumbling as he reached for the syrup.
John guffawed with laughter. Someone knocked over a beer but it evaporated instantly, some sort of heavenly housekeeping service hard at work.
Castiel was hovering feet over the ground, wings iridescent and expanded at full length, glowing with silent power. He was facing Chuck-Not-Jack.
The world started to come back into focus while John cleared his throat and started talking. “Ooh, this is one of my favorites. Alright, so we’ve pulled up in Duluth and we’re hearing about some mysterious deaths. Multiple suicides, missing brains, self-help hotlines going cold. You know the type.”
His heart was catching up with the situation and beating, fast. He knew he was an adult, in size 10 boots and with graying hair, but some part of him still felt like a scared 11 year old, face already slightly downturned, waiting for the punch or the words. His shoulders were tense again, he was ready for the table to be thrown, for John to relentlessly mock his excuse, because even he knew it was weak.
“Because it’s not, now shut your face,” he said pointing his finger towards him. He looked at Cas who still had that adorably confused look on his face and said, “Cas, go get ready, we’ll leave in an hour.”
They rode their unicorn until the sun was threatening to fall behind the grass, eagerly searching for a way out. Dean was hoping to run into a portal of some kind, like they had found when they were in purgatory, but they had yet to find anything. The night was alive with frogs croaking, wolves howling, and other animals that they more than likely didn’t want to run into.
While Dean and Cas had been dealing with the effects of the spell, Sam had gathered all the information they needed to get a start on the case they were working on.
Dean paced the length of the hallway, listening to Cas in his bedroom as he talked on the phone with someone. With the softness in his voice and the flirty laugh here and there, it was obvious he was talking to the girl from the library. The extravaganza was only a few days away, and Cas had already been fussing over what he should wear, and Dean swore that if he came into his room one more time to ask if the outfit in question looked good, he’d throw his beer bottle against the wall and scream.
“Dean, it’s beautiful,” Cas whispered. His lips brushed against the side of Dean’s neck when he spoke, and he thought about moving, but he stayed put like Dean had asked him to.
Dean walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist. His chin dropped to Cas’s shoulder as he took in the view. “This place isn’t so bad,” Dean mused as he gave Cas a gentle squeeze.
Dean popped the top off his beer and said, “Oh, well, I already took care of that for you. I told her you couldn’t go.”
They heard hoof beats thundering towards them as the animal got closer, and suddenly a white horse pushed through the roses and came completely into view, coming straight at them. “It’s not slowing down.” Cas’s voice didn’t waver, but his hand fisted tightly into Dean’s shirt as he prepared to fight for him.
There was a hint of embarrassment hiding in his voice and Dean couldn’t help but think how cute it was. “You can borrow mine. There’s sweat pants and a t shirt in the dresser.”
“She comes into my store every once in awhile. Is she okay?” the woman asked. “She seemed like a nice enough girl, I’d hate for anything bad to happen to her.”
“I…I don’t know. But I’m here now,” Dean said and then leaned in and kissed him. His kiss was gentle and tasted like remorse and forgiveness. Dean grabbed his trench coat and pulled him closer, needing to feel the warmth of his body against his. After a moment he pulled back and said, “I’m sorry for how I acted that night, Cas. I just, I wanted it to be something you wanted, too.”
“Oh, okay. Well, I have a case for us tonight. We’re meeting a girl at eight. She says her house is haunted. Sam’s on a hunt with mom right now, so I was wondering if you could come with me?”
Cas fidgeted in the passenger seat, not sure how to deal with the current situation he’d just gotten them in. Being human was proving to be more difficult than he’d imagined. He never thought once he became human that he would be on the klutzy side, but he’d been accident prone ever since he lost his grace. Now, they rode in awkward silence, doing their best to avoid any contact whatsoever. Cas hated it but he didn’t want to make Dean anymore flustered than he already was.
“Because you gave up everything for me, and if it weren’t for this spell, I probably never would’ve admitted to these feelings. And even with the spell, I was still pushing against them as much as I possibly could. It just doesn’t seem fair to you.”
The witch nodded and when Dean pulled back slightly, she uttered three words, releasing her hold on Sam and Cas. They both straightened, readying themselves to jump in and save Dean as he held the witch against the wall.
Heading towards the door, Dean paused, tilted his head back, and looked up at the ceiling. “Don’t ask.”
“No, it wasn’t some kinky foreplay,” Dean said as he leaned against the counter and crossed his arms.
Cas’ lips twisted to the side in a little smirk. “Well, not to sound egotistical, but I was referred to as the best looking Angel in the Garrison.”
He stopped in front of Cas, and with trembling hands, reached out and cupped his face. As he looked into Cas’ eyes, he didn’t see uncertainty, but rather knowing.
Shaking his head, Dean walked up to him and read what was on the front of the apron out loud. “Kiss the Cook.” He shrugged and said, “Okay, I can do that.” He leaned in and gave Cas a tender kiss. He pulled away and rested his forehead against his and said, “Don’t ever scare me like that again. Just tell me when you’re going out, okay.”
They rode with the icy air blowing in on them and the radio blasting for the remainder of the ride there. Cas’ fingers felt like they were developing frostbite and he noticed Dean’s lips were turning purple, but any thoughts they had remained on how cold they were, which he figured was Dean’s intention.
“Wait,” Dean cut in. His eyes shifted between the two before finally landing on Sam. He held up a finger, and said, “You knew it would work?”
Cas stared at the waitress, then to Dean, and then down at his menu, suddenly flustered himself. “Um…” he began, still scanning the menu. The wave of jealousy that was emanating from Dean was getting to him and he began to fidget with his collar again. He wished Dean would tell Sam about this spell so they could figure out how to end it. It could be any kind of spell. But they didn’t  know anything about it yet because Dean was being stubborn. For all they knew, it could have disastrous consequences.
“I just figured I’d take you. I wouldn’t mind seeing what it’s all about anyway,” he said, trying his best to sound casual. He took a sip of his beer, and seeing them both still staring, said, “What?”
“Um, okay,” Sam started, looking back and forth from Dean to Cas. “It looks like we know what to do now.”
Cas tilted his face up at him, his eyes questioning, and no coherent words would form in Dean’s mind. There was only the feel of Cas’ warm breath tickling his neck. There was only blue eyes finding his in the shadows of the buggy. And there was only the weight of Cas leaning across his thighs. He licked his lips, trying to refocus his thoughts, and when he dragged himself out of the haze of desire, he said, “Uh, yeah, Cas, anything you want.”
“Uh,” he cleared his throat. “Hey, Cas,” he finally said, the quiver in his voice was undeniable and he saw Cas’ eyes soften. He took a small step forward, hesitant and unsure as to how Cas would react, and whispered softly, “I’m home.”
Cas pulled back slightly as he studied Dean, hesitation and doubt filtered across his face, but then he began to lean in, his eyes fixated on Dean’s lips.
Cas quickly looked away and said, “Um, thank you.” He downed the shot, running a hand through his hair as the tension surrounding him began to suffocate him. It was jealousy that radiated in the air. From Dean as he glared at the bartender. His hand fell to his jacket and he began to unbutton a few top buttons, needing air to breathe.
Dean inched closer and said, “I don’t want to either but you have to fight this. For you, it’s just the spell. I don’t want to ruin anything between us, Cas.”
Cas smirked and said, “I wasn’t being completely honest with you, Dean. That date was just a sham. I was hoping you’d break it up.”
Just as they began walking, the screech echoed in the distance again. They stopped, hands held out as they waited for the bird to appear again. They heard the flap of wings before it flew into view.
The woman studied the picture and then nodded. “Yes. What has she done? Kids these days are just troublemakers anymore,” she said as she held the door open and motioned for them to come in.
Sam looked over his shoulder and smirked. “Yeah, he’ll be fine. I’ll find a cure for you guys and then you’ll be good as new,” he said as he pulled out his laptop and began searching.
“Sam, does this outfit look okay? Like, to, you know, impress the ladies?” Cas’ lips quirked up as he looked at Sam.
Sam looked up from his laptop when he heard the front door open and then his eyes widened when he saw their hands intertwined. A knowing smile slowly crept across his face as he said, “So, how’d this non-date go?”
He swallowed hard at those thoughts and said, “No, you’re doing great, buddy.” He always made sure to add in “buddy” as a way of diverting his trailing thoughts so no one could see his true feelings that lingered just below the surface.
He huffed, ran a hand through his hair, and went to turn for his own bedroom, but just as he whirled around, he came face to face with Sam staring blankly at him.
Dean gave a slight nod and Cas slowly removed his hands. They both calmly pulled out their weapons as they discreetly scanned their surroundings. It was hard to see with the sun almost gone now. The most they could make out were dark shadows dancing around the woods. As soon as Cas said, “To your left!” a large beast, resembling a black panther, jumped out of a line of trees and charged towards them. It drew back a large paw and swatted at Dean. He darted back and the cat just barely missed him.
He pointed at the horse and buggy and Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, sure,” he said, trying to hide his smirk.
Just as Cas ran towards Dean, the cat’s paw plunged into Dean, knocking him to the ground. The cat jumped on top of him and sank its teeth into his neck. The loud scream that Dean let out echoed throughout the night, piercing every ounce of Cas’s core, and he felt his heart ricochet in his chest. Cas dug his hands into the animal’s thick fur and, with all of his strength and then some, pulled the cat off of Dean. A beam of light from the bright moon that now hovered overhead shone down around them and Cas vaguely caught sight of blood pooling around Dean’s body, but his focus right now was to kill the animal. The anger that he felt surged through his body, making each vein ignite into a fiery, red glow. He wielded his blade and swung it out at the cat. The cat tried to swat the blade out of his hands, but Cas held onto it, striking its right leg. It hissed, baring its teeth and flattening its ears before lunging forward at Cas.
Cas tore his eyes from the ground and looked up at Dean, a pained look coating his face. “Dean, I’m not good with these human emotions,” Cas stated. “I’ve only experienced them completely once, when I was human. But the more I’m with you, the more I feel. And the feelings I have for you are not the same that I feel when I’m with Sam.”
Laughing, Dean wrapped his arm around Cas, pulling him close as he led him away from the ashes of denial. “Yes, Cas that’s what people say when someone shows up late to something.”
They parked Baby a few blocks away and began walking towards the main square. Christmas lights twinkled from small shops along the way and snow was lightly falling.
“What Agent Kilmer is trying to say, is that she was in fact murdered last night and we’re talking to the people who saw her last,” Dean corrected, giving Cas a look and thought,
“Okay, let me get onto the ice first so I can get my barrings, and then you can follow. Just hold onto the wall right here,” Dean said as he led Cas to the wall that lined the ice skating rink.
“What do ya think?” Dean asked when Cas finally made it, throwing his hands out at the view below them.
After a moment, Dean finally straightened. His eyes roved over Cas for a few beats before he said, “Why aren’t you in pain from this damn spell?”
Sam shot him an exasperated look. “Sure. What is going on with you? You’ve been on edge ever since you got here. And Cas is acting weirder than normal, too.”
They pulled into the parking lot of King’s Tavern and Dean felt his pulse racing through his body. He needed alcohol, like right now because he wasn’t feeling all that good anymore.
Dean leaned in close, his lips threatening to brush against the full lips that had always been a soft spot for him, and said, “What’s the matter, Cas? Am I invading
They were barely moving and Dean found himself staring down at their hands clasped together. He liked the feel of his hands wrapped around Cas’. Their hands fit together perfectly. It was such a perfect fit that it was hard to see any difference between Cas’ hands and his own. His eyes stared back at the man in front of him and he smiled at the look of sheer concentration on Cas’ face.
“Dammit, Dean,” Cas said, his voice was full of irritation but he also had a hint of a smile that he was trying not to show.
Once he got a grip on his laughter, he leaned in towards Cas and swiped along the top of his lip with his thumb. He paused, his thumb now resting on Cas’ cheek, as he stared into blue eyes that always seemed to pull him in. The sound of a loud bell chiming in the distance broke their connection, and he took a step back and said, “There, I got it.” He pulled his eyes from Cas’ and watched as the crowd began walking towards the square. “It looks like it’s time for the lights. This is what you were excited about, right?” Dean said as he draped his arm around Cas’ shoulders and urged him forward.
Dean’s eyes widened in panic. “No, Cas. I’m not afraid of being with you. I’m…” His eyes danced around. He was never good with expressing his feelings. “I’m afraid of losing what we have in this moment right now. How can we keep this when we’re always fighting to stay alive or trying to save people? Here, it’s just us. Back home, we’re hunters. Our love can be used against us even more now.” The more he talked about his feelings, the more he began to fidget. “I don’t know, man,” he started, and then shoved a hand in his hair in frustration. “Maybe we’re just kidding ourselves here.”
Dean reached for Cas’ hand and intertwined it in his own, a hesitant, but proud grin on his face. He wasn’t sure what Sam’s reaction would be, but knew he’d be supportive either way.
“Ah, you have a spell on you,” the woman stated. She leaned in and sniffed him as she looked him up and down.
The hoarse cries from Dean beckoned him to fight past the darkness that threatened to sweep him away. He began to fervently push against the monster with the little ounce of strength he had left, but the beast was enormous. He couldn’t heal himself while he was fighting to stay alive. He needed out from under the monster to be able to use his powers correctly. He winced when a loud pop exploded against his ears, and within seconds, he was nestled in a bed of ashes. He heard Dean clearly yelling his name now and felt hands gently rubbing against his face.
He helplessly watched houses and towns fly past the window, and an hour later they were slowing down on a quiet, dead end street that was lined with small cottage style houses. The cab came to a stop and he looked out the window to see a small, blue cottage style home. The front porch light was on as if the person was expecting someone. Dean frowned as he looked up at the house.
“I’m not feeling anything weird here, are you?” Cas asked as he leaned in and studied a painting of a head that was half horse and half tiger. He frowned as he studied it and then looked over at Dean.
“Yeah, fine,” he said as he took a seat across from Sam. He leaned back and kicked his feet up on the table, and just as he started to take a sip of beer, Cas walked through and headed towards Sam.
Sam laughed. “Okay, that would be weird, but I don’t see why that would make you not want to tell me.” He studied Dean for a moment and then said, “Unless there’s more? I mean, it doesn’t look like it’s hurting you or anything, right?”
With Cas’ body pressing against his, he swallowed hard, his eyes searching Cas’. He licked his lips and said, “I give myself over wholly to you, and only you, Cas.”
At the feel of his body pressing deeper into his, Dean glanced at Cas from the corner of his eye. This would be the moment that Dean would release his grip on Cas and continue walking with space between them, but he kept his arm around him this time, letting himself enjoy the moment. Plus, it helped that Cas didn’t seem to mind, if anything, he was melting into him even farther. Maybe he was cold, Dean thought, and pulled him in even closer. With Cas this close, he could smell the light honey scent of his shampoo and feel the day old stubble rub against his neck. He clenched his jaw at the feeling, knowing it would never be anything more than this right here. Cas was his best friend. He couldn’t cross that line with him. And, he was positive Cas didn’t feel the same way. Cas had plans with a woman tonight, not a man, and not him. Maybe he would rather have been with that, Stephanie or Sandra girl, whatever her name had been. That thought caused Dean’s grip around Cas to loosen.
Cas’ eyebrows drew in as he considered the question. “I’m not entirely sure, Dean. I feel the effects of the spell, but it’s not causing me pain as it is you.”
“We’d better do something before it kills our unicorn,” Dean said, and then gave Cas a nod as he took off in a run.
Dean stood and looked around, his tall frame tense and ready to fight. “Where the hell are we?” he wondered out loud.
They both looked up when they heard the door open. Cas came down the stairs, holding two sacks in each hand. He sat the sacks down on the counter and smiled wide as he walked up to Dean. He paused when he saw the look on his face. “What’s the matter? Did something happen?”
A low grumble came from Dean’s throat as he ran a hand through his hair, causing it to stand up in spots.
His door unlocked in a loud click and suddenly Dean was able to move. He rubbed his arm and cocked his head at the driver, the urge to kill this weird cab driver was gone and a sense of peace suddenly filled him. He turned to look at the house in front of him and saw a shadow through the window. He opened the door and stepped out just as the front door opened. He walked slowly to the steps and looked up, his breath catching in his throat as he came face to face with Cas.
Without a care or worry in his mind, he grabbed Cas’s hand, intertwined it within his own, and led him away from the scene.
“I was trying to get information from a ghoul when I heard your prayer.” Cas took a seat across from Dean, his eyes searching him for answers.
“Cas, you’re my soulmate, cursed or not,” Dean said quietly, taking his face in his hands. When he saw the doubt disappear, he leaned in, pressing his lips against his. “I’ll never deny you again, okay?” he whispered against Cas’ lips.
“And I got your eggs and bacon ready, just how you like them, sunny side up and the bacon extra crispy.” Dean gave him a grin as he sat a plate of food in front of him.
Dean pushed on the gas, his body buzzing with electricity every time his eyes found Cas, or he thought about him, or he heard Cas thinking about him. Okay, it seemed this spell was getting worse. More intense every second. He looked in his rear view mirror again, for some reason he wasn’t able to control the need to seek Cas out. As soon as Cas met his gaze, his body vibrated, a deep ache pulsated within him, not just in his bones, but down into his marrow. He quickly looked away, hoping the feeling would pass. But, it didn’t. He squirmed in his seat and sweat formed on his brow.
Cas took a sip of his beer, eying Dean over the bottle. Sitting the beer down, he said, “I’ll be fine, Dean. Anyway, it sounds like an easy case anyway. Plus, Sam is gone, so you’ll need back up. Despite the clumsiness, I do have my strength back now.” He paused for a moment and then with a tilt of his lips said, “Plus, maybe I’ll get to use my new salt gun tonight.”
Dean broke away from Cas’ stare. “Yeah. I’m fine. I think the spell is getting more intense. It’s hitting me, um, physically now.” He walked off and said, “It’s nothing I can’t handle though. Let’s go.”
Dean knew it was time to lay his feelings out there point blank. “Cas, you know when I said that I loved you too, that I meant it more than just as a brother, right?” He watched Cas for a minute, staring into his eyes and hoping that he saw the same love beneath their blue surface, hoping he had meant it the way he had. Hoping and praying he wasn’t wrong.
“So you’re saying we’re just going to return home and fall right back into the same old routine? When things get tough, you’ll disappear, and I’ll get angry and lash out at you? Well, that’s just great, Cas. That’s exactly what I’m talking about.”
“Ouch, that one hurt!” Dean yelled as he swung his pillow. He laughed when he felt it make contact against the side of Cas’s face.
“Dammit, where are you taking me?!” Dean shouted as he tried to fight against this strange force. He was completely helpless in the backseat of this cab that was being driven by some…some creature or something.
“Dean,” Cas began. His cheeks were flushed and he was breathing hard, his eyes dancing wildly around Dean’s face, seeking and searching for answers on how to respond to this whole scenario.
“There’s an empty field just on the other side of these - I imagine you’ll feel better there than at the side of the road where people might see us?” Castiel turns his head just enough for Dean to hear as he continues to walk forwards, holding a branch to one side as he motions again for the hunter to hurry up. Dean nods as he jogs to where Castiel is, looking around quickly as he ducks under the angel’s arm, trying his hardest not to catch his wings on any low hanging branches or anything else he can snag himself on. He shudders as he stands upright again, wings extending as far as they’ll go before shaking out any loose leaves that decided they were going to hitch a ride with him. He can feel Castiel’s smile before he turns back to the angel, his own greeting it before taking a deep breath.
After everything you’ve ever hunted, every Goddamn thing that’s wanted you dead, you get killed by a damn piece of
“Luckily, I think I have a way to find your brother now, but we need to move. If they're taking feathers like this one, then I have no doubt that these witches are attempting something big, and they need to be stopped.” He pocketed both feathers before handing the angel blade stake back to Sam. “This way.”
“Hey, ssh... It's okay, just gotta hit the head. Still got human stuff to do. You go back to sleep.”
“Do you feel better now?” Dean nods once in Castiel’s direction, eyes closed as he lets the small breeze cool the sweat on his forehead. His hand has found itself entwined with Castiel’s again, partly for stability but mostly for comfort as the angel gives it a reassuring squeeze.
"... What?" He moved his hand away, shifting so he was sat directly ahead of where Castiel was lay. "You… First words I hear from you, and they're
“Sounds like a plan.” Castiel smiled again as he turned away, only just catching the way Dean let out a slow breath as he crossed the threshold from the kitchen. The mild bravado from the kitchen slipped as nervousness briefly overtook him, shaking his head as he absentmindedly fluffed up a cushion. He’d heard nothing but good things about Sam and his Familiar Eileen; it had been his suggestion to meet them and give them the news that Dean had finally found some rudimentary magic. He couldn’t wait to see the look on their faces, providing Dean got over his own nervousness as well. Castiel sighed, slowly coming back to the moment as he placed the cushion back on the sofa, moving to pick up the next one along before stopping. He squinted as he tilted his head, the corner of a book sticking out from underneath the sofa, kneeling as he pulled it from its hiding place. Something about it screamed familiar in the back of his mind, frown deepening as the why stayed stubbornly just out of reach. He turned it over slowly as he stood, working his way back to the kitchen as he turned it over again.
“Hmmm...” Castiel shifted, adjusting the grip he had on the pillow before settling again, a light snore escaping that signalled to Dean the angel was asleep again. Dean smiled, shaking his head before standing. He stretched, shoulders popping and wings extending, almost brushing the curtains before Dean realised how far out they'd gone.
“I’m still pissed it happened the way it did… But there’s nothing I can do about it now. It felt... Final... Not like the last however many times. Like you said, I’ve got enough time to make my peace with it though.” He shrugged as he finished the last of the bottle, gently setting it down as he leant back again in the chair. He couldn’t help the deflated sigh that escaped as he looked back towards Bobby, the look of disbelief on his face a surprise.
“I’d better go see what I can do to calm him down a bit - I don’t want him ruining today for you.” She paused in the doorway, turning back to give Dean another soft smile. “And Dean?”
He stands taller over Dean, trying to make it as clear as possible by body language alone that he isn’t leaving. What he doesn’t expect is the laugh that comes from Naomi, head tilting in confusion.
“They say otherwise... Sweetheart. So does that grace leaking out of you.” Dean grimaced, the grip on his throat tightening as the witch stepped closer. “And those feathers are exactly what we need. So we're going to take them. One. By. One.” Fear gripped him as she released his throat, moving away from his face and towards the right wing. Something shiny caught his attention, and his stomach dropped further as he realised she had pulled another angel blade from somewhere.
“Don’t antagonise your brother while he’s still getting to grips with his grace. He could very well smite you, even if that’s the furthest thing from him wanting to do.” Sam’s eyebrows somehow end up closer to his hairline, casting a quick glance back at Dean, a smirk on his face at the information. “It’s not uncommon in fledglings when they first find their grace to have no control over it and do catastrophic things by accident.” Colour drains from Sam’s face as he stares at the steering wheel, nodding once before starting the Impala and slowly pulling away from the motel. Castiel offers Dean a small smile before turning his attention back out the windshield, closing his eyes as the rumble of the engine lulls him into a meditative state.
“His grace is very low... I think smiting that witch took a lot more out of him than he anticipated it doing.” Castiel softly ran his fingers over Dean’s face before standing upright again, ignoring the confused look on Sam’s face. “We need to get him out of here before the rest of the coven come to investigate the screaming, and the light. I don’t imagine they’ll be too happy to find another dead member in this warehouse.” Sam nodded, putting the soft touch to the back of his mind to ask about later.
“I’ve already taken enough from him, don’t you think? That can remain his, and his alone.” The tone of Castiel’s voice offers no room for argument, Dean nodding sheepishly before his gaze drops to the table. He just about hears the sigh come from the former angel, looking up again to find him staring deeply into his mug.
“And pray tell, where have these illusions come from? I made sure you had a roof over your head, fed you, looked after you all these years… And this is how you decide to repay me? By being
"Wove you, Cas." He faltered. Words that as a normal human would never have passed the hunter's lips said so freely as a small fledgling, and they tugged on Castiel's heartstrings. Words that meant so much to the older angel, that he knew would never be said once Dean was fixed. Castiel gave Dean an almighty squeeze, kissing the top of his hair before finding the courage to return the words.
“You’re making this much harder than it has to be…” Castiel yelps as one of the fireballs catches his tail, pointedly ignoring the way Naomi’s face lights up at finally hitting her target. “
"Cas?" Dean stared up at Castiel with wide eyes, drawing him out of the memories of the first day and night of Dean being a fledgling, and Castiel automatically picked him up.
Naomi falters, Castiel only just catching the look on her face before it’s schooled back in to perfect neutrality again.
“Whatever. She was here, I could feel her… She-” Dean didn’t notice Castiel stand, placing a hand on his arm where he had accidentally burnt through his jacket.
Back.” Her features are schooled to neutrality, Dean almost missing the small sneer that crossed her face at having to tell a stranger that Castiel was hers. He shakes his head, making sure not to break eye contact as he looks back at her.
“Yes. That's the only place where anything has been disturbed, and the powder is the same as when we killed the original witch.” Sam nodded, looking back to the ledge. There didn't seem to be anything special about the powder other than its colour, giving off no smell or any other indicators that would lead him to think it was. He sighed, the lack of information starting to annoy him, adding to his frustration that somewhere Dean was being held captive with God-knows-what happening to him.
"Dean... Your questions are distracting, and you do not want to be like this forever, do you?" Dean shook his head, not turning around. "Just an hour without any questions, and then I will answer any and all questions until they meet your satisfaction." Castiel turned back to the book he had been reading, listening intently for the noise of Dean unfolding his wings.
. We’ll find him.” Dean growled, wings puffing up more than Sam had seen so far, feathers quivering with anger. He couldn’t stop the grace from showing in his eyes, Sam taking a subconscious step back at the way his brother was behaving.
“I-” Dean turned away, coughing as he cleared his throat. “I’m good. I’ll give you a nudge if I need anything?”
"But, nothing, Dean Winchester. I am trying to undo what the witch did, and until then, I do not expect the Righteous Man to be acting like a spoilt fledgling!" If possible, Dean's pout got larger, turning away from Castiel and wrapping his wings around himself defensively. Castiel sighed.
"... You're not a normal dog, are you?" Castiel rolled his eyes. The only way he could respond properly to this stranger was if he had any magic, and Castiel couldn't feel anything coming from him. He looked again at the stranger; their eyes furrowed in confusion, waiting on an answer. He lifted his head off his paws, shaking his head as best as he could before setting down again with another huff. The stranger inched closer, looking for permission to do so first, leaning closer with interest.
His eyes stay closed as he feels Castiel’s head lift off his legs, a small grunt escaping as he rests it on his chest instead.
You can always come shout at me on tumblr if you want (username is the same as here), if there's anything you want to shout at me about, story related or not :)
“I… I understand, Dean.” Sam made a fake gagging noise, earning him glares from both Dean and Castiel as both their wings settled.
Uh… Maybe somewhere large, open… Somewhere you can still keep an eye on me.” Castiel shudders, the memory of Naomi finding him again sending shivers down his spine. “I don’t want a repeat of last time.”
“See something you like?” Castiel smiled coyly behind his mug, giving Dean an innocent look as he opted to take another sip rather than answer straight away. “What’ve you got going on up in that head of yours, hmmm?”
“Uh, yeah. All good?” Castiel nodded, smiling as he sat next to Dean again, ignoring the blush that crossed his cheeks as their thighs touched. Dean looked at his hands for a few seconds before looking back towards Castiel, one hand gravitating again to the back of his neck as he struggled to find words.
“Cas - I promise you’re not gonna lose me, okay? You’ve got me.” Castiel yelps as Dean pulls him closer until their noses are almost touching, Castiel sprawled over Dean, unable to help the soft smile that seems to have made a permanent home on his face.
“Promise.” The smile on Dean’s face warmed Castiel, another small bundle of flowers springing up beside them as his tail began to pick up speed. “Now come on. Let’s go home.”
“Hey.” Castiel’s voice is quiet as he lifts Dean’s face to meet his own, the softness of it making Sam turn away to give them as much privacy as the side of the road can allow. “Everything you’ve done so far has defied expectations, every obstacle you’ve overcome with ease. This isn’t going to be any different, because you’re
“It’s no problem Cas. Now, c’mon.” Dean pulls away, clapping his hand to Castiel’s shoulder. “I want to get that door hung again before someone comes wondering what the hell happened.”
“This is, uh, really touching, but we need to get out of here. Now. Witches?” Dean steeled himself as he nodded, wings settling in a defensive position that matched Castiel’s, marching forward slightly before turning back.
Castiel didn’t expect Dean to come to his level, placing a soft kiss on his head before resting their foreheads together, gently grasping Castiel’s head between his hands. The tenderness of the action almost dropped the Familiar where he stood, pure joy radiating between their bond as Dean spoke gently in return.
Castiel moved round the sofa, settling beside Dean as a hand came to rest in his fur. He glared at the book, tilting his head at it before nudging it cautiously with his nose.
“Yes. I told you it was nothing special, I’m just a man.” Castiel looked at his lap, not noticing the way Dean gave him a quick once over.
“I think I messed it up.” The words are coughed out as Castiel kneels down in front of the hunter, giving him a quick once-over as he assesses the damage. There’s a brief sigh of relief as nothing else seems injured - or at least not too badly - before both their attention is brought back to Dean’s wing as he makes a small groan of pain.
Dean had lost count of how many miles he’d travelled, how often the scenery had changed around him as he pushed onwards. The only saving grace he had found was that at least he hadn’t needed to stop for fuel; being pulled towards a still unknown destination that had his heart fluttering whenever he stopped to think about it for too long. He didn’t know why he was nervous, fingers dancing across the steering wheel as he took deep breaths to try and calm himself down. He hadn’t realised he’d stopped driving either as he came to rest his head between his hands, catching the horn and jumping as the noise took him by surprise, cursing as his head connected with the roof of the Impala.
Cas, I- The-” Castiel laughs, shaking his head as he turns in to the bathroom while Dean looks at him with a puzzled expression.
“No. The sooner you accept that, the quicker we can get back to the Bunker.” Dean sighed, dragging a hand down his face before squaring his shoulders.
The drive back to the bunker is as uneventful as it can be after the quick detour to pick Dean and Castiel’s things up from the motel. Castiel only receives the slightest of raised eyebrows as he hands the keys back to Reception, shrugging as best he can with hands full of two bags before turning and walking back to the Impala. He can feel Dean’s grumbling before he’s even got back to where they’re parked; knowing that the drive back is going to take longer just so he can unfold himself from the back seat to stretch his currently cramped wings out at least once. Castiel remembers how confining it was, stuck in what was essentially a tin can while parts of him
“It’s no big deal, y’know? You need to eat, and I don’t mind cooking.” Dean runs his hands through his hair, turning to plate himself up a burger. “If it helps get you back on your feet some more, you can have as many burgers as you want.” Castiel nudges Dean’s leg before moving out of the kitchen, sitting back down with a content sigh in front of the fireplace. The fullness he feels from the food has him feeling drowsy, only just hearing the chuckle from Dean as he moves in to the room himself before dozing off again.
“Shit.” He turns back to the witches who are glaring at Sam, their anger making the flames rise higher still. “Goddamn sons of bitches…!” The glaring continues, Castiel spotting the way each of their eyes flash green before focusing on Sam completely. His attention is briefly drawn away from the hunter as doors slam shut, Enochian symbols etched in to them so there is no way for either him or Dean to escape without Sam’s help.
just because you thought it was a good idea to split up. We stick together.” Dean sighed, keeping his gaze level with the angel’s as he placed his hand on Castiel’s arm. “I’m not losing you, Cas. Do you understand?”
” The smile on Dean’s face is infectious, it creeping on to Castiel’s face as he looks down towards the floor, trying his hardest to ignore the blush he can feel working its way across his cheeks.
“What the hell, Cas?!” Castiel pointed out the window to the warehouse to the left of Sam, head tilted in confusion.
