It's been almost thirty minutes and the rain still beats down on the earth unrelenting. The canopy above can only do so much and every now and then a couple of drops make their way down  and land on their sun-tanned skin.
As the afternoon progresses the tremble in John's hands disappears. He seems to be a lot more at ease and does some reading of his own.
The words are recognizable now but the sound of them is still the equivalent of teeth gnashing in decaying skulls, of maggots eating away at a freshly buried body, of a coffin-lid sliding in place.
“You should definitely come next time”, Greg says. Unperturbed by the lack of a reply, “we had to spend the entire evening with a moping John in tow. Not too much fun, I can tell you.”
His shirt sticks to his back and chest uncomfortably as he feels himself getting sweatier by the minute.
“I have the answers to the test right here”, he says as he waves the envelope he's holding around. “I told you I wouldn't lie to you.”
'Yes', was all Sherlock had said. And then his fingers had left him and he was alone once more. His hand had felt unbearably cold.
For the briefest of moments an expression very close to “hurt” flits across John's fine and handsome features but it's gone before Sherlock is actually sure he saw it. Before he has time to think it over John has schooled his features back into the easy smile he usually wears.
He can still feel small slivers or the remnants of powerful spells float around just behind his eyes. Maybe that's why his head hurts so much. They distract him. They pull at his thoughts and make it hard for him to concentrate and sit still.
A slow heat started in his lower body where Sherlock was still thrusting, however not as violently as before. A slow languid movement remained. Full of love and care. And when John looked up and saw reflected in Sherlock's eyes everything he himself was feeling so clearly and in complete earnest the heat shot up through his veins most violently until his entire body seemed to be swimming inside of it. Pure and weightless.
He untangles their hands and John gives a small groan in protest that quickly turns into a contented sigh when Sherlock moves them to the small of John's back and pulls him closer.
John just raises an eyebrow as he crosses his arms and the pose makes him look so authoritarian that Sherlock temporarily forgets his own name.
John knew what he was doing. He was spoiling for a fight. Any fight. Granted, a fight with Sherlock Holmes did not list amongst the best ideas he'd ever had, but he wasn't actually thinking with a clear head at the moment.
He tries to pull her back up. She refuses. Burying her free hand and face in the damp sand below her body.
So, in conclusion, John likes someone at their school who doesn't like him back....apparently....Sherlock finds that last part hard to believe.
So instead of acknowledging it's Christmas at all they usually both spend Christmas eve working or with other people.
And just as he is starting to think that, maybe, he's been over-thinking all of this, maybe he's been worrying about nothing at all.......maybe.......Holmes speaks again. His voice a soft baritone rumble in the gloomy room. Clearly on the verge of falling asleep himself.
“What if the medallion will not work for him again now that he's given it away? It's how the medallion is supposed to work after all”, Finn says, “Once you have given it away you can not take it back.”
Had he been surrounded by the sound of chittering birds and buzzing insects before now all he can hear is the heavy sound of fat water drops relentlessly beating the earth, leaves and trees around him like a drum.
John had found her unassuming when he first had laid eyes on her as she had been sitting at the table but not quite so unassuming that he would forget about her completely the moment he lost sight of her......
Holmes just laughs. The sound is warm and inviting and once again warm tingles creep up John's skin.
An actual smile spread across Sherlocks face now. John felt it was quite a good look on him. 'I'll tell you when you get an 'A' on your math test.'
But if, in return, he gets to have John Watson for even a little while, he will gladly pay the price.
'I was afraid you would not. That I would not see you again before.....', Sherlock did not finish his sentence. He Just stood there looking at John with a soft smile curling around his lips and a sad look in his eyes.
Sherlock should probably pay attention to it but he's having trouble concentrating through this dense fog of pleasure that fills his mind.
“So.....where are we going?”, It's only slightly cooler outside than it had been inside. The difference brought about by a subtle breeze. Once again the moon has appeared from behind the clouds and, bathed in moonlight, John looks like something right out of a fairy tale. To Sherlock it seems as if the stars have descended from the sky in order to make a home out of the depths of John's eyes, the dimple in his cheek and the white of his teeth as his lips curl upwards into another boyish grin.
John had touched him then. He had softly put his left hand on Holmes' elbow, their forearms touching. Holmes had let out a very long sigh as he cast his eyes down to the physical connection between them.
“So....”, John says. John hasn't left his side at all during class. This part of his plan he definitely does like. Whatever the future will bring. “Are you ready to go?”
Even though it's still raining to Sherlock it feels as if John's resolve is making the clouds break open and the sun shine through just a little bit.
“You weren't afraid we were going to stop being friends with you.....were you?” Greg has stopped laughing and sounds surprisingly sincere....as far as John can hear him over the sound of the music.
I just shrug. I don't know. I'm new to all of this. Friends. Relationships. Pretend relationships. All these feelings that come with it. I don't know how to act and so I just act out and I hurt people but I don't know how to tell her any of this. How to tell her that I didn't mean what I said to her and that she's fine the way she is and she's the best friend I've ever had and I really don't want to let her down.
He just had to get out while he still could. That much was clear. Anything was better than being bonded to Wallace.
Sherlock sips his coffee slowly. He's only drunk about a third of it. In the back of his mind he can almost feel time slip away from him. The time where he is still on the same continent as John at least. The time where, in theory, if he would choose to do so, he could get up, turn around and walk back to John.
During his childhood in London he had always felt like the “weirdo”, the strange kid, the one who didn't belong....
I kiss the back of his neck and as he pulls my hand against his chest I can feel his heart speed up.
They ended up sitting side by side with their backs against the bed again. John's head resting on Sherlock's shoulder. He was tired, still somewhat drunk and it just felt right.
He gestures around him helplessly. As if that explains anything. And when he finally dares to look back at the stranger he finds that, to his surprise, there is, once again, the hint of a smile on his face.
Leaving Mrs. Hudson to her daily routine and himself to try and make sense of the events of the morning.
There were small cracks at first where the light of an honest smile or genuine laugh would softly filter through. But as their conversation wore on and they seemed to become more and more comfortable in each others company the small cracks became larger and larger until John found himself peeking through actual holes at the surprisingly insecure, soft and beautiful personality that lay beyond.
All the riders would be dressed the exact same, a dark cloak with a dark hood hiding any discernible features, and a magic spell would prevent Sherlock from conveying his true identity to John through speech or movement.
There's nothing that comes to mind that doesn't sound hopelessly needy and pathetic or down-right untrue.
As his own horses' hooves beat the icy moonlit soil beneath the sound thundered loudly in the eerie silence that had been all encompassing justs moments before. In their steady cadence that seemed to beat in time with his heart he could hear one word and one word alone. Repeated over and over and over.....
John let out a breath he didn't know he was holding and as his leg finally gave out and he sank to the stable floor the dapple gray horse softly whinnied behind him.
He half expects the door to be locked and, for a moment, as his trembling fingers push against the heavy wood of the door, that seems to be the case....but then.....a soft click....and the door swings open before him.
Another small laugh from John. Again, there is no joy in it and it makes Sherlock feel cold all over.
John had no memory of traveling underneath the trees and making his way to the meadow, but suddenly he was there.
“You know those things are bad for you, right?” he says, as he gestures towards the half-smoked cigarette that still dangles elegantly from between Sherlock's slim and clever fingers.
The time he spent with Sherlock had been pretty hectic and he doesn't really remember all the details of it very clearly.
Another silence falls over us but this time it's a much more comfortable one. We both drink our tea and simply enjoy being here and together and just....being....
He doesn't want it to hurt. He's hurt Mary so many times...he doesn't want to do that to Sherlock too. Not tonight.
He's mad at Holmes. Mad for just leaving him like that. Abandoning him, once again, after all that they've shared.
Sherlock didn't think it would be possible, but John's voice manages to go even lower and softer: “God....all the things I want to do to you....when I get back, Sherlock....I swear....”
They had gotten up as fast as they could, grabbing their towels in the process, and had taken shelter beneath the foliage of a nearby tree.
“I'm out”, I say, “I just don't usually go around advertising it to everyone so I'd appreciate it if you didn't start making flyers immediately.”
He felt a range of emotions. Shock, sadness as older and happier memories came flooding back to the surface, but......this time around, to his own surprise, there was no anger there.
Finn gathers that Holmes probably just hates both because deep down he blames them for his brother's death.....or disappearance......although, to Finn, the first option seems far more likely.
As he had sat in the rehabilitation facility's yard with the sun setting around him and the wind whistling tunes in his ears he had suddenly heard those same words again.
Once again Sherlock goes willingly. This time the strange twisting sensation isn't in John's gut but in his chest. He decides to ignore it.
The mattress of the bed he is in is way too soft to be his own, the bed is on the wrong side of the room entirely and the early morning sunlight filtering in through a gap between the  dark red – instead of blue, why aren't they blue- curtains forces him to squint his eyes, making it hard to see in general.
The comforting cadence of his voice when he spoke and the meaningful silence that fell between the words.
There is still so much that Sherlock doesn't understand so he decides to focus on the simplest of all of his questions. The one that's right in front of his nose.
Finally everyone is back inside the carriage with the door securely closed behind them. John gives a small tug on the reins and the horses, well used to the proceedings of drawing a carriage, start off in a slow trot.
They're doing “A Midsummer Night's Dream” this year and they've all been handed a booklet of the play and are doing a read through where every one reads a random part to see where their talents are and......where they aren't.
And before John had a chance to reply Mary had already turned around and was making her way towards the library exit. Her hips swaying from side to side seductively.
His fatigue makes him doubt what had seemed crystal clear not moments before. The only thing that has changed is his own disposition.
“You think I wrote this?” Sherlock tries. After an exciting case it always takes some effort to turn his brain on again but he's slowly starting to manage.
Holmes nods, he is already getting up from his seat at the desk, he almost knocks over the candle in the process.
Molly gets to be Helena. No real surprise there either. Sherlock hates to admit it, but she actually is quite good at acting....from time to time.
At first he had been convinced he was still not awake. Still locked away in the nightmare version of his mind palace he had retreated into when he found his strength dwindling in a desperate attempt to retain at least a small bit of his sanity.
She is still standing at the entrance to the estate. The sun shines on the path and the grass and the trees before her.
'Want to play hide and seek then, Locky? I'm sure father won't object to that......and I think it's about time for a break for me anyway.'
But as Holmes raises his hands, ready to start his spell, the tingling of cold fingers suddenly returns. This time not just on the back of  John's neck but his entire body.
Sherlock looks at the drops of water that still cling to his sun-bronzed skin, his eyelashes, the hair on his arms. They shine like small diamonds as the rays of the sun reflect off of them.
Greg doesn't take his eyes off of the road in front of him, the rain is getting heavier and traffic a bit more busy, but he does smile and shake his head.
Silently he thanked his lucky stars that he was still in the early stages of heat and it was still so early in the morning that everybody else was fast asleep.
But as soon as he stepped out on the meadow all the elation he had felt for the last couple of hours left him and an uncomfortable nervousness took its place.
As he lay in bed now he could feel the air around him grow cold just thinking on it. Just as the air in the stables had seemed to grow cold around them as Holmes had talked to him about dark magic in hushed tones:
Sherlock loves John's smile. He knows exactly to which smile Bill is referring. It's the one where his eyes seem to light up and a dimple forms only on the left side of his mouth. The smile will widen until John opens his mouth and it turns into an actual laugh. This is usually the point where Sherlock will lean in and press his lips to John's because the one thing better than seeing John smile is feeling John's smile against his lips when he kisses him and soon his laughter will turn into a soft moan and his arms will wrap around Sherlock and the world outside of them will cease to exist.
Kitty had remained behind however. Too shaken and disturbed to even move or respond to any questions that Holmes or John asked her.
“Holmes and I are......colleagues”, Finn said. A small hint of exasperation to his voice, “we have been for a
That same smile forms on his lips as his fingers trace the spine of my volume of the collected works of Oscar Wilde. I'd almost call it 'fond' but we are just talking about books.
Sherlock's apartment itself is......cluttered.....there are books and magazines and papers on almost every flat surface.
“I thought I'd sort of ease them into it”, John says. His face turned towards the ceiling. From the corner of his eye he sees Sherlock is doing the same. It is somewhat of a relief. He doesn't think he can bear Sherlock's sad eyes on him as he tells him of the afternoon he has had.
“Oh, don't worry”, the sound of Sherlock's voice rumbles through his chest and head where their bodies connect and the sensation is both familiar and comforting, “I've had him upgraded to business class.”
The answer to that question is so mind bogglingly vast that his brain can't seem to contain it and every thought he sends its way bounces right back off.
The hotel-lobby is pretty quiet at this time of day. Besides John and Sherlock there is only a handful of people scattered around the breakfast area but John can somehow feel the eyes of every single individual person on them.
Not really knowing what else to say John slowly moved towards her and gently folded his arms around her. Encompassing Mary's smaller form in a tight hug. She went stiff at first. Much as she had done when John had kissed her, but all too soon she melted into him. Resting her forehead on his chest. Her hands crossed behind his back, grabbing onto his jacket. No doubt leaving behind a trail of flower and dough, but John didn't really care.
As it turns out John is actually pretty good at improvisation and by the time the exercise ends and they start rehearsing scenes from the play Sherlock feels that some of the tension caused by his sleepless night has slipped away.
“I woke up and you were just....gone.....The only thing they could tell me at the hospital was that you'd checked yourself out. Nobody knew where you'd gone to.....”
His hair is combed and modeled and as John squints his eyes he can see tiny stars nestled in between the raven curls.
My mind keeps taking me back to all the instances where his leg has brushed against mine underneath the table, where his hand lingered just a little bit too long on my knee or my shoulder, where his gaze briefly flickered down from my eyes to my lips....
'You are wrong, sir',  John's reply, 'we are in Carterhaugh and my father owns these lands. If anything you are the one who is trespassing. And besides, there are many roses here. One more or less will hardly be noticed. Next to my father I am a lord of these lands also and I will not let some wild spirit tell me where I can and cannot go.'
His breath came in short pants, forming small white clouds in the chilly night around him as his feet scrabbled for purchase on the uneven stonework of the castle's outer wall.
The smile is still on his face but the hint of sadness Sherlock saw earlier is also still there and so he finds that he still can't say no.
John feels as if he's fallen asleep and is experiencing the strangest dream. And he is no stranger to odd dreams.
Both their breaths laboured this time. Their chests rising and falling rapidly as they first sprint along the wall of the house, then through a field, over a small fence to bring them to the small dirt road they are currently following.
To the casual onlooker it might seem as if the brothers are playing a game to while away another rainy and blustery day but the matter at hand is, in fact, deadly serious.
“Oh...oh....yes”, even though he still hasn't taken another sip he finds he needs to swallow before he's able to continue talking, “it's rather.....overwhelming.”
“I don't know”, I finally say because I don't want her to get the wrong idea. I don't think John and I even know what this is between us. It's still too fresh and new and fragile to be talked about out loud. I don't want to scare it away by weighing it down by making it something official.
Sherlock pressed himself against it as hard as he could and forced himself to think of something else. Anything but what was in that room.
And so, at the beginning of my third week at my new school, I decide to get up extra early and paint my nails.
She had given John a strange look when he had not been able to produce Sherlock's last name when she asked for it.
He briefly contemplates going into the upstairs bedroom instead but.....no.....there will be a bed in there.....and to be alone again with Sherlock in a room with a bed......that would be too much......too soon.......worlds colliding.....not here and not now.
“Should have told you what?”, he spits out, “that I couldn't get in touch with you for a week because my father took my phone away because there was a number in there he didn't recognize? That he tends to drink too much when he's home and when he does he can get mad about literally anything? And when I think I've figured out what makes him mad he comes up with something new to call me a failure and a disappointment over? That for our second date I had to climb out of my bedroom-window to get to your house because he had decided to lock me in my room that day? That I sometimes end up bruised because my father believes in a strict upbringing? That I told him I, maybe, am in love with a boy and he got so mad about that that he decided to try and break my nose? Is that what I should have told you, Sherlock? Because that's usually not what people want to hear me say and when I do they generally leave me behind and I can deal with people leaving me but not you......not you.......I just can't.........I......”
The intruder doesn't say anything. For far too long they just stand there. Apparently not sure what to do with this strange boy crying in the bathroom and I'm too cowardly to look back and meet their gaze.
My palms are clammy and my jeans are as uncomfortable as they get but I have no time to change into anything else anymore.
The loud, muscular and very “alpha” boys aren't nearly as small-minded and intimidating as he initially had assumed.
“Is that why you didn't come to practice with us anymore?” he asks. It's all starting to make sense now.
Looking at them now he wondered how he could ever have seen anything besides what it truly was. Just a pile of old stones. A warm orange glow over them as the sun steadily rose from behind the horizon.
Another comfortable silence falls between them. Sherlock briefly contemplates going to sleep again but then he'd have to miss out on the feeling of John's fingers drawing lazy patterns on his back and the rise and fall of John's chest beneath his head as he calmly breathes in and out.
I really, really, really would like to thank everyone who has read, given kudos, commented, bookmarked or subscribed. I had not even expected to have one person reading this.
Man...I had so much trouble writing this chapter and I don't really know why.....I might decide I hate it in the future and revise it a bit but if I do I will let you know.
He had originally planned to ride all the way to the river, but with the sun torturing them both so violently on the open plains that lay in between Carterhaugh Castle and their goal he had decided to make for the wooded area to the north instead where they would be able to find some shade much sooner.
But then he remembers that last kiss and he catches John looking at him in a certain way when he thinks Sherlock is not paying attention.
John squeezes their hands where they rest on top of the porch. Sherlock feels as if he's been lit on fire from the inside out.
“So, you are then?”, she asks, her voice a soft whisper across the table to keep other people from hearing us.
Instead of answering her I look over at the rugby-table again but John is no longer looking at me and I can't even see where Greg is sitting at the moment.
For a moment he lets himself pretend they are the only two people left in the world and there are no places they have to be later or people who think they owe them some form of explanation of any kind.
The earth beneath his body was unrelenting, hard, cold and sand and weeds were sticking to his clothing and hair, but he hadn't felt this alive in months.
The days had just dragged on after that. Each one just as mundane and uneventful as the next. And every time John heard someone enter the stable-complex or when someone approached him in the orchard he secretly hoped he would be greeted by blue eyes, raven curls and a mysterious smile, but it never happened.
“Are you that embarrassed about me?”, I say and my words hurt him, I can see that they do, but I'd rather have him hurt than pretend he doesn't feel anything at all.
It is large and heavy, the sheets feel like satin and the boards and posts are decorated with delicately carved images of different celestial bodies. In the center of the headboard is a representation of the moon-goddess herself. Her features soft, her hair flowing in an unseen breeze and her eyes, inlaid with silver thread, shine like stars as the light of the sun hits them.
John isn't quite sure if he would be able to concentrate on what Mrs. Holmes has to say to him anyway if those eyes with their magical lights were trained on him at the moment.
He's on familiar grounds now and suddenly Mycroft Holmes doesn't so much look like a menacing shark or conniving vampire anymore......he just looks tired......a tired older brother worried about his young brother who might be just a little bit too soft and special for the harsh cruelties of the world.
Maybe it's the alcohol, maybe it's the crushing loneliness he's feeling, maybe it's something else.....but he sends a text.
Sherlock carefully puts down his glass on the kitchen table as, once again, he feels himself breaking out in a cold sweat.
It swirls up into the night sky through the opened window, finding itself a home amongst the wispy clouds that cover up the moon and stars.
He felt the alpha empty. A rush of warm fluid in his most private of parts. It felt wonderful. The fire inside of him finally quenched. It felt right. The world felt right. It was perfection.
Sherlock follows his gaze. At first he sees nothing besides the intensifying rain gently sliding down the panes of the glass, making it hard to see through them clearly, but then....
He cleared his throat as his crude, hastily scratched out, horse drawing stared back at him, 'point taken. Teach me, oh great teacher.'
I vow to avoid my mother for the next couple of days in the hope that she will eventually forget and not try and have 'the talk' with me.
'John...', he said again. His tone unsure and his eyes scanning John's face for a sign that some part of him still understood what was going on and he was not yet completely lost to his heat and his hormones.
For a moment he has no idea what Greg is talking about.....but then.....the game....the rugby game.....of course.
Just for a moment John closed his eyes tightly. Regaining some form of composure. And then proceeded to remove Master Holmes' pants and undergarments.
He holds the noxious fumes captive in his lungs for a couple of seconds before he opens his eyes, exhales and watches as they dissipate amongst the clouds and stars and the relative dark of a London city midnight.
'Yes sir', was all John could reply. Unable to keep just a hint of nerves out of his voice. 'Do you need your horse, sir?'
And so, as soon as he could, John had left the house too. He had fled to the army, where he had seen many more deaths and where he, at last, had felt somewhat at home.
About the thoughts he had had, sitting there, in the dark, the smell of Sherlock intoxicating as it surrounded him. That one errant curl delicately draped over his forehead. The shape of his lips....
Briefly he felt her touch on his skin. It felt cold and damp and limp. Like something already dead, but then there was a blinding flash of light that he could see even through his tightly closed eyelids and all of a sudden..... the feeling was gone.
“I didn't use magic, I just know how to memorize a pack of cards in under fifteen minutes”, Mycroft finally says. His tone flat and devoid of any emotion once more.
“Might have been Morgana after all....sounds like her kind of game”, Holmes says eventually, “but not just her.....if it is her then she's working together with.....someone......something.......a magpie you said?”
He pretends to write something down again. This time it's a circle with a lot of smaller circles after it.
He gently weaves their fingers together and, had Mycroft not been in the room, he would have kissed Sherlock right then and there.
It seems his companion for the evening has finally returned with their drinks. John finds he can really use one right now.
He backs me up against the sink and I go willingly. Even now. Now that he has basically told me goodbye I am unable to resist him.
The light of the late evening frames John like a halo. He's still wearing the same clothes he had been wearing that afternoon and his knuckles still bear the faint scratches left there when they had been rubbed against the bark of their tree continuously.
Sherlock just shrugs. He isn't really in the mood for this. Not now. He has other things to worry about. He can't find it in himself to be bothered by what bored elitists think of his appearance with everything else that has been going on in his life recently.
When Sherlock wakes he feels well rested. He feels energized again. The sunlight filtering through the curtains tells him it's late in the morning. Close to 11 am probably.
Her true age cannot be measured in years. During her long lifespan she has done her fair share of waiting. Millenia of it. She has grown tired of waiting.
It has large windows that let in golden beams of sunlight on all hours of the day and a fresh ocean breeze even though the ocean is miles away.
As she stands beside Nighthawk now she turns her face towards the sun and squints her eyes until they water.
In his mind he tries gathering up the rain for himself and reshaping its watery letters into new forms but as soon as he draws on his magic a searing pain shoots through his mind making his eyes water and his skull feel as if it is about to crack open.
The room he keeps everything related to John Watson in is still filled with golden sunlight and warmth as it always has been.
He will wait for him to make up his mind, blow away the dark clouds that obstruct his mind from time to time and accept the light John is willing to give to him so freely.
John thinks he is here for, for lack of a better word, “business”. He thinks that is why Sherlock has called for him. To discuss matters about the medallion, Morgana, the Magpie King......and perhaps that is what they should be doing.
Thoughts and memories drift into his mind's eye one after the other, break apart or merge together to form a jumbled mess and he slowly finds himself sinking into them.
'I've had a good, long talk with the headmaster about you, Mr. Holmes', his mother continued. Looking pretty smug. 'From now on it's over with your shenanigans. You will not hurt my son anymore.'
# There are a LOT of different versions of the Tam Lin ballad and so there are also a lot of different versions of the transformation scene at the end. In one version Tam Lin's “final form” is a burning coal which Janet drops in a well and this ends up saving him.
Sharp, broken, angry and dangerous. But there are still hints of beauty left if you look at it from just the right angle.
Sure, when it had just been John and I, his gaze drawing me in and making me forget all semblance of common sense and reason, it had been easy to agree.
'I bet you're really good', he said as his knee softly bumped against Sherlock's in an attempt to get his attention away from the window and back to him. He liked it when Sherlock looked at him. His eyes a different shade of blue-green every time. It was mesmerizing.
“Hey”, he says, “it's alright. We all move at our own pace. If you haven't then you haven't. It's all fine. Really.....but you should talk to him. Make sure he's being completely honest with you because....to me.....it just feels like he's not. Alright?”
The young woman behind the reception desk recognizes his name when he gives it to her so he supposes the female paramedic actually passed it on two nights ago.
As I look at her I try to find a hint of sadness hidden in the curve of her lips but, for once, I can't seem to find it.
When Sherlock noticed him come in, doofy grin and all, he just sighed, rolled his eyes and managed to slump impossibly lower in the chair he had currently placed himself in.
“So you could reach me if you needed help with your classes. Are you going to answer “why” to everything I say?”
The man smiles an odd smile. A mix between sadness and a hidden secret. There is no happiness in that smile. Not on that day.
“James”, he says. And even speaking his name doesn't hurt anymore, “James”, he says again. Being able to finally speak that name again after so many years is somehow....freeing.....as if....finally......now he is able to put James to rest and remember him in the way that he should be remembered.
He wasn't even sure how John felt about him in return. Did he even feel as much as friendship? Or was he just playing the part of the faithful servant?
The walls of the room are white and the linoleum floor has this sort of whitish-green colour you only ever seem to find in hospitals.
Sherlock tries to enter his mind-palace to see if he is right about what he thinks he knows but the tension coming off of the body next to him is like a physical force keeping the doors firmly barred shut.
His clothing reminded John of the riding gear master Holmes used to wear. Black boots, fitting trousers and a dark jacket, but he did not resemble Holmes in any other way.
The sound of the fire dying out behind them the last thing they heard before an otherworldly mist swallowed them.
And the looks his father had been giving him lately, fiery stares filled with utter disgust, eyes squinting, lips pursed together tightly, spoke volumes.
Eventually he helps me to my feet again and this time we manage to peel my jeans off of my body. They end up inside-out together with my underwear and shirt and socks in some corner of my room. John takes of the rest of his clothes as well. It takes him far less effort and I give him a look but he just keeps smiling at me and before I know it I am on my back on the bed again with John on top of me.
She keeps trying to touch him. Put her hand on his shoulder or arm and he keeps stepping away or shaking it off. He seems tense where she seems flirty and he keeps looking around hopelessly.
He probably shouldn't put his hands in his pockets. That's something that servants do.....isn't it.......he's not sure. He's unsure about a lot of things at the moment.
“Look”, Finn says, “I made a promise and besides.....he has a right to know. He knows part of it already. You told him yourself. After all he's been through he deserves to know the truth. He's proven himself to be a worthy ally.......saved your life.”
With great effort Sherlock lifts his own hand and threads his long fingers through John's shorter ones.
All of a sudden he felt his feet leave the ground. He would have let out a startled yelp had he found it in himself to dislodge his lips from Sherlock. Instead a muffled moan came out, immediately swallowed up by Sherlock's searching mouth as he lifted John from the ground and gently laid him down on his back on the soft grass.
Over time these now so vibrant blues and purples dotted across my arms and thighs will turn ugly and fade, just as John's feelings for me might have already done.
I'm 13 in this picture and there's still some baby-fat left and it clings to me in all the wrong places. I stand outside in shorts and a t-shirt and bare feet and I shield my eyes from the sun with my hand. My mother is standing next to me in a flowy dress and she's wearing a large summer hat. She is younger here and so her hair is still long and it shines golden like the sun. My father took this picture. John doesn't comment on it and I'm glad he doesn't.
There's been a spot of bad weather and one of the trees in the orchard has fallen over. If he would be so kind to chop it up and remove it.
I drop my bag on the floor once again, this time no books spill out, and lean on the sink with sweaty and yet cold palms and hang my head low between my shoulders.
Bill fancied John. That much he'd been able to gather from the few times they'd spoken and from what John had told him about Bill.
And so that's what Sherlock does. Because, at the moment, he feels that time is all he has to give. He stops talking and gives John a moment to himself. A moment to gather his thoughts and try and shake away the sadness and disappointment that weigh down on him so heavily.
He wishes Watson would break the rules every once in a while. But  maybe he's expecting too much of the man. He is a soldier after all.
There is one more thing inside of me that I've kept locked away for a long time now and it might finally be time to set it free as well.
For a moment Sherlock doesn't know what to say. He's not extremely good at figuring out what John is thinking at the best of times, let alone when he's just come off of the high of a case.
He finds himself in a make-shift field-hospital. Bandaged, badly wounded, broken beyond repair and just on the right side of death's doorstep.
Why should I be the one to pine after him and try and make an effort when it is so clear that that's not what he wants.
Sherlock's baritone voice is still able to do things to John. To reach within his chest and resonate there. Finding itself a home deep within his very core where it rings like a long lost bell calling him home.
He gives Sherlock a pleading look. Hoping his boyfriend......ex-boyfriend......can make sense out of the jumble of words he's just thrown at him.
Years ago Sherlock had made a promise to himself to never ride in John's car but, seeing how affected John was today he had decided to break that promise.
“You see”, Mary says, “he had this plan to win me back. He thought performing in the school play would be an awfully romantic gesture and look!.....it worked!.....He's won me back!” She has a big smile on her face. Like the cat that got the cream. Sherlock doesn't blame her. She's won. There's a part of him that always knew what he had with John couldn't last. That what he made himself to believe they had was only temporary. Borrowed happiness. But he's still glad he had it nonetheless.
Without John beside him as a physical reminder that this is all real his confidence in what they have....if they have anything at all, wavers.
Just a broken soldier. Wounded in the war and found unfit for the only thing he had thought he was good for.
Focusing on mundane tasks was difficult to do knowing that, close by, Holmes was actively trying to avoid him.
Maybe John thinks this will bring them closer but, eventually, these small grains of knowledge about Sherlock's personal life will end up becoming the salt that spoils the sweet meal.....the sand in the oil that makes the cogs of the machine stop turning....it is  the beginning of the end.
'My sister and I were supposed to be in the car too, but there was a last minute change of plans. I don't think my mother has ever forgiven him for how much worse it could have been. I think that's why she is the way she is. So overprotective.'
He gives John a smile and the answering smile John gives him is so radiant it temporarily blots out the setting sun behind him.
For a moment Mycroft is caught off guard as his mouth opens and closes again twice before he is able to form a reply. He does not direct his reply at John but turns to Sherlock instead:
And besides: at this point they've been practicing their lines together after school for about two months. He's pretty sure that if John wanted to hurt him he would have done it by  now.
“So....”, he says, “you left in an awful hurry last Saturday......it wasn't anything I did, was it?”
Her spindly legs make a soft ticking sound on the floor beneath as she moves closer still. She only barely registers it.
So he let Mary drag him along to these parties in the hope that some of her endless enthusiasm would rub off on him.
“John.....I.....” Sherlock finally stammers, but John is already in the process of stuffing his books in his bag and getting up.
To anyone who is still following this and reading along: you are simply amazing and my gratitude cannot be expressed in words. When I started this story I truly thought I would be the only one reading it.
I give him a look but either he doesn't notice or he doesn't care because he leans in even closer to look at my screen right until I put my phone face down on the desk.
Holmes doesn't answer. He doesn't really need to. John knows he's alright. The dark shadow is gone and he can see Holmes' magic coursing through his veins freely again, pumped around by a frantic beating heart.
I sweat nervously as I sit at my desk in biology class. I keep twisting my pen between my fingers and I can't seem to be able to stop doing it.
Irene had been very confused at first but had quickly just settled into the situation. John had ended up teaming up with Molly.
And there he had found some poor excuse for a human being pressed against him. Defiling Watson's uniqueness with his vile and mundane lust based on nothing more than outward appearance. Of course Watson was handsome. You'd have to be blind not to notice. With his well built and compact frame, thanks to the army no doubt. His sandy blond hair that framed his face just right, the color a nice contrast with his gray-blue eyes, reminding Sherlock of an oasis in the desert. But to judge a man by his outward appearance alone was one of the gravest mistake a person could make. Sherlock himself had found this out the hard way. But he very much doubted the nobleman who had been in the process of molesting Watson saw any of the things that Sherlock saw in him.
John should have known better than to say anything else at this point, but he could feel the wall inside of him cracking and if he didn't let some of the pressure out right now it would soon crumble completely.
# On the subject of women: in chapter 1, when John meets Sherlock for the first time he is holding the double rose in his hands (also a reference to the original text:
Faintly, behind him, still far away in the distance another set of heels could be heard as they made contact with the ground.
My mother takes both of my hands in hers before she continues talking. Her skin is surprisingly warm. I had forgotten how warm her hands can be.
“Is this why you've been blowing off the team? To go on dates with your boyfriend? Need me to get a candle for you two? More romantic.”
If he shows Watson even a hint of friendliness the man will find an excuse to ignore his order and stay.
One of the boys at the table has apparently said something funny because the group of rugby-boys suddenly erupts with uproarious laughter as some of them even bang their fists on the table.
They've been silent for a good long while again but the silence between them has also gone from something uncomfortable and heavy to serene, peaceful and known.
It swirls in intricate patterns as it drifts out into the night where John eventually loses sight of it.
'Would you be so kind as to escort my horse to the stables though? I will be needing it again in the morning.'
Finn makes a gesture with his hands and the fire dies down slightly, making the dark corners around them draw nearer and their small circle of light go slightly colder. The expression on Homes' face sours as he slumps lower in his chair.
I'd dream about large flocks of  magpies that would turn into dark knives that cut my skin and stole my voice and sight.”
A couple of boys in the back of the class snicker. It's the usual reaction I get at the mention of my slightly unorthodox name. I've had it for over 16 years now so I probably should be used to it by now. But I'm not. The sound of their laughter like tiny pinpricks to my already tense nerves.
The medallion is in the hands of lovely Molly Hooper and John Watson is probably very, very mad at him.
He gives us an apologetic smile as he waves his hands in the direction of the voices unenthusiastically.
'Yeah', was all John said, trying his best not to look at her. He'd seen that look on so many people in the last year. He didn't need to see it again.
After all, if you knew where to look, there was something definitely otherworldly and magical about Holmes. Perhaps his subconscious had known all along and that was why his conscious thoughts had such an easy time catching up.
'I ran away.....from my father', John continued, 'I have nowhere to go but here.......that is......can I even stay here?'
“We have to get to the Order”, he tells Holmes, “find out more about this King and confront him on our own terms now that we still, maybe, have the upper hand. Waiting around here just makes us more vulnerable. Believe me, I wish we could disappear, just you and me, and leave everything....all of this....behind us.....leave it for what it is.....but that's not how this is going to work out.
Once again Watson seems insecure. His eyes looking anywhere but at Holmes as the sun continues to set around them. Dark shadows stretch themselves out of the many corners of the stables as the light around them turns from yellow to orange to a darker red.
Just John's messy bedroom littered with rugby gear and study books. Sherlock tries his hardest not to look at the unmade bed in the corner but fails utterly. He feels his cheeks flush.
With the winter-sun just starting to rise over the horizon the meadow was shrouded in a sickly cold and pale light as the grass was covered in frost that had formed during the night.
John does look at him then. Maybe it is the setting of the two of them playing cards and Holmes being entirely too good at it, but he is suddenly reminded of all the rumours about Holmes' gambling addiction and the subsequent loss of the family fortune because of it.
'So you've got an army doctor working for you now?' Finn had asked. Of course he had figured it out. He always did. That was the thing with Elves. Because of their long lifespans they had the patience to wait you out.
Somehow she must hear my heart shatter into a thousand tiny fragments because once again her small hand is on mine.
The night draws to an end. Plans need to be made. And as the sun slowly rises, light is shed on the situation at hand.
He briefly considers re-evaluating Molly as an option for “Person X” but no......it would make no logical sense.
And so they found themselves, all three of them – John, Sherlock and Mr. Watson – each with a paintbrush in their hands and a bucket of creamy white paint at their feet on their own spot along the wooden panels of the outer garage wall.
Holmes must have used a great feat of magic for remnants of it to be able to travel beyond the veil like this without the assistance of any of Morgana's black magic.
Of course everyone laughs and that takes the tension out of the room at least a little bit but only for a short while.
When she stretches out her fingers now she can still see tiny remnants of sparks dance around the tips. They sting. It feels as if there are small shards of glass embedded beneath her skin and fingernails.
Molly gives a telling glance in the direction of the rugby table as well, rolls her eyes, sighs and just continues talking.
Next to him Finn is ablaze with magic now. His eyes seem to be made out of red fire and there are stars woven in the strands of his hair.
For a moment his hand just hovers in the air. Reaching out to Sherlock. Wanting to touch but not sure if he's allowed to.
Sherlock did not smile often, but it hadn't taken John long to realize he really liked it when Sherlock did.
All I can do is moan as his hand travels down from my hair, igniting goose-flesh along the skin of my neck and back, and lower and lower still.
As he looks around he also sees Miss Astley standing in a group with three other ladies and one gentleman.
'About time you buried him then', a full smile was now firmly on Finn's face as he produced a piece of paper from within the confines of his riding jacket.
Some sparks emerge but, once again, the spell peters out and dies before it has time to grow and finish.
A couple of times John tries asking Holmes some questions but he either doesn't answer or gives him that same icy stare again.
The wind howls with a voice that spells sorrow and regret, the lightning seeks to scorch all and within the thunder the deep moans of the dead are hidden, but right now, inside this fragile building, they live in a world of their own.
Mary hesitates for a moment. As if he's caught her saying something she shouldn't have. But she quickly schools her features and puts on another radiant smile.
Mrs. Holmes and her daughters were having a ball this evening and John would be in charge of taking care of the horses of the lords and ladies that attended.
And Andrew wasn't the person who spread it either. He told me so when I asked him. He had been at home the day the rumor came out. Apparently he'd come down with some kind of stomach flu. So that's why I couldn't find him at school that day.
The headmaster was the only one in this school who knew why John's father was not around. Against Johns wishes his mother had told him when John switched schools about two years ago now. John hated that he knew. Every time the headmaster looked at John he could see it in his eyes. Sympathy. Poor John, with his dead father. John hated it. He didn't want anyone to feel sorry for him. To have that be the main emotion he evoked in people. Poor John who had been dealt such a hard lot in life. He was so much more. But as soon as people knew, they felt as if they had to treat him like something fragile. Easy to break. And they never gave him the opportunity to show his true potential.
For a couple of seconds there is only silence and he starts to wonder whether he has misheard or maybe Bill has hung up on him....but.....no.... there's no beep on the other end of the line. Bill is still there. Sherlock can hear him breathing if he concentrates. It is the rhythmic deep pattern of breathing of a man trying to muster up the courage to say something.....
“Molly's not coming today”, John says, “it's.......her aunt......she's very sick.......guess it's just you and me then, huh?”
“I have an estate up in Scotland”, he says. It's the story Holmes and him have agreed on telling anybody who gets curious and starts asking questions, “I don't come down here often.”
It seems that there have been a lot of full moons lately. Far more than there should have reasonably been. For one of the first times in his life Sherlock wonders if there, perhaps, really is a Moon-goddess. If she is up there....watching over them....
Sherlock has wrapped his towel tightly around his shoulders. He's trying his very best not to shiver but underneath the fabric of the towel he can feel his skin break out in goosebumps. Silently, he wishes he'd brought more clothes than just his swimming trunks.
“And if he ever breaks your heart”, Andrew says, “just let me know and I'll beat him up......well....”, he frowns, “I'll get someone to beat him up.....from what I could tell he looks kind of muscly and I don't think I'll be able to take him on.”
My mother has a nostalgic and sentimental streak to her and no matter how often I've begged her she refuses to take these photos down.
John however did take some pride in his knowledge of the variety of plants that grew in Carterhaugh, but he only recognized an embarrassingly small fraction of the large variety that grew on this strange meadow.
“You had a pretty necklace with a silver chain that you wore a lot those last couple of days before you left. Where has it gone to?”
Sherlock opens his eyes again. The wind is gone and a cloud has drifted in front of the moon casting long shadows on the world around him.
John seems so sure of himself.....so experienced.......while Sherlock just.....guesses. Hoping to at least get some of it right and not make a complete fool of himself.
John eyes Sebastian warily. The shark-like grin on his teammate's face tells him he should probably trust Sebastian as far as he can throw him, but......he is also curious.....and he really needs to pass his test.
And he hadn't just left it at that....oh no.....he had gotten John involved in all sorts of matters he should definitely not have been involved in. Had told him all about the prophecy and the Shadowlands....and the Order itself.....
Coming home feels like two strong hands that are able to hold him ever so gently and ease his troubled mind with just the lightest of touches.
'Wow', John had said. He had believed what Holmes had told him up to that point. How could he not. Everything about Holmes just screamed magic. From his raven curls to his elven-like face and his eyes filled with light. But to see it firsthand was something else.
By  now he had felt he had been almost too obvious but if Watson needs his bleeding heart laid bare at his feet to finally understand then....so be it.
The sun shining through the window is making him feel comfortable and warm now. The sounds filtering in from outside are sounds he recognizes.
“Not yet”, Finn says, “you have to see the openings in The Veil as openings in a sieve. Water or small particles may pass through but stones will stay inside. She is a stone. Too powerful to pass. Too rooted to where she resides now....but give it time.....she might be able to  make a hole big enough....we'll all be in trouble then.”
Sherlock gives a half-hearted shrug. He can't really claim that what Finn says isn't true....because it is. But it's the best explanation he's got so far.....it's the only explanation he's got....even though it seems unbelievable even to his own ears.
Holmes cast his eyes to the ceiling as he let out an exaggerated sigh: 'the world', he said. That smile never fully leaving his face.
“We'll take the carriage. I'll pretend there is somewhere I need to be and of course I need you to drive it. Nobody will bat an eye at that.....I've been known to do stranger things......the carriage is, of course, far too slow to bring us all the way to the Hooper estate in a timely manner. We will leave it at the first inn we come across and travel the rest of the way on horseback.”
The dark man in the top hat, Molly hooper, John Watson.....the medallion.....but......that would be impossible.
When they enter Sherlock's dressing room the first thing Sherlock notices is that Mary isn't there anymore.
“I'm sorry I outed you to that boy like that”, John continues, “I didn't mean to. It wasn't my place.”
Being so close to Holmes and his magical and mysterious lifestyle these last couple of days had blinded him from the truth.
Luckily the volume of the music is not quite so pronounced in the bathroom so they are able to have a somewhat normal conversation up here.
This isn't surprising since John is a year older than I am and we don't share any classes but I still get the feeling he is actively avoiding me.
With it you found yourself anchored. Stuck in place. But once the bond broke, vulnerable and left adrift and completely at the mercy of the tides.
It looks like he'll have to talk to John about proper stage directions when they're at the coffee-place this afternoon.
He decides to just smile as he finally makes it all the way down the stairs and reaches his partner for the evening but the expression feels forced and just a little bit too tense.
There's something in his eyes but I don't know what it means and I can't ask him because that's not what he wants.
'Also', Holmes continued, 'I might have seen your army jacket in your bedroom when I woke up there.' He looked slightly embarrassed now. John found it rather charming.
“I'm fine”, he says again, opens the car door, gets out and heads for the door to his apartment as fast as his feet can carry him.
The back of Holmes' neck is so close to his face that, when John exhales, the lock of hair at his nape moves slightly in the airflow his breath produces.
And so he finds that, these days, his mind is lost in daydreams most of the time and so he needs a moment to bring himself back to the present when John talks to him. Especially when he says something Sherlock was not expecting him to say.
“Oh....uhm.....”, what happened? John finds he isn't really sure himself. He's probably been asking  himself that question for a long time too and so he decides to go for the most uncomplicated answer and hopes Sherlock is able to read between the lines.
Once more he looks back in the direction that Holmes has left in. By now he can no longer feel any of his magic anymore.
He opens his eyes carefully but, even though the curtains are drawn, the light in the room is still enough to blind him and send a sharp pain searing through his skull and he groans as he closes them again.
'Goddammit' He muttered under his breath. Not necessarily because of the cold. Although he told himself that that was all it was. Just the cold. No frustration at his current position. No sadness. Soldiers did not get sad. No fear. Definitely no fear for members of her majesties armed forces. Just the cold of an early September morning.
John is sitting down at the side-line of the rugby-field and he has taken a picture of his legs as he stretches them out in front of him. The sky is dark and it's raining. You can just barely see a hint of his rugby-shorts and his skin is stained with mud and grass as the strong muscles of his thighs and calves positively glisten.
Even though the sun has gone down hours ago the air is still warm and it sticks to his skin. He wishes there was a breeze to cool him down. Some rain. Anything.
“Training is brutal. We hardly get time to sleep. I'm sorry. But I'm here now. We've got a couple of minutes I think.”
He hazarded an unsure, questioning look over his shoulder to where Finn still stood beside the door.
He had started by giving tentative licks to the head while he held Sherlocks shaft in his left hand and his hip in his right to stop him from thrusting further into Johns mouth.
Mycroft gives him a scrutinizing look. Apparently what he sees on Sherlock's face is enough for the moment because he just nods and drives on.
They had never been a particularly rich family and after his father's sudden passing their situation had gotten significantly worse.
Usually I'm barely on time so I can avoid having to hang around the school grounds and its horrible 'socializing' that goes on before classes actually start.
I glance at him from underneath my fringe. He really doesn't look bothered at all. He's giving me that same toothy smile he gave me the first time we met at Patrick's party and there's a soft twinkle in the depths of his eyes.
You can call it cowardice.......being selfish....but he feels that he has been living his life by the rules of others for far too long.
“My father died”, I say. John doesn't stir in my arms. His breath as even as it has been for the last hour. I heave a small sigh of relief. I'm not sure if I would be able to do this if I knew he was listening.
Miss Hooper and her aunt are still sitting at their small table. Preventing the two men from going back and talking to the young girl again.
I surrender the words to the darkness that hovers in the bedroom around me. It's the only way I'm ever able to say them.
People are shouting and yelling and he can hear the sound of boots trampling the earth and swords slashing away at flesh just above his head.
“I can't wait to leave this town”, he replied. He had no idea where that had come from. Or maybe he did.....
Molly reaches the small group and they actually make room for her as she slides herself into their conversation.
His racing mind had been keeping him awake for hours. Returning to his father's words again and again.
As he was scrolling through his list of contacts though, trying to remember where in the alphabet exactly the letter “M” was situated he came across a contact he didn't recognize:
Sherlock wants to look away but finds he can't. Not now that he has one more chance to look at John. He finds he still cannot speak and so he just nods again.
John understood but after almost losing him it was hard to leave him behind and go out on his own, even if it was for just a short moment.
He decides to sit down in the comfortable chair in the corner of the room and have something to eat while he waits for Finn to return or Master Holmes to wake up.
He needs to talk to Watson about the strange qualities of his magic whenever they're together too......sometime......
He wants to give her a snarky reply but he still has a headache and his mind feels as if it's stuffed with cotton making it hard for him to come up with something clever. So, in the end, he just decides to not say anything at all. It will vex her equally.
He scans the ballroom. Everybody here looks like they belong. Everybody but him. Even though he isn't dressed nearly as flamboyant as most of the people here he feels as if he sticks out.
My apologies for the shortness of this chapter but I really needed to get it down while I had time to write.
“I stuffed and mounted my pet rabbit when I was 8”, he says. Surely this will throw John off....weird him out.....but....no...John just keeps on smiling at him as he places his elbows on the table and leans forward.
And if something did happen it was usually of no importance. But most of the time nothing happened at all.
But his empty fingers only remind him of how, just hours earlier, John had taken his hands in his and had pressed his lips to each of them as if Sherlock was something precious.
The weight of her warm, smaller hand in his felt like a comforting anchor tonight. Something to keep him grounded in reality and keep his mind from wandering where he did not want it to go. He softly squeezed her fingers and smiled down at her. She smiled back. Her face nothing but roundness and soft curves. No sharp edge to be found. Her complexion and hair fair and light. No hint of darkness in her. Mary held no secrets, her face read like an open book. With Mary you always knew what you were getting. Tonight he found the thought of security and predictability comforting. Especially now that thoughts of what had happened years before on this exact day came creeping back unbidden.
He is not looking at me anymore. He is tucking his shirt back in his jeans. I must have pulled it out at some point. I don't remember doing so.
Holmes follows the gesture and once he spots Miss Astley he, once again, gives a condescending snort.
'That gateway was old....it had been closed a long time ago.....surely I would have.....' Holmes had muttered under his breath. Seemingly lost in thought.
“I'm sure he wants you there, Sherlock”, Greg says to him. His voice soft and with just a hint of pity.
Sherlock's face is close to his own now, his eyes shine as John has never seen them do before, boring into his own as Sherlock rests his forehead against John's, sharing breaths in the intimate space between.
“One of the rugby guys probably told Mary about you and that's why she was here....to try and drive you away.....get back at me.....or something.....” John concludes.
He was waiting to execute the plan Sherlock had carefully thought out. The plan to release Sherlock from the hold the queen had over him once and for all and bring him home.
“Why don't you take a seat next to Phillip”, the teacher says. Her voice has that edge to it that teachers think is helpful but only ever makes things worse.
The creature growled again. Louder this time. For a second John thought he could hear words in the growls and barks the wolf produced, but all too soon the fairy-queen lifted her hands to the moon and sent a different spell their way.
John is wearing a t-shirt and shorts. He's wearing sneakers but no socks and his laces aren't tied. It's as if he was in a hurry.
It must not have been easy being an openly gay teenager with bad social skills at high-school. You get labeled quite easily.
John agrees with Mike. Of course he does. The place is a dive that any self respecting health inspector would shut down based on the outside alone. But he can't say that. Mike will never want to come here again. And then he'll never see “Tall Dark and Handsome” again. And so he just shrugs, takes another sip of his beer, pretends to like it and covertly glances at the dancing figure to his left.
'All the horses that belong to the queen are brown or black', Sherlock had said, smirk still firmly in place and John had folded his hands over his belly in order to keep himself from giving in to the urge to just reach for Sherlock and wrap himself around him.
John has this way of turning everything he used to think was right on its head. It's making him dizzy.
His vision is slowly going black as he feels Morgana trying her best to pull her form out of him guided by his own magic.
His mother was already walking towards the parking lot, the sound of her heels getting fainter in the distance. She hadn't even given Sherlock so much as a goodbye.
Miss Hooper bends herself even further over the table. Her voice no more than a soft whisper barely audible over the sound of happy music and pleasant conversation that surrounds them.
He is sure it still reverberates somewhere in The Shadowlands. Echoing between its craggy hills and sharp mountain peaks until the end of time.
Master Holmes had been fatigued and close to passing out from it, but drunk he had not been. There had not even been the slightest hint of alcohol about his person. And John wasn't too sure about the gambling either. None of it explained the blood.
the month came to an end and his punishment was over. His father's strict surveillance slackened somewhat and within a couple of days John saw his first opportunity to sneak out again.
Once again his mind wanders to being naked in front of John....with John......a fresh wave of embarrassment rolls over him and he feels his cheeks glow red.
The East Wind is the ultimate punishment for sinners and little boys who will never live up to their father's unfair expectations.
She bats her eyes at him again and this time she doesn't squeeze his elbow but she runs both her hands along his chest.
The words the Elf speaks come out so matter of factly that John doesn't know what to respond. To Finn this might be day to day life but John finds he needs a moment or two to wrap his head around all this.
Sitting in a corner, unnoticed, observing others around her all she ever expected out of life. All she had needed to be content.
And then they both crawl into bed, pulling the blankets over them. Watson slides as far to the edge of his side as he can possibly manage without falling out of the bed.
'The fairy queen has bound me to it. In exchange I posses some fairy magic. Like the stepping between worlds, but that basically still keeps me in the same place. It just makes it so that mortals can't see me when I do it.'
John's sleeping face bathed in the ethereal light of the moon. Beside him in bed. Calm and uncomplicated.
Sherlock seems to understand because on the next thrust he buries his face in the crook of  his right arm muffling his groans of pleasure just enough.
'I don't know',  she sighed, mildly annoyed now as she stared down into her tea 'must we talk about this?'
Sherlock who not only possessed the ability to disappear from sight whenever he wanted, but who also seemed to be able to make time go twice as fast when John was around him.
My breath makes little clouds that drift away in the air as I exhale. My fingers are starting to tingle and I stuff my hands in my pockets.
She's standing even closer now. She leans forward slightly. Her cleavage on full display as she twirls one of her golden curls in between the fingers of her left hand.
After what feels like a lifetime as a soldier John Watson is suddenly forced to seek employment elswhere. He eventually finds his way to the Holmes estate to start work as a stable hand. But why is the master of the house never there and what secrets is he hiding?
“My aunt will be wondering where I've gone”, she says, this time her words are directed at Sherlock again.
I want to look at him. Look at his face. See if there is still any light left in his eyes but the hood covers all of it and all I can see is the tip of his nose gone slightly red in the cold late November air.
And, even-though he is not being stingy with them at the moment at all, there is still a part of me that's afraid that, eventually, he will stop giving them to me again.
He tells himself he chooses to not have friends. So he can study. Become top of his class. Make something of himself.
They were all lowly magical creatures. Creatures held at bay easily if you wore the right protection.
A little bit too loud he realized to his dismay as his stepmother suddenly turned her attention to him.
Updates have taken an embarrassingly long time due to some personal circumstances and I am so so sorry to have  made you all wait so long.
Sherlock nods. He's not sure if he actually wants to know but John is looking directly at him and his eyes shine like stars as the light of the moon is reflected in their depths and he finds he cannot refuse John anything even if he had wanted to.
“Why is Sherlock here?” he asks. His eyes boring into Sebastian. He's not sure what will happen if he looks Sherlock in the eyes.
He is looking at me again with his signature toothy grin. As if nothing has happened. As if my whole world hasn't just shifted into new and unfamiliar territory.
Once again he looked at their interlaced fingers. Once more he gently squeezed before extracting his hand and quietly getting up.
So, in the end, utterly heartbroken and with absolutely no one else to talk to he had ended up drinking.
He lets them both leave to go to Holmes Manor to figure out what the best course of action is and just prays Holmes will come to the right conclusion in the end.
He was trembling and moaning in his sleep. At the end he had shot up and had gripped his left shoulder.
John hates to admit it but the fact that Sherlock is utterly clueless to all of this....any of it....turns him on immensely.
However hard he rode, he would not reach him before the unyielding line of trees would swallow him up and the queen of the fairies would carry him away forever.
Something about the way Sherlock said that rubbed John the wrong way. Over these last couple of weeks he had come to see Sherlock as an interesting, funny, on occasion kind and handsome young man. Someone he had come to see as a friend.  And to hear someone talk him down like that, even if it was Sherlock himself, just didn't seem right. But before he could say anything about it Sherlock continued talking.
He blames the whole situation with the seamstress. The insinuation she made. With just a couple of words she had made him realize how dangerous it is for Holmes and him to even be friends at this day and age.
Maybe because they've had so many nights together already and this is the first time they're finding out what comes after.
Once again I'd like to take the opportunity to thank all my readers. You are all amazing. And your kind words and support mean the world to me.
'John', he said once again. His voice filled with awed wonder and reverence as his hands moved down to where his shirt was tucked into his kilt and started to pull the fabric up and away.
He could not see anyone in the field, but he hadn't seen Sherlock last time either until he had been right behind him.
Holmes had told the tailor some ridiculous story about John being a friend of his visiting from some estate up in Scotland. His belongings were taking their sweet time getting down here and so they had just decided to buy him a whole new wardrobe instead.
The cold darkness that oozes from the dark man is slowly starting to drown out her thoughts and her powers.
And as he takes down two mugs from the kitchen cabinet John wishes he was still holding Sherlock's hand.
“How was your flight?”, he asks. Just to fill the silence between them. Silences between them used to be familiar and comfortable but this one is new, different and it gets on Sherlock's nerves.
'You are not raising this bastard child on your own. We will lose the respect of the lords forever.'
“You know you like it”, he replied. Maybe that had come out a little bit more flirty than he had intended it to be. Usually when he found himself in this state he would have Mary on the other end. He just had his wires crossed. No big deal.
Sherlock is gorgeous. Stretched out underneath him. A slim frame with tight muscles, dark silken curls and the fairest skin John has ever seen on a man.
And if John was being completely honest with himself he had to admit he quite liked the promise of something unknown. An adventure. Some danger maybe. He felt happier than he had been in a long time.....more alive....more like himself.
“He confides in  you”, Mrs. Hudson says, “as I have never seen him confide in someone before....well....apart from his brother of course....God rest his soul. What I mean is, if what you were doing upstairs in his room will in any way bring harm to him, I will know where to find you and I know at least three ways to incapacitate a man with a hat pin.”
Sherlock still doesn't know and so he just waits patiently for John to finish his thought and in the end John does just that:
His lips sometimes on John's lips, then on his cheek, his forehead, his closed eyelids, slowly making their way across his jaw to his neck.
And yet.....spurred on by Finn and the pure magnetic power John seemed to have on him he had dared to pursue something of a friendship. He thought that would be alright.
I hadn't meant to set it free but somehow my body can't seem to be able to contain my emotions any longer.
“I.....”, John says, ready to say no....say he shouldn't....but then he realizes that maybe a drink is just what he needs. Maybe that will calm his nerves. Help him get rid of this strange feeling he gets whenever Holmes leans over to talk to him. So instead of finishing his sentence he just nods.
Sherlock closes his eyes as they kiss and, as long as he keeps them closed, he will not be able to see the sun going down around them.
During his childhood he had only met him a couple of times, but it had been enough to make a lasting impression.
“It is absolutely a compliment”, he says, “Sherlock.......”, once again he stops talking. Swallows what he was about to say because.....I don't know why. I can see him hold back, think, change his mind and say something else entirely, “I'll see you again on Monday at school, right?”
(Also, also: the magic scene between Sherlock and John is inspired by one of my favourite books. Ten bonus points if you can guess it).
Why does everything about him have to be elegant and dark and tall and.....John stops himself from finishing that thought.
“No magic”, he says. The full conviction he has in this idea must be written all over his face because as soon as Holmes looks at him he drops his hands voluntarily.
It appears I have found my groove with this story again. Pretty much all chapters have been planned out up until the final conclusion but I cannot tell you how many there will still be because I have this habit of writing more than I intend to and then splitting chapters up into 2 or sometimes even three parts......
And, indeed, only two hours later the first drops start to fall. Marking the parched earth with dark dots wherever they hit.
“Ah, sorry mate”, Bill had said. God, how Sherlock hated the sound of his voice, “he's not in. Gone off on some training mission without me. I'm not sure when they'll be back.
It took Sherlock about 30 minutes to get to where John was. His hands thrust into the pockets of his coat, a blue scarf wrapped tightly around his neck, his posture as tall, straight and elegant as always. Only the state of disarray of his curls gave away the fact that he might actually have been sleeping when John called him.
When Sherlock gets home Mycroft berates him for not seeking some kind of shelter and ushers him into the bathroom to get a warm shower.
In another dream he thought he was buried alive and in another horrifying dreamscape he thought his throat was actually made of glass and every time he coughed the glass would crack more until it finally shattered and separated his head from his neck for good.
Sherlock throws his head back and lets out another heavy sigh. He wishes he could just get up but he can't because then he might start packing again and there are only so many bright colours he can handle currently.
“We're sitting with John's new friend now”, Greg replies. John shoots Greg yet another look but again Greg completely ignores him.
Right now he's just tired. They've talked well past midnight. Well into the next day. Dawn is fast approaching and, however much he pretends he's completely fine, he still feels the ghost of that blasted fever coursing through his veins. He feels a headache coming on. The only way he'll be able to keep himself from being completely useless when morning does arrive is to retreat into his mind-palace, set things in order, organize....get some much needed clarity....and answers.
The soldier still does not flinch. There is a look in his eyes that says 'I am not afraid of death. I have seen it long ago already'.
Bill is lowering his voice just as John had done the last time they'd spoken to try and prevent the other recruits from overhearing, but, where John's raspy low voice had made Sherlock feel warm all over, the sound of Bill's nasal breathy whine makes his blood run cold.
By now the sun has risen again and now that the clouds of the previous days have moved on its light is far too bright as it shines directly in his eyes.
But it'll be a couple of days yet before we even have another class together and I didn't see him anywhere during lunch-break either.
Have they only been accepting him in their midst because John likes him so much and they like  John?
Downstairs I can hear my mother open the door, there is silence for a moment, then I hear her talking to someone and then she loudly calls my name.
Sherlock's voice in the early morning is slightly raspy and even deeper than his usual dark baritone and at the sound of it John can feel his cock stir beneath the blankets.
Slightly out of breath John lowered Holmes onto his bed. Immediately the nobleman stretched out and let out a contented sigh. John briefly pondered undressing the man more so he could sleep more comfortably, but the thought of undoing Master Holmes breeches made him so uncomfortable that he decided against it. In the end he only took of his riding boots to at least get as  little mud on his bed as possible.
Maybe it's something John sees on his face or maybe John just understands what he's going through but John does not wave him over.
If the John on holiday and the John here at school in his private life that he's lived for 17 years and counting are two vastly different people he has tried so hard to keep separate.
“How can we ever be anything to each other”, Watson says as he closes his eyes and Sherlock's fingers gently find their way to the back of his neck, “if the moment something happens you shut me out?”
The sound of feet on the paved stones at his back. Keeping their distance, but never falling too far behind.
I contemplate whether I should say anything about it to her or not but before I am able to reach a conclusion the doors to the cafeteria open and a rather rowdy bunch of boys streams in.
He's been having all these conflicting emotions, but for some reason, in this exact moment as Sebastian drones on and on he's never seen Sherlock more clearly.
But as he looked at John the blue of his eyes was murky and he had a far off stare. He was not out of the woods yet, but there was improvement.
Mary says nothing else. And somehow that's worse. The accusation in her silence somehow far louder than the one in the words she speaks.
The wallpaper not inanimate, as it had first appeared, but soft flesh lining the body of a living creature. Torn in several places, made visible as a gentle glow illuminated the hallway he apparently found himself in.
Apparently tonight was a night filled with questions that had no answer and so he asked another question instead:
John was silent for a while, his mouth still opened in disbelief as Holmes cleared his throat and peered into the oncoming dawn surrounding them now, his breath forming small clouds in the early morning air.
As he looked down he could see a hand firmly gripping his arm and as his gaze followed the delicate fingers upwards along a pale and yet muscular arm his eyes met those of Master Holmes. A wild and panicked look on his face as his curls stuck to his neck and face, wet with mist.
It was starting to get dark again. It was dangerous to be here alone after dark. Should he leave? Should he stay? Should he try and find sherlock?
Sherlock laughed again and this time the sound wasn't quite as cold as a little warm fondness was seeping through.
So I thought I needed to add the chapter at least where John and Sherlock meet. Give it a bit more substance.
I choose a background of black, because I am also dramatic, with a spattering of silver stars that seem to  move across the nails of my fingers as I hold them together.
I am already burning up underneath just the faintest of his touches but it still doesn't feel like enough.
“But if I have been given this phenomenal weapon, should I not at least try and use it for good?”, Watson had tried.
I finally reach what I believe is the door to the closet. At this time of day there is nobody around. For a moment I wonder if I should knock but in the end I decide to just go in.
Mycroft had been a master at this technique but, with the help of a self-made spell, Sherlock had perfected it.
He finds himself in complete darkness. The darkness like nothing he has ever experienced before. It seems to be alive around him as it pulses and moves and pushes against him.
At first John had resented her for it. Later he had admired her. That she could free herself so seemingly easily from the shadows of the past and lead her own life was something he desperately wanted to do too, but found he couldn't. However hard he tried.
It sounds like the buzzing of flies and the crowing of magpies. Like dead branches scraping across a window when you're in bed at night. Like someone laughing softly in a corner when you were sure you were home alone.
“A great evil force will rise in the Shadowlands. One set to conquer and destroy all.....But.... a powerful weapon will also be sent to earth by the Moon-goddess herself”, Finn says, “a weapon to end this fight once and for all. With it we will be able to defeat the most powerful of dark creatures.....unless they get their hands on it first.”
They sit like that for a while. Mycroft's arm protectively around Sherlock's shoulders. The body of his younger brother a comforting weight pressed to his side. He waits until the last of the tension leaves his small body and, finally, his breathing is once again calm and even.
Poor Molly Hooper had been sitting silently on the couch again. A far off look on her face. The contents of her tea cup still spillt all over the expensive looking carpet underneath. Finn had assumed she did not want to get herself involved in the current argument and he did not blame her.
He is reminded of that first time they met. Holmes and his horse had been back-lit by an ominous sky too then. And, just like before, it seems as if a piece of the dark night-sky has dislodged itself from the heavens to take on the shape of a horse and rider.
She looks at him again. Really looks at him. And then she sees it. Maybe he's not as good at hiding what he really feels as he thinks he is or maybe it's this place....drawing out deeply buried and unwanted memories.
“Oh heavens no”, Holmes replies as he lets himself fall backwards on the bed theatrically, “I'd never survive it.”
He's done so on more than one occasion, spurred on by Mycroft no doubt, he hardly ever finds anything. It just takes precious time Sherlock would rather spend otherwise.
He remembered a vague feeling of not being alone and then.....nothing.....until he had woken up again in the dark. Blood oozing from the walls. A heartbeat that told him he was, for the moment at least, still alive and a voice that had guided him back to the world of the living.
“They didn't even let me finish. They got so mad. Told me to stay away from you. Told me that this is exactly what happened to my sister.”
It's a collection of everything on display in the British Museum. He quickly skims through it and then puts it back again.
He just settles for admiring him from afar and convincing himself that that's definitely not creepy at all.
My lips find his just as easily as they have ever done and I moan into his mouth as he gently bites my lower lip.
Sherlock can still feel the ghost of the pressure of John's harsh kiss on his lips, the taste of him on his tongue and the feel of his breath on his face every time he exhales.
There are people to the left and right of him now. The empty space around him is quickly filling up and every now and then someone's shoulder brushes against his.
John had laughed softly, causing butterflies to dance around in Sherlock's stomach and he had gagged once again.
He does believe Holmes is smart, extraordinary and a powerful mage, but he does not believe he will find a solution that will avert the inevitable.
He desperately wants to touch Sherlock again but he's afraid that, once his fingers make contact, Sherlock's tense nerves will snap and he'll end up doing more bad than good.
Patrick disappears through the hallway and into the room ahead where the sound of music and voices is the loudest.
He licks a warm stripe from the hollow at the bottom of my throat all the way to the sensitive patch of skin just beneath my ear and I come undone. My eyes roll back and my knees go weak and I almost come in my pants.
The tone of Holmes' voice seems friendly enough but there's a dark undercurrent to it. There are sharp teeth hidden beneath his smile and John is not quite sure what Miss Astley has done to deserve such a treatment but he sure is glad it seems to be working.
So instead Sherlock tries to focus on the sound the wheels make as they come in contact with the uneven road below, the labored rumbling of the engine and the high pitched squeak every time John makes a right hand turn.
“This is the third time I find you facing the wrong end of the classroom. Care to share with the rest of the class what is so captivating back there?”
John deals the cards and neither of them speaks. He finds he likes this silence even less and so he racks his brain for something to say. In the end he settles for the thing he feels he should have said earlier but, he realizes, he never really did say.
Lost in thought his aimless feet had carried him to the edge of the field. And, where the rest of the meadow was devoid of flowers and color now that winter had come along, he was surprised to still find some growing here, tucked away right at the point where meadow met tree, hiding between the roots of a large oak.
John finds he doesn't care. As far as he is concerned the world doesn't exist anymore. There is nothing left but the two of them.
Trying to clear his mind. Chase away the fog that John's touch always seems to leave inside of his head whenever they are together.
John tries to shrug again, he tries to come off as aloof and unfazed but her words have struck a chord in him. Is he that transparent? Is everyone able to read him just like that?
Once again a soft smile was tugging at the corners of Sherlock's mouth as he shook his head, 'I'd rather live.'
They were both giggling now. Just generally relieved that the day was over and John was actually feeling confident about an upcoming test for once.
But then he changes his mind and places it right side up again. No matter how much those memories of happier times, more innocent times, hurt, he never ever wants to forget them.
Sherlock had followed the Watson family car to a pretty insignificant stretch of highway. Johns mother had parked the car by the side of the road and all three family members had gotten out. Sherlock had hidden a little further down behind a tree. At the moment John, his mother and his sister were gathered around something at the roadside. Sherlock was pretty sure that whatever they were gathered around was the 'thing', but because the family was standing in front of it he couldn't make out what it was. He wished he could see their expressions at least, but all three had their backs turned towards him. He could however still see the tension in Johns back and shoulders. Still all wrong.
So far neither of them has breathed a word about what happened in John's bedroom the weekend before.
John seems to draw some sort of conclusion from his silence because, after a couple of heavy moments, he gets up from his chair and lets out a long, equally heavy, sigh.
And as the soft air strokes his cheeks and ruffles his curls he closes his eyes and imagines he hears a voice in it as it sighs past his ears.
Every single year Sherlock has been in theater-class Mycroft has dropped him off for his performances. Once the show is over Mycroft will be there again to pick him back up and drive him home.
The clinical and deductive reasoning Sherlock had used to lay his past bare was very much like the way he solved math problems. There was no sentiment. There was just the truth. Unbiased by emotions and personal perspective. It was a new viewpoint that opened a path he had, up till now, completely missed. A path that perhaps led to some form of healing.
The knock on the door is hesitant and soft but Sherlock does not have a moment's doubt who it belongs to.
As their giggles quieted down a bit it seemed as if Sherlock was going to say something else, but just as he opened his mouth the door to the coffee-shop opened again. Someone else craving a late afternoon coffee no doubt. But as soon as Sherlock's gaze met this new customer he closed his mouth again abruptly. Swallowing the words still unspoken and John could practically see all his walls coming back up again as the light in his eyes dimmed and his lips formed a tight expression where once the warm and soft smiles had been.
“I can't believe you're still bothered by that”, Sherlock says. Rather loudly, as far as John is concerned, and so he shushes him before responding.
John couldn't believe what he was hearing. Who was this woman and what had she done with his mother? He had expected her to demand Sherlock be hanged, drawn and quartered...at least.
I paint my nails a dark blue because it reminds me of John's eyes and somewhere in a very secret corner of my heart I keep going back to what he so casually said to me not very long ago
Sherlock makes another soft noise as his long eyelashes flutter open for a second only to close again.
Illuminating a bed that has been recently slept in, the covers hastily thrown aside in a pile and the mattress still slightly warm with the leftover heat from two bodies.
“I'm not sure I understand what you're implying”, he says. Because he doesn't. Or maybe he does. But he just needs to get it absolutely clear.
As they rode out from under the trees and into the open the light of the full moon hit the polished metal of their horses bits and the buckles of their boots and belts and just for a moment John thought the earth and sky had turned themselves around and the line of silent, motionless riders was now gliding along amidst the stars.
Every unexpected sound that reached them had him covering John with his body protectively until it passed again and he was once again certain they were alone.
He had never felt for anyone what he felt for John. These feeling were new to him and he didn't know what to do with them.
The pain shooting through his brain not quite as sharp as before and the continuous sound of nails drawn across glass not quite as loud as it had been yesterday.
Sherlock helped him to his feet. They gathered their clothing but felt no need to dress and, taking his hand, Sherlock led him to a shallow cave at the edge of the meadow. It was partly hidden behind a tree and some bushes and with the entrance being slightly to the side you would probably miss it if you didn't already know it was there.
Mycroft's smile had widened and Finn had answered it with one of his own. This time he had put his arm around Mycroft as the spell turned brighter yellow still. Like sunlight.
He thinks back on the dreams he's been having ever since he and Holmes have been getting better acquainted.
Heaven forbid he'd have to suffer the embarrassment of anyone else finding out about his drug addict of a brother.
Sherlock had a clear way of explaining things and John soon realized he found the sound of his voice very pleasing. He felt like he could listen to it for hours. Even if the subject they were currently tackling was math.
Sherlock swallows. There have been so many times these last couple of months where he has felt like the unluckiest person in the world. Having his John be so far away from him. Not getting to even talk to him for weeks on end. At some times it had felt as if he was losing John. Losing him to the army. To another life. To a life where John, maybe, was happier. What did he have to offer John?
Finn shrugged dismissively and as he gently waved his hands through the air the fire roared back to life, 'don't tell me then.'
Sherlock sleeps for about an hour just after dawn while Finn just hides in the shade and glowers at the rising sun.
I nod but my feelings must be written all over my face because suddenly he is pressed back against me. Another soft kiss pressed swiftly to my lips. But it's too short and fleeting for me to truly enjoy or savor.
He silently curses his own stupidity as he drops his head on the surface of the bar. He feels his forehead stick to it slightly. He finds he doesn't care.
Remnants of a spell no doubt. Probably a disappearance spell. John now knows that's how Holmes is able to go about the estate pretty much as he pleases.
He just wasn't sure why Holmes had been acting so distant ever since he had woken up from his fever.
“You must be something really special, Sherlock Holmes”, Bill let's out another sad laugh, “because he never even looked at me.....doesn't look at anyone. He only has eyes for you and you're not even here!.........so.....in conclusion........I just want to say I'm sorry......for that.....trying to steal your man......”
John sounds groggy and still half asleep in the dark room and at the sound of it, for a moment, Sherlock is slightly warmer.
“It's a spell”, Holmes' gloomy reply, “the person....or creature.....that took her has left a spell behind so nobody remembers she was here.”
Something almost sad....or bored.....or both.......it's not always there. Only in the moments when her husband is not looking at her. You would have to look carefully to see it. Of course Holmes has seen it.
Time and time again his thoughts were transported back to his early morning trip with Holmes to the misty field and the events that had transpired thereafter.
It's a copy of Van Gogh's Starry Night. I got it because I think it's beautiful and because of the tragedy of the artist himself.
John did not take anything with him. He just wanted to get out. It was too warm inside. Too stuffy. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't concentrate.
John carefully evens his breathing out again, still feigning sleep, while he opens his eyes ever so slightly.
Sherlock had laughed as he had tried and failed and, very patiently again, had broken down the names in smaller parts to make their pronunciation easier. John had managed to get a couple of them right that time around, but not many.
Anyway, this chapter was supposed to be part of the previous chapter but it all got too long so I've split them into two separate chapters.
John's expression turns serious then as he gives him a scrutinizing look. Sherlock feels exposed, laid bare under it and he contemplates just making a run for it again. He's been this close to John before but that was at the coffee-place.....under the guise of practicing the play. This is a social setting, at school, where everyone can see them, and judge them, and wonder why on earth John is hanging out with Sherlock of all people.
And then he is there. Apparently he has found a way to cross the vast minefield between us and he is there.
The silence that followed hung heavy between them. The cave seemed to grow darker the longer it lasted.
John averted his eyes and kept silent. His father's hand like a vice on his shoulder. It hurt. Badly. It would bruise. But he couldn't let on that it did. Showing weakness was exactly what his father expected a “lowly” omega to do.
Sherlock is usually so good at pretending but he's having a hard time today. He can't concentrate on his notes. He finds himself only pretending to write so Watson won't catch on that he keeps stealing glances at him when he's not looking.
Enveloped by the warmth of Sherlock's coat and the smell of his aftershave (he really should ask him which scent he used someday) firmly nestled against his friend's shoulder as they sat side by side on the narrow plastic bus seats John found himself drifting in and out of consciousness continuously.
“Oh”, John says as if Sherlock has just woken him from a daydream, “I thought it would be nice to see the sunrise together......or......you know.......romantic......or whatever.....”
“Look”, Finn continued, “if I tell you all I know I'm pretty sure that Holmes here will want to be conscious for it. I think he'll have a thing or two to say himself. So stay here. Keep his temperature down......keep him alive.....and I will be back in one or two days at the most. Okay?”
“I've had a crush on Greg for ages”, she says and when I still remain silent she quickly points in the direction of a sturdy boy with short dark hair and a wide grin.
John's tender fingers on his wrist, the side of his neck, John's lips on his only to disappear, his strong hands pushing on his chest......
Like needles being pricked into her skin constantly only when she tries to grab at them she finds nothing but air and her palms remain empty.
John coughed and got up. Finn was too close. Holmes was too close. He needed space. He needed to think. Of course it wasn't a magpie. It could be any bird. Finn was absolutely right. Just because he was having strange dreams and visions didn't mean it was all connected.
And, as far as Sherlock knows, they are both still pretty much the golden couple of the school and John is loyal almost to a fault.
Something to take away the sharp edges that day to day life brings and submerge himself into blissful forgetfulness.
'Uhn....John', Sherlock moaned. His face flushed as he bit his bottom lip and John felt him tremble underneath his right hand.
Something that I've kept inside of me for far too long has been set free. I feel so much lighter for it. It gives me hope that I might be able to set things right with John after all. If I am able to talk after years and years of silence then maybe he will be able to set free some of those words he keeps hidden inside of him as well.
The feeling of shame, guilt and embarrassment that had first crept up on him in the middle of the night underneath the flashing lights of an ambulance now seems to grow with every passing minute.
There are bookcases lining the walls but a lot of the books in the room are just scattered haphazardly across the floor, on chairs, the big heavy oak desk placed in front of the far window and pretty much every flat surface in the room.
His bedside alarm-clock read 1:00 am. John was still not asleep. Somehow he could not stop his mind from racing. Trying to find answers while the questions themselves weren't even all that clear to him.
Now he would never know the sound of her voice, the shape her lips formed when she smiled, the smell of her skin, how it felt to hug her, if she liked wildflowers, if she liked to read......if she......
“For the love of.....”, by now his brother has stopped eating as well. Sherlock can feel him getting aggravated.
“Do you think you'll ever get a girlfriend?” John asks Sherlock. They are in Sherlock's front yard now. Every so often John comes to find him just to ask him stupid questions like this.
They did not have much time for kissing left either, however lovely it was, because, spurred on by Sherlock's loving ministrations and the sweet and strong scent of alpha that surrounded him, John's heat had now peaked.
He had told John that if the fairies were to find him they would surely make him into one of their servants as well. He did not wish that fate on anyone. He had looked so sad when he spoke that John had wrapped him up in his arms and had kissed every inch of his skin until all thoughts of the fairies had left him and their world was brought back to nothing but each other.
The oncoming evening is, so far, nothing more than a hint on the horizon as him and Holmes had both decided that leaving sooner rather than later would be for the best.
After a couple more minutes he reluctantly made his way back to his bedroom, but when he got there: Sherlock was gone.
He was only let out briefly for about an hour at most every day and always under the watchful eye of his father.
John gingerly crosses the threshold. He somehow feels as if he's being invited into a vampires lair.
“Now I know why you're so lovesick. He's just about the straightest guy at school. Very popular too. He's had scores of girlfriends.”
Once the bond-bite was given he'd be tucked away in some castle. Used whenever he was in heat until he had produced the correct number of heirs. The bite-scars on his neck as close to an actual chain as could be.
I am so lost in my own thoughts that it takes me a couple of seconds to realize his hand is on mine.
I pretend not to know what she's talking about. And, to be fair, I don't know what she's talking about. Not entirely at least.
Suddenly the stars overhead have lost their appeal. No longer are they gentle lights blinking at them harmlessly but giant, flaming balls of gas. Or bombs. Ready to drop down and kill either one of them in an instant.
'You have a motorcycle?! Why am I not surprised'  there was a hint of amused exasperation to Johns voice.
When he wakes up again the room is flooded with the light of day, outside the window he can hear the chattering of birds, the bed beside him is empty and cold. On the pillow is a note in familiar handwriting.
Until quite recently this had been the only glimpse into his mind palace Morgana had been able to get.
Holmes' smile widened at Johns teasing reply. 'Figures', he said, 'can I ask you for another favor then?'
“I don't know”, the stranger says, tone of voice still laced with barely contained rage, “you've got a weird look on your face....I don't like it.”
“Good......good....”, he says, “but....maybe.....you boys shouldn't tell Mrs. Watson just yet. Her views are a bit more.....traditional than mine. She might have a hard time accepting.....this.....”
Finn turned towards John in his saddle, the movement of his body just as smooth and elegant as that of his horse and the smile on his face was now down-right mischievous.
John eventually did fall asleep. After hours and hours of restless and frustrated turning his eyes finally closed of their own accord and sleep overtook him.
For a moment Sherlock is puzzled as to what he is supposed to feel. There are so many sensations there. The texture of John's skin, the soft dusting of hairs that covers it, the warmth of the living body underneath that he so adores....the.......and then he does feel it:
John and Greg are leaving the class-room together and John throws him one more warm smile before he ducks his head.....almost shy....and heads through the door.
There's the world where I am allowed to touch him and the world where he won't even so much as look at me.
She jumped at the sound, her face slightly flushed from the work and one lock of her blond hair swung in a neat ringlet in front of her face when she lifted her head. With her hands occupied elsewhere she tried blowing it away, but it bounced right back.
The only thing alive and awake as the rest of the meadow's plant-life lay dormant as it patiently waited for spring.
Sebastian is right though. Now that Sherlock is no longer helping him with his work he is almost guaranteed to fail his next test and get taken off of the rugby team as a result.
'Did you hear what happened last night!' she blurted out as soon as John was close enough to hear her.
If he doesn't concentrate too hard on the searing pain in his arm and leg or the agonized screams all around him he can almost imagine it is just another nice summer's day.
I told him that I didn't want to be his dirty little secret but after last weekend I'm afraid that that's exactly what I'm starting to become.
I take off my shoes and lie down on my bed still fully clothed. I don't have any energy left to undress. I don't have any energy left period.
“What....?” all Holmes is able to say before he goes quiet as he sees the look of absolute horror on John's face.
I find I really don't care because John's hand that's not currently already wrapped around me finds its way to where my own arm lays on the armrest between our seats.
The flickering candles cast strange shadows on Mrs. Hudson's face and the folds of her dress and the old lady with a bun somehow manages to look menacing because of it.
There's blood. Everywhere. Along the wood framing the door. Oozing out from between the uneven seams of the brickwork. Spilling out from underneath the door. Making its way slowly towards their feet. John steps back as the flood gets closer and closer, pulling a still very confused Holmes with him as his stomach lurches violently.
Already his sentences are starting to get fragmented. He's pulling his defenses back up and I can see him disappear behind them.
Against all the overwhelming odds he's about 99% sure John likes him....romantically. Something in his stomach flutters at the mere thought.
“Just....after....afterwards”, he says. Still not meeting Sherlock's eyes, “I still need to talk to you. So don't....don't go running off on me okay?”
Whenever Sherlock used to go to rugby games to secretly watch John he never fit in with the other supporters. He didn't know how to cheer or behave himself....he hardly even knows what the rules to rugby actually are.
After finishing his soup, wincing and coughing at nearly every swallow, his mother had left him alone again so he could try and get some sleep.
He still wants to wrap Holmes up in his arms. Undress him and kiss the tension away that seems to inhabit every inch of his body now.
The more he examined Holmes the more he became convinced that the condition that ailed his master at the moment was not something he was able to handle.
Because, suddenly, John's hand is in mine and he gives me a smile that almost makes me believe we are at a sun-soaked beach again and he starts pulling me towards the rugby-group.
There is a small spark in the center of the swirling blackness that is consuming Holmes at the moment.
But, as absolutely abhorrent and ghastly the sight of the creature is, John finds that the face is the absolute worst.
But no......he couldn't know.....after that night John had never once talked to him about it.....in fact he'd never talked to him at all.........never given him a knowing glance to let him know John remembered.
He is looking forward to seeing Molly Hooper again. He had quite liked her the first time they met. She reminds him of himself in some strange way.
Sherlock flops himself down in the chair opposite Finn with a heavy sigh. If he's sitting down at least he'll stop himself from packing anything else. Finn will keep on talking to him regardless of what he's doing. He has come to terms with that fact many, many years ago.
Granted, it's not a very good plan but after laying awake for almost the entire night it's all he has and he's tired and groggy and if this is what he's got to work with then so be it.
He takes his hand away and writes something else on the piece of paper but I keep on ignoring him and pretend I'm following the lecture again.
The air of otherwordlyness he bore around him having been almost palpable as it fitted him like a well worn cloak.
John looks surprised, caught off guard.....a bit hurt......maybe.....the look is gone before Sherlock can make anything of it.
“They're expecting to see you in about an hour......there's probably some actual clothes in the wardrobe.”
He closed his eyes again. No. He did not wish his thoughts to go there. Not now. Another cold gust of wind hit him and he turned his face into it until his eyes started to water.
It had been at least an hour and a half since the fair haired gentleman had left to join the other party-goers at the house and John had finished up with the last of his tasks about 30 minutes ago. At the moment he was sitting on the old chair in the least drafty corner of the barn huddled in the biggest blanket he could find. He had his left leg stretched out in front of him. It was still hurting, but sitting like this made the pain slightly easier to bear.
“It's tomorrow”, I say, “so if you've already got something else going on I completely understand.....”
The game continues as if nothing has happened. John feels as if he can breathe again for the first time that day and Holmes wins another round.
Watson gingerly and awkwardly holding the medallion in his outstretched palm while the others just stare at him in anticipation.
He'll have to try and ask her stealthily this afternoon. Maybe when John goes to get them their usual coffee....
“John and I are going to the after-party together”, she says, “I don't think it would be appropriate for you to be there too don't you......gosh, what's your name again?”
“If you don't mind me saying so, sir”, the girls says, “Master Holmes.....your “friend” is very handsome....you both are.”
At the sound of his voice I flinch and the pen drops from my restless fingers and rolls onto the ground.
Hiding just at the fringes of her own mirrored image....of her own being....trying its very best to stay unnoticed until its too late....
As he makes his way down the stairs that lead to the stables there is a constant, faint humming sound in his ears and his skull feels several sizes too small for his brain.
As a heat quite contradictory to the wintry chill suddenly warmed his body John rolled over on his belly, stuffing his face in the mattress as he squeezed his eyes tightly shut. His thoughts should definitely not go there. Once Holmes returned, whenever that may be, he should apologize for his transgressions.
Sherlock Holmes stretches out his hand to the swirling wall of mist in front of him and slowly dips his fingers inside of it.
And just as Holmes starts twisting his fingers in the air, minute particles of magic appearing in between them, making the air crackle and pop, the beginnings of a spell, John raises his own and pulls Holmes' hands down most violently.
He'll stop by England and Eton first. He'll spend the night there and then he'll catch his actual flight to America tomorrow.
I have decided to devide Miss Hooper's tale into three parts so expect a third installment sometime....
And with that he stepped back further. Out of Sherlock's reach, making his hands slide away from the small of his back. Taking all the warmth with them.
Not for the first time he wonders if he will ever be able to put into words all the things that  make John Watson so special.
He's so wrapped up in thinking of a way to ask Molly about “Person X” that he only realizes John is standing in front of him when he hears his voice.
'I'm only trying to help you John. Meeting you here...like this.....I'm sure your father would not have....'
“I did warn you”, Mary says but her eyes are no longer focused on John. She is staring off into the distance behind him. Seemingly just talking to herself.
It was as if nothing had changed. As if John had never left. As if this was just a continuation from last time. As if he had just briefly closed his eyes while they had been talking and upon opening them found them still exactly the same.
He seems to like a lot of things tonight. The movie-theater, how I look, my posters, my room......so I feel like I just have to ask:
To John it had always seemed as if his mother blamed him for his father's death. Maybe it had been because he had been the one to find him. The one to break the news. As if, if he hadn't screamed and cried, if he hadn't seen, nobody would have and so, in a way, it would not have been true.
Today is Thursday and that means I'm helping Mr. hall after school. This also means I leave school later than usual and I miss my first bus.
He always felt that, were he to throw this specific photograph away, he would also be throwing out these two smiling, happy boys. He'd be burying them.
He held on tight and as the fairies moved away between the trees, never to be seen again, the moon bathed the clearing in brilliant white light. An island of moonbeams just for the two of them where sorrow could no longer enter.
“I'm......sorry”, he says. Because he also assumes that's something people say in situations like this.
With so little time left before they will be inevitably parted anyway he figures they might as well go down in flames.
He could ask her but if he does and she doesn't know what he's talking about.....it would be a dangerous move.....it would be showing his hand.....and he doesn't feel comfortable showing his hand around Mary.
He ends up sitting on a low wall at the edge of the emergency-parking lot at the back of the hospital until day breaks around him in effervescent purples and oranges and yellows.
Finn's lips shape themselves into a small smile again as the fire crackles and Holmes shifts in his chair. Holmes' hands are still underneath his chin and he still seems miles away. The room around them that is not lit by the flames - the corners...the ceiling - make such a stark contrast with the bright orange light that surrounds them that to John it feels as if there is truly nothing there. That their world ends where the strength of the light wanes and darkness begins.
He also found he had more important things to worry about than drinking and inane chatter with people he didn't really know....or wanted to know.
The steady flow of time has drowned many details of that first encounter in its tumultuous and murky waters but there are some aspects of it that still seem as clear as if they only happened yesterday.
It is a sound like fingers running up and down frayed nerves. Nails plucking. Teeth being pulled. Molly wants to cover her ears but she finds she can't because the soldier is pulling her along.
He carefully glances up at Sherlock from underneath his eyelashes. Sherlock is sat at the opposite side of the table, reading a book as he usually does, patiently waiting for John to ask him to help with an equation he can't quite get the hang of. When he does Sherlock will pick up his chair and move it right next to John's. He will have to lean over the table to be able to reach the book John is currently working in. His curls will accidentally brush against John's cheek and their thighs will touch. His radiant blue eyes will stare into John's as he explains the answer and John will not be able to keep his eyes away from the curve of his lips as he talks and the baritone of his voice seems to rattle his insides as it moves right through him.
John felt like he had put up with a lot of harassment and nonsense over the last couple of days, but as Wallace's tongue slithered across the whorl of his ear like some kind of slimy fish something in him snapped.
Beside him Finn sits straight. His eyes shine like rubies in the light of the moon and there are drops of water in his hair that make it seem as if he's wearing a crown of stars.
He kisses John again where he has backed him up against the door while his hands make quick work of John's belt and jeans.
John couldn't help but giggle before he drifted back to sleep. The last conscious thing he noticed before they reached their final destination were Sherlock's fingers gently brushing his shoulder as he wrapped his arm around him to keep him from falling over at the next sudden stop.
Outside a car alarm suddenly goes of startling Sherlock  and as his eyes shoot open he pulls his head back. John lets the lock of hair he was holding slide through his fingers and sits back.
By the time the rehearsals end Sherlock feels tense again. He's unsure what's going to happen next. He doesn't like not knowing.
'Why are we here?' John asked. Unsure. The thoughts that had kept him awake last night suddenly returned. Why had Homes brought him here? So far away from any living soul. With no one around to see or hear. Once again he was reminded of how little he knew about the man.
“Watson....”, his voice was soft, but the panic that clung to his words was loud and clear, “you're not supposed to be here. You can't be here.”
'Yes.... I am bound to her. Bound to do her bidding. You see...I am not a free man and so I cannot make the choices a free man makes....', here he kissed him again. A little more urgently this time, '….however much I would like to.'
Eventually lunch-break does come. I hurry to the cafeteria and I actually reach our table before Molly does. Even-though Molly and Greg are now an item she still chooses to sit with me and I respect her for that.
From within the gray wall around him John could hear sounds. The sounds of wings beating together. Of course the birds would be there, but they were hiding within the mist, just out of sight, waiting to strike and tear him to pieces once again. The sound of beating wings was getting ever closer now and the wall of fog surrounding him was turning into dark, black clouds. In his dream John closed his eyes, braced himself and waited. Ready to accept the fate he knew would inevitably come.
“Come on, Sherlock”, Molly whispers as she leans over the table. The tip of her long ponytail, draped over her shoulder, brushes against the table-top as she does so, “you've got to give me something. Did he come over to your house again?”
“Only one can activate the weapon and it has happened”, the voice says, “you were there, you know where it is and now you will bring it to us.”
He decided to dismount and, leading his horse by the reins, made his way on foot towards the welcome sound of moving water.
He reaches the other side of the house and at first, in the dark of the night, nothing seems different here either but, just as he is about to turn around something, just in the corner of his sight, catches his eye.
“I....”, I say. But that's as far as I get. I don't know what else to say. Am I dating a rugby-guy? I don't know. We've only been on one date. We've kissed a couple of times and every-time we do I forget everything around me and it feels as if I'm being consumed by a thousand tiny fires that blaze through my veins and nerves and heart. I've given him a drunken hand-job once. I secretly wish I could give him a non-drunken hand-job. I want to undress him every time I see him and discover every inch of him. Blaze trails along the vast expanse of his skin with the tips of my fingers, my lips, my tongue....I want to know him. I want to know what he's thinking at all times. I want to talk to him and cloak myself with the dark timbre of his voice. I don't want to talk to him. I just want to look at him. I want to see him and I want him to see me. Drown in the depths of his eyes. Breathless, comforted, private, together.
'Good, good', the smile had left Holmes' face again and he was looking anywhere but at John now. As if he was unsure where to begin. A couple of uncomfortable moments of silence slid by before he regained his composure and continued speaking: 'when we parted last time I fear my actions may have given you the wrong idea.'
As the door on the passenger's side of the car is flung open for him he keeps his eyes closed tightly and he imagines:
There's also the risk of getting caught if they lounge around here naked while the rest of the household comes alive.
He hopes John can see that at least. That he never meant to hurt him. That he had only meant to hurt himself.....or keep himself from hurting....sparing the both of them the hurt of a goodbye....but somehow.....not having had one now hurts more.
After 8pm the line got disconnected by default and most of the time the recruits weren't even around.
He is usually a lot better with fire magic than he is with water magic but there seems to be an abundance of magic in the world lately and the spell works without any trouble.
His voice has a warm and melodic air to it and even though he's apologizing he's got that kind of voice that always seems to be hiding a smile just beneath the surface and....
It had started out as a wonderful evening and perhaps he had indulged himself a little bit too much.
If he had wanted to tell Sherlock he would have probably done so last night when they were talking on the phone.
“Let's just sit for a bit and we'll look for the keys later. I'm sure they'll turn up”, John continues. Lovely smile still on his face. His ash blonde hair sweeps flatteringly across his forehead and his muscled shoulders and arms, from this close, remind Sherlock of an actual Greek god.
'I will', John had lied. They had hugged and said their farewells and now John was here. At the Holmes estate. Once again he sighed and stretched out his hand towards the bell.
Sherlock dislodges their lips momentarily but he doesn't move away far. His hands are still wrapped around Watson. Pulling their bodies close together and Watson's arms still rest on his shoulders as his fingers play with the curl at the nape of his neck.
He looked at himself in the mirror and sighed as his reflection stared back looking equally confused.
John...smiling....outside....there's a bright sun behind him in a cloudless blue sky.....his skin is tanned.....probably taken on a holiday.
Because I know how John can treat me now. I know how it feels to have him giggle against the bare skin of my abdomen. To have him tell me he likes me. That he likes being with me. That he wants to be with me....
Andrew writes some more on the paper and I lean over impatiently to try and read what it is before he's done.
If they press on and ride all through the night they will reach the Hooper estate just before dawn. So press on is what they do.
After having been away for so long I wanted to give you all an early update because you've all been so kind and patient.
So John was caught completely off guard when the stable doors opened and, as he turned around to see who would visit so late in the evening, he was greeted by the sight of a much more coherent Master Holmes.
“Don't worry”, she says, “It's just that I've seen that look before. My brother is gay. It's made my 'gaydar' quite strong and”, she pauses for a moment as she leans her chin on the palms of her hands while her elbows rest on the table and stares wistfully in the direction of the rugby table, “they are quite dreamy.”
At first Sherlock doesn't respond and John is afraid he's read the situation all wrong. That, now that he's finally figured out what all these feelings he's been having towards Sherlock are, Sherlock will tell him they are unrequited.
John put his name in his phone. Last name and all. And looking at the number it doesn't even seem to be a fake number either.
Every time John calls him he vows to himself that this.....surely, this will be the last time he takes John up on his offer.
The smile on Sherlock's face turns downright mischievous and John feels his stomach flip upside down at the sight of it.
The room is shrouded in its usual darkness but this time there are no shadows or whispers to taunt him.
John is puzzled for a moment but before he can ask Molly to elaborate she has already turned around and is making her way back towards the house.
Silence again and for a moment John thought Sherlock was not going to speak. That this was the last conversation they were to have.
This time the smile Watson gives him is more sincere. He leans down over the bed and gives Sherlock one last, far too chaste, kiss.
His father had told him that he had a duty now. The same one he had and Mycroft had. Sherlock could glimpse his brother standing in a corner of the room. His arms crossed. Looking once again very old. His brother had stayed silent.
For a moment Watson doesn't say anything. Then he puts two and two together and actually throws his head back and laughs.
And John had to admit she was right. Everybody looked absolutely stunning. As he looked around he saw more silk than he'd ever thought to see in his entire lifetime. Pretty soon he spotted the two daughters of the widowed Mrs. Holmes. They both wore silk dresses in a light blue color with skirts so big he wondered if they were actually able to pass through the door at all. They both looked equally uncomfortable. Mrs. Holmes was standing a little ways back, talking to an older gentleman. Her dress was a bit more sober than the ones her daughters wore. The color was a darker blue and it had velvet trimmings along the neckline. It still looked incredibly expensive.
The darkness swallows them greedily but I still know they're there. I can feel them at the edges and corners of the room.
'I'm going to have to take these off as well',  John said. More to himself than to anyone else. At this point he was fairly sure Master Holmes wasn't hearing a word he said as he slipped in and out of consciousness.
It reminds Sherlock of something. A memory maybe.....another moment that he both feels he has and hasn't lived through yet.
And so that Thursday John entered the library with a spring in his step, his head held high and a massive grin on his face.
The feeling of Watson's strong muscles under his own hands as he led him through dance under the spell of moonlight and alcohol.
And now, somehow, he seemed to have found himself a job at the household of the only Dark Mage in the entire county, witnessing Sherlock's spells and seeing through them time and time again where no one else could. And Sherlock had felt drawn to him like a moth to a flame.
John still gets them coffee but instead of asking Molly what she wants this time he just forgot her order entirely.
“So you're saying.....I have you until the afternoon?” There is a playful smile on Watson's lips now that promises all kinds of newfound delights.
He wasn't technically supposed to use any spells on this side of the mist, but he was pretty sure that tonight sort of counted as an emergency. He knew his stepmother well enough by now. If she failed to set her daughters up with anyone, which would undoubtedly be the case, both girls were as bland and uninteresting as they came; a result of their mothers strict upbringing no doubt, she would redirect her attention to him. As far as his stepmother was concerned a ball was not a complete success unless someone got engaged.
He looks down at the cup of tea in his hands. He knows he should be drinking it but somehow he cannot bring himself to do so. By now the sun has completely set. The small room is lit by nothing but a couple of candles.
Once again Holmes chuckles. This time John can pinpoint the emotions that cling to the sound. There is a form of dejected anger there but also a deeper sadness. A melancholy over things that have not even happened yet.
Really, John thought, puns? As he suppressed the urge to roll his eyes and tried to discreetly fold his jacket over his crotch area. His mother however seemed mightily pleased with this answer.
# In the ballad Tam Lin is not being taken to the fairy realm, but he is going to be sacrificed to hell on Halloween as part of the fairy tithe. Tithe is the best word ever and I tried so hard to work it in but I couldn't seem to do it. I'm still sad about this.
I turn my head to the side and look at John. His back still turned towards me. Strong and straight in every sense of the word.
She's not complaining though. Because when it hit her she had her wits about her and had taken advantage of the situation.
He is suddenly reminded of all those lonely years before John came out to his porch that night with his rumpled shirt and untied shoes.
The man produces a police badge from somewhere inside of the folds of his jacket and shows it to John.
It takes the cab about 20 minutes to reach its destination. John is pretty sure the driver has taken some liberties where the route is concerned. He saw a couple of streets at least twice.
He pushes the phone closer to his ear. He needs the pain now. It might help numb out the overwhelming sadness that is trying to choke him when he thinks of all the minutes he could have had with John had it not been for Bill.
“Why haven't you told them yet?” he asks. He tries desperately to keep the hint of panic out of his voice.
Anything is better than this awkward silence where he has nothing to distract him from the lie that has become his life. Not just today but, maybe, for years now. Silence makes things he chooses to forget drift to the front of his mind again.
All John could do was look at him in disbelief. Wondering what the connection between Finn and Holmes actually was. Apparently the elf had a rather intimate knowledge of his masters body.
'Ah', Sherlock interjected as his eyes went back to his book again and he flipped to the next page, 'no, I don't do high school parties.'
On top of that Sherlock himself was not as cool and stern as he had initially seemed. As the hours passed by on occasion the cool and distant look he bore on his face would make way for something much softer. A hint of a smile just barely visible tugging at the corners of his mouth as the stern line of his lips softened marginally.
But we have to see this through. All of us. Because time will  not stop. It is a river and we are adrift and helpless on its tumultuous and dangerous waters.
He wishes, not for the first time, that he actually had some halfway decent dancing skills, that he was braver, that he had a good opening line prepared.....
Molly doesn't comment on it but she scrunches her nose every time she takes a sip and ends up only drinking half of it.
It takes a couple of seconds for John to understand what he's saying but then he just laughs. The sound light as the rays of the sun itself and Sherlock warms himself in them as the dark spots that obscure his vision temporarily disappear taking some of the fog in his mind with them.
Finn was still staring straight ahead at the road as he sat firmly upright on his horse, but his posture was just on the wrong side of tense, his grip on the reins just a bit too tight.
But there are still so many steps left until he will find himself even remotely within John's league.
Suddenly there are tears on his face and the blackness around him topples over and swallows him like a blanket.
Before John can give any more thought to this strange statement Holmes moves the conversation along.
“And I promise”, Bill continues. His tone of voice much lighter now that he has cleared his conscious, “if you call again and he is here I will get him for you immediately.........you know......if you call this Thursday around 5pm you should be able to catch him.”
Something fundamentally had changed. John could feel it. In his chest, his gut, swirling just underneath his skin making him feel warm all over.
He knows he's not a real man because his face is nothing but a black void and when he speaks his voice comes out as static.
“I'll see you again tomorrow, yeah?” John says. He seems so unsure of himself. As if he doesn't know that Sherlock would follow him to the ends of the earth if he would allow it.
Another awkward silence. John noticed absentmindedly that Sherlock was wearing his purple shirt again.
They are both breathing fast. John feels as if he's been running for hours. His muscles are tense and every joint in his body hurts. A faint throb in his head now all that remains of the all encompassing pain from before.
She's talking about her brother. Apparently he's got a new boyfriend but he's constantly complaining to her about him because said boyfriend has a mustache which makes kissing uncomfortable...apparently.
He places both of his hands on the back of Holmes' neck and gently guides him forward. The space between them grows smaller still and then it disappears altogether as their lips make contact and John kisses him.
And to his even greater despair he realized he would not be able to keep himself upright like this for long as he felt his left shoulder starting to ache with a familiar stinging pain as his torn tendons were stretched beyond their limits.
He just smiles that polite smile he gives her every time she talks to him and my mother practically melts at the sight of it.
Sherlock is talking to the soldier now. They are both smiling. Molly knows that type of smile. She's seen it before many times. It is a smile she had hoped to bear herself one day but some things are just not meant to be.
Sherlock laughed again. This time the sadness was even more profound and it almost sounded like a sob.
John lived for their moments together and inside him a feeling grew that he did not dare give a name to.
Our feet are sinking away in that deep layer of muddy sand right at the edge of the shore that the waves leave behind each time they retreat.
Mary had given him some very peculiar sideways glances, but she had known better than to comment on it.
Or maybe there's someone out there who is willing to do it for me.....if there's anyone who would find this usefull of course.
'Now I know something is coming I'll be ready',he replied. 'What does it look like?' Somehow he felt no fear at all. John Watson was not a man to shy away from a fight. If he was perfectly honest with himself he found that the prospect of danger sparked a part of him back to life that he had been missing for a long time. He felt younger for it.
As the warmth of the newly kindled fire reached him Sherlock felt his muscles relax once again. 'Thank you, Finn'.
John barely registered what his teachers were saying. All he could think of was Sherlock. Sherlock who was an alpha, but who apparently also belonged to the Fey.
John smiles. It is a false, tight thing. He smiles a lot of fake smiles lately. Sherlock hates it. It makes him feel cold. It is as if a cloud has drifted in front of his sun, blocking out the light and warmth, and it hasn't seemed to have moved in years now.
The dark man just raises his free hand and, where Sherlock's magic is made up out of light, his magic is made up out of pure darkness. Look at it for too long and you'd swear you'd gone blind.
He is waiting in the inn's dining area at the bottom of the stairs for Watson to finish getting dressed and come down.
'What about it?' Holmes reply a gravely whisper in his ear as he now stood so close to his side that he felt the warmth of his body against him.
He had recently done some remodeling and had probably forgotten to lock it behind him. He had gotten careless. He just wasn't used to these kinds of emotions. This was exactly the reason why he had kept to himself all these years.
'Mary and I were just friends, Mrs. Hudson', he said. Hoping she would not misinterpret the sudden rush of colour to his cheeks.
His friend swallows, but makes no attempt to stop John so he moves his fingers up further still until they reach the back of Sherlock's neck and, providing gentle pressure, to which Sherlock responds all too willingly, he guides his friend's head down just a fraction in order to gently brush his lips against that soft Cupid's bow just as he's secretly been wanting to do for months now.
“I don't think I'll ever be ready”, John says and he gives him a small smile that doesn't reach his eyes.
The fact that I don't must be clearly written on my face because John chuckles as he looks at me and pulls me a little bit closer.
He decides to keep his eyes closed for the moment and just concentrate on his immediate surroundings one sense at a time.
Suddenly he sees a small light in front of him and as he makes his way towards it the light turns into a hole in the void around him.
Once again swirling lights form in the darkness around them as he does so although not nearly as intense as before.
But back then, finding himself only at the first chapter of their joined story, he had felt more alive than he had ever been.
The hard plastic it's made of is uncomfortable and hurts his back and still slightly tender backside.
Together they weave a spell. Sitting on the floor, side by side, Sherlock's small hands following along in the pattern that his brother's long fingers weave in the air.
“That kind of knowledge could prove to be extremely dangerous”, Holmes finally says, “I've endangered him enough already.”
“Just.....be safe.....yeah?” he says and Sherlock bathes in the warm honeyed tones of his voice one last time before he will inevitably never be able to speak to John again....ever.
Sherlock looked up from his book. One eyebrow raised questioningly. The obstinate curl dangling in front of it.
But the seats on the bleachers are narrow. And if the game is going to be as busy as Greg predicted the bleachers are going to be packed. If he wants to covertly leave he'll have to precariously pass by rows and rows of people.....who will have to get up to let him pass....a move like that will be noticeable.
Like Finn he does suspect the author of the magpie mark but how they were able to also cast the spell without him noticing.....
If John didn't know better he could almost fool himself into thinking that that's all this is: a pleasant trip out into the country between two men.
No longer was the sky a bright blue with the sun settled directly above them, but, as they had been engrossed in conversation with each other, the sun had continued its inevitable descent down the heavens and now only barely hovered above the horizon. The sky was streaked through with red, orange and purple hues.
Alcohol made him feel less. Drowned out his thoughts and the memory of a soon to be ghost dressed in black looking at him with sad eyes.
Where the creature jerks and shambles it flows and drapes itself elegantly forward across the floor and the furniture.
They still found themselves in the middle of the fields. They were no where near any village or settlement as far as John could see. The only thing out of the ordinary were two piles of bricks that lay a couple of feet away from each other. It seemed that years ago a small brick wall must have been built here, dividing the field into two parts, but it appeared to have been broken down a long time ago. Two piles of moss grown shattered bricks all that remained now.
But then again....what was Sherlock even supposed to think..... they had hadn't seen each other in months.
John is talking to him but somewhere in the ether between them the words are transformed into music and they lose their meaning.
little ghost,' he had said as he planted a kiss on the top of his head and Sherlock had immediately felt warmer.
My feet are unsteady and somehow don't feel like my own but my footfall gets more sure with every step I take away from the house.
Sherlock finds that, on some level, he is relieved that their fragile equilibrium seems to have remained intact but another part of him.....if he looks deeper......he finds is also a little bit disappointed.
John tries his best to school his features but some of it at least must be written all over his face because instantly the smile falls from Holmes' own and his expression turns serious once more.
It's somewhere between embarrassment, the guilt you feel when someone catches you doing something you shouldn't be doing and......something else. It is followed by a brief smile before John turns back to the front of the class, slumps even lower in his chair and Greg chuckles smugly as he prods John with his elbow, turns around as well and gives Sherlock a smug smile and.....was that an actual wink?
He thought about calling out for Sherlock, but something about the fog made him feel uneasy. Made him feel like he probably shouldn't make too much noise or draw attention to himself.
'I myself have some magical powers and I try to use them for a cause I believe is right. There are more things in this world than most people can even imagine. Most people can't even see it unless you rub their noses in it. But you......you saw something, didn't you?'
He's not quite sure how to finish that sentence and so instead he does take another sip from his beer. His hand only trembles slightly.
They are both on horseback. Their pace leisurely as they ride side by side and the village grows smaller and smaller in the distance behind them.
But he didn't try. At least not enough. And so he remained an omega and his father remained disappointed and there was nothing that could be done and they were all miserable for it.
Sherlock stays seated for a couple moments more. There's only so much of John smiling at him he can take before his legs turn to jelly.
His heart seems to speed up now. Perhaps trying to make up for all the heartbeats lost during this conversation.
Mycroft's feet, at the end of his long legs, are firmly planted on the floor while Sherlock's dangle somewhere halfway between seat and ground.
“John”, Sherlock whispers. The sounds of his baritone voice so low now that John feels it vibrate through the very core of his being. He only just manges to keep himself from kissing Sherlock again, but it is a near thing. He thinks about kissing Sherlock while he's talking and goes a bit weak at the knees.
He remembers the dwindling daylight casting long shadows in the curves of the naked body beneath him.
John looks at Holmes but he doesn't seem to be in any mood to explain himself and so Finn continues for him:
Like Mycroft the boy had had a great talent for magic but, unlike Mycroft, he had a blatant disregard for authority. Especially The Order.
He had been so fixed on finding a white horse that he had failed to see what was right in front of him.
The light of the dying sun drips from his surprisingly long eyelashes like golden honey and his skin almost seems to glow.
Greg looks nervous and awkward and he rubs the back of his neck as he gives Molly this big grin and then I remember what I had asked John to do.
“I mean”, Sherlock says. Somehow he seems to have regained his courage. It's what the knowledge that he is not about to lose John does to him, “I like you too.....in that way....have for a while now.”
This was his second week of studying with Sherlock, but he found he couldn't really  concentrate on his work today.
Sherlock was silent for a couple of seconds, opened his mouth as if he was going to say something, closed it again and eventually settled on: 'you're just going to have to trust me on this one.'
“Go back to sleep”, Sherlock says. His voice hushed and hoarse in the dark but it seems to do the trick as John's eyelashes flutter a couple of times, close again and his breath evens out to the steady rhythm of before.
“So....how are you?”, he says and before Sherlock even has a chance to reply he adds: “and don't say you're fine, I can see that you're not.”
Familiar flowers in and of themselves, but they looked quite out of place amidst the variety of wildflowers that grew there.
Their carriage careens off of an iced over bridge in the early hours of the morning and it takes another day before their frozen bodies are dredged up from the river underneath.
“It's all fine”, he says again, “whatever you want to do. We can just talk....or sit here....or......it's all fine.”
“Sure...”, John says. He suddenly feels uneasy but he's not sure why. This is Mary. He knows Mary. Her remarks probably mean nothing. The strange expression that had flitted across her features briefly before she had schooled them again just a trick of the light.
Holmes looks so helpless.....hopeless maybe.....and John does understand, he does, but he also understands that there is only one possible way for this all to end and that it is out of their control.
Once again Sherlock silently wishes for things to be simple. To live in a world where it would be acceptable to now stretch out his hand and use it to turn Watson's face towards his own and make him see how exceptionally easy things can be once you change the way you look at things.
“We should probably call it a night”, he says. As nonchalantly as he can manage. If Finn had still been here he would not have been fooled. Luckily, Watson is not Finn.
'Oh, just delightful', he'd said with mock enthusiasm, 'two weeks forced to spend quality time with my family. It'll be heaven I'm sure.'
The last time I had seen him I had left him standing on a beach with an empty promise that I would see him again the next day.
For Sherlock Holmes magic has made up a vast part of his life. Over the years he has gotten desensitized to being able to conjure up flames at will, making yourself disappear or forming objects out of thin air.
'Thank you', he blurted out without thinking, 'sir', he quickly added when Holmes raised a haughty eyebrow at him. 'But I fear you are not the only one who might have been in the wrong that night, Sir.'
He had spent many cold and hungry nights where he hadn't been able to find a warm place to sleep wondering how painful death by hanging truly was.
The smile Holmes gives him then is slightly more honest but there is still a hint of sadness that clings to the corners of his mouth.
John places his elbows behind himself on the bed now as he lifts his upper body, leaning back. He's looking down at Sherlock who is still lying down. Sherlock's fingers are no longer nervously twisting the blankets. Instead he finds he is grasping onto them with clenched fists. Anchoring himself. John hovers over him and his throat goes dry and he finds he has a hard time swallowing.
What he had not told him and had not been willing to tell him was where these creatures came from, where Sherlock had to travel too from time to time and what he was looking for in those lands. That information was too dangerous.
