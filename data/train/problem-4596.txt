"Oh." Castiel says slowly. He stares at Dean for a moment, thoughtful. “Though I don’t have much to compare it to, I believe you dance quite well. You looked like you were having fun.”
“Did you just-”
Balthazar arrives an hour later, just barely in time to help Castiel with the now steadily increasing amount of people wandering into the coffee shop.
Shoving the thought aside, he lifts his own hands up from where they’d been useless gripping Cas’ shoulders to grip at the back of his head and neck. The small part of Dean’s brain that’s still online manages to acknowledge that Cas’ hair is just as soft as he’d imagined.
He shakes his shoulders in accord, huffing a soft laugh to himself.
Cas squints at him.
until Dean went and shoved his entire damn leg in his mouth.
Dean grimaces, shaking his head stiffly.
Dean freezes up, still staring at the feather, his hand only an inch or two away from making contact with it. “Uh…”
“Well, as fun as this has been,” she says dryly, “I have better things to do than have semi-witty diatribe with you, whatever you are. I’m assuming you know where the door is, considering you broke into my house.”
“What do I look like to you, a dance teacher?” Dean asks, half-laughing. It’s not what he was expecting Cas to ask if he ever decided to take him up on his offer; he’d been thinking more along the lines of introducing him to good music and movies and shit. Unexpected turn of events aside, it kinda sounds like fun. Besides, how many people can claim to have taught an angel – former, but that’s just semantics – to dance?
“About as cranky as he’s been the last few days, but asleep for now,” Kevin says, setting his bottle down with a quiet thud. “How’s the research going?”
“I’m surprised you’re out of bed. It’s not even eight in the morning yet,” Dean says, taking a seat next to him and handing him a mug.
Anyways.
Stone-Cold Fox frowns. Rick winces internally, because the guy’s definitely gonna ask for the manager now, and he’s gonna get screwed over for flirt-harassing a customer.
“It doesn’t look very good,” Cas says eventually. Dean frowns at him before looking down. Cas was right. “Well, we just need to put stuff on top to make it pretty. Like a cake.”
“I don’t know how to explain it, let alone in a way that you’ll believe, but I understood all the implications of my choice when I made it.” Like he feels the need to clarify, Cas adds, “It wasn’t under duress or desperation.”
He kicks aside a pebble on the path, grasping for something else to talk about. “What do you think of Lebanon?”
“Listen, Kev, we have a situation. It’s…” He trails off, glancing back at the kids through the rearview mirror. “It’s not good. Call me back as soon as you get this.”
“I could’ve managed them just fine on my own,” Sam says as he walks into the kitchen.
“I’ve been making my own records as we go, figuring I’d fill it in from whatever indexes or stuff we manage to find.” Sam shrugs. “Thought I’d switch gears today and try having the information first instead, seeing as most of the stuff we’ve found hasn’t even been mentioned.”
Dean shakes his head in a
Even though Dean tries to go easy on him, Cas inevitably loses the second practice match as well, scowling at the pool table like it’s at fault somehow as he drains the dregs of his beer. Dean decides it’s only fair as a gracious winner to ease the sting a bit by buying him another drink.
He looks up warily.
Cas shrugs.
“It’s a friggin’ box mix,” Dean says defensively. Sam takes another sip of his coffee, glancing at the countertop pointedly over the rim of his cup. Sure that was the only thing he’d managed to make while Sam was busy deep-diving into the records, but it clearly wasn’t the
Gathering up the dirty dishes, Dean heads back to the kitchen to start washing up. His mind wanders as he works, idly considering the logistics of setting up a rec room in one of the myriad of unused rooms they have available to them. The kitchen’s Dean’s favorite place in the bunker so far, for obvious reasons, but it’s not really a place to kick back and relax. This place was their home now, and it’s sizable enough that they can afford to have a living room
“On the queen’s honor,” Crowley replies.
“I am not adorable,” he tells Sam sternly, as if Sam might be mentally agreeing with Dean’s ‘joke’. Sam is perfectly aware that his best friend’s a former badass angel of the Lord, and is still reasonably a badass even if he’s no longer got angel mojo powering him. Sam is also honest with himself enough to acknowledge that said best friend
“And you wanna get into that
Dean waves his hand in the direction of the fridge as he scrounges around for the paper towels he’d stowed away. “We’ve got plenty of leftovers. Go nuts.”
Sam eyes it enviously. God, that’d warm him right up.
“Cas caught on to the fact that you’re avoiding him like he has the Black Plague,” Sam says, stepping down into the kitchen. He stops a few feet short of the ingredient-laden island and crosses his arms.
“I don’t mind,” Cas says with the tiniest hint of a smile curling at the corner of his mouth. “I believe it would be hypocritical of me when your brother often tells me I stare too much. But if you want to ask me something, just ask.”
“Nope.”
A gust of wind immediately buffets them when they open the bunker door, splashing them in rainwater.
“Wait,” Dean calls out. Sam pauses halfway up the kitchen steps, not turning around. “What about Crowley?”
He hesitates for a moment, straining to hear any signs of life from inside the room. It’s unlikely he’s gonna interrupt anything, so he gives a quick rap on the door before walking in.
Belatedly, Rick remembers that he was asked a question. Still stuck on the guy’s insane blue eyes, his mouth decides to go ahead and answer before his brain’s formulated an actual response. “Other than those ridiculously blue eyes-” He freezes, then stutters, “uh- I mean, no. No, sir.”
“Witch hunt went sideways,” Sam replies, running a hand through his already messy hair and making it messier. He sighs. “I got rid of the spellbook and hex bags but it did jack about this.”
“You’re not stupid,” Cas says with finality, briefly tightening his grip on Dean’s wrist. Somehow, he hadn’t noticed that Cas had kept holding onto it this entire time, and now that he’s aware of it all he can think of is how nice it feels to have the warm band of his fingers wrapped around his wrist.
Dean starts scanning the crowd for Sam and Eileen as he hurries over to Jack. Amara said that she’d fixed Jack, and they’d believed her, so what was wrong now?
Cas hesitates for a moment before nodding.
Dean shrugs, plastering on a smirk. “Can’t blame me for trying.”
Rick curiously starts looking for Gravel-Voice guy again, crowing internally when he finds him standing in the aisle that’s got the giant mirror in the back angled just right for Rick to be able to see him better. He’s half cut off by the angle of the shelves, but he can still see the guy’s face just fine.
“We’ve been at this for almost a month now and we haven’t managed to find a damn thing.”
With that, they split up.
“Hey,” Sam says gently, trying to coax Cas into looking up. “What brought this on?”
She shrugs. “I don’t particularly care what a random thug who breaks into my house thinks. Now, if it wasn’t clear, this little break-in visit is officially over.”
He’s barely wandered off before Sam returns. Catching sight of Dean’s poleaxed expression, he glances between him and Cas. “What’d I miss?”
“I’d suggest the ocean,” Charlie quips. “How well can you swim?”
“It’s not just about you. I’ve got shit I don’t want to air out like this, and if you care about our friendship at all, you won’t push it,” Dean says through tightly clenched teeth before Castiel can apologize. The tightness in his face relaxes slightly, likely from the compulsion accepting his answer.
“Sa-” Dean starts, sneezing again, less violently than before. He sniffles wetly, rubbing at his throat. “Hurts.”
“Listen, Sammy and I were talking earlier. We’re thinking of going out for drinks later tonight now that everything’s about as okay as it can get. Celebrate, y’know?”
Sam raises a hand in acknowledgment, reluctantly pushing the book aside as he boots up his laptop.
He coughs a little, clearing his throat. “Just made me try her drinks a couple times to teach me not to try and say shit about them. They were, uh,” Dean grimaces again, “strong, I guess.”
Two months later, and Dean's ire was finally starting to thaw. In a bid to maintain the fragile peace, and still actively avoid each other, Sam had left to run errands while Dean was busy tinkering around in the garage, leaving Castiel to putter around with nothing to do and only himself and his imagination for entertainment.
“After everything we’ve faced over the past few years, I don’t think that’s possible.”
“I fell asleep,” Cas mutters as Dean returns with a full plate for Cas and another beer for himself.
Sam’s expression turns skeptical. He stares at Dean for a long moment, then sighs. “Alright, I’ll bite: what is it?”
the king of Hell,” he replies dryly. “I used to be a witch during my first stint at humanity, and I’m the son of a witch besides.”
Kevin looks up from his book, brows furrowed. “Sam?”
Unfortunately for him, there’s a slightly more pressing matter he needs to attend to first. He shoves his hands into his pockets for what little warmth the effort offers, and asks, “The kids?”
“I’m not here for food.”
“Hell no, Sam can’t dance for shit.”
“You asshole,” Dean says wetly, only then realizing the tears dripping from his eyes and making damp patches on the trenchcoat. Cas’ arms come up and hold him back, gentle and warm.
Dean’s out of his seat and halfway across the bar before he even realizes it.
Sam sighs and tries to reroute the conversation back to the matter at hand. Dean doesn’t need to be a part of this conversation when he’s not even here to lend a hand. “You start searching from where you’ve been clearing up, and I’ll keep working on this side.”
Cas shrugs but says nothing more.
This time it wasn't so much of a good idea as it was a bad one.
“What about him?” Sam asks, before understanding dawns. Dean notices the change in his expression, brows raised excitedly.
After tucking Dean in and making sure he drank some water, Sam heads to the kitchen to see if he can make some soup for Dean to drink. He just hopes he remembers how to make it correctly.
It takes a
They walk in peaceable silence for a few more minutes, before Cas suddenly asks, “How are you supposed to react if someone flirts with you?”
Sam glares down at him, ready to snarl some angry retort but Kevin raises a hand to cut him off. “Being cooped up in here is getting to all of us. But he’s just a kid, Sam.”
He doesn’t look like he believes his own words.
Sam sighs again. “I’m fine.”
“So, how’s the burger? Good, right?” Dean asks expectantly.
Sam slants a look at Dean. He’s got some idea of what Dean’s trying to avoid; unsurprisingly, getting him to talk about his feelings is like pulling teeth. This being the equivalent of him trying to dodge a trip to the dentist.
Before Sam can loudly interrupt, they break apart, a little breathless and apparently not noticing him, which, hey, he’s grateful for. Of course that gratitude is short-lived when Sam registers the heated looks they’re giving each other and, ew, no, Sam did not want to see his brother’s hungry sex-face, he’s seen it enough, thank you. He decides to count his blessings that he didn’t walk in a few minutes later, not willing to linger on the thought of the level of mental scarring he’d have ended up walking in on then.
“Surprise?” Sam says innocently. Dean pins him with a look as he dumps the groceries onto the nearest table. He turns to Sam, arms crossed. “Wanna tell me what’s going on, Sammy?”
“Sure,” Dean replies easily, climbing up onto the chair next to hers.
Too slow to react, the scythe grazes Dean’s side just as the angel blade hits its target, his yell of pain louder than the Empty’s muffled grunt. Cas is there to catch him as he staggers back, dragging him hurriedly out of the library.
Cas’ squint changes marginally, like he’s wondering why Sam was giving such things merit and was debating actually asking. Before he can sideline a discussion he doesn’t really have answers for, Dean wanders up to them with a loud, “Alright, nerds, time for a break.”
“Look, if it’s about your friggin
Dean’s face turns an almost alarming shade of red impressively quick at that even as he pries one hand off of Cas to flip Sam the bird. Cas drops his head onto Dean’s shoulder, his own pink tint up to his ears now.
about trying to pull that shit again or I’ll kill you myself.”
He rolls his eyes to himself as he says it because this is apparently their life now. The longer he has to actually keep saying shit like this, the more it feels like they’re in a twisted parody of a normal life, one with a dog and the chores related to it. Except here the dog’s a prissy, human-shaped bastard freeloading with them until they can find a way to unload themselves of the responsibility.
“But-” Sam starts to protest, before giving up. “Fine.”
He stares down at the box as he speaks, softly as if more to himself. “I’ve become weaker since our escape from Purgatory. I thought I could still be useful, somehow, but I’m more of a burden than anything else.” His lips press together in a thin line. “I can’t even protect you from a mere witch’s spell.”
Unsurprisingly, considering the circumstances and the object in question, Sam doesn’t find anything on Ma’at-related potentially magically-imbued artifacts, let alone anything on how to undo said magic. Burning the feather is their last-ditch option, but he’s a little hesitant to attempt it, remembering Crowley’s throwaway comment about the risk of magical blowback. He’s honestly a little surprised Dean hasn’t pushed for it already; maybe Crowley’s words stuck with him as well.
Sam raises his hands up to cut him off. “Okay, okay I get it. Just stop.”
“Swallow before you talk, unless you wanna choke,” Kevin replies, not looking back. Dean stares at the back of his head wide-eyed for a second before swallowing and mumbling a quiet ‘sorry’.
Abruptly he wonders if there’s a  small possibility he’s grossly underestimating his capability to survive mostly on energy drinks and snack foods until someone remembers to feed him. Maybe it’s a new prophet ability.
“Well?” Dean asks impatiently.
Cas gives him a confused, curious look.
And then he’s gone.
Dean’s scowl doesn’t abate. “Great. That’s
Still keeping his flask hidden, he reaches out his free hand to pat Castiel’s shoulder awkwardly. “Good luck with figuring out… whatever you’re trying to figure out.”
The woman's expression goes from scared to irritated so fast that it almost gives Dean whiplash.  "Ugh, fine. So you found me. What gave me away?"
“Look, that’s not- I didn’t mean it like that. I just-” Sam flounders. “Dean has reasons for it, mostly stupid, but I get them. I really wish I could explain-”
Dean gets really excited when they wake up one day and there isn’t any rain at all because it meant they could
They weren’t-
He dumps the bags by the map table, figuring he’d put them away later, and heads down to the kitchen. The kids were already seated at the table, watching Kevin whip up a plate of sandwiches. Sam hesitates in the doorway, watching them.
“Oh man, that’s terrible,” Garth says sincerely, voice crackling over the phone. “Spells aren't really my strong suit, but tell ya what – I’ll put some feelers out, ask around and see if there’s someone who can help you. Call me if you think there’s anything I can help with.”
Dean, noticing the look, scowls. “Shut up.”
“You done sulking?” Dean asks.
“Yeah?” Dean grins, open and easy in a way he hasn’t for months.
Dean’s halfway through making breakfast when he hears quiet footsteps headed towards the kitchen. Sam’s not exactly the quietest guy around, so the most likely option was Cas (much as he and mornings still don't get along) or Kevin (extremely unlikely considering his marathon sulking).
“I admit, I’m still not sure what a ‘sugar daddy’ is,” Cas says, raising his fingers up for the air quotes again. Dean’s still got no clue where he picked up that habit. It makes him look like a dork, but it’s also kinda cute, in a stupid way. He’ll bite his tongue off before admitting to it though.
For a guy who’s happily survived on frozen food and takeout and had no qualms about the people around him doing the same (Kevin’s own diet had suffered as much as other college-aged kids’ would, minus the college part), this sudden explosion of cooking is weird, to put it mildly.
because you have someone you want to interrogate with uncharacteristic subtlety.”
“Sammy, stop! I’m clean! No mo’ water!”
“Three days, going on four now. And uh, it’s a little broader than just Dean.”
“If you don’t mind, I’ll take a break for a little while.”
Dean reaches out, tentatively squeezing at Cas’ arm. He relaxes a little when it isn’t shaken off. “You’re my best friend, Cas, and having you here and alive is something I’m not gonna be sorry for. So you might be a screw-up. But hey, guess what? We’re all screw-ups here.”
“Tell me what?” Dean demands loudly, glancing between the Empty and Cas. Cas doesn’t look at him. “Tell me what, Cas?”
He draws his gun and aims, hands moving quickly through familiar motions. He pulls the trigger just as she sends the gun flying with a flick of her wrist. His shot goes wild and hits the radio.
“Sam,” Castiel says quietly.
“Dean,” Castiel says quietly, standing in the kitchen entryway.
The memories of those ‘trial runs’ churn Castiel’s stomach unpleasantly, the faces of those dead puppets superimposing over the present Dean’s face far too easily, making Castiel look away. “She made facsimiles of you and had me… practice, until she was sure I could kill you without hesitation.”
Sam hesitates for a moment, eyes flitting from the stuffed toy to Cas. “Do you want it, Cas?”
Kevin notices, frowning up at Sam. “You didn’t feed them?”
Their first stop is at the Children’s Museum of Central Nebraska in Hastings. Before they’d set out, Sam had taken it upon himself to do a little research into fun places he could take the kids and ended up finding the children’s museum online. He’s pleased with his decision when he sees the glee on the kids’ faces when he sets them loose in the builder’s zone.
in that look now that Dean knows what to look for. He’s not sure how he’s missed it all this time.
for once.”
“Touchy much?”
Kevin raises the plastic bag he was holding and shakes it, cans clunking against each other as he does. “I told you I was going for a walk.”
“Blame Sam,” Dean says, side-eyeing Sam who grins at him when he notices the look.
After stowing everything into the car, it doesn’t take them long to get back on the road. They make a quick detour to the motel so that Sam can grab their stuff before they’re back on the highway.
Sam smothers a laugh, tilting his head back with a smirk. “He didn’t mean it literally, Cas. He was trying to tell you he’s really into you.”
Which is why, a little over a week into their new status quo, Sam’s surprised to find himself waking up bright and early, feeling reasonably well-rested. A glance at his phone tells him it’s just past six in the morning. He closes his eyes for a moment, appreciating the morning silence. It takes him a few minutes before he realizes that it’s early enough for him to go for a jog, something he hasn’t been able to do since his brother and best friend got turned into pint-sized preschoolers.
“A leather jacket,” Cas says, lifting it up.
“Any of those ring a bell?”
“I swear Sammy, I’m not kidding. Something’s been off the last few days. You know I don’t say half the shit that goes through my head but it’s like I can’t help myself lately.”
"Sammy, why you so old?"
“You think I’ve forgotten that?” Sam growls, sidestepping around him.
him, he’s certain.
“Yeah, no. Kevin, that’s Cas and Dean.”
“Didn’t expect to find you here,” Sam offers carefully, setting the artifact boxes down. He drags a nearby stool closer, taking a seat across from Dean.
“I think I-”
Sam stretches his arms out wide and behind him, groaning in satisfaction.
Except.
Crowley hums, unbothered. “The mirror definitely has some strong magical residue.”
“Baking is one of my many talents, among
Dean takes a quick glance at his watch. “Half an hour. Enough time for you to wash up, and uh, maybe consider a shave, Kev.”
Sam rolls his eyes and gives Cas a
“Dean!” Sam’s voice interrupts Cas, echoing through the hall to them, with the heavy sound of his footsteps following right after. They both jump back to the opposite ends of the bed guiltily.
“He’s not my boyfriend.”
“I wouldn’t blame you if you were mad, y’know,” Sam says, leaning against the door and watching Cas’ back. He watches Cas’ shoulders rise and fall as he takes a measured breath. “Pretty sure Dean and I deserve it.”
"Cas, listen, I think I’ve got an idea where to look, but I need you to go find Kevin and stay with him, okay?"
Kevin’s not sure what he’d expected to find in the kitchen the following morning, but it certainly wasn’t this.
gesture and just waves in the direction of the fridge again. The entire kitchen could probably use a proper cleanup, but a bunch of wet towels would do for now.
“Very well, this weekend then.” Cas says, making it sound like a question and a statement at the same time. When Dean nods at that, he smiles widely. “It’s a… what’s the phrase? It’s a date.”
He falters, bumping into a chair as he feels the blood rush up to color his cheeks. He’s not sure why, but he feels embarrassed at being caught.
“Alright.”
“I don’t care if you can heal me or not, Cas, you’re not here to play holy nursemaid, or, y’know, normal nursemaid.” He takes a sip of his coffee, sighing. “It’s… our lives kinda suck, if I’m being honest. We get played crappy hands, and we always end up losing people we care about along the way. Hell, you’ve had a front-row seat to see it happen to us.”
“I can’t change the past. I-” He hesitates for a moment, swallowing before he continues, “I would take away your memories of that time if I could, but I won’t throw away what you gave to me as a child, meaningless as it is to you.”
Right. He needed to get rid of the body.
Dean takes a small sip before he starts to gag.
Either this is Dean’s attempt at an apology (to which of them Sam’s not sure) for how he’s been behaving or he’s been replaced with a Stepford clone while they weren’t looking. He’s not sure which he’d prefer.
“I was wondering why Dean wasn’t assisting today either. You said something about him still being busy.”
Sam frowns.
“Yeah. Here goes nothing.”
Cas nods slowly, still looking confused. Apparently he’s not being clear enough.
“What, Sam?” Cas asks, eyes still on their path.
Dean rolls his eyes. He’s heard that line too many times to count already.
“No, and I’m not interested in going clubbing with you tonight,” Castiel replies, eyeing the clock on the wall. It’s almost noon and Dean isn't due to come in for another hour at least.
in front of him.
“You okay?”
Dean groans even as his ears heat up. “Man, I've told you before that you can’t use that word to describe other guys, or me for that matter.”
“Got it.” He stares at Sam for a few seconds, then says decisively, “I’m gonna go raid the kitchen now.”
“BATMAN!” Dean proclaims, holding the shirt up with a flourish.
Sam slows his pace a bit as the bunker comes back into sight, feeling better than he has in a few days. With a glance at his watch, he speeds up. Everyone else would be waking up soon.
Castiel’s frown deepens. “What do you mean, dealing with things?”
“Ugh, fine,” Dean says, gripping onto the bag tighter. He heads down the hallway, calling out behind him as he goes. “You really need to stop with the puppy eyes, Sammy! You’re not five anymore!”
And we've reached the end! Hope you enjoyed the ride ;D
“Elvis Presley?” Dean says, quirking a brow. “King of Rock and Roll?”
Sam finishes off the last of the coffee, depositing his mug in the sink. “Good to know researching a solution for your own dilemma isn’t worth your time then.”
It takes a few moments for Kevin to respond. “Not the worst idea ever. You realize I’m still technically underage, right?”
Rick thinks to himself as his heart slows back down,
He tosses the phone onto the passenger seat with a sigh.
Sam drags the book closer, brows furrowing as he tries to make sense of the text. After a few unsuccessful minutes of trying to make heads or tails of the script and only managing to make sense of the occasional word, he turns the page to read the ingredient list, muttering under his breath as he tries to read it.
Dean shrugs.
to sleep before, so they’d never gotten around to setting up a room for him. Far as Sam knew, Cas normally staked himself out at a corner of the library in a large chair he’d claimed as his own. If he wanted to be alone, he’d hole himself up in the half-made lounge room Dean had been trying to set up. All it had at the moment was a couch and a low coffee table Dean had managed to scrounge up from somewhere, which was just fine for sort-of-angel Cas, but definitely not for little (apparently human) kid Cas who’s knuckling at his eyes sleepily as he trailed down the hall after them.
“No problem, fellas,” she says, offering them a smile before heading off to serve another customer.
None of the other rooms in the bunker were even remotely ready for anyone to sleep in, seeing as they were still covered in half a century of dust. Fortunately for them, the kids seemed to have no qualms about sleeping in the same bed.
Before Sam can retort with something about how that’s clearly not the case, Kevin interrupts him. “Well,
He’s cut off as Dean drags him into a hug, face pressed tightly into his shoulder, inhaling his familiar scent.
“I won’t make any promises,” he tells Dean. “And besides, Crowley said it should probably wear off on its own, right? So, wait it out. It’s already been, what, three days?”
“Honest? You don’t wan’ me gone?” Dean asks doubtfully, sniffling.
“It came into my possession a few centuries ago,” Crowley replies, not offering any more details.
"So what's stopping you? Cuz if it's
“This guy bothering you, Cas?” he asks, almost on top of Cas with how close he’s standing. Cas doesn’t seem particularly surprised by Dean’s sudden appearance, only briefly glancing at Dean.
“You tried to. That still matters,” Sam replies. He frowns as he runs that through his head again before looking at Cas a little more intently. “That’s what you were trying to do back then, wasn’t it? Get him out of the way?”
wrong about this, maybe Cas was gonna reject him.
“Sure,” Dean says, relaxing with a chuckle. “And don’t act dumb, I know you know what I meant.”
It doesn’t take long for the alcohol to hit Cas, and their next round of pool is punctuated by his increasingly erratic shots. He glances from his half-empty glass to Dean’s fourth round of beer like he’s got a theory that doesn’t quite make sense yet.
“Hey, no.” Sam squats down, stopping Cas before he can slip out of bed. “Who’s Buzzy?”
, sending up a small cloud of dust motes flying.
“No, I uh, got a bit angry at him when he asked me to play. I might have upset him a bit, so I want to apologize.”
“Merry Christmas, Cas,” Dean says, loud enough that only Cas hears it. Cas’ smile at that is smaller but no less happy, the crinkles around his eyes deepening as he stares at Dean.
sucks.
Castiel’s brows furrow, feeling confused and irritated now. Dean
An uncomfortable silence descends upon the kitchen, Dean’s last statement hanging in the air. Castiel’s shoulders slump.
“Your standards for his behavior are rather different from mine, I reckon,” he says instead of elaborating. His mind quickly runs through what he gleaned from the brothers in their previous conversations; if he’s right, Castiel is utterly unaware of being under the spell the others are so keen to avoid. The more pertinent question here is: can he gain anything from enlightening the fallen angel of his current predicament?
“Again,” Sam agrees, staring at his bottle. He doesn’t look up as he continues, “I’m worried, Kev.”
“I, uh-” Cas stutters, suddenly nervous. He looks down, scratching at some pie filling that dried up on his wrist.
making breakfast can be,” Kevin says a little sarcastically halfway through breakfast, “it’s your turn tomorrow.”
He rubs a hand over his jaw, giving Cas a sad lopsided smile. “You kept coming back to us though. Kept fighting for us, kept watching our backs.” He pauses. “We never really thanked you for that.”
Sam gives him a flat look.
Cas looks down at the melted remains of his ice-cream. A small smile curls at the edge of his mouth.
Apparently the reason he isn’t walking into a shouting match, or a silent glaring match, is because they’ve been better occupied aggressively making out against the kitchen counter. The two of them are going at it like there’s no air in the room except what they can find in each other’s mouths which, ugh. He’s obviously happy for Dean, but he didn’t need to ever see his brother aggressively playing tonsil hockey with his best friend.
“He’s in the kitchen,” Kevin says immediately. Cas swiftly side-steps around him and heads down the hall, reluctantly stopping when Kevin calls after him. “He seems like he’s in a mood. Probably doesn’t want any company right now, Cas.”
Dean reads between the lines of that statement, expression shading into an apology.
Sam sighs, looking away. “I’m tired, that’s all. It’s been a long day.”
there was a mostly sober source who could help clear things up.
Dean peeks his head out from under the covers at the sound of his door opening,  blinking sleepily at Sam as he enters the room.
Sam stares at him thoughtfully. Maybe working alone in silence was starting to get to the guy, for all he knew. Not that Cas has ever been chatty for as long as Sam’s known him, but he can get how Dean’s constant commentary can become soothing background noise. If Dean’s side of things is anything to go by, then Cas must’ve been dealing with his cold shoulder for a while now.
Sam smiles and says, “Wear gloves.”
Sam perks up.
“What’re you gonna do if I don’t?” She scoffs. He’s halfway into the kitchen now, but she doesn’t seem to notice or care. “Arrest me? I’m pretty sure you’re not a cop.”
He decides to temporarily forgive Sam when he brings out the pie after dinner.
He fiddles with the kitchen radio until he finds a classic rock station and turns the volume up high, letting Zeppelin’s tunes wash over him as he cooks.
Sam sighs, relaxing slightly. “Same difference it turns out.”
“Yeah well, I haven’t changed that much over the years, so you can quit tryin’ to refresh your memory. ‘Sides, I’m not much to look at,” Dean mutters, losing the battle of maintaining eye contact with Cas.
“No?” Sam repeats, confused. “What, you’ve got a better idea or something?”
“You’d make a promising line cook in a diner yet,” he tells Dean as he makes his way into the kitchen.
Dean turns around with a curse, banging his elbow on the counter in the process. He swears, cradling his elbow. “Doesn’t anyone around here know how to enter a fucking room politely?”
"I know you want to, Cas, but it's pouring like crazy outside. I don't want you getting sick, especially if I’m wrong."
Trying to rein himself back in, he moves to stare at himself in the dinky little mirror in the hopes he’ll find some answers there. His reflection, unsurprisingly, looks about as bewildered and confused as he feels.
Dean obeys immediately, even as ‘Billie’ croons, “Oh, don’t worry angel, you know I’m not here for him.”
The lady smiles at Castiel. “Congratulations, I hope you guys have a good date.”
“Uh-huh,” Dean says, pointedly side-eyeing the still-steaming mug beside Cas’ elbow. Cas seems to be either blind to it or purposely ignoring his look. “This coming from the guy who needs three cups of it to wake up in the morning. Hi there, Pot, I’m Kettle.”
Crowley hums thoughtfully. “There’s a number of spells or incantations to choose from, depending on efficiency or the intention of suffering for the truth-teller.”
It does the trick before Sam has to decide if he needs to intervene or let Dean pick out his own toy to be mollified (something he’d enjoy teasing him for when things are back to normal, but right now he just wants this shopping trip to be
When Dean just nods and doesn’t say anything else, Charlie claps her hands together and says, “So, you looking forward to going back to normal?”
He glances over his shoulder.
Sam smirks. “Think I’ll leave it to Cas and Crowley. They can decide between them who gets to be club president of the ‘Dean Winchester Fanclub’.”
“I’ve wronged you in many ways over the years we’ve known each other. Almost as many as the times I’ve ‘screwed up’ while trying to fix my mistakes,” Cas continues, looking weary and resigned with what he’s admitting. “Saying I’m sorry will never be enough. I know I don’t deserve to be free of the weight of my wrongdoings. But, to forget it all for a while was… peaceful. The spell was as much a curse to you, as it was a gift to me.”
“There,” Dean grunts when he notices the door to one of the storage rooms lying ajar. Cas redirects immediately. When he turns to Dean, concerned and hand stretched out to heal him, he grits his teeth and shakes his head, taking a half-step back to lean against the wall. “Block the door.”
“So… Taylor Swift, huh?” Dean asks with an amused smile. Castiel cocks his head, confused. It’s cat-like and adorable, and not something Dean intends to admit to a single soul.
“Nice sweater,” He tells Charlie as he takes a seat in the empty chair on Cas’ right. She preens at the compliment.
He snorts to himself at the thought.
“Found a shirt fo’ you too!” Dean says proudly, as Sam holds up the shirt and sees a silhouette of a T-Rex with the words ‘Samosaurus’ printed next to it. Sam lets out a quiet snort.
“Cas,” Dean says softly, finally finding his voice. He’s honestly not sure what to say after that.
“I know buddy, I know. Let’s get you back to bed.” Sam hoists him up and carries him back to his room.
“C’mon!” Dean says, grabbing onto Sam’s hand, trying and failing to drag Sam behind him.
“Yes, Sam.”
Admittedly, it’s not so much an ultimatum as it is an inevitability. He might’ve lost the possibility of pretending he lives in a normal world and any hopes of going back to the life he had before all this, but the one he’s in now was never going to be one he’d put down roots in.
“Yeah,” Sam replies hoarsely, hugging him tightly. “Love you too, Dean.”
“That’s not Billie,” Cas interrupts, standing up abruptly and dropping into a defensive stance as his angel blade drops into his hand. “Dean get back.”
get some takeout.” He nods to a couple of bags he’d set aside away from the groceries.
“I don’t understand why humans prefer interactions in a roundabout manner as opposed to saying things directly. It’s harder to gauge their intentions this way.”
“It’s no chocolate milkshake, I’ll give you that,” Kevin agrees, having gotten a good whiff of the gag-worthy potion while mixing it up. “Look, just pinch your nose and gulp it down real fast. That way you’ll barely taste anything.”
Dean glares at the radio.
“You had a little pie filling-” he says, thumb moving up to rub at Cas’ lower lip “-right there.”
He moves to make the drink before Castiel has a chance to harass him to get back to work. Castiel stays at the counter and quickly rings up Sam’s order, hoping to avoid giving Gabriel any more opportunities to advance his flirtations into outright propositioning him.
He stares at Dean for a long moment, then Sam, glancing briefly at Cas who’s watching them curiously over a large glass of milk, before fixing his gaze back on Sam again. He quirks a brow. “Seriously?”
Once inside, he makes a beeline for the shopping carts and deposits Dean in the kid seat. After making sure that he’s properly seated, they make their way over to the kids' clothes section. There was no telling how long the two of them were gonna be stuck like this so he figures it’s best to get them a few changes of clothes at least. His eyes wander down to Cas who’s walking next to him, clutching onto his pant leg and staring at everything curiously. His eyes go lower and,
Cas should’ve normally wandered by long before Sam managed to drag himself away from his books, making borderline petulant inquiries about dinner while Dean’s still cooking as he got hungrier and hungrier.
to get them out of the house without looking like he’s some kind of creepy kidnapper or child molester.
Dean chokes, coughing as he tries to dislodge the food that went down the wrong pipe. He thumps a fist against his chest a couple of times, eyes watering.
Sam’s in the middle of flipping through the pages of a journal when Castiel wanders up to him, setting down the box of case files he’d found.
“It was the only thing in the pantry other than pop tarts, and uh,” Sam rubs at the back of his neck, “I can’t really cook.”
Sam rolls his eyes, and sarcastically says, “You’re a lifesaver, Kev.”
The spread they walk in on for dinner isn’t entirely surprising at this point for Sam. Still, he sends a slightly incredulous glance at Dean who makes a good effort of steadfastly not looking at either of them. He’d been expecting a good ol’ fashioned brotherly throttling for the gif he sent earlier, not this. It probably isn’t going to happen while Cas is around, which is a surprisingly good motivator to make sure he’s around him more.
Sam snorts. “I wish. You think Dean would’ve taken a break from cursing up a storm after getting turned into a four-year-old if he knew it was something to be pissed about?”
He’d gone and made a fool of himself in front of an older, hot dude without even getting a chance to salvage some of his dignity. Even worse that he ended up having an audience for it. Sure, the dude somehow didn’t clue onto the fact that he’d been failing at low-key flirting with him when he’d been doing it, but still, it was the principle of the thing. If Grumpy Male Model dude had waited just a couple more minutes…
“I’m 35, asshole,” she grits out.
“I’ve been getting that feeling too. I thought I was coming down with something.”
It takes him a few moments of bemoaning his luck to realize that there weren’t any other cars outside. So, either Gravel-Voice guy decided to take a leisurely walk up to the station to buy things instead of going to the corner store down the street,
“Somethin’ funny, Sammy?”
“Don’t worry,” Charlie says, patting him on the shoulder, “this is strictly in-house.”
a gun, you need to know how to handle it. It’s different from tossing your angel blade around.”
He rolls over with a grunt, groping for his phone where it’s busy beeping noisily on the bedside table. Blinking sleepily, he thumbs off the alarm. He squints against the glare of his phone screen, trying to figure out what the time was, scowling when he realizes it was just past seven in the morning. This was what happened when he kept trying to remind himself to turn off his alarm after a hunt or a late-night research session and never actually did it.
Dean snorts. "Try running it by Sam."
Crowley doesn’t respond at first, raising a brow instead. The Winchesters have yet to learn the obvious implications of his silence, but it’s at least amusing to watch the elder Winchester get riled up in the process. Sam, sadly, is largely unflustered by Crowley.
“Just a couple more minutes?” Sam asks, adding a note of plaintiveness to his voice. He’ll cave and go back if Cas insists, but it’s surprisingly nice just having a walk and talking.
“Something’s wrong, Sammy.”
“Of course not,” Cas says, moving the worm up to prop it on his upper lip. “I’m gonna wear it as a wormstache.”
“We’re supposed to be teaching him some semblance of a routine, Sammy. Y’know, all that adult human stuff you’d champion at the drop of a hat.”
Dean drags himself to the kitchen, unsurprisingly empty at, he squints against the light of his phone to check the time, a little after seven. Not really in the mood to eat much, he manages to force down some toast, washing it down with scalding hot coffee.
“I’m not asking to convince you not to. It’s-” Sam sighs. “Maybe this is long overdue. He might freak out and get mad but- I need you to understand that whatever stupid shit he says, he doesn’t want you gone. Neither do I, if that matters any.”
he thinks wildly,
“Merry Christmas, Kev,” She says, handing him a small flat package and watches as he rips apart the wrapping.
There’s the beginning of a lecture at the tip of Dean’s tongue about screwing up whatever passes for a sleep schedule with Cas by taking late naps or too long ones, one he’s already given twice now, but he bites it back as he surreptitiously takes the empty seat between his and Sam’s and gets back to his own dinner.
Besides, they'd handled worse.
“Ignore the fact that I’m gonna sound like some childcare book saying this: no one’s perfect at parenting, Sam.” He tilts his head, trying to meet Sam’s eyes, if only briefly. “What matters is that you’re trying.”
Dean blinks in surprise, then shrugs. “Not a lot. They weren’t exactly
Cas eventually pulls back, breathless and dazed. “I- that was-”
A yawning pit opens up inside Dean at the admission.
It’s well past nightfall when they finally drive into Lebanon.
He mentally shakes himself as he starts jogging back in the direction of the bunker. Their situation wasn’t all bad, in no small part with Kevin’s presence acting as something of a liferaft for Sam. He’s not sure he’d be handling things as well without him. The worst of their problems so far was getting the kids into bed most nights. Unfortunately for them, Kevin’s little reverse psychology trick from the first night had turned out to be a one-hit-wonder. Dean had refused to go to bed the very next night, fussing for over an hour with more energy than Sam expected a kid to have. He’d had to resort to bribing Dean (money didn’t do anything for him, but food, and chocolates specifically, seemed a promising currency to bargain with) to finally get him to sleep. Dean’s made a few not-so-subtle attempts since to be bribed into bed.
Dean half-smiles at that ruefully. “You ever heard of retirement, buddy?”
The twink glances skeptically between them with a narrow-eyed look, one corner of his mouth pulled down into a frown. “You two together?”
Kevin's lips press together thinly. "Crowley's royally fucked up my life. I can't ever pretend to go back to normal after all that. And you guys want to let him live."
. We eat here, and I
“What? Stuff like that’s right up your alley. Either that or I seriously reconsider my weather witch theory from before.”
"No. We’ll find him together, Sam," Cas says, expression stubborn and unmoving. Sam sighs.
” Dean asks loudly.
Crowley makes an agreeable, disdainful noise. “It leaves things more up to chance, but yes. Now, I’m assuming this game of Twenty Questions
He manages to grab a few other essentials while the kids are distracted, feeling more than a little relieved when he’s finally able to point their cart in the direction of the checkout counter. They’re halfway past the toy aisle with Dean babbling happily at Sam about his new, fortunately not too pricey Batman sneakers when he realizes he can’t feel Cas gripping onto his pant leg anymore. A glance behind finds Cas parked in front of a shelf of stuffed toys, staring in fascination.
Dean rolls his eyes and ignores him, turning to eye Cas up again.
“That’s alright. Have you seen Dean?”
“Everything alright? You seemed kinda out of it just now, earlier too.”
“Used it up for a bread pudding recipe I found online.” He can practically sense Cas’ dismayed expression without looking up so he adds, “It was already stale. If I kept it any longer it’d start growing mold, and knowing you, I’d end up running you to the nearest ER for food poisoning.”
Cas frowns in confusion before the expression clears into something a mix of surprised and amused. “That’s clever.”
“Alright, alright. What did you have in mind?” he asks. Dean thinks for a second.
, Crowley thinks regretfully, leaning back with a shrug. “It was worth a shot.”
“Anyways,” Kevin continues, looking back down at his book, “I told ‘em to stay within sight of the bunker and they’ve only been out there for,” he glances at his phone, “an hour, barely.”
It’s starting to become a familiar sight now, even if Dean’s staring at the guy from halfway across the room in some kind of weird role reversal of the old days instead of sitting across from him.
All Sam really wants right now is to not get caught in the inevitable crossfire when things go down. It was awkward and uncomfortable enough the last few times it happened, and it doesn’t look like something that’s about to fizzle out once they finally talk.
“I like you too,” Cas says hurriedly, once he gets over his shock. He makes an aborted movement to reach for Dean, in an aim to do what, he doesn’t know. “I more than like you, Dean. I-”
Cas half-smiles at that before it falls away. “I can’t do that anymore.”
Sam. He’s gonna kick his ass first before he kills the both of them, and then move to the other side of the country for good measure.
you were. You knew they’d off you for locking them up there.”
He gets briefly distracted from his work when he notices a familiar face pass by the large front windows. Mal wanders in, clocking Stone-Cold Fox’s presence almost immediately, and gives Rick a wave before heading to the rack of magazines and rifling through it.
be. Could it?
“There’s an old Egyptian legend about when a person dies; their soul would stand for judgment on what kind of afterlife they deserved. Anubis would be the judge, weighing their heart against the feather of Ma’at to test its purity. The person being judged would have to do something they called ‘negative confessions’ - basically ‘I have not done this,’ a couple dozen times over while their heart was being weighed. If the heart weighed the same as the feather, he’d grant them passage into Aaru, which was something like their version of Heaven.”
Cas watches Sam as he eats his ice cream. Sam pretends he doesn’t notice, figuring Cas would say whatever’s on his mind when he’s ready.
Mulling over what he’s been told so far, he glances at Dean in consideration, only needing a moment to confirm a suspicion, but keeps his gaze trained on him until Dean scowls in discomfort.
Dean frowns petulantly. “And we’re back to trusting Crowley again.”
“Thanks for the fashion advice, Tyra Banks,” Sam responds, rolling his eyes with a smile. “What’d you get, Cas?”
“I was?” Dean asks, staring up at her in awe. God, her handmaiden was frakking adorable. She’s kinda mad at Sam for not telling her about this sooner.  “Wait, tha’s a girl’s thing, isn’ it?”
Dean falters, meeting Cas’ eyes. “What?”
They’re both quiet for a few moments, Dean not looking at Cas and Cas sneaking glances at Dean upon realizing that Dean’s embarrassed reaction implied that he didn't much appreciate being stared at, and would possibly become upset were he to catch Cas at it again.
“Anyways, I really gotta go, Sasquatch’s waiting,” Dean says, jutting a thumb behind him in Sam’s direction, still standing by the door and watching their interaction with interest. He moves to leave but abruptly stops, turning back to look at Castiel.
Of course, this would be his luck, why wouldn't it be? Fate’s never seemed to be particularly fond of Sam Winchester in the first place; no reason things would suddenly be easy for him.
“Well,” Cas says hesitantly, “I assume it was a flirtation but Dean was insistent on leaving before I could find out.”
Shit.
“Wasn’t really tuning in when he went off on some items…” he trails off.
“Hey, cheer up Cas. We’ll go get you guys some ice cream, how does that sound?” Sam asks, driving out of the parking lot.
“You’re angry,” Cas says slowly. “At us. At me.”
He doesn’t know why it’s bothering him so much. Okay no, that was a lie. He knows why. He’s known since they’d found the angel tablet, when he very nearly admitted to more than he ever planned to. Known since he sat across from Cas in a tiny motel room and felt like the solid ground got yanked out from under his feet as Cas told him he might off himself facing the weight of his mistakes. Known since- there’s no one specific moment in time that it dawned on him that Cas’ presence in his life was irreplaceable, he just knows.
“I don’t understand why you can’t tell me yourself, Dean. It sounds unusual but not particularly shameful.” Cas’ perception skills were getting better by the day if he’d already managed to suss out that the topic was making Dean feel awkward. Not that it stops the guy from asking anyway. He’d be impressed if he wasn’t being overpowered by said awkwardness.
“I hear someone beckoning me,” Gabriel says, walking out of the kitchen with a fresh tray of cookies. He sets them down on the back counter, eyeing Sam with interest. “Well, hello handsome.”
While he’s wandering around, Dean finds a bright blue stone. It’s a really pretty blue, like Cas’ eyes. He rubs off the mud onto his shirt, shoving it into his pocket. He looks around, searching for Cas, and finds him squatting down near a tree.
“You gave them to me, Dean. That’s all that matters.” Dean blushes, a light pink dusting his cheeks and highlighting his freckles, but he attempts to brush aside the statement.
Dean takes a deep breath in through his nose and doesn’t respond, turning back to the pans in front of him. Just because Crowley isn’t a demon-shaped threat anymore, doesn’t mean he isn’t annoying, first thing in the morning or otherwise.
“You wanna get cheered up a bit or you want the truth?”
It’s not exactly a habit per se, given that it’s only happened a few times since Cas’ unexpected return, but it’s got the makings of one.
They both open their mouth to speak at the same time, but before either of them can say anything the others return with their clothes and that’s the end of that.
Castiel glares at him, resolutely continuing to wipe down the counter in an attempt to ignore his coworker. His shift at
Sam nods agreeably. “I’m here if you ever change your mind.”
“Hey, buddy,” Sam says, kneeling so he’s at eye level with Dean.
lunch
“Unsolicited,” Castiel pipes up.
a good perk,” she agrees. “Hey, you wanna stick around while my baby does her work? I could use the company.”
Or worse, if he’s actually right.
“I’m certain there would be cause for worry if my boyfriend suddenly had an issue with kissing me,” Cas says dryly. “Your concern is appreciated, but as you can see, Dean is fine.”
“Damn it,” Sam curses. An umbrella wasn’t going to do jack in this weather.
Cas moves closer to the passenger-side window, squinting. “I can see foxglove and wolfsbane from here.”
Sam glares down at the table, jaw clenched.
He looks back up at Cas then, decision made, because he intends to be man enough to at least face him when he denies everything, even if it means he has to watch Cas’ eyes cloud over with pain that he’s going to cause.
Sam pauses, knife halfway through a pancake. “Today?”
“I apologize for Gabriel,” Castiel says to Dean, ignoring Gabriel. Dean’s smile is amused, unperturbed and familiar with Gabriel’s antics. “Would you like your usual?”
He lets out a jaw-cracking yawn, trying to remember the snatches of last night’s dream. He remembers Dean and Cas as toddlers, something about grocery shopping, and a giant, stuffed… bee? He snorts quietly. Clearly his brain had interesting ideas about what a normal life looked like.
Sam shakes his head, amused.
” Dean sneezes violently, spraying cereal across the table.
Cas gives a stiff nod.
Sam swallows down his mouthful of spaghetti before he responds, brow raised. “Like what, exactly? I’m not really into celebrating with a Dr. Sexy marathon if that’s what you had in mind.”
“You looked like you could use that.” Kevin nods at Sam’s beer, taking a sip from his own.
Dean and Cas share an ice cream sundae between them that they cheerfully demolish, faces smeared with whipped cream and caramel by the time they’re done. Sam pulls out his phone, sneakily taking a few photos before the kids catch on.
“C’mon, the books are over here,” Sam says, guiding her to one of the desks.
“Saaaaammy,” Dean whines, his high-pitched voice preceding him into the library. “‘m bored, let’s-”
“You’re sure?” Dean asks skeptically. “Cuz I don’t wanna have to keep an eye out for a dog-headed Egyptian god looking to chomp on my heart anytime soon. I didn’t sign up for this when I agreed to help you.”
Cas is even expecting him to, and he could pretend he didn’t admit to something he never really planned to admit to anyone. Life would go on. But then he remembers the little trinkets Cas gave him in return as well, the ones he hid carefully at the very back of his cupboard, away from prying eyes.
Sam leans closer, curiously. “What does it say?”
“Everyone’s already up,” She responds, yanking it away. “Come on. Sam’s already brewed up a fresh pot of coffee.”
"Has this been happening with anyone else?"
“More than the average person,” Crowley responds, leaning back as he sets his book down on his lap. “For the sake of knowledge, of course. Neither Hell nor its denizens had much need of it.”
“Hey,” Dean replies, smiling stiffly. It’s not immediately noticeable for what it’s worth, what with his cheeks being stuffed full, Sam just knows what to look for. Dean’s lucky Cas doesn’t.
done if we’re just playing around all the time?!”
“Do you,” Sam starts hesitantly, “do you remember?” He and Kevin had decided early on that they wouldn’t clue the kids in on what was wrong with their situation. Even after the fight he’d had with Dean and because of how things had gone down, they’d made sure to be vague with the kids. It wouldn’t do any good if they knew, other than being an unnecessary burden to bear of something they couldn’t even remember.
Sam’s trying, and failing, to not let the panic get to him. Cas was already well past that, looking about ready to have a meltdown if they didn't find Dean soon.
He stops dancing when the singer stops to speak, listening in amusement as he returns to shelving the books. He doesn't get to re-shelve more than a few books before the song’s upbeat, dance-y rhythm is back. He allows himself to be swept back up by the beat, dancing around the room once again.
Dean scowls, temper fraying. “Would I joke about a fucking thing like this?!”
“I wanna help!” Dean squirms, trying to get free of the shopping cart.
It's then that Dean notices the baking ingredients still out on the kitchen counter that Cas had forgotten to put away. "Wait. Cas, did you
He slants a glance at Dean before looking back down at his shoebox. He rubs a thumb absentmindedly against the side of the box as he stares at its contents and says, “Human lives are short.” He huffs a small, somewhat humorless laugh. “And we’re not exactly careful, you and I. So I’d like to spend what time I have by your side… as more than just friends.” He peeks up at Dean through his eyelashes nervously. “That is, if you’re amenable to it.”
Dean sulks but doesn’t disagree with Sam’s statement.
They shrug, smirking. “Got distracted.” Plucking a candy bar and some gum from the boxes by the cash register, they slide it over to Rick. “I’ll get these too if it’ll make you feel better.”
“Didn’t ask for one,” Dean says, mouth full and spraying crumbs across the table. Grinning at Sam’s resulting grimace, Dean asks, “What about you?”
“Are you really a queen?” Dean asks, fascination and interest clear on his face.
“Okay,” Cas agrees. “Let’s go get ice cream.”
Once everything has burned to cinders, he turns to the kids. They look exactly the same, but maybe it’s just slow to act. “Feel any different?”
Sam sets his ice-cream cup aside. Clearly, something was bothering Cas.
The rest of dinner ends up similarly amusing, if mostly uneventful for Sam, in that Dean tries his best to avoid conversation with Cas while trying to make sure he doesn’t catch on to anything being off. It’s pretty unsuccessful in Sam’s opinion, but hey, whatever makes him feel better.
He’d initially decided on going to the library and finding a book to read to pass the time. It turned out to be a fruitless endeavor once he found himself rereading the same paragraph three times and still unable to comprehend what he’d just read. His hands itch with the urge to do something – preferably something productive – so he decides to occupy himself re-shelving the books in the library and bring some semblance of order to them.
By the time he gives up trying to pretend he’s actually getting anything done it’s almost dinner time. Not bothering to search out Sam or Cas, he quietly slinks out of the storeroom, making his way to the kitchen to throw something together for them to eat.
Charlie starts singing along when
“Easiest answer? Global warming,” Kevin quips. “That, or you pissed off a weather witch.”
” he says, winking at Castiel before strutting out the door.
“It isn’t,” Sam replies, taking a pull of his beer.
Dinner passes by with Sam and Cas embroiled in a discussion of some book, apparently what he’d been reading before he fell asleep; the most Dean contributes to that is a muttered comment about them starting up a book club which mostly goes ignored. That’s fine with him, not a conversation he wanted to be a part of anyway.
“He seems okay with it. I’ll polish off Cas’ PB&J,” Sam says, pulling Cas’ plate to himself. He takes a bite, chewing slowly. “I tried calling you on the way to give you a heads up but you weren't answering your phone.”
Sam finds himself rudely woken up far too soon by his alarm.
“Can I-” Cas says, eyes flicking down to Dean’s lips. Dean licks them instinctively, feeling a thrill shoot down his spine as he sees Cas’ pupils blow up, eyes going dark.
He’s not sure when he finally realized it, the underlying frustration at Cas always leaving tinted by a need to have him stay that he didn’t quite understand till now. He finally has what he’s wanted now with Cas here, on Earth and human to boot; and isn’t that enough? That’s more than Dean ever thought he’d get, more than Dean ever intended to ask for.
“It’s obvious is what it is,” Dean retorts, preening internally. Cas still didn’t get most jokes, or, if he did, it was in a different angle (usually philosophical in ways Dean just doesn’t get) than what anyone else was seeing. So yeah, Dean’s going to take whatever wins he gets here.
He’s about to go and open up a bottle of the mulled wine he’d snagged yesterday and start on making breakfast when Cas stops beside him, frowning up at the ceiling.
“But what if she’s at home?”
“There’s a… thing,” Dean answers, stilted. Crowley raises a brow, restraining himself from snarking back in reflex at his usual verboseness, prompting him to continue. “It’s making people tell the truth.”
He feels pulled along with the music, socked feet sliding him across the room, book in hand. He deposits it on the shelf he stops in front of, turning back around with a smile playing on his lips.
Figuring he should take advantage of the opportunity he’s been given, he gets changed and out of the bunker in short order. He gratefully inhales the brisk February air as he jogs by the road leading into town.
“‘No’ means no, Sam,” Dean interrupts sharply.
“You and Benny remained… ‘friends’ after Purgatory?” Cas asks, air quotes and all, expression uncertain and something edging on a little displeased. Cas’d never been a big fan of the guy, even till the end, so that’s not all that surprising. It still strikes a nerve in Dean.
“So, what was Gabriel hounding you about this time?” Jody is a good boss, kind and occasionally nosy, but never mean. She’s only asking out of kind concern, Castiel knows, and she’d back down without pushing the matter if he wished. It’s no secret from his coworkers at this point considering how much Gabriel teases him about his crush on Dean so he sees no reason to refrain.
Unfortunately, since real life was a lot more difficult, it meant that they’d occasionally have to split up just to get the jump on a witch. Splitting up wasn’t generally that bad of an idea; it's been a pretty successful one as far as the Winchester track record goes. Case-wise more than life-wise.
When he straightens up again, it’s to find Cas watching him as he eats the bread pudding straight out of one of the containers he’d stowed it in. Instead of being embarrassed about being caught staring, since when has he ever in fact, he takes it as an opportunity to start up a conversation.
“Whatever you say, Cas.”
He’s not entirely sure how he ruined the second one, but the filling had congealed into an inedible thick paste while baking in the oven. It would serve a better life as glue or cement than as a dessert at this point.
“Woah, woah! Don’t go using all of ‘em at once,” Dean says, grabbing his wrist and barely stopping him in time from depositing all of it over the mess. He lets go almost immediately after, not quite meeting Cas’ eyes as he quickly explains how to actually clean it up without making it worse or wasting all their paper towels. Cas readjusts accordingly and it’s only a matter of minutes before they’ve got the spill cleaned up.
Dean shudders exaggeratedly.
“It’s my job to keep asking that,” Dean rebutts. “I’ve been watching out for you since you were in diapers, Sammy. Just cause you’re wearing big boy pants now, doesn’t mean that’s changed.”
“Look, I’m only gonna say this once,” Dean says, rubbing at the back of his head and looking away for a moment, he’s so nervous that it's hard to breathe and looking at Cas is making it worse. But no, he’s not gonna chicken out this time, so he turns back to look Cas in the eye.
Dean groans. “Just… try not to make it a remake of his first Halloween.”
“Listen, I wasn’t able to keep either of you safe either, so if this is anyone’s fault, it’s mine,” Sam says, deciding to change tracks. Cas looks up, ready to object, so Sam continues, “Hunts go wrong sometimes, no matter how good we are. Hell, sometimes our lives are the ones that go pear-shaped, not the hunt.”
Kevin gives him a dry look over his shoulder. “I wasn’t. I’m making my own.”
“What I said earlier wasn’t… wrong exactly. Wait, damn it.” He rubs a hand down his face with a groan. “I sound like a friggin’ sissy. I, uh… fuck it, I
we’re talking about here. It’s not like he hexed you or cast a spell on you or anything.” His eyes light up as an idea occurs to him. “Wait, what if it
“You got a sick sense of humor, you know that?” Dean says, listening for any sounds of his brother or best friend nearby. It’s honestly starting to get ridiculous how long Sam’s taking to get the drop on her. He’ll excuse Cas for now, but this shit is disappointing coming from his own brother. He’s gonna give him hell if it turns out Sam didn’t get stuck in one of her booby traps or something.
“No,” Dean replies shortly. He mutters something under his breath which sounds suspiciously like
“Why didn’t I tell you?” Sam asks, figuring that’s what Cas is trying to get at.
Great. Just, great.
Sam’s jaw drops as his eyebrows disappear into his hair. Dean’s pretty sure he’s never seen Sam look so surprised.
“I have.” At Dean’s patiently amused expression, Cas straightens up. “Oh. You mean for myself.”
“Afternoon!” Rick calls out, glancing over his shoulder. “Need any help with anything?”
“Whatever deal you and Billie made for Jack, he’s not-”
Cas squints.
“Good afternoon,” the guy rumbles back, and whoa, that’s a gravelly voice. Did the dude have rocks and wood chips for breakfast? “And no thank you,” the guy continues, “I’ll manage.”
Sam hesitates for a moment before straightening up, not meeting Kevin’s eyes. “I can’t find Dean.”
Jody hums, nodding sagely.
“Oh, sorry,” Sam says.
Dean’s eyes dart up then, meeting his with wary confusion. “What for?”
Sam shakes his head, setting the water bottle down on the counter and moving to grab his mug. He’d need caffeine for this conversation.
“Man, it feels like forever since I got to feel the sun.” He rubs at his arms immediately after, glad of his usual layers warding off some of the late spring chill. “C’mon, let’s take a walk, just a little bit down the path and back.”
Kevin bites back a snort, downing the rest of his coffee before standing up. “Guess I’m making breakfast.”
“I don’t think he likes it,” Sam tells Kevin slowly, watching Cas swallow it down with a grimace.
Kevin shrugs. Sam decides he’s going to take that as a ‘yes’.
Dean swears colorfully.
“Charlie’s here to help us out,” Sam explains.
Sam pinches the bridge of his nose. “I won’t pretend I know what’s going on in your head anymore. But I’m not going to let you pretend like you aren’t hurting him, because whatever he thinks is going on right now, it’s not good.”
“No, I understand the concept, it’s a rudimentary barter system,” Cas says, waving his hand in front of him to dismiss Dean’s statement. It’s still weird every time Dean notices another mannerism Cas has managed to pick up and emulate in decent human mimicry after years of being as stiff as a tree. “I just don’t understand how it applies to us.”
Sam snorts. ‘
They all turn to look at Cas who’s fallen fast asleep, head drooping onto his chest.
“Shut up,” Dean mutters and starts clearing things away. “Sue me for not wanting to get my sugar fix from a supermarket all the time. Shit,” he swears suddenly, checking his watch. “I forgot about dinner.”
