Tony let out a long sigh and wiped his face with his right hand, the left one still clutched the glass of brandy. "I'm fine, Steve." He rasped. This time the anger  was gone from his tone, only remained the bitterness and the exhaustion. "Everything's fine."
"So, I just braced myself and tried to impress him." Tony explained, "I guess it worked... maybe." His lips shivered slightly but he smiled, expression gentle and melancholic. "Sex was so fucking amazing, I have no word for it."
"And what's so wrong about it?" Tony's question was direct and yet so meaningful. He was still staring, eyes serious and determined. The smile on his lips still so contrastingly gentle.
Right... Maybe it was time to tell his boyfriend about being on PrEP... It wasn't like he had meant to hide it, it just never came up. He had never been the sharing type and when they had reached that kind of intimacy in their relationship, he guessed it didn't really matter anymore. Steve would insist on wearing protection anyway.
to, but he didn't. Out of fear, out of respect, maybe because he was confused. A thought suddenly crossed his mind. A few things Tony had said. Things he had done. The way he acted around Steve sometimes, the way he smelled. Things Steve hadn't noticed before, or maybe had ignored—he wasn't sure—but now it became kind of obvious to him and doubt festered in his heart. It was racing in his chest, so fast it was hard to breathe.
Steve felt a bead of sweat dripping down his spine. His legs were shaky and faltering. He didn't dare turn around and face his boyfriend. "It's even better than my office in SHIELD." He croaked out with a shivering voice.
Tony let go of him, hands sliding down along Steve's shivering body. Steve looked at him hazily, still taken aback, and although he knew he shouldn't do it, his body seemed to lean into his boyfriend, asking for more.
"You stink, Tony." Steve blurted with a tinge of reproach, his characteristic frown darkening his face. Tony probably did. He wanted to laugh but he wasn't sure his face conveyed the feeling. His head was spinning. He stared at the night sky again, slumped all over the ground, limp in Steve's hands, and felt happy. Steve's hands were so warm. He hadn't realized how cold he had been until the warmth of Steve's hands brought back life into him. He hadn't realized how much he had wanted Steve's hands on him, how blissful it was... to have Steve's hands on him, finally.
He let Tony suffer for about fifteen minutes more before climbing behind him on the bed and settling between his spread legs. He slapped his butt which pushed the toy out of Tony's ass. "Up on your knees," he said while pushing the dildo back inside. When Tony was on all four, back arched up, Steve shoved the toy as deep as he could. Tony keened painfully. Then, Steve added his fingers.
It's almost eight pm. Both him and Felicia are fed and washed up, ready for bed. He's not particularly tired but Felicia needs her sleep. She hasn't asked for either of her parents. Steve is as much of a parent to her as her real parents. She's part of the pack. He's an omega of the pack. He is her sire's mate, his
what kind of person he was attracted to. Since he hadn't presented yet, it was not a thing he wasted time on. Maybe he was wrong not to, what did he know? He was just fairly uninterested.
Steve snorted and grinned evilly, a tinge of jealousy in the fire he felt burning at the bottom of his stomach that he ignored to focus on the bigger, arousing part of it. He pulled out the big toy and splayed his hands on Tony's butt, spreading his cheeks a little and staring at his gaping hole.
His mum makes a weird face when she sees the both of them drinking coffee and eating pancakes and scrambled eggs but she doesn't comment. Instead she silently give a soft kiss on Steve's forehead and ruffles Tony's head. Then her hand slides down on his cheek and she congratulates him for being admitted to MIT, because she hasn't had the chance to yet and she looks at him with pride which seems to unsettle Tony greatly, but he accepts the gesture with gratitude, eyes a little wet. "Thanks Ma'am."
There was a moment when Steve stopped listening. The questions whizzed and Steve was blind and deaf to them. He just saw red. He probably
It's not enough, not thick enough, not deep enough, the omega wants more and impales himself brutally on Steve's hand.
Tony smiled and breathed out, blowing warm and seductive air onto Steve's lips. "Rogers..." He slurred. "It's cute that you still think you can say no to me." Tony's eyes were hungry, lust pooling in them. His mouth was dangerously close, lips lifting just enough to show his teeth. His hands caged Steve while his body pressed against his, grinding, trying to find a place between Steve's legs. Steve had no chance. His boyfriend started nuzzling into his neck, sniffing him like a dog. He nibbled and bit, following the trail of his tense muscles down to his collarbone.
She gave him ointments and meds and looked with a focused, medically concerned stare at the bruises on his neck. "Did you get choked?"
His mum dropped her spatula in the sink and turned around slowly. She had a wide smile of her face. "Really?" She asked with enthusiasm, then she wiped her hands on apron and sat down in front of him, expression resolute. "Good. I'll make an appointment with Dr Erskin." She said factually.
Right. Drink first. Then get high. Then plan for avenging Steve. Or how to make Tony suffer and die a horribly painful and agonizing death.
Steve's hands tighten around him and his touch ignites every cell in Tony's body. He's on fire. Who said he had a size kink? His boyfriend's shape fits so perfectly in his arms. He never wanted more. He hides some more into Steve's neck and breathes his scent in. Steve smells amazing but it might a side effect of alcohol. Tony isn't sure.
Natasha took the bouquet with hesitating hands, eyes staring right back at Tony, questioning. Her smile had faded to leave place to a profound emotion Steve had rarely seen on her face. They stared into each other's eyes for a moment a bit too long for Steve's tastes before Tony broke the silence, stuttering an emotional "You look radiant, tonight." Nat almost blushed and Tony walked to her to kiss her on the cheek, a hand on her hip curled around her waist in a gesture more intimate than decency should allow between friends. "Did you put on weight?" He whispered with a soft smile. "It suits you very much. You're gorgeous." Natasha beamed.
But soon the reality caught up to him. Happy was gonna drive his dad home and he was a disgusting slut, full of Obie's cum. Was he really gonna meet Steve in this state and kiss him with that mouth? Did he have the time to get back home, have a thorough shower, and still make it to the party?
He ran as fast as he could, quite used to weave his way between people, and tried to join his art class before the second bell. He rushed headlong through the hall, portfolio pressed to his chest, and bumped right into a tall strawberry blond omega.
Everyone could feel the tension between them but no-one paid attention. Or at least they were nice enough to pretend they didn't.
Steve hadn't. Steve hadn't thought about telling anyone actually. Steve would have thought Tony would want discretion, after everything he had gone through. And besides, they hadn't even talked about it, about them. So far, to Steve, their relationship was still—were they in a relationship? Apparently they were and the news was...unsettling, overwhelming,
Tony felt different however. As opposed to Steve, he loved everything they were. He had loved every bit of it. Every moment. Every word. Every touch. Every look. And if he survived this, he would cherish those memories for the rest of his miserable and pathetic life.
They both worked in the workshop in a rather lighthearted and comfortable silence. Him on his sketches, Tony on whatever it was he was doing that was important. A couple of hours later, as Steve felt himself doze off again and his eyes were tingling as he forced them open, he decided to go to bed without his boyfriend. He had been nodding off a few times while waiting for Tony to finish but apparently his boyfriend was nowhere near being done with his work tonight so he left him to it without regret. He was too exhausted for that. And it's not that it wasn't something that he was used to already. Tony always had a weird sleeping schedule. He straightened up and stretched his arms while yawning in exhaustion, walked to his boyfriend and left a soft kiss on his temple while he whispered good night to him. Tony hummed in response and mumbled a good night back. Steve's hand lingered on his shoulder and their fingers brushed as he headed out toward the glass-paned sliding doors.
Tony will eat the bowl regardless and savor the moment. Truth is, Tony doesn't need to be here. He should already be downstairs in fact, but he purposely stays, pretends to be focused on his tablet and busy with work just to enjoy this moment. Just for the pleasure of feeling Steve's hands brush over his back and his wet hair against his skin and having him scowl at him and worry about his health. Truth is, Tony would do anything to make Steve happy. Even eating breakfast when he's not hungry. Even wait three years to finally live together. Even quit smoking, the only bad habit he had wished to keep because it really calmed his nerves. He just wishes he knew how to make Steve happy.
When Tony walked back inside, Steve was fully dressed and sadly soft. He threw a warm coat and old jeans at his boyfriend who blinked at him in surprise. Tony raised questioning eyes to him and Steve just blurted a casual "Get dressed! I made breakfast" in response.
Tony chuckled in response. "What? And don't tell me he had a tiny dick," he joked half-heartedly, "'cause I kinda had the opportunity to get my hand on his crotch so..."
When the conversation finally quieted and diverted on other subjects Steve finally mustered up the courage to ask. The assembly was smaller, the smokers had been taking a break. Betty had left for the bathroom. It was only the sixth of them, Buck and Clint, Bruce, Steve, Sam and Natasha.
"You're not going..." Howard repeated skeptically, arms still crossed. He didn't move but his body was tense and Tony could see the anger flaring in his eyes.
"Damn you!" Steve whispered. "You know how crazy I am about you. How can you even compare yourself to the others..."
"That being said," Pepper concluded with her usual curt and bossy tone. "It's not like you've ever been ashamed of your shitty behavior before so you're gonna pull your head out of your ass and take fucking responsibility for it and you'll go to this party with your head high."
a poor kid from Brooklyn to help him out with his English assignments. Tony certainly didn't need anyone and certainly not the likes of him. He could probably afford having a private tutor or several tutors, one for each subject. Why had Tony transferred to their lousy school anyway? So far from home?
Steve ignored the pang in his chest. He wouldn't let this undermine his determination. He wasn't giving up. "Tell him I'll wait."
"Let me take you out to lunch." He whispered. His voice sounded broken and hoarse with Steve's previous treatment.
"Love appears in so many different ways." Betty carried on. "What the two of you have is unconventional but that does mean it's not gonna work. It's very romantic, despite what people might think. I wish you the best."
It's not only mental or physical pain. It's not like what he has been experiencing for years. It has nothing to do with how Hydra broke him and destroyed him to the core. It's more than that. It's deeper. It's his entire being, body and soul, that suffers.
Tony takes some time to contemplate the room and each detail of it while he sips his beer slowly. It's very well thought of, he thinks, contrarily to what people might think. Tony is pretty sure he can catch a lot of the references. He smiles to himself until he notices something hard under his shoulder blade. He twists around and puts the beer down on the bedside table in order to grab the thing that keeps poking at his back and stares at it bewilderedly.
Tony lowered his head and looked down, feeling the bile coming up at the back of his throat. His entire body shivered with conflicted feelings. As if the humiliation hadn't been painful enough already. Obie had to be a witness of it all. Tony dared a quick glance up into the man's eyes but turned his head immediately, as if his gaze was burning him. The tall man walked up to him. Tony had grown up a lot in size but Obie was still taller, broader and much more impressive than Tony would ever be. He put a strong hand on his shoulder and Tony flinched a little before melting into the warmth of it. Obie had always tempered the conflictual relationship Tony and his father had. He had always been there to coddle him afterwards, to tend to his wounds, physical or otherwise. This hadn't changed. Obie gave him a comforting fatherly smile. "Don't be mad at your father, Tony." He muttered with a deep sugary voice, one that both ignited and repulsed him. "He just wants the best for you."
Tony's face paled and he withdrew his hand as fast as he had put it, like he had been burnt. Horror distorting his features and then the pain, pooling in his eyes. "I'm so sorry, babe." He whispered, out of breath. "I'm so sorry." His hands were shaking and he started fidgeting. "I—I—I—I'm not like this." He choked out, stuttering. "I'm not this guy, Steve. I'll never be, I..." He stared into his eyes with shame, anxious and self-loathing. "I just wanted to kiss you." He let out in a shuddering sigh.
He did have pretty intense feelings for Tony. He'd had them for a while, although it took him a long time to make sense of them. His mind went all over the place, suddenly overwhelmed with rushes of forgotten emotions and intense memories. When did he fell in love with Tony? Could he really answer that question honestly? Even only to himself.
Sam arrived when they were about to start the main course. Natasha's eyes shone and she erupted out of her seat to rush to the door. She was beaming when she followed him back and he sat next to her. Sam waved at everyone and nodded at their greetings. Steve stood up and demanded a hug that Sam happily gave him. He looked a little tired, Steve observed, but his smile was happy and gentle. Steve couldn't but notice the strands of grey hair on his temples. Sam had aged since the last time they saw each other. It seemed an eternity since they had a serious discussion about their respective lives. They had so much to catch up on.
"Did you pass out?" She asked in the same professional, disinterested tone. He should have kept his mouth shut. He didn't even remember. He thought he did, maybe more than once, but he didn't think it was wise to say it. He nodded anyway, feeling the scrutinizing stare pressing him for answers. She had a mean way to push him into a corner, Tony felt he had to.
"Me neither..." Tony whispered chokingly. "And it's not for lack of trying, believe me." He added, in a lighter, self-deprecating tone.
"What I'm saying is..." Steve went on. "Please don't do it again! And I don't mean the rough sex, Tony... I mean, I can
The hot water felt so good on his skin, slowly awakening all the cells in his numb body, it was exhilarating. Steve had taken a particularly long shower this morning and the heat was making him feel dizzy now. He glanced at his reflection while he tied a huge towel around his thin waist, his abused sensitive skin was all red and puffy. He regretted nothing. Not even the love bite cradled in the crook of his neck, reminiscent of last night. An unwilling smile spread on his face as he looked away from the mirror, avoiding his own reflection and the shameful blush that had started to creep on his face.
Steve retorted curtly. "What is it that you don't know? You don't know why you didn't stop them? You don't know if you
Tony quieted and studied him for a moment, a tinge of disdain in his pout. "Some of my creations I keep for myself..." He finally said in a falsely calm and bitter tone.
Tony had shifted onto his stomach, claiming his space on the huge bed. He was dozing off, although he looked pensive still. Steve was wide awake however. He turned on his side and brushed his fingers up and down Tony's spine. His boyfriend imperceptibly shivered.
So I guess, we're all getting bored with this series which is why I'm taking a break. I might come back to it at some point, to give it some sort of conclusion, or not... I'm not sure.
The alpha's voice is so sensual, hoarse and tired but strong and comforting. His entire body vibrates at the sound. He feels heat pooling at the pit of his stomach and spread through his vein like fire.
Steve finally found the courage and plunged himself in his own assignment. It was still so very warm around them and from time to time Steve felt Tony's bare foot brush against his ankle and warmth pooled in his stomach, making him shiver at the touch. When he raised his head, he would see Tony biting on his pencil or rolling it around his thumb while he rubbed his temple with his other hand, pouting at his paper. His eyes would linger for a little too long on the shape of his lips and ran down his square jaw and his sturdy shoulders.
You don't even know shit about him, or us. There was nothing serious in our relationship. The only person Stephen ever cared about is himself." Steve could see on everyone's face how they disagreed though.
Tony giggled and pinched his lips, wetting them again. "Please, say a blowjob." He teased, unconsciously sticking the tip of his tongue out.
was what he would have answered if he had had the chance, but Tony didn't let him and before he could understand what was happening to him, the alpha had jumped on him and Steve felt the pressure of his soft, beautiful lips against his and a jolt of electricity ran through him, down his spine and along his limbs. His entire body electrified. He had never felt something so overwhelmingly powerful before. He lost control and felt a wave invade him, a mix of repressed desire, forbidden pleasure and fear.
"Please indulge me." Steve whispered softly into his ear while running gentle fingers into his hair. He felt Tony's chest shake with a silent chuckle and tightened his embrace. "Also, where the hell did you find cigarettes?"
Bucky swallows and pauses before talking again, voice a little hoarse. "The only thing I know of is that you're scared..." he says, sounding sympathetic. "I know you've already been pregnant, Steve. Don't even think I wouldn't know about it."
He knows he's pregnant and he feels the tears prickle at the corner of his eyes at the sudden entrancing realization of it. A surge of warmth and happiness invades him while his pup climbs onto his lap. He and Steve share a look. The blond omega is smiling blissfully, rays of light illuminating his soft features, hair golden with a happy glow. Is Steve pregnant too? Would he know if he was? After all, Bucky didn't realize until he was way past the limits for an abortion the first time. And now he already knows. Now he's sure and welcomes the news with a great, fulfilling satisfaction. He looks at Steve again and sees him watch the way his hand fondles his belly.
His heart is pounding now and he wants to cry for no reason. He sits back into the couch and tries to pour himself another drink. His feelings are too raw, he needs the numbness. Except the warm and gentle hand of his boyfriend stops him half-way. He turns his head on the side, startled, and is met with a glaring frown.
I know I haven't put much effort into this fic but if you still enjoyed it I'd love to get your feedbacks. ;-)
"Oh there was this really annoyingly persistent guy who followed me around everywhere." Jane was happy to answer. "I really thought he had lost a bet or something at first..."
"I gotta go, my mum's gonna get worried." Steve tried to explain and he stumbled out of the car. His body was hot all over, burning and stinging. He just wanted to tear his clothes off. He started to lose his breath and hyperventilated. He wanted to scream as hard as he could, releasing everything out. He wanted to run again, and never stop. Run a marathon until the pain, the
a place." Steve exclaimed amusedly as he sat up slowly and leant forward to cup his boyfriend's cheeks in gentle hands. "I live here now, don't I?" He muttered softly.
Something zeroed out in Steve's mind. Sex. Of course he wanted to have sex. Right here right now. It was everything he could think about at this exact moment and the inside of his pants agreed very much with that suggestion. He was so hard it hurt and his body was burning and his mind was going blank against and he didn't know where he was anymore.
"Yeah, you are." Steve muttered, still smiling widely. "But it's alright. I'm madly jealous of about all the people who ever laid their eyes on you. So it's okay if you're a bit jealous of those I shared something meaningful with."
Dark-haired guy laughed. "Unless..." He started with a lewd smile and a perverted glint in his eyes. "That's something you're into?"
"What's wrong with you? Are you for real?" Bucky look utterly troubled and somehow vulnerable and it made Steve want to attack him. He leant closer, seeking the lips of the alpha he had watched pretty much his whole life now that he thought of it.
Steve is now genuinely puzzled. He takes a look inside and the contents of the bag makes his cheeks heat and turn pink almost instantly. His heart starts racing, thumping hard in his chest. He looks into Tony's eyes. No smile on his lips but rather looking for answers, maybe showing some gratitude as well. Tony's smile is dying, growing insecure.
Tony's breathing was slowing down slowly. He pinched his lips and took a deep breath before opening his eyes again and smiling back at Steve. Then he lay down next to him and caught his mouth into a hot, cum-tasting, filthy kiss and they snuggled against each other.
other options... but I can't help feeling like it's getting more and more unreachable. I kinda have come to terms with it actually. I'm happy with just the two of us."
James brushes his lips on Tony's cheek—he smells refreshed and energetic and so good he makes Tony's head spin—and takes a sleeping Felicia from her sire's arms to put her into bed.
Steve washed his clothes and put them in the dryer and kissed him goodbye for a long moment while waiting for Happy to pick him up.
With JARVIS's help, he prepared a tray with food and coffee and rode the elevator down to the workshop. To his surprise, the walls were entirely made of see-through glass, unbreakable glass he supposed, and Steve could distinguish the shape of someone resembling Tony in the middle of the huge area filled with marvelous things, each more incredible than the next. Steve had been completely amazed in the Malibu mansion but this had nothing to do with the small—in comparison—workshop in Malibu. His heart twinged when he saw the focused stance of his boyfriend. With a racing heart and weak knees, he observed from behind the glass doors, tray forgotten in his hands. He almost dropped the thing before remembering why he had come down in the first place. He put the tray down, after JARVIS told him he was denied the entrance again, and hit the walls, calling out for Tony. He did so for five minutes at least, before realizing that the walls were completely soundproofed and there was no way Tony could hear anything.
"As your medical doctor, I shall really advise you against that kind of practices, especially when under the influence of drugs." She said while she looked into his eyes and ears, listened to his heart and kept asking questions about the potential symptoms he had had. "There is no safe way to do it, even with experienced partners. It might affect your lungs, your heart, your brain, you whole body... in a permanent way." Tony felt his heart heave at the word
It takes her a moment to feel the presence behind her. It's the voice that snaps her out of her reveries. "You okay, Nat?" Clint says.
Steve grinned and planted a kiss on his boyfriend's sugary lips, ignoring the fast beating of his heart that Tony's heart-wrenching revelation had just provoked.
He started laughing, a bit despite himself. It was probably nervous. "You aren't seriously thinking that I'm ever gonna move in here, are you?"
"I..." Steve starts, voice croaky. "I'd love that." He finally says, swallowing the lump in his throat. At that Tony's confidence comes back, boosted up, and he keeps pushing Steve backward until his back bumps against the stairway behind them. Tony grabs his head with both his hands, they're clammy, and he kisses him again, dominantly. Steve lets him take control and melts into it, moaning in his boyfriend's mouth. Tony grinds into him, half-hard against his stomach and they make out until they're both breathless.
"Bucky and I have been talking." Steve says with his incomparable Captain America voice. Tony feels shivers and finally turns back to look at him. The words sound ominous. He frowns before he realizes Steve's stance is not as confident as it sounded. He looks nervous and wavers on his feet, wiping his clammy hands on his jeans. "and we think—" Tony widens his eyes, listening attentively to that grand idea both his omegas have come up with now. "—that you need to get laid."
Something melancholic pooled in the dark of his eyes. And suddenly all kinds of dark thoughts came rushing back, overwhelmingly intrusive. Thoughts, feelings he had buried and didn't want to ever remember. Everything he had been going through those past week as an outed male omega. Everything he had endured before that.
and yet I couldn't read him, at all. Like... I've always been proud of my observant skills. I usually
"Besides, not everyone is enjoying themselves." Clint interjected, sounding genuinely disturbed by the new turn of events. "Just saying..."
The silence lingered and this time it was heavy. "And?" Tony asked after a moment. Steve wondered for a short while if Tony had asked if he had been sandwiched after all or Steve's opinion on the whole things. He figured it was the former and answered.
for days so he could just forget, too many thoughts of Steve still bugging him at the back of his mind. He just wanted to chill and numb his brain.  That pervading uneasiness needed to go away.
"You sure? 'Cause I don't wanna get in trouble with a certain someone for getting you drunk off your face. You know how scary your boyfriend can be."
known?" He spat bitterly, words as cold and biting as the freezing winter breeze. "Why didn't you fucking tell me? I could have prevented this. You're always complaining that I'm not telling you things but what should I say about you? How many more skeletons are there in your closet?"
Steve has a hand on his hip and shifts his weight on one leg, revealing a glimpse of his thin waist perfectly highlighted by the gray waistcoat he is wearing under the dark blue jacket of his suit. A peculiar choice of color but very sexy nonetheless. It suits Steve perfectly. Everything does.
"I never wanted to get pregnant. I hate the thought of it. Just imagining another being growing inside me makes me feel nauseous."
Tony chuckled but it sounded more like a desperate keening sound. "Fuck Rogers... You don't have to ask."
At some point he was mildly concerned with his own safety. That was probably another Steve thing, it wasn't something Tony was usually inclined to. He really needed to stop randomly thinking about him in that kind of situations. It was becoming unhealthy... He quickly scanned through the worst case scenarios, though. What was the worst thing that could happen to him, really? He could pass out... He probably would, not a big deal. They could beat him up... nothing that hadn't happened before, nothing he wasn't prepared for either, he would probably welcome it. And if it left him disabled well, perhaps he would get something out of it. They could steal from him... His credit cards and his phone had extra security systems, JARVIS was behind it, at best they would be able to rob him of a couple of grands. A trifle... They could get arrested for public indecency. Hum... His dad would go berserk, that would be fun and the rest was something he would gladly let Tomorrow Tony handle. What else? Right... they could also (intentionally or accidentally) kill him. But... well... would it really be problem, per se? And what if they abducted him and kept him as a (sex-)slave, wouldn't that be fun? Of course, they might also be deranged people who would enjoy torturing him and would cut off his body parts and rape what was left of him all day long. That would be a bummer but Tony finally decided that this was very unlikely and was willing to take the risk. After all, he might even end up enjoying it in the end.
say no. Although it's much much easier to say it knowing that he belongs to Steve. There isn't much certainty in Tony's life but this is one of them. A constant, a truth that Tony is holding on to, to keep himself afloat.
he had a boyfriend too. It was quite unsettling actually. Everything was and he was more confused than anything else. Had he known... People were already gossiping, speculating about him, about Sam, about Bucky. It wasn't that strange in fact, knowing that only five percent of the population was alpha. Sam, Buck and Natasha were the only alphas at school Steve knew of. And Banner apparently, who was alpha too, according to Tony, but didn't want anyone to know. Steve was starting to understand why. All those years, Steve had wanted one thing: present as an alpha. Be like Bucky. Be respected. Now that it was happening, it was just scary and overwhelming. All this unwanted attention, all this gossiping, this strangeness. People were suddenly wary around him. He should have taken scent-confusers...
Tony chuckled incredulously and teased Steve with a mischievous smile. "You obviously more..." He said mockingly. "
Steve closed the distance between them and grabbed the lapels of Tony's hoodie before burying his head into the warmth of his chest. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and sighed in relief. "I'd like to sign up for another year, please." He mumbled, voice muffled in the fabric of Tony's pajamas.
Your great grand father built this company from the ground. When he came to this country he had nothing. Your grand father helped us win the war. Imagine a world where Hitler hasn't been defeated." He suggested while adding a large movement to his arm to emphasize his point.
Tony's smile died down and Steve felt internally amused at his startled face. He regained his composure soon enough and grinned widely. "No-one ever complained." He muttered, a smug expression of his face. "Why would you say that anyway?"
All in all, Steve had imagined something much bigger, much swankier, much more...more everything, he guessed. He hadn't imagined something as cosy and simply decorated like that. The furniture was of the best quality, there were famous artists exhibited on the walls—although, not that much after all, it was all perfectly designed to be both practical and comfy but most of all... Most of all, it
Steve bit his lips, trying to repress a fit of anger. "That was quite a glamorous way to describe our sordid first shag in a back alley." He finally rasped.
Steve stared into his eyes, dumbfounded and tried to find an answer in his elusive smile but found none. Tony's expression was fragile however, a crack in his usual self-confidence. A glimpse of the real him, shy and insecure and so honest. He was so handsome Steve found it hard to breathe.
Tony huffed out a nervous breath. His shoulders tensed up, Steve recognized the upward movement his shoulder blades made when he shrugged and he abruptly turned around, frowning down at Steve, eyes glaring.
Natasha interrupted the awkward tension that seemed to be rising between the two of them. "Oooh." She cooed. "Do tell!" Tony turned to her and smiled to her, looking thrilled. He chuckled softly and looked down, blushing a little, and Steve couldn't not find that cute, despite everything.
The alpha turned him on his stomach and rolled him around the bed. His feet touching the floor, his knees buckling against the mattress, he gets drilled onto the bed, the alpha pounding so hard into him, thighs smacking against his buttcheeks until he spurts his warm come inside, deep inside and blows up like an inflated balloon, invading his wombs.
When he finally woke up in the morning, he had his hand on himself and his bed was damp with sweat. He felt empty and tired, body stiff and feverish. He rubbed himself one last time, emptying himself once more, enraged and out of breath. He arched his back on his bed with the pain and the need to cry out and finally, finally he felt a surge of relief. Tears were running down his red cheeks. His throat hurt from all the panting, he was dizzy. Millions of thoughts swirling around in his head and Tony, everywhere, highjacking his brain. The smell of him, the taste of him, the touch of his rough fingers... His hand still on himself, he felt it grow slowly and expand and grow more.
Steve was back on his paper, gnawing at his pen and avoiding Tony's interested gaze. "What about me?" He asked nonchalantly.
Tony smiled back at her, charmed, and hoisted himself on his feet, grabbing her waist possessively, smiling enticingly.
die? Yes, that's it, find a way not to die, or at least, live a little longer? Fix the weaknesses in his body, the failure of his heart. Yes, all that, but first pups. Make pups. No, water. Rehydrate his omegas first
Tony was leaning on the doorframe, waiting for Steve to knock on the door. Steve hesitated, slightly bewildered by the intensity in his boyfriend's eyes. He was smiling, lovingly, happily, silent. An expensive bottle in one hand, the flowers in the other. The moment could have lasted eternity Steve would never get bored.
jealous." Tony insisted, curling his arms around Steve's waist. Steve smiled tenderly and tiptoed to give him a gentle kiss on the lips, wrapping his arms around his neck. Tony answered the kiss eagerly and it was passionate, loving and tender.
Steve shrugged again. "I'm only gonna keep my oldest books. Out of nostalgia... But everything else, I can find it in the tower."
The doctor raised another unconcerned eyebrow. "Sure, do you have a name I should address you with?" She asked, almost amusedly.
They stared into each other's eyes silently for a very short moment, just enough time for Steve to see Tony's crestfallen face grow pale and distraught and his lips shiver. And then he heard a bang and a smashing sound. He didn't how it had happened but Tony's glass was scattered all around him, on the bar and on the floor and he was staring at his trembling hands.
Steve ruffled his hair again. "I can't." He sighed regretfully. While he was slowly getting his back his consciousness, his eyes wandering to the unfinished board that was due two days ago and he felt a pang in his chest.
"Didn't?" He asks falsely innocent. "Well, good, because that would be outlandish... and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type." He mumbled Clearly. "With this... laundry list, of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public."
"What if it happened with someone else?" Tony asked in a hurt, strangled voice. "I've had so many hook-ups... I don't even remember half of them. What if it happened... with someone else, with—with a
Steve felt a pang in his chest. He thought of himself and his own image, how people see him, what they perceived of him. He was just a short, skinny, sickly and useless kid who hadn't even presented. How could anyone want anything to do with him? He looked at the new boy again, his intent stare, the cute pout on his lips, the focused frown on his handsome face, his dark hair and mysterious eyes. His tall and slender figure. He hated this guy. Everything he was, everything he represented, he loathed it.
After four weeks Clint started coming back regularly. After six weeks everyone came back to live there. And everyone made a point to spend as much time together as they could. They were rarely on their own and Bucky was smiling a lot. And Steve's friends got to know him, the real him, the carefree and social guy he had always been.
Deeply captivated. Nothing else mattered at that moment and he had completely forgotten about his own assignment. Why had he agreed to this? Of course it was going to be torture, spending hours, one-to-one with Tony Stark, doing homework.
"Is that something you'd like to change?" He asks but this time it's genuine. "Maybe it just needs finding the right place, or the right person." His heart flutters when he thinks about his boyfriend right next to him, chatting with Clint and Bucky.
Steve felt suddenly overwhelmed by a wave of despair. He dropped his head in his hands as a cold shiver ran up his body. "Tony, wait!" He shouted.
Tony stopped and inched back from Steve's embrace, putting firm hands on his shoulders. He stared into his eyes with an intense seriousness.
It's not long before the hurried steps of Felicia echo down the corridor and the door slams open. Steve feels overwhelmed by a surge of happiness but he doesn't know if it's coming from him or from Bucky.
He watched her swirl around helplessly, mesmerized by her natural beauty. The retrained anger barely distorting her pretty face. "Hey! Watch out, cunt!"
Tony raised his eyes to him and sat up on his knees. "It'll have to be as spacious as the Penthouse. With the same view." He answered, smile dancing on his lips. "And less than a ten minutes walk from here and from your work place. I want to be able to set up my workshop there too."
"You getting it on with an omega right behind my back. You're too young for kids, Stevie. I can't believe I actually trusted you with your "I'm into alphas" thing." You're just like every other teenage boy!"
Steve sighs, shoulders slumped in defeat. He pauses and looks away, expression forlorn. "No, we can't." He agrees. "But we can start over."
Tony's heart drifted away during the entire phone call. He was tired and weary. His breathing was unusually fast and a little jerky, he tried to hide it. His chest was heaving. He couldn't even fight back, because he had already lost. Steve reproached him things he had insisted he accepted. Tony could just shut his mouth and take it, that was all he was good for anyway.
It is Bucky, hitting the peak of his heat again and Tony who fucks into him mindlessly, driven only by instincts. He's exhausted too. And Steve orgasms, or rather, it's Bucky who does. Or maybe Tony. Perhaps both at the same time. The pleasure hits Steve brutally and he keens and cries, literally cries. A sobbing and weeping mess, eyes blinded with tears.
Tony feels the need to push him down on his knees, conflicted as to keep admiring how beautiful and proud Steve is for a little while longer or to give in to his urges and submit the untamed omega. He represses the feeling, ignoring the spike of electricity that run through his body and the overwhelming natural excitement he feels at the sight of his omega.
He can't anymore because all he can see when James is too close is Steve's crestfallen face on that day he swapped their names. The pain of betrayal distorting Steve's beautiful features. A reflection of Tony's ugliness and depravity. The day Tony finally realized how despicable he was.
Steve jerked his head on the side. His eyes met the mischievous glint in his boyfriend's gaze. Tony had a fond smile on his lips. "What?"
"I think that's when I really started to have feelings for you. Even though I was still a bit conflicted."
It's the smell that makes Steve's head jerk in their direction, he thinks. His nose flares and his eyes flickers with lust at the sight of them. He freezes, gorgeous in his grimy Captain America uniform, lips parted and unable to make a movement. Bucky knows there is a wave of slick dripping along his thigh and soiling his uniform even before he can smell it in the air. He knows the feeling too much and he knows his fellow omega too much as well.
Then he remembered he had programmed JARVIS to send Steve to voicemail every time Howard or Obie were in immediate proximity. Neither of them need know of Steve's existence. It was bad enough they had both guessed Tony had someone important in his life, important enough at least to dare standing up to them. Tony had always had a nasty rebellious streak but both men had managed to dampen his spirit by systematically squashing his miserable attempts. This was most certainly going to bite him back in the ass soon and he needed to be more careful in the future, granted Tony would be able to keep Steve in his life long enough for anything to happen, of course. Which was very unlikely.
Steve felt his lips quirk up in a happy relief. "Good." He replied. "Because I'm not going anywhere. You won't get rid of me so easily."
Steve felt a shiver run down his spine and felt the tears prickle at the corners of his eyes. "You didn't care when I broke up with you..." He choked out with a broken voice. He didn't know why he needed to twist the knife into the wound, why he kept harping on about something that was too many years old to even be mentioned but it still stung. It still grazed in the deepest part of himself like something never-endingly needing to be resolved between them.
"Don't compare me with an eight-year-old boy who was alone, lost and confused, and easily manipulated. I'm perfectly aware of what consensual means." He bore his eyes into his boyfriend's. "It's not about the sex... I didn't like being used. It didn't feel right... I felt bad afterwards, because I knew there was something wrong and you ignored my feelings. And you kept rejecting me for no reason. It's not all black and white, Tony, it's fucking
Nothing more was said, to the great disappointment of Schmidt, and Steve was allowed to his seat which he reached quite efficiently, quietly weaving his way in between the tables. Sam gave him a silent smile and nodded approvingly then his expression turned into a concerned frown when he saw the blood on his temple.
The office wasn't as fancy as the art studio in the Tower but it was practical, ergonomic and filled with books and items they could use as reference. The wall at the back of the room was completely hidden by huge shelves and book cases that went up to the ceiling, filled with all kinds of things, from figurine to pictures, to paint, to comic books. The other walls were covered with posters of the Avengers, of course, and a few personal pictures that Steve had brought but only he knew the significance of them.
Steve's voice was warm and gentle, just like his touch. "Let's get you home." He whispered while wiping his face off carefully. Surely he must have done something right in his life to have a boyfriend like this, he thought. He didn't deserve him. Steve should leave him here, to die. He was trash. But Steve didn't leave him here, he took off his hoodie to give it to Tony and wrapped him up inside, the smell of it so heady and amazing.
Steve's smile softens when he senses Tony's presence behind him. The Omega is open and welcoming and Tony is so close he can feel the warmth emanating from his body like a comforting lullaby. Steve swivels slowly and their eyes meet. His smile is ravishing. Tony's heart skips again but he ignores it. For a moment they stand there, staring into each other's eyes without a word or a motion. Tony feels goosebumps all over his skin.
Clint walks back to him before the uneasiness settles in his heart and hooks his shoulder to lead him to their bedroom with a mischievous smile.
Steve listened to his boyfriend, the moment suspended in the air, and realized he didn't care about it anymore. What bothered him was not what had happened that day but rather the nonchalance Tony showed. As if none of this mattered. "It doesn't bother you, not knowing?"
Tony gave him an innocent smile, although his eyes glinted with mischievousness. He looked at his watch. "Well, it's time for lunch..."
Unable to subdue Tony, the guy turned his rage toward Steve and things escalated. Tony panicked and felt like his heart was going to explode. He could hardly move or think straight at this point but if one of those guys tried to lay a finger on Steve, he would have to kill them. He quickly looked around to study his surroundings and find potential weapons. He spotted a few things that could do the trick—Tony knew one or two ways to kill someone barehanded anyway. He started to elaborate a strategy to get up and get to those weapons before one of them could reach Steve. Then, he prepared his plan of attack. Tony could probably take two down by surprise. The third one would be trickier, besides, trying to move a limb was kind of an ordeal at this precise moment, and he didn't feel like killing dark-haired guy yet, some misplaced affection surely...
Sam stretched on his seat, putting a nonchalant arm around Natasha's shoulder and she relished in the casual gesture. "Well, for once," he started, "I can genuinely say that I second your boyfriend, Steve."
His boyfriend keened frustratingly. "Fuck, Steeeeve...." Steve heard as he spasmed uncontrollably through the aftershocks of his orgasm. He kept rocking slowly into his boyfriend's ass, seeking his own pleasure and moaning shamelessly, and he finally collapsed on top of him, giving him a sloppy kiss. He opened his eyes, in a daze, and was met with two glaring dark marbles.
They might have been deeply touched by Tony's story but Steve wouldn't know. Tony was the only one he could see right now, everything else was blurry. He barely noticed how Clint nuzzled against Tony in a comforting friendliness.
If scenting his freshly discovered alphaness had been an unexpected surprise to his friends this morning,
Natasha offered a drink to everyone and started to make a toast, thanking everyone present. She was standing in the living room in a close-fitting red dress. Beautiful but not too sexy, caressing her shape softly. The fabric thick enough for it to remain casual and respectably smart. Steve looked at her for a moment, studying her face. Tony was right, there was something different about her but he couldn't point it out. Her complexion seemed more colorful. Her forms more voluptuous. She looked happier. Maybe Tony was right, she had put on weight. He couldn't believe Tony had been more observant than him though. It was supposed to be
"Please follow me." The nice-looking nurse said to him kindly. "Don't worry, we'll check you out. We're gonna have to ask you a few questions. Are you going to be okay?"
"And I don't know..." Clint answers. "It's not that easy. For us, I mean..." He takes a deep breath and gulps down a swig of his beer. "I mean, in other circumstances, yeah, but... I'm not sure anymore if we're really gonna take that step or not."
"No!" Steve blurted out, a little panicky. The prospect of pushing Tony out his life felt suddenly so real and unbearable.
Steve felt his heart leap again. "Me too." He said after a moment. He pulled Tony closer to him and ran a hand up and down his spine. Tony's body shivered from head to toe. Steve grabbed his waist possessively and grazed the soft skin of his neck with his teeth. The omega laughed, wiggling in his arms. He pulled away, hands strong on Steve's shoulders, and stepped back. "Stop it! You're gonna ruin the effect of my confusers." His eyes were so shiny, almost hazy. "You scent is so strong," he said with a serious tone. "You're driving me crazy."
Tony stood in front of that painting for almost twenty minutes. Not a word came out from his mouth. Not even a sigh. He just stared and sometimes he squeezed Steve's hand. At some point he dropped it, just to take it again a few minutes later. Meanwhile, Steve's heart was racing in his chest.
The two omegas are so close to each other that their scents have started to mingle to the point it's become almost impossible to distinguish one from the other. Lately Tony feels like he doesn't really know their scents anymore. It's just a whiff of seductive omega smell. Today though he can smell Steve. Only Steve. The scent so vivid and intoxicating, just like the first time they met.
"You don't fucking care, do you?" He heard the breathless whispered painfully choked out of his boyfriend's mouth. The hurt is Steve's voice was agonizing. "You don't care about anything." Oh he was way past caring by now. "I don't get you."
Steve snorted and mouthed a silent "I love you" before turning back to the counter and taking off his coat, scarf and beanie. Tony did the same, adding his sweater onto the pile of clothes he had thrown on the armchair next to him.
knows. Only Steve... Yet, Clint understands. He understands him better than Steve does sometimes. He knows Clint will never judge him, that's what he likes about him, but he can't help seeing the pain in Steve's eyes and knows how fucked up he is.
He quickly forgot about it though. Chatting with Tony was easy and natural and the heat in his stomach was quickly pushed aside in the back of his head, just like the beating of his heart. Just like his unpleasant experience in the restrooms earlier. All forgotten, until Tony mentioned it casually again.
And he should get back to work now anyway. After all, Tony had a glorious destiny to fulfill, hadn't he?
"There's something I need to tell you though." Steve muttered into his mouth and put his two hands on Tony's shoulder determinedly, holding him at a relieving distance. "I—" He started hesitatingly. "I might... not be omega after all."
Tony Stark was a genius, that secret hadn't remained a secret for long in their school. He didn't need Steve to get a B-, even if English wasn't his forte. Steve shrugged it off. Maybe Tony needed a friend. Or maybe he thought Steve needed one, which he kind of did actually. Whatever his reasons were, Steve could go along with it. He could do with an extra friend. And he could deal with another rumor about him going at it with yet another alpha. It wouldn't make much difference.
Steve smiled and shrugged, feeling his stomach unclench a little. He took his boyfriend's hand and squeezed, Tony squeezed back and they remained silent for a short moment before Steve opened his mouth again. "So..." He started, sounding nonchalant, "that Senator looked like a truly detestable person..."
to me. I'm sorry if I implied something like that, I just wanted to get a reaction out of you. I just wanted you to
Bucky was sulky the day before, maybe because he was scared or apprehensive, Steve wasn't sure. Steve had pressed his hand on his shoulder in an attempt to reassure him. It was strange how calm he felt at that moment when a year before his stomach churned with jealousy. What had changed? Steve wasn't really sure. Maybe he had.
Steve parted his lips apologetically. He felt guilty. If Tony had never come here, it probably was because of him. He would have visited the place way before if it hadn't been for Steve, knowing Tony, even if Steve had never worked there. Tony had been a fanboy way before the Avengers and Captain America became a thing. Way before they even knew each other...
Steve feels a pang in his chest, despite himself, and represses a tear from falling down his cheek. No matter how much he hasn't wanted this, now matter how much it repulsed him then—never wanted to, always hated the idea of it—it still hurt.
He pinned his neck on the table while Steve wriggled his ass, equally scared and aroused. He was breathing hard against the wood, his head was spinning with desire, his nape hurt a little. "Tony..." He whimpered, not sure if he wanted to make him stop or encourage him. He didn't have the time to ponder, because Tony spat on his ass and shoved two uncaring fingers inside. Steve moaned half with pleasure, half with pain. He tried to push himself off the table. "Ton—aaaah...."
Steve couldn't repress a laugh and felt the tears prickle at the corner of his eyes. He disentangled himself from his boyfriend and leant his forehead against his back, holding himself on his hips. "You seem to forget that T'Challa had a major insurmountable flaw," he whispered and paused for emphasis, "one that made it absolutely impossible for us to build anything sustainable."
Tony put his phone down and span around on the caster wheels of his office chair. A shudder of excitement ran throughout his body. He was ecstatic. Celebrating Steve's success... it was huge. Tony was so proud. His boyfriend was finally earning the recognition he deserved. Tony had nothing to do with it but he still saw it as a personal victory. Personal by proxy. At least, things were going great for one of them. Steve deserved it. He deserved the world.
"You fucking bunch of hypocrites!!!" Steve shouted, not looking back at them and shoving his middle finger in the air.
He felt dizzy for a moment and took a deep breath before he rang the bell. He didn't have to wait for long before the door opened and a very chipper Tony welcomed him, wearing a laid-back outfit which was something quite peculiar coming from Tony. He may have a scruffy look at school but he always dressed smartly. Steve paused for a minute, checking out the alpha from head to toe, until he noticed Tony's excessively excited smile fade slowly and felt guilty. He tried to dissimulate the blush he knew was creeping on his face and looked down at his bare feet. He was caught staring. How embarrassing! Especially when this said staring was unwelcome. Steve felt a little bad and wavered at the door, pondering apologizing or not.
The ride was fortunately short and Tony got out excitedly, jerky hands moving around like an illusionist. He was probably nervous, Steve thought. Steve was too, alcohol had helped though. He took Steve's hand and hurried them inside, talking non-stop. Steve felt out of it, with the constant buzzing in his head. It was as if everything was happening in slow-motion. He could only see his boyfriend's mouth opening and closing excitedly and the overly energetic movements of his hands. Part of him was still thinking about taking his clothes off, another part just wanted to kiss him, to shut him up.
Clint leans against him and pats his shoulder again, pressing it with a strong hand. His face is very close and he almost whispers in his ear. His voice is hoarse. "Yeah but... you'd like to be Mrs Rogers, right?"
It is something he has been wanting to do for a long time. Something he loves. Something Steve rarely lets him do, because Steve prefers doing it himself. James loves when Tony looks up at him and sucks his cock however. His whole demeanor changes. He becomes confident and dares run strong and powerful fingers through Tony's hair as he swallow his erect shaft down his throat. Slick flows down his toned thighs, smelling amazing. Tony pulls his mouth away to lick it up and makes James shake like a leaf.
Tony startled and turned around, facing Steve. He brushed a hand down Steve's cheek. "I'm not him." He whispered, staring into Steve's eyes trying to convince himself more than convince Steve, and then his expression changed, growing insecure.
"I've had sex but, when I look back...I could have waited a little." The omega admitted, voice a little insecure. "I'm not that experienced, you know."
He's barely out of the shower when he can hear the car pull off in the driveway. He gives his head a short stroke, tossing the towel aside, and jumps into the first shirt and shorts he can find. The fabric is sticking to his wet skin and his hair is still dripping but he doesn't care. He rushed out of his bedroom and runs down the stairs. When he opens the door, Tony startles, a surprised glimpse of confusion flashes through his eyes, his fingers are still on the doorbell. He quickly recovers his senses though and a huge grin spreads on his face.
They let the silence linger, appeased, until Steve broke it. "I'll come here..." He started. "More often." And rubbed his thumb down his boyfriend cheek.
Steve chuckled, despite himself. "You do realize the alpha I've been into for all those months is you, right?" He whispered in Tony's neck, arms curled around his waist. Tony shivered. His body was a furnace in Steve's arms. "I've been rejecting you, haven't I?"
The aftermath of it really crushed him down however. He felt something cold and distressing spreading up in his chest, his good old friend anxiety creeping up and overwhelming. For a moment he stared dejectedly at his screen, distraught, unable to move.
He musters up the courage to look at him. Their eyes lock into each other. The alpha's are wanton, pupils blown out, glowing with fierce and carnal yearning.  His nostrils are flaring. There is a slight tremor and tension in his jaw. He can see how the alpha is struggling to fight his instincts and control his urges. He knows Tony hates that part of himself. He hates himself too in that moment. He hates their nature and the way they always fall into the same patterns, inevitably surrendering and indulging in their basic needs.
Perfect timing, Bucky thinks. He's been keeping the alpha on edge and now he's all ready for him. He couldn't have done it any better had he actually planned this.
"Sure." Tony whispered back, blowing warm air on Steve's mouth. "I'll be busy but yeah, sure, you can come." He gave Steve a little peck. "I'd be happy if you did," he added softly.
The question was nonchalant, unexpected and incongruous. It took Steve a moment to understand what Tony was talking about. He never went to high school dances. He never had anyone to go with and he didn't know how to dance anyway.
Outside the breeze was cool but refreshing and Steve took a deep breath before starting walking towards his house. He wasn't living that far maybe three or four miles. One hour walk at the most.
Steve looks sad and pinches his lips angrily. "I don't need perfect. I know you're not, but you're the one I chose. And I want you and your imperfections and I think you've wanted me with mine too. You used to at least."
want this to happen. He wanted to see Steve. "Please..." He unwillingly let escape in a shuddering breath, looking away.
He raises his head and stares into Clint's eyes. "You really think Steve'd like that?" There is half a second of puzzlement in Clint's eyes before he grins widely. Tony tries to mirror his grin and snatches the joint from his hand. He takes a long drag before handing it back to him and turns his head to blow the smoke out of his way. "Maybe we should try new things."
She pressed his arm gently. "Okay." She said softly. "I have to go. Press this button to call if you need anything." She started walking away from him but turned to him and spoke one last time. "You can change your mind about this, Gregory. About what you said. Any time. We'll be there for you, whatever you need. You can get help, you know. You're not on your own."
Steve rushed to him and grabbed him into a needy embrace. He held him tight until Tony finally relaxed into his arms, let his head drop on his shoulder and grabbed his hips, curling his fingers in his shirt. Steve's hand was stroking his back comfortingly. He buried his face in the crook of his neck and inhaled his smell with delectation. He hadn't realized how much he had missed his boyfriend. How he had missed him! The embrace was a sweet relief and neither of them wanted to let go.
Bucky, who was reclining against the trunk, stopped eating, ham and pickles sandwich hanging in the air, half-way to his mouth. He stared up at him with a dubious expression, frowning a little. Sam sat crossed-legged on the lawn, half in the sun, half in the shade. He almost strangled himself on his sandwich. Clint sniggered, sounding surprised.
Besides, he had noticed two other men leering, leaning against the opposite wall and pawing their crotch. He didn't do much of an effort to make them act on it. Soon, he had two cocks in his mouth and really started to feel it. The drugs was perfectly effective at this point and he was fully hard, moaning eagerly every time one of them attempted to be a little rougher, like he should. He was finally free from unwanted disturbing thoughts.
Steve chuckled at first, then sighed desperately as he noticed that Sam didn't look like he was joking. "Kill me first." He exclaimed and was met with a slack-jawed Sam who seemed lost for words. "I'm being serious." Steve insisted. "Being short and sickly is already humiliating enough as it is."
Steve raised his head and looked at him. He was walking gracefully to the table with two smoking mugs in his hands. He couldn't help staring again. His eyes followed the movements of his strong legs and lingered over his bare feet, captivated. They were long and twisted, not really pretty to be honest, but he was obsessed. He raised his eyes again, following the curve of Tony's hip and the way they slightly swayed in his hurried pace. The moment maybe lasted a couple of seconds but it felt an eternity and Steve startled when Tony put a smoking cup of what looked like his favorite latte next to him.
He turns to him questioningly. Clint smiles gently at him and shakes his head. "You keep staring at your boyfriend like you're carrying the world's misery on your shoulders, as if you guys had already broken up." Tony opens wide eyes. Was he that obvious? "Stop thinking that you're not enough, Tony. Because I can tell you that this guy over there," he points at the four men chatting livelily in the living room with his own drink in hand, "swears only by you."
"Why do you keep tormenting me?" Steve complained. "What did I do to deserve that kind of embarrassment?"
Steve felt a bead of sweat trickling down his spine. Heart still racing, he reached a trembling hand to get it back and nodded shyly. Tony smiled at him so tenderly Steve almost melted.
How to be omega, like he's always been but refused to before the war. Tony titillated—consciously or unconsciously... Who fucking knows?—and excited every particle of his body to the point he lost control.
He wasn't left on his own for long. The doctor entered the room quickly. She was blond, in her fifties, glasses perched on the tip of her nose, a stern, focused, scrutinizing look. She looked at him dubiously and seemed to be able see through him instantly. It made him a little uncomfortable. He wriggled on the hospital bed, even though it wasn't the first time he faced disapproving judgement for his promiscuous sexual behavior. As said before, Tony wasn't a rookie. He had been in the game for a while.
It's only when they're hesitating over dessert that Steve finally breaches the subject and it comes out of nowhere, at the most unexpected moment.
Clint was as much hypnotized. "And we were fucking brilliant that night, weren't we?" Bucky nodded with a huge grin. "We worked so well together on stage." Clint carried on. "You can't deny it!"
He breathed in and took a look at the outstanding view to find some courage before opening his mouth to speak. "Are you alright, babe?" He attempted hesitatingly.
His words were stuck in his throat and he was ashamed. He had no place to feel the way he felt but he couldn't help the lump growing in his throat. "So how did that happen?" He croaked out. "When did you two become a thing?"
Steve heard a noise. There seemed to be a commotion outside.  Everyone was gathering at the entrance.
They all sighed desperately and rolled their eyes. Clint shrugged again and ate his chicken in silence, being ostensibly gross while doing so.
Steve doesn't remember well how it happened but he remembers that he found himself pushing Bucky against the wall and started grinding his hard-on against him hips. Bucky curled his arms around him and kissed him softly. Steve made the kiss eager and brutal, grabbing Bucky's hips. The Omega hanged onto his shoulders and wrapped his strong legs around his waist. Steve carried him to his bedroom, hands under his butt, clutching his asscheeks.
The alpha hums is delight and relaxes under his touch. His arm idly surrounds his shoulders and keeps him close. He lets himself go into the comfort of his purring, reclines his head on the headrest and closes his eyes.
Despite everything, Steve had grown to enjoy those session and, even if he wouldn't admit it, they had grown closer. He would even go as far as saying they were friends—sort of—and had had long and complex conversation of the purpose of life. Expected conversation topics for two normal teenagers stuck together for long hours of silence and effervescent with hormones, right? Right.
Steve felt his heart skip in his chest. "No, no, no. He's not... and it's more like, the other way around?"
Steve froze and turned to him questioningly but Sam had already opened his door and rushed out to open Steve's and offer him a hand. Steve glared at him. "Seriously?"
Steve was stretched open and his boyfriend's cock slid in too easily until he was buried to the hilt. Steve let out a long shivering moan and tightened his grip around Tony. Tony grabbed his waist to settle them in the best position and started pounding into him slow and hard and deep, gripping his waist firmly and kissing him, just like Steve had asked. It was so fucking good and hot and exhilarating and Steve was barely conscious. It didn't take long for Tony to bring him to the edge. He fucked him hard and relentlessly, breathing heavily into Steve's mouth until Steve couldn't take it anymore and buried his face into the hot and sweaty tense muscles of Tony's neck, whimpering helplessly. His boyfriend's body was trembling into his embrace and he groaned and gasped in pleasure and Steve was so fucking close.
Steve feels the tears running down his cheeks. "Please, Tony," he begs, "Alpha," he then corrects, imitating Bucky's suave ways. "Stop playing games with me, with us. I want you. All of you."
Tony abruptly turned to him and frowned at him. "Whatever, Steve." He snapped. "You're not my fucking dad. Don't patronize me!" Steve looked away and pouted, rolling his tongue on his teeth. "You gonna join me or what?" Tony finally asked.
Tony felt his heart waver, all sorts of unwanted feelings roiling inside. Disappointment, anger, fear,
She growls and shows her teeth unintentionally. She needs to leave, immediately. She swivels on her feet and strides out of the room, grabbing Clint by the shirt. He stumbled back and let himself be dragged away, knowing better than trying to protest right now.
Something like melancholic fondness flashed in Howard's eyes and unsettled Tony for a moment. He had rarely seen that kind of expression on his father's face before. For a moment, Howard's smile was almost gentle. Howard tilted his head on the side and gestured to Tony to come. "Come here, son." He said softly. Tony complied, for lack of a better option. He felt wary though, Howard wasn't inclined to showing affection freely.
Steve rolled his eyes exasperatedly, hands on his hips, but really wanted to laugh again. "You won't taste my ass on those, though. Never used them..."
"Sure!" Clint nods, while busying himself with more food. "Go easy on it though, we don't want you to wind up in the gutters in your own vomit."
"Did you pass out?" He whispered softly, smile spread with on his lips and everything around him blurry.
Steve instantly drops on his knees and whimpers in want. He still tries to look at the alpha but his silent glares and the nod he gives into Bucky's direction tells the omega exactly what he's supposed to do and he crawls between the alpha's legs, right next to him.
It's only three'o clock in the morning and no omega has trespassed in her den but somehow she can smell the remnants of their exquisitely lewd scents lingering on her clothes. It steams her up. She's on fire.
Natasha has been a witness of the Stony drama for years. She knew it was a matter of time before Steve came back. She also knows it's just a matter of time before things settles back to their places.
"I can't believe he asked you for a blowjob. That ass! You should talk to the board. You could press charges you know?"
"I've missed you." Steve said, breaking the peaceful silence between them. The sun was high in the sky now, illuminating Tony's face, and the soft breeze caressed his face, running through his scruffy brown hair with golden lights. He seemed an angel in a blissful cloud of ethereal smoke.
Steve chuckled. "You know what my friend Clint told me?" He said with a forced smile. "That I should be happy because I was special."
There is a growing lump of guilt and regret swelling in his chest and he can't breathe anymore. He lets out a shivering breath and feels tear prickle at the corners of his eyes.
Ten minutes later, they were at the school's hangout, staring silently into each other's eyes. There was something like concern lingering in the dark of Tony's eyes and Steve hated it.
Tony nodded and shrugged, his usual response when he didn't know what to say. Steve stood up as well, overly protective, and followed them. Tony's heart was pounding. What was he gonna say now? He had but a really vague and distorted memory of what had happened to him from the moment he left Obie's car.
"So you're alpha, after all..." He finally said, voice a little out of it. "All that worry for nothing." Steve chuckled softly. He felt a little bad about it.
Tony didn't say anything but the lecture had left a wavering feeling at the bottom of his stomach. He was given a prescription for the pain and a list of recommendations to help the healing, was forbidden to give oral sex for two weeks at least, was asked to double his prescription of preventive HIV treatment, was reminded that AIDS was not the only potential STD he could catch with his reckless behavior—as if Tony didn't already know that, was thoroughly reminded to wear protection if he were to engage in any kind of sexual activities with his boyfriend in the next two fortnights and finally, he was given a bunch of informative leaflets and cards for support groups, all kinds of paperwork addressed to rape victims, LGBTQ+ people, and a couple for drug addicts too, and he felt like vomiting again, although he had nothing left in his stomach. Why did everyone think he was raped? Tony
"But this is exactly what I'm saying..." Tony continued. "We're addicted to each other. It's not healthy."
They couldn't go on like this. Someone needed to root out the evil. They really needed to talk. But he had the horrible, horrible feeling that he had missed his chances with him.
"Fine. But I'll give you a beer this time." Clint turns around and bents down to grab a couple of beers from the fridge. Tony stares at his ass and at the tattoo that sneaks out of his pants. He doesn't have time to leer though because Clint straightens up in a jerk and hands him a beer before opening one for himself. Then he checks the oven and stands up again, leaning against the counter next to Tony but less close than before.
The men exulted, encouraged by Tony's responsiveness—or lack of, he wasn't really sure, things were too foggy. They started to choke him. Tony's eyes flared open and he gasped and wheezed for air. The rush of adrenaline was blinding and deafening. His head was spinning and his consciousness ebbed slowly away, until everything went dark. Tony hoped he would not wake up. It was a really nice way to die, he thought. Die while being fucked.
Tony felt the rage shake himself to the core. The one he was too fucking scared to let out. He narrowed his eyes and glared at his boyfriend, trying to control himself. Steve wanted answers but he couldn't handle the truth so Tony told him what he wanted to hear. That was something he had had the opportunity to practice for a long long time. Tony could lie through his teeth unashamedly. He knew exactly what to say to stab right where it hurt.
Tony's expression softened and a gentle hand surreptitiously slid around Steve's neck. It was hot and soft, though the fingers were a little rough. He smiled tenderly. "You look confused." He whispered, hoarsely.
Steve sighed annoyedly against his shoulder blade and disentangled his arms. He let himself fall onto his back and closed his eyes not to see the tent forming under the covers that painfully reminded him how hard he was. "Fine..." He grumbled, making sure his deeply frustrated dissatisfaction got through the long disappointed sigh he let out as he did so.
Clint looks perplex maybe, though she is too far gone to analyze his feelings right now. "Errr. Yeah. Okay." He mumbles. "You sure?"
"'kay" He shrugged and followed Steve up the stairs to his bedroom. Steve was glad he had taken the time to clean up last night's mess before calling Tony. It was quite embarrassing as it was but Tony didn't pay attention. He was his usual, non-judging—never judging—self and looked around with the same fascination he looked at everything Steve did, without paying attention to the dull decor.
At that precise moment Tony and Natasha came back, hugging each other, laughing and smiling at each other, still in the middle of their idle conversation. Steve hated the looks they shared but tried to ignore it. Tony walked to him nonchalantly and kissed him on the temple before going back to his seat. People had moved around but they were still sitting across from each other.
Overall, it almost made his life easier in a way. He couldn't even say it bothered him the rumors going on about him being the football team's bitch or those about the weird foursome relationship he had with Buck, Sam and Clint. The thought was kind of disturbing but, to be completely honest, they had been thinking that before as well, just not out loud.
The boy's smile died down quickly but for all that he didn't lose his composure and didn't seem to spare any second of his attention to the flourishing gossip around him, even though he must have known everyone was talking about him. He just pouted contemptuously and quietly paced to his designated table, sending provocative smirks here and there at other students' comments. When they stared too much he stared right back at them until they looked away ashamedly. Steve stared too but he wasn't met with a glare from the brunet, that was the perks of being invisible he guessed. It happened a lot. People didn't notice him. He was too small, too average, too insignificant. It had its advantages sometimes, like today. He could ogle at the boy to his heart's content. And he happened to be the perfect distraction Steve needed today.
Tony's entire body shuddered when the man left. He was more shaken than ever and felt like retching. A mix of anger, aversion, confusion and forbidden desire pooling in his stomach. He needed to throw up. He needed to hit something. Everything. For a moment, he saw himself destroying every single thing that happened to be in his office. He did nothing of the sort however, too conscientious, too...
Stark jerked his head in his direction as if he could feel Steve's burning stare in the middle of the crowd. Their eyes met for a split second. Steve felt a jolt of electrify running down his spine. The dark glint in Stark's eyes quickly changed from surprised to amused. He smiled softly. His smiles were always soft, Steve had noticed, when they were addressed to him, while they were acid, arrogant smirks with everybody else. Must be some misplaced gratitude because Steve had helped him on his first day, or perhaps it was another side-effect of Steve's short, non-threatening figure. Another reason why Steve hated that guy, he didn't need condescending sympathy, especially not from a guy two years younger than him. They didn't even speak to each other anyway.
Steve went slow and deep, playing with the toy from time to time, waiting for Tony to adjust to the double intrusion until he lost patience and started fucking fast and hard into him.
Tony laughed and threw his head back, eyes playfully glittering in the dark. "We're being really bad friends, though." Tony added afterwards, smile huge and undying on his face. He was playing with Steve's hands. "Tonight was about Natasha and we hijacked her evening."
Steve grits his teeth. He suddenly feels spiteful to the other omega. "I don't know, you tell me!" He spits. "You're the only one who's had the opportunity to share a heat with Alpha. How blown was your mind then?"
He growls from the depth of his throat and glares at the omega who keeps standing, frozen on his feet, soaking his pants. "Come here." He says with his most gentle voice, tilting his head on the side encouragingly.
Tony smiled but didn't answer and the silence lingered, although not heavy. He sipped his coffee slowly, blowing the smoke away.
he said with a soft voice and then he stared right back into Steve's eyes. "but I was serious about you. Right from the start."
Yes. Water. He's on it, like right now. And food too. And a warm blanket? Of course. On it! Are they crazy? Do they really want an extra blanket? Tony's burning up and his mind is confused. His feelings are going haywire and his thoughts are in shambles. He doesn't know if what he feels or wants are his own desires or his omegas. Which doesn't really matter either way because now, it's all the same. It must be his omegas because they need him but they don't seem to be able to speak their mind at the moment. Neither can he... That mind-reading is totally terrifying but rather convenient at the moment. Why did no-one teach Tony that before? Why doesn't
"Will those guys join?" He asked while glancing at the two men—that may or may not be dark-haired guy's buddies—dazedly.
Tony's not wearing any scent-confusers today, he notices. He leans into him, instinctively, and a whiff of the blissful omega sweetness softly assaults his nostrils. Steve's instincts take over and he unwillingly lets out a deep and lecherous growl that shakes his entire body. His nostrils flares, his lips instinctively tense up, showing his teeth and he growls again, trying to control his urges this time. His hand runs up his nape, entangling his fingers into his hair while he buries his head against Tony's shoulders, grazing his teeth against the red and puffy omega gland right there, pulsating for him. He sniffs and licks and nibbles at the skin, scraping his teeth on the gland.
"What for? I don't need rent money. You pay for all my expenses! I basically save up my entire salary each month. Which is really decent, by the way, babe. For people who live in the real world..."
Except he couldn't sleep. Something tingled in his chest, a hint at something, something that stirred anguish in the deepest part of Steve's heart. The scene hadn't been unusual, although peculiar, but there was something a little off about it. And Steve realized he missed his boyfriend, tremendously. And since he couldn't sleep anymore, he jumped out of bed, picked up a button-down sweater in Tony's closet, one that was too big for him but smelt like Tony, and he slid the glass-pane leading to the terrace open.
He was just making coffee... He was exhausted, worn out, at the death's door. He's too fucking old for this. Steve had him knot him three times already this morning. The fact that he hasn't had a heart attack yet is a miracle.
Sure, he used to love it. His favorite subject, after art. He loved reading, he loved understanding the hidden meaning behind his favorite books, he loved talking about it. English class used to be a haven of peace for him.
Clint takes out whatever smells awesome from the oven and lays them on a huge plate. Tony follows him to the living room where the four other guys are still chatting and drinking. The level of alcohol has risen up since Tony left. They're
"I want to live together, I... I just—" Steve choked out, stumbling on his words. "Your place is amazing." He finally said, searching Tony's eyes with his own. Tony stared back, impassive, uncaring, a haughty pout on his lips. "The studio is... It's
"I live here now. What use do I have for an empty apartment? I don't need it so it might as well benefit people who do. Haven't you heard of the housing crisis?"
I fell for your crap..." He choked out in a shuddering breath, feeling outraged. "You totally played me with your 'I don't wanna be on my own' bullshit. You're a fraud. You
"Sure." Steve said and smiled back while he took a sip of his latte. Somehow it felt good being there with Tony. It felt
Tony stopped in his tracks and stared at the food on display with delightful amazement. He turned to Steve with an awed face and a smile filled with silent gratitude. "Wow." He said, eyes back on the food. "This looks amazing." He added while looking at Steve sideways, a skeptical look on his face. "Did you really do all of this?"
pass out, and ah fuck how amazing it feels to have his knot deep buried inside the omega's throat and making them lose consciousness.
He grabbed his hands and swirled him around to hold both his wrists in one hand, pinning them behind his back. With his other hand he grabbed his nape possessively—not squeezing, not hurting, just holding him—and he walked them to their bedroom. He brutally pushed him onto the bed, on his knees, without ever hurting him, and pressed on his nape softly to anchor him to the bed. Still holding his hands behind his back in a strong grip, he adjusted Steve's position on the bed with a gentle hand on his waist and thrust into him.
Steve gasped and parted his lips. He barely nodded but his hold on Tony was strong and his determination unwavering and Tony's lips were on him faster than he could get prepared for. Hot and soft and burning against his mouth.
Tony is not. Not at this precise moment. He feels like retching. But he's not going to let this take away his fun. He leans into Clint's embrace and drops his head in the crook of his neck. Clint catches his face with his warm hand and nuzzles against him. He's still holding the joint in between his fingers and they smell like pot. Tony doesn't care. "I'm sorry, Tony. I didn't mean it like that. You know I'll never judge you, right?"
Oh so naturally, the alpha finds himself buried balls-deep into Steve again, like pulled inside by some sort of force or magical power. They fit together, slot into one another, so perfectly it's almost eerie and so
Obie said while his grin spread evilly on his face. "Never forget it," he added. "You'll always be mine."
Steve felt a sudden surge of love for his boyfriend. He needed the contact so he stood up and skirted around the table to join him. He gave him a passionate kiss that unsettled Tony a little but he quickly recovered and kissed him back and Steve really didn't care that everyone else was staring at them.
He yanks his hand away as if he'd been burnt and turns on his back. He suddenly feels a lump constricting his throat and the need to cry. He's shuddering.
"Planning to leave early, are you?" Obie said with his deep low voice. "That would be extremely rude to our guests, Tony boy. Don't you think?" His fingers gently brushed the bottom of his chin as he spoke, drawing a gasp out of Tony, which made him smirk. "Still so responsive... How cute!"
"I'm sorry that I never told you about Loki." He said. "I wasn't trying to hide this from you. It just never came up that's all. We did fool around a few times, yeah, but it wasn't as serious as the others said it was. Not for me, anyway. I liked him but mostly because he reminded me of you."
He opens an eye and turns his head on the right, looking for the origin of the amazing smell that pervades in the room. The smell of happiness. On his right, resting on his shoulder, he can see a tuft of blond hair. Steve is purring against him, his features relaxed and blissed. Someone stirs and hums against his left shoulder, and nuzzles into his neck. The chestnut hair tickles him. James is purring on his left side. His smile is blissed and satisfied. Tony has never seen him smile like that before. He falls back into a deep slumber. He will need more sleep to overcome this overwhelming feeling of happiness he feels inside.
Tony looked at him confusedly. "I've already thrown up today." He mumbled, or rather stuttered. He was almost sure of that, although he didn't remember when.
He knew about his habits, about his tastes. He knew a lot of things: they had spent weeks living together. But it had always been at Steve's place. Or in his parents' house which had never been a home to Tony.
Nothing had changed. It looked exactly like it had been when Steve left it some months ago. Everything was in its place, where Steve had put it, even though someone had been cleaning the place regularly. It felt weird to come back here. It was his place but it didn't feel home. Not anymore.
Tony has overdone it and bought absolutely everything they need and more to give Steve a good time. He's been gentle and patient and perfect. Steve really has a good time, even though the feelings and sensations are foreign and unexpected. Not at all what he has imagined. Not even close to what Tony seemed to feel. But amazing all the same.
Pepper didn't sigh. She remained silent and Tony heard her swallow into the phone before she spoke again. "Well I'm sorry to tell you that..." She said with a hoarse sympathetic voice. "But you brought this upon yourself, Tony."
Tony startled. There was something very wrong with that sentence and that particular voice talking to him at this precise moment at this very place. Since when did his dad move his lazy ass down here to see what Tony was up to for himself?
"There you are." Tony said while walking in his direction. There was so much tenderness in his voice it hurt.
Tony turned his head away from the window and stared at him confusedly, eyes wide-open, his mouth curled into a pout. A sexy pout Steve would say, but he pushed that thought far away.
Steve looked at him confusedly, apologetically, wondering what was it he said that was so offensive for, for all he knew, it was meant as a compliment more than anything. Tony averted his eyes and his hands on Steve were cold and shaking and he let them slide down his hips before letting go of him. Steve wanted to brush his hand around his neck, cup his jaw and caress his cheek with his thumb. He wanted to touch him, he
She took her drink with her and walked away. "m gonna see what he's doing." She said as she headed for the bathroom. Steve looked outside the window and saw a glimpse of him, still on the phone. He was tempted to join him too but he wanted to hear Bucky and Clint's story. He had never heard Clint's side of it after all. Even after all those years.
anyway. He dug his own grave and he's not proud of it either but not because of the sex thing, nor because he might have died that night. Because of Steve. Because it
Dinner was perfect. Everyone had been so respectful of their privacy. Steve wondered what had scared him so much before. Tony kept talking and smiling and sometimes he stopped, took Steve's hand and entangled their fingers together, and stared into his eyes with a happy and loving gaze. Steve realized they hadn't been on a real date for months. They were both so busy and time just flew by. He missed it.
Tony turns his head to him and stares intensely into his eyes. He searches something in there for a moment, keeping silent.
The warm water soothed his growing anxiety and helped him pull his head together. He touched his body, the places Tony had pressed. It still hurt a little. Steve didn't remember that sex with Tony had ever been so rough, not even at the beginning. He might bruise and didn't like the prospect. They needed to talk. He went to their bedroom and waited for his boyfriend to get out of the shower. He stayed in there for about forty five minutes. Steve's heart was pounding in his chest. When Tony finally got out, wearing a T-shirt and a pair of shorts, he barely looked at him and headed straight back to the living room, to serve himself another drink. Steve felt his rage boil up inside and strode behind him angrily, fists clenched and teeth gritting.
Tony bit his bottom lip one last time, letting his teeth slide softly and seductively on his swollen skin, hazy eyes following Steve regretfully while he climbed down his lap and skirted around the couch to start with the huge bookcase fixed to wall.
"I'm free." Steve felt something fluttering in his stomach. Tony's voice was hoarse and a little tired. "I'm in front of your house."
Tony shrugged. "Once or twice. He was good friends with Obi—adiah Stane." He explained and looked like he regretted it instantly. He shivered again, very inconspicuously, Steve wasn't fooled though. "My world is a small world, Steve." He added with a raspy voice. "We always hang around the same people."
The atmosphere inside was a little oppressive, to Steve at least. It wasn't really different from school actually. The same buildings. The same people.  The same uninteresting conversations. The same stupid teenage behavior. Not really his scene. Fortunately Sam and Bucky were there and as soon as Steve had scanned the room he was handed a non-alcoholic drink and dragged on one corner where his friends had settled down.
They have been dating for months now but strangely, they haven't had much opportunity for sex. It took them almost three months to finally do it. It was hard to find a moment and Tony kept insisting that they waited for Steve to be ready. Steve
Thank you so much to the few of you who took the time to leave encouraging comments or kudos. I am forever grateful! :)
It was Steve's threatening finger that snapped him out of it. "I want fucking answers, Tony." He growled.
"Good to know..." Steve whispered, looking out the window again. He still felt uncomfortable with the casual mention of Stane and the awkward distance between them that seemed to grow.
Tony started panting and arched his back, pushing his ass up to meet Steve's thrusts, seeking release. Steve chuckled. "I thought you didn't like shoving rigid plastic things up your ass." He rasped much more hoarsely he would have thought. He was starting to get hard again while Tony's perfect body undulated sensually under him, at his mercy.
"No, I don't..." Steve whispered reluctantly, averting his eyes. "Seriously, though." He asked, sounding calmer. "What are you doing here?"
Steve's breathing hitched and accelerated. He could feel his heart pounding hard in his chest. "He wasn't
Clint puts down the plate of food and is welcomed with cheering and whistling but he remains modest about it. He just leans down to kiss his husband on the forehead and the latter answers with an innocent, though affectionate, caress on his hip before demanding a languorous kiss that Clint gives him happily.
"You mean that time you broke into my apartment and hijacked it. How could I forget that?" Steve answered amusedly.
Bucky's hand was warm and comforting on his shoulder. "You'll get used to it." He said with a soft voice. "At the end of the day, it doesn't change much." Steve glanced at the three of them sidelong. They were all silent for a moment but the awkwardness was gone.
He was losing Steve. If not today then soon. How could he not? Steve gave him everything and he couldn't give anything back. He kept pushing him away. How long until Steve gave up on him like Pepper had? Steve would be much better off without him anyway. Steve deserved so much better than a disappointment like him. He was a mess.
Steve startled and felt a blush heating his cheeks. He looked away, embarrassed, and shrugged. "What?"
Tony giggled, laughing with his whole body. Handsome and innocent. Then his features softened and he straightened up, staring intently, unsettlingly serious, into his eyes. He finished his glass of water and put it on the bookcase by the wall. "Not all of it was a lie, though." He said croakily. "I really didn't want to be alone then. I wasn't as fine as I pretended to be, you know? All those months... When I had to face the aftermath of my parents' deaths, when I had to face Obie..." His voice faltered, broken at the edges, and he looked away again. "On my own..." He took a deep breath and looked outside the window again, lost in his thoughts. "I could barely hold my head out of the water..." He whispered. "It was a good thing that I had the company to keep afloat then, I don't know how I would have made it otherwise."
Steve startled and his pencil flew across the table and landed noisily on the hard floor. He gasped in surprise and his eyes traveled around the classroom, from Tony Stark's neck to Mr Fury's glaring stare.
It's Bucky who kissed him first. They were watching a movie on their couch. Felicia was finally asleep. As soon as Bucky came back from the room he shared with his daughter, Steve pulled him by the hand and yanked him down on the couch next to him. Bucky startled and they both burst out laughing. They sat very close, rubbing their warm scents on each other. Bucky was hunched up, like he often was in this century. Steve had snuggled closer and brushed his knuckles on the Omega's knee. The slight touches turned into caresses and Steve was sliding up his thigh, fondling his hips and his waist. Bucky had turned his head to him and snuggled into his neck, blowing warm air against his sensitive skin, making him gasp and shiver. His fingers, soft and warm, reached Steve's bonding gland and he brush his thumb on it, sending jolts of electricity through his skin and down his spine. Steve gasped and Bucky nudged on his chin, turning his face slowly. Their mouths touched, drawn to one another like magnets.
‘Get Clint and Scott here within two hours,’ she cuts off Rhodes, ‘and everyone else be ready to move out at twenty hundred.’
Before Ross can say anything else he storms out the door, Vision behind him, and they make their way back to the jet. Luckily the others are already there when they arrive and Natasha has already started firing up the engines.
Peter pauses as Wade turns back to the bar and orders a beer from Weasel. Then he takes a deep breath. ‘Is it something to do with the Weapon-X programme?’
Wanda sighs and uses her powers to bring Mantis’ cookies over to join hers and puts them safely out of harms way in a cupboard. ‘Now that we know the cookies are safe? There’s a saying on Earth: if you can’t beat them, join them.’
‘Well, at least I now know I have to make sure the trousers on both of their suits can withstand being tackled by the other so we don’t have any splits on the battlefield,’ Tony muses. ‘Oh and Sam you owe Nat twenty bucks.’
But Steve’s favourite thing about the training room is really rather simple. Ever since he’d met Bucky back when they were snot-nosed kids running around the Brooklyn back streets – ok so Bucky had been running and Steve had been wheezing along behind him – he’d always wished he could keep up with the brunette. All he’d ever wanted was to make him proud in a fight, and not have to be picked up and dusted off from the floor. Now he’s able to hold his own against the other man. He’s even bested him a couple of times.
Loki shakes his head. ‘Not entirely; for one I didn’t know I could take on my frost giant form without the Casket, now that I have spent some time in the form I feel I may be able to take it at will. For another I can cause harm to others when I am in it and I’d rather not be giving frost bite to every person who touches me. Until I am better able to control it I think it best I return to the form I am more comfortable in. Besides this is how everyone knows me, and it will stop the annoying nicknames from Stark.’
‘Then get your non-green ass down to dinner. You two,’ he points at Peter and Shuri, ‘no arguing either.’
Thor knows he can’t win this fight. The Titan is too strong. But he’s not going to give up and roll over like a coward. So he struggles to hold Stormbreaker away from his chest and snarls at his enemy above him. The blade is just about to pierce his armour when something smacks into the side of Thanos’ head, knocking him off balance, and then flies back the way it came, hitting him on the other side of the head as it does.
‘Where’s your bag, Parker?’ Flash’s voice breaks through his happy fog. ‘Or you trying to make us think you’ve got actual proper rooms up at the facility rather than just a bunk like the rest of the staff?’
The group heads to Norway; Wanda and Vision have an accident during training; and Natasha finds some strength from those around her.
‘I thought you could do with a Christmas present a little early,’ Tony says, fidgeting for what he thinks is the first time Peter’s ever seen.
‘Them on their wedding day,’ he huffs a laugh and turns to Steve, ‘bet Dad looks more how you remember him here.’ He offers the photo to Steve.
‘What are you playing at Hammer?’ she demands. ‘And what the hell have you done to Tony?’ Her friend is kneeling between two guards, each of whom have a gun aiming at his head, and he’s holding his chest, his face twisted in a grimace of pain.
‘Give it a bit of a run and I’ll pull you up,’ the blond tells him, reaching down a little but nowhere near far enough for where Peter is going to end up.
Steve cuts off Tony’s rambling with a kiss, not breaking away fully until the genius is relaxed once more in his arms. It also gives him the opportunity to think.
Peter needs some persuasion to stay behind from the mission. Bucky and Natasha get the truth about Wade's suspicions out of him.
If possible Rumlow’s eyes light up even more. ‘We’d be more than happy to accommodate, Mister Stark, we can have the whole squad ready to-’
A/N: Hi everyone. I am so so sorry I am late with posting this week, I'm afraid I have no excuse except that the jobs I had planned to do at the weekend all took far longer than I expected and it was Sunday evening before I realised where the time had gone!
‘Thor if you continue that thought I shall turn you into a toad again,’ Loki points a menacing finger at his brother.
‘Guys!’ Peter snaps, cursing as soldiers appear in front of them, he pushes them towards another flight of stairs and urges them up. ‘Not the time! I need to find somewhere to suit up and help Mr Stark.’
Peter really wishes someone could get the man to shut up for once. Matt’s smirk is telling him he can hear every single word, and he’s pretty sure the man wants to punch him hard enough to knock him out.
‘Aww, Peter’s in love,’ she cackles. Then calms down. ‘In all seriousness I’m happy for you,’ she smiles at him, ‘I haven’t seen you this happy talking about someone ever really. If he makes you happy then I’m happy. But I still want to meet him so he knows what’s going to happen if he hurts you.’
Stark laughs again. ‘I like you Barnes. I promise you, I’m going to get you fixed up, and then I’m going to find out why all this happened.’
He can’t look at him, because if anything this calm understanding and request for Peter to trust him enough to tell him what is wrong is worse than if he was shouting at him. Worse than when he took the suit away. But he also knows that if he tells him about Deadpool, Tony’s probably going to try and run him out of the city, if he doesn’t try to arrest him. And Peter doesn’t want to lose his friend.
‘Loki is correct, however,’ T’Challa continues, ‘his and Thor’s support went a long way to encouraging others to speak up. When other countries saw that other
‘Pepper? I need you to get onto our friends and tell them to get onto Doctor Blane. Make sure he doesn’t contact anyone alright? No it’s worse than I thought. I’m getting him under Stephen’s care. Why? Pepper get the hell down here and see for yourself! Alright, alright I'm sorry, you know I love you Pep. I know, I couldn’t survive without you. No I am very much aware of that. Pepper I need to explain to Sergeant Barnes what is going on. No I will. Yes I will be patient with Stephen. No I’m not going to annoy him. Bye Pepper!’
‘I still don’t see why you don’t just stay here tomorrow,’ Sam says as they settle down for the movie.
Natasha opens her mouth to say something when the roar of a jetpack has them looking up. Sam flies over the top of the facility and lands right in front of the gathered crowd just as the last person steps off the bus.
he tugs at the link, and feels Bucky’s muscles twitch underneath his hands as he shakes his head. He pulls Bucky into memories from the facility, times spent working together, training together, and memories of the team laughing together.
‘Rhodey, please,’ he looks at his friend, ‘I don’t have the breath to argue. So you’re all going to shut up and listen for once. Alright?’ He waits for everyone to nod, and nods in answer to Peter’s quiet request to go and stand with Wade, Steve taking his vacated seat; when he’s caught his breath again he starts speaking, looking around the assembled group. ‘Look,’ Tony sighs, ‘Loki’s right. Whether we want to be working with everyone or not, we’ve not got much of a choice; at the end of the day we’ve got the biggest bad we’ve ever faced on his way here and we’ve got to find a way to work together or half the universe is going to suffer. If saving the universe means learning to work with former enemies then fine I’ll do it. Hell if I thought it’d make a difference I’d get Hammer out of his cell and up here.’
‘Think you might want to leave now,’ Weasel suggests, ‘we don’t take kindly to people trying to poke their noses into our business.’
‘Oh no,’ Rhodes’ voice is dangerous, and Steve notices Tony shoot his friend a worried glance. ‘Tony Stark I swear if you are pulling all-nighters again I swear to God-’
‘You just going to stand over there, kid, or you actually going to get over here and do some work?’ he asks, not stopping in his punches.
‘I’m sorry, sir,’ the soldier cuts off the driver, ‘but without a pass I can’t let you through. I’ve not been given any instructions on expecting any visitors.’
‘His brain didn’t make the logical jumps it usually does, and he lashed out. And you lashed back instead of being calm like you are with everyone else.’ Bucky puts a hand on his shoulder as Steve hangs his head in defeat. ‘Steve you’re like a brother to me, but I care about Tony. If you hurt him I am going to beat some sense into you. You got that?’
‘I guessed as much,’ Tony smirks, handing one of the drinks to her and the other to the spy at her side. ‘So, Fury, I’ve just been speaking to Carol and she told me this amazing story about a certain creature called Goose and your missing eye.’
‘I’ll be back for you after two laps tops,’ he promises him, giving Steve a quick kiss before leading Bucky out onto the ice. It takes a bit of coaxing but eventually the dark haired assassin steps out onto the ice, metal hand gripping the side in a death grip.
would be the one she would send that to. Aunt Peggy said that gun saved her life more times than she could count. It should have stayed in the
It turns out it is not as easy as it sounds. In fact Loki had had several tantrums as he failed many times to create an ice extension that could withstand any amount of force. The only positive had been that, during the many tantrums, he had created blocks of ice in his anger, which they had then been able to build on until he had more control.
Then it gets proper freaky: I turn up dead and speak to Death. As in Lady Death. Oh and not only that: she proposes to me. I mean talk about out of the blue right? Not even one date!
‘Of course,’ Tony smiles at him, going over to him and pulling him into a hug. ‘I’m glad you’re alright, Lokes, you had us scared for a minute.’
‘I am inclined to believe,’ Loki says as he and Thor meet them coming in the other direction down the corridor, ‘that Thor and I have also been influential in this?’
‘Stay back for now,’ he replies as the door to the plane opens, Steve’s very familiar form stepping out just as the soldiers come into view around the side of one of the buildings. ‘Follow my lead. We can’t afford a fight.’
‘Oh really?’ Steve grins and climbs onto the bed to crouch on all fours above his boyfriend. ‘So was I imagining you enjoying it when we were chopping wood at Clint’s farm back when we faced Ultron?’
The doctor looks from the folder to Bucky and back down again, and he can see the man’s face slipping into a look that Bucky knows very well and has come to term “professional worry”. Everyone seems to wear it around him. ‘What the hell has been going on here?’
‘Deadpool’s been spotted in New York,’ out of the corner of her eye she notices Peter look up from his book.
‘Woah. Hold on a second there, kid,’ Tony smiles at him. ‘Before we talk about that I want to talk about Beck.’
‘Damn it,’ Clint curses softly. Just then he hears the sound of Tony’s suit approaching. ‘Hang on Rhodey, Tony’s coming. Maybe his suit can help get you out of this.’ He turns, mouth already open to ask for the genius’ input when he realises his mistake: it’s not Tony’s suit it’s Rhodes’.
‘Uh oh,’ he says as the alien realises what has happened and changes the arc of the swing, barely managing to dodge out of the way. Hearing screams behind him, he turns to see some civilians ducking down out of the way of the pole. ‘Steve there’s too many civilians still here. We need to take this brute somewhere else.’
Suddenly Tony’s reaction makes a little more sense. ‘So when I said about taking the suit away for practise-’
Anyway hope you enjoy these two chapters, hopefully I will get some more of the Christmas story written this weekend so I can start posting it next week.
Wanda leans against the exit to the school grounds, scanning the crowd of students leaving the halls for the youngest Avenger; she’s already messaged him to say she’d be meeting him, but knowing the trouble he’s run into on previous occasions with classmates, she’d rather be in plain sight to the rest of the student body. Just so she can get a little glowing red light on her fingers if anyone tries to pick on him on her watch.
Also I feel extra bad posting a pretty down chapter considering I'm sure we all need some cheering up after hearing Stan Lee has passed away. Such a wonderful creative mind is going to be sorely missed in this world. In a way to remember him I may end up posting another chapter tomorrow; he's given us such wonderful and rich characters to have our own creative time with, I'd like to give you guys a little more of this story that he and his characters have inspired.
The hour’s nearly up by the time Sam finds him. It’s a hunch he has based on something Tony mentioned a while ago, about making sure the hangers had protection from scanners in case they ever needed to make a quick escape. He’d made the changes before Bucky had come back in case they had to spirit the Winter Soldier away.
‘So are you Tony’s secret weapon or something? Wanda asks as they move quickly and quietly along the main corridor towards the auditorium. She’s impressed just how quietly the guy can move.
Giggling cuts off Tony’s retort and they look to the hallway to see Wanda arriving with a red faced Peter, who promptly drops his bags by the entrance and comes over to drop next to Tony on the sofa with an exaggerated: ‘You are the worst person in the world!’ at Wanda.
‘He killed them all,’ Tony clarifies, eyes still scanning the information on the tablet. ‘He’s not exactly got the most stable of minds.’
‘This…this is the place I grew up,’ Tony forces himself to release his death grip on the controls in front of him, sagging in defeat into his chair. ‘This is the family home in Long Island.’
‘I’ve not even seen half of them so I can’t comment on the truth of that statement,’ Scott adds. ‘Ow!’
‘Spidey baby!’ the excitable shout is all the warning Peter gets before a red blur tackles him and they both go tumbling over the side of the building.
‘Lower it in section eighteen,’ he repeats. ‘We need to keep them focussed on us until we are able to remove the stone from Vision.’
‘And I told you,’ Tony says, landing between Hammer and Peter, ‘that if you even touched one hair on his head I’d rip you five new ones.’
‘Peter I need you to shut up,’ Tony snaps, Sam sees him snap his mouth shut and step back to the side, eyes down. ‘I need all of you to shut up and let us finish this, because there’s way too much energy being sent around near combustible fluids.’
‘You seem to have been fine so far going to and from all those meetings,’ Rhodes points out, crossing his arms and giving Tony his
‘I need you to move, Captain,’ he tells him, turning Steve around to face the portal behind him. Sam is already dragging a limping Clint through, and Peter is half carrying Natasha.
They continue to try and hold a conversation, though it’s often interrupted with reassurances to Bucky as his torture continues. Loki’s grip on the chair steadily increases, until a small hand takes hold of one of his and squeezes it in reassurance. He smiles at Natasha in thanks, trying not to let Bucky know how much these sessions affect him in turn.
The team learn sending Bucky to get a tree is dangerous and decorating can be interesting when the whole team is involved. Peter's not so sure he likes decorating outside trees anymore.
‘Hilarious, Doc, maybe you should take up a career as a comedian,’ Tony rolls his eyes. It doesn’t take long for Dr Hill to do all the tests and he leaves them in one of the room while he goes to get the results.
He wanders through the room between some more cabinets, shoving his hands in his jeans pockets so he isn’t tempted to touch anything. He’s not entirely certain none of it would explode if he did. Or transport him to another dimension or something.
As always please do let me know what you think, and if there's anything you'd like to see in the future of the stories.
‘Yeah, and he’s going to stay with Tony for the whole trial. It’ll make sense to the media as Clint’s there to support his friend, and while we’re challenging HYDRA it means there’s another Avenger here on site,’ the soldier responds.
‘I think Rhodey’s working on him now,’ she says as Sam runs off to fetch his wings. ‘Here take a look at what we need to put up, we need as many fliers as possible.’
In answer Tony pulls him in for another kiss, running his tongue along the soldier’s lips, begging for entry. Steve complies with a small laugh and shifts further up the bed to pull Tony closer against him, the hand on the back of his head running down his neck and back to rest on his waist. For his part all Tony can do is grip the broad shoulders like Steve is his lifeline.
‘I haven’t finished my ice cream!’ Loki protests, looking between the bowl and the teenager and pouting.
Clint claps the teenager on the shoulder with an expression of mock-sympathy. ‘That explains it all.’
A/N: Hi everyone! that's all the Yule chapters done, and I'm about halfway through the Christmas Eve ones. As soon as I've finished I'll post them too, hopefully I'll be able to get them all done for a Christmas Day posting but no promises.
The man looks down at the railing and sighs before looking back at him. ‘I worked on the prosthesis myself, I know the hope was to move the company towards doing more prosthesis work so if this one isn’t successful like I thought that could have an impact on whether we can continue working on them.’
‘Apologies,’ the humanoid says. ‘I thought it safer seeing as last time I was in here there were objects being thrown. Wanda and Peter now apparently have a sibling rivalry in games to go with their sibling-like relationship.’
‘Apologies Captain, I promise to make this as simple as possible. There are not many steps and they are fairly simple, it’s just a case of remembering the order they go in. In fact,’ he looks between Tony and Steve, ‘I suggest you two swap so the Captain is on this side, Valkyrie’s line is the one where the partners will have to change places. That will be less for you to remember.’
‘He’s saved the kid’s life,’ he replies. ‘And it seems he’s been around Peter quite a bit recently. The last time I tried to do things on his behalf I ended up making things worse for him, so this time I’m going to trust his judgement.’ He fixes Peter with a strong look. ‘The
‘Tony you’ve basically adopted the kid. Everyone knows that. Hell I’m sure even all the vigilantes in New York know that Iron Man has adopted Spider-Man and that’s why he doesn’t get a lot of trouble from them. You’ll spend the majority of Christmas Day wishing he could be here with the team, and Wanda definitely will seeing as they’re brother and sister in all but blood at this point.’
Loki shakes his head, his worry bleeding through their link. ‘I worry for the Spiderling if we do not hear soon.’
‘And you wonder why we don’t want you making us feel better,’ Peter rolls his eyes at the dark haired man. ‘Honestly I don’t see what your issue is.’
‘What the hell is going on?’ Loki looks up from his spot at Fury’s feet to answer the man’s question.
He nods in response. ‘It is a fairly simple spell. Here I should be able to help with the worst of the frost bite too,’ he holds out his hands and Thor places one of his in them without a second thought, an action that Loki will deny warms him.
Ned bursts out laughing. ‘No, those two are so far away from being an item. Peter’s got himself a boyfriend.’
‘I’ll still pass, thank you all the same.’ Loki collapses into a single chair, obviously so he doesn’t come into skin contact with anyone.
‘Tony,’ Wanda’s voice makes him pause in his task, but he still can’t turn to face her. ‘You’ve done
‘Oh shut up and let him have some fun,’ Bucky interrupts. ‘Or you just scared you’re going to throw up like you did at Coney Island?’
‘What no cookies?’ Tony asks, once they’re sat down. ‘You do realise I was asleep when you called? You could at least have given us cookies.’
‘I shall be overseeing this duel,’ a female Jotun steps forwards. ‘My word during this duel is law and you shall do as I command to ensure this fight is fair. Is that agreed?’
‘Come on, we’ve more weapons at the car,’ Nakia tells her, slinging one of Sam’s arms over her shoulders as Natasha does the same with his other. Between them they manage to duck behind debris and weave their way back to the Wakandan car. ‘Put him inside,’ Nakia says, ‘the glass is bulletproof, it’ll keep him safer. I’ll get the weapons.’
Sighing in resignation he takes a seat on a bench and leans back, letting the spring sunshine warm his face and taking a bit of pleasure in the outdoors for the first time in a while. Closing his eyes he contemplates letting himself doze off for a couple of minutes.
A knock at the door has Peter turning mid-laugh. ‘Sorry sounds like I’m interrupting something, but just wanted to say hi before you got caught up in everything later,’ Wade says.
‘Makes sense that he wouldn’t understand about the guy that brings gifts to everyone who’s been good,’ Tony teases the trickster, earning himself an eyeroll.
‘Everything is perfect,’ he tells her, ‘you, Wanda, are absolutely perfect and I am hoping, I mean I’d very much like-’ he makes himself stop, take the box from his pocket and, as he has seen in many films and television shows in preparation for this event, goes on to one knee in front of her. Wanda’s eyes go wide and she covers her mouth with her hand. ‘Wanda Maximoff, would you do me the honour of becoming my wife, and make me the happiest being in existence?’
‘Oh yeah!’ Clint grins. ‘I think your exact words were: don’t let anyone call me, FRIDAY. And then she asked about Pepper and you changed it to: don’t let anyone other than Pepper call me, FRIDAY.’
‘No she doesn’t, she blames herself which is worse. The thing is, because they separated them and then she defected, when she next saw him they were on opposite sides.’
‘But-’ Ned cuts him off by dragging him back towards the school. Soldiers are heading their way from the street. Growling in frustration Peter grabs his two friends’ arms and drags them back inside, shouting for everyone else to run.
Bucky tries to stagger to his feet, and as he sucks in a pained gasp he breathes in some of the mist. Immediately he feels his senses clouding, his body becomes heavy and Wanda’s body is almost impossible to hold onto.
When he passes Tony the next bag of popcorn Steve notices the relaxed smile on the inventor’s face. ‘He means a lot to you doesn’t he?’
Tony rubs a hand over tired eyes as he walks down the steps to the street, hoping the headache he can feel coming on could at least wait until he got home. Yet another time Ross had called him in to ‘discuss’ his latest report on Bucky; it was becoming increasingly obvious, almost embarrassingly so, that it was just an excuse to pull him away from helping the soldier.
‘Oh good, he’s back. I was starting to regret agreeing to stay here while I recovered with you gone. The team are much more irritating without you,’ Strange says, coming in with Bruce. ‘Only Doctor Banner was a solace to me.’
Barely ten minutes into the drive and most everyone has dozed off. Wanda is curled up against Vision, his arm around her as he watches the streets of New York go by, seemingly not needing any sleep; Sam and Rhodes have found their own windows to lean up against, and Steve is sure he can hear faint snores coming from the Colonel. Natasha is sleeping up against Bucky, the soldier’s normal arm over her shoulders as he dozes off himself.
When Tony comes downstairs the next morning, because 11:30 still counts as morning, he’s slightly relieved to only see Natasha in the common area. She looks tired after last night’s late mission, but he imagines he looks worse.
The Black Widow is leaning against the doorframe with her arms folded, smirking at him. ‘I’m your ride this week, Pete. Tony got caught up in a meeting with the Council, and since Steve was in there with him and no one trusted Bucky to not make your life hell I volunteered.’
‘Spare me the words, Winter Warrior,’ Loki cuts him off, though his tone is not aggressive, ‘I don’t tend to believe them anymore. Words are like wind: here one minute and then gone the next. You attempted to defend me and Peter against Strange, I will take that as apology enough.’
‘We’d better get them back to the facility and out of the public eye. FRIDAY? Get some suits to come pick up the bodies, we don’t want anyone getting their hands on anything they shouldn’t.’
No one talks much as they collect their bags and head down the ramp. Instead of taking them to the front door, Tony leads them around the side.
‘Yeah?’ Tony knows Peter’s only half listening as he has a half-frown on his face that he gets when he’s concentrating on something.
‘Stark! What are you-’ Ross is cut off by Tony blasting the door open and throwing the man away from the microphone and against the far wall. The two guards in the room look towards their guns and then decide to take a step back.
‘You’ve had your team the Avengers,’ Valkyrie points out, ‘and you had your friends the Warriors Three as well. You have many strengths, Thor, but I’ll admit diplomacy is not always one of them; what you are very good at is making sure you complement the rest of a group with your strengths. We
‘Tony, he’s right,’ Steve sighs, and something in his tone has the inventor’s fingers pausing on the keyboard in front of him and sighing.
‘True, they are both as bad as each other,’ another voice laughs from the doorway and Tony looks over to see Steve leaning against the doorframe with a smirk on his face. ‘Let’s hope they don’t throw a party or we won’t have a home to come back to.’
‘Well,’ Peter rubs the back of his head, not sure how to break the news to his friend, ‘you know the lady in our old apartment said we’d moved? Well May moved in with her new partner and I stayed here in New York-’
Steve laughs quietly as he listens to Tony’s side of the conversation. He’s still not sure how he feels about all this, but for now he’ll just go with the flow. He’ll never admit it, but he’s really missed Tony.
when she gets angry. And she isn’t scared of Nat. I mean anyone who isn’t scared of Nat is terrifying in their own right.’
Natasha smirks. ‘Wouldn’t have anything to do with the view it offers of those two idiots would it?’ She japs a thumb over her shoulder at the two soldiers, who are both too busy sparring to pay much attention to their conversation.
As the car pulls away Wanda explains the Guardians’ arrival and the argument between Quill and Rocket.
There’s a small, genuine smile on Tony’s face now. ‘Alright,’ he presses a kiss to Steve’s lips that he has to resist chasing when Tony pulls away. ‘Then I have two conditions.’
‘I wouldn’t keep him waiting,’ Strange chuckles, and is surprised when Rhodes takes the empty seat not long afterwards.
Peter looks over his shoulder at the red clad mercenary approaching him across the rooftop. ‘Oh hey Deadpool.’
‘Because no one else is going to have the same pull as Captain America,’ he replies. ‘Now come on over here. FRIDAY’s going to make sure the blackout is on the windows and no one can come in without us knowing first so your little dancing secret is safe.’ Tony walks over to an area he’s cleared earlier and Steve follows a little hesitantly. ‘So you’ve never done any dancing before at all?’
‘My name is Mantis,’ she says, ‘my friends are over here. Hey everyone. This is Thor and his friend who I do not know the name of and they want to defeat Thanos.’
‘I’m guessing this is over something Tony told you,’ Steve spits, going to lean against the railing looking out over the complex.
‘Actually it was fairly obvious from the way he moves so confidently despite his disability that he must have some additional abilities,’ the trickster points out, ‘add to that the fact that he is far too well built for someone who is supposedly unable to see equipment well enough, and the way he is able to look at where you are even before you are speaking, not to mention-’
‘As for our next step,’ he stares at the picture of Spider-Man, holding the bridge sign as a shield and spinning the fallen droid like he’s swinging Thor’s hammer, ‘I’d like you to contact our friend in the US. Tell him to move back to the east coast and that he needs to play his trump card. Get close to the boy that is linked to the team, get the information we need. Spider-Man is becoming a nuisance, he was key in bringing down Ajax’s latest mission, although he did well in finding a way to bring it around and get under Deadpool’s skin. From what all our sources can tell us, that
‘A sensible suggestion,’ he nods with a smile. ‘They told me the menu would be here in the room with some other documents.’
‘Ok I want to know whatever it was that one of them said to make Loki turn bright red,’ Clint laughs.
Peter nods, then decides that she’s probably worked most of it out anyway so comes clean. ‘He joins me on a couple of patrols each week, but he only helps if I have to take on any criminals. He’s my friend.’
A/N: Hi everyone. Hope you enjoyed this chapter, I found it tricky to get the right mood for it so I hope it works. I'm so sorry I haven't responded to all the comments yet, I will be doing it this weekend.
Steve just laughs at his friend and lays back, pulling Tony into his side again as the dark haired man smirks at their visitor. ‘Sorry, Bucky, if you want him to leave you alone you shouldn’t wind him up so much. Now why don’t you go sort out that bird’s nest you call hair and we’ll see you upstairs soon?’
‘So, you won’t care if I tell her it was you that snuck into her room and stole all her jumpers so she had to wear the pink fluffy one with the unicorn on the front then?’
‘Alright,’ Peter sighs and settles back down, feeling slightly better despite the conversation having taken a strange turn.
A/N: Hey everyone, I hope you enjoyed this chapter because I have a surprise for you: double update this week! Mainly because the next chapter is called "Date With Deadpool" and I didn't think you'd want to wait a whole week for it.
Ross’ voice continues the sequence that Tony is surprised hasn’t made its way into his own nightmares yet. He hears a grunt of pain from Bucky through the link.
‘Tony,’ Steve’s voice breaks through his musing. ‘Stop avoiding the phone call. You’re inviting them round for Christmas not asking for Peter to be involved in a nuclear war.’
Thank you to everyone who continues to leave comments and kudos on this story, I really do appreciate them all. I'm sorry I haven't had chance to respond to them yet, it's been a bit of a crazy week. I will do it by the end of the weekend though.
But Peter’s had a lightbulb moment, and he starts grinning. ‘Captain I think you’ve just found me my history project.’
‘What did Mr Harris mean when he said you would be the best person to be partnered with on the trip?’ Harry asks him, trying to blow some of his brown hair out of his eyes.
‘Uh oh,’ Rhodes says, ‘he’s gone into his “I’m-frozen-while-I-think-of-something” stance. Brace yourself boys.’
‘Alright. I’ll get Bucky to get hold of Loki. Sure wish we knew where Thor was. Be careful you two,’ she says as she signs off.
Rhodes laughs out loud as the sound of scraping chairs and numerous pounding feet echo from down the corridor as the whole team rush down the corridor. The sounds of fighting drift down to them, and suddenly Peter’s flushed face appears in the doorway.
Next to him the other man sighs. ‘I had to, baby boy. Not all the jobs at Sister Margaret’s can pay, if I take the occasional big paying job I can keep on with those.’
Peter appears to consider the question, a small frown on his face that Steve knows is him trying to work out the best way to phrase what he wants to say. ‘I said at the beginning I chose him because, without him, Captain America wouldn’t be the person we know today and, honestly, I don’t think the Avengers would be either. As to why his story appealed to me?’ He pauses again to think. ‘I guess it’s because… because he meant so much to someone as a friend that they weren’t willing to give up on him, no matter what anyone else told them or what they saw. He’d been… he’d been broken by HYDRA, he’s had so much hatred directed at him from the media, and yet there are still people who are willing to stand by him. Not just Captain America, but the whole team. I suppose what I’m trying to say is: his story just proves that, even if you screw up or you end up in situations where you do something you don’t really want to, the people that are important to you can still forgive you and still accept you.’
‘You know,’ Peter says quietly, ‘I think I do.’ He gives a soft laugh. ‘Sorry, I just got caught up in my thoughts. I should go see if they need a hand setting up the table.’ He stands and leaves Tony with his thoughts. Steve passes him as Peter leaves the room and looks over at Tony.
‘I let someone who is willing to help me protect this city run around yeah,’ he replies, taking a few steps towards the man. ‘Who the hell are you anyway?’
‘Just explaining that to Loki,’ he answers, ruffling the teenager’s hair. ‘SI funds projects that aren’t related to products we sell, some of it is charity work like this one,’ he pulls up one of the files, ‘that provides shelters for veterans returning from war that don’t have families to go to. They help them get back on their feet and re-assimilated into society. Hmm… wonder if Sam might want to lend a hand with that?’ he muses to himself.
‘If you think I’m going to try and get that thing through the front door you’ve got another thing coming,’ Rhodes answers for him.
‘Good, the guys a sentimental drunk and I can’t deal with a sentimental Nick Fury,’ the inventor groans.
Tony smiles as he watches Peter finish zipping up his suitcase and sit on the bed next to him. ‘I’m positive. You deserve this break after everything that’s happened the last few months, not to mention after saving my life,’ he ruffles the brown hair. ‘Besides it’ll be better for you to be out of the media circus of the trial, we don’t want you getting any more attention now they’ve finally lost interest.’
He pauses to consider. ‘We wait. It’ll be getting hungry soon, then it’ll be a case of following the bodies. Be patient. It certainly isn’t.’
Rhodes shrugs. ‘Only by reputation. From what I heard he was one of the best soldiers we had, still has one of the highest number of confirmed kills, but he was dishonourably discharged and I never heard any more from him. Not really surprised he became a merc, quite a few soldiers do if they don’t leave from injury.’
broke down. And, okay he wasn’t the best at handling a car at high speeds, but he was always more careful with Mom in the car. So for it to be a car accident?’ He shakes his head and takes another drink. ‘Plus, at least this way I know there really was nothing I would have been able to do to stop it.’
Tony can’t help but join in with the other man’s infectious chuckle. ‘Alright I’ll admit you surprised me.’
‘So what nonsense you going to get us to repeat Stevie?’ Bucky asks, checking over his gun as they stand in front of their assembled army, waiting and watching for the alien horde to start pouring from the trees in front of them.
Out of the corner of his eye he sees Steve and Bucky exchange worried glances and know they’re wondering if Tony’s somehow found out about his issues with some of the other kids.
‘The rest of you,’ the doctor looks at Clint, Bucky and Drax,’ head to the back door and create havoc. If you can get to the flag brilliant, go for it. But remember your first priority is distraction.’
‘Peter!’ the relief is obvious in May’s voice as she appears and draws the boy into a tight hug. ‘Oh my god I saw on the news that there was a hostage situation and I couldn’t remember if it was the speaker you’d been to see, and then I was calling the helpline trying to find out if you were there. And why didn’t you pick up your phone young man?’ She pushes him back to say the last bit firmly into his face, then her face falls as she takes in his expression. She finally notices Tony standing behind him, and he closes the door softly. ‘Don’t you dare tell me you pulled him into that situation, Mr Stark.’ Her voice is deadly.
Peter shrugs. ‘That’s just what the media calls them. I’ve only ever met Daredevil, never met the others.’
‘Race you!’ he counters and dives out from behind the tree they’ve taken shelter behind, managing to catch Sam on the side of the head.
Carol simply nods, allowing Wanda to hold the gauntlet with her power and float in between them. ‘You ready?’ she asks the girl, who gives her a nod. ‘Then let’s do this.’
‘You’ve never had a banana split?’ At the shake of her head he goes over to the bed, showing her the plate, her eyes going wide at the sight: the banana has been cut in half and three scoops of ice cream, all of different flavours, lie in between with strawberries and blueberries in between. Vision had told him the fruits were Wanda’s favourite. It’s all topped with chocolate flakes, chocolate sauce and whipped cream, and Peter had had to dodge both Bucky and Natasha’s investigating fingers to get it down here untouched.
He sighs. ‘Honestly? I’m not sure how much they support his actions. In a way I can understand them wanting to test that all our claims are true, but I don’t agree with their method.’
‘Yes that’s what I’m afraid of,’ Thor sighs, glancing over at Peter who at least looks sheepish. ‘Take care, brother.’
‘I’m still annoyed we had to miss your face,’ Natasha says as Sam flies her in through the open window.
She doesn’t react outwardly, not even a sigh. Which she knows is going to worry Tony even more, she’s normally a lot less guarded around him when they do this. The thing is she thinks Tony is the only one who is going to be able to help her with this particular problem, but she’s not entirely sure she’s ready to face it.
‘Stupid prick,’ Bucky grumbles, entering the building and seeing the two combatants standing in the middle of the empty space.
‘Bruce? Peter? Shuri? Time for food guys,’ Sam says as he walks through the lab door. ‘I know you guys can get carried away down here.’
be sorting out Christmas presents at this stage?’ Peter huffs, pushing the door opening and then stopping in absolute shock.
‘Nothing is wrong as such,’ the humanoid replies. ‘I just merely wanted to know the reason why you still do not utilise your full potential with your powers?’
‘Hulk get flag!’ he roars, jumping over her to land in front and then snatching the flag from her, nearly sending her sprawling from the force of it. ‘Hulk wins!’
Tony just waves his hand as he stumbles towards the corridor that leads to their bedrooms. They watch him go until he’s out of sight.
A knock at the door has everyone turning to look as the Headmaster pokes his head through. ‘Apologies for the interruption. Mr Parker? Can you step outside please? And bring your books with you.’
’ Tony cuts off the man’s speech by punching the wall next to his face, feeling another twinge of satisfaction as Ross flinches.
‘Why don’t you go to the kitchen Tony? You’re not going to be happy with anything the rest of us prepare anyway,’ Steve all but picks the inventor up from his spot on the couch next to Peter and pushes him towards the kitchen.
go and show off some Wakandan tech to my class?’ he mutters. ‘This trip is going to be hard enough without me getting favouritism from
Deadpool gives a shout of happiness and, before Peter can react, he’s picked up and being spun around in a bear hug by the red clad mercenary. ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry,’ he keeps saying into Peter’s ear.
There he’s said it. He’s asked one of them for help for the first time without any prodding from anyone.
‘Sorry,’ he says, latching himself onto the side of the building. It’s then he notices a familiar form flying towards them and grins. ‘Hey Sam! Can you take her somewhere safe for me?’
Tony stops typing and puts his phone away, but looks straight ahead rather than at Steve. ‘I’ve found there tends to be a difference.’
I hope you're all getting ready for a good festive period, despite the challenges: we're going up in Tiers here in the UK so there's more restrictions unfortunately. Stay safe everyone!
‘Peter,’ he says, shaking her hand. ‘I’m an intern with Stark Industries. But sometimes I go up to help at the facility, hence why I know Wanda so well.’
Peter laughs and shakes his head as they walk towards the bar. ‘Don’t worry I promise to give you some warning with the others. Hey Wade?’
‘Well I suppose that really depends on what he classes as ‘enhanced abilities’ doesn’t it?’ the third woman, who Tony thinks is the one called Val, adds. She turns to the camera. ‘Just to remind all of our viewers that Secretary Ross is proposing legislation that means anyone with enhanced abilities must register with the United States Government, he says as a way to ensure the safety of the individuals as well as the general public. It would mean everyone on the Avengers team would need to register, as well as several of the vigilantes we see around the country. Ross himself named some of the vigilantes he’s be working to find the identities of, including Spider-Man, Daredevil and Deadpool. That’s just in New York alone.’
Wanda turns to concentrate on stabilising Vision’s wound, as Tony looks back at the fight to see Steve and Wong both get pushed backwards and the alien come running towards him. ‘Oh joy,’ he says. ‘Buzz off gobo,’ he says, sending some blasts flying at the alien which makes him veer off course.
‘Oh stop being such a drama queen,’ Wade huffs, walking over to stand in front of Loki and offering his arms, ‘just grab on.’
It took far too long for the bell to ring in Peter’s opinion, but finally it was the end of the day. He shoves all of his books into his bag, for once not actually being careful, and rushes to the door, Ned hot on his heels.
Blinking awake the next morning from where they’d both fallen asleep half on the bed and half-off, he has to admit he’s a little impressed at what they’ve achieved.
Wanda can’t respond, she’s too tired, Strange gives her an alarmed look and she has a sinking feeling they’ve screwed up royally. That
‘Wait, is it a boy?’ Bucky asks. ‘Or do you have one of each? Are they asking for pictures? Please tell me-’
‘NO!’ the raw scream that leaves Peter’s throat does nothing to stop his heart breaking in his chest. The teenager reaches them, letting the mask of his new suit fall away and looking at Tony with such a look of utter terror that makes Steve feel even more helpless. ‘You can’t give up now. Please,’ the teenager sobs. Then he looks up as Steve feels another presence near them. ‘Doc please get me a portal to the facility. I can get a spare reactor! We can save him!’
‘Pete, you agreed to do Neil Jacobs’ science homework for a whole semester just so he’d stop annoying Laura Hall.’
‘Would that have been because Ultron was trying to make sure he could control the stone?’ Peter pipes up from behind them, where he’s watching everything in apparent wide-eyed wonder.
‘Seconded!’ Tony shouts from the kitchenette. ‘What?’ he says at Steve’s frown. ‘You know I fully agree with everything Bucky is saying. The only reason I’m not over there right now is because you literally threatened to leave our bed for a week.’
glad the girl is on their side. She watches Clint take out two more with an arrow in his hand before nocking it to his bow and letting it fly, an explosion sounds a little later and some new guards are thrown to the floor before they even get a chance to join in the fight.
Ororo nods, she has a kind face and Peter hopes Wanda might find a friend in her. ‘My tribe sees it as a blessing bestowed by the gods, and a sign of rulership. A bit old -fashioned in my opinion, but who am I to argue too much? As long as it doesn’t stop us from moving forwards of course.’
‘That is definitely not how it happened,’ Steve rolls his eyes. ‘But we’ll tell you more later, there’s a lot more to the story than us finally getting together.’
‘I know you like him, you know,’ his voice is quiet but steady as they continue to walk, ‘everyone thinks I’m kind of crap with this stuff but I’m not really. I see the way you look at him, and I see the way he looks at you.’
So now that's over: thank you for everyone who is still reading and commenting. Please do let me know what you think of this chapter. No one guessed who the old man was Tony was talking to! I feel slightly proud of this.
‘And if anyone,’ Tony points a mock-threatening finger at each member in turn, ‘complains about having to do DIY I will personally put them on cleaning duty for a month.’
‘Just get in there, kid,’ Tony laughs, pushing him forwards. Rhodey, Bucky, Pepper and Peter all walk in, leaving Steve and Tony in the hallway.
‘Or not if you feel like following Mommy Spider’s advice. Go on dates, preferably with girls whose fathers don’t end up trying to steal my stuff and kill you if I’m honest. All the stuff you’re supposed to do as a teenager. And yeah maybe you won’t do all the crazy stuff I did at your age-’
‘When I was little,’ he continues, eyes never leaving the gun, ‘just after I’d started making things I got hold of one of Dad’s guns. I took it into my room and modified it, then gave it to her when she next visited. Dad was livid,’ he gives a weak chuckle, ‘it was one of his favourite guns. Mom wouldn’t let him take it back though.’
‘I’m not entirely sure how that would come up in conversation in the first place,’ he rolls his eyes, sighing happily as Steve runs his hands up his sides and down his back. He winces a little as some of the muscles in his lower back protest at his movement.
There’s a chorus of laughter as everyone settles back with their cocoa to watch another Christmas film.
In a way she thought of Peter as a mix of her and her twin, but he’d never replace him. Pietro had been the other part of her soul, her opposite and yet her doppleganger; losing him had been like losing half of herself. Pietro had always tried to protect her, seen it as his duty to look after her once their parents were dead because he was the man of the family. It was why he’d signed up to Stryker’s experiments and he’d tried to tell her she couldn’t do the same, all in an effort to protect her from the man they saw as causing their parents’ deaths. The very man who now housed her, fed her, paid for everything she wanted, and who she’d freely admit she loved like a second father. The man who made sure Pietro wouldn’t be forgotten.
Bucky looks to Steve who just nods, keeping his eyes on the road. ‘Alright we promise not to tell Tony,’ the dark haired man says. ‘On one condition: the moment it gets worse you tell one of us straight away. Deal?’
‘Have one of my beers, Baby Boy,’ Wade throws one that the teenager catches easily, barely turning his head.
‘I’m fine, you lie down you look like you’re ready to pass out,’ he comes to sit on the bed. ‘I just came to ask you something.’
Bucky, however, is still stood over Peter, looking torn between wanting to attack him and like he knows he shouldn’t.
‘A mercenary,’ Natasha explains and Tony flicks through the information on the tablet. ‘A very dangerous mercenary with exceptional regenerative abilities, word is he can’t be killed. Used to be in Special Forces before he got his abilities, name of Wade Wilson-’
‘I think it’s a sensible suggestion,’ Vision interjects. ‘If you do even a cursory search of the internet you’ll see the Avengers are not universally liked, nor trusted. Anyone could try and do something to pull us apart again, especially seeing as we are particularly vulnerable in that respect at the present.’
has committed treason? Really? The guy who almost single-handedly took down Hitler’s science division? Who went solo behind enemy lines and brought back an entire captured division? Not exaggerating, trust me, that was my Dad’s favourite bed time story; well mainly his part in flying the plane, but eventually he told me the rest of it.’
They both ready themselves, both limping slightly, both of them are battered and bleeding. But Peter is fighting with everything he and the Symbiote have combined to keep Thanos busy to give them chance to catch their breath. To give Wanda and Vision chance to run. And Steve is not going to let their youngest team member stand alone, no matter how exhausted and battered he is.
‘Half responsible,’ Loki corrects him. ‘I believe it was the three of you decided it was a crime that I hadn’t tried it. Apparently there was good reason behind it.’
