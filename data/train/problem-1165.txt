“I made a cruet set in one of them and a kitchen paper towel holder in another; I think that was about my limit.  The cruet set I still have, actually, in my room at home.  I cut mine into a skull shape and painted the salt shaker black on white and the pepper was white on black.”
John turned back to Sherlock, his duty to interact with other people fulfilled for the moment.  He noticed that Sherlock was intently watching Julian who was looking down at his plate and pushing his food around a bit, seeming to have lost his appetite somewhat.  Sherlock realised John was looking at him and he focused on him instead and picked up a vol-au-vent when John nodded towards his plate.  He did prefer his pastry with a sweeter filling but pastry was pastry, and he liked the way John smiled at him as he ate, so he felt somewhat vindicated for the effort.
“Ok, give it here then.”  John dialled his Mum’s number.  “Hi Mum, it’s John.  No, there's nothing wrong; I'm fine.  How are you?  That's good.  Mum, I was wondering if I could go to stay at my friend's house when we get back from Scotland after Christmas please?  No, it's not Mike; it's a boy who just started here this term and his name is Sherlock.  Yes, it is quite an unusual name; if fits him perfectly as he's rather a unique person, too.  His family have a party on Boxing Day and he's invited me to that, and then to stay afterwards, and we'll come back to school together when term begins.  No, his Mum doesn't mind; he's just rung her to ask.  His older brother will pick me up at the station.  Yes, honestly, she's fine if I stay for the rest of the holidays.  Oh thanks, Mum, you're the greatest.  Yes, okay, I'll see you when I get home.  Yes, I'm looking forward to it, too.  See you soon.  Bye Mum."
“So do you know what he’s doing exactly?”
“What I have to say is that was very unhygienic and unsafe – you didn’t even sterilise the skin – is that good enough for you?”
Your Sherlock
"Yes, why did you bring that?  There is a less than 2% chance of rain today; it seems quite unnecessary."
"We may not be able to indulge in kissing in the back row but there is nothing to say what else we can or can’t get up to in the dark with a coat spread across our laps."
The four of them headed down towards the pitches when Sherlock pulled back.
His only other visitor was Mycroft.  John still hadn’t forgiven Mycroft for what he had done in betraying his brother and would merely glare at him as he hovered by the door; seeming to not want to brave coming closer.  He came over every week as if just checking in so that John knew he was still there.  John had no doubt that Mycroft had other methods of keeping an eye on him on a more frequent schedule, if what Sherlock had always said about bugs was true, but John just really couldn’t be bothered to search for anything.  He couldn’t really be bothered to do anything at all, if it came to that.
“Sherlock…”
Sherlock grinned at him, "An excellent idea, John; just what I was thinking myself - though it could be dangerous."
John’s eyebrows had risen at the word ‘butler’, but he supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised.  Sherlock was the very epitome of upper class.
“Whenever it is anything to do with the military your posture automatically straightens even more than usual.  You have been sending more emails than usual and when you have been answering them you sit up straight in your chair and get a nostalgic curve to your lip.  Thus an upcoming reunion you have been trying to arrange which has clearly been postponed due to the current situation.  You were injured during this period last year so were obviously unable to attend the last reunion and were looking forward to this year hence your recent melancholic mood and your return home with a quantity of alcohol.”
Sherlock led the way over to his sitting room which he had had set up like a laboratory on one side with his microscope and chemistry equipment set up on a solid bench.  The other half of the room had some squashy bean bag chairs and a big entertainment system with a TV and HiFi unit and storage for all his classical music CD’s.  Even at age 10, Sherlock was highly skilled with his violin and was able to play a concerto perfectly from memory if he so chose.
John smiled and Sherlock instantly wanted to try it for himself and get more of that taste.  He kissed from the corner of John’s lips into the centre.  When John opened his lips, he slid his tongue inside and proceeded to map the contours of John’s mouth, tasting every part he could reach; storing the information in his mind palace for future perusal and categorisation.
“Well, that went better than it could have done, I think.  What do you think he’ll say?”
Simon tried again to get a rise out of Sherlock.  "I hear you’ve actually stuck it out for a whole term this time, Sherlock.  How on earth did you manage that?  Did Daddy have to pay for a new wing?”
“Hello Billy, is the boss in?”
“Daddy is taking us to Innsbruck on Friday so we’ll be skiing ‘til after New Year.  Mummy did say I could ask Freddie along, but he has some boring family thing he has to do so he couldn’t come.  I do think he could have got out of it but he said not, it’s really too bad.”
15th February
“I know you said that and I appreciate it.”  John pulled Sherlock back to lean against his chest and ruffled his hair as it tickled under his chin.  “I think I’m ready though.  I’ve been out in the sun and was fine as long as I was well covered; thank you again for the new coat and bits and pieces you got delivered, by the way; a far better option than the ear hat you first suggested.”
“That was amazing.”
“Well I noticed it, of course; it’s your RAMC tie, isn’t it?  I thought perhaps it was some kind of special occasion.”
“Hardly likely that you would have.”  Sherlock smirked at him.
John didn’t appear to be of the same opinion as, at that moment, he flung open the door of the bathroom, fully dressed and grabbed his school bag, backing away to the door.
“John, you are ridiculous.”
“Well, thanks.”  John smiled back at her and had a big drink before he turned back to talk to Sherlock.  When they had all finished eating and chatting they cleared away the food and moved the tables out of the way.  Sally turned the music up for people to dance if they wanted to.  People seemed loath to be the first up so Greg made an effort and went over to stand by Sally.
Sherlock looked at him through his eyelashes and winked as he bent down to taste John’s areola.  John let out a deep groan and his grip tightened in Sherlock’s hair as his head fell back and he allowed himself to enjoy everything that was to come; knowing that it was going to be an amazing journey for both of them.
By Joolz
I stand by what I said in my other letter about you being handsome and 'thank you' is fine as an answer, although you don’t need to thank me for just being truthful and it’s everybody else’s loss if they don’t think that.  Hell, you’ll probably stop writing to me after this anyway so I might as well go all in.  I think you’re not just regularly handsome but downright bloody gorgeous.  I love your dark, curly hair and would love to run my fingers through it.  I re-read your letters all the time and keep your photo close to me so I can look at it constantly.  The other guys already tease me about it and call you my boyfriend and it makes me smile even though I know it isn’t true.  How stupid am I!
“Oh God, yes.  I want that too.”
“If you say so.”  Mrs Hudson smiled at him.
“Hmm, I think I’m liking where this is going – what is the reward system you had in mind?”
"No, I was serious.  I want to try everything with you, Sherlock."
"Would you drinking my blood make me a vampire?"
“It’ll be another week and a half yet until we come home.  Try not to burn anything down until I’m back, won’t you.”
"Sherlock, what the hell is... ohhhh... what was that?"
John pulled back, his pupils dilated, breath ragged.  Sherlock was in the same state and it took him a while to pull himself together enough to ask the next question.  John got it right again and this time he pointed at Sherlock’s left nipple.  Sherlock nodded, nostrils flaring as he sucked in a breath as John licked over the rapidly hardening nub.  John took it in to his mouth and when he had thoroughly covered it, he bit down gently, earning another groan from Sherlock.  As he pulled away he blew over the damp skin, causing Sherlock to shiver at the differing temperatures.
“Are you sure this isn’t something you’re going to regret in the morning?”
“It’s just a figure of speech, Sherlock.  Anyway, thank you very much for my gifts, they are all greatly appreciated.”
"Does... does it hurt?"
“Good plan.  Wait, how do you know my dad is with the police; no, never mind now; how do you know anything.  Sally go and get Mrs Featherstone, please, and I’ll go and get my Dad.  Julian, you stay here; this isn’t something we can deal with ourselves.  You attempted actual physical harm on one of us so it goes beyond our control.  John, Sherlock, would you make sure that Julian doesn’t try an escaping act in the meantime.  The rest of you can go and see your families, I guess, but don’t talk about this for now, until we find out what the authorities want to do.”
“Oh really, and what did you have in mind, exactly?”
“How are you possible, John Watson?”
They had a lovely meal with Sherlock making polite but interesting conversation with Mrs Watson.  He used his observations, and the knowledge he had gained from things John had said previously, to engage her in topics she would enjoy, and chipped in when John provided amusing anecdotes about their friends.  Even Harry was succumbing to Sherlock’s charms as he focused on her achievements, instead of the subtle signs which were already visible – to him, at least – concerning her drinking habits.  They sat with coffee after dessert and Sherlock launched his offensive.
“It was Mrs Hudson who was doing the baking and she let me help because it was just so boring here.  When are you coming back?”
Just a short exposition chapter I added so it doesn't appear to leap straight into the fray later.
Sherlock jumped out of the way of the trolley and managed to sidestep the waiter who lost his balance as he tried to right himself and move out of their path.  Unfortunately, this moved him further into John's way and he had to grab hold of the waiter and swing him round to allow him to get past.  The waiter kept going on that trajectory and spun round again with John shouting 'sorry' at him as he kept on twirling.
“Seems like you’re doing pretty well if that pile of chips is anything to go by.  Would you like a little extra competition?”
“I think it would probably be better if I led.  I watched you counting your way round the last one and you may find it flows a little easier if you do not have to concentrate so hard.”
"Well, there's cake available in the interval if that's what you're anticipating, dear brother."  The brothers glowered at each other for a moment before John coughed, reminding Sherlock of their purpose.
“Got Moran?”
Freddie, himself, was taking no notice of Hannah so he obviously didn't know about her little crush.  He did glance at Natalie occasionally, but only when Jasmine was focusing hard on what she was doing and wasn't paying attention to him.  So did that mean Freddie knew Jasmine was jealous of Natalie for some reason?  Yes; Natalie clearly must have been dating Freddie before Jasmine.  It didn't look as if either Natalie or Freddie were completely over each other as he could see the looks of wanting from Freddie as much as he could from Natalie.  Obviously, Jasmine must have stolen Freddie away from Natalie; maybe it was a popularity thing.  These teens tended to put so much importance in being seen with the right people and, to all intents and purposes, it seemed that Jasmine was the 'right' person - well, she certainly appeared to think so anyway.
Thanks everyone
John shuffled closer to Sherlock and looked into his eyes.  He could see no doubt or uncertainty with regard to what they were about to do and it gave him the confidence to proceed.  He leant forward and gently pressed his lips against Sherlock’s, keeping his eyes open and watching to make sure he didn’t hurt him by accident.  When he pulled back, Sherlock licked his lips, smiled and pointed back at them again, wanting more.  John angled his head over to give a better position and tried it again, pressing lots of small kisses to Sherlock’s lips before trying a couple of longer, deeper ones.
“We seem to be forming a mutual appreciation society.”
"Think nothing of it, lad.  I'll bring the wood in tomorrow morning, so you could start as early as tomorrow lunch time if you have the urge."
John lay propped in the bed with the sides both up and a nurse standing next to him trying to pull the covers over him and keep his legs in the bed.  When he saw Sherlock come in he stopped wriggling and smiled as widely as his split lip would allow him.
Sherlock pounded in hard, managing to find the right angle to graze against John’s prostate on each stroke.  They were both shouting and moaning as they each approached their climax.  Sherlock took hold of John’s cock and after only a couple of strokes John was crying out as he came all over Sherlock’s fingers and his own chest.  His passage contracted around Sherlock on each pulse and Sherlock couldn’t hold back any longer before he, too, was releasing inside John.  Sherlock collapsed down on top of John, who just put his arms around him and held him tight.  The pair of them lay there for long moments recovering.
“I can’t believe you came here merely to exchange pleasantries, Mycroft.  Just say what you need to and get out.”
Two weeks later they were once again out working a case.  They had been brought in to consult on the murder of a young Chinese woman and Sherlock had worked out that she had been smuggled into the country as part of an illegal operation and they were currently staking out the hideout of the gang.  Greg was there with his officers who were stationed at various points around the perimeter.  Sherlock had, of course, found the best place for John and himself to wait where there was the most likelihood of activity.
Julian’s feet stuttered as he wobbled backwards, the backs of his knees hitting a chair behind him and he fell down onto the seat.  The colour drained from his face, and his head dropped into his shaking hands, as he muttered in a low voice.
“Oh God, me too.  Can I… Can I touch you?  Please, Sherlock, I need to.”
John snorted.  “I wish.”
“Yes.  You must be the new gardener’s boy.  Mummy said you were arriving today.”
"What you said when you sat down?"
The three of them were all doing science subjects so they went to the first lesson together.
“This is a message for Sherlock Holmes.  I’m supposed to be forgiving myself as well as others and I’ve got to believe in a higher power that can heal me.  Well, you may not be a God, but you certainly had some kind of power judging by some of the things you could do and see.  You were always amazing and I miss that.  I miss being amazed by you.  I miss you.”
“Apparently, I’ve been a blind fool.  Even Mary said she could tell just from the way we looked at each other.  I’m yours, if you want me, that is?”
"Well, this time we'll actually be right."
“Thank you, Martin.  You made our unfortunate delay more bearable.”
"Honestly, John, it's not a listed building or anything so exotic; you always exaggerate these things."
“I suppose I might as well help you, I’ve got nothing better to do.”
John was starting to slur his words so whatever he’d been given was obviously starting to take effect already.  The quiet man in the corner stopped his associate from smacking John once more.
"Oi, I'll be one of them."
John lay on his back in the middle of the bed and allowed Sherlock to take his time to find a comfortable position with his head resting on John’s shoulder and his arm across his waist.  John put his own arms around Sherlock and held him snugly, pressing a soft kiss into his hair.
“Ah, you mean Anthony, I assume.  I like to bounce my ideas off someone and Anthony very rarely answers back,” he gave a close-lipped smile.  “It helps to talk out loud and he doesn’t subject me to the verbal diarrhoea I get when I talk to anyone else around here.”
“Well the answer to what can kill you is not a lot.  Basically, removing your head is the only way to ensure it.  Most other injuries are recoverable with the ingestion of blood.  The more serious injuries need blood direct from a host but others are achievable with blood bags which we would normally use for sustenance anyway.”
Greg’s jaw dropped again at the imagery Sherlock conjured up and the fact that it was Sherlock agreeing to these things.  John put his hand on Greg’s knee and he turned towards him.  John leaned forwards and pressed his lips against the corner of Greg’s open mouth.  It soon brought Greg out of his awed shock and he kissed back, his hand rising to cup John’s jaw.
Sherlock smiled shyly at John.  He did so love it when John showed how proud he was of him; it never got old.  They parted ways as they got up to their rooms, all of them pondering what they could do to keep everyone safe for the rest of the production.
Sherlock circled the head and licked a stripe up one side and down the other, before blowing across the damp skin causing John to shiver.  John gripped convulsively at Sherlock’s hair as he deep throated him in one go and just held him there as he swallowed around him, not needing to stop to breathe.  Sherlock alternated licking around the head and taking John in deeply again and again and John was very quickly brought to the edge.  Sherlock sucked at the pre-come gathered in the slit and looked up at John.
Please
“You had an orange cup for your first drink and a blue one for your second, so let’s do those first.”
John grinned at him and Sherlock smiled back.  Neither of them seemed too eager to move and disturb the comfortable silence into which they had fallen.  They lay together, watching each other easily and coaxing themselves into the day.  It was John who eventually moved first when he felt the need to empty his bladder.
John didn’t really know what to do with his arm now; he put it down against his stomach so it was resting behind Sherlock’s head.  He could feel those dark curls brushing against the back of his hand.  They were just as soft as he had imagined they would be that morning.  In fact, this was the exact scenario he had pictured.  As the backs of his fingers rubbed against the strands, Sherlock let out a contented hum and his head snuggled against John’s leg.  John took that as a good sign.  He decided to make a very brave, though possibly foolhardy step.  He turned his hand over and stroked it tentatively through Sherlock’s hair.  Sherlock let out an even deeper hum and John saw that his eyes closed briefly as he obviously enjoyed the motion.  John grinned, delighted that his risk had paid off.  He settled himself back more comfortably against the sofa and allowed his hand to caress Sherlock’s curls at will; both of them deriving immense pleasure from the sensation.
John was allowed in once they had him settled and he kept a close check on the monitors, knowing exactly what to look out for and anticipating the exchange of medication and blood bags so that when the nurses came in they found everything already done for them.  They also had Sherlock on a nutrient solution.  Even though he had only been held hostage for a few days, he clearly hadn’t been taking proper care of himself before that either and John was determined to get him back in as healthy a condition as soon as possible.
“It’s okay, John, you aren’t going mad.  It’s really me, I’m here.”
"Oh, yes, we will, thanks again.  We'll see you at lunch.  Thanks, sir, bye."
“Sherlock, can you turn back over for me?”
“It keeps the wolves from the door.”  Mycroft added with faux modesty, as he sped up.
“Hardly.  This is the first time I’ve been out properly since…”
“That sounds like a great idea.  Go and have a word with Dad and I’m sure he’ll be happy to set it up how you want.  You can show me your findings when I get home.”
John lay still on the bed and Sherlock bent closer to listen as he heard John muttering under his breath.
They filled their plates, even Sherlock helped himself to a few treats, after John nudged him and raised his eyebrows suggestively a couple of times.
“The whole day?  What on earth do you have planned, John?”
“Okay, I’ll tell you, but don’ tell ‘im.”
They stayed like that for a long while, relaxing comfortably together, almost lightly dozing until Sherlock nudged John, sighing as he sat up.
John looked round and felt himself automatically straightening his posture at the military greeting.
“Sherlock, don’t be rude,” Mycroft butted in before Sherlock could go in to further details.  “You do your uniform proud, Gregory.  Ignore Sherlock.  I know he would be delighted to assist you in any way and I will liaise with your Department about getting him enrolled as an official consultant to enable you to call him when necessary without fear of complications.”
John left the shirts and moved to the two shelves underneath.  Here was evidence of Sherlock’s sock index at work, though John found it hard to tell the difference in shade from one pair of black socks to another.  At least he wouldn’t get in trouble if he disturbed it this time, he thought, as he moved the socks aside to see if there was anything hidden in the drawer.  His finger touched something hard.  There, right at the back, was a small phone.  John pulled it out to examine it.  It was just a cheap old Nokia, maybe a burner phone; nothing like as sophisticated as Sherlock’s normal model.  He turned the screen on and, luckily for him, it started up first time without a password.
So did Sherlock drink blood?  He’d never seen it but that didn’t mean it didn’t happen.  He’d certainly bitten his own arm easily enough.  And John’s lip!  He remembered Sherlock sucking his lip when it had been nicked and then groaning in pleasure.  He hadn’t tried to bite John though and he’d certainly had plenty of opportunities.  In fact, Sherlock had ceded control to John of the whole encounter.  Was that how he liked it or had he just been letting John see that he wouldn’t try and make John do anything he didn’t want?  John had certainly enjoyed taking Sherlock but he had to admit he wanted to feel Sherlock inside him too.  Whoa, stop right there – vampire remember.  That wasn’t happening.  Nothing was happening ever again.  That was it, over, finished.
“Well, all I can say is that’s a shame.  If I had been feeling the appreciation then I may even have gone to the trouble of having them all recorded for posterity.”
The team split in half to train against each other and John, as Captain of one of the teams, quickly picked his side and elected to play facing the way that would bring him nearest to Sherlock as he ran up and down the line.  Sherlock, for his part, spent most of the game watching John’s legs as he powered past him.  They weren’t overly hairy and what was there was fine and soft and Sherlock was just itching to run his fingers through it and see if it was as soft as it looked.
John laughed.  “Well, you’ve got me there.  I don’t know the reasoning behind it either.  If you’re feeling okay then why are you fidgeting?”
“Sherlock, that was… it was just beautiful.  Was that… us?”
Sherlock’s face fell.  He despised being called a child.  “I hate you.”  He turned on his heel and was away before John had time to do more than shout his name.
“Oh, really, are you ticklish, John?”
When they'd finished, the two couples headed back out on to the dance floor.  They spent the rest of the night enjoying their partners' company, all instinctively knowing that this was only the first of many evenings they would spend together.
“Leave him a minute.  He’ll soon be telling us everything we want to know.”
“Get off with you, the pair of you.”  She covered a smile as she pushed them towards the door.  “The bell will be ringing for lunch in a minute so you may as well make your way straight there.  Look after yourself and come back if you need anything further.”
John straightened himself up and took hold of Sherlock’s hand, pulling him to his feet and leading the way to the stairs.  As he went up one step he turned and made the most of being taller than Sherlock for a brief moment to capture his lips again.  His hands slid around Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock encircled John’s waist with his own.  They made their way up the stairs very slowly with John walking backwards so he didn’t lose contact with Sherlock as he went.
John snorted.  "Yeah, right.  Like I want to spend any more time with that idiot.”
John’s name was what instantly came to Sherlock’s mind.  He was the only person Sherlock really cared about in any way.  Maybe he could send something to John; that would certainly surprise him as he wouldn’t be expecting a package up there.  It wouldn’t do to be too keen though, so he shrugged at Mrs Hudson.
“Well?”
Dearest John
“Well now that we’ve completed this mutual compliment session do you think we might be able to progress things along a little further in your room because one time just isn’t enough for me where your insatiable body is concerned.  I think if I don’t have you again soon I may well explode and I’m sure you wouldn’t want that on your conscience.  ‘Death of Consulting Detective by spontaneous combustion – News at 10’.”
“’M comfy.”
That is my sister in the picture in my hat.  You were spot on with our relationship, too.  She is three years older than me and we got on great when we little, but it all changed after my parents were killed.  It should have brought us together but she couldn’t cope and found solace in the bottom of a bottle and it hasn’t really improved since so that picture does remind me of better times.
“Of course.  Let’s have a look.”
Eternally yours
“Come on, Sherlock, you’d be brilliant in this.  You could do all your deducing on stage.”
Chapter Two
John was the first one to come back to his senses as he realised that Sherlock must, obviously, have discovered the problem and it, clearly, had something to do with the gun.  He stepped forward towards Matthew and tried to bring things round and get back to the script.
Understudies:

"Well, if that's the way you wake me up; you're never leaving my bed again."
Sherlock laughed but carried straight on with the questions.  John got the next few correct and Sherlock was slowly divested of his other shoe and both socks before John took pity on him and said Sherlock could take an item of John’s clothing.
He liked it up there on top of his building.  It gave a great view over the campus and he could have time to himself to sit and compose whenever he felt like it.  None of his friends knew it, but he had quite a repertoire of his own songs.  He had a little book which he always carried with him and he would often write down a phrase that appealed to him or a few notes that he felt might lead somewhere, and then play around with them later when he was on his own.
“Well, I probably shouldn’t tell you this but I had you in my sights for a while.”
“Hush.  Get on over there and put things right.  I want someone to have an unforgettable time tonight, even if it isn’t me.”
“Indeed.  What else do we deserve?”
Sherlock carefully slid John’s head back on to his chest, from where it had slipped to press down on his shoulder, giving him a dead arm.  He clenched his fist as all the feeling rushed back in with a pins and needles sensation.  When it stopped he put his arm around John and stroked up his back, fingers carding through the short hair at the base of John’s head.  John made a funny noise, almost a rumble in his throat, and pushed backwards into the contact, enjoying the feeling of fingers in his hair, even in his sleep.
Sherlock closed the puncture after a few more sips and then licked John clean as well as his own fingers.  He never let a drop of John’s essence go to waste; he liked to taste him at every chance he could get; plus it saved all the effort of having to go to the bathroom to get a cloth to clean them both up when he’d much rather spend the time with John, watching him enjoying his lassitude.  Sherlock moved up to lie next to John and John reached across to press a lazy kiss on his lips.
It was most puzzling and John really didn’t know what to do with this overwhelming influx of new information.  He couldn’t seem to assign the possibility of real feelings on to his vision of Sherlock.  Much as he felt these things himself and wished he had told his friend, it felt too weird to think Sherlock had already had those thoughts and been the first to state them.  It was too much to take in.  John’s head was buzzing and he sat back on the sofa, letting everything wash over him as he tried to assimilate what he had just discovered.
“He wouldn’ care anyway; s’already married to his work so wouldn’ wan’ me.”
John smiled at Sherlock and squeezed his arm.  He bent forward and kissed him softly on the mouth, his lips sliding across Sherlock’s jaw, placing little kisses as he went.  He didn’t want to let go; he was just enjoying being close to Sherlock, being able to hold him in his arms.
Sherlock smiled.  “I do enjoy how you have so many of these ‘best ever’ moments, John; it quite does something for one’s ego.”
The pilot grabbed some blankets, bottles of water and snack rations from the plane and they moved over to the broken-down shack.  They were able to drag a still reasonably dry mattress over to one sheltered corner with an overhang that protected them from the elements and they set themselves up there to wait out the storm.
Sherlock knew John was really mad because he only got seriously sweary when he was either exceedingly angry or during the heights of passion and this certainly wasn't the latter.  Immediate apology was his only recourse to try and salvage the situation.
“It was actually quite good fun, except for the bits which were dangerous…”
Her father was on secondment to a position at the Embassy in London and hadn’t wanted to be separated from his family so his wife and daughter had both come with him.  He often got posted to other countries so they were used to this routine and Mary had found that she fitted into the curriculum quite well with her wide-ranging knowledge so she was able to keep up with the other students of her age.
“Tell me everything.  The what, when, how, why – everything.”
When they got back John led the way straight into the bedroom.
John didn’t hesitate and went straight for Sherlock’s neck.  It was one of his favourite parts of Sherlock’s body and he knew that it was very sensitive for Sherlock too, so it would ramp things up for both of them.  He trailed his tongue along from shoulder to ear and back down.  He gave Sherlock a bright love bite right in the crook of his neck to match the one that he was already sporting.
He put his hand into that soft hair again and tried pulling it up to manoeuvre the tongue where he wanted it most; around the tip.  They obviously took the hint as it dipped into the slit again and then circled around the head, blowing lightly over the freshly moistened flesh, sending shivers of pleasure racing along John’s spine.  He didn’t ever want to wake up from this dream.
“You think my lips are gorgeous?”
“We haven’t attempted simultaneous reciprocation of both oral and manual penile stimulation with femoral puncture and depletion.”
John stared transfixed at the long fingers on his arm.  He slowly moved his other hand over and pinched it between his fingers and heard an ‘ouch’ in return.  His eyes travelled along the length of Sherlock’s arm and up to his face.  He reached his hand out and touched the cheekbones he had always admired from afar.  His eyes filled with tears as his fingers stroked down Sherlock’s cheek.
As they got more drunk they decided it would be fun to play some games.
“Far be it from me to stop you, then; have at it.”
It has been two long months since I last heard from you and I finally gave in and went to Mycroft.  He used his contacts to discover that you were the medic assigned to a rescue mission to liberate some Allied hostages.  Your team managed to get everybody out but during the evacuation one of the helicopters got caught in enemy fire.  In the time it took to right itself and fly off, you got struck in the crossfire - in the shoulder or arm they said - and toppled backwards out of the helicopter, unable to hold on tight enough with your injury.
John blushed, "Um, it would seem so, then."
“Brilliant.  If you let me know when you’ve got those all finished then we’ll see if we can use the big rehearsal room to have a run-through with the doors in place, so that we can get a better feel for the scene changes.  This is going to be so good everyone; I’m really feeling it now, aren’t you?”
This included John’s mum and sister, who had both arranged to have the day off so that they could come down for the show.  They had arrived in time for lunch and had arranged with the school to take John and Sherlock out for the meal.  Lessons had more or less finished already, especially for the performers.  A few of the other families of cast members had also had the same idea, and Sherlock spotted Oliver, Matthew, Hannah and Julian dining with their own families whilst they were there.
Sherlock blushed this time.  No-one had ever told him that his deductions had affected them like that before.  He'd had people comment on his face, of course, but they hadn't interested him.  What John had just told him was that he’d been impressed with what he’d said; this was something new.
Sherlock reached up and slid his fingers along the waistband, teasing at the skin of John’s abdomen.  John groaned as Sherlock touched him there and his hand convulsively gripped on to Sherlock’s shoulder as he pulled the material down and uncovered John’s cock.  Sherlock just looked at it for a few moments, examining it from all sides.
John pushed Sherlock’s jacket off his shoulders and draped it over the arm of the sofa.  He slid his hand slowly down the front of that enticing shirt, circling each button and sliding his fingers into the gaping spaces between, as Sherlock flexed his chest, pulling it even tighter.  John popped the first button open and kissed the area of skin newly exposed.  He did the same all the way down Sherlock’s chest, until the other was shaking with restraint.  He tried to stop himself from pulling John away and attacking his mouth.  John traced around Sherlock’s belly button and pushed his tongue inside.  He sucked the skin around it and bit down, leaving a red mark, which he kissed away to soften the blow.
“It’s on its way.  Just keep working on John if Lestrade arrives and we can say they revived him in the ambulance.  Hold on, Sherlock.”
Somewhere in Afghanistan
They went back every lunch break and by the end of the week all the pieces were cut and planed and they were ready to be assembled.  Everything fitted together perfectly, and Mr Johnson came over to see how they were getting on.
"Oh, God, yes!"
Sherlock smiled shyly at him.  “Okay.  That’s… that’s nice.”
“Problem, Sherlock?”  John strengthened his stance to try and keep Sherlock still and did it again, sliding the feather from one side over to the over, dipping into Sherlock’s belly button on the way across.  Sherlock squealed and squirmed.
“John, please?”
“Shirt.”
“I don’t know what to say to such a declaration, Sherlock.  I spent a long time thinking about it this morning and I do have feelings for you, I have for a while now, but this vampire thing is going to take some getting used to.  I don’t know how I feel about even the concept of being turned, but I certainly don’t want to think about you killing yourself over me.  I’m not worth your life, not ever.”
“Hey, it’s alright, Doc.”
He had been there thirty minutes and was in the middle of texting a message to Mycroft to demand that he came back to pick him up now instead of waiting another hour, as Mycroft had ordained, when he saw ‘him’ arrive.  There was no other way to describe it – John looked amazing.  He was wearing a tux, as were the majority of the other boys, too, but John had matched his with a deep blue shirt which brought out the colour of his eyes and set off his blonde hair perfectly.  After storing the image of John’s utter perfection into his brain he turned away, not wanting to be caught looking, and pretended a nonchalance he was far from feeling.
“He’s in his office.  You can go on up, you know he’s always glad to see you.”
“No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die.”
“Do I have to?  You know they’re all deadly dull.”
John blushed again and smiled up at Sherlock.  "Well, thanks, I guess."
“No.  I don’t require an audience for what I do.”
“Fuck off.  I am not.  Don’t be ridiculous; what really happened?”
“Really!  Wow, it was so beautiful.”
John laughed and moved out of the way as two men dressed in black suits - members of Mycroft's team, who had been waiting in the wings, he presumed - came through and frogmarched Jenkins out through the exit at the rear of the kitchen.  John and Sherlock headed back towards the ballroom to see if Mycroft had been as successful with his portion of the mission.
“Where are we exactly?”
“I thought so, too.  It is certainly my intention to have you screaming my name as you come.”  Sherlock grinned evilly at him, and John swallowed loudly, as he imagined what Sherlock might do to him.
They moved on to the fourth in the line as the other team had already cleared the second one and moved on to the third.  As John waited for one of the men to again cut their way in he looked over to the fifth warehouse.  This one was slightly further out on its own and once again surrounded by high weeds.  John tensed as he thought he saw a flash of light from one of the low windows, probably the basement.  The team leader standing next to him had felt the movement and looked at him questioningly.
“Well, it does now because I’m certainly happy to see you.”
"John Watson, my partner.  John, this is Charles Higginson, the owner of this fine establishment."
“Such dedication; what would I do without you?”
“You’re right, this has been a wonderful conclusion to what I was anticipating as a miserably disappointing evening.”
He’d been careful to get flavoured oil as he’d known he wouldn’t be able to keep his mouth to himself once he got started.  The slightly fruity taste mixed nicely with Sherlock’s own juices and he enjoyed watching Sherlock’s face as he sucked his finger deeply into his mouth, rolling it around with his tongue and making pornographic noises to hold Sherlock’s attention.  Sherlock’s jaw dropped at the sight before him and his own groan joined the noises John was making as he watched the suggestive way John was moving his hand.  Sherlock tried to pull his own hand down to replace John’s but, of course, it was secured and his head fell back against the pillow as he realised there was nothing he could do.
John and Sherlock left in great excitement and were back again the next day at 12:15 - Sherlock allowing John a bare minimum of fifteen minutes to finish his lunch - before they were knocking on the door ready to begin.  The wood Mr Johnson had brought in was perfect for what they needed.  Sherlock had downloaded some pictures from the internet, and had even been able to find some specs for construction so they knew exactly what they needed to do.
John was happy to obey and he slammed his pelvis harder against Sherlock.  He stretched his arm around to give himself more support and took hold of Sherlock’s cock.  His fingers were still slippery so they slid easily down the shaft making Sherlock groan in delight.  They set up a rhythm so that when John pushed forward, his hand slid up to Sherlock’s tip, and when he pulled back, his hand glided down to the base, Sherlock’s arse nestling against John’s groin each time.  They were quickly overcome with the new sensations and, after only a few more moments, John came against the base of Sherlock’s cock, and pulled hard against his friend to bring him off, too.
“Would you like me to try it on the soles of your feet for a change of pace?”
“You’ve actually seen him, then?”
Sherlock nodded to himself.  That didn’t sound too bad.  He’d admitted his feelings and given a brief explanation so hopefully John would accept that, at least to start with.  He was sure that he would have to go over it all repeatedly before John was satisfied, but he had put it out there and now he would just have to see how John responded.
“You can’t just say that without asking anyone.  Your mum wouldn’t want me turning up and spoiling your party.”
“Did I though?”
John woke first to a sensation of warmth down the front of his body.  He opened his eyes to see Sherlock fast asleep, pressed tightly against him, head wedged into the crook of John’s shoulder where it rested against the bed.  He lay still, not wanting to wake Sherlock, knowing how little sleep he usually got.  He watched Sherlock breathing, holding back a chuckle as he watched his own pyjama pocket ruffling and billowing as Sherlock released each breath against it.
"Honestly, John, it's a perfectly natural bodily function; there's no need for embarrassment."
“You imagine that someone like Anderson could solve this?”
Sherlock kept John held in place with one hand, whilst he traced the contours of his body with the other.  Whilst he distracted John by following the line of hair down his chest, he leant forward and bit down on one nipple.  This caused John to shout out and push his chest up towards Sherlock, instantly wanting more.  Sherlock quite enjoyed keeping John off balance like this, with him being unable to see or retaliate.  He left a few more bites and kisses, choosing unusual places so that John wouldn’t be expecting it.  He took it one step too far, it seemed, when he went to suck the underarm, which was starkly exposed in this position, with John’s arms trapped above his head.  John was too ticklish to just lie still and accept that, and his arm reflexively shot downwards, catching the side of Sherlock’s head as he tried to stop the tickling.  Sherlock fell back, groaning, as he held his head where John had elbowed him.  John sat up and pulled the t-shirt off, quickly soothing his friend and leaning in to kiss his head better.
“You are mocking me, John.”
“I guess you’d better come in.  How did you know what time I’d be finishing?”
“As always, you see but you do not observe.”  Sherlock winked at John.  “It began during our first rehearsal when I noticed how everyone was reacting to Jasmine.”
John sat down and smiled at him.
"Indeed."
“Bite me.  Please, Sherlock, bite me now.”
“Drama?  No, what gave you that idea?”
Nervous.  Why was he nervous - he didn't have nervous feelings?  He didn't allow any 'feelings' to interfere with his life.  That's what it appeared to be, though.  Butterflies in his stomach.  What a ridiculous analogy.  First of all, that would be a physical impossibility.  Secondly, in a bizarre world where butterflies could survive the passage down the alimentary canal, how would anyone know what that felt like?  Finally, even if that were a thing, it wouldn't be happening to him.
“No, John, no.  You are never to use that method again.  I’m banning feathers from the house.  Completely.  For ever.  Never to darken our doorway.”
I have included a photograph for you.  I looked up how to correctly wear a Keffiyeh in the brief slot of heavily censored internet access I was allowed, so I hope I have put it on correctly.  I would obviously need to use make-up to provide a tan to pull off a proper disguise, but I do not have access to any of my usual materials in here.
Mrs H did, indeed, seem very nice, you were quite correct.  I went there again this morning as you were also right about that coffee cake; it was delicious.  She mentioned that the tenant in her flat above the shop had just given in his notice that morning.  I’m thinking of accepting her offer to move in so that we have somewhere better than the squashed bed in my current uni digs when we get to spend time together.  She said she would only charge me a reasonably low rent as I had done her that favour of exposing her employee.  She also said it was because she could see how happy I obviously made you and that pleased her as you were always a favourite of hers. Would you like that; if we had a place to call our own?
John lifted said knuckle up to his mouth and kissed it where he could still see the slight imprint of Sherlock's teeth.  He sat up, wrinkling his nose as he looked at the sticky mess between them.  He eased his way off Sherlock, trying not to spread it any further and found some tissues to clean them up.  When they'd tidied themselves John lay down on his bed and opened his arms to Sherlock.  Sherlock didn't need to be asked twice and he was straight there, resting his head against John's chest.  He stroked his arm down John's chest, feeling the tautness of John's muscles.  John's own arm was around Sherlock's shoulders, sliding up and down his back as he revelled in the feel of the other boy against his skin.
“Well, that fact clearly wouldn’t impress you in this instance as the very nature of our meeting would tell me your occupation.  I could tell you that you started with a small firm first where your skills were not fully appreciated by the crew, but also by yourself as you doubted your own abilities.  You moved on to a bigger company where you worked for two, no, three years and gained some much needed confidence.  You have your own plane now as is obvious by our arrival here and you clearly work for the Lichtenstein royal family as evidenced by their insignia on your tail fin.  Your plane is amphibious as they do not have an airport so you clearly land on the large lake in the palace grounds.  You have also obviously performed some kind of service for my brother in the past for him to enlist you in such a sensitive matter.”
“Well, there’s one you might be interested in – vampires don’t need to breathe so my stamina for a blow job is legendary.”
"I believe that would count as services I have rendered so the reward would surely be mine to claim."
“Just because I am not in the rugby team, doesn’t mean I’m not strong, John.”
John kissed Sherlock on the nose then flipped him again and held him down while he kissed his way across Sherlock’s jaw and down to his neck.  When John reached the pulse point on Sherlock’s neck he felt an almost overwhelming instinct overtake him to bite down so he followed through and his fangs sank into Sherlock’s vein.  There wasn’t a lot of blood there as Sherlock hadn’t eaten at all recently; firstly because they had been on a case and then because he had been too worried about John to bother about himself.  What was there, though, John started sucking.  Sherlock felt himself going a bit woozy as he really had barely enough blood to keep himself going right now.  He had to stop John before he went too far because John was in the grip of a feeding frenzy and would not be able to stop himself.  Sherlock used the last of his strength to knee John in the balls and the need to curl up and protect himself even overtook the urge to bite and John released Sherlock’s neck as he rolled away.
“I know that.  I would always trust you to take care of me.”
Yours
Sherlock blushed at John’s compliment.  The differing attitude John had with regards to his deductions really didn’t get old.  He could see himself wanting to hear it always.
“Why are you putting yourself through this, Dr Watson?  All you need to do is tell us what Sherlock Holmes knows?”
"Well, I didn't say I wouldn't eat them, did I?"
“Did you work with DI Dimmock?  I remember him telling me about this bloke who knew everything about him and solved his crime after just a couple of minutes looking around the scene.”
“How amusing.  Thank Sherlock for his input but unless you have something else of importance I will leave the pair of you to continue your drunken games on your own.”
"Of course."  Sherlock had read this part when he had gone over it with John and knew how it flowed, so he started straight in, deepening his voice even lower and sounding all his words crisply just as a radio announcer would do.  When he stopped and looked around the others were all watching him.  He looked at Greg and raised his eyebrow.

“I think you already know the answer to that, John.”
"John, please.  Stop teasing."
"Is that all you want to do?"
“A while?  It’s been two bloody years!  I’ve been grieving for two years, Sherlock!”
“As do I, John.  New as this all is to me I can think of nothing or no-one that can make me feel as you do.”
“Are… are you sure?  I wouldn’t want to impose or make you uncomfortable.”
“It looked like a light there at the bottom left.  Can we look there first?”
He pushed the front door closed behind him and leaned against it for a moment, looking up towards the seventeen stairs in front of him and wondering if it might not just be easier to collapse here and spend the night with his head resting on the bottom step.  Only the thought that, hopefully, Sherlock would be home when he reached the top of those stairs impelled him onwards.  He grabbed hold of the rail and almost hauled himself up each one, his teeth still chattering as they tried to adjust to the slighter warmer air in the hall.
“Finally deliver!  You are an idiot.  But you’re my idiot.”
“Hey, what’s the hurry?”
"Of course, have at it.  I'll just be in the back if you need anything."
Sherlock raised his eyebrow.  “I fail to see how you will be able to stop anything I wish to do to you, John.”
Chapter One
“Excellent.  Let’s do that then.”
“It would certainly make things clearer if you did.”
“The army have a system of halfway housing for injured veterans to move in to whilst they’re recovering and looking for a more permanent situation, so they’ve set me up with a room there for the time being.”
John stood in place for a moment, his teeth gritted and his one fist clenching as he worked through his anger and tried not to think about the fact that he was holding Sherlock’s coat in his other hand.  When he could ignore it no longer, his glance slipped down briefly to look at the thick, dark material before snapping back up and staring straight ahead.  His friend’s coat – a coat he would never wear again.  He’d never flip that collar up, looking so cool and pretending not to notice what he was doing.  He breathed through his nose a few times then sucked in his breath and cleared his throat.
It happened every time.  John didn’t know what it was but somehow Sherlock just seemed to glow in the moonlight.  Make no mistake, it wasn’t that the smug git didn’t look amazing all the time, day or night; it was just that when the sun set there seemed to be something extra added to his natural allure.  In the sun Sherlock was quite pale and usually had his sunglasses on as he had a sensitivity to the bright daylight.  He wasn’t too bad when it was cloudy or grey which, let’s be honest, was quite a regular occurrence in London, but when the sun was full out John often saw Sherlock wincing and moving to stand in the shade to get some relief.  He never let that stop him when he was at a crime scene, of course, nothing would come between him and the work.
“Yes, I’m sure certain people will be very relieved to hear that news.  Now, shall we return to my office and look into this other matter that still requires our attention.”
By Joolz
Sherlock eventually went back to his own room and they both fell asleep, alone but sweetly sated.  Needless to say, the following morning John aced his biology test.  He smiled as he thought to himself that they would definitely have to use that method of revision again.
John just stared at Sherlock, jaw dropped, eyes wide. He shook his head.   "How...? You got all that from one look?  That was bloody amazing. But... how did you know that I like boys?"
He tried to think about what he had been doing before he fell asleep but his mind was a bit foggy.  It slowly clarified and he remembered being kidnapped and Sherlock rescuing him and coming home from the hospital.  So who was he lying on then?  It couldn’t be…?  John opened his eyes and then rapidly closed them again.  It was; it bloody was!  Why was he lying on Sherlock?  Had he messed everything up?
“What would you like to do next?”
“Did not so!”
"I don't think he works weekends as a rule.  He isn't a live-in teacher; I think I remember him saying he lived in the village so he only comes up when he has lessons or if he has a special project on.  We'll have to wait 'til after class tomorrow and go and speak to him then."
“Well, come with me anyway and you can give me some moral support.”
“He would never do that.  He values your company too much.”
John sat back up for a moment, leant forward to give Sherlock a long, slow kiss and looked into his eyes.  Sherlock smiled back at him, knowing what was coming; just as he’d known all along what had happened to John today and exactly what he had needed to make the world right again.
“Why don’t we sit down and you tell us your decision first; let you get that out of the way before we begin.”
“About three months ago when Sherlock decided he wanted to include biting in our sexual repertoire and believe me I have never looked back since.”
“I’m sorry, John.”
“Of course.  I would expect nothing less.  We’re a team, John, and we have new horizons to explore.  Onwards and upwards.”
It was about eight thirty when John finally stirred, his groan calling forth Sherlock’s attention.
I don’t necessarily imagine writing to me can really be the highlight of your day but I will persist if it gives you some small respite.  At the moment I am thinking that if not taking the drugs will keep me out of a cesspit like this then it may even be worth it, so I will keep your request in mind.
Sherlock took his time getting ready and left for school at their normal time.  There was no sign of John when he got there but he didn’t let it bother him as John had said he’d see him later.  He would wait.
Jasmine was the obvious first thought, as she was the person under it at the time it fell, but whoever cut the wire wouldn't have been able to tell exactly when it would fall.  He or she couldn't have timed it exactly for that moment.  John, himself, had been standing in just that spot when he had entered the scene, and Sherlock shuddered when he thought of John being injured in that way.  He whizzed through the play quickly in his mind, picturing where everyone stood throughout the play.  He had to come to the conclusion that at some point in the action, everyone passed under the chandelier, but it certainly seemed as if Jasmine was in that position the most.
John followed him over and watched as Sherlock carefully unwrapped the cloth and examined the frog from all angles before he even touched it.  The boys spent a very pleasant afternoon of experimentation, with John putting forward ever more outlandish theories just to see the way Sherlock wrinkled his nose in exasperation.
Thank you for writing so quickly.  It lightened what could have been a very dull day as I woke up without you in my bed for the first time in a week.
Greg laughed.  He did know what Sherlock was like and that hadn’t changed with his new knowledge.
“It’s probably actually a good thing.  It gave me time to think about everything whilst you were sleeping it all off.  I have to admit that, to my own surprise, I was intrigued by the idea of pursuing things further so if you wish to try something then I am happy to accede.”
Sherlock spun into the room as he spoke and lashed out against the thug standing in front of John.  He kicked him hard, the point of his shoe connecting with the side of his knee, felling him to his knees in one hit.  The rapidity of the action and the shock of seeing someone burst in unexpectedly had left the man too stunned to provide an immediate response.  The chance was quickly taken away from him as Sherlock followed up with an upper cut, sending the man’s head snapping back at the impact and he collapsed to the floor in a heap, unconscious and no longer a threat.
John snuggled a bit closer to his pillow, enjoying the warmth against his skin.  It felt a little harder than normal but the gentle movement up and down was restful.  Moving up and down?  What was he on about?  Was he dreaming about a boat?  No; his pillow was definitely moving and he could hear a steady beat under his ear too.  Almost sounded like a heartbeat.  It was a heartbeat.  Oh hell; where was he now?  He hadn’t gone home with someone had he?
“Don’t need to take ‘nythin’, I’ve got you.”  John grinned at him and his head slipped down onto Sherlock’s shoulder.
When Sherlock judged that John was getting near he leant down to kiss him, wanting as much body contact as possible.  John raised his knees, feet flat on the floor, to give Sherlock something to push against and to improve the angle for Sherlock, making sure to hit his prostate on every thrust.  Sherlock loved this position and liked to come from just the friction of his own cock rubbing between their bellies.  He rested his elbows on the floor next to John’s head and John brought his hands up to Sherlock’s hips to help propel him forward.
It was for a ten year reunion for Sandhurst Military Academy where he had done his officer candidate training and had obviously come about after his meeting last week with a fellow attendee, Greg Lestrade.  Greg had been a big pal of his own at the Academy but they had lost touch whilst John had been away.  Greg had finished his training at the same time as John and been all set to join the Military Police when his mother had been taken very ill and he, being her only relative, had taken over her care.  He had moved back home and decided to transfer across to the regular police force instead so that he wouldn’t get posted abroad and have to leave her on her own.
John pulled back in shock, stared up at Sherlock right in front of him, then groaned as his eyes closed tightly and his hand flew up to hold his head.
“He always was a bit of a demon at poker.  Cleared me out a few times before I caught on to his tell; now we’re probably about evenly matched.  Maybe I could happen upon this casino and play a hand or two.  He never could resist a challenge.  Might be the perfect way to get to him.”
John calmed down a little at hearing Sherlock's words.  It was nice to know that he was constantly in the thoughts of this incredible man.  Of course, he knew that there were never less than about ten thoughts whirling around in that head at one time, but to be one of them was an achievement in itself.
I have a map of London in my head and frequently walk the streets and alleyways to keep everything current.  St Barts is an area I have studied thoroughly so I’m sure I would be familiar with all your usual haunts.  Of course, many alterations may have been made in the month and a half I have been away.  I can’t wait to get out of here again, if only to get back to the heart of my city.
“Oh no!”  John’s one half-good eye focused down to his chest.  “There’s been a robby… a robobery.”
“I’m sorry, has there been some sort of misunderstanding?”
John cleared everything away and took hold of the basket with one hand and Sherlock with the other and they slowly made their way back to the villa.  Mme Lapion had left them a light meal which they ate before going to sit out on the veranda to enjoy the early evening air.  John insisted that they have an early night as Sherlock had had the long walk to the beach and back as well as walking along the shore to see the caves.
John edged just the head of his cock into Greg and it pushed Greg forwards so that he felt Sherlock close his mouth around him.  John started a slow rocking motion, pushing himself inside Greg a little further each time and making Sherlock swallow a little more of Greg’s cock each time as Greg thrust forward too.  Soon John was fully buried inside Greg and he stopped for a minute to enjoy the tight heat grasping his shaft and give Greg a moment to adjust to being filled.
“Before I go into his motives, may I ask you a question?”
Greg had been just knocking off duty so the pair of them had gone to Greg’s local and downed a few pints whilst they caught up on what the other had been doing in the last ten years.  Greg had told him about the reunion and said he’d mention it to the organisers as they’d been trying to get together as many former classmates as possible and obviously lost contact with John since his discharge.
He remembered when they had made up the code.  Sherlock had thought it slightly ridiculous but John had pointed out that they might need a way to communicate messages which would not be intercepted by other people.  Their system had worked successfully with coded phrases as John had reminded Sherlock about using ‘Vatican Cameos’ when they had been confronted by the CIA in the case with The Woman.  He had finally acceded to John’s wishes and they constructed their coded language.  Though Sherlock had tried to pretend he found it juvenile, John knew he’d actually enjoyed doing it and they often left messages about mundane matters like buying milk just to practice.
“Sorry, sorry.”  John laughed and kissed Sherlock.  “Yes I’m sure,” kiss “and yes it’s right,” kiss “and yes I loved the bite,” kiss “and … yes I think I might love you too.”
I was just putting this in the box to be posted when they came through with the leave entitlements so I can let you know now that my leave will actually be from the 3rd – 10th April.  If you are free at any time in that week I would love to actually get to properly meet you.
“The others should be here soon.  Sally was just sorting the photocopying which she and Anderson had done so the scripts should be ready.  I wanted to give everyone their own copy right away so they could get started on learning their lines; the sooner we’re off book the easier it’ll be to work on the staging.  She should be here in a minute.”
Sherlock smiled and started exactly where he was.  He wasn’t joking when he said he wanted to taste John everywhere so he picked up the hand John had been waving in the air and sucked the thumb into his mouth.  He swirled his tongue around the strong digit, sliding up and down the length.  John groaned as he vividly imagined Sherlock swirling his tongue around another appendage in just that manner.
Rather than suck on Sherlock’s eagerly bobbing cock, as he had obviously meant, John climbed up Sherlock’s body and sat on his abdomen.  From there he could reach up and take one of Sherlock’s fingers into his mouth and he sucked it in exactly the same way as he had been doing with his own.   Sherlock moaned and shook his head.  John pulled back and hovered over Sherlock, looking down at him and grinning.
“That will please John that he was able to assist with her recovery.  It always made him very grumpy whenever he spoke to her in that state and could do nothing to help her.”
“You were dead.  There was blood everywhere and you had no pulse.”
“I do, I do, please.”
"Yes, it's all gone brilliantly; we've been having great fun, and hopefully tonight will be just as good.  I certainly hope you enjoy it, anyway."
Sherlock looked dumbstruck.  He had never had anyone stand up for him like that before.  John stroked his cheek when he saw that look.
They grinned at each other and settled down into the bed.  John turned off the light as they had the curtains open, letting in the light of the large moon and it wasn’t long before Sherlock’s exhaustion took over and he was fast asleep.  John turned on his side.  He couldn’t help staring at the man beside him.  How was it possible that his miracle wish had been answered and Sherlock had come back into his life?  What was more, it seemed like he had missed John as much as he had been missed himself.
“I would never have said I preferred anything of anyone else above what I like of yours.”
Mycroft looked across at Sherlock and took in the almost imperceptible (to anyone but him) show of feeling and pride on Sherlock’s face, that John had stood up for him already.  He didn’t say anything but he was glad that Sherlock finally had someone that obviously knew and accepted him for what he was, and who was able to bring out the best in him, with seemingly little effort.  He gave a slight twitch of his lip in Sherlock’s direction, letting him know that he approved.  Though Sherlock would never deign to show it, or admit to it out loud, deep down he still sought such acknowledgement from the brother he had worshipped when he was four.  A subtle darkening at the top of his cheeks told Mycroft that the message was received and accepted.
Sherlock started to shake his head but John shepherded him out from his seat.  "You'll need to replenish your energy if you're going to swing me round the floor again.  I want to see if I can impress you with my moves when I'm not worrying about tripping you up after each step."
“I’m fine.”
Whilst he was up he also had a shower and relieved his earlier tension before going to see about a cup of tea and some breakfast with which to start their day.
John’s fingers twitched as though he would reach towards his flatmate if he could.  Sherlock correctly interpreted the movement and put the cup of tea on the table beside John, and leant forward to envelop him in a deep hug.  John’s nose rested in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and he inhaled the essence of everything that was Sherlock and he finally started to relax.  Everything was right with the world.  He had Sherlock and he was home.
John shuddered as he thought of what else could have befallen him; he had been lucky indeed.  “
“Well, how about something backstage, then we’d still be able to go to rehearsals together?”
“Well, him, of course.  Who else do you think I’d be talking about?”
“200… 200 years, are you kidding me?”
“No, he didn’t say anything to me?  He only told me to text him back when I found what he wanted; that was it.”
To take the first photograph - That was indeed at our favourite café near Barts – I’m stunned that you could recognise it from that.  I did date that girl, Sarah, for two months but we mutually decided we were better as friends so we ended it.  I thought she was as happy with that decision as I was, but now you’ve made me question it.  She wrote to me when I was doing basic training to say that she had started dating another junior doctor at the hospital so I think we can definitely call time on that one.
“Who says I would not be prepared to provide that which I have offered?”  Sherlock winked at him.
Hey Sherlock
"Can you blame me?  Even the thought of you inside me makes me hard so what it'll actually be like when you're there..." John kissed Sherlock's nose and grinned at him.  "That was a hint for you to get on with it, by the way."
Instead, he had decided on his plan of action; to get himself established and respected and to come back to Sherlock as a successful man.  Well, so much for that plan.  He was ruined.  What was he to do with himself now?  He turned his head in to the pillow to absorb the single tear that gathered in the corner of his eye.
“You mean the very rare, lesser spotted, felinicus stabilis eagle?”
“I choose me kissing you on the neck.”
After a lot of fumbling they eventually managed to undress each other and John jumped on to the bed with his feet on the pillow and patted the space next to him for Sherlock to join him.  Sherlock lay down the opposite way up and put his head on John’s bent thigh.  John lifted his head for Sherlock to slip his own thigh underneath and they were soon comfortably settled in the same position but upside down.
"That was one time, John; honestly, must you bring it up constantly?"
John couldn’t really get any redder and he stuttered out another apology.
“Would you allow me to hear it?”
"Why don't you try this one?  I always have them just buttered when they're fresh out of the oven because they're so melty but once they've cooled a little I prefer them with this damson jam that Mrs H makes herself.  It makes them even better, if you can believe that."
John kicked and rolled and just ducked in time to avoid a shotgun blast which blew a hole in the wall barely above his head.  Sherlock waited ‘til the shot had been fired then pulled a similar roll in the other direction though it didn’t have quite the same military precision as John’s effort.  The second cartridge tore into the material of Sherlock’s coat as it flipped up behind him but luckily just missed its intended target.
“John, don’t spread such vicious lies.  You’ll ruin my reputation.”
He had to stop when he got close to the under arm because every time he tried to trail his tongue along the skin, John got too ticklish and his arm reflexively shot back down and he caught Sherlock on the top of the head twice.  After profuse apologies following the second hit, John just asked him to maybe leave that bit alone.  Sherlock held John’s arm aloft and leaned in close and looked at the pattern of skin and took a deep inhale.
“Of course not, I’m happy for you to take as long as you need.”
"Keep still, Lestrade.  I'll stop him in a minute.  He just needs some fresh blood to help seal the wound."
“It was, unfortunately, necessary that Sherlock be seen to die and for your grief and mourning to be observed as genuine.”
One day they went out on the lake, taking turns to row each other about, and stopping for lunch on the little island in the middle of the lake.  They sat under the shade of a small gazebo with perfect views of the surrounding park land.  On another occasion, they cadged a lift with Mycroft and went down to London for the day, showing each other their favourite places.
“Dull!  I had to go through the same nonsense when I was in rehab.  Total waste of time.”
"I'm sorry; I don't think anyone heard that.  Perhaps you'd like to try again?"
"No, Mike and Molly wanted some privacy and we'll have some too if we sit over here."
There was a doorway in the centre of the wall in front of him and, through the open door, John could see into Sherlock’s bedroom; to the stately looking four poster bed with matching side tables and lamps.  While the living room was done in gold tones and dark reds, giving it a warm lived in atmosphere; the bedroom was all in deep blue tones with colour coordinated pillows providing a cool, sophisticated appearance.  The wood throughout the suite was a dark teak or mahogany and it was all well-built and solid, obviously antique, most probably family heirlooms.  Only the home entertainment system and the laboratory equipment looked brand new.
“That would, perhaps, be better all round, then.  I’d feel happier not having to worry about interruptions, or whether we make any untoward noises.”
As it was Christmas time, the organisers had decided to make it a masquerade ball and John hadn’t been at all sure if he wanted to even bother attending.  The note that Greg had enclosed with the invite was making him doubt it even more.  Greg had said ‘Don’t worry about the Plus One, I’ve booked us a couple of partners.’  What did that mean – booked?  He surely hadn’t hired escorts for the evening, had he?  John was sure he wouldn’t dazzle anyone walking in with his stupid limp, let alone be able to spin them around the dance floor.  What had Greg been thinking?
Sherlock lifted John’s head and his eyes seemed as if they were struggling to focus.  He put his hand on John’s cheek to hold his face upright and John tried to turn his head and kiss Sherlock’s palm but Sherlock was holding quite tightly.  All he could manage was to make kissing motions with his lips into thin air.  Sherlock moved John to a nearby chair and knelt in front of him, which got the attention of some of the others, and the dancing slowly stopped as more and more of them saw something was going on.  Greg came over to see what was happening.
