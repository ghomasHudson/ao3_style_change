The boy stills and pulls at his gag. Dean frowns reluctantly, undoing it.
Castiel looks up at Dean. “P-p-pleased-don't hurt me, ” Cas begs.
"Please," Sam begs, throwing his head back again.
That summer when the brothers are home alone while their dad is working, Dean starts taking his anger out on Sam instead of birds and stray cats. Sam knows his brother is hurting so he doesn't fight back.
Dean shakes his head, “When you were 14 you knew better already. But then again I did start training long before then,” Dean admits shrugging. “You’ll need to check on Cas’ bucket later. He for some reason decides to chug all the water I gave him instead of saving it. He has a lot to learn,” Dean states cutting into his steak.
The men say their goodbyes and Sam heads inside. The first thing he does is clean up the mess still in the kitchen. He swept up the glass from the broken coffee pot. He picked the splintered wood from the broken chair. Tidying was difficult with only one arm.
Time passes, Cas doesn't know how long. It must’ve been awhile. He's sitting up, Dean's hands were in his hair, the boy looks him in the eyes and blinks slowly. "I thought you fell asleep on me." Dean admits with an annoyance in his voice.
“What is it, baby?” Dean asks but here's no concern in his voice.
After a few minutes of pushing his eggs around the plate, he looked up and locked eyes with his brother. His mouth went dry! Dean was leaning against the doorframe watching him.
"Any news on when you're getting out?"
He hears footsteps, "I already told you to leave me alone. I don't need some stupid bitch getting involved in my life, " he asserts exhausted.
Sam reluctantly nods, his body tensing. "But that's really none of your business" He replies coldly.
Dean gets himself behind the boy, "Oh baby...we haven't even started yet and you're already crying? Today is gonna be so rough on you," with one hand on the boy's back holding him in place, he undoes his jeans with the other, taking his belt all the way out. He doesn't want to stop bruising Cas. He folds over the leather bringing his arm all the way back. He lays the first whack. He loves the way Cas squirms under his hand and the screams as he lays each lash down. "You're lucky I don't make you count them!"  Dean yells over the screams and sobs.
Dean stops being happy. He stops wanting to watch TV with Sam. Sammy does his best to cheer his brother up nothing works very well.
"I'm filing a report with Adult Protective Services!" She yells, leaving with a huff. Sam is so overwhelmed with emotions. Nothing will come of that. Stupid bitch is wasting her time. He hates this, he hates everything about this. It's bullshit! He should be at home with the man he loves, not here. Fuck this stupid hospital. Why did Castiel have to say no? What the fuck was that kid thinking? He's happy Cas is sorry and forgives him of course. Sam just wishes he were at home to help with the boy's training. Without Sam to guide him Castiel will just end up dead.
Dean goes to spoon with Cas the boy pulls away and Dean slaps him, knocking him off the bed. "Fine, no cuddles for you. Stupid fucking whore." He stands and fixes his fly, storming out of the room, leaving his angel sobbing on the floor.
He hears a loud feral scream from right beside him and that's what gets him to snap his head up. Castiel was being dragged by his hair up onto the bed. The boy’s hysterical. He’s gonna get himself killed!  Sam begins to panic. He pleads and shouts to his brother. “Dean, take me instead!”
The man's thoughts are cut off again by a knock on his door frame. This time it's his social worker. He groans. "Take a hint and fuck off! " he snaps.
Dean doesn't last very long.  Either because of the distraction of driving or because Sam's just that good. Sam can't help but pridefully assume it’s the latter. Sam roots around in the glove box, “Dean there's no tissues in here”.
Cas is hungry enough he'll do anything for food. Sam told him sex can just be a job, he was insistent about that. If he tries hard enough, maybe it’ll work for him too. He needs to behave in order to survive.
He breaks the kiss and then Balthazar nibbles at his lobe, holding him tight between his arms. Castiel feels safe.
He softly brushes the bare skin of his left shoulder, tracing with his fingertips the ghost edges of a scar that used to be there. Dean closes his eyes and tries to stop the painful lump in his throat, but everything hurts and the hole he feels in his chest will never be filled again.
Dean seems to be satisfied by his words and then lowers his head a little, putting his lips closer to his hands, just an inch away from them. His breath brushes him and Cas shivers in anticipation.
Dean shakes his head and gives him a small push, making him move his legs. Balthazar complies.
It’s always been about knowing how to hear and Castiel has always known how to do that.
“I’m sorry. I’m
The wind dishevels his hair while he kneels in front of the dusted grave, brushing aside the roots wrapped around the cold cement.
“It’s his name in Enochian.”
“I overreacted last night. I shouldn’t have attacked you like that.” his shoulders bend for a brief moment and then straighten again, leaving Cas dazed.
“I can’t lose something I never had.”
“NO.”
“So… apparently Kansas has been invaded by an army of Wildlings.” Dean gives him a dirty look and Sam sniggers. “A den of vampires.” he clarifies, taking the beer cap and launching it towards the trash can.
Dean’s finally looking at him and there’s a new light in his green irises. Castiel feels himself getting lost in them. Getting lost in his hope.
Their lips smack against each other and Cas tightens his fist when he hears his raspy voice against her ear, whispering dirty words against her shell.
is free will.
Dean pretends not to feel the dampness wetting his cheeks when he continues to speak.
Then the red tambourines arrive, and the color alternation is lost.
The wind rises.
He’s alone now and the shack has never seemed emptier.
The devotion, the attachment, the
“Nothing.”
“I think we should go inside.”
Castiel snaps his gaze on his features, his lower lip trembling with fear, and lowers his arms, resting his fingertips on his chest.
He’s content with his life, he’s content with himself.
Without saying a word he rests his hand on his thigh, making Cas shiver and gasp in search of oxygen. His touch is hot against him and Cas can distinctly feel it through the fabric when it starts to follow the fold of his pants, going higher and higher.
After three months worth of painting and Dean-did-not-want-to-know-how-many-dollars-worth- of-paint, their mural was finally complete, and Dean almost cried tears of joy. It’s not that Dean didn’t enjoy this little project of theirs, cause he did. He loved dancing around their bedroom, listening to Cas belt out the lyrics to some of Whitney Houston’s greatest hits. He loved teaching Cas how to mix paint and how to paint certain shapes by standing behind his boyfriend, putting his hand on Cas’ hands and guiding him, especially when those lessons turned into messy make-out sessions (and how could they not when Dean pressed up against Cas and their faces were so close together and their breaths mingled in the air?). Dean even loved, in a twisted, sort of masochistic way, when they’d argue and settled it with a paint war, which, more often than not, ended in messy make-out sessions or even messier blow job sessions. Dean loved how much Cas reverted to his old, pre-incident self the most. But as much as he enjoyed all of that, he enjoyed the satisfaction of finishing a piece just as much. So much so that when the mural was complete, he wrapped an arm around Cas’ shoulder and looked around their freshly painted bedroom in awe and when Cas came up with the idea of painting the ceiling, Dean almost cried.
Claire gave a full-body eye roll. “I know, I know. ‘Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.’”
and that’s when Castiel starts to feel the chair digging into his skin and he releases his grip on the metal. He briefly looks at the angry red and pink lines where the metal had left imprints on their skin and resigns themself to massaging his hands.
"Really, Dean? A bucket of water over the door?" Sam burst into another fit of laughter at Dean's ridiculousness.
She mumbles something that sounds like, “
"Did you really believe I wouldn't see the bucket of water perched on top of your door?" Cas' eyes shone with amusement as he quirked the corner of his lips and tilted his head.
"No," he replies, tipping with another bill, "But that doesn’t mean I'm gonna stand here and let you disrespect this young lady who’s just tryin’ to do her job."
Claire, seemingly fed up with their staring, speaks up, “Great, now that we’ve established y’all
Sometimes, when Cas was in one of those moods where he went on and on about the symbolism behind the flowers he planted in his garden, way back when, Dean got distracted by the way his boyfriend’s eyes lit up; that was the happiest Cas had been since he found out about his garden. So if the mural took longer to complete than it should have because Dean loved how excited Cas was again, it was damn worth the months they couldn’t sleep in their bedroom properly.
” the woman screeches. “I worked at a Baskin Robbins in Mississippi
quick, Dean set out to paint their shared bedroom with Cas’ help.
Castiel ignores the profanity in favor of letting Claire express her feelings. If her mother were here, she’d balk at Claire’s vulgar language, but even Amelia would be pleased that their teenage daughter is confiding in her parents.
Jimmy Novak should have been a simple man: with a wife, a daughter, a dog, and a ruined white fence he should have painted years ago.
In less than a minute everything’ll become normal again.
He’s serene, everything in his body screams that he’s serene.
“I’ve done what it had to be done.” He whispers, hissing and squinting his eyelids shut when he feels a pressure against the knife. “I couldn’t let Michael win. I couldn’t let anyone of you die.
Yet he swears he can feel the ghost touch of a mouth against his dry lips.
"We're half of one soul, you know? All those crappy rom-com Sammy loves to watch on tv, they're kinda us." His eyes suddenly become shiny and Castiel has never hated himself more in his entire existence.
"I'm just... sorry."
When his lips rest on hers, Cas feels a weird pain in his chest, an ache that squeezes his heart.
‘Holly Jolly Christmas’ starts playing in the background and Cas places his phone on the small coffee table they bought together during the beginning of the winter sales. He turns up the volume and sits back on the sofa, Peanut is comfortably resting on his chest. He meets Dean’s eyes and beams at him when he notices what he’s holding in his hands.
“What do you mean?”
Maybe is the light in his green irises when he continues to stare at his brother’s back until he doesn’t turn the corner, leaving his sight.
Cas stares bewildered at Dean, with his eyelashes flickering gently against his cheek, while he gently parts his lips with his tongue, tasting him.
Castiel grinds back and when Dean feels his erection poking at his belly, a needy whimper escapes from his throat, making Cas growls in possessiveness.
would’ve been for make your opponent believe that your game was poor, so he would’ve betted against you and you could’ve have called, raising with a higher price.”
Castiel’s eyes
Their cocks touch for the first time, skin on skin, and Cas growls.
“I can’t sleep.”
“I-“ and suddenly he feels a low pressure against his right cheek, that forces him to turn his head. “It felt-“ Dean smiles, encouraging him to continue and Cas gulps steadily before saying his next words. “It felt right.”
The artificial light illuminates just a small portion of the deserted road.
go to him yesterday, didn’t you?” he asks confused.
“Cas—"
Their eyes meet for one last time when Dean grabs the knob, slightly turning it to the left.
“What were you thinking about?” he glares at him, flaring his nostrils in anger when he corners him against the wall.
survive, he just feels the same bittersweet smile on his face, pulling briefly at his lips when he closes his eyes.
“You can’t know it.” Dean pushes Cas out of his way, taking a step forward threatening. “I don’t care what you think you know,
“Yes.”
Cas smiles softly and then, raising his chin, he rests the money on the table.
“Do it.” He swallows and brings back a hand, spreading his left cheek. “If this is what you need, just do it.”
The snap of their hips, the slap of skin against skin and their ragged breaths are the only noises that fill the room.
Suddenly Dean grasps his wrist, stilling him and reversing their position, positioning himself on top of him until his cock slips between his crack.
The laugh that erupts from Castiel’s mouth is a raspy one, his shoulders shake with false amusement and the hoarse sound seems to sink with its claws inside his ear, making him shudder in uneasiness.
His voice is a whimper and Castiel knows that everything will never be the same.
“At least she’s not a whore.” he strengthens his grip and Castiel buckles, groaning and biting hard the skin under Dean’s ear.
“Castiel.”
“I was just doing what I had to do.”
“One last thing-“ Cas begins, smiling guiltily when Dean glares at him.
“I’m not gonna decorate that thing.” Dean glares at Sam when he brings inside two big boxes with clinking trinkets, probably Christmas balls to hang on the branches.
His brother beams widely when he enters in the room and drops his jacket on the backrest of the chair.
Sam just sighs when the door closes behind his shoulders and then sits on Dean’s bed, taking a deep breath before starting to talk again.
Dean keeps his eyes shut when she puts her hands in his hair, pulling him closer. She kisses him open-mouthed and when he moans pushing her against the wall, Cas moves his gaze away, taking a step back and gulping loudly when he hears her panting.
When he raises his gaze he meets Dean’s eyes that are staring at him emotionless.
Loved faces, now lost.
The radio is croaking old Christmas songs and he thins his lips when he sees Sam entering in the room with a string of unlit lights and a scotch roll that he holds with his teeth.
“Am I disturbing you?” Dean’s voice is soft, almost shy when he reaches him, climbing over a black bag left in the middle of the floor.
"Don't." Cas’ voice is harsh in his ears and Dean’s eyes flicker across the room, losing their certainty and stability.
He’s alone.
“Touch me.” Dean whispers and Cas stops altogether his movement, staring at him in disbelief. “Please, touch me.” he repeats without meeting his eyes, with his cheeks growing redder.
Castiel looks hard at the position Dean has assumed and frowns slightly, thinning his lips thoughtfully.
When Dean turns him, roughly lowering his pants and slipping one finger inside him, Castiel just smiles.
“I totally had to choose the whiny one, didn’t I?”
“Don’t worry.” he smiles bitterly. “I get it. I don’t blame you, Cas. I could never blame
The chattering seems to be fading away around them.
A grimace spreads on his face against his will.
“You’re boring.”
His fingers pass between his scalp and Cas lets himself go when Dean caresses his jaw, cupping his face.
He feels Dean’s hands trying to escape from him and after increasing briefly his strength again he releases them, putting a hand on his shoulder and pressing him against the wall, gluing their bodies together.
“What?”
Dean turns towards him and arches an eyebrow questioning.
He paints a fake smile on his lips and then is voice seems to be brighter and louder.
When Dean opens his eyes again, the cold spot on the mattress makes him shiver.
do when they lie on a bed then
“And how do I know when I want to?”
With a sharp gesture of his hand Castiel flings open a door and burst into the room, glaring at the two half naked women and at the completely naked man who doesn’t even bother to cover himself. He’s just staring back at him, with an amused expression on his face and a challenging look in his eyes.
“It’s cool, man. Don’t you worry.”
“Thank you for pointing out the obvious.”
“He has made his choice.”
“Tell me why you need it.”
“I’m listening, Cassie. There’s no need to call my name so many times.” He sits on the bed and stretches a leg to put his trousers on, but then he stops and raises his head. “Unless you want to scream it in a more enjoyable way.” He winks at him before starting to get dressed again. Castiel looks away for a single moment and tries to ignore the dim flush on his cheeks when Balthazar pronounces his next words. “I sawed it off, I told you. What do you even need it for?”
Castiel’s heart thumps steadily against his ribcage when Dean returns moments later, putting his laptop on the table and starting the song with a flick on the mouse pad.
“I have to go.”
They’re both staring at the space in front of them.
He stays out all night.
And suddenly Cas knows, he knows when Dean raises his head challenging, trying to get him pissed off more, he knows when Dean’s pupils dilates when his lips hover above his and his green irises are totally hidden by the blackness caused by the lust.
“What the hell, man?” He wipes some dry leaves off his head, cringing when he feels on his hands dust and mud, and glares at him. “Who did you take me for: Bacchus?”
“Sam, leave it. Just… leave it.”
Cas stops talking and stares at him with widened eyes.
“Do you?”
“And with the red tambourines?”
Sam had asked him to find Dean, he was
He closes the gap between their mouths and slams their skin together, increasing his strength on his wrists and slipping a leg between Dean’s, making him moan in surprise.
“He’s so devoted, isn’t he?” he asks more to himself than to anyone else, but the reaction he draws out of the man next to him makes him turns his head curious.
Cas drops his arms against his sides and takes a step forward, shoving a finger between the slots of the cage and briefly caressing Peanut’s head.
“What has happened here?” he gestures towards all the trinkets spread on the ground and with one look he questions Dean’s sanity when he puts the two balls between his hands.
“What do you want?” He pushes the words one after the other, harsh. Balthazar shrugs and slightly tilts his head to one side, studying him for a brief moment before carefully choosing his next move. He reaches into his pocket and Dean holds his breath, waiting. Balthazar pulls out a silver plate and slowly caress its rounded edges. “What is that?” Dean asks dazzled and Balthazar silently gives it to him.
Castiel gulps steadily and when he sees Dean’s red and swollen lips, with trembling fingers, he gazes the button of his jeans, unfastening it and taking the zip down.
“Are you cold?”
“I’ll come with you tonight. I just have to take care of something and then I’ll see you there.”
He leaves the room.
He’s alone and he doesn’t want to be.
“Cas-“
“I said: Isn’t he, Cas?”
Sam reaches for him and patting his thigh makes him move his leg to sit beside him.
Sam reaches him and takes the container, slightly sniffing its content before taking the spoon and putting it in his mouth. He raises his eyebrows.
Cas sniffles and tighten his grip on his shoulders, closing his eyes to hold back the tears. Dean takes a step back and raises his head, looking deeply into his eyes.
The head of his cock slips against him and Castiel raises on his hands and knees, showing himself to Dean and resting his forehead on the sheets.
Cas moans again when Dean sucks his fingers into his mouth, the feeling of his tongue is heavy against him and his cock starts to stir against his pants.
“Your brother has arrived, don’t you have work to do?”
Sam nods and hands him a transparent box, that Jack takes between his hands and starts to open.
Slipping a finger on his waistband he lowers his briefs, making his cock’s head stick out red and shiny at the tip, with a drop of pre-come shining through the light.
“I don’t have time to waste, Balthazar.” He crosses his arms and arches an eyebrow. “Where is it?” a sudden laugh erupts from the other man and Castiel’s frown deepens when he sees Balthazar shaking his head. “What?”
Dean joins them, sitting around the map table, and passes a beer to Sam, brushing slightly against Cas.
A loud crash, a sudden squeak and Cas doesn’t have the time to widen his eyes that a brownish furball is running towards him.
“Cas-“
“Only if you wanted to.”
“I think you should go away.”
“Dean-“
“What?” Castiel asks, genuinely confused. Sam is packing up in the other side of the room and he’s giving them his shoulder, too focused on what he’s doing to listen to them.
Sam finds him still praying when he arrives.
“Don’t be shy.”
, Dean?”
The building that stands in front of their eyes is relatively quiet, nobody pushes the heavy doors to exit and nobody climbs the two steps to enter.
A couple at the back attracts his eyes, they’re half hidden by a marble column and he can’t exactly distinguish their features, yet the cozy atmosphere, the warm bubble in which they’re enclosed, is clear enough to make Cas curious about their relation.
Dean is snoring.
“Cas.” Sam’s voice curls gravely around the name, making Dean shudder.
“Balthazar stays.” A huge smile starts to paint on his lips, but Castiel just ignores him and continues. “What do you need from me?” His hand presses harder against his back, annoyed.
“I’ve had this ring since the day of your birthday back in January, but I never found a perfect occasion and-“
“Yes?”
“What?”
“Guys,” Dean’s firm voice stops their snooping and the both of them raise their heads, staring at him with confusion in their eyes. “the lights
Sam always gulps when he sees the lingering touches, the hands caressing with reverence the shoulder of the other while they casually pass, and he tries to hide his face with his long hair, lowering his gaze and not wanting to intrude in the bubble of their shared resonance.
“You’re a killer joy, you know that?” he asks rhetorically, wiggling his eyebrows towards Cas “Isn’t he, Cas?”
“We’re going to buy him a proper kennel. I can’t stand the thought that he has to live in there.” His words are gruff, but there’s a hint of softness on the edges.
“I thought that I had found my place in the world, a place
"Please."
He lays down his body next to the djinn’s and closes his eyes for a brief moment when he sees his chapped lips stained with blood.
“Can we decorate the tree with those blue bows?”
A strange tingling on his fingertips makes him clench his fist, and when Dean calls him again, he snaps his eyes on his face.
“Cool!”
A sudden touch on his left wrist stops him and soon Cas’s hand cups his cheek, making him turn. He loses himself in the blue eyes that are staring at him and he feels his heart starting to hammer in his chest when Cas gets closer. He conjoins their lips in a soft kiss and Dean just melts in it.
Balthazar brushes his neck with his fingers and Castiel stiffen, before relaxing his shoulders and turning a page. He checks Dean’s reaction from the corner of his eye, but he’s in the distance talking with his brother and he doesn’t seem to be affected. Balthazar presses his fingers against a nerve and Castiel shifts his neck, making him more room, so he starts to massage the part. There’s a short break in Dean’s word when Castiel releases a sigh of pleasure, but then he resumes the conversation as if nothing happened.
“That’s what we do.”
“D-Dean.”
, what makes a human
Another giggle bursts out of his lips.
“Do you have it?”
“What about him?”
“Cas, I-“ Sam chokes his words when he sees Castiel clenching his fist unconsciously as soon as he hears his voice.
“Can’t we put them after we’ve-“
“We’re in the middle of the XVII century, at the court of Louis XIV, and the only thing you can think about is” Balthazar takes a deep breath “the
“Cas-“
He sucks more and then he puts a finger inside him, closing his eyes when he feels the warmth that surrounds his digit. Dean’s cock twitches inside his mouth, making him leak at the head more pre-come.
“Why?” Dean asks tentatively, trying to overcome the cold grip that clamps at his stomach when he feels Cas shake besides him.
On the flat screen flow black and white images of some unknown Western of many years before.
When Dean wakes up they don’t talk about it.
“Kiss each other, make love to each other, find comfort in each other. That’s what we do, Cas.”
Dean turns his head around and lets his gaze wander in the room until he rests his gaze on the tiny guinea pig that now is softly sleeping in his cage.
Deans shrugs and taking one last gulp rests the bottle loudly on the map table.
“Dean.”
?” his voice drops of some tones.
What makes a human
Dean widens his eyes when Cas suddenly takes him in the mouth, moaning around his length and palming himself. He bobs his head and then Dean grabs his hair, pulling at them slightly trying to put Cas closer, but Cas just bats his hand away, detaching slightly and licking his lips, tasting Dean on his tongue.
“I’ll always do everything within my power to make you happy, Cas. Everything.” There’s resolution in his voice and Cas feels his eyes get teary. He shifts his gaze on the guinea pig
“You haven’t a damn-“ Dean shakes his head incredulous “You haven’t a flush in your hand.”
Cas catches his breath.
to live with the other, to live
“It’s almost night.”
“What?“
“You were rubbing your hands.” Dean gulps and then he steadily looks at him. “Are you cold?”
“Dude, are you sure you’re okay?” he asks sneaking at him, biting his lips in wonder.
“Never mind. Leave it. You don’t have to, don’t worry.” Dean shakes his head and starts walking away, his eyes are still glued to the floor. He has hunched shoulders and he’s dragging his own steps to reach his brother.
“I’ve called Castiel, he’s on his way.” Dean shouts to reach his brother on the other side of the room, before dipping the spoon in the white plain yogurt stolen from the groceries Sam brought the hour before. He tucks it in his mouth and squints his eyes when the sour taste hits his taste bud. “Is it expired?” he complains, looking for a date on the container. “I’ve told you a thousand times to look for the expiration dates on the packages before buying something.” He grumbles, throwing the yogurt on the small table next to his feet.
Kissing has a stress-reducing effect, it’s a chemical reaction that brings the subjects to the act of the grooming, aimed to the procreation.
The first touch on his skin makes him shudder and when Dean’s fingers enclose his hands between their grip, Cas’ breath is taken away by the sensation. His palm moves on the back of his hand and the sudden warmth stings against his flesh.
“Dean!” Sam reprehends him, making his chair screech against the floor when he gets up. “I’m going to my room.” he states flatly not without a last glare toward his brother.
“Sam is gone.”
With a slip of his thumb he gathers the wetness he feels against his head and shivers when he pictures Dean’s green eyes looking at him needy, with his fingers in his mouth and his hips flushed one against the other, trying not to squirm when he was searching for friction to ease himself.
Dean gulps and then his eyes clear away the weird emotion painted behind them.
Dean whines.
Cas slightly opens his mouth in wonder, his chest tight for the emotion. He looks at Dean and when he notices the red tips of his ears he feels a huge smile growing on his face. He stretches a hand and places it on his knee. He squeezes.
Dean looks deeply at him and Cas licks his lips, anticipation making him shiver.
Sometimes the screeching cacophony becomes a symphony and suddenly everything seems to retrieve its harmony.
“It’s getting late, maybe we should check on-“
“Hey, Cersei-“ Dean takes a seat and nudges his brother, stealing his beer. “How you doing?”
“Dean-“ his hand trembles between his fingers. “Dean, I-“ Dean snatches his hand away and a sudden ache in his chest leaves him breathless, yet Dean lowers and stares at him blown out.
“I also bought a slide so that he can-“
“Yes.” He doesn’t offer more explanations and Dean just starts to rummage in the duffle bag he brought with him. He pulls out the salt.
Sam arrives and he shares a knowing smile with him. He takes place in front of them and says something. Maybe he cracks a joke, but Castiel is not really listening to him. He’s too aware of the way Dean’s body shift when he’s relaxed. He can’t see him, but he knows that there are crinkles around his eyes when he brightly smiles at his brother.
They try to stay always comfortable and if
“Take me, Dean.” Dean bites his shoulder when he sinks more, blinking away the tears that threaten his eyes. “Take me.”
Cas smirks. “Good boy, Dean.”
“There are other movies, Dean.” Sam replies. He tries to shoot Dean an unimpressed look as he eats some popcorn.
Dean was convinced the apartment won the Guinness World Record for World’s Tiniest and Crappiest Apartment, but Cas chastised him and called it “charming” (pfffft, whatever
She doesn’t.
They moved all of their furniture back into their room, soon thereafter; that first night under their hand-painted, glow in the dark stars was one of the best nights Dean’s ever had, partially because they “made love” (Cas’ words, not Dean’s), but mostly because they talked and talked all night, about nothing, anything, and everything in between. In that moment, illuminated by the glow in the dark constellation
Twenty minutes later, a pair of disheveled boyfriends stepped out of their unhaunted house with Cas dressed as an undead tax accountant and Dean dressed as an undead lumberjack.
Once the lavenders and cornflowers were added to Cas’ enchanted garden, the forget-me-nots were painted on the walls; these took a while to paint because Dean insisted on mixing every possible shade of blue and purple to get them
began to sulk, because he couldn’t make his boyfriend happy.
” Castiel reprimands, “I’m in the middle of a conversation.”
Cas pushed the memories down. They were past that. Dean forgave him a long time ago.
But the man continues speaking over her as if she hadn’t. “— you got two options. Keep yelling at this employee or leave. Keep in mind, I just got paid; I can do this all day,” he warns her.
Claire grins back and from here, Castiel can see the mischief in her eyes, “I learned from the best.” She turns her attention to Castiel, “Hey, Ren, come meet my new friend.”
Both Cas and Dean sigh at the interruption. Dean gives Cas a quick kiss on the cheek before responding to their son with a quick, “Scrambled eggs,” and serving breakfast for everyone. Soon thereafter, Sam walks into the kitchen after his morning run while Cas makes coffee, pours milk in glasses, and Jack sets the table in a familiar routine. While Dean’s cooking bacon and sausage to go with the eggs, Eileen walks in, looking as radiant as everyone says pregnant women are supposed to be, one hand on her stomach. She’s a few months along and finally starting to show, to her annoyance and Sam’s delight.
“I got snacks!” Dean announces walking into the “Dean Cave” with no less than three bags of popcorn, a pack of black licorice, and two packs of gummy worms.
Once the announcement was made, congratulatory hugs and housewarming gifts were given; stuff owned was either thrown away, donated, or boxed up and carefully organized in the back of the Impala or the U-Haul. Dean and Cas (and Charlie, Sam and Gabe) repainted the entire apartment an off white color, as per the agreement they made with their pompous landlord Crowley (Dean and Cas repainted all the walls in the apartment and Crowley didn’t kick them out for breaking the “No painting the apartment” rule listed on some random page of their lease agreement), before casting one last wistful glance at the apartment and leaving. Afterwards, all of them said goodbye to Missouri and her new grey kitten Jesse, with Dean and Cas accepting the dozen or so casseroles she baked them, knowing better than to decline her offer after learning the hard way. Casseroles in hand, they made their way to the impala, got in, drove off into the sunset and never looked back.
When Cas received the announcement (what a wonderful phone call to witness, that was), his parents went on and on about how the house felt so big after Cas and Gabe (he finally earned the rights to his name when he bought Cas an olive green sweatshirt with the words “YOU ARE BEE-UTIFUL” written in the ugliest all-caps font and the decent sketch of a bee in white for Christmas) moved out that they couldn’t bear living in it anymore, especially since their kids didn’t visit very often (Hey, cut them some slack! Gabe’s a new business owner and Cas’s
“No, of course, that’s very important. I appreciate your loyalty to your patients.”
“Thanks, but it’s not your fault.”
Dean and Castiel continue staring into one another’s eyes for so long they forget about the world around them. The other patrons’ conversations are ignored in favor of cataloging all of the shades of green and gold in Dean’s eyes and all the freckles on his face. Lost in Dean’s beauty, time seems to slow down and speed up all at once; it feels like hours have passed when a blur of blonde in the corner of his eye catches Castiel’s attention and at the same time it feels like only a few seconds have elapsed. Regardless of the passage of time, the moment is over and Dean seems to think so, too, since he shakes his head as if shaking a trance loose; his hand, however, never leaves Castiel’s.
Dean nods, no stranger to unwelcome recollections himself, making space in the cart for the large box. He has to move some of the baby toys, clothes, toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner bottles before he’s able to situate the diapers in the cart.
stares at them, so much so that Castiel begins to squirm in their seat, but they maintain eye contact; they stare back. In the back of his mind, he wonders if this was what other people feel like when Castiel stares at them, but that can’t be right.
“Yes, thank you, Alex.”
Or so he thought.
They both ran to the nearest paint and brushes, grabbed as many brushes as they could hold, scooped up as many random paint colours as they could and started swiping, splattering, and flicking as much paint as they could on one another; they only stopped when Dean’s composure broke after Cas spit out a bit of white paint that Dean accidentally flung into his mouth.
Heat coils low in Cas’ stomach at what he has in mind. He licks his lips. “My ―”
Silence.
With about as much subtly as a jackhammer, the attractive man in the kilt makes a show of taking out his wallet — his very
Dean was about to say something when Cas walked up to the brothers.
Castiel tears their eyes away from Dean to focus his attention on Claire. “You’re right,” they commented, sounding a bit resigned. It’s not that they didn’t want to spend time with Claire, the opposite really, they’d been planning tonight for over a month, it’s just — Castiel glances at Dean and misses Claire rolling her eyes — he’s really enjoying spending time with Dean. When they focus on Claire again he notices her arms are crossed and she looks less than impressed.
They look up, frowning at the newcomer — a middle-aged blonde speaking on the phone — for unknowingly interrupting his “groove” (he blamed the word choice on Claire, who made him watch
“Wait, where’s Miracle?” Eileen asks as the movie begins.
Cas’ immediate response is a groan ― how many times must he watch this movie? Then again, he’d watch the movie as many times as Dean wanted because he wants his boyfriend to be happy. The corner of Cas’ lip curls up in amusement at the memory of their case in Dodge City. Between dressing up as a cowboy and the motel they stayed at, Dean hadn’t been that excited in a long time and he deserved it, especially after all he’d been through. Of course, the memory of the Dodge City case brings back the unpleasant memories of when Dean saying “yes” to Michael, of him and Sam spending weeks searching for Dean after the archangel took over, of his and Dean’s reunion when they all thought Michael left Dean. Cas isn’t sure how he made the leap from the Dodge City case to Dean being possessed by Michael, but he learned a long time ago that human brains don’t always make sense.
"'Cause it's our first Halloween in our new house, I know. You've been talking about it since your birthday in August."
“Everything else
“Other outside forces…” Amara comes to mind. As does the Empty.
“Dude, why are we watching 'Tombstone', again? You couldn’t find
Until Cas announced, a few days post hammering the offending rag onto his angelic portrait, he wanted to paint some fairies around his garden because “What’s an ‘Enchanting Garden’ without fairies, Dean?”. Dean glared at Cas’ smirk, both of them knowing Cas paying Dean back for the (badass and sexy) nude portrait. But the joke’s on Cas because Dean refused to help him. This led to Cas not helping Dean the furniture back into their room until he was done painting, and ended in Dean helping Cas paint fairies on their bedroom walls anyways, to speed up the moving-furniture-back-into-their-room process; soon thereafter, the joke on Cas turned into the joke on Dean. Dean, to this day, is proud to say he only complained
Castiel smiles as well and before they know it, they find themselves staring into one another’s eyes.
“Yes, of course, my apologies.” Cas shifts his weight and grabs their laptop case with the other hand.
?” Eileen giggles from where she’s cuddling Sam.
Since Cas had work the following week, Dean ended up painting most of the lavenders and cornflowers by himself, but only when he wasn’t working on commissions, cooking, cleaning, eating, showering, or taking a break. It wasn’t anywhere near as much fun when he had to do it by himself, but he did listen to a lot of Zeppelin to help him get by until Cas came home and they could do it together, once Cas was up for it.
Castiel presses a kiss to her head before he speaks loud enough for Claire to hear but not so loud the nosy customers would know what he was talking about, “What are you going to do in regards to your friendship with Alex and her relationship with this Henry?”
“Of course,” Dean answers as if he couldn’t imagine the answer being anything else. He pauses. Then looks Castiel up and down in a, frankly,
This woman has no idea who she’s talking to, and Castiel almost feels bad for her, having been on the receiving end of Claire’s verbal tongue lashings and having witnessed the receiving end of Claire’s anger. As proud as Castiel is that Claire hasn’t attacked this unpleasant woman, he can’t deny that they’re seething because
massaging his left hand, then their right, then his left again, as if being gentle with his hands will somehow combat his anger towards the middle-aged woman currently verbally harassing his daughter and their fierce desire to protect her.
"Get your clothes, it's time for bed." Dean demands as he picks up the crow bar.
Sam looks at Dean, his mouth opens to argue, “I-” he begins only for Dean to cut him off.
“Thanks...Daddy,” Castiel says. The boy tries to hide his disgust but Dean sees it.
When they got to the house, Sam made his new friend park on the street. The last thing he needed was a neighbor asking Dean about a car in the driveway.
Much to his surprise, his phone goes off straight away. He picks it up, looking at the glowing screen under his blanket. "Hey there Sam! I'm so happy you texted me," the other man replies.
Sam gulps as he walks behind his brother, clinging to the railing as they walk downstairs. His heart was racing, his brow furrowed, eyes fixed on the crowbar in Dean’s hand. This wasn’t going to be good.
Sam shakes his head but let's go of Cas' hair and pushes the teen off of him. "No but it was close," he pants, his strained and leaking cock up against his stomach.
There's another panicked scream and Sam snaps his head up quickly. "I'll do it!" He shouts on instinct when he sets his eyes on his big brother holding Cas by the hair with one hand, the crowbar swung back and high over the boy's head ready to hit him with it. Sam knew Cas wouldn’t survive the blow.
TAKE YOUR FUCKING CLOTHES OFF!! Yells Dean, beyond impatient. The pair on the floor both flinch, then Sam stands and strips down to his to his boxers. He folds his clothes and sets them aside on the floor. “Those too, ” Dean says gesturing to the boxers. Sam frowns and vigorously shakes his head no.
“A real kiss Sammy!” Dean shouts annoyed.
Dean walks back over to his brother and kisses him. Then he grabs Sam his shaggy mop of hair and pulls his head back he gives Sam a hard slap with his free hand, “Do not question what I do with my pet do you understand me?” He asks his voice a low but angry.
"Please no." The boy pleads weakly, barely audible. Dean easily drags the naked teen over his lap, firmly holding him in place.
He looks up and his eyes lock with Dean's. There’s a look of arousal and fire in his endless globes of mossy forest green. Biting his lip, he focused on fucking Cas. Sam's gaze pans down when peering, his eyes meet Dean cock and he quickly finds himself fully hard once again. He uses his good hand to brace himself on Cas' hip (he's just copying what his big brother did whenever he fucks him from behind). Sam finally finds himself not struggling at all to stay in the moment.  He just keeps looking at Dean, he doesn't think about anything else.
The couple look at each other and shake their heads.
Dean pulls himself from his flashback. “When are you getting out?” He barks, his voice an artificial dark tone trying to hide his hurt state of mind. He hates feeling weak.
I should promote my Tumblr on here more. Its FireFandoming the same as here.
Sammy takes in a deep breath, finally and slowly entering Cas. It feels so weird, weird as hell. He really doesn't like it but he doesn't have a choice. Cautiously he gives a slow thrust, he's not sure what he's doing. Years of Dean hurting him, rutting into his hips when they've fucked doesn't help him.
“Sam I want you to give Cas a handjob now. Same rule applies to him, he's not allowed to cum.”
Dean grins when he sees Cas take his brother into his mouth. He sets the crowbar aside for now. He takes his lube from his pocket and unzips his jeans freeing his half hard cock from it's prison. He lathers his hand and starts stroking lazily. He takes his free hand and runs it down the bumps of his Angel's spine, loving how the pet shivers under the ghostly touch.
"I'm leaving work early. Go get ready"
The man offers Sam a tissue. He accepts it wiping his face and blowing his nose. "Thank you, " Sam mutters.
Ketch returns to his seat quickly. "Did your son have any social media accounts?" He questions, readying himself to type up notes.
Castiel looked up at him. Sam could see bruises of various shades covering the young teen's wrists and ass, one on the boy's face. He has a split lip and some other scrapes. The boy was also skinnier then when Sam left. Dean hadn’t been feeding him enough. It could’ve been worse.  Sam knew that, but it was still hard to see…
"Time out of this room?" The teen replies looking hopeful.
Sam just watched TV until Gadreel returned with food. He watches as the bags are unloaded. His mouth-watering when he sees his sandwich. "Thanks again.” He says with a smile.
“Hi,” Sam greets him with a weak smile, with a curt nod Dean walked towards him and sat in the chair beside the bed.
"You really missed me huh," he cooed softly.
"Sam! Thank god you're back!" Cas exclaimed excitedly, rushing for the door with his arms wide open, only to end up choked by his falling down a couple of feet away. He coughed, but gave the elder boy a weak smile.
The captor speeds up knowing he won’t last much longer, not with Castiel practically squeezing the cum out of him. He claws into Cas’ thighs and he blows into him with force. His climax rips through him like a violent wave of electricity. His boy comes with a wailed cry right along with him.
Dean pulled into the garage and headed inside. He grinned when he found Sam, kneeling in the middle of the living room with his head down.
“Okay...Okay, Dean, I'll take them off,” calms Sam, submitting to his brother as always. Then promptly discards the underwear. Castiel looks away from Sam the second he's naked, still crying softly.
This does nothing to console his wife. "You're implying a predator took our son. How’s that supposed to make me feel any better?" Amelia snaps
Dean can't help but laugh, "Oh Cas baby, get your head out of the fucking clouds," he declares amused as all hell. This was gonna take awhile.
Gadreel stops Sam when he goes to get out of the car. "I'm gonna write down my number. Text me if you ever need anything or if you just need a chat," he says sternly as he jots down his number.
"These people are trained to look where no one else would think of!"  Her husband exclaims.
Dean turns to Sam and he gestures at Cas with the crowbar. "You're going to fuck him and I'm going to watch," he declares aggressively.
Castiel’s snaps his head up meeting eyes with Dean. His eyes are beginning to spill over with tears yet again. He's so weak he hates himself. “I know what you want just to get it over with, ” Castiel tells his captor sharply.
At their Dad's funeral Dean sips out of a flask kept in his suit jacket. He looks over the small crowd as he sips. It's then that Dean explains the truth. He points with his flask at the men there and tells his little brother that every man except for Bobby abused him. When Sam his shocked by this Dean just shrugs and asks his brother what he thought all of those trips were for.
It happened fast, too fast for Sam to realize what was happening before it was over. His shoulder hurt. It hurt worse than it ever has before. He does his best to focus on something other than the pain, but he can’t. That was the moment when he realized that Dean had just shot him!
“Not without permission,”  Dean hisses back. He's never made Sammy ask before, but things always change. Mind games like this are what keeps things interesting. “Cas decided to be a brat and puke on the floor. You need to it clean up. Now!!” As Dean speaks, he slowly becomes more and more venomous.
"New rule. Disobeying me gets you thirty. Talking back gets you thirty more. You have to count them. You miss a number, then that shit is on you and it doesn't count." Dean explains, grinning to himself. Changing rules to keep his pets on their toes is the best kind of fun. That way neither of them can ever win.
Dean grins, leaning over and digging through their nightstand. He pulls out a box cutter, extending the blade. Smirking, he sees the horrified expression on his brother's face as he brings the blade towards him. Dean makes small cuts into his brother's toned abs as he fucks him roughly. "If you can say hard while I cut you, I'll let you come," he explains coldly. Sam hisses in pain, frowning. Dean knows damn well Sam won't be able to. When he goes soft Dean lets out a cooing noise and throws the blade aside. He runs his hands through the blood covering Sam's stomach, speeding up and not bothering to hit Sam's sweet spot.
We aren't hearing Castiel's parents this chapter but next time we will don't worry. I am having a lot of health issues I'm surprised I got this out. :)
Cas looks up a Dean from his spot on the floor. He sees Dean stroking himself to hardness. His eyes overflow with tears. He hates this so much. “I don't want to!” Cas shouts. He feels immature and stupid. But what else can he do? He’s terrified, starving, chained to a bed, in a basement with a psycho rapist.
Sam looks at him briefly before swallowing and turning back to make out with Castiel. It's a wet opened mouth kiss and Dean enjoys every second of it. Cas doesn't really kiss back. He probably doesn't even know how. That's okay, Sammy will teach him just fine. The two stop kissing to break for air. “Sam take your clothes off,” demands Dean.
The boy's eyes go wide and his stomach rumbles. "Okay," he utters softly.
Sam is becoming risky with his emotions. Dean continues to make Cas' life a nightmare.
Sam blushes...but the warmth is quickly broken. What if this is a trap? What if Dean is testing his loyalty? The words his brother told Sam the day he confessed to their father's murder echos around in his mind. The threat, if you betray me I will kill you. Sam has never questioned the truth of those words. He can't even tell himself Dean won't do it because Sam is all he has left. That's not true anymore. Dean has a spare now. A young petite spare at that.
Ketch frowned. "Did your son mention anyone, a peer or adult behaving strangely or following him in the days or weeks leading to him going missing?" Ketch inquires.
Dean finishes his dinner and leaves Sam to clean everything up. He heads downstairs to check up on his sweet little caged angel.
Sam gives in and let's his tears flow, sobbing into his hand. He's so tired of everything and he just wants to go home. He wants Dean. He longs to just lay in bed with his big brother's arms around his waist. Cuddling and making out, and fucking the day away. He doesn’t even care if Dean hurts him. He deserves it after what he's put his brother though. He deserves it for Dean to hit him with belts, chains and fists. Sam hates himself so much. He’s so upset that he doesn’t see Gadreel watching him through the open door.
The man comes into the room. "I'm a volunteer. Well, it's community service really, I'm on parole, " He calmly explains. "I can slip you some outside food? What do you want?" He asks with a smile.
Sam looks up ready to respond, but he sees a crowbar in his brother's hand and stops himself. What the hell was Dean planning...
Sam thinks it over before shrugging. "A grilled turkey sandwich and another smoothy?" He asks softly.
Suddenly Castiel’s eyes snap open. He looks at dean terrified and scrambles away. The small teen presses himself against the headboard eying Dean fearfully. “I’m gonna take this off,” Dean says trying to slowly reach for the ballgag. “If you scream I will hit you,” he says waving his finger and speaking sternly. Dean unsnaps the ball gag. The second the gag falls to the mattress Cas screams, he screams bloody murder. Dean punches Cas in the side of the head as a reflex. Yes, the room is soundproof but that doesn’t mean Dean enjoys having a brat scream next to him. The boy starts the waterworks and holding his head in pain.
Amelia Novak sits on her son's bed. The bed that's been empty for three whole days now. She holds her son's stuffed toy cat to her chest. The toy her son still slept with despite being a 14-year-old. The cat he shyly hid away when his friends came over. The woman gently runs her hand over the bed covers as she fights back another sob.
He doesn't feel anything anymore.
Sam complies, looking extremely nervous. When Dean has all he needs he leaves to return downstairs.
Sam finds himself on the kitchen chair,  biting down on a rolled up towel in his mouth. He bites down as his brother crudely digs around inside him trying to get the bullet out, it's excruciating. After several minutes of this Dean stands up and swears and kicks the chair next to Sam against the wall. The younger sibling flinches on reflex, as the chair splinters into pieces when it hits the wall. Sam turns his head and sees Dean leaning against the kitchen sink looking pissed. This isn't good at all. “I can't get the bullet out and now I'm gonna have to drive you to the ER, ” Dean scolds, annoyed. Sam goes to take the towel out of his mouth only to be stopped by a slap to the side of the head. He falls from his chair and cringes as he manages to sit up enough to look at his big brother as he says,  “why did you two have to be such ungrateful brats!? Especially you Sam. You know all the shit I've done for you! You are an ungrateful piece of shit! I'm the one that's always looked after you!” Dean screams knocking the coffee maker off the kitchen table. The cord pulls from the wall. The glass coffee pot breaks against the floor. Dean points at the coffee pot, then looks at Sam, “That’s your fucking fault! You just had to piss me off didn't you?!” he rants.
Castiel stares at him then at Sam, his mouth hanging open. Sam looks at his brother, then clenches his jaw, “okay, ” Sam whispers,  barely audible, leaning over to cup Cas’ face. The teen flinches at the touch. “Castiel it's okay,” Sam reassures him, keeping his voice calm. Sam raises his other hand keeping Cas face in place by gently cupping his cheek. Sam plants a soft kiss on Cas’ mouth.
Sam vigorously shook his head. "You need to let me out today, " He replies.
It was nearly seven in the evening when Dean got home. He was quiet when approached the sleeping teen. The man ran his hand down the boy's spine, making him flinch away in panic. He leaned over his face, pressing against the side of the mask. "It's time to play baby.” He announced playfully, grinning. Cas screamed it's sound muffled by the hood. Dean slaps him upside the head. "No screaming or Daddy won't play nice!" He shouts angrily, right in Cas' ear. The boy whimpers. Dean is pretty sure he hears muffled sobs. It's honestly adorable at this point. Partly because his pet still thinks tears will save him. Eventually, he'll stop being such a baby...he had to admit, his boy does look cute with tears running down his face. The captor with emerald eyes debates taking the hood off. Nah, he likes this.
Sam wants so badly to tell him to fuck off, but he's too hungry for that. "A salad with chicken and a sweet vinaigrette. No cheese...never put cheese on the salad. It's disgusting. And a smoothie drink, please, " Sam asks cautiously.
"That's not happening, " The nurse calmly tells him.
Dean smirks. "Baby boy, you really have no goddam clue what it means to be sorry, but you will," he threatens coldly. The man undoes his belt.
“Yeah you’re right I’m gonna go check on Cas,” Dean states as he lets go of his brother.
“You never call me that again you understand me?” Dean questions pulling his hair more.
"Blow him. He's not allowed to cum. If you gag at all you're training with the fucking O-ring again." Dean orders Cas.
Upstairs Sam heads for the bedroom. Dean goes to the kitchen. Once alone and naked in bed, Sam pulls out his phone and he scrolls down his contact list for Gadreel. He hovers over it, taking in a few long breaths before building the courage to click send a new message. "Hey, it's Sam from the hospital," he says. He lays his phone down on his chest and pulls his duvet up over his body.
---------------------
Eventually it works as his mind goes completely blank and he can't feel any of it anymore.
"Great, so I can go home soon?" Sam inquires hopefully.
"Must just be my charm, " Gadreel states with a wink.
The pair sat for awhile on Cas' bed talking. It's mostly awkward small talk as neither of them really knew what to say. "Sam, do you think you could bring me some food?" The boy questioned sheepishly at one point.
"Delete that video! You had no right to film him having a breakdown you stupid bitch. You have no clue what the fuck you are dealing with!"  Sam screams at her.
Jimmy frowns, "Maybe he met someone… a guy online and was manipulated?" Jimmy suggests.
He gets out the frying pan to cook for himself. God he hates this, he needs his Sammy back! Cooking reminds him of when his father was alive. Ten years old, standing in front of the stove on his little stool to help him reach the nobs at the back of the stove. The pan filled with fat strips of cheap bacon. John coming up behind him whispering in his ear about how he’s just a perfectly sexy little housewife. His stomach turns. Sammy finally answers the phone, “Hey Dee,” he says his voice sounding tired.
“Now do as you’re told,” Dean orders him.
"Welcome home," the younger brother greets, his voice as soft as butter. Dean strode over and threaded his fingers through his baby brother's shaggy hair.
Sam gave the man next to him directions as he drove. They talk along the way. Gadreel was shocked by how into true crime Sam was, which Sam found  amusing. The idea of making an ex-con squirm in his seat with his interests made Sam smirk. "You sure you're still crushing on me?" He grins. Gadreel just chuckles.
Watching Sam fuck Cas was the hottest thing Dean's ever seen. He can't just stand there and watch, he has to join in, something compels him to touch...to join them.
Just before Ketch reached the door he turned to the parents. “Oh, one more thing. Did your son have access to a computer or laptop?”
---------
Sam stood up, trying to compose himself. He couldn’t believe Cas just kissed him. How could he ever think he'd want that? He stumbled to the bathroom, doing his best to shake his mind from his thoughts. He couldn’t ever be with anyone but Dean, it’s not like he had a choice. He's Dean's and his alone. He’d never wanted anyone else. Sam then tried to focus on figuring out how to give himself an enema with only one arm.
Once in the car, there’s silence besides the radio. After no longer than ten minutes in the car Dean glances at his brother licking his lips, “There’s lube in the glove compartment. I want a handjob, ” Dean states dryly.
Dean smiles, "I know you'd make a good pet given time".
Dean grins. "That's good, maybe I can start giving you more stuff soon".
Dean looks at his little brother making eye contact with him as he thrusts into Castiel. This makes Sam's skin crawl. Sam wants out of this cement hell.
It's shortly after Sam's hands are clean that the hospital comes into view. “Now let's get the story straight. I shot you by accident. Okay?” Dean frames his speech as a question but Sam knows it's an order.
“No please I don’t want to,” Cas cries.
"You shouldn't have to put up with that, " The stranger states taking the used tissue back and pocketing it.
Castiel has a goal now. His goal is to win Sam over!  He's going to make Sam think he’s fallen in love with him. He's going to make Sam love him back!.
"Sure. Did you have your enema today?" Sam pried.
-------------------------
"I accept his apology,'' he says while  poking again at his food, "How's your morning been?" He asks trying to sound cheerful.
When Castiel was completely calm again Dean speaks in a cold tone.  "I'm not done punishing you yet.” The boy stills in his lap, heart racing against Dean's chest.
“I'm not really in the mood for disobedience right now,” Dean says deadly calm, resting the gun on his lap.
Dean and Cas have a morning alone together, with Sammy still in the hospital. Also we get to hear from Castiel's worried parents.
Sam feels a blush creep across his face. He can't help it. Instead of telling the man off he responds with, "you’re the one buying food, not me. You're the angel here, " it's cheesy but it gets the other man to blush back (even if he does shake his head).
His silhouette was tense in the dark. "Cas has never cum like that from just my cock," he states coldy, before turning to his brother and glaring at him, looking like a twisted, psycho lunatic in the dim light.
When Dean turns to leave Sam turns back to look at this brother. “Hey go easy on him Dean it’s his first day and he’s just a kid,” Sam says softly.
Sam adjusts the angle of his thrusts for his own comfort, however the new movement seems to activate this primal instinct in the boy beneath him who let's out a deep, ecstasy filled cry. He pushes himself back onto Sam's dick, so Sam does it again and again and again.
Castiel again nods and that's when Dean finally let's go. Cas is still shaking the weight of what's going to happen hits him. He can feel his lip quivering. He lets out sob “P-please, ” Cas begs.
Dean was at work, so Sam could always just say he took the bus home. His brother never needed to know he got a ride from this man. "Yeah, thanks." Sam stood up, pocketing his cell. He got in  the passenger side and buckled up.
“Your toilet is over there,” Dean states pointing to the bucket. Castiel again goes wide-eyed, he looks like he’s about to cry again. Dean takes the bottle away. “It’s polite to say thank you when someone gives you something,” He says sternly.
The man roughly shoves Cas off his lap to the floor and leaves the room. Upstairs Dean redoes his belt and digs through a closet in the hallway. "Where the fuck are my tools?" he growls at Sam, tossing random clutter out of his way.
Sam was confused and slightly offended. "No! I've never used drugs, why?"  He asks in an annoyed manner.
A closet door slams shut and Sam flinches. "Get up. We're going downstairs," Dean orders coldly.
Dean takes Cas' free hand into his. The boy struggles to try to pull away. It's useless, Dean still manages to force the pliers under the boy's thumbnail slowly pushing ripping. The teen screams unto gag from the agony, sobbing.
Jimmy shook his head, "It could’ve been another teenager, maybe they ran off together" He says waving his hands defensively.
Sam's eyes darted from his brother and then to Cas. He looks down at the floor, trying to stop himself from shaking, "I only want you Dean, only you," he  mumbles. He’s shit scared now.
Dean looks completely amused. “Awe you still think you can tell me what to do, ” Dean states amused. Cas is then backhanded across the face. Castiel ends up on the cement floor sobbing again. This hurts so bad, he already has bruises from the last time Dean did this. “I know you’re not used to being hit or excepted to listen. Your damn hippy parents spoiled you Cas. That's not your fault but it is going to make learning much harder for you, ” Dean states sternly. “I also know you don’t know how to suck dick and you learn that today as well, ” Dean explains. Castiel hurt begins racing again as the sound of his imprisoner’s fly being unzipped. “Come here and make up for being entitled little brat. Oh and if I feel any teeth I will fucking knock your teeth out of your head. Which would be a shame because I do hope to see that cute little smile again someday, ” As Dean speaks his voice gets softer as he would actually feel bad for Cas having his teeth remover. What the fuck is wrong with this man?
"If your husband is a danger to himself or others you should report him. " The nurse states bluntly.
“De, please put the gun away, ” Sam keeps his voice soft and submissive, trying to reason with his big brother.
"I can do that. I'll be back at half past noon, " Gadreel replied leaving the room.
Even better than that is watching Sammy struggle not to love every second of what's happening to him. "Remember how he likes it? It's the same thing for this. Just use your tongue instead of your hand." Dean explains eagerly.
He enters the basement and walks over to the bed. Cas sits curled up by the headboard with his arms around his legs watching Dean frightfully. The abductor leans over ready to kiss his toy when he notices blood under the boy's nails. He roughly takes Castiel's small hand into his own. "I fucking told you to stop this shit!" He screams.
"Well, I'm going to look more into this vehicle.  It’s the closest thing to a lead we've had so far," Ketch replies, taking his tape and readying himself to leave. Amelia and Jimmy wish the man well. Both parents are unsure of how they feel about all of this as they see Ketch out.
"Do you think whoever is in that car kidnapped our son?" Amelia asks frantically, causing her husband to pull her closer to him.
The older chuckles, this kid has balls trying to pull shit like that. "No. Nice try, but no. I was thinking about more food and water. Maybe a pillow and a blanket. Clothes even. Maybe a TV with DVDs or some of Sammy’s books. I know you like fantasy stuff. I saw on your profile.” The boy bites his lip and looks like he's thinking stuff over. "If you let me fuck you without making a fuss, I'll let you have my leftovers from dinner".
