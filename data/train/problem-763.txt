Adrienne was in labour for four hours and I had to wait there the whole time. She screamed a lot at the end. I rather wished I could too. It was markedly unpleasant.
“Great,” says Lestrade. “Car’s downstairs.”
It’s no use. They still won’t invite her to join in. Eurus scowls, and walks slowly back to house, taking a path through the faux graves that someone thought was a fun decoration idea,  stomping so as to kill as many insects as she can on her way.
“Did you have plans for a job?”
Sherlock has been awake for several hours and is covering his severed head with a couple of tea towels when he hears John stirring - little creaks on the floor boards, the low rustle of sheets, then the stillness of a man who realises he has nothing to wear except yesterday's clothes.
It seemed we were on the brink of anarchy. I was fairly certain that nothing more could happen to me that morning, but there’s always something. Mrs Hudson rushed downstairs to answer the door again.
I took a deep breath. “His name was Victor.”
As it was, I stayed awake until 5am watching him and taking notes and providing a bottle when he yelled at me, then I fell asleep next to his new crib and didn’t wake until he started squalling at 8.13.
Delicate wrap with sealing sap
It’s difficult to know which way to go with this conversation, so John lets it drop and reaches for his mobile phone. Someone else can look after the carbs.
John Watson was there to save my life. As always.
“Mr Holmes,” she began. “How old is Albion?”
Greg continues. “We just don’t know, and the thing is, I’ve been to hundred of crimes scenes too, and I’ve seen things I can’t explain. This woman might have heard a ghost, or she might be a loopy, but I think there’s some value in trusting things you can’t explain.”
Sherlock makes a small entry in another file about the feel of John’s mouth on his ear.
Jenny half smiles and continues.
So while John wasn’t observing, Sherlock, who loves to prove or disprove a theory, set about researching ways he could be romantic.
“Yes,” Sherlock says in a low voice, “Very much.”
I expected a full night of wailing, desperate fairy tales and nightmares from the two men in my life but my predictions were wholly inaccurate.
So why can't they remember their number by checking their phones?
For he is blond but dark.
Greg is not convinced. “I need to get back to the office. Let me try and contact one of the old coppers again and I’ll see if I can’t get any thing to back up your claims.”
"Mycroft, you're being cruel. Let him do his own experiments. Now have you had some broccoli? I ordered it especially to counteract the chili. They cook it perfectly at this place, it's quite crunchy. Some kind of Chinese steaming method that looks easy but is fiendishly difficult, I expect. Sherlock, try this chicken and tell me if I should order again."
“Impossible to say. He could have actually bled to death, died from the actual brain injury or he could have suffocated.”
“Yes, exactly. John doesn’t make deductions, but he interprets things, or re-evaluates things I may have dismissed, or taken on face value. Other times he can provide a vital fact that will substantiate a complex theory. And he blogs about me. I never asked him to do that, he just started writing about our cases so that I would get the credit for solving them instead of the police.” Sherlock ponders that for a moment, how John’s generous conducting of light had illuminated Sherlock for the world to see and admire. “He is very supportive of me.”
They sit together in the centre of the roof, only a few feet from where Moriarty shot himself.
“Why does he need so much?”
John is giggling. “What are you doing down there?”
After everyone had left, the doctor and I were left alone with Albion acting as to mediator.
In less than forty-eight hours it was like they had never been separated. John made tea, Sherlock flopped on the couch. They argued, discussed, disagreed, agreed and each smiled widely at the other when they thought the other couldn’t see.
molly
“Sherlock.” John had touch of urgency in his voice.
A small chill of resentment winds around the room. Mrs Best’s countenance changed.
“No. I told you, he can make very adequate farting noises without any help from me.”
He cups a buttock in each large hand and presses John closer to his face.
John talks between mouthfuls of the tasty quiche. “So…runcible spoons. Are you hoping we can dance by the light of the moon?”
John nodded. He'd been in the army for years, he told her. Order and neatness were his specialities.
“Yes, unfortunately,” and here John Watson blessed me with his ridiculous little giggle. “The Prince had a brother called Michel who was a complete plonker and wanted nothing more than to rule the world.”
Developing baby confidence was one of my current challenges.
"That is obviously someone's pet."
He also manages to use ‘refoveate’ in an otherwise dull diagnosis that afternoon.
The crowds and noise are increasing. Constables are threading yellow crime scene tape around the building, teams of police specialists are arriving with cases of equipment to measure, quantify and document the killing. Ballistic experts will examine the dead man's wound and talk for months about the difficult, perfect shot that killed him.
“You can tell her what ever fantasy you want,” Sherlock leans in and whispers. “I am going to give her all the gory details.”
"Someone phoned it in. We think it was the person who disturbed the killer."
“I’ve seen her photos of Albuquerque six times and they never change,” I told Albion. That seemed to interest him and he went quiet, obviously hoping to hear more. “Albuquerque is a large town in New Mexico, which is one of the fifty states of the United States, a large land mass in the Northern Hemisphere. The other states are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia – “
I filled the pot and set our mugs side by side on the kitchen counter.
Finally there were some noises in her flat and finally she opened the door. She looked at Albion with mild curiousity.
“Actually, a cup of tea would be nice.”
They have been in residence together for nearly three months. During that time they had invited
Mrs Hudson had put clean sheets on my bed and milk in the fridge.
“My God, you’re lovely,” John declares between kisses.
“You can do whatever tests you like.”
John nods. "I did three months of geriatrics when I was registrar."
I’m hungry, he’ll whinge, feed me.
Sherlock still hasn't looked up. He has, though, already deduced that Lestrade has worn the same shirt two days running, that he slept in flannette sheets last night, that he only had a quick shower this morning, that he has only had coffee for breakfast and needs some solid food and that the person responsible for this change in the Detective Inspector's condition wears Youth Dew. Sherlock stops himself from sing-songing, "Lestrade's got a girlfriend!" and reads the file more closely. The most salient fact, the common denominator of each victim, catches his eye.
She laughs and rests a playful hand on his arm as he turns to follow Sherlock up the stairs. “You never know your luck!”
“I don’t want to see what I remember. I want to see her, as she is now, before I bury her. I want to see her one last time.”
clenched teeth, one hand loose on John's shoulder and the other clasped in John's. Sherlock feels the light flick on in every chamber of his heart and for once it doesn't feel uninhabited.
Sherlock is straining to see how the varnish looks on his toes.” I didn’t know you had a foot fetish.”
There's Sherlock's pale throat, right for the stabbing. It's long, thinks John, carefully raising his gun.
“Well, you already have one, but it’s not very interesting. I have to make one to hold all your sex things now.”
For he can stitch their wounds.
"No, just going to pick up a couple of text books." Recently he has been musing on finding a part time job in a clinic or maybe in an E&A room. He needs to brush up on a couple of areas of pain management and more recent x ray diagnostics.
“Good! But I need to know - are you enjoying it?”
"The cat," John says quietly.
Albion was asleep in his crib, I had been measuring the length of his bones so I could calculate his height as an adult.  His soft shadow of dark hair was sticking up like the spikes on tropical caterpillars. I thought it was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen and couldn’t stop touching it.
“A spare?”
I would have drowned – which I sometimes think might have saved a lot of people much heartache, inconvenience and/or dullness - but for the nine year old warrior that was Mycroft, who saw me fall in and jumped, fully dressed, to haul me from the bottom.
He tucks them down next to his discharge papers.
John leans back with a small smirk. “Is that what this all about?”
Jeremy opens his mouth but is unable to explain it. John and Lestrade are filled with pity for this awkward adolescent, stealing money to buy a friend a present.
“No.”
Because they don't have them.
“Of course you can discount it,” Sherlock says as he looks around the vast warehouse. “I have solved hundreds of crimes and not one was informed by a ghost.”
“Sherlock! Hello Mrs H. Anya. John, you hero. Mycroft.” Lestrade made his way through the crowd, stepped right up to the tub and peered down at me. Albion reached both chubby little fists up to him.
I giggled back. Water was running in torrents from my hair and straight into my eyes.
"Yes. Keep going."
“I’m fine, but thank you. Rest assured that if I need someone assaulted and feel unable to do it myself, you will be the first person I’ll call.”
John was not so lucky. He woke up agitated and fearful at 2.12, damp and wide eyed in the grip of a nightmare.
It's all a bit too much. "Right. Might I see the room?"
“Seriously?”
They don't speak for a while. John looks out the window, working out how he can do this. He knows Bart's back to front. Accident and Emergency on a Saturday night, even this early, will be hectic and mostly staffed by agency nurses and doctors. On a Saturday night there would be very few regular staff. An unfamiliar doctor won't register with anyone.
He turns left into Gloucester Place. It's quiet and the trees are strangely beautiful in the false white street light. John hears a noise ahead of him, a friendly, cheerful noise and sees a group of young people milling around a car. He hates them all instantly and ducks down Portman Street.
John, marked by his third year tutors as having the best bedside manner in his group, regards his therapist with the same patient disappointment he has for every one these days. She ploughs on regardless.
“Puppy!” Rosie says in a delightful, sleepy voice.
Tummy time was one of the first educational activities Albion and I enjoyed together. I had been looking forward to it for some weeks, starting with a few minutes here and there of laying him on his back. Today we were going to work towards sitting up.
molly
"No, I just want to check on a couple of things."
I haven’t bought Albion any shoes because there’s no point, given he can’t even lift his head yet. I have got him some socks though, all of which I chose because they match or compliment his jumpers.
“I love you,” was all I could think to tell him.
Barts to look at two interesting bodies.
“No, because you like warm wet foods full of meat. We have a pot now. Who gave you those flowers?”
He means me.
And we laughed some more, which made us embrace very warmly, and for a few seconds that was all we needed. It was very nice.
“Now Sherlock. I’ve been speaking with Galveston Lestrade and he’s been trying to find Albion’s mother.”
"No."
"Ah." It's always a pleasant surprise for Sherlock when the person he has been conversing with turns out not to have been there after all. "No matter. We've agreed that we can keep separate rooms. That will allow us some storage and privacy if we need it, but we can always visit one another if we chose."
Oh, though Sherlock with hot sticky glee, there’s lots of points. Dozens of them. Enough points to make it pointier than a jousting match.
True to form, Amarita baffled everyone when, in 1968, she eloped with the man least likely, a stern, wild haired young philosophy don whose intellectual gifts were so onerous he walked in a perpetual stoop, apparently weighed down by the heavy burden of his great mind.
He went to walk away but John reached out and grabbed his sleeve, which was enormously entertaining because people rarely touch Mycroft and he’s never sure what to do when they do.
“Why did she refuse to leave?”
“Powwidge!” she answers with a broad smile.
I was, however, enlightened at first sight when I first saw John Watson, by which I mean my entire outlook became brighter because he brought light to my occasionally bleak world. Also, he wasn’t remotely fazed by me, which was maddingly attractive.
“Just about.”
He rolls to his side and holds his hair back. John kneels in front of him.
John has taken a few days off, partly to attend to some tiresome administrative matters and but mostly to assist Sherlock, who has finally been invited to help Scotland Yard on the mystery of the four armed robberies.
“The order was legislated to allow parents who had a baby via surrogacy to actually parent. According to the legal definition, it could be argued that Albion is a surrogate baby.”
We had not been on a case together for more than two years but we knew exactly what to do as soon as we got there. The victim had been removed, but the blood spatter was in place and Lestrade gave us full access to the crime scene photographs. I measured each spatter pattern. John paced the length and width of the room. We calculated roughly where each suspect stood, and compared our calculations with the pictures of their blood stained clothes.
Molly is mostly silent as she examining the head for fractures. “Right here, “ she says, and Sherlock inspects a substantial crack at the base of Mariah’s skull, an inch or so to the left of her spine. “Oh, and here too,” and all three lean over to see the deep crack at the second cervical disc.
"Nothing's ever straight forward with you, is it? Anybody else would just drop their phone accidently and it would slide under the fridge. Not you. You have to have an explosion."
The slurping, airy sounds that signalled Empty Bottle were upon us. We assumed the burp position.
So is John, but about different things. The latest poem is starting to work its magic  - plisses scarf, he thinks over and over - but he knows well enough that now is not the time or place to discuss it.
“To just Albion?”
It was worth suggesting just to see the look on his face.  He smiled so widely I could see his back molars.
I have heard countless dreary accounts from new parents declaring that they fell in love with their infant at first sight, most of them from poor John Watson.
"The rent's a 150 pounds a week and we buy our own groceries. We split the housework, and if you take the room, you've got your own bathroom that you have to keep clean. The last woman here was a slob and it really ruined the energy of the house. "
Later that day the black shiny car returns but minus the mysterious texting brunette. Sherlock and John sit quite separate in the back seat, staring out the window.
“Always?”
He takes a deep breath. “I wouldn’t ask ordinarily, but I’m desperate, John. I need your help at Bart’s.”
"Hello, Billy," Sherlock says warmly. "Why aren't you in prison?"
I can’t deny that I was ardently attracted to him physically. Bad tempered blonde men with broad shoulders have always held a particular fascination for me.  But John isn’t the only bad tempered, broad-shouldered blonde in the world.
“Listen, you poncy fuck, put your hands in the air or I’ll break both your arms NOW.”
“Angry because his leg hurt?”
His face is squeezed tight with irritation as he steps carefully into his especially nice Hugo Boss trousers, which have been transported here by a custard coloured MI6 agent who did whatever Mycroft told him to. Sherlock hates the agent because he is insipid, aligned to Mycroft and has an extremely handsome gun for which Sherlock has many practical applications but cannot actually steal. This is unsatisfactory because usually Sherlock is excellent at pick pocketing, pilfering and petty theft. For a time when he was in the fourth form, he ran a rather lucrative business of shoplifting by request that all but saw him nearly expelled for the third time. (Sherlock, for many years, held his school's record for the student who was nearly expelled most. It was only broken a few years ago and that was after they invented smart phones.)
“I certainly am.” That he was mine to keep was one of the two best things that ever happened to me.
(My baby is always splendid, but I find him especially lovely when he has just woken up. He smells like powder and damp cotton, and scowls with half opened eyes.)
(I made that sound quite unimportant but it was in fact an incredibly difficult thing to say. John Watson and I are not terribly competent in handling our feelings for each other. We’ve made adequate declarations once – John, when he asked me to be his best man, and me, when I gave a speech as his best man. I also told him I loved him just before he walked around he world but he couldn’t hear that, so I don’t know if it counts.
“Sherlock or Toby?” John asks with an angelic face.
Sherlock explains Mycroft as best he can. John listens carefully.
Molly bought me a book about the periodic table, which brought me much comfort. I read it in bed that night. It had pictures. (You might like to read it. It is called The Elements, by Theodore Gray and is written for people who don’t like chemistry but wished that they did. If you’re missing the periodic chart, like I was, I daresay you’ll find it very comforting too.)
Sherlock paces up and down Jeremy’s street, swearing elegantly under his breath. John watches from the gate of the common.
There are things to read, chemicals to burn and observe but Sherlock is quite content to lie there and watch over John. It’s funny, he muses, how saying something sentimental fills you with the urge to act sentimental. Funny, too, how that process acts as an invisible glue that binds you both more closely together.
“What do the say?”
“Very well,” Sherlock answered.
Sherlock nods, considers two dozen things in the space of six seconds, then strides around until he finds a small nest of beer cans and cigarette butts in between several large crates. He tucks his hands in his pockets, for he has the evidence he needs, then turns back and addresses Lestrade directly: They’ve been drinking. Obvious. They’ve been called here for a specific purpose and ended up drinking, so they were waiting for a long time. There’s been a fight, he says, not a deliberate act of violence but an argument that ended with a single blow. The victim was at least on friendly terms with his assailant. They’ve sat together discussed commonalities, which is what lead to a disagreement. The offender hasn’t meant to kill him.
“Oh! I have something much better! Wait here.”
Sherlock shook his head. "No often, no."
“See how loved you were? We all adored you from the very start. And you were so smart! We knew almost immediately how clever you were.” Mummy takes a deep breath. “But I didn’t know that you were unnaturally smart and so emotionally cogniscent. There is no way I could have known, but if I did, I wouldn’t never had left your side. I am sorry that I didn’t know, but I know now, and I want you to know that I love you very, very much, that you are my best girl, and that I will always be your biggest advocate, and most devoted supporter. Do you understand that?”
“Taxes in all major European cities are unequally distributed,” Anya declared.
John is nodding with affable concord at the Head of Therapy who will supervise Rhonda at the hospital. Rhonda is swearing at her, John, Michelle and anyone else within earshot.
1. John was bisexual with a particular predilection for confident rebellious men.
“I still have it, if you want to see it. Police gave it back to me a few years after she disappeared.”
“What if you want sex but I don’t?”
Chapter 9.5
That somewhere in my day
“It’s not actual crying,” I explained. “It’s just mindless yelling.”
Sherlock grew more desperate.
That shut them up, at least for a few seconds.
“I was.” I wanted to add “not willingly” but bit my tongue just in time.
“Aeronautical engineer,” I told Lestrade and the doctor, both of whom raised their eyebrows in appreciation as they attached a series of plastic fish to the frame.
to consult on nineteen cases, solved fourteen of them, argued seven times, argued seriously once and made up with mutual apologies once. Sherlock had eaten seventeen full meals, picked at things like biscuits thirty one times and slept a total of fifty nine hours.
“What are they looking for?”
No one looks twice until he gets to a large shiny black car.
As soon as he hears the front door close, Sherlock bolts to his room for a ninety second shower. He dresses carefully in a navy blue Paul Smith suit and organises his curls with a Kent comb.
And he slowly lifted his chin from the blanket.
Years of hot chips for dinner
It was brilliant timing and eased the slightly strained atmosphere considerably. Sally laughed and I flicked John a quick, raised eyebrow look. He nodded almost imperceptibly, thus agreeing with me that Sally is indeed very pretty.
“About three hundred quid.” Jeremy is squirming, wholly mortified to have been caught and to be made explain, in front of his mother and the police, what he has done and why.
It transpired that my spreadsheet was of no consequence, for Lestrade called us and invited us to Scotland Yard to look at some documents to pertaining to a very large shipment of narcotics.  The high chair and jars of banana yoghurt were put on hold.
“I was in the army. Did I tell you about that? We built all kinds of shelters and buildings in Khandar. Basic dwellings, shelters – all part of general training.”
Adrian yelled at me more loudly for digressing just as he was getting interested.
It was an impasse that Albion managed to solve when he cried very loudly at being lumbered now with two idiots who were unable to feed him with any punctuality.
Mrs Best nods. “They were brand new. I’d bought them only a two days before.” She takes another deep, sad breath before the dark cold space that surrounds her. “I brought them half a size too big, because she was growing so fast…the lady in the shoe shop said she would grow into them soon enough. That’s why she lost one, I suppose, it came loose because it was a little too big.”
“Ah, good. You’re both awake.” Mycroft was wearing his business face. “I trust you’ve all recovered from yesterday’s ordeal?”
Sherlock has returned his attention to his microscope. “Watch out for the squirrels in the park.”
Time has made me fluent in John Watson.
It’s Jeremy who Sherlock wants to target. John calls Lestrade, because Jeremy is only sixteen. Sherlock paid scant attention as John went on and on about young people’s rights.
In his mind he sees the marks on Sherlock’s back, freshly laid, wet and glittering with blood and sweat.
and talking about John as if she's known him for years.
His kisses are the colour of bluebells, daisies and tulips
Sherlock has gone into a bit of a haze and takes a few seconds to realise exactly what John is asking. "Certainly. Of course. I have a couch."
Sherlock is wiping his mouth again with a paper serviette. His mouth feels tacky with imaginary foam.
We lay there smiling at one another while I worked out how to extract more information from him. The rage was still there – a rage in reaction to someone threatening what was his. I could still sense it, yet as I stroked his hand and pressed my thumb to his radial pulse, everything felt calm and composed.
John takes her extended hand gently.
“Well, we’d better be quick then, “ Sherlock says.
The same, but different: both John and I were different men from the two who shared the flat four years ago.  Better men, I believe. John and I had amassed some interesting and frequently painful life experiences.
Sherlock’s worried that John’s not impressed. “Should I have got another balloon?”
Sherlock starts to weep again. “Very much. But (sniff) I want you to be the cleverest lady that ever was (sniff) so Mycroft is going to help me make sure that you are very happy here. And if you aren’t (sniff) I am going to steal a boat and come and get you and sneak you home!”
The quiche is interesting. Half of it has slices of tomato cooked over the surface, the other half has no tomato.
This interesting conversation was cut short by a phone call from Lestrade, reminding Sherlock that he would meet him at the hospital.
When Sherlock gets home that night he doesn't do any lines and he doesn't think about the likelihood of never having any friends. Instead he has a bath during which he soaks quietly while carefully fitting each toe, one by one, into the tap with varying success, dries off on a clean towel, changes into clean pyjamas and settles into bed quite comfortably, remembering the rare nights at home during the Christmas breaks when he would be dozing, close to sleep, and the soft scent of Cabochard would sparkle on the dark air around him, a small strong hand would pat his back and he'd feel her beautiful face up close as she kissed his temple.
That I will love you
“Why are you still awake?” he asked him in his special love voice, stroking the downy little head.
It is awkward. No one knows what to say. Julia hangs around them, sneering in the cold room.
"Right. Right. Stitches won't break now, of course. Right." He takes his breath in sharply when
"I was just walking. Why? Where were you going?" "To catch a murderer."
Molly is as interesting and kindly as Mrs Hudson but more law abiding. She’s not dull, though. She is incredibly perceptive. Doctor Eddie would say she has an extremely high emotional intelligence. Which she has.
Sherlock is confused. “Did you seriously believe that was going to work?”
He looked at me carefully. “Where have you been? I haven’t heard from you for days. I thought you might be sick.” Which was code for: I thought you were chasing the dragon again.
Albion chose that very moment to squeak. The man turned back to me instantly.
“I’m using it as notepaper at work. Why? Do you want it?”
He was parenting my little boy. It made my insides feel soft and unsound. It was sentiment and it was beautiful.
“Sherlock, I’ve known you for nearly five years. You’re actually going to be a magnificent boyfriend, and so am I, because you are exactly everything I want.”
For he is haunted by them still.
“Like that,” Sherlock whispers. “Exactly like that, except I could never actually imagine something like that.”
"Oh, Scotland yard?" He's knotting the first stitch.
Lestrade holds the lamp high and spotlights a young woman in a pool of blood. John looks away with a heavy heart.
That night, after his successful squirrel poem, he is burying his face deep in John’s crotch, inhaling the heavy smokey scent of his balls and rubbing his cheek along the delicate Watson shaft. John’s moans are short and deep; his movement gives away a lot more than his voice.
He flicks through them silently and stops short when he comes to a seventh photo, which shows the footpath outside the child’s house, and a close up of a small brown shoe, a new shoe, laying on its side.
John and Sherlock are waiting in their seats, and John extends his hand to usher the client in to the empty chair before them.
"No, London."
So vast was his intellect that, not long after Sherlock's birth, he had to give up teaching entirely because his thoughts had become too complex, and his reasoning too brilliant, so that neither students nor his fellows could understand him. Dissertations are still undertaken today by foolhardy, ambitious post graduate students, desperately trying to unravel his extraordinary thinking.
Jeremy has just turned 16. He appears, to John, to be all bones, a tall spare lad with straight brown hair and sad blue eyes. He is clean, neatly dressed and very nervous of the police and especially of Sherlock.
"Why?"
Saturday. He was born on a Saturday; that the idea of dying on a Saturday is satisfying for him is testament to how depressed he is.
Sherlock answers from the kitchen. “She’s got a ghost.”
“Oh, it’d definitely be you.”
This suggestion gives John a cold chill, and he immediately sees Rosie broken, hastily dropped in a ditch, her clothes and blocks tossed in beside her.
I have said before that John is a conductor of light and once more he was operating on full voltage. The drops on the table were just that – drops, not spray – which indicated that the victim had apparently staggered by the table before he collapsed.
John’s heart is crowded with doubt. This isn’t right. Sherlock shouldn’t be so happy. Angelo’s is ours. Caroline should irritate him. Why is he being so gracious?
A few years ago John and I would have exorcised our perplexity or rage with aggression; tonight we proved it could be alchemised into astonishing pleasure.
“I’m going to tell you about Snow White. She was a very beautiful princess who lived with her beautiful but nasty stepmother. The stepmother had a talking mirror, which is the kind of things ladies in fairy stories often have.
"The street hasn't been the same since you left."
They both laugh, their best kind of laughter, together, happy in a taxi after they’ve solved a case.
"And if interferes with the cases I'll just quit."
Sherlock stretches out his hand. "Give me your mobile phone."
The next night when he comes there is only a quick glance and instant understanding. Sherlock silently rolls over and lifts his shirt himself. The poultice is different tonight.
“It’s just wonderful to hold a baby again,” John said out of the blue.
There's Sherlock, furiously trying to remain a moving target, which of course is harder to stab than a terrified, still one.
Then he tackled the secondary conclusion:
"Only if I want to taste nice for my partner," John tells him.
“Shut your mouth!” the enraged father spits. “My son is not a bully and you certainly have no right to speak to him like this!
Sherlock celebrates solving the case with a bowl of long life noodles at a nice Chinese restaurant nearby that he knows stays open late. He finishes with three fortune cookies which he always enjoys because of how they contradict one another, then goes home and sits in the dark and ponders blood clots.
“Frottage is nice. I can do that, you know. I can show you if you’d like.”
In the distance her cat Toby can be seen half way up the curtains, swinging lightly from side to side as he watched them all with enormous, mad eyes.
For he knows where to hide the biscuits.
"Thank you, sir!" the resident says, and he rushes back to his patient.
Having the house to himself and five days free of squalid humping in every room should have been a cause for celebration, but John is barely moved. Nothing surprises, interests or delights him any more.
Charlotte and the Warlock are in the kitchen. They've only been back for a few hours but already the house harbours that unmistakable stench of careless sex.
Well, thank God for Uncle Rudy, because who knows what might have happened.
Cognitive Therapy
I tried to call John Watson to tell him I loved him, or at least leave a message, but the number had been disconnected. Then I checked his blog only to find it had been taken down.
Sherlock can see this and tosses him a lifeline. "You're fine to practice." He watches how carefully John prepares the dressing, how carefully he applies it to the slightly throbbing wound. "Are you living alone?"
“Why are you here?” Sherlock says when he answers the door. His eyes pass over her quickly and the deductions rise through his brain like bubbles in champagne.
I took notes about the way he reacted to burping and how long it took him to get to sleep. Then I took notes about how frequently he moved in his sleep. (He moved his little fists a lot, which I am certain he gets from me, because I gesticulate frequently, especially when I am explaining things.)
The nice home is being paid off, with some financial stress, by a solicitor called Charlotte, who insists as soon as they meet that John call her Charlie. She works at one of the big law firms in the City and is hoping to become an expert in intellectual property, which is, of course, booming. As they talk, John learns that until recently Charlotte - who doesn't really strike John as a Charlie - wanted to be an expert in criminal law.
“Can’t hurt,” the breathless Watson said after we laughed some more.
Albion stretched his arms out so I’d lift him up to rest under my chin. I was his number one choice for cuddles, entertainment and personal hygiene. He took that care and protection as read and I’d been unable to provide it. John Watson, though, had been able to step for me without hesitation.
John shakes his head. “No. All you have to know is that is nothing like your speech, and that I’m saying nice things.”
"We're all married to our work. A good job's important, but you have to make time for special friends."
"Oh God, yes." John lays a two weeks' rent on the counter. "Thanks for the shelter."
Rhonda, not so much.
But the older woman interrupted. “I’m Sue Powers, and this is Alicia Briggs. I’m a case manager, and Alicia’s a social worker. We’re from London Central Social Services.”
He gently rests his index finger at the bird's wee soft chest and it hops on without fear. John slowly lifts his finger up to face level and looks closely at the pretty little creature.
It changes the energy they have generated. John is reminded of victims of torture he has seen and indeed treated, Sherlock is reminded of an awful time when John was so far from him in many ways.
“Yeah, do that.” What Sherlock thinks is of no consequence because Billy has already thumbed through his wallet and handed over Ademar’s business card, and has decided to send Ademar a text. Billy likes Sherlock and thinks he of all people would benefit from a real miracle. Can’t hurt. “Anyway, best get going. I’ve got a craving for falafel and Lebanese pickles. Sing out if you need any favours!”
“You should have told me I gave you straight boy pain. I could have told you that this is not one sided. It’s mutual. There’s no pain.”
Knowing the intractable Watson like I do, and based on my recent deductions of Nanny Anya, I’m assuming they’ll still be staring each other out when Albion graduates from university.)
“A hunter. Usually associated with the Regent.”
"Sit still," he tells the head for the fourth time as it rolls across the table. The half closed eyes are cloudy and downward cast and its heavy lips are gaping slightly. The tongue is pushed back well behind the teeth; Sherlock wonders if Molly perhaps pinned it in place. He stops and thinks about that for a few seconds, forgets the scales and starts fossicking in the cold mouth with careful fingers.
Lestrade dropped by whenever he felt like it - early morning sometimes, late afternoon other times. These seemingly spontaneous visits were planned, obviously to catch me if I was using drugs again.
"But I'm safe."
He hadn’t said he loved me. I was aware that might be an issue but I didn’t care. He’d rescued me from Social Services, held my baby and brought his luggage upstairs. There were (relatively) clean sheets on my bed.
Things like that.
Sherlock had to think for a moment. There was little purpose to balloons but he wanted to make the effort. “You could shoot them.”
Lestrade shook his head. “We don’t think she is. I’ve looked at her hospital records. She was entirely clean when she had Albion, which rules out her using at least a fortnight before he was born.”
“Seriously, unless this story starts getting better I really don’t want to hear any more.”
John was quiet for a long time.
“Yes, that’s the intention.” Sherlock can only meet his eyes for a second before he must look away. “So…are you keeping them?”
“Of all the things Mary could do to me, that was the cruelest.” John smiled then, and wrinkled his nose a me a little. “That and shooting you.”
From this point the days started to become more varied, and Albion’s growth started to become quite significant. He stopped being a new born, and became a young baby, about to join that snappy 3 – 6 month old age group who I saw described so frequently on websites and baby products.
Sherlock pretends to think for a moment. “No,” he says with dramatic emphasis, and Molly and Greg exchange amused glances.  John watches briefly, wondering what they would be like as a couple. Sherlock breaks his reverie.
She drops it as he approaches and John, who has fought violent addicts in emergency wards, the Taliban, crazed villagers and his own troops on odd occasions when they lost their minds, can barely bring himself to look at it.
Mike, not Molly,  took my blood. “I don’t get enough practice!” he said with his hearty laugh.  He was right – it took him three jabs to pierce my scarred vein.
"Nope. no one saw anything. Person like the Broken Beer Bottle Murderer would have to had enemies though, maybe they followed him here...not much to go on, unfortunately."
The picture on the postcard was of a nondescript building that was apparently a pub in the centre of Melbourne. It appears Dr Watson enjoyed the local beer there. I studied the pen strokes carefully but there was still no sign that he was coming home.
“We’re going to meet a pretty lady,” I told Albion as I counted the fare into the tray.
“He would have done the same thing as the Woodsman. He would have helped the Snow White run away. Actually, he would have walked through the woods with the Snow White, got her to the cottage, made sure the washing up was done, folded all the washing and made her some toast. Then he would have waited for the dwarves to come home and threatened all of them with his gun to ensure no harm came to Snow White.
“Yes, obviously. There’s no slip marks here. The blow has knocked him out cold, he’s fallen like a tree and cracked his skull. How long would he lived?”
"Are you the bird man?" she asks wearily.
John does a double take. It can’t be.
Albion made noises at us to remind us not to ignore him.
Still it sits there. Rhonda mews behind him. How did my life get to this, John wonders sadly.
There's the broken bottle, held high by the other man with the sparkling lethal shards pointing at Sherlock.
I got your postcards. SH
But gifts aren’t always obvious, or straightforward. Jennifer Bannister took the gift of closure to Corinne Best when she decided to seek help from my father, but poor Mrs Best never learnt how her daughter was found.
Sherlock watches John’s reflection in the window and sees that beautiful smile superimposed against the bleary shades of London, John’s understanding blooming slowly, first in his eyes, then through all the delicate muscles of his face., shy at first and then stretched out across his face, the illumination that he provides for Sherlock lighting up the space between them.
“Hello,” I said eventually. “How are you?”
Mostly though, if I am honest,  the main reason I stayed was because I missed John horribly, and I thought that if I could convince everyone I was well enough, I could pack up and walk around the world and try and catch up with him.
It’s a kind thought, and John is very grateful.
My desperate outburst at the hospital was not the first time I told John I loved him. I told him once after he left his wife (and came straight to me and slept in my bed), twice after I was shot and once when I came to after the first operation and saw him sitting there, reading a copy of Hello magazine with a slightly confused face.
“It’s heard before a judge at the family court, then papers are signed. I can organise to have the matter listed for hearing tomorrow.”
Sherlock has his hands behind his back and regards John carefully.
"I'm around for at least a month," Billy says with true concern. "Do you want me to fix it for you?" He holds up both fists and tightens an invisible cord.
“I’m confident I could preserve my safely amongst squirrels.”
John drops the beam to the floor and there she is, mummified from the cold and left as she was dropped forty two years ago, Mariah Best in a red and yellow frock, white socks and one brown Clarks shoe.
he feels the warm damp kisses. Dimly he wonders if Sherlock had been waiting to do this for ten
“He hasn’t said he doesn’t, so I’m assuming that he does.”
“Oh! That reminds me! We had a client day before yesterday who mentioned something about a missing child. Do you have files on missing kids that have never been found? Anything I could look at, at least?”
I had to buy a tin of powder – largely proteins and amino acids in a benign base – so he could eat.
He wonders if they ever wipe down the shared surfaces afterwards. The thought nags him to bilious caution and he stops eating at home.
“But you are, to Mycroft, your parents, and to me.”
It's not getting clearer for John. "Mummy? Who's mummy?"
John blinked at him, a little confused, but there wasn’t time to engender an argument.
“This is good,” he whispered in my ear.
“We’re good,” he concluded. “We’re going to be great once we get our trousers undone.”
We all looked very respectable.
“It’s amazing, isn’t it.”
Sherlock taps his fingers lightly across John’s clavicle. “We’re connected.”
John closes his eyes. No one has seen it; most days John himself can barely bring himself to look at it.
John had seen this on the front pages in the last week. He nods affably.
“You hate tomato that much?”
And just like that he walked away, leaving me holding a discharge sheet and a bottle of codeine in one hand, my stitched abdominal cavity in the other.
He looks through the contents of the trolley, going over a mental list so well worn that it comes to him like a poem he's memorised. It's only missing a couple of things.
He looks straight into the pretty cobra eyes. "I'm wearing too many clothes for this. Do you mind if I take my jacket off?"
John has no idea what they are but figures it has something to do with Greg’s workload. He’s about to ask when Greg explains.
Ms Powers and I stood in my bedroom,  watching while John Watson very carefully lay Albion on my bed and lifted off his little t-shirt.
For he is a fine addition to any social gathering.
“I want to see her.”
“Made it at school in metalwork.” Jeremy barely whispers. At Lestrade’s insistence Jeremy fetches his weapon and places it on the table. It is a replica, nothing more. It has no shooting mechanisms.
Families are strange. People talk about dysfunctional families as if they’re an unusual or avoidable phenomenon but I don’t actually know of a functional one.
“Poor girl,” she said sadly. “I hope she gets some help.”
"You're a curious bugger, aren't you?"
He took my face in both damp hands. He was on the edge of expanding his view of spectacular but he didn’t have too, because I could see it in his eyes. I love his smile when I he knows I’ve second-guessed his thoughts.
"I only have a sister and I haven't seen her since I got back." John snicks the tail on the fourth stitch and leans back to inspect his handiwork. "Probably another three. How am I doing for time?"
"Shut up. It's a good word."
When he was fractious I would talk to him about weather. I explained high pressure systems, low pressure systems, how thunder and lightening are formed and what scientists currently surmise is the rate of global warming.
John stands quite still for several seconds while a new storm of anger and jealousy rumbles through him. He stretches his fingers, looking around for something to break. Something glass, something large, something that will provide loud, satisfying indelible proof of its condition as it is destroyed.
After John has eaten a lot and Sherlock has eaten a little, they toss the box of crusts to one side and curl up the floor on Sherlock's cotton sheets. John is exhausted after a day of walking, a day of grieving and a night of murder, Sherlock - not so much. He waits until John rolls over and looks at all the marks on his back. There are lots of little recessions, tiny little dips which perfectly accommodate a fingertip. Rugby player, Sherlock realises, and puts that in the John Room as well.
He swung the baseball bat ever so slightly, sneering at me.  “Hands up. All of you, Hands up.”
John intervenes delicately to contain any malfunction. “I love being held like this,” he says dreamily.
“Would you like me to tell you a story?”
The both turned their stern glances to me.
Sherlock lays down beside him. "Do you want me to turn off the light?"
“Let’s not make hasty conclusions,” I smiled back.
"And?"
Mummy wondered, given Eurus’s evident understanding, if the child might accept an honest explanation, and if this might help restore her self esteem. She had her husband send a home movie, a special little compilation of a very happy time.
“SHERLOCK!” everyone says loudly and with great disapproval.
“Yes.”
On his way home John stopped for some groceries and added a few sweet things to his basket. Soft sweeties like caramels had, during previous depressions, helped lever Sherlock out of his black holes of misery.
Molly shakes her head, “In my opinion, no, not after she was unconscious. But I think that happened as she was carried down to the cellar. She must have been terrified before that.”
Mycroft straightened up and looked me over. His face seemed placid but I knew he wasn’t pleased. “How are you feeling, Sherlock?”
“Do you only have neck wounds?”
John does what he's told. The sheets smell nice.
“Sherlock Holmes. Fancy seeing you here.”
“But right,” John whispers. “It feels right.”
“And Doctor Watson, you understand that if I grant this order, you will be, in the eyes of the law, Albion’s legal parent?”
Sherlock is dissecting a tongue on the other side of the table. "I expect that's how the Scotland Yard Media Unit phrased it on their media releases."
“You are brilliant, you know that, don’t you?”
Where are you?
Albion started crying because I was an idiot who couldn’t follow simple instructions.
“See?” Mycroft tells Sherlock, whose sobs are gradually being reduced to quiet weeping. “See how clever our precious baby sister is? Uncle Rudy has found some of the cleverest people in the WHOLE WORLD to help keep her clever, and to find new ways to help her become an even more clever grown up lady.”
“Of course, of course we can.” John, though, is filling with electricity of his own, angry, sour voltage he can’t diffuse. He starts to whisper to Sherlock, small, private regrets that Sherlock was hurt this way, his commitment that no one will ever hurt him again.
“Aren’t you having one?”
“I know how it sounds,” she sighs. “I don’t believe in ghosts. I’m not even interested in ghosts. If someone told me this I’d tell them they need to see a doctor. But it’s happening to me, I and I don’t know what to do.”
“So you’ve been caring for him alone?” Ms Powers was disbelieving.
“Trust me. It’s sensational.”
When John comes home he finds a poem tucked in his favourite mug:
Albion was completely dismissive of the whole thing, sucking down synthetic milk like there was no tomorrow.  I caught that little smirk of satisfaction on his tiny dial and my heart did that thing again.
John has just folded his jacket to a neat parcel on the floor. "Actually, you might want to leave your shirt on."
"You use fancy soap," John says when he appears fresh and clean some twenty minutes later.
“No marks on his arms,” the Doctor confirmed as he lifted Albion’s vest. “That’s quite a six pack you’ve got there, little man! Clear on his chest. Sit up for me, darling, I’m just going to have a look at your back. There, that’s the way. No marks on his shoulders or back.”
No matter how stiff the memory is now, it still aches when she considers how Mariah lost her shoe, how hard she must have struggled.
“No. He was a complete prat. He kept two of my footballs when I accidently kicked them into his yard. You know the type. Hates everyone, always complaining. I thought it was funny that whenever we called the cat he’d think someone was calling him. He wasn’t amused, and called the council to complain. I don’t know what he thought the council would do.” John yawned and ran his hands over his hair. “Did you have a pet?”
I was under the impression that a dummy was a bad thing, but monitoring Albion’s saliva production with and without a dummy was a tantalizing thought.
"Would you mind if I blogged about it?"
"Bengals," Sherlock says as he scans the road for a cab. "I particularly like Bengals. They have nice markings. And I should like an Airedale too. Excellent snouts."
Sherlock’s perplexed. He still maintains that he has no friends, only one.
John tosses the 20 pound note to the driver, doesn't wait for change and again steers the stranger by the elbow towards the front desk, who send him straight to the Triage desk.
Sherlock and John attended, and Greg sat up the front.
Building a case against Julia will be near impossible. The theory was sound, but it can’t be substantiated with hard evidence. Other theories can’t be discounted unless there is incontrovertible proof: perhaps Sherlock is right -  the child tripped and hit her head on the fence, and Julia panicked, and quickly hid her in the car? Did Julia hit her, and cause the skull fracture?
He ushered them to the sitting room and sat them both down.
“For someone who doesn’t take relationships seriously, you have a surprisingly clear insight into their machinations.”
Sherlock grimaced inwardly. Reverting to the unloved and unloving man he had once been seemed out of his skill set now. That’s the problem with love, Sherlock realised. Once you’ve had a taste it’s impossible not to look forward to the next hit. It is indeed a chemical imbalance, not unlike that of narcotic dependence.
But she rocked him, the woman, rocked him the way tidal waves rock the delicate ecologies of sea beds. It was not just her naked skin, dull and smooth like clotted creamed contrasted with the coal black of her hair and pubic hair and contrasted again with the ruby smear of her painted mouth and her small nipples which would disappear entirely under a curious thumb tip. It wasn't her coy smile or even the heady waves of Patou's 1000, the most complex and extravagant perfume ever created, that radiated from the thin tight skin on the nape of her neck and clung in small thin clouds in her hair.
The precious fabric from a rare lotus
Sherlock is on his belly in front of the fridge, armed with a wire coat hanger.
"Sorry?"
It was becoming apparent that she really doesn’t like me.
"It depends on the temperature of the water! I'm not sure why that is, but hot water seems to weigh less. I haven't worked out why."
“Best friend?” John wondered.
John listens very closely to the whole story but gets lost in the details about the phones. Lestrade, who has actually read the case file and spoken to Sherlock about it several times, is no wiser.
For he is entertaining.
“George.”
“I’ve never noticed,” John answered with a perfectly straight face.
“Shut up. The Prince gave the Detective all kinds of information, which led to the arrest of all three assailants. And the Detective came back two nights later to ask the Prince’s opinion about something else. And so on.”
"I keep a low profile. I never talk to journalists. Easier to work if no one knows who I am and how I work."
Aside from the head and injury, the child’s skeleton is in tact..
"Sherlock! Great to see you!" He grabs Sherlock by the shoulder and kisses him extravagantly on both cheeks.
“Oo oo,” Albion told me as he lifted him out of his day bed and settled onto the floor with him. He had just started saying vowels, always in response to my speaking clearly to him, provided I kept my face about eighteen inches from his.
John Watson was still showering when Anya came to start work.
"Renzo," says Sherlock affectionately. "Good to see you too."
His feet are hurting but his hands are remarkably still and his leg feels great. The cane is almost redundant. He's tempted to just drop it in the gutter but part of him wants it found alongside his body, partly because he's been using it for so long now and it feels like part of his landscape, and partly because it helps provide a reason for why he's leaving early.
"Stamford! Mike Stamford! We trained here together!"
“Yes! He did not vomit for me at all.”
I consulted Albion for his views. “Do you want to come with John and I to a boring cold warehouse full of seized narcotics?” He swung his legs and cooed at me, which was clearly a delighted affirmative.
Curing patients of some tiresome malady.
“I had no idea…I would never put him in danger. It was unexpected.”
I took a deep breath. “Will you stay?”
It is agreed that they must track down Julia. No one suspected her, and it seems unlikely that that she would have been involved, but they all hope that she might have the one elusive clue needed to close this case.
The height of each suspect would help clarify who was mostly to have inflicted the wound. But in order to assess that , I’d need to measure the wound and compare it to similar wounds.
"Mr Holmes," John says convincingly.
There is no time to read the poem again – there’s someone outside with a blocked nose and streaming eyes who has been waiting days for an appointment and has been squeezed in ahead of the rest of the day’s patients – but John manages another read just after 11am and two more considered reads over lunch.
“John did it,” Sherlock corrected. He smiles, admiring her bright eyes and clear skin. “I see you’re getting better sleep now.”
“Goodnight,” he says politely, and he walks down the street, wondering how long it would take him to get back to Regents Park.
It was horrendous to see him like this. I wanted to fix it. “Do you want to try and get her back? Mycroft would help.”
Sherlock looks at them both as if he might bang their heads together.
He bickers with her for a few seconds. John is quite fascinated by her rudeness and impressed with Sherlock's complete indifference to it. Detective Donovan is snarky but starts to concede; Sherlock loses interest and waits for John to enter too. Detective Donovan announces his arrival into her radio.
“It’s actually very easy,” I assured him. “You’re designed to be able to do this, so you can then progress to crawling and walking.” I stretched my face up a little. “Like this. See?”
“Not really. She was quite friendly and very clever but she was duplicitous and she shot me, very badly, on one occasion. I had to make up some lies about it so John wouldn’t break up with her because she was pregnant – that is, she was pretending to be pregnant – and John was looking forward to being a father. He’s always wanted to have a nice wife and a family.” Sherlock considered this and made an amendment. “Actually, I think he wanted to see if he’d like a nice wife and a family but it turned out he didn’t much, and in any case she wasn’t a very nice wife.”
There were, unsurprisingly, no frogs but I leant over to get a thorough look (early evidence of an aptitude for eliminating all that is impossible), overbalanced and sunk straight to the bottom.
We all sat down at the kitchen table except Anthea, who was still bothering her phone.
“Yes. I’ll actually do it myself.”
Sherlock walks all over London for hours, thinking about nothing and everything. He ends up staying at Mycroft’s, who assumes John has kicked him out, perhaps after a fight of some kind. Mycroft’s every endeavour to learn more is met with a sour face and mild abuse and he gives up after the eighth try.
For his fills my life completely.
"PUT YOUR TROUSERS ON!"
“Look!”
It was Molly Hooper, holding a box that could have housed a small dining room table.
The front door of the number 17 opens and a woman in a business suit steps out. She closes the door behind her, and instantly recognises John, just a few feet away at her front gate. “Dr Watson!” she says, surprised.
“So,” John says brightly, “Mike’s coming, Molly’s coming and Cranky’s coming. You interested?”
“Okay. Do you think you’re in love with John?”
When he drifts off he's back in John's Room, which is cream with a navy trim and has a few files stacked on the floor but when he wakes in the morning it is overgrown with beautiful green plants and the ceiling is open to a clear sky, and all the things he knows about John are written on pieces of stiff paper and pinned to branches at various heights.
He sighs as he reads through the typed pages. It’s a common story – the child was dressed for an outing, and ran outside to collect the mail. She never returned. Her mother went out about six minutes later and the street was empty. A postman told police later that he had seen a dark coloured car in the street, but didn’t notice the make or in which direction it went. He didn’t see the child.
She sighs. "Come in, then."
Children aren’t easy to raise, relationships are relentless hard work, but the delight they cause me outweighs every disadvantage - John when he reaches out for me in his sleep, Bonnie when she stops in the park to show me a flower or Albion, when he comes home from Preschool with another impossible-to-decipher painting that he made just for us. (A couple of weeks ago his teacher told the class to paint something blue and red: my brilliant boy painted Doctor Watson in scrubs, holding a liver with the artery still attached. I’ve had it framed.)
The stranger nods. He's busy collecting data.
“Did you go to Pembroke College?”
“Are you going to paint stripes?”
“It’s yours,” is all she said.
All that beer and whiskey means that John’s not quite as robust as usual but it doesn’t mean he’s not up for some playful groping and coarse whispers. He sighs when he feels Sherlock’s careful hand easing into his trousers, sighs as his flaccid cock is cradled in safe hands, smiles as he settles into his pillow to enjoy Sherlock bucking against him, looking after his own pleasure but keeping John close, their clothes and shoes dropping to the floor one by one. Sherlock takes his time, comes comfortably over John’s belly and cleans him up with his shirt. They wind themselves together and John smiles as he drifts off, Sherlock rocking their bodies very gently into the heavy tide of sleep.
John restores his trousers just enough to guide Sherlock to the couch. He holds his eyes, loosening the expensive clothes while he watches his face.
“Did what? Put my phone here? I did, I suppose, unless you’ve taken it upon yourself to putting it in obvious places. If you did, thank you.” Sherlock held his phone up and smiled merrily, only to stop short when he saw John’s face. “What? What have I done now?”
John takes a deep breath. “We should get married.”
He can open it like a tunnel.
“He told me you might drop by, yes. Please come in. Would you like a cup of tea?”
Sherlock sighs into his pillow. As if.
Not long after Mariah’s funeral, Dad and Sherlock went to see Mrs Best, and explained Sherlock’s deductions, and gave her the gift  of acceptance, or at least led her closer to it. That I remember well, because there were photos everywhere of the little girl. She was pretty.
Sherlock halts, shifts uncomfortably on his seat. “Yes.”
I've got two psoriatic corpses if you're interested.
“If they think he’s in immediate danger, yes. But that’s the theory. In my opinion, just looking at him now in his fancy nappy and fat as a fool, I’d say not a chance.”
They fall silent as they move in perfect rhythm, over to the east of London, turn to the side and face the north, then around again and dance silently to the west, and around again, over the south.
Mycroft put his nose in the air, the way he always does when someone objects to his pomposity. John Watson barely moved but stared straight at him, saying, “I told you so” with out uttering a word.
“NO! But don’t come in, I haven’t got any clothes on.”
Mycroft is non-committal. John has never seen him like this before – ordinarily his opinions are resolute and invariably built to withstand any challenge.
Bob shrugs. "Depends on the boss. If he's got a habit himself - and you know a lot of them are very fond of cocaine- he's going to be paranoid."
He waits for Lestrade to leave before grabbing John ecstatically. "What a day! Mummy visits, brings cake, doesn't invite Mycroft and then there's an unsolved quadruple homicide with the evidence all preserved in a wall! It's things like this that remind me how much I love you! Grab your coat."
“Har Mee with chilli sambal?”
“Mrs Hudson would be heartbroken too.”
“Oral sex. Frottage.”
John plonks his groceries on the table and tears the envelope open quickly. He’s terrified Sherlock has gone off and harmed himself, or scaled the Hindu Kush, joined the merchant navy or done any number of disastrous, distant things that John hasn’t imagined yet.
The victim lies in a corner, although John and Sherlock can’t see him when they walk through the icy warehouse towards the large circle of police officers and forensic staff.
"Will you bring home another head?" John tries to say this casually but Sherlock can detect tiny creaks in his voice.
"Ida wouldn't haven't a clue, God bless her heart. Still, as you wish."
John laughed. “You think shooting balloons is romantic?”
“Albion. Yes, although I often stop what I’m doing to have a quick cuddle or maybe feed him.”
“Solids! You clever chap! We’ll have you tucking into a roast in no time.”
“That was his favourite book at the time. He wanted it to be yours too.”
"No. I jutht KNOW how to pickpocket. There's a vatht difference."
Do either have crumbly nails?
“I am better. The only reason I’m here is because I use a lot of drugs sometimes.”
Albion started yelling at me for waking him up and making him hang around in the hall.
"You know, the therapy cat at my nana's nursing home died a couple of weeks ago. The nurses there are looking for new cat."
They're just about to set off and look at the room when a voluminous champagne coloured cat
Sherlock pretend-shoots at his wall again but its only making it worse, so he looks out the
“Why won’t you come on cases with me?” Sherlock asked him after he had solved the third one alone.
John shakes his head as he closes the third stitch. "Nothing special. Your tongue seems to be getting better. "
“ I have babies for people. Some people can’t and, you know, it really gets them down. The lady I’m having one for now had depressions for a year and she’s so happy now. I’m going to get her husband’s jizz when I go back to New York. She said if they like the first one that they’d have a second.”
“But you did it.”
“All kinds of boring things. Nothing interesting, except the Prince got busted for using drugs on the Northern line tube and while he was being bailed, Gilroy turned up and told the Prince that he couldn’t ask his opinion on crimes if he was a junky, and if he’d go to rehab Gilroy would let Prince go to some crime scenes. That was acceptable, and eventually Gilroy called him to a murder, which the Prince solved in four hours. And so the Prince kept solving murders and was deliriously happy and only using drugs when he was bored. He wheedled his way into the labs at St Bart’s with his brother’s help and had access to the sophisticated lab equipment there. He got a nice flat by himself on Montague Street and lived there for four years until the landlord died and his son, who was having an affair with three married women, kicked the Prince out.”
"Ah. Then that explains the aggression and paranoia."
“Anything?” I asked.
“Mycroft had a nurse dress it when we got to Germany.” Sherlock flinches again when John runs his fingers over the scores.
“And if I don’t do that?”
He looks up at Sherlock and exercises every last shred of effort not to burst out laughing.
Sherlock feels comfortable there.
“Oh! You really do want to – oh, marvelous, no, one-two-three, two- two three and back, yes, that’s right … perfect.”
“Yes.”
I never thought I would have cause to say this, but it was the most pleasant period I had ever spent with my family. Granted, that’s not really saying very much because we never have pleasant times together. Which is odd, because we actually are very fond of each other.
John sits up a little straighter and Sherlock, laying with his head in his lap, winds his arm around John’s waist and pushes his face into his belly.
John freezes when he reads the response. Sherlock feels his tension.
“To  - just to be certain. That he’s yours. In case she was lying.”
Sherlock was barely visible in all of these incidences, because they were so large, and so consuming for many people.
Sherlock nods, smiling. “No one,” he says as he settles into John’s arms. “Never.”
“Yes, he did. Mycroft and Sherlock said they wanted a full movie about you.”
“Ah.” Mycroft is neutral. The unexplained neither interests or annoys him. It has no impact on him anymore, so he has no need to form an opinion.
I planned to have memorized that entire catalogue by the time Albion turned one.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“I’m not teary.” And when he remembers who exactly he is talking with, “Happiness. Sentiment.”
It ended almost as soon as it started. “I will now take Mr Albion to the park. I will see you both later, Mr Sherlock and Mr John.”
(I dutifully ignored the love bit. He said it in the heat of the moment and I thought it would be more appropriate to make our declarations when we were relaxed and possibly clothed. I didn’t want to scare him away.)
"No. I mean, I like her, and she was a great cat, and I know you'd like to but no. I couldn't do that to Ida."
“Ms Bannister, I must apologise for my rudeness when you called the other day. I am sorry to have disregarded your inquiry. Please forgive me.”
Sherlock gets it immediately and stretches his arm across John's chest. "Sorry, sorry, my mistake. You told me you were invalided, I didn't factor for post traumatic distress. I apologise."
Anywhere you like, I told the academic doctor. My treat.
But it is none of these. Instead John Watson has just received his first ever poem, written completely for him by the one person who loves him more than he has been able to say:
"Are you a real hospital doctor or one of those university doctors?"
I was starting to think it would be quicker if a I published a brochure about how Albion came to be my son. “No. He was born at University College Hospital.”
John and Mike have decided to see one of the Six Nations Rugby matches.
He slumps back on the floral pillow, exhausted, ashamed and full of loathing. Shona lays heavily next to him, snoring softly with the tiniest growl on each exhale. John pushes her shoulder gently and she shifts slightly, the growl reduced to gentle puffs.
Roaring babies are stressful. No one knows why they are roaring and according to John Watson, parents give up wondering why their baby is crying after about four nights. The focus shifts to getting the baby to stop crying. According to my observations of Albion, a baby will stop crying when they feel like it.
“Oh, then she definitely has. Military training was compulsory for the East Germans.” John leaned forward so I could see Albion’s face. “Is he asleep?”
I chose the latter. My apologies to any person with delicate legal sensibilities who feels blighted by my actions.
"Doctor, can I check something with you?"
"I know.' The older lady extends her hand. "I'm Amarita Crisp."
Sherlock is about 7 miles away.
He hates work because everyone is so nice to him because they think of him as a disabled war hero and treat him like someone with a terminal illness. Except for Shona, who these days pretends he doesn't exist.
And when Sherlock looked as if he was inventing something, John added, “The truth, Sherlock. Tell me who did that and why.”
“Just so I’m clear, can we have as much sex as we like?” He likes agendas, if only so he can disregard them completely.
“I’m in love with your foreskin.”
Sherlock sniffed.
John stacks his small collections of belongings in the hallway and stands beside Sherlock, about to explain that he's leaving. Sherlock, though, has got it under control. He flashes a police warrant card.
"That's not my problem. The future of the nation is at stake."
“Hello and it is nice to meet you. I am Anya,” and turning to me, “Are these the child services?”
Adrienne stared at her blankly. “Yeah. Does that make the blonde one his mother?”
This is one of the grey areas of sentimentality for Sherlock. He has many possessions that are meaningful to him, but – save a couple of random, hastily scrawled notes from John and a shopping list John wrote a few days before Sherlock leapt from the roof of St Barts – none of his sentimental possessions are related to anyone else. He doesn’t expect anyone else to keep things he gives them; he sees no reasons to keep cards or photographs, unless they pertain to John.
“Did they suspect him?”
He is little surprised when John appears in just a robe as he soaking, carrying a small bottle and a large puff of cotton wool balls.
It is a common story. Two young people who met in a more conservative time, found they had a few things in common, enjoyed a mutual attraction and then married quickly to hide a pregnancy. It sounds so quaint now. There was no lasting affection, no strength in their relationship, but no animosity either.  He loved the baby, she loved the baby, but that was eventually all that was left to them. Their separation was inevitable. It was no surprise when he started seeing a woman he met through work. It was no surprise when that other woman came to the door to declare her place in his life. It was no surprise that he packed his things a few days later and paid six months mortgage for his wife and child before he left.
The property was vacated in 1978, not long after Mr Wridge died. The business languished, and the property passed from developer to developer, while the council remained resolute that it would not be demolished. The planning committee insisted that whoever developed the awkward building would have to maintain the mostly ugly façade, and no architect had yet worked out how they might create maximum profit-making apartments within such limited parameters.
“Did Lestrade call us for a case?”
John’s thoughts are misshapen and relentless: All I want is a relationship. Sherlock all but married me himself at my wedding. He stares at me with sad eyes and does everything he can to ensure my wellbeing. It looked like love, it sounded like love. What is it, if not love? And who in the name of fucking fuck gave him straight boy pain?
“I do. I look forward to your poems. And I don’t even like poetry that much.”
Why do the victims need to remember their phone numbers? Why aren't they in their phones?
Nervous energy tangles in his belly as he realises his coming out is going to be a lot more awkward than anticipated. Sherlock can’t fathom exactly why John has reacted with such anxiety; this provokes several vague thoughts about their famous friendship disintegrating.
“I saw them this morning. Where did you get them all?” John has an endearing vision of Sherlock charming feathers from the pigeons in St James Park.
John squinted. Shooting balloons was appealing. “Do you want me to shoot balloons?”
“I’m thinking about eating the upholstery in the car so yes, that will be fine.”
“Congratulations, is, I believe, the standard offering.”
“You had good reason to be angry at her.”
you know of someone who wants a nice adult cat?"
The next day before he goes to work John slips his shirts on hangers. When he leaves for work he leans over Sherlock to rests his hand on his back and notes the flinching has stopped.
A tall, pale, soberly dressed woman with a pudding bowl haircut stood at my open door. I have no idea how she got in until I looked behind her and saw Mycroft strolling up the stairs, smirking at his phone.
"We've got Rhonda working with some of Alzheimer patients. We find that they remember pets of their own when she's with them, and of course some actually think she is a pet they knew once."
John laughs, the light hearted, cheerful little laugh of a man who is struck and delighted by something entirely ridiculous. "My relationship? There IS no relationship."
Mrs Best wanders though the memory again as she recounts the events around the disappearance. It is a structure now, not a memory of an seemingly uneventful day. Every dish on the table, every glint of light, every movement is now set in concrete and she relays it piece by piece, a static scene that culminates in the child’s disappearance, which from that point, in her absence, becomes black and cold.
But the shirts stayed packed, and John’s room still looked as if his occupancy was temporary. Sherlock wanted John to settle down, to ease back in against him, to come back home to the life they had shared.
John, who topped his final year in pathology, obstetrics and an elective unit in trauma surgery, has no idea who is speaking to him. Perhaps it's some woman from Accounts. Sally? Selina? John can't remember.
The destitute property, which was once a thriving factory that employed 140 people, has sheltered all manners of petty crime as well as the occasional substantial crime. In a bird-brained
When there was a knock at the door just after six , I thought it would have to be the delivery person but it was Detective Inspector Lestrade.
“It is.”
“No. I just wondered what you did with it. It was an absorbing thought.”
I had to think about for a few moments. I wasn’t sure what to respond because I couldn’t decide if it was correct or ludicrous.
He starts his files as Sherlock finishes his eggs.
"Why?"
“No, I haven’t. If I do, I’ll tell you.” She chewed her thin lips for a moment. “You do know he will come back to you, don’t you?”
John focuses.
days or if he only just remembered now. As if he can extract his thoughts through his skin, Sherlock releases John slowly and looks up with a glazed mouth. "I've been waiting for ten days. Now stop thinking and just relax."
John waits for Sherlock to look and when he does, swallows hard and rolls his tongue over his bottom lip.
Greasy sniffed. “I mean no disrespect ma’am, but this little girl has managed to close off her feelings from a very young age.  You’ve already admitted that you had very little contact with her in her early months –“
“There’s a cellar. It says cellar – there’s a cellar under this thing.”  John starts to circle the pagoda again, around and around, looking for an entry, any kind of vent or opening, but Sherlock stamps the ground near the concrete base and finds it first, a metal door overgrown with weeds and dirt, and jammed closed with a chain and two padlocks embedded in soil.
“A nanny? And how are you paying for her?”
Doctor Watson and I exchanged very brief meaningful glances. It was good to be back at a crime scene.
“Only that her name’s not Adrienne, and she’s actually twenty five.”
Gentle readers: The British parenting laws are complex and best left in the hands of far more astute people than me and when I say astute I mean lawyers. The Acts and regulations to which I make reference in this chapter are enacted a little differently to how they are described here. I had to weigh up whether it would be preferable to adhere to the last syllable of the law or prevent you all from slipping into a legal coma, which can of course be fatal.
Sherlock regards the doctor with cobra eyes. No one has ever appreciated his skills so openly.
So Sherlock reaches for his phone and texts Ademar Silver, who is watching bad daytime TV and happy to host an impromptu session with Sherlock.
She agrees to let Sherlock use the roof for one night in the coming weeks.
John twists a little, grabs Sherlock arm, roughly pushes up his sleeve and plucks one of the bear brown hairs there.
John laughed. He has a small, soft laugh delivered with his face tipped down that he uses when he hears strange facts that he knows to be true.
John understands and nods briefly. “So the night you came to the restaurant and saw me…”
"Who was that?" he asks, jerking his thumb in the direction of the glazier.
“You did not.” This new intelligence caused some inward relief. I wasn’t interested to hear anything else, but John Watson, I believe, was a tad obsessed.
As soon as I got home, all I wanted to do was write to the Prime Minister and say THEY LOCKED ME UP ONLY BECAUSE I AM IN LOVE WITH JOHN WATSON – DO YOU WANT ME TO PAY THE MONEY BACK?
“I found your speech.” Sherlock doesn’t have much hope in this appalling lie, but figures there’s no harm in one last try.
“Who do you think?”
“Don’t be ridiculous. Although that is, in fact, a great idea. But no. I mean, they make investments in attending the wedding. They get their hair done, they buy new clothes, they take time off work and they forget to have breakfast while they’re picking up their suit from the cleaners. They expect a wedding to provide them with entertainment and lots of food and drink. They get very aggressive if their investment isn’t returned.”
Molly unzips the bag and Mrs Best gasps. The body is stiff and darkened, but the frock, and the woollen hair ties, transport her immediately to Easter Thursday in 1975. The memories that froze into rigid stories at the mouth of a black hole now quietly break and disintegrate, and everything becomes fresh and vivid. She can hear Mariah singing their song amidst her aimless childish chatter, hears her running up the hall for the last time as she rushes out to get the mail.
“Yes. She’s very good. I have full confidence in her with Albion.”
Jeremy looks like he might cry. “Bought an ipad,” he whispers.
Sherlock nods gravely. “I loathe it. I don’t even like touching it, nasty acidic pulp that it is.”
Mycroft was there too, having completed his morning visit by pestering me to take Albion to visit his grandparents.
"Are you alright?"
"I would, very much."
“Actually it is.”
Before he calls Sherlock, before he starts to plan and worry and anticipate, John holds the poem close to his face and smiles. Oh, he says to himself. Oh, Sherlock.
“I don’t think he’s better yet. He’s sending postcards to all our friends so that I know he’s alright. One day he might send one to me and when he does I’ll know he’s better and that he’s coming home. You’ll love him as soon as you meet him. He’ll teach you to fire a gun, when you’re older obviously, and to cull boars, if  you really want to do that kind of thing.”
“Mr Albion is making fine progressions with his motor skills. Soon he will be able to grab a thing when he reaches for it.”
I touched each tiny knee cap. I very carefully ran my index finger over his little rib cage. My whole hand overlapped his tiny chest but I could feel each little rise as he took his breath. There were tiny little lungs, smaller than my nose, in there too.
Greg turns to see the woman, and John provides a hasty introduction.  “Jenny, this is Detective Inspector Lestrade from Scotland yard. Greg, this is Jenny Bannister, the woman who came to see me and Sherlock about the missing child.”
“Did you like it?”
It’s serious business, John agrees, kneeling before Sherlock and tenderly kissing the miniscule folds of his foreskin. I love your foreskin too, my love, John assures him. He watches Sherlock as he rolls his mouth over the tip, thrilled by Sherlock’s evident pleasure, the way he tips his face back to catch his breath, thrilled at the way he will then snatch another look, watching John with dreamy grey eyes.
They were at their best when they were together. We are, they realised as their love grew and progressed, each other’s best man.
John's uses the nail of his middle finger to flick a skinny syringe fitted with a mosquito thin needle.
Mycroft organised for her to be housed in 221c, the flat down stairs in my building that no one would ever rent.  The flat had been furnished over the last couple of days. If I had been focusing on anything other than my son, I might have noticed delivery men coming and going.
"They removed it, Mrs Fenelly. It was vandalised so many times, it worked out cheaper to just re-locate it near the library."
"So what are you saying? Do you want to go back to therapy and tell her that now too much happens to you?"
John doesn’t want to leave 221b tonight, and he doesn’t want this known to Sherlock. If he were less distracted, he may have examined this feeling more closely, but tonight, while everything is fraught and the voice of a long dead child echoes just inches from their space, all he knows is that wants to be here with Sherlock.
“How do you know?” Greg asks.
“I propose we start at the beginning. It’s clear we haven’t got much idea how to manage this so we should approach our congress as if we were teenagers and learn as we go.”
“True.” John tapped one of the plastic fish. “But the really surprising thing is how well you’ve managed.”
"I'm not even in shock." Sherlock tosses the blanket back in the van. "Did you catch the shooter?"
Albion slept soundly, but thinking about happily ever after actually kept me awake until the next feed.
"And she probably thinks she cured you too, but when I met you last night you were about an hour away from killing yourself."
"And if he was a user?"
Lestrade sorts all this but it forms no coherent picture. "We never find them," he realises.
So Sherlock talks to Molly and to Stamford and, with their assistance, the General Manager of the hospital. Mycroft kindly follows up this meeting with a persuasive phone call and the next day the General Manager finds herself with a cheque that enables her to fund the refurbishment of two wings of the maternity ward.
So young Sherlock stands before Eurus with his bravest face, and hands her the three writing pads.
Sherlock finds the psoriasis corpses very brilliant indeed and takes all the fingernails and toe nails he can fit in two specimen bags. John waits patiently, looking casually at the more severe lesions on the older corpse's hand while Sherlock scraps the scalp and trims large scarlet patches from both thighs.
"She's in Botswana."
“I mean,” John continues, “We should tell everyone. It should be a public announcement.”
“No. Ademar is a gay man too. He’s – helping me be a gay man. I’ve come to the party a little late.”
“I actually don’t know what to say.” Lestrade had a kind, almost beatific smile.
“What’s going on?” Lestrade asked. “You okay, Sherlock?”
“I guess sometimes it was obvious that a parent had taken them,” John says.
“The suits are very plain, straight cut from black merino wool.  We will be the belles of the ball. . And the photos will be perfect. Stop looking at me as if I’m planning your execution. It will all be FINE. Now tell me what will be in your speech.”
“She doesn’t care about her rights as Albion mother. She never even held him.”
“Ah Sherlock,” Uncle Myc sang. “Mrs Hudson! So lovely to see you. How’s your hip?”
Sherlock launches back in to the preposterous character he becomes when he's passing himself off as Lestrade.
The next day one of the prime suspects of the mysterious armed robberies is found dead in a warehouse. John and Sherlock are summoned quickly at 6am and as he dresses, John finds another poem folded neatly in his underpants:
They barely close the door upstairs when John grabs Sherlock and pulls him over close, mouth open and huffing. He takes Sherlock’s hand and rubs it over the urgent swelling in his pants. Touch me, he wants to say, touch the things you like about me, but can’t so instead relies, like all lovers, on his scent and heavy eyes.
John looks back out the window, seeing London with slightly different eyes, watching the old buildings and the ubiquitous shine of recent rain shimmer under the lights. It looks new and familiar, like it would look to someone who has come home after a long exile.
“What?”
"I'm going to blame you when I return it," he says to Rhonda, who ignores him completely.
It was his game and she won without even trying, that woman.
“I – actually, yes, there is. It’s a sort of  – but you know what? Let’s not talk about this now. And when I say that, I don’t mean that you can launch into a tirade about my failure to send you a card and keep it up until I relent. I’ll explain it later.”
"Ah, good," says John, and folds it into a long thick pad that will have to do until they can get some proper gauze. He presses it carefully along the cut, takes the stranger's hand and positions it carefully to hold it in place.
“I understand completely. “
The perplexity was waning too, because I knew what it was now. It was having a son, and a partner, and working out not how they fitted in with me, but how I, who had lived in solitude all my life and prepared from a young age to die that way, fitted in with them.
When they get to the café John stands in front the table to remove his coat; Sherlock glances quickly at the neatly zipped package of John’s jeans. It was a fleeting thing, not designed to provoke a reaction but when he looked at John’s face he saw an indefinable expression he had never seen before - a cocktail of lights and suggestions mingled with desire and some base notes of pride and love.
Now John is just staring.
This meant I could do night crying duty so John Watson, who is useless without at least six hours kip, and better if he has seven, could get proper rest every night.
"Oooooh!" Beverly makes a girlish, surprised face. John wants to smash the desk with his
"I do." His pride is evident in his smile and the straightened shoulders. "The Science of Deduction. You should look it up."
John, who has had sex with a total of fifteen people and surreptitiously palpated their spleen every time, isn't sure. He and Shona (who in his head he still calls Susan) have finally spent the night at her place. It was a miserable decision, made by both with half-hearted resignation - she had fancied him for ages and figured she'd have to have him sooner or later, while he thought he really needed to get back on the horse (figuratively) and have sex with someone.
"It is indeed. My landlady is an old friend and gave me a great rate. I helped her out a few years ago when her husband was on death row in Florida."
"Are we?" says John.
It leads to Baker Street which in turn will take him through to Regents Park. John taps the gun tucked in at the small of his back affectionately. Not far to go.
I was changing his nappy, which sometimes meant I had to all but hose him down (what was going on in that tiny little gut that he produced so much wind and excreta?) and then I’d polish him off with a baby wet wipe thingy.
The couple text briefly just before one am:
“I think we’d probably take it to the zoo,” John suggested.
“You need to get better,” he said with his serious face. His eyes look to be very dark but when you study at them carefully you can see that they are a very uniform brown, just lacking in glints, or chips of pale colours usually found in human irises .
Mike’s an interesting man, entirely dull in most ways but a very effective talker. He will make five or six pertinent points in a few brief sentences. I like this because it saves time.
Lestrade is lost. "Where did you get his number?"
Sherlock smiles and pins that to one of the trees.
“Thank you.” They stare at one another in a slightly different light.
“And is his name Albion?”
"I called Peter Turton." Sherlock presses the phone to disconnect. "I just heard his mobile message."
His preferred method of research for topics like this is women’s magazines. He skips the celebrity gossip, glosses over the fashion pages and devours every syllable of the self-help and romance pages. Each one was brimming with countless ways he could be romantic.
“Well, he’s a fantastic child. You’d be amazed at all the things he can do.”
What part of the ocean is John Watson?
“I have no idea. Actually, they all have some context while we’re – well, in flagrante delicto, don’t they?”
“Yes.”
“Mrs Best, I’m Dr Molly Hooper. I’ve performed the autopsy on your daughter to ascertain the cause of death. Before I open the bag, I have to tell you that she is quite mummified, and her condition is fragile, so you can’t touch her, I’m sorry. You’ll notice too that the bag is lined with ice, and we’ve done that to keep her in tact. Okay?”
“And did the Woodsman come back?”
"I have, yes."
“It wasn’t a bad bite,” Mycroft said as he daintily poured the tea.
It was making me confused. Now that I was being pressed for a reason, I was unable to confirm exactly why I describe myself as a high functioning sociopath. No one had ever asked me about it before. I’d never considered whether I was terrified of not being loved. I couldn’t rule it out.
“Well, “ Greg says, “Now we know why she keeps having the dream.”
“You can see for your self if you want to meet with her.”
“Yes. I’ve had a nanny start in the last few weeks, though.”
“You should still be at home,” John replies. “You’ve still got a lot of congestion.”
“So did he become a consulting detective then?”
It's a bone of contention between them. Mrs Turner has married ones and has set the bar rather high.
Sherlock’s attention waivers in and out of his environment - the others’ conversations, John’s happiness amongst their friends and the pleasing degree of crispness of his chips, but Ryan is emitting the loudest signal. Sherlock can see in the boy’s fidgeting and occasional nod of his head that he wants to tell Sherlock something but is having difficulty summoning his courage.
They find each other quite marvelous.
After a bowl of baby custard and some low grade fussing, Albion dropped off to sleep just before 8pm.
John doesn’t touch Sherlock’s back after that.
“Not at all.” I made it sound like I was lending him some tea towels.
“Signs of drug use in you, signs of neglect or physical abuse in Albion.”
“How so?”
My son wasn’t ready to address the court and turned back to me, hiding his face in my neck and making do with my hair.
clenched fists and a face marbled with rage, ready to reduce Sherlock to grain if he could only reach him. Papa nodded approvingly.
“Yes. I truly am. I am the cross you must bear. Now tell me again: What kind of poof are yer?” Sherlock mimics the gruff father perfectly.
“Of course. All my clothes are here.”
The nurse was unsympathetic. “Oh, he’ll be fine. Babies don’t know enough to be scared and they can barely feel it.”
Sherlock loved familiar things, loved to see connections between facts and situations.
"Did you play?" John wonders.
It made more sense not to deal with either. I waited until I could walk with relative ease and made my way to an especially intriguing house in Haggerston.
"So you're happy for me to move in here?"
“What kind of bath sex?” Sherlock is now loosening John’s shirt while assessing the best way to show John how broad his chest really is.
“Well, it’s an experiment in a way because I’m not certain what the outcome will be, but of course I know exactly what I’m doing.” Sherlock’s talking too fast and his eyes are bright with anticipation.
“In sixteen years’ time you’ll be too old for crack houses.”
“Then its settled,” Ludwig declares. “None of Eurus’s problems are anyone’s fault. Graham, you can leave now and don’t ever come back. And the rest of you, I now want to finalise Eurus’s first annual timetable so we can get our work underway.”
John is thinking about lying still in a quiet place somewhere. An abandoned factory would be good.
Lestrade stuck his head around the door. “Everything all right in here?”
John gave me his special giggle again.
“I don’t want to shoot balloons. I want to do something romantic.”
Eurus reached over her mother, squeezed Sherlock’s hand again, and whispered, “Cry all you want.” And for the first time since infancy, she cried too.
While they wash up, John asks some clumsy questions, trying to confirm that Sherlock has deleted Ademar Sterling. Sherlock deliberately antagonizes John by talking at cross purposes. It might have ended in a raging fight for other couples; John and Sherlock end up laughing so hard they are, for a few moments, unable to speak at all.
"These articles make it sound like police solved this case."
John, who is typing away, discretely removes a sentence describing Sherlock's lack of understanding about the solar system and instead reminds his readers to follow the link to Sherlock's website.
Sherlock doesn't immediately recognise him but, as the man approaches, remembers what prison can do to you.
“I’m going to leave here in about an hour. She’s out near Catford now, so I probably won’t get home until this afternoon.  Am I safe to leave you here alone?”
John continues to stroke in slow, deliberate sweeps, talking in that calm voice, laying a different foundation for Sherlock’s most traumatic memories one brick at a time. The strong muscles start to relax, and then soften entirely as Sherlock’s breathing grows deep.
Mrs Best looks at her with a sad smile. “Your little girl is shy,” she says.
John is carefully threading the dacron and doesn't look up. "No. Why?"
“Where’s his mother?”
Both had wondered often what it might be like to make love with each other; both had imagined huge theatrical performances of romance and ecstasy but their first time at least was a quiet, gentle affair of unhurried tenderness.
You don't need that either. Nor your trousers. In fact I might join you."
“Do you know how dignified you look in your pyjamas holding a teapot? That’s a real skill, that is.” John is looking at him with genuine admiration.
“Yes.” I was bending down over his crib and Lestrade bent over with me.
“It’s good here, isn’t it?” John says as he bends his face down and leaves a kiss Sherlock’s hair.
Not one person moved. Lestrade ignored me completely. “We’ve charged him, Sherlock. I’m going to have to take a statement from you because we’re going to lay a couple of menacing charges too, on account of him threatening the baby.  Can you come down tomorrow?”
For John Watson is a doctor.
Victor visits  every day, and together the little children spend many happy hours robbing make-believe ships, starting make-believe zoos with imaginary animals stolen from the exotic make-believe islands they pretend to visit, and making Mycroft walk the plank.
He is a Scottish fold, asleep in his armchair.
I am, however, very opposed to a one-size-fits-all practice of psychology and believe that this is precisely what is offered by a lot of clinics.  Three Years Active Service Watson suffered enormously from poor treatment like this. He had a psychosomatic limp, for God’s sake, and no one had worked out why, or even tried to assist him with it. By way of treatment they gave him a cane and had him write a blog.
My father took the gift of healing to Sherlock when he took the case, and Sherlock returned the gift by putting his faith in a story that had no room for faith.
To be fair, John Watson has withstood more in the last couple of years than most people withstand in a life time. John is drawn to the flame of danger like the proverbial moth and certainly in the years I have known him has had his handsome wings singed more than once.
Sherlock is immensely proud.
"I might hate it and leave anyway."
After I settled him in his crib, I went on line to get some more formula and nappies. I wondered how long he’d stay in newborn nappies.  I wondered too about the formula - it bothered me a little. Obviously it would have been far more beneficial for him to be breastfed but even I have my limits.
“We have to … I don’t know, nail it to the door of the Town Hall. We should say that  - we should tell people.”
On a bleak Sunday Sherlock had actually gone to do some shopping with John and noticed
“She’s not in here,” John whispers to Sherlock.
However, it’s not as easy as it sounds.
"To whom?"
Mr Stinky laughed again. “Shut the fuck up! You’re all going to die. Junior first, then Sherlock fucking Homes, and then you pair of London’s finest.”
“Yeah, me too,” says Annette, hitching up her dress a little and causing momentous movement in the rippling lycra. “I hate classical music – more of a Billie Holiday dame myself - but John reckons it’ll be fun.”
“She was fine. She had the baby in the hospital. Doctors saw him and said he was in perfect health. He was discharged. I’ve got papers.”
“Well, seven times in the last three years, but today as well. I brought it up here. Well. Molly brought it up here. I thought you’d be angry at me and we could have a picnic.”
Sherlock is cursing his stupidity in wearing just a towel, curses the familiar comfort that has developed between them. He talks haltingly and will not meet John’s eyes.
John hears small thumps and a couple of squeals, then a collection of hurried footsteps approaching from different parts of the house.
“Jesus Christ, your insensitivity is  - it’s legendary. That you would do this – that you would even think of making me…”
Sherlock watches John’s face, his eyes closing and opening, the slack mouth, the pleasure that presents as anguish and it’s too much, so lovely and too much. They wind their slippery hands around their shafts, rubbing their faces together, falling deeper in love as they find their rhythm and push into one another.
It is Sherlock’s handwriting, so there is no doubt as to who wrote it. It’s just – well, sentiment. Sherlock claimed he had none and here it is, lines and lines of it.  John is so stunned that he reads his poem again.  His shock hasn’t subsided when he finishes so he reads it a third time.
“My pleasure, John. Only the best for my family.”
Sherlock, meanwhile, is trying to weigh the disembodied head Molly found for him. It's not as easy as he thought.
I left Lestrade to talk to Ms Briggs. Mrs Hudson set about making tea, which she does with great grace during of any kind of crisis.
Lestrade went dead, as if someone had accidentally disconnected his cables.
John is looking at the map in front of 17 Beechers Road in Enfield, where Mariah lost her shoe and disappeared. Sherlock is crouched on the footpath a few steps from him, looking at the spot where Mariah’s shoe was found.
His navel is the colour of sand on the beaches in Langkawi.
He can manage the administration and has even started to become quite adept at spreadsheets but the nature and philosophy of the work galls him. Doctors don't want to be bullied by pharmaceutical companies yet here he is, a doctor employed expressly to supervise people who bully doctors into taking meetings from pharmaceutical companies.
the silk of his muscles, snagging nerve threads.
“Yes, but we won’t. Have a shower, and as soon as you come out, you’ll know everything.”
I sent John a quick text, to save me having to talk to him face-to-face about this.
“Where does Albion sleep?” Ms Powers wanted to know.
John is more confused.
“Buy pencils!”
and his steady breath on my fingers.
“Is that a kid? Have you got a kid with you?”
"Hi John, is he in?"
there are times when I wish he’d
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Doctor Watson. Please dazzle me with your sexual expertise directly.”
She shook her head, eyes on the prize the whole time. “Babies need constant attention, and they’re totally unpredictable. You’re at your best when you have your attention engaged constantly. A baby is the perfect foil for you.”
Sherlock carries on with his diagnosis.
Other flowers fold their petals and weep
Illuminate
For John Watson is loved by all our friends.
"How did you..." For John is still at the stage where Sherlock's gifts appear to be a magic trick.
“Oh, yes. You’re my first language.”
"No. A share house."
“Lovely!”
On our first morning, I woke to find empty spaces on both sides of the bed and a voluble flatulent sound coming from the living room. I wandered out to find Albion naked on the couch, with our physician leaning over him, blowing raspberries on his belly.
“Sure. Actually I could help, if you wanted.”
In the romance that is my John:
She looked up as if under great personal sacrifice. “I’m a lawyer, actually.”
Angelo fussed around the table near the window.
There is no staff available to gather boxes, so John has hired a van, and Sherlock has come to help collect the boxes because, despite his scepticism, he is curious to see how John might approach this matter. Besides, these are cold cases. He ‘s sure he will solve a couple while John looks for the ghost child.
"It always is," Billy says thoughtfully. "I, ah, heard your doctor got married and unmarried."
“She is paid to cover an on-call shift. She understood precisely the nature of her role when she took the job. You have no excuse.”
"You really are brothers?" John's surprised. They sound like brothers but the resemblance is hard to pick.
John is looking at the wound with careful fingers. Its healing is slow, and he thinks some air will assist.
Mrs Best is escorted in by one of the mortuary staff. Molly takes charge.
He curls up on his bed, jams his head under the pillow, closes his eyes and hopes that when he wakes up everything, including him, will be gone.
It's hard to tell what is making Sherlock happier - Mrs Hudson or his phone.
He's making it more pleasant for me to kiss him. He asked Renzo for the beer especially. He planned this back at the restaurant. He planned for this. I'm not a impulse purchase. He planned to go down on me. He planned to be with me and to taste nice for me.
I have a head but it is blonde.
People come and go, all of them with something to teach him. He’s interested to see how many young women are wearing corduroy this season, how many people in general are dying their hair and how many people under thirty can walk quite safely while looking at their phones.
I am wholly aware that a small angry person yelling for hours about nothing in particular is stressful for anyone, and it may have been for me if I were someone who needed eight hours sleep. I am in the happy position that I can survive very heartily on two, and have been known to go for up to three days without any at all.
The mood lightens, and the talk becomes more general. John’s doctoring is welcome, and the bandage is much more comfortable. He checks the tablets Mrs Best is using, doesn’t like it, so writes a prescription for a more specific antibiotic.
“He’s fine, Detective Inspector.” I lifted Albion slightly so he could touch Lestrade’s face. “Can we fit anyone else in here? Do any of you people understand how inappropriate it is for you all to be in here?”
It is difficult to get Eurus’s trust, but the thought of having a game that Victor and Sherlock might like – well, it’s irresistible. She changes her clothes.
Sherlock is looking at Charlotte. Solicitor, early thirties, series of hopeless boyfriends. Halfway to becoming an ardent dominatrix. Keen on books and programs about personal style. Not particularly keen on her job nor very good at it. Warlock likes his job. He will end up supporting her soon. he broke his arm when he was eight or nine, She looks a little green and her dress is uncomfortably tight. Fluid though, not fat. Has gone off her contraceptives without telling the Warlock.
My John is a palette smeared with paint, some colours distinct
But there’s always something.
And Albion, precious cold, frightened and hungry Albion, launched a category nine wail on me for not having a boring, safe job like spot welding.
“I don’t honestly know.” This was the truth. I felt something huge and unyielding but had no idea what.
Sherlock doesn’t answer.
That’s not right, John thought as he rushed out the door. Sherlock should have objected. No matter, he reasoned as he raced down to Soho, where he and Fiona would start at a pub and move on to a mediocre Chinese restaurant. He’s bound to bombard me with texts all night. He’ll probably call me within the hour and insist I come home to find his phone charger.
"Not really my area," Sherlock says sadly. "Married to my work and all that."
"Oh, as opposed to all the things the papers report correctly? It's not wrong, John, it's spin."
Sherlock is relieved when John announces, without looking at him, that he will go to his flat and collect some clothes for him and Rosie so they can stay a few days.
Yes, I do. Can I return him to you?
44 essingdon lane putney can you come
“Yes, the Camden Garrotter. And yes, he did send me to that person who cures straight boy pain. Why did you buy flowers?”
John chuckles with relief. My industrious little chicken, he thinks fondly.
She had been very sweet . You stay home and get better, she had said kindly. And don't worry about meeting me at the hospital, I'll come and pick you up tomorrow. No, it's fine, it's the least I can do. Everyone at Nan's hospital is so excited about the new cat. You take care.
“I want to kill him.”
John shakes his head. “No, not at all.” He looks down at the poem again and small parts of Sherlock’s sentiment shine at him. “You’re fluent in me?”
As it turns out, that becomes an easy task, because Mycroft – as he is wont to do when he is having an manageable day – has texted that he’s collected Rosie from nursery school. John and Sherlock come back to 221b to find them both at the little table, Mrs Hudson having joined them on one of the tiny chairs, reading Mother Goose in turns.
Sherlock took a breath and manufactured another smile, this time a delighted one.

John flips the envelope back and forth, looking at the crest, assessing the weight. “It’s addressed to you.”
I ended up buying one from Mothercraft. It even came with a garland of plastic ducks that I put aside for the time when I teach Albion to use a scalpel properly.
"Donovan, I have no idea, and frankly I don't care. I don't know why it's of any importance to any of you. Now go find volume one of the brief and bring it back here now."
They've been chatting quite politely now, friendly, not uncomfortable but perhaps a touch reserved.
Because if we don't, we can't remember them.
The ladies explained that they had been alerted by the hospital of my previous drug use and, as such, were here to see that Albion was being cared for in an environment where he could thrive. They carried documents that were signed by people who had delegated powers that enabled them, they told me plainly, to remove Albion if they thought he was in danger.
Sherlock looks over to John, who is waiting a few feet away, smiling benignly. "I have one, Mycroft. Now why don't you go install a puppet government in some despotic, under-resourced country and leave me alone."
Adrienne shook her head. “I’m stupid. I can’t do anything. I was stupid at school and I was rubbish at Superdrug. And then I had a baby and he was so happy. Look at them.” She jerked her head at John at me. “I saw this thing in Glamour about this girl who had a baby for her cousin, and I thought, I may as well see if I can do it for other people, and then I saw this thing on Craigslist so I went to New York. And, well, I just want to have babies for people who can’t. I may as well. And it’s good, you know? I don’t want a baby but the New York people sent me to one of them gynothingies and he said I was fertile and real healthy and could have a dozen babies. So I’m going to.” She looked around the room, as if there was no one there. “It’s good, you know? I’ve never done anything important.”
“Dummies are lifesavers,” baby confident Watson said. “And babies love them.”
So on this Thursday, while Sherlock is sorting out the Broken Beer Bottle killer, John, who he has never met but would have if only he walked through the park and not around it, is going to his boring job for the last time.
Initially he thought that romance wasn’t important to John, but now Sherlock was starting to suspect that it was, and that John had sacrificed romance for Sherlock’s companionship.
"I like cats." Which, strictly, was true,. He didn't wish them any harm and they didn't make him sneeze.
Sherlock was right - the letter is boring. John throws it and the ripped envelope in the bin, then tries several times to engage Sherlock in a discussion about his university days. He gets monosyllabic answers so instead takes to the Internet to learn about Sherlock’s alma mater.
“Yes but everyone needs their own room. It is important for a cohesive society.”
It is beautiful.
“Approve?”
To be honest, I’m not entirely certain what kind of night I thought I deserved with John Watson, but I do know it involved him actually being there, not wearing a shirt, and telling me I’m amazing.
“What’s wrong with your back?” John asked once or twice, although he didn’t think the back was sore. He thought that Sherlock disliked the contact and was trying to set physical distance between them.
I felt like we are had finally arrived at the right place, and finished the journey we started this very table all those years ago.
At the moment he's half-leaning towards going back to whatever horrible dark spot he can find for himself but it seems considerably less appealing now. Tonight has been great, he says to himself over and over. I learnt a lot and I had to think really carefully about everything. And then there was the stitching. God help me, I've missed it.
“Garbage. Tell me why you won’t come on cases with me. We’ve had three terrific ones, the mummified couple were extraordinary, and it would have been great to have you at the autopsy at Bart’s” – and then Sherlock saw it. Bart’s.  At the mention of Bart’s John’s eyes and mouth showed microscopic twitches that no other person would have noticed.
Sherlock lifts his eyes from the lenses. “Why else would they ask me for money?”
“I want to know everything you can tell me about the day Mariah disappeared. Everything, from the time you woke up, until you went to sleep that night.”
"Yes."
“That’s my half,” Sherlock explained.
“Albion. Obviously. Come on, get down here and blow a raspberry.”
“I think those cats were needlessly judgmental.”
"No idea," Sherlock answers from the kitchen. "Breakfast is going to be a problem."
“Not strange, no. I might worry that it mightn’t be enough for you and you’ll run off with someone who doesn’t try to index your socks, but that’s my problem, not yours.”
“And Inspector Lestrade! If it isn’t my lucky day. Don’t know who you are, sweetheart,” he leered at Sally, “But I bet you’re from Scotland Yard too. What a bonus.”
“Dunno,” she said. “Alright, I suppose. Breakfast sucked.”
It starts with a simple game – young Sherlock, in brand new wellies, running along the shore with his friend Victor, known, at least to Sherlock, as Redbeard. They’re playing pirates. Little sister Eurus watches from the sideline, trying to keep up, desperate to have an equal role in the game. She can be a pirate, she keeps telling them, but the two little boys are totally wrapped in each other and Eurus doesn’t register in this important game.
John leans in and lowers his voice, carefully placing his fingers on Sherlock’s chest and seeking out the buttons, opening each one slowly as he whispers.  “And I wash your back and you’re complaining, but gradually you calm down, and I slip the wash cloth around to your chest, and then stroke your neck, and you flex up so I can see how broad your chest is, and I can feel your biceps, then you turn around all dripping and soft and kiss me.”
“You know what? Just forget it. No, I mean it Sherlock, just shut up and forget it. I’m going to bed. I don’t want to talk about it again.”
Mrs Hudson is waiting for them when they get home. She stands at her door with a very large cooler box. It appeared to John to be the type used by hospitals to transport donated organs.
That night, Jenny Bannister goes to bed exhausted and as she falls asleep she is aware, foggy and thick, that there is no voice singing. She wakes with a start some time later, sits upright as she realises it’s light and when she looks at her clock, she sees it is 6.13 am.
I took them into my room, showed them his crib, his drawers of clothes, his small sock index (he only has six pairs, which isn’t really enough for a proper index), his nappies, his bed clothes and his Peter Rabbit bunny rug. Then I showed them the bathroom, his change table and the small inflatable bath I use to bath him on the change table. They asked if I ever left him in the bath alone or if I left him to cry.
He takes a sharp breath. Ademar didn’t prepare him for this at all, it seems. “I don’t think I’m going to last very long.”
He stands straight, holding the card in one hand and three pairs of trousers in the other, then tosses the clothes on to Sherlock’s bed and storms down the stairs, slamming the door behind him.
"It was extremely technical. An error in law, if you please. Basically she told them that the prosecution hadn't proved that the same person used the three cords in the murders and the judges had to agree. That meant there was reasonable doubt that I had actually done any of them and that meant the convictions couldn't be upheld. So they overturned the convictions and ordered a retrial. And they had to release me!"
I had entered what I now refer to as the dead zone of my life. I had been hospitalised for months so coming home was a little like holidays from boarding school: you can’t believe your sudden freedom yet you can’t quite get out of the routine you’d been instructed to follow all term.
“She was cold,” she says eventually. “A really nasty cold bitch, excuse my language. Horrible. She hated me, and she hated Mariah, but only because Robert felt some responsibility to us.”
And a pretty pet it is too. John is not much for ornithology but he estimates that the hot parrot is an African love bird. He'd be right.
"Darling, Mycroft said you had a friend! We came immediately to see if he was telling the truth."
“No, she’s an aeronautical engineer.”
And the Detective Inspector lies down on the floor next to Sherlock. They both peer in at the phone.
"Give me the tweezers."
They wait fifteen minutes or more for the man from the Council to arrive. In that time they discuss, suggest and argue as to how Julia may have got the child in the site and, if she did, where she may have concealed her.
Sherlock and John are most interested in the plans from 1969.

“Do you want to tell me about it?”
The driver reads it carefully. “Hop in.”
Many of the most ardent and valiantly fought arguments I have had with health professionals and layman alike have been about psychology. I need to point out now that I am a huge advocate of psychology and admire many psychologists (Melanie Klein comes to mind because I have been reading a lot of her work recently, but there are many others who have also made important contributions to our understanding of our minds and behaviour).
“No. It was as if I had tuned into a radio station – you know how it can be a little fuzzy until you get the right station? – and then I heard her singing.”
“Sherlock,” John murmurs, “Have you got any lube?”
She turned to Adrienne.
Albion began to cry, and not without reason. No one wants to hear that their parent is just one species on the evolutionary chart from eating them.
Yet here he is, solidified at his table and surrounded by twenty eight different feathers organized in a row according to their height, trying to understand that maybe it wasn’t always him. Worse, much worse, maybe it never was.
At the time I thought it might have been all the unwanted love I had for John Watson, although obviously that was wrong. Still, at that moment, it seemed an efficient form of recycling, to redirect all that unused love to my son.
Everyone rolled their eyes at me (except Albion, who just gurgled when I kissed his fat little cheek) and set about their respective tasks.
“He was exasperated and went around with his usual ‘who farted’ face, but didn’t say anything until the Prince overdosed and ended up in St Bart’s having his heart and respiratory system kick started with electricity. Which was something.”
“Yes. He’s ice cold and not moving and all brain activity seems to have ceased. That’s a fair assessment.”
The whole room is quiet. Spoonfuls of cake stall mid-air between paper plates and open mouths. Every set of his colleagues' eyes are on him and his skin burns, his hand stills and his leg is for a few seconds entirely pain free.
“You wrote me a poem,” John says.
Sherlock sat between Mycroft and Eurus, both of whom held his shaky hands as he recounted clearly, and with perfect chronology, what happened.
I had no idea what that was and gave Mycroft a look to convey that.
“We could talk now.”
Rigid in the revelation of John’s apparent heterosexuality, Sherlock feels drained, drained in the same way he has seen an embalmer empty a corpse of blood before filling the frail veins with formaldehyde. He wanders down to his own room, takes off all his clothes, turns off all the lights and slips under the duvet so he can lay in the dark and calculate where he had deduced wrongly and, more importantly, what he should do now.
Mycroft, true to his word, had our application listed the next day. Both John and I wore a suit; Albion was wearing his best cashmere jumper, a little pair of navy blue corduroy pants and smart teal socks. John even managed to comb his hair back.
John wonders exactly what he's doing.
“He’s not delicious. French pastries are delicious, so are hot chips with aioli. John is far too masculine to be delicious. He’s handsome.”
Rudy takes twelve year old Mycroft, precocious and confident and more than aware of his parents’ failings, into his confidence, and explains his fears. Mycroft and Rudy decide that Mycroft will watch his siblings carefully and remind Eurus (if necessary) that her pencils will be confiscated by the authorities if she kills anyone. Mycroft is gentle and applies the law with great delicacy, while inside the ancient family home, Rudy argues about Eurus with the Holmes parents.
Mycroft continued to be conciliatory. “I regret that I ever thought that, let alone said it to you.”
“Maybe you’ve got a heart after all?” John tipped his lovely face to one side, slightly teasing, but with kindness.
"To a fabulous pizza place I know not far from here. You know, you can always tell a great Italian restaurant by the way they serve their parmesan cheese and black pepper."
“Hello and it is nice to meet you,” said Anya without a hint of a smile. “I am the new nanny.”
“Vivaldi.”
It actually doesn’t matter. I just love him, and it turns out I have for years,  but Three (soon to be six) Continents Watson has no capacity to deal with my love.
Caroline talks about celebrities and television programs all the way to the restaurant. John has no idea who’s she’s talking about or why she is so obsessed with the tedious, possibly false, details of their life. He is thinking only of Sherlock, and his complete lack of interest in John’s love life.
He hangs his arms over his eyes and feels them grow damp. He's never felt so alone, a cure for this emptiness has never seemed so unlikely.
“Soft drink bottle? You disarmed this violent man with a soft drink bottle?”
"Can we sit down maybe?"
It was all hideous, and certainly one of the most difficult tasks I had ever undertaken, including faking suicide with a seemingly fatal leap from a ten story building. I wanted to scream at them LOOK AROUND YOU, do you really think this baby is neglected or abused, but I heeded Lestrade’s advice and I did as I was told. Albion and I led the way to the kitchen, where they could see his bottles, the steriliser, the spreadsheet I had devised for when Albion starts solid foods and the small eating utensils I’d bought in preparation for that very interesting time.
My John’s foreskin
John raises his eye brows lightly, courteous, wholly untrusting. "Okay."
She doesn’t look up. “What do you want?”
Lestrade waits expectantly before he remembers who he's dealing with, and realises the answer will be delivered with series of clues obvious to no one but Sherlock, followed with an
Mrs Hudson has lived such an extraordinary life that she never anticipates an obvious answer.
There's no further explanation. John is reluctant to take it any further. In any case, they're not far from former home.
"Yes, we had a bit of a mishap there. Can I get you get a cup of tea or coffee while you wait?"
John shrugs one shoulder. “I just like saying mitral stenosis. And I wanted you to look at me.”
"Order whatever you want, it's on the house for you and your date." He turns and smiles at John who almost corrects him but changes his mind. What the hell.
Ms Powers waved a blue printed sheet at John. “I need this form ticked off.” He took it from her half-heartedly, read it briefly and then looked at me. “I’m going to have to give him a quick examination, Sherlock. Is that alright?”
He sits for a long time, his eyes moving slowly from the desk drawer, to the bird, the gathering night outside, back to the drawer. Not here, not now.
Sherlock and Lestrade speak at the same time. "Punishment number?"
The judge wore a robe but no wig, which I found disappointing.
Her boys adore her. Every few weeks they turn up to the family home in Mayfair squabbling for her attention, all but elbowing each other out of the way to have her to themselves for a few precious moments.
Sadly,  I never understood that I was in love with him until his wedding, and sadder still that I realised that he reciprocated those feelings the night before his wife shot me a second time.
John, who has been watching carefully for any kind of disconcordance from Sherlock, is suddenly aware he has to spend the entire evening with this formidable woman. “Do you want to come?” he finds himself asking, sounding a little desperate.
These things would plague me for weeks.
John sucks him until he feels both hands clutch in warning. He calls halt as Sherlock grimaces, hands squeezing John as he concentrates on damming the pleasure.
“Brilliant! Genius baby!” I leaned down and kissed the top of his fluffy head, which amused him greatly.
Sherlock sighs dramatically. “No. Kiton is a very noble menswear manufacturer. They make extremely nice suits.”
“I have friends in lots of  departments and different government agencies. I’d asked one to let me know if she heard anything concerning you.”
“Sorry? Did we wake you?”
Sherlock was uncommunicative for the entire trip, seemingly confirming small things on his phone while John watched the ancient streets of London speed by. He was not remotely interested in the armed robbery. All he could think of were Sherlock’s feet. Who painted his toenails? And why?
"Me too," lies Sherlock, who almost never feels like eating after he's solved an important crime. "I know an excellent Italian place near here." He turns to Mycroft. "John and I are having dinner. I bid you good night, Mycroft." But he doesn't leave, instead leans in to his big brother and talks in a hush, indicating the pretty texting woman with a dip of his head. "What are they talking about?"
I shrugged.  I wasn’t surprised. John would be more inclined to send a postcard to Lestrade from somewhere like Singapore, and he wouldn’t be there yet.
He called to me from the kitchen while he clattered mugs and plates. “Is Mycroft back today?”
“Lovely. What a lucky boy. Now can you tell me, what kinds of things do you do with Albion? Mr Holmes?”
While John surveys the few boxes in the empty room that make up his all his worldly possessions, Sherlock is in the shower, standing on one leg with water beating down on his shoulders as he tries once again to fit all his toes in the tap. It bothers him enormously that not all of them fit properly. He makes a post it note about a tap with a bigger spout and whacks it on a low wall in the mind palace.
“No need to cry,” Mycroft said, as he settled down next to his brother.
I shrugged. “No damage.”
John can't quite fit Sherlock in his mind yet. He's like no person or concept he's met, an uncharted island with treacherous rocks, smoking volcanoes and thousands of undiscovered species of poisonous insects. It would be perilous to visit, but be so interesting while you were there.
I am sorry to say the Detective Inspector’s first response was not a refined one.
a forest filled with men but
Some people smiled at us, others were suspicious.
Sherlock waits until they are in the cab home before he looks at John. His eyes are hard and hurt. “What is your problem?”
John’s body grew tense again. “I hate the evil Prince.”
All gifts, the ones we remember most dearly and with the most pleasure, are like that.
Nothing could have prepared me for the fear children cause you. Not just the large, typical fears of sickness and tragedy, but the small unavoidable fears that they’ll have friends, that they’ll get chosen for games at parties, that their tiny, tender feelings won’t be wounded. Two of the greatest reliefs I’ve known is the realisation that my boy isn’t bothered by an onslaught of continual harsh thought like I was, and that already he has little friends at school and in the park. He can make friends. I hope he won’t ever know loneliness like I did.
“Well, that would certainly cause this kind of a wound,” Molly answers. “ Or was pushed and hit her head on a wall. Anyway, it was merciful. She’s probably frozen to death, and it’s my guess she didn’t wake up after she hit her head.”
John dropped off first. I thought I could lie all night and bask in the loveliness of the sounds of the tiny puffs from Albion, and the shallow soft snores from John, but next thing I knew it was five am and Albion was waking us both, reminding us that Mycroft would be here in three hours.
"You're too slender, Mrs Hudson. If you slip in under we'll never get you out."
"It's amazing. Absolutely .... amazing."
John shook his head. “I should have clarified – this client has a ghost.”  He expected a look of disdain but Greg’s face didn’t change.
The tip of my tongue.
John reads the certificate carefully. Sherlock is always amused how easily John can read the most careless scrawl.
Mycroft divests himself immediately to sit with Rosie, who is now standing up in her chair to greet him. He has brought her a special pencil to take to nursery, and will even offer to drive her in there in the black car, which is always a treat.
“Ah, Doctor Watson,” my brother sang as he waltzed through the door. “How lovely it is to see that we have at least one grown up at 221b.”
Sherlock is conducting an fascinating conversation with Ida.
Having a nanny turned out to have many benefits, most of them for me: I got to have a shower every day and had time to enjoy the quotidian details -  make a cup of tea, take telephone calls, work out some things I could do with the bottle steriliser when Albion didn’t need it any more.
John is cupping his face and whispering.
John is horrified. "No! No, I'd never kill an animal. No, they didn't want her. The people I live with. She was as depressed as I was. I didn't want to be unhappy after I was, you know, gone, so..." -his face takes on a sheepish scowl- "I gave her to an old persons' home as a therapy pet."
She sobs uncontrollably and John gently eases her into the chair. That is the sole interaction they have – no one tries to console her, or tries to escort her away. They let her stay for nearly fifteen minutes, and it is again John who takes her arm and leads her away as Molly zips the bag shut.
