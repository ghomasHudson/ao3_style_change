is going on here?" Sherlock whispered in a trembling voice, leaning up with his hands against the wardrobe. In such a stance it was difficult to determine whether he was holding himself up against the doors, or rather forcing them shut with all of his body weight, so as to keep something from escaping. It was as if he expected that robe to slip out through the cracks, and force itself onto his skin.
"Good. Well, like I was saying, I feel as though that house catered more to, well to people like me. I told you that I had a dream this afternoon, something that felt so real? Almost like it had happened before?" Sherlock pointed out. John nodded, although he wasn't entirely sure he had heard everything Sherlock just said. He was still rather caught up on his previous confession, all the while Sherlock didn't seem to think that it was a big deal. Why did John have to lie, just to make himself look a little bit more observant? If he had admitted to not knowing a thing about Sherlock's love life then he might've had more time to process, and would be following Sherlock's words instead of just staring at his lips while they moved and formed syllables. Those lips that may have been kissed by men, those lips that wouldn't all together protest if John just leaned over now, and...
"You're coming! Come on, coward." John insisted, watching with a look of disappointment as Sherlock finally began down to the first step. His only flashlight was on his phone, and there was a very obvious look of terror upon his pretty face.
"Coins." John said instinctively, throwing the bag onto the desk and listening to the clatter the metal made against the wood. Sherlock nodded, looking a bit nervous as he reached for the bag and investigated the contents.
"You own an old house then?" Sherlock presumed, his voice now taking a turn from excited to curious. He sounded interested in John's life, for some reason, as if John's manic episode was thought provoking for him.
"You were in love once?" I clarified again, setting the papers down upon his chair and approaching the fireplace to stand at his side. It was very uncomfortable to have a conversation with the back of his bent head, especially when I felt I would be missing the most influential and life changing emotions of our time together. Surely this was monumental?
John woke with something of a jump, nearly falling out of his chair as he was flung into the real world so abruptly. He looked about to see if anything had roused him, yet he saw that the house was just as quiet as he had left it. Sherlock was asleep on the couch, now curled in a tight little ball with his hands pulling his knees close to his chest. Nothing stirred, and so John had to wonder why he had woken with such a start. Perhaps it was just because his dream was concluded; perhaps it was because that was the end of the narrative and therefore the end of his use of sleep. Oh just when he thought he had solved one mystery, here came another one to baffle him. The idea that their past lives were so starkly different than their lives before, in which Sherlock was some sort of prostitute, living here in the house at the expense of a certain Mr. Trevor. Yet who was Mr. Trevor, if he even lived here at all? Was there another person to add into their adventures, someone who had been dragged back into existence on the command of the house, and plunged into the twenty first century with the rest of them? No, John didn't want to think of it like that. He didn't want to consider that dream as reality, for what on earth did it say about Sherlock, and about John as well? There was hardly any distinction of either them to their current self, especially not Sherlock. That sweet, innocent boy who now curled over the couch, well the idea that he might have served some unholy purpose all those years ago. To think that he might've sold his body to another man, just for a place to stay? Surely the dream was far from true; surely it was just John's imagination acting up again. No, just because Sherlock was feminine in nature doesn't mean that he's gay...certainly their appearances and names have passed over throughout the years, yet not every part of their soul has remained constant. No, surely not. John couldn't allow himself to believe such things as his mind wanted to display them. Maybe that was because he wanted to think a little bit better of Sherlock, and his morality. Or maybe John was just concerned with the dream...and the way the ending had made him feel. Perhaps he didn't like the idea of his dream self getting so worked up over a simple offer, and so tempted with how that offer might correspond to real life. And this dream, well did it have any similarities to the dream he had before all of this started? The one which had first shown Sherlock's face, in which a man had whispered sharply in his ear that it was quite alright to go into the room, and to observe Sherlock in such a state? These dreams, that photograph...John didn't like the way they were painting the occupants of this house. He certainly didn't like the messages they were trying to portray...the messages that might mean they were all living some sort of homosexual way of life. John sighed, turning over in his chair and noticing now that his headache had passed. It was as if such little sleep within this house had cured him of whatever aliments being away from it had inflicted. John felt well rested for the first time in what felt like ages. And that alone made him considerably reluctant to check his watch.
"No I'm fine. I'm fine here all the same." Sherlock assured with a large yawn. John sighed, knowing of course that Sherlock probably hadn't slept in days. Miraculously John had been able to get a little bit of sleep, for while the screaming in his head had been loud, it had been monotonous enough to be lost into the back of his mind. It was much like the screaming baby, eventually the same noise gets ignored, and you find yourself able to sleep in any situation.
John woke to the darkness, the darkness which was interrupted only by the small, smoldering logs in the fire. The red embers were all that remained, smoldering smokeless inside of the hearth. John sighed heavily, shivering powerfully and deciding that he ought to put some more logs onto the fire. The house was still and silent, for its ghosts had to sleep as well, and yet John was much too afraid to check his watch. He didn't like any confirmation that it was too late in the night; he didn't like the ominous feelings of loneliness that came along with such early morning hours. John was just about to get up when he noticed an arm dangling next to him, a pale arm that could only belong to one man, swinging off of the couch as he slept. John smiled quietly; appreciating now the untarnished skin that glowed so innocently by the last red light of the glowing embers. The effortlessly beautiful skin, gleaming and tempting, hanging so close to his face that it would only be too easy to lean and brush his cheek against the dangling fingertips. John sighed heavily, looking up now to Sherlock's face where it was smashed against the cushion, his eyes closed and his lips parted. Yet he still looked dashing, perhaps one of the most beautiful creatures on the whole of the planet, even when he was still asleep in such a state. Well surely the only thing more beautiful than Sherlock when he was asleep was when Sherlock when he was awake. All the same, the asleep Sherlock was so much easier to appreciate, and to investigate. Sherlock would never tolerate so much staring, a boy that was so self-conscious about his own beauty, a boy who would not allow himself to anyone before he was sure that person was someone special. Well what made John so insignificant? Who was Sherlock waiting for, if not for his true soulmate? John felt as though he had some rights to Sherlock, even if the boy would not accept it. He knew that they had a complicated and entangled history; he knew that in some point in time there was a version of Sherlock Holmes that saw John as an opportunity, not merely an inconvenience. He knew that there was a moment when Sherlock's eyes sparkled just as eagerly, he knew there was a moment when that boy would follow him to the ends of the earth, perhaps even all the way up to his bedroom. And yet this world was different, this world was much more stubborn than the rest. This world only permitted John to stare at Sherlock when he was asleep, and appreciate him only by the skin that was exposed from his dangling arm. There was no situation in this world in which John could be Sherlock's, at least not right now while he was married and Sherlock was so pure. Especially not when there was the promise of Victor Trevor, looming just over the horizon. No, Sherlock would not look twice in John's direction when he knew there was something much more promising ahead. John really was nothing in that boy's eyes, nothing when compared to the man he believed to be his one and only soulmate. Oh if only Sherlock could realize the world was more complicated than that. If only he knew that their pasts were intertwined together, not separately, and not singularly? They were trapped in a web, not merely an entanglement, and to deny the strings which were wrapped so tightly would be foolish of them both. Yet what could John do, what could he only do? He couldn't lean forward to kiss that hand which was dangling; he couldn't brush the curls behind Sherlock's ear and whisper softly into his ear. He couldn't climb up onto that couch and hold Sherlock's body close to his own, not in this lifetime at least. John's only option, therefore, was to rise to his feet and retrieve logs. To walk throughout the darkness in this lonely hour, when all of the world slept except those who were hopelessly in love.
"Well, there's a difference between narcissism and stubbornness." John corrected, sipping now at his cola and wincing as all the little carbonated bubbles popped around his nose. Sherlock sighed, going back to his elbows and staring once more at the candles.
"What have we here?" Greg asked, pawing at the paper before John winced, moving to pull it away before Greg faltered and lifted his hands in surrender.
as if there wasstill such a thing! Had Sherlock not abandoned him, and left him on his own for such a foolish string of words, spat out in a fit of uncontrollable influence? And were they officially separated, had that seemingly invincible, immortal cord really been snapped? John lay back down on the couch, his head fogging even though he was not in the least bit tired. He felt as though this was better pushed aside, it was a thought that might be better pondered in the daylight. John still felt as though he was under the influence of something, whether it be the wine, or the delirium, or the sadness. Yet something was making it difficult to concentrate. Something was making it difficult to think of anything other than the obvious- and those eyes wouldn't leave his vision even after he had closed his own.
"Ya, I got it in the mail this morning." John agreed. Greg nodded in approval, setting the paper back down on the desk and rearranging himself once more in his chair.
"Well that's why we're here. We've been digging around in its history, but we haven't gotten far. Figured you might have something filed away for it?" John presumed.
"I can move over, if you really want to sit." Sherlock offered, squishing himself up against the armrest of the coach and offering John a whole separate cushion.
"Oh, well he noticed that I liked it, you know? And we couldn't have that. Not even for the honor of getting all the way to the top. No, he'd sacrifice any high honor just to ensure that I was miserable." John groaned, clenching his fists against the carpet and staring into the now roaring fire. He felt a burst of anger bubble up inside of his chest, an anger that he had not felt for years, yet one which was so startlingly familiar all the same.
Ignoring this, he said, “You handed over a tissue to the mother, she took it with her right hand. The father’s coffee - titled to his right to take with his right hand. The dead body had calluses on her right fingers from her guitar, and her handwriting is also right-handed because the page didn’t smudge when writing on ink. On her lockscreen, she was taking a picture with her right hand.”
“She’s already got files?” John asked, leaning against the counter next to Sherlock. He noticed her phone was unlocked. “Someone’s up to date on paperwork. How did you know her password?”
No, jumping too far there. The feeling he was experiencing wasn’t quite anger. He was not angry at Sherlock, it wasn’t as festered as that. He recollected his emotions when he first encountered Sherlock after he returned from his “trip”. After he rose from the dead.
with each day passing, and it was an internal debate within Mycroft whether this was a positive thing or not. He always believed that sentiment did not suit the Holmes trio, but it was starting to occur to Mycroft that maybe it did suit Sherlock after all. Clearly, John meant a lot to Sherlock. Maybe too much, in fact.
Honestly, he wonders why they don’t just scrap the Parliament and let one person make the choices others can’t make. Why negotiate when you can just decide?
“John Watson, right?” The girl said. Her voice wasn’t London, “Listen - we appreciate your concern, but you and your boyfriend are toeing a line into a world that you shouldn’t be messing with.”
A three-story building with small to medium sized rooms, with the curtains firmly drawn and the lights off. That was the state of the McKenzie house as Sherlock and John were led into the sitting room by the mother’s brother. The McKenzie parents themselves were huddled close on the sofa, arms linked around each other and gripping their hands tightly. The mother looked like she’d been weeping for hours on end, and still the tracks of her tears sustained on her pink face. An empty coffee mug in front of the father laid abandoned, lukewarm and half-empty.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked, stepping over to reach John, who was leaning against the wall trying to regain his breath.
The warmth of the sun had settled into twilight by the time the pair returned to 221b Baker Street. Sherlock had ditched John in the cab, leaving the army doctor to pay the fare (
Once the final attacker had been left semi-conscious on the ground, Sherlock straightened himself and adjusted his scarf. Well, at least there was some excitement to his night. Maybe he should ask John to look for fights more often.
to everyone - swatting away opinions that did not match his own, ignoring ideas that were not a part of his ideal code and motto. Perhaps it was the need for attention - it was always Sherlock this, Sherlock that, we all love Sherlock Holmes, thanks for the help Sherlock Holmes, you’re our hero Sherlock Holmes, your website is amazing Sherlock Holmes…
I managed to squeeze in this chapter before I go on holiday. I have been very overworked from college, hence the gap of time between chapters. I don't even have the next chapter written yet... but it'll come.
“Well, they’ve done their best to mimic it,” John said, “But it’s definitely a bit different. Doesn’t curl her y’s the same way… and writes her ampersands differently, too.”
John squinted to gaze a the picture. From a mere glance at the photo and what he could recall of the body, they were identical. But of course it had to be tiny details that were off…
am,” John retorted, the tone of his voice low but starting to slowly increase in volume, “I’m not your follower - I’m not some background character - I’m
“Practically.” But Sherlock ignored John’s comment, and has already swiped onto the photos. He practically thrust the phone to John. “Here, take a look. Are there any differences you notice compared to her and the body?”
But the tables turned, and the grunting from the men kicking him turned into yells. Someone else had arrived, apparently, and John managed to drag himself away from the scuffle to look up. Of course it was Sherlock - he knew where he was; after all, and Sherlock had not disconnected from the line.
Mycroft paused, awaiting an aggravated response for daring to mention his end with such an unfriendly tone; he was not disappointed, as the reply came after a few seconds of silence. “If you’re going to bring up the fact that I shouldn’t
Deciding not to hide the truth no longer, Mycroft gave a sigh and leaned back in his chair, though maintaining his high and professional stature. Even in the absence of the audience, he did his best to scare and intimidate.
“The body was blue, too - but they were heterochromatic. The eyes on the body had a silver of green, just on the right. Barely noticeable at a glance. The girl here has pure blue eyes - in fact, maybe a little
“I don’t know - what happened,” John breathed, “Shit, Sherlock - the girl was here. The dead girl. But you’re right - she must be a replacement, she was smoking, and,” he paused, drawing out a breath of air.
“Exactly.” The detective gave a twitch of a smile, surprisingly rather genuinely, and John felt rather proud of himself. “Fingernails were clear, no yellow - same with the teeth, well-brushed, not a spot of brown or yellow. Probably get lungs looked at, too, and obviously ask her parents.”
took it - sold it on, made a profit. So my conclusion from the minimal evidence left on the scene: the person from last night is not the same body we've found.”
“Not at all,” Sherlock drawled, his voice almost devoid of feeling, “Why, I think it'll be solved before dawn.”
“I would rather know sooner than immediately,” Mycroft replied, his tone starting to shift rather cool, “And I meant to have a word with you about Doctor Watson.”
“You are a… valuable asset to me,” Sherlock continued, carefully picking each word with precision and care, “In this line of work, I would have been dead or captured or worse many times if you had not been by my side. I sincerely regret what you’ve been through since I left for two years - it is my fault. But I can’t regret it, John, because I did it for you.
But for now, at least, things seem to be mostly back to normal between them, if there ever even was such a thing as
Then, suddenly, a sound. A slight creak. Unmistakably a floorboard. Right here, in his room, with him, right now. The relief seems to explode in Sherlock’s chest. If someone has come up here then the door isn’t locked and he isn’t up here all alone and the world hasn’t shut him out and he’s just been imagining things and
it. He’s always embraced being different. It never really felt like he had much of a choice to begin with, but he embraced it nevertheless. He took pride it in, encouraged it, nurtured it, even boasted of it. And he’s always known that John didn’t choose the same. John chose to pretend to be normal. John chose to find ways to be with others by locating places where the different became the normal (the battlefield, the surgery) or, failing that, by squeezing himself into the box ascribed to him until he fit the mould.
“I can’t… I can’t, Jim, I…” Sherlock looks at him hopelessly. He wills his eyes to convey his regret, shame and guilt instead of betraying the reasons for his decision.
do this to achieve… he once said it himself, didn’t he? Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator.
“I know I did and you’re doing a great job. Better than I expected, really. I’m just saying, you don’t have to wait around. If you want to go on a case, just go on a case. I’m sure we’ll manage,” John tries to explain, immediately regretting that last bit as he sees Sherlock entering full pout mode. John has witnessed that numerous times before, when he makes a joke on Sherlock’s behalf at an inopportune moment or a stranger comments on Sherlock’s lack of social skills. It looks downright adorable, a grown man pouting like a five year old, and John used to be more amused than anything else. It’s taken him a long time to realise that Sherlock is actually hurt in these situations and only pouts to hide behind a pissed-off expression. If only Sherlock didn’t have such a godawful problem admitting that he does actually have feelings like a normal human being, maybe John needn’t have been friends with him for years before grasping what ought to be a quite central part of any friendship.
But it’s also a stark reminder. John is not the only one with scars. Sherlock has scars too, scars which John has only seen one time. That had been in the harsh, unforgiving lights of the bathroom where they look even uglier than they do under normal circumstances, but it still doesn’t erase the sudden fear that John will look at them and find them unsightly. John’s scar might make him look wild and untamed, but Sherlock’s own scars just make him look like a failure. Someone who wasn’t smart enough, someone who wasn’t fast enough and who had to pay the price for his mistakes. He prays that John won’t be able to read that story in his scars.
“You do worry me, Sherlock Holmes,” he said, turning to the tablet in front of him. The black-and-white CCTV flickered as Sherlock himself pocketed his phone, turning his gaze up to the camera and crossing his brow impatiently. Mycroft started deactivating the cameras one by one, almost painfully slowly; he was being stripped of reassurance as each one blackened out. The last one remained in the sitting room of 221B Baker Street, where a grey-haired man was dozing on the couch.
The phone picked up. “Sherlock?” John said, “She’s here - you were right, it’s got to be replacements - the girl’s here. Alive.”
Mycroft had developed many epithets over the years. Tubby was one of them, as a child – a ceaseless nickname given by Sherlock and Redbeard in his youth (he flicked his head slightly; Mycroft disliked thinking of Redbeard, as if the blame was on his shoulders). Another one was Ice Man, one that was additionally unpopular with the man yet often echoed in his brain like a continuous insult. It was justified, admittedly – it matched with his opinions and morals, which he had tried to force-feed to his little brother for many years but simply ended up fruitless.
The girl herself, which he decided to dub The Client, was still on the phone. But she finished up before he could tune into the conversation, then turned. John knew instantly this was not the real Kelly - that was to say, the deceased corpse he met earlier in an alleyway in a different part of London. Her height was a bit different, her posture, her weight a little thinner… and, of course, she was a smoker. Was her eye color different? It was too dark to tell.
"Victor? Oh I don't know, who knows if he got reincarnated as well?" John said with a little shrug. Sherlock simply chuckled, though John couldn't see what was so funny about that. In fact, if this boy had such an obsession with this Victor character, he couldn't see why his loss would be considered a joke.
"Our parents had names." John pointed out. Sherlock sighed, though he couldn't imagine himself naming that little thing after their parents, especially when they had hardly known the people. It seemed almost a death wish, imposing the names of the fallen to their only glimmer of hope.
"Don't even try it, Sherlock. Don't." John insisted. Sherlock ran at him again, to which John ducked away, and this continued for quite some time until finally Sherlock used his only formidable weapon. Sure he had long limbs, yet John was quicker, stronger, and running purely on fear. However, whether Sherlock had planned it or not, he played now to his only advantage, and John's only weakness. He used his beauty so as to disadvantage John for just a quick moment, and he did so only when he tripped over the foot of some sort of desk chair. Maybe that chair had been planted there by some sort of higher power, for it was ever so convenient that Sherlock might fall in the very direction that John had been standing, and John then standing directly in front of the old bed. And so together they fell, Sherlock giving a terrified little cry as he wrapped his long arms around John, as if to make sure he would break any fall they both took. Yet it ended so that they didn't hit the floor, they hit the mattress, and for a just a quick moment John felt paralyzed from head to toe, for he had not been tangled with anyone in such a state of breathlessness before, he had not held another body close for as long as he could remember...for as long as he had this wedding ring. There was a moment when they were both impaired, obsessed now only with the weight and proximity of the other, and the heart beats that were flaring up so agressivley in their chests. John wondered for a split second if that was it, if they had been both fighting something for so long, and this fall may just be the tipping point. He wondered for a moment, as he stared with eyes wide into Sherlock's beautiful, swirling irises, if this was not the moment that they both abandoned any shred of decency they might have had and given way to their century old desires. God, if there was a chance that they might be destined for each other, well then what better chance to prove it than now? Yet just as John had thought of the idea, and as all of his limbs went numb in anticipation, Sherlock finally found the power within himself to sit up, snatch the envelope from John's pocket, and jump to his feet in victory.
"Well at least it's not far." Mary commented as she looked out the window from the backseat, watching as the trees went by in blurs as they sped through the desolate English countryside. It was the early winter, in which the air was crisp and all the trees were left barren from having lost their leaves in the autumn, blowing about in the wind with their naked bark providing a dull gray compliment to the cloudy sky looming ahead.
"Well the dreams we've been having, that's all. They all seem to involve someone, another character in this great play of past and present." Sherlock admitted.
"You knew?" Sherlock presumed, sounding a little bit apprehensive but relieved all the same. Perhaps he thought that John's preparation would have lessened the blow. He was wrong, for at the moment John felt that breaths were coming quite difficulty, and his expression must have at least displayed some sort of worry.
"Good night Watson." He said with a nod, obviously having heard nothing of what I had said and instead trying to dismiss me. Yet curiosity was a dangerous thing, and even though my friend and a meddler were about the same as a landmine and a wandering boot, well still I had to ask!
"Yes alright. Give me a moment, you gentleman can sit down and have a cookie if you'd like." She said with a grin, gesturing to the little waiting room that had been set up next to her desk. It was made up of a single couch and a coffee table, one that seemed to have every issue of gossip magazines since the Town Hall had first been established. The mounds of magazines were topped with a little pink tray filed with sugar cookies, equally ancient things by the looks of them.
"You're going to leave me like this? You're going to leave us both suffering all day; I've got an exam after lunch! How am I supposed to
"I'm sorry to hear that." he muttered carefully, for what else could anyone say in response to that?
"You haven't got a car, Sherlock, you'll be stranded." John reminded him. Sherlock sighed heavily, extending his feet out towards the other end of the couch and giving a little groan of annoyance.
"Not faces too." John pointed out again, in reference to the picture they had found before. "Mr. Sherlock Holmes, welcome to your past." Sherlock gave something of a shutter, now going to sit on the desk in some agony, hanging his head in his hands and shuttering nervously. While Sherlock recovered from the shock of his cyclical timeline John took to opening the letter. Well that might be some sort of invasion of privacy, however with some examination of the contents he found with something of a fearful shutter that he wasn't invading anyone's privacy. In fact it seemed as though this letter belonged as much to him as it did to Sherlock...for it was Sherlock's name on the envelope, but John's name at the bottom.
"Well your theories are ridiculous! That house wasn't just a cesspool for homosexuals; it was something more than that! Just because there was one pair of you doesn't mean the whole house was lining up waiting for their turn in your bed!" John exclaimed in a shaking voice, feeling as if he was rather losing control of his words and body. He felt as though he had no other choice but to burst out into a fit of anger, simply because he felt as though anyone who was not so conflicted as he would see Sherlock's theory as a personal insult. Surely any married man would jump with claws raised at anyone who might suggest they were gay? Is that not what he was now expected to do?
"Well, if it makes you feel any better, most crazy people don't know they're crazy. So I guess, I mean, if you're that self-aware..." Greg began, but cut himself off with some hesitation after John stared at him for a good while.
"I suppose I could love you, John." Sherlock decided at last. He thought about it for a while, and with his very narrow definition of love it seemed as though perhaps they could manage it. He was attractive, and in a way he was gentle enough to admire. He would make a good father, and perhaps a good husband as well. What did they have to lose, really, by committing to each other?
"That's what they all say, Professor. People in horror movies. They always just jump to psychological issues, but in the end it really is a ghost." Sherlock said eagerly.
"Why do you say it's hellish? I thought this was some nice mansion, and if it's really pretty, and nicely kept, well then what's the issue?" Greg wondered in some protest, in his own mission to prove that he knew everything. Well of course he wouldn't understand, John felt as though there was only one other person who had even the capability of understanding his struggles. And that was, of course, Sherlock Holmes. The boy who should be making his way through the halls any moment now.
"What do you mean by that?" Sherlock wondered with a bit of a sour taste in his mouth. The word love, well it had not been spoken on this ship since their parents had died.
"Ya, sorry about that. I got in and my head was killing me, I had to do something about it." John grumbled.
"Well that's very nice of you." John scoffed, checking his watch and giving a defeated little groan.
"I like things that make sense, Greg. You know that." John groaned. "And this deed seems to be as much an enigma to me as you are."
"But not me! It can't...no it can't happen to me." John muttered. "It was one night; it was one time, one mistake! I should never have...."
"Why don't you stay home from school today? We can all go for a walk in the fresh air; it'll be good for us." Mary suggested with a little smile, pulling John's plate out from under him with the understanding that it would go uneaten. John groaned, rubbing his dark, hallowed eyes and forcing a grin onto his face.
"As if you don't ignore me here." Mary muttered, pulling her hand away and storming out of the bedroom in one of her little fits. John sighed heavily, shaking his head and deciding that if Mary wanted to be difficult then it was her own fault. Besides, there was no possible way she could be allowed to come get Victor. First of all, that would expose their operation, and John would have no choice but to confess everything! Secondly, Mary's presence would just spoil what time John had left with Sherlock before he felt that he had to hand him over. Oh John really did have a way of digging himself into a hole, didn't he? One that he would never be able to escape, no matter how hard he tried. For if he was trying to lie to Mary then she got mad at him for the little parts of the lie that he didn't account for! And if he was trying to be truthful to Sherlock, then Sherlock got mad at him for the things he couldn't control! And if he fell in love with Sherlock...then he couldn't say a word, lest he be crucified for it. John sighed heavily, deciding that he really best not argue with his wife right now. He had enough trouble with her as it was, and to add some more fuel to the fire would be unnecessary. She didn't deserve to hurt, especially for things that were completely out of John's control. It wasn't his fault that she couldn't tag along to the conference that didn't even exist. And so he went back to packing his things, throwing in a couple of shirts, some shoes, pants, and a dinner jacket just in case Victor decided to take them somewhere fancy. Truth be told, John wasn't expecting this to be a very large affair. He wasn't expecting this to take very long, just long enough for the two of them to drag Victor back to England with them, and introduce him to the house. Who knows, maybe he'll have already packed in anticipation. Maybe he was just waiting for the okay. John felt as though he would have a stroke of luck if Victor was hesitant, and considering his luck thus far, he decided that it was thoroughly impossible. If he wished for something to happen then certainly the opposite would occur, especially when his relationship with Sherlock was involved. John then moved to his work bag, knowing of course that even in Paris he would have to keep up with grading. He was dumping out some important files when out came that picture frame, tumbling out on top of his clothes so as to display Sherlock once more. This ancient photograph, taken undoubtedly to torture everyone who saw it in the future, anyone who might be allowed to imagine Sherlock as they knew him in that same state. John sighed heavily, staring deep into those eyes, those eyes which depicted emotion he may never see in life. Only on this tattered picture would John be able to receive such a gaze from Sherlock Holmes, only on this tattered picture would he see any amount of Sherlock that was not supposed to be made public. John sighed heavily, deciding that he had no choice but to throw that picture among his clothes in his bag. Besides, if Victor needed any proof then that picture would surely serve as enough. There was no denying that ancient photograph depicted Sherlock Holmes, the man that lived now.
The man himself, the eldest of the Holmes siblings, was intimidating in his own manner. The shortening crop of his dark hair was neatly combed back and the creases on his forehead furrowed in the depths of his thoughts. There was a slight growth of a pot belly, one that just refused to vanish despite his work-out training and diet but it didn’t deter him very much. Poised in his windowless office, he sat with his chin resting on his knuckles, eyes closed. You would have thought he was asleep.
“What cameras?” Mycroft asked innocently. For a brief second, he felt childlike again, as if trying to hide his mischief from his elderly figures or teasing his younger brother- but he shook off the feeling quickly.
“Ah, but was she? If she was out and about, her hair and clothes would be soaked but they're only damp. And why would someone step out to smoke if they don't smoke? Because maybe they don't - but their
“Not just that,” Sherlock said, “John, as I have said before - you may not be the most luminous yourself but you are an excellent conductor.”
when others are too out of their depth to. Mr and Mrs McKenzie, over the past seven days, has your daughter been in any way different? Any personality changes - hobbies - any surprising changes in the slightest?”
John did not reply. He exhaled slowly and tapped his foot, staring down at the floor. Then he responded, “Reckon this is going to be another unsolved case then?”
His thoughts were interrupted, once again, but this time not by Sherlock. Instead, it was by a woman standing around the corner, a phone to hear ear and the locks of a gold-brown hair flowing in a bob, with the ash of a half-smoked cigarette building up on the end of the stub.
“I’ve found what I’m looking for,” Sherlock replied, and swept up to stand tall and face John, “More evidence. First of all - the girls handwriting. Look at this.”
“Not at all, little brother,” Mycroft replied, with a slight twist of a smile. He ended the call, placing the phone on his desk and outwardly sighing.
“Mr and Mrs McKenzie?” John asked solemnly, and gave a slight bow of the head, “I am so sorry to hear about your daughter… truly.”
John came over to one of the notebooks the girl had been studying out of. Both pages were flooded with writing, certain lines and key-words highlighted. John squinted at the writing. If he looked carefully…
“Of course I will,” Sherlock replied. His hands were behind his back, his silvery eyes gazing between the pair.
John stared at Sherlock for a moment, a little incredulous. This was a bit of a leap. The evidence sort of made sense, especially the part about smoking…
Sherlock’s gaze flickered to glance out the glass pane of the doors leading out into the back garden where the sun was now steadily lowering, casting a deep golden glow filtering through the fabric of the cream curtain. Sherlock’s clever eyes reflected the deep orange of the sunset, then turned back to face John again.
“I’ll be just round the corner,” she said, and John realized she was probably talking to whoever’s foot was crushing his back, “Deal with him. I can’t have witnesses. Sorry, Doctor Watson..” The passenger door opened, and she clambered into the seat without sparing a second look at John, slammed the door and the car rumbled away down the street.
chatter at that: gossip, giggling, mindless babbling and pratting about pathetic, and quite frankly pitiful, conversation topics that did not expand the mind or make decisions on the
The point that Mycroft Holmes was trying to make to himself was that his office was really quite comfortable.
Finishing in his spiel, Sherlock glanced to look at John. The soldier sniffed and gave a nod, rolling back his shoulders. “Bloody brilliant.”
Mycroft’s thoughts were disturbed by the calling of his phone, which rattled beside him, but the man made no physical movement to display any sign of being startled. Instead, after a couple of rings, his eyes lazily flicked open and travelled to the screen which glowed the caller’s ID:
“Going back to your dead daughter,” Sherlock proclaimed a little loudly, and John threw the man a cold look as the mother quietly starting weeping again, “I have a few questions. Was your daughter a smoker?”
The mother broke down into fruitlessly suppressed sobs once again, and the father pulled the woman tight to his side, grimacing.
John did not bother to disturb the man. It gave him time to at least reflect on the strange feeling that was bubbling up in his gut again. He sat himself down on his favourite seat, stretching out his legs and aching knees.
“Everything I ask in an investigation is relevant,” Sherlock said, his voice smooth and confident, “Everyone’s minds are so wrung by the facts in front of their nose that they miss out on the tiny yet most important details that could resolve a case in a heartbeat. That is why I am here - to
He had turned a corner into an alleyway, and he suddenly felt his legs give way as he tripped. Falling to the wet pavement beneath him, his chin slammed against the concrete and the wind was momentarily knocked out of him. John saw his phone clatter from his hand, but as he reached out to snatch it back a foot kicked it away. Not
“Alright,” John said, but added as Sherlock made to stand: “But eat your noodles, first. That cost me £4 and God knows I hate wasting food.”
“Sometimes I feel like I might as well be,” John replied bitterly. In truth, he was half-wishing he hadn’t brought this up. He wanted out of this place right now - away from that bloody idiot, gazing at him like a confused child -
“I won’t let go of him,” Sherlock repeated, and added a little more weakly, “I can’t let go of him, Mycroft. I just…. can’t.”
he bitterly thought as he handed over the money and clambered out of the back seat). By the time he had trudged up the stairs and into the living room, Sherlock had already retired onto the sofa, fingertips gently pressed together and eyes closed. He had his nicotine patches - yes,
Ignoring his stutters, John turned on his heel and marched out the door, leaving Sherlock sitting upright on the sofa. Slamming the door behind him, he headed down the stairs with his blood pumping. He barely noticed Mrs Hudson, who had been busying herself in the hallway.
“Simple. New phone. Brand new phone, in fact - not a single scratch mark in sight, not on the charger or headphone jack, so it’s not secondhand either - needed a password upon set-up, first thing people can think of? Birthday. Birthday was in her files. Just a matter of which order it is - practically unlocked it first-try.”
“There was an indent on her nape from a needle puncture. Clearly, someone else administered it and likely in surprise, too. Recent puncture but not fresh.”
“The way you often treat him, I’m occasionally inclined to believe otherwise,” Mycroft said, with an air of coldness that even surprised himself.
But Sherlock had gone into the kitchen, and John returned the crying woman with a sympathetic smile before following him. The kitchen was of smooth marble, connected to a dining room; Sherlock was leaning against the counter of the kitchen island, holding an iPhone with a pink plastic case.
“Wolfsbane. Very fast acting poison, but comes in the form of a flower. Just touching it can cause problems.”
John swallowed his food, placing down the plastic fork. “The girl’s name was Suzi. Her description matched up with Lestrade’s recount - too drunk to remember Kelly had gone out.” He bit his lip for half a second to recount what she had said, trying to strike out the garble of pleading to prove her innocence. “She said the girl had gone bathroom and came out looking worried about something.”
“Are you sure?” The man’s eyes narrowed firmly, crouching down to survey his friend, “They kicked you quite a bit, if I had been sooner -”
It was probably the latter. Who had been the one to find out the “pink lady’s” phone was right outside Baker Street? Who had been the one to gun down the cabbie when Sherlock’s life was on the line? Who had helped Sherlock when he was attacked at the circus? Who had been the one to actually find the enemy - admittedly, not in the best way by being captured - but he did it! Had he not shot down the hound who tried to kill Sherlock and Lestrade? Was it not him who--
“Her phone was found just outside the club, according to the files” Sherlock said, not turning to greet John as he entered, “Someone handed it in as lost property and it was identified as it was handed in a few minutes after the girl left - a connection, obviously, made by me. That and the fact she is a subject in her lockscreen along with other friends.”
Look around the room: handwriting on the notebook smudged because she’s left-handed - empty tea-mug titled to her left to pick up with her left hand - pens on the desk that were abandoned there were on her left, but the pencil holder is on the right, though tilted to the left when moved to reach with her left hand. Power sockets - plug on the left but more scratches on the right from more usage. People look but don’t observe, that’s my problem with Scotland Yard and why they come to me.”
foot. And then another foot pressed down on the top of his back, just near his nape, holding him down.
“Agreed. What’s the matter this time then? I do hope you haven’t been dabbling in your ‘medications’ again.”
“Yeah,” John said, “Fingernails have a yellow tinge to them… and her teeth. So you were right about the smoking part.”
His favourite handle so far was “the British Government”. His confidence shone with this one, pleased to actually have gotten somewhere in life as a Holmes – as if you could call being a private detective a career! The man didn’t even get paid! That poor doctor, trying to pay the rent for himself… but that was beside the point. Almost immediately after the incident with Eurus and Redbeard, Mycroft had decided to assume the weight of the responsible Holmes in the family. It was good he did too, because his drug-fuelled fool of a brother wouldn’t be able to. Despite the fact he had both the title of the family name and the entirety of the United Kingdom on his shoulders, he did his utmost to never waver or show a sign of weakness. One false move and it all comes crashing down.
Mr McKenzie cleared his own heavy throat. “I mean, i-it was just a normal night. We had dinner together, some homemade pizza… then half hour after dinner, she said she was off out to a party and she’d be home late. Then she left… and that was the last we ever heard of her…”
Really. It was like sitting at a meeting between a United States and Russian representative. A derisble and unnecessary feud (and a waste of his bloody time).
The woman was quick, he’d give her that. He was forced into a light jog as he hurried to meet her, turning a corner of a street.
“Just what I’m thinking.” He locked the phone, sticking it in his pocket. “We’ll need to show this to Lestrade when I show my theory… but we’ll need more evidence. Come on.”
The woman gulped shakily. “Oh, well… she’s always taking photos on her phone, i-it’s on the kitchen side… oh, what’s the word for it - taking pictures of herself, all dressed up and p-pretty…”
The rant exploding in his head, that had slowly been getting more aggressive, was abruptly cut off by the deep, baritone voice. John’s head flicked over to where Sherlock was lying, who had not moved position but simply turned his head to look over. John shuffled in his spot, not uncomfortably but rather defiantly, before replying: “Figure that out well enough, huh?”
John snapped his eyes shut for a moment, then breathed in. John Watson was a soldier and he knew better than to let dark thoughts like this infect his mindspace. There was no time to relish in the past voluntary. Focus on the present.
what cameras,” Sherlock continued crossly, “I can see them clear as day, and it’ll be a matter of time before John does too.”
The mother’s retched gasp in surprise made Sherlock have to resist the urge to roll his eyes, but luckily it was the male who answered defiantly. “No. She’s had no past experience in smoking - not in any form of drugs, asides drinking. Nobody in this house smokes.”
“Sherlock, brother dear,” Mycroft spoke, his voice thick with a sort of condescending pleasantries, as if mocking the happy women who would greet friends on the phone with raspy giggles, “What a surprise, I didn’t expect
Oddly surprised at the firmness in John’s attitude, Sherlock’s gaze slid very momentarily, perhaps just within the slight space of half a second, to John. This man seemed to be full of small surprises today - perhaps he was not telling him something? Or something was persisting the man? But now was not the time to linger - Sherlock knew John was fully capable of dealing with whatever internal struggle might be happening.
With a billow of fabric, he stepped back into the living room but did not trespass in further than the door. “We’re almost done here,” Sherlock said, “I’d like to see her bedroom last. Please, refrain from that expression - I know what I’m doing.”
“Certainly, Mycroft,” came the response from the other end of the phone, “That’s more Mrs Hudson’s thing, don’t you think?”
was it… right? A form of irritation. John was irritated at the detective. Irritated… impatient… mildly aggravated. Yes, that was it. But
Again, there was no response from the end of the line, but Mycroft could almost feel Sherlock’s desperation. It pained him. He dragged out an outbreath of air. “The cameras will be turned off tonight and I will send someone to remove them.”
John hardly had time to make his first move before realizing he was, apparently, playing the black pieces of the chess game. The girl spotted him, dropped her unfinished cigarette onto the pavement and walked away without stomping it out, the phone still pressed to her ear. John followed, digging out his own phone from his pocket and hurriedly dialling.
It was John who picked out their spot for lunch - a rather small and newly-opened Japanese restaurant. The two preferred their Chinese takeaway, but John felt it might be nice to branch out a little. It only had two people on the counter who stuck their noodles in a cardboard box and pointed to them to the benches available to sit at. But it was cheap at least, and not too bad either, he thought as he picked at the noodles and tried to eat them without the noodles flicking up his nose. Sherlock wasn’t eating his much, but when did he?
“Not at all, your business is your business.” Strictly untrue, Mycroft had tabs on John almost constantly, almost as much as Sherlock at this point – though admittedly he only preferred to intervene when he was certain it was a 100% dire situation, which thankfully was rarely (the truth was, Sherlock could handle himself - when it came to a case, that is. John was more talented in that form, however.) “I merely heed a warning.”
“Ah,” he said, and opened his eyes to stare at John. His eyes were tingling with excitement, a slight twitch of a smirk on his lips, “How interesting.”
“Of-Of course you’re not,” Sherlock stuttered, “But… you know well enough what my temperament is like - you know I’m not one for praise and thanks, but -”
John glanced up to Sherlock, noticing that the man wasn’t looking directly to John but his eyes were closed. “No… she just made an excuse, said she threw up in the toilet. Then she said she was going out for a smoke and that was the last time they saw her.”
“Yes. Like I said… we need more evidence. We’ll talk to the parents, maybe they can give us something.”
John hardly heard her reply as he donned his coat and walked out. He knew Sherlock was probably standing outside the window, the curtain slightly drawn back to watch John march across the street in an entirely random direction. He was also fully aware of the chances Sherlock would ring up his brother and request someone watch him on the cameras - the other side of the chances was that Mycroft was already doing it without Sherlock’s asking.
to step out and have a cigarette. But now Kelly’s body has turned up for us to find on purpose - why? Why did the replacement back out? And why show it off to the world, not even bothering to try frame it as a suicide?”
John looked up at his friend as they approached the door of 221b, still slung over his shoulder, and Sherlock looked back. Their eyes met.
to the face and sending him sprawling back on the pavement. There was very small chances of getting back up; best he could do was protect his head, face and throat and waiting for the blows to pass.
John couldn’t help snicker a bit, which made his ribs ache, and they set at a steady pace with arms slung around each other; it really looked like Sherlock was just carrying a drunk buddy home - John was stumbling over his feet occasionally and looked a little dazed. Sherlock hoped it was just part of the act.
The girl has been replaced by someone and she - that's to say, Original Kelly - was a killed a week ago by her replacement. And since then she's been leading Kelly’s life - but obviously missed out on details. Was more sociable than she reckoned the original girl was, and her smoking - the replacement had a smoking habit she couldn't break, just
“And she specifically stated that the woman was going out to smoke?” Sherlock asked, eyes still shut.
The married couple exchanged confused glances, as if checking with each other, and John could almost read the answer before it parted from their lips. “No,” the man replied, “No - nothing noticeable…”
“A little. Coat was slightly damp but also dirty, but only at an angle on her back and arm, so it was from the damp trash in the bin she was placed in - it’s been raining quite a lot these past few days all over London, so why is her coat dry? Answer: the body’s been inside for a week, hence why it’s not remotely wet. No jewellery present but it's been there - there's slightly pink indents on her fingers from where it's been. Notice I said pink and not green - cheap jewellery gives you green markings from a chemical reaction on your skin and the metal. So, expensive jewellery then - but why would she take it off to, supposedly, have a cigarette? Not unless someone
This one was a fighter and certainly knew what he was doing. John was instantly winded with a harsh knee to the stomach then felt a blow to the back of his legs, finding himself tipped over and on the ground. The ground was
"John." Sherlock muttered, having peered inside of the wardrobe and been caught in something of a dead standstill. John hesitated, yet all the same he considered such a word to be a summoning, and he allowed himself to walk carefully inside of the room towards where Sherlock was standing. He had his hand on the door, holding it open so as to stare inside, at the wardrobe's contents. And yet the wardrobe was empty, save for one single garment hanging by a hangar inside. One single piece of fabric, left there with a purpose, left there with the intent of Sherlock finding it.
"Not likely." John muttered. Sherlock gave another long sigh, as if he was simply too sleepy to have this conversation.
"Oh God." John whispered, his legs going just about as weak as Sherlock's as he read the contents all the way through. Yet he didn't sit on the desk, not where this letter might be in full view of Sherlock. No, it was good that he had found this before Sherlock did. It was good that he found it before he incriminated them both.
"I mean, well are we going to treat him like our own? Are we going to be his fathers?" John wondered at last.
"No, I never...well who knows, Sherlock? We're still just grasping at straws. We accepted this theory because even as ridiculous as it is, well it's the only thing that seems to make sense. All science, all rational aside, it's easier to believe in reincarnation than it is to believe in coincidence. Especially this many coincidences, with names, and genetics, and interactions, and memories." John muttered.
"Is this who you've been running around with lately? My goodness, well I thought you had a suitor but I'd never have imagined that..."
"Well haven't I?" John said with an anxious chuckle, finally sealing the envelope. "Aren't we both sort of ghosts, I mean if you think about..."
if I've got this voice in the back of my head, just screaming?" Sherlock whined. There was the largest of frowns on his face as he walked into the office and sank down into John's guest chair. He stretched his legs wide, messaging his temples now with his long fingers, as if he thought that might do something to alleviate the pain.
John didn't tell Mary where he was going, partially because it was not her business to know every detail of his life, and partially because he didn't want her following. It was a Saturday morning, their planned day of investigation, and Mary's presence throughout the whole ordeal would be nothing but bothersome. Besides, the house may not admit to any of its secrets if Mary was hanging about, wanting to know what was going on the whole time. And so as John stood by the mirror, in a practical yet not all together hideous outfit (he was trying to mind his own fashion choices, if he was now up against a beautiful man for Sherlock's attention) he tried his best to ignore his wife's pestering.
"I was thinking about it." John growled. "The very picture is a mystery, because it wasn't on the mantle when I first toured. I can swear to that, and no one's been in there except me ever since then. So not only how it got there but..." John was interrupted now when the door in the back of the hall opened, and he allowed a small little smile slip onto his lips. "Well, you'll see the other part really soon I'm sure."
"Oh wonderful! Wonderful, I'll set another plate out." Mary said excitedly, for she always did love to meet new people.
"I don't know!" he exclaimed. "I don't know! God Sherlock, you expect me to know every crevice of my own soul, every little whim of this overactive heart of mine? Who knows what I liked then, who knows what I like now! It's just rather offensive that you don't seem to imagine me having the capabilities to be open minded!"
"Yes, but thankfully I can avoid it. You have a nice day, Mary." John said with a little smile, kissing his wife and child goodbye as sweetly as he could manage before grabbing his car keys and heading out.  Sherlock didn't have a car, yet just as arranged he was at the proper meeting place. Since he lived in an apartment near campus, the staff parking lot was the perfect place to go and get him. It was empty as of now, and so there were no witnesses as John pulled his car up to the curb. Sherlock was sitting on the bench, draped in that long trench coat once more, and looking quite chilled. Just as soon as he clambered into the car he held his bare hands up to the heaters, sighing in relief and wriggling deeper into the folds of his jacket.
"I am." John agreed. "That letter...well you can burn it if you like. I do not want to give anymore thought to my past."
"Sherlock!" John exclaimed horrifically, blinking his eyes so as to make sure he was reading this correctly. "Sherlock get up!" he yelled, jumping from his chair and going to rouse the man who was still sleeping soundly. John shook Sherlock's shoulder, finally forcing some reaction out of the man. He yelled sharply, lunging away from John and retreating into the deeper folds of the old couch.
"Thank you. It's nothing fancy, but then again, with a Professor's income..." John ended his sentence there, to which Sherlock smiled and nodded in understanding.
"I suppose it depends on how many old houses you own." John shrugged. A quick smile passed over the boy's lips, a smile that John had never seen before...yet one which affected him like nothing he had ever seen. It was a smile that warmed him to the bone, something that gave light to his dark heart, something that made his heavy feet feel as though they could fly... He took a quick inhale of breath, shaking out images in his mind, of that vulnerable man standing up against the bedpost, that man with the same face, and body. Yet how,
"That's not a guarantee." Sherlock assured quietly, rubbing his thumbs softly over his palms so as to calm him down from whatever fear was beginning to overtake him.
"One Hamish to leave a planet, and the other to see a new one." Sherlock proposed at last, trying his very hardest to think positively. It was a rather strenuous affair, and after a single optimistic thought he had to sit back and stare more out the window at the wasteland, trying to remind himself that there was no room in his brain for cheer, or for hope.
"Mr. Holmes, do you think I'm crazy?" John asked with a trembling little voice, his hands shaking now as he shoved them in his pocket, trembling a little bit at the man who stood before him. And yet he didn't feel ashamed, he knew that while he had just met this boy in the hall, just minutes before...well there was no point in hiding anything from him. In fact, it was impossible to hide anything from him. Because their secrets felt mutual, their pasts seemed intertwined and their futures seemed...destined.
"I see it as more of a solution than a problem in itself." I assured in a determined, stubborn sort of way. Holmes merely sneered, turning away and making his leave now towards the hallway, obviously to go and sulk in the privacy of his own room. I almost stopped him, for there was such a new sort of visibility between us that I wanted to see more, more into that complicated man and more into his ever complicated heart! Yet I was spared the trouble, for before I could open my mouth to question him he instead stopped on his own.
"Do you know any names?" John wondered quietly, starting down towards where Sherlock was sitting and standing a bit awkwardly above him.
"Yet with a man? Surely Watson you understand the issue in such a passion." Holmes snapped with a wince, as if it physically pained him to talk of such things with me. As if his past history was rooted much deeper in his present than he would prefer.
"Well, it's not yesterday anymore, is it Mary?" John snapped, getting to his feet rather angrily and snatching up his drawing once more. Mary gave a great sigh, as if she really was sick of her husband's childishness in situations like these.
"John this is something more than pain." Sherlock whispered quietly. "This is something more than just...ugh! What is it; I can't even put it into words! It's just a feeling, a feeling of devouring, like something is eating me up from the inside."
"Well you're just interested in it, who wouldn't be? It's a great big house, beautiful thing really." Mary assured.
"Ya, I know. I know." John grumbled. "I was going to go back after classes were over, maybe if we pay it some attention then..."
"I mean no offense, Mr. Watson. Only that you're married now, to a woman, and I could only imagine that sexualities rather come along with the soul. If we really are the same people then..."
"Yes, that is the way to do it." John agreed a bit hesitantly, feeling his throat closing a bit in anxiety. He knew that he wasn't in any position to make any suggestions, yet then again if Sherlock was waiting for the right person, and if John really was that partner he had all those years ago... No, what a terrible thought. John disregarded it, yet all the same his stomach was twisting in uncomfortable knots. He felt as though he ought to offer up some embarrassing information about himself as well, just to even out all of Sherlock's unprecedented confessions. He hated having to wallow in this boy's secrets, all the while leave himself as a closed book! Yet then again, his wife and child were explanation enough to how much he differed from Sherlock. And so John nodded his head once more, as if that action alone would be breaking through the awkward silence.
"You don't think we'll have to do it again? That doesn't scare you, the idea of an eternal loop, never resting? Just chasing each other in circles, under the authority of that house, for the rest of existence?" John insisted a bit fearfully.
"Who is it?" John's voice shouted back down, sending something of a chill down Sherlock's spine. He hadn't heard that voice since he said goodbye. Mrs. Watson turned to look at Sherlock in some confusion, realizing that she actually didn't know his name, and instead of asking she looked up at the staircase once more.
"It shall be more interesting once we finally get out of the woods and into the lab. Biology is your husband's profession, yet I very much prefer substances to creatures. Counting little salamanders...well it's a cross I have to bear all the same." Sherlock admitted with a grin.
"That's quite alright Professor. I admit myself to be a little bit lost as well." Sherlock admitted with a grin.
"I was in that house again, the one I inherited." John began, pausing for a moment and wondering why he was even telling this to Sherlock. Maybe it was just in an attempt to push some of these peculiarities onto someone else as well, so that he didn't have the bear the burden of the unknown alone.
"Or on the both of us." John offered immediately, turning in enthusiasm for a moment, his heart skipping a beat as he realized what this meant. Yes! Yes, it was the both of them, was it not? The house had been waiting for Sherlock to get involved; it had been waiting for the right moment to present John with his face, and with his image. The house wanted John to see that he was not alone, and however crazy he felt, well he was not alone in that insanity! The house had brought them together for a reason, because...well maybe because they had been together before. Maybe this house was not John's alone to bear; maybe this house was not purely his burden.
"Professor, I really must be going to class." Sherlock said finally, his hands trembling just a little bit as he handed the picture frame over to John. The man sighed heavily, feeling almost as if he had no right to take it. He felt as though Sherlock owned that picture, simply because Sherlock was the one depicted in it. Yet all the same, well he felt a certain protectiveness over it as well. It may not belong to him, but then again it was his all the same. It was his to cherish. And so John took it, nodding stiffly, hesitantly, for he didn't think that it was yet Sherlock's time to walk out of his life.
"Alright, then maybe I will just move it back a bit." Sherlock decided finally, pulling the level and sliding the chair almost all the way back, just so that he could sit like a normal person.
"Oh that sounds so creepy." Sherlock admitted with a shutter, yet he nodded. John knew where the cellar door was, hidden away in the kitchen as it was with most old houses. To get to the kitchen they had to cut through that beautiful dining room, with the chairs all poised to host another feast, and the windows standing so tall and proud on the opposite wall. There seemed to be no evidence of age in this room, for even the red curtains hung stiff and strong. It was a gorgeous room, somewhere John could see himself hosting happily. It was a strange vision, really, and yet he could see himself and Sherlock sat in those chairs, in their waistcoats of that appropriate fashion. He could see the table laden with food; he could see the sunlight streaming in through the glass. He could envision a life here, with that man, regardless of what time period it was. Perhaps it was a dreadful thing to speculate, but John was quite sure that he could live here with Sherlock if the boy would finally permit it. The kitchen was much less glamorous; it wasn't nearly as fancy, with mere wooden countertops and an ancient gas stove. All the same, the kitchen wasn't what they were here for. Their door in the corner was their subject of interest, that little white painted thing. It gave John the creeps just looking at it, partially because he knew that no one had been down there for as long as the house has been left abandoned, and secondly because he knew that anything could be down there, waiting for him. Who knows wat could be there, how many animals, or even corpses! And there certainly wouldn't be any lighting, that was for sure. Good thing John had packed his flashlight.
It would be so easy to end it. So easy to make himself feel calm and in control, to stop that damn shaking, to stop his eyes from darting back and forth on a never-ending loop between two empty armchairs. To quieten the thoughts in his head. The voices.
So he still doesn’t actively consider it an option. But it’s there, subconsciously, no matter how hard he tries to suppress it. It’s been growing in the past few days and it seems to advance by a league every time Sherlock kisses him. Every time he leans his head against his shoulder. Every time he looks at John in that way, as though John’s the only fucking thing that matters. John is fairly certain that Sherlock has never looked at anyone else in that way. Not even Irene Adler. The pleasurable tingling John experiences when he thinks of it is somewhat perverse yet utterly irrepressible.
He’s never acknowledged it because, well, he’s not like that. He’s never seen himself as someone who swings both ways. It's not that he’s ever had a problem with that sort of thing… in other people. But he’s not like that. There have been instances before, particularly during his army days, but it’s never been… it’s never been something he did. It’s never meant anything. Everybody have minor crushes on everybody in the army. The general agreement is that it’s a poor and temporary substitute for female company. It’s been just the same for him. He honestly barely remembers who he fantasised about in Afghanistan because, really, it didn’t matter.
He doesn’t say much during their visit. After he initially expresses surprise at their presence only to be shut down in true Holmesian fashion, the only other thing he feels comfortable saying is to ask whether he should leave the room so Sherlock’s parents can be alone with their son. But Sherlock is adamant that he stay. So after checking with his parents, who seem surprisingly tolerant of John’s presence, John hooks the leg of his trusty plastic chair with one foot and sits down to watch as Sherlock’s mother fusses about the bags underneath Sherlock’s eyes and the appalling information available from the so-called information desk downstairs and Sherlock’s father smiles and shakes his head good-naturedly. Which is how John ends up the recipient of Sherlock’s silent pleas for help from the ten-minute mark onwards to the bitter end of the hour.
This isn’t about rumours or public images. This isn't about the legend, isn’t about the stories, isn’t about the adventures.
“I never said it was funny…” Sherlock tries. His voice sounds so small. Vulnerable. Right now, that's not enough to quench John's anger. “Yes, Sherlock, you did. In every way short of actual speech. Now let me just tell you, it’s not. And I will not stand here and pretend just so you can get away with this way cheaper than you should, like you always do!” His voice rise to a shout on the last words.
Sherlock almost recoils. Moriarty’s hand against his skin is an alien feeling, causing every alarm bell to sound in Sherlock’s head. His instinct is to pull back. Yet the touch is far from unpleasant. It’s soft and warm and inviting. Perhaps more than anything, it’s sorely needed. And Sherlock stays, transfixed by Moriarty’s eyes as much as by his touch.
With Sherlock safely settled in the couch, reclining with his head against the armrest, John steps back to survey his work. He shakes out his shoulders a little restlessly, feeling strangely motivated to go and do something. He can’t just stand here, can’t just sit down and turn on the telly. But Sherlock has closed his eyes, apparently drifting off to sleep again, and John doesn’t quite know how he feels about the prospect of rummaging around a flat that is no longer his own, tidying and organising and pretending that he still has the right to feel indignant about Sherlock’s poor use of space and general disregard for potential health hazards. Would he feel justified in taking a look around Molly’s flat and moving things around while she was asleep?
John fights with his tears. He doesn’t feel as though he deserves to cry. Mary is the one who should be crying, but she’s calm and cool as ice.
Even then, she’s here for John. Even though she is, John can’t bring himself to be there for her. He’s barely able to keep himself from falling apart. Keeping someone else together, even if it’s Mrs. Hudson… that’s a bridge too far at the moment. It’s as though he’s back on the pavement outside Bart’s, blindly leaning against whatever stranger is offering him their support. He isn’t capable of offering any support in return. Everything feels just as chaotic, just as surreal, just as horrendously
”I thought I had a choice! I thought… I thought I could single them out and delete it all, all these emotions, and then… then I’d be able to just be! Be what I always thought I was meant to be… be better, smarter, faster! An era-defining genius! I thought it was a choice I took… but in the end, I couldn’t do it! I couldn’t turn it off, I couldn’t not feel! I thought it was all in here, in me, and I just had to let it out! But in the end I’m not that person! I never have been and I never could be! I’m not anything… anything other than this…
and other monosyllabic and slightly uncivilised swearwords. It helps to say them aloud in his head, John finds. It makes everything seem a little bit more real, reminds him that there’s still a completely normal, boring world outside where friends are out having beers in pubs. It’s funny how much John has willed himself to forget his coping mechanisms after the Fall – some of them far less acceptable than uncivilised swearwords – yet how quickly his mind and body seem to return to them now, completely on instinct.
, damn it. But how can he when Sherlock pleads with him not to push further? When he looks at John like this, miles and miles of sadness and regret and pain and loneliness and other things John has no idea how to interpret emanating out from him?
words that Sherlock has ever spoken on the subject in the entirety of John’s experience with him. It takes John’s breath away.
Christmas is just a couple of days away and being out and about in London is frankly a nightmare. Everywhere you look, there are people rushing by looking for presents or buying additional stuffing or talking loudly into their phones complaining of that family dinner they’re dreading or taking care of the other seventeen thousand preparations that need to be made before Christmas can arrive.
Then there’s his body. John has always thought that he was attracted to soft curves and voluptuous shapes. He’s always preferred shapely women. He's never minded women with a little extra padding in certain places. Sherlock is the very antithesis. He’s skinny, strong but not overly muscular, his chest is flat, and his hips are bony. But perhaps John has been mistaken all along when it comes to his own preferences. Because looking at Sherlock’s naked body is like looking at a marble statue. It’s a work of art, and yet it’s perhaps that little bit too close to physical perfection for John to fully ignore that what he’s faced with is a naked body.
It’s only now, his brain finally beginning to feel like his brain again, that he’s able to fully appreciate the enormity of the mistakes he’s made and the crippling sense of shame that those mistakes bring up in him.
Moriarty, had promised to burn the heart out of him. And as demonstrated by that fatal showdown on the roof of St. Bart’s, Moriarty had known exactly where to look for it. Who to target. Was it really such a stretch to imagine that he could have anticipated the outcome of their confrontation and put plans in place that would take effect if he shouldn’t make it off that roof alive? After all, that was what Sherlock himself had done…
Carefully, Sherlock slides down from the edge of the sink. He pulls his dressing gown around himself, once more concealing his back from view, and fastens it with the tie in the front. He’s halfway past him before John realises that Sherlock is on his way to his own bedroom, attempting to shut the door on this whole discussion.
“Stop…” Sherlock’s voice is feeble, half-strangled in his throat and forced out through his lips in a gush of air.
getting the last laugh in His own cruel way. Because Sherlock won’t wake up. He bloody won’t wake up! According to the doctors, there’s no physical impediment to explain his prolonged lack of consciousness. He’s breathing normally, steadily and all by himself. The machines attached to him are nothing but monitors. He just doesn’t come to. Which John is enough of a doctor to know is a merciful term for a coma. Sherlock’s doctors can use as reassuring a tone as they want, it certainly did little to reassure either John or Mrs. Hudson. They’re doing everything they can for him and they’re going to exclude every other possibility before arriving at any conclusions. But the facts are the facts: a coma caused by Sherlock’s overdose is the most plausible explanation.
But today, in this very flat, very much in the real world… Mary had helped John put Sherlock to bed and Sherlock had caught a glimpse of her hand as she was adjusting the duvet that had sent cold shivers down his spine. He hadn’t been able to sleep after that. He’d been lying awake, trying to deduce, trying to remember, trying to make things make sense.
The meal passes seemingly in fast-forward as Sherlock struggles for some semblance of control and the time of his speech moves closer. He can barely eat, though he does try to put on a show for John’s sake. How everyone else manages to do this – relax and talk and have fun at these hideously drawn out social occasions – that has always been beyond Sherlock. But if it has always been difficult for him even under normal circumstances, now it’s downright impossible.
"Holmes you don't need to be ashamed, of course such a thing is a tad unorthodox but it is not entirely uncommon! It's a perfectly human, perfectly redeemable trait to fall in love." I assured him quietly, thinking there was no better option than to console what could only be described as pure despair. Holmes looked to ache so terribly bad, not only because of his past influences but also of the future pain such permanency had left him with in his adulthood. To think that Milverton held these condemning things in his safe, when was he planning to use them? When did he think it the best time to threaten Holmes's career and his life as a free man?
