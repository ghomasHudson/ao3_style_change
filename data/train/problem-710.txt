The moan turned into a groan; when encouraged by Sherlock’s verbal clues, John slid a hand down to brush over the now obvious bulge in the detectives’ trousers.
When he got up to answer it the last person he’d expected to see on his door step was Mycroft Holmes and for a moment John had actually been speechless with shock.
When John had asked why he was doing this, Mycroft’s expression had been both scathing and colder than any he’d ever seen on the other man’s face and John had actively flinched at the others explanation.
“Sherlock, just so there are no more misunderstandings here... I have to tell you that I am not only very much in love with you, but I rather urgently want to say fuck it all and take you to bed.”
His mouth twisted in a self depreciating smile, as he looked back down to the baby he held in his arms.
Sherlock had been beautiful and sensual without even realizing it and it was only natural that John would notice; there was nothing wrong with admiring Sherlocks looks, it didn’t mean he wanted him in that way, it was just that Sherlock was so extraordinary that even with as straight as John was he could still appreciate him; in much the same way as he would a piece of art or a magnificent animal. Finding someone attractive didn’t mean you wanted to sleep with them.
John stilled internally, as the expression in her eyes flickered with some emotion he couldn’t read.
The man standing in front of him was all that John had wanted for years, but because of his own stupid prejudices’ and misguided belief in Sherlock’s inability to care for another person, he’d nearly lost him completely. And now his own wife was quite possibly carrying a child that may or may not be Sherlock’s.
He was still frozen, when Sherlock moved forward sans any of his usual customary grace and without hesitation, dipped his head down and took John’s mouth in a somewhat clumsy but passionate kiss.
“Yeah, well you made it pretty clear what you thought of me the last time we spoke, so I think I’ll survive.” He replied in his mildest tone.
“That would be lovely John, assuming our daughter doesn’t decide to make an early entrance. The doc did say everything looks fine, but he seemed to think she might turn up any day now.”
She frowned again before sighing, and John felt himself relax for the first time since he’d arrived at work.
In the end he had quietly slipped away and then knowing he couldn’t possibly go back his and Mary’s flat, he had booked himself into the nearest hotel and gone on a bender that lasted three days.
Sherlock seem to take his silence as some sort of confirmation of whatever else he’d been thinking, because the next thing John knew he was seeing a side of Sherlock Holmes that he’d only ever seen directed at others.
He’d also gone on to explain; that if you were going to tell an untruth it was best to hide it by minimizing the details, so as not to get caught out by some outside factor or a lapse in memory.
“No you are bloody not... you are going to explain to me why after nine months you have barged into my flat at arse o’clock in the morning only to yell at me and then punch me in the face.”
“Fuck! You and Mary must have been laughing behind my back this whole time. Poor clueless John and his tiny brain will never work it out, yeah. Well fuck you both Sherlock Holmes... I know now, so you better explain to me how the hell it happened before I knock your teeth down your throat.” He barked out.
John could hear the snarl of frustration in Sherlock’s voice, and he found himself grinning as he pictured the expression he must be directing towards his brother.
If he was to believe Mycroft, Sherlock had been in love with John and everything he’d done since jumping from Bart’s right up to shooting Magnussen, had been because he loved John more that he valued his own life. Even his apparent drug lapse for the case had more to do with his devastation over John’s marriage, than his need to give Magnussen leverage.
On the one hand; he hated Sherlock for letting him grieve and lying to him for all the time he’d been absent. But on the other he was fiercely joyful that his friend had returned. Then there was the agonizing knowledge, that Sherlock hadn’t cared enough for him to realize what his death might do to the only friend he had. And then there was his rage at the blithe and thoughtless way he’d reappeared; just when John had finally got his life to a point where moving on didn’t feel like a betrayal.
“Well...I don’t recall seeing it in the bedroom, but I was in a bit of a hurry.” He offered.  “Don’t worry love; I’m sure it will turn up. You probably had one of those moments that I’m not allowed to mention... seems to be the day for being a bit absentminded.” He grinned, hoping his comment would annoy her just enough to derail any suspicion.
John stood shell-shocked as the taller man started to pace. His obvious agitation clear in every movement and expression.
With Moriarty’s supposed return he’d hardly seen Sherlock since that day, but it still hadn’t stopped Mary from making several careless and offhand remarks about cats with nine lives and Sherlock having the luck of the devil.
It doesn’t matter how many times he’s gone over it in his head; he still can’t understand why Sherlock has gone to so much trouble to make sure that John and Mary stay together. And yes, he knows Sherlock loves him in his own way; he’d more or less confessed that very thing at John’s wedding.
Sherlock was making the most delicious sounds and his body was hard and urgent against John’s equally needy form. But John knew that as much as he wanted to drag Sherlock off to his room and live out all his fantasy’s of what he’d like to do to the younger man, now was not really the time to get distracted. Not with everything he’d learned today.
She’d obviously been in a rush to get to her appointment and somehow managed to miss the fact that her phone had been left behind.
For several minutes that felt like hours to John he was lost in the sheer delightful feeling of having a very aroused and passionate Sherlock plastered to every inch of his body.
Gesturing for the other man to enter John moved to the kitchen and waited patiently to hear why Mycroft had come. Though he had a pretty good idea he knew what his visit was all about.
After deciding that and tucking his own phone away, he wrenched the back off Mary’s and removed the sim card just to be safe.
Johns head was spinning with the knowledge that he was about to experience something that he been sure he’d never have the privilege of knowing. He was going to have sex with Sherlock Holmes, something he never would have dreamt of before today. Sure he’d had fantasies; truth be told he’s had some fairly intense wanks to said fantasies. But hot sweaty sex after the adrenalin of a case, was a far cry from declarations of love and the promise of actual real lovemaking.  And yet even that familiar term doesn’t seem to really encompass what they are about to do.
As far as Mycroft Holmes was concerned, John had done all the damage he was ever going to do to Sherlock and he added that if he had any residual respect and compassion for the man, then he would leave Sherlock to get on with his life.
John reached out and grabbed Sherlock’s arm; Sherlock reacted by turning sharply and punching John in the face.
John trudged up the stairs to his flat; his body weary from another seemingly endless day at the surgery and yet another week of sleepless nights.
He knew he should be basking in the pleasure of having Mary out of his life, but he was much too depressed to even celebrate the end of his marriage.
For long moments Sherlock didn’t speak. His gaze sweeping over John as he did what Sherlock did best.
John paused; deciding that a bit of eavesdropping might just be in order.  After all, anything that had Mycroft Holmes angry enough to drop his ice man facade was bound to be of interest.
He had barely spoken to Sherlock at the airport before Mycroft had swooped in and whisked the younger man away and it had been half a dozen extremely tense days before he’d gotten a reply to his numerous texts asking Sherlock what the hell was going on.
“Look Sherlock, it doesn’t matter what Mycroft said or didn’t say... that was ages ago.” He offered, trying to seem unbothered while giving his former friend an out.
It was only as he felt Sherlock’s hand at the zip on his trousers that John came back to his senses.
“He claims I am the dramatic one in the family, but his obsession with this most recent business, rather effectively decries that particular claim. He’s done nothing but witter on about Moriarty ever since we left the tarmac.” He offered disgustedly.
“But as much as I want you, which by the way is rather a lot, we really do need to talk” he offered apologetically “because I’ve had these feelings for a very long time Sherlock... but up until about two minutes ago I had no idea that you even thought of me in that way?”
He then allowed that John would probably have once done the same for him, but that was back when Sherlock had been the only thing that had kept him interested in living. He added; that he should have seen that John no longer needed Sherlock as an emotional crutch when he’d chosen to return to his lying assassin of a wife.
“Give us a ring or a text when you find your phone. I might pop round to Baker Street after work if you’re going to be late. Bit concerned, Sherlock hasn’t been in touch about the M situation.” He offered with a deliberately concerned frown.
His, what the fuck are you doing here, had elicited little more than a brow lift and John had found himself doing his very best not to reach across the table and punch the other man.
Sherlock moaned, his breath hitching as John deliberately brushed his rapidly hardening erection against the others thigh.
He admitted that he’d actively encouraged John to go back to her, because he’d loved John so much that the only thing he’d wanted for him was for John to be happy; that John’s happiness was more important to Sherlock than his own, because he’d believed deep down that John would only have done the same for him.
“I have only ever truly loved one person in my life and that person has and always will be you. Until three weeks ago I had also managed to fool myself  into believing that what I felt for you was purely platonic and even though I knew you meant more to me than Mary I was too stupid to realize it was because I loved you in a totally non friend way as well. I was so fucking blind that I married Mary because I was scared of how much I’d grieved when I lost you after you jumped from Barts. And just for the record... I had no idea that you could feel that way about me... why would I. I’m just a tired old soldier and your you... You could have anyone if you wanted. I never even thought about us in that way... probably because I already loved you enough as a friend that subconsciously I was scared that falling in love with you would only destroy everything we had if you had worked it out.  I’ve also never in my life, no matter what you believe, been attracted to another man, but saying that it still didn’t stop me from fall head over heels for you.”
She peered up at him, her gaze guileless, and John immediately flashed back to a lecture that Sherlock had given him after a particularly convoluted case, on what he’d termed; the art of lying.
Less than a minute later John had her clean and dry in a new nappy and was headed back to the kitchen with a considerably quieter baby.
Of course he’d tried to bury said epiphany under his panicked worry for Sherlock’s life. Telling himself later that it was only because he was so afraid he was going to lose him for a second time. He tried to convince himself that the attraction that he’d felt for Sherlock nearly right from the start, had been put aside years ago and that he wasn’t gay anyway; that he loved his wife. He reasoned that he loved Sherlock like nobody else he’d ever known; simply because he was like no one else he had ever known.
He’s on his way to the clinic where he works, when he realizes that he’s forgotten the keys to the drug cabinet.
“Sorry...Bleeding cheek, sending you down, the lazy cock. And Mycroft can go sod himself, if you’ll pardon the language. It’s not like I don’t know what they are up to, the pair of nobs.” He smiled his own apology.
“Thanks for that by the way... don’t know what that total load of utter bollocks was all about but tah. So anyway I went home and pretty much from the first night I knew it wasn’t gonna work. Then the cafe thing with you happened and all I could think about was what a complete arsehole I’d been not see how much I’d been hurting you all along....”
He’d forgotten who he was talking too. Sherlock had always read him like a book and here he was practically drawing him a diagram.
And if his earlier thought’s hadn’t been torment enough, just the fact that it was Sherlock he was more torn up about, rather than his wife and her poisonous actions...well that really said it all, didn’t it.
“God, you are insufferable.” Sherlock huffed.  “Listen to me brother mine, James Moriarty is dead. Molly herself did the autopsy and substituted his body for mine. He is not coming back and I find your unnecessary paranoia tiresome in the extreme. Yes I will admit that on the surface, this seems without a doubt to be Moriarty, but what you seem unable to grasp is that whoever orchestrated this is not playing the same game at all.”
“You are the only person that I have ever wanted in that way and you are still the only one I want”. He confessed shyly.
Sherlock’s expression was rueful as his gaze rose to meet John’s; before once again dropping to hide his expression.
“You see but do not observe John. If you had stayed a little longer that day you would have seen Lestrade arrive and arrest the man you had seen me so ardently kissing. The kiss was a ruse to pick his pocket, nothing more. It was a case John not a love affair.”
He paused before answering, as he would have if he really was trying to remember whether he’d seen her phone when he’d gone back to the flat.
“After I left the cafe that day I did quite a lot of thinking. I’d already known as I said that the marriage wasn’t going to work, but after everything you and Mycroft said to me that day I found myself looking at a lot of stuff about my life that I hadn’t wanted to see before. First thing I admitted to was that nothing I had was worth losing your friendship, but also that you were right; I was toxic to you and you would be far better off without me hanging around. Second thing was that I should have never married Mary in the first place. That I’d convinced myself that I was in love with her rather than face the fact that the life I’d had with you was the only thing I’d ever really wanted. I realized that I’d used Mary as a shield against being hurt by you again and I only had myself to blame for the entire damn mess.” He snuck a quick glance at Sherlock’s expression before looking away again.
Mycroft had gone on to say that he had never understood what Sherlock saw in such an ordinary little man and he’d long been sure that it could only end badly for his brother, but he’d thought at the very least that John had valued his friendship with Sherlock.
Now as his eyes met hers, he had to forcibly remind himself not to check on the location of her phone in the pocket of his coat.
“I stopped loving Mary the night she put a bullet in your chest... Actually that’s not quite accurate... I stopped thinking I was in love with her that night, if I ever really was.” He looked down at the child in his arms and smiled wistfully.
Five seconds after that John Watson got the shock of his life when Sherlock Holmes stepped forward and kissed him like he’d never been kissed in before his life.
Unfortunately the best is utter shite and has been since Sherlock got off the plane from his aborted trip to Serbia.
No. He refused to believe it. Sherlock was his friend, he wouldn’t, he couldn’t do something as cold as what John was thinking.
All this time later and even after everything Sherlock had done for him, John still couldn’t bring himself to think about the expression he thought he’d seen on Sherlock’s face the night of Johns wedding.
He was surprised to see that he was only a stop away from the flat that he and Mary shared and at the same time, troubled by the thought that even now he still didn’t think of the flat as home.
Then there was the whole pregnancy brain thing that he was not allowed to bring up; under pain of sleeping on the couch. She’d really gone off the one time he’d mentioned it just after they’d confirmed the pregnancy and he’d been wary ever since. Though these days, sleeping on the couch seemed a lot more attractive than it should have been.
He watched her face carefully as he spoke, wondering if she’d slip and give a hint of the truth, if there might be a flicker of guilt brought about by his words.
He wondered what Sherlock was doing right now. Was he curled up on the couch at Baker Street or submerged in some fantastical case that Lestrade had given him, or maybe playing his violin as he gazed out the window of the flat.
Her comments at the time had sent a fission of something very like dread up his spine, but she’d quickly laughed it off when John asked her what she meant. Then she’d changed the subject and John had been left with the feeling that somehow he’d missed something important, but he couldn’t for the life of him work out what.
Apparently that didn’t change the fact that seeing Sherlock in a stranger’s arms felt like someone was tearing his heart from his chest.
It had taken him some heavy soul searching and repeated combing over his memories of his and Mary’s every interaction, but in the end John was relieved to find that for once in his life, it seemed that Sherlock Holmes had got something wrong.
John licked his lips nervously, and when Sherlocks gaze zeroed in on his mouth, he felt his own face flush as his heart leapt in his chest with a sudden unexpected rush of hopeful understanding.
Ironically enough it was his sister that had tracked him down.  How she’d found him he’d never know and he hadn’t bothered to ask. She’d cleaned him up and listened to the whole sorry tale and then she’d sat him down and given him a dose of tough love that John could barely credit coming from his usually dysfunctional sister.
Fuck it. Just get through the day. You were a soldier and a doctor on the front lines, how hard can it be to get through one day.
John wishes he could stop thinking this way. He wants to put his suspicion and distrust of his wife away. He needs to find a way to love her again; or at the very least be able to tolerate this marriage that he chose.
John just hoped that he knew how lucky he was. Unlike the ungrateful bastard that John had been. Sherlock deserved to have someone that would treat him like the amazing man that he was; someone that would be there for him even when he was being a
Stunned at that revelation John had reeled under Sherlock’s next admission, that that it was only after he had shot Magnussen and been about to leave for his ‘trip ‘ to Serbia that he had finally seen what Mycroft had been trying to tell him ever since he’d returned home after the fall.
“I was so angry with you when you came back that I was very determined I would never be in the position of letting you be the most important thing in my life again. I’d met Mary when I was still grieving and I suppose I rushed the relationship a little because at least when she was around I could forget about your death for a while.”
Sherlock directed a smirk at his brother.  It was his... that’s telling you grin, and John couldn’t help the snort of amusement at the air of smugness that was radiating from the detective.
The John Watson that had married Mary Morstan would never have dreamed of violating his wife’s privacy.
Cursing under his breath, he quickly dials Mary’s phone to ask if she can drop them off on her way to her appointment with her obstetrician.
Cursing himself as seven kinds of stupid, John edged into the bushes and made his way around to the far side of the open space where he knew Sherlock was sitting.
Regardless of her once purported love and her supposed willingness to make things work, she never did let go of the fact that John had chosen to stay with Sherlock as long as he did. And no matter how many times they argued back then, she was still unapologetic about shooting his former best friend.
Sherlock was cradling his hand and glaring at John as if he’d deliberately meant to damage Sherlocks hand with his face.
Of course; Sherlock could have told him that feelings were the one thing that could never be deleted. Still; John somehow managed to get through the following years without thinking about what he’d buried. The constant guilt over Sherlocks’ death more than enough to keep him from searching for reasons to feel worse. And by the time Mary had come in to his life, Johns’ walls of self denial were firmly set.
Pulling it out of his pocket and looking down at the caller id he saw a vaguely familiar number come up on the screen.  Still shaken by his thought’s, it took him a moment to recognize that the number displayed on his phone was that of the clinic where he worked.
“Bloody weird coming from Harry of all people but yeah... I listened and then called your brother and asked him if the threat he’d made was still doable.”
So far she had seemed mollified by his words, but it didn’t stop him wondering if she’d gone home for her phone first; that perhaps all her casual questions had been an attempt to catch him out in a lie.
There would be no more chases through the London streets and no more laughter over Chinese. He’d never get to giggle with his best friend at a crime scene while making fun of Anderson’s new haircut, or the current state of Sally Donovan’s knees. He’d never again fight Sherlock for the last of Mrs Hudson’s biscuits, or patch Sherlock up because he hadn’t seen the barbed wire until it was too late.
“Well actually first I left the park and got shit faced for three days and then Harry came and found me. After that I sobered up and you know the rest”. He finished reaching for the bottle.
And it also didn’t hurt, that her irreverent and often slightly off sense of humour had kept John amused in a way he hadn’t felt since giggling at crime scenes with Sherlock.
There was no way he was letting Sherlock leave the flat until he found out just what the hell was going on.
If it wasn’t for Julia’s existence and Mary’s continuing threats he’d be long gone; marriage vows or not. Threats aside; Mary had also made it more than clear that if he left, it would be the last time he ever saw Julia and no matter how much he might have hated his wife, he couldn’t do that to her.
Fact; John Watson had always believed in Sherlock Holmes. So if faking his death and disappearing for three years hadn’t shaken that belief, then he refused to let one text from his lying wife’s dodgy ex do it.
“Look Mycroft, if you two can’t even agree on something as simple as the pricks death; then maybe it’s time you were off. I need to speak to Sherlock, and frankly I don’t feel like standing around watching you two stubborn arses argue all night. So how about you go and do your super spy thing, and maybe make absolutely sure that all your ducks are in a row, and then you and Sherlock can continue yelling at each other tomorrow.”
“Um... well first up hello to you too.  Secondly, if you mean the little domestic dispute that involved my wife being jailed earlier tonight... well I thought that would be quite obvious... and lastly I have no fucking idea why Mycroft told you that. He was barely here ten minutes.”
“So anyway... we got married because that’s what you do when you buy someone a ring and you’re doing your best to ignore the fact that you’d rather be with your best friend who faked his death for two years. Of course the whole thing went to hell the night she shot you. After that I could barely even stomach the thought of being in the same room as her let alone anything else.”
Jesus! He must have been blind to have missed this. Maybe he really was as dim as Sherlock sometimes accused him of being.
Happy with the new positioning, John let his hands slide from Sherlock’s hair as he gathered the lanky detectives form closer to his own. His hands swept down the long back, tightening, even as he felt Sherlock relax into the kiss.
It had been barely two days after they had gotten back together before he realized he was pretty damn sure that whatever she might have been, it wasn’t her past leaking through that he’d found attractive. Just the thought of her being capable of pulling a gun on Sherlock had had his skin crawling and even with his decision, he still hadn’t known how he was going to bring himself to touch her intimately. He couldn’t even kiss her on Christmas day when he’d taken her back; all he could think about every time she came near him, was how many other times had she shot someone for her own purposes and whether she’d felt any remorse at all.
“Can’t you just leave it alone please? I knew Mary had kept the gun so I brought a duplicate and then I swapped it out and gave the gun to Mycroft. I just wanted to get both Julia and I out of it. I hated that bloody bitch so much that if Harry hadn’t picked up on the threat Mycroft made when I spilled my guts to her, I probably would have ended up snapping and shooting her myself one of these days. I wish I’d never met her... never mind marrying her... she’s cost me fucking everything.”
When would this even have happened? And more to the point; why would a man who had never seemed even remotely interested in any sort of sexual relationship, suddenly decide that sleeping with his best friends fiancé was the thing to do.
“I had for most of my life believed I could live without sentiment; so it wasn’t until Moriarty threatened your life on the roof of Bart’s that I understood that what I felt for you was far past my control” he admitted looking down; his expression hidden behind the veil of his lashes.
“You don’t get to just assault me and storm out anymore. I’m not your bleeding flatmate or even your friend any longer, so you can go sit the fuck down in the lounge and explain to me what the hell you are thinking with that big brain of yours.”
Sherlock yelling at his brother was not entirely without precedence, however Mycroft’s raised voice was not something John had ever experienced and with a brother as trying as Sherlock, that was no small feat of control.
Two and a half weeks ago he’d put Harrys’ plan in motion and now he just had to sit back and wait for it to all fall in to place.
Six o’clock that evening saw John Watson alighting from a cab at his former address; Two twenty one b Baker Street. Pausing outside the door to the flat, John took a deep breath and tried to calm his nerves.
Carefully shielding his relief at her words, John reached down and helped her up from the chair she’d occupied while waiting for him. Kissing her lightly on the cheek, he guided her towards the clinic doors.
“Anyway he was right to threaten me with Mary’s arrest, not that it was the reason I stayed away. He’d said a few things that I happened to agree with when I’d had time to think about them and that’s all you need to know as far as that goes. Now... why are you here? Did you just come by to ask me about Mary’s arrest? Or was there something else you wanted?”
He was going to be a father and his wife was a lying former assassin who he didn’t trust. And to top it off, he was pretty sure he was in love with his best friend; the friend that had done everything in his power; up to and including murder, to ensure his marriage to said lying assassin could continue.
God. He’d really cocked up his life. And now all he could think about was Mycroft’s expression as he’d asked about Sherlock.
Sherlock was sitting on the bench as just as John had guessed, what he hadn’t guessed was that he was not alone.
He was doomed to disappointment, when instead of yet another attempt to reason with Sherlock, Mycroft’s voice was raised for an entirely different reason.
He reached for Sherlock’s arm, but before he had a chance to make contact Sherlock slid away and backed up against the kitchen cupboards.
He smiled apologetically; relaxing internally as he made his very real excuses. The last thing he wanted to do was spend time in his wife’s presence. Especially not after what he’d just found out.
“By the time the baby was born she’d made it clear that if I tried to leave she’d make sure to finish what she started with you and when the baby arrived and I realized she wasn’t even mine... well by then I knew full well just what she was capable of. Julia might not be my child but I couldn’t leave Mary; not with her threats against you and the way she was with Julia.”
John is abruptly hit with two very separate and opposing emotions. One is a wave of homesickness that makes the back of his eyes burn with strain, and the other is a renewed rush of anger at the man in front of him.
It was only after seeing Sherlock in the park with the man that he undoubtedly loved that John finally admitted that he’d had enough. He’d lost Sherlock for good and no amount of self imposed penance in the form of his wife, could make up for the monumental cock up he’d made.
Far more likely that he was in bed with his boyfriend, offered the nasty little inner voice that sounded a lot like his wife.
“No matter what you believe, my reasons for returning and staying in the marriage had everything to do with Julia and nothing to do with my wife. Whether you choose to believe that is up to you.”
He didn’t hold out much hope that Sherlock wouldn’t read him like a bloody newspaper, but he didn’t want to face him without at least some element of calm on his side.
So John had sat down and taken a good long hard look at himself and asked what had attracted him to Mary Morstan in the first place. Had he subconsciously seen something beyond what was on the surface? Was Sherlock right?
“Sherlock what happened at Bart’s? What did Moriarty do to make you jump that day? I know you said you did it to protect us and I’m sorry I never asked you for the details, but I’m asking now?”
He wrapped both arms around himself; his body language along with his one word entirely defensive, and John felt something in his heart strain as if to break.
Less than an hour later, John got the call he’d been half expecting. His performance might not have won him a Bafta, but he prayed it was just good enough to keep him breathing a little while longer.
“It honestly never occurred to me that you might feel more than friendship for me and I was for the most part content with that. I was understandably alarmed when you came here this evening and demanded that we talk. I thought you had finally deduced my feelings for you and were about to expel me from your life. Instead you have allowed me to kiss you and admitted to feelings that I barely believe possible. If I was a more fanciful man I would fear I was dreaming again and that I would wake to find you as far from me as I have always believed you to be.”
Jolted from his thoughts by the sound of Julia’s crying John entered the flat and prepared to face his wife for what would hopefully be one of the last few times.
“You’re probably right; I expect I left in the kitchen or something.” She allowed dismissively, before changing the subject.
For nearly nine long months John had lived with the knowledge that he’d broken his best friends’ heart, but the sight of Sherlock in another man’s arms kissing in a way that John had seldom ever been kissed, obliterated every careful barrier he’d put up around his heart and mind.
He wasn’t sure what the phrase ‘terminate the marriage’ meant, but he sincerely doubted that David was talking about divorce.
There was no way he could stand to see Sherlock so happy with his lover when John felt like his heart was breaking and the thought of Sherlock finding him and possibly introducing the other man had John verging on panic.
As far as Mycroft Holmes was concerned John had lost any right to ask about Sherlock the day he’d left John sitting in that horrible little cafe.
Forcing the little voice in the back of his head down (the one that lately always seems suspicious of Mary’s actions) he sighs and rings the bell for the next stop.
“No thank you Doctor Watson. I am merely here to let you know that as of seven o’clock this evening Mary Watson was taken into custody by detective Lestrade and charged with the attempted murder of my brother. She will undoubtedly be extradited to face charges in the US and several other countries as well, but for the moment we have a very solid case due to the evidence you so kindly collected for us. More than enough to be going on with I should think”.
“Anyway none of that mattered because there was still the baby to think of and I’d already fucked up and lost you, so it didn’t seem like it really mattered if I stayed or not at that point.”
And at the time he’d thought he’d managed it. He thought he’d got it all under control. But of course all that was before he found out that it was Mary who had pulled the trigger.
She hadn’t even thanked him that day at the airfield and had instead seemed rather annoyed when he was recalled barely minutes into his flight. A flight that would have led to what Mycroft termed as a lengthy and difficult mission.
Then of course Mary had shot Sherlock and John’s world had abruptly folded, scattering and falling apart like the precarious house of cards that it was.
Bad metaphor’s aside, John knew that what he was feeling was a little off, some might even term it ‘a bit not good, but that wouldn’t occur to him until well after the second ambulance ride.
“God John. Perish the bloody thought.” She huffed scoldingly. She swatted his hand lightly as she edged forward in her seat in preparation of rising.
Ironically; considering the current circumstances and the two people involved, John now found himself following this advice.
He hadn’t questioned why Sherlock had asked to meet him in a cafe rather than at Baker Street. Hadn’t even wondered why Sherlock looked so grim when he’d sat down at the table across from his friend. So it had come as a rather large shock when Sherlock had informed him that Moriarty’s return was all a ruse to get Sherlock out of the Serbian mission and that Mycroft had set it all up.
The moment the door was open Sherlock barged right in and John could only gape as he instantly turned to face John and kicked the door shut behind him.
John felt his stomach churn, as he remembered the way Mary had seemed so accepting of Sherlock when they first met, and yet when she and John had come back from their honeymoon, she’d suddenly turned mocking and more than a bit contemptuous, practically overnight.
He also realized that if he told Sherlock the truth, then at least Sherlock would know that John had actually loved him and had really just been as thick as Sherlock had always accused him of being.
“Course, I was much less trouble... it was the pub for me and fortunately, unlike Harry, I actually waited to arrive until she got to the hospital.”
“That day on the roof I had planned for every eventuality, except the one thing I could not anticipate. Moriarty killing himself ensured that there was no other way to be positive that the sniper trained on you could be neutralized. Even knowing that Mycroft had pinpointed the snipers, I still couldn’t risk tripping Moriarty’s kill switch.”
He knew he would have to talk to Sherlock at some point as well, but at the moment he didn’t think he could face the other man without either breaking down, or punching the bloody fuck out of him.
“I have seldom been a frightened as I was that day watching you from that rooftop... and that is when I fully realized just how important you had become to me” he admitted; expression pained as his hand moved to cover the one still cupping his face.
“First up, I’m not a bloody visitor, I’m his best friend, and secondly Mrs Hudson, if his lordship wants’ me to bugger off he can come down here and tell me himself, the great git.”
The only thing he could think about was Sherlock; which was really nothing new, it was just seeing Mycroft had brought it all home to him again.
“But you... well you looked well into it. I well... I thought you didn’t do that sort of stuff... not your area and all that?”
“It really was quite stupid of her to keep the gun she used to shoot Sherlock and a rather lucky happenstance that you knew just where to find it. If I may ask, what made you decide to finally turn the charming Mrs Watson in? Marital bliss not what you thought it would be hmmm?”
Eventually she’d convinced him that he had to go home and she’d even come up with a plan to help him with the whole Mary situation.
And please... reviews are the only currency that a fanfic author gets, so any that you leave is often the only encouragement or acknowledgment we get to let us know that there are readers out there.
Even back then when he’d first returned he’d thought it was all a load of complete bullshit, no matter what Sherlock may have said in her defense.
Seconds later John found himself sitting dazedly on the edge of his bed with no memory of walking from bath to bedroom.
Giving John a wide berth he strode back to the living room and lowered himself to the armchair that John had so recently vacated.
Sherlock’s expression was wondering and slightly bewildered as he continued to meet John’s gaze. It was as if he was expecting John to be taken from him and couldn’t understand how he was still holding him.
Sherlock’s hand stilled on the kettle and John felt his heart lurch in his chest as Sherlock raised his eyes to meet his John’s.
Of course, that would last as long as it took for her to get a new phone, and for David to send another text. After that, all bets were off.
John had loved Sherlock for such a very long time; including the wanting part of that love; but he’d always been so sure that Sherlock didn’t feel that way about anybody, let alone him. Now that this was happening it seemed somehow larger than just lovemaking. Like everything else with this impossibly brilliant man, this seemed better and more intense than anything he had ever experienced with anyone else.
Feeling like the voyeur he was and filled with the type of pain that he couldn’t begin to process, John caught back a sob and slowly backed away from his hiding spot.
John knew he looked terrible, he didn’t need the others barely concealed shock to tell him that. He’d lost way too much weight over the last nine months and the tired lines and bags under his eyes made him look and feel like the old man he was rapidly becoming.
“Be just like a Watson to be early to the party yeah. Both Harry and I came early, according to mum. Bloody embarrassing for mum the way she told it. Harry decided to make her appearance in the middle of Bainbridges on a Saturday arvo. Caused quite a fuss.”
Sherlocks’ eyes widened at his words and John was once again treated to watching the world’s greatest detective blush like a schoolgirl.
Early on a Friday morning, barely two weeks after his Christmas day reconciliation with his pregnant wife; John Watson’s life unexpectedly changes again.
He’d managed to live with Sherlock for eighteen months; successfully lying to himself and everyone in his life about his feelings. Now with one look, that was most likely deeply buried wishful thinking on John’s part, he couldn’t hold back everything he’d managed to suppress for well over four years.
Now he just had to get through the rest of his day and work out what he was going to say to Sherlock.
He said it was then that he’d realized how stupid he’d been to believe that John cared in any way that was comparable to the way Sherlock had cared for him. And that he no longer wished to be any part of John’s life. That in fact; being in John’s life could and had only proved to be ultimately toxic to his own.
He moved towards Sherlock hesitantly. Part of him wanted to tell the other man that he’d changed his mind; that they could talk later, that he’d love a cuppa and maybe some Thai from around the corner. The other part was a hard pulsing knot of emotion that just wanted to have it out and done with.
Sherlock had only ever laughed like that at home where only John had been there to witness the lighter side of the man. Yet it was definitely Sherlock’s laugh.
John had gotten what he wanted when he married Mary and as far as Mycroft Holmes was concerned, it was exactly what he deserved.
He remembers at the time thinking that it was yet another reason why he’d thought Sherlocks explanation of John’s unconscious attraction to Mary was complete rubbish.
Why, Instead of the Lovely warm woman that he had married, John saw only an adversary that had very nearly taken Sherlock from him. Why, instead of being broken hearted over the lie’s Mary had obviously told him. He instead found himself angry at
No. It was very clear to John that as much as Sherlock valued his friendship and enjoyed his company, he was very not interested in John being more than that.
John knew he should just walk away; he knew that Sherlock was very likely just around the bend and very probably sitting on the exact bench that John had been bound for. But just hearing the younger mans laughter had set up such an ache in his chest that he couldn’t seem to make his feet move in the opposite direction.
Tightening his grip on the other man, John deliberately sought out his friends gaze and did what was possibly the bravest thing he’d ever done... he beared his heart.
Watching Sherlock’s hands creep up into the other mans hair was the single most painful thing he had ever experienced and it finally hit him; that the reason he felt this way was because regardless of his own self delusion, he was very much in love with Sherlock Holmes and he probably always had been.
Eventually opening up and telling Mary about Sherlock, had seemed to be the last missing piece in his long process of grieving. He’d thought that he’d finally reached the stage of acceptance; that his grief, if not completely gone, was at last becoming bearable.
“Why should my brothers’ happiness concern you? More to the point why would you care?” Mycroft asked his tone sharp.
John’s smile melted away the moment she disappeared out the door and he found himself counting to ten, as his rage surged up and threatened to choke him.
John felt jittery and knew it was his body’s reaction to shock, but he also knew he didn’t have time for any more wallowing. He had to get out of the flat before she got back, and as much as he hated it, he’d have to go to work and act completely normal.
He had truly believed that John had loved him and that he just wasn’t aware that his love for Sherlock was the sort of love that if it had been given half a chance, could have been more than simple friendship. He’d accepted that, as he’d accepted that the time for that possibility had passed with Sherlock’s faked death and John’s marriage to Mary.
Well that isn’t strictly true; a nasty little voice whispered in the back of his mind. He has been interested before, just not in you.
Mary and he had had one of their usual fights: John didn’t even remember what had started it this time; he just knew that he needed to get out of the flat and as far away from her as possible.
The wariness in his friends’ expression immediately sets off alarm bells in John’s head, and he had to fight very hard to remain calm as he watched the normally unflappable Sherlock Holmes swallow heavily, before deliberately averting his gaze.
“I’m putting the kettle on for tea, do you want one?” he asked stalling for time. He knew any second now Sherlock would say what he’d come to say and then he’d be gone again and even with the pain the others presence brought, John wanted just a few more minutes of being with the man he still loved.
His hands; that up till now had been hanging uselessly by his side, slid up and into Sherlock’s glossy hair; John carefully but firmly manoeuvring the much taller man, until his mouth was better aligned with his own.
Apparently as far as Sherlock was concerned John Watson didn’t care about Sherlock Holmes. John Watson saw him as a friend and no more because John Watson wasn’t capable of seeing beyond his own narrow view of the world.  And in that world Sherlock Holmes was an asexual creature that lived only for his next case and the praise of his one and only friend. And the worst part of the whole thing; was that according to Sherlock it was apparently the way John wanted it.
Pulling the kettle off the hob John reached for the scotch in the top cupboard and poured himself a hefty shot.
He’d obviously missed something pretty damn important by being such a coward. Because it was now obvious that Sherlocks’ feelings were far more involved that he could have guessed.
“God Sherlock! What the fuck does it matter. You told me yourself that you didn’t want me around. I believe the word you used was toxic. I just thought it was better to leave it. I’d obviously done enough damage with my friendship. And you should know me well enough to know that Mycroft Holmes doesn’t scare me.” He huffed looking away from the other man.
As he waited with baited breath to hear Mycroft’s reply, John could practically hear the eye roll accompanying Sherlock’s words.
It also didn’t help that Sherlocks mystery man was tall and nearly as attractive as Sherlock. He was everything John could never be and quite obviously not ashamed to kiss Sherlock Holmes in a public park.
John ran his hands over his face and tried to get his thoughts in order. He wasn’t sure if he should tell Sherlock what had been said that day... at least not the part about Sherlock having been in love with John. He’d already hurt the younger man more than enough and though his feelings had been implied in his speech to John, he rather thought Sherlock would be horrified to know that his brother had so effectively outed him.
John did not want to forgive her, because he loved Sherlock more than he’d ever loved her and not even the baby she was carrying could change the way he felt.
“You were always so quick to counter any misunderstanding about the nature of our relationship and quite openly stated you were not gay, so of course, I chose to hide my true feelings rather than lose your friendship.”
Sorry for such a long delay between chapters. RL and other things distracted me for a while and to be honest, I sort of lost a little faith in my ship after the latest season and wasn't sure if I wanted to continue this.
Sherlock was his friend, and John was going to choose to believe that the man he’d lived with and saved more than once, was not capable of hurting him in that way. And until he heard differently, he was going to keep calm and carry on in true British form.
Sherlock was flushed and his body language was defensive. Not the type of defensive that came from guilt, but the type that came from embarrassment and hurt.
“So what... you decided staying with a woman you no longer love and raising someone else’s child was the thing to do?” cut in Sherlock sarcastically.
He stared down at the text on the small screen and tried very hard not to throw it at the nearest wall.
When Sherlock whirled to face him John was alarmed to see the look of confused pain on the others face.
“Oh you know... that day in the cafe when he told me to stay away or he’d have her jailed for shooting you.”
According to Sherlock, the best liars often got away with their deceptions because the really good ones stuck to as close to the truth as possible.
In an instant, Sherlock found himself on his stomach, yelping in surprise. His eyes opened of their own accord, not that it mattered like this anyway.
“Have I told you how much I love your voice? God, sometimes just listening to you talk makes me chub up, even when it’s about one of your experiments. And then to hear you make these delicious sounds,” he thrust especially hard, and Sherlock keened right on cue, “all because of me… I think I could cum just from listening to you like this.”
John pulled him onto his side and hugged him close, kissing his cheek and hair. “Aww, love, I’m just teasing. That was bloody brilliant. Same as you always are.”
Impatient and needy, Sherlock pushed back again, his hole spasming in anticipation. John tsked and firmed his grip on Sherlock’s hip to still him. But he didn’t make Sherlock wait long before pushing in with one finger. It met no resistance, sliding all the way in in one go as John sucked in a surprised breath.
But he complied and pushed in two fingers instead. Though it burned a little and required a bit more pressure, Sherlock took them just as easily. He squeezed down on them, making a small, happy noise.
him with his whole body. He couldn’t hide or look away. Couldn’t come up with any way to doubt John’s affections. He felt…safe. Truly safe. It still overwhelmed him every time John did something to engender that feeling, making him want to flee and yet never leave in equal measure.
John’s hand switched to massaging each cheek in turn, giving him a break yet aggravating the hot, pulsing sting that had become a constant. “Not this time, though. I don’t think I have the patience to hold off from fucking you long enough for that. God, your arse is going to look so pretty wrapped around my cock like this.”
John slid his hand from Sherlock’s hip to beneath his lower back, pulling him tighter against him with a deliciously strong forearm. Trapping Sherlock’s weeping cock between them.
Problem was — though John made sure to be exceedingly generous in that regard — Sherlock was atrocious at asking for it or reaching out when he needed it. Even knowing that John would accept his attentions did nothing to abate the uncertainty and fear that knotted his gut whenever he made an attempt. Once it had been initiated, he turned greedy and demanding, but before that, the ball, as it were, was perpetually in John’s court.
Time blurred to a haze within their quiet bubble. At some point, Sherlock’s arousal flared to full life once more, which had him matching John’s movements as much as possible. His hard cock received some welcome friction from being trapped against the duvet.
Needless to say, John had noticed his reactions and had now apparently decided to put his knowledge to good use.
The blows paused for a brief moment, and when they continued, John’s breathing was more labored than before. “Fuck yes you’re mine. I’m the only one who’s ever touched you, the only one who ever will. No other cock will ever do for you, because I intend to fucking
Thankfully, John just looked at him with tender understanding and smoothed a gentling hand down his thigh. He adjusted his grip so that he held Sherlock’s hips, while Sherlock’s spread legs lay draped against John’s kneeling thighs. That grip tightened, the only warning Sherlock got before a hard, accurate thrust had his eyes rolling back, a cry on his lips.
John dragged a limp and smiling Sherlock off his lap and arranged him to his liking, still face down. The press of the duvet against his cock lasted only a brief, tortuous moment before John pulled his hips up so that just his lower half was propped up on his spread knees, arse in the air. The vulnerable, wanton position had Sherlock flushing, but he made no effort to move. This was what John wanted, and he wanted John to keep calling him good and perfect. Wanted to please him.
The hand on his arse squeezed hard, then disappeared, and Sherlock sucked in a breath just as the second swat came down, resulting in a strangled squeak. Another smack, and another, each a little harder than the last. Sherlock’s breath became pants, and with every blow, they came out as a helpless “ah!” in time with the involuntary jerk of his hips.
More pre-cum dribbled down Sherlock’s cock as he whined, as much from John’s words as his ministrations. He had no doubt John could do exactly as he claimed, and the thought of it made him shake.
Thankfully, Sherlock didn’t have to stay flustered and blushing for long, because John resumed their kissing with more passion than before, though no less sweetness.
With a drawn-out groan of sorrow and frustration, Sherlock rolled onto his back, hands pressed to his face.
Despite insisting to himself that John was surely just busy, he could not entirely dismiss the possibility that John had grown irritable at Sherlock’s earlier pestering, was perhaps even having second thoughts about this whole…thing. Perhaps distance or some pretty face had reminded him of all that he could have instead.
look at him like that, had yet to lessen since the first time. In fact, it might have gotten worse, now that he knew what was going to happen and what John’s hands felt like. Already, his ears rang and his cock leaked a wet spot in his pajama bottoms.
Ever helpful, John lifted Sherlock’s arm to wrap around his torso like he’d wanted and shifted a bit so that his bicep made a better pillow. Sherlock hummed a contented sigh when John hugged him snug to his chest. Perfect.
It shocked him, how much he enjoyed this, separate from any trappings of the situation (such as discipline). The sensation itself — the harsh sting and the way John ended each smack with a brief caress or squeeze — felt so
to give a talk, since clearly John was a better doctor than any of the simpering, arrogant imbeciles that would be attending.
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock. If I went any harder, I’d break skin. Fuck. You really loved that didn’t you?”
“That’s it, Sherlock. So, so good for me. This is exactly what you needed, isn’t it, sweetheart?” The next his was the hardest yet, and Sherlock gasped and moaned John’s name. “Fuck you’re gorgeous. And the sounds you make.” Another hard hit, another cry, with John thrusting up against him. “I wonder if I could make you come like this. Just from spanking your perfect arse. I bet I could.”
John wasn’t exactly unaffected, himself. Every few smacks, he’d press Sherlock further into his lap and grind up against him, cursing under his breath. And he was very effusive with his praise, telling Sherlock how beautiful he looked, how lovely his arse was, all red with his handprints. How good he was being.
His captain’s voice. A loud part of Sherlock always quailed in the best way to have it directed at him. Swallowing thickly around his racing pulse, Sherlock did as he was bid with shaking hands. The overwhelming newness of having someone look at him like that, having
Sherlock whined, squirming in John’s grip. As much as he enjoyed the praise, John was taking entirely too long to get to the fucking he’d been promised.
“Are you close, sweetheart? Gonna cum again for me? God I’m close, too. You’re so…” Apparently John couldn’t find the right words, because he set to sucking the sweat from Sherlock’s collarbones instead of saying what Sherlock was. Or maybe his actions were a sort of answer.
Fresh tears followed the tracks of the old, and he bit his lip in an effort to keep the sob in his chest off of his face. “Hello,” he said, choking on it. Trying and failing to pull his mouth into a smile that should match the joy buzzing under his skin.
Sherlock quaked with the overwhelming mix of pleased, aroused, and dirty John’s words made him feel. John said it like an endearment, which took any humiliating sting out of it. The buzz in his chest intensified, and with some effort, he found the courage (and mental capacity) to speak even as John built up a steady, hard rhythm, panting and nodding. “Yours, John. Ah! Only, nngh, for you.”
Little shocks ran up Sherlock’s spine with each movement, toeing the line between pain and pleasure. But it was more this sudden change of pace that had him shaking and whimpering. This wasn’t just John fucking him, but
Sherlock’s quiet whine turned mournful when John pulled out, leaving him clenching around an awful nothing. But before he could remember the words to protest, John rolled him over, hooked his arms under Sherlock’s knees, and pushed back in. Sherlock didn’t even try to muffle his guttural moan of relief, the thrill of being filled again almost as good as the first time.
Sherlock gripped the duvet and hunkered down further. Try as he might, he couldn’t keep the plaintive whine out of his voice. “John…” He couldn’t be sure in that moment if he was begging for mercy or for more. His heart hammered in his throat, and a tightness coiled in his gut.
John laughed, hand sinking into Sherlock’s curls, and shook his head. “Of course not. Definitely not worth it.” Eyes crinkled and bright, he cupped Sherlock’s face in his other hand. “I missed you far too much. Why do you think I cut it short? I couldn’t bear the thought of sleeping alone for another night.”
John hummed and pressed a wet kiss to a vertebra. “There you are. I knew you could do it. Such a good boy.”
He whimpered and spread his legs wider. “John… Please, John…” The words for what he wanted still wouldn’t come, even with his brain reduced to warm mush.
But John simply got a tight hold on his waist and braced him more firmly against his stomach. “Ah ah, you wanted to be disobedient and hide from me. So you’re going to accept the consequences.” His other hand caressed the stinging cheek.
. Nothing else had ever felt so exquisite, setting off a constant stream of a thousand sparks in his brain. Not the drugs, not solving a near-impossible murder. Nothing.
” He stuck on John’s name, hoarsely repeating it like a mantra or a prayer as his body drew taut as a bowstring about to be loosed.
John gave him another swat, making him jerk and moan, and before the sting could start to fade, he gripped Sherlock by the hips and pulled him back onto his cock in one unrelenting slide.
John. Being with him like this. Looking at him like that. Loving him. It was still so hard to believe.
A few moments was all it took to have Sherlock melted against him, panting soft sounds into his mouth and arching up to get closer. He rocked his mostly hard cock against John’s hip, groaning to feel John’s own thick length twitch in response.
. And on top of that, John had been right. It kept him firmly in the moment, in his body, and quieted the swarming noise in his head nearly as well as being fucked by John’s cock. But still, it shocked him, because he’d never thought himself a masochist. In fact, he rather disliked experiencing pain anywhere else.
“That was beautiful, Sherlock.” He continued rolling his hips, and the new position had his cock brushing against Sherlock’s oversensitive prostate, making him flinch and whimper. “Shhh, just relax. I’d like to try making you cum again. Would that be all right?”
—tumbled to the floor, now further away than it had been to begin with as it bounced and clattered to a stop just under the coffee table.
With graceful, controlled movements, John pulled him a little closer and, for just a handful of thrusts, pounded fast (but not frantic) right against his prostate before slowing to a luxurious roll of his hips that bounced him in his lap.
Sherlock nodded feverishly and moved with John as he pulled them up. They stumbled through the kitchen as one unit, crashing into a chair, then the counter, then the wall of the hallway. John trapped him there to ravish his neck with biting kisses. Whining, Sherlock tipped his head to the side in welcome and pulled him even closer. John licked up his neck and bit his jaw, making Sherlock tremble in his arms.
Just before one thrust, he gave Sherlock another hard swat, making him cry out. A few moments later, Sherlock was writhing and shaking against the bed, little ‘unh’s leaving him with every firm roll of John’s hips. The hot feeling in his gut built and built with such looming intensity, he was tempted to cringe away.
What John doesn’t understand, is why Sherlock hasn’t taken everything that has happened and used it to convince John to come back to Baker Street permanently.
It was the same feeling he got after a particularly brilliant case; one that usually ended in a frantic chase, the two of them giggling like mad as they made their way up the seventeen steps to their flat.
“Everything’s fine sweetheart, Doc said everything looks good so don’t worry. I just finished a little early because of a cancellation, and I wanted to see if we were still on for lunch?  I must have left my phone at home this morning, silly me. Thought I’d just nip by before heading home in case you’d tried to call.  You’re awfully late darling, was there a hold up on the tube?”
John sat on the couch and watched him warily. Not understanding why the other man seemed so angry at John’s explanation.
When the door opened to Mrs Hudson’s wary gaze, John found himself half relieved that it wasn’t Sherlock. As much as he had decided to trust in his friend, he would very much prefer having this particular conversation in private. And to be honest, John wasn’t at all sure he would have been able to wait until they got upstairs to have it.
Because even though Sherlock undoubtedly loved John Watson, John knew that the love he felt for Sherlock Holmes was decidedly not the platonic love that Sherlock felt for him.
When he re-entered the room barely two minutes later Sherlock was still seated in John’s chair, though he seemed even more on edge than he had been before John had left to put Julia to bed.
And now he was imagining all the things he’d never dared to think about when he’d lived with Sherlock. And the absolute worst part; to help said imagination John now had a very vivid memory of just how Sherlock looked kissing the blond he had seen in the park.
Sherlocks pupils were huge with arousal and they seemed to devour John as if he might disappear at any moment. But it was the emotion that blazed from them that had John’s throat tightening with the threat of tears.
Sherlock had been absent from John’s life for a very long time, and since coming back some of his actions at times were those of someone John nearly didn’t recognize. Case in point; he’d shot Magnusson. The Sherlock he’d known before his fall from Barts would have never taken a life; not for something that wasn’t a matter of life or death at the very least.
Then again, he’d been rather adamant about not wanting to know the details of Sherlocks’ fake suicide; or the reasons behind it. In truth, he hadn’t wanted to know the reasons that Sherlock had chosen to leave him behind so casually; hadn’t wanted definitive proof that Sherlock hadn’t cared enough to even think about how his actions might affect John.
She’d told him it was time to man the fuck up and do something for Julia that didn’t involve him staying with, quote: That fucking bitch that ruins everything she touches.
Instead; he’d pushed Sherlock away and married a woman that he’d thought was safe. Denied feeling anything for Sherlock; diving head first into a marriage that he knew in his heart wasn’t what he’d wanted; not since the night of Sherlock’s return.
Sometimes he felt just like the mice Sherlock used in his experiments. It was like he was trapped in a maze and every time he thought he’d found a clear path, it suddenly closed, leaving him breathless claustrophobic and unable to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
He’d calmly explained to John, that should he continue to pursue any sort of relationship with his brother that Mary Watson would be brought up on charges for the shooting of Sherlock Holmes and John would find himself in the position of single parent quicker than Sherlock could solve a case.
“Sherlock you are not listening to me. The broadcast may not prove that Moriarty survived, but it does suggest there is a deeper level of play involved than we first suspected. Your mission to Serbia was not common knowledge, and I think that even you would admit that the timing of it was highly suspect.”
He’d traded the life he truly loved, for a life of duty and boredom; the friendship of the best man he knew, for the love of a woman that didn’t exist.
Still, he’d made vows and there was the baby to think of, so John had done what he’d resolved to do and made the best of it.
So he’d only felt intense relief going to meet Sherlock that day. Relief to finally find out what was going on and even more to get away from the oppressive atmosphere of his and Mary’s flat. He’d also been looking forward to spending time with his best friend, who he’d been rather worried about ever since the whole Magnussen ordeal.
The rage and hurt he’d felt at Sherlocks deception, was outside of any experience that he’d ever had. Never in his life had he been so torn apart by his own emotions. Grief he’d dealt with and understood; it was a natural part of losing a loved one. But John had no frame of reference for any of his emotional responses to Sherlocks return.
He has a child coming, he reminds himself. He’s going to be a father and no matter what he feels or who he feels it for, that fact is something he cannot ever forget.
“Are you sure you want me to stop?” asked Sherlock with a pointed and knowing glance in the direction of John’s pants.
He’s seen how vindictive Mary could be now that the mask was off, he couldn’t risk leaving a child to be brought up alone by her; especially not one that she already used as a bargaining chip whenever she wanted John’s cooperation.
“John what the hell is going on? Frankly you look bloody terrible; you’ve lost at least three stone since I last saw you and the child you are holding is quite obviously not related to you. So perhaps you could do me the honour of explaining what you’ve been doing these last nine months that has got you looking so haggard?”
John knew that he loved the thrill of dangerous things; that he was at his most alive when his heart pounded with the thrill of the chase. He’d been barely coping with his life when he’d first stumbled into Sherlock’s world and for the eighteen months that they’d lived together, he’d never felt more needed or more alive.
Sherlock choked on a sob, shuddering. The reminder of what this was leading to made him sharply aware of how empty he was, how much his cock ached. He didn’t want John to stop spanking him, but he also desperately wanted his cock inside him as soon as possible.
Too much. It was always too much, especially when John started saying things like that. To hide from it, he threw one arm over his eyes, pants turning shuddery.
, so Sherlock was left stuck in a miserable, lonely ball on the couch, antsy and bored but unable to do anything but give in to the whiplash current of his thoughts, which revolved almost entirely around John. What was he doing, thinking? Was he having fun at that dreadful conference or was he bored? Did he miss Sherlock like he’d said in his last message, or was he just going through the expected motions? It wouldn’t be unreasonable of him to not miss Sherlock terribly yet; only a couple days had passed after all. The vicious ache in Sherlock’s chest as he pined was the anomaly here. He cursed his sentimentality yet again for crippling him as it had. Going most of his life without must have left him utterly unprepared for the intensity of loving someone as fiercely as he did John.
“All right then, Sherlock. You want to hide, I’ll let you hide.” The smooth, gentle lilt in John’s tone should have been reassuring, but was most certainly not. Hands pulled him sideways and into John’s lap. The position was such that John’s erection (now free of his pants) was trapped against his own, teasing but not offering any relief. “We’ll just have to find another way to keep you out of your head, won’t we?” Sherlock tensed with apprehension, not relaxing even when John smoothed a hand across his lower back and let it rest there.
He thinks back to the day; that last day before his life truly went to total shit and like a thousand other times he fails to understand how he could have gotten everything so badly and completely wrong.
All these thoughts had been whirling in his head as he’d passed through the entrance to the park and he hadn’t been paying much attention to anything other than his own anger as he’d turned on to the path that he’d walked so often when he lived at Baker street.
“Look Mycroft, no matter what you or Sherlock thought back then, I really had no idea that he had those sort of feelings for me... and if it makes you feel any better, I didn’t even realize I felt the same way until very recently. He might have been right about a lot of things he said to me that day, but that was the one thing he did get wrong. I loved Sherlock then and I love him now and I’ll have to live with it for the rest of my life... but I guarantee I honestly never knew he felt that way about me. And now I’ll never know if it might have changed anything if I had.” He sighed again.
His physical need to hurt Sherlock had shocked even himself and the fact that the urge was still there weeks later had troubled John, more than he cared to admit.
His hand slid up to cup Sherlocks’ cheek and when the taller man tilted his head in to the touch and met his eye, he asked the question he should have asked long ago.
Though it was par for the course that with his total lack of hindsight, that he wasn’t to learn exactly why that was until he’d taken a walk through Regents Park three weeks ago.
“Snipers John: three of them to be precise. One for each of the people that Moriarty deemed important to me.” He offered bluntly.
At least this time he had only himself to blame for his grief and he had the comfort of knowing that Sherlock was alive and out there living his life; rather than dead like he’d believed for those nightmare two years that he’d been gone.
“Sherlock meet Julia Watson. And yes as you’ve correctly deduced Julia is not actually my child. I rather thought the black hair was a bit of a giveaway myself but the brown eyes pretty much confirmed it, yeah.”
Even though he’d forgiven Sherlock by the time the wedding happened, it still didn’t change his wariness of the other man and if he was being honest with himself, it wasn’t until his best man speech that John had even stopped to consider that Sherlocks feelings might be a lot more complicated than John had given him credit for.
“Fine...I suppose there is no way of getting out of this conversation so I’m just gonna go ahead and say it.”
“But why would you even do this John? It’s obvious that you loved her enough to stay with her even after you found out the child wasn’t yours. Why have her arrested at this late stage?”
It was only the memory of that last day and the shame he still felt about what he’d done to his friend that stopped him.
“I don’t suppose you saw my phone when you popped home, I can’t think how I managed to forget it, really.”
“I’ll text you if I get held up, but I should be home by nine at the latest. And don’t forget to take the phone with you this time.” He added in a teasing manner.
He’d just slid the draw shut and was in the process of pocketing the keys, when the distinctive chime of Mary’s phone rang out indicating that she had a text.
He’d read until he got sleepy and hopefully when he went to bed he could actually fall asleep for a couple of hours before Julia woke up to be fed. He had a busy day ahead of him tomorrow and a fair amount of stuff to pack for his move to Harry’s , the last thing he should be doing is torturing himself with what if’s and might have beens.
For eight months he’d convinced himself that he had no right to want anything more; that he’d made his bed and the only thing he could do was to lie in it.
Like I said, I'm not used to writing in the Sherlock fandom so please understand that since I have other stories in other fandoms that I've been invested with, this may go slower than I would like. I will admit that I have several more chapters written but as I have no beta they won't get posted until I've proofread them and edited until I'm satisfied that they are the best I can get them without a beta's help.
He paused, seemingly lost in his memory of those times; the timbre of his voice deepening with his next words.
If he’d just been a better friend and less of a coward, both he and Sherlock would not be in the situation they were now in. If he’d put his hurt and pride aside sooner and actually talked to Sherlock about his actions on the roof of Bart’s, there would have been no marriage and no Mary to shoot Sherlock.
Laying alongside the man he loved John marvelled at the emotion he could see in the detectives eyes. Never in his life could he remember anyone looking at him the way Sherlock was.
Staring into his friends perplexed gaze it suddenly occurred to John that Sherlock actually did have the right to know the full truth. That John was being what Sherlock had once rightly accused him of being; an emotional coward.
John had been both infuriated and devastated by his friend’s harsh words and nearly speechless with rage at his insinuation that John’s willingness to share a flat with Sherlock; was only because he secretly wanted to bed the man.
Sherlock raised his stricken gaze to John’s, and for the first time since he’d set eyes on him in Barts lab all those years ago John was shocked to see pain and anguish barred, without any attempts to mask it.
Losing Sherlock was the hardest thing John had ever had to endure and it had taken until his relationship with Mary, for John to finally start to except that Sherlock was really gone.
He really wasn’t sure he could give a believable performance of the loving husband, not when his blood was still boiling over the text on her phone.
“John, I understand that you may find my feelings abhorrent, but I fail to see why you are being unnecessarily cruel. I did not think that you would welcome the news, but I had thought that you would be a little more understanding considering your family situation. I apologize if I have offended you. I can only promise that I will not inflict my presence upon you again after tonight, and since I so obviously disgust you, I can but assume you will be relieved to hear it.”
Sherlock’s tone and demeanor was not what one would expect to find in a man that had just been confronted with cuckolding one’s best friend.  The language was formal and stilted, but there was a layer of hurt acceptance that was very much out of context for the conversation that they were having.
When she’d told him about the apparent loss of her phone, he’d been sympathetic with just the right amount of annoyed at the expense that she’d expect. And then suitably apologetic when she in turn reminded him of the two times his phone had been destroyed; both while on cases with Sherlock.
His first thought was that Mary had somehow escaped custody and had made her way back to the flat. Even as unlikely as that was John still made sure to grab his gun before moving to answer the door.
Rewinding Sherlock’s part of the conversation in his head, John zeroed in on the other mans statement about John’s reactions to his feelings and he frowned with concerned realization.
“Because no matter what Sherlock or you may believe; I do want him to be happy. I may have fucked up my own life, but I never wanted to hurt him.”
Leaning up against a nearby tree John had tried to fight back the tears he could feel building; knowing that if he gave in now he would likely not stop. He had to get out of the park before Sherlock discovered him. He couldn’t possibly survive having Sherlock deduce the fact that he’d been spying on him and he definitely couldn’t bear to have Sherlock realize what his spying had wrought.
“Hey love, what a nice surprise. Everything all right with the little one?” he asked leaning down to kiss her on the cheek.
“Going back to Mary was the hardest thing I’d ever done, but I kept telling myself that it was the right thing to do for the baby’s sake. I knew that I didn’t love her, not like I was supposed to, but you kept saying that she was what I wanted and that eventually I’d forgive her.” He shot Sherlock a glare.
“I knew she wanted to get married and I knew that if I didn’t take that step then it was possible she’d find someone else that wanted those things, so I thought why not. It wasn’t like you were around to drag me on wild adventures; all that was over. So I brought a ring and nerved myself up to do it. Of course you came back before I had the chance and as angry as I still was with you, when Mary asked about the ring later I just went along with it.”
Sherlock Holmes was not a sentimental man and even though he had once proclaimed that sex did not alarm him, John had often wondered if Sherlock had ever had an encounter that involved anything more than casual flirting for a case.
His mind stuttered in disbelief, even as he recalled all the times Sherlock had defended Mary. The times they’d seemed extra chummy? The way Sherlock treated her far better than any other of John’s previous girlfriends. His determination to make sure that John didn’t leave her or the baby, even after she’d shot and nearly killed him.
Well something was obviously up. It wasn’t like Mrs Hudson to seem so cowed and there had been genuine concern in her eyes, though John wasn’t sure who it was for.
Now normally this would not be an issue; he would just borrow one of his colleague’s set of keys. Unfortunately for John, both of the other regular clinic doctors have called in sick and this is in fact the very reason he has agreed to a double shift in the first place.
“As far as he lets on he seems to be content, but Sherlock is hardly likely to fill me in on every aspect of his life. He is working and not using and that is sufficient as far as I’m concerned. Now I really must go... farewell Doctor Watson, I’ll let myself out”.
“Oh dear, he’s been in such a mood lately John, but I suppose It won’t hurt if you pop up for a quick visit. Just mind that I did warn you and come by before you leave, I’ve some lovely scones that are just about done and some of that blackberry jam that you like.” She patted his hand absentmindedly and with a last glance towards the upstairs flat she disappeared into her own.
Sherlocks eyes darkened with some emotion that John couldn’t begin to interpret, though the slight stiffening of his body told John that whatever it was that the other man was remembering, it wasn’t pleasant.
“By the time I realized what a cold bitch she was I knew I couldn’t just walk out. I couldn’t leave Julia with her and she’d made it crystal clear that all it would take was a DNA test to make sure I had no right to access. She might not be my baby but I couldn’t just leave her with Mary. And really what did it matter... you were gone and my fucked up situation was my own fault. So I decided to just get on with it yeah.”
Sherlock cleared his throat before answering; the obvious expression of nerves on his usually calm features going a long way to reassure John about his own worries.
“I suppose it was only a matter of time, but I had hoped that you would leave well enough alone.” The words were a low rasp that John barely caught, but John felt his stomach drop down to his shoes all the same.
“Yeah suppose I am a bit late. I got nearly the whole way here, and realized I’d forgotten the bloody keys to the drug cabinet. Had to turn around and go home to get them, and then got caught in rush hour of course.” He shook his head and tried to look annoyed rather than panicked.
“What the hell do you think you are playing at John?” demanded Sherlock his expression angrier than John could ever recall.
