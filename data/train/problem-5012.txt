He knew this would happen.
"Okay, what's that got to do with the case?"
I rolled my eyes and let Dean carry on.
He checked that Kelly was okay and stepped out of the car, ignoring that the radio had come back on.
He hadn’t even eaten a burger.
I could practically hear him thinking that he was confused.
I tried not to smirk at Dean and Cas on the list and thanked him and left.
Chuck huffed. "How do we know? Maybe they've just seen something on TV?"
"Mary. Please." Mary nodded and smiled at the pair.
"Yeah, why?"
“KIM!” He yelled, he was ignored.
Everyone had noticed it.
It had been years since Dean was this ill.
"I'm not hurt, I just didn't hear my phone until now. Are you okay?"
Seemingly so innocent.
"We might of even stayed here before." He chuckled. "Doesn't ring any bells."
Cas smiled softly and started eating his food.
"Cas? Can I ask you something?"
"That's it! I'm teaching you." I grabbed him by the shoulder, pulling him off the floor. "C'mon, it'll be fun."
She nodded her head and winked. "I got you."
Cas chuckled. "Can we go home now?"
"I do." Castiel's face was stoic but his voice wavered when Dean met his eyes.
Fiona nodded.
I grinned. "Well that's good, because I've got a case. So get this, two friends were staying in the Franklin Motel, from Missouri, only in Kansas for the weekend to visit some friends. The second night they stayed in the motel they were killed, no forced entry and no witnesses. Our thing for sure."
"How's being a dick gonna help?"
Mary had sat him down and told him everything, saying that Castiel should already know since he'd turned eighteen a few months before.
Dean was right, this was one of Cas' favorites on the tape.
"Yes, in August. Dean too?"
"Yeah." I nodded. "Let's go."
"The carpet is!" Dean pointed. "Am I winning?"
Cas still cared when all of his brothers and sisters left.
This was just an answer for Chuck.
“It has tree bark in it.”
"You said you didn't want me in your messages."
He only put this song on once Sam was asleep and it was just the two of them awake in the car, Dean knew Cas liked this song because Cas would catch him smiling when he saw Cas leaning his head back, listening to the song.
He nodded and blushed a little. "Do I need anything else?"
"Yes, Dean. Thank you."
Digging was going just as I'd hoped.
"Cas." Dean sighed.
"Cool." He hung up.
But clearly they weren't going to talk about it.
"I want you here, Cas. It's not that hard, man."
"I won't get an infection." Cas sighed.
John gave Dean a confused look and lifted Dean up into his arms as they started walking to the car. "What do you mean, huh?"
Cas had heard Dean shouting for him and Kim to go faster, he was hurting everywhere, he must have put something sharp and metal into his bag because it was striking his thigh with each stride.
I burst out laughing, clapping him on the shoulder as we went inside.
“You don’t have it anally, it’s orally.” Cas rolled his eyes as if
No one left.
"I ain't gay and neither is Cas. Ghost probably just got annoyed that we got rid of all the other future victims." Dean huffed.
“THIS IS INSANE, YOU’RE GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED.” Kim yelled again.
“Good, we’ll go around noon.” Dean clapped him on the back and started to exit the room.
"No way! You said I couldn't do that."
“Will you drink it?”
He nodded to himself and slowly released the clutch, somehow we managed to be going even slower than last time and I think Cas was getting self-concious over it by the way he kept glancing at the speed and sighing.
Almost.
"Your Dad, did he have anything that he treasured. Like a family heirloom, a ring, anything like that?"
Dean scoffed. "Coulda had me fooled."
Mary sighed. "Now."
He looked down to his angel, his Cas and sobbed.
I heard Sam laugh a 'jerk' and I glared at the wall, directing it to where I knew he was sitting.
I knew we had to ease ourselves back into hunting.
I smirked at this development.
"That couple. Killed by a ghost."
"Nerds." Dean mumbled.
Both of them scowled at me but Cas passed me his notepad and I passed him mine.
And being on the bike is pretty friggin' awesome.
Dean sighed down the phone and Cas heard a door shutting.
Dean hated that he practically saw Castiel doing the air quotes without even turning around.
"These aren't the most comfortable pants, Dean."
"Yeah, I lied." Dean was surprising himself at everything that was coming out, did Sam put a truth spell in his damn drink? "I just wanna be allowed to call you stuff like that so bad y'know?"
-Dean
"It's probably in our heads, Dean." Castiel shook his head. "It's a habit. That's what my Dad said. He said that we're just so used to being around each other that it's unfamiliar not to be."
"You're gunna break our san'castles!" He pouted.
He knew to never bring it up in an argument.
"You two are covered in dirt, I've got this." I pushed Cas and Dean towards our room whilst I headed to the police.
Then the letters started to get fewer and farther between.
Dean's face lit up. "You gotta call him Castiel, Mommy 'cos you're not his friend yet."
"I have to take care of Kelly."
He nodded and did what I said and he was off.
"Shut up, Sam." Cas scowled at me, blushing.
Pete followed me inside.
It was.Parked right next to Dorothy's bike.
Dean glared at the door which Cas would probably walk through if Dean even set a foot on the floor.
Dean groaned. “It was promising until you brought that out.”
"Sam said that you were upset-"
"Alright, whatever you need Castiel." I grinned, upping the game of who could make the other blush the hardest. "You wanna be on the back this time?"
“Something isn’t right today. I feel as if something is wrong, what is that?”
"It's beautiful."
"Scumbag. Cas looking for a pocket watch, okay?" Dean said. "Right, any clue on where it is?"
Graduation came and went with them not speaking to one another.
Cas and Dean had both gotten changed and showered. "What's happened?" They both asked.
It didn't matter what the fight was about and who was in the right.
“Oh God, Cas.” Dean stroked a hand through Cas’ messy hair, looking to the wings which were burned into the concrete, still hot with smoke rising up. “I'm so sorry.”
"You would have heard. I put you as my emergency contact so they would have told you first if-"
Cas pulled the t-shirt off him before it could rub off the paste.
“Get into the bed before I make you, feathers.” Dean tried to say menacingly but there must be something funky in the pink paste on his chest that made him sound like a drunk.
"I have no idea what's gotten into my son." Chuck groaned. "I didn't know what else to do."
It sounded great.
Not like it was in the movies with the gasps and the sudden realisation. All brought together with the perfect kiss with the fireworks behind the new found soulmates.
Cas smiled and lit the matches, throwing it into the grave.
He felt Cas climbing over him to sit beside him on the bed.
Dean understood it.
“Dean it will make you better.” Cas held out the glass.
Dean chuckled, feeling warm all over. "Yeah, it's the same kinda thing. But the only people that call each other that are people that are together. Or unless you're being sarcastic. Like how Crowley would always call me darling. Remember?"
-A teenage boy named Toby
"Oh Cas." Dean smiled weakly and threw his arms around Castiel's shoulders, not missing how he flinched but quickly relaxed into Dean's embrace. "This that we have ain't weird. It's just us. No one else will understand ‘cos it's ours."
Castiel did write every week telling Dean everything that he was doing very quickly and breifly but then going on to write detailed descriptions of all the new nature and bugs that he'd encountered, the languages he was picking up on and finally would be the longest part of the letters when Castiel would tell Dean how much he missed him and how he wished that Dean was with him.
Dean gave in. "I don't get it. Why'd you wanna go?"
He nodded and led me into his office.
"Right, 8 rooms, 6 if we don't include ours and the victims. I'll take rooms 3 and 4. Dean you take 10 and 13. Cas you get  15 and 23. Tell them whatever you need to, tell them to come back in the morning and get their stuff."
Dean jumped in then. "Fit okay, buddy?"
"Yeah, okay. Come to my room when you're home?"
It was Sam who caved first.
Dean wore his swimming shorts and Cas sat beside the bath.
"You need a hospital, Cas?" I asked as we sped off.
Dean didn't handle the next few months well at all.
. You gotta stop treating him like he's fragile. He's itching to leave as bad as we are."
"I don't think so. He said he was asleep when it happened, police knocked his door down. But he could of been lying about it, I don't know."
Dean might as well have been dead too.
"Oh, you said they would be big so I presumed that it would be okay." He started unbuttoning his shirt.
“And this will help your cough.” Cas held up a tub of pink paste.
He wished that Mary had never told him the truth.
"Will you two quit it for just five minutes?" I groaned.
"Do you think that-" Mary nodded towards the boys.
Castiel text Dean saying that he was home and Dean replied with 'good to hear' the next say.
Soon enough Dean was sulking when Castiel had to leave but was quickly soothed with the promise that he would be back soon and they'd be going to school together at the end of summer.
He looked up from the gravel to see Kim throw her angel blade beside him and then keep on running.
"Look good?" I grinned.
He tilted his head. "It's not a good idea to have me ride the bike."
She was more than happy to let Dean play with them whilst she supervised Sam experiencing sand for the first time and John promptly fell asleep in the sun.
Cas rolled his eyes. "I don't think that's appropriate."
-The five year old twin girls, Molly and Candy
“Shut up. What is in this?” Dean wrinkled his still burning nose, looking at the gloop in front of his face.
"Well that's because we've both been seeing colors forever right?"
"My Dad wouldn't of kicked me out if I were gay." I narrowed my eyes at him.
“No, i bought them.”
"You don't see me going off to war to get myself shot because I don't have a soulmate either. That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard, Cas."
Mary rolled her eyes and picked Sam up, ready to go over.
They both grinned and started to laugh together, Castiel's hand still on Dean's shoulder.
She didn't expect it to happen to her oldest son so young.
Dean pursed his lips, searching for a counter argument when he knew there was none before storming back upstairs to his room.
"Think the ghost is done for the night?" Dean yawned.
"I guess." Mary swallowed nervously and looked at the boys playing together.
"Hey Cas." Dean greeted, knowing that Cas had gotten into the habit of avoiding Dean back now.
"Oh very funny." I made sure to hit the helmet once I'd shoved it roughly on his smug little head, making him stumble.
Dean shot up from his nap and gasped at having Castiel stood in front of him.
He could patch things up with Sam and Dean.
I rolled my eyes. "Whatever, I'm gonna shower. Night."
They both shook their heads.
“DEAN!” He screamed, foolishly hoping Dean would be able to rescue him.
But he was home, Kelly would most likely be safe and the child.
"Stay with him." I ran across the room to grab the shotgun and shot at the ghost who was trying to get closer to Cas and Dean again. "Let's go. Now!" I yelled.
“Can I talk to you?” Cas nodded towards the bedroom door.
"She's killing people, I think that deserves being called a bitch."
I nodded. "Did the manager say anything to you?"
"Cas your damn elbow's in my ribs."
"Don't you even think about using your mojo." Dean warned through his teeth as he cleaned the wound, his other hand on Cas' shoulder firmly.
"Best few hours sleep I'd ever freaking had, Sammy."
Dean thrashed around in his slumber with that disturbing thought.
"That seems unusual." I scrunched my eyebrows.
Mary and John both chuckled.
It was just so
"If you two are done staring at each other we have a case to solve here." I sighed.
"We could just tell the truth?" Cas asked.
Both of them were twenty years old.
"I really wish you told me when you found out, Dean." Castiel leaned closer, his lips hovering over Dean's.
"Getting stir crazy in here man. Gotta shoot at something." Dean sighed, sipping his coffee.
I sighed. "You like the bike huh?"
Cas took the tape out of the player and turned it back to the start.
I took my hand off my gun and closed my eyes again, trying to get back to sleep.
"Morning sunshine." Dean ignored me and grinned at Cas who shuffled into the kitchen with a frown on his face and bad bedhead.
"It's usually a really attractive woman married to a successful guy, ba-Cas." Dean felt the blush rising to his cheeks, he prayed Sam would think it was the beer.
"Excuse me, sir?" I called his attention. "Are you the manager here?"
"So who is it?"
"I'm not having this fight." Dean interrupted again.
“We know the drill, Dean.” Kim rolled her eyes.
Dean and Cas were already in the backseat, Dean throwing the keys at me.
I got to the car first, sliding into the front seat.
"It could be. We need to find out how many other gay couples that are here and get them out. Now." Dean sighed. "What excuse can we think of?"
"My apologies,I didn't leave." He shrugged, barely glancing away.
"Should I not be?" He sped off, making be gasp and I know for a fact that the little shit heard me. Bastard.
"What against? I have my angel blade and I rarely need that when I'm driving."
"Partner? As in-"
"Let's go."
“Where from?”
“Cas. Castiel.” Dean cleared his throat. “I'm not sure if you can hear me but- I'm guessing you’re in Heaven now. Please come back. Cas. I'm- I'm so sorry. I need you. I can’t do this without you man. You were the only thing keeping me going. I need you back you feathery son of a bitch, please. I love you Cas, please come here or- or I'm gonna come to you.” Dean threatened and shut the shower off.
Chuck sighed. "It's not like we can keep them away from each other. But-"
And they could also switch churches again.
He was definitely like his son.
“C’mon Kim! Cas! Hurry up!” Dean yelled, powering ahead.
"Morning Sunshine." Dean forced a smile. "How many days have I got?"
“Yes.”
"Yes."
Cas felt his phone buzzing in his pocket, that was when he realised he'd zoned out for a good twenty minutes and the 11th track was about to play because Dean's voice was playing.
"We're sure. We'll go and give the manager a talking to in the morning, find out some stuff about his old man." Dean grinned. "You've done good today, Cas."
"I don't. I just forget them like a cool person." Dean smirked, obviously with no cases he'd been catching up on Brooklyn-99.
"It's a milk run, all we need to do is figure out who the ghost is, burn the bones. Done."
Dean was genuinely surprised once he got his clothes on, he felt miles better, his nose was still blocked and he was tired as hell but he didn’t think he would throw up anymore and Cas said that his temperature was normal now.
"Cas dammit, wake up."
I grinned proudly but I heard him call me from the bottom, I ran down presuming he'd fallen off again.
Dean scoffed. "Are you seriously asking if I'm gay?"
"Let's light this bitch up." Dean grinned and poured salt over her, handing his matches to Cas. "Go on buddy, first official salt and burn you get to do the honors."
Outside the bunker he listened to the last track, the one track he hadn't listed to the entire way back.
"So it's one of the cremated ghosts. Perfect." Dean groaned.
"Ah I see. When is the event?"
"Why not? You call me all kinds of the pet names. It's not the worst one you've called me."
I'd texted him, called him, yelled his name the whole nine yards.
He nodded. "Police have already questioned them though."
"Shut up, Cas." Dean groaned into the pillow.
Castiel shrugged. "Does that make you uncomfortable? Sorry, Dean. I'll just-"
"Let's try not to break Dorothy's bike huh?" I grabbed his arm and pulled him up then got the bike.
Castiel stuck out his tongue as he thought. "A bumble bee!"
"It's just me remember, you're doing great." I reminded him just before we got to the turn.
But Cas wouldn’t listen, and Sam, the little shit he left it to Cas to be Dean’s nurse while he took a vengeful spirit case a state over.
Chuck grimaced. "I-I think so, I can't be sure. I mentioned it to my wife but she's very religious. She'd never accept-"
“No, I am not putting that in my body Cas, you can shove it up your ass.”
Their eyes spoke before their mouths could.
Dean wanted to fly over there and drag him home himself and tell him everything.
That was when it was over.
He immediately glared. "I was not
I followed Pete to his room and entered with him.
"Yes I'm fine physically you ass. God Cas, I don't understand you sometimes. Do you want to be part of this family or not?"
We burned the bones over an hour ago.
Mary sighed and dragged Dean to the naughty step yet again, praying his yelling wouldn't wake up Sam from his nap.
He sighed.
"I don't show off."
"I'm gonna get some caffeine, keep practising." I clapped him on the shoulder and headed to the kitchen.
Sam tried to distract Dean but it didn't work, Dean just turned and headed back towards the car barely hearing Mary shouting at Chuck and Naomi for not telling Castiel the truth.
Chuck ignored Dean and turned to Castiel, his fingers crossing behind his back.
I ripped my arms from around his waist and grabbed the handlebars, only just managing to steer us away from the wall yet we still flew straight over the handlebars, Cas' body making a huge smacking sound as he hit the concrete and me landing straight on his leg.
I jumped up, my gun ready.
"I had an iron bar right beside the bed, I coulda just used that but I-I didn't think." Dean grit his teeth. "I could of got the son of a bitch before he hurt Cas. But I didn't." Dean sighed, hand over his face.
"You think that's why he hated gay people so much? Because his son was?" Cas asked, absentmindedly touching his head.
Dean heard Cas’ voice from a way off, he instantly turned around.
Pete nodded. "I was only 8 when he left, agent. I didn't know the real reason or anything. Dad hated him so much and I just never understood."
"Cas!" Dean shook him.
"He has a girlfriend now and they're living together. He's doing very well."
He prayed that Castiel didn't notice. Especially when he'd just invited him into his damn room.
"Why?"
"Tiny, really? He's barely shorter than you are."
, obviously.
"So what happened?" I asked.
"Shouldn't you know that, agent?"
They both headed back to the car.
I imagined Cas on it, he'd look hot.
"Oh, Hello Dean. Sam." Castiel came into the library, a surprised look on his face.
The journey was short and silent, everyone looking out for Croats.
"Me too." Dean whispered, closing the distance between their lips.
Not at all.
"Good morning, Dean. Sam." Cas mumbled, taking his seat beside Dean and taking the coffee mug he knew must be his.
"The girls in room 19. They heard the guys shouting or something and called the police."
I shook my head. "We stop this kind of thing from happening. Did your Dad have anything like that?"
"We need to start. Dammit Cas, you're fucking imortant to me, I need you to be here."
"You needed to say something cool, Cas." Dean sighed.
Mary led them into the kitchen, Chuck put Castiel down on his feet but Castiel quickly flopped onto the floor and carried on his shouting even though clearly Chuck was trying to ignore him.
“See you up there.” Dean whispered and set the gun in his mouth.
Best friends.
Both men sighed and sat opposite each other, they were in the bunker, one of the last safe houses for survivors;
"It's my day off. Just use your arms."
“Last chance to come back to me, feathers.” Dean shouted as he walked to Cas’ body.
"Excuse me." I slipped out and headed into our room.
I clapped him on the shoulder as I headed to the bathroom to change into my FBI threads.
“If you’re not better I’ll go to the drugstore.”
"You need to tell him, Dean."
"Whenever I try to explain you don't listen and say I'm wrong."
“EVERYONE OUT!” Dean called once the shots were getting too frequent; he grabbed both Cas’ arm and Toby’s arm.
Sam rolled his eyes at the right times.
Dean barked a laugh. "Yeah, Cas. That's alright." He grinned.
The youngest soulmate meet up they'd ever known was when Bobby Singer met his soulmate at the tender age of twelve.
But on the lead up to graduation things were strained between the pair.
They were joined at the hip and everyone knew it.
"How would you even know?" Dean argued, trying to get what looked like a plaster on Cas' temple.
The case was only a couple of towns over too. Barely an hour away from us.
"Dean, you said that you have to hold on tight."
Dean nodded and opened his eyes, lifting his head slightly.
"We'll see." Mary nodded, not looking at Dean or John.
"Has Castiel said anything about colors recently?" Mary led them both into the living room.
"Then why is one bed untouched and the other one was clearly being used."
"Castiel, what is the same color as Dean's eyes?"
"Yeah. She doesn't know for sure but she said that she's ninety nine percent sure. I think that she's right too."
"Of course." Castiel nodded, his eyes going to Dean's.
After five minutes Sam hesitantly opened Dean's bedroom door.
"Put your hands on the handlebars, Feathers." I teased, guiding his hands since he didn't show any sign that he was going to move. "If you need to stop, here's the brake. Do that slow or you'll go flying. No pun intended."
"Will you just trust me on this, dammit!" It was Dean's voice.
"Dean, come back here please." She called.
"How come?" Sam sat himself on Dean's bed, noticing Castiel's stuff still neatly on the floor by Dean's bag.
I headed out of the room and went next door, knocking.
Pete reached for a half drank bottle of whiskey.
It all started on a sunny afternoon.
Cas came out of the bathroom dressed in Dean's old pj's looking annoyed.
Cas touched Dean's face on the photograph, not meaning to, calling Dean.
"You promised we go to the beach!" Castiel screeched, kicking his feet at Chuck's shins.
Get ready for some shameless flirting and obvious blushing from these two idjits
Mary didn't know how they kept track, she certainly couldn't.
They lay in silence, just enjoying each others company that they had missed.
He heard Castiel catching the door and following him upstairs with a deep frown.
"Alright alright, here." I took his hand and put it in the right place. "You need to hold tight and when you wanna go, slowly release. Real slow okay?"
"I'm trying to do an investigation here guys, mind keeping it down?" I scowled at them the most I could whilst keeping in FBI mode.
Dean groaned but winced when it sparked a new wave of the migraine.
Dean had never been sick whilst Cas had known him and he wasn’t a medical professional.
Sam was cooking what looked to be a midnight snack.
"I'm sure we can set up for Cas to come play sometime soon, sweetheart." Mary smiled.
"How about you tell him yourself? I'm not Dr Phil."
He woke up feeling empty.
"So, Franklin jnr was kicked out when he was fourteen for coming out as gay."
Everyone obeyed, Kim missed each shot.
"Drive." He ordered. "Cas, you okay, man? Talk to me."
"Yeah, actually I would. I've known you forever. You don't want this."
I walked past Dean's room, the door open.
Mary smiled whilst Chuck looked uneasy.
Cas sighed again I could almost hear him rolling his eyes but neither of them moved.
All over the walls and carpet, bloody footprints to the door then a bigger pool of blood.
I called Dean.
Dean shook his head. "I can see better now, Daddy."
Castiel stopped caring in the exact moment that Dean Winchester stopped caring.
He probably could get up and walk around the bunker; he didn’t need to be in bed. If Cas would ever let him get up.
"See you soon, ba-buddy." Dean hung up quickly, his cheeks burning.
I laughed. "Yeah, that's fair."
But he didn't.
"He will." I agreed. "Dean, you're being a little over bearing. Let's just get coffee, Cas is fine."
Mary remembered the first time that she saw colors.
“Okay” Dean chuckled.
"See you in Hell, bitch." Cas looked to Dean for the approval.
"Yes."
"Wanted to see if you wanted a few beers?" Sam shrugged. "Cas isn't home yet so you-"
"Sammy get the shotgun." Dean yelled. "Cas! Fucking wake up. SAM HIS HEADS BLEEDING!"
“Fine.” Dean started sitting up. "If you tell Sam then you're sleeping in the dungeon forever, and I won't bring you coffee."
"Sure." I grinned, It wasn't fun having to deal with a grumpy Cas in the morning anyway, never mind grumpy morning Cas who'd slept funny on a sofa.
Dean had turned to ignoring Castiel which was always a good way to get Castiel more riled up.
"You've got plenty of friends on our street, Dean. You can play out whilst your Mom cooks dinner tonight." John ruffled his sons hair.
“What is it?” Dean’s jaw was set.
"Busy for this time of year huh?" I asked.
"Well it was coming after Cas and you. I saw it trying to go for you as well."
He got into the impala and drove to Cas, with the trench coat in tow.
“Just don’t release my inner demons by cutting a hole in my skull.”
They had burned into his leg where Cas’ shoulder had been.
Dean pouted but pulled Castiel into a hug which Castiel returned with a surprised look on his face.
"Too tight?"
He did hear that Castiel would be leaving soon, news travelled fast in the small town.
- A woman named Joan
Dean parked the car just under a mile away from the store to avoid making too much noise.
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"I'm not a child, Dean." Castiel huffed, folding his arms.
I knew Cas was somewhere in the bunker.
"It's under my bed."
"What?"
"I turned really quickly, Dean!"
The ghost turned up again, I saw Dean shove himself in front of Cas as the ghost of Franklin Moone lit up the parking lot in broad daylight.
I headed to the diner, trying to ignore Dean fussing over Cas and Cas trying to get him to leave him alone.
"He doesn't like being mothered, though. He can take care of himself, if he needs help then he'll ask for it."
Dean crawled into bed and almost moaned at the memory foam.
Mary had jumped into action and shoved a startled John Winchester off her and back towards the man that he appeared to be in a fist fight with, finished her drink quickly and headed out of the bar to see if outside had more interesting colors to lay her eyes on.
"Yeah I guess so." I gave Dean a hand up who then pulled Cas up too.
"You could say that." Dean muttered, following her to a booth.
Dean broke into a grin. "He's one of us, if he needs help he will never ask for it."
"Sounds good." I hung up.
Pete sighed big but turned to me. "They came here two days ago. Larry Michaels and Calvin Thomas. They asked for a room for a couple nights, paid in cash. They were fine the first night but in the morning they complained their room was cold, I told them I'd get someone out to look at it, but I went in and the room was fine. The A/C working fine, I figured they'd just want a refund or something so I told them they weren't gonna get any money out of me, they got what they paid for. Then around two in the morning I get banging on my door and the police are there, telling me I need to answer some questions and two of my guests were found dead."
“It’s a healing…”
"So it's a suicide mission then?" Dean snapped, shoving Castiel off his bed and standing up, his arms shaking.
"So?" Dean asked, getting back in the car, seeming to trust Cas being alone in the backseat now.
There was a small explosion that seemed to come from Cas’ shoulder and Dean thought for a second that he had Cas back with him. But the lifeless body remained; only now Dean felt fire on his thigh.
"It looks stupid."
“Your temperature is 40, you are sick. The side effects to the drug store medicines are worse than the actual illness.”
I snickered again but held tighter, relishing in how his breathing quickened.
"That was....nice?" He struggled for words.
He instantly looked right in my eye.
John grimaced. "You shouldn't meet your soulmate that young. Maybe it was a fluke. You've had girlfriends before. Just do that again. Have a normal life."
Cas nodded. "The police did say they suspected the two men were in a relationship but until they contact the families they can't say anything."
I shrugged him off. "It's fine, man. We'll probably have this under control and be home in time for bed anyway."
One of them kicking Castiel on their way past, this time Castiel couldn't steady himself and toppled over in the sand.
"You can let go now." I eased myself off the bike.
Once we got back to the bunker we were all in desperate need of a nap.
"My friend is gone away now." Dean sniffed.
"Bitch." I muttered and slammed out of the library to Cas' room.
Most people had probably gone to the bigger and better beach a few miles down the road.
Sam was beside him gurgling and wriggling his toes in his new sandals specially bought for beach days.
“WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!” Dean spluttered.
"Yeah, you don't say. Cas says that the manager was lying about something, you get that vibe too?"
"Yeah. Dean what are you-"
Chuck shrugged. "I guess we'll be seeing a lot more of each other."
“If you make me drink that again, we’re getting a divorce.” Dean reached for the water at the bedside table.
"FBI, What's going on officer?" I asked as I flashed my badge.
whilst they were having breakfast in a diner. But he'd covered himself up with a coughing fit quickly. No one had caught on to what he had almost done but ever since then it had become almost impossible to not call Castiel something similar.
Castiel shook his head. "Once Sam said it wasn't an insult I liked it."
Cas almost sighed in relief when he felt her hand in his, no one will die today. He could make out the car in the distance. They would be there in little over a minute.
"All the motels?" I raised my eyebrows.
"Refusing to give the two vics a single room because of their 'lifestyle choice' as he said. Seemed real bugged out by you and Cas too when you were arguing, I think he thought that-"
"Like he's gonna know that." John snorted. "He's five, Mary. We've got at least ten years before we gotta worry about teaching him colors."
Cas put the phone back into his pocket and sat inside the truck.
The guy turned to me with a grim look on his face. "Some girl called about twenty minutes ago saying something was in the room trying to kill her and her partner. We came as fast as we could but the doors bolted and no ones answering us shouting." He sighed. "Think the guy who got the other two is still in there."
"Move your ribs then."
"Our other stuff is in the motel." I shrugged and gave him the first aid kit too. "How you feeling, Cas?" I asked.
"Is that alright?" Castiel asked.
Cas reached for his angel blade but there were too many croats piling on him.
Chuck's fingers uncrossed behind his back, his face falling.
"Pete, do you mind if we go somewhere more private?" I raised my eyebrows.
"I asked around church for your address." Chuck admitted. "He's been like this since the beach day last week."
I sighed. "One of them hadn't slept in the two days they were here? They were sharing? Why didn't you just give them a single room?"
She knew that John was right.
I headed to the front desk and found Pete there looking worse for wear.
"I didn't-" Dean tried but seeing Sam laughing and Castiel's scowl made it worse. "I didn't mean it like that-I just- oh Sam shut up." Dean stood up and stormed out of the room, hearing Sam try and explain through laughs that Dean wasn't calling him an actual baby as an insult.
"Are we thinking Danny? Overdose is a harsh way to go." Dean pursed his lips.
John and Mary preferred the peace and quiet of the smaller beach though.
"John says we shouldn't tell them until they're eighteen." Mary interrupted what she knew would be Chuck repeating what John had already said.
He nodded. "Don't you need all of this?" He gestured to himself.
His final moments would be looking at his best friend, Dean Winchester. The man he’d given everything for. The man he loved. Then again the man he loved was in pain, hurting and crying over him and Cas couldn’t do anything to comfort him, he could barely move.
"But when I checked it was fine."
"Yeah, I think we're definitely dealing with a ghost. The couple complained about their room being real cold on the first night."
"Hey screw you, agent." He growled. "I did what I did to protect my family. But after that I swear this place is cursed. People just keep dying here, it's always the gays too. I try and give them rooms with separate beds so they get the message they ain't welcome. Sometimes they leave because they don't wanna give me money but the one's that stay end up dead."
Never.
"It's not your fault, Dean." I sighed.
Two friends had been visiting friends and were staying at a motel and were killed with locked doors and windows, no sign of forced entry. A mysterious black liquid in the room.
He looked down. "No."
How domestic.
I rolled my eyes, I obviously wasn't going to get through to him. "You ever been on one of these?"
"Yes he does." Dean argued.
Cas wasn't in his room, his freaking phone was though.
I shrugged. "They do all merge into one gross motel."
"Think about it rationally." John snapped. "Dean's five. That kid looks around the same age. They won't remember this. They're probably gonna figure it out when they're older. I'm not having my son grow up with the stigma already fucking attached."
"How many fingers am I holding up?"
I sighed but let him carry on.
"Practise makes perfect, Cas. Get on."
"That's great." I smiled and followed him across the lot to room 18.
How could he?
"Right, do you mind taking me to the room so I can have a look around?"
Dean intensified his glare at the door before he was overcome with a coughing fit.
I caught it. "Why would I need to sleep on the couch?"
Man, I need to grow a pair and just tell him.
Cas was sat on a bed glaring at Dean.
They could vent their frustrations out on digging six feet into the ground whilst I would sip a beer and shine a torch down there.
Cas slid in the booth beside Dean and drank the coffee as soon as it was set down in front of him.
Trying to get up was hard.
“I’ve already told you, the chemicals they tell you about are bad enough and the ones they don’t tell you about are even worse!”
Dean hadn't heard from Castiel in three months and was a mess.
"Dean I did it!"
"Same here. Dean's never really been one for tantrums. We leave that to his father." Mary joked.
"Under the bed, Dean."
Dean blushed. "That sofa was killing me, man. Not like I can share with you and those arms."
"Wiggle a bit."
But Castiel didn't go to see Dean either.
"You don't have the excuse of a sofa here, Dean." I smirked, spotting Cas under the covers, tucked into Dean's side.
It scared him that he’d meant it. But without Cas, he had no one.
-A man named Bill
"He was a good man, Agent. Why are you asking?"
Maybe Cas was right, all that was left to do was sleep it off.
He'd called Sam many things over the years but the one that had always stuck was simply,
Only one person did that.
“Just a little, please.” Cas bit his lip and Dean instantly felt bad, Cas was trying his best.
"Like what?"
It was killing him.
Castiel never really complained about any of them apart from a scowl every now and then, Dean thought it was all fine.
Dean closed the gap as he pressed his lips to Castiel's.
"Cut him some slack, Dean. He's trying his best."
"But-"Cas started.
"No. It's not that, Dean." Castiel muttered, shaking his head.
"What is it? D'you not give a shit about me anymore?" Dean demanded.
My eyes adjusted and I saw an old man in the corner of the room with a huge steak knife.
"Right. So why not just refuse service?
"So it's her." Dean grinned. "Let's get our dig on."
He nodded.
"I don't!" He lurched forward, a quarter way down the tunnel and flew off into one of the walls.
Cas turned and saw Kim starting to lag behind and the croats were catching them up, he reached a hand behind himself for her to grab and pull herself forwards.
Dean glared at his phone but put it down. "Cas hasn't annoyed me. Tell him that he's looking into things too much."
"Kinda question is that?" He raised his eyebrows.
"Good, all you need now is a helmet and a handsome teacher."
"Look, my Dad. He wasn't the kindest guy in the world. But he was my Dad. You understand that right?"
"Cas, how many times?" Dean groaned. Humans lie. We need to lie."
Cas nodded and scrunched his face when the disinfectant burned, Dean rubbed his shoulder. "Sorry, man."
John frowned. "I ain't having this argument again. You know how I feel about it all. I also know that kid very well he's pretty much been raised here. He's as stubborn as they come. You ain't gonna change his mind on going into the army, son. You just ain't."
Dean gave Mary a look that was sweet as pie whilst Castiel gave his father an apologetic look, they took each others hands and ran to the living room.
He was pretty sure some normal medicine would have sorted him out in 24 hours.
Sam had text him 3 times.
"Yeah, Dean. Like a couple." I rolled my eyes. "Manager seemed real mad about it too, refused to give them a single room that's why everyones assuming they were friends because it was a twin room."
But when they didn't bump into the Novak's Dean would act out by throwing tantrums in the grocery store, throwing his toys when they got home, drawing on the walls in his bedroom, screaming at his teachers at day care.
"That's not helpful." Cas huffed at Dean and scanned my notes. "So the women in the room next door are also in a relationship?"
"If he knew he wouldn't be going to get himself blown up." Dean argued.
Cas arrived next, his hair tamed and he seemed like he was in a better mood.
They both nodded.
Mary heard a child like scream from the other side of the door, opening it to see a very exhausted looking Chuck Novak with Castiel lay by his feet screaming at the top of his lungs, feet stamping on the floor.
I rolled my eyes. "Dean, Cas is
Cas took the tape out and swapped the tape for his bunker key in his pocket.
-A woman named Kim
The other grinned and pushed Castiel roughly.
"Found him, in the garage." I shrugged, getting our biggest mug.
Cas nodded and began to stand up, only to be pulled back down by Dean, their lips meeting and their eyes closing as they moved together.
“Not on my watch. EVERYONE BACK!” Dean dropped his back and began running towards the pile of croats.
"Sounds pretty cut and dry. Talk to the witnesses next door, we'll regroup once we're done here. Meet at the diner we passed about a five minute walk up from the motel?"
"I'm sorry." Castiel's voice was shaky as he refused to meet Dean's eyes.
Chuck nodded and accepted the coffee that Mary silently offered.
"It's because we were so young that we don't remember the colors changing. But think about how much it hurts when we're apart. You're friends with Charlie, does it feel like that when you're not with her?"
Castiel was gone and for all Dean knew, Castiel could be dead.
"Ready?"
"Oh God." I sighed.
"So you're saying-" Castiel's eyes were wide, staring at Dean.
"I can't do it, Mom. It'll just push him away more. I know how he thinks. He'll hate me."
"He won't believe me. He knows how desperate I am to keep him here. He knows I'd say anything."
"Y'know how we don't have soulmates?"
"Whatever. I'm taking the sofa by the way."
"Today and tomorrow." Castiel bit his lip, looking down.
"You want me to come?" Cas asked, narrowing his eyes at Dean.
"Shut your face. I'm teaching him how to ride Dorothy's bike."
"Yeah." I nodded. I knew how he felt, like Dean was babysitting him. It was more annoying than he was letting it on to be but I knew even if I spoke to Dean about it he wouldn't let up.
Every few minutes Dean would ask if he could see him.
I chuckled. "Believe me, I know. The best way to get him to quit it is to carry on doing your thing, he'll let up soon. It took me years until he'd even consider letting me go on a hunt alone."
"I just didn't want to upset you." Castiel started. "Sorry I thought you were being unkind, Sam explained it to me. It's a 'pet name' he said."
Dean made sure that Toby was in front of him, but Cas was too far behind for his liking, he kept looking back to check he was still there. Cas was behind Timothy but ahead of Kim, Dean knew that Cas could run faster than any of them but Cas had all of the heavy items in his bag and it was weighing him down.
“What’s next, Doc?” Dean smirked.
Cas nodded. "Alright, Sam."
"Cas?" Dean's heart felt like it was going to jump out of his chest.
Mary nodded. "It's the only thing that explains the tantrums and how they're both suddenly into colors. Dean never mentioned anything like it before."
"Cas' eyes are the like the sky." Dean nodded excitedly. "And your jeans too, Mommy."
"Okay, so I was thinking that I speak to the manager of here since he only saw you and Dean. Ask him a few questions. You and Dean can go to the morgue and check the bodies and speak to the police. Sound good?"
It was such a stark difference from his voice on the phone call that someone who didn't know Dean might think it were two different people.
Cas decided, letting himself relax into Dean stroking his arm soothingly.
Dean nodded. "I asked him what room the friends were staying in, it was next door. Number 18. They were two guys, he seemed really uptight when I was asking though. Didn't wanna tell me much, only that we were safe and the police had a lead so we would be completely fine here."
“I got special bath salts.”
“Dean, she’s dead.” Timothy said softly, as Dean reloaded his gun. “We need to go.”
I gave the waitress a smile and an eye roll.
Dean stood there like a statue listening to Castiel stomp down the stairs and slam the front door, from the corner on his eye he could see Castiel through the window storming up the street with his brightly colored socks standing out.
Fifteen minutes later John Winchester had come outside wiping blood from his lip with a cocky smirk.
Dean closed his eyes and sighed in defeat.
The waitress giggled, clearly trying to flirt with Dean.
"Okay, how do I make it go?"
“This will help your temperature.” He held up a small wet cloth.
He knew it would.
I called Dean.
Well, that's when Mary was taught about soulmates anyway.
He nodded. "Was my Dad's place before he passed it to me."
"So you think we have a homophobic ghost?" Dean asked, sipping his beer.
"This is yours?"
"Sure, it's not been cleaned yet. My cleaning lady doesn't start for another hour."
Dean made Castiel swear to write to him every week and call whenever he could.
Dean did a victory grin at Sam. "Suck it, Sam. Cas is on my side, isn't that right, baby?"
“RUN. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. NOW! GO!” Dean yelled and set off running, shooting wildly.
Cas spent another three songs outside of the car, staring at Dean's contact on his phone.
“It’s been proven to help, Dean.”
And she would have hoped that she handled it much better than she did.
“Ingredients that the Aztecs used, it will make you better in an hour.”
He nodded and sat back on the bike, I followed suit and wrapped my arms around his waist.
"Ah." I nodded and pulled my badge out. "Agent Perth, FBI. I'd like to ask you a few questions about last night."
He needed Castiel to be back home.
I fought the urge to roll my eyes.
"I'll take the couch." Cas mumbled, heading to the bathroom to get dressed.
Dean heard Cas shutting the door then taking off his shoes and carefully placing them beside his bag like usual.
The beer did help his nerves on what he would speak to Castiel about, he couldn't just carry on ignoring him now but he couldn't say his speech in front of Sam. It was ruined.
Dean beamed and threw his arm around Cas' shoulder.
Cas moved his hand holding the weird drink closer.
"I've always wanted to. You know that." Cas sighed, sick of explaining.
"Alright wise guy, let's see how you do on the road."
"You're not FBI?"
It must be the alcohol so early.
"You landed, with your hand like that on me. But we were at the beach, we didn't have shirts on. After that happened apparently me and you were really happy, talking about colors all the damn time and throwing tantrums whenever we were apart-"
"Who called the police?"
"To find you some gear first."
"Yeah. By one of them too, looks like we just missed the sicko who did this."
"Always am." Dean teased.
It made Cas even more guilty.
"I'm fine." He shrugged him off.
Castiel gave him a small smile which made his chest warm up. "Yes, he asked how you were, Dean."
"Looks like we didn't burn that bitch in time, huh?" Dean sighed and Cas looked down angrily.
"I don't mind." Castiel grinned, leaning closer.
Mary nodded, it wasn't like they bumped into the Novak's that often.
He and a few of the younger Novak boys were all burying each others legs in the sand, laughing and shouting to one another.
She'd spent the last five years imagining Dean's entire future.
I made quick work of getting my couples out, they seemed to already be packing up and getting ready to go anyway.
He'd played that tape exactly 37 times since Dean had given it to him.
“A little shop in the Himalayas.”
But still that didn't stop Dean from spewing more and more names for the guy.
"Six months Cas!" Dean shouted, making Castiel jump. "And the last few letters were lousy. Pretty much the exact same as each other."
"Don't tell anyone we were here." I warned and headed back to our room to grab our bags.
There was a lot of blood.
I thought a simple Salt'n'Burn would be good enough.
"You're an adult Cas, you can do what you want." Dean argued.
Three more bangs, a cry of pain from Dean and yelps of horror from Toby and Timothy.
“One of those days, Cas. Remember I told you about them, you’ve had them before.”
"No."
Castiel nodded, a blush on his cheeks.
"No, just make some room, dumbass."
“Fine, but you’re acting like I’m on my damn death bed. It’s the flu, Cas.” He muttered half angrily.
The most common of them all being a simple,
"What?" I turned to him.
I sighed. "Yeah, but he just seems like a real scumbag guy, could be anything."
Dean huffed at being alone outside with Castiel but marched his way to his front door and slammed it shut behind him, carrying on his pace to his bedroom.
He’d been in bed for two entire days now.
"Sounds good." Dean stood up and followed Sam to the library where there were two six packs of beers.
"That's not fair."
"I missed you terribly." Castiel admitted.
Dean wanted to apologise but every time he was ready to he would just remember that Castiel was going to get shot at soon he'd get angry all over again.
Nobody did.
"Cas, you need to go to bed man." Dean sighed, a hand on Cas' shoulder.
"What happened?"
Chuck gulped.
Cas tried to hide his smile at winning, he lifted Dean’s t-shirt until his chest was exposed and started rubbing the pink paste onto his skin.
Mary laughed along at some of Dean's bad attempts at the words in the songs, five year olds typically have a hard time saying "threshing oar".
He'd almost slipped up a few times and almost called Castiel
I walked slower than usual to make it seem that he was going faster, I reached the top a few seconds after him and he had an uncharacteristic grin plastered on his face.
Birthdays, weddings, christenings, funerals, driving lessons, new babies, family arguments, heartbreaks, girlfriends, secret boyfriends, drinking, prank wars, vacations.
"He used to own this place before he died. Passed it onto his son, Pete. And Pete's a giant dick when it comes to gay people, can only assume that he learnt that from his Dad." I sighed.
Dean's voice filled his ears.
Mainly because I had turned the GPS on his phone on. Plus I'd yelled at him enough about randomly leaving mid conversation or without telling anyone. He was making an effort to at least tell me when he left, but that usually consisted of him saying goodbye and then leaving before I had even processed that he was going somewhere. Freaking angels.
"You've gotta have protection, Cas." I explained.
"Which means that you do have a soulmate but you met them too young to realise?" Castiel raised his eyebrows.
Cas narrowed his eyes at the journal. "I just want to make sure."
"How many fingers am I holding up?"I smirked at him.
Dean held his hand up.
“Don’t you trust me?”
He nodded and 'sped' off again.
"You do realise lying to me is a felony, right?"
Pete sighed. "Frankie wasn't right, okay. He-He was sick. Dad said he was sick."
Mary knew of the Novak family from switching churches after her and John were married.
"No, take off your clothes first, then put them on."
Almost no one that she knew had a cute moment of meeting their soulmates like the movies.
In fact he'd look really hot.
"Right. Do you know why I called it you?"
"Nice threads, Cas." I grinned.
Dean sighed and got dressed, ignoring that it was 5am.
"Do you want me to sleep on it?"
Dean refused to go to the doctors for something as silly as ‘being a wanted serial killer by the FBI’ so Cas had to do his research.
Cas coughed, blood leaking from his mouth. Scratches were all over him, bites, forming bruises and cuts which were faintly glowing blue.
"You can go back and play now, boys." Mary smiled wryly and turned to Chuck. "What do you want to do?"
“No, I ain’t drinking that. It’s disgusting.”
Chuck sighed. "Hello. I'm Chuck Novak. Please can we organise a play date before I leave him outside the church."
"Then what is it?" Dean yelled.
Cas wrapped his arms around me so loose that I could barely feel it. "Tighter Cas, don't want you falling off."
All of the pain and suffering.
“I’m not having it.”
"Oh God, are they dead too?"
"We weren't cuddling." Dean growled defensively.
"Really Sam?" Dean scoffed at the sneakers I gave him.
Castiel shook his head. "You know my first memory is when we had that sleepover after our first day in kindergarten. There were colors then."
"They're all booked up."
“DEAN WHAT DO WE DO?” Kim screamed, shooting the croat that almost bit Timothy’s neck.
Dean was able to get an hour or so of shut eye before Cas was back, looking confident.
Dean came into the kitchen then pouring himself a cup of coffee and then one for Cas bringing them both to the table and sitting down.
Cas smiled weakly and headed to the sofa until Dean turned him around. "I'll take the couch, you get some rest."
Cas pulled the covers back and made the bed neatly whilst he waited for Dean to get out of the bathroom.
"Yeah, it's me. Scoot over that sofa is killing my back." Dean whispered.
We practised for another hour or two but at that point I needed coffee or beer, or something just to keep my eyes open.
"That wasn't a question." Castiel tilted his head. "But I understand, Dean. It's okay."
Oh, it was Dean.
A sort of yelp escaped Dean’s mouth as he noticed he was tracing the lines.
“I don’t care, it doesn’t have a label. You are not rubbing anything on my chest if it doesn’t have a label.”
"Slowly release Cas."
He'd go to racist groups. Protest at pride all over the country. Protest abortion clinics.
"Dammit Cas, where are you?" I muttered.
“Oh Cas.” Dean lay beside the corpse, stroking the dead man’s cheek.
Dean groaned. "Just move it."
“Nothing you will have a reaction to. I swear.”
"We're soulmates, Cas." Dean smiled.
"Yeah." Dean answered, his voice cracking. Surprisingly it was Sam. "What?"
"Listen to me, you're gonna come home and we're gonna sort this out. Family doesn't just leave, they sort it out."
Two years since they'd been in the same room.
She had come clean on his eighteenth birthday, whilst Castiel was busy with John and Sam putting a bow on the impala.
I saw a figure above Cas' bed. I slid my hand underneath my pillow for my gun.
"Who won?" Dean asked. "I wanna rematch!"
He hugged it close to his chest but couldn’t cry anymore.
He was exactly as he’s left him.
Cas almost didn't open Dean's messages after Sam's first text but Dean would yell at him for reading them or for ignoring them so he might as well.
Castiel nodded, wiping his eyes before he lay himself beside Dean.
Everyone in his life had been given at least one nickname, or even just a pet name.
When I came back out Cas sat cross legged on the bed, sipping coffee as Dean flicked through his phone on the opposite end.
God, if Sam walks in now.
"He's my soulmate, Dad. You expect me to just never have one?" Dean argued.
'On my way' I text Dean quickly and slipped out of the room in case Pete was watching.
But he couldn't do it.
He screamed, not at the burning of his thigh but at the hole that had been punched through his ribcage.
"Vamps? I don't think it's related, Cas."
"Pete."
"It's okay." Castiel opened his arms.
But it didn't work.
“Dean.” He croaked.
“How long do i have to stay in here? Until I go wrinkly?”
Dean shrugged.
This was the best he could do.
Cas still had that confused look on his face. “Okay, I’ll go and find something else.”
Dean shrugged away, hanging his head. "I wanna play with Cas."
Croats.
Dean and Cas were bickering in the booth when I arrived.
The tape Dean had gotten for him was a huge weight in his pocket, pulling the left side of his body down.
Cas felt guilt seeping into his gut.
"Uh-huh. So you spending most of the time in your room and Cas looking like he wants to cry all the time is just a coincidence huh?"
Sure a cold here and there, the smiting sickness didn’t really count.
"Yeah, I got that vibe from him. Sorry you had to deal with that, why not just go to a different motel?" I asked.
"I don't know Sam! I just did it!" Dean snapped, plugging in the headphones.
The entire town knew that you couldn't have one without the other.
Castiel promised that he'd do his best.
I shrugged. "Could be nothing, but could be something worth looking into. It was the room next door that called the police when they heard yelling from the room. Real thin walls here."
"Fine." Dean huffed and parked up, stalking into our room and getting changed into his jeans and flannel.
Cas glanced in the mirror at Kelly.
“How was I supposed to know you’re allergic to cats? You should have told me when I asked.”
“It’s medicine.” Cas ignored the massive drop of the ‘medicine’ on his face and tried bringing the glass to Dean’s mouth again.
"Sorry for intruding on you, I'll be as fast as I can." I headed to the table and sat down, I instantly noticed that only one of the beds looked used. "How many nights have you been here?"
"Where did you see him last?" Sam asked, barely looking up from his laptop.
He quickly did a U-turn and pressed play, back to the start.
He started to drink in excess, gambling.
"That's not what serving your country is, boy." John grumbled, entering the living room. "You shouldn't have told him, Mary. Chuck did right by his son and didn't let him get into this mess."
He hadn’t had a drop of alcohol.
Dean opened the door to let Cas inside. They both sat on the bed, side by side.
When he woke up his nose was a little blocked but Cas didn’t need to know that.
"Sure you don't wanna kiss him goodnight?" I teased.
"Could just be wrong place wrong time. Might not have anything to do with that." I shrugged. "But I've dragged up the death records for the town for the last fifty years. Twenty people have died at that motel."
They were both sat across from each other, both wearing Dean's cowboy hats and playing with the green army men making gun noises at one another.
"Morning." He grumbled.
"I do." John grit his teeth. "And I know you do too. It'll be better this way. We can tell him when he's older."
I stared more at him than the quick turn that he did, he was so focussed.
He could hear Sam trying to hide his laughing behind his hand. Dean shifted awkwardly in his seat, reaching for his beer and taking a few mouthfuls, trying to forget what had just happened but each second of nothing but Sam's muffled laughing made it worse.
I smirked as I came back up, Cas had barely moved but he had a soft blush on his cheeks that were even obvious through the visor.
"Last night was the first night." Another woman came through from the bathroom. "Coffee?"
"DEAN!" He panicked and let go of the handlebars, trying to reach back for me instead.
"Dad said that-"
Castiel tilted his head and Dean didn't know whether he loved it or hated it.
"Dean?" It was Castiel, Dean groaned. "Can I come in?"
Cas cracked a smile. “Okay.”
More filled out, a little more muscle than two years ago.
"You said you were supposed to say buddy."
The next song had begun to play.
"Did you just call him-" Sam started, his voice much higher than normal with the amusement clear in his tone.
The seventh track starting to play.
They both nodded and went off to the rooms, I noticed they were both blushing when I mentioned our room.
"You sure know how to act like one." I muttered, making him glare back but he went back to staring at the bike.
"There's only two beds." Cas walked with me into the room. "The manager said that there's only rooms with two beds available, he said that as soon as we walked inside, I don't mind taking it."
Dean glowered at me. "Get us to a 24 hour diner."
“Just like that last one ‘made me better’? Hmm.” Dean glowered.
Dean's soft voice coming from the radio now that the long song had finished.
Seeming to have at least one new child every year.
“We were so close.” He muttered all the way back to the bunker.
It seemed the same for the Novaks.
"He's got really awesome eyes though, Daddy. Did you see them?" Dean grinned.
Castiel beamed at him and nodded.
Dean ignored me again, looking to Cas. "Course you're coming. Say we meet at the car in twenty minutes?" Dean turned to me.
He hadn’t been bed-ridden sick since he was very little.
"Dean's been the same." Mary admitted. "Come in."
Dean was all he had to live for.
"Yeah, you didn't see him a minute ago."
As soon as Castiel was out of hearing and looking distance Dean's face dropped, the brave mask he'd been wearing slipped.
A lot had happened in thirteen years.
"He deserves to know that he has a soulmate before he goes. You have to state that before you go into the army."
"Dammit Cas." I shoved his phone in my pocket and ran to the garage to check if his car was still there.
"Frankie was just sick. I thought he could get cured or something. He was my family. I didn't want the police finding out what my Dad did to him and his friend either. That would ruin the business."
None of them involved him having a husband.
I sighed, holding the bridge of my nose. "Did you stop arguing for long enough to get information at least?"
"Today and tomorrow. I don't think we're gonna go now. Honestly, last night just ruined everything." Fiona sat at the table and took Sarah's hand.
"Sammy pass me the disinfectant."
I waited in the car as we checked into the motel, trying to find more on the case but there was hardly anything online. The police report hadn't even been written yet.
"We can't just keep it a secret that he's found his soulmate, John. It's not fair." Mary argued.
“It’s not hoodoo, when you’re watching over the Earth for centuries it gets boring focussing on one part so I saw what each part of the world used for curing illness. Much more effective than these days.”
"Because you said it was stupid last time you got hurt." Cas tried moving Dean again.
"Why would you replace the beef on a burger? That would certainly ruin it." Castiel frowned.
“I hear the drug store has some amazing offers.” Dean muttered under his breath.
- A man named Timothy
We ate mostly in silence, I pulled my phone out and started looking into Franklin Moone more.
"You good?" I asked.
But of course whenever Dean would write a letter that he wouldn't send to Castiel he never mentioned any of that.
Cas put a hand under Dean’s head and brought the glass to Dean’s lips.
The moment that Dean Winchester had ordered Cas to kill Sam Winchester.
"What?" He glared.
After another hour in the bath, Dean insisted that his headache was gone so Cas told him that he had to go and rest until the morning and he should be better.
"Some event in town." He shrugged.
Dean shrugged. "Some people are just dicks, thank your Dad for that one."
Mary saw Dean recoil but then gasp at the same time that Castiel did.
“Finally! Something that people in 2016 have heard of.” Dean grinned.
"Yeah, what can I do for you? We've only got a couple of rooms available."
"You're not gonna be goin' fast, there's no need."
His breath caught and it didn’t get uncaught.
"Okay, Dean."
I quickly set off and heard a muffled gasp as Cas' arms somehow became like a vice around my middle.
"I already miss you, man. Please don't go." Dean blinked away the tears that were quickly forming at the thought of Castiel with a gun in his hand.
"I'm telling Charlie." I gave him a shit eating grin and shut the door.
"No, listen. Either you come home or you don't come home and I come and sort Kelly out myself, with or without you. I'll be setting off tomorrow night. Capiche?"
Croat’s were everywhere.
Dread that her son had a soulmate so young and would be terrorised that they were both male in a small town in Kansas.
Dean sighed. "Homophobic ghost."
Castiel shrugged him off. "My Dad said I should go. I can't just say no to him."
I grit my teeth. "I see. So they were sharing the bed, they weren't just friends. Were they acting suspicious at all? Anything odd about them?"
“Why does it feel so rough?”
Mary was sat alone at the bar after a big argument with her parents when all of a sudden her world burst into color just as someone collided into her.
Excitement that her son had a soulmate so young and wouldn't be searching like everyone else.
Fiona shook her head. "This room has been fine. Why?"
"He second guesses." Dean huffed. "Once he's confident I'll let up."
It was soothing.
There was some creaking and shuffling around until one of them sighed.
“I’ll be better.” Dean pretty much passed out after that and drooled on the pillow for the next five hours.
"Ready when you are." I nodded, resting my chin on his shoulder.
"I'm here, Dean." I heard his voice from near his car.
"Yeah, that's her name." Dean defended. "But it's more something you'd call someone you like."
"Dean, get off. You're too warm."
“DEAN! HELP!”
Castiel gulped, looking down.
“Still.”
“Are you worried about today?” Cas asked, leaning on Dean’s shoulder.
I controlled my expression. "I don't need you."
“It’s an expression.”
"Cas, I was, the phone was off when you called me back and then you didn't answer your phone again. I thought you were in trouble and-"
His bag and his shoes forgotten on the floor.
There were the acceptable ones that he'd call everyone else;
Cas glowered. “You’ll be better.”
Dean melted, he felt a few tears prick in his eyes, his heart was beating so fast he was surprised he hadn't passed out.
Cas nodded, he didn’t tell Dean that it was different to the other times; these feelings were stronger and more urgent.
I smirked. "Yeah, I guess so. He'll be fine."
“We should always be cautious, Dean.” Cas said half heartedly.
"He's your friend too, Dean. More our friend." Castiel explained to Sam. "I'm sure you could meet him if you wanted to." Cas sat down and Dean passed him a beer.
"Let's make the most of it, huh?" Dean grinned, swallowing his feelings.
“Of course.” Cas nodded, clearing his throat.
"Physically?"
The guy rolled his eyes but stuck his hand out. "Pete Moone. Glad to be of service."
Cas nodded.
He went straight to Cas’ room and got into the shower, his leg burned and now he could see why, Cas’s wings.
"I think it'll be better tomorrow. You're best friends."
"Yeah, got it."
“You need to bathe”
"Yes."
"Hey what're you doing?"
They each took a different aisle of the store, stuffing anything they could reach into their bags.
"I'm fine." Cas groaned, leaning his head back, not realising Dean's arm was there. He didn't seem to care and kept his head there.
Castiel finally looked up at Dean, searching his eyes for any forgiveness. "I care too much for you. It hurt reading your letters and you were hurting too. I-I guess I thought that if I was distant we would both feel better but I just felt worse and worse."
Castiel didn't look to Dean before he answered with a huge grin. "The grass outside, Daddy."
The love for him rivalled only Sammy.
"So the wife would become the husbands trophy for being a success? That seems rather outdated." Castiel didn't seem to notice. God Dean wanted to run but Castiel looked happier than he'd seen him in weeks.
Cas stayed and grabbed Dean’s hand.
Cas hissed at the pain.
"You said the two men were friends right?"
Mary cast her eyes over to the Novak parents who were preoccupied with the children closer to them.
Dean found Cas’ old trench coat hanging in his closet.
"I mean it Cas. Don't show off."
Dean felt the blush coming straight back into his cheeks, his neck, his damn ears.
“Everyone out.” Dean ordered.
"So are you and you follow your father's orders." Castiel countered, raising an eyebrow.
Mary sighed. "When I told you I assumed he knew because of how he was looking at you, Dean. Are you sure he doesn't know?"
I shrugged. "He probably thought it was just a milk run, rogue vamp."
"Why are you crying? You hardly ever cry."
"So get this, Franklin had another kid. This guy called Franklin Moone jnr. He died just after Franklin shot himself at his own house, three states over. A slash wound probably made with a steak knife."
He was locked up a few times for bar fights and under age drinking.
Not even the chance of slipping up over text.
"Your brothers in my room?" Pete asked.
Dean blushed. "Bad enough scumbag Pete thinks it."
It hadn't even occurred to Mary or John to speak to Dean about soulmates anyway.
Still acceptable.
“SHOOT! AVOID CAS.” Dean ordered.
The same happened with Dean and Cas'. We met back in our room.
"We weren't told much, my partners are speaking to the local police now." I cleared my throat. "Who called the police?"
But it was very clear to him that Castiel wasn't going to come home.
He knew how strained Castiel's relationship with his father was these past few years.
"You always run." He rolled his eyes.
The machine whirred as it skipped to the next song.
"You don't even wanna know what could of been on that bed post." Dean smirked. "Just let me fix you up, Cas."
Cas sighed. "We're all going to sleep?"
Cas gave him a sour look but folded the cloth neatly and put it on Dean’s forehead.
Cas' hand jerked to the skip button again.
His hand landing on Dean's bare shoulder to break his fall.
"You sure this is for safety?" I gave him a shit-eating grin as he muttered for me to shut up and hold on.
"I guess it got too much for them both, they ended it. Hating your own family must take it's toll." He was lying again.
"Early morning boys?" The waitress greeted.
"You don't have to."
"Yeah of course you can." Mary's voice was shaky as she buckled Sam into his car seat.
“And if it does?”
Dean didn't want that to happen so he carried on keeping to himself.
Pete glared at me. "I don't know why you're asking."
"What is it?" Castiel sat up, wiping his eyes quickly.
We got back up the tunnel and he straddled the bike again.
Cas turned to Dean with a big smile. "Really?"
Cas was laying half off the bed passed out whilst Dean was trying to pull Cas back up.
"You were worried about the business?" I scoffed.
"I wish I could say the same for Castiel." Chuck laughed. "But he's never been this bad."
Dean slammed his door and threw himself on his bed like a teenage girl, his cheeks still burning.
Dean let himself lay back on the bed, bringing Castiel with him. "It's okay. I'm sorry too. You home for good now?"
"The road?"
Dean studied each member of the group, they all shifted uncomfortably.
Dean didn't pick him up at the airport, he was too hung over, sneaking out of a hook ups apartment in the early hours and Castiel didn't ask him to either.
His eyelids fluttered open and Dean caught a last glimpse of that brilliant blue.
"Look, you're an angel but you've been with us long enough that you're a good hunter, man. Dean's just thick skulled, he's just trying to protect you."
Mom, Dad, Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Sammy, Kevin, Benny, Charlie, Lisa, Ben.
It hadn't worked.
"Right, can you tell me what happened? The full day, in your own words." I took out my notepad to take notes.
"Okay, so Dean, do you know what is the same color as the sky?"
Stupid truck.
Dean flung himself at Castiel and they both started to laugh, hugging one another.
Dean laughed. "Does that make me and Cas the breadwinners in this family?"
"The victims. Not friends. They were together."
It went straight to voicemail.
Mary pursed her lips.
"Get off." Cas grumbled, holding his head. "Too warm."
I let myself get some actual sleep.
"C'mere then." I shifted further up the seat, giving him room to sit behind me, he slowly straddled the seat. "Uh- wrap your er arms around my waist."
"I'm alright, thank you."
Mary thought nothing of it.
I rolled my eyes again.
Dean smiled up from his bed, a finger to his lips.
He tried the turn without stopping, making us waver but he pulled it off.
I chuckled and shook my head. "Of course not. Pete, the manager. He told you there were no single rooms left I'm guessing?"
"I doubt she was doing it when she was alive. At least she won't be killing anyone else. But you are right, she was a bitch of a ghost."
She heard Dean groan and stomp his way over to the kitchen.
I held my hands up. "Stop elbowing me in the ribs." I mocked.
"Why?" He glared.
"I only know how to drive a car." He tilted his head at me.
But Castiel was going to leave him and most likely get himself shot in the process.
"There's a pride event on in town, not many of those around here so everyone swarms here every year. Everyone says to avoid this motel because of the douchey manager but we didn't think he would be that bad." Sarah huffed.
Dean smiled to himself, shaking his head. "I mean it's something Jerry might call his new girlfriend. You understand?"
That was until he felt someone climbing over him to sit on the bed beside him.
"Castiel, what is the same color as my hair?" Mary asked, pointing to her hair.
That was usually left until they were old enough to have the birds and the bees talk anyway.
"Won't they figure it out before then?"
"You can't just stop a fight when you've said everything that you want."
Dean was someone who liked to give people nicknames, it was just a part of who he was.
"He doesn't look like he's gonna cry, Cas is fine." Dean rolled his eyes at Sam being so dramatic.
"And that just proves you've had some shitty friends." Dean chuckled. "Look, I know you probably don't understand why I called you that but you liked it right?"
Both of them not quite believing it but not wanting to question it too much either.
to go to Disney World!" He called after me.
"What color were they?" Mary asked, playing along.
"Okay, Dean."
"Is he good?" Dean asked.
"If they do then we should tell them but John thinks they shouldn't be raised with the stigma already attatched y'know?"
"Cas you're replacing all these lights! I know it was you, asshole." Sam shouted as he walked down the hall in the dark.
Once I was back, Dean came back to the motel with burgers in tow.
“This is a simple supply run, run in, grab what you can, shoot if it moves and run out. Only rule, don’t get killed or infected. Got it?” Dean ordered as he started the car.
This was going to be a difficult morning.
"What do you do to remember stuff, Dean?" I challenged.
Chuck nodded. "They could find other people too."
"Ready to try?"
But there were then the ones he used when he and Castiel were having their fights;
“Should I be?”
“You don’t want to talk do you?” Dean asked after five minutes of silence.
Dean rolled his eyes.
"Hopefully." I grumbled. "I just wish we knew for sure who it was. My money's on Franklin." I skimmed through his history.
Sam was worried.
Dean scowled but threw the first aid kit back in the trunk and headed into the diner.
Cas shuffled out from under the bed with a small box, opening it was the pocket watch.
"I'll get it out of him." I threw my trash away and headed out of the door and towards the front desk. There was a short middle aged guy there.
But from what she knew they were a nice family.
Chuck followed her eyes and grimaced. "Naomi will not like this."
"Cas looked really mad."
Dean gave him some more clothes and lay on Cas' bed.
Dean pulled his phone out again, he couldn't make a mistake over text. He would be fine texting him.
Castiel's hand dropped from Dean's shoulder. "But-but I thought that we didn't have one."
"Yeah, he will be. I was a dick to him."
"But it is, Sammy. If I stayed on the sofa the ghost wouldn't of thought we were a thing. I was all happily asleep, not even a nightmare and next thing I know Cas kicked me real hard, I was about to have a go at him but I saw the ghost just dragging him out of the bed. Then Cas woke up and tried grabbing me to help him but the ghost pulled him harder then threw him against the bed post, man. That sound went right through me. I swear I heard something crack I don't know if it was his head or the damn bed post. " Dean closed his eyes. "I didn't even think that it was a ghost, my mind was blank, I just wanted to get Cas up."
