“T-...Tell them…” Dean choked as blood spilled out of his lips. “...
Castiel reached for the drink with shaky hands before putting it to his busted lip. He drank the harsh liquid which made his omega body instantly reject it. Castiel pulled his face away to vomit on the floor, throwing up the liquid his body knew wasn’t safe for the baby. The men laughed loudly around him before Dean slammed his elbow back slamming one of the men holding him in the face. The pirate backed upholding a bloody nose as Dean twisted and tossed the pirate holding him. Dean moved to Castiel cupping his face.
Dean whimpered gripping him. “
“It’s his birthday and he wanted the one that looked like Cas!” Sam snapped.
“Are you sure-?” Castiel spoke as Dean took his hand squeezing it. Castiel’s face blushed at the soft affection before Dean moved to load the donkey with their stuff. Once everything was packed on, Dean helped the shorter man onto the Donkey, with Gabriel riding in a little backpack on Castiel’s chest.
“I couldn’t leave if I wanted to. Who would help you get dressed?” Gabriel stated. “Ruling naked in your plan?”
“Why are you calling me?” Stevie asked annoyed.
“Dean, let’s just call security-Dean!” Castiel panicked but Dean had already walked in. Dean moved quietly around the house before he heard someone turn on their blender. Dean moved to the kitchen pointing his gun at the man in their apron, boxers, and boots. The man turned just as Dean put down the gun.
“Will you escort me?” Castiel asked fixing his mask as Dean slowly got up fixing himself up. Castiel gave himself a glance in the mirror fixing his hair before Dean held out an arm.
“Stop,” Castiel called out the window loudly enough, that the carriage man heard. Sam turned around as well as Dean noticing the carriage come to a halt. Castiel stood helping himself out of the carriage before anyone could go to open the door for him. The carriage man just remained in his seat instead as Castiel walked into the woods holding himself.
“I can?” Dean asked, perking up as Castiel nodded before he stood. Castiel held out his hand to him as Dean glanced up.
“No, you wouldn’t have.” Dean laughed as Castiel beamed happily to cheer him up. Castiel moved to tickle him, Dean snorted and laughed as Castiel happily kissed his mate. Dean contently kissed back, before Castiel went back to tickling him. “Stop! Stop! You are going to make me pop out this baby early!” Dean snorted and laughed. Castiel continued ignoring his plea.
“I need you safe with the baby,” Castiel stated.
“Good.” Castiel beamed moving to kiss his forehead with care, Dean closed his eyes as the plane took off. Dean held Castiel’s hand till they leveled out and Castiel wouldn’t have had it any other way.
The men cheered as Castiel shot a look at Dean but...noticed two people poking out of the woods before ducking back in to not be spotted. Gabriel and Sam! Castiel tried to tell Dean with his eyes but Dean didn’t notice as he was yanked onto the ship with Dean trailing after him with the pirates.
“He’s just playing with Sam outside.” Castiel breathed as Dean’s eyes moved to the front windows seeing the boys running and screaming in some sort of game of tag.
An ache grips his heart, not a passing rueful regret, but true guilt and hurt.
. Although it’s just barely formed, its many eyes mostly closed or blinking dewily like a new kitten’s eyes, Dean’s true form is brilliant. The way it’s unshaped and spilling out from the edges of Dean’s human-apparent form is beautiful in its unintended intimacy. Castiel wants to sing hymns in Enochian to him. He can literally
“I had no expectations of you Dean, and you must know how happy this has made me,” Cas said quietly, “but I cannot linger here.”
Dean looked away, and then closed his eyes. He was happy for Sam, truly. Eileen was a great girl, and a perfect match for his brother, and he was so damn glad that Sam had the chance for a long, happy life. But that didn't change the fact that Dean had a constant hollow ache in his chest, and it got worse as he watched them. And he couldn't drink it away, or fuck it away, no matter how hard he tried.
Dean seemed to struggle for a second, and then spoke again. “I mean, yeah, I love Cas. Of course I do…but is it…you know, like that? I never even thought about it.”
"No" Sam said. "You can hit me again if you want to, but I'm not letting you of out of here until we've talked."
"Maybe I knew that, all along, but I just didn't want to deal with it.” Dean said, and his eyes reflected his guilt.
Dean struggled for words. “Well, I talked to Sam about things, and he said, well, I mean, he thought….” Deam stammered and trailed off. Cas was watching him intently, his expression open, and somehow that made it hard for Dean to speak. He looked down at the floor. “Sammy thought there might be something to it. You know, some chemistry, between you and me.” He took a deep breath to steady himself.
But Dean shook his head. “I’ve always been into chicks,” he said, “I don’t have any problem with guys who aren’t, but that’s just the way it is. Maybe, with Cas, maybe there was some sort of chemistry or something...” he started to acknowledge, when Sam interrupted.
Dean looked up at him in shock. “What?”
Cas blinked.
Sam looked at him with concern. "Well, yeah, of course" he said. "But I can't remember the last time I saw you up at 7am." Eileen slid into view, but stayed close, her arm curving around Sam, who automatically laid his across her shoulders. "We were just coming to get some coffee" she said, and smiled up at Sam, who closed his eyes briefly before planting a gentle kiss on the top of her head. Together they moved toward the coffee maker to put on a fresh pot.
But Dean was distracted. “That’s good, that’s good” he said, absently.
Dean sighed heavily, but said nothing. An awkward silence stretched between the brothers.
And he was nearly there when he became aware of the sound of a door opening, the shuffling of two pair of feet, and the low, deep rumble of his brother's voice. A few minutes later, Sam entered the kitchen clad only in a pair of pajama bottoms, and then halted in his tracks as he caught sight of Dean. He pitched forward and made an "oof" sound as Eileen, who'd been following close at his heels, bumped into him, surprised by his abrupt stop. "Dean...uhhhh..." Sam stammered as Eileen peaked out from behind him. Sam glanced down at her. All she had on was his pajama top, but she was petite, and mostly covered by it. "Uh, we didn't think you'd be here" he continued.
“I love you, too” Cas said. Then, with a gentle whoosh, the angel was gone.
Dean swallowed. "Cas loved me Sam. Like I loved Lisa."
“That’s good” Dean said, relieved “Cas didn’t deserve that.”
Cas smiled at him. “Well, try. For me” he added, and Dean realized that he’d have to. “I promise.”
"Look, I'm really not gonna do anything to you." Dan said, and then words started to spill from his mouth, without him meaning for it to happen. "It's just that I lost someone awhile ago, and it's not like we were together, or anything..." To his horror, he realized that were tears in his eyes and they were staring to spill over his lashes. "Only maybe we were. I'm not even sure." Dean knew he was babbling, but he found that he couldn't stop himself. The words tumbled out like tears, and he was powerless against them both. "Or we weren't together, but wanted to be? I don't really know, and either way it's too late now." The combination of whiskey and regret was making him incoherent. Except maybe he wasn't, because the woman - whose name he didn't even know - lost some of the fear in her eyes and approached the bed slowly.
"And, I think, this time, with Jack being all hands off and all, he's going to stay dead." Dean's voice was tight, and Sam could see the tension in Dean's body.
But Dean was on a roll, and started to shout. “I loved Lisa! Losing her and Ben hurt so bad I couldn’t breathe. You have no idea!”
Dean shrugged.
“Hi” Jack said. Dean froze in shock, and the anger that had filled in disappeared as quickly as it had come. Dean stared at him for several seconds, breathing heavily, before he spoke. “I thought you weren’t going to get involved in human shit anymore” Dean said, his voice accusing and his breaths coming in big, heaving gasps. Jack nodded. “That’s my plan,” he agreed calmly, “but I really couldn’t help but hear you yelling I’m still kinda tuned into you and Sam. Old habits die hard, I guess.”
“Well, I didn’t actually die. I was subsumed into an entity…” Cas started to correct Dean but was interrupted.
Jack shook his head. “I’m sorry Dean. We’re Team Free Will, remember? Cas made a choice to leave this plane of existence. I have to respect that.”
“I don’t know.” Dean said, his voice hollow.
He opened his eyes in time to see Sam look away quickly and pretend he hadn't been staring at his brother, worry furrowing his brow. "It's been a long night kids" Dean said, standing up, "and I'm gonna hit the rack. Wake me up if the world ends. Again.”
“Benny was my friend.” Dean’s voice had dropped to a whisper. “Cas is my friend. A guy can have friends and it doesn’t mean…” Dean’s hands were starting to shake, and Sam realized he might have pushed his brother too far.
"Do what you want," Dan said, "I'm going back to bed." He got back in the bed, turned on his side, and proceeded to ignore Sam. Sam waited until Dean seemed to settle in, and then he left the doorway and sat back down on the chair.
Dean looked hurt. “I wouldn’t have hidden it, Sam. Not from you.”
“So, Jack brought you out of The Empty.”
Sam nodded. “Maybe you were hiding it from yourself, better than you were from others.”
“So, how do you feel?” he prompted.
“I’m an angel of the Lord, Dean. I know exactly who, and what, you are And I do love you. The real you.” And then he stepped forward, laid his hand gently on the side of Dean’s face, and kissed him. It was a gentle kiss, and undemanding. Dean could have pulled away easily.
A knock at the door interrupted his memory, and Dean opened his eyes. "Dean?" Sam asked, not waiting for him to respond before opening the door. He walked in, slowly, and then made a face. "God, it reeks in here."
Cas sighed. “I’m afraid I have to go. Jack is pretty adamant about letting humans live without the interference of heaven.” He gazed at Dean. “I won’t be back” he said, as gently as he could.
His headache raged, but he was reluctant to take the aspirin Sam must have left for him. He wasn't sure his churning stomach could take it.  Dean tried to lick his lips, but his tongue was dry. Damn, but cotton-mouth was annoying. He forced himself to take a small sip from the bottle of water Sam had left next to his bed, and instantly regretted it, as his stomach rebelled. He spent the next several minutes heaving into a bucket. Sammy had thought of everything, apparently.
"Did he just…" Dean says.
"Clearly." Cas purses his (or rather, Dean's) lips. It's weird to see himself in such deep thought. "I suppose we'll have to make a plan once we get inside, then."
"No," Cas says, a hint of amusement in his voice. "I don't think I will. You're cute when you blush."
“Oh!” Gabriel snaps his fingers. Dean flinches, but apparently it’s just a regular snap this time, not the kind that turns them all into flamingos or some shit. “That reminds me.” Gabriel points at Cas. “Word on the heavenly street is that the Big Guy got wind of your rebellious ways, and he actually thinks you did the right thing. So he told Zachariah to let you off the hook.”
“Almost.” Dean steps forward, heart pounding so hard it feels like it’s about to explode. “Just gotta do one more stupid thing first."
Once the action gets going and Indiana Jones triggers the giant rolling boulder trap, Dean kind of forgets everything else. He's seen
Castiel bristles, more out of habit than anything. "I'm perfectly capable of doing that myself," he says curtly. "I don't need your help."
he gasps.
“Get out.”
Cas folds his arms across his chest, and even though Dean is seriously pissed off, he can't take his eyes off those huge hands and firm, muscled arms. It feels like no time has passed since that night. Cas is still sexy as fuck and Dean's still a whiny, needy little shit.
“I’m not,” Dean replies, grinning. “It’s nice to see you again, dude. Y’know, when I’m sober and not acting like an idiot."
It's sharp, aching guilt layered over paranoia. It's the sound of knuckles hitting flesh and the coppery taste of blood. It's adrenaline mixed with slowly simmering rage. It's the most delicious aroma he's ever encountered. And it's coming from a man who looks every inch the fresh-faced college student.
“Listen, if he wanted to steal from me, he’s had ample opportunity already,” Dean counters. “The guy’s in a tough spot, so I’m helping him out. That’s all.”
. “I fell on your roof in the middle of the night and frightened you and your children greatly. Yet you still took me into your home and gave me shelter. Please allow me to assist you with this task, Dean. It’s the least I can do to repay you.”
“Hell if I know.”
"You’ve got two choices,” Cole tells him softly, as calmly as if he’s reading the daily special on a menu board.“You can shut up and hold still. Or I can rip your dick off and stuff it down your throat. What's it gonna be?”
“Says who?” Cas kisses him between his brows, tenderly, softly, hands running over Dean’s torso and along his sides. “You are mine and I am yours, and I say you’re beautiful. And handsome. And perfect.”
He gets ogled in bars all the time and not once has he
"This better be about the curse," he grumbles, "and you better have some idea of how to break it, because I am

"It's possible." Castiel can't stop staring at Dean's mouth. It's mesmerizing. "If a pack alpha steps down or is killed, there's usually a battle for dominance among the other members. If this wolf lost the fight for top dog, he might have decided to hunt solo for a while."
Cas takes a step backward. "Get your homophobic ass away from me."
“It’s not Santa,” Jack tells his brother. “It’s not Christmas Eve yet.”
Dean's frown deepens. "Well, that's not right. I'll talk to the IT department and see what's up."
hasn't forgiven him for that, even a year later.
“Will you let me pick you up?” he asks. The raven chirps again and hops closer still. “I’ll be really gentle. Don’t get scared, okay?”
“You did this,” Cas mumbles. “You did this for us.”
Cas still has one of those, the weirdo.
have a seat," Dean mutters, stalking over to the row of saggy leather chairs and throwing himself into one.
"It pays well."
"I—" Dean's mouth flaps open and shut. "I really said that?"
“That wasn’t your mom voice?” Castiel asks weakly.
Cas rolls his eyes, but he's smiling as he takes Dean's hand. "He's your kid, too. You have the same appetite."
Mary arrives at six o’clock the following evening in a sturdy-looking pickup truck, and Dean and Sam both immediately rush outside to greet her. Cas stays inside with Jack where it’s warm, but Gabe goes out to help unload the truck, which is piled high with bags, boxes, and various baby equipment, including a bouncy seat and a stroller.
Jack starts fussing again, squirming in Dean’s arms. “Great,” Dean snaps. “See what you did?”
“Um…” Cas swallows, feeling his face turn red. “Dean?”
"I've got it," Dean says aloud, harsher than intended. "You just keep an eye out, all right?"
“Relax, lover boy.” Gabriel is now chomping on a misshapen snowman. “He’ll be fine in a minute.”
Cas shakes his head, eyes huge as he stares at their unexpected guest. “I’ve never seen him before in my life.”
the time.”
let me drive Baby."

10:35 AM: Alfie misshelves an entire section of curse books right before he leaves, which means Castiel has to reshelve all of them while simultaneously trying to watch the front desk, because Meg just
“You did so. I heard you. And now you’re blushing.”
repeating over and over in his head like machine gun fire.
"Cas," Dean tries to shout, but it comes out in a squeak. "Shut the door!"
"You are no longer my brother," Cas says flatly. "Get out of my house this instant."
"Oh God." Dean buries his face in his hands.
By the time he gets off the phone, Jack and Ben have woken up and gone straight into the kitchen. Dean pokes his head around the door to find them both babbling at Castiel, who is listening with a level of focus normally reserved for brain surgery.
“Oh, man.” Dean guides him into the living room, where a bunch of other people are sprawled over sofas and armchairs watching a football game on TV. “You gotta try it. It’s the best thing ever.” He leans over one of the sofas and smacks a tall, long-haired guy on the back of his head.
“Not yet. But knowing Charlie, there will be.” Dean slouches in his seat, trying to look as inconspicuous as possible.
"Finger," Dean says, still in that far-away voice. "I was slicing oranges. Knife slipped. I don't know how it happened, it just… did."
She squeezes his shoulders gently, then lets him go. “I want regular updates,” she tells Dean as she opens the front door. “And you
Oops. "Uh, no," Dean says, thinking fast. "I've just… heard a lot about you. From Dean."
“Can I tell you a secret?” Cas whispers.
"Can I hold him?"
"Yeah."
"I'm fine," Castiel grunts. "Just… nervous, I suppose."
“What guy?”
Castiel considers. The day before yesterday, he would have been appalled at the idea of leaving HunterCorps. Now that he's met the man who owns it, returning to work seems far less appealing.
He does not think about Cas’ soulful blue eyes, or those big nerdy glasses he wears when he’s reading, or that cute little squint he makes when he doesn’t understand a pop culture reference. He doesn’t think about Cas explaining stuff in his deep, sexy voice, or running his hand through his sexy hair, or wearing one of those sexy waistcoats that cinch tight around his midriff.
“That’s too long,” Dean whines, mostly for comedic effect. Mostly.
"¿Otro?" the bartender asks, nodding at his empty glass.
"They're, um… I got some that are— oh
With that cryptic remark, he rises to his feet. Even though he has to crouch in order not to hit his head on the ceiling, Dean can tell that Castiel is nearly as tall as he is. The thought is oddly pleasing.
"Whisky por favor," Dean says. Years of investigating have taught him that it pays to know some of the local lingo. Even if your pronunciation is shit, most people still give you points for trying.
into it, in fact, that by the time Marion and Indy escape the burning tavern, he still hasn't noticed the warm hand resting on his leg. At least not until it slides further down and starts stroking his inner thigh.
"Library is downstairs, not up," Castiel reminds him.
“That’s all right, I don’t want to intrude—” Cas stammers.
“Castiel!” Jo shouts, appearing out of nowhere and seizing Cas by the arm. “Get on up there, mystery man! I got fifty bucks that says you’re mine.”
A pause. “That makes sense,” Cas says, his expression thoughtful. “They would want to be sure their life goals are similar. That they want the same things.”
Cas’ mouth, licking and sucking and nipping at those gorgeous lips, and Cas is letting out these quiet little moans that light Dean up from the inside out. He slides his hands down Cas’ back, caressing him through layers of clothing, wishing it wasn’t so damn cold and he could undress them both right here.
"I need to clean up," Cas says, pulling his pants back on and making a face at the stickiness. "Can you feed him and check his diaper?"
Someone up there must be smiling down on him, Dean thinks as he deposits a sleeping Jack into the bottom bunk. Jody and Donna took the boys sledding for nearly two hours, so they were completely worn out by the time Dean picked them up. He barely got them into their pajamas before they crashed, and it’s not even ten o’clock yet. Score one for the Dean Love Machine.
They’re meeting Charlie at the Winter Wonderland Festival downtown, mostly just to wander around and entertain the kids, but possibly do some shopping, too. Cas seems to find everything about the journey fascinating, even ordinary things like filling up the Impala’s gas tank. He spends most of the drive with his face glued to the window, taking in the sights of their little town all dressed up for Christmastime. He reminds Dean of Jack and Ben as toddlers, when everything was new and exciting and met with wide-eyed wonder. It’s kinda cute.
Cas?” Dean asks suddenly, leaning closer, and Cas tries not to shrink backwards. Dean is bigger than him, tall and loud and he takes up a lot of space. It’s a little unnerving. “Do you have, like, a major?”
He pulls out his phone and texts Charlie. If there's even the slightest chance that Cas might want the same thing he does, Dean's gonna take it. And if anyone can help him map out a master strategy to win someone's heart, it's the Queen of Moondoor.
“Relax, Paul Bunyan,” he says in a bored tone. “I’m not going to hurt you. I just need to talk to my brother.” He looks past Dean. “Hey, Cassiopeia. How’s it hanging?”
"I could bring my mattress down," Dean says, trying to offer him a way out. "Give us some more space."
"None taken," Gabriel says cheerfully.
reason to crush on Cas.
"You think we'll switch back tomorrow?" Dean asks once Cas has cleaned them both up.
“It’s been over twenty-four hours. That’s plenty of time.” Charlie shifts slightly on the bench so she’s looking Dean right in the eye. “Something tells me you just don’t
“Dean,” Cas grates out, and the sheer amount of

“Twenty-four sixty-seven,” the cashier says in a bored tone, breaking into Dean’s frantic thoughts.
“Okay.” Jack wanders off.
Besides, he kinda likes being petted.
He sets the stick down and slowly extends his hand. The raven lets out a nervous squawk, but it doesn’t move. When Dean starts petting the smooth dark head with one finger, it starts making a trilling sort of noise that sounds almost like a cat’s purr. Dean grins, delighted.
Dean’s jaw drops. “Okay, that is not
“So you’re staying?” Ben asks urgently, grabbing at Cas’ arm. “You’re staying here with us?”
For now, Castiel focuses on picking out some panties to wear, which is much more enjoyable than he expected. He tries on several pairs, mainly because he cannot get enough of seeing Dean's masculine form wrapped in such delicate, lovely garments.
"Sure, why not." Dean watches Manuel pour another shot, then decides it's time to get down to business. "So," he says, schooling his face into an appropriately serious expression, "did you hear about that girl they found near Hansen Dam?"
There's an eight-foot metal fence blocking the entrance to the service road, because nothing in Dean's life is fucking simple. Castiel keeps watch as he starts cutting a hole in the mesh, although he seems far more focused on Dean than on their surroundings.
“Told you he was smart,” Dean finally gasps, wiping his eyes. “Jesus Christ. My cheeks hurt.”
“Guys!” Dean barks. “Focus.”
"He's with Benny," Cas answers, carefully not looking at him. "He got home early from practice."
Barely two minutes after the sound of Baby's engine fades away, Cas hears the front door open and shut. Assuming it's one of the guys arriving back early, he doesn't bother getting up from the couch.
"You still aren't happy, though," Dean says. "Today, when I was in the library, I couldn't believe how many people treated me like crap, Cas. Like I was just a machine, with no feelings. You shouldn't have to put up with that."
Dean reaches out and pokes the skin around his eyes. "I have wrinkles," he almost wails. "I'm
"Get me some water."
“You have my word,” Castiel promises. “And thank you, brother. For all your help.”
“You got it,” Dean says distractedly, shoving his feet into his slippers and grabbing his phone. “I’ll be right back, okay?”
"And here I thought you were just being a romantic sap," Dean says, clenching his fists. "Is that why I felt so damn tired afterwards?"
“Uh.” Cas flounders under Dean’s stare. “We… haven’t quite decided…” He trails off.
7:04 PM: Dean throws
Somehow Dean manages to push Cas’ coat off his shoulders without breaking their kiss, and Cas worms his way out of the sleeves, making a frustrated noise when one of his arms gets stuck. For some reason Dean finds this wildly funny (like seriously, why the fuck didn’t Cas take off his coat
Dean grins at him, leans back, and folds his arms behind his head. "So do something about it," he challenges.
"But it was your idea."
He breaks the connection with a harsh gasp. Magic is far more difficult without help from his brothers and sisters. Castiel can already feel exhaustion creeping in, but he can’t leave Dean alone, and he doesn’t have the strength to carry him all the way back to the human’s village.
those full lips and long lashes look even more gorgeous in shadow. The sweetness of his scent is almost overwhelming at such close range. Castiel feels his mouth watering.
“So, Dean,” Bobby says. “What are you gonna do now?”
“Just because you were always picked last in gym class doesn’t mean he will.” Dean tickles Jack’s feet, making him squeal.
“No,” Cas says, sounding ashamed. “They aren’t.”
I treasure and hoard all kudos and comments like the validation-seeking goblin I am, so if you enjoyed, please consider leaving some outside my cave :)
There’s a noise over their heads. A creaky, thumping noise. It sounds like someone’s walking on the roof.
pretty mean to me earlier. Just trying to even the score."
Dean stares up at him, eyes glazed, a faint line between his brows. Castiel gives him a reassuring grin.
"Dude," Charlie says solemnly, "you just made the shortlist for most awesome friend ever."
Pleased that she’s allowing him to set the pace, Cas smiles and comes forward. “This is Jack,” he says. “He is five days old and weighs eight pounds, three ounces. And he eats and poops a lot.”
"Please what?" Cas is suddenly much closer, right at the edge of the bed, still rubbing himself through tight red lace. "What do you want, Dean?"
"Yes, it is." Cas' eyes zero in on Dean's crotch and he licks his lips. "I think you should play with mine now."
"You better answer that," Cole Trenton says through gritted teeth, nodding at the phone in Cas' hand. "I don't know how much longer I can hold him."
“They would probably also like to meet the potential partner’s extended family.”
Earning that E rating in this chapter... well, technically we already earned it, but now we’re REALLY going to earn it ;)
"Just look at this ass," Castiel purrs, slapping it sharply. Dean moans. "So fucking red. You're not going to be able to sit down for a
Cas makes him wait until he sobers up a bit, much to Dean's displeasure, but eventually he's able to stand up and walk in more or less a straight line to the bedroom. Cas walks behind him the whole way, hands resting lightly on his hips, keeping him steady. Dean can feel hot breath on the back of his neck and it's making him tingle. This is happening. It's really happening.
It's barely an apology, but apparently Victor decides that it's enough. He walks over and picks up Cole's duffle bag. "Let's get your shit unpacked," he says.
Dean rolls over and turns off the light. "Goodnight, Cas."
Dean and Cas both reach for Jack at the same time. Cas glances at him with a raised eyebrow, and Dean pulls back with an embarrassed cough. “You, uh, go ahead,” he says gruffly. “Your baby.”

“Good.”

"Do you still talk to them?" Dean asks, already knowing the answer.
"I'd never have guessed. You're a natural."

“You like the mac and cheese one? From Ian’s?”
"A demon killed my mom when I was four years old," Dean says abruptly. "Burned our house down."
Dean raises an eyebrow. "So you
"Maybe." Cas disappears into the walk-in closet, and Dean hears the sound of drawers opening and closing. He stares at the half-open door, entire body wound tight with anticipation.

"I always thought it was because of the pretty girl."
Dean leans forward and scoops an enormous slice of pizza out of a greasy box. He slaps it on a paper plate and hands it to Cas. “Mac and cheese on pizza,” he says solemnly. “Best thing ever.”
It’s good. It’s so good and easy and right. A few hours later when Jack starts letting out hungry wails, Dean gets up to prepare the formula while Cas stays in bed and soothes the fussy baby. He brings the bottle into the nursery and crawls back in bed with Cas. Jack is fed, burped, kissed several times, and put back into his bassinet. The next time, they switch so Cas is the one who gets up while Dean cuddles Jack in bed. It’s so natural, so seamless, that Dean can’t believe they haven’t been doing this all along.
Dean’s a complete puddle, every muscle relaxed and tingling. Cas rolls him over so he’s face up, then molds himself to Dean’s side and starts nuzzling him, planting soft kisses everywhere within reach, his large hands running up and down Dean’s body, soothing, quieting.
“Holy shit,” Dean says, leaning forward. “His balls are

“Yeah, but have you ever done anything crazy? Like, what’s something you’ve been wanting to do, but haven't because it was too scary or whatever?”
“Hmrf.”
“I didn’t build a fire,” he says, realizing.
Standing up to two Winchesters is too much for Cas’ sleep-deprived brain. “Fine,” he says grudgingly. "I'll let someone else help."
"I will
He finally puts Jack in his bassinet and leaves him alone for a few minutes. He feels a little better now that the baby isn’t shrieking right in his ear, but then he feels awful
“And don’t worry about packing,” Dean continues, ignoring Gabe. “I’m gonna call Mom in the morning and explain that we might need to come a couple days later than we planned.”
"Yeah." Dean hesitates, then asks, almost shyly, “You, uh... wanna come watch?”
"Why not?" Cas throws back over his shoulder. "You did."
He hits the Admit button without replying, and a moment later he hears footsteps thundering up the stairs. Castiel opens the door and is greeted with the strangest image he's ever seen— himself, dressed in tight jeans, a bright blue henley, black boots, and aviator sunglasses. He didn't even know he
To his relief, Dean doesn’t return. After a while, Gabriel comes back downstairs, a huge hickey on his neck and a smirk on his face, and tells him it’s time to go.
“Shut up,” Sam says. “I’m pretty sure it’s normal. C’mon, put him on the scale, Cas.”
Castiel grits his teeth. “Hello, Dean.”
are infuriating," Castiel retorts, leaning against the arm of the couch, breathing hard.
He's not surprised to see a small shrine on the back counter— this is a predominantly Latino neighborhood and lots of people worship saints— but he
"Oh." Dean swallows hard. "Well. Uh… thanks."
"Careful," he gasps when Cas finally pulls away. "Don't get too greedy, big guy, or I won't be able to stand up for this next part."
"No, I'm just not stupid." Castiel resumes his efforts to drag Dean over to the couch.
On the fourth night, Cas falls asleep during a Christmas movie marathon and jolts awake to find himself smushed against Dean’s shoulder, a thread of drool hanging from his mouth. Mortified, he jumps up and mumbles that he should go check on Jack, not daring to look at Dean’s expression because it’s probably one of disgust.
"Thank fuck." Dean blows out a huge breath of air and wipes his eyes. "I really didn’t feel like getting dumped tonight."
being picked up and carried by a big strong man. He wriggles happily in Cas' arms and lets out a delighted gasp when Cas tosses him onto the bed effortlessly.
. He throws his head back against the arm of the couch and groans. “Oh God, Cas, do that again, it feels so good—”
“You got it. Hey Cas!” Dean calls. “You want anything from Kwik Trip?”
Cas leans on the bathroom vanity, arms trembling with fatigue. No one warned him how much his arms would hurt from carrying a baby around all the time. He tries not to look at himself in the mirror; he knows he must look absolutely disgusting. When was the last time he had a shower? He can’t remember.
"Damn it, Dean." Castiel throws his pen down on the desk. "How many times are we going to have this conversation? We need
dancer.”
"It's probably for the best," Cas says dully. "To be perfectly honest, if I can't have you, life isn't really worth living anymore. Some people don't deserve to be saved.”
"Turn over, my lovely," he croons, and Dean obeys instantly. His cock is angry red and weeping, his balls are tight, and a gorgeous blush spreads all the way from his face to his sternum. His nipples are covered in bite marks and there's an absolutely blissful expression on his face. So trusting, so exposed and vulnerable.
“Family friend.” Dean grins. “And she loves babies. She’s gonna go nuts when she finds out Sam and I got her one for Christmas.”
Cas laughs and puts his arms around Dean's neck. "It's okay. I am, too."
“Hi," Dean whispers back, blushing a little.
“I don’t want to ruin Christmas for everyone,” he mumbles.
“I... don’t know.”
There's a moment of silence, which makes Castiel think he's won the argument. Then he turns around and almost slams into Dean, who's suddenly right up in Castiel's space, green eyes flashing fire.
“Dude,” Dean groans. "TMI."
“Gonna be okay, Cas,” Dean says, watching him. “You got the Winchesters behind you now."
Dean swallows hard. "I don't believe that," he says. "You're awesome, Cas. You'd do just fine. Even if you're an asshole."
A second later, Dean gets on the line. "Hey," he says tensely. "What's up?"
The warmth in Castiel’s heart fades quickly. “Part of me hopes Luke never comes back to get him,” he confesses. “He’s the wrong kind of fucked up. For anyone, but especially Jack. He’s irresponsible, and impulsive, and Jack’s not going to have a good life with him. I know it.”
"Enough." John's mouth is a thin, hard line as he stares at Cas. "Explain to me how you screwed this up, Dean. Tell me your reason for executing the sloppiest, most idiotic field op I've ever seen in my life. And say it loud, so the rest of your team can hear. I want them to hear just how well you covered their backs in the line of fire."
Dean closes his eyes and reminds himself that fratricide is generally frowned upon by most human beings. “Cheeseburgers,” he repeats. “Got it. Anything else?”
"It's a good way to avoid doing homework," he jokes.
Dean downs the tablets and the water, then lets Cas manhandle him over to the sofa and push him onto the cushions. He's done resisting.
He finally chooses a navy blue suit, pairs it with a white button up and dark brown oxfords, and just for fun, adds a polka dotted pocket square and tie. When he's finished, he looks ready to walk the red carpet. Satisfied, he snaps his lapels outward with a flourish, and ventures out into the main living space.
"How long have you been hunting?" he asks as Dean wrestles with the wire cutters, which are cheap and flimsy and probably better suited for snipping through pipe cleaners rather than industrial grade steel.
"Oh my God," Cas chokes. "Dean, sit down. Right now."
“I see,” Castiel replies. “And where is your mate, Dean?”
But Castiel just smiles. “Parenting is a very admirable occupation. And you are doing it alone, which is even more admirable.”
Castiel's smirk turns downright predatory. He undoes his belt and takes his pants off slowly, eyes boring into Dean's the entire time. Then he's standing at the foot of the bed wearing nothing but tight black boxers, and Dean is so hard it fucking
For the first time, Dean is actually glad the holidays are over. Mom wanted to spend as much time with them as possible during her visit, which was great, but it meant Dean got zero chances to hang out with Cas and Jack on their own. So he's secretly kind of relieved when Mom leaves on January 5th. School doesn't start back up until the 15th, so they have a solid ten days before things get crazy busy again.
"No," Dean says automatically, "it's not your fault. I thought I locked it, but I guess I didn't."
older!”
“I don’t know you,” he says.
No problem bro, happy to help out
"Oh, so you'll just laugh for anyone," Dean says, mock-offended. "I see how it is. Little giggle slut."
Dean can't help thinking about what he said. When
"Thank you."
Abruptly, he reaches for Jack. Cas shrinks backwards, holding the baby tight to his chest, and Luke's smile fades. "C'mon, Cassie," he wheedles. "I just wanna see my son."
, not a burglar. What the hell?
"Are you hard, Dean?" Cas asks, his voice hoarse. "Are you getting off watching me play with your dick?"
"My family is very religious," Cas says at last. "I tried to be what they wanted for a long time. And eventually I realized that no matter what I did, I'd always disappoint them. So I stopped trying."
They stand shoulder to shoulder as they watch the bodies burn. Dean is hunched over like he's protecting himself, hands stuffed in his pockets, jaw set, a hard line between his brows. Castiel sneaks as many glances as he dares, soaking in the perfect shape of Dean's body, the way the firelight softens his already-soft features.
"Is that funny, Jack?" Cas is grinning so much that his cheeks hurt. "Is Dean being funny?"
"No way in hell," he snaps.
Cas represses an eye roll. “Lots of couples don’t do that, Dean. Not in public at least.”
Shit.
Cas never thought he’d feel comfortable in a fraternity, but over the past year, Dean and his housemates have made it a surprisingly welcoming place to hang out. Benny, Victor, Cesar, and Ash are all nice people, if a little loud and raunchy with their humor. Cole is the only one who doesn't seem to like him, but then again, he doesn't seem to like anybody, so Castiel doesn't feel too offended.
"Fine," Cas says loudly over Jack's wails. "You should let me change his diaper first, though. He really stinks."
The next volunteer is, to Dean’s disgust, Cole Trenton, who swaggers up flexing his muscles and flashing a smarmy grin. Some waifish blonde who works at the truck stop two towns over snags him almost immediately, probably because everybody who lives here already knows that Cole’s a first-rate dick and wouldn’t be caught dead on a date with him.
“Dean.”
Cas turns his head and stares at him. "On Friday. You came to me and said Jack and I needed space. From you. To build our own life." He can't believe Dean would forget saying such a hurtful thing.
Dean reaches up and takes Castiel’s face in both hands. “Don’t leave me again,” he says. “I can live with you or you can live with me, but promise me that we’ll stay together, no matter what.”
“We’ve already done those things,” Cas repeats. “I’ve met your extended family and your closest friends. We’ve shared living space and parenting duties. We find each other attractive and desirable. We seem to be compatible in many ways. I haven’t been able to contribute financially yet, but I can certainly seek employment if it would be helpful.” He smiles slightly. “The point is, Dean, that we’ve already met most of the criteria necessary for a successful long-term partnership. If we’d known each for five years instead of five days, would it really make that much difference?”
“Okay, Allow him in,” Dean stated moving to make himself tea. “Lucifer, can you go pick up Leo?”
“Yeah.” Dean got up. “Right as rain.” Dean waved him off as Castiel got up as well. Castiel looked at him with worry as Dean took his hand pressing a kiss to his palm. Castiel went red, seeing the soft affection. “I promise. I’m okay.”
Dean yawned waiting for his coffee, switching his sleep schedule was a bitch but Castiel and Crowley were out of town again. Dean was out with Benny buying some stuff for the kids, Dean had already bought clothes for the girls. Despite being really tired, they had managed to get some stuff done. Dean was ordering them coffee as he moved to pay for the cup someone spoke behind him.
“D-Dean?” Benny breathed in worry as the kid shoved out of his hand running as fast as he could. However, he didn’t get far, as police shocked him with a tase putting him in demon cuffs. Benny ran over to the ambulance as they were loading in a body bag. He went to get into the ambulance but Chuck stopped him.
“W-Wait, I’m your mate?” Dean choked as Castiel looked down at his words. He was. “I-I thought you said you mate for duty.”
“Of course, Dean…” Castiel laughed. “I’ll marry you!” Dean moved to hold him pressing him into a loving kiss as the Winchester family clapped happily. Lucifer moved to join them, happy to lick their faces as Dean lovingly shoved him away.
“It’s no problem, I appreciate the faith.” Stevie beamed.
“I do recall Gabriel give us a stern talking to the sixth or seven-time we did it.” Castiel hummed.
“It is to me.” Castiel breathed as the demon got off the car and walked to him his hands shoved into his pockets. Castiel pushed up his glasses.
“Always got my back.” Ash winked and snapped towards Dean as Dean turned hearing someone opening the front door. Castiel turned to look at who it could be when he noticed the twins standing behind him.
“Did they see you at your funeral?” Castiel asked as Dean shook his head no.
Castiel walked back into the living room taking in the trash and pile-up of a depressed man. Castiel should have left, this wasn’t his problem. He came, found a pathetic excuse of a former super-villain on the floor, and now he should leave…but instead he found the garbage bags under the sink and tossed everything on the counters into the trash can. Tossing the full bags out the window into the perfectly placed dumpster down below. It was a long time later that he heard the shower turn off. Castiel had picked up most of the living room and was washing his hands when Dean had come out from out of the bedroom.
“The prince needs rest, where is his room?” Dean snapped as the pirate king tilted his head eyeing him amused.
Castiel was in awe, Dean holding him close as the Whale pulled them along. Castiel watched the sea life around them. Seeing the life of the ocean untouched even by them. They had no idea Dean and Castiel was even there.
"Figures." Jess sighed blowing some hair out of her face.
“I will find us a clearing,” Sam called walking a bit into the woods to find a place to set up a camp.
“How long has it been raining?” Castiel spoke as Dean blinked rain from his eyes looking up at him.
“Thank you.” Everyone waved goodbye to the wolves in the Den, some followed them to lead them out of the forest before the rest parted ways.
“Sam?!” Gabriel kneeled, seeing him sleeping in the mud. Gabriel scooped him up with care dragging him back into the cave.
“We are crossroads demons till we know the world. It’s to gain experience.” Dean explained.
_________________________________________________________________________
“Don’t you get tired of this?” The man panted with desperate intakes of air.
-----
“Okay, see you inside.” Dean nodded as he walked up the stairs of the mansion. Pushing the door open with the shotgun. Dean walked inside prepared for a fight, what he didn’t expect however was how energizing the room was Dean felt his hair stand on end. Dean looked around the shotgun pointed. There was something uneasy about the place. “Sam?”
“Hey mom,” Castiel chuckled and hugged her.
“...If we must-” Castiel breathed with slight annoyance that he had to. Out here...A prince could just be Castiel...out here a knight could be just Dean.
“Really?” Castiel asked as Gabriel blushed harder.
“Do we have husbands and wives?” Castiel stood and turned.
“Alright.” Dean nodded as Benny nodded back.
“...I don’t mind at all,” Dean whispered, Castiel eyed him. “...Besides, the boys love having you around.”
“I know,” Dean stated knowing the side effects.
“What?” Sam asked.
_________________________________________________________________________
“Are you okay?” Jess asked as Charlie whimpered trying to talk but the bruised throat hurt too much. Jess pulled her into a hug as Charlie started to cry. Jess angrily looked at the human and the half breed. “...You two idiots, want to explain whose dumb idea it was to try to kill my date?!" Dean and Gabriel could only exchange looks.
But Dean just shook his head, still unable to speak.
"Maybe it would help if you talked about what happened to Cas..." Sam started to say, but stopped as Dean moved, fast as lightening  away from Sam, toward the far end of the room. "No! Damnit! Why does everything have to be about Cas!" he exploded. Dean's head spun and his stomach lurched, but he had to put distance between him and Sam. He started to head for the bedroom door, but Sam got there faster.
Dean waited a few minutes, and then rolled onto his back, and slowly sat up.
“This is a dream” Dean said, both disappointed and relieved. “So…are you..ya know, you?”
"Um, yeah. I figured that out" Sam said.
Dean said nothing.
He rolled that idea around in his head, trying to wrap his brain around it. He expected to feel the weight of regret over his delayed realization, or an abiding sorrow over Cas’ death – or whatever it was. And those things did hurt, deeply. But to his shock, they were tempered by a sense of peace.
"I mean, even when I figured out we couldn't be together, that it would only wind up with her and Ben hurt, or worse, I knew I loved her."  He looked up at Sam, and his eyes were bright, but dry. Sam nodded his understanding.
Sam waited a beat, and then spoke. “I’m here when you want to talk Dean. About anything” and lef the room, quietly shutting the door behind him.
Cas looked confused. “What did you want to talk about?” he asked.
“I wanted to let you know that I was able to get Cas out of The Empty. Or, rather, The Empty and I came to an agreement about certain things.” Jack gave him a beatific smile.
“Good bye Dean.” Jack was gone in the blink of an eye, but Dean’s room had been put to right, and Dean was left wondering whether any of it had really happened in the first place. Bereft, he sat down heavily on this bed, and tried to get a handle on his emotion. Failing at that, he wept until he fell asleep.
Something about that broke Dean’s heart, and he interrupted the angel. “What? No!” Dean said, and Cas looked up in surprise. “I want to talk about what it means. For both of us.”
"Um...OK" Sam said, confused.
Dean nodded. “I know. I guess I have to wake up eventually.” He smiled at Cas sadly. “I’m sorry I waited until now to be able to…” But Cas stopped him with a kiss. “No recriminations,” he admonished, “it serves no purpose.” He looked at Dean sternly. “Live your life,” Cas said,” and don’t let me be a source of regret.”
Dean just shook his head. Sam stood up. “I know you loved Lisa. It doesn’t mean you can’t love Cas, too.”
“You know what, Castiel? Screw you!” Dean jumped up, knocking over a lamp in his haste, and it shattered on the ground with a satisfying crunch, so he kept on going, throwing the chair Sam had sat on against the wall, and then flipping the bed. He was turning to attack the desk when he realized he was no longer alone in the room.
Cas hugged him back, though hesitantly. “it’s good to see you, too.” He pulled back and studied Dean, carefully. “I heard your prayer, Dean. I was…uncertain of my reception.” And now it was Cas who looked fearful.
When she was finished dressing, she grabbed her purse, and headed for the door. Reassured that he made no attempt to stop her, she paused. "Look for what it's worth, I think love is love. Maybe you don't want to put a label on it, but it is what it is." She sighed and was gone, leaving him alone with his grief.
“And you want me to correct Sam’s error?” Cas asked. He looked thoughtful. “I could try to manifest to him in a dream, too, although Jack really doesn’t like interference…” he mused. There was no judgement in his voice, or disappointment. He was simply working out how to do what he thought Dean wanted, with no regard for his own feelings.
Dean licked his lips. “I wish you hadn’t done that Cas. Sacrificed yourself for me.” Tears started to form in his eyes, but that just pissed him off. He pushed the pads of this thumbs into his eyes, in a futile attempt to get the tears to stop falling. “The way you described me, the way you see me, as this noble, loving guy…it’s not real, Cas. That isn’t how I am. Mostly I’m angry.”
“And with Benny.”
He shuffled out of the kitchen before Sam could protest, but stopped to hold up the wall just outside, as the abundance of booze in his system made the world start to spin and his vision start to narrow. "I think he's getting worse" he heard Sam say, tears in his voice, before the dark closed in and Dean slid down the wall onto the floor.
Sam broke first. "Do you want to talk about it?" he asked, already knowing the answer.
So Dean got up from his bed, threw on his robe, and headed out of his room toward the kitchen. “Sam?” he called out, “you’re not gonna believe this!”
"It was a shitty deal, but easy to understand. I wanted her, but I didn't get to have her. Just the way things are meant to be for me.” He cleared his throat. " With Lisa, it was simple.  Nothing about Cas is simple."
Dean’s body shuddered at the command as he happily obeyed it, he came hard spilling his cum into the sheets. Castiel’s hand milking him of his cum as Castiel gave three more rough thrusts before he emptied himself into the witch.
“You know, I’m pretty fun though. You know, when I’m not dead.” Castiel took another bite of his meal.
“You’re a virgin?!” Dean choked surprised. Castiel was handsome! Why was he single and a virgin?!
“There will be no ducks.” Dean commented, noticing Castiel’s confusion. “...Don’t ask him about ducks-”
“Her spell was to find someone who would change my life.” Castiel crossed his arms. “I guess she wasn’t wrong. A time traveler from the future is a life-changer.”
____________________________________________________________________
“...I think you might be a Weatheren.” Castiel mentioned as Dean turned.
“Riot,” Dean commented as the dog moved from the window barking at the door wanting pets.
“Shug Monkeys.” Castiel explained. “Are a very scary beast that lives in the forest.”
“Dean? Did we leave the door open?” Castiel asked as Dean stood looking towards the door.
“Fine!” Dean laughed loving his face. Castiel moving to kiss Dean’s neck. “You got FIVE minutes.”
“Sam-” Gabriel got out the words when more rubble and boulders side down the mountain and slammed into the side of the carriage, the carriage slid down the side of the mountain. Gabriel and Castiel could only scream as farther and farther they tumbled down heading towards a deadly cliff.
“Wait, Rowena, you said it wouldn’t affect anyone else?” Castiel turned concerned.
“...No.” Crowley leaned back.
Castiel’s eyes were so bright staring in lust at Dean’s, but Dean didn’t move. He allowed Castiel all the time in the world to stretch to his size. Dean taking time to press kisses to his lips, easy and slow kisses. Distracting Castiel from the pain till Castiel had slowly started to rock down on Dean. Slowly at first, till Castiel whimpered and bounced on Dean’s cock in desperate begging whimpers, needing and wanting more. Dean pushed Castiel’s legs open widely before he slowly pulled out...but Dean didn’t slowly go back in. It was rough and Castiel whined like a bitch in heat to the intrusion.
“Did you hear that?” Bobby asked as Gordon nodded but wasn’t sure what he heard. Bobby moved to the mound, looking to see if he saw life. Maybe… Bobby howled lightly again.
_______________________________________________________________________
“You’re not leaving without me.” Gabriel snapped, the supers started arguing with each other.
“Okay,” Dean stated as they walked in. Castiel looked to see where the men’s clothes were before he started towards the aisle. Dean eyed the people that lived their daily eyes. Dean eyed them so fascinated as they walked around. Castiel made a b-line to the shirts already checking to find clothes for Dean. Dean stood beside him ignoring Castiel holding shirts up to him to check the size of his body. Dean glanced around watching someone pacing as they talked on the phone, watching an old woman looking at towels.
“Oh! Yes! Castiel we will see you downstairs, alright?” Gabriel beamed as he took Sam’s arm and walked away. Castiel listened to the silence of his room before hesitantly moving to knock on the connected room’s door. He heard something fall as Dean croaked.
_____________________________________________________________
Sarah sniffed the ground as John trailed behind her all chipper humming to himself as Sarah tried to hunt.
“Come on, Dean.” Castiel opened the door. Dean got out following Castiel towards the store. Castiel grabbed a shopping cart. “Stay beside me and don’t talk to anyone.”
“Sick?” Sam asked. “What’s wrong?” Dean hesitated not wanting to reveal too much but Castiel turned.
“...Sam…told you about me, didn’t he?” Dean asked as Castiel turned to look at him. “...With who I am…why do you care if I eat or not?”
“Goodness, I hope he’s okay.” Becky breathed pulling her sweater up.
“If I landed correctly, we are in Japan.” Dean beamed looking around. “It took me months to eventually get this right.”
“What about Castiel?” Crowley smiled sadly at her as Joanna eyed him. “He’s out living his life having his own happiness...I think it’s about time I do the same, don’t you think?” Crowley gave her a soft smile before walking away to continue his housework. Joanna sighed with love as she went on her way.
“I-I don’t know. I mean, there must have been one. I just...never wanted to go.” Dean admitted. “I couldn’t watch my brother cry.”
“...My spell,” Rowena spoke standing. “...this is who the universe brought. The person who is destined to be part of your destiny and change it forever.” Castiel seemed upset by this.
Castiel ran despite how hard his chest hurt, or how he felt like he could run anymore. A hand slid around his wrist yanking him back into a chest roughly. Castiel didn’t have to question who had followed him. He knew his smell, this touch, the feel of this body holding him.
“This is starting not to look like a kidnapping,” Michael commented looking out the window. “Too much blood.” Michael watched the people as they drove by.
Castiel jumped when someone hit his horn, Castiel sat up rubbing his face before he put the car into gear and drove home. Castiel walked up to his apartment, pushing open the door but paused to see Dean breaking a kiss with a delivery man. Dean’s eyes glowing in a sealed deal. Dean turned to look at Castiel who blinked in surprise. The delivery driver turned his head shyly and grabbed his keys.
Soon Dean was sat in his lap just holding on as Castiel pounded up into him, Sweat spilling down the witch’s skin as he ragged dolled in his hand. Allowing Castiel to turn him, twist him, bend him in every way Castiel wanted him. Dean’s eyes looked up at him in desperation, needing all the pleasure he was given and Castiel gave it.
“Oh yeah! Your birthday is coming up!” Sam cheered.
“How is Dean?” Michael turned to notice Lucifer coming back from the cave.
___________________________________________________________________________
“Hey. It’s okay. We are all okay.” Castiel squeezed his hand planting him there in the present and out of his head. “We have a home, we have the crops your working on. More than that, we are better than okay. We are set and it’s all thanks to you.”
When Castiel finished dinner, Gabriel continued to watch Dean placing flowers on his grave markers. Wooden crosses made from the wood that kept the door closed and the windows. Dean placed the flowers against the graves, saying a small prayer before Sam and Dean came back into their house.
“What do you mean?” Sam asked.
“How did you find me?” Dean asked as Castiel touched the bracelet.
“Humans are such...weak things,” Castiel stated tears forming in his eyes. “I just want Dean to be okay-”
“My lord, I believe I found a way to bring Mr. Winchester back to the present,” Rowena spoke. “But it must be in a couple of weeks. During the full moon.”
“Trouble shrumble.” Charlie waved off her concern. “Besides, no one knows who you are. Even if they did, would they really believe a super is having dinner in there?”
“No, you just looked less sad sometimes,” Dean stated. “I say go for it. He’s head over heels for you.”
“Do we have any idea how much longer?” Castiel asked as Michael shook his head no.
“You all warm, Leo?” Castiel stated as Leo nodded.
“Your concert was our first date.” Gabriel smiled into his phone as Castiel smiled at the cuteness as Gabriel showed some more photos of the band.
Mary smiled seeing her eleven years old coming out of school, Dean held his backpack and beamed seeing his mother. Dean ran to the car climbing into the front seat, seeing his mother and her large stomach.
“Whoa, Whoa, hold the breaks, the kids-!” Dean sucked in air as Castiel cupped his face moving into the space opening his neck. Mouthing at the tasty flesh, Dean couldn’t help but moan.
“How...did you know how to do that?” Castiel panted as Dean glanced at him.
"....It was his idea." They both pointed to the pass out Sam ratting him out as Jess sighed looking at her dumb older brother.
“I don’t think my nose is working all that well around you two,” Sam stated unsure.
____________________________________________________________________________
“Should we be letting him do this?” Mary asked as John patted her back.
“So you guys were close?” Michael stated.
“Babe, do I still have makeup on?” Castiel asked blinking his blue doe eyes up at Dean. Dean eyed his face with love.
“Dean?” Sam’s voice made Dean pull back from making out with Castiel on the floor to see Sam and a short man came rushing in. Dean and Castiel paused both in a very...sexual position on top of each other on the floor. Neither brother said anything as Sam took in the historical outfit Castiel was wearing looking like he stepped out of the revolutionary war...but Dean noticed the short man Sam was with was also wearing something off for the times. The short man looked like he was wearing...a toga and sandals? Both brothers stared before Castiel got off Dean, helping Dean off the floor before either spoke.
“Done,” Gordon stated as Sam ushered for the camera.
“Azazel!” Sam gasped as John turned to him, Sam scooped up the hamster who blinked at them. John let out a happy sob moving to hold Azazel who was very much alive and uninjured.
…When a whole day had passed, Sarah knew...there was no one coming. Sarah whimpered as her tail went between her legs and she turned away from the only happiness in her life...and went to the only place that would keep her and her children safe…
“Why?” Castiel asked as Dean shrugged.
Sam eyed Dean at such the word, Dean was so different than other angels. Hell, even Castiel loved Gabriel with all his heart, there...was still a line drawn. Gabriel knew he was Castiel’s servant and protector. Gabriel knew Castiel was his master. Dean almost seemed to refuse the role. Talked to him...like they were equal. A part of Sam who was distrusting of people wanted to not believe his words. That they were lies. However, all of him including the parts that didn’t want to believe...knew Dean’s words were sincere.
“You’re still in your pajamas? Did you not work today?” Mary asked annoyed.
“Goodnight,” Eve whispered as Benny and Crowley whispered them goodnight. They walked across the hall to their bedroom as Crowley hesitated.
“I forgot, you guys knew each other.” Dean breathed. “....Did you know who my father was?” Michael paused at that.
“W...Why?” Castiel asked as Castiel blinked away tears trying not to cry.
“Well, as my guard it is the only custom you stay in my room in a foreign kingdom. For my safety.” Castiel smiled as he turned his back to Dean, exposing the buttons on his back.
“Please forgive me for what I must do.” Castiel’s father continued. Castiel didn’t speak. “I am having your servants pack your supplies. You leave in the morning. Dean and Sam shall take you to the meeting place, it will be a journey so you have time to prepare yourself.”
“Why do you care?” Benny asked seriously as Crowley blinked taken back.
“You are coming with me.” The Fae spoke, taking him back towards the front door.
_____________________________________________________________________________
“Goodest boy,” John stated as he pet Lucifer. Sam kneeled petting Lucifer telling him he was a good boy before placing Azazel into his front pocket. Azazel curled into his pocket as John got up.
“Dean, you have no idea. He’s...so sweet and he is so tender with me.” Gabriel stated softly picking at his nails. “I never had anyone treat me like that before.”
“Yeah. Usually, he goes for a run to start his way. He’s kinda predictable.” Gabriel stated. “You don’t have a smoke on you, do you?” Michael shook his head no but Lucifer offered him smoke from his metal cigar holder. Gabriel took one, as Lucifer lit up a lighter for him. Gabriel breathed in the smoke with relief blowing it out. “He’s done the same thing since he was in high school.”
“...She was sick, Castiel,” Gabriel whispered. “...she did it to herself…”
him. Dean’s warm streams of cum spilling into him, Castiel didn’t hesitate to slam his teeth into Dean’s shoulder blade, riding his lover through it still Dean’s cock slowly but surely softened in him. Castiel slowly sat up moving to get off of him when he noticed Dean had...bitten into his own hand...to stop himself from mating Castiel back. Castiel panted concerned but Dean pressed his hips back down on his own, pulling his hand away from his bloody mouth to growl at Castiel.
“Hello, your majesty!” The kids spoke as Castiel ushered them in. The kids walked in happily looking more at the house than anyone inside.
This villain was known for his expensive taste, that man was solely responsible for most of the famous missing paintings like Poppy flowers by Vincent Van Gogh. Why would he live above a dive bar that looked like it hadn’t had a touch-up since his
“I used to be their house dog, you know?” John stated. “I used to sit by the fire, keep the farm safe and tend to the farm...but they decided they didn’t want me anymore. Lisa didn’t think they could afford me and the twins...thought I would be a problem.”
“He...He said he would be back. H-He promised.” Adam explained but Dean just slowly turned towards the front door just staring at it.
“You shouldn’t be your brother’s therapist,” Castiel mumbled.
Castiel stood up giving out a shaky breath before he heard a noise of a twig snapping behind him turning to look in surprise when something like a big stick came at his face knocking him out.
Castiel walked into the office of his Kansas office, he hadn’t made visited this building in a while. Especially since he started working from home. Castiel walked through the door, the front lady who was on the phone mouth hung open when she realized who it was. Quickly dialing her bosses up top to alert them to the unexpected visitor.
Dean shot awake coughing and panting as Sam’s tender touch to his face seemed to calm seeing Sam, he moved to hug his brother tightly. Sam held his back before they slowly pulled back, Sam softly held the washcloth to him which Dean took to place on his bloody nose.
“...Just a bit longer, Dean.” Castiel spoke softly kissing his hand. “I’ll tell you-”
Castiel looked at the back of his grumpy lover’s head as Dean walked with his hat pulled down and hood up. Sporting his favorite manga Supernatural t-shirt. Castiel couldn’t stop staring at Dean, his loving hand in his. Dean was grumpy, mostly because he hadn’t had his coffee yet. Which was the reason they were out and about. Dean loved and desperately needed his black coffee despite them almost always waking up past noon. Today was different though, today they had to get up early because they were getting married. Dean pulled open the door to the coffee shop opening it up for Castiel, always making sure his lover was first inside before closing the door. The paparazzi were left to stand outside to not bother the business as Dean stood in line.
“You are such a good little witch.” Castiel hummed lightly tapping his chin. “You took me so well.”
The screaming stopped the second Dean and Castiel was alone, Castiel giggling at the whole event as Dean wiped his face of the liquid.
“I feel like an abusive partner.” Dean pouted as Castiel snorted.
Castiel whose teeth had started to transform growled at him as the smaller man whimpered in his arms till he was dropped. The smaller man coward into the corner away from the demons. Castiel turned towards Benny growling when a small audible gasp made Castiel and Benny turn towards the small frozen freezer as Crowley looked away not able to stomach the sight.
“You didn’t even bruise it.” Castiel beamed.

” Gabriel mumbled already drifting to sleep as Castiel paused at the words. Gabriel...called him Daddy. Castiel’s chest got choked up, his heart-melting at that. Words...he never expected to hear. He...never wanted a family, a mate, or children. Now…
Gabriel stood in the aisle staring at the pregnancy tests, he was lost in thought just listening to the beeping of people buying their products. Gabriel breathed nervously before he pulled out his phone google searching which test was the most accurate. How many are too many? What should he grab? What is the most accurate?
“...Yep.” Charlie nodded innocently.
“Do you live around here?” Gabriel asked.
“Am I hearing things Azazel?” John cooed picking up the small brown and white hamster dressed up in a small monkey costume hat with a cute little monkey tail. Azazel was chewing on the small bit of car he had been eating in the scene. “Maybe you are just too good of an actor, hmm?”
Castiel breathed tiredly as he heard Dean close the door to their bedroom. Castiel took a seat on the bed as Dean stood before him.
“I’m working on the kinks.” Sam shrugged.
Dean glanced up at that watching Castiel take a slow deep breath, Dean listened, trusting him as he flowed the calm and easy breathing. Castiel soothingly petting his spine with caring slow strokes. Dean eventually stopped shaking and his grip on Castiel relaxed. Castiel pulled back slightly to see Dean was fighting to keep his eyes open.
“No!” Gabriel laughed.
________________________________________________________________________
“Shut up, he’s not,” She rolled her eyes before lighting up at his approach seeing the food. “For me?!”
Dean stood softly handing the baby to Gabriel. Gabriel took in Atlas taking in the small freckles on his face. Gabriel noticed how much of Dean was in this baby. Little kisses of freckles touched his nose as his long eyelashes blinked up at Gabriel. The baby cooed touching his own face as he made little grunting noises. Gabriel smiled softly petting his cute dirty blonde/light brown hair. Gabriel took the small baby’s hand in his, feeling the baby’s light grip on his finger making noises at Gabriel.
“I’m sorry.” Castiel breathed looking over the freshly wrapped wound. “How did you get a new shirt?”
“Love, he just needs to grab his supplies!” Gabriel spoke holding Castiel trying to calm him. Gabriel rubbed his back with care. “He’s right behind us, I’m sure.” They were jerked roughly but Gabriel held him protectively stopping them from slamming into the carriage wall.
“How long have I been out?” Dean asked as Castiel helped him lay Atlas enough to feed him.
“Might help matters.” Castiel teased as they both laughed. “Besides. I need some ideas to make this place livable. Sure. We can have all the alpha testosterone on board the ship, but having families. Having a livable kingdom can’t be on that large ship.”
“No, I-I don’t want to birth my baby alone-” Castiel choked as Michael gave Lucifer a look.
“I’ll go. I want to tend to your wounds immediately.” Gabriel stated. Sam nodded agreeing with the offer grabbing their bags. “Besides, I’m sure you would want to be clean.” Gabriel took his hands.
“Thank you.” Crowley nodded.
“Hello, Castiel.” The twins spoke as Castiel keeled over holding his chest. “Did we scare you?”
“My...former betrothed is here.” Castiel groaned, shying away as Dean eyed the redhead who walked in.
“...Because their child died.” Dean commented as Castiel blinked surprised. Dean glanced up at him. Did he miss it in Dean’s file?
___________________________________________________________________________
“I’m glad.” Jody breathed.
“So it has some demon in him.” Sam shrugged. “So what if Lucifer got his way.”
“You got yourself good.” The fae explained grabbing the bandages from the chest. “I need to remove the glass.”
“Well, if you want to know, I won’t mind telling you,” Dean stated getting up to make them some hot chocolate. Castiel got up following him to the kitchen watching Dean making the drinks. “There was a kid from the streets I grew attached to-”
“Oh, no. It’s a hobby of mine.” Mary laughed. “I’m telling you, it’s a big booming art trend right now. I’m still a beginner but I’m telling you to invest in some art. It will be worth millions.”
“They had their men come deep inland and take them while on a carriage visit to see her parents. We never thought they would be so bold to come this deep inland...but they did. They took them and I don’t know what else to do. They will kill them if the terms were not agreed to...so I agreed,” Castiel said nothing just staring at the ground as a tear slid down his face.
“Well, here we do,” Dean stated kneeling down to him softly patting his knee. “How about you share my birthday with me if we can’t figure it out,” Dean stated.
“LET HER GO!” Charlie whispered with a raspy pained voice moving to fire at Sam but Sam moved quickly. Charlie didn’t even see him move, he was that fast, as he came up behind her grabbed her from behind. Charlie panicked and screamed but no voice came out as she dropped the stun gun as Sam grabbed her ready to snap her neck.
“Stop?” Chuck growled. “Your king sent a brat to kill me, and you protect him?!”
“...Your brother was in love with Savior…” Castiel whispered holding his hand to his chest.
“The duck thing solidified the divorce tomorrow.” Castiel laughed as Dean nodded understanding.
Dean held back a giggle at his own inside joke innocently as they enjoyed the new gifts. Benny and Joanna really liked the human gifts they were given. They found the human world so fascinating. So even these joke gifts would be cherished.
“Yeah.” The man started sliding his hands through his pocket. “Almost ten years in?” Castiel nodded taking in the information. “Come on, we should get away from this area, you don’t want to be where you died when the time hits you died.”
“DEAN!” Castiel screamed, barely pulling Dean out of the way of a semi on the road, Dean blinked seeing the semi driver honking and cursing at them as he passed. “WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! YOU CAN’T JUST WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!”
Dean forced Castiel into his arms as Dean held him close with one arm. Using the shirt he had used to slid across the rope before they landed on the ground Dean took the brunt as Castiel shook in his arms. Dean whistled to the horse who got the hint bolting away from the mudslide. Dean carried Castiel bridal style once Dean’s hands were free.
“Because I’m a cop.” The man started before he paused realizing the present tense. “...I
“W...What do you mean?” Castiel choked, he swallowed but the hardness in his throat made him feel like he was choking.
“For Gabriel’s birthday. They even got VIP.” Dean winked at Gabriel who blushed harder. “Did I blow your cover?”
“Sh-” Dean called as the floor collapsed under him sucking him into the dark abyss.
“Agreed, But we need a distraction to get him off the boat safely, they are watching him like a hawk,” Dean explained as Sam nodded. “Besides, I got to get past the lock, I need time. Be ready to go when I say.”
“Of course.” Dean smiled. “Have fun.” Cain slid his hand into Jimmy’s as they walked out of the house to their rental car. Dean’s smile faded as he turned to his father eyeing the gun upset.
“Why?” Gabriel asked as Sam chuckled kissing his shoulder affectionately.
“...Yeah,” Castiel admitted.
“...Castiel...do you know when Gabriel was born?” Dean asked as Castiel blinked confused.
Castiel eyed the warehouse he hadn’t seen in almost a year, glancing at it around to make sure no one was being too noisy to undo the lock but the combination lock was already taken off. He…must have already arrived. Castiel sucked in the air pulling open the door with a bit of force. Welcoming to the lights of the old warehouse, he turned closing the door behind him. Closing the latch on the other side to keep people out almost on habit, when he heard something being tossed at him. Castiel turned simply stepping out of the way slightly, only to be hit by the soft hackysack. The hackysack thunked to the ground, pulling Castiel’s eyes towards the direction it was thrown.
Dean...wanted to savor it with him?
“So, does your brother still think you’re going to sell him the photos?” Charlie hummed as Stevie chuckled.
“What did you want?” Castiel asked as the man looked down.
Castiel cringed at his look though, letting out a loving laugh. Castiel’s persona was still being worked on. He went through a hard makeup phase then. Oh, the memories.
“Shit. I am so sorry.” Castiel realized Dean was just standing there as he moved to Dean kissing his forehead. “What do you need?”
“You just hated Dean,” Benny stated.
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
Gabriel breathed at all the changes that happened in his short amount of time in his life. Gabriel’s stomach jolted as he felt the urge to vomit. Gabriel got up moving away from his suitor to vomit roughly into the bushes. Gabriel swallowed down his sickness once he released everything inside. Maybe...Sam was right, he should ask Dean to check on him. A snap of a branch made Gabriel glance up into the forest, seeing a large hell hound. Gabriel choked out in fear as the hellhound grabbed at Gabriel by the neck and shook him like the rabbit. Gabriel couldn’t even get out a whine as he was knocked unconscious.
“Gordon?!” Dean growled upset as Castiel came out wearing Dean’s shirt like a nightgown. “What the hell are you doing here?”
“Where is Deano anyways?” Charlie asked as Sam and Gabriel walked behind them.
Castiel’s eyes fell to the line that Dean had broken to touch him. The line now flat in some areas making a wiggly line. Castiel stared at it sadly before he slowly slid his finger through the gap making the line again. Dean watched him but said nothing before Castiel stood grabbing his shoes and returned to camp. Dean hesitated to follow him, slowly looking down at the line. He stared at it a second longer than he liked to before he walked away. Leaving the line in the sand.
“Dean, almost there!” Sam choked as Charlie ran over to them.
“Well, it should be easy to keep an eye on them seeing as they are a couple,” Dean commented. “Will you follow them home or just chill here or maybe at the police station?”
“It’s okay, I’ll grab it if you can’t.” Sam beamed.
“HELLO?!” Castiel screamed to his neighbors who were nosy and were watching the police from the other side of the street. Tears slid down his face as his panic attack got worse. Castiel moved to them waving his hands in their face and screaming standing in front of them in the middle of the street. They didn’t acknowledge them. “HELLO?! CAN ANYONE SEE ME?! HELLO?!”
Castiel spent time cleaning the glass windows and fixing his sink. He crossed off the two long chores he did that day. It was his day off being a Sunday, he had plans to just stay home and clean his house, as well as get some of his college homework done. He had to finish this essay before Monday when it would be graded by his professor. Castiel sighed sitting at his desk rubbing his face. After hours of getting a couple of words on paper, he got up deciding to get a run in so he could clear his head.
“You must be Castiel.” The woman spoke as Castiel blinked in surprise. “I’m Ellen, Jo’s mother.”
“Hey, how are you feeling?” Castiel asked concerned. “You were coughing blood. Are we too close to your death sight?”
“That’s it,” Sam stated. “...Just talk to him
“Oh…” Castiel choked in surprise. This...wasn’t exactly what he imagined being stuck with a Demon forever. “Okay.” Castiel pulled out his phone and started to google names. “Don’t touch anything.”
“It’s okay, you just got to hold on, I got the steering,” Castiel stated as he ushered the horse to follow his horse. Dean lit up as they rode all day, enjoying the bonding time and the horses. When they came back...the smiles left their faces as Rowena stood waiting for them in her red robes.
Charlie stared at the accident before her, watching as they attempted to retrieve Crowley and his assistant’s bodies. Charlie turned trying not to gag as the crime scene people did their work, having Jessica and another Super pull the truck front back into its old position. Charlie kept putting her hand over her mouth and looking away as chunks fell from the truck.
Castiel turned to his son smiling at Gabriel for his kindness and courage. Gabriel moved to her kneeling down.
She hissed at him.
Gabriel...was sticking up for her?
Hey guys, sorry for the hiatus. I had a lot of family issues come up, not including everyone in my family but me catching covid. I don't want to go into the laundry list of family reasons that happened at once. Everyone seems to be okay, most of healed but my mom is still in the worst of it. I hope I can go back to typing and being a positive outlook for you guys. Sending love.
“I am so happy the most handsome man alive gave our baby the best genes.” Castiel moved to kiss Atlas’s head who made a small noise eating to his heart’s content. Dean couldn’t cup his hand due to the stitches on his palm but he happily held his son’s hand who squeezed it with his little fat hands.
“I-I’m a human too!” Sam said which got more wows.
“Drink!” Alastair chuckled trying to force a drink to Castiel’s lips, Castiel tried to force his face away. Trying to keep from drinking it, worried about the baby if he drank. Alastair’s roughness caused his lip pain as he whimpered.
are asking me if I’m in love with you, Novak?” Dean eyed his face as Castiel shyly nodded. “...If you have to ask, I’m doing a bad job of asking if you wanted to be exclusive…”
“If I do not find someone to marry, I will lose everything.” Castiel snapped standing as he tossed his glass into the fire. “You said this would work.”
“You okay-?” Castiel asked as Dean covered his face turning away as Castiel smiled watching him go before heading back inside.
“I-I was hit on the head with what I think was a branch or something,” Castiel explained to the man. “I-I have to give this to the police.” Castiel moved to storm back to his house.
Dean’s eyes glowed almost instantly, which he squeezed his eyes shut at the sudden feeling of his body’s drastic changes. The nausea and discomfort slowly morphing into heat and lust. The need to impregnate his mate. Tonight would be a lot on all of them. Emotionally and physically. Dean would need him in every single way possible, and Castiel’s virgin body would have to endure a needing alpha going through his normal week of heat in a single night.
“When it’s done, it’s going to look so sweet,” John stated before he touched the hamster’s head. “Anyways, I should go to see my son.”
“Do what?” Castiel choked out, wanting to reverse this conversation from before he spoke. Did...he damaged their relationship?
“B-But I’m not a Fae?” Dean questioned a ball of emotions.
“Where are Castiel Novak and his mate?” The man spoke as Sam looked at him in fear. The man pressed a red button on his watch.
“Maybe we can figure out where he ran off to,” Dean commented moving to his laptop as Castiel leaned against the desk watching him work. Castiel noticed a business card on Sam’s desk in the pen holder on his desk. Castiel tilted his head looking at it before he pulled the card out looking at the card. The card looked worn, but the card was easily recognizable.
Bare footsteps quickly patted down the hall as Leo quickly moved to hide. Leo turned to look down the halls before deciding on the hall towards the girls’ bedroom. Dean softly read to the girls as he was putting them down for a nap. Dean paused his reading seeing Leo trying to find a place to hide but the girls were almost asleep in their separate beds. Dean frowned seeing Leo trying to hide in there.
“...So I’m dead.” Castiel’s voice made the man turn.
__________________________________________________________________________
“You’re a witch, not only just a witch, a witch who needs not speak them to be cast....” The fae gave him a soft smile before yanking it out, Dean cursed in pain holding his ankle. “I know.”
“Another question…who am I?” The Fae asked as the three brothers exchanged looks before the Fae softly passed out again letting go of Dean’s wrist.
“We won’t let anything happen to him,” Michael spoke. “As soon as we are done, we will be on the road again-”
A soft sneeze beside him made Castiel smile and turned to see his best friend and personal guard Dean trying to not die from the attack of a flower that kept tickling his nose. Castiel eyed his freckled face companion who was trying to bat the flower away from his nose but the flower stood firm in its assault.
“Can you open a window?” Castiel begged as the Demon moved to his window trying to open it but it wouldn’t budge. “Mr. Demon, it’s locked, you got to-”
“The person who is wronged fights the one who wronged them,” Roman stated. “Since the king is dead, you may ask one of us to fight in your stead. If you win, you got revenge for the wrong. If you lose, well, you can’t complain about it can you?” Castiel nodded.
Castiel panted in Dean’s arms closing his eyes as Dean touched his face in love.
“C-Cas?” A soft voice called to him as Castiel glanced up. Gabriel stood in the doorway in his eyes wearing boxers and a large t-shirt like a dress, wiping his eyes pouring with tears. Castiel closed the file tossing it back into the drawer lazily. Closing the drawer, he got up walking over to him. Gabriel continued to cry as Castiel kneeled down to him.
“...Yeah.” Castiel nodded.
“You always want to go home.” Castiel smiled moving to kiss him, Dean’s hands slid down his jeans cupping his ass. Castiel let out a most relieved moan.
Dean’s eyes opened slightly to feeling a cold touch to his forehead, Dean blinked softly up at Sam. Sam gave him a soft smile before he put the food down.
“No, I just nanny,” Dean reassured a lie Castiel had come up with if anyone on the outside asked. No one could know they were mated or together. “They gave me the card and put my money onto it.”
Dean feels his protests dwindle away under those earnest blue eyes. “Fine,” he mutters, feeling his face heat. “I’ll wash, you rinse.”
“Dude, don’t worry about it,” Dean says. “She only lives forty-five minutes away, it’s not like we’re driving cross-country to see her. She’ll understand, I promise. And you guys
been hanging out on this plane of existence for a good hundred years or so, but I’m the exception, not the rule.”
"How so?"
“Actually, the colon is approximately five feet long,” Cas says without thinking. “The anus and rectum are only a small part of it. So if you
The stranger glances at him with a crooked little smirk, like he knows something Dean doesn’t. His eyes have a strange, coppery sheen, and for a second they seem to glow.
Castiel looks at him, frowning. "What do you mean? Of course it's your face."
Cas gets into the passenger seat with a dramatic sigh. Dean grins and slides behind the wheel.
“I know it's hard,” he says, ignoring the butterflies suddenly flapping in his stomach. “It's so hard to listen to Jack cry and not be able to help him. And I'm so sorry you're struggling with classes. I didn't realize it had gotten that bad. But Jack does
"Are you all right?" Cas asks. He looks thinner than the last time Dean saw him. His cheeks are hollow, there are dark circles under his eyes, and all traces of his wicked, sly humor seem to have disappeared.
How did he miss
“Eventually.” Charlie licks a dab of salsa off her wrist. “In the meantime, I’m going to thoroughly enjoy the shitshow that is Dean’s first boy crush. It’s all kinds of adorable.”
"We're definitely not." The young man keeps walking.
Cas implores. “Will you
Dean stares and stares and
“I did.” Castiel looks away, into the flames. “You were still young, probably eleven or twelve years old. And you were still just as brave and kind as you were at the age of eight. Your soul shone so brightly that all others looked dull in comparison.”
“Uh huh. And how long are you planning on ‘helping him out?’”
in his entire life.
"That's good," Cas says.
“Everyone's family is fucked up in its own way,” Mary says mildly. “Cas and Gabe just have to decide if we’re the right kind of fucked up for them.”
Very carefully, he slides one hand under the raven’s breast and the other under its tail, scoops it up, and cradles it to his chest. It’s heavier than he expected.
“You’re my brother, I’ll call you whatever I want,” Dean replies, flopping down beside Sam and patting the cushion next to him. “Sit down, Cas. Have some pizza.”
“Oh.” Cas looks down at himself, then glances at Dean. “Yes, I suppose I do.” And then, oh sweet Lord, he smiles, a soft, almost shy thing that makes Dean literally go weak in the knees. Jesus. He has
His doppleganger seems equally flabbergasted. "I could ask you the same thing," Dean says, eyeing him critically. "Why am I in a three-piece suit?"
"Meg," Dean says, ignoring the hunter who's now sputtering incoherently, "do we have surveillance cameras?"
Manuel spreads his hands. "That's what I'm saying. Lotta people come in here like, 'Man, I was just in that club, and now I can't hear shit.'"
"Oh. Okay." Dean gives him a tentative smile. "I wasn't sure. You seem kinda shell shocked."
Cas snorts. “He’s been on his tummy for a good fifteen minutes. You can probably roll him over now.”
is at stake. I could lose my
“Well, start thinking about it.” Dean wipes off the counter, then leans against it, arms folded. “You’ve been working hard, you should blow off some steam.” His face lights up. “Hey, you should come with me and Charlie to the Majestic tomorrow. It’s Nineties Night.”
Yeah, things are going great. The only problem is that Dean's sex drive is now through the fucking roof. With everything that's been going on, he's mostly too busy or tired to even think about sex, but now that he's spending so much time with Cas, it's getting harder (heh) to ignore the urge.
as Glitter Face's body hits pavement. Abuela tightens her grip.
me. You want to hold my hand and bring me flowers and ask me to prom."
“Damn it.” Dean raises his eyes to the ceiling, willing his erection to stand down. “My life officially sucks.”
So of course, when Ellen and Bobby’s annual “Christmas at the Roadhouse” shindig rolls around, Dean does the smart thing. He gets a sitter for the night and invites Cas to come along.
"Dean?" he calls. "Are you okay?" No answer. Cas waits another few seconds, listening. He thinks he can hear Dean muttering, but it's too far away to be sure.
He grins and resumes ripping Dean's shirt until it's in two pieces and lying on the floor beside the bed. Then he sits back on his heels and stares at Dean's upper body, licking his lips. Dean tries to think of a quip to break the tension, but his brain is completely blank as he stares into those hypnotic blue eyes.
"Charming," Cas says dryly. "Well, you're going to have to fake it for a while, because I have back-to-back meetings all morning."
"Castiel," Cas says, trying not to be disappointed that Dean doesn't remember him. "We met at a house party freshman year. You were very drunk."
Dean feels a little awkward. Cas just saved him from getting ganked by demons, but apparently Cas is
“We’ll take my car,” Gabe says.
“Falling,” Castiel says softly. “I remember falling.”
He slams the bathroom door and leans up against it, taking deep breaths. Fuck. Fuck, he can’t do this. He can’t keep living like this, alongside Cas with no hope of being anything more than a friend. He just can’t. He knows that now. Cas is the sweetest, stubbornest, gentlest guy in the entire world, and he deserves so much more than Dean can give him. There’s a better guy out there, someone mature and sophisticated and cultured. Cas should be with
"Perfect." Dean slides his hands down Cas' back and hooks his thumbs into the waistband of his pajama pants. "Okay if I pull these down?"
“Sorry.” Dean heaves himself out of bed. “You guys stay here. I’m gonna go see what’s up. It’s probably just a tree branch. Either that or the squirrels finally unionized.”
“Yeah, because I’ve had
any monsters." Dean smirks. "Sounds like you just ran around screaming like a little girl."
Dean. I… you're… oh God, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize..."
"Cas," Dean says calmly, “shut the fuck up.”
Dean doesn't. He sucks Castiel to completion (Castiel makes a few noises he didn't know he was physically capable of making) and swallows his release greedily, slurping and making a big show of smacking his lips. Castiel rolls his eyes at the ridiculous display, but secretly he's glad Dean feels comfortable enough to let his guard down like this.
“Thanks, buddy,” Dean says. “Now, you guys need to go back to bed. No arguments.”
His insides churn at the thought of picking up those tiny, lifeless forms and throwing them on a pyre. Adult victims are one thing, but kids… Dean doesn't know if he has the balls.
Gabe smirks, his lips stained red and green from the candy. "Keep telling yourself that, hot stuff."
"I'm not gonna wake him up. I just wanna hold him. He's my
He misses his mom.
an arrogant bastard."
5:16 PM: Castiel threatens to confiscate Dean's pen if he doesn't stop clicking it. Dean sulks and starts fidgeting with a pencil instead.
“Yeah, you know…” Dean takes a deep breath. Might as well rip the band-aid off before they start ripping off clothes. “I don’t really do casual dating, Cas. Not anymore. If I’m gonna be with someone, I need to know they’re gonna… stick around.”
“Damn it, Cas.” Dean closes his eyes, because the sight of Cas’ swollen, kiss-bitten lips is
"How dare you," he growls. "How
"I assure you, they are." Cas takes out the strange, silver blade again and turns it over in his hands. "This is the type of weapon they use. It's the only thing I brought with me when I left Heaven. Obviously it's a bit banged up after spending a thousand years in Hell." He lets out a humorless laugh. "Just like its owner."
His dad shoots him a few sideways glances when Dean talks about school, and Dean knows he's trying to figure out what's not being said, but John Winchester is even better at avoiding shit than his eldest son, so he doesn't comment. He just hugs Dean hard when he leaves and mumbles something about being careful and "don't do anything I wouldn't do." Dean mumbles something equally vague back, and then he's boarding the train. Sometimes he wishes he could take Baby to school, but parking in L.A. is expensive and car thefts are commonplace, so she stays at home.
“Are you magic?” Jack asks, awestruck.
“Shit,” Cas groans, running his hands through his hair and making it stand straight up. Dean stifles a grin at how insane he looks right now. “I’m not even halfway done with my paper and it’s due tomorrow.”
“Missouri, please,” Sam begs. “Just let us explain.”
Slowly, Cole turns back around, jaw clenched. "Sorry," he mutters, not looking at Cas.
out. Instinctively Dean moves a few steps forward, partially shielding Cas from his father.
Dean takes a deep breath.
He is. He’s got his hands wrapped around Cas’ neck and he’s practically
Dean can’t answer for a second, because holy
“No.”
“I don’t like where this is going,” Dean mutters.
"You ever wanna practice, you come here, okay?"
So he goes to class, does his homework, gets drunk at a couple parties, lather, rinse, repeat. He goes down to visit Dad and Sam one weekend and they do all the usual shit— fire up the grill, watch the game, talk about Sam's college applications, what's been going on with Bobby, Dean's plans after graduation. Everything except what really matters.
bite your face off."
"Yes," Castiel squeaks, then clears his throat. "Just… haven't had my coffee yet."
“Fuck.” Castiel’s head thumps back against the pillow. “Well, don’t let me interrupt.”
“I’m sure you are, Dean.”
Dean nods, and Castiel goes back to fingering him. He fits three fingers in, then four, and thrusts them in and out of Dean's hole until he's letting out a nonstop stream of squeals and whines and shocked little gasps that go straight to Castiel's dick. Finally he eases his fingers out and Dean makes an unhappy sound, his asshole clenching on empty air.
Dean shrugs, his face getting warmer by the second. “It’s been a while,” he admits. “And to be honest, I’m not totally sure we’re on the same page.”
But Castiel asks none of these things, just continues to rinse dishes and stack them in the drainer. Maybe he doesn’t care enough to ask. And why would he? Dean and Ben and Jack are strangers to Castiel, just a pit stop on the bizarre trip he’s taking. Here today, gone tomorrow.
Someone raps sharply on the conference room's glass wall. Castiel looks up to see Sam gesturing at him, pointing to his watch with an impatient frown. "Shit. That's Sam. Oh God. I can't do this, Dean. I'm going to be sick, I—"
"You look so good, pretty boy," he says. "So good with my big cock splitting you open. You like taking it up the ass, don't you?"
"Cas and Jack ain't going anywhere," Benny says. "You got a problem with it, there's the door."
“I know.” Dean gets out of the car, walks around to the passenger side, and opens the door. Cas frowns at him with that cute little squint that makes him look like a confused owl, and Dean has an insane urge to kiss him— right here, right now, in front of all the little old ladies and hordes of schoolchildren and everybody else visiting the gardens on a Thursday afternoon.
“Take care,” Dean says as he lets Sam go. “See you soon.”
Sam thinks as his mouth drops open.
trying
Still tentative, Cas asks, “So things should go back to normal now?”
come (idiot), like he’s grateful. Like maybe there’s about to be a repeat of that moment in the Bunker before...
Only Dean would say something as stupid as that. It isn’t like an ordinary human’s kidney can just be “strong enough” to withstand a solid iron nail.
“Yes, I made a few changes. There are no more walls, no more reliving memories forever. Bobby, your parents, the Harvelles, everyone... they’re all here for you.”
Sam wants to scream.
When Dean arrives in heaven, his first thought is, “Son of a bitch.”
Dean coughs. “Yeah, well, I’m not too good at using ‘em yet, so mind your face.” He looks a bit nervous as he speaks.
He truly thought he’d never see Dean again. He has to have used up all of his God-given chances at living by now. There is no reason he should be worthy of another. And yet, here he is, seeing Dean like it’s for the first time. And Dean is seeing Castiel’s true form for the first time through angel eyes, too.
Light fills the room for an instant. Behind Dean, Sam sees a black shadow on the wall.
“Yes and no.” Jack smiles enigmatically. “I need your help.”
Dean’s eyes open, and he winks. “Well you see, there’s this thing humans call kissing,” he starts, and Cas immediately cuts him off with a laugh. Moving his hand to cup Dean’s chin, Cas tilts Dean’s mouth towards his as Dean leans in.
He is in the Bunker, stock still under an onslaught of pounding at the door, every knock an inexorable strike that shatters the silence and shakes his bones in his skin. He feels locked in his body, a puppet forced to repeat the same tired lines, even as his whole being is clamouring,
“Is what you said when you said – you know – true?” Dean asks, hoping the ache isn’t obvious in his voice.
Yeah, that’s definitely the reason Sam’s feet are leading him to quietly tiptoe to his own bedroom instead of his mouth letting loose a string of devastating banter.
. God, Dean hopes so, but he doesn’t know how to make it happen.
No one could ever guess that it’s the joy of two angels, made tangible in the sky.
“You’re an angel,” Sam breathes in the dark. He flips on the light on the table, which had mercifully been off at the time Dean pulled his little bulb exploding stunt.
Cas is sitting beside him and their feet are dangling off into space. The sun is beginning to set, sending rays of orange and pink across the horizon and the earth below them. There, the ground is just a hazy blur, God knows how many miles down, and yet Dean isn’t scared.
Eyes – open – light – streaming down white – pain – radiating – joy – love – a hand on his body – in his being – warmth – blackness – pushed back like a curtain – a song – a voice – a face – grace, grace, grace –
“So.” He coughs. “If you’re game to teach an old dog new tricks, then go –” Dean cuts off an understated
“I suppose I should come too?” Cas’s voice is tentative as he shoots a glance at Dean and then looks away.
A shadow of wings.
“Hey, kid,” he says, opening his arms. Jack doesn’t move away, his posture remaining open. That’s enough invitation for Dean to lean in and give him a hug, which Jack accepts.
Dean surrounding him, leaving no room for the fear that this is another dream.
His name?
“Nice place you got here,” Dean says, giving Jack a pat on the back and stepping away.
Gabriel. Gadreel. Anna. Metatron. Balthazar. All of them are bastards in their own ways, but some of them could be good to have around. The ones who don’t have dangerous personal agendas, who died because they tried to do good but fucked it up somehow.
“Truthfully, me neither. I saw it solely as a way of getting places, but I’m revising that position,” Cas says, and Dean smiles. He sees Cas’s hands lying loosely in his lap and is struck by the sudden urge to reach out to him. Instead, he looks away.
“Can I – can I save Cas? Can I get him out of the Empty?”
“Okay.” Dean tightens his grip on Castiel’s shoulder, raising his free hand to grip Castiel’s waist. Castiel mirrors him.
After he’s come back and changed the bulb on the table, he sees his abandoned beer bottle and takes a little sip. This time when it goes down, it feels light on the spirit, easing him into his relief.
Dean winces. “Been doing this for less than 24 hours. Brain still hasn’t finished processing all the new stuff that’s been crammed in it. I don’t know how to taste a molecule yet, let alone time travel or whatever. Don’t ask how I got here. Flying’s the one thing I got figured out and I hate it.”
With a sigh, Sam resigns himself to spending part of his evening changing all the lightbulbs. If only he could angel-proof the damn things. He uses the light on his phone to get himself out of the room and into the supplies.
The Empty is the place where angels go to die. Dean is an angel now.
Tears once again threaten, but Sam blinks them back and says in a rough voice, “You’re an asshole. Jack is an asshole. You let me think you were fucking dead,
The lights go out fully, the shadow disappears.
Castiel’s heart is bursting and his mouth is full of questions, but he trusts in Dean and simply says, “Yes.”
, he wants to say. Instead, he swallows. “Yeah, I know, they’re kindof an endangered species.”
Cas smiles, and when Dean looks at him he sees the same love he saw when Cas confessed to him shining out of Cas’s face, making him more radiant than his grace ever could. Tenderly – there’s no other way to describe it – Cas says, “Every single word.”
And more than that: Castiel is sitting beside him, looking newly youthful and at ease. So Dean’s mission was successful. Despite himself, Sam can’t help but feel warm and misty that his little family is whole once more.
There’s Jack. Jack, who is God now, apparently. There’s just enough difference in him from when he
good.” Now the words are tumbling out uncontrollably. “I know the reason I took this angel gig is ‘cause I couldn’t stand life, let alone a damn eternal afterlife if it didn’t have you in it. I know... we both know I’ve never been with anyone like... like you, like, you know, a
Well, it sounds like Dean. Sam, still laughing, backs away from Dean into the library so that he can grab the bottle from the table behind him and takes a drink.
“Go back to the Bunker. I promised Sam I’d be his guardian angel. And Jack said monster hunting was okay as long as there are no human witnesses to any angel smiting,” Dean explains, wondering where this is going.
Yet all of Castiel’s attention is focussed on Dean, who he’s supporting as fully as if he were carrying him in his arms. This close, it’s easy for Castiel to feel what Dean is feeling: a combination of mingled fear-discomfort-anxiety.
On the balcony in front of the open doorway, looking down at him is a familiar silhouette. The knife slips out of his hand and onto the floor with a clatter, and Sam gives a shaky laugh.
He is
Dean loves him. He loves Cas, he loves Cas, he loves him. His taste, his smell, his being, his essence. He opens his mouth and lets Cas in, dances with him again. As the two melt into each other Dean becomes vaguely aware that their wings are streaming out behind them. There are rainbow lights in the sky, beautiful and vivid against the blackness of night, streaming out amongst the stars. He dismisses the sight, believing he’s seeing Cas’s wings surrounding them.
“It’s really me,” Dean says, holding up his hands defensively, old song and dance that started with a trickster and a never-ending Tuesday and is somehow concluding with this.
It feels right to hear those words. Dean’s been Sam’s guardian angel all his life already, but Sam doesn’t say that. Instead, he smiles fondly.
“You know we’re family. The Bunker is your home.”
Dean starts with a scowl, cuts himself off and turns his attention to the scenery. Trees, grass, road, and the impression of distant, sunset mountains. As he stands there, he begins to calm. Heaven is vast, but in a way that feels freeing rather than overwhelming. Safety and peace seem to be baked into the very air.
“Yeah, I can think of a couple,” Dean agrees.
Sam wipes his face on his shoulder and lifts the bottle to his lips. But before he can drink, he shoots up in shock as he hears the front door opening behind him.
“Didn’t know flying could be that much fun,” Dean admits.
“No, nothing like that. Uh... you’re not gonna believe this, but Jack gave me an upgrade, I guess you could say.”
He doesn’t. “I’ll negotiate a bit with the Shadow. I’d like Heaven to be on good terms with the Empty, and I have a feeling it will be eager to be rid of all Winchesters, if nothing else.”
with me, Cas.”
“Sam?”
Jack’s lingering smile vanishes, and he’s suddenly all business again. “Then let’s go.”
should’ve
“Right, right. You deserve it for dying on me.” Sam raises an eyebrow. “So, you’re gonna stick around?”
Dean’s stomach lurches.
Letting himself into the Bunker, Sam immediately notices some things have been changed since he left that morning, and knows he has a visitor. There are some doors open where they should be closed and vice versa, and some suspicious crumbs and moved items in the kitchen. He left the wards off for Dean, but of course, it could be anything that’s gotten through them. Sam tenses, fearing a supernatural intruder while at the same time hoping against hope that Dean has come safely home.
Jack’s little speech has zero effect on Dean whatsoever, since he’s seen Cas eat, sleep, and breathe all the time,
As he’s contemplating going into the Roadhouse to see if it’s as empt– vacant as it looks, he senses a presence beside him in the corner of his eye, and turns.
Confused, Dean says, “Then why in the hell would I want things to be normal?”
“Off Centennial Highway. Near Jericho. California,” Dean says, answering the original question.
eat, you’ll taste every molecule. If you do sleep, your dreams won’t always be your own. Think about it.”
Doesn’t everybody. Jack is a special case, of course. But it’s good to know he’s still good for something even after the great nail life failure of 2020.
And yet.
Tears gather in his eyes at the thought of Dean. They were supposed to be able to write the rest of their lives together. But Dean went and
“The ghost who couldn’t go home – where did we find her?” The hint was vague, but this was a hunt the real Dean would never be able to forget. It was Sam’s first hunt after going to Stanford, their first attempt to find their missing dad.
Their flight slows as Dean concentrates more on precision and following Castiel where he goes than simply moving through the planes. The Earth is laid out below them, a blur of brown, green, and grey, while above them stretches the vast blue sky. Together they dart and flit and dance through that sky, and flying feels more like
Dean’s wings begin to open. To Castiel, who can see them as more than just shadows, they’re jet black shot through with neat streaks of silver.
But the being that is Dean now extends far beyond his vessel. Castiel’s breath catches, his whole form stills, to see how Dean is greater than he’s ever been before. An angel, like him.
“What?” Sam’s eyes narrow.
The door to Dean’s room is cracked open. Stealth mode engaged, Sam peeks inside to see his errant, dead, angelic (hardly) brother, sitting on the bed and watching TV. Immediately, Sam feels like all the breath has returned to his body at once.
Although making pretend gagging noises is a tempting option, Sam can’t bring himself to do it now. Dean just died and came back and went to the Empty and came back again. Sam can’t begrudge him the peace of the moment – and does he detect a cheerful twinkle of protective murderous instinct in Castiel’s eye?
