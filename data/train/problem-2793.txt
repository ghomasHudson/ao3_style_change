"Another part of the deal. Amara and the Entity both share a connection through darkness. She wanted to explore that connection, so she gave me her powers and joined the rogue Angels who I bargained for Cas with." Jack explained.
"Dean, you need to get to the Bunker. You'll never believe who's here." Sam said. Dean did as Sam said and he and Cas dressed quickly and drove at high speed in the impala to the Bunker.
"That's right, Father. Prince Castiel has him here. He definitely plans to mate him." Thomas talked through a cup of blood he always keeps to contact long distance.
Dean uncovers a secret book in the Men of Letters bunker recording everyone from Henry and his family to Mary's side of the family.
"Oh-okay, Dad. But you don't have to act like a caveman. I know I'm still your baby, but you gotta remember. He's still tender from ten years ago and you're starting to act a bit too much like William Petersen in Fear with Reese Witherspoon. Relax, don't be Tony Danza or I'll have to fly off to Europe after my Prom night." Emma eased Dean and even if he did get those references, he still couldn't help it.
“I hear the barn we first met in is being condemned.” Cas said. “We may buy the property and build a nice acreage where I can keep an apiary and Dean can start a garage.” Cas offered. “Maybe I can even grow peanuts and make my own peanut butter.” Just as he said that, Jack gave Cas the gift of Human feelings for food and such, not needing to give him love as Dean had already taught him how to love. Another thing he did before leaving for Heaven was what Amara had done for Dean.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Busy, but warm. We're like a big family here." Lucifer emphasized by hugging his new future brother-in-law. All of a sudden though, Dean pulled away the moment he saw a family friend he never thought he'd see again.
"Don't leave me again, please. I never want to say goodbye to you again." Dean said as Cas soon entered the younger man. Both men gasped as Dean began to thrust against him. Cas pressed his face to Dean's neck and their hands began to intertwine as Cas started moving inside of Dean. They locked eyes and in that moment, their hearts began to beat as one.
"I like how crunchy the crust is. The contrast of the textures between the filling and the crust makes me feel fuzzy in a good way." Samandriel said as he took another bite.
"Home crap home." Lucifer snarked again. Castiel sighed and sent his horse, a white camarillo named Blade, to the stable. Lucifer's horse, Frostbite was guided the same place as the two entered the entrance to the castle.
"What do you-" He smelled Dean and suddenly understood. "Oh no. Your father didn't." Robert started to boil.
"Ash, I heard you're back on Earth." Dean said. "How'd you get my number? I changed it after the Leviathans framed Sam and me for murder."
"This is perfect." Cas said as he began to undress. Just you and me, no Crowley or Sam breathing down our necks. No Bobby being upset about you being a Demon."
"Hannah's bringing in Metatron. She said he's finally willing to let us know where my grace is." Cas said.
"The black-haired dude, bowlegged and kinda looks like Michael Buble?" The jeweler asked. Cas nodded.
"Dean." Cas said as he looked up into his best friend's eyes. Just then though, he heard Sam gasping for breath and looked over at him on the floor.
"Taste and see. And that better be the only sample of the roast you take, the rest is for your parents." Cas said as he put a piece of maple bacon in Dean's mouth. Dean filthily and sinfully moaned into the piece of bacon and smiled.
"Sit in the room and I shall explain." Castiel said. Charles and Naomi did as their son ordered and sat on their thrones. Once Samandriel and Anna appeared, Samandriel smiled.
"No, I not only care about Sam, Ezekiel. Cas is family to me too. To Sam, and I thought he used to be family to you." Dean scolded.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"My aunt. Well, great-aunt. Dean released her when he killed Death. Then Castiel killed a reaper named Billie, who became the new Death. She hated Sam and Dean and wanted to kill them." Jack said. "Amara's taking over my duties as God until I get back. We binded to each other after I absorbed God's powers. Kinda retribution for killing me previously."
"It takes time for potions like these, Fergus. I told you that when you were a wee lad, curious about my work. And is Dean back from his date yet?" Rowena asked.
"We need to watch a lot of television and movies to catch you up." Dean said as he nuzzled Cas's temple. "I'll even make you more mixtapes. From the Beatles to Elvis to even Eric Clapton. "Tears in Heaven" needs to be skipped though because it's sad. He wrote it after his son fell out of a window at the hotel room they were all staying in. I'm not letting you go, Angel." Dean kissed Cas's palm and petted his hair.
"HahahaHAH! Alright, buddy. Hi, I missed you too. Where's your collar? Where's Emma, Miracle?" Dean asked.
Dean had bought an acoustic guitar and taught himself to play for the next time he'd see Cas. Eric Clapton wasn't really his cup of tea, but he was Beatles adjacent as George had taught the guy how to play. This was a way for him to show Cas further he cared about Cas and Cas alone.
"Dean, I think I'm ready." Cas said as Dean nuzzled him and began lubing himself up. Then he slowly entered Cas and they began to make out. Between kisses, Cas gasped as Dean pushed deeper into his Angel inch by inch. "DEAN!" Cas gasped out once Dean was completely inside his Angel.
"I missed you too." Cas said. "I have a surprise for you." Cas then pulled out a box and Dean opened it to reveal it was the necklace, then Dean felt in his jacket pocket to feel nothing inside. Then he took a second look at the necklace to see there were gems inside it now.
Dean made the first move to pick Cas up in his arms as they fell in the bed on the crescendoed refrain of the first verse of "Unchained Melody" and slowly entered Cas as the older man wrapped his legs around the Winchester's hips. Dean kissed Cas's neck and whispered sweet nothings to him as they got further. "Dean, I'm close." Cas gasped out as Dean pushed deeper into him on the falsettoed need in "I need your love". Right then, they climaxed and Dean kissed Cas deeply as he rolled over so Cas could straddle him while they made out. As the song played out, they locked hands, touched foreheads and Eskimo kissed.
"He/she can't be here. Dean has a policy against dogs being in construction areas for the cars." Claire said.
"NO!" Dean screamed. But just then, black ooze popped out of Cas's stomach, sending them both into Purgatory temporarily.
"Courage, this tree is even bigger and grander than the first tree you grew." Muriel said as she patted Courage on the head.
"Hey, what about me?" Ellen asked when she walked over with some lemonade. "I missed you just as much." Ellen joined in the hug and Dean hugged her even tighter.
"Tempting as that is, I can't remember the last time we made love." Dean said as he pushed Cas's shirt off and kissed his chest, brushing lush lips against his fiancee's nipples.
"Ground lamb, I think jimmy would've preferred lamb to beef. Has a better texture." Dean said. Sam sighed.
“Oh PLEASE stop.” The Entity begged as he pounded into the floor. “You’ve been drowning yourselves in each other’s pleasure and vice versa since you got here. You have GOT to stop sooner or later.” The Entity began to cry and plead.
Once again, Michael's sword had worked its' way into Castiel's hands. Even if Castiel didn't want it to be in his hands, it still found it's way to him. Before Michael could discover what had happened though, the sword began merging itself with Castiel's Grace, spinning it into its' powerful glint like a cotton candy machine. Gabriel walked in to check on Castiel as he hadn't heard from him in some time when he watched the merge. Once it had finished and Castiel collapsed to the floor, he gasped. Gabriel ran over.
"Then I'll have a peanut butter burger on a brioche bun that's been honey buttered if you have honey butter, my fiancee will have a peanut butter and bacon panini and we'll share a peanut butter milkshake." Cas said as he handed over his menu and Dean's. Dean kissed Cas's hand.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Cassie, he's not worth it. Come on, we're leaving early. Dean, I got everything you have left, I can't save the stuffing remains of your horse, though. I'm sorry." Lucifer comforted Dean and he nodded. Castiel walked Dean out and took Dean's things from Lucifer. Just as they were walking out though, Lucifer smacked Naomi hard. "That's for being a cold heartless bitch to my future brother-in-law and this!" He punched her chin. "Is for his stuffed animal. Now wear your damage along with mine." He then threw the remains of Impi into Naomi's face. "You have a GREAT taste in women, Chuck." Lucifer quipped one last time before walking Cas and Dean to the horses before heading home.
"I LOVE pie." Dean said as Muriel served up a piece for Dean, then started making her special dog food. "Blue ribbon dog food is a special secret recipe." She said. She then served the dog food for both Courage and Miracle.
"Well, I'll be in my trailer." Jared said as he walked off in an attempt not to disturb Misha and Jensen. When they broke apart for air, Jensen was the first to speak.
"You did what you thought was right, Dean. Even if it ended up wrong, you did what you thought was right and that's all that matters. C'mon, let's not do Chicago dogs tonight for dinner. We'll go out for dinner instead at the Roadhouse." Cas said as he and Dean walked out to the Impala. Once outside, they were shocked to see Jacob's Studebaker with Jacob and Emma making out.
"He might as well enjoy himself before we begin. This next part's gonna be painful for him. Boss wants to know everything." April said as Barbara nodded in agreement.
"Sam told me about the house. I'm expecting you to invite us to dinner some night. Or at least we are officially inviting you." John said.
"Mmm, that looks like Dean's corn beef hash that he sometimes makes in the bunker." Jack said as he took a soup spoonful of the dog food.
"Night, Death. And thanks." Dean said. He walked Back over to where Cas had disappeared and sighed. Bobby walked over to him and patted the younger man on the shoulder.
"It's them." Cas called up to Dean as he let Adam and Michael inside. "Hi, guys." Cas said. "Would you like some water before we head to that diner?"
"You really are Dean Winchester." Misha said. "And all that you've told me is real." All Dean could do was nod.
"Anniversary?" Dean asked. Then he remembered, Cas telling Dean he loved him. His body began to wrack with grief and guilt as he sank down and began to cry. Sam and Eileen looked at each other. Then they signed to each other. Suddenly, a flap of wings came into earshot and a voice began to boom.
"I'm gonna buy five pounds of chicken later." Dean said as he turned to Airfry. "Eat the Impala, and I'll look for Excalibur's stone and open you up like a Tonton." Airfry nodded and licked Dean's face again, Dean not being able to keep a straight face.
"Castiel." Dean began, flashing back on what he was telling him as a lure from that night. "We need you for a little powwow here, so come on down." Dean recited by heart.
"Miracle?" Dean asked and Miracle, after finishing her meal, jumped up and leaped into Dean's arms. Dean giggled as Miracle licked his face.
"Night, guys." Adam said as he and Michael flew off. Dean and Cas then retired to their home, petted Miracle, who welcomed them home with a big, slobbery kiss and brushed their teeth before dressing for bed. Then Cas, as part of his nightly routine, took off his engagement ring so nothing happened to it while he slept and tucked into bed beside Dean for the night. They hoped to see Adam and Michael at the wedding, whenever they decided the date would be. In the meantime, they were content to just be together, enjoying the engagement itself. They would figure out the rest later.
"I STILL DIED A VIRGING BECAUSE OF YOU!!!!!" Nancy roared, tears in her eyes. Dean shot the witness and she disappeared.
"He healed me with a single touch." Cas said as Dean nodded. "And after?" Dean gulped when Cas asked.
"I can fill in the blanks." Dean said. "The ghoul you ganked had children. A brother and sister who killed Adam, then killed Kate. Then they impersonated Adam and Kate in order to draw us in and kill us since you were already dead."
"We found Miracle shortly after the incident." Dean admitted. "She needed a new home after everyone left. But then Chuck disappeared her and then Jack and Amara absorbed his powers and she and Jack merged into each other to become the new God.
"Thank you, your majesties, I'm very honored to be given such gifts from you. As a virtual stranger, I-" He was cut off.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You're gonna love living in Thunderlief, Dean. We're all equals. Four Betas are at a station at a time, one Alpha per four Betas per station. Cassie runs an Apiary and we all take turns caring for horses, cows and other farm animals. Cas has a real knack for Animal husbandry. Don't you, Cas?" Lucifer asked excitedly. Cas blushed.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"No, otherwise, I'd have made more than just soup." Dean said as he went over to the front door and saw Garth in the driveway.
"Alright, I'll save you a brewsky." Ash said and they disconnected, then Ash texted Dean with the GPS coordinates for where the roadhouse was being rebuilt.
"She felt amazing, it was like I was actually losing my virginity." Cas got hot in the face as he explained it.
"Hi, I'm Emma. Thank you so much for the car. How'd you know I was in the market for a Bel-Air?" Emma asked.
"I had to stop a few times to pee." Michael said. "Apparently, Aunt Amara gifted me the ability to taste, use the restroom and other Human functions. Adam taught me to love though." Michael sighed.
"I know he is. My brother wanted him to experience the old kids' shows we used to watch when we were little. Like Magilla, Secret Squirrel and the like." Castiel said. "Castiel Novak by the way." He reached out to shake Dean's hand.
"You've already given me your love in return for mine to you." Cas said and it made Dean gush. Inside the box was Billie's Death ring.
"Had to forego it, Sam threw it away. Damn shame too, I paid a lot of money for that bacon. Just because I'm a Demon doesn't mean I can't eat pork products." Dean huffed and Cas giggled.
"I think it should look like Jill's Nomad on Home Improvement. It was her dream car." Emma said. "And then the next car is a Studebaker. The client's mother is an Amy Pond? Funny, must be a Whovian." Emma said as she was eating lunch. "Mom wanted me to get into Doctor Who for a while, but I'm not really into that show. I understand those who are into it? But it's just not for me."
"Impi. I'm so sorry, my baby." He cried, heartbroken and downtrodden. He prayed that things would get better over time.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Dean, don't you remember?" Sam asked. Dean frowned. Sam gave his famous "I know something you don't know" smirk. "Dean, it's your anniversary."
"My hair!" She yelled as Jack managed to knock off her wig. "I'm Ugly! UGLYYYYYYYYYHYYYYHYYYYYYYYYYYY!" Eustace's mother ran off ashamed of her baldness.
"The sword was forged the day he had been made by father. Perhaps a magnetic bond had happened when they came out at the same time." Gabriel explained.
"Djinn poison, it's slowly killing him." Dean realized. Ezekiel touched Cas's forehead and fell down, his energy zapped, he collapsed just as Cas instantly sprung back to life, healthy and happy to see Dean and Sam.
"The V-8 of a Corvette. She deserves the best." Dean said as he pulled out a box for Cas. "Just as you do." He pulled Cas to him again and opened the box to show him the new gift.
"You can take it with you, and Cas? It's actually pronounced Sasparilla. You don't have to read it out as it's spelled." Dean explained. Cas then grew bright red and promised not to make such a mistake as that again.
"Yep. It's more than just samples, it's a bakery display. Clean up and I'll show you." Cas said as he kissed Dean back. Dean agreed and went to clean off. "So what engine did you put inside Baby?" Cas asked curiously.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cas is back and Dean clings to him the whole time. Meanwhile, Rowena comes by with Shirley to explain about the first tree and the current tree.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Well, you gonna hug me or what, ya idjit?" Bobby said as he saw Dean and smiled. Dean ran up to Bobby faster than the Flash ran to his mom as a toddler and hugged him so tightly, Bobby's breath had escaped him temporarily. Cas smiled and got out of the car before going up to shake Karen's hand.
Not gonna be shy about it, sometimes it's hard to spell hors d'oeuvres, so I have no choice to spell it phonetically by spelling hors d'oeuvres as orderves. If it drives people crazy, I'm sorry. Please continue reading though?
"I'd like that. Dean definitely would, that I know." Cas said as he watched Dean happy crying on Bobby's shoulder, Bobby beginning to grow emotional as well.
"It's part of our job as monster hunters." Dean said. Courage was still unsure, he just thought back to when he was found by Muriel after the evil vet shot his parents into outer space. For the first time since he was a puppy, he felt alone and began to cry.
"Hello." Misha started, in his Cas voice. Dean sighed heavily as he heard Misha use his Cas voice. But he held it together. They went at the scene until they got to Cas telling Dean the moment of truth.
"Sorry, got excited. My favorite baby brother's getting married and to my favorite Human's the one making an honest Angel out of him." Gabriel said as he wheeled the trolley in. "Now we got our cream cakes, pie cakes as they're VERY trendy, your cheesecakes, red velvet, devil's food, Angel food, black forest, better than sex, tres leches, boston cream pie, basically any and all cakey confectionery you can dream of eating. Dean home?" Gabriel asked.
"OOH, I didn't know it was gonna rain today." Muriel said. Dean frowned and looked at Courage, who was shaking.
"Sounds good." Cas said as he pulled Dean into the living room and sat him down, then sat in Dean's lap.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Obviously, he didn't expect Crowley to hear him singing though. So he was instantly startled when Crowley began clapping.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Crowley, I'm not alone, he can hear you from under the car." Cas said. Crowley huffed and leaned on Baby a little.
"Dean and Sam need Cas, I'm Cas. What are the ingredients?" Dean sighed and Sam told him what was needed. Misha had an account outside his marriage to Vicki to make sure their assets got separated equally outside their own accounts in addition to their joint account, and he paid for the ingredients, explaining it away to Robert that it was practice props to see if they really worked because as Dean/Jensen stated, they were going method. Sam told him how the ingredients are supposed to go in the bowls and Dean trained him how to fight.
"Not now, Sam. But I do come in good faith. I have not only Cas's grace, but the Demon tablet. It was next to Cas's grace." Dean said as he handed the tablet to Sam. "It's no use without a prophet, but you can have it nonetheless." He turned to Cas. "And now you, Sunshine. I promised I'd heal you." Dean pulled out Cas's grace and opened the bottle it was in as Cas breathed it in. He started to feel much better, but then collapsed.
"Thanks for the double date." Cas said. "And Michael, I'm sorry I molotoved you with holy fire and called you an assbutt." Cas said.
"His aunt was an evil empress in China who had taken over a temple near the great wall. So seeing him die isn't all that shocking. BEHIND YOU! THE ROYAL MAYAN BAKER!" Courage screamed. Jack turned to see the royal Mayan baker emerge and soon turned into a normal Human being.
"Oh, I'm sorry. You must be new to the scullery. I'm Anna." Princess Anna said as she offered to take a scrubber and got on the floor.
"Tales from the Crypt. They show reruns of it on YouTube. It just so happens "The Assassin" is one of my favorite episodes. Right up there with "Korman's Kalamity". We can watch those two episodes back to back when we get home. And don't worry about the beef roast." Dean said. "I'm only tasting that one piece."
"Dean, come back inside. Or you'll catch your death of cold." Muriel warned when she saw Jack. "Oh hello, are you with Sam and Dean?"
"What do you think I'm gonna do with my blackbird's grace? I'm gonna heal his wings and fix his eyes." Dean said as he and Crowley kidnapped Metatron.
“Dean’s in the Empty?” Amara was stunned. “No Human should ever BE in the Empty. How’s he surviving?” She asked.
"Turnovers look ready. I'll put them in the display case. You want me to get started on the pasty filling? Lunch rush is almost here." Emma said.
"He deserves it. Now shush and sit at your space." Anna said as they took their places. Once Lucifer walked over with Dean's bags packed, Cas permeated his scent and touched the back of Dean's neck, covering the Omega in his comforting aroma of honey and firewood, with just a hint of applewood.
"I do like the strawberry jam in the middle of the cake. It's dreamy." Cas said. "Tell you what, we can have two cakes." Cas said as he touched Dean's forehead with his. "It's traditional in the south to have an Armadillo shaped Red velvet cake for the Groom anyway."
"Speaking of eating, Michael and I want to get to know you. Learn more about both of you." Adam said. I thought Dean, Cas, Michael and I would go to my favorite diner where Dean, Sam and I met. Or where Dean, Sam and the Ghoul who ate me met." Adam said. "Start over, since the Apocalypse never happened." Dean and Cas were a little hesitant, but they eventually agreed.
"Castiel plans to absorb all the souls in Purgatory to become the new God. But he's gonna absorb the Leviathans alongside those souls. Becoming the new God is gonna be to save the world and protect people as well as Sam and me. But I don't want him to be gone once he realizes being God isn't all it's cracked up to be. Thus I'm putting together the blade used to kill Leviathans." Dean explained.
"Oh hey, Miracle. Where's your collar and leash? Bah, I won't rat Emma out if you don't. Meantime, I want you to be my guinea pig for my new promotion: Dog day Afternoons. Dogs eat free daily from Noon-3PM. Kali and I made a coconut lamb and shrimp stew with rice and zested Bhuda's hand." Gabriel said as he gave Miracle a bowl of the meal in question. While scarfing it, Gabriel's dog that he conjured the first time he'd met Sam and Dean came over and proceeded to talk to Miracle. All while Dean and Cas were sitting in the window booth a couple tables over from the door.
Muriel had sold Eustace's truck after his death. Despite his death, she still had a heart of gold and kept her sweet, positive demeanor. And she still had Courage. They were cleaning together and Courage had been given new seeds to grow a new magic tree.
"Not even Sam knew the sex, how did-" Jess asked in shock. Michael just smiled at her and gave her a knowing look.
"I love it. And thank you for thinking more thoroughly about whether or not to use my Angel blade as material for a jewelry piece." They kissed again and Dean and Cas walked into the house.
"As far as I know, he still lives with a Vegan couple." Dean said. "Sam and I thought the Vegan couple had something to do with the Taxidermist's death because they ran an Animal rights group."
Amara cuffed Chuck with Enochian handcuffs and Dean kicked him in the nuts. Finally, Jack touched Chuck’s head and all of Chuck’s powers were absorbed into Jack.
"Exactly. Being a hunter is dangerous, unforgiving and barely rewarding. But you save people while ganking monsters. The family business." Dean explained.
"I still feel like I owe you something." Dean said as he pulled away. Then he remembered something. He ran outside the bunker as he remembered a little white kitten Miracle had found a few hours before he'd been sent back to when he was "Jensen". Sure enough, that kitten was there and she was sleeping sound in the grass and leaves. He picked her up and cradled her in his arms, sneezing along the way.
"I like to try and stay humble in those matters though, Lucifer. But thank you." Cas said. Dean felt a lot better as they reached Thunderlief estate.
"Oh good, you're back. How was Tombstone?" Crowley asked. "And you seem to forget, Dean that I then double-crossed him in favor of Raphael."
"Beautiful. Everything about you, Cas. Your lips." Dean kissed his lips. "Your physique, you feel amazing, but that's not the only thing about you. To influence you as much as I have is both an honor and a burden as along the way, your garrison, your bosses? Even I hurt you in a lot of ways and I don't ever want you to feel that hurt again. Because it pains me when I see the hurt I caused in your eyes." Dean nuzzled Cas's neck and ear, and Cas moaned. Cas stroked Dean's hair and Dean stroked Cas's bicep, mirroring when Cas had left a mark on Dean's bicep the day he'd pulled him out of Hell. They thrust into each other until they came together while Dean rolled over, so Cas was on top. Cas took a small nap and Dean watched him sleep for a little while.
"Then I came back to life and Dean and Sam left me to become Michael's vessel." Adam said. "But I'm over that. In fact, Dad? I think you've met Michael. But you haven't really been properly introduced." Adam said as he held Michael's hand and kissed it. Mary raised her eyebrows and John was almost disgusted. Not by the fact his other son was with a man, but that his son's boyfriend's vessel was what he looked like when John temporarily said yes to him using John as a vessel the night Mary had told everyone she was pregnant with Dean.
Once they had eaten the lizard, Cas felt strong enough to leave Purgatory. "Ready, Dean?" Cas asked.
Thomas walked out of the hut with a bruising glare. "Of course, Princess Meg." He bowed his head softly to her and quietly left. Meg then went into a separate room of her home and went to a shrine.
"MURIELLLLLL!" Courage cried out as he began to literally fall apart. Miracle ran up to him and licked his face. Just then, Cas and Ruby appeared with the spell. Ruby crushed the ingredients needed while reciting the incantation and when she finished, Cas set it aflame, sending everyone back.
"We ended up settling on both. Hope that's cool." Belphegor said as they handed Cas and Dean their copies. They then oohed and awed at the cake and helped themselves to a piece.
"He made a deal with the Empty, the place where Angels and Demons go. Him in Jack's place. He's a Nephilim Cas kinda adopted." Dean said. "If he experienced his truest happiness, he'd go willingly into the Empty. His greatest happiness was telling me he loved me. Watching him die like that made me realize I love him too. But I'll never get to tell him how I feel now." Dean sighed. "Then Balthazar took me back to this time period and when I saw you, I fell in love with you." Dean gulped as he took Misha's hand. "Just because you look like Castiel doesn't mean I'm placing my feelings for Cas onto you. What we shared this afternoon, I felt a current of emotions with you I could never feel with Castiel. I don't know how to explain it.
A couple days later, once Cas's grace was fully restored and things were less crazy, Dean appeared with his guitar that he had bought and began to play for Cas the second he came into the room.
"If you want, I can talk to Hannah about using Metatron to find God, he and Crowley can talk him into giving Angels the ability to taste. Especially since their vessels need to eat. Otherwise, they can't properly function." Dean slowly bent his neck down to kiss at Cas's. Cas moaned as he felt the Knight of Hell's lips tickling his clavicles and throat column. He moaned and Dean smiled.
"She's gorgeous, but her paint needs a little work. No worries, I'll drive her quick to the restoration shop. If that's fine with you, Dad?" Emma asked.
“Whoa, what year is this? Last thing I knew, I was making cookies when-God, what happened to you?” Jess asked.
"It's too late, Raphael." Cas said as he opened the wall to Purgatory himself and started absorbing the souls. Both Deans, Bobby, Crowley and Raphael watched in a mixture of fear of rage as Cas absorbed the souls. When he was done though, after snapping Raphael dead, Dean stabbed him with the blade.
"I'm coming, Mish." Dean said, having read Jensen's nickname for Misha. He opened the door and Misha brought in the pizza.
After all was said and done, Jack joined with Amara. She’d guide him on how to rebuild Heaven. Before he left though, he gifted Dean and Cas the dog. “Dad wanted you to have her. Her name’s Miracle. Dad said it was a miracle Grandpa had missed the sweetcake.” Jack said as he handed Miracle off to the two.
"Oh, Miracle. You found a little friend. Hi, buddy. Name's Dean." Dean said as he patted Courage on the head. Courage smiled as he breathed a sigh of relief. as Sam knocked on the door.
Emma saw that as a red flag. "Is yours? And does it matter? They're both girls." Emma talked back. Meanwhile, Miracle ran back to Emma with a ball Shadow had gifted her, asking her to throw it.
"Whoa, easy Cowboy. C'mon. I'll get you in bed to sleep faster than you can say bedbugs." Dean said as he picked Cas up and carried him into Dean's old bedroom. Together, Dean laid down with his Angel and decided they both needed some rest.
"Hey, I'm thinking of making dinner at my rental tonight. Wanna come over and we can talk more about the you really being Dean Winchester and not the Jensen Ackles I've known for the last two years?" Dean smiled and texted back.
"Hi, sorry I'm late. Bel and I were bickering over whether to get you two each a copy of Slaughterhouse V or The Greatest Gift, the short story that inspired It's a Wonderful Life." Jack said.
Cas insisted Dean ride with him on Blade while Lucifer trailed on Frostbite. Dean stroked the Camarillo's mane. "Blade definitely likes you, I can tell." Cas said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"At least we don't have any Muskims in our family on either side. Anyway, says here that Eustace owns a farmhouse and subsequent farmland in the middle of Nowhere." Dean said. "Has a wife named Muriel. Wanna look for Nowhere?"
"Alright, Mr. Ricochet." He addressed in a southern drawl to his little boy. "Go sit at the table with Claire and let Daddy order his treat next." Jack obeyed his daddy and went to sit at the table.
"I'm gonna plant this in my bloodline's firstborn. To ready for the Apocalypse." Michael said as he went to John Winchester, asked him to be his vessel, and using him, impregnated Mary with John's and his seed, planting his sword inside the zygote. When Michael had left John's body, he returned to see a bloodied Castiel being bandaged by Gabriel.
Eventually, Dean's thrusts became sporadic and too much for Misha and Misha came with a shout, leaving Dean to climax inside the older man, then collapsed on Misha's chest. Once they took the time to recover and Misha had taken care of both of them, they redressed and Misha took a second to drink in all of what Dean had said to him.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I love you, Blackbird." Dean whispered as he kissed Cas before they both came together. This was perfect indeed as they fell asleep shortly after.
“OOH, right there baby.” Dean said as he unbuttoned and unzipped Cas, making Cas whimper with extreme heat and began to slowly stroke the older Angel’s dick. Cas’s whimper soon turned into a gasp and a shout. The Entity pounded his head against a wall of the Empty a la Gordon Ramsay after Jason Underwood told him he was gonna try and make the souffles less sticky to the ramekin with butter, sugar and cocoa powder.
"This is Courage." Muriel said. "Any new friend of Courage's is a friend of mine. Come, I'll serve you a slice of pie." Muriel offered and Jack followed into the kitchen, then was intrigued by the dog food.
"So how far's Windom, Minnesota?" Cas asked when he and Dean were back home. Cas fed Miracle quickly before getting on his trench coat.
"Alright." Cas said when he flew in. "Have fun, and don't forget to take a honey peanut butter roll." Cas got out a small candy-like roll covered with parchment paper. "Peanut butter has plenty protein and honey gives plenty energy thanks to the sugars. Have fun, love." Cas said as he pecked Dean on the cheek, then used his Angel magic to secretly sneak Dean's necklace out of his right breast pocket. While he was cleaning upstairs, he found the receipt for the jewelry store Dean had found that makes custom jewelry. He had flown all over the area for Garnet and Bloodstone. Sam had told him when he and Dean were "Jared Padalecki" and "Jensen Ackles" that "Jensen" was born on March 1st, something Cas would like to include in a reconstruction of the amulet. He showered, fed Miracle and then flew down to the jeweler who built the ring. Once he found the place, he walked into the store.
"Think nothing of it, Dean. We're family. Virtual strangers or not, we're family no matter what. Especially since you're gonna marry my twin." James said. "And I expect you to come to Castle Novak to wed there. I'll even have the heat room set up and everything."
"That's what Castiel and I wanted to tell you. We reached an agreement. Antichrists and Nephilim are powerful beings. You've seen Jesse and Jane's able to cope well despite her being a Nephilim herself. We want you to train them." Crowley said. Dean contemplated it.
After a brief dinner of peanut butter soup that Cas had learned to make and lobster rolls Sam insisted on making for them, Cas laid Dean on his old bed and they began making out.
"We're close in this universe as best friends since we're brothers onset." Dean explained once they were in Jensen's trailer.
"Almost got it. Just need Demon blood. Dean, I highly doubt Fergus will be a willing participant. Do be a lamb and donate?" Rowena asked and Dean offered willingly. However, the addition of his blood resulted in a rift opening.
"In a barn. It was a misunderstanding. He thought I was a Demon who sent him back to Earth just to screw with him." Cas started. "In actuality, I had raised him from Hell, gripping him tight and making sure I had grabbed all of him. But in doing so, I had repaired him and in that, I guess my doubts that I was doing the right thing started when I first touched him." Cas blissed out with the memory.
"Hey, buddy. I thought you'd like to do a road trip. Just like the one we went on to interrogate Raphael." Dean said.
"Dean, that's my ticklish spot." Cas said as he leaned in further into his fiancee. Dean kissed Cas's neck and undid the older man's shirt.
"Not yet, we're still riding the high of getting engaged." Dean said. "But I'm probably thinking the day we met, in that barn. That's actually where our house is. We bought the place for a steal, then we quickly built the house from the ground up." Dean smiled as he thought about how he and Cas built their house.
"Well, we should go and have a strong drink over what we just stomached." Dean said as he picked Castiel up.
"Fresh strawberries and kumquats mixed in cream cheese and apple butter for the filling of a gorgeous crepe courtesy of Sam, my famous flapjacks on the side with a shot of bourbon-aged maple syrup made in Iowa of all places." Dean said as he ripped off a strip of pancake, dunked it into the syrup and fed it to Cas.
"Amara made a deal. Lucifer in exchange for Jack. She happened to be around when Jack was in Heaven visiting his mother." Sam said. "Cas was there. He was about to beg they take him instead of Jack, but Amara jumped in right then."
"Dean, I'd like you to come with me. Can you do that?" Cas asked. Dean nodded, then Cas took Dean's hand as they walked out of what Cas considered practically a prison.
"I'm sorry, bud. But I can conjure you a horde of bees programmed to sting Michael and/or Raphael should they come in in the night to give you more trouble and also make you a stuffed kitten to cuddle with." Gabriel said as he did so and Castiel cuddled up to it as he fell into a troubled, yet restful sleep. "I'll always protect you, pal. Even if I antagonize you. It'll be my way of telling you you need to stay away for both our sakes." Gabriel whispered as he kissed Castiel's forehead and left the chamber.
A little while later, Jack and Claire were taken to tour the rest of the town. As it turned out, Castiel, Jack and Claire were new in town. Castiel was a college Animal husbandry professor and had just started his job that day. Thus the 3 piece and the trench coat. He would still wear the trench coat, but he'd be wearing different clothes to handle animal biology and behaviors as the semesters went on. Claire was in high school and it was her first day too. She was a Senior and Jack was in Daycare, and adopted from a dead friend who committed suicide after having Jack, who was a rape product of an old frat brother of Castiel's.
"Mornin', Dad, Miracle." Emma addressed. "Cas is collecting some honey from the garden and he asked me to start making breakfast." Emma said as she gave a cooled down piece to Miracle. She munched on the bacon and licked hier teeth once she'd finished her piece.
"Oh, promise you won't freak out?" Dean asked as he made Cas a cheeseburger with lamb and fontina. Cas nodded as he took a bite of his burger.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
“After years of the ‘No dogs in the Impala’ rule?” Dean asked. “I’m honored to own her.” Dean said. Cas smiled and kissed the dog before kissing Dean softly in turn.
"To my Blackbird with broken wings and sunken eyes. I promise I love you. You'll fly and see again. Forever yours, Dean." Cas read aloud and smiled as he put the blackbird in his pocket.
"Thanks." Jess said as she went upstairs with Emma to rest. Meanwhile, Dean was still looking at his plate.
"I will never leave you again." Cas whispered to Dean as he nuzzled Dean's chest where the anti-possession tattoo is. Soon, Cas's rhythm faltered and they came together.
" The spectre said as Courage carried Jack and Dean back into the house. When they got in, the spirit of the virgin deputy, Nancy, was tormenting Sam.
"It's a long story. I was hunting a ghoul, I got severely injured during the hunt. So I drove myself to a hospital where Adam's mom, Kate was working. We kinda hit it off and then one thing led to another and for fourteen years, I took him to baseball games, we even went out for his first sip. Then I got a lead on Azazel and we didn't have enough time to see each other. Then I died and then I don't know what happened after that." John said.
"I'm friends with your dad, he heard you were thinking of getting one and so I pulled some strings." Garth said. "She's a real beaut, ain't she?"
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Your mate has a mouth full of cavities and cauterized gums by that stablehand out there. He'll eat a whole jar of honey." Ellen laughed and Kali nodded with an admitting smile. Suddenly, Gabriel came in with Dean.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Great, come on up. My Skene's gland fluid is running like a river. Fill me up like a cup of wine, baby." Gen hollered. Sam, defeated, sighed and walked back in the house.
"Come try the cake." Eileen signed. "It's peanut butter chocolate with a banana coconut butter cream. Sam made the butter cream."
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gabriel came to the door of the house with a trolley of desserts. He knocked continuously until Cas finally answered.
"GO! I'll save you time to get home." Misha said. "Dean, for what it's worth. I love you too." Misha addressed Dean with eye contact as Dean nodded before kissing Misha passionately one last time before Sam pulled him away. The Angel then woke up and stabbed Misha in the stomach, resulting in Misha cutting the guy's grace out. Afterwards, the Angel's grace healed Misha's bloody wound and just sort of disappeared from sight before he called for an onsite medic. Just then, the real Jensen and Jared had shifted back into life.
"So that's why Michael hid his sword inside of me when he and Dad conceived me with Mom?" Dean asked.
"Dean, oh Dean." Cas groaned as he began to buck into Dean's mouth. Dean soon deepthroated the professor, making him arch his back. Just as Cas was about to come though, Dean pulled off.
"Because I like you." Gabriel said. "And I especially like Dean. But even more, I love my baby brother. I didn't just leave because I didn't want to watch Michael and Lucifer tear themselves, and in turn Earth, apart. I left because I couldn't watch as Raphael and Michael kept ripping Castiel apart. He needs you, Dean. Just as Lucifer needs his sword. Hell, just as he'll need Sam. I've seen moments where swords make great partners for their wielders. In this case, you and Castiel, Dean." Gabriel said in a genuinely sincere tone.
"Not at all. As long as you didn't get a vasectomy." Karen said and Bobby decided first thing he was gonna make sure he had swimmers.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Sire, you're home early from your trip. Did things sour so quickly?" Garth asked as he pulled Blade into his stable.
"Crowley will come looking for me. Or he'll send a goon. I must protect you." Dean said as he got up slowly to get dressed.
"I don't care if you're the new God as long as you don't abuse it. I'm just glad you're okay." Dean said as he petted Cas's cheek.
Take after take, Misha was getting frustrated and Sam was terrible. "Get your FREAKIN' CRAP together, JARED! Jen? Do you need to run lines with me? Let's do so during lunch." Misha said as Dean nodded in agreement.
"Oh, that's rich, dearie. She's more than just an Amazon. She's a Golden Amazon, and the child of a favorite acquaintance of mine. Besides her uncle, who killed her the first time. You done buggered up and caught yourself a Winchester." Rowena said as she freed Emma from her binds.
"Hi, are you the man who designed the honey bee engagement ring my fiancee made for me? His name's Dean Winchester." Cas asked.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"We will." Michael said as he kissed Adam just as romantically as Dean and Cas had. Suddenly, the Entity came back from the Empty.
"Just silence and pleasure." Dean finished as he mouthed at Cas's pulsepoint, Cas smiling as he stroked Dean's chest once all their clothes were gone. Cas slowly rode the Demon as he did the first time they had sex in Purgatory. Metatron had been made into an example and a lot of rules were changed under Castiel's reign as God. For starters, a truce was made between Heaven and Hell, Angels could eat now, and most importantly was Nephilim and Antichrists could be trusted as Cas was open to trusting Jesse the Antichrist after he ran away when he learned he'd have to abandon his parents. Cas had even gifted Lily Sunder back her daughter once he had learned what Ishim had made him do. She thanked and forgave him for what had happened all those years ago, and Dean smiled.
"Just add a teensy bit of cinnamon to sweeten it, maybe a pinch of maple syrup." Kali said. Ellen was intrigued.
"I hear it's a great substitute for lube." Dean said as he smeared a bit of it onto Cas's hand, guiding said hand over Dean's entrance. Cas began stretching him out and Dean soon was arching his back once Cas found his prostate. "Oh God." Dean groaned.
"Oh yes, we met a long time ago. I used to play with his brother. Him, me and Megana." Meg explained. "How'd you find yourself in Thor's orchard?"
"Watch where you're goin', you fool!" The Asian man said before Dean decked him so hard, his head popped off.
"Been teaching myself a new song too." Dean said. "Did you know that Eric Clapton learned how to play guitar from George Harrison?" Dean asked. Cas shook his head.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Only Dean would know about that tape." Cas looked carefully and decided to accept it was Dean. "Crowley turned you into this?" Dean shook his head.
"The scones were just made today, but we don't have any of those pasties left, I'm sorry. But I'm about to make the filling for them as we speak. While you wait, I recommend a complimentary with a y Apple turnover. Instead of puff pastry, I use pie crust to turn it into a tart pie thing. Or we also have Cherry if you prefer that flavor over Apple." Dean suggested.
"So who are they again?" Jess asked. Sam was still catching her up on what she had missed over the last 15 years since Brady killed her.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Beyond exhausted. But she's great." Misha said. Wanna see West's latest pic she sent me?" Misha asked. Dean nodded and he showed him on his phone. Dean gushed at how cute baby West was. Shortly after, they ate in silence before they crashed on Jensen's couch. Dean held Misha close as he slept, Dean feeling close to him. But then Sam texted him, breaking the calm.
“He thinks everything I do is amazing. He makes his own jelly though.” Dean said. “I’m telling you, ever since Cas has been able to taste? His pallet makes me purr.” Dean said as he kissed Cas deep, but chaste.
“Thanks, Jess. Congratulations on the baby, by the way. I can’t wait to be an uncle.” Dean said with a smile.
"Oh, that explains a lot. You look so much like Eustace's brother Horst." She said to Dean. "And your brother Sam has Horst's build. Eustace and Horst never got along. Horst died just after Eustace and I got married. A few years later, I found my Courage. Eustace just died a few months ago, sadly. So I'm afraid you missed meeting him." Muriel said as she served Dean some tea. "Would you like some blackberry pie? I made it for dessert this morning."
"Take it easy, sport." Gabriel said. "Congrats by the way for the promotion to God. Though Grampa forced it, I'm sure you'll do a better job." Gabriel added.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dean ran hard and fast as he looked for Misha. He soon found the alley Misha was supposed to be murdered in. He hid and waited for the Angel. Soon though, Misha found his way to the alley. Dean, without hesitation, pulled Misha into the alley and covered his mouth just as Cas had done when he told Dean Lilith was the final seal to release Lucifer from his cage. "Misha, I know it's farfetched that I'm waiting for you in an alley, but all I want is for you to trust me. There's already trust after we had sex earlier, yeah?" Dean asked. Misha nodded. Dean nodded back. "I'm gonna remove my hand, and then I want you to be quiet. Then I'm gonna make the sigil that makes the Angels disappear." Dean said and Misha's eyes widened. But he didn't make a sound as Dean removed his hand and cut it to paint the sigil on the wall where Misha stood. Suddenly, the Angel sent by Raphael appeared.
"Look, we do what Gabriel, who by the way is still alive, wanted us to do during the Apocalypse and we play our roles. I be Jensen and you be Jared. Alright?" Dean asked and Sam did as was told. That night, Jensen took Jared to his "house", where Gen was waiting.
"Oh you know what? Cas and I were just about to head to the Roadhouse to have dinner. Emma, why don't you come with us? Getting out of the house will do you some good." Dean said as he pulled Emma out of the car gently.
"I love you, Dmitri Tippens Krushnic." Dean said as he kissed Misha's mouth softer than he did last, Misha pulled him in. "And I did have to google that, by the way." Misha giggled and they kissed again, but then Misha remembered dinner.
"Of COURSE I knew. Your soul is bright and strong, Dean. I'm surprised you and Castiel here haven't had sex yet." Gabriel said. Dean and Cas looked at each other.
"Mmph, good morning, Miracle. How'd you sleep?" Dean asked as he and Miracle shared a hug before Dean too smelled bacon. "Mmm, smells like Daddy's making bacon. Either him or Emma. C'mon, let's find out." Dean said as he got out of bed, Miracle following suit. Together, they went downstairs and walked through the living room into the kitchen to see Emma cooking bacon, sausage and making French toast.
“Try my honey roasted peanut butter burgers.” Cas said when Sam and Jess visited them. “Dean makes his own brioche and it’s amazing.”
"Yeah, her son Jacob's the owner of the Studebaker. Real beaut, too. You can come look at it. Why?" Emma asked.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Sam? You okay?" Dean asked. Sam shook his head as he began to collapse onto the floor. Cas walked over to him and touched his head, then Sam was back to how he was before his time in Hell.
"You make me happy and so does the idea of the Southern tradition of an Armadillo Red velvet cake." Cas said. They kissed deeply. "Besides, I can't choose which I like better either." They giggled, only for Airfry to sneeze, intensifying the fire in the furnace.
"I see." Shirley said. "No matter, I need your help." She said as she addressed Rowena. "Great Witch, It's been too long since I've seen your face."
"My dear, Shirley. Last time I saw you, you were a wee pup learning from your Gypsy ancestors. How strong be your powers now?" Rowena asked.
"Easy there, Tiger. If you were that easily affected by my pie, you should probably have a pasty like your niece. Also complimentary." Dean offered once the pasties were done. Cas took a bite and he was in awe.
Dean was putting a new engine into Baby when Cas came out. "Hey, babe. Gabriel here already with the samples?" Dean asked as he walked over to kiss his fiancee.
"You may not remember me, but I promised I'd kill you." The voice grew darker as he then began to elongate his fingers into claws. "I told you I'd grow strong enough to one day kill you. I missed a lot with my mom, Dean Winchester. Now I get to exact my revenge for what you did to me."
"I'm gonna give him a sweet dream, a lucid dream, make him think the two of you were mating." The Djinn, Barbara said as she pumped Cas with a good fantasy of April all over him.
"What're you doing back so-oh. I see." Michael said as he took one look at Dean. "I thought you didn't want another partner after Kelly."
"Mated?" Castiel asked. Gabriel explained his theory to the young Angel. Just then though, Michael came in and found his sword.
"It's true. She knew what she was doing." Cas said. "Then afterwards, we stayed on the couch for the night and we ate peanut butter curry soup when you called about Emma." Cas remembered.
"Lord Dean, I am Garth, the second Fitzgerald of Orthodont. Do not worry, I am Beta and have a Beta wife. We fight well." Garth bowed.
"I knew Cas would revive him." Emma said. That's why after I stabbed Dad, I had him call for Castiel so he could bring him back to life after he died. I even had Cas monitor it. Isn't that right, Cas?" Emma asked.
"Well after the Angels fell and I kept Sam from giving his life to cleanse Crowley's soul, I first prayed to you to come back to me, because I didn't know you had lost your grace at that point. Then I put an APB out for all Angels who could hear me asking for help. The only one willing was an Angel who called himself Ezekiel." Dean said.
"I did. Don't worry, no funny business." Dean assured him. He then peppered Cas's face with kisses. Cas told him to stop and Dean did as such.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You're the most amazing person I've known." Cas said as he kissed Dean's neck. Dean moaned and pulled Cas in for yet another kiss.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Castiel, Dean Winchester is in Hell." He began impersonating his dad. "Your garrison is the only one equipped with the training to siege into Hell and rescue him." Castiel heard the words loud and clear. Michael was very angry once he found out Castiel was saving Dean.
“Imagine if that girls’ school managed to find out you’re officially canon.” Sam began to tease. “The musical they’d be making out of that.” Jess punched Sam’s arm.
"Time to do better as an actor, Dean." Dean said to himself as he watched Misha walk away. He was nervous, and even more so as Sam came walking up to Dean's trailer.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"So you pretty much ensured that I lose the love of my life that night?" John asked, beginning to seethe.
"Fine then, if you don't want him here, I'll go with him. We need to catch up anyway, just keep me updated on Sam's progress." Dean said as he went to pack a duffel, then talked to Cas.
"It's okay, I got it. Take a break, drink a frappe." Dean said as Emma got ready to serve herself one. Suddenly, the bell dinged and Dean turned to see the handsomest man in a 3 piece with two youths in tow.
"I love every inch of you, my celestial being. God, on our wedding night, I want to recreate when you appeared to me covered in bees. Imagine the residual honey-making pollen everywhere. I want to lick up every square inch of that nectar-like sticky sweet slick." Dean husked, inflecting with sharper thrusts into Cas's tight, warm cavity. Slowly, Cas's grace leaked out through his eyes, being led into the amulet's eyes in turn.
"And you're still amazing, Castiel. My Cas." Dean softly whispered into Cas's hair as the older man peppered kisses over Dean's chest. The Demon smirked a bit as he began to sneak between them and stroke Cas's thickening white cheddarwurst in time with his own thrusts. Cas gasped harder and threw his head back in bliss.
"You're right. So let's start with Red Velvet." Dean said as he kissed Cas's hand. Just then, Jack came down.
"Maybe I should go to a nearby Whole Foods and make some brains to recreate that night." Misha said and Jensen giggled nervously at that. Just then, West started standing up and Jensen alerted Misha. Misha went right over to West and helped the little guy walk. Jensen took a video to send to Misha so he could show Vicki and Misha smiled, biting his lip as Jensen watched the father and son. After finishing filming the video, Misha picked West up and walked back over to Jensen, who then pulled the older man in for a kiss.
"So that night when I insisted we got into that orgy? That's why you wanted only to watch?" Crowley asked. "Saving yourself for the Angel food cheesecake?"
"Dean, you're the most important person I ever laid eyes on. From the moment I raised you out of Hell, I knew I was in the presence of a crossroads in my life. You changed me in so many ways. We have a family, and we have each other." Cas said as he bent down on one knee. "Dean Winchester, will you marry me?" Dean sniffled and nodded before kissing Cas deeply, silently praying yeses to Cas, Cas hearing every single one as they kissed. Jack, Belphegor, Sam and Eileen began to clap.
"I think...I need to use the restroom." Castiel said as Dean directed him. Meanwhile, Emma gave a knowing smirk.
"We're all Humans, Mother. Just because Dean's an Omega, doesn't mean he doesn't have rights." Lucifer growled. "Kelly had rights."
Dean and Cas explore a new future where Cas runs Heaven and Dean becomes a new leader for generations of Nephilims and Antichrists as part of a deal reached by Cas and Crowley.
"Actually, when we bumped into each other, he said he approved. That was before he and Mary were sent back to Earth." Michael said. Though he did find it odd that I was dating his youngest."
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Eh eh eh, pal. You are gonna scry for my dad's dog, so I can find Miracle and make sure my dad and Cas don't know I left her to her devices. Or I'm gonna send my boyfriend to eat you." Emma said as she pressed a knife to his neck.
"Come to bed with me, Beautiful. If you don't want to again yet, I understand. I'll wait to have sex with you again." Dean was very sincere and Cas felt that.
"Here's your bubble tea. Mind if I sit with you? I'm on break." Emma said. Claire nodded. Dean brought over the turnover, scone and cream cheese and they ate happily. Then he went back to taking Castiel's order.
"Just about, I'm gonna freshen up quick. Why don't you chew the fat with Crowley?" Dean asked as he quickly pecked Cas on the lips. Cas smiled and waited patiently as he talked with Crowley.
"Hey, it's Miracle." One patron said. "Hey, buddy. Waiting for Cas? Funny, he went to see Dean for lunch at Gabriel's diner about an hour ago. Man, the paneer dish that his fiancee makes? Just sublime." The patron said.
"As long as you call me after this, then yes." Castiel said as he smashed his lips into Dean's and they began to strip each other of their clothes. Dean peppered Cas's neck with kisses as he picked the older man up and placed him on the table. Dean kissed down Cas's body as he unzipped and pulled down Cas's pants and boxers. He smelled Cas's musk from his crotch and he was aromatic. One lick, then two and Cas was twitching again. Meanwhile, Emma and Claire were just outside the door when they caught their dad and uncle respectively.
"There there, now. You're gonna be just fine. Ellen, I think it's time to carve into the pig." Kali suggested as Ellen cut into a rotisserie sow still cooking on the fire.
"If we met sooner, I'd have instantly proposed the second we ate these PB&Js." Dean said. Misha blushed.
"Blasphemy. Though that would explain why you kissed me. But I don't know what to believe anyhow." Cas said. Suddenly, 2011 Dean, Bobby, Crowley and Raphael stormed the warehouse.
"I didn't go after that poltergeist so you could destroy your brother's trust in you. And I certainly didn't go after it so you could kill your niece or nephew, Samuel." Mary said. Now Sam was looking down. Just then, another surprise came for Mary.
"That was worse for me too." Ruby said. "For what it's worth, I still am. But if you don't want me, that's fine too." Ruby walked a little bit ahead and Sam sighed. Soon, they were at the patch of brush where everything was supposed to happen. Already, witnesses from Nowhere were already rising. From Dr. Vindaloo, the family practitioner in Nowhere, Eustace and Horst were also in the group. A maniacally laughing Asian man was standing there in all the chaos when Dean bumped into him.
"So Balthazar sent you to this dimension years ago, but this is still Sam's first time?" Misha asked when they were back at his rental.
"Wow, this house could use some readjustments. Could use a fresh coat, a little carpeting on the steps, I love the windmill aesthetic." Dean said as he let Miracle out. Right then, she bumped into Courage.
"Stay away from me, you're not real. Even if you are, get out of Dean Winchester." Cas lightly growled. Dean shook his head and touched Cas's hand.
"You're not the only one being shamed, babe." Dean said as he started the car up and began the long drive to the Roadhouse.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"In my timepoint, we meet God's scribe, Metatron. He kills us after stealing Cas's grace. Crowley then said that the mark of Cain mixed with the first blade will corrupt a soul, turning them into a Demon." Dean said as he showed 2011 the mark and then pulled out the blade. "Treasure him, he is the Collette to your Cain. I also think it's time you realize your feelings for him and tell them to him too." Just then, Dean felt the portal open up. "And don't you dare kill Amy, she may be an ally." Dean said as he gave one last peck on the lips to Cas and was afterwards sucked back to 2014. Dean watched as Cas's lips touched Dean's and cleared his throat once Dean was gone.
"It's food, nontheless." Dean said as he stretched. He then began to pull out his necklace that his father gave him before he left and stared at it before gripping for Impi's remains.
"I did like the one we watched on YouTube the other night, "Revenge is the Nuts", was it called?" Cas asked before he looked at the time. "Oh, we're running late. We need to wrap this beef up." Cas said as he did so. Cas then wrapped the beef roast in foil to keep it moist and went to get the dessert. "I also made a maple apple cinnamon cake that I think you'll appreciate." Cas said as Dean helped his fiancee get the cake out of the fridge and into the car. "I buckled both the cake and the roast into the back seat." Dean said.
"Of course, but there were some demons still who followed Lilith who were hanging around, so I had to make that speech." Ruby said. "Once I told Cas this while giving him information on the thing you were looking for when Cas was in the Empty to look for me, he promised he'd find a way to let me out so I could tell everyone. Only a few knew of my plan. Including the one we bumped into after the first time we slept together, Sam."
"And the same for me." Adam agreed as they handed back their menus. "And I'll have a chocolate milk."
"WHERE IS MY ANGEL'S GRACE?!" Dean screamed as he carved an Angel depowering sigil into Metatron's chest and slammed his hand over it, weakening Metatron's grace.
"Kinda in the mood for some Beatles, let's play "Penny Lane"." Dean said as he put on a Beatles tape he had made after Mary and John visited for a coffee date. Dean sang along to it a little bit and Cas started singing with his fiancee. Dean stopped for a second to realize he and Cas weren't just compatible in bed, but also musically compatible. When the song was over, "Lovely Rita" started playing and Dean felt like he fell for Cas all over again. But all too soon, they were at John and Mary's. Mary waved out to them from the front door when they pulled up and they each grabbed the components.
"When my mom was pregnant with me, we could communicate telepathically. One of the perks of being a Nephilim." Jack explained as he ate a bite of beef roast. "Mmm, Castiel, did you make this? It's almost as good as nougat." Jack said. Cas beamed. "Anyway, my mom had Castiel feel her stomach when I kicked. I could feel his compassion and I told my mom telepathically that I'd be safe after she dies as long as Castiel raises me. But I wasn't a fool in the womb, I didn't trust my birthdad because he tried to choke her when she pretended to say she wasn't ready to be a mom and that she was aborting me. She actually almost did, but then she knocked Castiel out saying she wanted me even if I was a product of the Devil. She later said she felt I had good in me. I do, obviously." Jack finished.
"Cas, you're home." Gabriel embraced his younger brother. "Kali and Ellen are in the kitchen, Kali insists she help cook. Come, Aunt Amara says we're having a boy." Gabriel said. Just as he was about to turn though, he saw Dean and looked him up and down. "Hi, I'm Castiel and Lucifer's brother, Gabriel. Michael's still recovering from his rut, so I'm taking on his stations for the day. Stables are first. Who may you be, dear Omega?" Gabriel asked.
"Great. I take you for a Boba tea kind of girl, that true?" Dean asked. She nodded and Emma got started on that. "Emma learned how to make it last month as a way to get more customers in and they really enjoy that. Oh that reminds me." Dean turned to the little boy. "You like hot chocolate? I make it so it's not so hot, but also a lot more flavorful." Dean said and Jack started jumping up and down in excitement. The professor, Castiel, began to giggle.
"Just Dean will do." Dean said as he pulled off just to say that, then went back down on his new lover.
"Daddy? Are you okay?" Jack asked. "You look like the time Uncle Gabriel pulled that prank on you with the laptop and grown-up playtime movie." Cas blushed and Dean walked over to see what had happened.
"Sam and Dean Winchester, you dumb bitch." Emma said. "I'm Dean Winchester's daughter. The story of legends, you don't know about us?" Rowena then handed back Emma's swiss army knife and proceeded to fry Giselle.
"Mmm, you're right. Peanut butter and bacon are really good." Dean said. "Especially toasted. Want a bite?" Dean asked Cas. Cas took a bite and offered a bite of his burger to Dean, which Dean obliged. They each took a bite of each other's meal and they were in awe.
"I don't want you to lose your chance to get home." Misha said. Dean touched his head to Misha and gave him two items.
"Cas? You're here? I mean you're alive." Dean rubbed his eyes and pinched himself, making sure he wasn't dreaming. "I-no. A Djinn has to have snuck in-" Cas cut Dean off by holding his face.
"This meatloaf is a lot different from the many meatloafs I've tried at different diners. It's a lot moister and juicy." Jack said.
"I don't mind at all." Dean said as he took a bite and he felt an orgasm. "Oh my god, this is delicious." Dean groaned.
"So let's run through the scene where Dean finds out Cas has been working with Crowley. That's the next ep we're shooting. It's best to get ready just in case." Misha said. Dean nodded as he remembered when Cas told him.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Let's take a break then. For what it's worth though?" Dean asked when he handed Misha a water. "Your stance is amazing. Have you fought before in films?"
"Oh, you know Meg. Great, nice to meet you, Dean. I'm gonna wash up and get some lunch." Michael said as Dean smiled.
dead. But then, Crowley came to me and showed me what happens when the mark of Cain and the first blade make contact on a dead man." Dean said as he flashed his eyes black suddenly. Cas gulped, and then suddenly threw himself out of his bed, falling in the process.
"I know, it's just each time I flash back, I still feel guilty. I forgive you for every stupid thing you've done thusfar, Cas. Because you thought it was for the good of the world when it happened. And I'll forgive you for whatever stupid thing happens next because we can't survive on bitterness and petty bitchiness." Dean turned to Cas and he noticed that Cas was crying.
"Yeah, a portal to that world. We got lost the first time going there, and Jack got trapped there thanks to a dreamwalker named Kaia." Dean explained. "Sam and I had to make the most of it by eating prehistoric lizard. The first bite, I was about to say "Not bad for lizard." But then Sam cut me off before I said anything and says "Please don't say it tastes like chicken." Like No, Sam. It's a lizard. It TASTES like a LIZARD!" Dean said and Michael and Adam giggled at that.
"Yeah, and you nearly starved yourself to feed me even though Father did the same to feed you." Sammy pointed out.
"I see. So I was mistaken when I thought I smelled dying graceless Angel on you the other day?" Crowley asked interrogatingly.
Filming was postponed due to Dean's emotional breakdown in Misha's trailer, Misha covering for him. They spent the rest of the time exploring each other more, but the location had changed to Jensen's trailer. Dean put on "Miracles" by Jefferson Starship. Since they were to later film an episode where Dean was to name a new species of monster that was part vamp part wraith, the ep was to end with this song playing at the end. There was something sensual between them. They were in their own world as Dean found a stash of Jensen's lube and began to finger Misha. Dean found Misha's prostate and rocked his fingers over that spot for as long as he could swallow Misha's gasps and moans. Misha's hand found purchase in Dean's bicep where Cas had touched him when the Angel "gripped him tight and raised him from perdition", as Cas so profoundly stated all those years ago. Dean had to fight to remember this wasn't Castiel, but he was lost in the pleasure of entering the man who in this universe, brought Castiel to life.
"I was so excited for her to see it, I just wanted to drive all the way here in her. Ain't she pretty?" Garth asked. Dean just shook his head and laughed to himself. Same old Garth, even if he was a werewolf now. Just then though, Emma came out.
"That and the hot dogs. I'll be sure to get the ingredients. Onions, poppy seed bun, Dill pickle spears, sweet relish and tomato wedges. Just grew some tomatoes too." Cas said as Dean swooned.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"We were running out of money, I don't hold it against him. You know we've been struggling since Prince Azazel destroyed everything." Dean said. "Prince Castiel saved me from how his father King Charles and his wife Queen Naomi treated me." Robert was happy. Castiel was a wonderful man, caring, fair and just. He now had trustworthy to add to his list things to describe the young Prince of Shurley.
Shirley was looking into her crystal ball when she saw something dark, followed by a face she never thought she'd see again.
"Hiya, guys. Heard you're gettin' hitched. You have an empty storespace I can start a bakery and diner?" Gabriel asked. All Dean could do was hug him tight. Cas and Michael joined in, as did Jack. Things were really getting more interesting indeed.
"Fine, let's just drive over there now." Ezekiel said, feeling defeated. He got in on the passenger side and Dean drove until he'd reached the address. Just as they stormed in though, they walked in on April about to seemingly stab Cas in the chest.
"Sam and I found her at an abandoned gas station a few months ago. She's been with us ever since. She kinda serves as a therapy dog for me." Dean said as he took a bite of the pie. He then began to dig in like Miracle and Courage dug into their dog food.
"Trying to track Metatron. He's been off the grid since the Angels ostracized him following his stabbing me to death." Dean said.
"Are you sure it's not just to see me naked again?" Dean asked. Misha chuckled at that, he wasn't gonna lie. Dean then obliged and took his shirt off again, showing him he didn't have any of Jensen's tats. The only tats he had were to ward off Demon possession. Misha still wasn't convinced.
"I thought we could finish the tasting with that, because I know if you do taste it, you're gonna be all "YES! This. Is the one I want for our wedding." and whatnot." Cas said. Dean blushed a bit.
"I don't have lube, but there's an apartment above the store I usually sleep the night in when I have big orders to fill most days." Dean said as Cas nodded. They gathered their clothes and Dean led him to the set of stairs, then he put up an "On break, come back at 5PM" sign. Then he quickly followed the older man to the apartment.
"Hey, I got you. What happened to your version of Cas is not gonna happen to me." Misha said. And then Dean flashed back to when Misha was killed the first time he was here and he suddenly pulled Misha into his arms before kissing the older man deeply. Misha thought about pulling back, but then decided against it. Meanwhile, the Angel Raphael sent to kill Sam and Dean had found where Balthazar had sent them, and he was ready for blood.
"Exactly, I designed that ring for him. Congratulations. What do you need from me?" The jeweler asked.
"Time to shoot already? I better shower. Thanks for last night, Jen." Misha said as he hugged Jensen tightly. Dean hugged him back and Misha ran quick to his trailer to become Cas.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You're free to stay the night if you like, I think Emma took Claire and Jack to our house." Dean said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dean was scared for his person right then. He didn't want to go to Prince Azazel. It was why his mother had left long before she met his father. He knew then he would have to work hard to prove his worth and clean the castle like he was born with magic.
"Okay, so the pizza man doesn't REALLY love the babysitter. Sex isn't just because of love. It can sometimes be used to barter in exchange for goods and/or services. In this case, the babysitter ran low on money for pizza and offered to let the pizza man have his way with her in exchange for her pizza. Sometimes spanking enhances the pleasure. But only if you're into that sort of thing." Dean said as he and Cas pulled into a Gas n' Sip. "I'm gonna fuel the car, you need anything while I'm filling the gas?" Dean asked.
“Yes.” Cas said as Dean took the ring out of the box and put it on Cas’s hand, then they kissed deeply. They then spent the rest of the night celebrating in a lot of ways. Not only their engagement, but the start of what’s to come in their future.
“Is that Dad? I wanna talk to him, knowing how to smite Grandpa. Maybe he has an idea.” Jack offered.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Well, cat's out of the bag." Gabriel said as he took down the simulation. "Nice to finally, formally meet you two. I'm Gabriel, the Archangel." Gabriel announced.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Well, Naomi had cheated death by finding a way to be revived when Heaven was losing power. I decided we didn't need people like her anymore and got all those angels out of Heaven. The Entity took them and in exchange, we got some good Angels and Demons, Crowley included, out in exchange." Jack said. Suddenly, a silhouette of angel wings popped into the window and Courage screamed.
"That would make a lot of sense. Lucifer only wants to get his sword back not so he can hurt Earth, but so he can just reunite with it. They were a great team back in the day. Castiel's heard the stories from Gabriel." Jimmy answered.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
“Oh God, baby. Yes. Yes, YES DEAN YES HARDER MORE! YESDEANYESGODDEANYES!” Cas was howling into darkness as Dean thrusted hard, hitting the Angel’s prostate. The Entity just continued to pound his head against the wall. Suddenly, Amara appeared.
"Hey! Off the premises, pooch. Go on." The owner called out. But then he stopped when he realized it was a temporary Edsel from Miracle that she couldn't move and knelt down to her. "Oh I see, long morning? Alright, come on in, pal. Too much sun will overheat a dog faster than you can say Fricassee." The owner walked Miracle into the shop and got her some water, which she was grateful for. "You seem like a dog of discriminating taste. My nephew's been thinking we should start catering to dogs. Ah, you talked me into it, buddy." The owner then cooked a wagyu strip, laid it on a blueberry and rice pilaf and topped it with a peanut butter and beef broth bordelaise. Miracle ate it up like the vacuum on Teletubbies sucking up all the Tubby toast crumbs and Tubby custard when the Teletubbies make a mess. Even more grateful, she licked the owner's face once he had finished eating and was off again. "Take care, pupper." The owner said as he went in the back and called his nephew to let him know that the shop was now gonna be pet friendly.
“Brothers are supposed to tease each other, Jessie. Don’t worry, it’s a Winchester family tradition.” Sam said.
"I was there when Jack was born. I helped Kelly have him while Sam and Dean got out of Apocalypse world with Crowley's help and while Cas fought Lucifer to keep Jack from him. Obviously, it wasn't enough as for a while, Cas was dead. And at the same time, I had gotten knocked out when Jack was born. From there, he hid in his nursery and I ran out when I heard Dean scream no." Mary said. Cas nuzzled Dean's neck and assured him he'll never leave again with a tight squeeze of his hand. Dean then drew a breath and quickly kissed Cas on the lips, soft and chaste but still passionate.
"Of COURSE I LOVE YOU TOO YOU IDIOT! When I prayed to you when you went back to Purgatory, I meant more than just I forgive you, but because you're, well you? I didn't think you got "I love you" out of "I forgive you". So I was trying to tell you that when you told me you heard it." Dean said. "And when you said you didn't think you could ever have what you want, it made me realize you didn't understand at all. You told me you love me and I can't live without you, man. I've been trying. I really have. But after this last time? I've actually considered-" Dean sighed as he realized he was beginning to cry. "Remember that bullet Bobby used to keep in his desk before his house blew up? He said I was the reason he never used it. So I thought if I ever lost you again, I would have that same system." Dean admitted through heavy breaths and hard falling tears.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"We're thinking of the shed we met in in Van Nuys. We'll probably turn it into a studio apartment, maybe get a cat." Adam said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Leave them to be together. Let's just see what happens. Castiel will probably not recognize Dean at first as your sword." Gabriel said. "But my money's on his grace being able to recognize."
"If you must know, yes. And if you must also know, it doesn't change my lack of feelings for Sam I have now. Thank you though, for not killing him. Even if it wasn't for me." Dean said.
“Castiel, I come to you as a man, no more or less, with the hope that I can take your hand in marriage and we can make each other honest men until death parts us.” Dean said as he handed Cas the ring box.
"Thanks, Uncle Gabe. So we were discussing reviving some people. I'd just revived Mrs. Butters and we apologized to each other when Amara lost control of her powers and well..." He was interrupted when Eve suddenly flew in on a dragon.
"If he stabbed Cas in the stomach where the Leviathans were, I think he knew exactly what we didn't yet." Crowley said. "That Demon looked a lot like you though, Dean. Like you three years from now." Dean contemplated that for a while.
When Cas woke up the next morning, Dean was gone. Cas thought he had an early morning with Crowley and decided to get out of bed and get dressed when Dean came in.
The travel was exhausting from Thunderlief estate to Castle Shurley. It would be even for Castiel and Lucifer. Their relationship with their parents has never really been cordial.
"Between hunts, Dean was a plumber for a short time." John said. "I hear he even did the plumbing all around his house that he and his fiancee live. Isn't that right, Dean?"
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Megana. Her mastery skills with Dark magic allowed her to help me get out in secret. However, Father still has my blood. So he may still find me here. So I take it then, you haven't seen Sam in quite some time? I hear he's an Alpha." Meg said.
"You need no creature comforts. I am Queen Naomi, this is considered contraband. Now I will see you do our laundry in the morning. In the meantime, have a lobster." The Queen barked as she chucked the dead crustacean at the Omega's head. Dean began to have a panic attack and tried to open the lobster with the drawer, but when he opened the drawer, the dresser next to his bed just fell apart. Miserable, in pain and tired, he just chucked the lobster and gathered up what was left of his mini-horse.
When Dean caught up with Ed and Harry, they had the bone and Dean had all three bloods he needed for the blade.
"Dean, you gotta get over Cas. It's time, don't you think?" Sam asked. Dean didn't answer. He just went back to reading, then started calling Cas's old cell just to hear his voice. The sound of Cas saying "I-I don't understand. Why do you want me to say my name?", Dean cried and began to reach for a tumbler of Craig, a consolation gift from Rowena. Fergus's favorite drink, she said. He took a sip and went back to listening to Cas's voice when all of a sudden, Balthazar was standing in front of him, scaring Miracle.
"Oh you know it, baby." Dean said as he pulled out the butter and put it in a bowl to soften so Cas could mix honey into it. Miracle walked towards her dinner bowl and Emma filled it with some steak, a little salmon oil to top and some strips of carrot to clean her teeth.
"Your godlike powers are still in tact, just shot for the time being. You absorbed the Leviathans. This blade killed them." Dean explained.
"He finished watching his favorite cowboy movie with Cas nearly ten minutes ago, he probably wanted to help clean up." Crowley said. "His fondness for that Angel, I'll never understand."
"NEVER LEAVE ME LIKE THAT AGAIN! You can't just tell me you love me and then leave me like that, you child!" Dean screamed out when he broke the kiss, only to go back in.
"Dean, hi. We heard you'd moved to South Dakota." Karen said. "Is that Castiel? I heard you were getting married. Bobby, turn around to see Dean." Karen pulled Bobby to look behind him as he thought Dean was inside. Dean got out of the car and walked over.
Tired and hungry from all that running, Miracle took a rest and went to sit on a shady piece of sidewalk. Unbeknownst to her, she'd done so in front of a restaurant and butcher shop. The owner looked outside the window and was looking quite pissed at first, but Miracle just whined as she needed a break. She was pooped afterall.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I understand, hon." Dean said as he looked at Cas. "We'll look for it on Hulu or Prime Video." Dean said and Cas frowned.
"You deserve not to be treated like Naomi treats you. You deserve to be treated as an equal, not a slave. Come live with me, Dean. Thunderlief is a home for all three secondary genders." Cas said. "And I was also intrigued with you the moment we met. When you first offered me that orderve." Cas stroked Dean's cheek.
"We needed the money, it's not your fault, Father. Tell Adam I love him everyday and tell him you love him as well." Dean said as he finished packing up his side of the room.
"Alright. So are we taking the Impala or are we flying. Be warned though, I was constipated for a week the first time Cas flew me back to the year my parents got married. Ten years before Azazel killed Mom."
"Very nice to make your acquaintance, Dean of Winchester. Castiel wrote me a few days ago. He'd talked a lot about you. He was really descriptive." Dean blushed. "I was so excited to meet the Omega who had captured my twin's heart. I must admit though that he forgets to put a bit more detail into your eyes. They're very greener than an emerald. May put an Alexandrite's green hue when the light hits it a certain way to shame." James said as he lightly kissed Dean's knuckle. "Come, I'd like you to meet my mate Amelia and our daughter, Claire." James guided Dean over to the horse where Queen Amelia and Princess Claire eased off their horse.
"If you want, I can get Jane to stop by with a pie and some BLTs for lunch if you want to stick around." Cas offered.
"I'm your huckleberry too." Dean said as he kissed behind Cas's ear and pinched his ass. Cas lightly chuckled and pinched Dean's left inner thigh.
"Hold your tongue, filth." Naomi scolded. Dean collected the dishes quietly and went into the kitchen to finish cleaning up. Once he had finished, he walked in to his room and his stomach started growling.
"Dean? What are you trying to say?" Cas asked when the Angel pushed Dean's lips off his. "That you love me too?"
"I didn't know my son would consider him compatible." Charles explained. "Not to mention, we fear our oldest son's fury because of what we did to his last connection to his mate, his son."
"We will set the bone down in this bowl." Dean said as he set down the bowl Crowley gave him for the making of the blade. Harry then set down the blade and Dean opened all three blood vials and poured them all over the bone at the same time. Once the bone became a blade, Dean went back to the warehouse.
After breakfast, Dean strolled around the grounds as Lucifer gave him a tour and introduced him to many members of the group. "That's the crop garden, Uriel and Joshua tend that. Their Alpha at the gardens is Benny. He's a bit of a flirt, but he has a wife named Andrea. And in charge of the cattle and pigs is usually Garth, but he also gets help from his wife. She grew up on a farm. Her stepmother killed her father though in a sacrificial ritual when she and Garth first wed. And we have Betas learn medicine among other things Omegas usually learn. Cas wants us all equally equipped." Lucifer was explaining.
"You stole my best li-hyena." Dean shouted when Cas breached further into him with his fingers, now using three. Dean threw his head back as Cas began to pepper kisses onto the baker's neck, nipping into his clavicle before reaching to put his chin on Dean's shoulder.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I can't deny that theory, baby." Dean added as he pulled Cas down to him and cuddled him as they fell asleep. They were content as they slumbered in each other's arms.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dean snuck away rather easily from Crowley. All he had to do was fake terrible singing and being drunk. He didn't care about Sam anymore, being a Knight of Hell. But that didn't mean he didn't care about a certain Angel with suntouched skin and the bluest blue eyes that would paint the TARDIS a shade of green with envy. He flew off and went out to find Castiel.
"He kept trying to get me to believe what he told me was true." Cas explained. "He even gifted me this obsidian blackbird with a note." Cas said as he gave Sam the note that came with the blackbird.
"Oh, sorry I haven't come in yet, Dad. Jacob offered to drive me home after we finished fixing his car and I locked up once closing time hit. He pulled into the drive, I thanked him, one thing led to another and you caught us kissing just now." Emma explained.
"I bumped into him a few hours ago. Not gonna tell you where he is, Thomas. I made a vow when I came to live here. I will not betray the trust of Castiel." Meg watched her brother. Thomas just rolled his eyes as he got up.
"In the future, after I become a Demon. I sing "Blackbird" to you after." Cas smiled. They started to undress each other and kissed once their shirts were off. Dean kissed Cas's neck softly as he reached down to undo his and Cas's flies before rolling himself and Cas over so Cas topped.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I don't know." Cas said. "I just came back as Zachariah told you you're Michael's vessel. I have heard this, but I didn't realize." Castiel looked into Dean's eyes again, his grace tingled a little as he fought not to kiss Dean.
"It's a Campbell family recipe, this pie. My grandma Deanna passed it onto my mom and it was passed down from my Great-grandmother, Grandpa Samuel's mother." Dean explained as he served it and the coffee to Castiel. Castiel took one bite of the pie slice he was given and suddenly, he envisioned himself frollicking around a giant field of giant cherries, "I can see clearly now" playing in the background. Once he was on a swing flying into the sky with the sun in his face, he suddenly fell back to Earth, a wet patch in his pants.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Is it too much, baby? I can stop if you want me to, let me know if I need to, sweetheart." Dean promised with a peck on the nose, making Cas's heart flutter.
"Our Lawrence?" Dean asked. Sam nodded. "Huh, interesting. Well, Miracle's ready for the drive there. Let's get going." Dean said as he grabbed his bags and called Miracle to come to him. As he loaded the duffle bags into Baby's trunk, Dean lowered his head and began to cry, remembering how Cas told him he loved him and the Empty sucked Cas and Billie up into the Empty, leaving him in the dungeon to break down. Suddenly, he was on the ground, crying against Baby's back wheel and just cried, Miracle sitting in her master's lap to try and comfort him.
"So we have all kinds of cakes. Creams, piecakes, Boston cream pies, the like." Gabriel said as Dean came in.
“Without Dean and Cas, we’re sunk. Do you know where we can find Amara? We could use her help.” Sam said as he drank a beer.
"You need to order state-of-the-art kitchen stuff. There's an appliance store close to where Cas and I live, I'll stop by and get a quote for stoves, ovens, sinks and fryers." Dean said. "I hear that in some bars, if you serve alcohol, you should also serve food."
"Sorry, is it okay if I temporarily transform out? I really wanna play with my new brother." Airfry said. Dean and Cas just sat there and nodded, having forgotten Dragons had a Human side.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Maybe, but they're adorable. Kinda reminds me of Miracle. You think we can get a dog like this one?" Kaia asked. Miracle got bored with their conversation and went into Dean's office. Claire stopped talking and went after her.
"Yeah. And it's obvious that she wasn't alone if I had Djinn poison coursing though my bloodstream." Cas said. "But that would explain last night for me." He bit into a PB&J and drank a sarsaparilla. "I immediately passed out after eating and suddenly, I was having a lucid sex dream." That was enough for Sam to spit out his beer and choke, Dean feeling amused.
"Relax, that's just to shut him up. The only thing he's gonna tell me is where your grace is." Dean said.
"I can enjoy that while I wait. Apple reminds me of my dad. He used to bake too. He and my mom died last year in a home invasion. Uncle Castiel took me in right after." Claire said.
"I'm Dean. But you don't have to help me. I must finish by myself or the King will send me off to marry Prince Azazel." Dean said as he re-scrubbed where the mud had been tracked. Anna took her shoes off and went into her bedchambers. The rest of the scrubbing of all the floors took a total of 12 hours and by then, Dean was tired and hungry. With that, he was about to fall asleep with his favorite stuffed animal from home when he saw a woman snooping in his bed and shredding his last scent of home.
"I love that idea, baby." Dean said as he kissed Cas. "Speaking of, I better see if Baby needs maintenance." Dean said. "Finish breakfast and maybe you can help me?" He smiled.
"Yeah, let's." Sam said as they and Gabriel went to a bar to eat and drink something. After a while though, Dean and Cas separated from Sam and Gabriel, who just sat there awkwardly as they knew their brothers were about to finally do it.
"I can't kick him out, he needs somewhere to go and this is the only place for all of us to feel safe in." Dean said.
"Large Pepperoni and sausage pizza from Pacifico Pizzaria." Misha announced. Dean smiled and they ate together. "A&W Cream soda? Wow, you really are off." Misha joked.
"I Just found this book. It looks like a record of our lives." Dean said as he opened it. He then found a letter just behind the front cover. He opened the letter and read it out loud. "To whomever decides to move into this bunker. Surviving Men of Letters sent us a letter to track the lives of Henry Winchester's family following his fall and what offspring his only son John had as he grew up. I have sent a copy to this bunker and have spread it across all the other bunkers across America and even across the world. It takes a village, you know that more than I. For Henry, this family shall prosper through us." Dean read out loud.
Dean accidentally gets sucked back into mid 2011 and begins to right the wrongs made the night Cas became God for 48 hours.
"It's the best shot we have though, Jack." Dean said. "Ruby, lead the way. Sam? Go with her. She's obviously remorseful for what happened." Sam begrudgingly went with Ruby as they, Dean, Cas, Jack and Courage went to see the second witness rising.
Thomas of the Azazel Principality ambushes his sister, Meg, at the same time Dean is introduced to Michael and Thunderlief's visited by the relative Novak Kingdom.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"How's your potion coming, Mother?" Crowley asked as Rowena was making a spell for mass torture of unruly demons.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I don't remember." Dean said as he was buttoning up a plaid shirt over a white undershirt. Michael and Adam might be taking us there." The door suddenly rang. "Get the door?" Dean asked as he put on his watch. Cas nodded and swooped downstairs.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Oh God." Dean groaned as he plunged slowly into Misha's warm cavity. At the same time, Misha's head was thrown back as Dean filled him until the younger man on top bottomed out. He waited for Misha to get used to the stretch of his girth inside him before he moved. Once Misha confirmed he was ready, Dean began to move and both men gasped as suddenly, they were transported to cloud nine. The pleasure was so intense, Dean scrambled to grab Misha's free hand and entangle it with his own free hand while his remaining hand continued to find purchase on Misha's hip, Misha's other hand still gripping to his bicep, right where Cas's handprint was when Dean crawled right out of his grave all those years ago. Except this was early 2011 based on the timeline Dean was back in.
"Seems like yesterday your mother left you in my care after she decided she couldn't take care of you anymore." Dean said. Emma smiled back, eyes teary.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Sorry, Jen." Misha said as Dean looked right at him with longing eyes. "You alright, buddy?" Misha asked.
