“You want another one? It’s on me”, Greg offered, so John just agreed. He hadn’t counted his beers, but one more was okay, he was certain.
he tried to tell himself but he wouldn't listen. There was a corpse lying right in front of him, everything he had ever needed before, but it wasn't enough now.
“John?”, the Di asked again which brought him back to the present.
John and Mary meet Sophie and her boyfriend Mark in the chinese restaurant Wung Li.
Please let me know :) Thanks!
(This one and one more Rise Against, then I promise there are a lot more different songs! Sorry!)
“Sophie? How do you know about her? She’s… an old friend that I didn’t have contact with for a long while until we ran into each other just last week or so.”
“So there’s nothing between you and Sherlock? You don’t feel anything for him?”
“Mycroft made me responsible for Sherlock taking drugs, but I don’t know what I did. It has to be something to do with me, though, because…”
“Tell me about Sherlock”, she asked and tried a small smile.
I'm already working on the next chapter, I hope I can finish it soon. :3
When the living room was made presentable again, he decided that he could do the rest tomorrow. Nobody would care tonight.
“You will never lose me, I will always be here for you, no matter how hard it will be. I apologise for not realising this before, but I will do everything in my power to see you happy. Please, don’t cry anymore, John.”
John actually sighed with relief when he saw Sherlock sitting against a crate in the middle of the roof. It meant he didn’t have to go looking for him, scared it might be too late, and it meant he was in no imminent danger of falling.
I hope you still enjoy the chapter (if you're still with me D: ) and please tell me what to think of it. I love every form of criticism, as long as you're nice. :)
John only nodded. He knew bloody well.
“Oh no no no. I told you I’m not playing that! I’d rather dance, if I have to!”
“That sounds like I just told you I cheated on you or spent all your money or so.”
"Ynghthrplng", Sherlock whispered, eyes locked at the ground.
“Hello to you, too, Mary”, John said slowly and he looked so tired that Mary instantly felt bad. It probably wasn’t easy for him as well. However, she couldn’t continue like this, and if she didn’t want immediate change, she at least wanted answers. And if Mary wanted something, she normally got it. Except when Sherlock bloody Holmes and John bloody Watson were involved.
“There is nothing you can do. I am broken and beyond fixing. I should have realised that years ago, when everyone told me so, but it needed you to open my eyes. I guess I should thank you for that, John.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John watched the car leave, then started off into a small street that would lead him directly to Sherlock. At least he hoped so.
When had it changed? When his father died? His mother had broken down and he couldn’t cope, but he had gone to the army then, and if that wasn’t structure, he didn’t know what was.
John hesitated. The rooftop still brought back unwanted memories, even just talking about it, and somehow it felt… too intimate to tell Mary about it. Which was stupid, because she as his wife and he loved her.
Sherlock pulled out a list and crossed out some lines, then said: “Next would be… Dancing or board games are common, I believe. I guess I’m getting the Cluedo then?”
"I… I am sorry, Sherlock. I didn't mean to do this. I.. I should go", he said, uneasy, and turned to walk away.
Sherlock smiled and sat across him, offering him cookies, which tasted wonderful. John forgot about the weird dinner, about Sophie and Hockey-Mark, about Mary and the dead child. All he felt was Christmas, and he found that Sherlock had done a very convincing job in recreating the holiday.
Mycroft's speech left John lost for words, but before he could even process what exactly was happening, Mycroft's phone rang and disturbed the tense atmosphere.
“Good luck with that one, I don’t know what to do with him. I told him you’d come back but he just wouldn’t listen! Anyway, I’m late. See you around, John, and thank you for coming!”
“Don’t we have a case? I always have work to do. Has Lestrade called? I’m sure he has,”
“You don’t even have your phone”, her husband shot back and she resisted the urge to throw her hands into the air.
He realised he was thinking about Sherlock and him when instead, there should be Mary.
He stepped some inches forward but couldn’t think of anything helpful to do now, so he went back to the door.
“Let’s have presents. I’m aware it’s a custom on Christmas.”
Blatant lie. She knew it. She didn’t ask.
the rooftop, not below, and Sherlock was with him, no on his way down, and he couldn’t hold back now.
As always, thanks for reading! More to come, soon! :)
“John Watson.”
And with that, she stepped past him and disappeared.
And here he was, lying on his bed, probably drunk, the second day in a row, his life totally screwed up.
He shrugged and continued to the bedroom. He could clear up all of that later.
Next chapter is in writing, so I hope I get it done soon :)
Something next to him moved and suddenly John was back,
Molly visits Mary in the hospital on the day Mary will get discharged.
This place isn’t exactly on the way to the club but she came here nonetheless, that means she was following someone that asked her to come here. No sane woman would go with a stranger on a friday night so it must’ve been someone she knew. Her eyes started to look shocked, combined with the wound in her chest it was someone she liked a lot, and the stab came as a total surprise. She was not married, though, so it can’t have had anything to do with any sort of affair."
? I am not sure if I like that.
"Love me", the detective finished the sentence for him and John could hear the pain in his voice.
“Don’t make me lose you again,” he whispered against his friend’s shoulder, but his voice was lost in the precious coat. Of course he wouldn’t leave without it, no matter how urgent the case or how distracted the Consulting Detective, he would always wrap his coat around his shoulders, turn up the collar, smirk at John and then stride to the nearest cab that just magically appeared around the corner.
“Is there something in the tea as well?” he asked cautiously and Sherlock actually laughed and shook his head. Then he pressed a button on a remote control and some violin music started to play, no doubt recorded by himself just before.
“Sherlock, I…”
Smiling apologetically, he said: “Hello, Mrs. Hudson. I’m sorry if I scared you. I just wanted to talk to Sherlock, make sure he’s okay… He wasn’t yesterday.”
, he thought,
He found his phone on their bed, next to Mary’s phone. Had she left it there on purpose or had she just forgotten it?
"Although this house looks nice and renovated, it’s actually been empty for some years now. Most houses in this area have been. And she was on the way to a club, as the time card in the pocket of her coat clearly shows. She’s going there every friday for Lady’s Night, and she clearly fancies the first DJ. He has nothing to do with this, though.
“Alright, let’s have it then.”
The DI broke the silence first: “So, how is she and what exactly happened?”
He lay down on the bed, didn’t care that he had all his clothes and even his shoes still on, and stared at the ceiling. His life was a mess. How had it ended up like this? All the time before, he’d had clear structures in his life.
Resigned he opened the door and slid in next to a woman that wasn’t Anthea for a change. He didn’t bother to look at her, and she didn’t even greet him, so he just stared out of the tinted window and wondered what to tell the elder Holmes brother. That he had hurt Sherlock so much that there was no hope left?
“You know”, Greg continued after a while, “we always made jokes about Sherlock and you being a couple. Even I joined in, but I swear, I never thought it could be a problem.”
He was so tired suddenly, he wanted nothing more than to be at home with a cup of tea and some crap telly.
John looked curiously at Sherlock and waited for him to elaborate. The detective, though, only grinned mysteriously and said: “I’ll explain it to you when we’re back at the flat, if you don’t mind. I suppose going home might only be a risk of running into Mary and having to explain yourself.”
John couldn't say it, so he just trailed off and avoided looking at Sherlock.
This was suspicious.
Okay, this turned out kinda short. Sorry!
things.
He took a deep breath, then he walked up the stairs where it was completely silent. No shooting, no violin playing, no cursing, no crying. Never had it been so quiet here, but John was sure that Sherlock was at home because his coat was lying downstairs. He never left the house without his coat and it was already alarming that it was just left on the floor.
“Thanks, Greg”, he said, sitting down. Their beers came and for the first half of their glasses they just sat in silence, watching the people in the pub.
Have you ever felt unwanted, John? Have you ever felt the glares of everyone around you, knowing that they'd rather want you gone?
“So… so this is it, then? This is us? Are you trying to tell me that you just want to end this because I failed to be there for you once, after all this time?”, John raised his voice until Mary flinched at every word.
John smiled a bit nervously, then recited the conversation with Mary. For some reason he couldn’t explain he left out Sophie. Somehow it didn’t seem right to him.
The cushions from the couch had been swooped to the floor and all chairs had been pushed to the walls. On the table lay some med bottles that John assumed had been left by the paramedics, he threw them into the bin without even looking at them.
They both laughed and entered the pub, where they sat at the bar. It felt like a huge improvement to John, away from the secret table in a dark corner to a place out in the open, where everyone could see, hear and talk to them. It was silly, but it cheered him up a bit.
That only earned him a sceptical look from John, who really thought about calling the hospital immediately, so Sherlock hurried to say: “Okay, okay, it’s for a cold case Lestrade gave me. I need to recreate the atmosphere. Do you think it’s convincing?”
New flat, trying to get a new job, trying to get everything else done as well.
Instead, he caressed Sherlock’s back, drew him close again and murmured: “Shh, relax. It’s fine.”
"Maybe not leave him in a cloud of drugs, worse than before! You either help him or keep your distance, or I promise you, I will take every step possible to make you feel what he felt - unwanted.
He was right, there was nothing to be said against it. And having a case with Sherlock again, a completely unrelated, neutral case…
At this sound, Sherlock stirred and John let go of him, eyeing him warily for the first time.
"What.." he started, but of course he knew what had happened.
“Wait a moment, John, who’s Sophie?”, Greg asked and the doctor blinked confused. Hadn’t he mentioned her last time? Ah, no, that had happened this morning. The last days had been such a mess, it seemed so blurry to him now. Or was that the beer? He hadn’t eaten anything today, he might react a bit to it, and he had already had two… no, three.
The fact that it surprised him was sad in itself. She was his wife after all. Of course she knew what he needed now. She knew it because she was awesome and John should never let her go, even though he didn’t give her enough credit for it.
“I’ll just wait until tomorrow, I guess. See what Mary says. She seemed pretty determined so… I just hope she comes to her senses.”
“But you like Christmas, don’t you, John? What’s wrong with celebrating Christmas whenever we feel like it?”
“So. You said something about crime scene. How’s it going? Hope I’m not keeping you from important inquiries you have to make?”, John asked, mainly to kill the silence that had grown quite uncomfortable.
It was weird, only Sherlock ever made him want to do that. That was not fair, to anyone.
John laughed. Of course Sherlock would see it this way.
? He couldn’t even recall what he had said. But why would he do that? He barely called Mary pet names, to think he thought of his best friend as
“Mrs Hudson” he said, turning towards her and trying his best smile.
Greg considered this for a moment, then looked him in the eye and said: “You know, I can’t really help you making a decision, but you should just take some time and get clear about your feelings. You need to be unbiased, it doesn’t matter if you think you’re straight or gay, it doesn’t matter that you don’t want to give up Mary because you kind of just married her, all that matters are your feelings. Think about that, then you can act.
“I can call him if you want, ask him myself”, Mary offered.
This chapter is a little longer, I hope that makes up a little for less postings? :c
... I guess not. I guess I know you too well to trick my mind, even like this."
“Oh, sorry. She’s a friend of Mary’s, apparently. Wrote her some weird texts this morning, and because Mary had left her phone at home, I felt kinda… obliged to check them.”
Thank you to everyone who is still here, who is still reading, and of course thank you to everyone that came here just now or a while before - I love you all. :)
John nodded and explained what his wife had said, but also added that it had sounded a bit weird to him. Although recently, everything sounded a bit weird in his ears. He just wanted things to be normal again.
Mary couldn’t help but giggle. He was totally right.
John investigates, even though Greg told him not to.
At that moment, a snowman on a shelf started singing
He turned on his heels and left the flat, pretending to be calm but wanting to sit down and cry.
He stood up and John waved at him. He wanted to keep sitting a bit, he didn’t trust his legs right now. Maybe it had been a beer too much, but what did it matter?
"Shut up", he pressed through his teeth and left the room with large steps.
Fortunately, he still had a key to the flat so he could sneak past Mrs. Hudson. He really liked the landlady, but he didn't want to explain what had happened to her boys.
"Sherlock" shouted the inspector who was left behind, but it was no good: the detective wasn’t coming back.
So here we go then :x
How did it go???
Everything was decorated in red and green, a fir tree with ornaments stood next to the fireplace and several light strings were hung up on the walls.
“So, about Sherlock?” She wouldn’t just let this go.
John couldn't help but smiling a little desperate before he answered: "But I'm here. I couldn't sleep anyway, and I needed to talk to you. Because you're my best friend and I care about you. And I want you to be okay, I really want that, but I can't... you know..."
His insides burned and suddenly, John felt hollow. He couldn’t do this. He had lived his whole life without Sherlock, and he didn’t want to go back there, he couldn’t, they couldn’t ask this of him -
Happy new year, also, btw!
john just waved it away. He didn’t want to dwell on the past now, and Greg had done so much for both of them.
“Ah. Found the killer already, he’s in custody right now. It was her neighbour, but we haven’t found out why yet. Since we had no real help from Sherlock at all this time, we actually have to rely on clues and what the murderer says. All that’s left now is a bit of paperwork, but I can still do that tomorrow. Or next week. Or never. So don’t worry about it.”
“I am not sure if Sherlock would want me to tell you”, he said stiffly, trying to avoid an answer.
And then they told him he couldn’t see him.
“Sherlock, are you okay? He’s coming back, isn’t he? He always comes back...”
He typed a quick “Sherlock on roof, come fast” without sending it, then pushed open the topmost door of St Bart’s.
Also, this chapter is way longer than the previous ones, I know. I did have the opportunity to cut it in two, but I thought I'd leave it like this and ask you: What do you prefer? Shorter chapters or longer ones? Especially with the plot I have planned, longer chapters should be doable, might take a bit longer to write though, depending on how busy I am with work and school.
John’s heart felt warm as he left the pub and for a moment he felt like he’d just been on a normal night out. Then he walked around the corner and into Mary’s flat and all the memories came back. Sighing, he kicked off his shoes and started cleaning up.
Disappointed, he walked out, not sure if he just admitted something he’d rather kept hidden - from both Mary and also himself.
And if something in his chest hurt while thinking this, something that felt like an awful lot of guilt, John pushed it aside as shock from all that had happened. No one could watch his best friend overdose and be brought into hospital unconscious, barely alive, and feel perfectly normal at home.
"It wouldn't matter", Sherlock muttered, but he sounded a lot less certain than he wanted to.
As softly as possible, John said: “I’m not leaving you, you’re shutting me out. Why are you up here? I thought that after yesterday we were fine for now, what changed?”
John almost shouted the last bit, then looked around, embarrassed that someone might have heard him talk about his feelings. He’d never really done that anyway, why did he have to start now?
He had the feeling there had to be an actual light bulb above his head when he pulled out his phone and started texting Greg.
As he got out of the car and recognised St Bart’s in front of him, he frowned in confusion.
Had it been his mother who had refused to talk to him again, leaving him to deal with Harry?
“And you’ve never heard from her before? How long do you know Mary now?” - “Three years. And Mary said she doesn’t have any friends because of a … complicated past past. She picked up some acquaintances since we got married, but normally she told me all about them. She accuses me of having secrets, but why would she hide a female friend when I never complained about her male ones?” - “You’re right, it seems weird. Did you ask her about it?”
Mary returned with tea and cake, she even turned on the telly and brought a blanket for them to share. For a while, they sat in silence and zapped through the programs, jumping from a quiz show over a court show to a detective show and there they stopped. It felt familiar, and John instantly felt better. He smiled and grabbed Mary’s hand and even kissed her on the cheek.
I haven't even proofread it so if you find any obvious mistakes, please point them out. I am so sorry if you do.
The next morning, he was woken up by Mary’s phone getting what felt like one hundred text messages in a row. He cursed and rolled over to grab the mobile, which was still lying on the bed where he had found it yesterday. He wasn’t curious - well, okay, maybe a bit - but he figured if someone had tried to meet her, they wouldn’t know about her accident, so he accessed the phone. It was only three messages, all from an unknown number.
This chapter is a bit longer and I'm quite happy with that. Hope you are, as well! I still suck at Sherlock's deductions, but I tried to fit some not so obvious stuff in it. :s
The DI smiled.
"John, the man of the hour! Aren't we all happy to see you?"
John finally has that conversation with Mary he dreaded for so long.
Childish excitement took hold of him.
"It is impossible that I am still hallucinating. The major effects of the smoke should have stopped by now, but how can it be that you are still standing in front of me when you should be with Mary right now?"
“Alright. Thank you for being honest with me”, she started and blinked confused when John started laughing.
With large steps he crossed the room and opened the window, then he turned towards the armchair he knew Sherlock was sitting in.
Panic was rising in the army doctor, these words sounded like someone had died, and John was suddenly so scared that Sherlock had overdosed or hurt himself in any other way that it came like some sort of shock to him as he entered the hospital room after Sarah and saw Mary in the bed at the window.
Before he went to see his wife, he took a cab to Baker Street. He didn’t really know, why, but it seemed like the right thing to do.
Sherlock looked old and more like a ghost than a person. His skin was even paler than usual, his eyes were sunken in and almost glowed red, but his gaze was unfocused, looking here and there and nowhere in particular.
His friend, however, did not respond and instead opened the door. John thought his heart might stop of shock.
Outside of the hospital, John looked at his watch before deciding what to do now. He didn’t really want to return home and just wait for tomorrow, for the talk with Mary. He wasn’t sure what to expect of it anyway, but there was no point in thinking too much about it.
In a lower voice, he continued: “The only reason I’m  not doing this is because I know I can fix you here, and Mary is in hospital, so I don’t want to go there at the moment.”
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this even though it doesn't even have 1000 words :x
"Sherlock, do you have something? I can't give you much longer, and you know that. Please tell me that you can help us."
But you're still like everyone else, aren't you. You don't understand my brother, and no matter how hard you try, you can't save him. After all, you're just another ordinary human.
A shiver went down his spine as he remembered that it had been him that always insisted on these words to be true.
John could almost see the inspector running a hand through his hair like he always did when he was nervous. And he
Hope you're still in Christmas- mood, because I think you might like this :3
He immediately regretted his words when John said sadly: “You know, it’s kinda funny, but yesterday Mary accused me of the same thing - regarding you.”
Cursing himself, he called a cab, never ready to face Mary.
Edit 18.05.16: Text message "conversation" from Sherlock's POV. It's a bit of a mess, but then again, Sherlock's a bit of a mess. Hope you still enjoy it :)
cookies you made?”
Upset wasn’t the word he would’ve used to describe his feelings but on the other hand, he didn’t know how he looked at the moment. Maybe he didn’t show anything from what was going on inside him, and he wasn’t sure if he wanted Mary to know.
Hey, so this will probably be the last chapter for a while. I'll be moving in two weeks and I don't know how soon we'll have internet in the flat, and before I still have sooo much to do. The next chapter is already half written, though, so probably as soon as I have internet and some free time, you'll be updated!
Thank you everyone who is still following this story. :3
"Our victim has been dead for six days, this can be confirmed by your team. The woman was ready to go out when she was murdered, which happened with a sharp knife and just one precise stab from the front. On the way to her favourite club she came here, so she had been distracted by something. Someone."
Sad that he’d lost a friend like this, sad that he couldn’t talk to Mary about it. He didn’t even know what held him back. Maybe it was his loyalty to Sherlock? But why should he do this, after what had happened today?
I'm really sorry that I left you here. I'm not abandoning the story, and I do have plans to write more, I'm trying to be organised about it!
When he approached the building, everything seemed normal. It was a busy day and people were hurrying in and out of the front doors, so it was no problem for John to blend in with the crowd and avoid being seen by people that might have known him.
So I'm not sure if anyone is really interested in it but I got some kudos and some people visited the story so.. I'm just going with it for a bit. :)
He didn’t wait for her to answer but jumped up and nearly ran out the door.
“I… I went out, didn’t plan to stay long, I left you a note, I didn’t know… How bad is it?”
Sherlock pulled out two boxes, neatly wrapped in green and red paper with reindeer heads on it; one he gave to John immediately, the other after half a minute of waiting.
Mary nodded. That sounded reasonable enough, she only hoped that she could be reasonable right now. But that was to be found out soon enough.
As he opened the front door, he immediately bumped into Mrs. Hudson, who shrieked and jumped a little.
"How are we feeling, Doctor? Are you sleeping enough? Or is it maybe the weather that upsets you?"
Sherlock loved him. How could this have happened? He’d been at John’s wedding, goddamn it.
(Did I promise less Rise Against? Woops. That chapter was already written then. And it fits so nicely :( Sorry!)
“I slipped in the shower… I called for you but you weren’t there… Oh, John, where did you go?”, she asked quietly and John could hear the pain in her voice.
“Please, honey, let’s just talk about this and then let’s be okay again. I miss you”, she admitted and felt her heart ache as she spoke the truth out loud.
Not only did it hurt to hear John talking to him, to do what he had always done, taking care of him; but he also started to feel guilty now. He thought that after telling John how he felt, after seeing John leave him, his friend would feel better not having him around. Instead, it seemed to be worse than ever. When was the last time he had seen John this miserable? He couldn't even remember.
, a person he loved, someone he didn’t want to live without but would have to, now.
Oh, John. Hello! I am a friend of Mary’s. She wanted to text me yesterday, about a… surprise we both planned for you. Since I don’t know if it succeeded I’m afraid I can’t tell you more. Why are you replying on her phone by the way? Is she okay?
I noticed that I made a few planning mistakes in the last chapters, I will sort that out at some point, like for example that no one complains about the cold when it's obviously February and stuff like that. Please just ignore that for now? :) I'll work on it, I promise.
When there was no reaction, he sat down next to him, but found that he couldn’t look at him.
Even Lestrade noticed his absence as he finally called Sherlock to a crime scene to ask for help.
I want to be your everything, the person you come home for, the one you want to survive for when you’re chasing criminals.
"Yes. I'm sorry Sherlock but I can't change how I'm feeling", John said with a voice that wasn't as steady as he had hoped.
Caution: I updated the chapter before to now describe the "conversation" from Sherlock's POV. I didn't want to make an extra chapter for that, since the conversation was really short itself. I don't know how the notifications work on AO3 so if you haven't read the whole chapter before please go back and read it. Thanks :)
Surprisingly, Sherlock really appeared in the door behind him, with his reddened eyes wide open.
“He’s on intensive care, I’m really surprised he’s still alive, I’m sorry, you can’t see him now, please come back another time,” a friendly but stern doctor told him and John felt like throwing the man to the wall and crushing him. Bus hit common sense told him it wasn’t their fault, and so he just decided to go home.
“Love?”, he asked, his tension clearly hearable. John flinched and said: “Did I say that? Shit, I’m sorry, Sherlock, it was kind of automatically, I didn’t even think about it, please don’t think too much of it. The rest is true, though. I am very sorry!”
“He’s… not good. Had smoked a lot of something weird and thought I was a hallucination. I’m really worried but then they called me here and of course this is more important.” He skipped the part with Mycroft and that he didn’t even had his phone with him but Mary wouldn’t notice anyway. It wasn’t even important, he hoped.
It was John’s turn to interrogate “Can I ask you a question?” he nearly added, ‘and be honest’ but knew it was superfluous, Sherlock was never anything but brutally honest “Would you like to touch me? I mean, if we pare it right back and don’t worry about the relationship and sex compatibility and stuff, do you find me attractive, cos if not, this whole conversation is pointless”.
“Mary!”, he called and tried to hide his surprise and embarrassment that he hadn’t thought of her first.
A small voice in John’s head asked what he was doing there, but he shut it up. Sherlock had been smiling quite a lot today, the way John had wanted him to, and after all it was probably just the stuff in the cookies. He could blame it all on them later.
Mary had to catch her breath and needed all the strength she had to keep her eyes open. Maybe this had been a bad idea after all.
Mary nearly laughed at the absurdity of these words, of course he wanted everything to stay the same. Having a good job with female colleagues that adored him; a wife that did everything for him, being pregnant with his child; a best friend that might as well be his boyfriend, clever and handsome… Who wouldn’t want all that?
It took him ten minutes longer that normal to get home, but finally he sat down on his bed and didn’t know what to do now. He should probably go to sleep but so many different thoughts were racing in his head, he just couldn’t.
Okay, so if all goes as planned, we'll have three more chapters after this before Christmas. I already wrote two, I only need to find the time to type them down. I'm trying my best! This one is a little shorter, the others should be better, I think. They all look long in my tiny little notebook so.. :D
John talks to Sherlock about his suspicions. The detective wants to help him and together they plot against Mary.
, without danger or riddles. Perfectly ordinary.
John meets Greg again and actually talks about his feelings.
Umm yeah so ... I'll just go on a bit. At least I have a bit to go on about. I think. :)
He probably was in enough trouble as it was already.
I hope you had great Christmas days and a great last week of the year, please be careful celebrating and I'll see you all next year! :)
Footsteps, away from him. Silence again. Sobbing, uncontrollable sounds.
"I'm missing something. What am I missing?"
Hope you enjoy all those :)
Anyway, I hope this is a bit fun for you, it's nothing too serious and doesn't really add up to the story but I thought it would be nice to have them talking :)
“John, good to see you, mate. I already ordered for us, beer should be here soon”, the inspector said, waving from his table in the corner. John was thankful that he hadn’t chosen a place at the bar. He didn’t want that much attention right now.
John smiled up at his friend, and that was when he saw the mistletoe hanging at the door frame.
A surprise. Well, he had gotten that. Fast, he replied:
Suddenly he just wanted to talk about all of it. He needed to share his situation with someone, and so he was really glad as the other man nodded and took another sip of his beer.
John nodded and bent over to kiss her forehead, and it filled Mary with indescribable joy. That small gesture signalled enough love and affection to nearly make up for the last week, and she was optimistic for the first time in a while that was longer than she wanted to admit. Even with the loss of the baby - maybe they could still be a family.
mind. I'm not the only one out there. What about your friends? Mrs Hudson, Greg, Molly? They all care about you. Be a little less selfish and keep it together."
"Sherlock, what the - .. are you trying to kill yourself?", he shouted through the smoke that barely smelled like cigarettes. John didn't want to know what Sherlock had been taking, he just wanted him to stop.
When he opened the door to the living room, his eyes immediately began to water. The whole room was filled with smoke and breathing hurt like hell.
Here’s John, Mary’s husband. Who are you? And how did what go? Please, respond, I have other ways to find you if you don’t.
Greg smiled slightly, then emptied his beer.
As he entered the flat he immediately saw the chaos created by the paramedics and he suddenly wondered who had called them. Had the neighbours heard Mary’s shouts?
“Oh, for goodness sake, John, do we have to dance around the topic and argue like preschool kids?”
I'm very sorry about the hurriedness of the last chapter, I will try to edit it as soon as possible (even though I didn't want to edit before I finish the story, but I think the last chapter might be an exception.. Sorry!)
After a while, John said: “I do love you, and you
Hey! Sorry for not keeping my promise - wait, I didn't promise, did I? Anyway, here it goes! I can promise that I will NOT stop writing, it might just always take a while... I'm sorry for that. Enjoy it nonetheless, I hope! Sorry for all Johnlock-shippers - this is a bit of torture, probably. But Mary does love him! Stick with me, please :)
So he sighed and got dressed.
Well, the facts. He was already crying, he didn’t want her to know all about his emotions. This was enough.
“Man, I’m sorry to hear that… But tell me, what did Mycroft want from you? Does this have to do with the weird way Sherlock’s acting recently?”
Ehh I'm really sorry for not posting for so long. (Not that anyone cares probably.. doesn't matter!) I wasn't sure if this story is being read by anyone so I kinda slacked a bit.. Also, exams! But I continued more than just a bit and I'll try to post in the coming weeks. :) I'm at my mum's place at the moment so probably a bit less time than ever, but I'm still at it! Tell me what you think (please!) and umm yeah. Thanks for reading!
Annoyed, he decided to end this conversation here, and put the phone on the night drawer. He had to get up and prepare for the discussion with Mary. He wondered if he could just not go to the hospital since she probably had no way of reaching him, but that wouldn’t solve his problems anyway.
He shook his head. He was definitely straight, and god damn it, so was Sophie. Or she had to be.
He saw the body on the pavement, the blood; felt the drag of the paramedics; the people shoving him away just to get a good
Sherlock needs to recreate Christmas for a cold case Lestrade gave him, and he needs John to celebrate it with him.
As soon as he felt the cool air on his skin he started inhaling it until his head hurt.
“Sorry…” - “No worries”, John answered, “I’m glad you’re on the right track.”
On the other hand, he wasn’t sure what he sould tell her, or what he wanted to, and that was possibly even worse.
“The thing is, John… I want the situation to change. I don’t feel like you value me enough. You take me for granted, you always have, ever since you met me. It only worked between us because I accepted the fact that Sherlock Holmes would always be your number one, and who couldn’t understand that, with his mind and all. But you know, carrying your child made me realise: I don’t want to be just the wife. The one that waits at home until you finished your adventures with the most important person in your life. The one that cooks you food and cleans your room so you can be happy even at home, when you’re not with the greatest mind in Britain.
In his head, their last conversation replayed, Sherlock’s last, cruel voice; his own pleading words; his desperate cries and screams.
“Actually, I think I should go. The flat’s a mess and I want to at least get something right. Thanks a lot for the talks and… hope to see you around.”
The detective, however, smiled faintly and then whispered back: “Let me tell you a secret, John…
John grabbed his phone and went into the living room again to sit on the couch. He just selected Mike’s number in the contact list as his phone started vibrating - incoming call. For a split second John hoped it might be Sherlock but the name on the display said ‘Greg Lestrade’, and of course, even if Sherlock decided to contact him - which was bloody unlikely - he’d rather text. Sherlock never called unless he had to. If he was about to jump from a rooftop for example.
“Well, then. It’s going to be a surprise and you do love a surprise. Mycroft must have had his reasons for not telling you. Let’s just be glad he has found someone. I honestly never thought we would see the day.”
“Tired, love?” He asks sleepily, head resting on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“You don’t even remember,” the words dripped like acid from Sherlock’s tongue “You don’t remember what you said.”
The tube journey to Baker Street was just two stops and both men spent the journey recovering their breath and grinning at each other. It was only on the short walk from the station to their flat that John slipped his hand into Sherlock’s, who gave it a welcoming squeeze.
A considerable amount of kissing later and John was getting hungry. Sherlock had cheered up enormously and decided that he needed tea and to look after his John. He offered to make a sandwich and went into the kitchen, John hovering in the door way, slightly cautious about what Sherlock might deem suitable as a sandwich filling.
“Good morning, Dr. Watson,” greeted a man in his sixties. “I am Jacob Lindon. Mr. Holmes said you would be joining us today. I'm led to believe that you are in need of a new suit and accessories.”
It nearly broke his heart.
“How did you know to bring red socks?” he panted into Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock paused, wondering if he was not too old for his brother’s comfort, but launching himself into the proffered arms none the less. He rested his head on Mycroft’s shoulder for a moment, recovering from his fright, waiting for the question, the need to explain but Mycroft simply looked into his face and smiled, comforted to see his little brother seemed to be fine again.
“Sherlock?” he murmured, not sure if he kept his voice down in fear of scaring his friend of himself.
John tries to keep calm, but his thoughts betray him. (I'm still rubbish at summaries.)
, which surprised John so much he had to laugh.
"Mycroft, I assure you, I didn't want any of this to happen. What should I have done? Smile and nod and say 'Yes, Sherlock, whatever you want, Sherlock, doesn't matter what I feel, Sherlock'? Because I've done that for some years, but I am a married man now, and I'm going to be a father. I have to take responsibility for my family now, not only for a wannabe-sociopath that needs caring."
“Geez, that doesn’t sound good”, was all Greg said to John’s story. The doctor nodded.
Can I be that for you? Can you see me like this, for me, for yourself? Because that’s the only way I want this - us - to continue.”
He tried to steady his pace so as not to attract attention but he found himself nearly running by the time he took the second stairs.
John was slightly jealous; this piece of clothing for sure had never been forgotten at a crime scene or had to worry because it wasn’t informed.
“Yes. Yes, I’m fine.”
So here you go! I tried to add more paragraphs this time, and I edited the last chapters as well. :) Hope you like it better this way, should be easier to read :)
Her voice trembled but the words still came out firm and hard and they made John angry. Now even his bloody wife thought he was in love with Sherlock Holmes!
“It is funny how you’re trying to convince yourself of a truth that would be so much easier to like. But John, I know you, and you are the most loyal man I know. And I know one thing that also never changes: If Sherlock Holmes calls - actively or indirectly like today - then you’ll come running to protect him. And I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, because it’s a very honorable character trait, but I will always stand back against him.”
Yay I did it! Gotta leave in 10 minutes for my train to home, but I managed to still type the chapter! Hope that makes you happy, I'll try to type the last one for this year tomorrow, but I cannot make any promises because I don't have a PC there and have to ask my family to lend me one. Anyway, I will be on vacation for the rest of the year so have a very merry happy Christmas and a great start in the new year! Love you all!
So John forced himself to press
“Happy Christmas, you madman,” he laughed, then pulled the ribbon off his box.
John and Sherlock investigate the possibility of Sophie being Irene Adler.
“I understand if you can’t tell me details, but.. Are you making progress?”
“Yes, you keep saying that. I have yet to see that you mean it, because you’ve always broken your promises so far. And yet I keep allowing you in. Why do I do that? Why am I so
“Mary, I love you, and you’re the only one for me. I thought you knew - “ - “Stop lying to me, and to yourself!”
“John, listen to me”, Greg said with a soothing voice. He didn’t sound like the tough detective inspector anymore, more like John’s mother, from what he could remember when she used her calming voice. That made him even more miserable, but he listened.
“I’ll be there in a bit. Thanks, Sarah, and… I’m sorry.”
John sighed, but somehow he was also curious to see what this was all about, and so he took off his own jacket and pulled the sweater over his head. It fit perfectly and didn’t even scratch. He had to admit that it felt very nice.
Not waiting for her answer, he got up and went to the bedroom, where he dropped face-down on the mattress and felt like not moving again until Sherlock was okay again. Because right now, that was the only thing that mattered.
"Mycroft..", John replied, shifting his weight from his bad leg to his good one. Suddenly he wished he had brought his cane, even though he hadn't needed it for years. Was it all getting worse again?
my number one, but… I accept that maybe I didn’t show it enough. I didn’t want you to feel that you come only second, after anyone, especially now. I am very sorry and I hope you’ll give me the chance to make it up to you.”
“Sherlock…” John cautiously began, “you do know that we’re in March, right? Christmas was almost three months ago, and we even celebrated it, at your parents’ place.”
"Come on, it's ok. I won't hurt you," he crooned at the desk, "Just come here, I don't mind the puddle."
“Why?”
“No actual explosion. Just a match near my eyebrow. I had vaseline on each side to stop it spreading.”
“Well that will make a nice change” dripped John sarcastically and he pulled Sherlock to his feet. Pulling off the suit jacket, he looked at Sherlock for a moment, standing back and taking in the heaving chest, straining erection and lidded eyes. Leaning in, he grabbed the two sides of the dark blue silk shirt and yanked them apart, buttons flying in all directions and bit Sherlock’s nipples one at a time.
John rapidly strips his clothes. He had planned to leave his uniform jacket on but decides that maybe they should leave that for another time. Before hanging it up, he removes the wooden box from its pocket and pads into the living room, carefully leaving it on the mantelpiece, making sure it is precisely squared up.
This particular day on February was cold and the rain had been falling for five days straight, that drizzly kind of rain that seeps grey into everything, not the dramatic, energising downpour kind. They had spent the previous day with the cold rain dripping down their necks as they rooted through a skip in Kensington in search of a missing shoe for their latest case and today John was stiff, sore, grumpy and feeling old.
Greg and Katy arrived at 5.45 and had duly brought the tea bags. They all had a cup and while the two cousins chatted animatedly about school, eyeliner and YouTube vlogs, Greg and John went to get something to eat.
(See the end of the chapter for
The line went quiet. “He’s fighting for his life, John,” Alison’s voice cracked. She took a deep breath, “I have to go. I have others to call. Get the antibiotics. Please stay in touch.”
In the room, Emilia was reading her set Shakespearean text aloud to her Papa:-
As he had stood looking through the window Sherlock realised he had made a dreadful mistake. Mary had a gun. Which meant she had help. Mycroft had made sure she was under constant surveillance and they knew that she did not have a gun in her possession. So someone had known of their plan, organised the gun and taped it to the underside of one of the chairs.
“I didn’t. They were Michael’s suggestion. And an excellent one." He reached forward, slowly running his hand over John’s balls, up his jerking cock which pulsed in the tight, red pants and with a single finger, swiped a drop of pre-come from the head that rose above the waist band. John’s head fell back with a long, drawn out groan of pleasure. Sherlock took a small step back and admired the view for a long moment, before taking John by the hand and leading him to the sofa.
Oh that coffee is good! Should I eat? When did I last eat? There was the bread at breakfast, was that today? No, that was yesterday. They have pastries on the menu, I’ll have a pastry. Or maybe two. Could be a while before I eat next.
Still breathing heavily, Sherlock just about managed “Hmmm”. John watched him worriedly for a moment, the reality of the situation hitting him hard but Sherlock managed a sleepy smile, curled up in John’s arms and whispered, “Yours”.
Despite the last ten years in anonymity and living as a virtual recluse, there were still plenty of people here who remembered Sherlock Holmes. Acquaintances, well-wishers and fans all drifted to his table. He spoke to them all but none were invited to sit and join him. Sherlock was alone in this crowd.
An hour later, John and Sherlock are roused from sleep by the doorbell ringing. Exchanging sleepy looks, they agree to ignore it by the simple expedient of both closing their eyes again. When the doorbell rings a second time, held down for a continuous thirty seconds, John grumpily dons his dressing gown and stomps down the stairs.
Has moved me past all I can say,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
John had kissed him and his mind had begun to quiet, just a little. It would be an experiment. He would time how long it would take before John was repulsed enough, angry enough, to pull away and that would be that. Sherlock started his internal stopwatch and distracted himself by watching the second hand tick past. Ten, twenty, thirty.
Drying himself from the shower, Sherlock began to get dressed. He had a preferred way to dress, enjoyed the routine of putting on certain things in a certain order. He loved clothes and always had since he was a very small boy. He was acutely aware of how they changed the way other people regarded you and had often used this to manipulate situations to his advantage.
My thanks to my lovely beta Breath4Soul for her help and numerous improvements.
John nodded in agreement and began rooting around in cupboards and the fridge, settling on bolognaise. Sherlock closed his eyes and listened to the noises of his husband cooking, the low thud of the baseline from whatever music Emelia was listening to and the eclectic sounds of his city outside the window.
They stepped through the wooden church door together, holding hands for support. It was the first time John had been inside a church in a long time and was even longer for Sherlock. They sat quietly on the back pew until an elderly gentleman spotted them and came to insist they sat at the front with a gentle “It’s where you belong”. Sherlock was reluctant; he hated funerals and had not wanted to come, conceding only because of the family’s insistence. John gently pulled his hand and held on tight throughout the ceremony.
Sherlock was still sat on the sofa, mouth agape watching John’s back disappear out the door when his phone began to trill and vibrate on the table. He considered not answering it, following after John but it was Lestrade and frankly, he was happy for the distraction.
“Sherlock, why are you-?” John presses firmly on Sherlock’s ribcage nearest to him and rolls him over.
“Sorry, Rosie, I need to borrow Daddy and Sherlock, but I’ll have them back soon,” smiles Lestrade.
“Ok, I’m all done here. Let's go and choose your fabric and some accessories. Got to have the right shirt for a new suit.”
Sherlock came in slowly. He glanced at the broken window and Mary lying on the floor. He sat down near to John but not touching.
"Pull yourself together Benedict"
Sherlock nodded and watched in wonder as John disappeared into the bedroom, reappearing with their softest fleecy blanket and Sherlock’s old grey T shirt. John pulled off his cardigan and checked shirt, unbuttoned Sherlock’s pale blue shirt and handed him the T shirt.
“Experiment?”
John pulled Sherlock into a deep kiss, his hands roaming over the tight shirt and up under the back of the jacket, pulling Sherlock close into him. John fumbled with his own trousers and took Sherlock’s hand and pushed it inside to his erect cock. Taken completely by surprise, Sherlock tried to withdraw his hand but John gripped the wrist hard.
“Go on.”
“Well, that was…” John attempts.
Glancing at the clock, he realised Emilia would be arriving in from school soon and then it would be time for Sherlock’s bed bath so he had better pull himself together. He was so tired. Maybe tonight he should go home and sleep. But what if….
Oh how I enjoyed revealing these women's true identities. To be continued.
“I know why you did it. I know you were protecting us, drawing away the threat towards yourself, away from us. We have had a good life, I did my best to be a good Dad and protect her. It took a decade but I forgave you. I never forgot you”.
“Can I help you, love?”
The car lurched to a stop outside 221 Baker Street and Sherlock rushed to the door. It was already ajar. Silently he crept in, glancing up the stairs to his own flat but heading for Mrs. Hudson’s door. He heard a male voice, Mrs Hudson crying and begging then a man laughing. Sherlock looked around for some sort of weapon, finding an umbrella drying in a stand.
Violet Holmes looked from Mary to Agent Hudson and sighed:
“Come on, then. Let’s get this done. I have some plans for you later”
“Ok, and please, call me Eoin. Well, my predecessor, Professor Aidan O’Neill, was head of archaeology here for 40 years. He was a great man, never stopped moving with the new technologies and techniques. He was the first to document the story.”
John was sat at the desk, painstakingly working on his latest blog entry. Sherlock, mindful of his manners, just about managed a “John, I ..” before pulling John’s chair back from the desk and throwing his leg across his blogger who suddenly had a very full lap of whimpering detective. Utterly unable to wait any longer, Sherlock plunged in, wrapping himself bodily around John and peppering his face and neck with floaty little pecks before drawing John into a deep, soft exploration of tongues and teeth. Parting, Sherlock let out a long, shaky sigh, stood, grabbed his suit jacket and headed for the flat door. He had a rather interesting spleen awaiting him at the morgue. Poor John was left panting slightly and indescribably hard.
Coffee’s gone cold, I’ll get another then move on, need to visit the library, meet Babic at two. Maybe time to make a move now, it’s getting busy, too many people around. Getting warm. Wonder what the weather is like in London? Probably raining. I miss London, miss the smell of it. Nowhere smells like home. You’re getting sentimental.
“Yours is my absolute favourite. The nicest, prettiest, most talented and,” he took a deep breath “largest I have ever seen.” he gave said penis an admiring pat, only to find it quite hard, clearly enjoying being the centre of attention and praise.
John gaped. He tried to pull a sentence together in his head but nothing happened, so he just stood and stared at Sherlock in horror. He thought I was being sarcastic, finally filtered through to his conscious mind, he doesn’t think it’s true. Then an idea popped into his head. Oh, Sherlock Holmes was not the only genius in this flat.
_______________________________
Sherlock was desperately trying to move upwards, towards the surface, to breathe. The more he tried, the thicker the nothingness around him became, morphing from air, to water to treacle. It was exhausting. He was panting, recovering from his last effort when the rumbling noise came again, louder this time, closer. Sherlock listened intently trying to work out what the sound was. He surged up again, determined, and followed the sound.
“Hmmmm?” John is more interested in stroking Sherlock’s left ear. Sherlock catches him by the wrist and steadies John’s hand, placing it on Sherlock’s chest and holding it there with his own.
“I did” John replied.
“What then?”
Mary was astonished to see all the other women in the room nodding in understanding.
And hate the idle pleasures of these days”
John was confused. He had never heard anyone describe either Holmes brother as 'lovely'. Michael leaned in seeing John's frown. "Sherlock and I are old friends. Some people never look beyond the surface, do they? Their loss, I always say."
What he does is step in, his full body pressing into Sherlock as his left hand slowly traces down Sherlock’s stomach, hip and thigh until John reaches his hard dick, and gives it just one long slow slide upwards to appreciate the heat, girth and length of the man. John buries his nose in the back of Sherlock’s neck inhaling his citrusy aftershave and the intoxicating scent of his skin.
“Lestrade? Yes. Well, I did have plans. Well, yes I… locked room? Of course. Text me the address”. He turned to face John, raising his eyebrows. John nodded at him “We are on our way”.
“Of course,” Sherlock answered to her retreating back.
“Which floor is the flat on?” John asked.
“You know, I have nothing to do with this, Greg. Why are you doing this to me?”
“Then I would trail my fingers up and down your neck. Just light, small strokes until your shoulders drop as your breathing deepens and your eyes close”
This is it! The last story for my 30 'ahem' days of Sherlock. For the prompts eyes and glasses.
Sherlock sprawled in his favourite spot, pulling John down on top of him. Now aligned more equally, John frotted once, twice, against Sherlock’s cock, bending low to kiss and nip his way up Sherlock’s neck. It occurred to Sherlock that a lot had changed in the 24 hours since he had last lain on this sofa, pining, for that was undoubtedly what he had been doing, for John.
For all their physical beauty, John had always been far more astounded by what those eyes could actually see. From Sherlock’s sweep of a person followed by breakneck deductions to the infinitesimally small clues they collected at a crime scene, he has experienced their uniqueness a thousand times over. More importantly, though was the way Sherlock truly saw John, the way he had seen John the first time they had met, looking past the comfy exterior to the very heart and identity of the man. Then winked at him.
The two men stared at each other and at their beautiful daughter. John was trying very hard not to go through all the possible effects of meningitis. He also could not put Emelia down.
“Yours. Only ever. Yours”.
“Indeed,” Eoin flashes a grin at John and slaps his hands together in glee, “The Ballytoohin Hoard!”
“Ha Watson! You know she’s not even yours!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. Many times. He would say he wanted marriage, a home and a family but whenever I tried to suggest we actually arrange any of these things, he would back away”. This was true, Sherlock deduced but doubted that the decision to end the relationship had been entirely Eloise’s decision.
John stood up in the bath, water cascading everywhere. The noise shocked him after the unhurried silence. Sherlock started at the sudden movement, the open exhibition John was making of himself, showing Sherlock more than ever before. In that split second, Sherlock understood it was time. Time to stop being a coward, time to stop blaming himself for the death of John’s baby. Time to stop apologising for leaving John. Time to stop hiding, from himself, from John. Time to lay out his raw, naked heart to John and find out if it will be caressed and protected or thrown down and marched over.
There it is. The name calling is back and the pretty words are gone. Sherlock closes his eyes, not able to watch John climb of of the bed and retreat away from him again.
John Watson levered himself up, groaning at the stiffness in his knees and followed Sherlock out of the door.
“Not really. It means they think he is going to stay like this for a long time” John rubbed a hand over his face “maybe a very long time”.
“Too gorgeous”
Sherlock closed his eyes just for a moment while John paid the cabbie.

Slumping forward onto Sherlock’s belly, he pulled out, panting and sweating. Sherlock lowered his shaking legs and wrapped John in his arms and pulled him down to his chest, kissing his eyes lids and nose.
“Oh love, what have to done to yourself this time?”, John had muttered.
“Jealous!” Sherlock shouted back “Jealous of what? Of Mycroft being saddled with that inept excuse for a policeman. Or Lestrade getting my emotionally crippled brother?”
This story wanted to be a lot longer and there are probably a few plot holes but I just needed to get it finished.
Sherlock hasn’t moved while he has been gone and John kneels over him, thighs straddling Sherlock’s and brushes his balls slowly over Sherlock’s arse, eliciting a groan. Lowering his weight down gently, he wraps his arms under Sherlock and lays his head between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, waiting for their breathing to align.
scared and did the only thing she could to show it, cry. This time, the cries were loud and persistent, coming in waves as only the cries of a new born can, becoming more high-pitched and louder with every moment.
As the car sped back to Baker Street, A text came in from Billy;
“Good. That is… I’m here to collect John’s suit.” he tucked his hands behind his back and rocked slightly on his heels.
“Would it be ok if I watched you undress?” asked John as he sat down on the end of the wooden bed as Sherlock bent and removed his shoes and socks. The long fingers moved to his waist and Sherlock removed his belt and the dark grey trousers. John admired the elegant long feet, sleekly muscled legs and the obvious bulge in the navy blue silk boxers. Sherlock was gazing back at John, meeting and holding his eyes. He carefully unbuttoned each cuff and then the front of the shirt. As he slipped it over his broad shoulders, John breathed out hard, not having realised he was holding his breath.
Less than an hour after the birth of their baby, John and Mary had reached an agreement that she was to be allowed to go free on the condition that she never make contact with John, Sherlock or most especially, Charlotte, ever again.
The only response was grunt.
"Sher-." John tried to object but Sherlock, and his coat, had already left.
His last contact, the one that sliced his calf so efficiently with a short, sharp blade, has been the first to laugh when informed that Moriarty was dead. Moriarty will never be dead, the woman had giggled as Sherlock held her own knife to her heart, never dead while there are still so many of them alive, so many other Moriartys. Sherlock had thought it the ravings of a mad woman until she had leaned into the blade, piercing her own chest and whispered,
(See the end of the chapter for
“John. Are we a couple now?”
Michael rested back on his heels, tape measure in his lap and threw back his head and laughed. “Did he give you that ‘married to his work’ line? Yeah, don’t mind that. He’s just a bit shy. He clearly likes you to have moved you in. I never got past the front door.” Michael returned to his measuring “And I can see why he likes you.” He grinned. “You are a gentleman of significance, if you don’t mind me saying so. Sorry, sorry, that was a bit unprofessional. Ignore me. I’m just a bit giddy that Sherlock has found someone. I do worry about him.”
“Yes, John I wish to conduct an experiment into how many different ways, and in doing so establish a hierarchy of effectiveness, I can bring you to orgasm”.
His rise was halted by John’s right hand coming to rest on top of Sherlock’s and holding it there. Sherlock, nervous and hesitant, leaned slowly down and placed the lightest of kisses imaginable on the top of John’s head. John turned his head, pulled Sherlock’s hand a little further down, tuned it over and gently, kissed the palm.
The three men checked themselves and were blessedly uninjured with no-one bleeding, which made a pleasant change, John thought. Greg and Mycroft confirmed that they were indeed handcuffed to Sherlock but that his head was still lolling forwards, unconscious. They tried shouting his name and pinching his hands to bring him back around but with no success. Mycroft confirmed there was a pulse at his wrist but that it was not very strong. John began to get very concerned.
“He was not revenging me. I really was over Mark surprisingly quickly, he was probably right to end things. Especially as I learned this afternoon is that my brother had been having an affair with Mark for the last two years. Apparently, Evan was far more in love with him than I had ever been. When Mark broke up with me, he also broke it off with Evan, wanting a clean break, a new start”.
By the time he had reached the clinic, John had resolved once again to tell Sherlock. It was simple really. Sherlock, look, I know you don’t want to know or do anything about it, but I fancy the pants off you and so I pretended a man was you and sucked him off and now he’s dead, but it’s all fine and we’re fine, just thought you should know.
No, not at all, I woke up that way, I’m so sorry. Oh, that, not it's just a reaction to my….. tea. Purely physical. Apologies John, it was merely the friction of my sheet. “Hnnng,” replied Sherlock. Oh, God, shoot me now.
“The Guards followed every lead they could, including the local man and James Murphy Jnr, and hit nothing but dead ends. A number of theories were developed and pursued but nothing came of it or the investigation into the disappearance of Charles Doyle. In 1971, Professor O’Neill took it on from an academic and historical viewpoint. He spent twenty years on and off looking for the hoard but without success. That book I gave you outlines all his research. He passed the gauntlet to me when I took over as Head of Department.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You found him then?” She made her way over to them.
“You’re gorgeous in that shirt. I can see a hint of your skin and it fits you perfectly”
Oh, God, oh, God. Abort, abort! Sherlock tried to step back but John reached out and caught his arm.
John leans down and kisses the end of Sherlock’s nose. “I know that, you berk. Well, I worked it out eventually. I saw the patterns; Rosie’s bedtime, always being back in the flat.
“You said, in front of Lestrade and Stamford, not to mention a pub packed full of people, that I had a beautiful and big dick!”
The first slap on his arse stung and Sherlock recoiled. It was rapidly followed by a soothing stroke from the same hand. The second slap was harder and burned slightly. The next slaps came in quick succession, some just on one cheek, some on both. Sherlock arched his back up, presenting his arse for more. He deserved this after all for failing everyone, would give John whatever he wanted. The next slap came hard, fingers making contact with his balls and Sherlock whimpered. John eased up, stroking his hand gently across the hot, red flesh and gently stroking Sherlock’s beautifully displayed anus with a single fingertip.
Greg brought Emilia and Katy home. John wanted a few minutes by himself with Sherlock and Mycroft would have her dropped back to the flat to him. He had decided he really did need to get some sleep, in a bed. Their bed.
Michael had reopened a door on the hope that Sherlock had so firmly slammed shut that night in Angelo’s and John flitted from the vision of Sherlock draped over the sofa to being in full flight as they chased a suspect, the muscles of his long thighs flexing as he ran.
With extreme effort and self-control, John stopped the screaming in his head from coming out of his mouth “No. You don’t get to choose that. You gave up that right, remember?” His voice was quiet so as not to wake Charlotte but steely grey with fury. For the first time Mary looked up at him.
“What the hell is this all about, Mycroft? What has your mother got to do with all this?”
Shocked by his abruptness, her hands flutter to her face and she studies him. She changes her mind about whatever she was going to say and heads off to make breakfast, glancing anxiously back at him as she rushes out of the room.
Stretched out on the sofa, fingers steepled under his chin, Sherlock considered all the information he had gathered so far for this case. He reviewed the layout of the flat, what he knew about the popular man and the wound to his head. Several things were bothering him; the scuff on the man’s brand new left shoe, the mobile phone being under the bed, the lack of signs of anyone else in the flat, the drugs and now a heart broken ex-girlfriend. Oh, and John. His John. What did he have to do with all this?
“Look, John, when ‘b’ and ‘h’ are together, they make the ‘v’ sound and ‘s’ with ‘e’ makes ‘sh’. It’s fascinating!”
“Please John, I have to. She’s mine, my flesh and blood and all I have! You can’t do this to me, you and that, that junkie sociopath you’re so fond of”. Charlotte stirred slightly at Mary’s screeching.
“What do you want?” he stuttered, voice deep with desire.
Inside, Mycroft looked up from his exam revision to see his little brother, eyes wide in alarm, gasping. Felicia, Mycroft’s black and white cat was stretched beside him on the bench, half covering his military history text book, paws delicately crossed over a picture of Winston Churchill. When Mycroft stretched out his arms to his little brother, the cat yawned, stood up and relocated herself on a cushion further down the bench, eyeing Redbeard.
“Mark Willis was lured out to the balcony by a phone call from his killer. They spoke briefly, long enough for Willis to drink his whiskey. Ending the conversation, he was stood just here at the entrance, still looking outside when he was hit on the side of the head by a hockey ball, hit with great force from that roof top. Willis died immediately and fell back, the phone being thrown underneath the bed from his right hand hand and the glass thrown over his head from the left hand, coming to rest below the chest of drawers. As he fell, his left shoe caught on the already closing balcony door and gave it just enough of a push that it clicked shut, locking automatically as it closed. I was unsure if the ball had rolled into the flat or back down over the balcony”
“Of course, text her there. Ask Greg to bring some tea bags”. After the first week, John had brought mugs and a kettle to the hospital room, because the hospital tea was going to kill him faster than anything else. “Got much homework love?”
“I do believe it is my turn” smiled Sherlock, gently pushing his husband off him and standing. John remained sprawled on the sofa and Sherlock covered his naked arse with the closest thing to hand, a spare pink baby blanket, wiped his belly and hands with a baby wipe and went to collect their daughter.
“Holding

"Too late mate, I've found it." John's hand had landed into a very wet patch on the rug. He wiped it on his pajamas, not that it helped much.
“How does this work, then? How can we...I.. shit.” John takes a deep breath and tries a different tack.
“Up on your hands and knees” John had moved closer.
The sight that greets his eyes on his return makes his heart leap and his cock jump. Sherlock is completely naked, laid out face down on their bed like a starfish, his right leg dangling slightly off the edge. All the sheets and blankets are shoved to the end of the bed.
“That’s different, that’s our place of work, this was just the pub and it was a compliment. Most blokes would love to have someone say something like that about them.” John’s head was throbbing with the effort of the discussion.
Inside the cabbies, Mary tilted her head at John’s small smile “Oh I see, you think I won’t do it. You think that my feelings for you will stop me from shooting you. Really, John, that just goes to show how little you really know me after all”
He ended the call and immediately dialled another. As he spoke he began slowly walking up and down the hallway, adding a small bounce to his step.
This story features John and Sherlock's daughter Emelia who originates in Chapters 4 and 6 of my work
“John, I wish to request your assistance in a certain matter tomorrow. I have extended my request to my brother but, as yet, he seems unable to respond. As usual, I shall leave him in your capable hands, but whether or not he deems to attend, please understand that I would very much appreciate your own co-operation.  A car shall be sent for 11.30 am. It is a formal matter and a suit would be appropriate attire.”
Sherlock just about managed to shower, shave and even get dressed before the tickle began again at the back of his brain. He was rather proud of having got so much done. It didn’t take long before the tickle became an itch, then transformed into a dense pressure in his solar plexus. This time he prowled out of the bedroom in search of his next fix.
“It’s all gone a bit tits up ere mate. You’d want to ‘urry up, init?”
John gaped back at Greg. This was getting away from him very quickly. All he wanted was to walk home and cook some dinner for himself and Sherlock. He sighed inwardly at the idea of Sherlock. He turned and began to walk away “I’ll call you in a while, yeah?”
Sherlock humphed and turned onto his side, the sofa creaking at his wild movements. He pulled his knees to his chest and dragged his long-suffering dressing gown tightly around himself, unconsciously drawing his arms around in a poor imitation of a hug.
“I hurt you John. Again. You didn’t want me to come to the hospital with you, didn’t call and you didn’t answer my texts. Who could blame you for not wanting me?”
“She’s dead, Sherlock. I was looking her in the eye and they shot her. I thought I had done it” the tears kept coming “I’m covered in her blood”.
John had been leaning over him as he regained consciousness and was gently touching the bleeding spot on Sherlock's head:
Prompt 17, Holding Hands
John was flicking on the kettle to boil when he heard the small noise in the living room. Presuming it was Sherlock back already he popped out his head to offer him tea. He pulled up short at the sight of Mary standing in the middle of the room staring at their sleeping baby in her Moses basket. He breathed in through his nose and exhaled slowly so as not to over-react.
A bird, Sherlock decided the next time he heard it. This time, the noise lasted longer and was high pitched, rising and falling like music. There was a new sound too this time. A deeper, resonant sound that Sherlock really liked but it was muffled like he was under water. That thought made Sherlock panicky. Maybe he was underwater? Maybe he needed to breathe? He began to grasp for breath, nothing coming. Now he began to really worry and decided to try and get to the surface. He really wanted to hear that new sound again.
Sherlock’s hands hovered at his pyjama waistbands, awash with uncertainty, heart pounding. He suddenly wanted to run away. He avoided John’s ravenous gaze, looked at his feet and, not for the first time in his life, wondered what was wrong with him.
“You were smouldering, John. My apologies. Indeed, I believe apologies may be in order all round." Sherlock nodded at what remained of John’s suit; the full right sleeve was missing, as was the left shoulder, most of the bottom half of the jacket and a large proportion of the bottom half of both legs.
“Rescued?”
“I had more important things to attend to at the time, but now I return to being all yours”.
came when she cried and held her tightly, hugged her, rocked her and sang to her. Charlotte loved his singing. He smelled safe, of home and milk and a wet, fluffy smell that meant warmgentlemine. He said he was called Daddy. When he chatted away to her, he would always say “Who’s Daddys best girl, hmm?” and “Christ Charlotte, how come you saved that nappy for Daddy? Couldn’t Sherlock have had that one, just for a change?”
After much consideration, it was agreed that Sunday would be the best time to try weaning. There would be no time pressure and the research Sherlock had done indicated that there may be some clearing up required. The previous day, the three had gone on a shopping spree. A new high chair was invested in, a smart wooden one that would later covert into a toddler chair and table, new bibs, spoons that changed colour when they were too hot for a baby, ice cube trays, lidded plastic containers, a new blender and lots and lots of baby wipes. They then went to the greengrocers and bought organic pears, apples, avocados, potatoes, carrots and parsnips. John’s hand had hovered over the apricots only to feel Sherlock’s eyes boring in to him.
