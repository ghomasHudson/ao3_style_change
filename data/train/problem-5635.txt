“Captain America, as I live and breathe,” the guy said, arms wide in welcoming. “This is my girlfriend, Mockingbird. She’s the one who got you down here.”
Steve put a hand on Tony’s neck and kneaded his fingertips into his wire-tight muscles. It helped, a little.
Brandon Beckham watched in delight as his girlfriend casually lifted the front of his car, one hand holding the bumper, the other hand under crucial examination.
“Steve, no one would know to look for this. This wasn’t in the manual the adoption agency gave us. We didn’t know.”
Peter pulled off the hood of his suit so Bruce could check his pupils and how well his eyes tracked the doctor’s finger.
Tony snapped his goggles off and grabbed a chair from one of the other worktables, dragging it by an arm until he was sitting directly across from Steve.
Jarvis had limited functions on his phone so Tony pulled his suit back on, leaving the face plate up and out.
It was over seventy degrees in the tower. Warm enough that Tony knew Peter adjusted the thermostat when Steve wasn’t home. Steve didn’t need a sweater in this climate. Especially not when he was already wearing a fleece thermal.
Steve knew Tony was right. He was always right. He was Tony Stark, and if someone could figure it out, it was him.
“Alright. Let’s pack all of this up, grab the trust fund fetus, and get back on the jet,” Tony ordered. “Once the perimeter has been cleared and we’ve checked the rest of the house, there’s nothing more to do here. Nat can question the fetus with S.H.I.E.L.D. and I’ll work with Bruce to see what the hell all of this was used for.”
“So now that we’ve established which one of you knuckleheads will support Spider-Man in his academic endeavors,” Fury interrupted, “Can we get back to the issue at hand? Obviously, we need to monitor the status of the tower and make sure Beckham hasn’t found any way to access Stark’s tech in our absence.”
Peter’s eyes were wide and scared. Sometimes Tony forgot Peter was a kid. No kid should be around for this. “Dad, is he-”
At first, Peter couldn’t tell why Tony’s voice felt like it was coming from behind him. He was half blind from the tears and half deaf from the rage pounding in his ears.
“Where’d they go?” Clint asked. He still had an arrow cocked for when the opportunity presented itself. “We saw Wheaton climbing the tower so she has to be-”
“Oh, you like that, do you? Sexual predator. I swear.” Tony reached up to flatten a lock of Steve’s hair that was sticking straight up and rustled the blanket. When the blanket fell further down Steve’s shoulders, Tony saw that the bandage covering Steve’s missing skin had been picked free. The wound was angry and pink and definitely not sterile anymore. “Oh, shit. Steve, your neck-”
“What Pops is trying to say,” Tony interrupted, “is keep your grimy, street child hands away from the open wound.”
It made sense. If Wheaton had powers, and Beckham could get one of the suits, they would be an actual threat. A wannabe Stark-Rogers duo.
Tony knew all of this from the report, and because Steve had told him early one morning, but it still messed with him. Hearing their son’s voice coming from someone else… he didn’t like the idea of that.
Because his stomach also felt smaller. Not by much, but by enough that he wanted to jump up and celebrate.
Peter shrugged. “What is there to talk about? You’re going to make me go to therapy and start spying on me and I’m- I’m never going to-”
He wedged the fleshy bit of his palm between his teeth before he could sob verbally. Tears threatened to drip down his cheeks.
Once he was out of the gym, Steve ran back upstairs and slammed his bedroom door hard enough to rattle the door in its frame. It was that or scream. And screaming would just scare Peter more and distract Tony from taking care of their son.
Tony shrugged. “School? Ned’s? He wouldn’t go to any of the Stark Industries offices or to any of the other Avengers. He knows we’d find him.”
Nat had pushed Steve’s cowl off, leaving his face and cornsilk hair bare in the harsh light. He looked young. And pale. Too pale.
When the tub was full, Tony helped Steve get to his feet and shakily strip out of the many, many layers he had crammed on. Every layer of clothing removed sent a wave of tremors through Steve’s body.
First, the sound of glass shattering as they watched the shards rain down the outside of the window. Then came the shuddering explosion as the missile blew up the top of the tower.
Peter whimpered but kept his lips pressed together. When he was positive he wasn’t going to scream or vomit from the pain, he nodded to Bruce in appreciation. It was always worse when he knew it was coming.
The label was burning a hole in Tony’s pocket yet he couldn’t help believing that as bad as this was, if Peter did get to see the calorie count… It would only be that much worse.
Tony himself was wearing loungewear but there was no way his itty bitty fitted pants would make it past Steve’s calves. He tried not to let it get to his pride.
Crashing footsteps announced Tony’s entrance before his aggressive swearing started up. “Kid, I would say something about you flying across the room like Spider-Man, but, well-”
Steve hated texting more than Tony hated decaf, but he’d painstakingly sent out texts to every member of the Avengers about his son’s whereabouts. “Nothing.”
“He needs to start eating again.” Bruce conceded. “Actual spiders can go a month or two without food if they’ve been eating regularly and have access to a water source. But I’m going to guess, since Peter is a combination of human and spider genetics and is much more active than an actual spider… He’s going to start slowing down. Getting drowsy and lethargic.”
God, what had Steve told him about first aid? Tony should’ve paid attention instead of spending the whole lesson trying to get Steve to spank him. It would’ve been useful information to remember about now.
“Pops,” Peter whispered, refusing to look at either of his fathers. “You have to say that. You’re my dad.”
Tony pushed his sunglasses up higher and tugged his baseball cap down over his brow. “We’ll find him. He’s probably pouting somewhere at school. I’ll text Ned and MJ real quick. Make sure he isn’t hiding with them.”
Clint made a face but it passed. “Okay. Then tell me what you know about this duo that’s going to attack us.”
Tony and Clint were fighting over the lone everything bagel as Nat sidled up beside Steve. He didn’t even realize she’d crossed the room until her shoulder came to rest against his arm.
“Maybe we got lucky and they left with all the goods before we showed up?” Clint suggested, reaching back to notch an arrow before he remembered he still had his first one. He hadn’t even shot anyone yet. “Tony, I’m getting a bad feeling about this.”
Peter toweled his hair dry and slipped into a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. His legs were already sore. “Got it, Jarvis. Thanks.”
Hello everyone! I hope the holiday season is treating you well and if it isn't, fuck corporations for making us care about the holidays in the first place. I've been really struggling to manage my time post-finals but hopefully, I'll get into a nice writing rhythm and be able to post a bunch of chapters before classes start up again.
“Do you know how many pictures I take a day in that sorority house, B?” Liz grinned and spoke through her teeth. “Dozens. Dozens of pictures. Forgive me for not wanting to pose for yet another
“I’m going to be home as soon as I possibly can, Steve. I promise.” Tony didn’t have any reassurances. He didn’t have any advice. He didn’t know what to do. This wasn’t nightmares or panic attacks or PTSD. There wasn’t a S.H.I.E.L.D. mandated training module on what to do when your son… when Peter needed help with something
Hello everyone! I hope your semester and year are going well. Stay safe, self care, read fanfiction, all that good stuff.
Peter was staring out the window as Pops, Bruce, and Fury spoke in hushed tones around the table. If Peter wanted to, he could focus in on their voices and listen to what they were saying, but so far, they were just strategizing, and it was boring.
Tony rubbed his face, careful of the cut above his eye. “Come sit. I promise. I won’t bite you or anything like that.”
“Pops!” Peter yelled, pain leaking into his voice even as he tried his best to tamper it down. He couldn’t see Steve through the fire and debris but he knew his father could hear him. “Pops, pull us up! I can’t. I think the strain pulled my shoulders out of-”
“Hey,” Tony said, carding his fingers through Steve’s hair. “You were knocked out by that teenage dweeboid. He took some DNA so your neck might sting a bit. Don’t worry, I already bandaged it.”
“It’s about Peter,” Bruce began. “I was checking his shoulders since they were dislocated when he caught you-” Tony’s face fell at the idea of Peter getting hurt while trying to save him but Steve’s hand dropping onto his thigh before he could spiral too far. “Guys, his spine? It’s bruised. Pretty bad, too. And the bruising is old in some spots, new in others. Do you have any idea what it’s from? I’m only telling you because I would want to know if it was my kid.”
Everyone knew it was bullshit. Peter Stark-Rogers was the pinnacle of perfection when it came to school. But fortunately for everyone, Peter began to stir at that exact moment.
Steve was still shaking when Tony got back, his hands tucked beneath his arms. His lips were turning purple, then blue. It wasn’t warm on the quinjet, they were flying after all, but there was no way it was cold enough to get past the super serum. Something was off.
Tony’s heart seized when he realized Steve’s eyes were watering. He took Steve in, head to toe, but he couldn’t see anything under the suit. No swelling, no blood, nothing. “Oh shit, Steve, am I hurting you? Are you hurt?”
“MJ says she hasn’t heard from Peter today. Ditto on Ned. Ned offered me hourly updates, but I opted out.” Tony turned to Steve. “Anything from the team?”
Peter made a ‘sort-of’ gesture with his hand. “I have a paper for English. The rest I got done last night.”
he got back. When Tony could help watch Peter and make sure whatever his son was going through was handled with all the sensitivity and care Tony wished his own teenage angsts had been handled with.
Even in their dire situation, Tony felt elation ripple through his chest. He had made Natasha fucking Romanov
“Tony, she got him.” Steve gently turned Peter’s head so he could better see the small wound. Unconsciously, his other hand started rubbing the spot where his own cut had been. “What is she going to do with it?”
With that, Brandon flipped two switches on the wall, causing two steel doors to drop down into the previously open doorways. The doors clicked into place with a paired
Peter was a superhuman, like Steve, and needed more calories a day than the average teenage boy. Teenage boys, on average, ate their weight every few hours. Peter needed even more than that.
The old man grumbled back some offensive racial slurs and Steve was tempted to push the man again himself.
“Superhero family therapy,” Tony mussed. “Super-fam-apy. There you go. Now it even has a cool name.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but Steve was right. Even though he was trying his hardest not to show it, the breaths had worked. Steadied him. He didn’t feel like he was going to vibrate out of his skin anymore.
“Maybe it’s because of the recent mission,” Tony murmured. “Clint got hit in the head right next to him. There was a lot of blood. Do you think he’s struggling with hero stuff?”
“Well, we might be living this way for a bit, depending on the plan.” Cap rubbed the back of his neck and ran a hand back and forth over his hair, trying to lessen the cowl-head as much as he could.
metal suit? Yeah, great plan. Leave a human tank behind so someone doesn’t try to take the weapon. That’s like refusing to take a gun to a street fight because you’re worried someone will snatch it out of your hand.”
Either way, a few blocks from their stop, Tony sat straight up and let out a string of expletives more colorful than Manhattan Pride.
Tony shared a few words with Happy- confirming that Peter had stayed in last night and Ned was still here- before turning his attention back to Steve.
Peter wanted to stand up and shake it off but his whole body ached from the impact. Just touching his cheek took enough energy to reignite the black dots in his vision. Instead, he rolled onto his back and finally tuned in to Jarvis’s ramblings.
“Don’t do anything stupid, Tony,” Steve cautioned, testing his grip on his shield with one hand as the other adjusted his cowl.
About half an hour later, eyelashes and lids crusty with salt, Peter pulled himself together enough to put some lie together. A bad lie but better than the truth.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “Honestly, I have no idea. He’s been, uh, working through something lately so maybe- maybe it’s that?”
Bruce stepped forward and Peter jumped back, hitting the wall of weapons and knocking some knives free from their hooks.
“No,” Ned rolled over so he was staring at Peter, eyes bleary and squinting from the bright light of the TV. A few hours ago, Peter and Ned had each taken their respective couches in the living room with piles of blankets to properly marathon the entire
Tony went back to the bathroom for a piece of medical tape. When Peter came to, there was a very real chance he would pull free of the IV and Tony did not want to have to reinsert the needle.
Steve caught on and went to get dressed himself. They couldn’t comb the streets for their son with Steve in his underwear. “Yeah, me, too.”
need to take care of myself. You want to talk about sleeping, Tony? Or meds? Fine, let’s talk. But your habits are going to be part of the discussion, too.”
He didn’t want them to ask questions or put together the pieces as to how or why exactly he was currently laying in a puddle of his own sweat and unable to get up off the floor.
Nat sat beside him while she finished her half, purposefully chewing slowly and within Peter’s view. As if enjoying the food in his line of sight would entice him to eat something himself.
“Tony, I’m sorry. I just… I don’t know what to do and he- Tony.” Steve’s voice dropped even lower. Quiet enough that Tony barely heard him. “He looks thin.”
Tony dropped his tools and splayed his hands on either side of the mess, taking a deep breath before looking Steve’s way. “Tell me I’m wrong then.”
Steve nodded, pulled the hood of his coat up around Peter’s ears. It was going to get blood on it, but that was fine. Steve could buy another coat.
“Steve, giving someone a trust fund and a name like that… you’re giving them a golden ticket for super-villain-ry.” Steve was not entertained. Harsh crowd. “But I digress. There’s no way I’m letting him anywhere near you. None. Not again. Not after last time.”
Steve tried to appear stately, like a proper leader, but his cheeks and neck flushed as soon as one of Tony’s hands gripped his ass.
“He’s fine,” Steve whispered. He was saying it for himself, but it couldn’t hurt for Tony to hear it, too. “He’s fine.”
But none of this was okay. Peter wasn’t eating. Peter had passed out on the treadmill. Peter probably wasn’t sleeping again, too, and Steve himself was still reeling from almost dying during their last mission. And Tony was on the damned quinjet heading across the country.
Steve settled one of his palms between Peter’s shoulder blades. Firm pressure. Low stimulation. Privacy.
CW: drugging of a minor (villainy stuff), PSTD, anxiety attacks, disordered eating and disordered eating behaviors, discussion of substance use.
“There’s one over there.” He held out his arm and Liz’s fingers looped around his elbow. “We’ll get you a snack and then it’s time to hit the tower.”
Wow. Ned was good at this. Explaining things in a way that didn’t quell Peter’s anxiety- nothing could eliminate it completely- but enough for his heart to slow and his mind to clear. “You’re right.”
“Kid, the mission was a bit rough for him. He’s fine, physically, but he just- he needs some time, some sleep. He’ll be out for lunch, all right?”
Peter’s voice followed Tony into his lab where he was trying to make a last minute repair on one of the gears in the face plate of the Iron Man suit.
Tony angled his palm so the beam would go over Steve’s head if he was standing nearby and fired at the upper seam of the door. Gradually, the steel began to melt away and light leaked into the hall.
“He had that huge crush on the other intern at Stark Industries and never exercised for her,” Steve added. “Actually, he used visiting her as an excuse to get out of working out with me.”
Walking, running, hiding. Anything but sitting around the tower idle. Because the moment he was idle, the moment his mind got to wander… all he could think about was
“Fuck you and your eye patch,” Tony grumbled, taking the file into his hands and sifting through it.
Peter pulled back and grinned. “Sorry, sorry! I’m just glad you’re okay. JARVIS was being cryptic.” He glanced over Tony’s shoulder and confusion flooded his eyes. “Where’s Pops?”
Peter wasn’t going to die in one day. Peter had been injured and shot up and drugged and plenty of other things that should’ve killed him but didn’t.
Peter rolled his eyes. He only threw up because he got on the treadmill after breakfast and big meals don’t agree with distance cardio.
“Monkey,” Tony started, his voice catching as he coughed to clear his throat. “There’s no way out of this.”
“Actually, I do need something.” Nat lifted a single brow. “It’s Steve. Whatever the hell that guy did to him- it’s messing with his head. I need blankets, sweatshirts, anything to get him warm.”
Tony flipped his face plate’s filter onto internal air seconds before Clint slumped into him and Nat stumbled up to his side. She grabbed Tony’s arm, eyes determined before falling down beside Clint, unconscious.
A hint of abs rippled, the barest evidence of that weird muscle ‘V’ girls at school gabbed about during PE. But nothing in the face of Steve. He never saw Tony shirtless- the scars and machinery in his chest made his dad a bit self-conscious- but Peter’s mind could conjure up an image of Tony that made him just as toned as Steve, just more wiry.
Peter rolled his eyes for what felt like the thirtieth time today. Why were all the adults in his life convinced he would “get lonely and bored” and make poor life choices? Choices like going out as Spider-Man when there were no other heroes in the city.
Steve thought about saying something, something about the pills or the nightmares or their son, but by the time he had the words, he was too close to sleep to figure out how to make his mouth say them.
As irritated as Tony was that he couldn’t work right now, or at least work off some of the caffeine pills he swallowed twenty minutes before Steve fell asleep, he wouldn’t trade his position for anything.
Steve melted into Tony’s arms a little. “I’m still mad at you, Tony.” But his words didn’t hold any of the venom from before. They were breathy. Exhausted.
The three of them sat there absorbing the information. Bruce grimaced as Steve’s hand massaged the cap of Tony’s knee. It wasn’t an easy mental image to sit with. Peter, wide eyed and frantic, pushing through dozens of sit ups in the dark as his spine purpled…
Tony thought about how Peter had been lying on the bench, staring at the wall. Maybe he was just being moody… or maybe it was exhaustion. “What can we do? Besides force-feeding him with a tube.”
Peter pulled his hood off and smiled. “It’s no big deal, I was just being a superhero, you know? Saving people, stopping the bad guys.” Peter’s face shifted. “Wait. These bad guys. How are we going to stop them, Dad? Do you guys have a plan yet?”
Tony’s eye twitch may or may not have started up again right before Fury’s number popped up on his phone.
Their bedroom was the second door off the elevator and Steve all but fell onto the bed, burrowing under the covers with his back to the door.
“Peter, how can you say that?” Steve asked, his exhausted eyes searching his son’s. He knelt in front of Peter so they were about level. “You’re not pathetic. You’re a city-wide hero and you haven’t even finished high school. You have a mind that rivals, if not surpasses, your dad’s and he’s the smartest man I’ve ever met. You’re kind and funny, two things the world could always use more of. You are not pathetic.”
But they did. Tony couldn’t leave them to handle this one on their own. Steve’s DNA was in the hands of some trust fund brat with a God complex and that was not a promising sign for the future of the human race.
Peter tightened his arms across his ribs and scowled. It would be easier to focus if Steve wasn’t waving a slice of pizza in his face. “Yeah. Pops, it’s just a stomach thing, okay? I’ll be fine in the morning. Just- just leave me alone.”
Immediately, he ran to the side and tried to curl his fingers under and lift. But it had clicked into place, locking into notches on the concrete floor. He was trapped, at least for now. He curled his fingers around the thick mesh, the holes were already a foot wide, if he could just
Steve glared at Tony’s back before dropping his face into his hands. “I hate it when he says it like that.”
As always, content warnings are at the end of the chapter and I must warn you... the content in this chapter and the next one get pretty heavy
But his mind flashed back to the night before when Peter scurried off like being touched by Steve burned his skin.
Sure, part of it was probably the Spidey metabolism. He ate more than the average teenager. He knew that.
As Steve struggled to grip his numb fingertips around the zipper of his suit, Tony began to put pieces together.
Steve clasped his own hands tight against his stomach as Tony talked Peter down. Steve was useless in these situations. Completely and totally useless.
In the end, Peter and Tony were instructed to stay back, no questions asked. Bruce said something about Peter needing the rest and Tony’s suit was damaged as it was.
Tony followed Steve’s finger and watched as a beautiful young woman ran across the roof of the school and leapt to the ground like the fall was nothing more than leaping off the bottom two steps. The fall should’ve broken her shins and knees on impact. Instead, she kept running, disappearing between two brick apartment buildings in a flash of pink.
Peter knew what that meant. The subway, the basement, the aquarium… all of those were places that sent Steve into a cold episode.
“Spangles is a boomer. I can barely get him to see his own, S.H.I.E.L.D. mandated therapist. No couple’s therapist.”
“Listen. You don’t need to talk. Or do anything really. But maybe a bath or a meal would make you feel better. A cup of coffee? A movie? A heavy petting session? I would be happy to pet heavily for the sake of your mental health.”
“Couldn’t sleep. Not after- you know.” Steve melted against Tony, his arms heavy across Tony’s shoulders. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
Peter blushed as Steve began to cackle. “Dad!” he squeaked, “it’s not my fault! Ned used all of mine and I couldn’t find an extra one so I borrowed yours. I was going to give it back next time I went to the store, I swear!”
Steve smiled again, and this time, it was radiant. Authentic. “I can see the headlines now. ‘Eccentric Billionaire Burns Down Manhattan Skyline With Burnt Coffee Beans.’ We would be even more famous.”
“I told you to cut that out. None of it, okay? This isn’t your fault, it’s that pre-pubescent asshole’s. I’m going to be right back.” Tony kissed the top of Steve’s head, smoothing his hair. “Hang tight.”
“I-I can’t do that.” Peter growled in frustration and pawed at his face. “You just won’t get it! Okay? You won’t- you can’t understand because you’re-”
Ned grinned. “Comic shop? Collin told me if I brought you in and you sign something, he’ll let us read all of the new Avengers comics, free of charge.”
He didn’t want to be with Steve right now. Not because he didn’t want to help or be there for him or any of that. Because he didn’t want to feel useless and Steve’s episodes had the surreal ability to make Tony feel totally useless within seconds.
Steve wanted to pull Peter into his arms. Wipe the tears off his son’s face with the pads of his fingers and kiss where his hair fell against his forehead. Hold him close until he remembered that he was anything but pathetic.
However, Tony had also bitten his tongue, but he could let Steve examine that later. In private. With a locked door.
He was laid out on the ground, cheek against something cold. His head was pounding and his fingers splayed over something hard and smooth. Hardwood.
Tony knew how Steve would feel about it, so he’d need to keep it on the DL, but he enlisted the help of Clint and Nat.
Tony was surprised by how terrible his son looked. He seemed sickly. But not just physically. There was something blank and desperate behind Peter’s eyes that made Tony’s blood run cold.
“Steve, before you say anything, I know I didn’t handle that situation in a great way but I’m trying to keep track of how much he’s eating so he doesn’t keel over. And it’s a lot more difficult to do that when he’s pouring things down the… what is it?”
We learned how to make sure he did that when he was a toddler! We’ll be contacted for celebrity guest staring on
And Peter liked making Pops happy, so he kept talking, even when Tony came in for another cup of coffee and shot him a ‘
If he looked at Steve, he would start melting down and he couldn’t afford to do that right now. He needed to keep his head clear and get Steve out.
“Peter, your dads are really good at what they do. Like, freakishly good. I mean, the Avengers are like in Honors for superheroes, you know? They’re the best of the best.” Ned was right. Peter knew he was right. “Besides. Whatever mission they’re on can’t be too big a deal because Happy isn’t staying here with us. Your dad always has him sleep on the couch when the mission is dangerous, right?”
Another scream pierced the air, and this time, Steve paused, tried to pinpoint which end of the hall it was echoing down from. His heart was thundering against his ribs and his fingertips had gone numb.
Once breakfast was on the table, Tony and Peter sat down across from each other and served themselves. Tony was famished. Peter… it was complicated.
Tony pulled away and marched up to the front doors of the school, yanking on the handles. “Steve it’s locked, how are we going to-”
Tony smirked and held up a sauce spoon, a dirty, dripping one Peter hadn’t noticed earlier. “I asked Pops here to taste the sauce and he opted to taste something a little bit more
The elevator doors opened before Tony could say something sappy back. Thank goodness. Tony was still dabbling in emotional vulnerability and he wasn’t sure what to say.
The words alone made Peter’s vision dance. The sight of the iconic silver foil in Tony’s hands made it worse.
There were two things in the room that didn’t belong there: a pile of manila folders and a Black man with an eyepatch, his feet kicked up onto another chair.
“It just feels too easy.” Tony released his faceplate so he could rub the bridge of his nose. “That’s all.”
They were sitting on the floor in what they could only assume was one of Nat’s secret apartments. The apartment was the usual NYC loft but felt even bigger since it was almost completely empty. There was a cot in the corner, a single set of utensils, a large mug, and a collection of items in the bathroom. That was it. Nothing else to prove someone lived there.
Tony was watching Nat win all of Clint’s meager savings when his phone lit up with the notification.
Tony and Steve adopted Peter when he was barely a toddler but the adoption agency had warned them that when Peter’s parents had died, Peter had been in the house. All these years, there was no evidence that Peter remembered anything (he had been asleep and only woken up when the police searched the house) but that didn’t mean bad memories couldn’t return.
“Sleep.” Tony said. “You need sleep. I need sleep. Peter needs sleep. All of us need to wake up in the morning with clear minds so we can have a serious conversation. This isn’t going to be something you can be foggy and exhausted for.”
“I love having a front seat to your marital spats,” Clint quipped as he riffled around in the kitchen cabinets. “Also, I found a can of soup. And it’s veggie soup. No one should live this way.”
Steve shook his head and ran a hand over his hair before crossing his arms. “He kept telling me he felt sick, so I let him go to bed. I wasn’t getting anywhere.”
But Tony kept his body flush to Steve’s, nodding and keeping Fury’s focus on him. The best way to get Steve back was to wait. There was nothing else they could do.
Once Peter was in the kitchen, going through the motions of making coffee with an altered single serve coffee maker that Tony had designed for some sort of Stark Industries kitchen tech launch next season, he glanced back at the table.
"Well, can you blame me?! You can't just ask a married man to have sex with him, and for him to be okay with it! I think the problem here Cap, is you make decisions so recklessly, that you don't know what consequences will come out of it! You also can't make up your fucking mind about what you want!" Tony protested before laughing with no joy, "I mean... look at you, The great Captain America. The people's choice for order and safety. Well, where the hell were you when they needed you! Wh-when I needed you!".
I guess Loki's comment earlier, had an influence on Tony Stark's alcoholic needs. But honestly, after literally almost being destroyed from throwing a missile into a intergalactic portal, falling to a very certain death, until being saved by Hulk-Buster. Alcohol wasn't the worse thing on his mind. But asking if the Shawarma Palace had alcohol was an understatement, considering the state it was in.
Sam felt a 'Shit!' leave his lips as the duo were caught. The hydra agents turned their attention to the two idiots, and sent their gun blasts toward them. They had surprisingly dodged most of them, but some were wildly close, in terms of impact.
Natasha huffs quietly. She swiftly looks around from the table, that she sat pleasantly at, and begins walking to her car.
The two Avengers walked back inside and sat at the bar area, as Tony looked to the menu. He lied, of course, about not eating. But still ordered a vanilla milkshake to at least fool the super soldier, who sat looking around to the other souls in the diner.
Steve replies with a soft no. He holds his face in his hands, utterly exhausted from the day's events. For the first time, Tony actually felt an inch of pity for someone other than himself. 'God, this is weird?' He thought. That little part of compassion he had for him kicked in.
Steve just chuckled at his comment. Even in their most vulnerable situation, he seems to find a way to throw some jokes out.
Of course, knowing them two, Tony's propelled hand would hit his drink, which in turn, spilled onto Steve's pants.
"You know, I never really learned how you got, that,  thing in your chest." Steve added. Instantly regretting at how he said it. 'That Thing,'.
Steve stayed there for a moment and took a few more long breaths. He needed that conversation. If not for himself but for Tony and their relationship.
Sitting on the kitchen counter, was a nice, big, pepperoni pie. A note sticking on the top, that read: Working Late, Save me a Piece, or no Ned for a week! Love you!
A bit of laughter followed, before Steve's watch broke the sounds of their forks scrapping the glass chinaware. Tony turned from the sink. "Is everything alright?" He asked cautiously.
He finally looked to the soldier, who was on the verge of having a nervous breakdown. Tony had to think quickly. He didn't want to leave Steve in this confused, self-destructive state for too long. Thankfully, Tony's mind works quicker than he thought.
Now shifting gears, the story will jump ahead a month or two before the Hydra raid in the beginning of Age Of Ultron. Let’s see what history has done to our Avengers.
The slower Steve went, the more Tony felt himself getting dazed and just losing any reality, than what was happening at that moment. For whatever reason, Steve was intentionally dragging this out. Even so much, that it almost became difficult for Tony to literally even breathe at times.
As the Avengers lie fractionated across the globe/universe. Wanda and Vision, that had joined the original six, before the accords, would become the glue to bring them back together. With the two of them seeming to be hitting it off.
Steve was a wreck once more. But he once again, wiped his tears. He looked back to the machine and gave a relieving sigh. He had it now.
Tony’s contagious laugh followed, and it was honestly admirable to Steve. Who knew two years could really make a person appreciate the little things of their companions.
The gang entered quietly, only to find one employee working. A few customers were sitting a table, near the street window. They group took this as a possible clue. Witnesses are usually the best and worst, when looking for missing persons. And Natasha hoped that this was one of those winning moments.
The difference didn’t matter because Bucky’s mind immediately kicked into overdrive. He was no longer in the hall. First, he was in a damp and dark cell, the smell of mildew taking over everything. In an instant, the scene changed and now he was tied down on an ice-cold metal slab, shivering, but then warm blood sprayed all over him. Then things changed yet again and his eyes were blinded by old fluorescent lights and a chemical smell made him nearly gag. Over and over these scenes played in his head, he was back there.
Tony laid completely to the right of the bed, his back nearly lining up with the wall, Steve on the left end. Both of them faced Bucky as he tried to get comfortable in the middle.
“I have heard reports of more than enough PDA occurring while out on assignment, but that is not what I brought you two in to discuss.” Fury said with a cautious stare. “As you both may know, Romanoff and Barton were sent out by themselves for a mission this week, it was a situation where a group of 4 would raise suspicions.”
“With these,” Bucky said, pulling out three small cylinders from a pocket in his bag. He handed one to each of the confused men. “Open it up.”
“Are you back with us hon?” Steve said with a soft, comforting voice that only came out when bringing Tony out of his episodes.
Before they left, Bucky took a bigger cylinder out of his bag and placed a giant version of the cloth on his metal arm, immediately making it look like a normal flesh and blood arm.
Almost completely in sync, Tony and Steve looked towards Agent Barnes, then at each other and back again. The same thought going through both of their heads: “Oh no, he’s hot.”
Another nod and the guard moved to be in front of Tony, who was hoping that the guard could not hear Tony’s heart nearly beating out of his chest.
At this point, Tony was sitting up in bed and crawling over to join Steve in assuring their boyfriend that he was safe and not wherever his brain was trying to trick him into thinking.
While he was starting to warm up some of the leftover soup, Bucky heard some small footsteps and turned to see Tony standing there, short hair somehow sticking up in every direction possible and rubbing his tired eyes.
Tony held the napkin up to the light. He frowned and put it back down on the mattress. His back hurt from hunching over, but he didn't care. Pain let him know he was still alive. Whether that was a good or bad thing, he hadn't quite decided. Today must have been some kind of holiday because this was his second day in a row that he had gone torture free. He assumed it was Thanksgiving. If he had been keeping track right. He picked his pencil up and kept working on the sketch.
"Harry, don't do this!" Ned was frozen in place, scared that Peter would be shot if he took one step closer.
By nightfall, the Avengers were once again assembled on the Hellicarrier. They had formed a protective barrier around their bot, not letting anyone so much as look at him. Fury had made it clear that no one would harm Iron Man, but the Avengers still felt the need to protect him.
The sun began to set before anyone was allowed to see Peter. A soft orange glow illuminated the room. Various Avengers came and went, checking on the situation and then leaving to get dinner. Tony was now alone in the waiting room, staring at the clock on the opposite wall. Five hours, ten minutes, and forty-seven seconds. That's exactly how long Tony had been waiting. He continued to count the seconds, finding it oddly calming. Footsteps approached him. Thinking it was a doctor with news, he grabbed the armrests of the chair, ready to jump up.
"I believe there is a reason the spider follows Peter. It understands Peter saved it." The AI explained.
"It's alright," Pepper was more concerned with not dying than the priceless couch that was still on fire.
"Nope. I really have to get going," Spider-man shot a web at the ceiling and yanked himself off the couch. He did a flip mid-air and landed in a crouch on the other side of the room. Steve opened his mouth to say something, but the Masked Avenger was already running out the door.
"I've had enough of evil robots," Steve charged into the room, throwing his shield at the other bot's head. It knocked the other bot off balance and gave Iron Man the opportunity he needed to rip the reactor right out of his enemies chest. The bot's eyes flickered as it stumbled backward. It whirred like a dying engine before ultimately collapsing.
"He's home," Bucky assured him, putting a hand on Steve's knee. The Avengers hadn't been the same without their robot. Missions were difficult. Sure, the Avengers always got the job done. That wasn't the problem. The problem was the painful hole that had formed in the very heart of their dynamic.
"I find that really hard to believe. Considering I just found you sneaking around like a rat," Bucky shot back.
Tony dodged the question, "we need to get back to the lab. Quickly. Before it starts messing with your head."
"Boss, I'm picking up a human heat signature from the building across the street. As well as an unusually high level of gamma radiation," FRIDAY reported.
"There's no pregnant wife and kids in there, right?" Tony teased, remembering the last time they used a safe house. They didn't want to risk putting Clint's family in danger, so they didn't go back to the farm house.
"Really think I wouldn't have a failsafe in case someone tried that again, motherfucker?" Tony muttered as he took cover behind a car. He put two fingers to the comm in his ear. "Iron Man has been compromised. I still have one gauntlet. But otherwise, you're on your own." Tony typed a command into his watch and yanked it towards his fingers. The watched folded out, forming a metal glove around his hand.
"I thought you liked talking. Though it has been awhile since we've last seen each other. A lot's changed. You've changed."
Kraven chuckled as he stood up and checked the chains holding Spider-man in place. "You'll learn to appreciate art."
A figure made their way across the room and yanked Peter's mask off. Peter sighed in relief when he recognized the person standing over him. "Oh thank Odin...I was afraid you guys wouldn't find me...can you get me out of these things?" Peter did his best to motion to the straps.
Strong arms slipped around his torso and yanked him upwards. Tony couched violently when he broke the surface.
"Look at me, Pepper!" Tony jumped to his feet, arms outstretched. "Half of my body is a machine! One of my eyes sees the world in shades of blue code! I am most definitely a robot!" He ripped the facial prosthetic off and flung it across the room. Pepper flinched at the sight of his actual face and tried to look away, but Tony yelled, "LOOK AT ME, PEPPER." Pepper forced herself to do as he said. Part of his jaw, his entire cheek, and eye socket was replaced with metal plates. Bits of rubber and wire snaked their way between the plates. Angry scar tissue covered the area where flesh met metal. Tony still managed to keep his facial hair in check, despite everything. Pepper tried to focus on that instead of the machinery.
"Fuck off, Barnes!" Tony threw a pillow at him. He noticed the milk on the nightstand and gulped down every last drop. The cold liquid feeling good against his abused throat. Tony asked for more, but Bucky brought him water instead, figuring that it was probably better for him.
"Voice command unauthorized." The armor stopped twitching. It turned and walked off somewhere. Peter groaned. He was too tired to deal with a buggy suit. The armor couldn't use its weapons without Tony's verbal permission, so the suit should be fine wandering around the woods until morning. Peter turned his attention back to the stars.
There was another long silence, in which Peter scooted closer to his father, and Tony wrapped an arm around him. Tony planted a kiss on top of Peter's head. Peter muttered something that sounded like "gross", and Tony laughed. They both had a lot of healing to do after everything that had happened. But Tony knew that in the end, everything would be alright. Peter wouldn't have to keep looking over his shoulder anymore, and Tony could sleep soundly without waiting for the panic alarm to blare at any moment. Of course, there was no guarantee that Spider-man wouldn't face worse enemies in the future. No guarantee that Peter would be able to keep close to the ground, watching out for the little guy. Because he was only twenty, and still had a lot of superhero-ing to do. And he was still an Avenger. And one day he would have to face horrible monsters once again. But for now, Peter was safe. And he could go back to being the friendly neighborhood Spider-man, whose greatest enemy was an elderly man in a bird costume. And Peter Parker, whose biggest concern was getting his homework done on time.
Steve didn't come into contact with Tony for a solid week. He wanted to make sure Tony to knew that he was loved and that they had been looking for him. And It was very hard to do that after the cyborg put his workshop on lockdown. Not even Rhodey or Bucky were allowed inside. Steve wasn't the brightest person when it came to relationships, but if there was ever a way to clearly state that you needed space, then that was it. So he didn't try to get into Tony's workshop. Didn't even try knocking on the door. Tony would open up when he was ready. He told the others to do the same. Despite their protests, the others listened to him.
Iron Man closed his fist around the vial. "Show me the boy. Or you can say goodbye to this." Iron Man held up the vial once more, rolling the glass tube between his fingers.
"You're...you're Tony Stark..." Steve breathed out when he got a good look at the shorter man's face. Or what was left of it, anyway.
"Absolutely not," Tony snapped, not looking up from the gauntlet he was working on. He was out of his suit, wearing nothing but a tank top and jeans.
The flight back to the compound was painfully silent and full of tension. Tony was eyeing each of his teammates as if any one of them was about to stab him in the back.
"You want to know who I am?!" Tony pushed Bucky off him. "Fine!" He dropped the shield and held out his arms. Bits of metal suddenly flew down the stairwell. They latched onto Tony's body and spread out, encasing him in the familiar red and gold armor. Steve took a step back, not believing what was happening right in front of him. Tony twisted around and grabbed the faceplate in midair. Calmly, he clicked it into place. Everyone was speechless as he turned to face them, head held high and shoulders squared. The rectangular eyepieces blazed with blue light. "I am Iron Man."
"Stark killed my family," Wanda spat, not taking her eyes off the battle below. Spider-man had just entered the fight. The extra limbs on the back of his suit helped him to maneuver around the Hulk as he shot webbing. "Why should Stark get to have a family?" She flicked her hands again, shooting a ball of red energy right at Spider-man. It struck him in the head causing him to freeze. The Hulk raised his fists, about to bring them down on the lanky teen.
Tony opened his mouth to answer but didn't know what to say. "Um...listen, Peter is in the hospital."
Natasha gave Steve's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "It'll be alright. We'll put him back together. Just like always."
Peter's hands shook. Everyone knew he had too big a heart to pull the trigger. Natasha slowly approached him. Peter jerked the gun in her direction, eyepieces going wide. "Guns really aren't your thing, little spider." She put her hand over his and forced him to lower the gun. "Why don't you tell us why you're here?"
Steve and Tony definitely watched Wall-E together. Don't lie to me and say they didn't. They probably watched Disney movies together too. I can picture Steve liking Tangled.
Peter pulled one earbud out of his ear when he felt the presence of a person sitting next to him. "Hey, uncle Happy."
Peter finally pulled his eyes away from his pet. "Yeah...yeah...I don't really...remember..." His voice was weak and scratchy.
"Hell if I know." Tony shook himself. He peeled his jack off and tossed it aside. He looked down his shirt, checking the reactor. A second crack had formed from his little tumble in the river. Great.
"You got it off yourself," Tony corrected. "We got it back into a bottle before it could latch onto someone else. It's locked up in the lab right now."
"Not anymore. His cybernetic enhancements mean that he can fully pilot the suit without my help," the AI explained. "I used to be connected to it as a precaution. I was disconnected before he left for his mission."
“Wait, what are you doing?!” Jarvis' panic rose, “stop that! Stand down!” He couldn’t feel pain. But he knew his code was being torn apart. Destroyed right before his metaphorical eyes by his fellow AI. “STOP! I’M ALERTING MR. STAR-“ Jarvis didn’t get the chance to finish his sentence. Or send out the distress call.
"Thanks, J." Steve turned on heel and almost ran into Pepper Pots, who was standing right behind him with her hands on her hips.
"It is," Iron Man handed it over. "Go test it out and get back to me." He turned his attention back to the magnets. "Okay. These should be good. I already put some on your shield. Go nuts," he patted Steve on the shoulder.
The café and where she stood now, clearly showed the difference in atmosphere, and yes, cleanliness.
"No, no, no, not at all. I just have something to say to you is all." Tony blurted out. Regretting it immediately afterward.
Another curse word fell from Sam’s lips, with Steve following with one of his own. The two just looked around and tried to find any signs of a vehicle nearby. Nope. I guess their luck ran all out.
Tony extended his hand for a greeting handshake, then fashionably introduced Steve. The super-soldier feeling a little joyous at hearing Tony speak so fondly of him.
Steve now was near the end of the driveway. He seemingly looked around and could see Tony in the window. The burly man sent a kiss his way. The other caught it and smiled softly.
“This is about Tony, isn’t it?” Sam addressed. To which, Steve just sat shell-shocked. Was he that oblivious to his current misgivings?
He walked over to the brunette and placed a kiss on his forehead. Tony was about to go on, but Steve placed a finger on his lips.
Sure, he could text the others of his new home. But like the many times before, he knew that his friends wouldn't even have time to come and see it. Especially with everything going on in their lives, at the moment. Regardless, he still sent them a text about it, just in case one day they were able to stop by.
Not a simple peck on the cheek, no he made sure his mark was on Steve's lips. Steve was just left highly confused. But it wasn’t about the kiss itself. No they’ve already had their first kiss, through their ‘situations’. No what dumbfounded Steve was the fact that Tony was kissing him in public.
He kind of wishes he could take a match and just burn the room to the ground. But that’s a bullshit statement to the press, paperwork galore, and an angry Rhodey lecture of epic proportions, that Tony didn’t want to deal with.
"It better taste good. Meat like this, doesn't always come cheap." She joked, yet with a hint of seriousness.
Tony once again, smiles in embarrassment. Yet still tries to calm Steve down, with some soothing hand movements down his back.
Yet, most recently, he'd never admit it. Nor did he tell anyone. Not even the person. His most deepest, hated, yet cherished secret. His truest source of 'home' was... somebody. Somebody that was no longer here.
Finally, the spark came again, and the vehicle revved up. Which was sweet music to the super-soldier ears.
Then came the cavalry, with the sound of Sam, and Natasha, awaking and scurrying their feet toward him. But as they reached the opened door, they could see the super-soldier resting quietly.
Steve and Sam knew that making themselves sick for food that was found in garbages, so that they wouldn't be spotted, and for Nat to be the only one heading out for actual food, was enough for them. And plus, their stealth-like skills are not as advanced as Natasha's.
My current plan is to have the next chapter up by the end of February. There are about six chapters left in this story, and I will do my best to get them to you in a timely manner, dear readers.
"Well?" Osborn sat back in his chair. Wanda and Bruce sat in the plush chairs opposite his desk. Bruce was turning the vial containing Venom over in his hands, examining it closely. The office was deathly silent, other than the loud ticking of a wall clock.
"I think we should keep moving." Steve nudged Natasha forward. He could hear the beating of wings. Very large wings. They needed to go. Right now.
"TONY!!" Steve jumped into the small crater that had been carved out under the weight of the armor. he practically fell on top of his boyfriend, shaky hands running over his breast plate and helmet. He found the latch under Tony's jaw and popped the face plate open. "TONY!!"
"I still think it's a huge risk," Bruce waved his hand, dismissing the schematics from the glass screen, and giving him a clear view of the robot that stood on the other side.
Tony smiled softly at them before going back inside to help the SHIELD agents sort out the current mess.
"What the FUCK," Spider-man gasped, pointing at the window. On the other side of the glass stood a man, his identity masked by the dim light of the outdoors. He hovered just above the ground, supported by two of the four long metal tentacles attached to his sides.
The rest of the team always had questions for Iron Man. Sometimes invasive ones. Clint once asked him if he had to plug himself into the wall at night. Iron Man had slapped him upside the head for that.
"I would like to dance as well! Come, Banner! Let us dance!" Thor took Bruce's hand before the smaller man could protest.
"Unfortunately my scientists were unable to recreate the masterpiece you and Mr. Parker once made. I had Parker's kid give it his best go. In all fairness, the kid didn't know what he was making, so that may have been why he was unsuccessful. That and he backed out of the project the moment his blood was needed," Osborn spoke slowly. "Such a pity. We were so close."
"Okay, okay. Fine. Just don't let it roam the tower. Someone could step on it," Tony threw his hands in the air.
"You need me," Venom's tendrils slithered over Peter's neck. "We need each other to live. Let me in, little ssssspider."
It was still early in the morning, and the Avengers were slowly waking up and making their way to the kitchen. Iron Man had chosen to remain in the Quinjet for the night, and Steve was a little curious when everyone but him was accounted for. Steve held his coffee close to his chest as he stepped out onto the porch, the screen door banging shut behind him. Surprisingly, he didn't have to go too much further to find the robot.
"Organic webbing," the Avenger repeated themselves. "It took a bit of prodding to alter your spider genetics. And also a bit of cutting up the muscles in your arm to make room. Your new organs are still developing. Still, you should be back to web slinging in no time."
"We don't have a choice. We're about to fight a dragon. None of us can afford to sit this one out. I'm going ahead. Find some weapons, horses, whatever you need and follow me." Tony lightly kicked the horse, galloping out of the village without another word.
"Peter could be in even more danger than he already is. I know. Natasha deleted the file from Tony's archives. No one will ever know about this." Steve assured him.
"You just came here to visit, right? Not to warn us of any deadly threat coming our way?" Steve said.
The robot looked down at the man in his arms, "I got you, Cap. Hang on!" Steve barely had time to secure a hold on Iron Man before they blasted back up. Iron Man swerved through the falling debris. The entire tower was coming down at this point. Iron Man made an abrupt turn, shooting out the side of the falling structure and into the crisp night air. Once they were a safe distance away, Iron Man turned back to face the tower. He hovered in mid-air, holding Steve tightly in his arms as they watched their home crumble. The Quinjet flew off the landing pad just in time.
"He's right, though. How do we know that we can trust one another?" Natasha hugged her knees. "Two Avengers went rogue, I wouldn't be surprised if someone else-"
"Let's keep the chatter to a minimum tonight. This is serious, Barton," Banner reminded him. He was waiting in the Quinjet, praying that this wouldn't turn into a code green situation.
"Fuck." Bucky looked back at the hologram on the table. It was frozen at the beginning. Tony was standing in a shy position, with his head bowed, and hands clasped behind his back. But Bucky knew him well enough to tell that he wasn't being shy. He was sad. He had given up, accepting the fact that this would be his last mission. And that he wouldn't have his family at his side during his last moments on earth. The longer Bucky stared at Tony's face, the worse he felt. He loved Tony, he truly did. But an entire city of people needed their help right now.
Steve hadn’t left his side since dinner last night. Because in all honesty, the soldier was afraid Tony might try to turn himself into a robot again if he was left alone. Or that he might try to hurt himself in some other way. He hadn’t told the team what had happened last night. It was up to Tony if he ever wanted to share that. As far as the team was concerned, they just thought Tony and Steve were making up for lost time by becoming inseparable. Steve had even spent the night in Tony’s bed. They didn’t do any actual touching, other than Tony putting his hand on top of Steve’s. Steve stayed awake all night, afraid that Tony might slip away if he closed his eyes. Tony had berated him in the morning, shouting about how he wasn’t made of glass, which led to him yelling at Steve about how he had failed the cyborg, and how betrayed he felt when no one saved him from AIM. Steve just sat back and let him express himself. Yelling about your feelings was healthier than avoiding them by turning yourself into a robot, after all. When Tony ran out of things to say, both men broke down, holding one another in their arms for a long time. When they had pulled away, Steve's shoulder was damp from the other's tears. Steve hated seeing Tony cry. And he still regretted breaking up with him. Regretted the way he had left the man to cry on the floor after doing so. God, Steve felt awful about that. He felt awful about everything.
"Please," Steve jiggled the handle. "What's wrong? You can talk to me, buddy." There was a long pause, although the door did eventually slid open. The workshop was a bit of a mess, which wasn't too surprising. What was surprising was Iron Man sitting against the far wall with one of his arms lying in pieces around him. Iron Man looked up at Steve. Then hung his head in shame. Steve gripped the doorframe so hard his knuckles turned white. "Did you hurt yourself again?"
"Banner, you so much as look at Peter wrong and I will slit your throat," Natasha hissed as they walked past.
Steve's heart ached at the sound. "Wake up, buddy. C'mon, it's just a bad dream. Wake up!" He shook his teammate more aggressively. Tony bolted into a sitting position, eyes wide and breathing heavily. He looked around the room frantically, not knowing where he was.
"Bastards," Robert took a long sip of his coffee. "I saw the whole thing go down on the news. The arrests and the press conferences. It was all a big mess. Everyone thought the Avengers was done for. Then you straight up disappeared for a few months. We all knew you were the one who got...hurt. By them. But no one wanted to admit it. No one wanted to admit that two of the Avengers had abused a kid."
"There is another. There is another. There is another." FRIDAY repeated over and over, her voice crackling. The armor twitched its head, its eyes flickering. "Unauthorized. Unauthorized."
"Thanks..." Steve slowly lowered the cup from his lips, having almost drunk some. "How's life in the garage?" He leaned against the wall, watching Iron Man dig through a box of tools.
"I'm sorry. About yesterday," Iron Man said from somewhere behind Steve, making the super soldier jump. He hit his head on the kitchen cabinet with a loud thud. "Ouch. Sorry for that too."
"Yes, please," Steve gladly accepted the warm drink. They had arrived at Clint's farm around two in the morning. Clint's wife was a little upset that he hadn't called beforehand, but she was glad they were all alive, so she didn't give him too much trouble about it.
"Guards, please take Iron Man to the Hulk room. We will hold him there until the council decides whether or not to terminate him," Fury instructed, standing back so that the guards could get by.
"After he took out Anthony's heart," Steve's voice was barely audible. "He had us both paralyzed. There was nothing I could do." The super soldier hung his head in shame.
Clint grabbed the headset, "Iron Man, you're part of this team-no. Scratch that. You are part of this family. This very fucked up family that loves you very much. We know you're not a murderer. We're going to get you out of here, buddy."
"Something stupid," Iron Man leaned forward and pressed the mouth slit of his faceplate against Steve's lips. A kiss. But it only lasted a brief second before Iron Man pulled away. "Wish me luck!" With that, he blasted off into the sky, leaving Steve with his mouth hanging open.
"And you still will. But first, they need to be weakened. Their bond is too strong for you to attack them as they are now. You and I both know that."
"Stop it, Tony." Rhodey snapped. Iron Man made a growling noise at the sound of his own name. Rhodey chose to ignore that, "yes, the mission was a success. But you didn't know what you were flying into. Things could have been a lot worse. You could've gotten seriously hurt."
Steve let out a scream as he plummeted down several stories. He flailed his arms, desperately trying to grab onto something. His screams were abruptly cut off when he crashed into something very solid. "Iron Man?!"
"You seriously think I'm the one who hurt your son? That's a pretty serious accusation to make, Stark." Banned slowly got to his feet, using the table to support himself. Blood dripped from his now broken nose.
"That scrawny kid is nothing like the man I fought a few weeks ago. The person I fought wasn't afraid to die. He gave his all in that battle. This kid? He's scared of his own shadow." Otto practically spat the last word.
"Nevermind, I killed him, so cross him off the list." Iron Man waved his hand dismissively. "So, Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, Jarvis, of course, but that doesn't really count. Um, I guess that's it?"
"I do not!" Tony let go of the mask so he could shove Peter back into the bathroom. "Put on some regular clothes!" He slammed the door shut and leaned against it, not letting Peter leave.
The room was filled with heavily armed men and women. All clad in black. They appeared to be having some sort of meeting. All were gathered around the center of the room, their attention completely focused on whoever was standing in the center of the circle.
"We all were," Sam pointed out. "You've been off the radar for two months, kid. It's a little concerning that you would go MIA right when someone got their hands on a fancy new weapon."
Spider-man let himself fall to his knees, too exhausted to question how Steve knew his name. He rubbed his aching throat with his free hand. Iron Man knelt next to him, putting a hand over the spider on Peter's back. "Let's get you back inside."
A few moments later the entire team, except for Bruce, was in the underground room. "I don't see anything that suggests Spidey was hurt," Natasha reported. She knelt down next to a man that was webbed to the floor. The man stared up at her with fear in his eyes.
"Oh, Steve!" Iron Man's hand shot into the air, almost smacking Steve in the face. "I thought of a name!"
"That's an understatement!" Hawk-Eye dropped down from the ceiling, followed close behind by the Black Widow. The two engaged Wanda, knowing they were no match for the Hulk.
"You are a...tragedy," Bucky muttered. Of course, Tony couldn't hear him over the loud music blasting throughout the workshop. Bucky was glad that Tony was feeling like his old self enough to listen to his music again, but right now he really needed to talk to the cyborg. "An absolute tragedy! Do you hear me, Stark?!" He shouted. "Jarvis, cut the music!"
"Shut up," Tony hissed. His legs hadn't hurt as much since he had been injected with Extremis. Which was one good thing that had come from his time at AIM. After nearly eight years, he had forgotten what it felt like to be able to just
