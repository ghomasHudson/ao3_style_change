Steve quickly stood up from the bed where they were both sitting which caused Tony to face plant right into his pillow. "You're drunk," Steve repeated.
Happy was always that cool uncle type person. He had always been Tony's friend, well, that kinda happens when someone almost raises you. Happy was both the Stark's bodyguard along with being Tony's nanny when he was younger up until he was third-teen.
Steve stood up from the bench that he was sitting in, flung his book bag over his shoulder and started walked back to his dorm room.
"So, studying," Tony said to try and break the subject apart. He took his math textbook out of his backpack and set it down in front of him with the homework assignments out. "I should probably-" He paused when he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. When he took it out he saw that it was a text from Nat; he looked up at her to ask what was going on but she just shook her head before he could say anything.
"I was starting to get worried that you weren't going to show up, Tony," Happy said as he put his phone in the cup holder in the center console of the front seat.
"C'mon, this way." Nat led them to the small student lounge that was across the hall from their classroom. It was currently empty, so it would be the perfect place for them to sit and talk about Tony.  They sat on one of the couches in the lounge, setting their backpacks down on the floor next to it. "So, what's wrong with Tony?" Nat asked as she wrapped her arms around her legs that where kicked up next to her on the couch.
"Awhile back he was suppose to tell me who his crush was but didn't ever tell me, and when I tried bringing it up again he avoids the conversation. I dunno, man, but maybe that's his issue." Nat looked back up at Steve from her pants when she was pulling out loose pieces of thread. Steve was staring off into space, his face was starting to turn a pink-ish color. "What's wrong? Why are people keeping things from me in this group? I'm suppose to be the one who helps-"
Tony shrugged. "Would've been here sooner if my social butterfly of a robot didn't stop to make new friends," Tony answered playfully.
Tony looked back at Nat with a small smile on his face. "Thanks, Nat. I'll do that when he gets home."
On the other side of the door, Tony had his back to the door and slowly slide down until he was sitting on the floor. With the pain in his hand and the weird anxiety feeling he had going on in his chest he didn't know what was going on. Maybe it got infected and I'm dying, Tony thought holding up his bandaged hand and looking at it. No, that's stupid, can you get anymore ridiculous, Anthony? He thought again.
"Let me out!" JARVIS called from the backpack that was slung over Tony's right shoulder. "I command you!"
Happy patted Tony's shoulder with a bigger smile on his face. "I'm happy for you, Tony. Congrats! Are we keeping this on the down low from your parents?"
"Not at all." Steve went back to reading-or pretending to read- through his text book. "You said some stupid things then passed out."'
"Tony? What's wrong with Tony?" Steve asked in almost a panic, his eyes wide, but shut up when Nat hushed him. He didn't realize how loud he was actually speaking until he noticed that other people who were walking down the hallway gave him a puzzled look.
"Like... a date?" She asked with a smirk on her face. "Because I can plan everything out!" Nat busted out in laughter with Steve rolled his eyes and started walking away to get to class.
During the afternoon break that the entire school had, Steve was sitting on the bench just outside the cafe/lunch room where Tony had told him they would meet up at. It's been about fifth teen minutes and Steve was starting to get anxious. He was wondering if maybe Tony had just set him up to go there and not actually show up, because, to be honest, Steve could actually see Tony doing that. But why would he do that? Maybe because he was the new kid? More than likely.
"Roommate?" JARVIS' voice picked up, turning to look at Tony. He started to run himself into the door to tell Tony to let him out. Sometimes JARVIS acted like a small puppy rather than a robot.
"It's a hangover, what do you think?" He snapped but not meaning too. "Have you even had a hangover before? I can't see you being the type of person to drink- well, maybe, but probably just one or two beers so you're tipsy-"
The group of six walked through the cafe, a lot of people were trying to get Tony to stop so they could talk but he walked passed them without saying anything to them. Steve didn't realize how popular his roommate was. He was also hoping that Tony was going to introduce him to his friends since it was an awkward trip with nobody talking. At first, Steve didn't realize this, but the red headed woman and one of the guys were holding hands. Obviously they were a couple.
When they walked into the room, the teacher who was sitting behind his front desk, Mr. Richardson had looked up to see Tony walking in on time. That was a sight for sore eyes.
"I have my ways, so don't you worry about it." He took a sip of it before taking out his iPhone. "Before I forget, give me your number, Rogers."
Tony snorted awake and sat up with a piece of paper stuck to his forehead. "Wh-what? What's going on?" He grumbled after the piece of paper that had his notes written down on fell into his lap. He looked at his watch and was surprised at the time. "Why did you wake me up so early?"
"Yeah, but I know what I'm doing." Tony tried leaning in again to kiss him, the stench of alcohol was strong on his breath.
"Definitely nervous!" JARVIS added in. Tony 'accidentally' dropped his backpack on the front stairs as he started walking up them. "Ow!"
"That would be totally sweet!" Clint said with a smile on his face. "Somewhat same thing, gonna teach archery, but didn't know you had to take some courses in college to actually do that." Clint shrugged. "So here I am."
"Dude, even Thor knew, pretty sure it was that obvious," Clint pointed out as he sat down on the beat up recliner chair, picking up the Xbox One controller on the coffee table.
Howard let out a sigh before turning to face his guest who was now standing next to him. "Anthony, this is Obadiah Stane."
"From what?" Tony knew that it probably wasn't a good thing to ask at this moment, but he couldn't help it. His curiosity was getting the best of him.
Steve walked into Mr. Richardson's physics class on time as usual even after organizing Tony's CD rack, which was a surprise since it was such a disaster. Mr. Richardson was surprised to see only Steve walk into his class without Tony. Since he knew that they were dating he found it strange that Tony wasn't with him as they never seemed to leave each others side.
Tony rolled his eyes, sitting back in his seat. "It would be great if I could finish my own sentences, JARVIS. I'm just saying."
"Take as much time as you need, Tony." Stane took a business card out from his pocket and held it out to him. "Just keep me posted on how things are going with it."
"I don't like touching people I don't know," Tony said as he stood up. "Okay, look. Your room is right there." He pointed at the closed door that was across the room. "Mine is right here." He jabbed a thumb behind his shoulder to the opened door room that looked extremely messy. "Don't touch anything in my room, because I don't need you going to the hospital because I wasn't here to supervise you."
The best thing that Steve could think of doing right now was to clean up their dorm a little bit. It was honestly driving Steve crazy that Tony never put things away when he was done with them. Mostly speaking about Tony's CD collection. He had a huge CD rack in the living room that was overflowing with cases since they weren't place back properly; discs not put back into their cases, and they look like they've been thrown back onto the rack. It would be a miracle if the discs still worked after all the abuse that Tony had put them through.
"Well, well, well," Mr. Richardson started to say, sitting back in his old, beat up office chair. "Isn't this a surprise to see you here on time, Mr. Stark. I think that's the first time in... Well, ever."
"My name's Anthony Stark, but everyone calls me Tony." He ignored Steve's question, reaching down to the cooler next to the couch and took out a beer. "Want one?" He held out another can of beer.
"Uh, no. It's almost eight," Steve said as he set his book bag down on the floor next to the fridge.
"I... I think you're a nerd," Tony blurted out. Clearly that's not what he wanted to say but that was the first thing that came to mind. "No, that's not it."  Steve chuckled. "Not funny, dude!"
Clint laughed at Tony's response since he could clearly tell that he was lying. "What's their name, Tony?" He asked with a smirk on his face.
From the floor, JARVIS started throwing flower pieces over them. "Congratulations!" He said happily. It must have been extremely clear that they wanted each other if even JARVIS could see it.
He swung his feet over the bed to start getting ready, but he thought maybe it would be a good idea to see if Tony was awake yet or not. When walking out of his room, he peered into Tony's room, he didn't want to walk into his room without permission. There he saw Tony sprawled out on the messy floor with the TV lighting up the room with early morning infomercials and a screwdriver laying across his chest. He must have passed out while working last night.
"Tony? You alright?" He said as he slowly opened the door. He honestly wasn't surprised to see his friend sitting in the middle of his bedroom with his back to the door since that's normally how he was. This time though, Tony wasn't working on anything, there were about four beer bottles laying around him on the floor. "Tony?" Steve said again, trying to get Tony's attention.
"That was my dad," Steve said before Tony moved the hologram all around again. "He... He died not too long ago."
"Good, I'll send a driver out to pick you up tomorrow morning." After that, Howard had hung up without a goodbye or anything. Typical.
She groaned loudly in frustration. "Why! I mean, you are his roommate, you're not going to be able to avoid these feelings forever."
"Well, if you would've let him finish, his name is JARVIS. He's my robot. I made him when I was five years old. Actually, I think he was the first thing I ever made. I wanted to name him Optimus Prime, but he insisted that he wanted to be called JARVIS so yeah. That's him."
The college campus was quite a way from home, so Steve had to take up on the option of using the colleges' dorms. Not that Steve minded that he had to live in the dorms, it was just going to be a big change from living at home. It broke his heart to see that his mother was crying before he left, but she had reassured him over and over that they were tears of happiness. The way Steve looked at this, he wanted to make his mother proud of him and doing this was going to do just that.
There was something different in Tony's eyes that Steve haven't noticed before, it looked like happiness that he never had before. It certainly wasn't there when Steve first moved in, but the point was that it was there now and it was a good feeling.
Turning around again, JARVIS saw Howard Stark and all that excitement seemed to disappear. Every time he saw Howard he couldn't help but become worried that he would try selling him again, it was a nightmare to think that he could've been scrap metal if Tony didn't catch what what happening. JARVIS tried climbing back into Tony's backpack, but he couldn't quite make it. Instead, Tony picked him up and held onto him to make him feel safe from harm.
Before Tony went inside his house, he put JARVIS in his backpack which turned out to not be a good idea. The entire time he was trying to fit JARVIS inside the backpack, the small robot was trying to wiggle his way out so he could see the world around him. In all honesty, Tony didn't want JARVIS out of his sight, which was the exact reason why he had stuffed him into his backpack; he didn't want to but he didn't want to risk his father trying to sell JARVIS off without him knowing. So this was for the best.
"The money I made for one of you spilling you had feelings for one another,I made forty bucks today," Nat said as she put the money in her pocket. "The point is, I'm happy that you guys are together. We were all waiting for this to happen."
By the end of the school day Steve was exhausted. When he got back into his and Tony's dorm room, he threw his book bag down next to the refrigerator letting out an exhausted sigh. He was finally happy to be done with the school day, he just wanted to kick back and relax. Steve plopped down on the old, beat up couch and closed his eyes to relax, but it wasn't long until he heard a lot banging sound coming from Tony's room followed by him yelling "dammit!" It caused Steve to shoot straight up on the couch, his eyes wide opened from surprise.
Tony groaned as he forced himself to stand up, his whole body ached from laying on that uncomfortable floor, but it was something that he was used to. "Yeah, I'm never there on time," he said with a smirk as he was rubbing his right eye. "I normally drift in at around 9:30 or 10:00."
"I'm not..." Steve stopped in mid sentence. He remembered what Bruce had told him in Physics earlier, so he decided to keep his mouth shut about it. "I'm Steve," he told them.
When they walked up the stairs to the third floor, Nat took out her key chain then unlocked her room. She lived in her room alone so everything was always really cleaned and organized, totally the opposite of Tony.
"Something, as in that he has a major crush on you." She looked back up Tony to see how he was reacting to this.
Before Tony could reply with a comeback to that, Stane just shook his head. "Ah, he's fine, Howard. Don't worry about it." He turned back to face Tony. "May I see him?"
"Did you burn your face as well?" Thor pointed out when he saw that Tony's face was still red from just Steve brushing his hand.
When I write the Group Chat chapters, I will let you know who's phone we are looking at at the time. In this chapter, it is Tony's phone. P.S. since they're texting, most grammar/punctuation won't be used.
"C'mon, dude," Tony scoffed with a small shake of his head. "It's an iPhone, probably the easiest smartphone that anyone could own. You should be happy I bought you one, I could've bought you nothing." Tony paused for a moment. "Well, then again, I did destroy your old one by dunking it in water. Y'know what, forget what I said."
Did he really just call me by my last name? Steve thought to himself as Tony walked past him to get to the kitchen. From the fridge he grabbed a Monster Energy Drink, popped the cap off and started to down it in almost one sitting. Steve couldn't believe he almost drank that in one go, he would imagine that drinking it all at once would give a person a heart attack.
"You make it sound like college is a waste of time," Steve pointed out which caused Nat to just shrug. "I'm learning more about American Military History then get my teaching degree so I can teach the subject."
"No, I'm fuckin' sober," he said as he lifted his head off from Steve's shoulder then tried leaning in the kiss him.
Stane and Tony shook hands. "Nice to meet you, Anthony," he said politely with a small smile on his face.
"I gotta go," Tony finally said, even though he didn't want to leave the warm hug. He tangled his fingers through Steve's hair, bringing his lips down to his own. It felt like this moment was going to last forever.
He turned to face JARVIS who was spinning around in a circle as he was happy to finally get out of the room. "Why are you so impatient?" He asked as he sat up, kicking the box off to the side of the room so he wouldn't trip over that again. "You could've killed me."
Tony smirked. "Steve should be happy that he gets to be with someone as great as myself. I mean, I would be lucky to be dating myself."
"Yes, mister Stark. Goodbye, friends!" He waved goodbye to the group of girls before following Tony to Uncle Happy's car.
JARVIS glanced around the room, when noticing that there was a person there that he had never seen before he got excited. "Company!" He shouted happily as he pushed himself up from the floor. He wheeled himself over to Stane who had knelt down in front of the hyper little robot. "Nice to meet you! I'm JARVIS!" He held out his tiny hand to Stane who chuckled as he gently shook it.
I am also taking this time to say thank you all to the people who've read this story, gave kudos, bookmarked, and subscribed. It means so much to me.
Steve started wandering around the dorm room, he honestly had no idea what he was suppose to do with himself now. He had an hour to kill until physics. To be honest, science wasn't Steve's strong suit and without Tony help he would be failing the class. Tony was the type of "tutor" that would just do the work for somebody else or tell them what to write so it wouldn't be in his own handwriting, Steve didn't want that though. He wanted to actually learn the material, not to cheat his way through the class which caught Tony off guard since all of the people that he helped out liked the east way through things. Especially college classes.
Hearing clanging, Steve turned to see two soldiers enter the remains of the room. He hesitated, not entirely sure if these were Fury’s men or not. Their minds were oddly blank of even the muted emotions that most people felt, but when one tossed a grenade, Steve had his answer. He jumped in the way, knocking the grenade away and quickly knocking one of the men off his feet. He was quick to throw the other off the walkway and into the sky, hoping that he had a parachute in that outfit before turning to look at the guy who was approaching the doorway, his feet echoing loudly on the metal path.
The blond man snarled in response “You have no idea what you’re dealing with.” But the tone made Tony wonder if he was a half feral sentinel, still capable of speech; even though he knew that Asgard didn’t have sentinels and guides, he wondered if they had some version of something similar because he didn’t quite feel like a perfectly in control mundane to Tony’s guide sense, but he’d never been very in tune with people anyway (regardless of the stereotypes that painted guides as empathic people persons).
“Absolutely. It’s what I’ve trained for.” At least, if he thought of the time spent testing his abilities in the lab as training, then he had. He had discovered he was good at identifying how many people were in another room without ever needing to see inside; he could take a good guess at age and fitness, as well as if they were handling weapons or not.
Steve clenched his fists and stepped closer. “Stark so help me God! If you make one more wisecrack-”
“I think Falsworth is a guide. Can you work with him?” Bucky asked, leaning against Steve, who could feel his friend getting sleepy in the warmth, with the beer and the relaxed chatter.
“Mr Stark.” Coulson greeted and Tony didn’t necessarily mind the guy, but he preferred his visitors to be invited.
“They only left you the co-ordinates, but I thought it prudent to find out what was at that location, sir.”
The alien glanced up at him, smirked slightly, but then dropped his gaze and stared at the floor without speaking.
He’d barely finished speaking when several old black and white photos appeared on the screen. Tony stared at the grainy faces, his eyes widening as he recognised the kid sat on the back of a jeep, a shield on the ground nearby.
But it was a moment too late, a door shut between them and as he watched Bucky raise his gun, Steve heard someone stepping into the other end of his car. Using his shield for cover, he crouched down and shot at the enemy.
“As who? Steve from Ohio?” Bucky’s anger lit up their bond, but Steve suddenly realised that it was hiding fear. “They’ll catch you; or worse, they’ll actually take you!”
“They will undoubtedly shoot back.” Peggy didn’t sound amused, but Steve was already worried about this mission without thinking too hard about it.
Crouching close to the panel, he shut his eyes and focussed his hearing on the circuits in front of him. They were definitely humming, and as he blocked out other sound, he could work his way along each relay to check they were all making noise.
“That might not be the right file.” He said quickly, hoping he didn’t get himself arrested before Bucky had even left for England.
Steve half wondered if Tony only did it to get a reaction as Fury strode around the table. “Doctor Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him.”
He headed to the back of the plane and opened the rear hatch to avoid having the god of thunder tear a hole in the vehicle.
“Indeed, sir. Unfortunately, most of the files on him simple refer to the locations of paper files as they have not been digitalised.”
“I didn’t know that either.” Which was actually true; she knew what the initiative was but he hadn’t bothered to admit the issues SHIELD had with him.
“I’m a sentinel.” He said, though he didn’t explain that he hadn’t always been. “But it got rid of my asthma and stuff, and I’m stronger now than I ever was.”
Fury turned to look at him. “Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.” He looked like he was trying to be reassuring, but Fury didn’t know that Steve was a guide and could feel the anger within him. “This does not mean that we’re making-”
“You were captured?” Steve spun to stare at him, his eyes flitting over Tony’s form even though he knew the man had clearly survived well enough.
“If it’s all the same to you, I’ll have that drink now.” The alien said heavily as he lifted his eyes to meet his brother’s gaze.
She shifted her backpack over to her other shoulder as her right shoulder was starting to get sore from holding it up on its own. "We still have fifth-teen minutes for class to start and honestly, I rather not talk about Tony with other people around."
"No!" He interrupted Tony. "I am as perfect as the day I was made." He looked out the windshield then gasped loudly. "We're here!"
Bruce leaned over Tony's desk and held his hand out to Steve. "I'm Bruce Banner," he introduced himself politely.
"If I could get through his room alive it'll be a miracle..." Steve mumbled to himself under his breath as he stood in the doorway of Tony's room. There were small pieces of hardware laying all over the floor, and since Steve had no clue what they could've been used for he didn't want to move them around.
"Who's that?" He asked Steve. He glanced over at his roommate who was just staring at the man in the hologram, his eyes became glossy. That gave Tony the sense to move away from this image. "Okay, let's check out North Korea and see what they're up to."
The drive through the country back roads was peaceful in a sense. It was a nice change than watching the town fly by them, the crops were something that JARVIS was fascinated with. It was actually getting so annoying that Tony stuffed him into his backpack to get him up to shut up. Tony just needed some peace and quiet from his long weekend. He couldn’t wait to get home he was thinking about it nonstop, how it would be to go back in Steve’s arms and snuggle on the couch while watching TV. It was a great thing to look forward to.
make drugs if I wanted- you know what, this is starting to sound bad. I'm here for physics and engineering, so I have a lot hardware stuff laying around which could be, in fact, dangerous and I don't want you messing that up."
"You have a cru-ush," she mocked with a huge smile on her face. "You have to tell us who it is! C'mon!" She nudged his shoulder trying to get him to talk, but it wasn't working.
Tony looked confused so he decided to zoom in on it. There was an older man in an army uniform standing on the front lawn. Tony had pulled the images for his hologram from Google Earth at the moment so he didn't have to waste more time and effort on making his own images if the hologram didn't work, so he wasn't sure how old that they were.
Steve let out a nervous sigh when he parked his red 1987 Honda Prelude in the dorms parking lot next to the building that was going to be his. He stared at the building for a few minutes before turning off his car and unbuckling his seat belt. It was time to get inside.
"Urgh..." He saw that he had a smirk on his face when moving the bowl off of the bathtub. Steve grabbed a washcloth and soaked it with cold water then mixed soap into it until it was lathered in it. "Okay, this may hurt but it'll be sure it won't get infected."
"Want some?" Tony held out the large can of energy drink to Steve but he politely refused. Tony scoffed. "Wasn't gonna give you some anyway." He put on his red-tinted sunglasses with a smirk.
Tony shifted in his seat with his arms folded over his chest while letting out an impatient sigh. "I dunno..." He thought about what if could have been for a bit, looking down at JARVIS. He smirked as he picked him up from his lap, causing JARVIS to let out a scream of surprise. "Is it JARVIS' eyes?"
The next day, there weren't any morning classes for anyone, but students were still allowed to be on the campus. So that gave the group a reason to go to their courtyard to hang out and to study for their afternoon classes that were going to continue on later that day. Last night, Tony had stayed in his room trying to process his feelings; he was trying to explain to JARVIS what was going on and after processing them, JARVIS had explained that he didn't believe that it was an anxiety attack but something else that he couldn't explain either. Then what was it? Tony stayed up all night trying to figure it out by searching it up on the internet but didn't find any good results that would've explained anything. There was a form that he was reading from that actually explained how he was feeling perfectly, but the reason behind it on the form was because someone had a... crush on someone else. Tony never had a crush before and he didn't have a crush on anyone as far as he could tell. It was probably just something else that he had to figure out for himself, because it was
"Oh, come on, Steve. I know he's a little... eccentric, but he's been acting out more so than usual. You've noticed that too, right?"
"If you guys need anything, don't be afraid to ask- Argh!" He shouted when Thor picked him up by the head. "That hurts! Let me down!"
"Steve," he said quickly, "Steve Rogers." He held out his hand to Tony who looked confused at the formality.
Tony groaned, leaning back but almost fell into the tub, luckily he caught himself before it was too late. "Rogers, like I said, it's not a big deal! All I need are bandages..." Once the bowl was filled, Steve set the bowl next to Tony on the tub. "What the hell am I suppose to do with this?"
Tony's phone started ringing in his pocket. When he took it out, he looked at who was calling. It was his father. That was so strange, Tony and his parents ever rarely talked due to the fact that they weren't the best parents in the world. Especially his dad, he always casted him aside and said that he was too busy to hang out with him or even talk to him. It turned Tony bitter towards to his parents since his mother wasn't any better.
"Cool, right?" Tony asked with a smirk on his face. "Now watch." With the hologram of the Earth still being emulated from his gloves, he clasped his hands together then pulled them apart, holding them out to his sides. The Earth hologram expanded, filling up the entire room. "Pick a place," he told his roommate.
"Weird? I'm not weird, you're weird!" Tony snapped. "Look, nothing is wrong, okay? Just don't worry about it." He held the door of the courtyard opened for Steve which was extremely out of character for him.
"Not at all," Howard said with a smile on his face. As he was about to walk past his son, he grabbed his arm and brought him close to him so he could talk to him without anyone else noticing. "You be on your best behavior," he hissed into Tony's ear before letting him go then leaving the room with Maria by his side.
“Which d’you think is worse?” Gabe asked, sniggering slightly. “The idea that Falsworth is actually this bad at cooking, or the idea that he’s a good cook and he had to grow up eating food that tastes like this.”
“Is it weird if I say I’m really pleased to meet you?” Captain Cooper asked, his wide brown eyes making him look about as dangerous as a toothless puppy. “I can’t believe I get to meet you.”
“I might have to disagree there. On the comic, it says ‘based on Captain Rogers and Captain Cooper.’ Your name comes first. I think it’s just that you don’t… well, look…” He trailed off awkwardly, apparently too polite to say that, even with muscles, Steve was still short and skinny.
The tactic wasn’t entirely successful as Thor pushed back hard enough that Tony lost control of the flight and they hurtled back to the ground. Wincing at the impact, which was only partially cushioned by his suit, he threw a fist at Thor in response to his attack but the man captured his right wrist, his other hand clamped around Tony’s left hand and his strength was causing problem with the integrity of the suit; it wasn’t designed to be crushed by a super strong alien and he could hear the strain of the metal.
For the most part, the SHIELD-lings ignored him. They were all so focussed on their work that he barely had to nudge at their minds to overlook him, but it meant that he could get started on the more fiddly repairs while aboard the helicarrier; it was easier to keep a steady hand on a ship this size than it would be the jet, so he’d just sneak out later. To be fair, he was pretty sure Fury had been goading them to do something, but he wasn’t sure if the director wanted them to head off like this or not. He liked to be in control, but even Tony (who was admittedly not the most sensitive guide when it came to other people’s feelings) had felt the devastation from Fury when Coulson had died.
He hadn’t really expected to survive the war, but now he wondered what had happened in the end; he should have asked Mr Jarvis. Everyone he’d come across was speaking English, so they had probably won, or so he hoped. But even so, maybe after so much time, people simply got on with their lives, no matter who was in charge.
Despite his melancholy thoughts of late, he couldn’t stop the grin from spreading over his face as the lights came on.
“Sorry kids, you don’t get to see my party trick after all.” Bruce hurried away from the sceptre, but he was seeping embarrassment at losing control at all.
“There isn’t much call for delicacy, but it can be done.” Thor assured them. “Where is best to strike you?”
Deciding they were a more immediate threat than Loki, who was groaning as he lay on his back, Tony moved to intercept the first wave. The Chitauri army was fast, and they were flowing down in a stream, not faltering on their path to the surface even when Tony knocked into one of them. He fired at them again and again, dodging the aliens and bits debris as he tried to figure out a way to gain the advantage.
“Of course they are. I was directly involved.” He grinned slightly as he swiped his taste of heaven and took a sip. “Which brings me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius?” He leaned his ass against the desk and grinned over the rim of his drink.
“There are still libraries?” Steve asked, a bolt of relief thundering through him at her words. “With proper books?”
“It’s a little big.” Steve managed to say as he focussed on taking steady breaths. “You save me any of that Schnapps?” He wondered, remembering the drink they’d nearly had the night before, like he’d used to have with Bucky so long ago; the chance to chat with a friend while the alcohol helped him relax.
As they stepped through a bookcase he’d stared at before and through the corridors he’d never guessed existed, Steve focussed on breathing.  His asthma had become less of an issue recently, but his chest was tight in that old, familiar way as they stepped out to look down at what looked like a bizarre operation theatre. The mutterings from below stopped as everyone stared up at him, and Steve looked away from Erskine, looking a little strange in a lab coat and up to Peggy Carter, who sighed slightly and led him down the stairs.
With a deep sigh of utter relief, Steve stood up and held a hand out to Tony, hiding his own wince as his wounded body throbbed all over; he felt sore everywhere.
The four of them slowly walked into the dorm so they wouldn't wake them up. Nat took out her phone then started to take a couple of pictures of the new sleeping couple, chuckling as she did.
"Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!" JARVIS kept shouting as he was waving his tiny robotic arm in the air to try and get Happy's attention. "I wanna guess! Uncle Happy!"
"Early?" Steve repeated mostly to himself. "What do you mean early? You have physics class at nine."
"Okay, okay, everyone off my desk." Tony used his backpack to push their arms from his table. "Oh! Here, you'll need this." He opened up his backpack and plopped a physics textbook on Steve's desk. "You're welcome."
Just as Steve finished wrapping it up, Tony quickly stood up, holding his right hand. "Okay, yeah, thanks," Tony said quickly, keeping his face down so Steve couldn't see that it was all red from him blushing. Steve watched in confusion as he watched Tony walk out of the bathroom and back into his room, slamming his door behind him.
"Right..." Tony sat down next to Steve on the couch. He was planning on telling him right here right now on how he felt, he was kinda hoping that maybe his drunk self would have told Steve everything, but guess that didn't happen since Steve didn't bring up anything like that. "Hey, Steve... There's something I wanted to talk to you about."
“We begin with a series of microinjections into the subject’s major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change.”
Tony was quiet for a moment. “Huh. My last therapist reminded me of Doris Day; kind of annoying and she always looked like she was about to burst into song.”
“Yeah. Not a child, I don’t think. But not an adult?” He said, listening to whispers of “Mach das nicht”, spoken in a voice that kept breaking in the middle. “Come on.”
They all fell silent, listening as Jim quietly checked out the room he’d entered. When he came back to let them know it was clear, the rest of them headed up.
“Hurts.” He gasped in an attempt to explain himself. “E-Ev-Ev…. Every- everything hurts.” He was shaking with the pain, but couldn’t seem to stop as the language skills evaded him. “It’s t-too much. Loud…” He couldn’t force enough control over his own body to explain what was going on.
“I was going to read my book, but thought I’d just shut my eyes for a minute.” He explained, shifting to sit comfortably.
“No! Not without you!” and the sincerity in his words rang across their bond; Bucky wasn’t going to go without Steve.
But Steve didn’t care where people were from. He wasn’t going to leave people prisoner just because they weren't from New York. “Is there anybody else?” He asked, urgently. He still hadn’t seen Bucky. “I’m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.”
“All the stuff JARVIS can do, and you ask if he can switch the lights on?” Stark rolled his eyes. “Lights in the tower, yes, because I have it all linked into his system. If you bought a regular flash light that runs on disposable batteries from the shop, then no. He has no access to that.”
“We have a Hulk.” He retorted, confident that the Avengers would win. Between himself, Steve, Bruce, Natasha and Barton, they could probably take him down, but with Thor as well? The older brother whose shadow Loki always felt dwarfed by? They’d get through this.
Besides which, he had a full bond with a heart-stoppingly gorgeous young man; he wasn’t going to try for another relationship with Pepper when his thoughts were filled with someone else. Steve was both smaller and younger than what he usually went for in guys, but Tony couldn’t deny the slender form was well built; when he’d first brought the kid to the tower and dressed him in dry clothes, Tony’s own t-shirt had been a little baggy around his trim waist, but had stretched beautifully over muscled shoulders and firm pecs. Tony had barely gotten a chance to see if the personality matched up on a day to day basis as he refused to judge someone on their behaviour just after they woke up in the future to find everyone they knew was either dead or well on their way there. He was still a little pissed at Fury’s insistence that the kid should go back to SHIELD the moment their bond began to settle, only two weeks after they had met. He was going to give it another few weeks then see if he couldn’t talk Steve into coming back, because no one should have to live in housing provided by SHIELD when there were alternatives.
“Captain Rogers, please calm down.” Fury was saying, and Tony raised his eyebrow when he noticed the look in the director’s eye; he was worried. About what damage the sentinel would do, or about the actual soldier, he wasn’t sure but Fury wasn’t gaining the guy’s trust at all.
“This guy seems to have some odd correspondence.” He nodded to the body on the bunk, who was only half dressed, so Bucky couldn’t see his rank. “Jacques is looking it over, because he thinks it looks coded, but I think so.”
Steve dropped to his knees and wailed as the pain began to build back up again, gripping as much of his face and ears as he could whilst curling in on himself.
“Because of him.” Fury pointed at Thor, leaving no room for doubt as to where he laid the blame. Steve turned to look at the apparent thunder god as Tony got to his feet; as a guide, he was no doubt feeling the negative emotions that permeated the air too.
Steve had come down as ordered, gotten himself cornered and kissed by Private Lorraine and then cleared up what Stark had meant by fondue.
“No.” Fury groaned, but Tony couldn’t twist enough to see anything but the sentinel’s t-shirt; there was a hand cupping the back of his head, holding him protectively. Tony could actually feel the growls rumbling in the man’s chest now. “Captain Rogers, put him down. I promise to explain what’s going on, but you need to leave him here.”
“Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait but I must say, you do it better than anyone.” Schmidt said by way of greeting as he strolled over to Steve. “But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain.” He scoffed. “Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?”
And that was interesting. Natasha Romanoff had a true bond with sentinel Clint Barton which had developed over several years from a surface bond they had had; but now her file had been updated less than an hour ago to state she had another true bond, this time with Bruce Banner, the guy who had tried to copy the serum that had been used on Steve.
” Fury informed them over the ear pieces, and Steve felt both his own jolt of pain, and a deeper one that had to come from Tony.
“Well, it’s a fair.” He shrugged, unable to looking into the expression on his friend’s face. “I’m gonna try my luck.”
“You need to step away!” Fury stated, and Steve felt a hint of concern ripple through him, at odds with the blinding anger that had been there moments before.
“Did you know about this?” Bruce asked as Natasha entered the room with Thor, his eyes focussed on his guide.
“You said that Erskine wanted more for me than this.” He said, hands braced on the side of the vehicle. “Do you agree?” Did she think he was more than a chorus girl? He had been through basic training. He could do this… but it would be nice to hear it from someone else.
“So you and Bucky say.” He muttered with a sigh, but didn’t complain when the man laid a comforting hand on his soldier.
“You got somewhere you want to go, or are we heading home?” He raised his voice and twisted his head to press his lips against the kid’s ear to make sure he was heard, still held tightly against him as he listened to Fury’s words, but he chose not to respond to them.
“And training lasted so long… I kind of stopped thinking about it.” He shrugged. Bucky had been training for nearly nine months; his best friend had really enjoyed it but he hadn’t left New York yet. Now, Bucky was leaving the country to go fight… and possibly die.
“Hey, you’re not alone Steve. Come on, not alone. I’ve got you. Deep breaths for me.” He stepped closer again, allowing his body to press against the kid’s as he wrapped an arm over his shoulders. “If you need me to count breaths, I can do that. But it’s probably better if you do the counting. Okay?”
“Well, Mr Jarvis said that my clothing is getting cleaned and that these are acceptable to wear.” Steve replied, just managing to avoid making the statement into a question; he hoped Mr Jarvis was correct and his clothing wasn’t too casual. He had said that Mr Stark didn’t often have guests at his home here, so perhaps the housekeeper had made a mistake.
“Captain Rogers? Mr Rogers? Steven? Steve?” He repressed a shiver at being called Mr Rogers; it reminded him of his schoolmaster from the days he’d been well enough to attend. Doctor Foster gave him a moment but when he didn’t say anything she glanced around to see what he was looking and she smiled again. “It’s quite a mix, I know, but those ones are pictures that my grandchildren made for me. I know they don’t match the prints of actual works of art I have up too, but I like to see them during the day.”
“It means you should call me Howard. Now this? This is carbon polymer. Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although, Hydra’s not gonna attack you with a pocket knife.” He led Steve passed the damaged remains of Cooper’s shield, still with a dent in it from Schmidt’s fist. “I hear you’re kind of attached?”
“You bastards.” Falsworth grouched good-naturedly, but even he couldn’t quite hide his grimace as he ate. “We were missing a few important ingredients. I had to improvise.”
Steve laughed a little bitterly. “Only one guy who was ever both, but he wasn’t just a guy.” After all, the church taught that Jesus had been a guide and a sentinel, but he had been able to balance himself out, instead of needing a bond with others to keep him right. Steve was a guide and a sentinel, but he still needed a guide to help him when he tried to focus in on little things, someone to keep him connected to his own body. Most guides didn’t need a bond in the same way sentinels did, which was fortunate because there were more guides than sentinels. However, some apparently lost themselves in the spiritual world and struggled to return without a bond to a sentinel to pull them back.
“Was he married?” Steve had managed to slip into the section without Tony realising, but he took a moment to raise his eyes from where the floor retracted.
“Yeah. There’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you.” Tony stated as his gaze shifted over to the spear that was on the seat away from Loki.
“The Second World War? Yeah, in 1945. There have been other wars since then, but I decided a few years ago that building more powerful weapons to blow people up? There are too many ways that can go wrong.” Discomfort and remembered pain and fear echoed along their bond, but Steve was busy fighting his own sinking feeling.
“Captain?” There was a warm hand resting on his head, and Steve’s eyes fluttered open as his body shook with shock and residual pain.
“Sir, I’ve turned off the arc reactor, but the device is already self-sustaining.” Ordinarily, he’d be thrilled at that news, as it meant the whole thing had gone off without any hitches. Unfortunately, it wasn’t what he needed right now.
“Steve always had a good memory.” Bucky defended him loyally, flicking a small clump of dirt at Falsworth and hitting him in the side of the head. “When he noticed stuff, he’s good at remembering it.”
“Not mine.” Steve called back as he stepped in front of Bucky and positioned the shield in front of himself.
” He could tell from her tone that she was starting to get exasperated; lucky for him, she wouldn’t get angry back, especially over something like this. She was good at trying to understand other people, and she always pointed out the less pessimistic possible reasons for their actions. “
Tony gave him an awkward smile, but Steve could feel the ripple of trauma that likely originated from this event. “One of my own weapons blew up next to me. That’s why I have this to keep me alive.” He tapped the glowing disc on his chest.
He nodded with a sigh. There was a lot to get through and then he had to go through SHIELD’s servers because he honestly doubted he’d been given full files for anyone, not even Steve. “Fly safe.” He commanded, a faint smile twitching at his lips; he’d been really looking forward to actually relaxing with a friend and talking things over. A lot of their talk recently had been about clean energy as opposed to anything more personal; the brief chat about Steve they’d had earlier was about as in depth as they had gone and he was sure Pepper had finally been going to tell him she’d started dating again (he knew she had because he kept an eye on his friends, but he never brought up things they hadn’t mentioned for themselves because he didn’t really want to get into a discussion on levels of privacy again).
“I know. But this is good. Means I’m fully trained, I’ve got a smart uniform, better made than any of my other stuff.”
“What happened?” Rogers whispered, and Tony was actually starting to regret not talking to Fury; he had no idea who this kid was or what his problem was.
“I hope so.” Then he hesitated slightly, a question coming to mind that he wasn’t sure if he should ask. “Can I… if it’s okay to ask, why is Colonel Philips angry with me? I only spoke to him the once and I didn’t give a smart answer back.”
“Tell you what, buddy…” Bucky started with a smug grin as he straightened up, “I will find some for you. Just gotta promise me you aren’t gonna go picking fights with this slingshot once you’ve made it or I’ll be in trouble with your ma.”
” Steve pointed out, and though he sounded fine over the ear piece, he was decidedly frustrated along their bond.
“He killed eighty people in two days.” Black Widow glowered, and Steve wondered if her anger was bubbling just below the surface or if it had been pushed aside until later.
“And there’s one other person you pissed off. His name was Phil.” He snarled, firing his repulsor and knocking Loki off his feet.
“I’ll tell them you lied.” Steve said, his voice cracking as though he was still a fifteen rather than approaching twenty one. “They won’t let you in if you have a true bond and I can’t get in. They’ll either have to let me go too, or they’ll keep you back.”
“The picture of the man? I think I’ve seen it before.” Or a picture of it, he supposed because he could remember it in black and white; the man standing on a bridge with his hands up to his face, his mouth open.
Not that Bucky totally agreed with the idea that friends were like siblings. He still had two brothers and often said he would rather Steve be his friend, but it didn’t change his friend’s caring nature, no matter what he said their friendship was.
Tony spotted several more stragglers getting close to the perimeter and blasted over to them, his own sheep following after.
They stepped out and Tony led him through the reception area of his personal floors, a large open space with steps leading up to a big balcony. There was a kitchen on the right as you came through the foyer from the elevator and Tony’s bedroom Tony’s bedroom on the left. Up against the gigantic windows that opened the room up to so much light stood a red and gold robot.
Reaching out again, Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s curling hair; the act was a little intimate, but he wanted to offer some comfort, and he was covered in metal everywhere else.
He could hear is guide explaining that they were locating the cube to Fury as he hurried back to them.
The dark haired man sighed. “Steve, I’m not going to zone out at any point; I’m really not that strong a sentinel and I’ve been in training for ages. They know I’m stable. And you can’t get in because you have a list of health problems.” Bucky clapped a hand to his shoulder and their bond, which was tightening painfully began to ease up with the contact. “You aren’t going to get in just because you said you’re from Manhattan instead of Brooklyn.”
“He’s your sentinel, right? Agent Barton?” She was a guide with two true bonds; one with Agent Barton and one with Bruce.
“Only very vaguely.” He shrugged apologetically. “If that staff is what Loki used to alter people’s minds then hopefully it can undo that damage too.” Maybe he shouldn’t approve of the scientists working on something other than finding the cube, but small victories along the way were appreciated.
It was a nice idea in theory to get propaganda pictures for the newspapers, but damn if Bucky hadn’t had enough of Stanley, the idiot with a camera trying to get people to pose when they were trying to get on with their lives. Stanley seemed to think that it put him outside of their ranks, that he could tell them where to stand so he could get a picture.  Cooper hung out with the Howling Commandos often enough that he was willing to trust them; if someone said ‘duck’ then he ducked and would only ask why later on if he couldn’t figure it out for himself.
“I have a plan. Attack.” Tony stated, jumping out the plane and flying down without looking back at his sentinel; he had a feeling he’d be wearing that wide eyed, earnest expression that made Tony think twice about what he was doing. And that just wouldn’t help here.
“What have you done?” Schmidt whispered, picking up the glowing blue cube that had fallen out. “No!”
“I think I remember something about that. There was something in the newspaper a few years ago about a guy trying to show they had guides too.” It didn’t really burn going down his throat anymore.
“Nice, cheap food, covered in grease and altogether unhealthy.” The older man decided as Happy nodded and indicated a turn.
“You’re gonna make me stay with people I barely know?” Steve tried to give Tony a pathetic look, but Happy’s chuckles from the front made it difficult to look serious.
“You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.” Natasha stated confidently, but Bruce was getting agitated.
“Steve! Barnes!” Cooper shouted to them, his bulk easy to spot in the narrow trenches. “Morita found a map.”
“Forty eight hour passes and a place to stay?” Bucky grinned across at the inventor. “Sounds like a dream come true.”
“He will be. In an hour or two, hopefully, maybe less with the way he flies.” She grinned at him. “He’s travelling through, but I don’t think he could resist the detour to see you.”
Their attacks were blasting things on the surface, cars and buildings… He could see the movement of terrified people whenever he glanced down.
“Oh.” Tony sighed. “Alright. Yay. Hurray. Good job, guys.” He sounded even more exhausted than Steve, who honestly just wanted to go to sleep despite having one foe left to capture. “Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day. You ever tried shawarma? There’s a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is, but I wanna try it.”
Steve huffed slightly, unable to fully disagree. “My body and my mind are more exhausted now than ever before.” He grouched light heartedly.
“We were right.” Gabe said from behind them, as he listened in on the radio. “Doctor Zola’s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle.” Gabe straightened up. “Wherever he’s going, they must need him bad.”
“I will roger that.” He replied checking to see where was best to take it; somewhere already badly damaged to try and contain the destruction was preferable.
Steve went first, sliding down the cable and landing nimbly on the roof of the train as Bucky and Gabe followed. Once they were all in position, he began to move as quickly as he safely could further up the train. Leaving Gabe on top, he and Bucky headed inside.
“A higher form?” Steve asked, wondering if this had started with Schmidt or if Steve had prevented this ‘higher form of war’ from becoming an issue earlier. Either way, he was annoyed that the government were the ones messing around with stuff they didn’t understand.
“No. It’s not the exams I’m interested in.” Dr Erskine assured in a warm voice that called for Steve’s trust. “It’s the five tries… But you didn’t answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?”
Oh, that was surprising. His clothing had only been a little damp from the rain, it certainly hadn’t gotten muddy yet. “Can I head out the room like this? Will Mr Stark mind?” If the man was even around, for all Steve knew, Mr Stark had other appointments to keep instead of watching a lost soldier.
As predicted, amusement blossomed in her eyes, though she managed to keep a straight face. “Twelve percent?”
He dreaded having Bucky’s Ma knock on his door to say he’d gotten himself killed because Steve had been too pathetic to be allowed to go with him.
“No, no, no- threatening. No drink? You sure? I’m having one.” Though he did hope the others were getting up here. He didn’t have super strength or super speed, regular sentinel abilities or even the ability to subdue someone with his own guide abilities; he had some awareness of other people’s emotions and the ability to go unnoticed when he wanted to, but nothing useful in this situation as Loki was far too aware of him to forget he was here.
“I… wouldn’t consider him a role model.” JARVIS sounded nervous, as he sometimes did when Tony was about to do something truly idiotic… or in this case heroic – he hoped.
“You find somewhere for us all to eat so I can get some sleep. Then I’ll be happy.” He tried to give the man a smile, but it felt pitiful as all his remaining energy was going to looking strong for everyone else.
“You don’t get into fights often?” He looked up at Tony, taking in his hair and posture… the man was an engineer rather than a soldier, so maybe he didn’t have to do battle too often.
“Eighty, ninety… that’s one hundred percent!” Stark called out, as Steve forced himself to keep quiet; he wasn’t going to help anyone if they stopped this experiment before it was finished.
And Steve couldn’t help the roar of anger as the man foamed at the mouth and died. He shook the body a few more times before dropping to his knees and huddling up, unable to decide what to do now.
Base was gone; long gone. He was stuck in the future in the home of the wrong Stark. The pain of his broken bond increased as awareness filled him and he fell back onto the swamp-like bedding, with a soft mattress and thick coverings that he struggled to free himself from.
“What do you mean?” Erskine didn’t touch him, which was a relief and even the press of the air from the gathering crowd felt crushing, but the scientist was warm beside him. “From the machine? Is it fading or is this an overwhelming sensation? Senses in overdrive?”
“Kay, the relays are intact.” He stood up and slid the panel back into the wall. “What’s our next move?”
“I’m not the one making these decisions.” He was quick to explain. “I’m simply following orders, same as you.”
A wave of exhaustion suddenly washed along their bond as though the kid had only just realised how tired he was.
“Always a way out.” He glanced over at Bruce as he felt a pang of hurt from him too. Tony sure was lucky to have made such a good friend in so little time. “You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.”
“Then how come you’re running?” Steve shouted at him, but the men left without reply as another series of explosions set off below them.
Erskine handed him his file. “Congratulations, soldier.” Then he walked away as Steve gazed down at the new stamp.
The two had disappeared, but Tony quickly scanned the area. “Come on, come on.” He muttered, before spotting them on a rocky outcrop. “There.” He tackled Thor out the way, hopeful that Loki would come as easily as he had before.
He knew the serum sapped his energy to heal him quickly, but that was how he knew he needed sleep; he could still feel the deeper wounds as his body struggled to heal while he was running around with nothing in his system.
“My name is JARVIS.” The voice replied calmly. “I run the house for Mr Stark. If you wish to use the bathroom, there is a door to your left. There is also a new toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste in the cabinet for if you prefer to clean your teeth before eating.”
“Just tell me what to do.” Steve instructed, pleased to see that Tony could ask for help when he needed it… if he even needed it; he’d be able to survive a fall back to Earth in his fancy, flying suit. It was them who needed him.
“Better yet, bring it out here and I’ll incinerate it myself.” He began walking back inside as his machines whirred around him, removing the armour.
Thor was crouched over him and looking up, Steve could see that portal had closed. “What?” He croaked, allowing the alien prince to pull him up.
“He knew Dr Erskine.” Steve explained to Cooper, a conversation he’d already had with the rest of the men, but Cooper and Stanley hadn’t been with them at the time. “Erskine considered him a failure as the experiment increased his aggressive and greedy nature.”
“Well, I think that was meant for you.” He gestured to Tony, and Steve felt interest glimmer along their bond as the guide held out the back of fruit for Bruce. “Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news.”
“Yes sir.” Tony resisted the urge to snort as JARVIS paused for a dramatic moment. “One week ago, SHIELD received a call from a Russian oil team in the Arctic Circle saying they had found a man in the ice… and that he had a rather familiar shield.”
“I’ve heard of it.” He said, finally raising his head to look at her. “Something to do with monkeys, but that’s all I know.”
“I’m sorry, Nick.” Tony interrupted, spinning one of the computer screens around for them to see. “What were you lying?”
“In looks, but he’s really you. Have you read any of the comics?” Surprised, Steve met the earnest gaze.
“You’re not going alone.” Even if Tony survived the trip to space, he would still be in space! Just thinking about it made him feel helpless.
“Stark. You are still keeping to your own quest?” Thor checked as he smashed a guy in the face with his hammer, sending him flying.
“Sir? The telephone. I’m afraid my protocols are being overridden.” JARVIS spoke up just as Tony’s phone began to talk.
Dr Erskine smiled over at him as he made his way over to the desk that had been set up outside for him.
“I think I’ll feel better once I’m back into my routine of working and planning and training.” Clint said simply, and Steve nodded.
What had happened to Howard in between the war and his car crash? He must have gotten married and had at least one kid, which was bizarre to think about; Howard must have met a pretty special dame to make the flirt settle down.
“I would advise helping him focus on his breathing, sir.” JARVIS suggested. “Perhaps getting him to use his senses to focus on other things, such as counting a specific number of things he can see and hear.”
“Okay, Mr Stark. I mean, I did have a conversation with him earlier on.” The young sentinel accepted, aware that he didn’t know enough to argue this point, but also aware that JARVIS had spoken to him and certainly seemed like a person in those moments.
“I have a bit of free time if you want to come see my suit?” Tony suggested, and while Steve wasn’t really interested in a suit of armour, it was clear that this was important to Tony, his guide’s mild anxiety thrumming along their bond.
“This… isn’t your first true bond?” Rhodey’s voice was soft, almost hesitant but Steve kept his eyes down and stared intently at his arms, at the way his hands looked as they spread flat on the smooth surface of the counter.
“You think Fury’s hiding something?” He pushed back the rising frustration to consider this properly.
Tony stared at the gap where Bruce’s cell used to be. His back to the place where Coulson had died. They hadn’t cleaned all the blood yet; there were other, more important things for people to be doing. But it just seemed wrong.
“The moon. That sure is something.” He mumbled into his skin, wondering how long it took someone to get there.
He headed over to the table and grabbed a bowl of pasta, taking the cover off and smiling slightly at the excess sauce and cheese over it; Pepper knew what he liked. He snagged a fork as he turned and headed for the elevator.
“More useful than you might think.” He shrugged, having knocked out numerous soldiers with it already.
Resisting the urge to make a smart comment in return, Tony nodded. “Yeah, back to the tower with me.” And a smile quirked at his lips when Happy simply nodded his head and began to edge their way through the streets, leaving an irate Nick Fury behind.
Erskine sighed and straightened up. “It is nothing personal.” He explained as he turned to watch the one of the groups jogging together towards the obstacle course. “You simply do not match his idea of a soldier.”
He passed a handful of people, but he kept up a confident stride so that no one tried to talk to him. In the corridors around the storage bays, Steve couldn’t ignore the sinking feeling as he heard a familiar humming noise. He’d heard it in abundance not a full month ago in the Hydra camp where he’d confronted Schmidt. It had resonated in all their weapons.
“I can spell.” He stared silently at Steve for a long, painful moment then he stood up, taking a stack of papers with him. “I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count… But, the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.”
Tony patted his shoulder and headed off to the elevator as Steve shut his eyes and let his head drop onto his arm, slumping over the counter as the new information swirled around in his head.
“I don’t want to talk to him.” He really should drop this grudge as Steve had agreed to leave when Fury had turned up to collect him several weeks ago, but he was nothing if not stubborn.
“Not sure.” He accepted another pint off Jim and sat back. “He won’t be able to travel with us though.” They had just gotten everyone to agree to work as a team together, to take down Hydra, but Howard Stark wasn’t a part of it.
The screaming man could be, like Steve, someone who was just going to have to cope with the modern world on his own, the comfort he wanted inaccessible.
“Phase two is SHIELD using the cube to make weapons.” He half growled, irked that SHIELD was resorting to Hydra’s tactics of using something they didn’t fully understand. “Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.” He added for Tony, a little sharply as his emotions spiked with anger again.
He blasted out the beast and smashed through a bus shelter, into a taxi and then, as he staggered up, into a sign and back onto the sidewalk as numerous Chitauri shot him back down.
” Tony’s voice was calm over the ear piece, and Steve was relieved to find that hearing him didn’t stir up any anger this time.  “
“Yes!” Bucky tried to stop him, not even trying to hide how he wanted Steve safe with the women and children. “Why not?”
He tapped the screen inside the folder, bringing up the folder options. “Apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed, don’t play well with others.”
Doreen was a honey badger and the most stubborn creature Steve had ever encountered. She was Bucky’s spirit animal and so his guide when Steve couldn’t be there; the only problem with the spirit animals was that they were only tangible when the human was able to drop into a meditative trance, and they couldn’t affect things in the physical world. Doreen and Sandra would be no comfort to Bucky if he couldn’t drop into the spiritual plane.
“Hey, Come on, buddy. You listening to me? You’re breathing a bit fast there.” Tony rubbed a hand over his shoulder; he had no idea what he was doing. Their bond felt almost like white noise, everything churning up at once…
Tony nodded. “Yeah. It took a lot of work to get it right, and I still change things when I find problems.” The man shrugged, but he was starting to relax as he chatted about something he was clearly passionate about. “You see, the main thing was getting it to fly. I was… I built the first one after I got captured in the desert, so I needed something to fly well enough to get me far from their base and across the sand without having to walk the full way.”
“Oh geez!” He gasped as he crouched behind the support pillar, trying to decide how to take him down.
Tony looked over at him with a raised eyebrow. “You liked her? Well, I guess you did miss her whole film career.”
But he supposed there could be another screaming man out of shot of the painting, another distressed figure that was the artist’s sister, locked in a place where everything seemed strange and frightening, trapped from the familiar outside world… Maybe he was the sister, locked away by the ice and now forced into a new age, and the screaming man was Howard and Peggy and the Commandos, forced to continue on without him.
Tony’s jaw dropped when he realised there was a man in the ice, holding a shield; not the bright, colourful shield of Captain America and Captain Cooper, but one from the rare photos of Captain Rogers, with the dark blue circles in different shades and a grey star in the centre.
“Well. Perhaps we had best start with how you’d like me to address you.” The woman smiled gently at him, everything about her seemed to invite trust; from her warm, crinkled eyes and her messy bun of greying hair to her plump figure and relaxed posture, she had a motherly warmth about her that seeped into the air. Steve kind of wanted to ask if she was a guide with the way he felt influenced about her before he’d even had a chance to speak to her, but he’d already made a number of mistakes with raising topics that were now taboo, or finding himself close-lipped about things that people in this age freely chatted about. He wasn’t sure if this was an acceptable topic and he didn’t want to keep getting it wrong.
“Not my fault they keep animals around to experiment on, or test weapons on or why ever they keep ‘em. But I’m not gonna just leave them there.” He pointed out, breathing deeply as they finally left the tunnel, stepping out into cleaner air.
“Thanks.” The burger had an odd flavour to it, but it was warm, covered in cheese and a gift from his guide, so Steve quickly devoured it.
Philips and Peggy stared over at him. “Get in!” yelled the colonel, and for once, Steve didn’t hesitate to follow orders.
“Maybe it’s hard to realise cos you’re getting older, but I’ve spent a lot of time working for peace.”
Pepper was aware of his agreement with Happy, and while she thought the guy was paranoid, she also never insisted Tony break his promise. “That’s fine, because I love being handed things.” She reached out and took the file off Coulson, handing the agent her flute in return. “So let’s trade.” So took Tony’s flute off him, handed over the folder and took a drink. “Thank you.”
“It’s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?” Steve asked, trying to reassure the doctor without actually saying anything so obvious.
“Should have asked Agent Carter to go dancing with you.” Steve’s face reddened at Bucky’s words. “She would have said yes.”
“Shit.” Tony repeated, pressing a gauntleted hand to his face. “Okay. L-Let’s head back to the bridge.”
“Speak English!” Steve interrupted, wanting simple instructions that he could follow… He was definitely going to have to ask about classes if this was the kind of work he was going to be doing from now on.
“That needs to be a plural. It’s good to have new ideas in advance of when I need them.” Tony lifted off slowly, as though checking Steve was steady before his boots took over the bulk of the thrusting and an arm circled Steve’s waist.
Tony couldn't help but crack a small smile at that. At least someone remembered that JARVIS wasn't an it. He took off his backpack, and knelt down on the floor to let JARVIS out. Actually, he didn't even get to unzip his backpack halfway when JARVIS was trying to squeeze his way out.
"Tony... You didn't have to get drunk to tell me that..." Tony leaned his aching head against Steve's right shoulder. "I was going to tell you eventually."
"It's time to go!" He had shouted while circling around Steve and Tony to get their attention. "I want to be free!"
JARVIS was wheeling himself around the entire hallway, he couldn't stay still at all. It was rare that he left the dorm, and when he did he enjoyed himself.
Happy pulled out of the parking lot and started driving down to the highway. "So how have things been going, Tony?"
The three of them stopped talking when the teacher announced that class was now starting and for everyone to take out a notebook to take notes in. Of course, everyone did what he said but Tony. It was a wonder for Steve that Tony was passing any class at all with that attitude.
Tony clasped his hands together, when he did the center of his gloves glowed a light blue color. He held his right hand's palm up pointing towards the ceiling, that glove still glowed blue. The small circle in the center of the glove that emulated the light started to form a shape. Steve watched in awe, he was trying to guess what the shape was before it finished taking place. Tony decided to start off with something simple; in this case, he made a hologram of the Earth that was small enough to fit in his hand.
Steve sat back down next to Tony again, he put antibiotic ointment on a large piece of gauze then wrapped it around Tony's palm before unwrapping the bandage roll. For some reason, Tony couldn't help but blush while watching Steve fixing up his burn. Was he having an anxiety attack? Something didn't feel right in Tony's stomach, something that he had never felt before and didn't understand what it was. He just wanted Steve to stop so he could sulk back into his room to try and analyze this feeling.
"We'll be getting in touch soon, Mister Stark." Stane patted Tony on the shoulder before leaving the living room.
Right when Tony pulled himself out of bed JARVIS was at his feet trying to get attention. There were times when Tony honestly couldn't tell if he had made a robot or a puppy. JARVIS kept scooting around in front of him until he eventually tripped over him and fell onto the floor, landing on a large cardboard box that had a bunch of spare parts of them. A bunch of sharp ends poked into Tony's chest, causing him to yelp in slight pain.
Tony put his hands in his blazer's pockets as he walked over to them. "Y'know, I hate taking your time away from talking to your friends, but we really need to get going, buddy."
"It's just a burn, Rogers relax, okay? It'll go away eventually." Steve rolled his eyes before grabbing Tony's arm and practically started to drag him to the bathroom with him complaining the entire short way. "Dude, I didn't realize how strong you were."
He had to be only a year or two younger than Steve was. He had brown hair and big brown eyes to match and it looked like he was starting to grow a beard. The smirk he was wearing gave Steve the idea that he was always causing mischief. He was wearing a large, red hoodie with a AC/DC shirt underneath it and black jeans.
"Leave him alone, Tony," Nat defended again with an eye roll. It was clear she had put up with Tony's shit for a long time. "But give me his number too." She took out her Android. "We'll add him to our group chat."
"So, what are you in for?" Nat asked when she sat down on the bench next to Clint, still holding his hand.
It was totally unexpected that someone like Steve could have a crush on someone like Tony. Tony was a snobby rich kid with a huge ego; that is the complete opposite of Steve, so Nat had every right to be confused as hell.
"I like your robot, Tony," one of the girls told him with a wink. The girls started giggling at them.
Underneath the blazer, Tony was wearing a black AC/DC t-shirt while wearing black jeans and black dress shoes. Tony's father had texted him earlier that morning to remind him that he had to look somewhat presentable, so this was the best that he could do. Well, not really. In Howard's mind, looking presentable meant wearing a full on business suit with a tie and all that fancy stuff. There was no way that Tony was wearing one of those to this, it wasn't worth his time or effort, so he half-assed it. Tony was only a bit nervous about the meeting once because he was going to see his dad again after a few years. He had no idea what he was going to expect.
Maria giggled at JARVIS, he was always trying to help around the house. "No thank you, JARVIS. I think I'm good."
"Thanks for the words of encouragement," Tony said sarcastically. He took off his sunglasses and hooked them onto his Ramones shirt. "This is Rogers, he's with me." He nodded to Steve who was standing awkwardly while they were having their conversation.
"Um... okay?" He sat on the couch like he was told to. Normally he wouldn't do what someone told him to, but it was Nat and she could be kinda scary if she really wanted to be, and this time it was clear that she didn't have to have any joking around. "What's going on?" He asked her when she sat down in the chair across from him. "I mean, you really do look pissed off-"
"Damn straight." Tony hopped down off of the coffee table and almost stumbled into the kitchen to get himself some coffee."So, what'd you do last night?" He called back into the living room as he was pouring coffee into his coffee mug. "Hope I didn't bother you too much being as hammered as I was."
"What's the matter?" Although Steve knew what Tony was trying to get across he didn't want to let him know that he knew what was going on. He could tell that Tony was nervous enough and didn't want to make it worse. "You know you can tell me anything, right?"
"I cared, I just been busy." JARVIS bumped into Tony's foot which actually did hurt a bit. "Ow! What's your issue?"
The magic? Steve thought to himself, still giving Tony a confused stare. What was he talking about. With a shrug, Steve stood next to Tony on the couch after taking off his shoes. While standing there next to Tony, Steve could just barely feel his arm brushing against Tony's, causing him to get goosebumps around the area. Along with those goosebumps, he also felt a slight electrical spark type feeling. What was that supposed to mean?
"Oh, no, no. I think I'm goo-" Steve put Tony's hand in the bowl of cold water forcibly, causing him to yelp loudly. "Goddammit, Rogers! That hurts!"
Steve had just gotten back home from his last class at around eight at night, he flung his book bag down next to the fridge like he did every night, but he noticed that AC/DC was blaring from Tony's room. Something didn't seem right. It was at the point in Tony's and Steve's friendship that they basically had the right to go into each others bedrooms if the door wasn't closed, since Tony's door was slightly opened, Steve took that as an okay to go into his room.
Tony clasped his hands together once more, closing the hologram. "Right, sorry... I didn't know that."
"Hello! I'm JARVIS!" He introduced himself to a group of girls who were walking to their dorm building.
She pointed to her couch. "Sit. We need to talk." Was all she said, and to be honest it was starting to freak him out.
He knelt down in front of the CD rack and started to look through all the different cases and bands that were scattered about. He picked up a case with a blank, black cover with only the bands and album name in grey print. It was called
"Relax." Tony stood up and opened the door to let JARVIS out into the living. He wheeled himself out there quickly to see Steve sitting on the couch, watching TV.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa," Mr. Richardson said to Steve as he was about to pass him. He kicked his feet up on the old desk that was as beat up as his office chair. "You're missing your other half there, Mr. Rogers."
The bet was whether or not Steve and Tony would get together by the end of the week or not. When Nat opened up their dorm door, they saw Steve and Tony napping with each other on the couch. Tony was resting his head against Steve's chest so he could hear his heart beating while Steve had his arms wrapped around Tony tight while they napped. They were both exhausted from the stress of telling each other how they felt, but now that they were dating they thought that it was time for a nap to reduce their stress. Add Tony's hangover to the equation, it was the best thing for both of them.
He pulled himself off of the floor using the bed as support, he was trying to stand up but was too disoriented and ended up plopping down on his bed instead. What happened was, Tony was trying to think of a way to tell Steve how he felt towards him. He got too nervous about it and started drinking instead to try and forget about it. Clearly that wasn't working out well so far.
When JARVIS turned around to see Maria Stark he got excited again. "Mrs. Stark!" He said then wheeled over to her. "Did you need anything?"
"Man, you got Tony as a roommate? I'm praying for ya," Clint said, slowly shaking his head with a low whistle. Tony shot a glare at Clint who just shrugged in response.
"I am sure that the Mechanic is not as bad as you claim," Thor stated. He had an unexpected accent and his voice was so deep that it boomed through the courtyard.
For the most part, he had spent his days so far trying to relax and failing. Now that his body had caught up on the rest required for his healing, insomnia and nightmares had taken over in equal measure.
When they reached a junction, Steve paused. The other junctions they had reached, one path had clearly been more used than others, but both of these seemed to be used on a regular basis, the scent of people hung in the air. Down the left corridor, he thought he could hear voices, but down the other, there was an odd noise that he couldn’t quite identify.
Steve took his hand off his guide’s back, but didn’t move back as the electricity visibly shot over the surface of the suit and the blue glow of the arc reactor spluttered back into existence.
“Yeah. Fury said I need to see her once a month and at least have a conversation with her once a week.”
“How would you know if it’s- Why is he ‘Phil’?” A nickname again? The thought of them two hanging out enough to warrant nicknames was going to make him paranoid.
“Yeah.” Gabe sighed, sliding a finger under his helmet to scratch. “Doctor Klaus Schmidt. Another random scientist Hitler’s forgotten about, I think.” He shrugged as they all turned and headed back down the ladder.
He turned and ran down the corridor that the men had pointed him down, sighing in relief when he picked up a scent that was undeniably Bucky. His friend was here.
“All right, get him on his feet.” Tony grinned over at Steve, his expression lightening slightly. “We can all stand around posing up a storm later.” The engineer turned and began to head off, one hand moving to the edge of his chest plate before he turned back. “By the way, feel free to clean up.”
“I’ll show you how.” Steve could only just hear her over the roaring wind with his sentinel hearing. “Just be there.”
One of the two remaining pilots got into the plane for New York, and the other pilot tackled Steve as he tried to pull him back out. He dropped his shield in the aircraft, and then all three of them were falling, one in the pilot seat and himself and the other pilot clinging to the bomb.
“I know it’s his turn tomorrow, but he can swap. I’ll get a full night tomorrow, but I don’t want him getting sick.” The blond shrugged as he stretched out beside his friend.
“I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.” The Commandos hadn’t been about how much money they had, or how much they gave to others, they certainly hadn’t had any self-proclaimed geniuses or ‘play-boys’. “I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself.” The bright armour, the flashy displays? The woman is short skirts dancing around him? He was worse than Howard had been; he did what he did inside a suit of armour to gain attention. “You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.”
Once they reached the tower, Rogers silently followed him through the reception area to the elevator; thankfully, Tony could feel his mind starting to come back online as he judged the immediate threat gone. It didn’t stop the ride up to his floors from being awkward though; Rogers hunched his shoulders slightly and stared intently at Tony’s face, making the man wonder if he was claustrophobic, but he didn’t ask. It wasn’t a slow ride like in most elevators so they were stepping out soon enough.
“Thank you.” He said, trying not to feel overwhelmed as he stood up heavily and moved into the bright room, decorated using white tiles and glass. It reminded him of staying in Howard’s various homes, which always looked expensive and, no matter how often Howard had assured him it was all just
Loki looked eagerly over at him, clearly pleased to have the attention. “Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.” And Tony couldn’t help but wonder if Thor and Loki had a younger sibling, because this guy totally had middle-child syndrome; resentful and bitter that he had been ‘overlooked and undervalued’, desperate to be noticed.
“Last night.” Tony replied, and Steve felt a sudden wave of exhaustion before it was firmly suppressed. “The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?”
As he dropped back onto his mattress, eyes sliding shut, the young guide tried to recall the cool air of the early spring, when he’d worn a coat to keep back the chill as he’d watched Howard Stark’s show then headed over to the recruitment centre. With his clothing sticking to his skin with sweat, it was hard to remember being that cool.
“I made a new slingshot.” Steve admitted, a smile tweaking at his lips when Bucky turned his head to look at the other boy. “It’s not much good yet cos I haven’t got any leather for it, so I need you to keep an eye out for me. I know where to get some.”
Steve looked at the map she had on her knee, noting the slight differences between this one and the one Philips had.
“Behind you, big guy.” He called out as he took down one warrior who had been trying to get behind the thunder wielding alien.
“Nearly twenty four years ago.” Mr Jarvis’ voice was soft, with a comforting tone that Steve appreciated. “Mr Stark requests that you discuss Howard Stark with me, if you have any questions. SHIELD’s files indicate you knew each other but Mr Stark would prefer to not discuss his father.”
It would have been interesting, he supposed, if he wasn’t the test subject. However, having someone add a few drops of mild poison to his already bland slop was not appreciated, nor was the fact that he’d been unable to swallow more than one mouthful before he’d started gagging and chucking up.
Steve chuckled slightly. “We won.” He nodded to the fallen bodies of the Chitauri that surrounded them, which he had seen falling as he himself had lost consciousness from the pain.
“Doesn’t look like there is anything sharp in here.” Bucky grouched, but he came over and crouched down as well, making a start on the ropes on Erik’s legs.
“You’re on that list?” Tony smirked, but the curl of his lip wasn’t kind. “Are you above or below angry bees?”
As Peggy went to speak to Stark, Steve sat in the back of the plane and had a go at meditating. He watched as Sandra, his Puma, stretched out before him. His Spirit animal met his gaze flatly.
“Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?” Bucky asked as they stood waiting for a train.
He kept walking as the final plates were pulled away. “Grow a spine, JARVIS. I’m about to have a moment with my fully caffeinated coffee.”
“You’re late.” He said, stopping to stare up into her eyes. He could hear her breathing stutter as she saw him, the slight smile on her lips.
However, once they were back at the camp, Steve dressed in dry clothing with Stark sat close enough that they were touching, the new sentinel realised he likely wasn’t going to get his wish without Erskine to fight for him.
Fury had also stated that staying in Tony’s tower was not going to help him adjust to the new world. In some ways, Steve agreed with this; he hadn’t left tower yet, even though there were a number of things he wanted to do. He wanted to have a walk through the streets, go to the corner shops, take a walk through Dyker Heights Park, go find a church to attend (and heck, he felt bad about that one because it was Monday now! He’d missed Sunday Mass twice just because he hadn’t dared to step out the building).
“Rogers!” Falsworth shouted over the gunfire that had erupted with their entry. “You might need this.” He threw Steve’s shield to him with a grin.
“My bike still here?” He asked, wanting to go for a ride; he felt like he’d been stuck in the city constantly since waking in this century and he just wanted to head out for a while and clear his mind.
“Oh.” That actually sounded like the kind of thing he’d enjoy reading. “Dr Erskine gave me an injection of some kind and the Stark used a machine, but I’m not sure what was actually happening.”
He followed Tony’s scent along the corridor until he stepped into a room in time to see his guide prodding Bruce. “Hey! Are you nuts?”
And so it continued and for two long nights, the sentinel soldier had battled with himself to try and get some rest while he had time. After all, Philips and Brandt had left him in no doubt that the US government owned him; if Nicholas Fury was in charge of a branch of the government then Tony would only be allowed to keep him away for so long, then Steve would be back to fighting, this time in a new and very different world.
“What’s the matter?” Steve spoke up, and Tony saw he was looking back at their captive. “Are you scared of a little lightning?”
Bruce smirked, but his anxiety was far closer to the surface. “Hah, I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.” He chuckled as Steve’s attention slid away from them and over to Tony as he
He moved lightly along the corridor, his hearing tweaked to detect any slight noises as he followed the directions; not that he thought he was in any danger here, but everything was a little too unfamiliar for him to be comfortable.
“You people are so petty.” Thor laughed at them. “And tiny.” Steve glowered, not appreciating the dig at his height. He didn’t need to stand taller than 5’4’’ to help people, but he sometimes wished he was a little bit more impressive than this.
“Yeah. That’s just previews. This is, this is opening night. And Loki? He’s a full-tilt diva, right?” All eyes on him because he wanted to step out his brother’s shadow. “He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered… Son of a bitch.”
Rhodey smiled slightly as he replied “Philadelphia.” He looked a little nostalgic. “When were you born?”
“Where are you from, Mr Rogers? Hm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus?” Steve froze, unsure if he was supposed to answer, or if this was an elaborate set up to him getting arrested. “Five exams in five different cities.”
He was tempted to keep listening as the men began to talk, but he found that his guide was able to soothe away the worst of the pain of his broken bond but the absence of it combined with the relaxed atmosphere meant that he was seriously tempted to get some shut-eye with his face tucked into Tony’s neck like some kind of child.
“So you’re a sentinel?” Gabe Jones asked as they sat around a table in the English pub, enjoying both the alcohol and the atmosphere.
“You heard the colonel, your friend is most likely dead.” Peggy said, her voice compassionate as she stepped towards him.
As Philips used a booster to increase the speed, Steve stood up, ready to jump out. “Keep it steady.” He yelled.
“What about the others?” He asked, almost desperate for a chance to get his sentinel back. “Are you planning a rescue mission?”
“B-but I can ask Colonel Philips if he minds you travelling with Captain Cooper. He’s got a handful of soldiers who travel with him to keep the showgirls safe, to keep their morale up. I’m sure no one will care if you travel with them. There is a big note in your file about keeping you safe for Stark’s sake, but Cooper hasn’t ever had any real trouble.”
Dodging the gunfire, Steve grabbed one of the fallen guns and shot back at him, making the man hide behind the doorframe. Shuffling backwards, he edged towards the lever; he didn’t want Tony to get ripped to shreds because he got distracted. He avoided shooting to kill, uncertain on what to do; it was unfair to kill them if they were being controlled by Loki, but he wasn’t going to let them win either.
“I mean exactly that. He says about anything that can only be deemed a miracle, or magic, then he wants that person delivered to him.” Gabe shrugged, but he looked uncomfortable.
“We…” Stark dropped to his knees on the sidewalk and looked into Steve’s face. “I can feel you in my head.” His voice was soft, awed and there was a smile beginning to spread. “I’ve read about true bonds but this is… Wow.”
“Loki had him under some kind of spell.” Black Widow explained, her own emotions so completely sealed off that Steve suspected her own guide abilities were the cause. “Along with one of ours.”
Steve watched him marvel at the idea for a moment, before Bucky came to mind. Stark’s whole body jumped at the panic that ripped through Steve. What would this do to his bond with Bucky? He couldn’t even discuss it with anyone because they all thought that he had been mundane, and he wasn’t going to say anything that might get Bucky in serious trouble.
“Do you think I’m not?” Steve could feel the irritation stirring in Tony, but it didn’t seem to be directed at the sentinel. “Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before? What isn’t he telling us?” It was a good question, one Steve had asked of his superiors before deciding whether or not to follow orders, but Steve hadn’t gained enough confidence in this new century to start questioning authority. As annoying as it was, maybe he shouldn’t be surprised that Howard’s kid wasn’t too interested in marching to someone else’s tune; his old friend had only listened to Philips when it had suited him. “I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables.”
The first thing Steve was aware of was the quiet. Warm, so he must have slept under a thick blanket but it was eerily quiet; no voices, no footsteps, no wind in the trees or rattling through the window frames… There was a pain echoing through his head, but he could almost ignore it in the haze of sleep; he sure was tempted to sink back down into sleep and enjoy the moment of peace, but he ought to radio in with base and-
It was annoying, but he had to remember it wasn’t Selvig’s fault. “Okay.” He blasted both repulsors at the device that had been created using the Tesseract to make a doorway to Earth. However, the energy was deflected back at him, and he shot through the air, relying on his patchwork suit to catch him before he fell.
“Yeah.” Scrambling to his feet Steve quickly checked his guide over for injuries; he felt slightly shocked at the explosions, and a little bruised but nothing too damaging. They turned and headed off down a corridor, Steve happy to let Tony lead the way.
“That we should talk on the phone, but it doesn’t have to be a deep and probing conversation unless that’s what I want. And that I can
The unexpected voice seemed to jolt through Steve, and he lifted his head enough to stare into Bucky’s eyes.
“It was actually Howard who wondered if you would become a sentinel. Erskine thought you would be a guide and I thought you would be both.”
“I’ll still follow you, Captain Rogers.” Gabe hollered out, his serious tone ruined by the grin that was splitting across his face.
“Good. So where is the little guy from, actually?” Erskine asked as he began looking through the stamps.
“It’s too late. She can’t stop now. She wants to show us something: a new universe!” Selvig’s eyes had that bright, unearthly haze to them that he’d seen in the others brainwashed by Loki.
“I don’t know how much you know about computers, but pretty much everything here runs on a system. He has all sorts of information going in, then he processes it and takes action as necessary.” Stark was grinning, and the dull look on his face transforming into a more upbeat, excited expression. “He’s basically got the mind of an assistant, so he can remind me about stuff, or send messages, or adjust things that are electronic, but he doesn’t have a body.”
Looking around, he spotted another way across higher up. It wasn’t a proper walkway, but it would do. “Come on. Let’s go! Up!” He tugged on Bucky’s arm, getting his tired friend to follow him and they hurried up the stairs.
“We’re in the middle of bloody nowhere.” Falsworth huffed, one hand on his rucksack, which had Stanley’s camera in; they’d left the man at their camp rather than dragging him into this. Falsworth had promised to take photographs and tell him what had happened. “They probably aren’t expecting anyone.”
Dropping the archer on top of a building, he powered after a bunch of strays towards the acceptable perimeter. He shot over to them, firing his repulsors and taking two down and catching the attention of several more. Spinning around, he changed direction and went to collect a few more that were causing trouble down near street level.
“Rogers. Good to see you too.” But despite his joking tone, Steve could feel Stark relaxing against him.
Erskine shook his head. “I cannot say that I am. While I was never in a position of scrapping by to survive, I have encountered many who were. Eating enough daily makes a very big difference, not just to your body but to your mind as well.”
“I’ll come back. You know I will. And who knows, once you get food on a regular basis then maybe your health will improve too.” It was the silver lining Bucky had been pointing out since he’d decided to join the army; he would be getting fed every day, so he could send Steve his pay check and Steve would get to eat every day. With the extra energy that came from food, Steve could exercise more and his overall health would improve. The young guide wasn’t convinced that it would work, but it was too late now; Bucky was going and he didn’t want to ruin that hope.
“Me?” Erskine looked slightly startled at that. “This is me trying to make up for too many mistakes, some of them so large that…” He cut himself off, shaking his head. “No. I was a foolish coward and now I work to correct that mistake.”
“You lied? You had a go at me and you lied too?” Which was utterly unfair. Bucky complained that Steve was lying on his forms all the time.
“You think he’s looking for our Captain?” Jim asked, the subtle hint of irritation in his voice echoed in the movement of the others as they cast a concerned look at Steve.
“Is this about the Avengers? Which I know nothing about…” Pepper asked, her voice curious but Tony knew she had mixed feelings about the initiative. She liked the idea of having a specialised group to handle threats, but she didn’t like Tony being a part of it in case he got hurt because he apparently had the self-preservation skills of a lemming.
It was apparently the wrong answer, nothing Schmidt could work with and his enhanced anger led to him using his fists instead of his words, just like any other bully; it was hard to respect that kind of a man.
“I’ve got a nuke coming in. It’s gonna blow in less than a minute.” He passed the Verrazano Bridge, thrusting back up and over to reach the missile. “And I know just where to put it.”
“I can do that.” Steve replied even though he wasn’t sure. He barely even knew Stark, and instead of getting time to spend time together and develop their bond, he was getting locked away while the inventor got to go off and help the war effort. It felt wrong.
Dispersing yet another shot with his shield, Steve ran towards him and kicked him in the chest. Then with his foe down, he used the man’s weapon to clear a path to Bucky.
"Tony?" Steve called from the other side of the door. "You alright?" He grabbed the doorknob and slowly opened the door, preparing himself in case he was told to not come in. But since he didn't say anything, Steve walked into the room. He saw Tony on the messy floor, as usual, but he was holding his right hand and pressing it to his chest, but since Tony had his back to Steve he couldn't get a good look at what was going on. "You okay?" He repeated.
Tony pushed the black glove on his right hand down so he could see the watch on his wrist. "Eight? I didn't know it was getting that late." He shrugged. "Oh well."
Before Tony could even finish admitting how he felt, Steve smashed his lips into his. Both of their faces turned a bright red during the kiss. This was it. This was what they both wanted for a while and now they finally had it.
"Where's Clint? I don't think I've ever seen you two apart," Steve said jokingly with a smile on his face when he started to walk next to him.
There was a small shuffling underneath the junk all over his floor. Tony had his face leaning on the palm of his left hand that was sitting on his knee, watching the small robot pulling itself out of the trash on the floor. The robot was only about nine inches tall, had two wheels to get around, two arms, and a head with small glowing blue eyes.
"How long do you think you'll be gone?" Steve asked Tony the following morning as he was adjusting his boyfriend's black blazer.
That day Tony didn't have any classes so he just stayed at the dorm all day while Steve was out doing his own classes. Tony's burn had just finished healing after a month of receiving it, but that still didn't stop him from working on his project this entire time. Since Steve wasn't around during the day, Tony moved the projected out in the living room/kitchen since it was a much bigger space compared to his bedroom. Tony was standing on the couch with JARVIS keeping still on the coffee table that was in front of said couch. JARVIS was the one who was keeping everything in line, and if there was anything wrong with the programming he would tell Tony right away since the last time he didn't  saying anything Tony had a serious injury to his arm.
"Suit yourself," Tony said with a shrug when he opened up his own beer can. "What about you? What's your name?"
"I'm telling you the truth, Tony. Would I honestly lie about something like that, even to you? Although, I'm not so sure why someone as humble as Steve would have a crush on an egotistical maniac such as yourself."
Tony looked down at JARVIS who hid himself behind the TV stand, the last time Howard wanted JARVIS he tried selling him to a collector who would have taken him apart to study him. "It depends. What do you want him for? Are you going to try and sell him again?"
"Okay, should we start this up?" Just after he asked, Steve walked back into their dorm room. Tony turned to face his roommate. "Hey, I thought you'd be home later."
Tony was looking out the window now, he wasn't sure on how he should be feeling about this. Happy, right? He felt the same way towards Steve, probably around the same time that Steve started to have feelings towards him. Well, since he knew for sure that Steve felt the same way towards him he should tell him, right? The thing is, Tony never actually had a real crush before, he always had flings that didn't have any emotions attached to them, but in this type of situation he had to tell Steve.
"Honestly, sir, I've been your friend for four-teen years and you still don't care when I get lost."
"I'm sorry, Tony," Steve whispered before he grabbed his blue jacket that was sitting on the desk then walking out of the dorm room. Leaving Tony sitting on the bed alone, confused and hurt.
After writing this out in my head, I realized it wouldn't have made since unless I made a bit of a time skip.
"You're adorable." Steve pinched his cheek while Tony cast a glare at him. He wouldn't admit that he loved the attention that Steve was giving him. Steve cupped Tony's face in his hands then kissed him again, that had made his face turn into an even brighter red. After slowly pulling away from the kiss, Steve and Tony rested their foreheads against one another's, looking into each others eyes.
Happy was parked in front of the dorms, he was on his cellphone while waiting for Tony to show up. Tony stuffed his backpack in the backseat of Happy's car before getting into the passengers seat with JARVIS sitting on his lap.
Steve then pulled him into a tight hug. A part of him wanted to drop everything so he could go with him Tony, but he knew that he couldn't do that. It was going to be a boring week without Tony or JARVIS around that was for damn sure.
"You won't get one if you keep treating JARVIS like that," Tony said in a groggy voice as he was rubbing his eye. "What're you guys doing here?"
Tony was bad in these type of situations and didn't know what he could at this moment to help make him feel better. He cleared his throat, plopping down on the couch next to Steve, taking off his hologram gloves then tossed them onto the coffee table. He looked at Steve who still had his face covered, He held up his right hand for a bit before awkwardly patting Steve on the back to try and comfort him. It actually made Tony jump when Steve let out a chuckle and removed his hands from his face then looked up at his friend.
Nat was getting everyone off of the subject of what they were talking about earlier so Tony could read the text without anyone bothering him.
The door slowly closed behind Steve which he didn't pay any mind to since he assumed that it was the type of door that closed on its own if left opened too long. After he set the boxes back down, someone came up behind him and jumped onto his back, causing Steve to let out a yelp of surprise. He tried fighting off whoever was attacking him, but they leaped over his back and landed on the old, beat up couch. Steve looked shocked and confused at what just happened.
"What'd I do?" She just glared at him. "What'd Clint do?" She was still glaring at him. "Uh... Okay, what's making you so pissy?" Nat turned around and started walking towards her dorm building, leaving Tony standing there extremely confused. "Y'know, it would be great if you would just tell what's going on instead of just walking off on me," he said after catching up with his friend.
"Where're you going, Rogers?" He heard Tony call from behind him. Turning around, he saw him standing there wearing his red tinted sunglasses with Bruce and three other people who Steve assumed were his friends that he briefly talked about the other night. "You can't walk out on us, we were just about to show you our courtyard."
"What would that be?" Tony grabbed the textbook that was still in his hands and threw it across the room. He felt like Steve wasn't paying attention to him but rather more on the textbook and he wanted to have his full attention. "What was that for?"
"I don't remember, I guess I was pretty hammered." He looked up at the curtains that still weren't closed. "I'll get it!" He practically stormed passed Steve, stood up on the coffee table to close the curtains since he was too short to reach them. The only thing that mattered was that the sunlight was gone. "What are you staring at?" Tony snapped when he realized that Steve was staring at him.
"How's everything looking so far?" Tony asked JARVIS as he was slipping on thin, black gloves onto his hands.
Steve slowly pulled away, looking into Tony's eyes with a smile on his face. "I love you too, Tony."
Also, sorry about taking so long to update! I've been having some writers block, but since I have the best of this story planned out you can expect more updates quickly.
He walked them both up the row to the very back where Tony normally sits. He sat down next to another guy who was wearing glasses, wearing a purple button up shirt and dress pants. Steve sat at the end of the aisle next to Tony.
"Guys, check this out," Nat had told Bruce, Clint, and Thor as they were all standing outside of Tony and Steve's dorm room. She had came over not too long ago to see how things were going with the whole relationship thing, but when she tried knocking on the door nobody had answered, so she had picked the lock and let herself in. Which happened quite often since JARVIS saw her sneaking in and just welcomed her instead of telling Tony or Steve. "I told you it was going to happen. Pay up." She held out her hand to Clint and Thor who slapped twenty dollars in her palm.
Tony showed Steve around the campus a bit before they started heading to class, well, at least Steve had an idea of where his other classes would be located at.
After fifth-teen minutes passed, Tony moved his hand from the bowl with water dripping to the tile floor.
Tony swung his backpack that was now filled with some clothes and other things that he could use to tinker with in case he got bored while staying with his parents for the week. He grabbed his keys from the counter next to the door before leaving his dorm room and his Steve behind. This was going to be tough.
"Well, I won't have to worry about your shenanigans for a whole week. What I am suppose to do with my life in the meantime?"
"Welcome to our courtyard," Tony had announced proudly with a smile on his face. "This is where we meet up to study and stuff."
The three of them turned to face him, his mother standing up from the couch then walked over to him. "Welcome home, sweetie," she greeted before giving him a kiss on the cheek. "How's school going?"
"Company!" JARVIS had shouted so loud that it actually woke both Steve and Tony from their deep sleep. "I love company! Can I get you guys anything?" He asked the group, rolling up to them but couldn't stay still.
"Steve? Wait, our Steve?" She nodded. "Wow, I'm surprised, he's not the person that would upset anyone."
Tony swiped his left arm to the side, flicking his wrist . When the Earth hologram landed on the United States, he held his right arm out, pinched his fingers together and zoomed into the state of New York. He kept zooming in until he found Brooklyn.
Tony moved his hand away from him. "What are you talking about? You're my roommate, I'm kinda forced to be comfortable with you."
"Oh. That." Tony's face turned red but managed to keep it hidden from Steve as he stood up. "Yeah, you're my friend." He looked down at the palm of his hands to distract himself and to keep from looking at Steve. "Oh, hey, looks like the gloves need some minor adjustments. Looks like I'm getting some small blisters from the heat. I'll talk to you tomorrow." That was the best excuse that Tony could come up with to get out of this awkward for him situation.
"I spy with my little eye..." Happy's sentence drifted off as he was trying to find something that would work. "Something... blue."
"I am here to study about the American Educational System," Thor started to explain but looked down at the ground, slowly shaking his head. "So far it is not good."
"Not trying to be." Tony winced, putting his hand on his forehead again. He needed some Motrin. "Be free, JARVIS," Tony said as he opened up the door. JARVIS ran out of the room happily with Tony slowly following behind him. "Argh!" Tony groaned when he saw the pool of sunlight pouring into the living room by the opened curtains. He saw Steve sitting on the couch while reading a textbook, but didn't think anything of it since he honestly couldn't remember a thing from last night besides what Nat told him. "You wanna close those?" He asked his roommate when popping a bottle of Motrin opened.
"You don't touch people you don't feel comfortable with." Another smile appeared on Steve's face when he saw the realization on Tony's face.
This time Tony heard him and turned around to face him, it was clear that he was drunk. "W-what are you doing...doing here?" He slurred before taking a chug of the beer bottle that he was currently holding.
"Oh, yeah. So, you remember that burn I got about a month or so ago?" Steve nodded, how could he forget taking care of Tony like that? That's when he first felt that spark feeling, so he couldn't have forgotten that. "Yeah, this is what caused that burn."
Tony looked down at what he was wearing then back up to his father. "I think I look fine. Lets just get this over with so I can sleep for the rest of the week."
Tony snatched his hand away from his roommate. "It'll be fine, alright? Just need to bandage it up." He turned back around and lightly pushed things around on the floor with his foot. "Should have bandages around here somewhere..."
When Steve walked in through the door past Tony, his hand accidentally brushed against Tony's which caused his face to turn red once again like it kept happening last night. He followed in behind Steve and walked up to the group who was already all there doing their own thing. Bruce was leaning up against the large, old oak tree reading his book, Nat and Clint were sitting on the bench holding hands and giving each other googly, lovely eyes, and Thor was studying his history textbook and doing his homework. Bruce looked up from his book, pushing up his glasses up that were trying to slip off of his face, he was the first one to notice that Steve and Tony finally joined them.
“Comics?” Steve enjoyed comics, but all he’d read since the experiment were the H G Wells books that Stark had left for him.
He frowned up at it for a moment. “Who are you?” He wondered if there was someone watching him from another room; he couldn’t see any cameras but if that man had been telling the truth and it was now 2012, then maybe they could hide them in the walls with some sort of covering to hide the lens but not obscure the view.
He took a moment to compose himself and then used the facilities, including the minty toothpaste. Feeling fresher, he stepped out into the bedroom then looked down at himself. “Mr Jarvis?” he called out hesitantly, unsure if the housekeeper listened to the speakers at all times.
He lost his grip on his shield, but exchanged blows with Schmidt anyway, trying to keep him away from his weapon. Wrapping his arms around the man’s torso, he kicked against a metal strut, pushing them backwards; Schmidt lost his balance and they rolled over the glowing, blue core in the middle of the room.
Bruce transferred the cube into a cylinder and handed it over to Thor, who grasped one end and held the other out to Loki.
“We’ll do that later.” The doctor assured her in a calm tone as he quickly herded her back out. “I’m just going to send him back to his room for now.”
That was interesting, Tony mused as he landed long enough to pick off the rest of his stragglers with his repulsors. Did the sceptre lose effect if it was away from those it had brainwashed for too long?
Natasha had controlled calm enforced on her top layers of emotion, but Steve could only see what she allowed him to, so he had no glimpse of the nerves that had to be supressed under that. “You want to think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?” She suggested, and Steve could feel her encouragement from Bruce’s end as she encouraged him to leave.
Taking chase again, Steve threw himself after the odd water vehicle trusting the changes that Erskine had told him about in his quest to stop the man from escaping. It really wasn’t fast and Steve had little trouble pulling him out and throwing him back onto dry land.
Tony scoffed, opening the folder as he headed over to his desk. “The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought… and I didn’t even qualify.”
Shit. “JARVIS, put everything we got into the thrusters!” He commanded as he fired at several more aliens, trying to clear enough space to take off without them hanging onto him.
Tony hated to admit it, but Fury had a point. Sometimes, Tony couldn’t get a house visit from a doctor without the press wondering what was going on; the kid didn’t need to have the overwhelming fuss of the paparazzi focussed on him while he was adjusting to everything.
“Dum Dum? Hold this position.” Steve gave his orders quietly, but the man nodded and headed over to the door. The room they were in had a toilet and an old tin bath in, with a drain on the floor that emptied into the tunnels they had just left. There were no windows, and there was only one door. If necessary, the bottleneck would keep him safe.
It ended up being late when Tony got to bed but thankfully, once he eventually staggered out of bed, JARVIS had made the stronger coffee that he didn’t typically have made up unless Tony really insisted. The AI didn’t bother to explain why he was indulging the man, instead flashing up a problem with Tony’s current Iron Man suit.
“But when can I go do something?” Steve asked, his voice growling in irritation as the doctor gazed at the notes he’d been handed. “I joined the army for a reason and now I haven’t even b-been outside for a month.”
“My Dad? He died in 1989. A car crash.” His mom had died in it too; the idiot had probably been speeding on icy roads, but Tony had never read the report on it. Somehow, it still hurt; he was pretty sure he hated the neglectful bastard, but the fact that he’d lost both parents in one day was a pain he hadn’t managed to fully abate yet.
Without even shoving his baggy pants down, he sat on the bathroom floor, beside the toilet with his eyes squeezed shut as he rested his elbows on his knees and hid his face in his hands.
“Yeah. I’ll take you back to the train station on Thursday then I’ve got work to be getting on with.” Howard grinned at them, but the conversation died off as they headed down the small road for another half hour.
Like a child who had been told ‘no’, Loki glowered as he approached him. “How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you?” The sceptre hit the arc reactor, and although Tony could feel a shift in the air, nothing happened. “This usually works.” He twisted his wrists meaningfully, waiting for the armour to deploy.
“Have care how you speak.” Thor objected, straightening up as he glared at the scientist. “Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard and he is my brother.”
Steve shrugged and picked a small stone out the dirt. “I guess. I’m not real sure where else to get it.”
“Levels are holding steady, I think.” Pepper stated when she spotted him, pointing to a steaming mug on the desk. On the table by the sofa, he could see the ice bucket with champagne, but he was never going to reject a cup of coffee.
“So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?” Bruce asked him. “What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?” It was another good question, but Steve didn’t know enough about the history of SHIELD to even begin to guess; they hadn’t been around in the war.
“Hey Sarge!” Bucky’s girl shouted, breaking the moment before Steve managed to say anything. “Are we going dancing?”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest, visibly fighting to keep a straight face. “And now there are two of you for nagging? No. I’ve changed my mind, you can’t stay on my floor anymore. In fact, I think I’ll just hand both of you over to Fury.”
“Understood, sir. I’m close enough to link with the main building.” Tony shot through the air, the water underneath him quickly changing to city as he headed home.
But the anger seeped out as quickly as it had come on.  She’d be ninety one by now, assuming she was still alive; it would be awful if she had been unable to find the happiness of a family in all that time. It was just, Steve kinda longed for a family, for someone to stand by his side while they raised little people, hopefully with fewer troubles than his own Ma had struggled with… He hoped she had been happy after the war, but Steve didn’t suppose there was any way back to live that life with her.
“Work hard.” She replied, before pointing a finger over at the food that was covered over on the table, waiting for them. “So, any chance you’re driving by LaGuardia?” she asked Coulson as she turned and headed towards him, reaching down to snag her shoes from beside the couch.
“You know damn well why.” He growled, throwing off the hand that had landed on his shoulder. “Back off.”
“Schmidt is mentioned in these letters. Apparently he’s been looking for anyone and everyone with unusual abilities, or who survived unexpectedly.” Gabe piped up from his spot on the floor beside Jacques.
Thor pulled the face plate off and Steve leaned over to check he was breathing. Their bond was raw and painful as it had apparently struggled with the vast distance, but the puff of Tony’s breath against his ear was a relief.
Fury scowled fiercely, but his gaze never left the soldier he was trying to calm. “Not now Stark. I’m a little busy.”
Steve felt sick. It wasn’t that he’d missed Bucky, but that Bucky was still in enemy hands… and he couldn’t even tell anyone that he was alive.
“Then let’s get going because they’re moving like the devil.” Falsworth said as he lowered his binoculars.
“He needs to come with us, Stark. Not you.” Fury said, his voice back to its usual calm drawl, but Tony twisted enough to see him glaring.
“Jay? How long do I have to look through this stuff?” he asked as he debate hacking into the more detailed files on Banner’s experiments; it was hard to believe someone with degrees in this crap would actually think the whole gamma-rays thing was a good idea… but he supposed that he knew better than anyone how hard it was to stop and think things through rationally when you were on a roll.
“Right.” Tony walked passed him, refusing to accept any comfort for something that undeniably felt like his fault, because there had to have been another way. “I’ve heard that before.”
“She reminds me of Ma Barnes, Bucky’s mom.” They had the same smile, and the same demeanour that encouraged confidence.
“Socks and shoes too.” Someone said, and Steve took the chance to crouch down and breathe without everyone staring. It kind of helped.
He nodded as the ramp pulled up and Natasha took off. “He runs a spy organisation. And this -” he waved a hand at Steve’s whole body. “- isn’t exactly subtle.”
"C'mon, guys, I think Steve and Tony want some alone time," Nat told them with a smile on her face then laughed as she walked towards the door with everyone else following behind her. They all said their goodbyes before they left.
She paused for a moment trying to process what Steve just said. "Beg pardon?" Was all that she could finally say to that.
"I like JARIVS, I think it's amazing that you build him when you were just five years old. Have you built anything else like him since then?"
Not long after Steve had left that night from having an encounter with the drunken Tony he had passed out from how much alcohol he had consumed that night. Steve had returned to their dorm room about an hour and a half after the whole thing to find Tony sleeping in his bed, to be nice, he put a glass of water on Tony's nightstand to hopefully help with his hangover in the morning. He had went to Thor's dorm room to stay for the while and couldn't help but spill the entire thing to him since he was the only one who was available to talk to. Thor gave him the best advice that he could, mostly just listening to Steve's story without any judgment. None of the people in their group was judgmental, unless someone was being stupid, that's when they would be judgmental. Other than that they were all chill with everyone else's personal lives.
