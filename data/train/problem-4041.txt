Dean let out a sudden sigh like an airbrake, like some tension that had been building up had finally fractured and wore away. He relaxed on the bed, going a little slack, eyes still focused on Castiel. He was cute like this, soft and calm.
Cas just hadn’t expected this. For all Dean flirted, he would reward Cas behind closed doors, beg forgiveness and Cas would give it to him, because it was true that Dean would not go home with them, that it was Castiel he preferred, that he chose, time and time again.
“Then, if you want to change something about what we’ve been doing, then we’ll have the time to change things,” Cas said. “We’ll find something that works for you. For us.” He was confident in them, pressing a tender kiss to the back of Dean’s neck.
Between the two of them, Cas has always been the worst texter. Loves sending emojis, but getting him to start conversation of his own volition? Forget it. Cas being an angel can only go so far as an excuse he knows
“Fine,
It shouldn’t work, but it does – there is
“What made you think we were together?” he asked her, unable to cross that point in the conversation and move on.
too soon.” And Cas, thankfully, knew enough about Dean and humanity to let the words settle where they fell.
Dean couldn’t hold Cas’s gaze for long. He looked down at the water in the sink, at the soap clinging to his arms. He didn’t understand what Cas was driving at, and his confusion made his skin go hot, made him forget how to breathe.
John looked uncomfortable but didn’t remark on it.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” she said. “I don’t know much about the situation but…Sam seems to oscillate between contentment and despair. I couldn’t describe the way he feels. And Adam, wherever he is, he’s hurting terribly.”
“Yes,” Cas said, clearing his throat. The realization sunk heavily in his stomach as he recognized the lie. “Urban legends.”
“Adam,
on the till counter. “Okay, so this guy just, uh…he just kind of assumes that you already know some stuff, you know? He’s actually kind of funny but…I’m kinda thrown about some of the terminology. I figured getting you to explain it to me would be easier than…going to the friggin’ library like I’m some virgin.”
There have also been countless conversations shared around this table. Cas can’t help but be affectionate of the place.
He found Cas sitting in the kitchen, a John-free-zone most days of the week, reading through his horoscope from the town paper he always picked up from the market.
Cas for quiet for a moment. Then he rolled his head skywards, understanding Dean easily as ever. “If I had to pick a time,” he said, “I’d probably choose … Purgatory.”
“We don’t,” Cas said firmly. Dean just laughed, bitter.
“Hello Dean,” he offered.
“Sacrifice yourself?” Dean asked, concern tense in his voice. Castiel felt a flash of irritation.
But, as far as strategies went, this one hadn’t been sustainable. It wore on Dean in unexpected ways, and Dean doesn’t want to think about how it might’ve hurt Cas. Cas hasn’t complained, but Dean feels guilty as hell about it regardless. He finally broke down to tell Sam about them last night.
“Damn it, Bobby,” Dean seethed. “You sent Sam off on a hunt?” It was a brisk evening outside, but colder in Nome where Castiel had flown from. Out of sentimentality, curiosity, and a sense of lonesomeness Castiel had dropped into Bobby’s living room unannounced.
But Dean couldn’t help but take the confession ... not
Cas had never been able to ease Dean’s never-ending guilt, and he couldn’t do this. Even
“Sorry,” Dean said quietly. Cas felt a flash of guilt.
“Last time we had dealings with you, me and my daughter nearly were
“I agree,” Cas pipes up. “This sounds like more demon omens.”
“Sorry,” he said, pulse sounding impossibly fast against his palm. He was drenched in sweat. He dipped his head between his legs, closing his eyes. The dark dipped and swayed. “Sorry—”
“I’m sorry,” Cas said quietly when Dean returned. “I never should have called you.”
“What are you talking about, Cas?” Dean laughed, leaning in to press his shoulder against Cas’s. He raised an eyebrow, smiling dazzlingly. “I smoke, I drink, I covet. I’m pretty much ten for ten for the Commandments.”
“You could,” Cas said, clearing his throat, trying to be subtle, then losing all nerve. “If you wanted to…” Dean was looking at him with something soft and amused in his eyes.
“No, I’m fine.” Cas hardly looks up from his computer.
“What is it?” Castiel asked, appearing in Bobby’s living room, hoping his irritation came across. He wasn’t a dog to be whistled for at Dean’s whim.
“I thought, you know, you were settling and if I just . . . I didn’t
He’d stopped putting product in his hair, letting it fall against his forehead in wisps. His stubble was getting darker by the day and not longer after Texas he’d lost his coat. Really, it had been an inelegant reason as any for Cas to ditch it—he’d gotten it dirty one too many times and most dry cleaners didn’t exist anymore. Still, ruthlessly sentimental, Dean had stuffed it in the Impala’s trunk. Maybe Cas was ready to let go of that part of himself, but Dean wasn’t.
Cas sparks the cars alive with some remnants of his Grace, saving Dean the trouble of hotwiring them – shit that gets harder to do with each resurrection. The two of them send the civilians off without so much as a pat on the ass.
And Cas realized at once what Dean meant by this being frightening. The concept of Dean dying was ... Cas couldn’t let that happen. But that was the business they were in.
“Well, I’m relieved to hear that,” Naomi said. She had been especially cruel to Anna when Anna had left, or rather, when Anna had returned the first time. Her eyes were cold and clear on Castiel. “Daphne is a wonderful woman.”
“I never…I didn’t actually believe that I’d be the one to win against Lucifer,” Adam said. “It’s just…
Dean leaned against his vehicle, looking over the empty street. “I just don’t wanna do this on my own, Cas,” he said, voice cracking.
“We gave him a ride,” Sam explained, looking a little amused.
“I know how much your relationship to your brother matters to you,” Cas speaks up, and Dean’s brain short-circuits, pulse ratcheting, because he has no idea what the hell Cas is driving at. And then Cas says, “But I’d rather
“I said we, I said we’d figure out what to do with the Empty,” Dean said, surprised that Sam had somehow skipped over the obvious.
“Hey, we can do other things,” Dean insisted, feeling relieved. He added, because he didn’t want her to think about giving him a handjob or anything,
None of them had seemed all that invested in love.
him like this. What Dad had said ... clearly, he thought Cas was gay and, when Dean defended him, John had rounded to accuse Dean, too.
“I mean,” Sam said prissily. “About … you two.” Dean never should’ve told him.
Dean mumbled, sounding totally thrown off-guard and, without a doubt, aroused. “Just like that, Cas.”
“Can you do that?” not-Jesse asked. The girl rolled her eyes.
Within the minute, Cas delivered a whole ass person, nearly pitching over. “This is Donnie Finnerman,” Cas got out, and Dean helped Donnie into a chair, and let Cas take his, standing awkwardly. “Raphael’s vessel.”
So, Cas returned to his old life. Go to work, work, go home, study. Class time gave him some reprieve, something to focus on other than the smallness of his own life. One of his classes was currently revisiting entangled particles—a phenomenon Einstein had just about ridiculed in a thought experiment years before it had been demonstrated.
There had been a time when Castiel had been freshly shunned that he’d been living on the streets. There had been a woman who’d invited Castiel into her home, cared for his injuries. It had been kind of her, brave even, and she had seemed to like Castiel. But, after all had been said and done, nothing had happened. She’d been kind to Castiel, and he’d eventually moved on. There was a chance it had also just been an incorrect assumption in his part. He’d still been reeling from his excommunication, and it had taken him many more years to become used to the fact that he actually was gay.
, “a su casa.” The family buys it, too.
d’you take me for?” He felt angry, offended.
“So, you didn’t,” Dean said, because it’d seemed to him that Cas had heard his prayers and zapped himself to give Dean a piece of his mind. “Couldn’t hear me—”
,” Sam spoke up. “That’s how
“And we will,” Dean said, clearing his throat. “But…we gotta think about what’ll happen in the meantime. You don’t have to just…do
“I think we’ve told enough people.” Especially after John Winchester.
And this argument, the chance to show up Cas in front of everybody, was clearly what he’d actually been hoping for.
There was something else underlying it all, as Cas ran the pad of his thumb across Dean’s skin, like he was holding something that needed a gentle touch. The burr of his voice was so familiar and calming, inviting.
“You’ve taken good care of her,” he noted.
Cas. I don’t…I don’t know how to do this, alright? I’ve never…had a friend before. Don’t think I could handle losing one,” he admitted. He meant to his lifestyle.
“That works,” Jo smiled. She walked Castiel up the front steps. It was a small house, with an uneven level of care put into it. The paint of the fence outside as well as the wooden boards comprising the porch was cracking, fraying, leaving little flecks of white and blue dotting the yard. There was also little work put into the garden, such things were difficult to maintain. It might have been cared for, once.
He carried on massaging Dean’s muscles, going up to his neck and working his way down Dean’s sides, back to the small of his back, to the sheen of sweat starting to shine there beneath the light reaching in from outside past the curtains. Cas’s breathing was heavier than he’d expected it to be, for such a simple act, and he was shamelessly aroused just from watching Dean’s back muscles ripple as he stretched and shifted, and listening to Dean’s small, choked-off sounds of pleasure as he idly fondled himself.
“Pucker up, lover boy,” Ellen prompted, chuckling dryly to herself though it was clear she was distressed.
is how you hold a gun,” Dean went on, pressing the butt against the meat where his shoulder met his chest. “So you can brace yourself for the kickback.” Dean was doing a pretty good job instructing Cas on the art of war, even while Cas was bristling in annoyance the entire time.
“Hell yeah,” Johnny agreed, grinning at Anna broadly.
“Okay, humour me,” Dean said because Cas was fighting this too much. “Say your—smiting—abilities…cut out mid-fight. Sure would be nice to exercise your Second Amendment right, huh?” Cas gave Dean a hard look. “Alright, alright,” Dean grumbled. “It’s just
“Might be the Men of Letters know something about summoning them,” Bobby suggested. Dean was skeptical. Still, he slid over Bobby’s plate and took a bite of his own sandwich.
“Your brother will handle this.”
Cas snapped his fingers and the lights in the kitchen came on. Dean winced. “Thanks,” he muttered, finding the cutlery drawer and grabbing a fork. “Sure you should be wasting your juice like that?” Truth be told, Dean wasn’t completely well-versed on the logistics of Grace, but he figured it’d be like saving water. Castiel didn’t reply and Dean grumbled to himself and finished his pie before heading to the bathroom to clean up.
The startled noise Cas lets out moves into breathless pleasure, as Dean leans his back into this, letting his mouth give, saliva pool on his tongue. Dean’s probably been in this position more times than Cas has been on the other end.
He feels warm all over, and Cas, who runs hot as an angel, doesn’t help, leaving Dean breathless and sweating under, next to, him – joy and exertion fizzing through Dean’s veins like carbonation. He lets himself start to understand that he has Cas, now. That Cas already had him, for a very long time.
“Then, what, drive up to Donnie again?”
But he likes to think that maybe – somewhere, in the ten plus years they’ve known each other, Dean’s changed, in
, Cas.”
Eyes watering, Cas argued, “Even if it was Heaven’s design to raise you from Hell, it was Heaven’s design that placed you there as well. When I raised you, it wasn’t for your benefit, Dean.”
“It could’ve gone worse,” Dean repeated. “But, it’s not like my dad’s wrong – either. You and me, we’re better hunters together. But we’re – we’re
“Uh, him and Jack are off doing some angelic breathing exercises in the basement or somethin’.” Dean could almost feel John’s eyes on him from where they had flickered up from his plate to view and review Dean’s response.
Dean ended his call with Bobby with a snap of his cellphone.
“I would…” Castiel said numbly. “I’d like to finish my education first.”
He’s just turned on enough to walk uncomfortably, but not enough to be able to do anything else. He honestly hadn’t thought that far.
Dean replied. John was quiet for a moment. “Jesus
If anything it would be insulting if Dean tried pretending that it didn’t mean anything at all ... though he was still having issues actually bringing it up again.
“Yes,” he said, glancing down at himself.
And as he waited for his silent misgivings to go away, to let serenity take him and shut his faulty brain off, it never happened. And then the novelty of paradise faded, too. How often can you swish peace around in your mouth until the mint loses its sting?
Right. God. “Well,” Dean said, swallowing. “Guess you angels were always suckers for all of God’s creatures, huh.”
“I like it,” Castiel had confessed, running his hand along the truck Bobby had gifted him.
“Cas, I…” Dean muttered, looking awkward. Castiel knew how it sounded. In the past he would’ve rephrased, concerned about what others would say, what Dean would say, but he didn’t care anymore.
Dean emerged from the bathroom, wearing a loose sweater over his sleeping clothes that looked comfortable, if a bit warm, necklace dangling over his collar. “D’you,” Dean started, then cleared his throat. “D’you wanna watch anything?” Cas considered.
The cake Jody has prepared is chocolate, and almost unbearably rich with cocoa and raspberry jam. The sadness Cas felt is still there, but it’s warmer now, and he feels less distant, more connected to the present moment.
Dean’s hands reached to cup Cas’s jaw, thumbs resting against his cheeks. Dean loved him. Cas had on one hand known this . . . Dean’s capacity to love was huge, a larger reservoir than Cas had ever seen in another person, grander than all of Cas’s family combined. But it was different to have Dean admit to it.
,” is all he can think to say. He means it so much.
to do something,
“Yeah, whatever,” Dean says. “You ever think about using one of those?”
“Dude, I want us to, I want you to forget I ever – but you can’t. I get it.”
“I will observe the Men of Letters alone,” Castiel said, tiring. “Tell me their location, and I will work from there.” Dealing with Bobby and Dean’s orders was one thing, dealing with either of them was another.
“Yeah, maybe you should,” he said breathlessly. Rhonda had introduced Dean to a few other things that day, namely how it was like to pack with something you could play with. The mindfuck alone of her fondling a dick through the fabric was probably half of what got him off. The concept of Cas wearing something similar was…weird, but Dean’s brain kept circling back to it like a scratched record that had looped.
knows that.
She’s talking about something else now. It’s almost like she doesn’t want to linger over the fact that Castiel died, even though it clearly affected her. Still, Cas will go where Claire steers.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, smiling. Dean could tell Cas was driving somewhere, and the destination is a lot less intimidating than Dean had thought it would be.
“I screwed up, Cas,” Dean said, tears making his voice muddy. “I know.” He put his head in his hands. In 2014, he’d told himself to say yes to Michael, said that Michael wouldn’t respond later down the road. Well, the train had left the station now too. There was no way out of this anymore. No way out of any of it.
, Cas walk into the room.
Dean laughed, feeling so damn apologetic. “Love you. I’ve loved you ever since you screwed me over with Crowley and got yourself killed.” He felt so defeated, so low. He leaned his head back against the headrest, scalp starting to pound again. “I probably loved you ever since you pulled me out of Hell.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean said. “You and mom – you tellin’ me, knowing how things would shake out, that you wouldn’t still go after her?” Dean’s voice was suddenly incredibly tight. But fuck if he was going to get teary-eyed in front of his father.
They evict the demon, save the day, and he says nothing. They spend hours side by side, almost a full day on the road, altogether. They waste a night at another motel, Cas seated at the table as Dean tries to not have nightmares in a lone Queen bed.
what’s right, Cas. You’re here, aren’t you?”
“We’re walking, lady,” Dean shot back. “That against your religion?”
“You’re saved?” Cas asked.
way, or a brother way, or,” Dean limps on, stupidly, because he has to say
John and Sam weren’t suddenly buddy-buddy, but things were easier, a little lighter, for them and even for Dean.
“Bobby’s got a contact out here that has a cabin,” Dean grinned over at Castiel, leaning into Cas’s side of the car to nudge their shoulders together. “Key beneath the doormat kind of deal.”
“Jesus,” Dean found himself laughing, though Cas’s voice was intense with something Dean was afraid to ask about. Cas really didn’t bury the lede. “TMI, man.”
“Alright, Dad,” he called out, voice hard. “Cut it out.”
“So, she’s some Bible freak?” Dean asked.
sex from you.” Which is
“If you…if you need to go on a break, or if you need the day off…I’m sorry I brought this up.” Unsteadily, Castiel regained his footing. He had always kept his head down, done the tasks assigned, but it hadn’t been enough. He’d schooled himself, gathered up any emotions and sublimated them into other things, but with Dean. With Dean he hadn’t been able to look away. He’d forgotten himself. He’d forgotten everything.
“It actually took me another three years to side with her,” he said. “Then, our family stopped paying for my tuition and…now I’m a number of years in debt.” To afford school, Castiel had to split his time between work and classes, ensuring that he could rarely go over three classes a semester. Not to mention the year Cas had taken off to re-establish himself and the credits he’d lost changing schools…
Dean doesn’t go to the kitchen, he can’t risk seeing Sam. He grabs a shower, half-heartedly jerks off. Afterwards, he texts Sam Greek food sounds good, then spends the time between that and dinner hiding from Cas in the library, aimlessly researching.
“Listen, idjit, I can damn well take care of myself,” Bobby blustered, eyes burning cold. “You mind your own business and I’ll mind mine.” He added, for good measure, “Dumbass.” Dean didn’t know whether he should laugh or throw a fist.
together?” John asked, eyes widening.
“I will,” Sam promised.
“Demons,” she repeated, eyes widening. “You’re right,” she said, nodding her head slowly. “You
Dean’s mouth opened but he couldn’t get the words out. He didn’t know what to say. He wasn’t even sure he’d heard Cas properly. But Cas just kept staring at Dean head on, a little irked muscle in his jaw flickering. “Say that again?” Dean asked, voice coming out hoarse and unsteady. Cas looked away.
The confusion must have shown on Cas’s face because Dean hastened to continue, “I’m on hormones, and I flatten my chest but I’m, uh…not really the average guy. You read me?” Cas couldn’t help but look Dean over, to try to determine if Dean was joking. But Dean looked serious.
“Sorry to break it to you, Cas,” he said, anger making him brutal. “But things don’t get better. So, get used to this. Get used to sitting down here in the dirt with the rest of us.” Cas nodded.
“Wow,” Dean said, closing the trunk and leaning against his car. He considered Castiel with what seemed like curiosity, but without judgement. “Really. What do you do for fun?” This was a question Cas could answer, though he was surprised that Dean was interested.
“Cas, you know I…I’m not trying to blow you off,” he said. “You’re a cool guy. I mean, you’re a dork but.
“That’s cost-effective,” Dean said, drumming his hand along the steering wheel. Cas supposed Dean would be a better judge than him. “They didn’t know that DNA had gotten all over those parts. That’s why the ghosts are able to get around town. And also, if you’ve noticed an uptick in vandalism, uh…don’t report me, alright?”
. But, I
“Well sorry, but no dice,” Dean said. “You’re stuck with me.” He tried not to sound bitter.
if he’d let John talk down about the people he cared about. In his own home, as a fully-fledged tax-evading adult.
“Okay,” Cas repeated, dumbly.
“Hey, is this like—spoiler stuff for Carver Edlund’s new work?” the false Dean asked. They’d ceased their show and started listening in on Castiel and Sam’s conversation. The flashlight Castiel had been politely carrying for Sam caught on a familiar name on one of the gravestones. Letitia Gore. “Because it sounds kind of—” the man went on, “insane.”
Dean had no idea how he had ever believed that Mary had known how to cook. It wasn’t like Dean was an amazing chef or anything, but he liked things to taste good and living here, really getting comfortable and building a home, had helped him build his repertoire of skills.
“Hell yeah,” he crowed. “You’re my partner in crime, now.”
It was too quiet. Dean could see Cas’s shape in his peripheral vision, the familiar tan of his trench. Dean closed his eyes, pressing his hands together.
“For a long time, I didn’t,” Castiel murmured, moving carefully to take the other side next to Dean. “I…assumed everyone felt the way I did and…sexual repression was common in our church regardless of orientation.”
“Whatever’s happening, it’s only going to get worse. And after what happened in Boston, people have to organize,” she explained. “I was working on a farm in Idaho when people started going nuts. Managed to find this place but I was travelling alone at first for awhile. It’s shit. You’re lucky you have your partner. We need people. Shutting everyone out and starving because of paranoia won’t work. We need to take the risk.”
Bobby?”
“This wasn’t about you, Cas,” Dean said. “It was my crap. Don’t put up with this.”
at rocket science.” It was a large room, but Dean was essentially naked beneath his makeshift robe. Cas seemed totally unbothered, and he carried with him the pungent smell of weed.
If Heaven became empty outside of the power of souls, then it was quite likely that Castiel would increasingly lose access to power, and his abilities altogether, over time. Perhaps even his Grace, though the thought was almost painful to consider.
She took the initiative and pushed him into the backseat of the Impala, and he leaned back, grinning, as she took off her jacket and fitted herself against him. It was tight, but nothing Dean hadn’t done before and wouldn’t do again. She got on top of him, nipping his mouth, teasing and hot, and scrambling closer.
get a job,” Cas says wearily.
“Zachariah is a dick,” Adam came to realize, collapsing on one of the beds.
“Good thing Sam’s out then,” Dean spat, voice guttural with disgust and poorly concealed rage. He was angry, angrier than Cas had seen him in awhile, cold with fury.
Sam had helped at first, silently remorseful, lips twitching with the urge to apologize and pathologize, but Dean had sent him off so that he could get lost in the mindless mechanics of washing dishes without talking about what had just happened.
And Dean can admit that he’s probably right, but he could at least do Dean the decency of leaving it the hell alone.
“Because you have shit taste in men,” Dean said, almost folding over where he stood, breath coming out in one long sigh, setting down his bottles. Cas smiled a little at that, even though it wasn’t that much of a joke. Maybe it was funny because it’s true. Observational humour.
Truth be told, Dean hadn’t had the concentration to pay too close attention during the case debrief, mind scattered from the night before, unsure whether he was looking at Cas more than usual, watching more than he should, or if he was too obviously trying to avoid Cas’s eye.
“I don’t know,” Jody says. “Think she’ll talk to me about it? She’s not the easiest kid. But she’s worth it. That’s all I wanted to say. Think about it,” she requests. “Alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The Colt had demonstrated its uselessness against Lucifer, and Castiel could see that it was tearing Dean up inside in frustration and rage. Dean had barely managed to put a bullet in Lucifer before the devil realized that Sam wasn’t with them and lost total interest. Even then, they had all barely escaped with their lives.
“On occasion,” Cas replied, level, even while Dean had opened his mouth to argue and defend him. Dean snapped his mouth shut, raising an eyebrow at Castiel. True, Cas had never drunk enough to become drunk, and the challenge was clear in Bobby’s voice. But Cas could rise to the challenge when required.
“I guess we all are,” she said, seeming to accept his answer, maybe not even that interested in it. “I’m Ellie, by the way.” She held out her hand and he shook it, it was firm and confident.
“Yeah, we’ll see if you like it,” Dean said, sounding skeptical. Castiel didn’t understand why Dean would recommend him something he didn’t personally enjoy, but he also didn’t want to tell Dean to stop. If it meant going to a movie with Dean, he didn’t care.
“So, why not take it on faith that he does?” Anna summarized. Castiel nodded. Then, she argued, “Because it’s easier not to.” That caught Castiel off-guard.
,” Dean said quickly. “I don’t. But, I can’t see how I don’t screw you over eventually anyhow. Not with – not with other people, but with the work we do. I could’ve died on that ghoul hunt.
Dean honestly hadn’t thought about it in years. He’d been doing a ... he’d been doing a good job with that. But the way John had regarded the concept ... well. It soured in Dean’s gut.
But, Cas was the best man Dean knew; if he was soft it was because he
Dean sighed.
“C’mon, what about your family?” Dean asked, turning slightly on his side to look at Castiel.
“Uh, not that I could tell,” Dean said. Pretty sure someone would’ve mentioned it, even if the virus was probably a more pressing issue. Castiel let out a sigh of relief.
“Dean,” Cas speaks up, then, and his voice cuts in like sharp static on a midnight radio lull. “Are you –”
Dean didn’t take it personally – his dad could be pretty prickly, and while John hadn’t been overly tough on Cas, Cas wouldn’t be the first person not to like the man on principal.
But, all things considered, it was a bit late for that anyway. So, Dean buried it in the yard and focused on things that he could work with.
It sort of served as a gesture of peace. He’d been pissed beyond belief when Cas had overdosed, Cas had been pissed beyond belief when Dean had said yes, and neither transgression had really done much harm to anyone else but themselves if you wanted to step back and look at it the way God would. Since then, Cas had sort of calmed down, and so had Dean. That all said, he’d wanted Cas to know that humanity wasn’t just—garbage. “Take it, you don’t have to listen to it.”
The rest of the household was already asleep; Bobby walked to his bedroom almost immediately after dinner. After some vain attempts to inebriate Castiel, Ellen and Jo had turned in to share the guestroom. It was just Dean and Castiel now, Dean putting off taking the couch, and Castiel left waiting. However, any interest Dean should have had for sleep was spent observing their prize.
Dean quietly hauled their bags, kept in the Impala’s trunk, up to their room and the moment they had closed the door behind them, Dean dropped the bags on the floor and moved in to kiss Cas.
“All the more reason to care about the state of my eternal soul,” he pointed out.
“I’m trying to find purpose, I suppose,” Castiel replied, turning the paperback over in his hands. “Living without faith. You, humans, have always struggled for purpose, for meaning. As angels, we thought we were closer to that purpose than anyone else…that that was our reward. But we were wrong.
Cas ducks, making like he wants to go down on Dean, but Dean is helplessly sentimental, and fucked up in the head and lonely, and the concept of Cas’s face being even a few feet away from his own right now is too much of a distance.
“You’ve done worse than this,” Cas speaks up, forgetting to hold his cards and feeling somewhat defensive of Claire and of himself.
“Well, alright,” Cas said. “What kind of games does one play when they’re sleeping in a car to avoid getting in a sleep deprivation induced car accident or killed by the United States military?” Dean cracked a grin to himself. He shifted to toss his feet up on the dashboard, trying to get a little more comfortable.
“Come on in, Naomi,” Balthazar greeted, gesturing towards the table between them. “We could benefit from a feminine touch.” Castiel looked her over. She was nearly ten years older than him and growing up he’d had great admiration for her. She always led group prayer and while in the Church she couldn’t exactly replace Michael or Raphael, she seemed to have risen as far as she possibly could have.
Just then a man stepped up next to her. “You know, it’s rude to hit on someone when they’re working,” he said. Then his eyes flashed black and the waitress jumped, stepping away from the table. “Hello Dean.” Speak of devils and so they appeared.
In the past, women Dean was with sometimes jumped the gun a bit in their eagerness to hook themselves onto Dean, or to get Dean hooked onto them, but it was never honest. Charlie, though, always used to say ‘
“Hang on, Asa?” Dean asked, recognizing the unique name. “Is that—is your last name Fox?” The guy called Asa clapped a look of recognition on him and Dean felt a rush of relief. “Ellen’d always talk about you down at the Roadhouse. I’m Dean Winchester!”
“Then why don’t you?” Cas asked softly.
Dean finished rolling down the windows and the air was soft and warm as Dean pulled out onto the road. He promised Cas he would take him out for dinner, burgers, and he let Castiel pick the music. Castiel dozed on and off in the passenger seat, listening to Led Zeppelin and the sound of Dean living alongside him.
“I was never going to use this degree,” Cas said honestly. “I just wanted to understand a little more about the world. And I wanted to achieve something for myself, independent of my family.” He drank in the sight of Dean, unashamed. “Those things are true of my relationship with you, as well.”
Castiel felt like he was walking into another world as he stepped into Bobby’s home. It seemed both cluttered and empty somehow – full of books, but not much else. Bobby had clearly lived here for a long time, but there were no picture frames, or anything that Cas had come to expect from normal households. Then again, given Bobby’s apparent familiarity with the world of hunting, this likely wasn’t a normal household.
Dean had heard Cas approach, the creak of his shoes soft on the floor. Dean could appreciate him not sneaking anymore, he was getting too old for the jump scares. He glanced over at Cas, acknowledging him with a short nod.
an idjit,” Bobby grumped. “But the fact that you’re after the blades and not the Colt should already be a big enough difference that you stayin’ there instead of my dingy house won’t matter in the scheme of things.” Dean’s mouth went dry, taking the eggs of the heat, browned and steaming but not burnt.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Sounds good to me. Although…” he cleared his throat. “Can’t help feeling like. We got a vessel right here.” He jabbed a thumb at his center. “And we, uh…already screwed over Donnie, if we’re needing to chase down his sister. I feel like…we could save on gas money if we just use what we got.” He met her gaze.
He’s not sweating, not like Dean is, but he’s gone pink too, like he couldn’t help it. And he looks so damn handsome, and hopeful, and – and affectionate. Dean loves him.
“If I’m not back soon, ask about Michael,” he said, reaching over to put a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“Want me to tell you how you handle that?” Dean offered. “Or keep things spoiler-free?” He took a swig from his drink. This was the first time they’d truly spoken about the subject—their future together.
He hates to assume when it comes to Claire, but perhaps that’s his own fault – that he doesn’t feel familiar enough with her to make assumptions.
Castiel realizes – that for as little as they’ve discussed - Dean
“Charlie’s okay,” Anna said. “We broke up years ago. We were young—sometimes things just don’t work out. We still keep in touch.” Cas nodded. “Are you wondering why I’m with a man now and not with the Church?” Anna asked with a quirk to her lips. Cas couldn’t lie. Of course he was wondering.
“Listen,” Dean spoke up to Cas. “There’s no driving in this weather.” He hadn’t sprung for winter tires yet and snow was starting to settle in, something Dean wasn’t up to risking. He tossed Cas the keys. “Pack up, and I’m gonna check out if there’s any stores open to stock up on food.” Cas nodded and Dean took his leave.
Cas leaned in closer to Dean, voice low, whiskey on his breath. “Dean—the power is out all across central Wisconsin,” he said, barely above a whisper.
“I will,” Castiel promised, turning the photograph over to look at the phone number and address printed on the business card. After these many years, he hadn’t forgotten that information. Hester nodded and she and Inias turned around to go. He watched them leave and held the photograph close to his chest.
After a day on the road, they pulled into a motel parking lot not far from the case Dean’s father had found. Dean suspected it was ghosts and, on their way, he reinstructed Castiel on how to defeat them. He seemed excited to have a partner to hunt with. Digging up graves was apparently quite taxing to do on one’s own. Castiel was looking forward to spending time with Dean as well.
“Well, neither was I,” he said. “But I don’t ... I dunno. More and more recently I ... and I don’t know if it’s just because I’m older, or what, but I just ... think I’m becoming more like him. The way I treated Jack, after you died. Hell, the way I acted after you ...”
save on gas.” Cas blinked at him.
It didn’t matter. Unwilling and unable to force faith into himself, Dean had had to learn to mourn loss in that empty way of atheists. Loss with no promise of justice, of reuniting someday. Dean could envy religious folks for their ability to believe the sweetest lies. Dean had never been luckier to be proven wrong.
“I’ve spoken to her on the phone,” Cas goes on, “but I haven’t seen her since ...”
Cas seemed tired. Older. Like he was shifting into the skin of the man Dean had met in the future. But, there was a kind of…attitude about him that seemed different. Not like the Cas Dean had met in 2008, but not like the guy Dean had seen in 2014 either, at least as far as Dean could tell. It made Dean feel strange, but grateful. He turned away.
“The kind where the Empty gets Cas when it feels like it,” Dean said, taking his plate out of the microwave, hot to the touch though. “Apparently the Empty likes to play with its food.”
Really, what had hurt about this hunt was the spirits. To see these lost souls denied paradise after the brutality in their life had tethered them to the earth, time driving them mad with rage and loneliness. They had been children. When burned, their bones had been so small, delicate like china beneath the floorboards.
“I’m not hungry, Dean,” Cas said after Dean asked him what he wanted off the menu.
“I’ll see you soon, Dean,” he promised.
“It’s been a few years,” Castiel said regretfully. “But she seemed to be doing well. I don’t have much as far as it goes for family, Dean. I have hundreds of siblings, but none of them particularly care for me. Anna is probably the only exception.”
“Oh,” Cassie spoke up. “I thought
Cas considers. It’s difficult to argue her points. It feels harder to think generally. Maybe without his Grace, Cas has become stupider.
“It doesn’t seem as though we’re wrong,” he replied. “Monsters, ghosts, these things are all real.” He of course hadn’t seen evidence until recently, but meeting Dean, seeing what Dean did for a living, was making Castiel re-evaluate his place in the world. “The climate is getting warmer, the ozone layer is depleting. Wars. Disease. Even America isn’t safe from destruction…You could ask anyone on the street if they thought the world is ending, and they’d agree.”
“How should I know?” Dean mumbled. Cas regarded him with a strange expression.
Dean’s happy here, now, over the moon. And Heaven still gives him the heebie-jeebies, he’s in no rush to go back there. But, there’s a lot Dean supposes about what he’s gone through, that chews you up, and makes it hard to live. He doesn’t want to die anymore, but he’s still getting the hang of being alive. It’s tough. And how Dean feels about it changes by the day.
“The shirt stays,” Dean refused firmly, sitting back a little. “I don’t wanna get into it right now,” Dean cleared his throat. Cas listened. “And that’s kind of hard to do with my shirt off.”
you’ve known him for longer.”
Dean doesn’t know what he’d be if not a hunter.
Dean doesn’t know what Sam’s planning to say, but he wishes Sam could stow it. As much as Dean loves Sam, his younger brother’s dickishness is something Dean’s never missed all that much, not even in Heaven.
It had taken Castiel so long to come to feel that way about himself. Dean had been instrumental in that journey. Cas reached around to take Dean’s hand, threading their fingers together. Dean smiled and flexed their hands together.
Castiel was alone in the Gas-N-Sip when Hester and Inias visited. They outnumbered him and bought gas, which they needn’t have bothered with considering they all knew that that was not why they had come. Castiel was working alone, which made the entire experience worse, his body primed for flight or fight to see them. But, he controlled himself and after Inias quietly paid, Hester finally admitted their purpose.
“My hearing should remain unaffected,” Cas said. He turned a concerned eye on Dean. “You should cover your ears.” Dean scoffed.
Dean doesn’t even appear to notice. Or if he does, he’s schooling his reaction so tightly that he’s not even making one.
“So, they might know stuff,” Jo acknowledged. She sounded skeptical, but not in a way that came off as an attack. She wanted to believe him.
Dean woke up with a start, almost jumping. He looked at Castiel with wide eyes, hostile with fear. “You seemed to be having a nightmare,” Cas explained softly, apologetically, in the event that he had misread the situation. He hadn’t.
“Sorry you got me to wake up to,” Dean offered. He tried for a charming smile, which Cas matched even though…it was pretty obvious this was weighing on him. They’d stop Lucifer but…if Dean had said yes when he was supposed to, Cas would never be in this situation. “Being human isn’t
“Awesome,” he said. “Let’s get out of here. I need a month-long shower. Can you zap us back?” Cas opened his mouth, then shut it.
, Cas?” and Cas started picking himself off the bed.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, you’re telling me.” Cas tried not to take it personally. And then Adam did the most bizarre thing. He smiled; a break from his usual sourness.
“I’m not afraid of sleep,” Cas spoke up, earnest, shaking his head. “I just don’t want to waste time.” He looked down at the floor, dissatisfied. “How do you humans live like this?” he muttered. “Eight hours a night—that’s a
“I want…more things now than ever before,” Cas spoke up. Dean didn’t look at him, but he felt the hairs on his arms prickle and raise with the tone, heavy and…desperate, somehow. “Already, I find myself wanting to eat, to sleep, to drink. Considering…physical intimacy.”
“He’s alive,” Cas said firmly. “What about Raphael?” he pressed. She closed her eyes.
my eight hours,” he said, frank. Dean shrugged.
“I would think the underwear is the truth,” Cas decided immediately. “Given your…history.”
Once Cas and Dean had installed a box in the truck bed, there was really no reason for anyone to say that it was inferior to the Impala. In fact, when it came to things such as carting off dead bodies to a secondary location, the truck won, though Dean would likely have an inane counterpoint if Cas brought that up.
he choked out. “Uh, definitely not, I’m uh—” He hated this part right here. Where he had to stop pretending he was cis, give someone the 101 and hope they could both just move past it without things going downhill. He’d been hoping to avoid it tonight; she didn’t have to know, except now she did. He licked his lips, settling back.
, I’m. My name is Charlie.”
Dean asked, words coming out clunky in his mouth. Cas didn’t have the patience for it.
Plus, John seemed to dig the fact that Cas was withholding – rude and just shy of disrespectful. It was possible that it had flown straight over John’s head that Cas didn’t like him, that he’d interpreted Cas’s coldness as ordinary stoicism. Cas’s dislike led to pretty brisk conversations, and John loved efficiency.
“Hush, Joanna Beth,” Ellen said, voice low, comforting but giving no quarter. She stepped over to Crowley, considering him coldly. “Been awhile since I got some action.”
Clearly the boy was young, and Anna was roughly the same age and inarguably good-looking, but Johnny had invited Castiel back, too. He had been interested in Anna, that much was obvious and perhaps not unfair though, if only because Cas thought of her as a sister, not totally understandable. Johnny was at least
And so it came to pass.
so dismissively.
“Guess we gotta walk,” Dean said. “We’ll come back tomorrow.” He shut and locked the doors.
“The truth, for starters,” Dean said, standing up taller. “Because I don’t …” Dean didn’t know what the hell was going on. What was real, what was Chuck. “What happened wasn’t the first time you went AWOL.” Cas flinched because it was the truth. “And after all that, I don’t know what else you’re hiding from me, man.”
?” Dean couldn’t stop. “Tell me – is it
The first thing John had done, back on solid ground, was get himself oriented in the Bunker. Etching out the blanks of his heritage and everything else he’d missed in the years he’d been gone.
, and they will never exist again and I—I know you’re not okay with that. I know you love them.”
“I’m getting bored waiting to figure out what the angels want with me, or what you guys want with me,” Adam explained, youthful and frustrated. “I’m just…tired of this. Whatever this is. If I’m not in, then I want
Cas remembers having drinks with Jo and Ellen the night before they died, downing drink after drink. Claire is so like Jo in some ways. Cas is not an angel anymore, but he probably still has the constitution for this.
Castiel and Dean were quiet as they left the house. They walked over to where Dean’s car was parked on the abandoned street, Castiel too upset to speak. Not much could silence Dean, though. He vibrated with discontent like a candle in a busy room. “So, the honeymoon’s over already?” he burst out with a stressed sigh before Castiel could open his door.
Castiel hadn’t pressed for details, so happy and grateful to be alive with the brothers, to have the slightest opportunity to one day see Jack again. He had never asked why the brothers had died in the first place, how, who died first, nothing.
Dean’s eyes narrowed shrewdly on Cas.
“Bless you,” Castiel offered.
an angel, which maybe wasn’t to say that sex was beyond him, given that Gabriel had been more horny devil than archangel. But then, maybe libido was an archangel thing. Anna, after she’d gotten juiced up again, had never so much as
“I mean about the rings,” Dean said. Jo took off her gloves, setting them to rest in the thin plastic washbasin. She rotated her wrist, the bands catching the light.
what do I do?” Dean seemed to take Bobby’s shocked silence as some kind of victory. All of Dean’s hope for the future had completely vanished into self-loathing.
“I’m fine,” Cas said, which meant things were worse than Dean thought. Dean rolled his eyes and walked over to him, still drying his hair.
“Where you headed?” the woman asked. She was very nice about it all but Dean couldn’t help but wonder if she was interrogating him. But fuck it. He could talk.
Cas blinked. He was ‘into’ Dean, and that was about it. Dean’s eyes narrowed, and his hand trailed up Cas’s hip. “Like, you like it fast, slow? Hot, cold, nine days old?” Now Castiel really didn’t know what he meant. “I’m gonna jerk you off, Cas,” Dean said, and the way he said those words was worthy of blasphemy. But Castiel still had no idea what he was talking about.
He and Cas spent an afternoon setting up the television set Castiel had never bothered to use and sampling the beers, originally out of separate glasses Cas had poured for them, and then as time winded down straight from the bottle, from mouth to mouth. Dean had knocked on Cas’s door at around noon and they had the TV working by two.
Half, if not most, of the pleasure came from Dean’s commentary and reactions and general presence in Cas’s life. “I won’t watch them without you,” Cas said, resolute. Dean hung his head.
Castiel gets an idea, and goes to open the glove compartment, Dean’s gaze clasped back on him, curious and attentive.
Dean grumbled, embarrassed and still upset, but shifted and pulled in closer to Castiel, allowing himself to be brought into a secure hug against Cas’s body.
“S’fine,” Dean grunted, closing his eyes and smiling. Cas could hardly see him. “Can’t keep your hands off me, I get it.” Cas chuckled and Dean stretched his arms, beaming in the darkness. “What’s up, Cas?” Cas still hadn’t retrieved his hand, letting it rest on Dean’s cheek.
Dean didn’t know why he was surprised. The guy had never exactly been the lady’s man, as much as lady’s loved him.
Castiel’s voice rang out in his ear, grasping him by the shoulder and shaking him awake.
“C’mon,” Dean murmured, reaching out to pull Cas along and Cas, thankfully, acquiesced, grabbing onto Dean’s jacket like a kid. It turned out that Cas was an affectionate drunk; Cas put his arms around Dean’s and just about hugged him. It was almost laughable: ex-soldier turned cuddle monster. Cas was completely hammered though, so Dean let it slide.
So, maybe they won.
“Have we?” Cas muttered combatively. “Or did you not just recently announce your identity in a bar?”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed with his brother. His expression was gentle. If he respected Sam’s stance now, Cas couldn’t know, but he was certainly willing to overlook it. “Hey. You call me, okay?”
“I love you, too, Cas,” Dean bites out.
“Did you see that in the future?” Cas asked, and he looked really bothered by it.
She continued to scowl as they walked, seething.
“I don’t want in,” Dean said, or at least he didn’t think he did. “Just some gas.” Asa nodded.
,” behind them to mom and pop, standing together in the kitchen, hands wringing together with concern. It’s been a long time since Dean’s done something like this.
Cas gets to his feet and paces over to Dean, who has to suffocate the urge for flight. Cas is owed that much.
“Not saving yourself for Jesus, right?” Dean asked, hesitating momentarily. Cas was beyond worrying about anything like that. He’d been chaste his entire life, and he could be chaste for the remainder of it. But this didn’t feel like a sin and if it was, and Dean was a sinner, Castiel already intended on following Dean wherever Dean would lead him, peacefully and with no regrets. Still…
Dean found his way back to the Bunker sometime in the evening hours. Sam and Eileen had made dinner together, Sam was very proud about the joint effort, and Dean helped himself to the survivors. Mac ‘n’ cheese wasn’t all that complicated, but Dean didn’t have the heart to be an asshole and he was still kind of shell-shocked from the day.
“That’s what they told me when they raised me,” Adam confessed. “But can they even do that?” he asked, looking to Castiel. “The amount of work that went into setting up your parents, Dean, to have you and Sam. Can I actually fulfill the prophecy?”
“Castiel,” Hester spoke up in greeting.
Some spooky action across space—two quantum particles at arbitrary distance, that seemed to disobey locality. Measure one entangled particle, and not only was it influenced by measurement, but its counterpart was as well, equal and opposite, anywhere. Entwined. Things on the quantum level loved to buck convention, but they still often enough made more sense to Castiel than the brutality and unfairness of the classical, human world.
“Don’t worry about it,” Dean said. There wasn’t too much Cas could do except wash his hands and abide by the five second rule. “Get some sleep. You’ll be better tomorrow.” He gave Cas a reassuring smile.
to believe it at this point. There’s got to be something about Dean that’s worth loving, and it might as well be this.
Cas is not a violent person, but distantly he recognizes the impulse to destroy something.
Things would be easier with Anna taking the lead.
“He’s been doing a lot of reading,” Castiel concluded. He neglected to tell Dean what exactly Sam had been reading, and with that Dean seemed to nearly melt with relief, a soft smile colouring his lips.
,” Dean clarified.
The ghost suddenly wasn’t in front of him, it was pooling within him, writhing inside of him. Cas suddenly couldn’t move his limbs, and he could see John’s expression, taut with horror.
“It ain’t exactly PG, Cas,” he said. Cas laughed. Few things were, with Dean.
Cas hands Miracle’s reins over to Dean. He sticks his hands in his pockets and turns over Dean’s confession in his mind as they walk.
Next time Cas got in the Impala, he sat in the passenger’s side with an air of passive-aggression so strong Dean could’ve choked on it. He gave Dean a glare, a silent but pointed vow that he was never going to sit in the backseat ever again, and Dean almost told him what he and Anna had gotten up to back there years ago, just to spite him, but thought better of it.
Cas misses. He misses having somewhere to direct all of his love, all of his hope. And his hopes have been fulfilled – Jack has succeeded where his father and his father’s father have failed. Cas likes to believe that he played the instrumental role in guiding Jack to be the kind of person, or being, that he is today and technically always and forever given how time works in Heaven.
Castiel thought back to all he had learned these past few years.
“I don’t want to quote Leviticus to you, Dean, but various sources would disagree,” Cas said quietly. He had the passages memorized.
That, at least, draws Dean’s attention.
“Anna is . . .” Cas started to explain, though he didn’t know what to say.
“Got it dry-cleaned,” Dean replied, shifting his position on the bed to get more comfortable. “It’s hanging on the front door.” Cas went to check, pacing nervously in Dean’s peripheral. “No offense but, it was getting kind of ripe.”
They had never been close. Naomi was from a different generation than him, in her mid-to-late thirties, and much more high-ranking in the Church than he was.
“Hmm,” Cas murmured, deciding to let the conversation drop, considering. “The Taylor Swift statement is a lie.”
“Maybe
“I’ll be at St. Peter’s Hospital,” Cas said firmly. “It was good to meet you, Missouri.” She seemed just as bemused as Dean. And with that, Cas zapped himself away again.
“Damn it, okay, we’ll figure it out,” he said. “We’ll fix this.” Castiel nodded. He believed him. He let Dean drive them home.
, Jesus –”
“Crap, I’m sorry, man,” Dean mumbled, disentangling himself from Castiel. He was sweating, obviously stressed, and having difficulties breathing. He sat up and so did Castiel. “Sorry, shit—I didn’t mean to wake you up, I didn’t mean to stay.” His voice was hoarse. “The booze just knocked me out, I—”
“Doesn’t matter. I don’t think Sam wants to talk to me. We made our choices,” he said. He added, speaking soft and low, like he was confessing, “For a long time I didn’t want to talk to him either. I felt like—I felt like he was being selfish. But you know what. Screw it, you know? We only live once.”
“You sure you can make it?” Bobby asked.
“Yeah,” he said, unconvinced. “But it’s not like my dad’s about to win any ‘Father of the Year’ awards. I mean . . .” he cut himself off, worrying his thumb along the loose threads of his jeans. “The shit he got me involved in. The way I had to look after Sam. A kid shouldn’t have – I shouldn’t have had to do all that.” Dean frowned. “Just because I could, doesn’t mean I should’ve had to. And I shouldn’t have to – bend backwards to keep him from finding out about you.”
“Sam?” Dean mused. “When this is over, I’m taking him out for drinks.” His lips pulled into a small, wistful smile. “You’re invited, obviously. Cas, it’s not that I don’t—” he broke off, smile fading. And Castiel could sense it. How wrong Dean felt to move in this world without his brother. But, in its own way, this was about Sam as well. Dean was, even now, protecting his brother.
“I mean,” Dean said, expression uncomfortable. “I got it handled.” He gritted his jaw. “Well . . . if you’re already in the area. What. You spooked?” More from John. “Dad, I’m joking.
“Evidently. It wasn’t.”
Dean hadn’t paid much mind, but it was clear that a lot of this had been taking a toll on Cas. The fact that his angel powers were becoming increasingly limited on how far he could travel, who he could take with him. “You didn’t abandon them, Cas,” Dean said. “I want you to know that.” Whether Cas believed him or not was something else but as far as Dean was concerned, he was telling the truth. Or at least, he hoped he was.
“Ask them,” Castiel replied, winking at someone behind Dean. Instead of kicking Cas’s ass like the situation deserved, Dean heaved Cas upright and was satisfied when Cas went a little green.
Dean doesn’t know if Jack and Amara are still working out the bugs up top, or if they’ve got enough soul or humanity between the two of them to even know how to call problems when they see him.
“Took care of a werewolf up in Michigan,” Dean said with a sigh. “Met up with my dad to take down a huge nest of vampires—where I totally redeemed myself, by the way.” Cas nodded. He would’ve said that Dean had redeemed himself, as far as vampires were concerned, when he and Castiel had taken down a den, but clearly Dean was speaking about his father.
“Dean, get down!” Cas yelled louder, all but tackling Dean to the floor and into glass as the shooting started up again.
got back, man. Can’t you just – stay put long enough for everyone to catch their breath?”
“So what, we try, try again?” Dean asked.
“We have to tell Sam about what the demon said about Rowena,” Cas eventually gives in. When he leans back, surrenders, it doesn’t feel like a triumph. Dean keeps driving.
“I…I think I—” Missouri spoke up. She was quiet for a moment, then she let out a sigh of frustration. “I’m sorry, Dean,” she said. “I…I couldn’t see anything.” This was the first time Missouri had ever failed to give Dean an answer. When he was young, she and the warm space she’d cultivated around herself, had managed to pull him out of his shell when his mom had died. He owed a lot to her.
“Dean and Sam?” John asked. “Well . . . Sam’s off at college still, trying to be a lawyer. Dean’s still hunting. But.” His eyes narrowed shrewdly on Cas. “I’m sure you knew that.”
“Dean,” Cas snapped. “It was the right thing to do, and I helped.” Dean opened his mouth to argue, but there wasn’t a good argument to what Cas had said and he knew it. Castiel
Dean was used to carrying his dissatisfaction without complaint, living the life he had with the family he had and unable to tell the women he’d been with or friends he’d made the truth of his occupation. Even if things were different with Castiel, he clearly had trouble letting go of the way he dealt with his unhappiness.
“Okay, well, where is He?” Dean asked. “If He gives a shit about all this, then why the hell isn’t He striking her down with a lightning bolt?” Dean was being needlessly cruel.
“Yes, Castiel,” Hester said, as though stunned by his dimness. Then something in her expression cracked. She glanced at her feet, angry. “I always admired you, Castiel. I held myself to your standards and when—when the scission occurred, I lost someone I looked up to.” She had been a year or so younger than him and had gone with him to school.
So, Cas strode over to Dean, getting onto the bed behind him and reclaiming his position behind him. As the mattress shifted beneath them, Dean took in a quick breath of air.
Dean sighed. “I don’t know, man,” he said, turning off the engine. “It’s the end of the world. Go full hog. I’m buying.”
Castiel felt incredibly grateful that Dean had had Bobby – growing up and presently. Bobby acted as Castiel’s guide through the house, combing steadily through the dark.
Dean woke up the next morning disoriented and confused. He had someone wrapped up in his arms…Ellie. He still had all his clothes on, which was all he could ask for. Carefully, Dean shifted out of her embrace, and she didn’t even stir. She was totally dead to the world and Dean let himself feel a little proud of that. He got to his feet and quietly walked over to the door. He felt bad skipping on her in case he didn’t see her later but, he figured after last night he could be a dick the next morning and still have the overall experience still land in his favour. He stepped outside and softly shut the door behind him.
just rescue me,” he pointed out. He didn’t know much about adventure beyond what he’d read, and this seemed to fit the bill. Dean shrugged modestly, though he grinned. “Are you even a writer?”
. Asshole would feel like such a
“What? No!” Cas barked, then winced at his own voice. He ran his hands through his mussed hair. “Her friend…” he dragged his hands across his face, shutting his eyes. “I can’t remember her name. I am…hungover. It’ll come to me.” He seemed vaguely guilty about that; Dean just grinned, impressed that Cas had gotten laid all by himself and relieved that that weird night back in Texas was behind them.
“Well, you sure know how to sweet talk, Cas,” he said, but his voice came out too soft. Castiel shrugged next to him.
Nicki’s smile broadened and she leaned in slightly as she scanned and bagged Dean’s groceries
And it turned out that she’d been right about one thing, angels had been watching over him, just not in the way she’d hoped. And even that had done nothing to make Dean more of a believer. Hell, even most angels didn’t know if God existed or not. Cas had
“Did you and Jo—” Dean asked, horror mounting.
“Well, get ready,” Dean said, intent on ignoring Cas’s new crises. Cas let out a sigh and tugged at his clothes.
In the old days, when Heaven had been nothing more than your greatest hits, Dean suspects that nights like these would’ve featured heavily in his own slideshow. It’s the simplest things that count the most, a lot of the time.
When Castiel offered, Dean explained, “The Impala was my dad’s car, and he’d kill me if I wrecked it.”
“Well,” Dean said. He’d been pretty drunk, and Cas’d probably noticed it, but, “I meant what I said. Wasn’t fair for me to put all that on you. And, I’m sorry.”
“I went to Kansas today, after the diner,” he said. “When we were speaking, I remembered the rings your brothers were collecting.” Dean felt cold, but he didn’t move. Just froze and let Cas say his peace even though he really, really didn’t feel up to talking about his brothers. Thankfully, Cas seemed to switch topics. “Some of the Horsemen are old as Earth itself, others, specifically Death, predate it. I was only able to find one ring,” Castiel said.
At least this time, Cas goes with it, breathing almost desperately when Dean’s knuckles accidentally brush against his dick. Cas kisses Dean again, carefully withdrawing his hand from Dean’s jeans, then takes matters into his own hand, soaked with sweat and Dean and it shouldn’t be that hot but God it really is.
“Do you have lube?” he managed to ask.
“Well, let me know if there’s something I can do,” John offered.
“Your brother will recover soon enough,” Castiel began, knowing that Sam had done so in the past and would be committed to doing so again. “Then he’ll be—”
“Hey, Dean,” Mary spoke up at the doorway, smiling over at Dean, before finding her way into the kitchen. “Mind if I give you a hand?”
“Sam’s not a hunter,” Dean said, voice cutting through the painful fog building in Castiel’s mind, agitated. “You
“I’ve been a warrior for millennia,” Cas said, voice low and rumbling, but obviously defensive, moving on to pull someone else from the webs, slicing them open with a bloody knife. “I’ve been fighting before your species first stood upright.” Okay, big guy.
And he knew, deep down somewhere. That this was probably turning into something. Him and Cas. Cas had rejected the thought of being even remotely like Sam, but clearly that was why Dean gave a shit, right? Because if it was anything else, something for the dark, Cas couldn’t stick around. Dean wouldn’t do that to him, to them. So here they were, Dean on the couch sweating beneath his blanket, and Cas snoring on the floor at his feet. Something like brothers.
“Shut up, bitch,” Dean shot back, shoving Sam bodily. Sam laughed.
“I wanted to say,” Cas speaks up, formally, earnestly, effortlessly drawing Dean away from his thoughts, “thank you.”
“I was gonna take care of it later,” Dean tried explaining. He really would have feigned health until Cas stopped paying attention to him. Dean sat up on the bed a bit, adjusting his shirt. Cas didn’t chase him, settling deeper into rest.
Cas’s grip on the phone was so tight it had started to hurt so he loosened his hold and readjusted. “It’s not to a man, Dean,” he admitted.
“Oh?” Cas says, casual as anything, but his voice cracks.
, remember?” He pitches his voice into a Cas-like growl. It does not make Dean feel any better.
“I’ll be right back,” she promised. Dean turned around to Cas and caught him staring at Dean like he was a bug in a jar.
“But it’s
go back to them.” And he was right, Cas knew. But still, there was nothing Cas could say…Even after all these years, he was not used to having the rug pulled out from under him. He hadn’t asked for all this. Dean gave Cas one last ride back to his apartment, and then he left Rexford for good.
That hurts for Cas to learn. Dean shouldn’t have been. Perhaps Claire is mistaken.
With no solid credentials, no real background, they’d looked at him with some hopeful suspicion and told him as long as he showed up, passed his criminal background check, and didn’t smoke pot while he was on the job he should fit in for a long time. They were just about as desperate as he was.
doing anything but whatever the hell they’re doing right now.
Castiel had never cried before. He wasn’t sure if angels were capable of interacting with their vessels in such ways, or if it was just eons of practiced suppression taking its toll. But Castiel felt—he felt as though he could cry, so lost he was. And he should be stronger, stronger than Dean. But he wasn’t.
beautiful. Cas feels like he can almost see Dean’s soul, shining around the edges of him.
he yelped, hands automatically going up to bar his attacker from getting too close. Teeth, snapping. Dean's new friend didn’t budge, didn’t flinch, had a desperate kind of fury about him, but Dean managed to flip him on his back, and then another shot rang through the air, and the guy was just blood beneath Dean. Dean looked up to see Cas, aim steady on the attacker, though he was obviously disturbed. Dean glanced back at the body, dead.
Dean flinched away. “He exists, Dean, He’s somewhere on Earth, and He’s
my—”  was certainly not the beginning of a conversation Castiel felt the need to be part of.
“Then,” Naomi said, smiling for perhaps the first time ever, all teeth. “There’s much work to be done at the Church, and you can live here with your brothers until you are ready to move into your new home with your wife.”
“We should do this again sometime,” Cas says, just to bait the waters, just to see how Dean might react.
“I suppose it
But here Cas was, calling himself gay and saying he loved Dean. Dark blue eyes, shameful and shy, because he was afraid that Dean would reject that, reject him.
Daphne glanced down at the candle between them. “They…told me a little bit about you,” she confirmed. “About your past.” Castiel nodded. It had never been much of a past to speak of. Dean had been the extent of it, and Dean, while it was difficult for Cas to say, was straight.
She was much better than this than Castiel. It wasn’t that Cas didn’t have faith but unless Cas had cause, he didn’t like to be combative. Anna was confident and decisive but somehow inviting as well.
Dean gaped after him. It was fucking February, and yeah the sun was out but—it was nowhere near weather for Cas to go into the water like that. It was up to his hips, his waist, and then up to his chest. His arms were in the air, and the lake swallowed up his shoulders. Did he even know how to swim?
“Jerk,” he replied. Dean’s grin broadened.
It wasn’t long until they were pulling up in front of the cabin, dust being liberated into the air.
“Well, you should feel guilty for this,” he allowed, feeling the full weight of the day hit him. “It wasn’t especially pleasant.”
While he was worried that Dean might misread the situation, to which Cas was truly nothing but a passive participant, and reject it all—Cas included—upon waking, of course was a concern. But as Dean needed sleep, Cas suspected that Dean on some level had needed this closeness too, like Castiel. And Dean was, while rough around the edges, a gentle soul. He wouldn’t misread it, Cas hoped. They could just be gentle with one another for awhile.
“Christ,” Dean said, horribly drunk. He could feel the words like they were something real under his skin. He just wanted Cas back. And that was the awful, ugly truth of it. That Dean just missed him. And these weeks had just made it more apparent.
Cas tilted his head to the side a little to catch Dean’s eye, his attention. Shyly, Cas glanced away again, offering something honest. “But … it’s true that … when I
Dean told the other victims to head home, forget that this ever happened, and not go spreading around that they’d been kidnapped by Spiderwoman. He and Cas would spend the rest of their night burning the webs and getting rid of the body. Dean leaned down and picked up her head. He was gonna slot this night into the ‘Do Not Remember’ category. Including that dream. There was no point to thinking about all that now.
“C’mon, Cas,” he said. “My legs aren’t actually that –
Then, he turns away, clenching his jaw, staring intently at the kitchen table and steals a breath, nodding to himself.
“You save lives,” Cas started, trying not to sound too starstruck by the man sitting across from him. Two hours ago, Castiel hadn’t known that ghosts existed. It sounded dangerous but it
“Well, if I’ve learned anything from the children I’ve lost and the children I’ve raised,” Jody says, “love isn’t any good if it’s just a feeling.”
dude,” Dean grinned. He scooted a little closer, fixing Cas with a serious look that Cas reluctantly met. “Now, listen. Next time she comes around, ask her when she’s gettin’ off, alright?” Cas gave him a dirty look. “That’s
He’d apologize to Cas again, properly, if he didn’t feel too damn ashamed to broach the topic. Cas seemed fine to let things lie and Dean, well, Dean kind of needed that right now. It had been kind of a kick in the teeth, to see Cas choose Earth over Heaven. What with the rest of the angels gone too, Dean knew it was time to choose Earth over feeling sorry for himself.
“Ugh,” Crowley complained loudly at the sight. As Jo and Adam parted, Adam’s eyes were wide, cheeks flushed. Castiel would never understand it. The significance of a kiss.
“Okay, Cheech, let’s hit the hay,” Dean unexpectedly speaks up from the doorway.
“And when you and I met?” Cas asked, delighting under Dean’s gaze.
Cas was skeptical that either man talked to John much. The possibility that other hunters gossiped about Dean and Cas . . . had potential.
Dean didn’t move. He had his hands on the wheel, face turned to the house across the street. Castiel shifted in his seat. He had more or less entirely recovered from his earlier dramatics, feeling sober but chastened. “Are you planning to go inside?” he asked, placing his arm against the back of Dean’s seat and leaning into the front of the Impala.
Moments like these are essentially perfect, almost unreal, so still and perfect that Dean’s sometimes irrationally afraid to breathe too loud on the off-chance that he could shatter them.
known her. He hadn’t been just a keeper of her memory. He’d been her son, for real. A friend. A stone in her pocket, but she’d loved him.
For posterity’s sake, Cas undid his tie but got about as far as that until Dean was thrusting back up against him, moaning for attention.
Cas nodded. “Yes.”
He closed his eyes, feeling relieved, settling back down onto the mattress next to Dean. He’d never told anyone this before, not willingly. It had actually been a tremendous risk to do so but he’d suspected on some level that he could trust Dean. For once, his instincts had been correct.
The eager arousal faded from Dean’s eyes and he moved to lay back against his seat.
Nothing was meant by it, though the ease and interest with which Dean pursued this, whatever it was, did make Cas wonder. Once, Cas shifted over to make more room for Dean and Dean, drinking, seemed to unconsciously move in to claim the space left behind. Cas resolved not to think about it too much.
“Hey, hey, hey,” Dean said, reaching out to turn Cas’s gun away from him. “Watch where you point that thing.”
Castiel shifted uncomfortably, he’d been so caught up in watching their exchange he’d nearly forgotten he’d existed. It was jarring to be looked at.
Then the bartender cut himself off, looking at the doorway. His body language shifted into something more guarded as somebody new staggered into the bar, already looking half-drunk. “Hey there,” the bartender called out. Cas turned around to watch the newcomer.
Castiel remembers his first few weeks of being human. Alone, on the run. Unable to find his way to Sam and Dean with the angels chasing him, deciding to spend what little money he could scrounge up on a relatively inexpensive Enochian sigil tattoo which still remains on his ribs, grey-blue and blooming around the edges. The necessary pain of that, and the necessary discomfort of applying sunscreen. Those early days were the only time he had ever become burnt, skin dry and peeling to the point where it was painful to even make an expression. The sunscreen probably is worth avoiding that sensation, again.
And Dean hastened to comply, unzipping with a little shiver. And it was more obvious than ever that Dean had wanted more than just a simple massage.
So, when Castiel was driving through the town in Missouri Dean had told Castiel he was staying at and he spotted a black Impala parked in the lot beside a café, he pulled up beside her and stepped out.
you there’s been no mistake,” he started in, and Dean briefly, detachedly, wondered how Cas could talk like a librarian and still come off so dangerous.
Dean poured himself another drink, chasing it down quick with a hiss and sigh, hoping that the words would come loose with the liquor. He felt dizzy and ashamed, but in there somewhere he had to figure out what to say. Cas didn’t have to answer Sam’s calls or texts, but he’d have to listen to Dean’s prayers, if his Grace was still up to snuff. Might as well make it a good one.
“What would it change?” Cas asked, a little confused.
“Yeah, well, the shoe fits,” he growled, glancing away from Cas and over at the rickety picket fence of Ellen’s backyard. Who else was there to blame? Zach had told him to say yes to Michael, he hadn’t, and now Cas was wingless, hapless and hopeless.
Dean had been trying to not flirt with anyone else – not that Cas had ever asked him to refrain. In most ways, Dean’s charm was what allowed them to make any progress on some cases, Cas certainly didn’t help much in that regard.
In Cas’s travels across the United States, he’d come to know that there were not many black 1967 Chevy Impalas being driven around on the streets. And, while Dean changed out the licence plate semi-regularly, he never went anywhere without his car.
“It might have worked,” Cas agreed. “If only because those standing between an archangel and someone praying to him diminish in number each day.” So…Michael might have just been ignoring Dean. Kind of petty, in Dean’s opinion.
“Right,” Cas said. Dean cleared his throat and looked away.
is what Dean found fit to call him on?
“I always knew you had ... relations with some men,” Cas continues, warm-voiced this time. “Just not the way I wanted to be with you.” So, he
“You could message me any day,” the boy said shamelessly, and Anna grinned at Cas as though they were sharing a joke.
He’d had juice enough left apparently to hear Dean’s mistakes and zap himself out here. Not enough left over for this. It was a strange sort of irony; Cas wasn’t angel enough to hurt Dean and wasn’t angel enough to heal him. Dean’s face was still aching from where Cas had hit him. He could feel wet on his lips, couldn’t quite tell if it was blood or tears, probably a mix of both. He wiped his face with his palm. He was pathetic. In a weird way, the pain felt fine. It was Cas’s gentle, repentant hands, helping Dean to his feet, that bothered him.
Cas,” Dean insisted through gritted teeth as Cas gripped his wrist. Now they were both bloody and thoughtless and helplessly tied to what had transpired. He smoothed his hand over Dean’s, beginning to remake what he had once made.
“Well, keep it snappy, we’re only gonna be in town for the next few weeks so,” Johnny replied lazily.
Cas can’t meet her gaze. Castiel was once a thousand feet tall. He feels smaller than an insect now.
. Cas just squinted, confused, and then was jostled by a beefy biker-looking dude.
“Sst,” he hissed. “Cas, buddy. Up ‘n’ at ‘em.” Cas stirred.
“There’s a place near here,” Dean said instead. “Camp Chitaqua. It’s the place to be when the shit really hits the fan.”
It had taken Miracle a few weeks to become used to Castiel, but now he almost expects Castiel to take him out, even more than Sam who sometimes brings Miracle along for his jogs. Miracle prefers walking anyway, jogging being too slow of a pace for a dog who either likes to stroll or sprint.
They size each other up wordlessly. They hover like there’s some chasm between them that they both wanna cross but neither of them know how to start or what to expect once they do, so they just stick to their respective sides – staring, the way they used to do when they first met.
“Say homo again,” Dean suggested. Cas glared, able to tell he was being made fun of. “You know, you’re pretty chatty for a guy with a sore throat.” If he was going to walk Cas through this trying time, he sure as hell was going to have some fun with it. But Cas was not having a good time; he looked like was going to pitch over.
wants him to. It feels like too much and like nothing at all.
“I know, Cas,” he agreed, dully. “I get it.”
“Do you want anything to drink?” Cas asked. He wandered over to the fridge to see what he had left. He looked over at Dean.
“Let’s watch the DVD,” Castiel advised, voice low. Dean glanced over to him. Castiel had assumed Dean had slept after the mission last night, given his state of dress, but the hollow lines of exhaustion beneath his eyes spoke otherwise. Dean fed the DVD into the slot and returned to his place on the bed. Castiel, feeling awkward to stand, sat next to him.
A quick scan of the car’s interior emboldened Cas. The preternatural knickknacks, charms, and talismans decorating the dashboard, the physics book tossed in the backseat . . . Cas knew without a doubt to whom this car belonged. His heart bubbled higher in his chest in the knowledge that likely all that separated him and Dean was a doorway.
“You know, laughing at me isn’t really helping the situation, Ann Marie,” he joked, gesturing a little crudely at his crotch, but he was grinning, feeling a little relieved at her relief. But steadily, with a sinking sort of sadness, he recognized their situation. How he was worried that she’d turn him down, maybe be an asshole about it, and how she was worried that he might kill her. It had been a long while since he’d been on the receiving end of that feeling, he’d almost forgotten it.
Were you
“The reason I never told you I loved you before the Empty took me was because what I wanted from you, I knew you couldn’t give,” Cas speaks up, voice gentle-rough like fleece. “I didn’t want to burden you with my feelings. It wasn’t until we were about to die together that I realized that I didn’t need them to be returned, to share them.”
He feels Cas reach over him to place a cup of coffee on his bedside table. Hears the click of the lamp on his end table being turned on. The mattress gives, welcoming Cas as he reclaims his place on sheets that have gone cold without him. Cas awkwardly inches along so that he’s sitting as close to Dean as he can manage, gravity pulling Dean’s body towards him on the bed, sinking slowly.
Cas wants something here, and Dean doesn’t know what. He’s afraid to ask. Cas probably senses that, because he backs off, turns his face away, and gives Dean some distance leaning backward a bit, and Dean misses him.
“I’m…” he said, letting her straighten out his nametag and fix his collar. He wasn’t used to this. He had thought that he had been able to pass through life invisible as long as he didn’t say it out loud, that perhaps even God might overlook it. But he was obvious, people were just polite. “I’m sorry this interfered with my work.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked, a small smile teasing his lips. “Alright, why do people do physics, Einstein?” The way Dean was looking at Cas made Cas feel shy and understood. Cas looked down at the blank paper he’d placed on the counter. People became physicists because physics was beautiful.
“Two,” the realtor replied. “But this house is snug in the heart of Cicero, within walking distance of most amenities, and a gorgeous property.” Dean hadn’t seen anything in the yard that could’ve indicated that a kid had lived here, it looked like Lisa had packed herself up nicely to wherever she headed to.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t . . . make you feel safe, in this,” Cas offered.
“Yes.”
“I don’t imagine I could find a better woman than Daphne,” he murmured into his cup. “I am…I am interested.” What was marriage? It wasn’t as though he’d ever be able to marry a man.
Castiel knew John Winchester only through reputation but he seemed to make a controversial figure. From the way the boys had talked about him, stuck between loving and hating the man, Castiel was never certain if, given the opportunity, he should shake his hand or strike him down. Dean continued.
“Okay,” Dean says. “This should be a piece of pie.”
It had been some time since they had spoken to each other, true. And Dean did not seem willing to relinquish Castiel. Perhaps it was loneliness. Dean had parted ways with his brother not long ago, and after the vision Dean had beheld once Zachariah had sunk his talons into him, him and Castiel had hardly spoken. It was clear something had happened then, despite how flippant Dean behaved about nearly everything.
“Not a thing, sir,” he said. Cas’s chest clenched.
Still, Cas took advantage of Dean’s nearness to admire him in the dark. Some light was coming through from outside – the moon lit up Dean just enough for Cas to see the smooth of his cheekbones, the sharp of his jaw. He reached to press his palm to Dean’s face again, hearing more than seeing Dean smile.
Lisa had, however, far as Dean could tell, gotten straight outta Dodge. It wasn’t like he knew who she was anymore. God, he’d been so young when he’d met her, about twenty years old, totally alone for the first time in his life and still finding his sea legs. She’d been great—
Cas needs time to understand this, anyway. To understand why Dean did this to himself. Cas knows that this isn’t the first time Dean has hurt himself after loss. Sam has died many times before, but of those times, twice Dean has either impulsively committed suicide or sold his soul for his brother.
Dean had thought it’d been different now, because ... it sort of had been. Dean didn’t feel the need to look over his shoulder constantly regarding stupid shit like whether or not he was eyeing a guy for a second too long. There was a chance that this was, because it had become second nature to him over the years, something Dean carried without even noticing. It just went out the window around Cas, apparently.
Sam and Dean hadn’t even fully understood how connected hunters could be until after their father had passed because they’d always been coached against it. And John had been right to do it – you really couldn’t trust anyone but family.
“Physics,” Castiel said, looking back at the woman and away from Dean.
“It…was torn,” he said, scrubbing his jaw with his free hand. Things started to click for Dean.
Crowley,” Sam gritted out.
There wasn’t any sort of comfort that Castiel could provide for Dean, no matter how sorely he seemed to need it. Castiel could only return to his quest to find God, surfing channels so to speak, praying to God that he would find Him. Still, Castiel remained behind and eyed the uneaten pancakes.
Honestly, the best possible outcome would be for John to actually move out, maybe with Mary, but Dean wasn’t ready to cross that bridge yet.
“And what about your family?” Cas asked. Dean stilled, jaw tense. Maybe Cas was being cruel, but he kept going, “What would your father say if he knew that we’d…”
Ellen asked, incredulous. Crowley just shrugged, smarmy and smirking.
“What was it like?”
to be wanted like that. Like I’m a chick.” Cas let out a puff of air, caught between exasperation and relief, because he could at least understand the stem of Dean’s anxieties, even if he couldn’t understand the anxieties themselves.
He had put all the other terrible sleepless nights, intermittent rest, on him being homeless, and under great stress. Now, he has a home, or at least a place to stay, and there is nothing more to worry about. Neither gods nor monsters.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says. “I didn’t know my death would have that effect.”
But, Jack and John worked quick, and with the remains all salted and burned, Dean busted and bruised and near-flattened, Cas had reached out to help Dean back to his feet, to heal him the way he usually did.
“If you don’t want to have sex,” Dean says, throat still all tied up, but it’s important that Cas gets this. “Because you’re an angel. Or
He was going grocery shopping now with money he hadn’t had to earn beyond a promise to marry a nice woman and he was trying to enjoy freedom. He didn’t have to go to work, he didn’t have to worry about making rent or spending too frivolously on meals. It was strange…he had become accustomed to survival. He could turn his mind to higher things now, to physics, to God, and still his mind guiltily circled back to one thing with the inevitability of gravity.
“That why you’re smoking and drinking?” Dean asked.
This was a broader question, almost. Because Castiel hasn’t been doing much lately but helping Sam with the library, tailing the brothers on cases that are becoming fewer and fewer between, sleeping, and eating.
“So, as you can guess, he needs to unwind his entire roll,” Dean grinned. His hand was still on Cas’s body, but the friendliness of his palm stung.
There were two empty seats that evening, belonging to the resident angels, leaving a gap at the head of the table and another empty chair to Dean’s right.
This wasn’t the first time John and Dean’s paths had crossed and Dean had had to cancel his plans of hunting with Castiel so that he and John would hunt alone.
“So that’s the plan, huh?” Dean asked.
“You’re very capable of love,” Cas said, feeling quietly sentimental. “It’s . . . it’s part of what drew me to you. All this – hunting, living a life of persecution and toil, you wouldn’t do that if you didn’t love.”
“Where is Anna?” he asked.
“Well, it’s been going just swell over in my neck of the woods, Cas,” he said, determined, it seemed, to have some type of conversation with Castiel. “Met Paris Hilton, ganked her. You know. Met the antichrist, you were actually around for some of that. Became an old man for a hot second. I’m not, anymore.” He looked over at Castiel, like he was expecting his response.
Cas considered. He’d been planning on revisiting that motel in the coming week, so what Anna was asking of him was hardly hypothetical.
She looks at him carefully, mascara-lined eyes darting around his face.
“We’re just visiting to share a short but important message with you.”
So, Dean had agreed to pick Cas up. He’d blared the entire Led Zeppelin discography as he made his way over in an attempt to stay awake, boredom punctuated with brief moments of irritation and a grumbled insistence that he was going to teach Cas how to steal a car then how to drive it. Nevertheless, by the time he reached Booker something like loneliness had sunk into his bones and he didn’t mind making the trip all that much.
“If you’d prefer, I can leave,” he offers, easy as anything, eyebrow quirked.
Dean switched out the tape when he got back to the car and lived on Creedence Clearwater Revival until he hit Broken Bow. By the time he arrived outside Jo and Ellen’s house it was night, and everything was lit up blue-brown and tawny orange from the streetlamps. He parked Baby across the street and looked over the place. This was where his brothers had spent the last of their days. He took a breath. He walked up the steps.
“I need another damn drink,” she muttered.
“Hey, watch it,” Dean said, startling back into the present, holding up an arm because she was still waving Cas’s angel blade around. It was weird to see her—to see that she was a real person, but the fact that she had Cas’s knife kind of cut through Dean’s existential crisis. “I don’t know how to answer that in a way that won’t make you think I’m nuts,” he told her honestly.
Cas pulls back only to ask, licking his lips nervously, “Are you sure?”
“Got caught up,” Dean replied, shrugging a little defensively.
When Dean finally ran out of things to talk about, Bobby asked, “So,
“I like it,” Castiel admitted mildly. The singer was singing about stars. Dean groused some more but he didn’t change the music until after they paused for gas between the Missouri River and Hartington.
“It certainly seems so,” he agreed neutrally.
“I wanna stay at Ellen’s, if that’s alright,” Adam explained, pulling away, and Castiel suspected his mind was on another Harvelle entirely. “And let Sam know…let him know.” Dean nodded at Castiel and gave Adam one last touch to the shoulder. Castiel reached out to grip Adam’s arm, and they were gone.
Dean stammered and Cas considered. Their second-year anniversary had passed in July. They hadn’t formally celebrated it, but Castiel had bought pie, and whether Dean knew why didn’t matter much either way.
I could have bought some time.”
“Yeah, it’s not easy, but didn’t you graduate physics?” Dean asked, suddenly belligerent. Cas bit back a laugh and Dean caught him, smiling.
Mary smiled. “When I met your father,” she said, frankly. “I really saw a way out of my life as a hunter. That was half the reason I was so desperate to pursue him. And I love him, of course, and he loved me. And we tore each other apart over it. And now I ... now I don’t even know if I’m going to stay with him. Life’s a crazy thing.”
And now, the triumph of the hunt was settling in on Castiel. Not only had he bested a powerful ghost, but he’d saved John Winchester’s life. It wasn’t bad for the ego. Not to mention, Dean had taken care of the ghouls and saved the children, dropping them off near a police station. All was well.
Dean doesn’t understand Cas at all. He thinks he should feel like shit about this, but Cas
“I’m not sure,” Cas said honestly. “I could check.”
“Close your eyes and concentrate,” she said softly. He obeyed, her wrinkling fingers fitting through his with a kind dry touch. Michael had never gotten close to possessing Dean, as much as Michael had promised him would happen when they had first seen each other in 1978. For the first time, Dean hoped the connection was there. Tried thinking Michael thoughts.
“You know, don’t do me any favours, Cas,” Dean said coldly.
Castiel turned away, feeling regretful. There was little he could do to commiserate with Adam. “You would be better off asking Dean about how to deal with that,” he said. “You would be better off asking Sam.” Adam stared at Castiel a moment, a stubborn set to his jaw, and then he looked away, wilting.
“Cas,” Dean started promising. “About the Empty. We’ll figure something out.”
, Dean. What else can I do but…fall.”
Dean grinned broadly in response. He was about to reply to Cas’s question when his phone began to ring.
“Must’ve been providence,” Cas joked, leaning his head into his hands, just a s relieved. Dean laughed louder. He must’ve been just a little hysterical, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
But then Cas keeps going.
He had started school at age twenty-one, far behind his peers, and it had been a strange fit. An eclectic group of people were in religious studies, and a few of them weren’t even religious. Heaven would not permit him to attend if they knew and next to that, Castiel had recently taken a course which had indicated to him that perhaps his passions lie in areas other than religion.
“My apologies for frightening you, Bobby,” he offered, spreading his wings, preparing to take his leave. The last thing he heard as he returned to his hunt was a bark of surprised laughter from Dean.
“You’re proposing using yourself as bait,” Cas said. Dean shrugged. Wouldn’t be the first time.
“I know, Dean,” Cas murmured. “Or ... I’d hoped.” He closed his eyes, settling next to Dean. He added, “I know gay men make you uncomfortable.” Jesus.
Dean started taking back his sleeves, straighten himself out. “Neither are you,” he went on. “Or maybe you are, whatever. But this right here? You’re drunk. Lonely. You’re
It wasn’t that gay men made Dean uncomfortable it was just ... Dean didn’t know how to act. Like a dog that had never been socialized with the other puppies meeting his own kind. Dean hadn’t exactly walked in a ton of pride parades. He didn’t know how to turn off his defensive attitude, and when he did, he didn’t know how to not act like he was trying to get paid.
Cas gaped. He grasped Sam’s arms. “Perhaps it’s more important you talk to him than me,” Cas said, feeling more sympathetic than fearful. He knew Sam. “Because whenever we spoke, it was clear. He loves you more than anything, Sam. He feels guilty that he left you, and he’s proud of you.”
, it’s good.”
all the time,” he gestured around them. Bobby shot Dean a pissy look because he hadn’t been much for the dating scene as long as Dean’d known him, but Dean held fast. Maybe he’d blown his chance at a good life but that didn’t mean Cas had to go down the same road as him. He at least deserved an opportunity to experience something good in case shit hit the fan. “You could meet someone, settle down.”
“Oh my god,” the girl on the bed whimpers. “He’s
“What if it’s not enough for me?” Dean asks then.
She nodded slowly. Perhaps she could sense he was withholding truth as well. It took one to know one.
Cas was a shit liar.
“Yeah. We good to go?” Dean ventures, finding the key in the ignition.
Dean made a choked sound, muscles in his back twitching, as Cas ran his thumb along Dean’s length.
“So, that
He’d probably hated himself more than he’d ever loved Dean. Not that Dean could blame him for that. “Well,” Dean said with a snort. “Don’t do me any favours. And, for what it’s worth,” Dean pressed on, because he didn’t think it was worth all that much, “you were never a burden to us.”
“No, you’re, um – I’m pretty sure you’ll want to hear this,” Dean said, glancing down at his feet, feeling his face burn red.
“I can’t—” Adam choked out.
“Name’s Dean,” Dean told her. “That’s Cas.” It was tricky because the demons were on the lookout for them and giving out their names wasn’t the smartest idea, but Dean wasn’t about to lie to the barrel of a gun so he gave these people that much. They didn’t need to know any last names. Not that Cas even had one.
“Oh, so he’s
Still, it didn’t change the reality of things.
And, it wasn’t like Cas was wrong. It was so much easier for Dean to be angry, but yeah – he’d been holding onto this hurt ever since John came back. And realistically, Dean had been avoiding thinking too closely about all of this for his entire life. But now, forced to be honest for Cas, Dean was falling to pieces. Not that Cas seemed to mind.
. The Croatoan virus, god help them if
“No!” the bartender screamed. “No, don’t kill me! Please, please don’t—” And he started to pick himself to run when the window shattered and so did the bartender’s throat, blood splashing across Dean’s face, warm and wet.
“It will be dangerous,” Cas said reluctantly, looking at Dean, at his hollow frame, all curled over on itself. Dean nodded his head, almost imperceptibly. And Castiel and Jo vanished, to Detroit. And in the end, Dean was right, and they let it happen. There was nothing else to do.
“It just couldn’t last. And it’s not like I could’ve left those kids to fend for themselves, I had to help. And, I don’t know. I knew I was going to die sooner or later. On a hunt – or. And I get that I didn’t have to hunt, but why would I settle down when I didn’t have anyone to settle down with and Sam was better off without me? You were still in the Empty. Hell, there was a part of me that wondered if I might end up in the same place.”
He explained, “We’d get by on credit card fraud, generally, and Bobby helped us out when times were rough but other than that we uh—we hustled. Gambled, placed bets and played games with people who thought we were drunker or stupider than we were. That got us by.”
“Well, as I’ve always said, that’s
Dean turned his eye back to his own beer. He let out a breath of air.
But, if Cas wanted him. Maybe that was something Dean could work with. As big of a risk as it was.
“You mean go to Hell,” Dean realizes.
“I’m hardly more use to you sober,” Cas said. Dean wished he could argue. “I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas went on, voice low and brittle with something like pity. “You must blame yourself for this.” Dean’s hurt sunk into his gut.
“The hell was that about?” Dean asked, hushed. “That someone from Sunday school?” Cas didn’t have the energy to tell Dean that he was right.
It was a way to assert Heaven’s dominance, their unavoidable presence, a reminder that Dean owed his life to them. It wasn’t meant to be about Castiel. It wasn’t even meant to be about Dean. But Castiel couldn’t help but wonder if there was some sort of physical law at play. That where Castiel pushed, Dean pushed back. An equal and opposite force, gripping him in turn.
“Once, I thought you might be able to perceive my true visage,” Cas murmured. “Instead, I injured you.” Dean cleared his throat, feeling defensive.
He looked back at Cas. He’d been quiet for too long. “Are we moving on soon?” Cas asked. “I assume that’s why you came.” Dean had to say something.
Sometimes Castiel couldn’t get him to speak at all, and eventually the weight of it would make Dean crumble down one night, the problem unresolved but Dean unwilling to carry it any longer. And so, they would pick up their pieces and keep moving.
A minute later and Cas was inside next to him, trying to warm up. Dean looked him over. He filled out Dean’s clothes well, though his pants looped around his ankles a few times, and Dean almost had a moment of doting over him like he was a baby duck. Cas looked strange outside the trench coat, naked somehow. He hadn’t looked like that in the future but now, shivering in the shotgun seat next to Dean, pressed close to the heater, Cas seemed incredibly vulnerable.
“I wasn’t talking about my deal,” he said. Right. The whole love thing. Dean still didn’t know what the hell he was supposed to say about that. Still hadn’t sunk in that that’s what Cas thought. He’d almost needed Cas to confirm that Dean hadn’t misheard him somehow.
Overall, the whole thing still felt like one long, boring nightmare. Most days Dean still couldn’t believe that Sam had actually said yes. He couldn’t believe his half-brother, for as briefly as he’d known him, was dead or gone—
“Thank you for your hospitality, Bobby,” Cas insisted.

“Oh, I—uh,” she fumbled. “I’m just…I worked as a receptionist for a few years after I graduated high school. I mean—I volunteered, they hired me on later. It was…charity work. I changed branches, so here I am.”
“You’re such a dick,” he cursed. Cas heard Dean’s amusement, a little huff of laughter. Cas let himself grin. Maybe things wouldn’t be so bad, now that they understood one another a little better.
“Dean.”
Dean had always been skeptical of angels being able to love, the way humans did. Cas, especially, had always seemed to get split up like firewood over it, like love was a frequency he wasn’t built to operate at.
“Meantime, we need hands on deck for demons that are topside. Found a new case,” Dean explains, needing to say something, even if it’s premature. The last few cases Dean’s found have been at least demon adjacent, there’s a chance he’s seeing shadows, so he elaborates, “Or well, it might be. Not sure yet.” He juts his thumb out at the laptop.

“Was it a problem that I spent the night?” Cas asked. “If there are vampires?”
“You’ve seen him and Jack,” Sam argues. “That’s love. One
“The reason why I ‘pal around’ with you, is fairly simple. I feel the same way. You’re a good man. Even though you’re also aggravating, stupid, and hurtful.”
“Better,” Dean blurts, retrieving his hand back to his side, not meeting Cas’s gaze. Almost as though he had been burned, touching Castiel’s skin.

He clutched Dean’s amulet in one hand. Peru, Norway, Nigeria, Thailand. Every church in Slovenia, from forgotten cottages to grand Cathedrals. Hawai’i. He traveled, waiting for it to light up, to burn. And it didn’t. It never had. Dean was convinced that God was dead, in every sense of the term. And, perhaps he was right.
