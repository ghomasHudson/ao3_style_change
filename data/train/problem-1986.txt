John shrugs, because he hates to admit it, but Mycroft is right.
The shattered-glass sound was a vase - John didn’t know they owned one - that fell to the floor in the kitchen.
“Now, dear, don’t get sentimental, we’ve got a show to host. This week’s challenge is dessert, and the last showstopper is also the last opportunity of our bakers to impress the judges with a mouth-watering dessert good enough to get them into the final.”
She greets John with a cordial smile. “Oh, good, there you are. Dr. Sholto was looking for you.”
“Sit,” the Fey’a in charge of him says. He puts a wooden bowl in John’s hands. “Drink.”
Sherlock turns abruptly and faces him. There’s something searching in his gaze in the dim light of the hallway. “So?”
It lasts forever and it’s over too fast. John collapses on Sherlock, and kisses his shoulder, and mutters “Fuck,” and “so hot” but won’t look at Sherlock at all, and Sherlock lets him do this too, lets John hide his face in Sherlock’s shoulder, and he drops a soft kiss on John’s hair and wonders why this feels like a last time, like goodbye, like John isn’t even here anymore even though five minutes ago Sherlock was literally inside him.
Sherlock hesitates for a moment, then decides that John deserves an honest answer.
John just grins at him, and they finish their meal in companionable silence. Some of the nervous energy seems to seep out of Sherlock while he sips his tea, and John is grateful. When Sherlock finally stops fidgeting and seems to settle down for a long think, John feels settled enough to ask, “Do we go to Lestrade?”
“Did he ask either of you to do anything for him?” John asks the next obvious question, earning an approving look from Sherlock.
Starving. -SH
“Definitely having fun,” John answers with a grin, and the hosts move on.
To his surprise, his co-contestants laugh, and talk switches from baking to weird social media comments. Neither Irene nor Janine bring up the comments they left on John’s blog, but he can feel both of them watching him as John absently leans his head on Sherlock’s arm when he gets tired.
“That’s not the point, and you know it,” John snaps, irritated by Sherlock’s brazen attitude and by the pain in his ribs.
John sighs deeply. “I don’t hate you. I tried, but I just. I can’t.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “Bored.”
“Camera does add a bit,” Mike says with a grin, rubbing his ample stomach.
He has yet to regret it.
“You’re not stage manager, he is. You’re his deputy. He’s the one who’s responsible.”
John shrugs. “I’ve had worse.”
Sherlock plays for John, then. Plays gratitude and devotion and gratitude for devotion, for the love he isn't sure he deserves but plans to hold on to anyway. For John, who came with him to the ends of the Earth, who got stabbed and beaten and shot at for Sherlock, and who kept his promise to get them home again in one piece. For every moment he only survived because of John, for every time he would have lost himself if not for John.
And Sherlock was stuck muttering, “I’m sorry, it was for you, don’t you see, he would’ve used you against me, again and again, and I couldn’t stand it, you were safe, that’s all that mattered, you were safe, and I’m sorry.”
They pick him up and put him on something soft and warm. Then there’s sunlight. John doesn’t let go of his hand. Sherlock sleeps.
Sherlock nods. “Emma told me we’re good for ratings.”
He knows it’s only a matter of time. Delirium tremens, or her liver will give out, or she’ll become diabetic and die of hypoglycemia. Even if he wasn’t a doctor, he’d know because he watched it happen to their dad.
Oh, he stares at Sherlock. Especially in costume. Sherlock can feel his eyes travel up his bare spine like fingertips, and he knows just from the feeling that look gives him that when he finally
Sherlock takes a sip of tea and allows himself to enjoy the warm smoothness of it. “I did, I distinctly remember it.”
There’s a letter. Sherlock wrote it before he “died”. It explains everything, and it was supposed to be handed to John if he actually died, but he decided that if he wants John to wait for him, it would be good to let him know that he’s actually coming back. So he asked Mycroft to give John the letter, so John would know what he did and why, so John would forgive him and wait for him in London, safe and sound.
John kisses him.
Mycroft looks up at John and gives him a slight, pitying smile. “Sentiment, Dr Watson. You exposed my brother to quite a lot of it.”
his body is saying.
It’s Thursday, and Sherlock has just distributed the leftovers from both his and John’s bakes from yesterday to his homeless network when his mobile rings.
“So, John, another win for Molly, who do you think will get to the final?”
The following production, he was made stage manager.
They’ve both decided to do Cornish pasties to try them out for the show. Sherlock is stirring the mince he pressed out of two pork sausages in a pan with two cloves of garlic and a medium-sized onion. He shrugs and gives the pan a practiced toss. “I’m renting the flat upstairs. When the cafe went out of business, my landlord had a hard time finding a new tenant, so he’s letting me rent the space for about a third of what he’d get if he could get a business in here, but it’s better than nothing, because I heat the place and look after it.”
Sherlock doesn’t know who started the kissing this time, but it doesn’t really matter that much.
Sherlock shrugs. “My parents won’t let me fire him. They’re convinced it’s Mycroft’s calling in life to get me that Tony. It would serve all of them right if I quit acting and became a chemistry teacher to posh brats.”

The cell is cold but clean, and the furniture is sparse but relatively new. There’s even a tiny barred window that lets one catch the occasional sunbeam. It’s not luxurious by any stretch of the imagination, but he expected to be shot on sight, and he wonders why he wasn’t.
John just nods and lets Sherlock go ahead into the forest. Not for the first time, he wishes he was even half as sure.
Sherlock just snorts.
A few words about this recipe: You don’t need butter for the dough. And you don’t need to do anything to the Powidl, just put a spoonful into the center of the dough and you’re fine. You don’t need to add sugar or cinnamon, it’s a waste of time, the Powidl is good enough on its own.
With John, it’s… fine. Still annoying, but not unbearably so.
“Nice batter, good height, not too much food colouring, and she’s letting the marzipan sit at room temperature, that’s wise.”
Sherlock says nothing and waits for John to get over his inherent stubbornness to realise that Sherlock is making a common sense suggestion.
He can still taste the bitter adrenaline in his mouth. It’s been two hours, and there’s still a slight tremor running along his skin, down his back, into his hands, conducting into the ground by the jiggling of his leg he can’t seem to stop. His hands are freezing. Maybe the tea is a good idea after all.
Sherlock tries his best to ignore John, which isn’t easy, especially because he’s so bored. John’s got his sponges in the oven as well, and he looks over at Sherlock with a smile.
Mycroft maneuvers him into a car, and Sherlock loses track of everything until he’s sitting in front of a monitor and watches John Watson die. Even in the washed-out CCTV footage John looks pale and tired. He’s limping. He doesn’t pay attention to traffic. The lorry runs a red light. John doesn’t even look up.
“No need to apologise for your unbiased opinion.” Sherlock dismisses her apology with a wave of his hand. “Mrs Hudson?”
Sherlock rings the bell before he can talk himself out of it.
Whatever happens next, at least he’s here with a friend.
“John. Breathe. I’m fine. I’m fine. Are you listening to me?”
“Sherlock,” his mother says, taking his arm. “We’re having drinks with an old friend of ours, he’s a very influential film producer, and he was watching tonight. He was very impressed.”
“Savoury macarons, that sounds fantastic,” Mrs Turner enthuses. “And why does it not surprise me that you’re pronouncing it scone instead of skon.”
“Are you nervous about tomorrow?”
As soon as his mother has rung off, Sherlock sends off a text to John.
Oddly enough, Moriarty seems to be waiting for him, leaning casually against the back of the catering tent.
Lestrade’s phone rings. He’s got a very loud, very annoying ringtone.
“All right?” Sherlock asks, echoing the question from his text the night before.
“Well, Sherlock and Molly for sure, guess I’ll have to battle it out with Jim.”
Most of the contestants make their way towards the catering tent. Sherlock steps out for a bit of fresh air. He’s bored and restless and he would love a cigarette, but he doesn’t necessarily want to start smoking again on Day One of this endeavour. His phone buzzes. Mycroft. He hits ignore and takes a deep, cleansing breath of air. He knows what Mycroft wants, and he has zero interest in this conversation.
John looks at Sherlock, and for the first time, Sherlock has the feeling John is actually looking at Sherlock the person, not Sherlock the actor. He’s even smiling a bit. “Do you want to tell the story?” His tone is teasing, and Sherlock’s heart does a very impressive flip.
It’s the following Tuesday. It’s three in the afternoon. There’s nothing on the telly, and Sherlock hasn’t even had coffee today. There are no nicotine patches on his arms, and nothing exciting has happened to them in over 24 hours.
In an instant, Billy is out of his chair. “You lying sod! I never took nothing off nobody, and I dare you to prove it!”
“Yes, well, I’m making an Austrian specialty, Powidltascherln, it’s like Tortellini, only sweet, and I’m doing three different fillings.”
For a while, they just sit there quietly. The ambient noise - football on the telly, locals talking quietly over a pint - doesn’t make the silence any more comfortable.
John snorts in amusement. “Of course I measure. Look,” he holds up the bag of flour. “This is a kilo bag, and it was full. Now it’s about half full, that’s approximately 500 grams of flour. A packet of butter has 250 grams, half of that is about 125. If I’ve got it a bit wrong, I just add more flour or butter or milk. I know the consistency I want, and it doesn’t really matter whether I’m going to end up with 12 scones, or 10, or 11. Tomorrow, when I’m baking for a national audience, I’ll use a scale again. But for now, for me, this is good enough.”
“To show off, obviously,” John says, and there it is again, that smile that John has managed to startle out of Sherlock, but he doesn’t answer, even though he’s dying to tell John what he’s making.
And always John’s voice, low and promising in his ear.
“So, John, your doughnut filling is apricot jam.”
A large, friendly boy named Mike is tasked with showing them around by Mrs. Higgins.
Sherlock smiles back, all easy charm, and John grits his teeth and nods at Lestrade. “From the top?”
John hesitates, and Sherlock feels a bit like he’s on the edge of a cliff, and suddenly John’s answer matters much more than it should.
It's late when Sherlock's finally ready to go, after interviews and call sheets for next week, after packing up his things. He's the last of the contestants, the others have been gone for at last half an hour. The only people left in the tents are a few tired technicians who will be rolling up cables and packing up lights for another hour at least.
John sighs. Sherlock catches his eyes and gives him a humourless half-smile of acknowledgement, and John knows they’re thinking the same thing. There goes any help they’ll get from the Irregulars.
Admittedly, he’s never worked with an actor he used to be soul-crushingly in love with who dumped him like hot coals and broke his heart into a million splinters, but there’s a first time for everything.
“He told me,” Sherlock says, and from the honest surprise on her face he realises that he should have known they were getting in too deep even back then.
Unbidden, he can hear Mycroft’s voice in his memory.
“Nausea, double vision, hallucinations?”
And then John’s eyes flick to Sherlock’s lips, briefly, unconsciously, and Sherlock feels white-hot triumph float him like another hit of the cocaine he consumed so generously not thirty minutes ago, because now he knows
“Wouldn’t wonder if he starts spewing poison on social media if he loses,” Molly muses.
Sherlock just manages not to flinch, but it’s a herculean effort. He turns slightly to see John sitting on the second step of the stairs that go up to the next level. “Says the man sitting on metal stairs in the middle of the night in his pyjamas. In November.”
Music is the ancient, creaking floorboards of 221B as Sherlock paces, thinking aloud as John listens from his chair, the ancient springs shifting with the uneven distribution of John’s weight as he readjusts his position.
John takes another step closer and looks over Holmes’ shoulder. “Why are you dissecting this rabbit?”
“Even if it was true, and I’m not saying it is, that doesn’t do me a whole lot of good, seeing as he probably isn’t interested anymore.”
Because, let’s face it, for somebody like him, therapy is a complete waste of time.
“That we saw something you apparently missed. I told you Violet Jones didn’t commit suicide,” Sherlock bites back.
“I know,” Sherlock says, restraining himself from taking the phone from John to call Mrs Hudson himself and threaten grievous bodily harm if she lets John enter the theatre tonight. “But you have a very competent crew who can do this without you for one night. Or even several.”
Sherlock showers and opens his laptop. Keeping up with his social media channels is more difficult these days, his subscribers and interactions have quadrupled, and are still rising. He gets comments and likes and questions, and he tries to answer as many reasonable ones as he can. He also posts some deliberately vague pictures from today’s filming, a very good close-up of the chocolate sauce he made, a whisk with a whipped cream peak hanging from it.
And then there’s a hand in his hair, and John pulls Sherlock’s head away from his, puts a bit of space between them. “What have you taken?” John asks, quiet and serious and even a bit dangerous.
John gasps, and his entire body arches against Sherlock’s. “Do that again.”
He opens his eyes and looks at John. “Will you be happy to see me?”
“Come on,” he says, trying to sound soothing. “Let’s go back.”
“Well, look at him. He’s... “ John makes a vague gesture at the air representing Sherlock, and then gestures at himself. “And I’m…”
So Sherlock feels somewhat justified to count John’s press of lips against his a significant beginning – he will later re-label this incident Kiss Zero in his head - even though it was only technically a kiss and he was technically dead at the time.
John has been mostly silent, occasionally correcting Lestrade about the blocking or a prop, cooly professional, the perfect DSM as always, looking unfazed and unflappable the way only John Watson can. He’d forgotten this about John, how he was always so calm in the chaos of backstage, especially when something went wrong, how he’d never yell or run or lose that almost zen-like quality of being within the eye of the storm.
The world is coming ever so slightly more into focus. Fireplace. Skull. Baker Street. Blurry shapes in the distance. Emergency lights, red-blue-red-blue-red-blue-red-blue.
John nudges him with the phone and Sherlock opens his eyes again and looks directly into John’s, and he doesn’t look angry right now, not even a little bit, but Sherlock knows that doesn’t mean he isn’t.
“I probably won’t have a choice. He will never let me be in charge of my own life, no matter how many years I’ve been sober.”
Greg puts a hand on his shoulder and squeezes. “Just tell me if you can’t handle it, all right?”
unsaid, but it’s heavily implied in his tone.
Set directly after TAB
Sherlock smiles. Hope, indeed.
Sherlock shrugs. “Sleep is for the weak.”
The cafe is brightly lit, a watery late autumn sun streaming in through the windows, throwing shadows of advertisements on the windows over Sherlock’s table.
Two people are still struggling with their pies. A man with a perpetually sneering, yet overwhelmed expression has torn his crust. Not enough butter. Classic mistake. A woman is near tears because her filling is leaking out of the pie form, complaining loudly about how soggy her bottom is going to be. She’s not the only one. He’s heard worries about soggy bottoms from everybody in the room except John, Jim and Irene.
“Fine, fine, you can eat Sachertorte and ignore your diabetes, it’s your health.”
“He’s happy,” he finally says to Mrs Hudson. “That’s all that matters.”
“I know it’s a lot to ask, but can you come in right away?” Mrs Hudson asks.  “We can deal with the contract and you can start rehearsing this afternoon. John will give you the script then. You remember John, right?”
John’s eyes go wide as he looks at the Google search results on his phone, then looks up at Sherlock again. “So you know of her, or do you know her personally?”
“But both processes are essentially the same. Raw products combined in a certain fixed way, heat, eat. Science.” Sherlock makes a ‘there you have it’ gesture with his pizza slice.
“Our showstopper challenge today is Afternoon Tea. Our contestants have four hours to prepare an afternoon tea spread for our judges. They need to do at least one sweet and one savoury bake, and they can do whatever they want. Bakers, on your mark, get set, bake.”
“You hear that?” John asks quietly.
“Perfect.”
That moment, the door opens and a slender, tall boy sweeps in, dressed incongruously in well-fitting, comfortable looking trousers and a well-fitting shirt, and a dark grey wool coat that seems far too big for him. He’s walking by them without looking at any of them, nose buried in a book.
Mrs Hudson hesitates for a moment, then says, “Look, I don’t know how much Mr Lestrade has told you, but maybe stay out of the Forest for now, all right?”
“I’ll take her,” Sherlock says immediately, glad to have something concrete to do, relieved beyond measure as John hands her over without protest, then slumps back in his chair with obvious relief.
Sherlock bites down on the relief that swamps him and deliberately doesn’t smile when he turns around to meet John, who’s walking towards him looking a little winded.
“This is amazing,” John says under his breath, gazing from a Roman helmet and spear to a cloth that seems to be marked with Celtic runes. “He found all of this around here?”
Sherlock smiles at him, can’t help himself, and he’s sure it’s somewhere between deeply fond and unbearably besotted, because that’s how he feels. “That was pure luck, but fine. You win.” He takes an unconscious step closer to John. “We didn’t set a prize. So what do you want?”
“Married, kids, profession?”
He watches John sleep peacefully and wonders.
John turns his head, and the kiss this time is neither quick nor easy, it’s hard and hot and dirty. “Anything,” John breathes against Sherlock’s lips. “As long as it’s you.”
But he knows he could never express any of the appreciation he feels for them in words, so he turns back to stretching his dough, and the two hosts leave him to it.
“You speak German?” John asks, eyebrows going up in surprise.
@messybaker
Billy nods. “Checked in, went off again.” Billy looks up from his half of the sandwich and takes a drag of his ale. He offers John the bottle, but he waves it off.
John leans in and presses a soft kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. “Break a leg.”
“Yes?”
Mike gives John a reassuring nod. “Don’t worry. I can hold it together for three days.”
Because John doesn’t only know that Sherlock loves him, he has also discovered something Sherlock doesn’t know and will never, ever believe: John loves Sherlock back.
So John goes back to sleep with Sherlock’s breath in his ear, and Sherlock’s chest pressed against his arm, and if he snuggles a little closer to Sherlock, then, well, nobody needs to know.
Sherlock snorts. “Why would I tell you?”
“Oh. Chips.” Sherlock sighs. He pauses, then adds, “I miss record players.”
“Good. It’s good.”
John shakes his head. “Nope. Back to bed. Your blood pressure will thank me.”
He wishes repetition would finally dull the pain. But every time he thinks about it, it hits him again like a sledgehammer. The person he thought he’d spend his life with shot the other person he thought he’d spend his life with (albeit for different values of spending a life with) in the chest. His wife, the mother of his unborn child, is a semi-psychotic assassin, such a brilliant liar she obviously fooled even Sherlock. Which begs the question, what else has she been lying about? Does he even know her at all? Is anything she ever told him true?
John laughs, then winces because it hurts a little. "Fine. Privacy is overrated anyway."
“Please stop. If this gets any more cloyingly inane I might actually vomit a bit in my mouth.”
It’s surprising, that last thought. It shows him how much his self-perception has shifted over the last year. He was always proud of being a brain with a transport attached. It occurred to him only recently that being seen as a whole person with heart and a soul as well as a mind is occasionally not entirely unpleasant.
so Sherlock can take him apart at his leisure. It doesn’t quite work out that way, because John drags him off and up with a curse muffled between their lips and kisses Sherlock even as he unzips Sherlock’s trousers and sticks a hand down his pants, freeing Sherlock’s leaking cock. He drags Sherlock in until he’s sprawled on John’s lap, then John takes hold of both their cocks with a strong grip, and Sherlock is flooded by sensation. John is kissing him like the world is ending and tossing them off like there’s no tomorrow, and between the heat of John’s mouth and the insanely good, just the right amount of too rough friction as their cocks rub together, Sherlock’s mind is wiped blank of thought as he succumbs to pure pleasure.
“Neither are you,” Sherlock mutters, voice barely more than a whisper, because it’s difficult to speak around the emotion clogging up his throat.
Mrs. Hudson sighs and sits down on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, watching him, worry lines on her face. “I suppose you’re right.”
In hindsight it isn't surprising that the two incidents are closely related.
The light is on, and Mike is sprawled on the floor, passed out drunk, in a stable lateral position, obviously positioned in a way that he won’t choke on his own vomit. The door to the courtyard is open, and John is sitting on the bottom of the two steps leading outside. His entire posture screams exhaustion, both physical and emotional.
“Easy for you to say, you don't even
“If you poison my mice again, I’ll skin you and sell your hide on the marketplace.”
“I do try,” Sherlock says, giving her what he hopes is a genuine-looking smile.
So when Mrs. Hudson offered him 221B, he considered that it would probably be a good idea to have somebody around to take care of the boring, mundane details like paying the rent, vacuuming, and turning off the Bunsen burner if Sherlock passes out over his experiments.
He grabs his phone and scrolls to his only contact. He hits the call button before he has time to think about it. “Mycroft,” he says when the voicemail beeps. “I need a favour. A big one.”
“When did you discover it was gone?” Sherlock asks, razor-sharp gaze pinned on the Midnight Queen.
Third, he needs to find a sponsor.
“I’m always right, haven’t you noticed?”
The judges move on, and Sherlock just hopes this will end soon, because he’s already bored out of his mind.
Now he’s thinking of what he wants. Fucking John right here on the counter seems an excellent option. They’re already perfectly aligned like this. The only problem is a logistical one, because he has neither lube or condoms. So taking John upstairs and bending him over Sherlock’s kitchen table seems more doable, and he’s certain that John will be amenable.
He can see something within Sherlock give way, and Sherlock nods. “Of course.”
She looks up. He gives her a small smile that’s more a grimace, but she smiles back, her posture relaxing somewhat. “We can fix this,” he says, and even as he speaks the words he knows they’re a lie.  He will never trust her again, and at the first sign of trouble, she’ll run.
Sherlock lets his violin sink down, away from his neck, and closes his eyes.
“Try this.”
John sighs, predictable annoyance about the walls. He clears his throat, but hesitates forming words, which tells Sherlock that John doesn’t want to fight, but can’t help asking, “What’s all this, then? New Case?” His voice is rough and Sherlock can hear the bone-deep weariness in the scrape of his throat and the heaviness of his vowels.
He goes over to the kettle and flips through the assortment of tea bags arranged in a neat little bowl. “Tea?”
He meets Sherlock at the address Billy supplied, and he looks as grim as John feels.
John smiles at him, small and warm and genuine. He leans over and presses a quick kiss to Sherlock’s lips, just a brush, just a reminder. “You know what? That’s actually enormously helpful.”
the look says, and the thing is, John
“It’s my fucking life, and my fucking decision,” John had ground out between clenched teeth. “And if you think I’m going to sit back and sip tea at Baker Street while you’re out there getting yourself killed, you know absolutely nothing about me whatsoever.”
Why aren’t you asleep? It’s three in the morning
I know, John. - SH
He puts down the violin. This won’t do.
“Cooking is a lot more varied than baking, after all,“ Molly jumps in, “Spices, meats, veggies, different textures and flavours, varying cooking times. Give me a nice, simple, straightforward Battenberg cake any day.”
The man sets down his cup of tea next to the hob and starts rummaging around in the drawers and cabinets of the work station next to Sherlock.
John presses the emergency communication button. “Hello? We’re stuck. Hello?”
Sherlock sneaks out and has a cigarette so he won’t murder anyone during reaction interviews.
They’re both exhausted. After two years of travelling and scheming and killing and being wounded and sick and cold and on the run, they’re wearing thin, both of them.
He collapses in a graceless heap on top of John, who’s sprawled bonelessly over the uncomfortable chair. John’s hands travel over Sherlock’s body, long, slow, almost petting touches that feel insanely good without being the least arousing. It should worry Sherlock, this fuzzy warmth, but right now he can’t be bothered. Right now the dopamine is in charge.
John's amusement fades into a warm glow of contentment. "Yes. I know."
Sherlock only grunts, bending further over his microscope. John sighs. “So, here, then?”
“This is really good,” John says as he blows on the half-eaten pasty in his hand. They’re really still too hot to eat, but neither of them wanted to wait any longer. John is wearing one of Sherlock’s aprons after taking off his sex-stained shirt. It’s currently drying over the radiator, and Sherlock is sort of dreading the moment it will be dry enough to wear, because then John will probably leave.
“Yes, she was,” John says with a wistful smile.
Methodically, trying hard not to think about what he’s doing, he loads one bullet into the gun, then spins the chamber and lets it slide back.
He needs to get help.
He hears the music as soon as he opens the door to 221 and freezes.
There are currently five contingency plans on hold for every possibility he can think of. If he dies, if he returns, if he doesn’t die and doesn’t return, if John is in danger, if they’re all in danger. What he doesn’t have a plan for, what he didn’t anticipate, is how he’s going to fix the damage he did to John. Because one look at his face on CCTV, pale, drawn and empty, has made Sherlock realise that what he witnessed the day he followed John to the cemetery, John barely holding himself together, begging for Sherlock to come back to him, wasn’t John’s lowest point, it was the start of his descent.
“Winning or losing what?” he asks, and it’s unfair, how John can just step into his head like that, with his fluffy jumper and his very blue eyes and center all of Sherlock’s thoughts on him.
“Me neither,” Sherlock admits. “But I’m sure now.”
“Docks. Watch’s already there. Some workers found her a few hours ago.”
Molly nods. “But he took a two-hour lunch, and when he came back, he was nearly incoherent. We sent him home after he was sick all over the crew bathroom.”
He’s halfway to the clinic when he realises he was supposed to meet Sarah - he checks his watch - an hour and thirty minutes ago.
“Changing the subject from your blatant public display of affection, I see,” Janine grouses, but she gets out of the way, letting John help her over the uneven, gravelly terrain of the car park which her stiletto heels make difficult to navigate.
This time, the tent for filming is set up outside a mansion turned hotel in West Sussex.
“Good to know you watch my YouTube channel,” he finally says, trying to sound offhand and dismissive.
Sherlock huffs a laugh under his breath and feels some of the tension dissipate. “That remains to be seen.”
“Fine, off you go.”
to help her.
“One,” Sherlock ticks off points with his fingers, “he knew something, or saw something, anyway he was a loose thread and a weak link. Two, to make sure every street urchin in this city knows the price of talking to us.”
The Berkshire mansion-turned-hotel that the producers have picked for this week of filming is surrounded by a lovely garden. Filming will take place in a large tent. Sherlock carefully picks his way over the mass of cables and equipment, carrying the plastic box with his utensils and special ingredients.
They’re both breathing hard, and John looks up at Sherlock, pupils dilated wide. Sherlock’s heart is pounding like he just ran a marathon.
Sherlock shrugs and takes a sip of his tea. It's a very nice herbal chai blend, and Sherlock enjoys the smell and the heat of the spices blooming behind his nose.
Sherlock clears his throat, and says, “You realise I now need to fake your death too, don’t you?”
Reaction interviews are quickly done, and then Sherlock goes to his room without a second glance to anyone. Especially not John.
“Obviously.”
John come apart.
Sherlock steps closer to the wall and feels the surface with his fingertips, then squints upwards. “Grappling hook,” he says, almost to himself, and points up. “See the scratch marks on the window sill? And the wall here is scratched. Somebody climbed up here.”
The entire episode of his return from the dead has shown impressively how very unfit he is for this. He’s the one who thought pranking his best friend after two years of letting him grieve was a good idea, after all. And Sherlock is terrified that he will do something similar again, that he will hurt John again, that this time, he will break something that can’t be repaired.
John shakes his head and grabs his arm. “Christ, Sherlock, you’re shaking. You’ll catch your death. Go home. I’ll talk to you later, all right? Just go home and get warm.”
"I can drop by and pick some up for you later."
Sherlock doesn’t even think about it. “Should I make it for you?”
“Sorry,” John says absently, pulling out his phone and checking for a signal. “Nothing. You?”
John's still watching Sherlock through the glass pane in the door. "Off how?"
He gets up and starts walking.

Together, they enter the waiting room.
“Before I make my decision,” Sherlock says, looking out at these seven people who all baked a cake, just for him. “I want to say thank you.” He looks at all of them in turn, and then his eyes settle on John. “These are all fantastic cakes, and you’re all amazing people, and if I win this, knowing that I’ve beaten all of you will make this mean even more.”
“What exactly is the point of this?” Sherlock asks, and if John didn’t know him so well, he would miss the wary vulnerability of the question. Sherlock
@robinsparkles
He wants his own bed; he wants a door that locks the world out. He wants Mrs Hudson downstairs and John upstairs and himself in the middle, sandwiched between people who care about him, maybe too much for their own good.
“Oh, I wish somebody had told you before, you poor boys. I thought Mr Lestrade might have mentioned it,” she frets, clearly upset. She looks at each of them in turn, sadness cutting deep lines into her soft, kind face. “The Gate has been closed for many years.”
John shakes his head, still smiling. “Idiot. Where else would I possibly be?”
John takes up the small lamp and some instruments and looks into Joe’s mouth. Sherlock looks at him, eyebrows raised, and John nods. Amalgam fillings.
Sherlock doesn’t blush. He doesn’t. Ever.
Sherlock smiles back automatically, feeling the rush of adrenaline flood his senses with the hyper awareness that usually comes when he’s on stage. John leans closer to him. “You remember the first day of rehearsal, when I said I’d moved on?”
Sherlock, predictably, hasn’t said a word since they left the Fey’a village, and John doesn’t blame him. He feels like his own head is about to explode, and he’s sure Sherlock’s far ahead of him, analysing facts and implications. So they walk back in companionable silence, and John tries to make sense of any of this on his own. Three things are clear to him. One, there’s a dangerous criminal on the loose who’s smuggling guns and people from their world into this one. Two, that dangerous criminal, supposedly one Jim Moran, is sitting on their only way home. Three, none of that will stop Sherlock.
She immediately starts checking over Sherlock’s wounds. “What happened?” she asks briskly but not unkindly.
Silence.
In retrospect he thinks he should have anticipated that if John knows he’s alive and well and on the hunt, the last thing John would want to be is in London, safe and sound.
Sherlock and John exchange a long glance, and finally, Sherlock gives an almost imperceptible nod. Might as well tell the truth, that nod seems to say, and John agrees.
“Wise words, and I think the perfect conclusion. Good luck.”
Mary frowns. “That… wasn’t me.”
Sherlock nods, once, and an ominous sense of foreboding settles in John’s guts.
Sherlock turns and looks. At first he can’t see what John is talking about, and then he can see a dim shadow slipping into the tent. “Only one way to find out,” he says, and sets off towards the tent.
with him. After weeks and weeks of all but throwing himself at John, finally John is flirting with him, playfully, with that devastating smile he has, with his hair flopping into his face and his black cargo pants and the gaffer tape slung into his belt, and how is this whole breathing thing supposed to work again? “I’ll wear them for you anytime,” Sherlock  says after he finds his breath again.
John nods.
Sherlock swallows and doesn’t say what he’s thinking,
She hesitates for a moment, then she asks, so quietly he almost doesn’t catch it, “Was Mummy sick?”
After a moment’s thought he gets a mug of tea - just milk, no sugar - from the cafeteria tent and sets it down next to the hot plates, just the way John did the last two shows.
John can feel the smile tug at his lips even as the thing in his chest twists, hard. “No.”
“Sherlock.”
“Doesn’t mean we can’t have dessert,” Sherlock says, hoping to get that expression off John’s face, that deflated, slightly self-conscious look.
It’s very obvious that John wants him to stay and this is the closest he can get to saying it. Sherlock nods, trying to hide his desperate relief. “Thank you.”
Sherlock grins. “Guess.”
“It was difficult to decide between Sherlock’s honey-glazed nuts and delicate dark chocolate and Molly’s caramel-peanut-crunch, but we’ll give it to Sherlock for this round, because his cookies had the best consistency all out.”
It’s two in the morning, and the fire escape door on their floor isn’t locked.
Take the cake out of the oven, fill it with raspberry jam and ice with a simple chocolate icing.
“Something stupid,” Sherlock answers with a grin. He opens Moriarty’s fridge, and the light that spills out illuminates John’s face. There’s something in his face that Sherlock recognises, adrenaline and excitement pushing down other, more complicated emotions.
The room is quiet and cozy in the dim light of John’s bedside lamp. Rosie’s bed is sitting in a corner opposite John’s. Some toys are lying around; John’s beige jumper is thrown haphazardly over the armchair by the window.
“Yes, but how do you judge between two equally good bakes? Personal taste. Take your filo strudel and my topfenstrudel. Both perfect bakes. The judges picked mine because they liked it more.”
“I did, didn’t I?” John says, and from the tone of his voice Sherlock can tell that he’s smiling.
And all the while, Sherlock thinks,
Lestrade is a very ordinary-looking man approaching middle age, with salt and pepper hair and a kindly face. The guardsman ushers Sherlock and John in with a few muttered words of explanation.
Sherlock raises a sceptical eyebrow. "Next you'll tell me it doesn't hurt that much."
“I don’t need luck. I’m not Sherlock.”
The room is relatively quiet as the bakers are working. With a glance, Sherlock sees many mistakes. Mike’s overworking his scones, they won’t rise. Anderson is putting too much baking powder into his savoury muffins. Janine’s ganache won’t set, and she’s frustratedly trying to fix it, but Sherlock already knows that she’s going to have to do something else. Mary is making savoury scones, and she’s grating the cheese on top, which will just make the scones greasy and the cheese will brown before the scones are done. She should have just put it in the batter.
, don’t you have a girlfriend, or don’t you have a boyfriend.”
Then Moriarty sucks in a breath and John turns his head, stomach sinking with dread as he sees Sherlock step into the clearing.
Sherlock walks to the guest room on autopilot, and collapses on the bed. He closes his eyes and thinks,
“That was the same director that gave me the less Hitler, more Stalin note,” Molly offers. “Fake moustaches.”
John is too tired for this conversation. “I’m going back to bed,” he says, and walks back upstairs.
John grins. “They call me One-Take-Watson.”
“It’s one thing we learned from the Fey’a,” Billy says with a grin. “They’re plenty adventurous when it comes to sex. Taught our ancestors a thing or two. You should see their sex books.” His grin widens. “I should get you one. Would close some of your knowledge gaps.”
Behind her, John stops working and looks up curiously.
Finally, the dark canopy of the trees seems lighter, and the trees aren’t quite so dense and close together. After about fifteen more minutes of the forest slowly tapering out, they finally step up to the tree line.
John rubs a hand over his face in frustration. “I’m responsible. These people are my crew, they look to me. I’m stage manager. I’ve been doing his job for months now.”
"London," John says, eyeing him suspiciously. "Why?"
Between re-setting the rehearsal room twice for the runs and actually sitting in on rehearsal, John hasn’t had a second to himself all day, and he’s enjoying five minutes of quiet in the green room while Sherlock is in the wardrobe department for his fitting with Sally, when Mary comes in and settles down next to him on the sofa.
Sherlock shakes his head, smiling. They were only in that elevator for about ninety minutes. It felt like half a lifetime.
John can feel Sherlock’s smile stretch against the back of John’s head. “History, John. Three thousand years of it. Three thousand years of plagues and political unrest and fire and religious persecution, of lost years and lost centuries and wars and famines. And we’re still here. Humans need art, John. They need to know that they’re not alone, that other human beings have experienced the exact emotion they’re going through. So I know for a fact that we’ll be back. We’ve been coming back for three thousand years. What’s eight months to that?”
John lies down on the bed and tries very, very hard not to think about what it would mean if the Gate was actually open. They could go home. Does he want that? Does Sherlock? Would he want to stay here without Sherlock?
The relief in the room is palpable, and the actors each go. Irene shrugs into her coat and leans down to Sherlock. “How about a coffee? Help you pass the time until your fitting? Maybe I could tag along to the fitting, even, give you my expert opinion?”
John clamps a hand over Billy’s mouth, completely sure he doesn’t want to hear the rest of that sentence. Billy laughs against his hand, and when John removes it, he laughs even more.
One of them speaks harshly to them in a language they don't understand.
Mary stays up in the lighting booth to set up for tomorrow, and John leaves her to it and goes down to the green room to pick up his stuff.
Sherlock comes home to Baker Street after 1500 days exactly, and John is gone.
"All right," Sherlock mutters, and John's arm tightens around him. "I'll stay."
John sighs deeply, tired and looking sad and a bit lost. “This is my last night here. I promised Mary I’d move back in tomorrow.”
“And if I’m not?” John asks, not bothering to keep the worry out of his voice. He knows Sherlock is well aware of his anxieties, and that they haven’t made him easy to live with during the last eight months. John feels a bit guilty about that, because Sherlock has been as unemployed as John. Worse, even, because while many stage crew were sent on furlough, most actors were dismissed outright. Sherlock has been doing some voice work, but mostly keeps busy with his experiments and his violin. But Sherlock doesn’t seem to miss the theatre with the all-consuming hollowness John has been experiencing. John knows that’s because acting is what Sherlock does for a living, it’s not who he is. But John is a stage manager. It’s an intrinsic part of his identity. Without it, without his crew and his actors and without the whirling machinery of a working theatre company around him, relying on him to keep it running, he’s been a bit lost.
“I was thinking of doing something with rosehip syrup. Maybe an apple-blackberry filling, sweetened with the syrup.” Sherlock leans back in his chair and ignores his half-finished pasties. He reaches for his cup of tea and drinks deeply. It’s oddly comfortable, sitting here with John. It almost feels like they’ve done this before, like this is a deeply familiar ritual and not a first time at all. Of course, the opposite is true, Sherlock has not only never had dinner with John in this kitchen, he has in fact never had dinner with anyone in this kitchen, nor in the kitchen upstairs, for that matter.
His therapist prescribes antidepressants. They help him sleep, at least.
“I want my violin.” Oh what he’d give to have it now, to put bow to strings and just let the music take him anywhere it pleases.
Sherlock scowls at his phone. “Only Mycroft trying to get me to actually work myself to death.”
Afterwards, just after Sherlock got out of the hospital, over breakfast, John asks what they’re going to do now, how they’re going to go after Moriarty.
Sherlock hums again, and he wishes he could say something, but there seems to be something lodged in his throat, and something else in his chest, because he feels constricted.
Sherlock backs John up against the counter, and all but lifts him up until John is sitting on it. Sherlock steps between his legs, and John hooks both legs around Sherlock’s and drags him in, slotting their hips together. They’re snogging and rubbing against each other like teenagers, sloppy and messy and oh so perfect. Sherlock finally gets John’s jumper off and tosses it aside, then drags greedy hands over John’s skin under his vest.
Sherlock smirks and stalks toward John, his focus narrowing on the spot on his neck that John missed when he was shaving this morning. “Ravenous,” he says and slings his arms around John, biting at his neck.
John takes out the phone and his glasses – Sherlock again resists the urge to pluck them off his face – and starts the app. He makes his first move – John always plays white, Sherlock always plays black – before handing the phone to Sherlock.
“John.”
“How many different ways do I need to tell you to stop talking? ” Sherlock snaps.
“I’m not going to take her word for it.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says and unceremoniously strips John of his jumper and his jeans, then straddles him and pushes his hands down into the mattress again. He looks down at John, whose half-hard cock is pressing against Sherlocks’ arse, all mussed hair and wiry strength, and thinks about all the things he wants to do to John, all the ways he wants to have him. He starts by pressing his mouth to that magnificent scar on John’s shoulder.
“No you’re not,” Sherlock mutters, trying to sound put out, but he knows he’s failing.
John grins, and the glint in his eyes slowly takes on a more mischievous note. “I’ve got an idea.”
She nods. “She was an angel. Dropped off over her bottle around eight and I haven’t heard a peep from her since.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, annoyed at the general uselessness of other people. He suddenly and viscerally misses John, who, Sherlock is sure, would know exactly what he’s missing here, and even if he didn’t, would distract Sherlock until he didn’t care anymore.
“I’ve made so many mistakes, I don’t even know where to start. Did you know I almost cheated on Mary?”
Slowly, carefully, he separates the eggs and makes a vanilla base. He caramelises some sugar and crumbles it into the souffle base, then he slowly, gently, carefully folds in the stiffened egg whites. He should do a video about what happens when you stir egg whites too much.
“There’s nothing wrong with your leg,” Sherlock says automatically, and then curses himself for an idiot, because John knows this, and pointing out the obvious is not helping. On the contrary, it will only make John defensive.
“Well, ladies and gentlemen, it seems the competition is getting tighter and the air on top is getting thinner.”
Sherlock’s on his side, facing John, who’s lying on his back, staring at the ceiling. Sherlock puts his hand on John’s shoulder, palm flat against the joint. “Please,” he says, one last effort. “I can’t watch you die. Please.”
“That offer he made us. Do you think it’s genuine?” John asks the question that’s been going around in his mind since the killer mentioned it.
John doesn’t hesitate. “We’ll prove it,” he says with conviction. “We’ll find Violet’s killer, we’ll find the Gate.”
The judges all stare at Moriarty as if he’s lost his mind, and most of the crew start shifting uncomfortably. “Are you honestly suggesting,” Moran starts, and his voice is deceptively calm, but anyone can see a tell-tale vein throb on his forehead, “that this panel is influenced by anything other than the quality of the baking presented to them?”
“All right,” he says, “let’s go back to the city and get to work. There has to be a way to get that Gate to open.”
“Sherlock, another double win. Congratulations, you’re shaping up to be a favourite.”
“Hey,” he nudges John with the back of his hand, and John turns to look at him.
Mycroft will never lend Sherlock the money. This hasn’t changed, and it will not change.
“How was that?” he asks, barely audibly.
John nods, indicating that he’s understood. He still has no idea what to say.
John laughs a bit, more breath than sound, but it’s a real laugh, and Sherlock smiles, because John is back from wherever he went, back in this kitchen, in his body, in the here and now.
And then Sherlock has an idea. It’s simple, and crazy, and the exact opposite of his original plan. And perhaps it’s the most selfish thing he’s ever done.
Wearily, John walks in and sits down. The doctor hands him a steaming mug and a slice of still warm buttered bread. “Oh, thank you,” he breathes and for a moment, the two adults watch him in silence as he eats and drinks.
“We haven’t moved,” Sherlock answers, not much louder. “But everything else has.”
“My present… is it a sex thing?”
Sherlock extricates himself less than politely from his uncle Robert and casually walks over to the little group. The two women are talking at John, and John looks like he’s listening politely, but Sherlock knows that look, and he knows that internally, John is naming all the bones in the human body right now to keep calm.
Sherlock is sitting on the sofa opposite, reading the book John fell asleep holding. He looks up and smiles. “Oh, good. Finally.” He tosses the book aside. “Boring. The killer's clearly the gardener. Are you done slamming into people while throwing around a ball?”
Finally, he finds a leg, and thankfully attached to it the rest of Sherlock. He’s unconscious, and there’s a piece of wood lodged in his shoulder. He’s bleeding.
Sherlock looks at John, the half-naked morning glory of him, the way the sun coming in through the kitchen window makes him almost glow with warmth, the way he smells of bed and coffee and sweat. He backs John up against the fridge and leans in for a kiss. John kisses back enthusiastically. Sherlock draws back a bit and mutters, “If you think for one second that you can walk out of here without a morning shag, you’re completely delusional.”
Sherlock smiles. He opens his eyes and turns around.
“Irene,” Lestrade says. “Can I talk to you for a sec?”
John takes the baby monitor and goes into the kitchen. Mary follows.
You should talk. I asked first
John turns to Mycroft, who is regarding the top of his umbrella with an expression of mild academic interest. He would like to pretend to be shocked by the revelation, but he just doesn’t have the energy.  “Why?”
And it’s horrible, and childish, and completely beneath him, but he enjoys being the only one. He relishes it. He’s proud of it.
“He’s not that bad, honestly,” John says, annoyed.
Now they’re sitting here, silently, until the waitress brings the tea and the chips. Sherlock pours for both of them, adds milk and sugar to his cup, stirs.
The facts are these: After he pulls the trigger on Moriarty’s bomb, several things happen simultaneously: First, the bomb explodes. Second, John pushes him into the pool. Third, four snipers open fire.
John swallows hard. He’d forgotten that goddamned voice. “Hello, Sherlock.” He smiles back, and he hopes it looks genuine. “Thanks for helping us out.”
Sherlock cares about him, but right now, for the first time, he isn't sure that's enough. He was sure before that Sherlock wouldn't try to go home without him, now he thinks maybe he was wrong. And the thought of losing Sherlock
“I’ve always thought so,” Sherlock says, and then the conversation dies, because the hosts and judges are entering the tent, and a hush falls over the contestants.
They chat for a bit longer, and Victor teases him about being on telly, and they part with a warm hug and a promise to stay in touch which Sherlock has no intention of keeping.
John grins wickedly. “My pleasure.”
“Yes,” he whispers against John’s lips. “Yes.”
And then. And then suddenly, abruptly, it all ground to a screeching, ugly halt. Suddenly, next to that darkened pool, a red dot on the explosives strapped to John, Sherlock stopped having fun. Suddenly, he saw this entire game for what it was, a sordid, crazy, obsessive mind-fuck, and he felt neither exhilarated nor challenged, but sick and tired. Because from one second to the next, Sherlock realized that in this game he actually had something to lose. And suddenly, he didn’t want to play anymore. He just wanted it to be over. He wanted to rip that bomb vest off John; he wanted to shoot Moriarty in the face. Fuck the game, fuck the plans, fuck winning or losing or figuring out Moriarty’s plans, he just wanted to grab John and run.
John snorts, incredulous. “You don’t honestly believe that Sherlock would just have let Mrs Hudson die, do you?”
“I did.”
Then he goes upstairs, carrying a plate with a piece of the still warm strudel. It’s the last piece, they sold out thirty minutes ago.
“Yes?” John’s voice is quiet and low, as if he’s detected Sherlock’s sudden turn for the serious.
Sherlock has rarely needed a cigarette more than he does right now, so he bypasses the busy pub and goes straight outside, where he’s sure he will find a smoker he can bum one from.
“It can be used to find pathways between worlds,” the Midnight Queen explains. “In the wrong hands, it can be used to find and open another Gate. And that's the last thing we wanted.”
Sherlock adds silently.
He tries to think of a plan. A script, of sorts. How he wants this encounter to go.
Moriarty smiles at Sherlock, smarmy, insinuating, knowing, so knowing, knowing exactly where to hit to do the most damage, and Sherlock has never hated anyone the way he hates Jim right now. “He won’t run,” Jim says, voice dripping disdain. “He’ll never run. It’s his weakness. He
is to get high. Always. So I can’t trust what I want. I have to make decisions based on cold, hard facts. Fact: I barely know you.” He ticks off points with his fingers.  “Fact: I’m perfectly fine on my own. Fact: I will need all my time and attention for my new business, when I finally get it off the ground. Fact:I don’t need you for anything of objective, practical value. So the smart thing, the logical thing, is to just walk away.”
Again.
John’s also less handsome than any other man Sherlock’s ever had in his bed, but none of them ever affected Sherlock the way John does, it was never more than a fleeting distraction, and with John it’s immediate and all-consuming and real. And it isn’t that, objectively, the sex is better, it’s something else entirely, and Sherlock can’t figure out what that something else
The kettle clicks off and Sherlock pours hot water over the tea bags. He notices the cane hanging from the oven door when John opens it and puts the scones in to bake. John sets the timer and accepts the tea from Sherlock.
“And then what happened?” Sherlock presses her to continue.
Victor winces a bit. “Um. About that.”
Lestrade rubs a hand over his face. “So, you snuck into the Forest to camp next to the gate you came through which just happened to burst into flame next to you the exact time you were there.”
Slowly, carefully, he takes stock of his physical state. Somebody had pulled his shoes off and removed his jacket before depositing him on the bed in his pants and shirtsleeves. His head hurts. There’s an IV line on his left arm, leading to two empty IV bags over his bed. The labels point to saline solution and glucose, which tell him two things: One, he’s been unconscious for a while, and two, John is here.
John turns his head and stares at Mycroft, incredulous, but Mycroft holds out a hand to stop him from interrupting. “It was imperative for you to believe it. If you hadn’t, the plan wouldn’t have worked. You’re a horrible liar, John. For the life of you, you couldn’t pretend to be something that you’re not. It’s one of the reasons my brother appreciates your company, but it also necessitated your deception. Anyone who looked at you instantly believed my brother was dead.”
There’s a pause, and John rolls to his side and looks at Sherlock, then he says quietly, “But you shouldn’t have done it.”
John shrugs. “You didn’t, not
Rewind.
“Then we do it again until something happens, or until we’re sure nothing’s going to happen,” Sherlock answers without hesitation.
He’s sure that some of the deep-seated longing he feels must show on his face, because John smiles at him, gentle and warm. “You’re getting freckles again,” John says, voice low and fond.
looks that always make John feel incredibly special. It’s not an easy thing, capturing Sherlock Holmes’ full attention.
John shrugs and goes to the fridge for milk. “Getting shot.” He comes back and adds a splash of milk to Sherlock’s tea. “Boring, really,” he adds with a self-deprecating smile that doesn’t reach his eyes as he hands Sherlock his tea.
Sherlock snorts with amusement. “If I tell you what I’m doing, it will spoil the outcome.”
John closes his eyes and winces as Molly tightens the bandages. "I think he might feel responsible. God knows I do. We couldn't help her."
It's that last thought that scares John.
“Welcome to Week Two of British Bake Off!”
Part of it is that John is a walking contradiction, and Sherlock is one of the very, very few people who know just how entirely damaged John is. And the most brilliant thing about him is that nobody could tell by looking at him, especially now that he’s shed the limp. John looks normal, he sounds and behaves normal, but he isn’t. He’s an addict and a hunter, and at the same time he’s capable of a deep and sincere empathy, he’s highly moral and he kills without a second thought, he’s a doctor and a weapon, he’s the still waters that are deeper than any ocean and wilder than any storm. He knows Sherlock’s darker sides and he likes him anyway.
Sherlock takes a few steps towards the clearing and then he steps onto a stone and there's a loud clicking, and then the world explodes.
The Municipal Museum is an ordinary-looking two-story building. They're lucky the museum is open, because its opening hours are eclectic, to put it mildly. They're also the only two people in there, which is a pity because the museum is surprisingly fascinating.
John takes the second chair across from Mrs Hudson’s desk. “We’ve got rehearsal in an hour and I have to set up. I don’t have time for pleasantries.”
“Oh, I would, don’t get me wrong. You’re rather pedestrian and boring, and I have enough little helpers to do my dirty work,” Jim says, crouching down so they’re at eye-level. His odd voice is almost hypnotic, and he’s not even trying to hide the Irish lilt now. “But Sherlock, on the other hand…”
“We should go on,” Sherlock finally says.
Rest the dough in the refrigerator. Slice pears, some peaches, butter into the pan, add the fruit. Cinnamon stick. Muscovado sugar to get a nice caramel.
“While we’re at shaking things up, how about some sexual tension?” Irene asks, giving Sherlock an insinuating smile.
Finally, she is calm and he is calm and he can put her back in her crib. He switches on the baby monitor and takes another look at her peaceful face.
John turns back. “Yes?”
John knows he won’t get Sherlock to see the point (murders aren’t ever dull for the people involved) and moves on. “What about Grimey Joe?”
“Please,” Sherlock snorts. “First of all, you don’t count, you’ve got Scottish blood in you somewhere, so you’re biased. Second, skon is just completely illogical. The closest word to scone is pronounced cone, not con, what about the s changes the entirety of the rest of the word?”
That night, they lie next to each other on another too-small, rickety bed. John isn’t sleeping because he’s in pain, and Sherlock isn’t sleeping because John isn’t sleeping.
Sherlock listens to Rosie’s breaths even out, and when he’s sure she’s asleep, he goes into the bathroom for paracetamol, a glass of water, and the thermometer.
Sherlock accedes and rings off, feeling oddly relieved. Maybe John is right. Maybe he doesn’t have to do this alone.
John sits back down and looks at his hands, and Sherlock knows that he’s trying not to smile, and that in turn makes it difficult for Sherlock not to smile.
“Boring. Try this.” He thrusts one of the mini-quiches into John’s hand.
Sherlock nods. That’s fair enough. “I spend so much of my life bored out of my skull, my mind racing and turning on itself if it isn’t constantly engaged. Moriarty wasn’t boring. Not once.”
John turns his head to give him a small self-deprecating smile. “I was just thinking of what it would take for me to trust Harry again. If she stopped drinking right now. How long she would have to be sober for me to believe it.”
John wishes he could break it, but he has absolutely no idea how. Talking about the kiss seems impossible, but John realises they don’t have to. There’s plenty of things going on that are, in the grand scheme of things, much more important than a few seconds of kissing. (Though if he’s entirely honest with himself, a few seconds of kissing feel momentous right now).
Holmes looks at John for a long time in silence, and John has the uncomfortable feeling that he’s being studied, his character being measured and weighed. Then Holmes nods at the other side of the table and says, “That’s what I’m trying to find out.”
There’s a long silence, and then Sherlock says, quietly, “I only ever thought about what I don’t want. I don’t want Whitehall, I don’t want an office and a club and meetings and parties.”
The judging is so boring that Sherlock almost falls asleep. None of the cakes are horrible, and most are competently made. Janine’s is too pink, and Neela’s is a bit on the flat side, but neither is a catastrophe. Moriarty’s is a textbook example of mathematical precision, but the judges award the prize to Irene, because hers tastes the best. Sherlock is pretty sure Irene must have done something to improve the classic recipe, and when he tastes her cake, he can tell that she added some lemon zest to the recipe and spiked the apricot jam with rum. It’s subtle, but he can taste traces of it.
Sherlock gives him a small smile, realising that that’s his cue to leave. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then.”
It’s freezing in the kitchen. “You think it would be all right if I made some tea?” John asks.
And yet, ever since he met John, Sherlock’s self-perception has been filtered through the eyes of John Watson, for the simple reason that whatever else was going on, Sherlock was sure that John cared for Sherlock in a way that other people never have. John saw something in Sherlock worth loving. Even when he came back, Sherlock knew that John was angry because he loved Sherlock. Now, for the first time, that certainty is shaken. And the absence of that bedrock has shaken Sherlock to the core. It shouldn’t have, rationally. But it did.
“Terrific,” Sherlock lies.
The day is a typical first day on stage. A nightmare.
So John explains about Violet Jones and how she got here, and that they wanted to see for themselves whether the Gate is open or not.
Sherlock lifts his gaze from the tabletop at the tone in Victor’s voice, incredulous and kind.
He wants to snog on their couch. He wants to sleep in his own bed with John for the first time.
Adriana’s leaning next to him, slightly green in the face. “Fucking hell, I have to do this every night for the next six weeks.”
When he wakes up the sun is shining brightly into their room. He checks his watch and curses, because his clinic shift started two hours ago. Also, every inch of his body hurts.
Sherlock finds that he has nothing to say to that, and he’s saved from having to come up with an answer by Emma calling them into the tent to film the judging.
For a few moments, silence falls, and Sherlock drifts pleasantly on the edges of sleep.
“It’s delicious,” Mr Chatterjee says, then takes another sip of his tea. “Is it odd, baking on telly?”
Sarah looks at him critically. “You look completely overwhelmed by life.”
Sherlock turns the photograph around and nods thoughtfully. “It makes a certain amount of sense, I suppose,” he mutters, striding over to his blackboard and picking up the chalk. He scribbles out formulae and murmurs nonsense words to himself.
“Thank god it’s not the blackberry, that stains like crazy. There’s a cushion on the sofa that’s still stained even though I washed it three times.”
Sherlock doesn’t even try to pretend he isn’t distracted, and doesn’t even bother answering Mycroft.
The rush fades as quickly as it has come, and Sherlock lets John go immediately and backs up a few steps. He’s reminded that when you jump off high buildings, things get broken. Things that aren’t replaceable. He feels nauseous and his head is spinning.
When John tells him it’s dinner time, he doesn’t even look up. So John has dinner with Mrs. Hudson alone, as he has so often.
John sighs and rubs a hand over his face. “My own fault for having a conversation like this before breakfast,” he mutters, more to himself than to Sherlock. “My point, Sherlock, is this,” he says, slowly and with exaggerated patience, “We had what I thought of as very, very good sex. After which you left. And I would like to know why. I was under the impression that you had a good time last night?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Obviously, it's not because I have a car and wanted to offer you a lift, it’s because I intend to murder you and grind down your corpse for pie fillings."
John is out of bed with his gun in his hands in two seconds flat.
“She should. He can’t do his job. This isn’t her Friday lunch club, it’s irrelevant whether she likes him or not. This is business.”
Then Mary calls from the auditorium, and the moment breaks like glass. “I need to go,” John says, gesturing at the stage. “Lights.”
He looks up at Sherlock. “Did you tell Lestrade?”
“A little after five.”
he thinks.
They step into a clearing that’s so abrupt and perfectly round as though someone had cut off the forest with a sharp-edged knife. Suddenly, abruptly, the humming stops.
“Our bakers have five challenges to prepare. First, two kinds of biscuits. Second, twelve mince pies. Third, Christmas pudding. Fourth, a savoury Christmas pie, and last but not least, a perfect Christmas dessert.”
It’s the middle of the night, and it’s been ten days since he’s last spoken to John. His calls go to voicemail, his texts go unanswered. The blog is gone. The email has been deleted.
And now it’s morning, and John has gone off in search of coffee, and Sherlock is having trouble remembering what he wanted to do for his bake today. Bread is boring at the best of times, but right now he has no desire to stand around an overheated tent literally waiting for bread to prove for four hours.
Sherlock shudders imperceptibly. How can John even ask that, when Moriarty all but unzipped Sherlock’s chest and said
Sherlock is bored, bored, bored. Victoria sponges are so ridiculously easy that he has to restrain himself not to add to the cake mixture. They won’t be allowed much wiggle room, the judges have asked for a classic Victoria sponge, and there isn’t much he can do to make that recipe more exciting. He uses his vanilla-infused sugar for the sponge and uses lime zest as well as lemon, and he adds a bit of the lime zest to the whipped cream filling. He uses his own raspberry-strawberry jam, but none of that makes baking two simple sponges and then popping them together with whipped cream in any way a challenge.
John collapses against Sherlock, and for long minutes, they’re just sitting there, cold earth beneath them forgotten, breathing hard and trying to catch their breath.
He doesn’t even know how it happens. He’s usually so careful, especially now that he can’t walk very fast. But this time, he just steps into the street and doesn’t look for cars.
John tunes him out and helps himself to mashed potatoes and ham.
“Chemical reaction?” John frowns.
“Come back to bed,” Sherlock mutters. “I’m freezing my bollocks off.”
He turns to Sherlock, and he looks so lost for a moment that Sherlock wants to press their bodies together and hold onto John until he feels better, and it’s so far removed from the dizzying lust he felt not five minutes ago that he experiences something not unlike emotional whiplash.
The room is dark and quiet, but the kitchen light over the sink is on, and he can just make out Sherlock’s silhouette bent over the microscope in the kitchen.
Mike makes a face. “I’ve been stage manager for 30 years, John, I don’t need you to explain my job to me.”
Sherlock looks directly into the camera and smiles. “Come by and find out. And follow me on Instagram for updates on the opening date.”
“Look,” Harriet says, and something about her tone makes Sherlock look up and take the concern on her face seriously. “He’s… I won’t say that he’s too good for you, even though we both know that’s true. But the simple fact is that you’re bad for him. You’re very, very bad for him. So please, stay away. Let him go.”
John sits up on his elbows and motions Sherlock closer. Sherlock leans down, and John mutters conspiratorially. “I’ll tell you a secret: I wanted you to like me too.”
He turns around and sets his stuff down, then walks back the few steps towards the bench.
John knows he can never forget Kitty, lying there in that abandoned warehouse. He just wishes he was equally sure about Sherlock.
“Show-off,” John mutters fondly from the next station, and Mrs Hudson chuckles.
Sherlock thinks, running his fingers over the bumps of John’s spine.
“This is absurd.”
between them, something electric and dangerous and possibly fantastic, something that has the potential to make them into so much more or wreck them completely, something they both might want.
Sherlock comes so hard his knees buckle.
There’s a soft, nearly whimpering sound, and Sherlock is shocked to notice it’s coming from him, and then he leans his head forward into John’s chest, into one of his hideous jumpers, and just breathes John in, the warmth of him, the tea-doctor-home smell of him.
“Maybe,” Sherlock answers. “But I hurt you far worse, and you forgave me anyway.”
“How about Moriarty? He blamed you for the accident with the eggs, and said the way you and John sniggered you must have had something to do with it.”
Molly smiles at him compassionately. “You need to figure that one out on your own, I’m afraid.” She lays a hand on his arm. “I just wanted to make sure you know it’s all right to ask yourself that question.”
Sherlock was right, of course. She was poor, lived by the river and made her living by cleaning and taking in washing.
He makes it three steps up the stairs, then all the fight leaves him and he sits down, surrendering to the panic.
Sent: 5:16 am
John sits down on the steps next to him. “Anderson is an idiot,” he says conversationally.
“Don’t do this to me, all right?” John says quietly, holding Sherlock’s gaze. “Don’t check out and leave me alone in this mess, all right? Hell, Sherlock, I’m going to have a daughter, and I need you around to help me put the fear of God into her future boyfriends, all right? Whatever you tried to do with that stupid drug trip, it’s not worth it. Moriarty isn’t worth it, he wasn’t worth it the first time, he isn’t worth it now. I can’t…” John’s voice breaks a little, and he continues in a near whisper, “I can’t do this alone. Any of this.”
Then he notices the jam-crusted small handprint on Sherlock’s dressing gown and a small laugh escapes him.
“Oh my god, the mouse!” Molly turns to the others. “We had this director who wanted an actual white mouse for the photoshoot for the promotional material, and so I phoned our local pet store and asked them whether they had any white mice. Yes, ok, so can I rent one? And the clerk just hung up on me.”
It’s cold in the desert at night.
Then he sleeps dreamlessly until morning.
Before John moved in, Sherlock also figured out that the advantages of living with a doctor would outweigh the disadvantages. In the equation of excellent emergency care versus a possibly annoying habit of inquiring somewhat too closely into his substance use, the former won simply because Sherlock has discovered that people can never tell whether he’s high or just unusually stimulated by a problem.
John laughs. “I think Sherlock would be horribly disappointed in me if I did,” he says, grinning at Sherlock.
John looks at him like he’s lost his mind. “I need to get dressed. I need to be at the theatre in two hours, I’m calling the show tonight.”
John shakes his head, now sure he’s blushing.
John smiles at him, squeezing his hand, and Sherlock nods, and together they go into the house.
Laughter.
Sherlock is looking at him oddly, but John doesn’t have time to parse this right now. “Listen, I need to get to the theatre and fix that bloody light. I’ll call Janine, and then we can go.”
Sherlock is woken up by the sun shining into his bedroom window. He turns to his side and contemplates the sleeping John Watson in his bed. John is curled on his side, hand under his pillow, the other hand resting casually on Sherlock’s arm. Finally, he decides against waking John up by rolling him onto his back and kissing down his chest and following that enticing, almost irresistible trail of hair from his navel down to where his morning erection is straining his boxers.
“I was being informative,” Sherlock says, but he can’t quite bite down on a smile.
Also, I admit that I had a difficult time finding out exactly how and when theatres were/are closed down in the UK, so I extrapolated from what it's like where I live. Sorry if this is not factually accurate, I can only hope it's emotionally accurate.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say to that, so he decides to change the subject. “John, you’re exhausted. You need to get some sleep.”
After that, the crew film him baking scones, and manage to linger until they’re done, and Sherlock sends them off with a scone each and a sigh of relief.
“I forgot my phone charger. Just here to pick it up,” Sherlock says and turns to go into the dressing room without another word.
Mrs Hudson looks over to Sherlock, who’s concentrating on his own dough. “And you, Sherlock? How are you doing?”
John is distributing pizza slices from a few open boxes on the kitchen counter. He smiles at Sherlock when he enters the kitchen. “Salami, mushroom, ham or double cheese?”
"Never heard of it," Sherlock says and picks up his box again. "Do you want me to drop you off somewhere or not?"
John can’t. Can’t do any of this right now.
John smiles at him, a soft, embarrassed, warm little smile, entirely private. “Sorry I fell asleep on you.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Her father is human. Obviously.”
He turns his head and looks at Sherlock, who’s sitting on the floor, cross-legged, staring at a broken-down blackboard he carried up to their room a few days ago. It’s plastered with ripped-out pages of books, notes in Sherlock’s messy handwriting, newspaper articles, diagrams and maps. It contains every scrap of information about the Gates they’ve been able to gather during the two months they’ve been here.
Are you going to arrest me for not measuring my raisins? The thing is, I wouldn’t put it past you.
"What happened to you?" she asks as he removes his shirt. She winces sympathetically when he lifts up his under-shirt to show her the reddened marks from the kicks that are slowly turning purplish-blue.
“That’s my tea,” he finally says, lamely. “I… just… I wanted it out of the way.”
Is it his duty to try to return so he can die for King and Country, like he always thought was his destiny? Or is the fact that it looks like they’re stuck here his guilt-free escape?
John's blood goes cold. There's something in the tone of Sherlock's voice he hasn't heard in a long time. “All right. Let's go.”
John checks caller ID with a frown and answers. “John Watson speaking.”
The lodestone spins for a while, then points into the fog. “North?” Sherlock asks.
John looks at him like he’s crazy, and not in the good, stomach-tingling way. “No.” He leaves the
“Yes, yes, sorry, I didn’t mean to call you fat or anything,” John says, the eye-roll obvious in his voice.
“That’s because you’re an idiot,” Sherlock answers and moves in for another kiss. Then he draws back and takes John’s hand. “Now come help me pick out Christmas presents for my horrid parents.”
“Anything else?”
The first bullet grazes his hip, but the second one gets lodged in his arm.
“Holmes told us to be on the lookout for a bloke, over six foot, odd boots, left-handed, sounds a bit like you two, like he’s not from here.”
It’s all uncomfortable, but bearable.

“I know, I know, it’s…” He runs a hand through his hair. “We-” He sighs. “There’s just so much happening right now. You remember the girl that was found when the house collapsed? Her friend was found dead yesterday.”
He should have won. Why didn’t he win? His bake was objectively perfect. There was nothing he could have done better.
John nods into the darkness. “All right. Just in case.”
Sherlock doesn’t quite know how to answer that, and he doesn’t quite know whether he wants to answer that. The place behind his breastbone is burning and knotting and doing a very impressive flip, and he has trouble breathing suddenly, so he just kisses John and grinds their hips together, and everything he doesn’t want to say gets lost in the heat of skin on skin.
“It sounded like a tedious mess,” Sherlock snaps, but when Emma just looks at her watch and makes a move for him to get on with it, he sighs and says, “I thought it would be a good opportunity to get more people to care about baking.”
Sherlock hides his face in his pillow to muffle his laughter. “Yours,” he finally gasps out. “I think.”
“Good morning?” John offers, suddenly unsure. “Is it alright if I sit here? I can leave again if you prefer.”
That’s the moment he realizes he’s way more screwed up than he thought he was.
John pauses, and Sherlock wonders whether he should say something. But John continues before he can make up his mind. “Last night…” Sherlock can feel John press his lips together against Sherlock’s skin, can feel the tremor of emotion that runs through his body. “She said she wasn’t drunk. She said she slipped. Fell into her glass couch table. She needed thirty-nine stitches.” John sighs, and Sherlock can feel his exhaustion in every movement of his body. “It wasn’t the first time she hurt herself while drunk. But it was the worst, so far. And I...I just. I can’t do this anymore. But I can’t not do it either.”
His father nods his agreement. “Good work, son. Admittedly we’re not sure why you took this job, but it will give your reputation within the theatre community a boost, saving a production like this.”
a bit, and how is Sherlock supposed to handle this?
“Who’s Janine?” Sherlock asks, confused.
“You used to take them home and dissect them, and leave parts of them all over my fridge, if I remember correctly. I found pieces of these damned things for months after you left,” John interjects, and he means it to sound annoyed, but it comes out wistful, and he hates himself a little for it.
Mycroft gives him a long look, which Sherlock returns without blinking. Then Mycroft sighs his long-suffering elder brother sigh and gets up. “Call Mummy.”
John isn’t sure what woke him up. He lies in the comfortable, familiar darkness of his room and listens to the sound of 221B. Light traffic even at this late hour. Mrs Hudson’s grandfather clock in the landing. Sherlock rustling downstairs. Again.
Set between Chapter 6 and the epilogue of Take Two
He has the distinct impression that he’s the only one Sherlock has ever genuinely liked back.
“Well, maybe you’ll listen to
“He’s a show pony without substance. His Victoria sponge was amateurish.”
“Welcome to the first ever British Bake Off. With us here are 12 contestants fighting for the crown of Britain’s best amateur baker.”
“Forgive me, Ya’ra,” John says, sticking to English as he doesn’t trust his Feyara. “Why are we here?”
The lorry is big and fast and the passer-by who grabs him and pulls him back before he gets hit by six solid tons of moving metal is the only thing that saves him from becoming road kill.
