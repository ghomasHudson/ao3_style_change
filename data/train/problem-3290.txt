Cas is going to kill him.
Jack’s eyes are bright. “You were always Castiel’s.”
Not much room for hunting, in all that.
“Oh, so it’s alright when you do it?” growls Dean, and gestures at the general mind-fuckery of the Empty, the everlasting emptiness Cas had resigned himself to. “What do you call this, if it’s not ‘self-sacrificial’?”
” demands Cas, and Dean winces, but it isn’t enough to let him escape from the fury, because Cas whirls on him in an instant. “You let him do this? He’s three, Dean!”

Trust Sam to latch onto the practical side of things. Cas rests his hands on knees, thumbs twiddling, and Dean wonders if maybe this
“Sorry,” says Cas.
, and there’s the spare room, couch and a couple of air mattresses up for grabs, too. Jack’s already dibsed one of them by passing out on it a couple of hours ago, noise from the middle-aged weirdos be damned. Claire grumbles about being given the other one, but she’s young and tough and doesn’t have joints that creak, so she’ll be fine. She pauses in front of Cas in the kitchen, so uncomfortable it radiates off her.
Dean has seen, obviously, ghosts before. Hell, he’s even seen Bobby’s face walking around on his Apocalypse World counterpart, so it shouldn’t really be a shock. But— maybe Cas has a point, when he talks about seeing souls. Because— it’s Bobby, alright.
“Shut up,” says Dean, and scratches the back of his neck. “Okay, it— fine. You know how, uh. Well. Look. You remember Benny?”
It actually
Still, though; it’s nice. It’s really nice, actually. Sam calls Jody and asks her to get her butt over here, and she shows up with Claire in tow, which is good, because the last time Dean saw her he was drunk and Claire was beating up one of Bobby’s old car wrecks. The aftermath of Cas’ death wasn’t a good time for anyone.
He decides pretty quickly that the Empty sucks.
, and Dean’s not— he
“Too easy,” she says, and Sam grins down at the top of her head, and it’s— well, honestly, it’s cute. They’re cute.
Cas beams, a stupidly happy expression on his face, eyes wet and so, so
“Thanks, Jack,” says Dean, in a rare occasion of making good on what he’s thinking, even though Jack can’t hear it. He knows what he’s supposed to do, so he squares his shoulders and bangs hard on the door. “Bobby, open up!”
me? I’m bearing my fucking soul here, dude.”
“Of course,” Cas says. “We’ll be here.”
. He didn’t think he’d be proposing through
, and Dean better give him something back for it right freaking
Dean laughs.
Like hell. Dean’s not stupid, he hears the tiny inflection at the end of that sentence. Yeah, Jack’ll probably be fine if Dean elects to throw that thing in the back of his top drawer, never to be seen again until Christmas, but he’ll be better if Dean puts the stupid thing on. And
. That’s something, alright. Bobby’s quiet a long while, Dean’s stomach tearing itself to shreds.
. “I— you can’t— that’s not the point, man. I can’t be your— your exception, or whatever. I’m not worth that.”
“Oh,” he says. Cas continues.
, this time.”
of Dean, because he was too goddamn stubborn to leave him in the Empty, and Cas is all about sacrificing himself to save him. The idiot.
going to have to think about the implications, and Dean hates implications like nothing else.
His brow suddenly furrows, and his eyes come back to Dean, who tries valiantly to hold back a wince, keeping his face blank.
“Yeah, and I’m waiting.”
He gives them all a toothy grin, and Dean’s chest clenches around his heart.
“It means that even if I had had longer to consider it, my choice would have remained the same. Prior to my deal with the Empty, I always intended, grace or no, to spend a human life with you, if I could. With all of you. My grace was a small price to pay, in comparison.”
Dean opens his mouth to respond to that, but the footsteps hit his ears before he can get the words out, and he falters.
“Yeah? I dunno? What the hell are you talking about?”
, he fucking

“It is weird,” he admits, and Dean can recognise that this is Bobby trying to make him feel better, open up himself so that Dean doesn’t feel so exposed, “seein’ you and Sam all grown up. I already missed so much of your lives, and now there’s a near decade to catch up on.”
Sam huffs out a laugh. “Yeah, me neither. But I guess I just— all that stuff I did with Rowena, I wanna use it, you know? We’ve got all this knowledge back at the bunker, all this lore, and I think it could help a lot of people. Maybe create some kind of hunter network, like the Roadhouse used to be. Might be something for Ellen and Jo, too.”
“I can see the grief plaguing it, Dean,” continues Cas, soft. “It’s pained, and battered, more so than when I last saw you. Damage has been wrought on it.”
. His family’s alive and they’re all under one roof.
demands Dean, and gestures so violently that tea sloshes over the rim of the mug, over his hand and leg. He swears, and puts it down to the side. “It’s old fucking news, okay?”
He takes a perverse pleasure in the way that shuts Cas up, his jaw snapping shut and face going blank, absolutely blindsided. Dean scowls.
has he been sitting on
Granted, Cas probably wouldn’t do it so often if Dean didn’t melt like a happy cat in the sun every time, but fucking fight him, man. It’s embarrassingly nice, to be touched.
“Sam already did,” says Cas, “while you were sleeping in the car.”
Cas takes a while to think it over, but what Dean’s really asking, of course, is
“I warned you,” Cas says, his fingertips brushing Dean’s forehead, brow pinched like Meg Ryan. Dean feels the spark of grace and his headache eases a little, though the ringing is going to
He clicks his fingers, and the tell-tale thunk of the front door opening echoes down to where they sit, the sound reverberating around the too-empty bunker. Probably Dean should been concerned about the fact that the warding just
“You too,” says the girl, and that’s that. Dean made a choice. Great. He fought God himself for free will, and he’s using it to buy
“That wasn’t what happened,” he says, but it comes out a little uncertain, a little ragged. He grits his teeth, ramps up the bravado. “Sam—”
, recently, when he isn’t being a fucking dreamboat and the nicest person in the world, and all. And yeah, fine, it’s fair, because Dean broke his stupid heart or whatever, but
It pulls a surprised noise out of Cas, one Dean’s going to keep chasing from now until forever, and so he does the only logical thing, and winds his arms round Cas’ neck, grip sure and certain because like
“Maybe,” Dean says, because it’s easier. “I dunno. Cas and I are— it’s complicated. Kinda. He’s making it complicated.” Dean has a sudden burst of courage, the need to tell at least
move. Dean pretends not to see.
“Yes,” says Cas, and Dean stabs him in the heart.
“That’s why I didn’t— I needed you here, to get you in. The Empty can’t reach Earth unless summoned, you had to enter it through Heaven. It was the only way and that’s why I— that’s why I couldn’t move the rebar. I’m sorry.”
“Ah,” says Dean. He thinks that’s embarrassment, that he’s feeling. His hands feel hot. He casts his mind back to Purgatory, to that prayer he sent out on his knees, and yeah. Dean was in love with him, there. He’s starting to think he always has been.
sense? Dean’s driving himself in fucking circles.
Jo and Ellen have their own car, so they split up for the drive back, Baby leading the way and the two of them following behind. It’s almost anti-climactic, in a way, because it’s just a drive, even though Dean’s pretty damn stoked to be heading home. The most eventful thing is that Dean finds out that Jack is
“Yeah, alright,” says Dean. “Sorry, kid. You’re fine, no foul. I’m just being a dick.”
“Yeah, I know,” he says, which is kind of a miracle. He squeezes Cas’ hand, looks over to meet his eye. “You know the same goes, right?”
As if the free will shit wasn’t terrifying enough.
“Jesus,” says Dean. “You and Claire are gonna be a nightmare.”
. Dean is such an idiot.
Dean did
“Although,” he says, “I suppose there are some benefits.”
, thinks Dean, so Cas’ house has to be somewhere else. He can work with that.
logo on Cas’ front. “You should have some clothes of your own. Let’s get that sorted.”
Dean stares very intently at the highway as the silence stretches on. He should have kept his damn mouth shut.
Cas is unblinking, but Dean forces himself to wait him out, because he’s a stubborn son of a bitch and Cas is either going to come with him or have to throw Dean out the portal himself, and Dean sure as hell
and reminds himself that he’s killed people and no one’s gonna fuck with him. They do a family trip to Sam and Cas’ organic market and Dean catches the old lady at the soap stall looking at it, smile tugging at her lips.
, thinks Dean. He definitely feels a normal way about this. His mouth is a little dry.
When he pulls his gaze up from the page, Cas is concerned, a wrinkle between his eyebrows that Dean instinctively wants to smooth away.
he doing? Dean squints at it, and then realises Cas is freaking
And it is. Now it’s just life.
“Hello,” Cas says, because he’s still got that freaky sixth sense attuned to Dean, and pulls the exact same move once he’s wandered over. The plastic beads press against Dean’s ear. He is not going to cry, because that’s dumb, but he sags against the sink and lets Cas kiss him in greeting, free hand white-knuckling the counter top.
“I know,” says Cas.
“And why’d you do it? Huh? Why’d you have to save me?”
“Hey, come on, sleepyhead.” Urgh, god, he sounds all choked up. He swallows and it doesn’t help at all. “You’re not gonna give your— not gonna give your wife a kiss g’morning?”
“That what’s bothering you? Me seein’ your life as it is?”
“Oh,” Jack says, and sends Dean a small grin. “Castiel’s here.”
That’s stupid, obviously. He can’t be jealous of his own
“Do you wanna talk about it?”
On hunts, Dean has to be pretty aware of his surroundings. He catalogues threats, he pays attention to who’s nearby, just in case one of them turns out to be a monster. He spends the whole trip to the store hyper-aware of the freaking
again. Everyone’s back, God’s dealt with, and Dean’s actually got some time to freaking
Dean reaches out and puts his hand on Cas’ chest, over his heart. His own is beating
“I am mostly human, now,” says Cas, in dry amusement. Dean watches his face, grinning. “Consuming that much alcohol appears unwise.”
“I meant it, you know,” Dean had said, quiet-like. Cas’ chest was hot under his hand, kind of clammy from sweat, not that that was acting as a deterrent. Cas hummed. “I want you to be happy. You want me to— I dunno. Start eating veggies, lose a couple pounds, whatever. I draw the line at trading Baby in for a mom-van, but I just. You gotta know I’d— you know I’d do anything for you, man. Go to Hell, the Empty, all of that, but also—you just tell me. I can— I wanna be good to you, Cas.”
, but that suits Dean just fine, because it’s something he’d rather forget, too. “You alright?”
He tries really, really hard to meet Cas’ eye a usual amount throughout the drive, and he thinks he does a decent job. Cas complains, a bit, about having to change his clothes every day, by which Dean gathers he sees it as an unnecessary hassle. Dean offers up a grunt, and Cas’ lips twitch.
Anyway, Jack seems to like when Dean asks all sorts of dumb questions, including how the hell Jack knows all of these people online. Someone’s gonna have to do a stranger danger talk, at some point—Jack’s even using his real goddamn name.
, but for now, that’s it. Dean’s grateful. He’s already got one relationship to try and patch up.
“Dean,” says Cas, “Perhaps I wasn’t clear, earlier. I can see your soul.”
“Uh,” he says. “Well, look, if it’d help you sleep, I could— you know. I could watch over
The Bluebird Diner Dean’s sitting in is a pretty nice joint, and Dean’s sat in enough of them to know. It’s the kind of place that tries really hard to seem like it’s been around a while, with old style posters on the wall and a jukebox in the corner, but it’s betrayed by the shiny new floors and undamaged plaster that screams
Jack meets them all back at the bunker, and his releasing of his power goes way,
, right?”
underneath him, and Dean thinks, in that second, that he’d give Cas whatever he wanted. There’s nothing he wouldn’t do, wouldn’t bargain, just to get them out of here and into the real world. Cas’ hands are hesitant on his back, stunned, and Dean’s thinking about maybe going along with this train of thought, when all of a sudden he gets shoved away, all one thousand tonnes of cosmic force leaving Dean reeling and unmoored.
“What?” asks Dean, and Cas shoots him a look. It says, very clearly,
Dean forgets, a lot of the time, that the angels don’t actually live in their bodies, and occupy a whole other dimensional space. Cas had tried to explain it to him once before, begrudgingly and like it wasn’t worth the effort, as if he knew Dean’s monkey brain didn’t possess the capacity to comprehend it. At the time Dean had been kind of offended, but now he’s realising he’s going to have to give him that one, because even facing it head on is doing fuck-all in helping him to understand. He feels like he’s having a stroke.
“This isn’t what I meant, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean blacks the fuck out.
“Right,” he says, and fumbles around in his pocket til his clumsy fingers find metal. “Uh, Cas and I wanted to do something, but we’re doing it our way, so. Here you go, man.”
“Yeah.”
He’s not dying here. He
It’s kind of weird, actually, because on any occasion when Dean’s been asked, he’s always called Cas his best friend. But hanging out with Charlie again now really drives the point home that yeah, actually, she is. That’s not to diminish Cas, or anything, because he’s still the best
It’s Cas. Who fucking else, honestly. “Are you alright?”
“Where’s Jack?” asks Cas, but there’ll be time for that later. Truth be told Dean didn’t realise he’d left the room, and even now he doesn’t pull his eyes away to check. He just takes Cas at his word and gets to his feet, pulled to the bottom of the stairs like a comet to a magnet, or something else in a metaphor that actually makes sense. “Dean?”
Cas smiles. “Yes, Dean.”
“Cool,” says Claire, now, and then pushes her way into the house without a backwards glance. Cas looks bewildered, and also saddened, and so Dean knocks his shoulder with his own.
“Alright,” says Dean, and stares after her. It’s weird. She’s not Cas’ kid, he gets that, she’s Jimmy’s, but for all that she acts tough, to him she always just looks really fucking
It’s pretty freakin’ cool.

about it. He rarely does. Those weeks after his death just bled into one another, fuelled by Dean’s single need that this
Sometimes Dean says it just so that Cas will, which he knows is fucked up. This wasn’t one of those times, but it’s kind of nice that Cas delivers anyway.
Cas gives him a look so flat that Dean practically withers under it, his neck flushing hot. “Yes, Dean. It’s the gay one.”
“That’s what I

written on it (and Dean can figure out what that means, thanks, he’s not that stupid), he feels this weird sense of kinship even though she’s like half his age, and says, “Hey, neat. My boyfriend’s waiting in the car.”
“You did,” Jack says, like it’s easy. Dean has to hold onto the counter tip just to standing, because he is being hit with freaking

He rolls his eyes and throws a napkin at her, and then riles her up further by asking about school, and being kind of a dick about it when she says she wants to drop out and pursue hunting. They finish up eating and Dean drags them off in the direction of the closest tattoo and piercing place, because he
He’d thought, vaguely, that maybe in the Empty he could have done something adrenaline fuelled and stupid, but then Cas had thrown them out past that opportunity too, because he’s the one thing Dean’s never been able to predict. Now Dean’s

Jack grins. “There are hair clips, too.”
“…yeah?” Sam says. “Pretty hard to forget.”

Jesus. Dean doesn’t know why he’s
Well, it works just fine until the freaky sixth sense makes its way from Cas to Jack, and the kid tries to give Dean and Sam friendship bracelets, too.

Dean scoffs, and wipes at his traitorous fucking eyes. “I’m freakin’ forty, Bobby.”
). But anyway, whatever this thing in his chest is, it’s ugly and marred and also quite a lot in love with Cas, but that’s basically a given.
“Yeah, yeah,” he says, “I’m a fucking treasure.”
It breaks something in Dean’s brain. Like, severely. Because a couple of days later Dean wakes up in bed with Cas sprawled all over him, octopus limbs and everything, and he feels so lucky that he thinks he could probably cry. Cas is a dead weight on him, is breathing against his neck in a way which is hot and sticky and gross, and Dean’s eyes are actually burning. When Cas stirs, he noses against Dean’s skin and grumbles and tries to block out the sun with whatever piece of Dean he can find, and Dean says:
“Great,” says Dean. “Uh, can we try it again without the

“No worries,” says Claire. Cas says, “That’s alright.”
“Oh,” he says, and it’s like all the air gets sucked out between them, along with Dean’s good mood. “That.”
“Hey,” he says, and hands Dean one of his herbal teas. A beer would have been better, but it’s not like Sam’s ever known subtlety. He’s been extra weird about the drinking ever since he stumbled on Dean fifteen drinks in after Cas died, blinking bleary eyed at a security feed recording and about to pass out, crying himself stupid. They’re both pretending it didn’t happen except for moments like

“I’ve got no idea what that is,” says Dean. “It sounds dirty. Are you looking at porn? Scratch that, I don’t wanna know. Am I obligated to tell your dad?”

Cas looks down at his hand, where Dean’s curled his fingers in his coat,
“What did I tell ya?” says Dean, grinning when Cas’ eyebrows raise, and he reaches out a hand towards it, probably feeling Jack’s presence. The Empty doesn’t have any walls to shake, but Dean still gets the feeling someone’s turned on the tumble dryer, finding it harder to stay standing, and that’s their cue. “Time to go, buddy.”
“Now look at the Volkswagen in front of us— the truck is bigger, correct?”
They get back to the house (as cool as the bunker was, Dean was
Jack shakes his head. “I didn’t want that to happen,” he says. “I didn’t— I know I promised to be hands off, but I would’ve— I wanted to help, I really did, but—”
Claire nods. She’s pretty freaking composed, if Dean says so himself. Looking at her now, it isn’t obvious that two weeks ago she was smashing in a windshield with a crowbar. He’d been pretty happy to let her do it; it was better that than her ending up like him, falling over drunk on a Tuesday. Better to let her get the rage out.
“Sweet,” says Dean, and kisses her forehead. “See you later.”
Ah. Dean knows jealousy when he hears it, and also knows nothing he says is going to change it. “Yeah, that’s Jack. Don’t tell Jody, but he’d probably be happy using his powers to make you fly or something, if you wanted to go fuck around. I’m pretty sure he thinks you’re cool.”
“Yeah, well, tell that to the dentist when you get a cavity. Sure they’ll be real impressed.”
He does it, though. It helps to have a goal.
“I don’t,” Dean says, and Sam looks fucking
Bobby sighs.
There was a— there was someone who went into the bar. Dean remembers. Barely remembers what they looked like, just remembers they were tall. They didn’t look right. Not like their skin didn’t fit, but like they were— too big for it, almost. And the lights hit the sequins on their jacket and Dean stared and stared way past what was polite, except he thought it might be alright ‘cause they were the kind of people you stared at, and he couldn’t tell if they were a boy or a girl and he thought— he thought they looked like a god.
Dean looks back at him. “Goody for you,” he says, grinding his jaw. He’s annoyed, and he doesn’t want to be, but he is, and he doesn’t know
“Alright,” says Dean, and waves at him to go away. “I got it, I got it, Jesus—”
"so it goes" and "[character] has come unstuck in time" is from slaughterhouse 5 by vonnegut, which dean has canonically read :-)  its also WILDLY on theme for spn and i highly recommend it. somebody did their homework
“So,” says Dean, and his voice comes out rasping, the same way it sounded after that drive from hell, like he’s spent nine hours mourning. “Are you— you’re through the portal.”
“Yeah,” says Dean, and looks Jack over again. He seems tired, more weighed down and less optimistic than he remembers, and it makes Dean’s chest ache.
They then go and get burgers, and Claire has to tie up her hair to keep it out of her face, wincing when she brushes her ear and letting out a sharp hiss of pain. Dean’s raises his eyebrow, because his first thought’s always going to be a hunting injury, but then he sees the red skin surrounding a bar of metal, and only just holds back from rolling his eyes. He nods at it.

of anything, Sam.”
. “No.”
“Cas said you bought juice?”
“Not really,” says Jack, sinking further under the blankets. Cas gives them both a fond look, but that’s nothing out of the ordinary. “I’m still recuperating. But I got bored.”
about this fucked up thing that’s going on with them, and so he keeps going, looking out over the scrapyard. “I just, I didn’t really think about it, you know? I figured me and Cas’d just kind of, uh, stick together until we were dead. Eternal bachelordom, or something. I dunno. It’s stupid.”
He opens his eyes and holds onto Cas’ shoulders as he gets righted, pulled back up so he’s no longer in danger of ending up sprawled on the floor. Cas gazes back down at him, eyes kind and patient and almost unbearably loving. He puts his hands on Dean’s face again, cradles it like he once did his soul, and Dean’s never going to move, not ever again.
“Um,” says Dean. He was planning on sharing the bed with Cas, because, you know, they’re adults and they can share a damn bed, but that’s actually a pretty terrible idea, he realises now. He’s up for a lot, but that’s— hm. Maybe not. Jesus, but his back is sweating. “Sorry. Fuck. Sorry. Goodnight.”
“Jesus, Cas,” says Dean, low, his eyes tightly shut, “You tryin’ to make my foot pop?”
“Cas,” Dean says. His pulse is loud in his own ears, a booming
a train of thought he wants to go down right now. He’ll save that stuff for his chats with Mia Vallens, thanks), but
“You get the hell over here
Bobby’s house is back to being standing when they pull into Sioux Falls two hours later, which Dean passes by filling his brain with music and driving and a riveting game of I Spy, pointedly not talking to Cas, lest he say any more of that shit. He’s unprepared for how he’s going to feel when faced with it; like the past is slapping him in the face, time dissolving around him, like Billy Pilgrim.
“Of course,” says Cas, and it’s fine, it’s all good, but Jesus, this is next-level stupid. Dean’s a fucking moron. Cas looks at the tape in his hands, mouth turning down at the corners. “I don’t want to wear it out, though.”
He holds the paper between his fingers, and it’s the cheap stuff they put in the printer so it’s kind of shiny-feeling, not like the rough stuff he’s used to finding in books, and he looks down at the words printed right there in black and white, his ears buzzing. He feels numb. He feels
Unbidden, Dean thinks,
“You haven’t married me, Dean,” he says.
His heart’s racing and he feels warm all up his back, like he’s been in the sun all day, a golden glow from the inside out. His body’s doing that thing where it misses all the signals about Cas being a dude, and reacts like a middle schooler who’s finding out that their crush likes them back, which is
Cas says: “The portal is for humans.”
“I just,” Dean says again, later, after he’s marinated on this for a couple of hours, waving around a knife even though sharp objects and this topic probably shouldn’t mix. “Okay, you remember
“Ah,” says Cas, and a spark comes into his eyes, and he’s so infuriating, he really is, and Dean feels himself redden. “I did wonder about that.”
echoes tinnily out of the phone, and a muscle in Cas’ jaw twitches as he picks it up, resuming his terrifying expedition into the world of bureaucracy. Dean swallows. At least it gives him a moment to think. He wipes his hands on his napkin (because never let it be said he ever did nothing for Cas), and tugs the paperwork over to his side of the table, ignoring the look Cas shoots him.
Cas smiles. Bobby’s lounge is overheated, the voices from the kitchen too loud, and Dean’s mouth is dry, and the beer isn’t helping; Cas’ body is hot where it touches his own, and undoes all its hard work. Still, Dean’s had enough that he just looks at him, waiting for Cas to finish his thought.
Dean blinks, tries to make sense of that. “What,” he says.
“Didn’t say you couldn’t,” he says, and slams the hood down, dusting off his hands. “This one’s crap, though. But it’s expensive, and if you just want something to get from one place to the next, you might be better off with an automatic.”
Dean blows out a breath. This is… a lot, really, and quite frankly Dean’s sick of having the world on his shoulders. If they’re dead they won’t know either way, right? Dean spent twenty eight years of life expecting to be worm food when he inevitably kicked the bucket (or, not even—he was pretty well assured he’d end up salted and burned from the get go), so eternal life as a star sounds alright, against the alternative. And if it means Jack can step down—
But, hey, bonus, he’s pretty sure that this is what was holding Cas back, too, when he thought Dean was just going to date him out of bro-love. That’s positive. Who woulda thunk it?
“Good,” says Cas, remarkably straight faced. “You may now refer to me as Castiel Winchester.”
“Dean,” says Cas, soft, but they’re interrupted by Marie bringing the bill, as if they haven’t had enough of those for one lifetime. As if their whole story (

An adrenaline-fuelled grin breaks across Dean’s face, overwhelming guilt aside, and he gets to his feet properly, keeps one hand on Sam because that was a
Sam opens his mouth to reply to that, somehow, but Cas gets there first.
Cas glares at him. Dean answers the phone.
“Dude,” Dean says. “No? Cas’d fucking
Dean shrugs, voice tight. “All of it, I dunno. Getting you killed, dragging you back here from eternal peace or whatever, putting you right back in the game—”
“Then you shouldn’t do it,” says Cas, immediately. “You should do what you want to do, Dean.”
“Right,” says Dean, weakly, and gestures vaguely over his shoulder. “You better meet Jack.”
It’s not often Dean thinks about his wants. He never has, because he’s always been good to take what he’s dealt and find a way to be happy with it, or at least not ask for more. He’s meant to have a shitty lot in life, so whatever he gets outside of that has got to be enough for him, but the same doesn’t apply for Jack. The kid deserves far better than Dean, and a hell of a lot more than what he’s already been given.
“What the

Sam’s face sours. “Well, we can’t. Not that it would be a bad thing if people could. But, uh. For the record. No. I didn’t know.”
“Knock yourself out,” he says, shrugging. “But I’m not cleaning you up if you over do it.”
The thing is, is that Dean’s furious. He’s furious Cas left, he’s furious that he
. What does picking the store brand say about him? That he’s stuck following through on old motions, not daring to go after something better? That he should just grow some balls and take the goddamn leap?
“Edith,” says Cas, “and yes.”
“Son of a bitch,” says Dean, and throws a sock at him. “Fucking Christ, you angels, you’re all so damn— fine, wear my holey socks, then, see if I care. Raid my whole fucking wardrobe while you’re at it, I’m going to go make dinner.”
is going to be hard enough.
Dean picks Cas’s burger up with his hand, because he’s not an idiot, and takes a bite— it’s pretty good. The mayonnaise runs down his fingers so he licks it off when he’s done, and Cas makes a resigned sort of face that suggests he’s maybe reconsidering their arrangement. Relationship.
, everything about him is, it’s why Dean can’t think about it, because he’ll get
Part of the problem is that the people in Dean’s life, right now, are wise to his tricks. No one’s fooled by the macho-man posturing, not that they ever were (although if he thinks hard enough about that, he
free card, like in Purgatory. Jack says he can use it as an opening to pull you out, too.”
“Sam,” he croaks out, bunching the fabric of Sam’s jacket in his hand, holding him near. “Sam, Sammy, just— stop. Just stop, man. It’s okay.”
He swallows, hands curling on his jeans. He’s not. Jack’s only doing it because of Claire, anyway, not because he’s— not for any other reason.
“You can always take ‘em out,” Claire says, and Dean— pauses. She looks up.
“Okay!” says Sam, face screwed up like a baby with a lemon. “That’s enough, thanks.”
fucked up, because not only did he
“I’m not denying anything,” Dean says, and for once it’s actually true. He’s lost Cas enough times to recognise the beats of his own grief, and he’s pretty sure that he went through all six of them on that goddamned drive the night of. It’s not
Dean’s never really been that good at reading Cas, certainly not as good as Cas is at reading him. Still, Cas has been mad at him enough times that Dean recognises the expression, and he doesn’t have to be an expert to know what it means when Cas curls his hands into fists.
Dean grins. “Way to go, Garth.”
burnt down to the ground, and I got Ellen fuckin’ Harvelle on the phone telling me her and Jo are alive and askin’ why all the papers say its 2020, and you and Sam ain’t picking up your damn phones.”
“You got it, kid,” he says, “Time to get off the road.”
Proposals are probably meant to be more romantic, thinks Dean with a wince. He doubts gruff shouting is usually involved. Sam probably cried asking Eileen.
about it. “It’s fine. Seriously. Like, obviously Cas is great, and if I was a chick, sure, I’d be into that. Definitely. But I’m not. And, like, I wish I could, ‘cause that’d make this whole thing easier, but, y’know. I’m not, so it doesn’t matter. Okay? It’s fine.”
Cas’ expression is unbearably gentle, a sympathetic tilt to his mouth like he can see right through Dean, and knows exactly what’s going on through his head. Dean wishes he’d share with the class. Cas has always been able to see right through him, right from their first meeting in the bar, when he looked Dean in the eye and said
“Refer to yourself with a female moniker.”
you in this story. Please, just—one more time, man. Do it one more time.”
HELLO! this consumed me for like a month despite the fact that i’m still on s9 (yes i watched spn for the first time post nov 20, yes im having a ball). i haven’t met all the characters who feature in this fic, and i think i got some stuff with the apocalypse world people wrong, but frankly i don’t care. essentially i decided to take every single thing that has ever made me feel ill about dean and cas and combine it all together <3
“Yeah, well,” says Dean, and focuses on keeping his knuckles loose on the steering wheel, drumming out a beat that doesn’t quite match the music. He hasn’t thought about Cas since it happened, has switched himself off just so that he can get through the frigging day. He glances over at Sam just long enough to catch a glimpse of his expression and decide he doesn’t want to see the rest of it, and turns back to the road.
“Aw,” says Sam. “Thanks, Dean.”
“I’ll sign,” says Cas, eager, apparently, to take his new legally-sound identity for a spin. Dean puts his chin in his hand and hopes valiantly that he doesn’t look like a thirteen-year-old girl gazing besottedly at her Justin Timberlake poster. Cas removes a fountain pen from his pocket and takes the bill and Dean knows that he’s failing, but he also doesn’t really care; that bright light feeling is back.
this with nothing coming to snatch it away. He looks at Cas, here in the bunker and
The overhead light is flickering in the corner of his eye. It’s not angels, or anything, just faulty wiring and shoddy priorities, but it’s giving Dean a headache. Weirdly, he wants to call Cas.
“I mean,” says Dean, before he can get the wrong idea, “it’s nice! I’m thrilled, or whatever, that he wanted to give me one. I just. Don’t know if it’s my style.”
“Please, Cas,” says Dean, and puts his hand, slowly, on Cas’ chest. “Let’s just go.”
“Ah,” says Cas. “I see.”
, Cas,
He shrugs, pleased with himself. “Jesus,” says Dean. “You do it on purpose, you dick.”
that he is.
“It’s alright, Dean,” says Cas, and Dean shouldn’t be able to hear him, not over all this
something they want to deal with again. It’s much safer this way.
“Okay,” Sam says, simply. It takes a couple seconds to blink that one away. He shrugs too. “Thanks for telling me, man.”
This is it, man. He could live in this moment forever.
Dean, of course, approaches the situation with all the tact it deserves.
Dean is goddamned lucky that the first angel he finds is dormant in sleep. Adding burned out eyes to this shit show would easily put it in the top three worst experiences of his life, but maybe being dead dulls the whole

“That new?”
. There’s a lot of
“Perhaps I should try again,” he suggests.
“You—? What—?”
“Dean,” Sam says, seriously, gravely. “Don’t do that again, man.”
“Hi, Jody,” says Bobby, and they hug. Sam’s getting teary-eyed again. Dean turns his attention to Claire, who is standing in her big fuck-off boots, arms crossed and mouth surly.
“Nothing,” he mutters. “Asshole.”
“You need to go,” says Cas, and no, absolutely not, Dean is
Right. Fuck, Dean had forgotten that conversation. The closest he ever got to understanding that Cas has whole different way of seeing the world was by comparing it to a bad acid trip, and even then he had to substitute that for his experience with dream root. He bets Cas sees in fucking shrimp colours, too. And souls. Can’t forget that.
. He scrubs at the back of his neck, but he doesn’t think Cas is trying to start a fight. If anything, he just sounds weary, like he knows what the outcome of this is going to be, and wants to get there as soon as possible. It turns out Dean is a shitty fucking love interest, if he can make Cas feel like that.
“I took a shortcut,” Dean says. Cas squints.
“Cas is right,” says Dean. “I mean, Jesus, what’ve we been fighting for, huh? You remove all the obstacles and you might as well not need free will, it’s not like it’s gonna make a difference. I don’t wanna live in my greatest hits, dude, I wanna do— different stuff. Stuff I haven’t— been able to do, until now.”
, or whatever. He always looked a bit too much like Mom, had eyes a bit too big and lips a bit too pouty. Dean resolutely avoids the mirror, but that means looking at Cas.
“I’m only saying hello,” she whines, but is quick to go back to beaming, absolutely fucking radiant. Dean rolls his eyes and catches her in another side-hug, kissing her temple. She giggles.
Dean gestures helplessly. “He wanted to!”
in time with his boots. Doesn’t know what it’s like to not be trying to prove that statement every step of the way, with women and booze and winking at waitresses. Not caring, just letting people assume whatever they like, but that can’t be— that can’t be right.
“Thanks, Marie,” says Dean, taking them off her so she doesn’t have to wait while Cas piles his papers off to the side. With a promise to call if they need anything, she heads back to the register, and Dean puts the food in front of them. Four minutes then have to be sacrificed to the initial taste-test of the burger, since it’s a new one to Dean, and gratuitous comments about the quality that Cas listens to with a smile, brightening up for the first time since he got on the phone with American Services.
. It feels like a failure, like he’s failed some vague, unknowable test, just because he’s still in the same patterns as he was before they defeated God. Then he feels stupid for feeling like this, and keeps the store brand choice out of stubbornness. Neither feeling goes away. He just gets more and more tetchy.
“It’s complicated,” answers Cas, and a very fucking embarrassing noise rips itself from Dean’s throat.
Cas looks up from where he’s —actually, what
“I didn’t understand it, at first. I mistook it for my own. When I did realise it belonged to you, I felt— I didn’t understand why you restrained yourself from it. I thought you might have been unaware, or that you wished you felt differently. I later became convinced I was interpreting it wrong, or that you meant it only under the guise of family, which you later expressed.”
He doesn’t respond, and Dean’s skin itches. He glances around, gets all fucked up with the nausea again, and sways back into Cas.
Sam looks. “I promise, Sammy.”
Dean is honestly surprised he can still feel anything at all, at this point, but the weight of this latest is heavy, just another freaking load to the one on Dean’s back. “Seriously, Jack,” he says, and he sounds
“Alright,” says Cas, and turns a page in his paper. He looks like a grandad. It’s embarrassing, how much Dean wants to jump his bones. In a normal, friends helping out friends kind of way, obviously. Like Benny in Purgatory.
have to talk about, and has him casting about to change the subject. “Hey, let’s go take care of Jack’s thing, huh? And get out of this barn. It’s giving me the heebie-jeebies.”
it hasn’t always been like this, that there’ve been times when Cas’ self-loathing has given his own a run for its money. Right now, though, Cas is
But Dean can’t, so he doesn’t.
“Yeah,” he says. “I
with it well, when someone dies. I just—I don’t want—"
“No,” says Cas, “Before that. I told you the one thing I want, Dean.”
“You,” Cas says, flat. “You are— you’re standing in me, at the moment. I am manipulating our perception of reality in order not to cause irreparable damage to your sight.”
“That angel’s got more sense ‘un the two of you put together.” He shoots another look Dean’s way, hidden under the beard and the cap, but still too damn discerning for his own good. If Bobby’s figured them out in less than twenty-four hours, that’s gonna suck. “How’s he fittin’ in to the grand plan, anyway? He sticking with you this time?”
. I knew it was going to happen, and I wouldn’t have let you die if there had been any other way, but it’s— it’s Castiel, Dean, and I had to try.”
. He makes jokes for an audience that exists in his head, for Sam, for Cas, anything to keep that fucking screen up around himself, to make sure people only see what he puts out. It works, too; Sam snorts.
,” says Cas, relieved and punched-out as he turns whip quick and embraces his kid, slipping out from under Dean’s grip. Dean only manages to get himself online at the last second, only just manages to hold out from clenching his fist until it won’t be in Cas’ coat. Jack’s grin, when he buries it in Cas’ shoulder, is wide as the freaking moon, His eyes almost disappearing from how much they’re crinkled. “What did you do?”
“No, I remember the movie,” says Cas, “I liked it. I meant that I don’t understand the implication.”
sane, he might realise that there’s actually no reason for Bobby to hear ‘half-angel half-human’ and leap into thinking that Dean somehow knocked Cas up, because that line of thought is on nobody’s radar
“Oh,” says Cas. He blinks, once. Dean starts to get jittery.
He smiles again and this one is loving, tender. “You, of course, would find a way to turn me back.”
“Oh.” Dean pulls his hands down from his face. “I thought everybody knew. That you could all, y’know. Tell.” He adds, by accident: “Dad knew.”
“Just humour your dad, hon,” she says, handing over something for Dean to sign, “he’s probably just excited he’s going to look as cool as you.”
Dean had swallowed, cleared his throat, watched Cas’ eyes linger on where his fingers touched skin. “Well, geez, Cas. You sure know how to make a girl feel special.”
. Led Zeppelin comes on and Dean thinks
Looking at Cas simply makes the feeling of anticipation worse, because his eyes have started to go bleary, and he keeps rubbing at them. Of course he needs to fucking
“Where’s Bobby?”
“Right,” Dean says, steeling himself. Cas waits. He could stand to look a little more bothered, in Dean’s opinion. He knows there’s been a lot going on, what with the rescue and everything, but if
“Anything,” Cas says, and Dean breathes out hard, sliding his hands round to Cas’ hair, because he wants to. It feels great. Again, Cas might’ve been onto something, with this.
The moment lingers, but then, when don’t they? Dean breaks it by cracking another smile, since they come easier and easier these days, have done for a while, and then nods at the paperwork stacked beneath Cas’ phone, which has now switched to classical tunes. It’s marginally better than the sea shanties.
“Yeah!”
“Come on, man,” he says, too quiet. He’s never been good at saying stuff when the situation isn’t desperate, but this is pretty close. He grits his teeth, balls the hand that was just on Cas; “Just let me save you.”
Sam looks over at him, surprised. Dean rolls his eyes. “What, I can’t be mature?”
“Dean’s right,” Cas says, and shoots a soft smile back his way. “We are fucking proud of you, Jack.”
“I want you to be there,” he says, finally. “I want you to stay, Cas. I always want you to stay.”
“Oh, my god,” says Dean, and hides his face in his hands. His skin is burning, this is the worst, Sam is the
Dean clenches his jaw. Then he crouches down beside Cas, and reaches out to pry it from his grip. The fabric’s cold, too cold, and Dean doesn’t believe in energy and shit, not unless there’s some witch mumbo-jumbo behind it, but he takes it and it’s the most stone-cold sober he’s felt in years.
Cas grunts, leaning into Dean, and Dean reaches up to grab his other arm, trying to keep him on his feet while Cas goes all sack of potatoes on him. “You didn’t need to pick the chest,” he mutters.
Dean chokes on air. “Uh. What?”
“Nah, it ain’t so bad. Sure beats sittin’ around in a rocking chair all day, drinking the same bottle of beer.”
Dean groans, and when he tips his head forward against Cas’ shoulder, Cas just laughs in his ear, squeezing his arm.
Dean trudges off in the direction of the portal, still feeling that pull in his gut, that intrinsic knowledge of where he has to go. He’s grateful, since there’s definitely no other way he could keep his bearings in a place like this, and so Cas stomps along beside him, clearly broadcasting the message that he’s still pissed. Dean thinks that’s a little rich considering he’s currently being rescued; he’s sure Leia never gave anyone this much shit.
Dean shrugs. “Well, I just— I figure that’s what you want, right? You always wanted to get out of hunting and go off to Stanford, or whatever, so. You telling me you don’t wanna pack up and go hang at Eileen’s, right now?”
“It’s a Heath Ledger thing,” Dean admits, because he can say it like that, if he tries. He rolls the jacket back up, tucks it away on the bottom shelf.
That’s— honestly, that’s not something Dean’s sure he can face. If he can’t save the world, if he can’t save

“Heaven,” Jack answers, popping up, and Dean sees the disbelief and love and sheer
Jack tilts his head at him.
“Gift from my kid,” explains Dean, and next to him, Jack grins.
“That sounds nice,” says Sam, easy as anything, grin unmistakeable. “I guess you’ll wanna go with them, then?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, because it’s not like he could say anything else. Dean feels kind of delirious. The smile on his face feels shaky at best, a tremulous thing that almost certainly doesn’t convey a damn thing, or says too much. If too much is even possible, at this point. Honestly, Dean’s not sure he could ever say enough.

“I think that I should release them,” finishes Jack, his eyes wide. “It isn’t fair to keep them here, not really, so I thought I could— get rid of it. Heaven, I mean. Hell, too. It isn’t fair; so many of the souls in Hell are there not because they’re truly evil, but because the system is flawed, and Heaven is… lonely. To live out eternity trapped in the same memory, no matter how happy— is that really so wonderful? Isn’t it better to put them at peace, once and for all? They should be returned to the universe.”
“Jesus,” laughs Dean, neck hot as everyone else joins in, but he’s grinning, too. Of course he is. He waggles his eyebrows at Cas, and Cas takes him by the jaw, and kisses him soft and sweet, and also a little dirty. His ring his cool against Dean’s cheek. Dean smiles into it, slings his arm round his shoulders, and holds Cas close. There’s cheers. Dean pulls away beaming.
“Next stop,” he says, and Claire’s eyes bug.
Sam grins back. “No worries. Seriously, whenever you wanna talk—“
He spins on his heel and starts stomping off in the direction of the portal, before realising that he just cannot fucking deal with not having Cas in his line of sight right now. He stops and turns, waiting, trying to keep from hurling as the Empty spins around him, Cas the only sane thing he can see.
“Yeah, no, I get it. Sorry. I just— I wanna make this easy for you, Cas. I couldn’t, last time, and— yeah. Sorry.”
. “You should close your eyes.”
“Cas,” says Dean, when he finally manages to snag him on his own, because for some reason now there are always
Nobody else takes him up on the offer to come load up on groceries; Bobby’s busy on the phone with Garth, Jody’s off to work, Jack’s still conked out, and Sam is, apparently, on the phone with Mom. That’s a stone Dean is very deliberately leaving unturned, operating on little kid hide-and-seek rules. If he doesn’t look at it, it can’t see him. He’ll deal with it when she inevitably rocks up at the bunker, and as for Charlie, well. She’s a hacker. If she wants to find Dean, she will. After getting her killed like he did, he honestly won’t blame her if she doesn’t.

. Bracelet he wears ‘cause he’s a good stepdad and likes the way Jack smiles when he notices.
“Yeah, it’s me,” says Bobby. “Come on. You boys look like hell.”

with the Lucifer thing.
marathon and Dean shakes his head after him, then bristles when he notices Sam looking at him weird.
He’s thinks she’s pleased. Her lips kind of twitch upwards, anyway, a bit like Cas does sometimes, and she shrugs again. “Whatever. I’m gonna go talk to Jo. She’s cool.”
Dean doesn’t say anything. He can’t. It doesn’t matter, though, because Cas just barrels on.
be dead, and I want to fucking talk about that.”
, in a moment that makes Dean seriously panic that Chuck might still be out there pulling the strings, Cas gets taken off hold.
A hissing white light appears between him and Jack, spluttering like bacon in a pan, and Dean takes a deep breath, salutes, and steps right on through and back to Cas.
Dean makes a sceptical noise, and Sam sighs. Reluctantly, he elaborates, looking like Dean’s the last person he wants to explain this to. “Come on, you don’t… you don’t think it’s kind of— I dunno, lonely? To be joined at the hip so much that you’re basically one person?”
“Right,” says Dean. “I— hey, look, Bobby, I’m sorry, man. I’m so fucking sorry.”
“Hey, less undressing talk,” says Dean, and Cas rolls his eyes. “Jack, you up for some music?”
. It’s not every day your kid decides to screw the
“Nothing,” he says, but it isn’t quite convincing enough to hide his snicker. “It’s just, you know. Soon enough you’ll be calling him ‘sport’.”
Sam cracks out the laptop again, nodding along. “The high-school kids? I think I saw that. Yeah, okay. I’ll call Eileen, get her to meet us there, you call Cas. And I bought bacon, too, I’m not an idiot.”
The stack of papers Dean nods at are all genuine Winchester forgeries, since for all of Cas’ desire to get as much paperwork as he can legally, they don’t exactly hand stuff like birth certificates out. A couple are also owed to Charlie and her wizardry, anything that was going to be too hard for them to come by, though Dean’s not sure which exact forms are there. He mostly let Sam handle it; forging papers is way too lame when the alternative is teaching Jack to do a U-turn. That’s a life skill.
“Why? Cas is back, Mom’s back, Bobby’s back. I’m freaking fantastic.”
“I think it was already written. Castiel is not meant to be here, Dean, and I’m not allowed to reach him.”
Dean grunts, and settles down beside him. Sam’s leg’s jittering up and down with anticipation, and it’s kind of nauseating, honestly. Cas had disappeared this morning with Jack, taking the truck into town, and Dean’s betting fifty/fifty that he comes back with pink slippers. He tries to chill out.
“Okay,” says Dean, not seeing the problem, but Jack looks close to tears.
like there’s something that
“You can’t play God, kid,” says Dean, a feeble defence, and Jack says:
“I think we’re doing very well,” says Cas, and Dean decides the highway’s empty enough that he can lean over and kiss him, just briefly. Good thing Jack’s not in the car— Dean didn’t really wanna bust out the ‘do as I say not as I do’ this early, not when he’s trying to teach road safety to the kid on the weekend, and— yeah. Whatever. He’s too preoccupied to think about that right now.
, his vision blacking out for a second, and then suddenly he’s gasping,
And Dean just
Cas also keeps worrying that there’s going to be some side-effect of Jack giving up his God-powers, but after two months in which absolutely nothing happens that might suggest there’s some next big nasty waiting for them, Cas has to admit that perhaps he’s actually fine, and the other shoe’s content to hang about it mid-air forever. Dean calls him a helicopter parent. Cas comments on glass houses.
Cas’ eyebrows furrow. It means he feels Dean is being deliberately obtuse, which Dean resents.
“You haven’t actually asked.”
They also, in the end, all go to the beach. Cas gets sunburnt.
“Shut the fuck up,” Dean says, one hand to his back, and hobbles through to the kitchen. Bobby has obviously done a shopping trip at some point before they got here, so at least there actually is coffee for Dean to skull. He makes himself a cup, resolutely ignoring the kitchen’s other occupant, and listening for other sounds of movement throughout the house. Sam’s already on the porch FaceTiming Eileen, Jack and Claire have yet to drag themselves out of bed, and, given the kitchen’s other occupant, that person stomping about upstairs must be Bobby. Cool.
Dean clenches his fists in Bobby’s jacket, then sniffs and pulls back, because he’s a fucking man, and he’s not gonna have a breakdown about this, he
Okay, so maybe Dean is in love with Cas. Hindsight is twenty fucking twenty, and everything, because he gets now how it is all so fucking
that.”
“Well, that’s good,” he says, but it doesn’t come out quite light enough, and his knuckles are still white on the wheel, “‘cause I sure ain’t kissing you better.”
Dean snorts. “Yeah, okay. It’s just. It’s pink.”
. He gets a message from Cas asking if he’s arrived safely in Sioux Falls, punctuated by three little emojis, and when he catches himself grinning in the mirror he thinks
“Oh, right,” he says, and puts his hands in his pockets. Then he realises that’s stupid, and nobody fucking stands with their hands in their pockets anyway, do they, so he puts them by his side instead. Only, that’s dumb, too, because they feel clunky and longer than he remembers them, and that’s just embarrassing, honestly. The back of his neck feels hot. Cas puts his hands on it.
“Dean,” says Cas, sharp, and Dean shuts up. It’s said in that way that means
“I’m fine,” says Dean, and shoves his hands in his pockets, wrapping his fingers around Ruby’s knife. Cas’ grace has pushed him back to just suffering the blind spots, so he really
There’s a wry little smile on his face that Dean can’t help but stare at, as Cas glances out over the scenery.
“Yeah, okay,” says Dean, and Bobby seems to take the cue to switch the subject a little. He takes a swill of his beer.
“With the music,” says Sam. Something prickles across the back of Dean’s neck, and he grunts. Sam sighs. “I’m just saying. When you’re not trying to be him, you’re a pretty decent father.”
“I need you,” he says, finally. “I couldn’t leave you in the Empty, Cas, I
Cas continues to stare at him. The back of Dean’s neck itches.
Dean says, “Gesundheit.”
“Oh my god,” she mutters, but cleans them in the sink, flicking water at him when she’s done. It gets all over Dean’s shirt, and Cas hands him the tea towel. Eileen nearly walks into the fridge trying to get around him. Sam’s trying to clear space for Jody. There are
Sam pulls a face like the answer should be obvious. “Uh, yeah, Dean. I mean, we didn’t really get to know her, before, and I know she wasn’t— I guess that she wasn’t what either of us wanted, or hoped, or whatever, but now she’s— I mean, she’s sticking around, right? Like, I’ve got to get to know her. For the long term. It’s just. It’s weird. Don’t you feel like it’s weird?”
badly, huh?” he says, and pushes out a laugh. “Fair enough. I’m going to hit the hay, so, uh. Goodnight, I guess. Your usual room’s all ready to go. Had it done up just in case. You can holler if you need anything. Night.”
Dean doesn’t start these conversations, and it’s because they make his skin prickle, hairs standing to attention on his arms, because Cas is so
Stop acting stupid.
. He can take a minute out of his day to fix Heaven. Jack gives them the low-down, which boils down, essentially, to this: God’s grace is woven into the fabric of reality, the structures of Heaven and Hell included, and basically every dead soul is now under Jack’s watch. Go figure. Given their last experience with angels hopped up on souls, Dean unfortunately thinks he sees where this is going.
and he’s
For someone in Dean’s line of work, he’s embarrassingly not up to date on his bible thumping (although, given God turned out to be a hack, he doesn’t find this particularly stressing), but he knows Vonnegut, so he remembers this one, he thinks. He clears his throat. “Yeah, they— you turned her into a pillar of salt for it, right? The wife.”
Fucking
Dean’s face goes hot. He focuses, hard, on scrubbing off a bit of maple syrup. “Oh. And?”
“Hey, sleepyhead,” says Dean, when Cas’ head starts to droop into his palm, pushing past the guilt that crops up every time he remembers Cas is mostly human, because if he didn’t then nothing would get done, “how many eggs do you want?”
“See that, there,” says Dean. “Not good enough, buddy. You’re allowed to have wants. What’ll it be?”
“She’ll get it,” he says. Cas sighs.
“I already told you.”
In the grocery store, Dean stands in front of the juice options and has a crisis.

“Well, yeah, obviously,” says Dean, again. “You— wait, were you expecting me to get uppity about that? I’m an excellent fucking ally! I fuck men!”
Dean scoffs, looks at the ground. “No. No. I just— I dunno. I’m just thinking.”
, of all people. “Dean.
“Yeah. Well, it sounds pretty cool, I guess.”
. She was talking about Cas, but, well, same goes, now. Dean gets it.
He takes Cas’ wrist to tug him out of the barn, just because. Cas shoots him a look, almost too quick to see, but he lets him.
He grins, too wide and a little crooked, he can feel it on his face. “Plus, y’know. Needy, nagging wife, I pretty much got it covered.”
I’m talking about.”
It’s a pretty terrible idea, all things considered, but it’s not like there was a chance of Dean sleeping tonight anyway, not when a tiny part of him is worried he’s gonna wake up and find he’s actually been trapped in a Djinn dream, or something. He’s

That’s a Vonnegut line, but Dean likes it. Cas is dead. So it goes. Dean’s getting him back. So it goes.
Cas detangles his hand, which is a feat of fucking strength, honestly. “Please stop speaking in references,” he says. “I don’t understand that one, either.”
about that). Still, Dean doesn’t know if he’s ever wanted anything long-term, and by the long pause in which Cas ponders, he thinks maybe Cas hasn’t.
Dean swallows. “Right.”
. He’s done nothing but treat Dean with kid-gloves this whole time, and Dean knows that isn’t fair, because god knows Sam lost his best friend too. Yeah, maybe it didn’t happen after Cas confessed he was in love with him and threw the last decade into retrospect, but he was still family. Sam shouldn’t have to walk around expecting Dean to explode at the drop of a hat, because that’s their
“Hell if I know,” he says, and chews the inside of his lip. “We’ve kind of been doing the— well, doing the same old, I guess. Getting you back was pretty much the only thing on the agenda.”
deal with it. His hands feel all sweaty from the condensation on his beer bottle, his leg is jittering in place, and God, please,
It doesn’t really start with Jack. Like, it kind of does, but if Dean looks back on it, he guesses that maybe there were a couple of signs. His skin’s never really fit right, he’s known that since forever, but it’s not until he’s helping raise a kid with some degree of self-awareness that he realises just how badly he got fucked up.
Dean keeps his hold on his sanity very, very tenuously. This is fine. This is all fine, perfectly fine.
“Okay,” says Dean, and tugs on Cas’ collar. His body is stiff and unyielding under Dean’s hands, but it’d take a hell of a lot more than that to get Dean to give up. “Okay, Cas, I’m gonna bet that somewhere in there you can hear me, and I’m gonna need you to latch on to it and fucking come back to me, man. Whatever shit this thing’s got you wading through, whatever’s going on in your head right now, it isn’t real, okay? You just gotta wake up and smell the cocoa and then we can go home, okay, buddy?”
of people, and he might be getting better at it in private but that doesn’t mean there isn’t an overwhelming urge to run and hide whenever he tries to do it in the presence of other people. Jody’s bringing Claire and Donna up for the day, and Charlie’s driving down, so Dean spends most of the day setting up the spare bedrooms, and then working on the food.
He leaves them to it and dumps the groceries in the kitchen, then goes off to find Sam and bully him into helping. Sam, probably because Dean almost died-for-real two days ago, or maybe just because he’s a good person, dutifully comes and gives him a hand. They close the door off to the lounge so as not to disturb the three couch potatoes, and Dean chews on his tongue as he tries to find a way to broach the topic.
Dean shrugs. “Well, I just figured, you got the separate bedrooms, and all. Didn’t realise you were at that stage of marriage already.”
, to stuff like Cas’ face being too close to his? They’ve been doing that for twelve fucking years! Dean hates himself.
“Come on,” goads Dean, and nudges her shoulder, feeling absurdly pleased. “We’ll match.”
Because that’s the thing, in the end; Dean was ready to fucking go. Having no Cas sucked, and he was ready to dive headfirst into the Empty, drag Cas back out, and then let him know that those feelings he had expressed were more than freakin’ reciprocated, possibly in a way involving tongue. It’s not that different from a hug, when you get down to it. Except that then Cas got out and they kept moving, and sorting this out suddenly involves a discussion of the nitty gritty of Dean’s
, and, frankly, he’s already got plenty enough reasons to be mad at Cas, and vice versa. He doesn’t need another.
, not at all like he left them. He’s flickering around the edges, looking like a mirage or a hundred and one of the other things that Dean’s fought in his life, but he’s still Jack. Dean feels a certain part of himself kick into gear as if he’s waking up from a long sleep, the same kind of urge he gets when he finds a kid on a case.
“Of course,” says Cas, but he’s frowning, like he’s trying to parse Dean out. Dean hates it. He drums his fingers on the table, opens his mouth, but Cas gets in first, and says: “You realise I initially only meant—that Jack and I might leave for the night, to be away during the introductions. I didn’t mean permanently.”
, and comfortable, and it shines outta him all the live-long day, and Dean just basks in it. It’s all he can do.
“I— I dunno,” says Dean, and swallows. “Does it matter?”
Cas tucks Jack into bed, Dean fetches an extra blanket, and Sam makes sure there’s food and water for when he wakes, pulling up a chair beside him and unlocking his phone (which is brimming with texts, Dean sees, and god, he really is happy for him).
“In a sense,” says Cas, idly. He seems almost unfairly unruffled, not at all affected by dying or coming back or what he said before he went. “My grace is gone, certainly.”
Jack smiles. “Simple,” he says. “I’ll just… let go. These places, they exist through me; if I release them, give up my powers, they’ll just dissolve into energy. As they should.”
Jack tilts his head, considering it. “I could let go of Purgatory,” he says. “They are God’s creation, there’s no reason to treat them different. The demons, also, I could put to rest. After all, they were human too, once.”
Dean stares at him. “Are you saying you killed me
“Oh,” Dean says, again. He scratches behind his ear, pulls a weak smile outta his ass and even manages some jazz hands to go with it. “Well, ta da.”
“So, uh,” says Dean, “this is gonna happen to everyone in heaven? They’re all just gonna dissolve, or whatever?”
Dean bites the inside of his cheek, curling his hands in on themselves. That’s not who he is. That’s not who he is.
Dean flips him the bird, gets one in return, and goes to call Cas. And it does, honestly, feel kind of nice.
“It’s okay,” says Cas. “I— you’re very confusing, Dean.”
Dean focuses on unpacking the second bag of groceries, laying everything out methodically on the table. If hunting vamps is a step down, then getting out has got to be the equivalent of a swan dive off a cliff. Dean clears his throat.
Dean closes his mouth. “Oh,” he says. Cas smiles, but it’s not entirely nice.
Cas nods.
“Well howdy, boys,” she says, and holds on to Dean tight when he kisses her cheek in greeting, that stern Mom-look fighting its way to be allowed on to her face, which just means that he’s going to be in trouble once she gets over the compassion from hearing that he died again. Her eyes slide over to Bobby, and she gets a little more choked up. “Well,” she says. “Ain’t you a sight for sore eyes.”
Dean swallows. “Well, we’re happy to have you,” he says, and then turns on the radio before another bombshell gets dropped. He forgets that it’s still tuned into one of Cas’ Top 40 channels, like it has been the last three weeks, because Dean convinced himself that switching it over, when Cas was last to set it, would be the same as jinxing his shot at getting him home. He changes it now before Cas can notice.
“Uh,” says Dean, and then stops, because he shouldn’t just
, and I am so— I am so fucking mad, about that. You just said all that shit and fucked off, and I
Sam’s mouth moving as he chews over his words, which is a sure-fire sign that Dean isn’t going to like whatever comes out. Sam fiddles with the corner of his phone case, then puts it face-down on his knee and angles himself towards Dean in his classic
"Sorry," he says. Dean wonders if Cas really believed he was just gonna let this all coast under the radar, if that's why he's trying to avoid it. As if.
Well. He’s not. That’s the whole problem, in the end. Dean’s sick of being in this story, anyway.
instrumental. When they pull up to a gas station about a third of the way to Sioux Falls, to fuel up and grab some snacks, Sam pulls him aside for a second, wearing one of his faces.
re-enactment?”
Jack glances at Dean’s hand, then back to him. His jaw wobbles.
talk going on, since apparently making it out alive means that she’s now got the time to be mad at Jo for being all self-sacrificial. He gets the feeling this talk’s been going on the whole drive to Bobby’s, because Jo looks seconds away from tearing her own hair out. She walks up to him looking so fucking
“Fuck,” says Dean, and hugs her. Jo grins into his shoulder, and it’s great, it’s really great. He knows that at the time Sam thought he and her were doing something on the side, but the truth is that she’s always been more like a sister, a little too much like Dean himself. Not that that’s true anymore, with what he’s become, but still, it’s a pretty big mind-fuck, to see himself in her now. He didn’t think he was ever that young, but here’s the proof. Once upon a time they all were.
“Hey, man,” Dean says, and Cas, thank fuck, doesn’t say anything about Dean’s little breakdown. He has this horrifying thing now where even the slightest bit of tenderness sends him spiralling, and it’s embarrassing as fuck, but it also feels too good to quit. Like, he’s denied it to himself so long, or had it denied to him, and then Cas practically laid himself at Dean’s feet and offered to give him everything he wanted, and Dean couldn’t say no.
“Dean?” he asks, but Dean just closes his eyes.
, thinks Dean, with a scoff. He’s only been doing it since he was four.
“What do you think?” he asks, and Dean shrugs.
“Yeah,” he mutters, and lets Cas wrap his arms around him. “I dunno. I’m being stupid.”
Dean closes his eyes.
“I guess,” says Dean, not really seeing how this makes a Yahtzee, “But that’s ‘cause the truck’s all the way in the distance.”
Cas thinks this over. “And what if she asks?”
Sam grins. “So you can hang out there and feel included?”
He makes a ganking noise. Jack tilts his head.
Neither he nor Sam move.
“So, I guess you had to pick a last name, huh?” Dean says, breaking up his burger with some fries and a pull of his beer. “What d’ya choose? Novak?”
“Shut up,” says Dean, hands twitching. “You haven’t seen the big finish.”
to do it.
“Yup,” says Bobby, and shrugs, “Well, that an’ a couple of other memories, just repeating over and over. It wasn’t too bad, at first, but things got a little… fractured, when your boy took over. Started noticing it was just a dream when I’d go from tossin’ a ball round with you and Sam to seeing Karen in the next second. Was like dying all over again.”
“Sure,” scoffs Dean, but feels kind of pleased all the same. Screw it, but it’s nice to be appreciated. “You only say that ‘cause you can’t boil water.”
Dean is so relieved at the distraction that he grins, big and bright. Getting rid of his God-powers seems to have really taken it out of him, so Dean grabs the juice for him, since Jack’s apparently operating on half-speed.
. He doesn’t know how to convince Cas of that.
Carefully, Cas lifts his hand and covers Dean’s own, prises his fingers open until Dean has no choice but to drop his hold. Cas’ fingers are rough, which Dean’s never noticed, because why would he have? Dudes don’t pay attention to their best friends’ hands, that’s
“Uh,” he says. “Maybe.”
Cas’ expression is slightly pained.
, but
“I’m still an angel, but yes,” says Cas, and picks up his coffee. His face wrinkles when he sips at it, apparently none the wiser to the fact that Dean’s feeling like a blushing Victorian mistress just based on some light hand brushing. It’s not a particularly good feeling, either; mostly he just feels queasy.
Also, that Cas would take what he’s trying to give.
“Oh, okay, well what the fuck do you know, huh? Fuck off.”
Dean’s fault, that Bobby died. If he hadn’t relied on him so damn much, Chuck wouldn’t have needed to cut him out to isolate them both.

with Claire, and thinks she’s the coolest thing to walk the Earth. It’s not like Dean disagrees with the sentiment, or anything, but it is endearing.
“Of course I do,” says Cas, “You came for me.”
“So,” he says. “So, when’d you realise that I meant it, like— like you do. Because I gotta be honest, I figured it out, like, yesterday.”
Cas comes over and takes her abandoned seat not seconds after she left it, a little shaky on his feet, which Dean grins at. He leans in close, too close, and hums thoughtfully at the scribble ball Dean has produced, all the colours rolled into one, because he never claimed to be an artist. His thigh is solid where it presses to Dean’s.
“Alright, that’s it,” says Dean, “everyone get the hell out of my kitchen. Not you, Cas.”
“Yeah?”
“It’s an idea,” Sam says. “It just feels like there’s stuff we’re missing, you know? Like, look at Garth. How many hunters’ve we met who just killed every monster they came across? Hell,
is having to tell him about everything that’s happened in the in-between, because even though they only go in for the big stuff, it sounds stupid, said out loud. Dean and Sam fought
Cas doesn’t answer. Dean frowns over at him, then rolls off his bed and over to him. “What?”
The antique store is a quaint place off the side of the road, and it’s not really the kind of place that Dean would visit usually, but he does a lot of stuff he wouldn’t otherwise, for Cas.
Anyway, though: the Cas thing. Dean
“Um,” says Dean. He’s not sure why it’s a surprise Cas wants to touch him when he is quite literally in love with him, but what-the-fuck-ever, honestly. Dean’s having a big day.
They wander back through the bunker, footfalls loud in the silence, walking in tandem. Cas’ bedroom turns up first, and the door’s open, so Dean can see his trench coat where it’s draped over a chair, can see the stack of books he’s dragged up from the library. It does something, to Dean’s insides. This little golden glow flickers to life in his stomach, a
Once they manage to get themselves back into the Impala, because the car’s good enough cover for getting a little handsy but not anything else, not now Dean’s got joints that crack and gets a stitch going up the stairs, it becomes a question of practicality. Dean can’t face a wedding. Cas doesn’t particularly
“How did you—” Cas stops, closes his mouth. “You died.”
That last one’s kind of disappointing, actually — Dean likes a place with character — but the food’s good (and cheap) enough that he guesses he’ll forgive it. It’s also only half an hour out from home, and that admittedly counts for a lot of points in its favour. It’s the perfect driving distance for him and Cas to venture to pretty frequently. Like today.
They don’t tell anyone about it, because then it
Cas is not that drunk, it turns out, because he stops short of the guest room, turning to Dean with an unreadable expression on his face. Dean is distracted, a little, by the shadows being cast across his face.
, in every sense of the word. “Hey— hey, you good?”
“No way,” says Sam. “I’m the cool dad.”
“Yeah.”
“Don’t do anything stupid,” she says, and Dean sees Cas smile, just slightly, into her hair.
again, like Dean’s been taken off pause and thrust back into life. He feels sick.
Dean tugs the bracelet off the piece of card, in all its pink and yellow glory, and puts it on his wrist next to his watch. His big, clunky, manly-man’s watch with its face like an odometer, because if a man’s gonna tell time it better also be obvious that the man also gets up to his elbows in engine grease. You know, because that’s normal.
When they get back to the bunker, Cas gives the battered race car to Sam, who’s overly endeared by it, in Dean’s opinion. He’s also bought himself a collection of spoons with little pictures of places he’s been at the top. Dean got a kick out of that, picking them out and getting Cas to tell him about Florence, and Athens, and Birmingham. He likes listening to Cas talk.
That’s how Bobby finds him, trudging up the porch steps in his soaked t-shirt, and grumbling a little. Dean cracks a grin.
. There’s only one thing he can say to that.
His voice is extra gravelly, Dean notices, because it’s polite to notice these kind of things about his friends, probably.
“If I have to sit through another round of
“So put it to-fucking-gether, Cas!”
His wobbly legs and the pain behind his eyes begs to differ, and Cas looks at him like he knows it, somehow unimpressed and concerned at the same time. He reaches up to Dean’s forehead and Dean just fucking leans into it like the pull of gravity, presses his skin into the touch of Cas’ fingers like his whole body’s weak for it, which he’ll be embarrassed about later, sure, but right now he couldn’t give less of a shit, honestly. Cas’ eyes go wide.

The tilt of Cas’ head is almost pitying. “You

suggested—?
Dean lets him. He lets himself be kissed, by Cas, and when Cas starts to pull away, his thumbs dragging slowly across Dean’s cheekbones, Dean pushes himself up onto his toes and makes sure he goes fucking nowhere.
And then Cas smiles at him, and oh, right. Cas is in love with him, too.

“No, dude, Jack totally just saved the world again. That’s
“Nope,” says Dean. “There’s a salt and burn a couple miles South, but Jo said she’d take care of it. I’m all yours.”
“Yes. You say that as if the line were on of bravado, an act of indifference. But really it just means: I know. I know despite all our fighting, all our arguments. I know and I wouldn’t have changed a thing, and you are not to regret not having said it sooner. It means I

“Good,” he says. “It’s this way.”

When Ellen and Jo turn up, Ellen is

“Go for it,” he says, and tries not to heave the pie back up. Not because he doesn’t
There is—urgh—mountains of shit Dean could be trying to unpack, if he wanted. He definitely does not. He is, in fact, trying damn hard not to think about any of it. He made his peace with his childhood and his dad by burying that shit down six feet under, and he’s not dragging it back up for closure. What’s dead should stay dead, and he’s managing just fine.
. Other than the obvious, of course. Maybe he just wants to get out of here really, really badly.
Cas looks around, then back at Dean, brow furrowed. He moves his hand around a bit, kind of like he’s trying to cleanse Dean’s aura or something else stupid, and then, very quickly, he looks away, looking almost embarrassed. “I apologise,” he says. “I understand, now.”
Dean would love to say something to that, but whatever tries to croak itself out of him gets swallowed up by the Empty as the floor starts to gurgle. Dean’s back in the bunker, Billie is right fucking outside, and Cas is gonna die and then Dean’s gonna die, because Dean’s the main character and Cas is expendable, except he isn’t, he
“Look, it won’t—I’m not saying we do the whole, you know, big shebang, thing, but—we could, I don’t know, do dinner, or a barbeque, or something, with all the—with Sam and Charlie, and stuff, and Eileen, and Jack, and—and Claire, obviously, and Jody, and we could—yeah. If—I mean, if you want, yeah. Of course, dude.”

too many cooks in Dean’s kitchen, and most of them aren’t even helping. It’s awesome.
Cas holds his gaze for another second. “Hm,” he says, and turns back to his drying. Clearly, the conversation is over.
. Anything’s worth making Cas stay.
Then again; Dean’s not thinking about the speech.
. He thought he’d get a chance to

Sam doesn’t ask, which is great, but he’s said enough that Dean’s pretty sure he knows. It used to bother him like hell, that he worked so damn hard to keep this his own and Sam burst right back into his life after Stanford with his gender studies classes and his weird little bedazzled jean shirt and started dropping shit like
“He killed her.”
Cas opens his eyes.
“I don’t
It’s a pretty freaking good one.
“Castiel,” says Jack, and explains the whole thing, both the Empty and Chuck’s defeat. Dean gets forgotten about almost instantly, which is honestly for the best, because he’s way too focused on trying really hard not to let his knees buckle, his head reeling. Cas is back and time is
Later, when Cas is back and the three of them have eaten, Dean’s in the garage putting away the tools from where he’d been tinkering with Baby earlier just for the sake of it. Cas sneaks up on him and presses up against him from behind like the giant freakin’ sap that he is, hands hot on Dean’s hips and the length of him warm against Dean’s back.
, and wants, or whatever, and it means more than an impulse decision to plant one on him or fuck out this feeling in Dean’s chest, which he thinks is probably guilt over not being able to give Cas everything. The ball is in Dean’s court, and he
Mind you, Dean’s pretty damn close already.
He thinks about it. It’s not like he has anything
Then, also: “Dude, I’m telling you,” he says to Cas, “when you wanna do this shit, you run it past your boyfriend first. It’s dating one oh one.”
All this to say, Dean says
Something scrapes itself up Dean’s throat, but he plays it cool. “Yeah, so? Someone’s gotta be the girl, and it sure as hell isn’t you, have you seen yourself lately? You’re, uh.” Dean loses his train of thought. If only he was like Cas and could spew out whatever adjective he liked, since Cas deserves to hear them and Dean’s got about five he could apply right now. “Looking good.”
. But he might be a little jealous that this has all come about in the wrong order. Or— hell, is it even jealousy? Dean’s not so good at
They stay at Bobby’s for four days all up. Dean manipulates Jack and Cas into splitting the upstairs double bed, on the premise that they’re the ones who are actually recovering from shit, right now, and hustles his way onto the air mattress. It’s true, so they agree, and it keeps Dean from thinking too hard about why he can’t handle being in the same bed as Cas (and also from sleeping in his car at forty, which was
“It looks very nice, Dean,” says Cas. “I’m glad that you are— taking control of your life, and your body, and doing things because you want to. It’s very— well. I enjoy seeing it, is all.”
Cas must know more than he lets on, anyway, the bastard, because he swipes his thumbs up and down again on Dean’s skin in that absolutely devastating way, treasuring and adoring and like Dean’s something to cherish.
“How was lunch?” asks Jack while the episode loads, shifting to get comfortable. He tucks his legs up underneath him, a little human gesture that makes Dean’s heart constrict in his throat. Jesus, but this is his
does what Dean’s basically been begging for this entire fucking time, and shoves his tongue in Dean’s throat. Then it’s pretty great. Dean breaks away gasping, his hands clenched tight in Cas’ collar, shirt all rucked up around Cas’ neck. His brain has been severely kaputzzed.
. Cas is important. “I’ve never really asked, before. What happens to your celestial beam of intent?”
If it was too late in Purgatory, that means it’s too late now, and it can’t be too late now, Dean’s got to—

“I always thought you wanted to get out,” Dean says, clenching his fists to keep himself in check. “Kinda figured I, you know, dragged you back in and never let you out.”
“And, look, I get it, alright? I’m shit at doing what I want, and now I’ve got this whole the-world-is-my-oyster thing going on, and it’s freaking me out. I just— I’ve never thought about this stuff, man. And like— me and you. I figured we’d just… stick together, y’know? And I know, I

thing. He can just barely crane his head to look at it, all spinning rings and burning eyes, but it looks dull. Dead. Dean averts his gaze and keeps walking, passing angel after angel after angel, and all of them demand to be looked away from, for Dean to hide under the covers, and so Dean does.
“Yeah, the house, I know, I mean—”
“Your soul,” says Cas, “although, of course, that is technically what I usually see.”
“Ah,” he intones, solemn, peering at Dean’s shitty excuse for an artwork. He gestures with his wine glass, looking for all the world like a critic. “I see you’ve illustrated the Empty.”
One thing’s new, from yesterday. Dean knows what’s it like to wake up to Cas, now.
Cas ducks his head. “No, I suppose not. Do you, then? Want a place there?”
Anyway, Cas is still wearing his clothes, and Dean doesn’t mind, he
He frowns down at his feet, shifting his weight. “I guess I thought— I mean, it’s stupid, but. I was kinda making plans to take a break from hunting, I guess. Now that the world’s safe. Take a holiday, go to the beach, or something.”
In the end, they didn’t get around to going shopping for Cas’ own stuff, for the combined reason of Cas being pretty content to continue stealing Dean’s shit, and Dean thinking that he probably couldn’t handle going through that following this new fount of knowledge available to him. He’s not telling Cas he loves him in the middle of a
