“Would you like me to wake up your son?” asks the Witch, “Or perhaps you’d like a chain around your neck as well?”
“And besides, my brother seems to think we’ve been at it for months. If he wanted to give you the Big Brother Talk, he would have done so by now.”
They all fall silent as Jack’s arm flops out from under the last layer of Rug. Old Magnussen and the Witch seem surprised by this sudden turn of events. Old Magnussen searches for a pulse in Jack’s wrist.
Now I’ve really broken him. He stares and then laughs really hard. “Sorry. I’m not making fun of you. It’s just very strange that you can give advice about dealing with National Security, but you don’t know what a seal is. Where’s your encyclopaedia? I’ll show you.”
“I DON’T WANT TO! I don’t believe you!” They both stand, fists clenched as they try desperately to make the other see sense.
, and then he’s on his knees in Baker street, his hands trying to stop Sherlock from bleeding out onto their rug as he starts coughing up blood and suddenly everything is red and Sherlock’s blood is running down the wallpaper and they’re drowning in it and John can’t
The sound of a sheet of paper sliding across the table makes him want to run away. Beside him, John tenses and grits his teeth.
"I know Charles Magnussen, son, and so do you. Even if you jail him, he'll never stop. He's the most perverted bastard out there. We can't let him haunt Sherlock for the rest of his life."
"No to both questions," replies Sherlock, having recovered from his laughing fit. "I didn't tell him I was coming, I know that when he gets back he will be forced to give me those files, especially if I'm irritating enough. That's why I brought you."
But then she stands, blood still running down her legs and she limps towards the door. Old Magnussen sighs from his spot on the bed and walks after Her, yelling that She was in trouble if She gets blood on the carpet and “
"Doctor Watson, should you harm that man, I can assure you that the consequences you will suffer shall be
Sherlock doesn’t solve all of his cases. Simply because if there’s an important clue that only he would be able to recognise and no one sees it for him, he cannot conclude his theories for Lestrade. But he’s done well. According to the infamous detective, he’s solved 59 of his 63 cases. He should probably be in the Guinness world record book for most cases solved by a blind detective or something. Sherlock would probably sneer at the mere idea of it. Maybe he should just suggest it anyway, just to watch those artistically shaped lips curl. Oh boy, has he fallen hard or what? He’s
Shaking his head, Sherlock hurries to reassure him. "No, all the walls in this place are soundproof, especially the office. Mycroft can't be too careful in his line of work."
John nods, pleased. "It's a good story. Perhaps uncle Mycroft will read it for you." He throws Mycroft a pointed look, and the British Government glares back.
“You should have told us,” says the Witch, “we would have got him something. How old is he now, four?” She cuts herself a large slice of cake and shovels it into her mouth. Sherlock grips the side of the table and turns his back to them. He doesn’t answer.
“NO!” roars Sherlock, “I’ve been stuck here for thirteen years, you are not carrying me out, I’m walking out!”
Mycroft stares at the boy like the first time they met. Reaching out, he runs his fingers through the newly cut hair, never breaking eye contact. John can see the pride stretched undisguised across his face. “You look wonderful, Jack. As you have always.”
She gasps and approaches him, straightening his clothes and inspecting his fading bruises. “Oh my poor boy, what did they do to you?” She pats his cheek. “When you went missing, I moved back to britain, because I wanted to thank you in person and I didn't find out until I met your parents. But now you've been found safe and sound and I can hopefully return the favour. I hear you have a little boy with you?”
John doesn’t have the strength to reply. He brings his knees up and wraps himself around Jack. “I’m so sorry he said that to you. You are the bravest man and the most loving father I know and he had no right to ever make you doubt that.”
Sherlock stares out the window, his left hand resting against the pane. His right hand clutches Jack’s ponytail.
After a terrible night’s sleep, John is making tea. Sherlock finally ventures out of his room at the sound of John stirring milk into the beverage. He pads into the kitchen and turns his head towards John’s general direction.
“Good boy. And tell them to find your uncle Mycroft Holmes. He’ll protect you and take you to your grandparents. They’ll all take care of you.”
"Sherlock? No, please, Sherlock, I'm sorry... oh God, please, little brother, Sherlock, breathe, breathe for me, please. SHERLOCK? SHERLOCK! Please don't do this to me! PLEASE! SHERLOCK!"
Sherlock seemingly ignores this and makes his way over to his chair before plopping down unceremoniously. John recovers and brings his cup over to him. As usual, Sherlock reaches out with both hands so that he can cradle the mug. Not as usual, John grasps Sherlock’s right hand in his left and guides it to the handle of the mug and allows his fingers to linger on Sherlock’s wrist before pulling away, trying not to express any emotion that Sherlock might hear, leaving the poor man to blink his blind eyes owlishly at John’s armchair. John snickers inwardly at Sherlock’s reaction and waits to see what happens. The smile that graces Sherlock’s lips only lasts a second before the man regains control of himself. John mentally punches the air and goes back to his newspaper in the hopes that Sherlock doesn’t realise he was staring. Brilliant. Ten points to Gryffindor. Everything is going smoothly.
“You made the right choice,” says his father. “A child created that way doesn’t deserve the traditional family name.”
Mycroft knocks at the bathroom door. "Sherlock, everything okay in there? I do apologise if what I said at the funeral hurt you, but I only have your best interests in mind brother, and..." He pushes the door open.
Sherlock senses how John twists the bed covers, how his chest heaves, how he babbles nonsense and cries Sherlock’s name and tells him how wonderful and beautiful he is and he’s going to repay him for this and show him the stars that are currently exploding in front of his eyes…
There’s a long silence. Old Magnussen drums his fingers on Table. The Witch plays with her hair. Sherlock counts to forty-two before he gets a reply. “And what do we get in return?” is the unsurprising question. Sherlock swallows before facing the Witch. This is routine; this is what he has to do to show his submission. He spreads his legs slightly, head bowed before looking at her directly in the eye. “Me.” He replies, the unsurprising answer. But what happens next takes him completely off guard.
Suddenly, he truly looks like Mycroft. Mycroft Holmes in his perfect suit, somehow green screened into Afghanistan.
I frown. “I’m telling the Somebody that there’s something big to worry about.” I turn to go back upstairs.
He gets his breathing under control, managing to fight off an incoming panic attack and takes deep breaths. Sherlock is in pain, he’s the one who needs help. He has to be strong.
She’s very pleased to see me. “Oh! Hello sweetheart! Come in, I’ll make you a nice hot cocoa. Not your housekeeper, mind.”
John shook his head, took one look at Mike's smug face and made his decision. Cursing his fascination under his breath, he darted after Sherlock.
“We’re going to pull the curtain in case your son wakes up. John will be right there with him, is that ok?”
Picking up the razor, he takes the blades and heads to the bath, putting in the plug and turning on the cold tap. He would turn on the warm tap, but warm, cold, what does it matter? He just needs it all to end.
He blinks. I’ve surprised him again. I can tell he wants to lie, so I put on my Attitude Face that John finds a bit scary. He smiles. “Just some difficulty with work. You don’t need to worry. I have everything under control.”
Back in the lounge, Mycroft is cowering behind is umbrella and Jack is trying to find a weak spot. Upon hearing their footsteps, Mycroft recovers. "I believe I heard Mrs. Huson answer the door. Dr. Stamford has arrived."
Of course, She didn’t want to see his face. She didn’t want to picture herself dead in this tiny, hell hole.
The world sharpens and becomes even clearer. "I have bad days. And your day will get worse if your buddies don't lower their weapons."
“John,” says Sherlock, cutting off his panicked thoughts, as if he knows what John is thinking, “just because I cannot see you and just because I have no experience with
Lestrade sets a file on the table, along with a camera and microphone. Just like last time. Sherlock swallows.
More fingers prod him gently. “I don’t think anything’s broken, but he’s going to need medical attention.”
“That’s right. I tried to leave Room because you weren’t here yet and I was lonely and sad. I was-“ he pauses as he gives his answer more thought. “I was jealous because Old Magnussen and the Witch could leave Room together and I… I wanted company. Sometimes I got very angry at Them and I tried to fight Them. Even with Chain I would fight Them. So one day, to help me, after you were born, they gave me tablets that I still have to take.”
I sit on her armchair whilst she makes it for me. I open up my book and look for the photos of children I want to show her. I stop on a page about families. There’s a picture of a child with a mum and dad and grandparents. It’s what lots families look like. Lots of pieces to make a puzzle. But I don’t have a mum. And my grandparents don’t love me. What happens when you have missing pieces and other pieces that don’t love you?
He screams and calls Her every foul and filthy word he can think of. He hopes to enrage her enough that she’ll beat him to death. She does beat him, but Magnussen makes sure to avoid giving Sherlock the sweet release of death.
Uncle Mycroft flinches hard when I say Lestrade’s name. That’s not normal. “Is he OK? Did something bad happen?”
Mycroft nods. “They were going to drag you through the dirt by any means necessary. And Magn- the man was frighteningly intelligent. When I discovered what happened to William and Charlotte, Anthea called our parents and they also found out. We made the fire look like a freak accident. Drove the real criminals to a secure, isolated location. They’re dead, Sherlock.”
He wipes his face with a tea towel and throws it into the wash basket for later. “Well, let’s just say that you implied, quite unintentionally, that Mycroft isn’t respected.”
John hadn't realised how much noise there had been up until the point where he'd drawn his gun. Now, the silence is a loud reminder of how much danger he is now in. Breathe.
“No Jack, Gregory is… he has a very difficult job. Very trying, and even when he catches the Monsters, that doesn’t always mean he can feel like he has won. And now that his job has become a part of his life…” He takes a deep, loud breath. “He simply needs some time to process. He doesn’t want to view us as… work.” He continues to make his keyboard click.
“Hello, Jack,” she smiles, “I'm afraid I can't bend down, I have a bad hip. I've brought you a present, would like to see?”
Sherlock overhears Mycroft and John’s conversation in the kitchen. His brother’s statement that he is unable to make good choices hurt. But his threats of locking him in Baker Street just to keep him safe frightened him even more. Did Mycroft truly believe that he wouldn’t be hurting him just because he wasn’t physically abusing him? Sherlock was afraid of his brother for the first time since the rescue.
Sherlock can hear his own blood rushing. Mycroft looks outraged. That keeps Sherlock grounded. “Jack is my son. He’s my responsibility and he’s staying with me.”
Sherlock glares at Him with all the contempt and hate he can muster. The feeling is overwhelming. But he gives in. For Jack. Always for Jack.
That’s all he cares about. He knows this as They charge through the door and leap at his throat, beating him with a metal pipe, that Jack is out there in the big wide world, away from Them. They throw him onto Bed and hold him down. He’s fully aware of what’s going to happen next. They’ll get as much enjoyment out of this before They kill him and relocate. He closes his eyes and opens the doors to his Mind Palace.
Sherlock pulled on his coat, picked up the riding crop lying on the table. “Thank you for getting this Molly.” he said, speaking to the only woman in the room. “Are you coming John?”
Sherlock would never... But he did. I thought it was Stockholm Syndrome talking or something. But he's stuck to his guns, and so have you. But no matter what, we never should have thought that we could snap him out of it. We were wrong and we will regret it for the rest of our lives. Sherlock is now the type of man who will never abandon his baby. He will succeed where we failed. He will never forgive us or want to talk to us again, I know that. All we can do is rid him of these animals who've ruined his life for so many years."
The next time he touches Sherlock is when they’re at Angelo’s. There’s a candle on the table and John is enjoying mushroom ravioli, while Sherlock tries out Angelo’s new recipe involving spinach and something that looks like it’s been through the digestive tract of a sparrow. John is relieved that Sherlock cannot see what has been put in front of him. Sherlock talks about a case from a few years ago involving a goose and a serial killer granny. John is too relaxed to even laugh. He just smiles quietly, never taking his eyes off Sherlock, allowing himself to take in all of his features. He glances down at Sherlock’s left hand, which is curled into a loose fist on the table. Because it seems appropriate, he reaches out and gently takes Sherlock’s hand in his.
John could only gape. The speed at which Sherlock spoke was enough to make anyone double take, but the confidence with which he conversed and the content... How could he possibly know all of this?
"Are you worried about the interrogation this afternoon? You mustn't worry, the moment you feel uncomfortable..."
John is in love with Sherlock and wants to show him just how much, but can’t because the man in question is blind. Therefore, John is, in his own opinion, pretty much screwed. When attracted to someone, John usually smiles, makes doe eyes and dresses to impress. But Sherlock can’t see any of this without having to physically read him like braille. Because the smartest man in London literally cannot see what is right in front of him. John is considering belting out songs of admiration for Sherlock’s cheekbones and writing poems about his eyes, but that will most likely result in a complete loss of masculinity, let alone dignity. So that’s a no-no. Captain John Watson will simply have to come up with a better plan.
Hope this still feels the same, I gave John more room here (oh the pun, the terrible pun) Mystrade probably felt a bit out of the blue, but when is Mycroft ever predictable? They won't feature too much, just the possibility of Sherlock and Jack and by some extension John gaining an ever expanding family.
“A bit like vitamins, yes. But whereas yours keep you full of energy and healthy, mine make me tired and unable to fight back, or at least, not as much. Do you understand?”
“No, Jack, it’s only us. We’re not supposed to be here,” he swallows and looks Jack in the eye, “We’re prisoners, Jack. We’re being controlled. It’s Them that make the rules, but They’re not allowed to. If I hadn’t been kidnapped, neither of us would be here.”
"Shut it," hisses the man in question his eyes showing deadly intent. "Or I will end your pathetic existence."
Sherlock ignores that question and heads to the door at the end. "This is his office. We'll wait here. Hopefully catch him by surprise." He turns the handle, pushes the door and walks in.
"I was so mad... it got physical, but not for long because she still had a hold on him and he was screaming so loudly... I begged them to stop, to give him back..."
“No,” gasps Sherlock, finding his voice, “Please, no, not Jack. Don’t you dare touch Jack.” He stands. “I’ll do it,” he chokes out, “I’ll do whatever you want.”
She hands him an envelope, the word 'copy' on the front and he sighs. She leaves before he can stop her.
Sherlock, John and Lestrade stare in bemusment as a small five year old, armed with tin foil attacks a middle aged man armed with an umbrella. Sherlock reaches for his phone and manages to snap a photo. He can tell Mycroft is going easy on Jack due to his superior weapon. Well.
John gets mad. “SON OF A -!” Uncle Mycroft quickly covers my ears. Although I’m curious, I don’t want to accidently end up on the naughty step again. It’s the dullest thing in the World, more than boring TV. John marches in like a real soldier and stops yelling. He talks very quietly so I can’t hear with my ears covered. I know that quiet people are sometimes scarier than the loud ones. The Monsters were very quiet. I hug uncle Mycroft’s leg tighter and hide my face until the hands let my ears go.
I help John wash up. I think about asking him, but I know he’ll just try to reassure me. I need to ask someone wise and honest. There’s only one person that fits. I go and get my encyclopaedia and go down all the stairs to Mrs. Hudson’s apartment.
Sherlock is still struggling to breathe as he does as he is told. He listens to the usual six beeps and the door opens and closes. For the first time in five years, he’s alone. Fear takes possession of every limb and he runs as close as he can to the door and presses his palms against it. He gasps for breath for several minutes until he can calm down. Then he walks back over to Bed and pulls out Soft Ball that had rolled out of Rug, the same one that he’s used to fake a lack of pulse in Jack’s arm.
Jack eventually tiptoes over, his brown eyes refilling with tears. "It's okay, Jack, I promise. Do you remember that I was injured when I was a soldier? Well you got me with that sword right where I was shot and I had a flashback. Just like when you get scared and hear noises you don't know that make you think of monsters. Well, it's the same with my injury."
Sherlock's deep baritone means giggles are almost impossible and chuckles are the only option. He can't help but gaze into John's blue eyes, such a different shade from his own. In a certain light they almost look brown. He read as a child about how the eyes are the window to the soul. At the time he's scoffed, because really, but John's... John's spark was so bright, it's like when he and Jack first saw the sun. Blinding and the best thing he'd ever seen.
Mycroft stands and picks up his umbrella before returning to kneel in front of his little brother. "Oh, Brother mine. I would walk around Bucking Palace in a sheet for you." A pause. "Get your mind out of the gutter, Gregory." The man runs out of the room, giving John a small wave.
He sighs. Blood is seeping into his mouth and he doesn’t have a free hand, so he licks it off. “Do we have to do this?”
The man was standing next to a seated woman, who was bent over a microscope. He was leaning on the table, using his hips and hands to maintain his balance and was staring dead ahead, listening to the girl's quiet murmurs, as she was obviously relaying everything she could see. He wasn't physically taking notes and his gaze seemed a little distant. His head turned slightly as they entered the room, John pointing out how different it was. The girl lifted her head and gave a small smile, slight confusion flitted across her face at John's appearance, but she didn't dwell on it.
“Didn’t you see what They did to me last night? They were going to hurt you, Jack! I’m trying to protect you! I’m trying to make you see that there’s more to the world than this stinky Room!”
“A stunned silence fills the air between them. Sherlock blinks in an attempt to clear the panic from his head. “What?”
A week passes and things finally settle into place. Mycroft has miraculously removed the crowds off the street but Sherlock knows that the moment he steps outside, some random person will snap a picture and all he wants is to be able to breathe some fresh air, however fresh the London air can be. So when Mycroft finally suggests a day out in the countryside, this is the best idea imaginable, especially for the adults because both John and Sherlock, although having grown closer, feel trapped within the walls.
They leave and head up to Lestrade's office. Upon arrival, Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson are sat in front of a computer screen. In the corner, Mycroft's and Sherlock's parents sit quietly. They've been crying.
Sherlock chokes back a sob and pulls Jack against him, giving Mycroft a watery smile, grateful for his approval. Doctor Stamford watches them quietly. Mycroft doesn’t attempt to touch Sherlock again, but watches Jack with a certain amount of emotion that Sherlock can’t recognize. He turns to Mike. “How are they, Doctor?”
“No. No, you can’t do that, it could be serious, it could be Salmonella or something, he’s never been sick before, he might die-“
The cabbie gives him a once over and glances at Sherlock who has found his feet and (thank goodness) his balance. He grins, all his teeth showing.
"Huh?" says John intelligently, "So you can giggle over a dead body, but not in the home of his Royal Highness?"
The smile he gives him makes Sherlock’s heart flutter. He thinks back to the conversation he heard between Mycroft and John. Whilst Mycroft’s statements had left him feeling vulnerable and scared of his brother, he hadn’t forgotten the part where Mycroft mentioned that John had feelings for him. His heart flutters excitedly. “John.”
"You're safe, Sherlock. You're in Baker Street, Jack is in your room, Mrs. Hudson is downstairs, your brother and Lestrade will be here soon. Just breathe..."
They haven't ventured out again, the media still trying to snap a photo by any means necessary. It's been two weeks now since they arrived at Baker Street, but John cannot help but feel like he's waiting for the other shoe to drop.
John's heart swells, he feels like he's been included into something wonderful. "My stomach can wait." he declares and twirls his sword. Jack beams.
Sherlock shakes away memories, stuffs them into the deepest cellar and bolts the door. The delete setting won't work against memories which make up nearly half his life. He's give anything to be sixteen and ignorant again.
First of all, if anyone out there is still interested in this story, thank you for being so patient; I've been so ill and even though I left hospital end of March I have been really depressed and struggling to write. This is my longest chapter yet and I wrote it in hospital. My lack of energy means it has taken me nearly two months to actually type up the chapter.
John gets his phone and pauses. He hasn’t been able to speak to Sherlock since… his hands shake. Would Sherlock even want to speak to him? He knows he hurt him, even unintentionally. Sherlock had tried to take his own life because John hadn’t considered the impact of his words. Because he’d
They lay together on top of Rug, Sherlock curled protectively around his son one final time. He knows that if Jack makes it, then he won’t. But that’s okay. Because he won’t have failed Jack. The boy in question is staring up at Strip Light, unaware of his father’s turmoil. His watch won’t stop ticking, why is time going so fast, it has never gone so fast…
Old Magnussen rolls his head slowly. Anyone would think he was bored, but Sherlock knows otherwise. “Oh.” He says, smiling sadistically. “And?”
They all take a seat. For a long moment, no one says anything. Sherlock wrings his hands together. He’s had thirteen years to prepare, yet he has no idea what to say. His parents aren’t exactly forthcoming either. He can’t make his voice go any higher than a whisper, as though this moment might shatter.
Clearing his throat, John shuffled his feet and lent on his stick. He was Captain John Watson, god damn it. He wouldn't let himself be intimidated by other people's behavior towards him. Squaring his shoulders, he raised his glanced from where it had dropped to the floor and glared into Sherlock's eyes.
“Your brother left his wife Clara, because he kept the phone before passing it onto you; you're not close, but he's worried, wants you to stay in touch. Scratches on the charging end, indicate he's an alcoholic. Never see a drunk's phone without them, and they most certainly didn't come from you.” His phone was thrust back into his hands. “An army doctor.” The unseeing eyes were confident. “I can only assume that I'm right.”
Then the movement speeds up and he and his companion hit the ground hard and roll once. Strong arms wrap around him and he struggles. The person rolls onto their back and the arms release him, allowing them both to catch their breath. Tears run down his face and drip into the shirt of the person beneath him. A voice reaches his ears.
He can't tell Sherlock how his son died. Can't tell him about tonight either. Although, knowing Sherlock, he will probably work it out eventually.
Sherlock is panicking. Jack’s thrown up three times and the last time there was nothing left to throw up. The only good news is that they have all power and water back. Room is warming up again, but too slowly and Jack has a temperature. They’ve been sharing body heat, clothes and blankets. But Sherlock is worried out of his mind. They have no medicine. He can’t make this better. But he does have a plan. A plan to save Jack.
He reaches out and touches Sherlock's face, the skin having aged remarkably well in spite of years of imprisonment. As his gaze wanders over his peaceful features, Mycroft clears his throat to interrupt him. The look he's giving him sends shivers down his spine.
John ventures lower down to Sherlock’s belly button, where he dips his tongue in, making Sherlock grip his head tighter. He chuckles, causing Sherlock to wriggle and bite his lip.
John rubs his face in a mixture of fatigue and frustration. “I don’t know, Mycroft. Your brother has been amazing up until this point but now I don’t know what to suggest. Having him institutionalised could be a bad idea, but I honestly don’t think he should stay here at Baker Street. He’s trapped. He needs walks, fresh air and freedom from the hyenas camping out at the end of the street, not this. Do you not have somewhere he and Jack could go that’s private? Even if there’s no room for me, it doesn’t matter. Any doctor could do regular visits.”
There’s movement behind him. He’s not the only one staring at the mirror. The curtain has been pulled back and Jack is asleep under the blankets. John is looking over Sherlock’s body with a pained expression on his face. Sherlock watches him nervously as John walks around the bed to stand next to him.
So sorry for the delay guys! I've been so busy! Thank you for sticking with me and all of your lovely comments!
“I told him to park the pick-up in the driveway, while he’s clearing the garden for the next week. I kept the keys.”
John nods, only half listening. “Sherlock, we're going to get you out of this hospital as soon as we can. We'll go and live with Mrs. Hudson. No one will harm you or Jack there. But that doesn’t explain why you’re refusing to eat.”
“We weren’t raised to be overly emotional,” he concurs, rubbing his bandaged wrists. “I don’t know how to ask for help. I hurt myself and you lash out at others. It’s what we were taught. We are Holmes’.”
“Jack, please! PLEASE, Jack! I’ve taught you to deduce, to read people, to read me. So tell me, do I look like I’m lying?”
His whispering draws a chuckle from the other person, who ensnares him in a fierce hug and rolls onto his back. “You’re five! You’re so old now!”
She wipes her eyes with a tissue. “Let’s do it now shall we? I used to cut my husband’s hair, before your Pa got him executed. Wonderful man. And when you go back upstairs you can surprise John! He will be shocked. Let’s go to my bathroom.”
John smiles. “I understand. We’ll take this one step at a time.” Hand in hand, they make their way to Sherlock’s bedroom. Once inside, John’s heart starts pounding and he feels as nervous as Sherlock appears. He’s beginning to wish he’s googled this beforehand. What would he have typed? ‘Gay sex with blind man’? That would make an interesting Wikipedia page. He’s create an account tomorrow. Right now however…
Sherlock pulls him closer. You won’t be Half-Real. You’ll be just the same as you are now, but not in Room. You’ll be fine, don’t you worry about a thing.”
The Witch helps her partner carry Jack and Rug away. When They reach the door, Sherlock scrambles to his feet, tears still flowing down his face.
They don’t move for several seconds, until John hears a muffled noise coming from the phone. Sherlock. With his arm still wrapped around Jack, he holds the boy to his chest and crawls over to where he dropped the phone. “Hello?” He sounds exhausted.
As he says this, a nameless man walks in holding a violin case with care. Sherlock swallows and his eyes well up, memories of sitting in the Vault, his eyes closed with his hands in the air, desperate to remember every note and every detail of his violin and the music he had spent hours composing alone, locked away in his bedroom, trying to avoid upsetting his childhood chemistry set. He rises from his chair slowly. “Is that… that is...”
Glancing at Mike, he was surprised to see the other man smiling smugly at him, as if he had known Sherlock would astound him this way. It was obviously an everyday occurrence, since everyone else was calm.
“I’m disappointed in you, Sherlock. What happened to that young, spiteful boy we brought into our home? I preferred him to the quivering mess you are now. We’ll be back tomorrow.”
“I’m not too sure what that means exactly, but yes, according to Jack, I’m the Somebody. So what does it mean?”
The man licks his lips. John knows the enemy is trying to delay him and wait for backup. Personally he's surprised they didn't just shoot him when they had their weapons on him. He can't shoot his way out there are too many of them and they'll most likely have backup on the way. He has to get out of here.
Sherlock moves out of Jack’s sight and They follow him. Jack lies back down with a huff and counts sheep to fall asleep. When he opens his eyes again, he’s in Bed and Pa has a new bruise on his right arm. Jack doesn’t know how it happens. It just does.
Sorry this is a bit late. I would like to thank everyone for their support and kind, wonderful words, every Kudo, bookmark and comment has meant the world to me, so thank you. It's keeping my attention on this story. Enjoy!
“Your son is outside waiting for you. The paramedics are coming. I’m right here, okay? We’ve just got to get rid of the chain and then we can get you out of here. Squeeze my hand if you understand.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply. John knows he doesn’t quite believe him. But he’s listening, and it’s a good start.
Suddenly there’s a bang and although it sounds completely wrong, he flinches, thinking he’s just been shot. He’s already in too much pain to care. He just wants it to end.
Old Magnussen and the Witch communicate silently, no words spoken between them. Sherlock tries to get Their attention.
Sherlock stares. His brother has never been like this. Ever. He's not sure how to fix it. "Mycroft, it's okay, I didn't get to know her... I tried to stop them, but none of us knew it would be a girl, she wasn't scared like William..."
Twenty minutes later they climb into his limousine. As the door shuts, he says, "You congratulated Sherlock for not giving Jack the family name. You should know that there were to other children, William and Charlotte. They're in the morgue."
“Because They don’t like my curls-“ Sherlock bites his tongue mid-sentence. “Because that’s the rule. Otherwise, Chain gets tighter. They also shave my face so that I don’t grow a beard. But They never see you, so They don’t know what you look like.”
The baby gasps and starts to cry. Sherlock dashes forward and snatches the ball away from him. If this child thought he could replace…
So thank you all for being so patient and thank you for your support and kind comments, they kept me going through a really difficult period in my life. Thank you so much.
He shakes his head, jaw still working to contain his frustration. "Our situations are very different, but when I came back from Afghanistan, I couldn't do anything. I'm so used to danger, I couldn't land a job because the mundane world isn't for me. You've come back to the world and in some ways you've forgotten how to function within society too. The only way my limp went was because your son jumped out of a truck and literally ran into my life. Up until that point I didn't think I could... If I woke up tomorrow and found all this had been a dream, I wouldn't be able to..."
The burly woman’s strong arms hold his face against the pillow and he can’t breathe. “For Jack,” he thinks over his mental cries of
Sherlock practically spits in his face, snarling at his patronizing tone. “He says he’s not small, he’s Jack the giant.”
“Shut up.” Hisses Sherlock, “Just shut up. She’ll want you gone soon, so don’t play the victim. I’m not falling for that again.”
John walks into the kitchen. He’s rubbing his eyes and says morning to Uncle Mycroft, who doesn’t answer. John notices and rolls his eyes crossly.
Sobbing, John collapses to his knees, the damn breaking. Jack calls his name but Mycroft holds the boy back, giving him space. John is grateful for that. He can’t reassure him right now. In his ear, Sherlock is panicking.
John struggles with Sherlock’s buttons and the man beneath him just keeps giggling until he swats him to be quiet. Eventually he manages to undo his shirt and he straddles Sherlock’s hips and pulls him into a sitting position so he can tug it off. Sherlock is now topless and oh
He waits until he has his breathing under control to properly assess the situation. Sherlock's hands are fluttering like he doesn't know what to do. He looks so young and terrified that John finds the inner strength to slowly sit up, mindful of his shoulder. The door flies open and Mrs. Hudson comes flying in wielding a frying pan. Even Jack stops crying at the sight.
Next to him, Sherlock closes his eyes as if he admits to losing a battle against disbelief and covers his mouth and nose with both hands. His skin turns an unhealthy green tinge.
John’s blood boils, his free hand curling into a fist. He turns and glares at Mycroft who’s watching him, still reassuring Jack. “What did Mycroft say about it being your fault they died?”
John struggles to reach his own pocket with Sherlock climbing all over his lap and eventually manages to obtain his wallet. Looking at the cabbie, the man is watching Sherlock with a look of high amusement on his face and smirks at John when they make eye contact. John flushes.
His voice is tired and slurred, as if he’s had a little too much to drink. John’s heart spasms and he can’t breathe. Tears spill over. Oh god, how he misses him. The answer to Sherlock’s question isn’t very forthcoming, and whatever he had hoped to spontaneously say dies with another piece of his soul.
A small blur shoots across the space between them and Jack crawls up onto Mycroft's lap before the man can stop him. He hides his face against his uncle's expensive suit.
"As the months went by, she became less interested in sex. I was relieved, to put it mildly. There was a routine, but not the same as with Jack; she insisted on interacting with him. She was pleased because he looked like me; dark curls and blue eyes. She knew why I called him William and it pleased her. I was doing anything to keep her happy. But then, about two years later, when I was ninteen I was asleep and..."
There’s a pause where Jack worries his lip and cocks his head. “I don’t know if I’ll remember any of that. There’s too much data.”
"Mycroft will be here but will leave if Sherlock asks him to. We'll need you and Dr. Stamford in on this conversation. Jack will need to be out of ear shot."
of this does not mean that I need you to coddle me or treat me like I’m…” he stops, the word ‘disabled’ hanging in the air between them. John feels the need to reassure them both.
So sorry for the delay, I've moved and started a work experience. I'll try to update as often as possible. Enjoy!
The two figures are dragged to their feet end the blindfolds removed. The terrified faces of Mary Morstan and Charles Magnussen stare up at them.
“I don’t know, just surprise him. He might see you as a worthy opponent. Like the bad guy in the movie who compliments the hero.”
“Oh, I know I’ve never.” Breathes Old Magnussen as he unbuttons his trousers. "But after thirteen years of watching, I think I’ve earnt my go.”
Jack will be better off without him. He almost died because he made him play dead. His son could have been killed or recaptured by the Monsters. From the very beginning, he’s never treated him properly. Jack is safer with John.
Jack nods and Sherlock can feel his T-shirt getting wet. He stares blankly at the wall long after Jack has drifted off into a fitful sleep, fearing the consequences of what he’s about to do.
Approaching John Watson, he pulls the man to one side. “Doctor, what can you tell me about my brother’s condition?”
“Where is he anyway?” asks Old Magnussen, glancing around with an air of nonchalance. “I expected him to be here to thank us for his present.”
Someone guides him to a seat and pushes a bottle of water into his hand. He sips it. When he opens his eyes, his parents are sat opposite him.
Jack holds up a strand of his long hair. “My hair is brown, but yours is dark.” He says. “My hair has grown down my back and it’s wavy, but yours is very short. Your eyes are blue but mine are brown and your face is different shape.”
The other man cut him off. “You knew each other at university. You brought him here because I told you that I was looking for a flatmate. You were gone for two hours, so you bumped into each other, had coffee going by the smell of your breath. You weren't brilliantly close, because you, Mike, were not eager to tell me his name; so in the same class at University, not overly friendly. That tells me you most likely sat on a bench outside; after all discussing things over a table with someone you barely recognize would result in awkwardness for both of you.” A sly smile passed over his face. “Am I right?”
Molly shakes her head, sad. "No. There was too much dirt in the mouth and chest. I'm certain he was buried alive."
The story is under reconstruction from this chapter forth, for those of you who have already read it. I didn't like what happened before, as it didn't follow what I had set up. I hope this makes more sense.
“I missed you,” he says. “I missed you so much. I can’t imagine how worried you must have been. I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock picks himself up and makes his way over to Bed. “No, of course not. This isn’t your fault,” he grips his hair and tugs hard. “Okay. Okay. Right, okay,” he kisses Jack’s head, his eyes determined and hard. “Plan B.”
Had he misunderstood the conversation he’d overheard? After everything John had done for him, how else could he say thank you? He’d thought John wanted it…
“Take you vitamin, it’s the last one,” says Sherlock, tipping it out into his hand and holding it out to Jack, who takes it happily.
Lestrade holds his gaze. Determination is mixed with compassion and something that looks like pity, but determination comes through. It's like when he woke up strapped to a bed all those weeks ago. Trapped.
Throwing open cupboards, he tries to think of something when he sees Jack's cereals and pulls them out, grabbing the bowl of fruit off the counter and turns back to the table. And nearly has a heart attack when he realizes that he, the former soldier, has been snuck up on by a child.
“Good.” They dust the crumbs off onto the floor he’d cleaned earlier that day. That makes Jack cross. He doesn’t want them to spoil Pa’s hard work.
A series of beeps ring out as the six-digit code is tapped in to open the door. They talk as They come in, finishing a conversation.
Their trousers follow quickly and John sits up to rip away Sherlock’s underwear (Payback’s a bitch). He lays there in his naked glory, a small mole inside his left thigh, his cock long and elegantly curved. Without thinking, he bends down and licks a long path up it.
Mycroft whips out his clean handkerchief and wipes his brother's face. "Brother mine, I'm so sorry. I cannot begin to imagine what you went through. You're safe. You'll always be safe now. They'll never get out, no matter what happens, I swear. They'll have to fight me before they get even within a continent to you."
He half runs, half falls down the flight of steps until his bare feet are on soft and well cut grass. He runs towards the nearest person, vaguely aware that he’s screaming
Sherlock pondered the case and John pouted. It was a few minutes before the detective spoke up again. “Yes.”
Sherlock looks unsurprised by this accusation. He sighs. “They’ll come back here to see me. That’s why you have to tell the police about Room in Appledore. So they can get here as quickly as they can.”
When he was growing up, he never thought of himself as capable of being a father. He had been raised in a cold and distant family. Mycroft had always said the family motto was ‘Caring is a disadvantage’. Their parents had loved them in their own strange way, but Sherlock had always known that he simply wasn’t equipped to settle down with a wife, child and dog. He’d been too smart, too interested in his experiments and what he’d called the Science of Deduction to care about that. But then he’d been locked in Room and Jack had been born. Sherlock can only hope that he’s done right by Jack. Would his parents be proud?
The man’s face has been wiped of all rage, leaving nothing but the shell that had welcomed Jack when he had come back upstairs from Mrs. Hudson’s. “I didn’t mean…”
Mycroft watches as Sherlock cries silently. He knows his brother only half grieved a long time ago. To his right, John stands there, a constant presence. Mycroft knows something must have happened, because the good doctor is stressed. Sherlock also seems hesitant around him.
Mycroft and his parents walk to the edge and look down. The severity of the situation seems to have sunk in. Magnussen spits his gag out. "You can't do this! My lawyer will..."
There’s a long silence, the tension thick enough to be cut with a knife. Sherlock stares at the newcomer, his jaw slack and their eyes are riveted to one another. Eventually, he manages to make his mouth work. He stammers. “Mycroft?”
I run back to her bathroom where she is clearing up. I hug her tighter than ever. “I love you, Grandma.”
"Sherlock, I know you've just relieved the worst moments of your life, but I'm begging you... don't do anything stupid.
This isn't the first time Sherlock has tried to go. The first time he had been sixteen. The Witch had just told him he was going to be a father. She forces him to touch the baby bump, her eyes wide and insane. She lays on top of him, Her head on his chest like an enamoured lover, whispering about how the baby is going to look like him. When She leaves, he wraps the chain around his own neck. But he believes Mycroft will come. Mycroft will come and make it all go away. So he puts it down and waits. And waits.
He’s the only one who has walked through my barriers as if they were open doors. I do not understand it. I did not like it at first. But then his ex-wife sent him a message about ruining his life and keeping everything he’s ever owned… And I snapped. I’m not sure if I’ve done this love thing in order. Does banishing one’s love interest’s ex-wife count as a first date?”
Mycroft Holmes returns to his office an hour later. He sits behind his desk and his eyes fall to the photograph of a 9 year old Sherlock in the pirate's outfit he intends to see Jack wear one day. He wonders if he's getting sentimental as he considers putting a photo of his nephew next to the one of his brother.
Ahhhh!! I've finished my thésis, had a small nap and now it must be beginning of July, I have plenty of time… WHAT?! August 19th?????? WHAT HAPPENED??? :(
As they turn a corner, Sherlock's head lolls sideways and onto John's shoulder. His heart stutters in his chest and he reaches out to touch a yellow bruise on his face. His pale and tired face speak volumes about the nightmares he won't discuss with John. He knows they exist because he asked Jack, in exchange for a jar of marmalade. Apparently Sherlock has always has nightmares, but he's learnt not to make any noise to avoid frightening Jack, as Sherlock confessed to him when he cornered him two days ago. John still thinks he's the bravest man he's ever met. Every time he thinks back to what his brain has labelled The Big Rescue, his heart twinges as he recalls Sherlock, severely injured, running and screaming his son's name. He wishes Sherlock's father could love his son as much as Sherlock loves Jack. John wishes he could be truly part of their little family unit.
"I wonder," he says loudly, a small glance confirming that Jack is still spying on him, "I wonder if I can find something to eat? My poor stomach!" He makes a show of grabbing it.
"I can give them both a proper burial. A place where they can rest peacefully. Tell me when you know where you want them buried." He leaves.
"What did I do wrong?" the roughness to his brother's voice startles him. "Tell me what I did wrong... I don't want to be a source of fear. I wasn't angry at you."
John walks into the kitchen and places his hands on his hips. He knows he must look like a twat to any sane person and refrains from laughing at himself and giving up the game. "Now where did I see that yummy?"
John snorts, trying to ignore how the world tilts at the man's words to reveal flashing blue and red lights. "It's your sniper, mate."
Jack wiggles around until he's comfy. Mycroft glares until everyone gets the message and leaves. John and Sherlock head to the kitchen.
His mother shakes her head. “Sherlock, you have no obligation to the boy. We’re not even sure he is your son.”
Mycroft holds his wavering gaze. “Hello, Sherlock,” he rasps and Sherlock allows himself to break down, knowing he’s not the only one who’s not coping. He ensnares his brother, wrapping both arms around him and vaguely aware of Mycroft patting his back awkwardly. But that doesn’t matter because he’s real, so
John nods, mainly for himself. “Female, Caucasian, late thirties or early forties, blond, blue eyes, what most people would have considered attractive. However,” He places that isn’t in Sherlock’s palm onto his back and guides them both to a crouching level. “overweight, blotchy skin, was obviously letting herself go. No makeup, greying hair around the temples, short, doesn’t reach the shoulders. She’s wearing a black coat, her stripy blue scarf is from Marks and Spencer’s, high heels look like any ordinary footwear from the high street, also black. I can’t see the rest of her clothes, the coat is done up.” He grips Sherlock’s hand a little tighter. “Want me to start on the cause of death?”
Mike smiles and crouches down to look at Jack, but Jack is hiding, face buried in his father’s gown. “What was that, Jack?”
"You already knew that, Mummy. You and father chose to ignore it. And you hurt Sherlock even more in the process. Now you know. I hope you're proud."
His already fragile state means he’s been prone to more tears lately. The waterworks start up again. “I failed him. All three of them… I… He never should have even been born…”
Now he's started, he can't stop. He'll tell them everything and then he'll face their wrath and disappointment afterwards.
“I have photos. And yesterday I went to the morgue and beat their corpses with a whip. Miss Hooper keeps them fresh for me, in exchange for her rent being paid for the next six months. Father joins in sometimes. He helped me dig them up after we buried them alive.”
Their expressions change once more. Even Mycroft can no longer look his brother. Sherlock has never seen him look so… guilty. His mother’s eyes are shut and his father doesn’t know where to look.
Sherlock flips open the case and Jack clambers over him to peer inside. Inside is the violin, exactly as he remembered it thirteen years ago. He bats his son's fingers away and closes the case, fingers trembling slightly. “what else have you brought?”
He looks up at me and stops typing. “No, it just gave me something to think about. However, the person we were talking about is on the move. I will have to go to my office. I don’t want any activity to be traced back here.”
“Yes, we are. But you see, from now on, Bed is home and Table is school,” he takes Jack’s hand, “are you ready?”
He pauses to sip more water. Refusing to make eye contact with anyone, he dives back into the story.
Sherlock scoops him up into a hug, a smile plastered onto his face. They make a deal: Sherlock will tell only the truth and Jack will believe him. He tells Jack of Mycroft, Redbeard and his life before Room and Chain.
He gasps, reality filtering back in. Mycroft stares at him, alarmed. He remains where he was. John sits next to Sherlock. "Breathe. Remember what I started teaching you this morning, just breathe. you're fine, you're in Baker Street..."
Saying it makes it feel real. It's a balm on his soul and Sherlock feels proud. John smiles at him from the corner of his eye. Turning to Mycroft, his older brother looks pained. Perhaps he still blames himself. No... something else is bothering his brother. Mycroft knows something he doesn't.
Jack rolls off Pa and drops to his knees to look under the bed. “Good morning, Eggsnake! Good morning, Bed! Good morning, Plant! Good morning, Sink!” He slowly makes his way around the room. “Good morning, Telly! Good morning, Rug! Good morning, Toilet!” He doesn’t notice the look of despair etched across his roommate’s face. “It’s my birthday!”
“Your face will change shape as you get older, Jack.” Explains Sherlock. “When I was your age, my face was round like yours. And as for my hair,” he runs his hand over his head where it’s cut military style, “My hair gets cut regularly, so it never gets to grow, but I know that it can be wavy, just like yours, curly even if I don’t brush it.” He smiles. “And you’re pale like me and you’re the same as me on the inside.” He wraps his arms around his son and pulls him close. “So really, there’s very little difference between us.”
Mycroft's expression snaps from despair to fury within a second. Sherlock shuffles backwards on his behind because
John blinks. He's somehow lost all control on this conversation. Jack flaps his hands agitatedly. "Uncle Mycroft doesn't smile with his face but with hands and his umbrella. And both hands were smiling because Lestrade was petting them and he was smiling too, but with his face."
The silence in 221B was deafening. Sherlock sat on the floor shaking, waiting for someone to tell him he was a failiure, that he didn't deserve Jack...
John snorts, still trying to keep his voice low. “So what, you’re just going to choose everything for him from now on? Decide who treats him, who he sees, what time and when he’s allowed out? That’s almost as bad as what those monsters did to him! Locking him up for his own safety?”
She charges at him before he’s had the chance to realise she’s moved. Her comrade isn’t far behind her and They wrestle him onto his stomach. He fights back just enough to hold their attention, yet not enough for Them to threaten Jack. He has to get the balance right. He has to keep Them occupied.
Mycroft sighs patiently. “No, Sherlock, this is somewhat a surprise. She heard about you on the news and contacted us immediately.” He walks to the door and opens it. “Surely you remember Mrs. Hudson.”
Pa stops what he’s doing and looks thoughtful. He sits down next to Jack on Bed. “What makes you think we’re different?”
“There's been another murder.” The glee in his voice sent an unnoticeable shiver down John's spine. “But this one's different or you wouldn't have come. What's happened?”
Sherlock sits up, eyes curious, nervousness and excitement dancing across his face. Jack wipes his tears and crawls closer. John swallows. "Right."
Mycroft's roar is what causes Sherlock to finally slump in his boyfriend's arms. John is left feeling very alone next to a picture of the Royal family.
"Missing anyone?" he asks "I've killed a lot of your brothers in arms. I don't remember a lot of them. I doubt I'll remember killing you either."
But now I'm back suckers!!!! Thank you for all your support, and thankd to those who discovered it during my Hiatus!!! I WILL FINISH THIS!!!!!!!! I WILL MAKE YOU PROUD.
They enter the kitchen and John gets cups out of the cupboard. Sherlock watches John. Even though it's only been two weeks since they moved in, John has become used to the life. In spite of his claims of not fitting into the norms of society, Sherlock felt that John did just as well as Mrs. Hudson. That should be him functioning properly for his son, not a stranger.
“Hello Uncle Mycroft,” I say, hoping to see him stop. But he just hums and nods his head at me without even looking.
Once John has seen him off with promises of revenge and cursing in more languages than he knew he could speak, along with both middle fingers accompanying the cab's departure, he follows Sherlock up the neat pathway and through the front door of Mycroft's home.
"Mycroft." His mother comes towards him. She looks shaken. "Mycroft... Detective Lestrade showed us the footage..."
Jack mulls over this new information, processing it and putting it on a shelf in his Mind Palace. “But you don’t need to fight anymore, Pa, because you’ve got me. That way you won’t have to take bad tablets anymore.”
Sherlock smirks at John’s language, but doesn’t reprimand him. Instead he pulls off his gloves and coat and hangs them up on the rack. Then he turns back to John and holds out his hands, shy and vulnerable. John grasps them in his own. They’re slightly clammy to the touch.
He stopped telling his story and reached past Mycroft for his glass of water. John grabs it for him and Mycroft craddles his baby brother. Sherlock prays they won't all hate him by the end.
"Sherlock, I'm so sorry. I understand you want to forget, but if we can get Them for murder, there won't even be a jury. We'll nail them before their lawyers can cover them."
John walks to the bed, cataloging his friend's injuries. Ringing in ears, due to blow, causing temporary deafness. Punch to the throat damaged vocal cords, temorary inability to speak. John has just detroyed everything Sherlock loves about himself. A concussion the size of Mycroft's ego and stitches on his face are also things he will never be forgiven for.
The phone drops to the floor with a clatter. Mycroft is hauled out of the armchair – Sherlock’s armchair – thrown on to couch where John’s hands wrap firmly around his neck. Colour creeps back onto his face as John throttles him.
He towers over the child, fists clenched. The baby screams again and suddenly reality slaps Sherlock in the face.
They sip their tea. The sound of an umbrella flapping open and shut, along with more yells of 'That's cheating!' reach them.
John nudges Sherlock backwards until the back of his knees hit the mattress and he collapses onto it, dragging John down with him. They’re both lost for breath and then they’re giggling like they do ever so inappropriately at crime scenes. Sherlock’s face is flushed, his lips are damp and stained red and John feels unmanly tears threatening to spill. He gulps and locks lips with Sherlock.
We make sandwiches and soup. John helps me cut them up. He shouts at uncle Mycroft to ask him if he wants some too, but he doesn’t answer. John’s face twitches. He’s going to get mad soon. I don’t like people getting angry because I get scared and it’s a little bit my fault uncle Mycroft is being silly, so I go and talk to him.
Cold dread grips Sherlock's heart; he clambers off John and kneels in the grass. “I'm sorry. I was thinking about Them and I panicked.”
Sherlock licks his lips. John hadn’t put two and two together, but Mycroft knew Sherlock would eventually, even if he tried to stop him from reading the news. “I saw the news report on TV, the prison They were in caught fire. And then you speak to Mummy?” It’s also a rhetorical question. He just wants confirmation.
When the time comes, Sherlock has him dressed in his warmest jumper and socks, his best trousers and T-shirt. He tucks him in Bed and comforts him, reassuring him. Sherlock tries not to think their plan through. They’ve had no time to prepare what Jack will tell the police or the possibilities of what Old Magnussen and the Witch will do to stop him. But there is no other way. Getting Jack to a hospital could save him from further illness and both of them from captivity, if they’re lucky. But only if the police stop
Then Sherlock's body slowly slides until his head disappears underwater and reality hits. Mycroft can hear himself screaming for help, for an ambulance, for John, anything. He runs forward and plunges his arms into cold, bloody water and brings Sherlock back to the surface. He wraps his arms around Sherlock's torso, cradles his head in his hands.
Jack snatches the book. "Thank you," he whispers and pushes his long hair away from his face and switches on the puppy eyes for Mycroft. "Will you read me the book? Please?"
Sherlock swallows. “I don’t- I don’t have any lube or condoms.” He stammers and they both blush fiercely. It’s a sight to behold, watching Sherlock’s usually pale face turn red. John never thought he’d see the day. He grins like a maniac until trepidation grips him again. But never let be said that Captain John Watson never has a plan.
John tries to gather himself, blushing and avoiding eye contact. “If you really want to thank me, you can just keep working hard at getting better. That’s all. Just keep getting better for your own sake.”
We stare at each other for a long time. Then he picks me up and carries me back to the armchair and sits me between his legs, because I’m small enough. He places his laptop on both our legs and shows me some photographs.
With him nearly matching Mycroft in height and Jack on his shoulders, Mycroft will now have to fend off two attacks from two seperate heights simultaneously. His brother makes a show of gulping exageratedly.
"I know." Sherlock licks his lips, wondering how to explain his dilemma and not upset Mycroft. "It's just the suit."
They stand from their crouched position, John wincing as the movement hurt his leg, Sherlock noticing immediately. He reaches out again until he finds John’s arm and squeezes his hand in reassurance. John’s heart swells at the gesture and he almost forgets that he’s angry at Greg for ruining their evening.
John shrugs. “Jack was so brave and you were both so lost and…” he struggles to find words. “Maybe I should go.”
“No. We’re locked in a vault because They’re cruel people and They enjoy hurting me. That’s why I’m telling this. We have to prepare ourselves.”
“All your things. I've brought them from the house. Everything was kept when you were kidnapped. I had to convince Mummy not to sell your violin.”
The next hour passes to fast for Jack’s liking. He isn’t sick anymore, but he doesn’t feel well and the temperature in Room is only just starting to feel normal again. He watches Strip Light as it flickers like a pulse. He wonders if the World has a Strip Light too, to stop the dark. He clutches Pa’s tooth in his hand. If he has to leave Room, then he’ll just have to take a piece of Pa with him. But he’s scared of Them. He doesn’t want to go anywhere with Them, not without his Pa for safety.
They all fall silent as Jack’s arm flops out from under the last layer of Rug. Old Magnussen and the Witch seem surprised by this sudden turn of events. Old Magnussen searches for a pulse in Jack’s wrist.
He dashes to John's armchair where his own sword still lies and joins the fight. Crouching down, he motions to Jack who quickly scrambles onto his shoulders. Then he straightens and is pleased to see Mycroft confused at their fighting tactics. "Fear not, Captain! We'll take down this
"I'm sorry" he says. Futile words. Sherlock is almost sensory deprived. So he reaches out and takes his hand.
myself, that we’d misunderstood each other… I don’t care if you hate me. I don’t care if you never want to see me again. Just… live for Jack… live for your boy. He needs you… He needs his Pa. If he lost you because of me I would never be able to forgive myself… I- I-“
Mycroft leaves the flat. He climbs into his limousine and sits back as they drive past the dwindling number of journalists. Once his car is clear and on its way to Bart's, he grabs his umbrella and stabs holes into the leather seats of the car, fury boiling his blood.
"Not really, it's all in my head. When you hit it my brain told me I was being shot, but then I remembered my breathing techniques so I feel better."
Sherlock’s hands shake as he tries to coax Jack into looking at Mycroft. He needs Mycroft’s approval, to accept Jack as family, as a Holmes.
Mycroft tips his head back and stares at the ceiling. He remains silent for a moment. And then, “Ah, yes. I never thought I would… that I
Sherlock tenses, his hands curled into tight fists. His mother nods. “We’ll find a home for the boy, somewhere out of the public eye. We don’t want any embarrassment and the quicker he goes, the faster you’ll heal.”
“Very well, I’ll have the nurse bring you some clothes. Oh, and there’s a man outside, friend of mine, can’t get him to leave, John Watson, you probably remember him from last night. Jack responded well to him, can he come in and say hello?”
He doesn’t remember taking his clothes off. He’s suddenly on his back on Bed. He grunts in surprise as someone flips him over, his face pressed against the pillow. He forgets his promise and panics.
Jack points his sword towards the ground and raises an eyebrow. John gulps as a perfect minature Mycroft minus the umbrella stares up at him whilst somehow looking down his nose at him. "Don't be an idiot, Doctor Watson. I perfected the art myself."
John knows how he dreams. He dreams of lieutenant Patterson bleeding out in the sand, the smell of gunfire in the air, explosions around him and John’s screaming orders, but there’s no one to obey because everyone’s
Sherlock panics. “Keep still!” he hisses desperately. Jack struggles for a few moments and then falls still. The door opens.
Sherlock lent in closer, lowering his voice as though sharing forbidden knowledge. John was internally shivering in excitement.
John's jaw drops. Then Jack giggles and then they're both rolling on the floor laughing. "That was bloody brilliant!" he laughs wiping tears from his face. "All those times you ran away from him and you were... analyzing him."
Sherlock cracks one eye open and peers sleepily at his son. He appears to weigh up his options and considers the most appropriate answer he can give. Then he leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, his chin resting on his finger tips and looking Jack in the eye.
Old Magnussen steps forward and shoves him roughly aside. Sherlock watches with wide eyes as They unroll Rug. “Please,” he whispers, “please don’t make me look at the body. I don’t want to remember him like that, you’re not allowed to touch him…”
Informing his lodger that he was skipping tea, he departed without a second thought for John. The latter sat back and convinced the landlady for some tea and biscuits, enjoying their playful banter.
Before the funeral, Mycroft leaves his briefcase by the kitchen table. Sherlock knows his brother is hiding things from him. Inside he finds folders about William and Charlotte. He knows how his daughter died, so he looks at William’s. And nearly faints.
I snort. “Well that’s not true. If you knew how to talk to him he wouldn’t be a problem. So why don’t you try something different?”
John starts at the unexpected question. He’s reminded of the discussion he and Mycroft had just an hour ago. “Of course. Why do you ask?”
"SHUT UP!" shouts Sherlock. "For the love of God, I've learnt my lesson, now stop!" John grabs him under his armpits and hauls him away.
“I can assure you, Doctor Watson, that whilst I have appreciated your dedication to my brother’s recovery, I am concerned about your personal feelings.”
As they enter the building, John glances around at the designs and decorations furnishing the home. "Is this a museum?" he asks before he can stop himself. Sherlock grunts.
Maybe losing three children wears Her down, because when Jack is born, he cuts the cord and waits for her to decide the child’s fate. He has no attachment to this child, has avoided trying to feel anything during the pregnancy. If she kills it like she killed Charlotte, then this will all be over in a few minutes. If she gives it the same fate as William, then he will be forced to raise the child, to care for it and to create a bond with it. A bond She will exploit. And use to get what She wants. Sherlock decided ten seconds after she announced this pregnancy that he would never love this child.
A small gasp and running feet can be heard. John smiles. He's never woken up before Sherlock and Jack before and Jack has never spied on him before. Sherlock must still be asleep. Good. God knows the man needed his sleep.
“I hope you like the story." Says Sherlock, suddenly entering the room. "Because that’s where you got your name from."
Mycroft raises both eyebrows and turns to Anthea. She doesn't raise her eyes from her phone. Guilty as charged.
They remain silent for a moment, only the sound of a patient crying in the hallway disturbing the peace. Mycroft breathes out slowly. “Our mother and father are great at their jobs and hobbies. But they should not be parents. Mummy said so herself.”
In an attempt to forget about the pain, Sherlock whispers reassuring words to his son throughout the entire journey, ignoring the other people in the car. They try to get his attention, call his name, but he ignores them. There are other cars in front and behind them, blue and red lights flashing bright all around them. Eventually they pull up and Lestrade helps him out. He calls for a wheelchair but Sherlock glares at him and makes his way towards the entrance, holding Jack close. He doesn’t see the man in an expensive suit whose eyes follow his every step, limp and stumble.
When he looks back at Pa, Sherlock is sat down on the edge of Bed, his eyelids drooping, even more tired than he usually is at this time of day.
“It got really cold in here and the food went off in the fridge. We ate the eggs but something was wrong, they tasted funny. A while later, Jack started throwing up.”
Hello everyone, I'm still alive (Incredible, I know) I've been ill as many of you know. So I want to say, thank you thank you thank you! for all your support. I hope this chapter is true to the story you have all loved. And I hope there is someone out there who still wants to read this! I love you all!
“Brilliant,” Sherlock watches Jack with a look of pride on his face. They share a smile, “Let’s get learning.”
They all stand there for a while longer until the van and digger leave. His mother holds his hand. "We won't bother Sherlock unless he asks for us. But should he ask, tell him we love him."
Mycroft tilts his head to one side. "It doesn't really matter. I've spent five weeks imagining what I could do to them, but now I know it doesn't matter. Why should it? I have my brother back. I'm the British Government; I'm constantly at war. But I didn't need that in my own family. Seeing my brother at peace will be all I need from this awful period of my life."
“No,” Sherlock grips Lestrade’s shirt tightly. “I need to do this. Let me do this. I haven’t had free will for too long, you will let me do this. If you carry me out, you’ll give my son a heart attack, I need to reassure him. I can wait until later.”
Old Magnussen watches him and Sherlock knows he’s being deduced down to the last detail. He’s known for thirteen years. “Something’s bothering you.” Says the man, glancing at his companion, then back at Sherlock. “Care to share?”
She stares at the wriggling baby blankly. With each birth there seems to be less emotion. Sherlock reaches for a towel and slowly wraps the child up. He tells her it’s a boy. She stares at the baby’s face for just a moment longer until her eyes seem to just slide away to look down at the floor instead. Sherlock does not move. He’s still in a lot of pain from a beating two days before, and should She decide to vent her frustration, he much rather the baby gets its head bashed in then him.
“Both. You have to say that your father and you have been locked in a vault at Appledore. Go on, say it.”
As the can pulls up outside 221B Baker street, they leap out of the vehicle, John throwing the money in the cabbie’s direction as he follows Sherlock, not stopping to wait for the change. He wrestles the key into the lock and almost tears the door off its hinges as they shoot past a startled Mrs. Hudson, up the stairs into their living room. There they both freeze, as though what they’re about to do is finally dawning on them. John risks a glance at Sherlock and all his thoughts take a left turn and screech to a halt.
I have next to no knowlegde about blindness or anything related, so any insight would be welcome. Please rate and review, I would love to hear your thoughts!
Sherlock lets out a breath as he pulls out a blue scarf. Jack strokes it. “Thank you,” he whispers emotional. “Are you going to thank Mrs. Hudson for your present, Jack?”
The quiet is perfect. It’s all around me and I can almost feel it holding me like Pa. If I close my eyes and can make myself and all the sadness disappear.
"YOU'RE A GENIUS! YOU'RE A GENIUS! DON'T LOSE IT! HARDER MYCROFT! SLAP THOSE GIGANTIC BALLS AGAINST MY--"
The eyes disappear and John stares at the top of Jack's head, waiting. Then the eyes reappear, assessing him. Then a small hand places a large silver object on the table before retreating and Jack runs to hide behing the sliding doors. He peers at John, eyes both curious and excited.
Sherlock’s heart misses a beat. He can tell they’re planning something, but he doesn’t know what. He attempts to squash down the rising panic. “Jack is smart. He’s curious and inquisitive.” His voice shakes. “He’s also a little boy who would like a present.”
It takes John ten minutes to catch his breath, inhaling at a marathon like pace, feeling Sherlock’s heart thump beneath his palm.
The younger Holmes is pale, eyes red and dazed, big bags under them from lack of sleep. His appearance is akin to having been in a fight and lost.
“Stabbed from the front, twice from what I can see. She was stabbed below her right breast first, here.” He brings their joined hands over the wound and holds them a few inches above the body. “Most likely nicked the lung. Second injury was fatal, right through the heart over here.” He moves their hands over the second stab wound. “From the amount of blood on her coat and the defensive wounds on her hands, I’d say she put up a fight between each stab, she definitely tried to fight him off, probably couldn’t run due to her injuries. If you want my opinion, I think she’s a sad lady who met a sad ending.” He sighs. “But that’s just my opinion, of course. Oh, we’d better get up, Greg’s here.”
Shaking his head, John smiled. Perhaps he could live with this madman. He still needed to be sure though.
“Of course it's me, dear,” she gives John a smile. “He got my husband executed, he did. Isn't he wonderful?”
He feels like he's just taken his heart out if his chest and shown all of its ugliness to John. He knows the other man has had a rough time, but John can still go out in public, get a job and make friends. His wound hurt, but it was physical. A month after his rescue, Sherlock feels like he's hanging onto the edge by his fingernails. It's terrifying. He's already in the deepest, blackest hole, but there's still an edge. If he goes over... He can't think about it. He has to think about Jack...
He has to keep the conversation away from Jack. “I’m not very hungry,” he mentally slaps himself. Is that the best he can come up with?
Sherlock yelps and lets out a string of words in French that John doesn’t understand. He looks up. Sherlock’s eyes are darting all over the place, bright and alive, his tongue between his teeth, hair damp from sweat and hands fisting the bed sheets. John loves him.
Sherlock breathes deeply, still trying to calm himself. “I just want to leave this place. I just want to go.”
“If my brother had any notion of making good choices, he wouldn’t have walked into a trap thirteen years ago. Every choice I make for him now I make in his best interest. I will continue to do so, whether he likes it or not.”
