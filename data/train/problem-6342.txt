Bucky seemed lost for words. "Wow, that's-are you
, look at you," Steve placed his hands on either side of his boyfriend's face, inspecting the damage done to his nose with upset, worried eyes. "God, Tony, this is...you're bleeding like crazy-"
"Oh," A soft smile broke out on Steve's face, and he tilted his head towards Tony, adding, "Well, you're in luck." He brought his hand up to card it through Tony's hair, and closed his eyes. "'Cause there's no place I'd rather be."
No. If he went home now, he'd only be a burden to his parents: another thing for his mom to worry about; another excuse for Howard to be disappointed in him. No. It wouldn't-he couldn't-
"Tony?" Steve stepped closer. "Look at me," He said, carefully placing his fingers under Tony's chin and lifting gently. Tony's eyes met Steve's for a split second, and then he looked away sharply.
"Yeah? Well, I don't want
to get some sense into the man. "It's 2015, and you're in the tower. You're okay, it's just your imagination,"
"You must've, surely," He continued, grinning. "Although I suppose the flavour's gonna be different after all these years...but, hey, they still taste amazing," Tony was reaching into his pocket now, and Steve simply stared, his mouth agape like a fish. He couldn't believe what he was hearing - Tony Stark, talking about kissing with him!
Then she disappeared behind the doorway.
"Were you going to—to propose, Tony?"
"...Right after I finish this chapter."
Tony, who was dressed in one of Steve's grey hoodies (that was way too big for him, by the way, but what did Tony care? It smelt of Steve, and it was soft and cozy, and it smelt of Steve, plus it was warm, and it smelt of Steve...) instead of his old, blood-covered t-shirt, was sat near the end of Steve's bed, and he pulled a face and grumbled something Steve couldn't hear, leaning back against the wall and hugging his knees.
," The hand fell from Steve's shoulder. "Steve, did you really think I was laughing at
this?!"
"Exactly," Bruce replied. "But that's not the case, for some reason. I'm trying to work out why,"
Tony, being human and inexperienced in alien technology, didn't know whether this was actually true or not, but he kept repeating this to himself and the team anyway. They needed as much optimism as possible, because dealing with a scrawny, messy-haired, hyperactive toddler (who was also his husband, for crying out loud) was proving to be rather difficult for Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Tony would know, since he was the one who'd been juggling the child on his hip all day (the other Avengers had argued that since Steve was his husband, he should be the one to take care of him).
"Tone-"
"It's really nice to hear yours," Steve whispered, hot tears suddenly stinging his eyes. "I love you, Tony."
—And then froze, eyes widening in shock, as he caught sight of something resting on the ice a couple of feet away.
Bucky whistled. "Geez, they must be worth thousands,"
"Forgot...what?" Steve furrowed his eyebrows, and bit his lip. "Tony, I-I'm sorry, I don't-"
The letter wasn't sealed properly — the flap of the envelope was simply tucked into the opening, which Tony had been expecting; Steve had always said that licking envelopes was unhygienic — and so it was easy to open. With careful fingers, he took out the folded piece of paper, depositing the empty envelope on the bedside table, and gently opened it, revealing a handwritten note and—
he thought suddenly.
But Steve had his arms around Tony, and Tony had his arms around Steve, and that was all that mattered. Just them. Holding each other.
Thinking about his beautiful, loving boyfriend at a time like this brought tears to his eyes and made another part of him ache: his heart.
"Please, Tony. Please. I understand if you don't want—I don't mind if you say no—"
"But why—why now? Where are—"
real," Steve shook his head, running a hand through his light hair. "It happened. Bucky
"Oh, Tony," He whispered, pressing a kiss into his soft hair as he rubbed slow circles on his back. "I'm sorry. I should've known, I should've-"
It took him a few seconds to spot him, and when he did, Tony felt a sudden wave of sorrow as he watched. Steve was sat on the cold floor, his knees brought up to his chest, with one arm wrapped tightly around them. The other was holding onto a dark mug, that had tipped over, the contents (Tony guessed it was hot chocolate) spilling onto the floor in a brown puddle.
. Of course I'm gonna be nice to him. I
"Okay," Steve finally said, nodding sharply before forcefully pushing himself off the side...
— open, and inhaled sharply when he unexpectedly came face-to-face with three small objects:
"You're nervous," The genius declared, stating the obvious. "Scared, even. I didn't know you were claustrophobic,"
Tony wasn't having any of that. He pulled away, making Steve frown. He rubbed his neck awkwardly.
, Tony thought.
, and you won't have anyone to
"Here, take my jumper-"
"Tony," Steve said softly, too softly, like he was afraid to speak. "Please, look at me. I-" He placed a tentative hand on Tony's shoulder. "I'm so
Dragging the back of his hand across his wet eyes, Tony painstakingly reached forward and lifted the letter from the ground, his fingers quivering so badly that he fumbled and nearly dropped it again before laying it back on his lap.
In the arms of your father,

And then he heard it. Someone was knocking at his door.

"You're starting to scare me—"
a warm welcome until you explain your intentions."
"I'll tell you what," Tony suddenly interrupted his worried thoughts, as though he'd been able to hear them. "If you just push off the side—I mean, like if you use it to propel yourself forward—I'll be able stop you before you go too far. Then you can hold onto me if you want, and I can either pull you around the rink or direct you back to the side, depending on how you feel. How does that sound?"
But all Tony could do, as Bruce held him closer and carded his fingers though his hair, was weep.
Fortunately, it didn't take long for the pair to arrive at the ice rink. Tony had brought them to the famous Rockefeller Centre, which had changed a lot since the last time Steve had seen it during the 1940s...in more ways than one.
you're worried about my nose-"
Tony's eyebrows knitted together. "Oh, yeah..." He paused, and then his face lit up. "Oh, yeah! I didn't-"
"Fine. You happy, now?"
"He just spoke again!" Bruce said, ignoring Tony and grinning like a mad man. "Tony, don't you realise? That's the first time he's said a word since this whole thing happened!"
Steve and Bucky hadn't left each other's sides since the Winter Soldier's arrival. Tony knew that they hadn't seen each other for seventy years, and that Steve had always thought that Bucky had fallen to his death, but still. The pair were now practically joined at the hip: they ate together; watched movies together; sparred together; went shopping together; heck, they'd even shared a bed on the first night. (Tony told Steve that no, of course he didn't mind if his boyfriend abandoned their usual sleeping chamber so that he could cuddle up with Bucky under the thick, warm duvet in one of the guest bedrooms. Tony had instead spent the entire night in his workshop, fueled only by coffee, cold and alone. But he didn't mind. Obviously). It wasn't that Tony was jealous - he just...he didn't like the fact that Steve and Bucky were now basically inseparable.
to bed first, then we can talk,"
.” Steve whined. “I’ve got to get you some water. You need to stay hydrated.”
"Steve," Tony said simply, yanking the book away from his boyfriend. "No."
him,"
He frowned. "Bucky? What do you-"
. Steve sighed in relief, leaning forward.
"I was only teasing," Steve clarified with a smile, letting go of the book with one hand so that he could boop Tony's nose. "I'd love to go."
Tony grinned even more mischievously at Steve's unimpressed gaze. "
And then Steve grabbed Rumlow's collar, pulled him upwards, and honest-to-God
, Tony, I-God, I thought I was just introducing Bucky to the new world, I had no idea that-" He paused. "I've been ignoring you, haven't I? Leaving you out of things, cancelling plans, and now tonight, I-fuck, this is all my
The genius thought for a moment, and then he mumbled, "Oh.
The pain was horrendous, and Tony felt something warm and wet slowly making it's way down his face. He soon realised it was blood by the metallic taste in his mouth. Rumlow laughed a real, genuine, amused laugh, as though Tony's discomfort entertained him (you sick, twisted bastard) and kicked him in the ribs.
"...Sap."
Steve nodded, taking a deep breath as he lined himself up. He was making way too big of a deal out of this, he knew, but, well, it kind of was a big deal. Tony had successfully taught him so much so far, so he couldn't let this step be a failure.
— he'd shoved Tony backwards onto ice, and—and—
"Fuck, Steve, you know you shouldn't surprise me like this—"
"Thank you!" Steve said brightly, laughing as he texted Tony. As previously mentioned, Steve of course knew the real reason why Tony was telling him all of that again. But it was fun to sometimes tease his husband.
it, I hate it so
"Boss giving you trouble?" He teased, knowing full well he wouldn't actually be doing anything of the sort. He turned his attention back to the road for a moment as the cars in front started to edge forward once more.
"Tony? What in God's name are we doing in
. And it's...well, like I said, it's just a 'typical Steve thing',"
And then he did exactly what Tony had asked.
"My parents certainly don't give a crap, I mean, yeah, I guess Mom would be pretty pissed, but she hasn't got a backbone; she wouldn't do anything. And Howard-well, you know how Howard is. There's nothing we can do-"
And then there was the clinginess. The casual touches. The arm around Bucky's shoulder. The hand on Steve's waist.
, Steve loved this man.
"Tony," He interrupted, more sternly. He coughed again, bringing his hand up to his mouth — when he pulled it away, it was splattered with red. "I-I need to know now—"
"What the hell happened?" Tony asked, worried.
, clearing up. Steve should've been excited, but all he did was make a small noise of acknowledgement, not looking up from his phone screen. He didn't know what it was, but there was something about Tony's texts that worried him.
It was the fact that he was trapped in a small, tight space with Tony Stark.
“You feeling okay now?” He asked quietly, lightly rubbing his hand up and down Tony’s back in a comforting gesture. Despite the tiredness, his husband seemed better than he had this morning.
"It sounds good," He replied with confidence, because he was confident; Tony had helped him overcome the lack of that first. "You sure you'll be able to stop me, though?"
And a sketch of himself smiling widely, no doubt drawn by Steve's careful hand, with the words '
Tony narrowed his eyes. "I hate you,"
"Oh," Steve laughed nervously, rubbing the back of his neck. "Sorry..."
"As you should be." Happy stated with a firm, short nod of his head. "Don't wanna hear you talking about him in any other way."
Suddenly Tony couldn't breathe.
Tony watched him walk away with a fond smile on his face, thinking of how lucky he was to have someone like Steve in his life.
, curled up on a loveseat with a blanket draped over his legs, when he felt the cushions beside him shift. Seconds later, Tony flopped onto the sofa with a loud sigh, and Steve, without taking his eyes off his book, automatically lifted his arms to make room as the brunet wriggled about in search of a comfortable position before — just as Steve was expecting — falling sideways onto his lap like an oversized puppy.
"I'll never stop worrying about you, Tony," Steve said truthfully, and Tony ducked his head, feeling his cheeks redden. "I care about you too much,"
," Brock Rumlow sneered, pushing Tony against the wall and pinning him there with his arm. "You're nothing more then a useless piece of-"
"Don't be such a drama queen," Steve said fondly, rolling his eyes. "Now, come on, we need to get that nose seen to,"
"A truce," Bucky repeated. "Um, yeah, okay," And then he smiled. "Thanks, Mr Stark-"
Steve was going to be fine. The effects from the magical-glowing-stick-thing were semi-permanent. All they had to do was wait.
"We'll have the b-band play something s-slow," Steve continued, his voice breaking. "I'd hate to s-step on your..."
playing on their TV. More often than not, Tony fell asleep before the first movie even finished, which Steve always found adorable.
Steve tried to answer, and nearly choked on his own blood. Ah, right. Punctured lung. He spat red onto the concrete, wishing that he had a drink to wash away it's metallic taste, and when he tried to breath again he found it coming out in short, raspy wheezes.
He looked out of the window again, and sighed heavily.
"That's...odd," He knew exactly what Steve was talking about, because the blonde had told him this story numerous times before. But to hear it coming out of six-year-old-Steve's mouth confused him, because that particular event occurred way after Steve's current age, which...didn't make a lot of sense, really.
"Bucky," Steve interrupted, his eyes full of tears. "I saw Bucky...at the H-Hydra base..." Tony could hear him swallowing. "And on the train...I-I didn't stop him...I should...I should have stopped him..."
Steve chuckled, hooking his fingers under Tony's chin, making the brunet look up. "Looks like Rumlow's learnt his lesson, huh?" He mumbled, and Tony snorted, loosing his bashful look and replacing it with a sarcastic eye roll.
It was quiet for a while, and Tony wondered why Steve had stopped halfway. But then the quiet sobs could be heard, and the brunette tried talking to him again.
"C'mon, Mr Over-Protective-"
But, like a broken record, he just kept repeating the same thing to himself:
"I can put my own skates on," Steve muttered with a blush, but sat down anyway and allowed Tony to slip the boot over his foot. Tony hummed contently as he finished tying one shoe with his steady fingers, then moved onto the other. Steve watched him fondly, before quietly stating, "You must've put in a lot of effort to organise all of this, then."
"Yeah," Clint agreed. "We'll let you know if you're needed,"
him...
"No. Not your phone."
? Tony forced his eyes open. Within seconds of him doing so, there was another yell, and then Rumlow's face appeared, a few feet away from Tony's, as he was pushed to the ground. He made eye contact with Tony for a split-second, and then-
"It's alright, Tony," Steve said softly, realising Tony's panic. "Look, whatever...you said you wanted to stay at mine?"
Tony exhaled slowly before saying, "Alright, fiancé." And Steve couldn't help but smile warmly at that.
Tony just chuckled before skating backwards —
"Tony-"
It was Bucky.
"No problem. I'll see you in a bit, okay?" Steve replied, and Tony's heart fluttered when he added, "I love you,"
Tony flinched; Steve hardly ever swore. "Steve," He said, his voice almost a whisper. "Please,"
"What?" Steve had finally opened his eyes, and he was gazing up at Tony with them, full of unspilt tears. "No, Steve, I wasn't-I didn't mean you were odd, I just-"
But they were minor things in comparison to worst of his injuries — three bullet holes in his abdomen, each one blooming a hideously bright patch of carmine that kept spreading, gradually turning his uniform into just one shade: red. It was on the floor, too, pooling around him painfully slowly like a lazy river.
fiancé
Steve returned the joyous look and allowed Tony to take the lead as the pair made their way over to the rink. Unlike Steve, who kept his eyes glued to his feet the entire time and took about one step every ten seconds, Tony strode confidently as ever in his boots, as though he wasn't balancing on two thin strips of metal, and casually stepped onto the ice without hesitating once.
Steve wanted to give the man a hug, which he would've done, had they both been stood on the normal ground. "It's me. I can't...I can't ice skate," He finally admitted, looking down at his feet. "The last time I did anything like this was in '37, and I ended up breaking my ankle and spraining my left wrist, so it kinda put me off the whole thing, and—and—" Steve was rambling at this point, he knew. "And since then, I've—"
Tears were forming in Steve's own eyes too - full of shame, and regret, and pure embarrassment - as he watched Tony. God, he'd never wanted the ground to swallow him up as much as this before. He wanted to escape, to sprint for miles and miles away from everything and everyone, until he could forget what had just occurred-
Steve tilted his head, smiling suddenly. "
"Tony," Steve warned. Normally, he would have blushed and chuckled, but right now it was becoming very difficult to breathe, and his vision was blurry and distorted, and he couldn't really feel his legs anymore, and the only thing he could really hear was the blood pounding in his ears, and—and— "Promise me."
"Are you kidding me? He'd be mad to try anything again, what with you just around the corner,"
"Yeah," Steve finally agreed, and Tony's grin widened.
again, I swear to God, I'll-"
—" He clapped a hand over his mouth in surprise, but behind it he was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. "Steve—
"Oh, no, I—" Now it was Steve's turn to blush. "I never actually, um, got on the ice to begin with."
Steve pulled away, released his grip on Tony (the brunet whined in annoyance at the sudden loss of contact) and rolled away, all in one swift motion, until he was sat upright, leaving Tony sprawled out on the bed, and looked down at him. With a smug grin, he said: "But, sure, take the airbed," He shrugged, pretending not to care. "That's fine by me,"
"Love you too," Steve automatically replied, grinning.
"There's a lot you don't know about me, Hawkass," Tony said. He shrugged. "I learnt most of it from my mother,"
"Tony, please, I-"
"Steve, it's fine. I'm okay, really-"
After three rings, the blond picked up. "Hello? Tony?"
Bruce stared, amazed. "He just spoke,"
Within seconds Tony was standing still, having ground to a halt by tilting his skates to the side — and releasing a spray of ice as he did so. And then he spun around and stared at Steve in surprise.
"Well, uh..." Tony grinned sheepishly. "No?"
"I know, but..."
. But I know this is your way of saying I love you—" Tony's face flushed red at that, and he quickly ducked his head; his lips curled into a tiny smile. "—and the fact that you went to all of that effort for us? That's why
The soldier reached out tentatively with his metal arm, and his fingers hovered for a few seconds over the
"-I guess I better say I love you too, huh?" Tony grinned, quickly pecking Steve on the lips. "Now, c'mon, I can't be late for-"
Steve shifted on the bed. "I know," He said, quietly. "I know. I just-" He paused, sighing and waving his hand aimlessly in the air, trying to come up with words that wouldn't start up another argument. Eventually, he simply said: "I just want to help,"
"Don't," Tony said, stopping his words. He raised his hand. "Don't thank me. What's the point? I mean, it's not like we actually got to do it, since
"Uh..." Tony paused, eyes widened slightly as he realised his mistake.
There was a small noise - the tiniest huff of a laugh - and Tony couldn't help but smile a little. If the man had the guts to come and apologise, when it was clearly Tony who'd been a jerk (he wouldn't say that out loud, of course)...well, maybe he'd been wrong about Bucky after all.
"Oh?" He sounded surprised. "Really? Not even a little bit?"
of you," Steve finished, narrowing his eyes at Tony before looking pointedly at Barnes.
"What?" Steve echoed, more startled than before. He pulled away from the hug, and Tony pouted slightly - Steve was warm!
"What-"
It sounded like a mixture of things: terrifying, dangerous...and exciting. Steve was both afraid and eager to go through with Tony's plan; there were so many negative thoughts floating around in Steve's mind — all sorts of things that could go wrong — but the blond knew that if he did it now and succeeded, he'd no longer be so afraid of ice skating. Hopefully.
"I-" Tony wasn't sure what to say. "You-you remember Bucky?"
"I-" Tony stared at Bruce, then at Steve, who was beaming brightly at him, and then back to Bruce again. "That is completely irrelevant to what I was saying,"
Tony wasted no time in getting back to Steve's new room. The door had been left ajar, and Tony nudged it further open with his foot, stepping into the well-decorated room. Like before, he set Steve down on the bed, tucked him in, gave him the two teddies, and kissed his forehead. Only this time, as Tony turned to leave, Steve's small fingers managed to grasp onto his t-shirt, and he tugged lightly on the material.
"—and of
"Oh, so you know eachother too, huh?" Tony cut in, raising an eyebrow. He looked at Clint and Bruce. "What about you two? Is there anyone who
It took awhile, but Steve eventually arrived home, and sent a quick text to Tony to let him know he was back. He didn't get a reply, but it didn't really matter, because he was already in the elevator and on his way up to the penthouse. He'd be seeing Tony shortly.
"It's
He kissed him.
"For the love of-" Steve sighed, pinching his nose. "Just take it, Tony. Please," He pleaded, lifting his head and softening his eyes. Tony, unable to resist those God-damn puppy eyes, sighed and took it from him, holding it to his nose.
Tony wasn't sure what time it was, exactly, but he was listening to Bruce go on about some new test results, when the scientist's words trailed off into nothing. He was staring at something behind Tony, over his shoulder, and then he raised his eyebrows and nodded in that direction.
"It's okay," Steve repeated, with a smile. And then he pressed his lips to Tony's. The billionaire was startled at first, but then kissed back, pouring as much love into it as possible.

"Woah," Steve interrupted, cutting him off. "Hang on a second, Tony. What do you mean, 'not really'? Are you alright? Where are you?"
of locks (Steve had seen bird's nests that were tidier) made him look like a madman. But deep-down, Steve knew this comical face was just a façade. Tony also looked absolutely exhausted. The dark circles around his eyes reminded Steve of all the times Tony had pulled an all-nighter in the workshop — but that was the thing. This week, they'd spent nearly every night in bed together, with Tony, as always, curled up under Steve's arms with his head pillowed on the blond's chest. The billionaire hadn't been anywhere near the workshop, so why was he looking so tired? Was being ill really taking that much out of him? Maybe he was feeling worse than Steve realised.
"What?"
“Don’t,” Tony cut in softly, voice still muffled but also clearer than before. “You, just being here, it—it helps. It helps a lot."
"I don't know," said Tony. He gently jostled Steve in his arms, repositioning him to stop him from sliding out of his grasp. Then he looked at the blonde, and asked, "Uh...kid? How old are you, exactly?"
"'This man' is my best friend," Steve frowned, and folded his arms. "I'd expect at least
"Bye, Unca Bwucie!"
for what you did. You nearly got yourself killed!"

As he pulled the duvet over himself and got comfortable, Tony scooted along the mattress and pressed himself against Steve's side, resting his head on his chest and wrapping an arm around his waist. Steve smiled and enveloped him in a hug, kissing his forehead tenderly. Tony gave a happy sigh in response, and Steve's smile grew.
"Mmhm," Happy hummed, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. "I've never heard him talk about anyone in the same way he does with you."
Go to sleepy, child so lovely]
He’d tried to tell Tony this numerous times, but Tony was always adamant about the matter. Admittedly, that used to annoy Steve. But then he’d remembered Tony telling him about his parents’ death — how, thanks to Howard’s dangerous driving, he’d become both an orphan and the new owner of Stark Industries at such a young age — and recalled the haunted look that had been present in his while he’d told the story. He realised, then, that it wouldn’t be fair to ignore Tony’s request. Tony had enough anxiety to deal with as it was, he didn’t need the image of Steve dying, in the same way as his mom and father, praying on his mind as well.
Steve grinned, and ruffled his hair playfully.
Tony just couldn't say no to that face.

A pause. "And why are you on the
"Oh, okay," Tony said, gratefully. "Thanks, Steve,"
Steve let out a small gasp, but didn't say anything else. Curiosity overcame Tony immediately, and he slowly opened his eyes, preparing himself for rejection...
Plus, Steve Rogers had always been stubborn.
Steve stared. "Why do you
"Steve?"
"Is it what I think it is?" Steve asked, sounding suddenly dumbfounded as he reached out and grabbed the
"Okay, hang on a second." Tony kinda felt like an ass for interrupting his boyfriend's reunion with his best friend, but he wanted to know how the hell Bucky had managed to get into the Tower without alerting JARVIS, and what he was planning to do now he was there. "The hell do you think you're doing?"
Steve had to tighten his grip on the book to stop it from falling out of his hands and wacking Tony in the face as he shook with laughter. At Tony's offended look, he quickly said, "No, wait, I'm—I'm sorry, I just—You're so cute when you start babbling."
"I'm younger than you!"
"I-alright, alright, enough with the puppy eyes! I'm coming. Honestly, you're so pushy sometimes, Steven Grant Rogers,"
Tony frowned.
Tony pretended not to notice, but the words stayed in his mind nonetheless. You don't know for sure. It was true, though, wasn't it? Tony had no idea about how magic worked, or even if it was magic that had made Steve this way, and he definitely had no clue as to how to fix it. Steve was adorable like this, but what if he stayed a three-year-old forever? What if Tony never saw his husband properly again?
"What? Is he okay?"
Tony had hoped that, over the weekend, Rumlow would forget about him and not bother him anymore.
"It is absolutely
"My—My phone...?" Tony tried, praying that that was the case.
"But it
Steve nodded his little head. "Bucky was on a train," He pouted slightly. "And then...he weft, papa, but I-I can't 'member-"
they would go downstairs, hand in hand, and either go out to save the world (again) or laze about in the tower. Or go for a walk in Central Park, if the weather was nice.
"How about I meet you half-way?" Steve offered.
, what made you change your mind? And so
"But I'm not his dad! I'm his-"
"I-" Tony paused. He was clutching at the dog tags with his right hand, wiping away his tears with another. "It's okay...I-I'm sorry for being such an idiot,"
"Yeah, I suppose it's hard to keep count, huh?" He shrugged. "I have them all the time. Christ, they're amazing,"
"Oh, no," Happy laughed, "I know you're a good guy, Cap. It's nothing personal, I'm just always looking out for the boss, you know?"
it began, and Tony smiled when he noticed a little smiley face drawn in the corner of the page. The doodle was so typical of Steve.

"Okay. Thanks, Bruce,"
"Yes!" Tony insisted, and the adorable look on his face as he pouted was priceless. Steve wished he had a camera. Or some pencils and paper. "Steve, it's the absolute
"It's alright, darling. When you're ready, we'll move onto the next bit, 'kay? Take your time though, love."
"'Course," Natasha promised.
Tony opened his eyes a fraction to peek cheekily at his husband. “I could,” he began, his voice laced with humour, “but I don’t wanna.” And with that, he shut both eyes again.
"He did. He did just say yes," Tony said, startling Steve, who hadn't realised that he'd spoken out loud. The billionaire made an adorable noise, that sounded just like a giggle to Steve (
Tony shrugged. "Sometimes...sometimes I can't sleep,"
"Steve, it's okay! I'm okay! Look!"

. Tony kept repeating it, because, well, he didn't know what else he could say. He was thankful that Steve was 'back' though...
"Because I can see the future, duh," Steve deadpanned. Tony scoffed, rolling eyes, and Steve shoved him playfully. "It's because I know you so well, you idiot,"
Tony frowned slightly. He was tired, but he kept refusing to go to sleep until Steve did, which seemed to be taking a while. And so he did the one thing that he hadn't done for years.
having sex when your mom is just next door-"
'Tried' being the key word.
And yet, after seeing Steve with Bucky, looking happier and laughing more (more than he'd ever done with Tony), the billionaire couldn't help thinking one thing: hadn't he been enough? Yes, Steve had become happy and felt at home when he'd met Tony, but now that Bucky was here? He was
"Jesus, Rogers. You look like a leaking faucet," Stark quipped, turning to look at him and raising an eyebrow.
Steve gave a happy, content sigh, and nestled further into Tony, closing his eyes.
"Steve?"
"Nah," he replied, kissing Tony once more. "I'm just a guy who's very much in love with his fella."
"Always?"
, Steve thought. He placed both palms on either side of Tony's face, took a deep, shaky breath, and looked Tony in the eyes, blue meeting brown.
"Did you just...?" Tony widened his eyes, grinning. "Are-are you trying to

offering...
Steve immediately cut him off. "Wait, no, that—that wasn't what I meant," He stammered, grabbing Tony's hand. The brunet looked down at him sadly, and Steve felt his heart twinge with guilt. "Please, don't think that—Look, I'll admit I was a bit...
"What?" Steve cut him off. "Woah, Tony. Hang on. What do you mean by that?"
why Steve had proposed so spontaneously; why he'd been coughing and spluttering so much; why he'd—
Tony dug his phone out of his bag with fumbling fingers, unlocked it, and went straight for his contacts, scrolling down until he got to 'S', and then clicked on the name that, just by reading it, brought a smile to his face, despite the situation.
"That's right, baby. I'm okay."
Tony chuckled. "Well, let me tell you, Steve. You weren't half as bad as you thought you were," After a moment, he added: "Actually, that's an understatement,"
"I am
And then, finally, their lips met. Steve's were soft, and tasted sweet, but also salty from the tears. Tony's were rougher, bitten and chewed, but to Steve, felt perfect.
Oh, God, Tony had not signed up for this. Quickly, he shoved the spoon back into the yoghurt pot, raising his empty hands in the air. "Woah...Jesus, Steve, look, there's no trains, see?"
"Not a what, Steve. A
Tony hesitated, taking a moment to think about it, then slowly uncoiled his fingers and removed his hand. Steve watched it disappear back under the duvet with a small grin. Quietly, he toed off his shoes, then took off his jacket, shirt and trousers and laid them neatly on the floor. He made his way around the bed and slipped under the covers, not bothering to wear anything else other than his boxers — it was partly because he was too tired to bother getting any pyjamas out, but mostly due to the fact that, with Tony here in bed with him, he wouldn’t get cold. He never did.
Both superheroes were incredibly disappointed when the S.H.I.E.L.D. technicians managed to get the elevator working again.
”Mm. Better now that you’re here.” Tony shifted in his arms, his body now leaning more towards Steve’s, and sighed comfortably. “I must’ve—Did I, did I fall ‘sleep?” He asked around a yawn.
Came the automatic response from J.A.R.V.I.S.
"Don't be so dramatic-"
"It's...not?" Tony asked slowly, looking rather bewildered. "Then what...?"
Steve had his tiny hands placed over his eyes, so, no, he couldn't see. Tony sighed, standing up. He took hold of the toddler's wrists, and gently pried them away from his face, but Steve kept his eyes clenched shut, so Tony opted for lifting Steve out of the high chair instead. Holding the squirming child to his chest, he ran his fingers through the child's hair, something that Steve (though he would never admit it) usually loved.
to see Tony again.
...?"
"How long have you been there?" He called out, eyebrows furrowing. "When did you come off the ice? I didn't see you."
Tony lifted his head, staring at Steve in disbelief. "I-you really mean that?"
"Doesn't mat-of course it matters!" Steve yelled, though he instantly regretted it once he noticed Tony flinch at his sharp tone, and he sighed, running a hand through his hair before saying, much more quietly, "Tony, what they did to you - they could've broken your nose, for crying out loud, or worse - it's assault, and I won't let it go until you tell me who was-was evil enough to do this-"
"It never came up," Tony waved his hand, dismissing the subject. He wasn't really fond of speaking about his parents. "But, anyway...since when were you two experts in interior design? And where did you even get the money for all of this?"
Falling asleep in the warm embrace of each other's arms.
Steve stared, speechless. Anthony Edward Stark had just asked him to-
Happy hadn’t always driven Steve to and from SHIELD. Usually, Steve took himself there on his motorcycle. But now, Tony insisted that Happy chauffeured him everywhere, because he was too concerned about Steve having an accident from driving so ‘recklessly’ on the bike. Pfft. Steve was a fantastic driver, thank you very much, and definitely always stuck to the speed limit.
Steve looked taken aback. "I-I was with Bucky. I, uh, we were just at-" He paused, registering what Tony had just said, and then: "Wait, what?"
Tony smiled gently. "Anytime. Whenever you need me, I'll most likely be downstairs all night,"
"You're not an asshole," Steve interrupted, dropping his hand to his side before adding softly, with a teasing tone: "But you are an annoying, reckless idiot," and, before Tony could say anything, enveloped him in a hug (whilst carefully avoiding his injuries, of course). Tony widened his eyes in surprise, but quickly accepted the hug, breathing in Steve's comforting scent. "If this ever happens again, you call me straight away, okay?" Steve whispered, fondly stern.
"I don't think I heard that first part correctly," Tony said, instead of taking the complaint, and made his way back towards Steve as gracefully as ever. The blond couldn't keep his eyes off his boyfriend's feet —
Rumlow was quick, quicker than Tony expected, and grabbed the back of his shirt before he could escape.
"And that means it's the perfect time to go ice skating?"
"Tony, please-"
He sang.
"Steve," Tony repeated, gently pushing his hands away. "Stop worrying. I'm
. He carried on with his life, with his work, and tried to ignore the tiny pang of jealousy he had when he saw Steve with Bucky. He didn't complain. He didn't protest.
There was an awful amount of blood.
Steve had miscalculated just how much force was needed, and now he'd —
"It's okay, Steve, there's no trains. Just you and me,"
By the time he’d finished cleaning up the stain — in other words, once he’d given up aimlessly scrubbing at his soiled shirt with a wet clump of toilet paper in the gents — and made his way out of HQ, he was already half-an-hour late. Happy was waiting patiently for him outside, sat in the driver’s seat of one of Tony’s many cars, and, cheerful as always, had smiled greatly at Steve once he’d got settled down in the backseat.
—before the hammering of his brain amade him momentarily pass out.
"Oh, yeah?" Steve raised an eyebrow. "Well it doesn't seem like nothing-"
Tony smiled sadly. Then, he added, "Shrinks help, you know,"
"Look, I-I know you're best friends, and I know that he means a lot to you, but-" Tony ran a hand through his hair. "You've been spending so much time with him lately, a-and not with me, okay?! I-I'm scared that you...that you'll leave me f-for Bucky..."
"—eve? Steve!
"Sorry, Tony," Steve had said. "But Bucky hasn't-"
"Let's finally start ice skating."
Frowning, Tony looked over at Clint, who just nodded his head in the direction that Natasha had walked off in. He too then headed that way. Tony looked down at Steve, who was still sleeping soundly, and then decided to follow the pair. They were only a few steps in front of him, but Tony stayed where he was, avoiding rushing ahead to join them so as not to wake up the blonde in his arms.
Tony nodded, and said quietly, "I'm sorry,"
"Oh, yeah, nearly forgot about that," Tony replied, using his free hand to save and close his work, an amused smile on his face. ("Tony, Tony, Ton-ee! Hehehe, dat's funny! To-nee! Tooooonnnnyyyyy..."). After about a minute of listening to Steve giggling away to himself, he said, "Right, kiddo. Let's go get you some food, yeah?"
bed?" Steve continued, with the same mocking tone. "I
Tony's ecstatic grin was beautiful. "Yes!"
"Back in the forties, fellas would give their sweethearts their dog tags as a way to show them that they loved them, and that they'd never leave them," Steve informed Tony, his voice surprisingly steady. "I don't want you to think that you're unwanted, or worthless, or whatever else you said, ever again, okay? I want you to keep them as a reminder that I love you, Tony, so fucking much,"
it's nearly Christmas."
, Steve thought in amazement, watching the elegant way Tony moved his limbs as he glided across the ice.
. He's young, attractive-"
"Huh," Tony bit his lip. "Yeah, that is weird,"
Tony stared at him, coldly. "You heard me,"
Tony nodded, and mumbled, “‘Hurts.”
Tony mentally slapped himself. Of
"Real smooth, Stark," He teased, and then, without warning, he mumbled, "Oh, what the hell," and kissed Tony's cheek.
"H-Hey..." Tony said, wincing at how coarse his voice sounded. He cleared his throat, and tried again. "Hey, Steve..."
"What? No! I just, I-"
"What? No, I-I don't even know what that
," Tony clarified, watching as Steve rubbed his eyes.
"What about agoraphobia, huh? Is that it?"
Steve swallowed the yoghurt that was already in his mouth, and wrinkled his nose. "I don' wike it!"
He couldn’t tell if Tony was aware or not of how tightly he was clutching at Steve’s shirt, but his grip slackened at the sound of his voice, and Steve felt his body relax once he realised there wasn’t anything to be scared of.
"Did you get held behind again?"
"Tony, what are talking about?" Tony stayed quiet, his eyes dropping to stare at the floor. He mumbled something inaudible, and Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "C'mon, Tony. I love you, you know that. You can tell me anything,"
Tony mumbled something that sounded very much like a ‘no’, and tugged at Steve’s arm stubbornly.
Steve felt like a teenager again. He was all flustered: stuttering his words; avoiding eye contact; wiping his sweaty hands on his jeans. Tony (who had remained completely calm the entire time and was now hastily typing away on his phone) kept throwing him piteous glances, probably thinking that his odd behaviour was because he was afraid, or something. It wasn't. Steve couldn't care less about being trapped, because he wasn't, really - they were only a few floors up when it had happened, and the exterior of the elevator was made entirely from glass: Steve could easily jump out, and he'd definitely survive the fall. So no, it wasn't the whole trapped-in-an-elevator thing that was making Steve nervous.
- He sighed, folding his arms, and turned away from him to face the glass window. He gazed at the view of the city below. Oh, how it had changed since the forties...
"Shh, shh...I'm okay, you didn't hurt me." Tony kept repeating, running his free hand through Steve's hair to comfort him. "You didn't hurt me."
ol' dad,"
"I can talk to him, I can tell him to back off. And if he decides to ignore me, then I'll-"
The door slid open with a hiss, startling Barnes. His widened eyes looked directly at Tony's and he made a hesitant gesture towards the doorway. "Can I-"
The pad of a thumb carefully wiped away a stray tear on Steve's face as he let out a choked, "
In all honesty, he was surprised that he was still conscious. Super-soldier or not, three shots in the stomach and a stab wound that (he was nearly certain) had caught a major artery was an obviously life-threatening situation. Plus the gaping wound above his eyebrows and the probably-not-certainly-but-most-likely punctured lung? He didn't know what to think, other than that he was very, very lucky to be alive at this point.
. Perfect, in every single way,"
"Christ, it's just a-"
The phone fell out of Steve's hand and clattered loudly onto the pavement, but he made no move to pick it up. Instead, the blond's blue eyes simply followed it as it went (a single thought —
," the (ex)assassin grumbled, not looking at Tony, or Bruce, or Natasha, or Clint, but
Tony scoffed, tilting his head to look up at him. "Are you saying I can't hold my own?" He said, trying to lighten the mood.
you," He pulled Tony down with him as he laid back on the bed, so that the two of them were both on their backs on the mattress, Tony on top of Steve, and Tony giggled, wriggling in Steve's grasp as he tried to escape (though he was secretly loving it).
"Tony—" He finally spluttered, squeezing his eyes shut in pain. "I—I want to know—to know something, I want to—"
Tony rolled his eyes, turning around. Stood in the doorway of the communal kitchen was Clint and Natasha. The latter simply smiled, but the former was full on smirking. Tony narrowed his eyes, but didn't say a word, and pointed his index finger at Steve, who, he was almost one-hundred percent certain, was now fast asleep. Both assassins nodded their heads, though Clint still had that look on his face. Tony gave him a look too.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony waved his hand, dismissively, and then turned his back on Bucky, opening up a blue hologram of an Iron Man gauntlet. "Look, these repulsors aren't going to fix themselves, okay?" It barely came out like a question, and the actual message behind it was clear: leave, please.
"No, Stark. I-"
, but then he sharply pulled his hand away once he caught Tony staring. "Sorry,"
"I'm sorry-"
"Yeah, Steve. Always,"
A tiny, confused smirk appeared on Tony's face. "Why?"
Steve was dreaming. Yes, that was it.
"And 'cute'?"
" Steve opened his eyes with a chuckle, playing along with Tony's teasing by poking him gently in the side. He smiled cheerfully at the little yelp Tony made in surprise, then asked, "Can't a guy express how much he loves his sweetheart anymore?"
Tony sighed, though his hands didn't falter as they continued tying the lace. It wasn't until he was finished that he stood back up and said softly, "
"Steve, it's okay. I'm okay," Tony whispered, and Steve nodded, exhaling slowly as he opened his eyes.
He didn't kiss back.
Tony couldn't speak, ragged gasps of air escaping his mouth instead as he shedded tears, and then suddenly all the strength he had left seemed to vanish at once; he titled forward and sank to his knees — Bruce only just managed to get his arms around him quick enough to cushion his fall — not noticing the way the letter fell from his grasp as he squeezed his eyes shut and pressed his palms into his eyes.
"I know, but-" Tony sighed, shrugging, and instead of finishing his sentence, changed the subject: "Look, I wasn't lying when I said I was getting cold. Look at my hands - they're turning
"I was going to take you out to dinner later," Tony confessed. Steve was still holding onto the ring box, but now he was just staring at it; Tony couldn't read the expression on his face. "It was supposed to be all fancy and special, like a

"No shit, Sherlock-"

didn't turn up-"
"Tony—"
"You never use this phone," Tony stated, and Steve imagine him raising an eyebrow.
"It's fine," Tony awkwardly muttered, watching as Steve sat back down again, so close to him this time that their thighs and shoulders were touching. "I get why you-I mean, it's understandable as to why you'd want to-" He exhaled slowly. Steve didn't interrupt, so he continued, "I-I know that you care about me, and that you want, I don't know, justice, or whatever, but there are other ways to do that, without...picking fights and getting yourself hurt,"
Steve ducked his head. "Papa?" He mumbled into Tony's chest.
Steve hesitated before replying, because he'd always been bad at receiving compliments; he never knew how to answer them. He could feel the blush returning to his cheeks. "Well, you know, I—"
"Hey, it's okay," Tony said quietly, and suddenly he was right beside Steve, taking his hand. His voice was soft and caring as he said, "I can show you how to—" before he suddenly went pale. "Oh, God, wait—"
"It's Tony. Mr Stark was my

And that they were alone.

"Why?" Tony asked, tilting his head. "I know it was Steve who made you come down here, so what's the point?"

," Tony whined, lifting his hand to playfully swat at Steve's arm, "but
After a while, Tony's eyes closed too.
"Oh," Steve said quietly, and smiled despite himself. "Okay,"
"Tony, please. You don't have to protect me," Steve sighed. "But I want to protect you. And if teaching Rumlow a lesson will do that, then-"
!" Steve shouted, and Tony couldn't help but flinch a little. "Stop. It." He turned to Bucky and smiled awkwardly. "I'm sorry, he's never normally like this-"
"Steve!"
"Yeah, it shouldn't be a problem. I doubt you'll go that fast anyway," Tony said, giving him a reassuring smile and a kiss on the cheek. "You'll be fine. Just slide towards me. It'll be like a baby talking it's first steps."
"Are you sure you're okay, Steve?" Tony chuckled, and Steve released a (painful) breath of relief, realising that the short silence had simply occurred because Tony had been taken aback by his statement. "Did you just ring me up to say that you love me?"
"You said
"Aren't you going to say it back?" Steve countered, teasing lightly. Tony laughed, and it was the most beautiful sound that Steve had heard, next to Tony's voice.
"What the
"To propose?" Steve cut in, and Tony looked up in shock at how quiet his voice suddenly was.
Tony raised an eyebrow, watching Steve with a quizzical look on his face as though he was trying to work him out. And then his eyes widened, and a small grin grew on his face. "I know what'll cheer you up!"
Steve bit his lip to prevent himself laughing out loud.
All the lights were off, save for one large lamp in the living area — but when Steve got closer, he saw that the television was still on, too, illuminating the area with its soft glow. Some credits were rolling on the screen, but the TV was muted, so Steve couldn't hear the soundtrack and guess which movie was playing. On the coffee table, a half-full bowl of popcorn sat next to Tony's Captain America water bottle, which was empty, and Steve relaxed slightly, knowing his husband was most likely nearby.
"—to me. I—please, listen to me, Tony—"
"I know-"
"What?" Steve repeated in confusion.
It seemed like forever before Steve finally lifted his head, revealing wet, red-rimmed eyes and a haunted frown. His voice was hoarse as he spoke. "I-I'm so sorry..."
, he silently begged.
"Hilarious," Steve remarked dryly, feeling his cheeks burn ever so slightly.
. "-the Yoghurt Train! Choo choo!"
"I-I'm sorry, that...that was-"
," [sweetheart] He brushed a few hairs that had fallen away from Steve's forehead, and pressed a light kiss there.
"I said-" Tony replied, raising his voice with annoyance. "-that it doesn't matter,"
"How many times do I-I have to tell you, Rumlow?" Tony interrupted, trying to sound calm despite the fact that his heart was hammering in his chest: Rumlow's face was very close. "Stop talking. You lower the IQ of the entire school just by opening your m-"
"I-I have a
"Maybe I'll start acting nicer when Mr Hydra Agent over there answers some questions--"
And yet, it had.
"I am sorry, Tony," Steve replied. "I really, really am. There's only so many times I can say it, though-"
"Oh, hey, I think we might be getting somewhere!" Happy announced gleefully, and Steve was absentmindedly aware of the car moving again, this time much more quickly than before. The traffic was probably,
," Steve commanded with a smile, grabbing Tony's hand and pulling his towards him. It was difficult to get close to each other with their skates on, and sitting down on the ice for so long was incredibly uncomfortable, not to mention rather wet, so the kiss was clumsy, awkward, and definitely not the best one they'd ever shared.
And, gradually, he'd fallen in love with him, too.
...why didn't I
"Therapists," He clarified, then shrugged. "I never used to bother, but then Pepper made me go...and it does work, in a way. Sometimes, it's nice to just...talk...and who knows, maybe they've been through the same shit as you. Maybe they know how to fix it,"
"You," Tony said simply, as though that explained everything. "You're gonna cause a flood in here if you don't stop sweating. I mean, it's not
Tony wasn't jealous. He wasn't. He was just a little bit ticked off that Steve had suddenly become so...distant...that was all...
after I fell for you to turn into a self-sacrificing lunatic. Did you even think about the consequences? Why the hell did you dive into the fucking Arctic? What, you've never heard of a parachute? Or autopilot? Or--"
Tony then spotted the way Steve was shivering, and the slightly noticeable shaking of his head. The philanthropist bit his lip sadly, and slowly knelt down next to him, avoiding the hot liquid on the floor.
. Today, it was different — although it wasn’t Happy’s fault. They were stuck in traffic, and had been for what felt like hours. Whenever they moved forward, it was only for a couple of inches, nothing more, before stopping again.
"Yes..."
"G'Night, papa..."
"I know," Tony breathed, biting his lip as he tried to hide his smile.
"Then you wouldn't have pushed me away?"
"C'mere," Tony said, softly, enveloping Steve in a hug. Had he dreamt about the ice? "It's okay, see? No one's going to hurt you. You're safe now," Tony carefully scooped Steve up in his arms, making sure that he didn't leave the blanket and toy behind. He made eye contact with Bruce.
Steve sighed to himself, absentmindedly drumming his fingers against his thigh, and gazed tiredly out of the car window. It was late at night, and the sky was dark and dull; no stars were ever visible in the forever light-polluted New York City. A continuous downpour splattered heavily against the glass and ever-so-slightly blurred the view outside, so that all he could really see amongst the sea of traffic was the variety of hazy headlights and, above him, the flashing of billboards. The world looked miserable, and Steve didn’t doubt that the drivers surrounding him felt the same. He certainly did.
His name was written on the envelope in Steve's familiar italic font, but it was the tiny little
JARVIS welcomed him home just as the elevator stopped, but apart from that and the gentle hiss of the doors sliding open, all was silent. And empty. Steve couldn't see Tony anywhere. He felt his chest tighten with panic, even though the logical part of his brain was certain that nothing was wrong.
Steve laughed lightly, looking down at the brunet, and said teasingly: "Sure, Tones, whatever helps you sleep at night,"
too squeaky. "Of course we, uh, we had...uh, we had kisses," He mumbled, his cheeks heating up. "Don't really know much about the taste, though. I-I didn't really get any before or even after the serum-"
"It's only because I-"
, Steve. It's snowing!
"Hey, Steve," He whispered, waving a hand in front of him awkwardly. "You in there?"
Rogers?!"
, we're...oh, my God. But are you sure?"
"Yes," Tony said, briskly. His eyes never left the man as he wandered into the room, and he couldn't help but feel smug at the look of awe on James' face once he spotted his car collection.
," Tony whined, tilting his head back to look at the ceiling (even though he'd told Steve countless times that, no, the artificial intelligence did not live in their roof). "
"Yeah, well, I'm still annoyed," Tony huffed. He kissed Steve's head. "C'mon, squirt, let's get you back in bed, yeah?"
In the arms of your father]
Steve gave a small, barely audible sigh, and though he had no idea what the words meant, he was smiling as his eyelids fluttered closed. "Wuv you, papa..."
"Pwease stay," Steve whispered, somehow managing to do puppy eyes (AKA Tony's weakness) despite being so young.
"Tony," Steve began, swallowing thickly. He could taste metal in his mouth. "Tony, when you—when you finish this phone call—" He had to pause once more as another coughing fit took over, and Tony started calling his name worriedly, but Steve ignored him and forced himself to stop despite the agony that was currently overwhelming him, because he knew that he couldn't afford to waste anymore time, not when—well. "I need you to...in my bedroom — my bedroom, not ours — there's a bedside table with three drawers—"
"Papa?" Steve was wriggling in his grasp now. "Papa, I'm hungwy,"
"Huh?" Tony squinted at him in confusion; his nose crinkled adorably. "You mean you've just been standing there?"
"I-" Tony dipped his head in shame.
"I know, I just—" Steve began, but stopped short when Happy gave a small 'ah-ah!' and sighed in defeat. They'd had this conversation many times before. "I
, hot chocolate, and cuddles. Since Steve couldn't get ill thanks to the serum, he could spend as much time as he wanted by Tony's side. And so whenever the man was sick, he always made him a mug of hot chocolate and sat snuggled up to his side in bed, with
Steve's silver dog tags.
"I was going to take you there," Tony said. He assumed by the silence that Steve was reading it, so he continued, "I knew how important it was to you, how long you'd been wanting to go...I thought we could go together. I-I persuaded them to keep it closed for tonight, so that the public wouldn't be able to-so that we could be alone. I-"
Tony stopped abruptly and glared at Bucky, seeing red. "Don't you dare talk about my father."
Barnes raised an eyebrow, looked Tony up-and-down once, then stated dryly, "At least he gave warmer welcomes."
"It's okay, Steve, it's not real, you're alright..." He tried again, really
"Well, I do like a good challenge," Steve said, but laughed as Tony squinted at him, and quickly added: "Alright, alright," He chuckled, laying down next to his boyfriend. Tony didn't say anything, just watched, and for a while the two simply stared at each other in silence.
Steve nodded against Tony's chest, drawing a fist up to his face to dry his eyes.
Tony fell silent for a few (precious) seconds, and then finally said, "Steve? What's all this about, sweetheart? I'm flattered that you proposed, but I can't help but feel—"
What was going on?
It turns out that Tony did have to explain everything after all, because as soon as Steve laid eyes on him, his expression changed from neutral to complete panic, and he raced over to him, demanding to know what had happened.
Tony shifted a little, letting out a small, pleased hum, and said, "...Y'r still a sap."
"I'm sorry I woke you..." He shook his head, looking up at Tony, revealing the dark circles around his bloodshot eyes. "That
He felt some of it as it trickled out of the corner of his mouth and down his chin, like a tiny crimson stream, mixing with the dirt and grime, and he shakily drew the back of his hand over his mouth in a sloppy attempt to wipe it off. You need to say something. "Mmnh—"
Three days later, and Tony wished he'd kept his mouth shut.
And though Tony had sighed, still shaking slightly from his panic attack, he told himself that it was okay. Steve hadn't seen Bucky in seventy years. Steve deserved it.
"But you
"Right," Tony replied, meeting the man's gaze and narrowing his eyes slightly. "Well then, you obviously know about Iron Man, and how I can kick your ass into next week-"
FSteve's fingers grabbed at nothing, and for a moment he was still. Then, suddenly, he relaxed, his arm slowly falling to his side once again. Oblivious to Stark, he began shaking his head, slowly, and his face creased up as though he was in pain.
Tony echoed. "Tell me, Steve. What were you doing today? What was so important that you had to miss our anniversary, huh? Go on, do
"Of course, you old sap." Steve could almost hear him smirking at the comment, and he rolled his eyes. Bad mistake. He moaned slightly as the action blossomed a headache so splitting that he had to shut his eyes for a moment to regain his senses. The phone slipped a few centimetres away from his ear, and he just made out the end of Tony's sentence—
Bucky raised an eyebrow at the lack of enthusiasm in Tony's voice. "Look, I get it, okay? You don't like me. That's...that's fine, I guess. But can you just listen for a moment to what I have to say?"
to have been the
to get hurt, either!" Steve snapped, pushing himself off the bed, running a hand through his hair. "If I can do something, anything, to help keep you from harm, then I'm going to fucking do it!"
"It was a figure of speech!"
Tony grinned. "Oh my God, this is adorable,"
?" He echoed, finally peeling his eyes away from his book to look down questioningly at Tony, who was still staring at him with desperate (beautiful) eyes. A teasing smirk flickered across Steve's face for just a second before he covered it up with a raised eyebrow, and he then said as flatly as possible: "You want to go ice skating."
"Steve!"
He and Bruce were in the lab, trying to find a solution to the issue.
"Yeah. Don't worry, I'll explain everything when we meet up,"
Before Steve even had the time to blink, Tony’s hand darted out from under the covers and somehow found his wrist, holding it tight. His partner didn’t say anything, but the message was clear.
"It's okay, Tony. I'll see you in a bit then, yeah?"
"Steve—"
He didn't even have to look to know who it was.
," Tony waved a hand dismissively as he stood, wobbling only slightly for a few seconds before quickly regaining balance. "Whoops. Heh, I suppose it has been a while since I last wore these..."
Blood-stained fingers fumbled around his belt, searching for the pouch that contained a single, precious item. He breathed a shaky of relief when he found it, grasping onto it, and with all the strength he could muster, brought it up to his face.
...and knocking Tony straight over as he did so.
"I'd have been fine," Tony reasurred him.
, Steve, protect the murderer."
After a short elevator ride, the four of them ended up outside one of the guest bedrooms. Tony eyebrows twitched into a confused frown, but Natasha said nothing. Wordlessly, she opened the door, and-

Tony's words fell short as Steve suddenly shot his head upwards to look at him. "Yes," was all he said.
, "Don't you fucking
"Oh, he did, did he?" Tony said. "So,
"Please answer me..."
Holding hands as they stroll around the museum.
"One minute you were here, the next you were gone! I thought you'd hung up on me." Tony sounded genuinely sad, and Steve tried not to cry; if Tony was upset about something as simple as that, how was he going to react when—
"What? N-No, why would you—"
"Don't," Natasha insisted. "You weren't in control-"
"That reminds me, actually," Tony said, changing the subject and trying to hide the worry in his voice. "I need to see Bruce later," He was talking to himself, really (he wasn't crazy, he just did that sometimes, okay?) but Clint replied anyway.
"What?" Steve said. "Tony, darling, that's not going to happen,"
"But you—"
"I know it's sudden, Tony, but I...I need—" Steve paused, squeezing his eyes shut as another tremor wracked through his body. A single tear rolled down his cheek. "I need to know. Yes or no? Please..."
"Steve, really, I'm fine-"
He'd left a note, of fucking course, as though that made it any better. A small ripped piece of paper lay on his nightstand, with a small message scribbled on it in Steve's familiar font.
"I can't believe this," Tony actually laughed, short and harsh, more out of disbelief than humour. "You actually forgot,"

"Huh? Oh! Yeah, yeah, I think so, anyway. It's just that, well, I think his memories are a bit mixed up. One minute, he's acting the way a usual toddler would. The next minute, well..." Tony paused. "It was weird, but, he started talking about Bucky?"
"If you're going to talk about me like I'm not in the room, Steve, then I might as well just fucking leave," Tony grumbled, narrowing his eyes at Steve. He spun on his heel-
calmly wake up Tony with a kiss, and
. Steve! You still there?!"
Tony sounded relieved. "Guess your old age is finally catching up to you, Grandpa," He teased, and Steve smiled sadly.
"You don't have to do that," Steve interrupted, now blushing ferociously.
"Oh. Don't I?" He laughed nervously, but it was cut short as the movement sparked the terrible pain that had been fading away moments before.
Tony shook his head mutely; he just wanted to be alone.
The word came out quietly, barely a whisper. His eyes were wide, now, staring at nothing in particular, only focusing on the images in his head. A single tear trickled down his cheek, and Tony resisted the urge to brush it away, knowing that it could trigger another set of horrid flashbacks.
"I didn't realise..." Steve murmured, his cheeks - once again - flushing red. Tony chuckled.
Steve was halfway through the fifth chapter of
"Alright, then," He replied quietly, a small smile on his face. He drew back the covers, and climbed in next to the small child, despite the fact that he was still dressed in his regular Black Sabbath t-shirt and jeans. Whatever. Steve hummed happily, and automatically pressed himself against Tony, a tiny smile on his face that was illuminated by the soft blue glow of the Arc Reactor. The genius wrapped a protective arm around him, pulling him closer. "Go to sleep, now, tesoro," [sweetheart] Steve probably had no idea what that meant, but his smile widened nonetheless.
"I do
Steve continued, "Peggy was there too...her voice was so...real..." His voice was muffled, but the pain in it was still evident. "Sometimes, I get these visions, and I always
"If you'd given me a warning of some kind first, or maybe a suggestive biting of your lip, or something-"
Thunder clapped loudly in the distance. Shortly after, the sky was lit up as a lightning bolt struck the Earth. The heavy rain then hit the large windows of the Stark tower loudly. This continuous performance hadn't stopped since it began in the early hours of the Monday morning, and all day the usually bright New York City sky was covered with a blanket of dark clouds. Now though, as the hidden sun set behind the black abyss, the storm was getting worse: the thunder beckoning louder then ever; lightning bolts striking closer and closer; rain (and even mild hailstone) quickening it's pace.
"Hi."
"Ah, I see," Tony replied, and Steve wasn't sure if he genuinely believed him or not, but he didn't sound suspicious. "Well, it's nice to hear your voice, darling."
"Shut the fuck up, Stark," Rumlow snarled, pulling Tony forward just an inch before slamming him back into the wall. Tony tried, and failed, to hide his wince. "Stop using words to make yourself seem tough and start using your fists...oh wait, that's right, you can't, can you? Typical Stark," He added, keeping his eyes locked on Tony with a piercing glare as he leaned closer, spitting as he spoke. "Your bark has always been so much bigger than your bite-"
"It wasn't hard," Bucky shrugged, eyeing Tony. "Your name is everywhere, Stark,"
"Oh," Tony repeated, sounding like he'd just discovered something. "I see,"
Steve wasn't having any of it, removing his hands and hastily pulling his hoodie over his head, rolling it into a ball and holding it out for Tony to take. The brunet frowned, shaking his head.
"Holy shit, Steve!" Tony cursed, only just dodging the flying limb.
Being stuck in an elevator with Tony Stark was an entirely different matter.
"Oh, that. Stevie suggested that I should, uh, get used to the layout of this place if I was going to, uh, you know, stay here..."
"Yeah, but," Tony twirled the wedding band on his finger. "What if-"
Sometimes, Tony surprised Steve by coming out with Happy and joining them on the ride home. Those were the best days. There was nothing better after a long, tiresome day at SHIELD than opening the car door and being greeted by the most beautiful man in the world. It was times like that when Steve would take up Happy’s offer and raise the partition — but only so he could enjoy a private moment with his husband. Nothing too scandalous, mind you. They both knew, from previous experiences, that the back of the car wasn’t sound-proof...
"I actually think it might be more to do with magic, than science. Which goes against basically everything I believe in, but, well, we know it exists, because of Strange,"
"I'm sorry," It was Tony who was apologising now. "I shouldn't have doubted you-"
"Oh, yeah?" He asked. "What about?"
"Pa...?"
Suddenly there was a familiar, warm hand caressing his cheek and cupping his jaw, drawing him back to reality, and Steve almost instantly pushed his head towards it's touch, laying his own hand over the top to keep it in place. He forced himself to look up — to find Tony's eyes and hold his gaze there — and was greeted by those beautiful doe eyes blinking back at him, matched with a kind, soft smile and—
"There you go," Tony breathed happily, after Steve had both feet down on the ice, and kissed Steve's shoulder. "That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Steve fell silent, his mouth partially agape as he stared in awe at his boyfriend. Then, as swiftly as someone who'd only ever worn ice skates once in their life could manage — and with the aid of the bench — Steve rose to his feet, reaching out to carefully cup Tony's cheeks in his warm hands.
” He always found it hard to resist Tony when he was like this. “But you’re gonna have to let me go so I can get ‘round to the other side.”
Steve shook his head to himself, a soft smile on his face despite Tony's light reprimand, and locked his phone, letting it rest on his knee. He stretched a little in his seat, and caught Happy's eye in the rear-view mirror as he let his head fall back against the headrest. The pair gave each other a knowing look, and Happy raised his eyebrows in acknowledgement.
"Nothin'"
Steve laughed louder, adjusting Tony in his arms to get a more comfortable grip. “So lazy,” he teased, but he didn’t mind at all, really. Tony wasn’t hard to carry.
"Of course I'm sure. There's nobody else who I'd want to spend my life with other than you."
“Aw, love, I’m sorry,” he said softly, tightening his hold on Tony ever-so-slightly to bring him closer. “Is it still the arc reactor...?”
"Yeah, Steve?"
"Oh, yeah?" Steve raised an eyebrow, smirking. "Okay, then. But you'll be-" He wrapped his arms around Tony so quickly that the brunet actually squeaked in surprise (not that Tony Stark would ever admit to making a noise as unmanly as a
"Hush," Steve laughed. He felt Tony's shoulder shake as he chuckled too. "You should try and get some sleep. It's late enough now as it is—"
It fell silent. Steve blinked, eyes widening. He averted his gaze for a second and staring at the wall. "Rumlow..." He mumbled, the looked back at Tony and then said with fury, "Brock Rumlow?!"
Steve couldn’t help but smile at the sight. “Aw, sweetheart,” he breathed, shaking his head fondly.
, Steve knew him so
They stayed like that for a while, locked in eachother's embrace like two jigsaw pieces, the only noise being the sound of their breathes and, of course, the clicking of metal on metal around Tony's neck.
Tony brought his arms up in an attempt to shield his face, but he wasn't fast enough - Rumlow's fist connected with his nose instantly, and both the power behind the punch and the fact that Tony wasn't prepared for it sent him tumbling to the ground.
"R-Really?"
"I see that Nat and Clint took good care of you, then," Tony said, sarcastically, as he rushed over to the child. He slowly crouched down, so that he was at the same level as him. "What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare? Hmm?"
"It's snowing." Steve didn't need to look down to know that Tony was gazing up at him with those wonderful eyes.
Bruce had been listening, but there was a small smirk on his face that told Tony there was something else on his mind. "It's nothing-"
His workaholic of a husband obviously wasn't happy with being stuck in bed all day. Steve knew it was hard for Tony to 'switch off' his brain and relax, so a small part of him always felt bad for asking him to rest all the time. Ultimately, however, he knew it was the right thing to do. Tony's sickness wouldn't last that long if he took it easy — he'd be back on his feet in no time.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "What?"
"Don't you dare apologise," Tony interrupted, leaning closer. "I only stopped you because, well-" He tilted his head, staring at Steve's plump lips. "-if you're gonna make a move-" he smirked mischievously. "-then you've got to do it properly,"
An amused smile worked it's way onto Steve's face.
"I know," Tony said quietly. "I-I remember. But Steve—"
hot in here,"
Now, Steve hadn't realised at first, but Tony must've assumed he was being followed by the blond as he circled the rink: he didn't look back for Steve once. It was only when Tony passed Steve for the umpteenth time (at a much closer distance than before) that he suddenly noticed the blond unexpectedly standing at the side, and not skating behind him like he'd first thought.
He let out a fond little laugh, and typed out a reply.
Tony looked up at him, his eyebrows twitching slightly. "Mm?"
And then Tony booped Steve on the nose. "You, Steve Rogers-" He said, interrupting the solitude. "-are a menace,"
Steve pulled away from the kiss, panting. "Not yet..." He breathed, blushing slightly. "I-I'm not ready to-"
Bruce snorted.
"Yes, it is."
"Don't wanna!"
"It's not..." Tony breathed in quickly, before exhaling a shaky sigh. "It's not the ice, is it?"
Wrapping his hands tentatively around the wooden handle, Tony pulled the drawer —
"What? No, Steve, I can't-"
"What was that stunt about, Stark? Trying to make out that you're all big and tough?
Tony sat, with his shoulders slumped, on the edge of the bed, staring gloomily at the leaflet in his hand, reading the bold, black letters over and over and over again:
"Yeah?" Tony grinned. He gave Steve's hand an excited squeeze.
," Steve scoffed.
Steve's hands were shaking, but it was more out of excitement and an adrenaline-rush than anxiety or fear. He could do this.
, trying to clear his mind from all thoughts related to Bucky. And it was working, in a way.
"What?" Tony questioned, sratching his head. He had a mental debate with himself, before saying, "Oh, what the hell. Let him in, J,"
"It's alright Steve, I'm here," Tony gently placed a hand on his shoulder, going for the more soothing approach, rather than shaking him. Steve flinched anyway, and Tony jumped back in surprise as he suddenly shouted, his voice raw with emotion.
. Tony thought.
Was it? Fuck, Tony hadn't intended for this to happen. He was supposed to have simply blamed tonight for his upset, not Bucky. Since when did he have such little self-control? (It was those God-damn puppy eyes.)
But Tony just wordlessly shook his head, and Steve’s face fell.
There was a gentle pat on his arm, and Tony looked down to see that Steve was staring at him, his bright blue eyes wide and round, an adorable smile on his face. "Wuv you too, Tony!"
— that was another thing he refused to let go of. He was clinging to it as though it was a lifeline:
"But I want to," Tony insisted anyway, rubbing his thumb over Steve's knuckle. "I want to make you happy."
!" His grip on his mug was released, and his arm shot forward.
"If I ever see you touching
"You had Kisses back in your day, right?"
"C'mon, now," Tony grabbed the spoon, and began making childish noises. "Here comes the, uh-"
That was, until the music cut out.
"No, don't apologise. This is my fault, I-I should've realised," He kissed the top of Tony's head shakily. "Yes, Bucky's my best friend, and yes, he means a lot to me. But you, Anthony Edward Stark - you mean everything to me. You're intelligent, charming, hilarious, adorable, brilliant, caring, sweet, sexy, beautiful, and
"Steve, no,
met this guy?"
"Oh, I'm
"Oh," Tony felt his cheeks heating up again. Damn it. "Well, in that case, you old sap-"
. "Oh, I dunno," He muttered.  "'Flirt' is such a misunderstood word..."
Suddenly, Steve was pulled away from his thoughts by a familiar
. "O-Oh..."
Tony chuckled lightly, his heart warming with the use of a nickname. "Yeah, well," He shrugged again. "You can always try. And if it doesn't work out? Well, I'm here...if you ever wanna...talk..."
"It..." Tony paused, taking a shaky breath. "I think it already has..."
?" He scoffed. Steve raised his eyebrows in surprise at the tone of his lover's voice.
fine!" Steve exclaimed, eyes widening as he got a closer look at Tony's bruised and bleeding face. "Who-who did this to you?! How did they-
“I really wish I could help.” Steve pressed a kiss to the top of his head, his eyebrows furrowed with sadness at the thought of Tony being in so much pain. “But I don’t know what to—“
"You seem to like children more then you let on, that's all,"
And then he was off, whizzing around the rink at an incredible speed that Steve had only seen national champions pull off. Tony had, very clearly, done this before.
"Of course he can. He's, what, about four years old?"
"I'm not a complete asshole, you know," Tony stated. "I'm not going to cast you out onto the streets or anything. How cruel,"
Steve had to bite down on his lip to keep from laughing. "Oh,
"Shh, it's okay Steve," He repeated. "It wasn't real, it's just-"
"Tony..." The soldier muttered, and it was the word that the billionaire was waiting for him to say. Because he knew he'd wouldn't have existed in his flashbacks, and so he must be back in reality. "M'cold..." He really was shivering, too, so Tony pulled him even closer until Steve's head was resting on his chest, near the arc reator.
her...but I never normally hear her beautiful voice..."
P-please!"
"If-If you truly care about me, if you truly love me, then you won't pull any reckless shit-you'll leave it alone," Tony was practically begging now, and,
"Tony!" Steve barked, stepping in front of Barnes as though to protect him. "Stand down--"
It was a stupid question. And of course Steve wouldn't answer. His blue eyes were glassy with tears, and even though he was staring at Tony, he was clearly looking at something else. His pupils were darting left and right constantly, like he was searching for something.
Tony took a while to reply, and for one pain-staking moment, Steve thought that the line had cut off.
"I know you did," Tony tried again. He was hopeless at comforting people. "But don't worry, you're back in the real world now," He winced when he said it, because he knew it was slightly harsh. After all, the forties
"Every word," Steve said, still looking like he was about to cry, though the tears hadn't actually escaped yet. Then the look in his eyes changed, and he smiled. "I know words don't always mean a lot, so let me-I can show you just how much you mean to me-" He kissed Tony again, and then reached into the bedside drawer where he kept a numerous amount of things: a sketchbook, a pencils, a compass (with a photo of Peggy inside), some old sweetwrappers, two photos (one of himself, The Howling Commandoes, and Peggy in black and white. The other a recent picture of him and Tony, arms wrapped over eachother with huge grins on their faces) and, finally-
with me, Rogers?" He was doing his best to sound cocky and teasing, despite the fact that inside his heart was fluttering like a fucking moth.
"I know, Steve," Tony whispered. He'd never seen him so broken before. "I know," He placed a hesitant hand on his hair, then ran his fingers through the blonde locks. Steve didn't object, so Tony didn't stop.
Steve stopped pacing. "Tony-"
"That was the cutest thing I've ever seen," Clint said, as soon as Tony had closed the door. "Or heard, for that matter. Tesoro? Vai a dormire adesso? That's what you said, right? I didn't know you could speak Italian,"
[Go to sleep, go to sleepy,
Steve opened his eyes and frowned. "You work too hard. You should've been sleeping,"
"Ugh. Magic," Tony shuddered. "Let's not repeat that dreadful word again, 'kay? And as for that Doctor-" Tony scratched his goatee. "I'm still convinced that he stole my facial hair idea,"
"Uh, nothing really," Tony shrugged. "Just something that happened with Steve earlier-"
," Tony finished, before Steve could say anymore. "It was just an accident. And if—if anything, I should've known it wouldn't have worked, so it's kinda my fault..."

"Yeah? Well, I bet they only paid a

. His eyes never left the supersoldier as he spoke. "One week. It took
It turned out that James Buchanan Barnes wasn't dead after all.
"I wasn't talking about my mom," Steve said, and then he grabbed Tony's hands and looked him in the eye. "I have training on Monday. I'll see Rumlow-"
"Tony," He greeted, trying to keep his voice steady, which was rather difficult when you were bleeding out. "Hey."
"You're one of those people, Cap." Happy responded softly. “Tony’s life wouldn’t be the same without you.”
"That wasn't...I mean, I...I said that wrong...." Now Tony wanted to blush.
Steve had stopped struggling, but his eyes were still tightly closed, and he was still clearly upset over...a fake train that didn't even resemble a train? Tony frowned, wondering what on earth could've caused such a reaction.
Surprised, Steve smiled humorously. "Are you about to give me the shovel talk, Happy? Because I'm afraid you're about five years too late for that."
It fell silent. Steve blinked, then gave Tony a pitiful, forlorn look, and silently reached out and brushed away a hot tear on Tony's cheek that Tony hadn't even realised had fallen. The brunet blinked several times, attempting to get rid of the unspilled tears in his eyes, then gave up on trying to be subtle and simply wiped them away with the back of his hand, blushing shamefully. Steve still didn't say anything; he waited until Tony removed his hand from his face, and then leaned forward, wrapped his arms around him, and pulled him into a tight hug.
"Steve, hey, listen. I'm an asshole, remember? Assholes get punched a lot; this is nothing," Tony tried to reassure him. When Steve tentatively reached out and gently brushed his hand against his cheek, Tony, automatically leaning into the touch, added: "I'm okay, Steve, I swear. Although, it is getting quite cold; maybe we should head back to-"
It didn't sound like anything special, but, well, it was
"Don't be silly, papa!" Steve giggled. "I'm not dat old, not wike you!"
It seemed to be everywhere: he could feel it's warmth near his left leg, where a knife had been dug deep into his flesh; he could taste it's coppery tang on his tongue as it filled his mouth, staining his teeth red; he could see it as it dripped from a large gash on his forehead and into his right eye, temporarily blinding him.
"Right. Sore topic. My bad," He actually looked slightly apologetic. "So you're really not-"
"Hang on," Tony held up a hand. "What was that about exploring my tower?"
For the third time that night it was silent again, and the only noise was the ticking of the clock, and the gentle moans escaping the men's mouths. Neither noticed the door in the kitchen opening, nor did they see Natasha as she grabbed a glass from a cupboard walked quietly over to the sink, and filled the cup with water. She drank two small sips, then turned around, leaning against the counter.
Steve narrowed his eyes, and in the distance, the bell rung. "He better not do," Steve grumbled, and Tony, even though he was the victim in the whole ordeal, laughed.
Now, as he was pushed to the ground, he was mentally cursing at himself for being so optimistic.
"Thank you," Steve whispered, earning a small smile from Tony. Then the blond stepped forward a little, lifting his hands and placing them on Tony's shoulders, before bringing the man towards him to hug him affectionately — an action which Tony accepted instantly. It was a little awkward at first (Steve had to be mindful of the sharp blades under their feet, after all) but after a few seconds of shuffling, their bodies finally settled into place: Tony automatically buried his face in the crook of Steve's neck; Steve rested his chin comfortably atop Tony's coconut-scented hair. "I love you so much,"
It took quite a while for Steve to get the hang of things — Tony had made him shuffle (not skate; it was definitely
"Uh, excuse me,
"Steve?!"
"Hm...yeah, actually, I guess you would be able to escape-"
"Tilt your head forward, pinch your nose a bit, yeah, that's it," Steve's mom was a nurse, so he knew the basics. "And, no. Of course I'm not happy, Tony-look at you!"
"Why, how many other 'Rumlows' do you know?"
, Steve thought sadly. “I just got back. How are you feeling?”
"Y-yeah, I bet," Steve replied, stammering like crazy. His palms were practically dripping sweat: he wiped them hastily on his jeans.
"Well..." Steve scratched the back of his neck bashfully. "Yeah."
, he thought.
. Absolutely
Tony wasn't joining him today, though. He was suffering from a cold, and Steve had ordered him to stay in bed and rest. As dramatic as that seemed, when you had a fairly large lump of metal encased in your sternum, limiting your lung capacity, a simple cold could quickly turn into something worse.
"Wait, what-"
Laughing and smiling at one another's corny jokes as they walk home.
"And you won't look me in the eyes,"
"I-I can't believe you just-" He paused, wiping tears from his eyes. "Oh, Lord. You j-just kissed me!" He repeated, and then cracked up laughing all over again.
"Yes!" Tony exclaimed. "You were fucking amazing-" Steve's face went as red as a tomato. "So much so, that I'd like to go for round two,"
"I-" Tony paused, because
"Yeah, I know," Steve replied, "I'm not worried, I'm just-" He paused, unsure about how to finish that sentence. Completely screwed? Totally in love with you? Geez.
"I thought I told you to quit trying to be a hero, Stark," Brock spat, bringing his foot forward to kick him in the ribs. Tony winced, bringing his arms around his sides as an attempt to shield them, and squeezed his eyes shut, bracing himself for the next blow.
,” Tony breathed, smiling and tilting his head back in relief. “You’re home...”
A low groan escaped his throat as he tried to prop himself up against the broken remains of an old brick wall, jarring his injuries in the process. The pain was unbearable — it felt like an icy wind, choking the breath from his lungs as though a noose was around his neck. Fiery bursts pulsated around each wound, intensifying with every shuddering breath he took as he tried to compose himself.
"I sure as hell hope so," Tony muttered. "But, uh, yeah. I should probably go find Bruce before it gets too late. Can you, er...would you mind watching Steve? Just...make sure he's alright, yeah?"
Tony ignored the outburst. "Why are you crying?"
"Steve. I wasn't laughing at you," Tony promised. "I was laughing...I was laughing because when I asked you if you wanted a, uh, a kiss, I was talking about a Hershey's Kiss. As in, the little chocolate sweets. Not a...not an actual kiss..."
... Steve sniffed and shook his head, looking away—
. I just...I did it for
"What? I never said-"
And that's when he suddenly realised: how was he supposed to explain this to his parents? They'd warned him before about continuing this reckless behaviour, about trying to be some kind of hero-
"Yup,"
of the rink for parties," Steve corrected, raising his eyebrows and pointing at the ice. "They don't let them have the full thing!"
. Steve and Tony's. Tony and Steve's. It hadn't changed since that day when Steve had bashfully confessed his feelings to Tony, and it wasn't going to change, either. At least, it wasn't supposed to.
could he skate so well? "Did you say you can't ice skate?"
"Right," Tony said. "Okay. Well, I'm sure Steve appreciates it and everything, but you really didn't have to go to all of that trouble. It's not like Steve's going to stay this way forever,"
"Papa? Whatsa Wa'son?"
, Tony told himself.
” Steve grimaced at how loud the AI’s voice was, and automatically looked down to see if Tony had heard. He didn’t want—
"You're
, Tony thought with relief.
"Of course I'm gonna say yes, you idiot."
“Yeah, sweetheart.” Steve grinned, then started to move towards the elevator. He looked back down and saw that Tony had closed his eyes again, seemingly unable to help himself.
Steve didn't know what to say...okay, that was a lie. He knew exactly what to say (YESYESYESYESYESYES
"Really?" Tony questioned, tilting his head. "How many have you had?"
"Well, it's true,"
"Tony-"
"P-Papa..."
There was a small clicking sound of metal on metal as Steve let go of the dog tags that were now around Tony's neck. They came to rest infront of the arc reactor. Tony couldn't speak, his words caught in his throat.
. He gave Tony his best warm, comforting smile, and said, “Hey. It’s okay. You’re alright.”
Before Steve could even think of a response, Tony smashed his lips against his.
with his hand.
"Keep telling yourself that, Tony," Bruce commented. He waved his hand aimlessly in the air. "Now go and get the child some food,"
Tony squeezed his eyes shut.
"Shut up,"
He almost cried.
"I'm not over-protective!"
"Alright, alright," Tony said, raising a hand. "Fine. I get it. It was all Hydra's fault, yada yada yada...but that still doesn't explain how he got here, or what he plans to do when-"
you secretly loved this-"
Though he was inexperienced, Steve knew exactly what Tony was asking for when his tongue swirled against the Captain's bottom lip. He parted his mouth slightly in compliance, allowing Tony's tongue to enter, and then the billionaire took over, sliding his tongue around Steve's warm, wet mouth. His experienced hands worked their way around Steve's body, sneaking under his t-shirt and exploring each crevasse, each line along his perfect physique. Then his hands trailed down to Steve's belt buckle, and then further, reaching down and cupping his-
"Tony, I need you to breathe, okay? Whatever's happened...we can fix it, alright?"
"Uh, sweetheart?" Steve questioned, gazing in bewilderment at the empty rink in front of them. "Aren't there usually...more people?"
"You are an absolute
"I-Is that what you say to yourself i-in the mirror each morning?" Tony managed to get out, and yeah, okay, so it wasn't his best comeback, but considering his current position, it was the best he could come up with off the top of his head. "Because it's-"
"You just
"Look," Tony replied, and Steve averted his gaze to see that, in his outstretched palm, Tony was holding something small, covered in silver foil with a small white tag sticking out of the top, and written on it in was a blue font was the word HERSHEY'S.
Steve nodded silently, and then sighed, leaning his head back against the wall.
"Who's dat?" Steve questioned, his eyebrows twitching as he frowned slightly. "Papa-"
"Oh-"

Tony gaped at him. "I-" He blinked, dumbfounded, and Steve couldn't help it: he burst out laughing, loving the surprised look on Tony's flushed face.
"Yeah," James nodded. "I feel like I need to-"
And then he burst out laughing.
- "Steve," Tony forced out, eyes wide in shock. "Steve,"
"Three years old, huh?" He said, then added, jokingly, "Not ninety?"
"You were triggered. It's okay, don't fret about it," Tony said, nodding at the spilled drink. "It happens sometimes. I know you can't help it, and that's ok. But you're safe, alright?"
"No offence, Tones," Steve mumbled. "But it's kinda hard to find somebody with the same life experience,"
"I don't. I just got a bit...held up...with something..." Tony lied, wincing when he heard Steve sigh.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony had waved him off. "I get it," He'd sat in front of the two, leaning against the couch, and had expected Steve to lightly run his fingers through his hair, or something. But nothing happened, and, when the movie was over, Tony saw the the two had fallen asleep. On eachother. Typical.
"Don't," Tony interrupted. "Don't do that, Steve. That's another reason why I didn't tell you, you know; to stop you from blaming yourself,"

With a sad, exasperated sigh, he had ran a hand over his face and through his brown locks and-and then he had left.
," Steve corrected, narrowing his eyes. "I'm fine,"
Steve couldn't breathe for a moment, though this time it wasn't from his injuries.
"Steve, sweetheart, I'm not going to leave you,"
"You just kissed me," Tony stated, raising an eyebrow. A small grin appeared on his face. "You just
And now he was sat on their bed, still waiting, clutching at the leaflet in his hand.
Steve stepped into the elevator, then said, “Yeah. I didn’t wanna wake you.” The elevator doors closed smoothly, and, letting out a small laugh, he asked, “Do you think you’d be able to stand?” He already knew what the answer would be.
annoyed about it.
Instead, he pushed Steve away, his eyes wide.
Tony blinked at him. "What? No, I'm not—
Unable to help himself, Steve slowly knelt down beside the sofa, and reached out carefully with one hand, gently brushing a few loose strands of hair away from Tony’s damp forehead. His partner didn’t stir once, just carried on snoring softly without reacting at all to Steve’s movements. Clearly, he was in a deep sleep. Steve wanted to wake him up, to let him know that he was back, but he also knew Tony needed the rest. He rarely ever got enough sleep as it was, but now more than ever did he need the energy.
"Don't. I'm not angry at you, I'm just-" Steve sighed, and Tony could've sworn that there were tears in his eyes. "Why didn't you say anything on the phone? I made you walk all this way-what if something else happened? What if you-you could've collapsed, for crying out loud, or something worse could've-"
"No-"

"Shh," Tony whispered, grabbing a nearby blanket and wrapping it around Steve. "It's okay. Go to sleep,
ringing out. Pulling his phone out of his pocket, he smiled warmly at his screen once he saw who’d texted him, and that was before he’d even read the message. He assumed that whatever his husband had sent wouldn’t be anything too dire — and he was right. It was just Tony being Tony.
"And, you won't have anyone-" Steve thrusted lazily against Tony, only once, in a teasing, jokey manner. "-to
"Yes, you can sleep with me," Steve said, and Tony turned to him, raising an eyebrow.
scribbled in the top left corner that initially caught his eye, and so Tony went for that to begin with, his hand momentarily brushing against the ring box as he did so.
, Tony, I-I'm so
Pressing kisses on their bodies as they lower themselves onto the bed.
"Why does he keep doing that?" Tony looked at Bruce quizzingly.
Steve bit his lip to try and prevent what would undoubtedly be a very sappy grin from breaking out on his face. "I can imagine. No doubt I’m the same.” He knew better had a tendency to...
"Yes, you are. You are worth everything," Steve said with an honest smile. "I'm sorry, Tony, for the way I treated you, and for the way I made you feel,"
"And then there's me. Boring, old, fucked-in-the-head Tony," He continued, eyes welling with tears. "I know I'm nothing special, but you could've at least-"
"Goodnight, Steve,"
, it wasn't your fault," Tony insisted. "Besides, I wasn't asleep anyway. You know me..." He chuckled, trying to lighten the mood.
Steve opened his eyes.
...it felt real..."
Steve complied, thankfully. His eyes landed back on Tony again, and his eyebrows furrowed in worry as he silently reached forward, cupping Tony's chin lightly in his hands. "Tony," He echoed, leaning forward until their foreheads were touching, closing his eyes. "
"Uh, Capsicle?" Tony's voice interrupted his thoughts. "Look, if you're really worried about this...just, don't be, okay? SHIELD will know about this. Fury or Hill or that Fitz guy I met once - he was a smart kid - have probably already ordered some of their minions to sort this out. We'll be fine. We've just gotta wait for a bit,"
Suddenly Steve had the pad of his thumb on his cheek, wiping away a tear, and-
And then it hit him - Tony had finally found his happy place, only now it was about to be ripped away from him because of Bucky's arrival, and he wouldn't be able to-
"How did you know I was gonna-"
The words were falling out of his mouth so quickly that Steve was only just able to cut in with, "I want you to—to remember—"
"I know." Steve repeated, nodding understandably. "I'm glad Tony has people like you looking out for him. He deserves the best life."
It was slow and soft, comforting in ways that words would never be. Steve's hand rested below Tony's ear, gently caressing his cheek as their breaths mingled. Tony ran his fingers down Steve's back, tickling his spine, and pulled him closer until there was no space left between them, and he could almost feel the delighted beating of his heart against his chest.
. Steve took pity on him, realising that, despite his teasing, Tony
Tony gave a sudden, short intake of breath, his eyes flying open, and gasped, “What the—“
Tony fell silent in shock.
? Man, this is the dodgiest line
A white sealed envelope.
. "Maybe?"
"You're a billionaire," Clint deadpanned, as though that explained everything.
"There wasn't anything you could've done, Steve. It wasn't your fault,"
"I'll get J.A.R.V.I.S. to let you know if I need you for anything," Bruce said.
"I thought he was a good guy-!"
"Oh?" Natasha tilted her head. "You've never mentioned it before,"
Tony widened his eyes. "Steve, c'mon, it's just yoghurt. Be a good boy? Choo ch-"
"Your IQ is exceptionally high, yes, I've been told. By you. Many times."
"Stop it!!"
The mentioning of the one-and-only Captain America made Tony lose focus on his mechanics. As creepy as it sounded, he had set those protocols before. But it wasn't to stalk the soldier. He knew about Steve's nightmares, his PTSD, his flashbacks...and he wanted to make sure the blonde was alright. Because Tony himself knew how terrifyingly realistic those dreams could be - he knew from his own experience.
After one last final blow, Rumlow left him laying in the mud, and Tony let out a shaky breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding as a single, hot tear rolled down his cheek.
"Yeah..."
"Papaaaaaaa-"
"Sure," Tony replied, grateful. "Thank you, Steve,"
It was then that she saw them - Tony, covered from head to toe in grease, his hair sticking out in odd angles, and Steve, his own locks a mess, with old tear trails on his cheeks. She choked on her drink slightly. Then, wordlessly, she reached into her pocket, brought out her mobile, and snapped a photo, before spinning on her heel and leaving the room with a mischievous grin on her face.
"You little shit," Tony managed to say, a disbelieving, amused grin working it's way onto his face. "Steven Grant Rogers, how

, they section off a
Steve lifted his head from where he'd been cradling it in his hands, facing Tony with wet eyes, and muttered a faint, barely audible, "What?"
His singing voice was slightly rough, unused after all those years, but he still sang in tune.
"Oh, shut up, you goofball," Tony rolled his eyes, lifted his arm again, and curled his fingers towards himself in a 'come here' motion. "Get yourself back on this bed right now, or so help me, I will drag you down myself,"
"I..." Tony inhaled slowly, then ducked his head and let out a small, "Yes. I was going to propose."
"Tony," Steve warned, his cheeks heating up even more, as Tony doubled over, hands on his knees, shaking with giddiness as he tried to contain his amusement.
Go to sleep, lovely child,
hurt), pushed himself off the wall and tried to make a run for it.
"Steve? You still there?" Tony interrupted his thoughts. "You haven't fallen asleep again, have you?" He chuckled.
"Boys, c'mon now, let's not start a war," Natasha interrupted, stepping forward. "James," She nodded in greeting.
Shit. Shit, shit,
"Consider this some part of a truce, I guess,"
) and added, "Yes, I'll marry you, Steve. Yes, yes,
"What's that?" Steve said, playing dumb. "You
The night was supposed to have been perfect. Now, a trip to an art museum sound boring, and to Tony, well, it was. Yes, he often appreciated the brushstrokes of paintings and the smooth pencil lines of portraits, but his plan for the evening was purely for Steve's benefit. God, how excited he'd been to give Steve the leaflet, to watch the look on his face change from confusion to disbelief to pure giddiness as he read the leaflet. His lover had been rambling on and on about the place for months, promising himself that he'd go and see it sometime - he never did though, because, being Captain America, he didn't have the time, and he was also worried about being spotted by paparazzi. After all, how would Steve be able to truly appreciate the museum's work if he was constantly being yelled at by crazy fans? Because of this, Tony had gone to the trouble of making sure that the entire exhibition was closed off from the public that night (he could do that - he was Anthony Edward Stark) so that they could have the building to themselves, and to allow Steve to take as much time as he wanted.
"I-" Tony swallowed. "Um, I-I'm still kinda, uh, see, I'm still at school-"
"So you would've kissed me back,"
"Peggy..." He mumbled, shaking his head. "I'm g-gonna need a r-rain check on that d-dance,"
"Nah, it just wasn't hard to guess." He was quiet for a moment, concentrating as the long line of traffic started moving again. It only lasted a few seconds, however, and then they were stationary yet again. Both Happy and Steve sighed. It fell quiet again, until: "He talks about you all the time." Happy finally added after a moment.
"No, it's okay, I-I can walk," Steve's house wasn't far away from the school.
"You-" Tony waved a finger at him, then flopped his arm lazily back onto the mattress. "You absolute-"
from—"
Tony swallowed a lump in his throat, and combed his shaking fingers through his hair. "Fuck, I—I had it all planned out," He stammered, pushing himself further towards Steve. "I was going to—to—"
"Tony, stop," Steve cut in hurriedly, because Tony was looking more distraught than ever, as if the whole thing was his fault. No, no, no. "It's not the ice."
. You're mine, and I'm yours, and that's
"You're avoiding my questions-"
Tony went to bed, he always woke up again the next day with a comfortingly warm (and
Steve knew better than to argue. He’d tried to once, the first time Happy had taken him to SHIELD, but Happy was just so goddamn
"Quit it," He muttered, because Steve wouldn't stop staring, damn it! "Don't give me those puppy eyes, Steven,"
"Papa, dats rude,"
"Nobody you'll know," Tony lied - Rumlow was on the school's football team, the same team that Steve was a captain of. "Just some jerk looking for an excuse to pick a fight-"
"I know it's not ideal, but we need to stop the bleeding with something-"
Tony suddenly stopped walking, thinking those words were directed at him, but quickly he came to a realisation that they weren't as Steve started talking again.
The blond's face broke out into a grin. "Yes, I'll marry you. Yes, yes,
, I love you so much, you have to remember that. I would never leave you. You mean too much to me," And then he pulled Tony into another hug, more tightly than before. Tony barely flinched, just allowed it to happen, keeping his arms loose by his sides. He rested his head against Steve's chest, knowing full well that he shouldn't be doing it, that he should be angry at Steve. But he couldn't help it - he'd missed this physical contact from Steve so much.
"Uh-huh," Bruce nodded his head. "That's usually a normal thing to see, for Steve,"
"Oh, right," Tony laughed lightly. "No offence, but, well, you kinda always get confused about new, modern stuff-"
"I don't know what happened," Steve furrowed his eyebrows. "I was trying to make hot chocolate-" He looked down at the mess on the floor and sighed, "-and when I heard the thunder, something inside me just
"I know," Tony said, "I know. But there's nothing we can do. The teacher's are shit when it comes to stuff like this - they just stick jerks like Rumlow in detention for an hour and expect them to behave afterwards, but it doesn't work-"
Tony squinted, tightening his grip on Steve as he leant forward to take a closer look (Steve giggled at the sudden movement). The image clearly displayed a close-up view of a sample of blood, Steve's blood, full of red and white blood cells and numerous other normal things found in the human body. But there was something else, too. "That's..." Tony frowned. "Is that the serum?"
"I don't know, Steve-!"
Despite everything, the selfie made Steve laugh quietly. Tony's mouth was stretched wide in an exaggerated, open grin, and he was giving a thumbs-up with his free hand. That, matched with his wide eyes and his absolute
"Hey, I need these hands, remember? How else am I supposed to keep you entertained?"
"Steve, baby, what's—"
"Tony," Steve cut him off. "You're forgetting someone,"
"I don't know-"
"Shrinks?"
going to change. You're a rarity, Tony. There's nobody else out there who's as talented, generous, wonderful and loving as you. I-I'd never leave you, because I love you, and there's no chance that I'd ever find another man like you, because you're
"It's okay," Steve mumbled, pulling Tony into a tight hug. He kissed he top of his head, whispering in his ear: "Whatever's happened, we can sort it out. It'll be okay,"
"Steve?" Tony's voice suddenly seemed like it was a million miles away. "Steve, what's wrong?"
He wasn't sure how long he'd been there for, though he was pretty sure it had been a while from the pins-and-needles and the stiffness of his bones, when Steve had finally stumbled into the room.
did Tony just say?! "What?"
"Uh, excuse you, Mr Rogers. I am not an idiot. My IQ-"
"Oh, that's okay," Tony told him truthfully. At Steve's look of disbelief, he continued with, "No, really: I can teach you how to be more confident; how to skate better; how to—"
"There's
"Could I..." Steve paused, gazing into Tony's eyes. He hadn't noticed before, but Tony's eyes weren't just brown. They reminded Steve of the old barn door at Clint's house: flecks of deep mahogany married with lighter hues of gold, full of strength despite everything the man had been through, and full of life. Steve was captured by them for a few seconds, unable to look away, because they were just so...breathtakingly beautiful. He took a deep breath, and gently placed a hand on the billionaire's cheek. "May I kiss you?"
He hadn't realised that the laughter had stopped.
[go to sleep now]
And then he began to read.
"But you were frozen solid for what, seventy years? Surely-"
"For the love of-"
Steve inhaled what would most likely be his final breath and said softly, "Thank you, Tony."
There was only one person who he trusted enough nowadays.

, for Steve, and it had been that way for a long time. And so hearing the man flirting with him was like a Godsend.
Tony stared at him. "Who-" He blinked, and then his face changed when the realisation hit him. He leaned back, shaking his head stubbornly. "No. Sarah's already done enough for me as it is-"
"Steve," Tony breathed happily. "God, I love you—"
, Tony had texted. He had waited, patiently, to hear the blonde's heavy footsteps as he approached. He had waited, patiently, to see the puzzled, adorable look on the blonde's face. He had waited, patiently, for hours, not moving from his spot even when the clock had turned from seven, to eight, to nine, to ten...
"Right," Bucky nodded, clearly not offended by the sudden blunt tone in the billionaire's voice. "Sorry-"
"Actually," Steve grabbed Tony's arm. "I was gonna say that it's because I love you,"
Tony gave a small, barely audible gasp against Steve's mouth, and flinched, startled and surprised.
storm...my
—the owners a rather large sum of money." Tony gestured proudly at himself with a smug grin, before reaching past Steve to grab a black skate off the bench behind him. "Trust me, I've sorted it all out. Now, sit down, would you? I can't have you balancing on one leg as I tie your laces or you'll look like some bizarre flamingo."
Steve made a small hum. "Erm..." After a moment, he grinned goofily, showing off his baby teeth. "Fwee!" He held up seven fingers. Tony laughed.
Wow, they'd been busy.
And Tony? Tony had helped. God, how he'd helped. Steve couldn't be more thankful - he'd told him himself. Tony had introduced him to as much tech as possible, and he took to teaching Steve slowly and patiently. He'd shown him movies, songs, and told him about all sorts of historical events that had occurred in the pre-defrosting years. He had held Steve close when he needed it, whispered calming words during his panic attacks, and had always just been there for him. He'd shown Steve that he wasn't alone, that he had friends, and that he had a family (the Avengers weren't related by blood, obviously, but that didn't matter).
, he thought, gazing down at himself.
"And-" Steve tilted his head forward, tugged lightly at Tony's ear lobe with his teeth, and murmured, "You won't have anyone to whisper
"...Is he alright?" Tony questioned, a hint of worry in his voice.
"Tony..." He mumbled, closing his eyes.
Steve blinked, and his cheeks were suddenly getting warm. "Oh," He swallowed, and then ran a hand through his hair. The gesture was unusual - normally Steve kept his golden locks perfectly styled - and Tony looked at him oddly, tilting his head.
?" He waved his hand aimlessly in Tony's direction, still not meeting his eyes.
to you, over and over-"
"Why on earth would I say—"
"I love you too," Tony said automatically, and Steve smiled despite everything, because those words were music to his ears. Then Tony said, "But ever since Bucky..." He trailed off, his voice barely a whisper, but Steve managed to pick it up it with his enhanced hearing.
Barnes seemed taken aback. "Wait, what? Really?"
"I don't want you to get
Tony nodded slowly. "Yeah, I know. But Steve's younger now, so surely the serum shouldn't still be there?"
. I can't..." and waved his hand in Tony's direction. He quickly added, "Besides, it was entertaining to watch you."
"Please," Steve begged, a tear rolling down his cheek. "I need to know."
"But you already have," Tony said, sadly. "It's fine, I-I totally get why. Bucky's from your old life, he understands you, he-he's a frickin'
about coming to training again, you piece of-"
. Watson is a person,"
"I missed you too, Buck," Steve grinned, and brought the two of them even closer together by tightening his grip on the soldier. It took a few seconds for him to register what was happening, but then Bucky was closing his eyes and hugging him back, his anger disappearing all at once as his shoulders sagged in relief. The two best friends looked so happy to be with each other again that Tony would've found the whole situation endearing -- if it wasn't for all the weapons Bucky currently had strapped to his body, or the way his shiny metal arm was wrapped ever-so-tightly around Steve's body, or the fact that he had just turned up, unannounced, after somehow sneaking into the tower. Tony had nearly spilled his coffee in shock when those elevator doors had opened and revealed
"Doesn't matter," Steve mumbled, cutting him off and ignoring his fiancé's —
"This is Howard's son?"
"You're incredibly cute as a baby, Steve," Tony said quietly, scooping some more yoghurt onto the spoon. "But I can't wait to get my husband back,"
"You two...ever since he arrived, he-" He sighed, shaking his head. "It sounds ridiculous, but you, uh, you..."
"What's the date today, Steve?!" Tony snapped, and yes, he was shouting now; he'd had enough with...with all of it. "Huh? What's the damn
It was
Steve gave a small, embarrassed shrug. "A little, yeah..."
"Mm," Steve replied. "I know the feeling,"
"Huh?" He blinked. "Tony, I-"
certainly took Steve by surprise.
"Well, what else am I supposed to say?" Bruce asked. "Metal?"
"I love you too," Tony replied instantly, and Steve squeezed him lightly in his arms before finally pulling away. Tony was still blushing, and Steve couldn't help but grin at that.
"It's fine, you don't have to," Steve said softly. "I understand,"
"You hear me?" Steve hissed, and Rumlow, abandoning his usual, cocky, don't-mess-with-me façade, nodded rapidly, visibly swallowing, and -
"Meet me here after fifth period, okay?" Steve whispered, once they'd broke apart, and Tony nodded, smiling. "We can walk home together,"
"Steve, why would anything be my—"
. He kept telling himself this, even on Friday (movie night), when Steve and Bucky had squashed up together on the loveseat, Steve and Tony's loveseat, and forced Tony to sit on a cushion on the floor.
"Again, whatever helps you sleep at night, Tony," Steve teased, ruffling his hair. Tony batted his hand away, pouting like a child.
"I am listening, sweetheart, but you're still worrying me a—"
"Christ, Steve," Tony breathed, not realising that Steve was only being playful. "We are

"What? But it's nearly four. You never said you had anything on tonight-"
It was an ancient relic of a phone that was incredibly simple to use, and it contained just one crucial phone number. Steve accidentally smeared his blood over the screen and keyboard as he frantically pushed the dial button. He pushed it against his ear, and after a few rings—
"I know, I know, I just-" He sighed, pulling away from the hug and cupping Tony's face in his hands. "The fact that this guy has been hurting you all this time, I-I

"What do you mean,

Tony didn't mind. Of course he didn't.
"Am I
"They are not," Steve snorted, shaking his head with an amused smile. "Honestly, Tony. Your face was bleeding several minutes ago and your nose is turning all sorts of shades of purple - and you're worried about your

"Food,"
) arm wrapped around him. And it was nice. Today, however, had been different. Today, Tony had woken up from a nightmare, screaming silently, clawing at his arc reactor to confirm that it was still in his chest, and Steve? Steve wasn't there. He wasn't there to gently calm Tony down from his panic attack. He wasn't there to wipe away the shameful tears. He wasn't there to whisper 'it's okay' and 'you're safe' over and over again as he held Tony in his arms.
"Rumlow," Tony interrupted, speaking bitterly as though the name burned his tongue. "It was Rumlow,"
," Tony tried again, and finally, finally, Steve heard him. His head turned to face him, and all of the anger in his eyes disappeared instantly as he took in the sight of Tony, who was now leaning on his elbow, trying to sit up.
"I told him I felt bad about having you drive me everywhere," Steve admitted quickly, "and that I'd have had no trouble using my bike—"
Steve's head snapped up, and he stared at Tony. "'A dream come true', huh?" He repeated, and then he smirked. "Really, now?"
"Tony,
"Honestly, Cap, it's no trouble." Happy twisted his head over his shoulder to give Steve a warm smile. "You don't have to worry."
"You love me really," Steve mumbled, pulling him closer.
— protests that followed the interruption. "That doesn't—Tony, I-I need you to listen—"
Suddenly there was a hand at the base of his spine, warm and strong, and Tony's voice in his ear. "Relax, darling. Hold onto the side and pull yourself on. You'll be okay."
"Uh...huh..."
, an ice rink, of all the
"Tony, I don't need cheering up. I'm fine, honestly-"
Natasha pointed at him, then waved her hand.
"Hi," He echoed fondly, turning onto the next page.
This appearance was the complete opposite of what the rest of the world usually saw, and while Tony always looked handsome with his fancy suits and styled hair, Steve much preferred seeing Tony like this. Minus being sick, of course. There was just something about seeing him in the warm, oversized clothes, matched with his adorable, fluffy hair, that had Steve itching for a sketchbook and pencil to capture the moment on paper. Instead, he quickly whipped out his phone and snapped a photo of his partner, unable to resist how sweet and soft he looked. God, was he beautiful.
"You've got that look on your face-"
Tony must've noticed his discomfort, somehow. "Are you okay?"
It never came.
Get out of h-here!"
"Oh, my God, the look on your face-"
Suddenly frustrated, Steve gave a little huff and muttered, "
"Don't think about it, it wasn't real,"
The thing is, Tony had done so much for Steve. The blonde had lost everything and everyone he loved (or so he thought. Bucky being alive obviously proved this wrong, but that wasn't the point). He'd crashed into the ice leaving behind a world at war, only to wake up in the future with the world
"Yeah?! Well, sorry doesn't cut it, Steve!" Tony shouted, standing up. "You can't just expect me to accept your apology and move on, Steve! One apology won't excuse the last few weeks-"
Tony let out a small huff, wriggling in Steve's arms to push himself further against his husband, as if to pointedly say,
"Huh?" Steve questioned, frowning. You know, you should really stop with the one-word answers, Rogers. "No, I-that's not it,"
"He was, as a child," Bruce commented, looking over his glasses at Tony. "But the test results say differently. Look-" He grabbed the screen, and spun it around so Tony could view it. "Do you see that?"
been Steve's 'real world' once. Thankfully, Steve didn't comment on it.
"Mm," Tony hummed, his eyes wandering over to the airbed on the floor that Steve had pulled out earlier. "Speaking of which..."
"Oh, Steve," Tony held him closer, and pressed a kiss into the child's hair (it smelt rather strongly of apple, which was odd, but Tony didn't comment on it). "Of course I'm not going to leave you. I'll always be here when you need me,"
He was grabbing them now, which was odd, because they were
"But it ended on a
"I said-" Steve exhaled, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Look. Hydra kidnapped Bucky, okay? They took him, and the changed him. They brainwashed him. They-" Steve stopped himself, realising that he was bringing up old memories that Bucky most definitely didn't want to remember. "Sorry, Buck. The point, Tony, is that Bucky wasn't himself when he...when he did what he did. He wasn't in control of his own body. He couldn't stop-"
"Uh, I think you'd be Watson actually-"
"For crying out loud," Tony mumbled. "What's he doing here?"
The once boring, plain guest room had been turned into a child's paradise, full of toys and books, and all sorts of wondrous things, each a shade of red, white, or blue. The walls were covered in posters and canvases that all displayed things to do with superheroes, and the large double bed had been transformed, and now, instead of it's usual white sheets, was entirely Captain America themed. Tony couldn't help but smile when he noticed the two plush toys that were centred on the pillows: Captain America and Iron Man.
Obviously.
When Tony awoke the next morning and saw that Steve had changed back to his regular self, he yelped in surprise-
"Tony," He breathed, releasing his grip on Rumlow. The bully fell back to the ground, but he didn't stay there. Tony had never seen anyone move so fast: Brock was up on his feet and running away in seconds, stumbling as he went. Steve barely paid him any attention, just grumbled, "And don't you even
Steve held Tony tighter for a few minutes, not saying anything, and the brunet let him, even as the cold wetness of the ice began to seep through his clothes.
"Very funny," Steve couldn't help but smile - then he remembered the conversation topic, and his grin fell from his face, replaced with a worried frown. "C'mon, Tony. Tell me, what's bothering you?"
skating) a few times around the perimeter of the rink just so that he could get his bearings, and each time he seemed to thankfully grow more and more confident — but soon Tony was adamant that it was time for him to move away from the side and try and ice skate freely.
"Hey, do you want one now?"
"Steve—"
," He breathed, rushing over to his friend's side. "Oh my, God, are you okay? What's wrong? What's happened? Tony? Tony—"
The disgustingly sweet metallic scent of it in the air almost reminded him of an abandoned abattoir that he and the other Avengers had once investigated. His mind was too hazy now for him to remember exactly what they'd been doing (it had been a rather odd mission) but he would never forget the putrid smell of death that had lingered in the air, just as it did now.
, Steve wanted to protest, feeling shame rising up inside of him. God, Tony had been so excited to come, and here he was messing it all up. See, he'd put on a happy face and pretended to know what he was doing, but the truth was Steve had only ever been ice skating once in his life: back in 1937, with Bucky. And...It hadn't ended well. Steve had avoided ice skating after that. But now Tony was expecting him to be able to skate, and he'd organised the whole thing just for Steve (as he'd explicitly made clear), yet the blond couldn't even step onto the ice, let alone glide around as perfectly as Tony had done, and—
