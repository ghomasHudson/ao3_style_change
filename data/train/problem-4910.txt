Benny nods politely -he’s one of the friendlier guys- and then per protocol explains who will be driving Cas, which car they’ll be taking, and who will accompany him, as if he cares. But beside the boring talk, no conversation is initiated, leaving the two of them to ride the elevator in dead silence yet Castiel doesn’t feel uncomfortable. This is one of those moments where he’s ashamed to admit he enjoys the privilege of being Mr. Winchester’s ‘husband’ sometimes: he doesn’t owe these people anything, especially not small talk when all he wants to do is curl up and wallow in defeat.

“Gabe-“
The worried eyes on him grow even more intense at hearing his weak whispers. “A dog bit you? Cassie, you shouldn’t even be around dogs! Your allergies-“
“No, no! Please don’t!” With just the twist of a key, Teddy is out of his room, running straight towards the plate of food in front of Cas. With him still sitting down, he and the dog are the same height which makes the second encounter all the more terrifying. He wants to scramble away but it’s too late, his movement involuntarily disturbs the eating animal and it snaps. It’s just a warning bite, a quick nip though still at full force with teeth sinking into his jaw and cheek.
He used to despise fake people, still does, yet he’s now become one himself. Perhaps not voluntarily but Cas is still made to blend in with the crowd. The neat haircut, the new suit.. Castiel knows none of that was offered because Mr. Winchester wanted to spoil him, no, they were pieces of a puzzle called ‘covering up one of the biggest schemes in history’, much like the make-up put on him was meant to cover up his pale skin and replace it with a cosmetic blush as to not raise suspicion.
Funny, isn’t it, how that’s exactly what a dog would do?

Despite how busy the hallways right outside the glass conference room are, the actual space is overwhelmingly quiet as Castiel and Sam wait there on their predicament, tension only building the longer it goes on.
* Chapter 06 : Horns - Bryce Fox
It’s like choosing between the plague and cholera.
What the hell was going on?
“Alright, alright. Jeez, didn’t know the sex was that bad.”
“I’m out for dinner with my brother, we-“
One of the guards standing in the crowd with him grabs his arm tightly but when Castiel looks up at the man, those dead eyes are still unmovingly trained on their target that’s to be protected at all times: Dean Winchester. A noisy yet perfectly controlled round of applause lets Cas know the reason behind the warning gesture. It’s time.
Why is he being so gentle tonight? All it does is freak Castiel out more. Castiel who’s now full on crying and gasping for breaths, not able to string together any coherent thoughts whatsoever. He just knows he wants ‘it’ to stop, whatever ‘it’ is.
“You see,” Mr. Davies begins as soon as they step into the back alley, “Ketch was an important and valued member to our..
“Shh,” the man says while pulling out a semi-hard cock, his free hand coming to rest in Castiel’s hair “don’t ruin our night.” A fight is about the last thing Cas wants right now, he can agree on that, so he swallows and gets ready, but not before asking where Dean knew Hannah from.

“Woah, woah, woah! I’m not jealous, broski. I’m w-“
“Yeah, I know but.. are you sure? This is some serious stuff, Castiel.” She takes a deep breath after the prolonged silence gives her the answer and then continues in a hushed voice. “Alright, so. Good news? I managed to find a file on him, that at least tells us there
The actual medical exam takes no more than fifteen minutes. All Castiel was allowed to do was sit there and let Dean answer any possible questions, that’s what they’d discussed beforehand. Even now, as he’s still sitting on the couch, fidgeting with his glass of water to wish away some of the nerves, Mr. Winchester is doing the talking for him.
* Chapter 02 : Broken bones - Kaleo
Dean absolutely relishes in how the stranger flinches under his touch.
“Gabe, no! I wouldn’t-“
Would his authority work in a situation like this? Of course not, what was he thinking? It’s dead silent for only a split second this time before the raging argument continues with a “You don’t get to do this! You involve me, make me participate. And- and I can’t even go to the police, can I? You probably own them. You own
* ...
“I think you’ve done enough.” Dean grits out before holding Castiel’s gaze for a moment of quiet anger and then eventually turning away again, “not another word” he adds, successfully ending the exchange however meagre it might have been.
Perhaps it’s the British accent or maybe this person isn’t as bad as Mr. Winchester, the reply doesn't sound too precarious. “Are you going to play hard to get?” Oh, he’s not playing at all, this isn’t a game. “Look, mister, maybe I gave you the wrong impression but I’m not a whore!”
There’s a gun shoved in Dean’s face within seconds, a handful of weapons being raised and cocked immediately after. “But” Mr. Winchester repeats without so much as a flinch, trusting his bodyguard and perhaps his own agility to get him out of that meeting alive. “Since I’m such a generous hombre and I truly do want to keep the streets quiet for all of our collective benefits, I’ll let you name your price.” The offer gets accompanied by a steady hand pointing at the empty chair Mr. Ketch was sitting on before the anger had erupted.
For some reason, that gives Castiel a sense of clarity. However sad it may sound, Dean not remembering him means Cas has not been present in such a sick, vile, evil mind over the past decade and that, to him, is a small comfort.

“I need you.”
He gets an eye roll followed by a muttered
None of that seemed to bother the man though.
He waits for a few seconds, listening for any further disturbance that never comes. Whoever wanted to contact him apparently didn’t deem it important enough to ring a second time over it, and in that case; neither does Castiel.
“Brother, I’m serious. Quit dicking around! If something’s wrong you need to tell me
’ Dean thinks, nearly says out loud.
Of course when Gabriel comes back into the room, unceremoniously dropping candy bars after stuffing his hands with more than he can carry, he’s as chipper as ever and doesn’t seem aware of the danger they’re in, making it all the more urgent.
* Chapter 08 : Mercy - S.Mendes (acoust.)
“Sir?”
The minute Mr. Winchester’s driver had dropped him off after a lone trip to the hospital, he’d opened his laptop to maybe find a way out of this contract but the first thing that had popped up on his feed was a news add from a small, amateur lifestyle blog Cas liked to follow in his free time.
* Chapter 05 : Satisfied - Reignwolf
“It’s still my body!”
“You okay, Cas?”
“Did I fucking stutter? Take me home! I’m fine. Besides, I gotta check up on those fucking idiots, make sure Novak hasn’t ran off again! God, I can’t even trust Paula anymore.”
it rings in his head, reminding him of his slip up that might as well could have gotten him fired so he takes a deep breath in, lifts his chin, and puts on his best fake smile perfectly matching Mr. Winchester’s one as he approaches the gathering of chatters.
Unable of overpowering a wave of trembling, he sinks to the floor, Teddy now barking right in his face and deafening him while doing it. The animal might simply be as confused as Castiel is, but what does Cas know? He hasn’t the slightest idea about how dogs work so to him it’s a clear threat.
“Oh, honey. I know.”
A deafening round of applause marking the end of a pretentious display just puts the cherry on top. But before he gets a chance to turn away and leave it all behind, Mr. Wesson is right there behind him, a firm hand on his back guiding him in the exact direction he had hoped to avoid all night.
That’s why he isn’t pushing away the hand around his cock.
* Chapter 12 : Run in the rain - Tom Grennan
“I saw you get shot! You- there was blood, everywhere.” And now it’s on him, too. “Fuck, you’re bleeding!” but Castiel’s hands get pried away from where they’re trying to assess the damage to Dean’s body. Mr. Winchester opens the jacket himself, revealing the bulletproof vest underneath. “The blood-?” “Fake,” Dean smiles softly, “it was all fake.”
“Are you enjoying yourself?” Mr. Winchester asks right as he pushes Cas against the wall. He doesn’t wait for any answer, probably didn’t really want one either, as his lips already hungrily close around Castiel’s throat where they kiss and suck with an unparalleled possession. “All these people, they keep telling me,” another kiss, “how good you look, sugar. How good we look
Isn’t it funny, how one’s mind -even in the face of disaster- every so often decides to focus on that one, insignificant thing amongst the misery surrounding it, and transforms it into some twisted lifeline to hold onto?
* Chapter 08 : Mercy - S.Mendes (acoust.)
When Gabriel leaves, the guards are still there.
This is fun, though his patience is running thin quite quickly.
“Oh. No, no, he’s got it.” Dean explains. “Don’t you, Mr. Novak?” But before Cas can utter another word, defend himself, anything, Dean has his back turned on him already, motioning to the valet to notify the personal driver.
What was he thinking? His mind is clear about one thing though: it was a moment of weakness and vulnerability but Cas thought he was stronger than that. He’s known for a while now, years in fact, that he craves comfort, someone to hold him and tell him it’s going to be alright. How he fell right into the scheme of believing that person is Dean, was a mystery to him.
It hurt. Not just the stretch of his lips as they were breached by the hardening dick, but also the stitches pulling at already torn skin, undoubtedly making a new wave of blood trickle down the very mouth sucking down the thrusts to the best of its abilities.
It’s nearly two in the afternoon when he finally spots Dean descending the big marble stairs leading down into the large entrance hall. The man looks in a hurry as he crosses the neatly polished floors with a quick pace to his stride, already motioning to his driver to get the car warm and running. No time to waste, it seems. Perfect.
“Mr. Novak, please try to calm down. Okay, sweetheart?”
“Cassius Milton, huh? God, your parents must have really hated you.”
“Gabriel, please.”
Castiel blinks away the tears.
The bruises on her face from where Dean had hit her seem even more prominent in the low light but all of Castiel’s mustered up courage was quickly drowned out by the yelling reaching his bedroom. He was going to confront Mr. Winchester, even if it meant he’d get seriously injured -or worse- while doing so.
* Chapter 02 : Broken bones - Kaleo
“Sorry, just- just a sec!”
“I’m sorry! Truly, I am! Mr. Winchester picked me up, insisted on bringing me home, I simply haven’t had access to my phone until now.” He inhales softly. If only he could transmit regret through waves.
On his milky skin, nothing but beads of sweat like dew drops clinging to dying flowers in a last attempt to make the surface look more alive than it really is. But onlookers had declared him dead already, even the paramedics were ready to call it. After all, there are only so many drugs one’s vessel can take before fragile strings and coiling ichor decide it’s time to lay down their arms.
“I see. How’d you meet anyway?”
“Am I supposed to wear it?”
“You don’t like it? Is that it?” The change in the man’s tone didn’t go unnoticed. It had been creepily gentle before where now it was back to that signature coldness Castiel had gotten to know, and soon enough he found himself torn between wanting back the softness, no matter how out of character it had sounded, and actually feeling a sense of comfort when the harshness had returned.
Castiel thinks as he looks towards his boss in a quiet kind of ‘save me’ way but he’s only met with another glare that almost physically hurts because of how murderous it looks. Fine. “I apologize, Mr. Winchester” he grits out forcibly.

He can only stare up at the furious green eyes in disbelief as his heart breaks impossibly further. All he wanted was to be held, to have someone hug him tightly while they whispered it was going to be alright, that it was just a nightmare.
“So… really how are you doing?”
“You were far away, huh? How long have you been sick for?”
* Chapter 19 : Where the river ends - OTEP
* Chapter 10 : Bloody city - Sam Tinnesz
Whatever happened that one night was made to be forgotten.
“We’re not here to announce a death, sir. We’re here for you.” They exchange a quick look, one Castiel can’t make out. He didn’t do anything wrong, did he? “We were informed by a concerned someone that you might be in danger. The person in question feared for your safety and after they were unable to reach you, we were called.”
Castiel looks away in shame.
* Chapter 08 : Mercy - S.Mendes (acoust.)
‘Home’ was a request to be set free,
When he makes his way into the office that morning, he’s surprise to see Mr. Winchester already has a cup of coffee on the polished desk, suddenly making the one in Cas’s hands feel less than worthy to be there at all, as if it has no business interrupting the apparently better version of itself.
Gabriel tilts his head slightly when he looks up again. They lock eyes and no matter how badly Cas wants to look away from the questioning gaze holding him down, Gabriel seemingly has no intention of doing such.
Having the allergies he does meant he’d spent a lifetime avoiding any prolonged contacts with dogs which in turn brought a certain ingrained fear along with it. Sure, he liked some of them, if they were nice and calm and small, but this was no doubt a trained guard dog, the only thing stopping it from actually hurting Cas was Dean standing there, ready to interfere if necessary.
… “I can’t afford this.” Castiel tries once again, however painful it may be to admit when standing amidst such luxury occupied by none other than the elite themselves. “Consider it an engagement gift.” Mr. Winchester sighs, unimpressed.
“I went to the hospital and you were gone! They said you left in a hurry, that the man you were with handled the discharge but they weren’t allowed to tell me more so I drove my ass to your house as fast as I fucking could. Guess what? You weren’t there! No phone calls, no texts, nothing! Do you realize what that looked like?! Fucking hell, Cas!”
“Why?”
“-you didn’t. You didn’t do this.”
“Good. You’re just going through late onset withdrawal. He said you’ll be okay. Drink plenty of water, have some rest, yada-yada-yada. You won’t be getting the medication he prescribed though.”
* Chapter 12 : Run in the rain - Tom Grennan
“Heya, darling” Dean says oh-so-sweetly before flashing his dazzling teeth and then, completely unexpected; bends downs, slides his hand up Cas’s cheek and kisses him. It’s firm and possessive and just on the verge of too long to be publicly acceptable but it’s all by design of course. It’s an act.
“Yeah, okay. I get it.” And off he goes to go sit in the back of a car in silence for the next forty-five minutes because Mr. Winchester’s driver isn’t exactly the chatty type and conversations simply don’t flourish. Believe him, Cas has tried.
“I’m Cassius, and I’m an addict.”
the reason behind bright purple blossoms might be. But the seriousness in that question leaves him no choice.
Maybe, just maybe he was not mistaken when he saw Dean’s breath hitch. “Glad you asked. I have a proposal.” And just like that, the perfectly composed business man is back without the slightest hint of discomfort previously shown. “I want you to marry me.”
“Are you feeling alright? You look like shit.”
It’s a pleasant change when bumps in the path are eventually replaced by smoother gravel, followed by a driveway set in stone which in turn leads up to house at the far end of the property, tucked away by yet another set of overgrown greenery as if it was a secret.
* Chapter 14 : Far from home - Sam Tinnesz
“Very well then. If Mr. Novak has no decency to even listen to my proposal, I’ll go ahead and file the charges. See you in court, gentlemen.” Then, without further words, he picks up his notepad, stands up and makes his way out of the room without sparing any of the men another look.
to smile, to behave. His words accompanied by a painful squeeze to the thigh.
“Good. Yeah, good. Things are good.”
A big commotion interrupts them in the middle of whatever the fuck was going on. It gave Castiel a moment to breathe. He was relieved for a blissful few seconds until a third officer comes barging into the room which instantly makes the others stand up and wonder what was wrong.
So why do you fill my sorrow
“About two months ago” Cas answers truthfully. The fingertips vaguely gliding over the faint scars on his chest remind him of how tender the skin still is in some places, it reminds him why he now drinks his coffee cold.
Intense eyes soften at that, their ferocity ebbing the tiniest bit. “Darling, I’m not concerned about what you are or what you call yourself. You cost me a lot of money tonight. You could be a horse for all I care, I’d still fuck you with the millions I gave away for that pussy of yours so, I won’t ask again; come here and suck my cock.”
meeting Mr. Bloodthirsty Junior, but what choice did he have? He hadn’t been allowed to leave the CEO’s side at all during the past two weeks since this started and it was slowly beginning to take a toll on him both physically and mentally. It became exhausting, constantly having to watch what he said, how he acted, even how he stood or blinked in every attempt to minimalize retribution.
If only Gabriel would finally stop talking, perhaps Cas could begin working on a plan of getting the fuck out of there before this situation could pull him to the depths of no return. That was if the guards would allow him to leave in the first place.
Playlist so far:
Really? Castiel just stares at Dean from under the water, hands still covering his crotch.
“Gabe..”
“That’s right, darling. You fell. Nothing more, nothing less.”
His overdose had proven nearly fatal so after two full weeks in the hospital, he was sent straight to the center he’d been to before much to his own disgust. Feeling his father’s disappointment ooze out of the old man was one thing but having to face staff members who, last time, sent him off with their typical ‘stay clean!’ bullshit was utterly haunting, and on top of that: not really encouraging.
This takes Castiel completely by surprise. Not in a single scenario he’d formulated in his head, not even in the over the top and possibly far-fetched ones, did he imagine Mr. Winchester asking
Hearing dress shoes click on designer marble is something he’ll never get used to. At least it means someone is coming back for him instead of leaving him to his own demises when he can’t possibly scrape together enough willpower to even get off of said floors. “Was I not clear?”
“Paula can make you something. I mean, she’s not here right now but I could call her.”

like an addict, too.”
Most of all, he remembers how empty he felt and it wasn’t from the lack of food. No, he felt sad, alone and abandoned even though, technically, he was the one who demanded to be left alone. Wasn’t that what he had wanted? What he still wants?
* Chapter 03 : Monsters - Ruelle (acoust.)
, but all he gets is a very angry Winchester screaming in his face.
But Castiel is softer than he thought. If Mr. Novak had just been some woman to be seduced, fucked and discarded like all the others, Dean would have gotten rid of him already, thrown on the pile of forgotten garbage, skin touched by a king no longer of import.
“Any previous treatments?”
He smacks Castiel right across the face in one smooth outburst, hand lowered immediately afterwards. It wasn’t meant to hurt, not really, or the damage would have been greater than a slightly stinging cheek and some reddened skin. This wasn’t meant to punish.
Oh, bring it on. “Listen, Mr. Winchester,” he says surprisingly calm though dripping with sarcastic respect, “I know you think you’re all that, some untouchable prick who’s only at the top because his father had a lot of money, but you’re nothing more than a whiny asshole with daddy issues. Maybe if you didn’t have such a tiny dick you wouldn’t be trying to overcompensate with that big factory of yours!”
in it aside from the packed fridge and plentifully stocked bar where the man is currently hanging out.
“No, please. Let me finish. I really shouldn’t have. Even with me being worried, you didn’t deserve my preaching, I think you’ve been through enough already.”
This clearly makes the man uncomfortable. Torn between meeting his client’s wishes and his own professional choices. “I insist.” he eventually settles, “I’m doctor Beaumont. I’ve been under the Winchester’s employment for three decades now and I will be at your service as I have been at Sir John’s and Sir Dean’s.”
“The Hilton. Yes.”
“His staff is taking great care of me and his doctor even paid me a visit. Please, don’t worry about me, Gabriel. I’m sorry for making you so upset.”
“I swear to God, you-“
* Chapter 09 : Miracle - The Score
Did he- did he just say that out loud? Castiel snaps his eyes up and the surprised look he’s met with tells him enough; he definitely just said that straight to this armed man’s face. Shutting up would be the right thing to do here, definitely if he wanted to refrain from obtaining further harm, or if he valued his life enough, but the gates are open and all of his pent-up anger just floods out of him.
Or at least, that was the game Castiel thought he could play because a whole, generous ten minutes later, his phone rings again, this time dragging him up and into a fully awake state though none the less pissed off. “What?” he snaps, breathing hard as he waits for the response. “Not a morning person are we, Mr. Novak?” Even in words rumbled in a deep voice, Castiel could hear exactly what a tit-playing, cock-sucking, ass-licking twat this man exactly was. It almost makes him laugh.

“Why? I mean-“ Cas can’t even finish his sentence, too dumbfounded by what he’s hearing.

“Yes, stupid. Stupid boy sometimes. Always so angry, argh.”
“Hey," Dean eventually says, smiling, "we still need to have an actual wedding ceremony.”
Was this it? Could this be his one and only chance?
“Alright, brother, gotcha. So how’s married life treating you?”
It’s almost cynical, having to stand there while listening to another one of Winchester’s business presentations about that damned factory since that’s specifically what got him in this situation in the first place. Knowing what he knows now, which is whom exactly he decided to provoke a week ago, he evidently would’ve just kept his stupid mouth shut.

he hears the woman exclaim and right when he’s about to step down into the living area, Cas can finally see where all the hassle was stemming from: Teddy runs past him at full speed, his nails ticking against the stone floors and tongue hanging out, panting hard from what Cas presumes has been a game of outrunning a staff member for God knows how long.

He even takes Castiel’s now empty plate without a comment, only speaking again as he sinks down on the couch in the same spot he was before. “Feeling better?”
Mr. Winchester’s breathing is equally as hard as his, maybe even quicker judging by the full ten inhales it takes to make them stutter on this high-speed pursuit before slowing down. “Go take a shower. The guest bathroom is up the stairs, second door on your left. I’ll have my doctor check on you first thing in the morning but right now you need to rest.”
which in turn makes him feel like a scolded child but again, it doesn’t seem bad natured, it actually almost felt lovingly. How in the hell is this woman working for Mr. Winchester? All of the staff Castiel had met were bodyguards packing guns, not 5ft5 Spanish women sporting neat outfits and packing nothing but bobby pins in a tight hairdo.
“Yeah. Yeah, that was him.” Castiel says as lightly as he can. “He’s actually on his way here, he’d love to meet you.” Lies, lies, all of it lies. God, what was he thinking? Was he really going to tell Gabe the truth? That not only would have put his own life in danger but Gabriel’s too and that was the last thing he wanted to happen. From now on, the lies will have to do.
His task is plain and simple. “Only what’s on the note, Mr. Novak.” He nods.
* Chapter 07 : What he wrote - L. Marling
“Thank you.
“Two.”
“Oh, uh- please, Castiel is just fine.”
He’s suffocating, the world spinning and burning him alive, pulling, twisting, ripping at every inch of his existence as the chemicals inside of him are causing irreversible damage, no chance of stopping. The thin, clear vomit making itself out in a last attempt at saving him does nothing but run down his chin and leave his body shaking uncontrollably where it spirals into violent spasms.
Anna chats him up while making the standard cups of coffee for Cas and Dean. She asks him about his trip, about the places he’s visited in particular, and throws in some compliments about Cas’s tan but no comments are made about the bags under his eyes, nor about the weight loss. She simply quietly pushes a donut in his direction. “On the house.”
There’s a fresh set of scorching tears ready to spill just thinking about how utterly stupid the man had made him feel and how his chest still ached every time he remembered yet another humiliating comment or insult Mr. Winchester had cursed him with over the past two weeks.
God, the British accent alone is doing a spectacular job at making an already pissed off Dean nearly forget about the hundreds of reporters still surrounding them and starting a gang war right then and there. Though, he kind of already had, hasn’t he?

One contract, now adorned by his signature, was indeed meant to resemble a marriage contract, binding them together in a hateful act of rivalry masked by a pretentious act of love. This was the base of it all for it held the financial end of the entanglement, so long as Castiel followed the rules, it would protect him against any money related issues he might encounter.

And just like that, Mr. Winchester up and leaves the room, leaves Cas wondering what in the hell just happened. What was up with the mild temper today? First there’s Dean declaring ‘I need you’, then there’s the understanding gestures and the seemingly nurturing attention. Now a man who’s been spoiled by servants all his life runs off to get food at the slightest hint of hunger?
But there had been nothing but radio silence ever since. Dean turned into his distant self and became the man Castiel met a few months ago; Mr. Winchester, CEO and straight up dick.
Castiel gathers up his stuff and makes sure to grab the monstrosity of a pink smoothie before staggering through the avenue’s busy traffic. Surprisingly, he makes it to the other side of the four lanes in one piece, just in time to see the CEO bolt out of the glass doors.
“I grew up poor,” Paula continues softly, “in a favela. Guns, killing, violence, I know all. But lot of the time, they’re scared little men, they want to look mean and they protect family. Dean- Dean is different. So angry all the time, but once? Sweet kid.”

The car’s rumble could have lulled him to sleep but they arrive before he can truly drift off, the driver already wishing him a good night and closing the door behind him when Cas’ mind is still as foggy as it had been all afternoon, barely mumbling out a response in time.

Castiel wishes to believe the second version of that theory.
“Aren’t you going to suck my cock or something?”
It’s perfectly clear Castiel can barely inhale due to the fear gripping at his chest when Mr. Winchester comes to a stand still only inches away from his slightly trembling shoulders, which is exactly why the millionaire stays there, breathing down his neck.
But this time, Benny doesn’t answer him. The man simply moves forward, his gun still at ready though no longer raised as he goes through every room to double check their safety which leaves Cas alone with the one dude he really didn’t want to see right now.
All he can do is stand there and wait, at least he’s not being yelled at so, it’s not like he cares. Cas just takes his time to let his eyes wander around the big office space. The lack of glass walls like in the conference rooms actually gives it a slightly warmer feeling, especially with the morning sun reflecting off the variety of shiny objects placed all around. From silver stationery, to polished awards and chrome details decorating the wooden desk and matching cabinets.
“You fucker!” He screams at the phone, then sobs, immediately crumbling into a shattered mess because the one pillar that’d kept him standing had mercilessly been destroyed with a single blow directly to its weakest point.

“Okay,” she nods, “I was just worried.” Her answer sounds as if she’s not entirely convinced, probably wanting to know more about why exactly there was an entire ruckus out in the street. Pray to God she didn’t see the guns. But the lady does seem to know her place; turning away slightly and seconds from going back home, until she sees Castiel’s face clearly.
He goes with “Muay Thai, combat sport”, and leaves out the part where he can still feel Mr. Winchester’s boots from where they made contact with his ribs. Purple strokes might have turned into soft yellow clouds, the memories still remain a dark red.

, did it hurt.
With his fists.
But it’s not fine. Mr. Ketch marches his ass across the penthouse in a split second and punches Castiel so hard he has to drag a weak body up to its feet himself before being able to pull it to the nearest bedroom where he wastes no time in moving things along.
* Chapter 11 : Calm after the storm - Common Linnets
Castiel suddenly wonders. Now that he thinks about it, she’s always around, even before the crack of dawn and still there when he aimlessly wanders through the endless corridors in the middle of the night.
* Chapter 02 : Broken bones - Kaleo
Dean can never know about the true nature of the police’s visit. Not now, not ever, so Castiel walks back to his old house, pulls the front-door shut and then makes his way over to the driveway again to face what has to be done. “Neighbors got concerned be-“
It’s a question he’s asked himself at least half a dozen times since being brought to the mansion. One he’s stashed at the back of his head because he doesn’t need to think far to know the answer. Even without any verbal agreements, he knows there’s an unspoken rule keeping him on Mr. Winchester’s property at all times. No way was Dean going to agree to dinner with Gabriel.
“For the coming four days, I will pay you a visit daily to attend to your wounds and follow up on your condition to ensure optimal healing. After that, I will come by once every other day until it can be concluded further care is no longer needed.”
His entire body is throbbing and shaking by the time blood gets mixed with cum though Mr. Ketch can’t seem to care, he just forcefully grabs Cas’s shoulder and turns him around, ready to kick his fifteen minutes of pleasure out of the bed when he sees it.
"He's got blood cold as ice and a heart made of stone."
Fingertips still burn heavy on his skin when he gets himself to move again, Dean’s perfume following him around like a constant reminder of their antics the previous night and it makes his eyes water.
Mr. Winchester isn’t there.
“Take me home.” Dean snarls. “Take me home! Now!” That finally makes his bodyguards and driver scramble to their assigned positions, away from the scene they’d just witnessed.
It’s not long before Gabriel is engaged with a new group of admirers, though Castiel doesn’t mind the breathing space and now that he thinks about it, he could really use a drink. Here’s on hoping Mr. Winchester at least thought of some decent array of non-alcoholic beverages.
* Chapter 02 : Broken bones - Kaleo
It’s not the insults that make him cry, he’s learned to take those with a grain of salt anyway, nor is it the painful grip on his arm, but rather fading adrenaline mixed with a rush of realization that this is his life now. Months of being away from home and not a single neighbor actually checked up on him.

“Why didn’t you call?”
Mr. Winchester found that to be the most stupid comparison possible the first time he’d heard it. He never considered himself the

The woman introduces herself as Melissa while she’s already guiding him towards a massage table, her arm behind his back but not touching him, she even waits for Cas to make the first move in removing his bathrobe before she calmly extends her hands to take it from him and neatly hang the silk to avoid crinkling it.
Even as he makes his way through the immense building that is Winchester International Co., he can still feel how his legs complain with every little step he takes but he’s got to smile through it. And the reason behind that is how he suddenly gets noticed by people. Employees beam at him now, nodding politely as he passes them. Some even blush a little bit. Before this
However, the one, major difference Castiel clung to for dear life was not what either dominant party did to him while under their control, but rather what’s to happen

In all honesty, he couldn’t care less, couldn’t even care if he tried because the mix of alcohol and drugs is really starting to take a toll on his general functioning and he’s pretty sure the way he’s barely still standing is not because of his skinny, teenage body figuring itself out.
quiet but Castiel can clearly hear commotion as he makes his way down the cold marbled stairs, instantly sending another bout of anxiety through his already suffering body at the possibility of having to face actual humans today.
“Just a second, sweetie.” He says while once again cutting someone off in the middle of their sentence. “What are you still doing here, Mr. Novak? If you want an autograph you’ll have to wait in line like everyone else, you’re not special. Besides, don’t you have something better to do?”

’d be the ones in that famous conference room, wishing to belong to the intimate circle of Mr. Winchester’s most valued people who get first glimpses at the genius behind the man in close proximity. Up and personal.
“What are you-“
“I just wanted to have a nice evening together,” Dean says, broken, “why’d you have to ruin it?”
Despite getting clean, Castiel enrolled into Law school and went to live on his own. He graduated, started working some jobs, ended up at Wesson Law & Legal, and the rest is history.
* Chapter 03 : Monsters - Ruelle (acoust.)
‘Frustrating’ didn’t even begin to cover it. Just when he thought he finally got some insight into Dean Winchester’s life, into what makes the man tick, it only lead him into more confusion than where he’d started and it began to have a noticeable impact on him.
But before Mr. Winchester can even brew up another snarky remark, Castiel’s stomach decides it’s all been too overwhelming and caves as it spills its meagre contents of nothing but bile and water over the expensive Italian marble, unforgivingly so.
Dean Winchester was a God.
Castiel thinks as a confused, desperate frown forms above his eyes gone wide. “No, sir, you- last night-“
There’s a drawn out silence between them after that, the room filled with nothing but a heavy,
Seeing as none of the men around him seem open for some heart-to-heart talks or friendly chatter, Castiel has to settle on the next best thing to acquire at least some information about what’s going on. As he lets his attention wander around the room, he makes sure to not make direct eye contact with any of them, much like one would avoid doing with a wild animal because, he isn’t entirely convinced these people wouldn’t

She slightly jumps at hearing her name being called, clearly lost in thought but quick to dive right back into her whirlwind of a personality and hastily leaving the room after a smile and wink, perhaps off to finish dealing with Teddy.
“And you must be Gabriel!” he continues without skipping a beat, already shaking hands. “It is so nice to finally meet you, Castiel’s told me a lot about you.”
Business-business, not ‘running-gangs-and-murdering-people’ business. So Dean smiles.
“I just thought-“
That’s what it is; a luxury. It’s a luxury to kill and not care, to kill and get away with it. At least for Mr. Winchester because you see, Castiel isn’t in Greece. He never was. He’s locked in some house in downtown New York where Dean’s guards stand plentiful day and night, though further not paying him any attention. All they care about is keeping Cas away from the public to avoid anyone seeing him like this and to prevent him from alerting authorities.
“Shit, Cas- I’m sorry. I shouldn’t- I shouldn’t have said that.”
They now walked away with mere cuts and fractures, the bruises left for their egos.
* Chapter 03 : Monsters - Ruelle (acoust.)
He noticeably flinches when impatient hands snatch the shirt from his grasp before it’s shoved back against his chest, punching the air out of him on impact. “Put. It. On.” Lifting his chin in a false display of confidence, Castiel nods but stands his ground when Mr. Winchester doesn’t move to give him some space. At least, not at first, because just after a few seconds of a silent battle for unspoken dominance, the man takes a step away from the wall and scoffs in response.
“No, no. I’m sure. Pick me up at six, I’ll be at the end of the driveway.”
“Just get some rest, okay? You’ve got a pretty nasty infection going and you owe me an explanation about those weird burns on your chest but that can wait. Sleep, Cassie.”
“What? That you’d give it to me?”
But Castiel clocks out somewhere in the middle of Gabriel’s rally about climate and how scandalous it is that big name brands get away with their dirt on the streets. Once upon a time this topic would have interested Cas and he would have jumped on the occasion to politely debate about it with someone, though right now he’s got bigger problems on his mind.
At least being Mr. Winchester’s “assistant” over the past few weeks has taught him a few things, one he never could have dreamt about coming in handy, but here we are. Castiel quickly learned that Dean checks his gun approximately once every two hours, almost like clockwork.
Well, not entirely because apart from the so called ‘contract' they signed, no legal marriage had been conducted, nor will there ever be. Tonight will simply be a grandiose party, mostly to be enjoyed by their guests (and the media), rather than it being anything with actual meaning to them.
* Chapter 03 : Monsters - Ruelle (acoust.)
Castiel is in absolute agony for the fifteen minutes that follow. It’s not half as bad as when he had the wounds pinned down against a mattress while a stranger fucked into him but it’s no walk in the park either. Between gloved fingers inspecting the healing blisters, swabs drenched in disinfectant and new wound dressings being applied, Cas has to grit his teeth near the point of breaking them.
“We have to leave, now.”
Wow, that came out so much more needy and desperate than Cas was intending it to, so he brings his eyes up quickly in a nervous reflex of at least trying to anticipate Dean’s possible response. What he finds is a look of uncertainty and hesitance.
’ Cas thinks playfully when spotting the CEO in the crowd. But something’s wrong. Something’s seriously wrong. It looks as if Dean had been looking for him, because when their eyes lock, the man quickly walks across the room, running would draw too much attention.
. One agitated sigh later, Castiel accepts defeat, leaving the premise behind but of course not before giving the man twice his size a

Castiel just shrugs. What was the question again?
As he looks around, his mind automatically trying to piece two and two together, he’s glad to see he doesn’t seem restrained in any way nor is he sharing the space with any guards, mafia bosses or other patients for that matter. In a split moment of what he assumes is a painkiller infused daze, Castiel does wonder where Mr. Winchester is, if the man is even there.
“I said I want drugs!” Castiel now sobs. “Congratulations, you’ve officially broken me.”
* Chapter 20 : Light up - Isak Danielson
“You,” Mr. Winchester growls, “this is all your fault. Do you even know what you have done?! We’re at war, you hear me? And all because you couldn’t keep your damn legs shut! You’re a fucking whore and you’re going to pay for it!”
“Name your price.” He simply states again.
“Shit, you must be hungry. I’m sorry.”
Out of all the things he’s had to face before, why was this the hardest one yet? Why did he let a previously invaluable opponent knock him down after a round only lasting sixteen days? Perhaps it was because Mr. Winchester’s final punch thrown had been the one to say ‘Now stay down’?
* Chapter 21 : Corbeau blanc - Julien Doré
It’s nearly eight-thirty when he makes it back, yet the CEO still isn’t anywhere to be seen and Cas starts wondering if Dean will show up at all today. He just hopes that if the man does, it will be soon because feeling how noticeably the cup in his hand is cooling down already gives him that jittery kind of anxiety. Handing over cold coffee would be worse than if he’d simply be late with the order, thus making his plan entirely backfire.
The faces might not be familiar, the whole setting on the other hand is. Everything from the sulky feeling inseparable from sad grey walls, to the hammering in his chest as he stands there, looking a truth in the eye he’d much rather not face. But he has no choice.
* Chapter 05 : Satisfied - Reignwolf
Dean Winchester was more than able to ensure Castiel Novak would never find a decent job again, more than powerful enough to make Castiel go bankrupt and drowning in debt till the end of his days, and especially: more than loved enough to get out of this with barely a scratch while Castiel lay bleeding out in the street.
. Sam’s hateful stares saying more than enough and being plentifully accusatory. So much so that it actually made Castiel feel slightly bad about what he’d done. Not only did he possibly ruin his own career, he dragged Mr. Wesson down with him and that had been a low blow, even for him.
. Unfortunately, his legs have other plans. They’re almost incapable of keeping him upright at this point with the negligence slowly but steadily taking over, let alone carry him anywhere.
But Dean shushes him. After the ride home, each in their own car, the two of them had significantly calmed down. Maybe the hug had helped, too. The hug that'd gone on for just a little longer than strictly necessary. After all, Castiel had made it clear the woman was gone so there had been no reason for them to stay intertwined and pretend they’re a happy couple. Yet Dean had kept Cas right there against him as their breaths fell into a rhythm not defined by time.
“It’s been a while, huh?” the woman smiles. Nine years to be exact. Yet Cas had still instantly recognized her. After all, you don’t easily forget someone you shared such intimacy with. “Yeah,” he stutters, “what- what are you doing here?”
“What’s wrong with you?” The harsh words startle him more than he’d care to admit but the way he’s unable to answer the question must give him away. The woman now notices him for the first time since she’d walked in and just like the initial time they met, she’s exactly as embarrassed by the moves she made on Castiel’s ‘husband’. “Anyway,” Mr. Winchester continues, slightly agitated, “this here is my new assistant. She's just so…
His heart feels like it’s about to stop, or maybe it has already, he can’t really feel it anymore. She’s getting too close. Too involved. Does she knows something he doesn’t?

“What do you mean, ‘that’s not the issue’? Is there something else?”
in the weeks that followed. Castiel got a few more days off from work, at Mr. Winchester’s house that is, no longer in New York and therefore: no longer in hiding. There had never been a greater urgency to sober up than there had been following their dispute. Yet, this time around, Castiel hadn’t even touched any drugs. This was a different kind of intoxicated.
* Chapter 06 : Horns - Bryce Fox
“I- I feel sick.”
“Darling, would you mind giving us a minute? My buttercup over there had a rough day yesterday.” She audibly coos at that, falling right into Dean’s lies and leaving the office none the wiser on
The whole room laughed as he was casually harassed by sexually inappropriate comments.
“Yeah,” the guy sighs, an awkward smile between them, “at least there’s free booze.”
* Chapter 17 : You can run - Adam Jones
Yet, every past instance he can recall, Castiel knows with an unmistakable clarity he always defied the odds and kept pushing past his breaking point. When the crowds would start murmuring, whispering he won’t make it as they stared down at his bloodied and quitting body Castiel would get up, wipe the crimson from his face and get ready to fight again.
Both the duvet and Castiel’s button up are not only wet but also stained with dark patches of red. “What in the hell did you do?” Ketch barks as he rips the shirt open. Underneath is a sight that makes him back away instantly. Castiel’s unattended burns have deteriorated to his chest being blistered and wounds now dripping fluids and blood onto his torso down the agitated, affected skin.
He’s also noticed some other changes. Such as the
Yet again, Castiel’s thoughts are pulled back towards that one conversation he had with his brother all those nights ago. It feels like an eternity since they made these plans while in reality it hadn’t even been a full week.
For a lack of a better answer and for being completely dumbfounded, Mr. Winchester actually asks “what kind of drugs?”, perhaps hoping he understood it all wrong. But when the man before him begs ‘just get me anything, please!’, Dean knows he messed up. For real this time.
Dean pulls him closer right before the valets can close the doors behind them and turns towards the crowd one last time as he brings Castiel in for a deep kiss for everyone to see. The screams go absolutely wild. Yeah, those pictures will be on the front cover tomorrow.

The material feels nice between his fingers, so much so that he can’t seem to stop slowly running his thumb over where it’s clutched in his hands, though he doesn't manage to actually move beyond the stroking. He just stands there, frozen, intense eyes glued to his skin and he doesn’t even need to look up to see them, their ferocity providing all the uneasiness needed.
, he’s in pain and just completely emotionally drained so he can’t even voice what he wants, doesn’t exactly know what that is either. What he does know is that he doesn’t have the energy left to deal with this and he’s sure tears will fall if these stupid, hard-headed bodyguards keep denying him passage as if they’re his babysitters.
“That’s what happens, Mr. Winchester,” Ketch had said to him days before their deal, “that’s what happens when you decide to share your throne; you’re no longer the sole leader and that makes you
It doesn’t take Castiel long to find Donna because her cheery voice greeted him as soon as he walked through the door, leading him straight to her. The place carries a cozy atmosphere with cops -both retired and those still on the corps- catching up and undoubtedly reminiscing about calls they went on together, though none are in uniform.

Reading words such as ‘addict’ and ‘drug abuse’ bring back a flood of memories he thought he’d stacked away somewhere deep, deep down with every intention of never having to remember them. Struggling with addiction was one thing but constantly having to hear how people apparently thought the worst thing about it was the impact on his father’s company brought along a feeling of shame and hurt so intense it instantly made his chest collapse being reminded of it.

“No,” Mr. Winchester says in the softest voice Castiel has ever heard from the man, “I didn’t do this, sweetheart. Are you going to tell me what happened?”
* Chapter 09 : Miracle - The Score
Besides, he feels very fucking close to passing out. It’s not rocket science that Mr. Winchester pulled him out of the hospital wat too soon but Castiel still hasn’t figured out what exactly drove the man to do so, let alone why he showed up in the first place. Whatever game that man was playing, Castiel was losing.
He’s distantly happy this isn’t an all-nude experience and that she let him keep his boxers on, not only due to the fact Dean would probably kill anyone touching Cas without him knowing about it, but also because he’s fairly certain there’s still some handprints carved into the flesh of his ass and he’s just not ready to face those truths yet.
“Do you have to leave?”
“Yeah, no, I’m sorry, Gabe. It’s all really overwhelming, you know?.
To say it makes Cas extremely uncomfortable is a huge understatement. He knows he accidentally got caught up in something he rather would’ve averted and though the normal reflex in similar scenarios is to turn your back and run, the gaze currently sticking to his skin his holding him captive, silently claiming him.
too thick, it must be, for it’s not making its way into his lungs and Castiel can’t do anything but suffocate as what he’d fought so hard for to disappear is now staring him in the face without a single shred of remorse.
“No! No, just stop! I don’t…”
The view from up there is quite breath taking. But what draws him in after staring at the displayed diplomas for way too long, are the double doors on both the left and right flank of the office. They lead to connected rooms, that much he knows, but he doesn’t know
But when he swipes across the screen and presses his ear to it, eyes still closed in half-slumber, he’s met with a sharp exhale of breath that almost sounds like an amused huff, followed by a “rise and shine, pumpkin!”

* Chapter 01: Not afraid - Tommee Profitt
As soon as the doors close behind them, Mr. Winchester breaks down in the much-anticipated but therefor not less frightening tirade. He starts yelling about how stupid it was of Cas to go out with a fever, how angry he is that his direct orders were ignored, how disappointed he is.
Castiel doesn’t know how to feel, or what to think. He somehow senses pity for Mr. Winchester because, though it sounds logical, it had never occurred to him that even this man must have been an innocent child at one time. Which brings him to a different dilemma; clearly, Dean is no longer that child. What happened between that point and taking his first life? Between taking his first life and becoming the cruel person he is today?
exactly Castiel just had a night filled with nothing but nightmares from his past all thanks to one strategic gash straight across his still healing heart.
“Congratulations on the factory, Mr. Winchester.”
One of them, the same man who’d dragged him out of his car before, pushes him down on one of three chairs in the dark space without speaking a single word to him, neither of them do, not even when he starts asking questions and demanding answers.
They don’t let Castiel through at first. He’s pushed behind a cop instead and all men involved have got their guns up in defense already. All but one. “Woah, woah, woah,” the guy barks, “do you know who I am?”
“No! No, I- never mind. I’ll just toss it in the trash.”
Only adding to his increasing insanity is Dean completely ignoring him, acting as if he doesn’t even exist. The man darts in and out of the office, answers phone calls, types up e-mails, takes the occasional sip of cucumber water (yes, really). However, not a single word has been said to Castiel since that morning. Mr. Winchester gives him not a single look, either.
The man’s voice was naturally deep but holy hell, when he got angry or impatient it dropped impossibly lower, shutting Castiel up and even slightly intimidating him as that thunderous growl mixed in with the already authoritative tone just snarls at his vulnerable throat.

Castiel notices, he can see her eyes shift over his body but she’s turned around and averted her gaze again in a split second, now rummaging through the large bag she brought with her. “I’m sorry to ask, but I’d like to select the best products for your, sir. How long ago did that injury occur?”
“Thank you, Mr. Winchester! See you soon.” Once hands have been shaken and expensive cars have departed, the older man makes his way back over to Castiel, blissfully unaware of what’s going on as he very politely asks which type of card the payment shall be made with.

Cas wants to stop the hands running down his chest but his voice fails him, and so does his body. It reacts to the touches it’s getting in ways he can’t control and besides, Dean already seems lost in it, the liquor mixed with perfume suggesting there’s not just pent up sexual frustration at play here but the evening’s excitement as well.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Before any further questions can be asked, Dean pulls out a shiny ring, holding it out towards Mr. Novak without an explanation. “We’re married now, remember?” Not in a thousand years did he expect the CEO of Asshole International to actually make that part of the deal go beyond what was drawn up in the contract but here he was, holding a ring that once again probably costs more than Cas's house, even if it looks second-hand.
Simply hearing that name makes him close his eyes on instinct as a heavy feeling settles in his distantly throbbing chest, he also mentally curses himself for apparently doing a piss poor job at hiding the entire shit storm that is his life.

Dean’s fist against the side of his face hits so hard and so unexpectedly he stumbles right down, heart racing as he looks up at the man who does nothing but grimace at him. “On the floor, that’s your place.” And without further ado, a plate of meat and vegetables is placed in front of him. “Eat.”
“I’m sorry, I’m.. I don’t know.”

“Yeah.” Dean nods once, then looks to have decided. He walks forward, closing the distance between them until he can straighten up Cas’ t-shirt before looking up into his eyes, then back down, right at his lips. The innuendo alone confirms something; it hadn’t been a dream.
“Exactly. We’ve been there before.” Castiel cuts him off, perhaps just a tad bit too defensive. “Sorry, it’s just, with our father and all… we grew up with paparazzi in our faces so that’s not the issue.”
Cas might be a well-educated man who possesses plenty of knowledge on legal matters but on medical expertise he does not. So after finally figuring out how to screw the main line loose from the I.V. in his hand, Cas is left scrambling when the now open circuit starts dripping meds all over the floor and bed before he even has a chance of finding how to stop it all.
He studies the gun. It’s heavy, not only due to the stainless steel resting in his hands, but also with one of world’s hardest questions weighing it down, getting more difficult to carry with every new intake of breath.
to take him to one, though? Albeit, they do appear to be alone in the room and even the sinister, sterile environment feels welcomingly comforting despite it all so he relaxes into the bed a bit further, staring at Gabriel’s gentle smile.
Unsurprisingly, Mr. Winchester takes his sweet time to make his way over to the entrance hall once more, enjoying the sight of a terrified man in his house for just a while longer. “Alright, Teddy. Playtime’s over. Go in your room!” When Dean finally manages to drag the dog away, Cas can weakly inhale again even though his throat was already closing up a bit.
“Oh, uh. I’m- I’m fine” he stutters, “I promise you, I’m okay.”

He’d never felt as objectified before as under Mr. Winchester’s gaze when stepping out of that dressing room. Those eyes were on him like a predator’s, gauging every unsteady exhale and volatile twitch, deciding whether or not this loot was worth any of his further time.
Coming home should feel like a relief, he knows that, yet when he pushes the front door closed behind him all he can think of is how numb and worn out he is despite of the relatively okay sleep he’d gotten the night before. Denying it is pointless though because the sensations are far too familiar, having felt them in his early twenties for the last time doesn’t take away from him immediately recognizing them as the dull, dark pull of a swelling depression and no matter how much it should make alarms go off, Castiel is exceptionally tranquil. Ultimately, the indifference felt more like coming home than stepping into his own house had done.

Castiel wishes he didn’t, but he does know, he understands how keeping Mr. Winchester out of the wrong spotlights is a responsibility they both share because if Dean is going down, probably so is he.
“And there it is.”
There’s raised eyebrows waiting for Cas, telling him he’s too naïve for his own good.

“Hey, uh. Go get me my car, will you? I wanna take her for a spin after work.”
There’s a sharp inhale of breath, “what do you want?” Mr. Winchester asks again, gently.
…” and the strings become unraveled.
In court however, a strong character was needed in order to represent clients who have found themselves in a difficult predicament because how will you defend them if you can’t even defend yourself? But this was no time for confidence. He should have known better.

This isn’t even being sick anymore. This is dying, and that’s not an exaggeration. His body is failing, literally quitting on him, Cas knows that but the one thing more frightening than becoming aware of the fact you’re on the brink of death, is knowing and not being able to do anything about it.
Castiel can only nod. Over the past few weeks he’d gotten to see more and more of Dean’s gentler side. The abuse still remained of course, there were endless nights where Cas appeared to be the sole point of interest for the CEO’s anger, and then followed horrid days of disinterested stares and being ignored. But there had also been these…
Castiel hands over his Visa with trembling hands, heart already sinking before even daring to confront the numbers on that paper. What he reads surpasses even his wildest expectations. One meal came down to a figure that exceeded half of his monthly income.
“No, no. What’s up?”
What the hell was wrong with him? He should be happy, celebrating, for Castiel finally seemed to back down and roll over. For good this time around. This is what he had wanted all along. Yet, in a moment overcome by emotions so distant to him that they’d almost become estranged, Mr. Winchester feels too exhausted and defeated to even begin reveling in his victory.

He wasn’t complaining, though. It offered him protection. For now.

He has to take a minute to actually process what Gabriel had been throwing at his head just a few seconds ago before carefully constructing answers that will sound composed enough to not give himself away. Easier said than done when you don’t even
Castiel thinks.
“Cassie, we could reschedule. It’s really no trouble, we could-“

Of course, Dean had then traded off Castiel without a second thought, because deep down, he’d known Ketch was right. The only thing that finally made him decide between killing the snob of the Brits or the princess of the Americans was hands being laid where only his belonged.
“You know,” whispers Dean, hands sliding down Castiel’s ribs, “you’re actually pretty attractive” he confesses as undaunted fingers travel further down until they’re gliding over smooth, soft curves, turning demanding once they’ve snatched their price. They squeeze hard, dig into flesh with every intention to hurt, to own. “

Dean nearly snaps at the young gentleman in his office, ready to yell something like “that’s none of your fucking business, who the hell do you think you are?!” but as he looks up, he’s met with a friendly smile, not the cold-blooded grin he was expecting.

Cas nervously turns around and
“Meaning?”
“Why did you do that to me, huh?” Mr. Winchester spits. “You made me look bad. Is that what you want? For people to think I’m a bad husband? Is that what you want?!” He yells as he shakes Cas violently, then lets go again without a warning, ignoring the dull thud of bone against wood.
* Chapter 06 : Horns - Bryce Fox
Both of them come to a halt when finally noticing Castiel. The poor woman looks as if she’s about to pass out from shame, cheeks reddening and eyes wide with shock. “Mr. Novak!” She chokes out before letting out a string of incoherent words only vaguely sounding like apologies. But Mr. Winchester is there to save the day. Ever the gentleman, is he not?

One on each side.
“Poor, little Cassius, addicted to smack and crack. Probably not something you wanted to be reminded off, if you’d managed to forget at all. But you know what they say: once an addict, always an addict.”
Two hours of being treated like royalty had left him feeling a whole lot better than he did this morning, not even Dean giving him an unimpressed look upon descending the stairs had affected him.
“Oh, uh, busy, with the- the factory. Opening’s next week so…”
“I know!” He glances around nervously before turning back towards his brother and continuing in an equally hushed tone. “Money’s not the reason, Gabe. I was more than happy at Wesson.”

“Fucking hell, Novak! What happened to all your ‘holier than thou’ bullshit, huh?! Or did you forget that is exactly what got you in this situation? Even the first time we met, you started a public bitch fit because you couldn’t stand my ‘environment destroying factory’ messing with your unrealistic utopia of a world where every tree is saved and we all act like fucking fairies or some shit!”

He shrugs it off, has to, and goes on to pretend he doesn’t notice how his hands tremble when they pick up the gold-rimmed porcelain mug, even the coffee inside moves around in controlled splashes. At least all the liquid does now is stain his skin, no longer burning it.
There’s a sharp intake of breath on the other side, silencing the thunder between them but Cas doesn’t dare speak. He can only image what must have gone through Gabriel’s head in the past twenty four hours and it isn’t pretty. He hurt Gabriel and despite anticipating what’s to come, the words still hit Castiel. Hard.
Gabriel sighs, realizing how wrong he’s been in flipping out like that, he even chuckles softly and it instantly makes Castiel relax. He, too, coming down from his high. “Can you forgive me, Cas? I was worried, is all.”
Cas finally goes to the bathroom, breaks down crying, waits till he’s presentable once more, walks all the way back to Winchester International, breaks down in the glossy elevator again.
Mr. Novak now looks at him: with wonder. Some might call it confidence perhaps. Head held high, features nice and composed, body not slacking but not rigid anymore either. It’s a change Dean appreciates for it seems that scared little boy he snatched from the streets is finally fulfilling the role he’d set out for it.
With the insane rollercoaster that had been the past twelve hours, Castiel completely forgot about that, though, it’s a rather pleasant reminder he’ll at least get actual medical care after being snatched from the safety of his hospital room all too quickly.
It’s the same hotel where Dean and Cas had their falling out, the argument and then the scandal that ultimately led to anything happening afterwards so it brings forth a strange set of sensations. To any outsider, choosing the place where your ‘relationship’ started as your reception venue might seem sweet, romantic in that stomach turning way. But to Castiel, it’s a slap in the face.
But he didn’t mind. Not until now, that is.

“A contract, you know, between those into some hardcore sex involving whips and chains and secret dungeons.”
“So what now?” he ends up asking.
“Why would you not have ‘traded me off’ to that Brit if I had told you about the stupid burns? What possible reason could you give me that wouldn’t make you sound like the complete lunatic you are?!”
“Fine weather today huh, sir?” they moan, or “how’s married life treating you?” they ask, giggling like teenage girls as they sip on yet another cup of never ending, overpriced office coffee.

Actually, no. People in a place like this are the kind of owners who have designer pooches who in turn wear Versace clothes and walk their paws around town in Gucci shoes. So, yeah, he was worse off than these millionaire’s Goldendoodles and Yorkipoos.
“Sweetheart-“
When he hears the tell tale whistles, followed by Ted’s bedroom door being locked, he knows Mr. Winchester has gotten the dog inside and is settling for an easy evening, too. It isn’t much longer after that the CEO returns. Mr. Winchester has gotten rid off his jacket and tie, blouse slightly unbuttoned and Ralph Lauren socks quietly manoeuvring over the shiny hardwood floors.
It probably is.
. Aren’t you, baby?”

His cries are enough to have a guard rush into the room, hand on her holster. “Sir?” she asks, alert, “everything alright?” Castiel is too dumbfounded to see a female in such a position of power within the Winchester household that he completely forgets to answer her question. Only when the dog pushes up against him to get his attention again and beg for food, does Castiel let out a surprised yelp, followed by him desperately trying to chase it away.
So why exactly was Dean Winchester turning out to be an apparent undefeatable opponent? How come it’s possible years of addiction seemed more manageable to conquer than the past two weeks and fifty to come? The answer wasn’t a simple one, but therefor not less true.
“Paula?”
“Do you want something to eat?”

issue.”
“Sir, please. You’re obviously upset. Is there something I can do?”
It’s the truth. Gabriel isn’t childish, that’s not what Cas would call it but normally, his brother is always joking and laughing, it’s the guy’s way of handling things, but whenever the conversation turns more serious between them, that very laughter disappears.

“What business is it of theirs?! They-”
Before Cas can throw another nasty look across the room -anxiety about the consequences no longer present- does Doctor Beaumont guide him towards one of the studies, for more privacy perhaps but, it’s only the three of them in the mansion and don’t think Dean is leaving Cas out of his sight, no matter what room the doctor takes him to.
Perhaps it is.
“So,” Dr. Beaumont continues, pulling out an impressive collection of medical equipment, “I was requested by Sir to aide in attending to some unfortunate burns. Correct?”
“It’s alright, Donna. I should have known-“

“Mr. Novak? This is Mr. Lafitte, I’m Mr. Winchester’s bodyguard.” Ah, yes, they’d met, a gun between them at the time. “He is expecting your presence. Be at the Four Season’s in twenty minutes.”
* Chapter 06 : Horns - Bryce Fox
Pondering didn’t do him much good. On the contrary. While his mind was racing, screaming hazy sentences at him, to the outside world –to Mr. Winchester- he was just being quiet. It could easily be mistaken for defiance, or in this case: ungratefulness.
“Sure. Let’s go!”
That voice has never sounded better to him.
, there he is, the one and only. It’s funny how out of place Mr. Winchester looks in a downtown restaurant like this one which serves food he probably wouldn’t even give his dog. Dean almost looks like a purebred Weimaraner roaming the streets: it doesn’t belong there.
“Are you saying I did that?! You have some fucking nerve, Novak!” Based on how Mr. Winchester turns around in anger, shaking his head and breathing hard with all the rage, Castiel is more than convinced he’s going to get a fist right in the jaw, if not worse. But when Dean faces him again, the man appears awfully calm, almost as if he flipped a switch. “I didn’t do that.” He says.
