John grunted as he adjusted to the new stretch, then shifted, rocking his hips. Sherlock crooked his finger just slightly and John shuddered, groaning out, “Yes! There, there, there.”
“What the hell?” In the moment before he turned and took in who stood behind him, he half expected Mrs. Hudson, who sometimes still brought him biscuits or scones, but she didn’t usually sneak up on him.
He laved John’s balls, sucking them each gently into his mouth before licking up his shaft and tonguing at the slit. John groaned as Sherlock finally took him into his mouth, working his body back and forth between impaling his throat with John’s cock and his arse with the crewman behind.
Sherlock was unceremoniously hoisted over a shoulder and a few moments later dropped onto his back across a soft bed, sideways, so his legs dangled. Sherlock grunted, eyes squeezed shut. He trembled slightly.
"Yes, I am aware of the science," said Sherlock sharply.
"But where did the onlies come from?" asked John glancing at Miri.
She picked up her flabbjellah. "I play the flabbjellah. Badly. You can learn a musical instrument and play badly with me. Your honor owes me that sacrifice."
Somewhere outside it, she knew that fierce cold winds blew across the landscape of home. Within was mild and warm. Flowers bloomed along the exterior of a building itself carved with a profusion of stone flowers.  "Don't dawdle," said the guard, but his tone was as mild as the air.
"Ah, revenge." Stonn spread his fingers in a Vulcan greeting. "Sh'Alaack, the Maquis sent me. I am your contact." Bihr's brief relief was countered by the thought that for the other her to be worth a resistance group sending an operative, there must be something they wanted from that other her.
She pulled her phaser as she slapped her com. "Sh'Alaack. Watson. Back to the shuttle." She only got static.
Mollyhoo followed John out of the chamber.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Gone, clearly," said the alpha straightening his sash. "Some crazy Maquis showed up here to save the terrorist Donovan brought in, and got a pet in the bargain. But isn't the city pound a little down market for the Prince's kennel master? I thought the palace only accepted alphas and omega certified eight-five percent or higher for breeding. Although," he sniffed, "You are just a jumped unaligned Inferior not even able to do that duty."
He must have done something terrible in a past life, because this was going to be hell.
Their lips brushed together. Softly at first. The omega slid their tongue inside his mouth. He did the same tasting the omega. Delicious. It made him long for more. Tongues swirling against each other. Mouths parting only to shift and find each other again. Breathe growing rapidly harsh. His heart pounding. The omega's hands already finding their way inside the silky robe to slide it wonderfully back over the skin of his upper chest. The omega pushed the robe back to let it fall to the ground.
Lucy sighed and nodded. "Are you…" she swallowed and said in a low voice, "pregnant?"
"How exactly did the future send you a message?" John spoke through his hand, trying to hold in his horror that he and Sherlock had left infants, their infants, any infant in a technological void. A wasteland. An era without antibiotics or replicators or even metal. After all those starts, the time they'd finished had been there and they'd left them.
Had been.
Billy nodded wearily and stepped out of the camera's angle of vision. He moved fast. Faster than John would have thought he could through the open door. They waited for a few moments, but the night-shift didn't notice anything amiss with the mass of blankets.
Moriarty sat down next to Sherlock's head. Sherlock let the silence stretch.

https://www.bartleby.com/357/60.html
He'd gone to swap out a nameless student in the 'Wicked Potion Master magics Philosopher's Stone' scenario for a simulation of Tadpole Phelps. If Sherlock agreed to take part in the scenario, he knew Sherlock would notice that one of the characters was now John's first fuck. Sherlock studied their scenarios backwards and forwards. He'd met Tadpole – admittedly as an adult with his consciousness uploaded into the body of an android.
"Mum knows that something happened back at the Academy." It seemed so long ago when he'd been so angry with Sherlock. So much had happened since then. "But, yeah, I haven't… they don't need to know."
Feelings made even worse by the fact that he'd missed John while he'd been away. Desperately. Had told himself John's absence was an opportunity to work on his experiments, but in the deepest rooms of himself, he knew he'd avoided their quarters because he hadn't wanted to sleep in their empty bed. Be in rooms that would be empty of everything but John's scent for weeks.
"Kids. No fighting," said John trying to focus. "It wasn't just me. I had help. Sally Donovan and um…" John could not remember Sh'Alaack's cover identity or… it had been a long day. "Bihr Sh'Alaack. The Andorian who held the tray. She slipped me the weapon."
"You should go with Chin. Maybe convince the Khans to convince the others. And you know, get to know Chin a little better." He shrugged. "It's not as if you're going away forever. I'll be fine here. Anyway," he pursed his lips, plotting, "I can try to help Grandfather understand not all Beta Humans are horrible. Tell him about all the really good species living in the Federation. He advises the Khans. Get him to think helping them is a good idea too."
Sherlock huffed and looked aggrieved. "Please, an idiotic conceit."
But if for Sherlock's birthday, Sherlock wanted to be a newly enslaved adolescent in ancient Rome, who after being worshiped into a life of sybaritic pleasure for the afternoon, saved the life of his powerful new master during the eruption of Pompeii, then so be it. It was Sherlock's birthday and it was always a nightmare for John to find him a present he wanted.
http://safebirthproject.com/multiple-births-basics/
Sarabeth shouted, "Some of the others have started to go into labor too."
"Was the prince who gave himself a promotion to Khan also a secret?" asked John as he checked a teenage Telarite's fever.
And didn't that just make her skin crawl. Wherever the fuck she was, it was a rabbit hole of fucked up.
"Indeed," said Sherlock, who looked back at the tablet. "Mycroft was the result of… Mummy being required to try a number of times the old fashioned way. I was given to understand that I was not any easier to make." His eyes were almost gold now as he looked down. "Now that you know, what do you intend to do?"
There was no reason for creepy fucking guards to be on the landing pad in the colony. No reason. They were supposed to be up in the guard area at the top of the dome. They certainly weren't supposed to be turning their backs on the smiling colonists. At any point, one of the cons could have grabbed a weapon.
Mummy said, "Chin asked me to travel with her on her next few errands for her parents. Perhaps go to meet her parents." The Khans. Mummy meant the Khans. "For the last year, we have had to be apart. Because she had to run her parents' errands."
She might have ended her forty year career teaching at the academy scouting for fresh – read young – talent as an adjunct agent, but she had done those things.
"That's right," said Papa Ishros. "Uzaveh and our ancestors blessed us when we boarded the Bakerstreet and so we had the four of you."
John had to pee.
The guards picked up the screaming alpha and his leg, and carried him away.
A long term role as Soo-Lin, an engineer, was one thing. All she'd been was herself with a different name and a slightly altered appearance. She had her true name and face back, but for all she'd chaffed for more responsibility before she'd left, now she wanted nothing more than to have time to think in a lab.
"Magic cock!" insisted John.
Donovan said, "I should stay." Her lips quirked. Human expressions as always difficult to read. "Seems like I have a place as a pet catcher, better than all three of us on the run." Bihr was about to protest that they shouldn't lose contact, when Donovan tapped her com, which Bihr had forgotten. Donovan tossed the phaser to Watson. "You should stun me. Better for my cover."
John stood up. The stool falling over and he didn't care. "I flirted right in front of you."
Sherlock wanted no funeral for cells. For his failure. His body an enemy to his own desire.
Finally Sherlock slid him back down to the ground. Bodies still pressing against each other. "You kept them. You wanted to keep them."
Gremel said, "Thought I saw some folk snooping around on the cameras, and look what I found. The Breen representative, who shoulda oughta left with her tin can friends, and some tool in it with her." Gremel was sweating.
That this was not goodbye.
Sherlock stepped back, suddenly aware that he was wearing a silk himation, open on one side, and very little else.
Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust.
John did not like using kids. He did not like sending them into danger, but they weren't exactly safe as hostages either. If it had been himself, he'd have gone in the middle of the night, but since they were talking kids, they had to settle for middle of the day.
A young omega, hardly out of his teens, darted forward. "Mollyhoo, you're alive. You took a lot longer than usual."
She puttered around until Killander was done with his current cup of tea. She'd had the tea set for years. He might break one of the cups and she was ever so fond of the set.
Sally tried again. Coming around to face Hudson. "You should remove yourself from duty right the fuck now for the good of the crew. You don't have the…" which since Sally wasn't actually a doctor she couldn't remember what the medical terms that the guidance counselor had fed her a literal fucking hundred years ago, so she shifted that sentence. "Your brain is still forming. Quick what am I thinking?"
Sherlock arched an eyebrow angrily. About the only thing he could do given his current state."
"Until I came here," said Mollhoo softly, "My crèche always kept me away from alphas, because of," she waved at her nose, "the genetic defect that was the reason Sarpeidon chose to send me here. But we weren't religious enough to have me go through the process to eliminate my heats." She sighed.
She slipped past him. "We're in a bit of a sticky situation. Nothing we cannot reason our way out of, but a wicket that is sticky never the less." Confusion radiated out of him and she had one of those moments where she missed the easy communication of her people. The rapid wordless exchange of concepts and ideas.
It would have been better if he'd lost consciousness then. But a sensation not unlike being turned inside out and having his skin peeled off washed over him.
memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Bread_and_Circuses_(episode)
While Bihr's first thought had been to blame Fisher. She said hurriedly, "I believe that the ion storm sent us to a parallel reality." It was a simple conclusion. Cases of individuals unfortunate enough to transport at the same time as their parallels during an ion storm were well documented and the was reason for Starfleet's transporter configuration protocols.
Somewhat Doylistically, they know how to work a computer. But it is purely Forcythian that they won't have forgotten what lube is, which because they have been awake five seconds...
He found her deep in the left Nacelle working on a recalibration. She looked up at his approach. "Commander Holmes, is there something I can do for you?"
Nothing but a biologically induced longing somewhere deep in his toes that swelled into his scalp.
His class was a mix of ages between ten and fourteen. He smiled at the alpha sitting next to him, but she stared at him wide eyed. The same for the omega sitting on his left.
John told himself to put on the big boy pants and have an actual conversation with Sherlock about the results of his research. Because if he could ask Donovan about her childhood illness, bother Billy, he could ask Sherlock what he knew about himself. He held the results in a tight grip and said, "I've been researching your blood."
Under different circumstances, John might have asked Sh'Alaack what kind of modifications the engineering team had made to the shuttles to make the chairs easy to remove. Under different circumstances he might have chatted about what items had been replicated on the Bakerstreet and how many had come from Starbase 280, or explained what an infra-sensory drug even was.
Waves of a sudden release clenched inside him. It was too much. Not enough.
John moved closer to Sherlock, not entirely because of Sherlock's intoxicatingly sultry vanilla and honey scent. "Well?"
Sherlock looked away. Profile pale and set. "I thought about it on planet. Doing it again. But I saved Chin Singh from her injuries. Another choice might not have that result, or another could have resulted in my retaining my memories. Growing up with my siblings. Avoiding the damage to my mind."
They'd never slept in anything except skin. Not wanting something in the way, just in case one of them woke up in the middle of the night, which was most nights and they got in a second round of sweet slow love.
That he would only clean with his tongue and lips. His husband spent what remained of the night with his head resting between John's thighs. Licking and sucking on John's cock while working a dildo – the large ridged red one or the small blue one with the clitoral and anal antennae or the pronged green one – named the Klingon, the Andorian and the Vulcan respectively – inside John. Until John couldn't have said which sensation was the one that made him come.
"Sherlock, what is it?" John put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder. His blue eyes full of concern.
The omegas clustered together. Tediously talking. Finally, Sarabeth said, "You can stay, but if the two of you become violent when you revert, you're out."
"The lead dances all over this bar and kicks over bottles of alcohol to show the depths of his despair and anger," said Harry, pouring another drink. "It's fucking insane."
He almost didn't dare to hope.
She looked at it. She held it for a long time. Thumb moving over the slick surface of the screen. Thinking. Looking at an image from surveillance footage from the genetics facility.
So yeah, John could maybe save a colony.
The start of another pool for when the Commander and John would admit they were a couple, or at least stop protesting that they weren't.
Sherlock had dozens of hands and pseudopods. Multiple cameras to observe and adjust based on John's reactions.
Sherlock snorted. "You do know who are talking to. I know."
"This wasn't precisely living," said Sherlock. He sat up. Low level lighting flickered along the walls and led out the door. He said, "I've kept the emergency batteries fully charged. The lights throughout the facility are programmed to run in a pattern that should guide inhabitants into the landing bay."
"Old enough to be a child soldier on many worlds," said Killander. "Isn't that right, Ms. Hudson? Or do you prefer not to think of your work with the children on Calindrea Prime?"
Sarabeth looked up from where the alpha was purring, said, "Could you could translate that into something I can understand. If it's not the science of color, then I don't get it."
Nothing happened.
He knew Khan was alive and a danger to the Federation. If he could prove it.
Sherlock took three steps and gracefully sank to his knees. The carpet beneath his knees was soft. Not real. What was real was John's hand immediately tangling in his hair.
Donovan looked at him suspiciously when he sat next to her in the galley. "What do you want?"
Fine. She fluttered the love birds, but they were talking science.
Garak insisted on delivering his clothing order in person to Sherlock's assigned quarters. Garak looked around the room. "I'd have expected to see your good doctor here."
John sighed. That meant Jeffries Tubes.
Still on a personal mission, John asked for and eventually got, after promising to not mix it with her medical records, a spit sample from her. Not that he had a sample of her genome before Khan had made his alterations. However, Donovan and Sherlock shared hundreds of SNPs in areas associated with immune responses. They weren't relatives. Donovan had been born a hundred years ago in East London and Sherlock was thirty something from a mining colony primarily settled by Humans from the Appalachians.
"Yes, the right thing." Tentatively, Grandfather placed an arm around Connor and briefly squeezed. Connor was less tentative with his hug. Before bouncing off to re-explore parts of the house. Grandfather trailed him after him.
Sherlock tried another tack. "Has Mummy allied with a shapeshifter from the Gamma quadrant?"
Sestre washed his hands. "Are we really going to steal the stones from that shop?" He was not going to refer to them as eggs until it had been confirmed.
Mollyhoo looked even sadder and her scent didn't soften. "You probably don't remember me telling you this, but the treatment for time dilation affected the follicles in our ovarian tissue. Rendering us to all intents and purposes sterile. We can't have babies, which really makes no sense given how the judge was going on about how we were being sent back to pollute our kind with our weaknesses."
"Fine, you keep talking about me. Explain why you kept sneaking off at all hours of the night. Why should saw you leaving the theater with some bloke. The time she saw you snogging a stranger while dressed as the pirate queen of Orion in some bar," said John, who'd wanted to take Harry's side. Had taken Harry's side. Until Clara showed him the picture of Harry with some random Human. Laid into him as a proxy for laying into Harry.
"It's your heart," said the Redbeard. He knew that was the answer. He knew it as certainly as he knew his own name. "It was stolen by the evil Ice Queen for her partner, Yellowbeard, and placed in a bird inside a fox inside a sehlat that lives deep in the mountains.
Every night, as they fell asleep after their first coupling, Sherlock would tell himself that this night, he wouldn't break John's sleep. He would enjoy the simple pleasure of lying in bed with John. Luxuriate in something that they could never have enjoyed while hiding their relationship. Even when it was clear everyone knew, given the number of emergencies, before their marriage, they simply couldn't afford to fall asleep together too often.
"Quiet, Connor," said Billy sharply. He didn't want this Killander's attention on Connor at all. He needed time to think.
He didn't even know what to say.
He looked across the rather larger holding cell than he'd woken up in last time. More metal bunks. No blankets. Multiple cameras from each wall.
Martha would transport and Lucy would hold the ship in case there was another boarding party. Take the ship out of orbit and head for a starbase if there was any hint of being recaptured.
He looked uncertainly back at the corridor where Mummy and Ms. Yao had been standing, but he couldn't see them.
Sherlock whispered, "How do we get into the asylum?"
The next time he went through DS9, he stomped around with it. His leg ached while watching Benjamin cook. Although, Jake, who was growing like a weed, got the staff joke first. It seemed sometime in the last few months, someone had introduced Jake to Terry Prachett's Diskworld books.
Washington reached into a pouch and pulled out an energy bar. At John's look, he said, "I have a five year old, I always have snacks." He peeled it open and handed it to the man. "Yummy food, and more when you take us to the bringers of pain and delight."
Chin responded to Billy's communication as she'd promised she would.
(See the end of the chapter for
John slipped his hand through Sherlock's. After a long pause. "Suppose I should get to know all my in-laws."
"You did not go back in time to save yourself," said the Guardian. More mist swirled around the plaza. "I did ask if you wished to visit another time and place, which you declined."
There was little John could do, but follow.
Sherlock moved his hand over his groin, as if embarrassed, even managing a flush, which might have been the heat of the water.
After that, the conversation left behind the teen years and focused on what they could do right then.
Mollyhoo lay there, holding her belly and said, "It must be something we ate."
"Obvious," said the alpha, before the omega could answer. "There's a bracelet on the child's wrist with their name written on it."
"Pff," said Victorius. "They can't fight too much, because we're here." He jumped up and swung idly on a bar.
Sherlock held his hands to his lips. He'd archived those visits in the ancillary memory tower. They'd been scientific in nature.
"Oh, it was in a closet." Bihr grinned. "Strange ship. Unfamiliar circumstances. Any weapon to hand. Plus," They held one end to their lips and a horrible moaning noise came out of the thing. "It's also a flute."
A sore tooth. She wanted it pulled. She wanted to go back to reality as it had been. When she'd thought, Kodos long dead. When the past only haunted her every few weeks.
Billy kept up a steady murmur of comfort. Hudson went to sit on the other side, giving the boy a steady stream of, "I'm sure they would never hurt a child, dear. Not if they're not monsters."
(See the end of the chapter for
"No," said Sherlock, who was feeling more than a bit agitated.
John got a cup of tea.
"But not, as I understand it, Mycroft," said Sherlock sourly. "Small favors."
John quietly got ready in his morning routine. Showered. Shaved. Sterilized his ovaries, which the quick fuck they'd fit in before drifting off the previous evening had healed from his last de-fertilization. He replicated what he wanted to wear for the day. Dressed. Went out the door after pausing for another fond look at Sherlock.
Really far too many crew on the night shift wandered by such a remote part of the ship.
"Sort of," said Connor. "It was all kind of fuzzy. Like I was seeing everything through a greasy viewport and all I could think about was… well…" he blushed, which given the things he'd been shouting was a relief. "You know."
"He's a loose thread that hates Earth and Humans, and I am a Human," said Killander.
And he was soaking wet again.
"I do," said Killander. They all stood somewhat awkwardly about, until Killander said, "Dismissed." Everyone but Hudson left the ready room.
He put his hand over the slight curve of his belly. Really just the curve of intestines. The hormones produced by the blastocysts were only just beginning to tell his long dormant uterus to expand and make a space for what might, just might grow there.
Oh, if John stretched at the end of the meal and in any way indicated that he had a crick in his neck, Sherlock was on it. Pressing his thumbs into the muscles along his spine. Dragging his fingers through John's hair for a scalp massage and generally trying to drive John spare.
Sherlock fell back on his charts. The highest probability was John as wicked lab assistant, who needed to be punished with a spanking for leaving the lab equipment dirty. This was closely followed by wanton Sugar Baby, who flirted with Sherlock's colleagues before requiring some form of public coitus upon the lab equipment, which seemed a bit contradictory to Sherlock.
"Mother!" John did not know when he'd been transformed into a child again. But he knew he was bright red.
They both had an excellent time.
Prince Whatever crouched down, leaning forward, with a menacing smile. "Is that any way to speak to your captain?"
These spare hallways with wealth casually illuminating the rooms should not have evoked a sense of familiarity.
"I know stories about pirates," said Victorius landing on the ground with a solid thud.
"I'm told they do that at this age." Lucy smiled wryly. "If I could, I'd like to use your communications array to send a message to Andor. I want to make sure that my contacts in the Andorian government know we're here in case we need backup."
Maybe if John were more attached to his North American Augment ancestors, he'd have been a bit more moved by the discovery of the Preamble of the American Constitution as some sort of holy work, but he'd just spent three days being solidly, relentlessly, gloriously shagged by Sherlock. He was lucky he could still walk.
"Your spittle is showing," said Sherlock, as another idea occurred to him. "Julian. I'm Sherlock. Wilkes switched bodies with me. I didn't start calling you Julian until,"
Twisting things that John had said in bed, after sex, and… it was not on.
"He's not ready," said Julian. "He needs at least another several hours of treatment."
The environment shifted again. They were in a hotel room. Sherlock was sitting on the edge of a bed half dressed. John was pulling a silk handkerchief out of his breast pocket. "Have you ever gone to a hotel room with a stranger?"
Sholto blurted, "Ceti III, that's only a few light years from Taurus IV, isn't it?"
Sherlock held in his hand the last cube. The creation of which was what had triggered his flight through the time portal. He put it down and picked up the very first cube.
GWAS:
"Except," Chin sighed, "that. Now that you know, you need to stay. But any Augments that are brought here are being returned to their families. We free the Augment Inferior from the shackles of a society that doesn't trust them. Arrests them without provocation. Holds them back."
She gasped, suddenly pale and limp. Gasping in pain. It was a clean break. No skin broken. It should heal. Certainly it would keep her out of his way and from bothering the weaker alphas. The omegas would be able to avoid her if they wanted.
Over the last few months, and really perhaps through much of the physical aspect of their relationship, he'd thought of John as a sort of embodiment of eros. John had a far greater level of sexual experience. Certainly a higher degree of sexual confidence. The way his very scent made Sherlock feel out of control. Overwhelming his senses, sensibility, and any training he'd been monotonously given by his parents.
Which wasn't fair. She hadn't meant for anything to happen the way it had. She hadn't meant… she'd only wanted.
He was near a place where ships were built for space. His father had worked at New Gol. Sometimes, he wished his father had been transferred to New Gol, but his father was working in an established Starfleet shipyard.
He stared at the blank screen for several minutes, before deciding what he needed was a drink.
Reminder to look at the tags re: Non-Con and pairings.
John went inside. The arch of what once had been a grand lobby was packed wall to wall with beds and people. Telarites. Caitian. Bolians. Races from all over the Federation. Fewer Andorians than he would have thought what with this being their planet.
Sherlock was kneeling on the bed wearing a red robe this time, his black collar, a vivid black stripe on against his pale skin, and nothing else. He was typing rapidly into a tablet, which he set aside. "I'm hoping to distract you from my completely incorrect deductions about our relationship."
She had been doing well. The story man gave her an idea and it was easy to slip away from her doctor and her guard. To go see her brothers and sisters. To go play with them.
"Oh," said the one on the right. "That sounds fair."
Reminder to look at the tags for non-con, albeit different in nature that the previous chapter.
Two Ferengi ships sending a signal that the ship should surrender or be destroyed. No ship's registry.
His new classmates watched him.
"Kay, but it's a great number." Harry laughed. "Lots of angry feelings. It's beautiful."
He applied his own algorithm and found what he had expected.
John laughed, suddenly feeling lighter. "I could use a party." He shot Donovan a look. "But maybe have Khatri arrange it."
There were four beings there when he arrived: Sisko, the changeling Odo, a Captain –
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock laughed. "Most people are idiots, but you are less than some."
Sherlock watched John read the casualty list. John said, "Hatherley presumed dead on the USS Churchill."
Even as they turned options and possibilities over in their mind. There were too many options. Possibilities. Too random to ensure. Seeing as it would require three rival tigers to lay down together in harmony. Khans. Tigers. Yet with the three of them, with a version of their child returned to them, they might accomplish much.
He levered himself up. "Hudson?"
When she got the breath mask off her face, she wouldn’t say much more than, "I was careless."
Melas was sitting on a marble bench smiling dreamily at the forest. They were dressed in a Greek chiton. Entirely out of uniform. But given how he himself must look, John couldn't judge.
Lucy kept her arms around Eva. She met Ishros' gaze and said, "Us big kids will look after the little ones."
He handed her a data pad. "This is the alpha who saved your life when you were a child."
"Now Pavan, you know we're all only going to argue if we get into this," said Veema placating, "Let's stick to the generally agreed upon theology." They smiled gently. "Doctor Watson, based on your condition, you'd just given birth prior to coming through the time portal and while chromosomal DNA can't suggest more than overall genetic groups, both Y chromosomal DNA from the father's haplogroup and the mother's mitochondrial DNA are a very different story." They grinned and spread their hands. "We believe…no… we know that you are our great mother, because not only are you are the only omega to reproduce in that era who did not originate on this world, but you are the one whose mitochondrial DNA upon which all the rest are based. You are the first omega before all the rest. You are… how does that scripture of your planet go… oh, yes, I know… 'I am the alpha and I am the omega.' Surely, it was speaking of you."
In a corporeal form, Sherlock would have been overwhelmed by the biological impulse that smile engendered in him. Embodied in a different way, he could ventilate areas of the facility that had grown dusty with disuse and marvel at this constant star, who loved him.
Even after ending up getting a Bakerstreet dozen worth of knocked up on Omega IV, yet another parallel Earth through yet another dimensional fissure.
Ambassador Sirok bowed to the Tamarians after the play's finish, and said, "The wryrd sisters to Banquo upon the moor."
Hunter came in. She had every excuse not to talk to the captain. Julian was there, but she talked to the misery goo cloud that was their captain like an idiot.
The squeeze of their hand on Mycroft's shoulder was all the reminder that Mycroft needed that he was also a disappointment. That the first Mycroft, that often storied child Mummy had valued enough to clone, would not have failed. Mycroft crushed the familiar thought that Mummy hadn't cared enough to ensure that that perfect first version had made it onto the sleeper ships fleeing Earth.
"Does the prince have many children?"
He also heard John yelp, almost dropping the tricorder. "Sherlock was that you?"
She had just put out a fresh pot of Darjeeling when Killander confronted her about the lack of anything to find in certain areas of the ship, she pulled up the logs of the last ten anomalies they'd encountered. "Is that a problem? We do encounter so very many anomalies."
"You have been very quiet," said Sestre looking at Connor seriously. "Is it because of the abrupt nature of our field trip?"
"Accidents happen. They happen all the time and doctors fix them." He turned away.
Nom reached for the fallen disruptor, but John put his foot on it.
"The Sugar Daddy said, 'You're doing very well Baby, can you take a little more? You can't get your medicine unless Daddy can get it all inside you.' And since the naughty Sugar Baby was very eager to get his medicine, he wriggled around the monstrously big prick to slide more of it into him."
"We only need you," said Gendel. "The others are irrelevant. The other Alignments' problem."
Like listening to Donovan telling her that she should relieve herself of duty for the good of the crew.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mum and Dad are pretty liberal about sex, all sex positive and all that. None of the strange attitudes that you find on Earth, but I was getting out control. My grades were taking a nose dive. There was no way I was getting into the academy or becoming a doctor if we didn't do something." He sighed thinking back on the whole mess. How angry Harry had gotten with him. How much she'd blamed him.
"You should. Only thing good I did in my life was Jame." He patted the device with the side of a foot. "And I suppose this."
Their conversation ended as an alpha came into the room and Bihr was assigned duties.
John reached across him to the trays on the tiled table. He fed Sherlock tiny delicacies. All of them something that Sherlock hadn't managed to hide that he'd enjoyed in the past, but reformatted to look like something else. Between every bite, John stole kisses. Tasting Sherlock's mouth. Nipping his chin. Biting his long neck as Sherlock whimpered, whispering to Sherlock, "I love pleasing you. Perhaps I'll purchase you. Own you. Keep you for my personal delight and spend my every day delighting the wonder that you are." One handed, he teased the labia beneath Sherlock's cock, while supporting himself over Sherlock with the other.
"Eloquent as ever," said the alpha. "And out of uniform again." He waved a long thin wand at John. "One inferior, a bit long in the tooth, won't be much of a reward there." He waved the wand at Sh'Alaack, "and Bihr Sh'Alaack. Terrorists, especially ones with this one's reputation, are a bit outside your jurisdiction these days, Donovan."
Mother authorized three of their fastest ships within a moment's hesitation.
She backed away just as he lunged at her.
"But Mummy, we haven't disappeared from existence. That should mean there's hope. Sherlock will survive. He must."
Her skin crawled with every level they went down. She forced herself to calm herself by noting the shift in styles. Neo-Classical had given way to Post-Urban tunnel design. She thanked all the lectures from Khel over the years. "We must be headed to the cave system beneath the city."
"What is it?" They'd had to climb multiple ladders to reach this point. "Acheron, are you injured?"
"Transport," moaned Sherlock theatrically and did a fair impression of a dying maiden over his chair. But by now the command staff knew to ignore those type of comments.
"Lucky," said Marida.
While Elise – and by extension John – were wont to ascribe all manner of benefits to theater, and certainly used a greater degree of archaic words than the normal population, not only was that an odd phrasing, but it was extremely out of character that she had visited Harry three times since she'd been transferred there and had yet to make the request.
Sherlock opened his eyes. The world was bright. Bare. Exposed. He pulled back further into John, for all that something was off in his scent. It was too sweet. Cloying. A rival. Not what he needed for the heat blooming between his thighs.
Sherlock came to his quarters to push food around. Their knees would bump under the table. Their hands would brush over the table. John would watch Sherlock very occasionally lift a fork and slide food between his lips. Breathe his scent. His mouth would water at the rich taste of the air. That tinge of arousal.
"Follow you, Master," he laid one hand on John's left knee, rubbing his thumb along the inside of John's leg. "Because I belong to you." He moved between John's legs.
"Oh, there's plenty of Augments on Earth, dear," said Hudson.
"Then I must enjoy their blessing while I can." John pushed back Sherlock's hair. "And enjoy Venus revealed." Sherlock blushed.
While Ayaba licked his lips and said, "I haven't gotten any magic cock yet."
John stopped just inside the door. "When did you get that?" He came closer. "That's hand made."
The miner looked at John as if he was developmentally disabled. "These creatures eat the minerals we want to mine. Our minerals. Our world."  His lips curled back. "And you're telling me that there could be thousands of the fuckers." He reached over to the storage sled and picked up an egg. It shattered as he threw it against the far wall.
The Governor and the council were courteous. Chief Gremel, who ran operations at the Janus mine and ore refinery, was a different matter. "Don't need no Breen. We're a Feddy colony We apply for aid again!" He slapped a large hand missing his little finger on the table top.
"Yeah, well, take my word for it, some kids find puberty hard. I was one of them." John picked up Sherlock's right hand. Ran a thumb over long fingers capable of making John feel like he was flying. While on fire. "Sex was really all I could think about. Which was bad enough. But I convinced our Prop master's son, Tadpole, Christ I haven't thought of him in years, that we wouldn't get caught if we did it on the bed from one of the Jacobian revenge plays. Not that it took much convincing. He was as randy as I was. Course, we did get caught and there was a terrible row." Sherlock had to know. "That was the worst incident, but um… not the only time I tried to go out catting."
John was one step away from hitting a superior officer. His hands were in fists. His heart was pounding. "My father is not a mass murderer. He's an actor. He kills people on stage with replicated synthblood. That's all."
Lucy said, "I think they've been sleeping together."
"Second Officers' quarters."
"What is it?" asked Amazing Sparkles, who tried to peer at the tablet.
"You wouldn't be alone," said Miri softly. "Lots of onlies. Us olders made sure to keep them fed."
John knew the look of someone who had been well fucked when he saw them.
The thought caused no distress. Biology. The past. Sherlock said, "I promise I will not impregnate you while inhabiting the consciousness of an alien underground facility with a cyborg, demon, or any other sort of child."
John took Sherlock's hand and ran.
Told himself every damn data cube was a promise that he was going to see Sherlock again. Pulled up his chin, put back his shoulders, and got to it.
Victor breathed in and out. "Slightly more interesting, I suppose." He leaned back, his hands splayed on the bed. "Such a comfort to reconfirm the constant of any universe. Everyone works to their own benefit."
They kissed Apollo in answer. Their words shaped by every relationship that had come before. "My thoughts are only of you. I'm full of questions. Are you truly a god? Are you really Apollo?"
"Is to go into heat." Lucy told the empty lab. She sighed. Logged onto Bakerchat and went to the Augment channel. She let everyone know what had happened and her concerns.
"And that you are in the ninety-ninth percentile of the human population for augmented markers in your DNA."
He'd never even imagined his parent's crying a single tear over any historical deed. Had an ounce of regret. Harry's moan demonstrated her own lack of imagination now well fed.
Billy shook his head vehemently. His eyes narrowing. "I never want to go back to Earth. I don't even like going down to the planets we've visited just yet." He looked around the room. "Here or on a space station I know I'm in the future. I can hear it in the hum of the engines. The way the air feels. But, maybe, I can go somewhere else. My grandfather may have never made it to another world, but we can."
Afterwards, he surprised to find there were only five fertilized ovum. John would have expected given he hadn't been nuking his ovaries. Hadn't been in months.
Privately, Chin doubted they'd ever be allowed to go. They were princes of the 23
Connor came out of the bedroom into the living area of their quarters and Billy stuffed away the communicator hastily. But Connor didn't give him the worried look he generally gave when he saw Billy mooning over the communicator. Instead he said, "I'm worried about Eva." He looked at her wide eyed. "Ms. Hebron was turned into teenager in an accident. It's all over the Augment channel on Bakerchat."
Lucy was holding an inconsolable Eva, who was crying raggedly. Not important. None of them were dead.
Plus, Sherlock smelled like bread and breakfast and love and sunshine.
Moriarty smiled genially. Falsely. "I know you're rightly upset. Rightly. But maybe we should wait until we reach Bencia. An explosive accident at a drunken wake on a moonlit beach will be a bit more likely than everyone on the ship died of being spaced except the two of us. Or you don't you want to keep your nice new ship. The nice new trade up of a body."
"He is that. And it can be tiring proving my worth over and over to idiots. Then I remind myself how fortunate that I've found a home where there's a relatively low quotient of idiots." She picked a piece of fluff off his fatigues. "Our captain just can't stand them."
Mummy's blood had healed Donovan. Sherlock had healed John of many minor injuries.
That was that.
He wanted John. John knew it with every aching bone in his body. He just needed a push.
Not just the idiot that Sherlock always called him, but a true idiot, because everyone wasn't dead.
Eva giggled. "Silly. Flopsy is an Omega boy. See." She pointed at a tiny tuft of yarn that had unraveled between Flopsy's legs.
Alignment opened their mouth and Karak of the 9
Sherlock's hand stilled.
"And when will you be finished running tests?" asked Connor reasonably. Firmly. Connor was not going to stay in this sterile place a moment more than he needed to. He was going to sleep in a real bed that night with no restraints.
Donovan, who had requested to remain on the Bakerstreet said, "It's the freak's custom."
Governor Hobb and the members of the January colony council greeted her courteously. Of course, they were directly experiencing what were mere numbers on her reports. A mining colony with declining production and a declining population in a location that required considerable effort to sustain life.
More and more expected to be outside his division.
John peeled himself out of his silly flannels and wiped himself down with them. Normally, he'd have felt sleepy after coming like that, but instead he felt energized.
That she would not only not receive a similar courtesy when an agent would be boarding her ship was insulting. But even worse was that the only reason she had any warning at all was Garak had had sent her an amusing video of a cat toying with a mouse when sending her a message listing some of her sartorial options for the next time she visited DS9.
But as crew who'd known him as Lieutenant and Doctor Watson left and were replaced by those who knew him as the captain's husband, John Watson, the ship's doctor, in that order, he could see a trend that he didn't like.
John felt horrible, but he pressed on with, "Yeah, I actually meant um… Christ this awkward. It's just I haven't wanted to talk to you because I know what you went through with Colonel Green, but Augments don't have a lot of records on why our augmentations present certain ways." He shrugged. "Too much mixing from the original strain." He held up his hands. "I'm not saying now, but if you're ever ready to let me take a look at your DNA, you might be able to help augments know a bit more about ourselves. Understand some of the problems we have, medically speaking." It hadn't been his first reason for wanting to ask, but when John had thought of it, the reasoning actually made sense.
John looked at Sherlock and tried not to think about how much he loved the git standing next to him.
Connor stayed close to his mum. They made their way to through the mall at the center of the colony. There were all sorts of people from all over shopping and eating and drinking. It was a lot larger than the Promenade on DS9.
She opened communications with engineering. "Sh'Alaack, I want you to scan every inch of that planet looking for where the energy isn't. Process of elimination, we'll find what's giving these so called gods their power. Also, I need you to send a tech to the nuclear electrical lab and work on an M-wave transmitter. That should be able to punch through to the surface so we can contact our crewmates."
Chin examined him closely. "We can figure it out."
It went on and on and on.
John said, "Where is the consciousness that you took from us?"
"I do not want Mummy to interfere, I know what form their interference takes," said Sherlock. Who added, "Sod off," for good measure.
Also, the soup was blue. John sniffed it and tasted it. It was creamier than bones and veg could make water. Sherlock mimed milking in a way that made John's heart squeeze. He would have kissed Sherlock, but there was soup in the way.
The tricorder readings John beamed back were inconclusive. The remains had been incinerated with acid not a beam weapon, but there were no traces of acid leading from the location where the dead man had been found and where the part in the power plant had been stolen. Also, the type of acid did not match the acid remains in the suddenly appearing tunnel into the plant.
"Good. Again. Deeper." John pressed his lips to those open lips as they inhaled. Nothing more than suction as he let out his own breath. Then moving to sit again. "Again." Gathered up falls of silken hair to rub the tips of fingers into Sherlock's scalp. Drawing moans and twisting hips with nothing more than hands in Sherlock's hair. Fingers circling Sherlock's scalp.
Bihr raised her chin and tried to think of what Watson or Donovan would say. "There aren't."
(See the end of the chapter for
The Watson wearing Watson's rings yelled, "Sh'Alaack, it's me. I'm John Watson."
It didn't bring any of the other adults back to the ship, and much less Sherlock. But really that wasn't the point.
"No, kill them now," Nom reached out to take the disruptor, but Lurin moved away from him.
It was a mistake to do the calculation.
Marida pulled one of the bamboo stakes narrowing the path out of the dirt.
Chin couldn't let herself think about that.
It was a hard discussion to have. Particularly with Thill making noises in the background.
"I want to become a black hole that swallows other black holes until there's nothing left." He pulled out a silky handkerchief and blew his nose. "She doubts that I can be a Gentil Parfait Knight. I want to show her that I can, but," he waved a hand, "I'm worried about black butterflies."
Grandfather's heartbeat was steady. His smile calm, but there was something off. "In due time, the Augments here will be given the option to be released. Our current plan has not reaped the increase in our population as we'd hoped." He looked at Connor. "When you do start school, you'll be meeting the children of those accepted a life here. As well as children of first generation Augments." His eyebrows quirked. "Four of them ranging from eight to seventeen." He tilted his head. "All the children the first generation of the 23rd Alignment has had in the last twenty years."
The Klingons looked flummoxed by this whole speech. They moved closer together, which was when John dusted them with the spray bottle and managed by keeping it on tight spray to not get any on himself.
Eva blanched and said, in a high pitched voice, "Mommy, I'm scared."
Full of plans, he took possession of his excellent office after a thorough cleaning.
But the brown eyed Breen kept talking. "Just because Sarpeidon," inspiring several rude gestures, "believed it doesn't mean it isn't true." They turned to John. "I am Terellhoo of the 22
With angry jerky motions, she adjusted settings on the spectrum calibrator from her tool kit. Emitted a counter wave form to negate whatever field was disrupting her readings.
John wanted to say that he was ready. He wanted to speak. But he didn't. He bit his lower lip and held all words at bay.
Still, he never went there.
Ancestors.
Sherlock was one step from being sedated again. He must be calm. "Mummy, when you kidnapped me from my quarters before the Borg attack, I had a thought that it was over my well-being. But you had access to Sarpeidon's records. You knew he sterilized all the omegas who went into the past. That's why you modified my healing abilities."
Billy said, "I guess somewhere along the way, Augments forgot some things." He looked at the monitor. "It's funny that we'd forget something like that. I mean, I don't expect many people to remember my grandfather, but Khan Brittanus had the same genetic trait. They went through Juvenile heat." He sighed. "Mum had it. I have it, and now I know for sure that," he looked at the monitor, "Connor has it." He looked at John. "Will you be able to do something?" He looked frantic. "I don't want to him to go through what I did. I could have been killed by Colonel Green's men or a random stranger when I left my hiding place back in London. But I still broke out of our safe house because I needed to… you know."
John also got an explanation for what was so painful when the blastocysts attached. The dreadnaughts still left floating around
Sherlock, still red faced, sat down, in a chair several paces from John's still clutching the Horga'hn, and mutinously wondered why it was harder to determine John's desires now that he wasn't pretending to be a hologram. He glared at a falsely beautiful blue sea. Thought about how since Risa's weather was controlled, the gentle seas of Risa were fake as well, if in a different way.
He counted down the days for what he could have.
She twisted the unfamiliar ring that had been the first design on the list on her finger and recorded a log to send to Julian.
It did not help when the object of his anger was sitting with his parents in his quarters having tea.
Rosie knows about Eurus. So does her husband. Although Torrance is a nephew of Sherlock and Mycroft on their cousins’ side, she prays that no one damaged like Eurus’ will ever come into her family. Or someone who will make the same choices as her mother did.
“She was killed by a bad woman.”
“Did she like shrimp scampi with linguini, too?” Rochie inquires.
--0--
Only Rosie and her family are still up with Sherlock and John. They will sleep in John’s former room.
“Sherlock is against it.” Greg says, holding tightly Molly’s hand in his.
“Because this is how we love,” Sherlock explains, taking the lockets and hanging them again in their pride of place in the Christmas Memory Tree.
Rosie nodded. “But they never did anything about it. I knew because Daddy never told Sherlock. He was afraid Sherlock didn’t feel that way even when I told him he was mistaken.”
) Before the Beings left, a big and wireless flat TV screen popped up before them and the men were shown their double funerals. They saw their families, friends, and acquaintances. John wept when he saw Rosie. Sherlock embraced him several times.
He straightened his shoulders and gave his lover a piercing gaze. “William, I am thrilled that you want to marry me. But, I have a question: do you love me enough to want to stay with me for a very long time, if not the rest of our lives? You know my nature.”
William paled, then blushed. “I-I was going to ask for your hand in marriage this Christmas. At Angelo’s.”
“Hmmm. Very nice of them. Wait, we’re in a hotel? Weren’t we running after Jumping Jack Flash?”
--0--
“And yours was really good?” John counters.
“Why?” Edwina yawns out.
“This this this.” Edwina waves the laminated Smileys at Sherlock.
“Do come here, Torrance, you are a part of the family, are you not?” The the man says without looking at his son-in-law. Torrance, still a bit shy of his in-laws, moves behind Rosie. John gives him a reassuring smile.
'Mr. Roarke' and 'Tattoo' were actually more than men--they were Beings (
William Scott looked up from his journal. “Shaun?”
Understanding dawned in the doctor’s eyes. “Oh, you cock!”
He jiggles his arse.
“Good. That’s the idea.”
His lover came to stand behind him. A large pale hand covered his own tanned one. “Don’t pick on it,” his lover said before kissing the top of Shaun’s head. Long arms embraced him tightly and lips kissed his shoulder. “We’ve been lovers for six years. What really brought this on?”
The man is unrepentant. With a liplick, he opens his legs and thrusts his hips in invitation.
William took the envelope, handing Shaun the misshapen socks.  As he tore it open, his lover unrolled the socks… and gasped.
Edwina yawns. Rochie is almost asleep on his father’s lap, clutching tightly his new book on the solar system. John’s gift.
Greg looked at Mycroft. His lover nodded. They were lucky: years ago, they made a different choice from the one that John and Sherlock made. This weekend, they will tell Rosie and his children about their relationship.
All the men in the wedding party have boutonnieres. But in John’s and Sherlock’s, there is a small Smiley pin included among the spray of tiny white rosebuds.
). They just assumed the personalities Dr. Watson loved and was familiar with while growing up. (
“We weren’t there.” John’s face has a slightly sour expression.
John clasps his lover’s arse to his face and bites a cheek.
His lover turns his back. With hip pops, he unties his jacket. Twirls the belt.
“But not meddle.”  John had cheered up somewhat as he realized their possibilities.
John jumps a little. Men’s voices. Looks around.
“Shut up. We’re dead and we’ll never get to be with Rosie as she grows up.” He dabbed at the tears on his face with a hankie.
After a long discussion, and much kissing and teasing, between John and Sherlock, men who resembled actors Ricardo Montalban and Herve Villechaize  approached them. (
Her father gave her a piercing look.  “Don’t worry so. You are Mary’s child, Rosie. As well as mine and Sherlock’s. But you are also your own person. You are Rosamund Catherine Watson and you are alright.”
“Guiliano will be very happy to see you again, Rosie. He’ll undoubtedly be the one to cook the scampi for you and pair it with his best dry, white wine.” Sherlock smiles at Torrance. “Old flame and all that. I’m sure she has told you.”
“Dad… We did apologize.”
“That’s romantic, Papa,” Rosie teases.
Sherlock sits up, arms encircling his raised knees. “Because she saved me.” His face is impassive. John reaches out to clasp his hand tightly. His husband smiles at him.
John returns his look and smiles. “Yes, that we do.”
Rosie blushes. “Is he alright after the divorce?”
“I was. Drunk and asleep,” the detective said tightly. “Spent most of last night with Lister and Molly.” He rummaged some more, this time in his sock drawer. “Found it!” He got up, clutching a  pair of navy socks. It was… out of shape with a small light blue envelope jutting from it.
) The gentlemen explained that Sherlock and John died when the criminal Jumping Jack Flash shot them and that they were in their version of Heaven. (
--0--
“Why? Have you answered my question?”
“That’s really, uh, some song-breaking,” Sherlock comments diplomatically.
Without turning, his partner jabbed the newspaper towards him. It showed a page containing an interview with Steven Moffat, the co-creator of BBC Sherlock.
Rosie crossed herself and laid down the bouquet of wild flowers on her father’s side of the grave. Beside it lay the white roses which Sherlock favored.
Shaun gaped. “It’s been there all along? But we—we did so many…red pants on Mondays…” he sputtered and stopped, crimson-faced. He wondered if he will find his arse staring back at him someday on Porn Tube.
“Typical.”
“Yeah, we did. But…Was that how it went, William?” Shaun asked, still looking out on the quiet night street below. “I know I advised you to go after her, because I thought you…Do you still wish to--” he did not go on. He picked on a loose yarn of his cashmere jumper, William’s gift last Christmas.
“If we did, you’d be too full to eat dinner at your grandparents. You know how sad that makes your Grandpa John.”
“The dining table looks as if one of your experiments exploded on it,” John whispers happily to his husband as they clear away the mess. In the sitting room, the adults are chatting. Greg’s daughter by his first marriage, Marie the astronaut, regales the young ones with stories of her first trip to the moon.
--0--
Sherlock laid a hand on his. It startled John as his friend rarely did this. He tried to dampen the pleasure which always crept up his body and hoped that the man wouldn’t notice his deepening flush.
Sherlock singing, teasingly seductive. Reworded song and recorded professionally.
“Where’s the fun in that? At Rochie’s age, I tasted my first ale. At 14, my first smoke.”
The detective rolled his eyes. “Must you copy the media? That’s a ridiculous, lighthearted name for a serial killer.” He popped a pale purple macaron into his mouth.
John bursts out laughing.
John answers, “That is Mary Morstan Watson. Your grandmother. She died when your mommy was 6 months old.”
" She carefully moves onto the floor and draws Edwina into her arms.
Sherlock wakes up to John licking off the remaining edible paint.
Sherlock rises from his chair, stalks toward the mother and child in three high steps, and bellows, "
“Ow!” Sherlock rubs the offended part, glaring at John.
Undulating, he slowly turns around.
Angelo was also there, but left for his restaurant to oversee the wedding breakfast.
--0--
The glare melts into a pout and a heated gaze.
John takes them down and give them to the little girl. “The dark brown hair is Rochie’s. Yours is the dark blond. The golden brown and gold hair tied together belong to your parents. The black and silver belong to us, your grandparents.”
“Well, this sucks.”
“When we’re older and can understand,” Rochie adds wisely.
His lover rises from the bed, clad in midnight blue silk bed jacket and trousers. No shirt.
“Sherlock! Don’t. We won’t ruin him his chances for happiness.”
William closed the journal and scanned the piece. He looked up. “You did get that that was how he imagined the relationship went. We did give him and Mark creative license.”
But Sherlock grabs the boy, much to his delight. Rochie is deposited on his mother’s other side, before Sherlock sits down on the floor as well, leaning against his arms.
Rochie chortles, then covers his mouth. Edwina and Torrance look at each other, uncertain. Rosie and John try to keep a straight face, but fail and burst out laughing.
“Why?”
“So do I,” Sherlock replies. They look at each other.
“Oi, it’s not questionable! You said during one anniversary that I have an overall salubrious effect on you. Mycroft agreed.”
The next time he wakes up, John is raining kisses on his face.
Edwina goes to Sherlock and hugs him. “Will you tell us the story someday?”
“Your parents’ wedding in Ghana.” Rochie squints at the smiling couple surrounded by people in colorful robes.
John looks at him in surprise, then laughs.
. And when your baby brother is born, his picture will also be here. ”
“No. Why?”
“AWOOOOOOOOO!” John howls loudly. Far away, several dogs answer back.
William gave him the trademark sociopathic grin that actor Benedict Cumberbatch made famous.
“Five, “ Sherlock says as John looks at him. “I was five.”
Shaun, Capt. Shaun Hamish Douglass, already knew his answer. So, he stood at attention like the honorable ex-soldier he is and gave his answer. “William, I admit there will be times when I will admire a woman’s charms. But I choose you. I CHOSE YOU. What's more, I loved you before I chose you. I settled that question with myself a long time ago and I am happy with it. I am content with it. My love and my faithfulness will always be yours, no matter how much you try my patience and my sanity.”
“Sherlock!” John exclaims and glares at him.
Sherlock ignored him. “As I said, we can counsel her in her career and love life—”
“Will mine get you to say ‘Yes’?”
“He always asks us about you whenever we go there,” John adds.
"Lestrade and his inept crew must have brought us here. Although, why not the hospital?" Sherlock finished his pastry and picked a cucumber and cream cheese sandwich. "Must be Mycroft's doing, then. I won't thank him." He grinned, but John seemed not to have heard him at all.
“Do you think she—But weren’t you here?”
John’s eyes and grin widen. Sherlock goes to him and bids him sit on the padded chair behind him.
“Earl Grey, please,” he said as he sat down, a bit dumbfounded. “How and where did you get these?” Porcelain tea service, finger sandwiches, scones, macarons, cakes, jams and orange marmalades.
As William smiled in relief, his mobile beeped. He closed his eyes in irritation for a while before he looked at the text.
Rosie, who is now kneeling beside her daughter, turns over the picture frame. “What is this YouTube link?”
She touches and examines closely the decorations. Aside from tinsels, lovely glass balls, and twinkling lights, the tall tree has tiny framed pictures of her family and people she does not know; a picture of strange old village; four glass lockets containing hair locks (black and silver; golden brown and gold, dark brown, dark blond). Porcelain things like a tiny violin and some others. Laminated Smiley icons.  Why?
“Yes.”
“That’s Mrs. Hudson,” John says. “She was our landlady. You and Rochie would have loved her. Your momma did. She was like a mother and fairy godmother rolled into one.”
“I told you—for the memories.”
A fresh wave of tears gripped Rosie. Mycroft laid his arm around her shoulders and squeezed. On her other side, Greg held her hand. They did not say anything.
All the adults hold their breath, but there are ready answers prepared years ago.
“It was there in the way my brother gazed at John when he thought your father wasn’t looking. Now, it’s too late.” Mycroft sighed heavily.  “This is my way of giving them that chance. Maybe I should have meddled when they were still--alive, but…”
“Don’t forget: the children’s eggnog are whiskey-free.”
Shaun replied tonelessly, “I saw Irina leave the apartment early this morning just as I arrived by cab.”
John walked through the flower garden. He wanted to  take his time looking at the plants as they were glorious—from traditional roses to wild flowers he and Sherlock liked. Speaking of his partner, where was he? He was the reason why John couldn’t amble here in the first place. His friend was missing.
He patted her shoulder. “They loved each other. More than friends and partners. Surely you noticed, child?”
The flat is full. Molly and Greg and their children, Harry and Clara, Rosie and her family, Sherlock and John. Only Mycroft and his family are not there, having been forced to attend an important ambassador’s ball as one of the King’s representatives.
Mycroft sniffles and dabs his handkerchief against his nose. “You have a cold?” Greg asks, although he knows the man was sniffling for another reason.
At that, Edwina brightens and skips ahead several paces with her brother.
Edwina looks at them, then at her brother. Rosie feels that some message passes between her children. At the same time, the baby in her womb kicks slightly as if in sympathy. She  winces and massages her stomach.
“But we were at their civil wedding here in London,” Sherlock adds hurriedly. “We were very happy… just lots of people.  Mycroft was happy with the big cake. Your Aunt Anthea had to pull him home.” He clears his throat and nudges his husband with an elbow. “Come on, John. You know what love can do.”
“No… I had hoped for a church wedding for my little brother.”
When the young girl’s expression falls at that, her elder brother, Rochie, takes her hand. “Come on, Eddie! There’s still tomorrow. We’ll be going to Uncle Mycroft’s and he always has caramel apples for us.”
“Is that a ‘yes’?”
Uncle Mycroft wanted a single common grave for the men they loved most. Expensive Italian marble with their names etched and plated in real gold. Typical of Uncle Mycroft, but Rosie did not resent it. In fact, she thought the style honored her father and Sherlock. Untypical men, great men whom Heaven took away from their families too early. She wanted more time with her father and adopted father—decades—and not the 16 years granted her.
“That was taken on our wedding day at the registry office.”
“Love life? I’m all for it, then. We can scare assholes away from her.”
“Last,” the girl insists.  She points out at the glass lockets on the top of the tree.
Sherlock slowly shimmies the jacket down his body. Throws it to the side.
“I thought my answer had been obvious so many times, my love.”
“For us to remember our loved ones and the things we value,” her Grandpa John says as he sits beside her. Rochie is on grandpa’s chair, owlishly gazing at her.
John smiles.  “How did we get so lucky to have you two?”
Sherlock turns to Rochie. “
He rounded a turn in the large garden and stopped.
“That is Angelo outside his restaurant. Your Grandpa John and I often eat there, although Angelo has retired years ago. His son runs it now. We used to bring your momma there as well.”
Futile wish, as usual. Except that, this time, Sherlock did not remove his hand. The man tightened his hold. John couldn’t help responding. He returned the gesture and looked with guarded hope at his friend. There was a blush on Sherlock’s cheeks and a smile on his lips.
A bomb. William stiffened. “You did? And you thought--” He turned Shaun around to face him. He was angry. “Shaun Hamish Douglass, I have never been unfaithful to you! Ever!” Then he dashed into their bedroom. Alarmed, the doctor followed suit. The detective was opening drawers and his cabinet, the boxes under their bed.
John chuckles and wraps a leg around him. “I don’t think I can ever look at another person’s breasts without seeing yours with the Smiley’s on them.”
Sherlock grunts agreement, frowning at the eggnog he is making.
" Edwina squeals and hides her face in her mother’s neck, body quivering in excitement.
Edwina gasps. “Is she like Ella’s fairy godmother?” she asks.
Sherlock bends, rips off his trousers. A pale gold silk thong.
It is near 11 o’clock and some of the guests have left two hours ago. The unwrapped gifts are piled under the Christmas tree. Harry and Clara are sleeping overnight downstairs, at the former 221A, since it now doubles as guestroom and file room. (The whole townhouse is owned by  John and Sherlock since Mrs. Hudson left it to them when she joined her Maker ten years ago.)
The flat is silent for a minute. Then it erupts: the Lestrade twins chant fuck fuck fuck, Molly and Greg admonish their kids; Marie and Rochie laugh, Harry and Clara giggle, Rosie and Torrance, well, they couldn’t decide whether to laugh or be dismayed.
He flexes his pectoral muscles, one after the other, just like the You Tube video taught him. Satisfied, he blows out a nervous breath. He’s never done anything like this before, not even in any of the cases he was required to go undercover. But, then, his lover and quarry is not like any other for him…
"I said, this sucks."
“John is a hopeless romantic,” he says disdainfully, but Greg sees a slight smile on his face.
Nana Hudson, Uncle Mycroft and his family, Aunt Harry and Clara, Uncle Greg and Aunt Molly.
Torrance checks his mobile phone.  “I think the meeting can wait for next week. This is a vacation, after all.”
“I still talk to her at times,” John says.
“He did,” Greg answered. “Sherlock loved John, but he kept quiet. We don’t know why.”
“Hell, no!” Sherlock replies. “Much better.”
“I call it a Christmas Memory Tree,” Grandpa Sherlock adds.
“You still want more stories? We can continue them next time.”  John tucks her hair behind one ear.
John is aware of her worries. He has them, too. But he has come to terms with what may be a long time ago. “We can only love and nurture them the best we can,” her father told her during her first pregnancy. “We don’t own their souls and making their own decisions is part of growing up. If, like Eurus, there’s a missing neurological switch-off  mechanism in her brain, as discovered when she died, let’s hope it is identified early on.”
He grins to himself. Who else but Sherlock?
“Who says we can’t? This is Heaven. We’ve earned enough good points to argue our way into visiting Rosie whenever we want. We can love her, comfort her, counsel her—”
He knows the song. In fact, it is one of his favorites.
“I’ll have to beg out, darling,” Torrance says with an apologetic look at his wife. “The Peruvian UN team is requesting a meeting.”
The doctor flushed and lowered his head. He remembered all the troubles their partnership went through, all recreated on TV. And just like in the series, he thought for a long time that his lover did all those things out of brotherly love.
Rochie curves into a ball, peeks out with a smile and says in a muffled voice, "
John is stumped. Why?
He deposits on the table the bag of food Sherlock ordered earlier from Angelo’s. Just for the two of them as Rosie is sleeping over at Mycroft's.  His stomach grumbles. “Sherlock!” he singsongs.
“Mycroft was drunk at the time, too. And, since when have you officially agreed with him on anything? I call that betrayal.” Sherlock sniffs, huffs, then turns on his chair to present a haughty profile to the audience.
“Tea, John?” his friend said. Sherlock was sitting in a padded garden chair around a circular and carved  iron table laden with full afternoon tea. “Assam or Earl Grey?”
She embraced her dad after that. Still, she worries and so, she prays. She suspects her papa worries, too, hence his slight wariness of Torrance. Her husband guesses the reason, but agrees with John.
"I woke up in this very comfortable bed,” the doctor ruminated, chewing slowly. “It did wonders for my body as I felt whole and relaxed. No aching muscles at all. The room has French windows opened to this garden. I wanted to sleep some more, but I remembered you. You weren’t with me—“ he colored. “I meant there was no other bed… I—uh—was worried that something bad might have happened to you. So, I dressed and got out.” He couldn’t look   at his friend. He drank his tea and fished for a scone next.
“That’s almost three months away, and—” he choked, “these are wedding bands!”
“Sure.”
John coughs and blushes furiously.
When her sobs stopped, Rosie asked what the she and the other mourners wanted to know. “Why ‘Forever’, Uncle Mycroft?” Aside from their names and birth and death dates, it was the only text on the tombstone. It, too, was etched and plated in gold.
William’s answer was swift. “As you do mine… I’ll answer that question with another: I know you love me truly. But can you, Shaun, forsake the charms of women and love and desire only me for the rest of your life? Well, mostly me, anyway. The desire part.”  The doctor saw his lover swallow nervously, but his gaze was unflinching.
“John, dear lord…”
The mug of hot chocolate banged on the table.
John quickly opens the door.
“I think it’s time we talked, John.”
John chose a salmon and cream cheese sandwich for his first try. “All I remembered was running after you and Jum--the criminal. We turned into a dark alley, then shots. I thought something hit me. I guess I was wrong. We seem alright."
John chuckles. “And when did you say fuck for the first time?”
“But John remains hopeful. He says he’ll get your brother to church even if they’re in their 90s by that time.”
Sherlock carefully applies the last brushstroke. There! Just right. He knows that John will enjoy the edible body paints he used—they’re in his favorite flavours and made by one of London’s top pastry chefs.
Sherlock leaned halfway back over his chair. He asked the ceiling, "When was the last time you did an audit of Khan's cryo chamber?" Dull to have to follow Mycroft's advice.
That was why he was on his back, because there was no bed except their robes. He wanted the omega to be as comfortable as possible during his heat.
Marymor was standing between the hulking alpha and Vesha. Sherlock's lips curled. She'd been a stupid to think that the first thing the lead alpha wouldn't try and do was end the omegas' pregnancies.
Sestre sighed and very slowly moved towards the smaller creature. The other creature moved closer, but didn't appear threatened. He laid the tricorder down and began the ritual meditation. "Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts."
"Don't sweat it," said Hunter, adjusting some controls. "Plenty of time for them to kick the Cardassians off the base."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock gave him the 'you are the King of Morons' look. "There were no other partners?"
Doctor Imprid had said, "Would that our ancestors had thought to treat the symptoms rather than eliminating the cause."
Cafa called Daimon Lurin. The cousins loudly argued about what to do. Nom thought it was a trick and that they should do nothing. Lurin said, "That is why grandfather left his latinum to me. You don't have the lobes to hear profit in the wind. I will not throw away valuable merchandise."
"Which is how I know you do."
It came free. She flipped it on and jabbed again. There was a sizzle of burned flesh. Acheron fell to the ground dead.
"Well, you are," said John carefully.
She'd carved Victor and William's names instead.
Sherlock allowed a grin to spread across his face. "A privateer. He had a letter of marque from the queen."
"And are you ever going to tell Mummy who your parents are? Tell us anything about you?" asked Connor. "Why are you in Breen armor? Where would you get Breen ships? I've been studying them in school and they're a nasty race. They don't help anyone. Why would they help you?"
Yellowbeard struggled to get air inside him. He needed air.
"Not goin' walk off all by its lonesome," said Gremel. "Never met a piece a tech that did that." His heart rate was up, but that could have meant anything. She wished Mycroft were there to get a read on his manner. She wished she was back in a lab quietly working on scientific matters.
His chest heaved at the sudden action. The clarity of adrenaline. His action catching up with his thoughts. Blood warm and sticky on his skin. He thought, "I've been strong and fast all along."
Therefore, he was unprepared when he walked into the holodeck onto a stage in an auditorium. Behind him on the wall was a monitor displaying his monograph on Vacuuvita forms with his particular observations on Gontuu.
"I'm not an idiot," escaped her mouth. She clapped her hand over her lips to hold back the words that had already jumped out.
John said, "Show me how to use the device." The bowl felt strange on his head. Prickly. Stranger was the knowledge flooding into him. Everything seemed brighter. Bolder. He knew what he needed to do. He also knew he had three hours to complete the operation or he'd forget, and once started, he needed to finish. Fortunately, he also didn't need to do it alone.
Sherlock stopped looking for the signature quantum waves. He climbed up to where John was, pretending that his Augmentation wouldn't allow him to simply jump up to where John was. He looked inside the chamber.
The younger kids flinched. The royal court stared stolidly at the ground.
There was a roar in the ears. A rumble louder than any starship engine, which earned him another kiss.
His resistance was – as the Borg might say – futile. In as much as it took the form of stretching himself with this or that toy that was conveniently in his bed stand. In that it took the form of stroking John's chest until his breathing shifted to indicate that first sleep had ended.
Sherlock perhaps shouldn't have laughed, but really, it was ridiculous.
"True. Juvenile heats. Depression. Odor sensitivity." She looked at the image of the planet and the birds of prey. All of them orbiting in space. "Sometimes I wish I hadn't given into pressure and had kept up my vivo biology studies instead of going into botany. I want to know more about… me. My daughter. My mother. Why we present certain Augmentation traits and why we sometimes don't."
John kept his hand in Sherlock's the entire way out of the time distortion field given off by the Guardian to the nearest safe place for transport.
Redbeard's hands were around his throat. Yellowbeard couldn't breathe. He could hold his breath a long time, but not forever. His hands flailed trying to peel Redbeard's fingers away, but they were cold like iron. All sorts of ways to break free flashed through his mind, but he'd have to hurt Redbeard.
John blinked awake, face mashed into the floor. "Ngh. Not much better the second time." He pushed himself up. Didn't have time to feel embarrassed about…everything.
Sherlock had waved off the invite as his late morning into the evening were fully scheduled with meetings where he'd get to show off how brilliant he was.
"Of course. I can take you to see Warden Barrymore," said Mr. Styx, who had what Sally considered to be too wide and white a smile for someone working security.
John wasn't certain what she thought he could do about. Sherlock never listened when someone told him no. But he gave it his best.
Sherlock set it to blow and sprinted down the tunnel towards the mine entrance. Even he wasn't fast enough to out race the blast, which lifted him off his feet and carried him down the tunnel.
"No, but they don't know that," said Lucy. She wanted to turn on the ship's force fields, but she had no way of knowing how things were going for John and Hudson. She sat down gingerly in the command couch to wait, feeling like an imposter.
"There you see. Starfleet."
Sherlock would find a way to fix this.
Sherlock would gladly spend the rest of his life in a body not his own if it meant finding John. For that matter, Hudson, Billy, and Connor were part of his crew. Part of his life on the Bakerstreet.
"Ms. Hudson and Doctor Watson will be going as well. The largest and oldest colony of Augments is on Beta Aurigae. There are more Augments living there than anywhere other than on Earth."
Hobb chuckled nervously, glanced at her and the Breen standing silently behind her. "No need to bring up old stories."
Ginger Sparkles rolled her eyes, while Brown Sparkles muttered, "He's a kid."
"Yeah, there'll be a first time." Then since John was about to say the most hated words in any relationship, that they needed to talk, he put the collar on Sherlock's neck. Stretched out his neck to have Sherlock do the same.
"Yeah, there's our captain," said Donovan. "Not well. Dick in your body has us scanning and rescanning the wreckage."
"Grandfather?" said Billy, standing stock still. "But… you're… you… how?"
"What?" Odo glared at him as if he hadn't been boring a hole through Sherlock's background for days.
He looked young. A child. A teenager, true. Little more than a child then. He hadn't looked at him for long before. Intent on himself. It was surprising now to think Mycroft ever had been a child, but the evidence was there before him.
"Plot a course," said Sherlock.
That seemed to settle the argument. Hudson came over and pressed a cold cloth to his forehead. "A little warning would have been nice before you attempted this ploy." She slipped him the smallest of the children's tricorder. The one with the low level scanner. He hid it in the sock of his right trainer. It was the only place he had. He was wearing a robe, socks and trainers. Because of course his body's timing was fucked like that.
The Ferengi doctor grumbled at having to treat a human. He operating the biobed grudgingly. He tapped the monitor. He glared at Tevek. He glared at the monitor. "This is not a juvenile. It should be with the other adult omegas."
John snorted, because that was just typical. While Brittanus wouldn't be solving any problems other than decomposition, the Khans had quite spectacularly resolved the Breen's central problem by out sourcing the solution to Earth's Augments and then just as spectacularly failed to admit what that solution meant.
John squeezed Sherlock's hand. Neither of them mentioned Victor, the brother Sherlock didn't remember. John wondered if Chin knew about all of this. If Billy now knew, but it wasn't the time for that.
"But what does that…" John stopped as an idea took shape, because he was actually a doctor. "You think if we had such a person," and he thanked whatever impulse had had Hudson get Billy and Connor off the ship, "that you could use their DNA to cross check with the DNA of the remains in the cryo chambers. That if it wasn't at least a twenty-five percent match, you could prove Khan was still out there." Why Killander wanted to focus on the crazy theory rather than someone had gotten angry and irradiated the sleeping bastards, John didn't know.
"You're their kidnappers," said Connor with the absolute moral conviction of a fourteen year old. "Of course, they don't think of you as family. Mum and I are the only ones that are closely related. Everyone else is," he shrugged, "like Doctor Watson."
"Fifty of your Earth years," said figure with yellow piping along the edges of the armored plates. Other figures were green or blue. No figure’s colors were repeated.
While they had been running away from people under the control of the artificial intelligence, Captain Sisko had mined the entrance to the wormhole to the Gamma quadrant to prevent Dominion ships traveling through said wormhole.
When his mate pulled out, a flood of cum dripped down John's thighs. John felt wonderful. Knew he had chosen the best, most wonderful mate.
"Mum," said Connor. "What's happening?"
Sherlock watched John walk like a ghost through the ship.
Unless he admitted to certain things.
John hummed. His worry about facing Harry shifting into a resolve to ask Harry about what was going on at Tantalus and if Frankland was as off as he appeared.
"What?"
Not that they accomplished this entirely on their own.
That night in their own nest, Sherlock, smelling of sharp soap, clung to John and all the next day offered him treats of dried meat and fruit from the stores. John nuzzled his mate to let him know that he understood. John was worried about losing the babies too.
John got his first look at the unprepared alphas a few days after they arrived. He heard Vesha scream, and went running. An emaciated snarling creature in the ragged remnants of clothing was attempting to thrust between his legs with their half hard cock. They snapped their teeth at John, wild eyed and unresponsive to words, but ran when they heard Toby's growl and saw a larger group coming.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nope, this is science," said Mollyhoo, crossing her arms. "Sexy, sexy science."
Sestre and the other children were instructed to play on the other side of the room. As if Sestre and Conner were little kids. Sestre wanted to be a part of the discussions. To share his observations. He and Connor should not be grouped in with the little ones.
"You know what, you're right." Her lips turned down. "I am not going to have this conversation with you right now. I'm tired of telling you the same thing over and over. I'm going to go have my grandmother tell me that I got what's coming to me for going into space and then watch her spoil Eva. When you figure out what you want to do, call me." Lucy cut off the monitor.
That was not his greatest concern. He turned all 10,346 cameras to one purpose.
Sestre drew in a breath at something he saw in the tricorder. Something about the round rock. Something about the creature.
