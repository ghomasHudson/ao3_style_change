“Willa Louise Watson you will be getting no farm animals for your birthday.” John snapped finally harsher than he usually would have, no doubt the headache was fraying on his nerves.
Unfortunately, the excitement near the front of the building seemed to have scared everyone off. Sherlock quickly wracked his brain trying to decide where everyone might have gone.
Willa turned around just in time to see Sherlock go to open the box. “Those are daddy’s other ones, he puts them up after I go to bed.”
The rest of the autumn passed quickly and almost normally. Willa hated homework with a passion but her marks were all above average, she made friends and got in petty feuds, and there was an entire month where she didn’t go a day without some sort of cold symptom.
An hour after they arrived Lestrade stood and walked to Mycroft talking to him in a low voice that Sherlock didn’t even both to try and listen in on. Mycroft said little back and stayed at the wall. After five more minutes Greg went over to Molly and asked her if she needed anything. He asked Sherlock and John the same question. Sherlock said no and John didn’t seem to have heard him.
“I was naked less than a minute ago.” Sherlock reminded him even as he continued to button his shirt.
“I was alone so often as a child. Even when there were people around, I always felt so… alone.” Sherlock murmured, it didn’t appear he was speaking to John anymore.  “As an adult, too.”
“I’ll get them for you anyway.” Sherlock insisted because while John believed him he felt the need to prove it. “Also, I’m not a virgin”
The kisses could all be described as chaste, Sherlock had yet to learn what John’s tongue tasted like. Despite his desire to learn everything there was to know there was no real passion in the kisses, they were just stolen moments to reassure each other. Sherlock could feel it though in John and knew how John the lover functioned. God help him when (when, Sherlock was determined, when) it was unleashed. While Sherlock had single minded determination, John was full of all-consuming heat.
Sherlock sighed and threw his hands up. “I had told you it would be.” He disappeared into the kitchen in a huff.
Willa drank down the entire cup of water without noticing it and the woman took it away with a soft smile.
Willa chewed on her lip and glanced between Mycroft and her things on the ground. Obviously torn between the prospect of a present and continuing her experiment. “Alright.” She said eventually and held out her hand for Mycroft to take.
She jumped up suddenly, her own gift forgotten, and threw herself at him. She wrapped her arms around his waist in a hug and buried her face in his chest. “Do you really like it?” She asked muffled by his clothes.
“Is he really mine to keep?” Willa asked as Sherlock showed her how to measure out the dry cat food.
He was approached upon returning to Afghanistan by men who wore very expensive suits and looked like they’d never even touched a gun, let alone fired one. They were pulling together a team, they told him. A small handpicked group of men from the various armies to be commanded by Colonel Sebastian Moran. They didn’t have to say anything more to convince Cole, as soon as he’d heard about Colonel Moran he was in all the way. Moran was a legendary sniper who was rumored to have never missed a single shot, even while in training.
He was even more confused when he saw Mycroft standing with his face twisted into a grimace. Sherlock was
Cole turned his head to look at them. “You don’t give me problems, kid, and I won’t give you any.” He spoke like a tourist.
This chapter was terrible to write. This is the fourth (?) version. Also I'd like to thank BBC for giving me inspiration for something. :)
It took significantly more coaxing than usual but John managed to convince Willa into staying with Mrs. Hudson so he could accompany Sherlock.
He and John, they’d been doing so well since Sherrinford. 221B was repaired, John was back, and Rosie was providing to be an unexpected ray of sunshine in Sherlock’s life. They’d finally begun moving forward and were currently standing on the threshold of something they’d been working towards since they met.
Sherlock found himself wasting time even after John had gathered up the whiskey and sat in his chair.
On Sunday, which was actually Valentine’s Day, they had a romantic lunch instead of dinner. They still had to pick up Willa that night and return to the real world tomorrow.
John, apparently oblivious to Sherlock’s inner struggle, continued. “Sherlock, this is Luke and Hayley Cooper.”
John held tight to Sherlock’s hips and then tilted his own. Sherlock didn’t need to look back to see he’d planted his heels into the bed. The first thrust from John was a direct hit to his prostate and Sherlock cried out loudly and without dignity.
Mycroft gagged around the food he was eating and had to swallow it down with some of his water. Sherlock kissed Willa’s cheek as he set her down for unknowingly causing her uncle great discomfort.
“Sir, one of the witnesses gave this to me.” A young DS called over to him, she had a mobile phone held in her outstretched hand.
There was a little intake of breath when Sherlock saw the contents that told John he’d picked up on the meanings. After a minute of silence John finally got the nerve to look up. He found Sherlock holding the little violin gingerly between his fingers, just staring at it.
Sherlock and John are certainly protagonists and generally are good men but neither of them are morally innocent. I will never portray them as all light and goodness because they aren't both of them have dark areas.
John went up the stairs ahead of Sherlock. Willa was standing in front of the fire place while Harry took pictures of her, she was looking bored.
“No, I’m good.” John looked down at where Sherlock had begun lightly rubbing circles into the pressure point with his thumb.
Dinner was pleasant and Angelo fussed over them. It was hard to tell if Angelo knew what was going on, he was always over attentive to them. He loved Willa even more than Sherlock or John and no matter what she ordered there was always something special added on to the plate just to please her.
“At the bottom of the stairs leading to my work area. There’s another door to keep him out of the actual flat so we can put a cat door up top.”
John stepped into Mycroft’s space, ignoring the way Greg shifted uncomfortably beside him and the way Mycroft determinedly would not be cowed. “Are you sure? Because this is my sister and I know she’s got issues but I’m not about to go in there-”
Sherlock was stripped down to his shirt, sleeves rolled up and he was bouncing from surface to surface with his magnifying glass. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to his movement but Greg new better than to question him and doing so right now might end with John finally snapping. He could see the shadow of the hand gun John owned under his sweater. Greg wasn’t
“Alright Willa it’s time to leave, Marie your mother said you could go back in with your brother.” John told the girls and started pulling Willa towards him.
Sherlock snapped the magnifier shut. “There are light scuffs on the stalls, not from regular soles but from the foam sandals she was wearing.” He explained and pointed to what appeared to be a random spot on the cubical door. “Smeared hand print here.” He pointed to the divider. “She reached out at one point to try and pull herself away.”
Instead he swept low into a bow and everyone applauded lively. When he straightened, Willa lunged off the couch at his legs.
She already knew most of the details of the cases from reading the blog a great number of things most people wouldn’t have told a six-year-old. John tactfully edited things out that he felt he needed to. It didn’t escape Sherlock’s notice that all of the sites were from their first few major cases, none from the year he jumped or when John and Mary were together.
Sherlock was forced to clamp down on the desire to grin and preen when John praised him. It wouldn’t look appropriate, not now.
There was a tug, she had assumed Janine had shrugged. “I dunno, but it’s better than leaving her like she was,” she said from above her.
Okay, why have I been gone for two years? Lots of reasons but in all honesty the creation and birth of this chapter has taken the entire two years. I come back to it, edit it and write a little more. I have most of this story plotted out in little blurbs inside a notebook so its really just the writing that's slowing me down.
Mr. West shifted the cupcakes so he could extend a hand. “Mr. Holmes it is a pleasure to meet you. Willa has mentioned you.”
So, uhm remember when I said this was gunna be a lot darker? Yeah, well boy do I have a treat for ya'll. Seriously, there's some graphic description of some very very very bad stuff in this chapter. I make up for mildly horrific content with WORDS, SO MANY WORDS.
If Willa was enraptured, then Sherlock was absolutely captivated by the pair of them. He spent most of the time alternating between watching them and scrolling through his phone.
John looked up at Sherlock who very reluctantly nodded and stepped aside. “Yes, she’s in the living room.”
John rearranged Willa on his chest and reached out for the top file. Surveillance photos: all taken with a long-range lens, all of Mary. Mary leaving their house, Mary taking a cab to a nondescript apartment building in the middle of London, Mary through a window looking over papers, Mary looking determined as she walked through a crowded street with her head down.
John gingerly hugged Willa and kissed her forehead before leaning up and kissing Sherlock. Sherlock could see his pulse throbbing in his neck.
John would have swallowed his tongue if it were possible. He whirled around to look at her. She sat in the middle of the unmade bed, a picture of innocence.
It wasn't just the foreign bed or the constant parade of people in her room that were keeping her awake. It was the guilt too. Gnawing away at her insides to the point she didn't know if she was nauseous from the concussion or the guilt.
Sherlock hoped he hadn’t gotten drunk at the pub, it would be difficult to deal with that from all the way in London.
“Alright you, go change. You’re having something healthy for snack.” John warned Willa as he walked into the living room waving his hands at her.
“It looks like Harriet Watson has been relaying information regarding Willa to someone for the past five years,” Mycroft said as he straightened up, his anger returning.
Thanks to everyone who said such nice things on the last chapter. I really am my worst critic to the point that basically nothing looks the same as it started.
She was dead immediately. He was a terrible person, evil probably, but he’d been efficient and precise. She hadn’t felt a thing besides fear. As he lowered her onto the ground he’d felt compelled to correct the awkward angle of her head, not that anyone would know once he’d finished with the rest of his task.
Sunday evening, after John had wrestled Willa out of the bathtub and into pajamas, Sherlock looked up at them and asked. “Can I take her up tonight?”
“You are safe here.” Mycroft assured. “When we have captured her or confirmed she has fled the country you will be able to return to London.”
Mr. West looked to John and relaxed. “Oh you’ve got a meeting with Doctor Drescher? Is everything alright?”
Harry had been filling someone in about Willa’s life since the very first time John had allowed her to come visit them. There was suddenly no more room for doubt in Mycroft’s mind as to Harriet Watson’s involvement. He was also very sure who the person she’d been texting was.
Sherlock took one look at the amount of flour required for the recipe and remembered the pizza dough incident. Thinking ahead he tied back Willa’s hair and put it up under a hat, this time John would no doubt make him scrub the flour from her hair.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at Mycroft’s warning, his heart sinking further. He’d known when his brother first came in that the news wasn’t great, or at least it wasn’t the new Sherlock was looking for. Mycroft would undoubtedly have come in gloating if he’d found substantial evidence of Willa’s whereabouts, he would have been positively insufferable if he’d already located her.
Most people don’t realize that even though the heart had stopped beating that blow will flow freely from the body, especially immediately after death.
“Hadeon Wolanski is dead.” Mycroft told him and handed over a photo of the man slumped on the floor in a cell somewhere. There was a blue cloth tied around his neck and to one of the bars overhead.
Sherlock slid to the floor and was rooting through the box of ornaments. He was taking one out, examining it before placing it on the floor in front of him. John wondered what he was learning from each new ornament. Willa’s reflected her changing interests as she grew from Minnie Mouse her second Christmas to last year’s ballerina. John’s were simply random ones that had made him smile like a fat round Santa to the tea cup Willa had seen and insisted he needed.
“Sherlock, stop.” John said and placed a single hand on his chest. It was enough to keep Sherlock from moving forward.
“Hold on I thought you were dead.” Lestrade said suddenly as if finally connecting her to who she was.
John turned around just in time to see Sherlock wink at her in the rearview mirror. He threw up his hands. “Oh you’ve brought my daughter in on this?”
"What have you done?" Harry hissed only to realize her hand had risen to cover her mouth in an attempt to calm her breathing.
“Always, mate,” Lestrade said and started moving towards the door once Mycroft had gathered himself to rise.
“You’ve made a mistake though, you’re the first connection we have to finding her and we will never let you go.” John told him and slammed his palm into the break before releasing the man.
“No. I was reminding you of the option other than letting me go out on a simple meeting without you.” Sherlock said.
“You… back then? I mean I wondered a little when you used to interrupt every one of my dates but I never… back then?” John stuttered out.
He was only a little surprised when the cab let them out at a lovely park. Whatever John’s secret was, he was doing a terrific job in keeping its nature from Sherlock.
There was a distinct lack of police even though the DI who had taken their statements had instructed them to go home and wait, that someone would be around to check on them shortly. John wondered how much of the absence of police was from Greg and Mycroft’s involvement and how much of it was because Sherlock had effectively screamed at the entire force about their incompetence. He sincerely hoped it was the former.
When he sensed John looking he smirked and reached up to push his head back down towards the mattress.
I'm working on Chapter 16 now. Per usual it's entirely possible The Lying Detective will ruin me for the next day or so.
Isabelle Durant was based closely of of Isadora Duncan who accidentally hung herself with her giant scarf in the spokes of an automobile. The rotating closet was because my parents just installed them at their house and I was like "someone is gunna die from that"
“She’s who you’ve been texting all this time.” It wasn’t a question, nothing John had to answer. Sherlock had figured out it was Irene from the moment she stepped into their flat looking smugger than the cat that ate the canary.
It’s not that he hadn’t learned anything, he had. He’d learned that they got together at least once a year for lunch and catching up. He’d learned he was right, Luke did serve under John and when he was telling a story about their shared past he referred to John as Captain Watson. He’d learned that John unconsciously straightened his back every single time he was called Captain Watson. But what he hadn’t learned was what any of this had to do with the secret John had told him about.
It didn’t honestly bother Mycroft, their little jokes, instead he was pleased that Sherlock was finally experiencing a sense of comradery that he’d never gotten to as a child. Besides, if he’d ever really gotten fed up with them John was an easy enough man to remove. A man with a military career and several dealings with MI6.
That ‘mission’ was how he’d ended up in London kidnapping a child with a psychotic bitch. Not that anything was ever such a straight line, that meeting with Moran had been over a decade ago but it had put his feet onto this path. There was probably more blood on his hands now than there had been during his entire military career. There was blood there that he’d never expected to have and for the first time in a very, very, long time he was uncomfortable with what he’d done.
“John, tread lightly you’ll contaminate the evidence.” Sherlock’s voice warned just as John stepped into the woman’s restroom.
Greg shrugged. “Could be,” he offered, “an intentional fire set to an empty room in an abandoned building.”
“I… don’t know.” Sherlock admitted to his knees. Teddy had been…not unpleasant but when John had mentioned Willa had been smaller he found himself imagining how it would be with a child of his own.
“Jesus we’re idiots.” John muttered. “Alright. Last three things. One: I will not magically become a doormat because we’re dating. I will still get pissed at you when you run off with my gun or when you buy Willa a kitten without asking me first.”
There was a noise in his ear a few seconds (minutes?) later and Sherlock realized John was laying on him whispering in his ear.
“Indeed I am.” Mycroft agreed. “Sherlock, felt I had reason to assist him in locating the poisoner.”
Sherlock scowled and turned back around, sour that his brother had reasonably thwarted his attempts to pick a fight. John, growing impatient, reached around him to open the first photo. Sherlock was distracted, just for a moment, by the bandage still wrapped around John’s hand. It was still perfectly tight and the bleeding had stopped, there really was no reason for him to be as distracted by it as he was.
This only served to spur John on. He was relentlessly driving himself into Sherlock until he was clinging to John’s shoulders crying out with every thrust.
John looked up at him in surprise. “Sherlock they’ve been circling like vultures since you got back to London. Did you not know that?”
*I'm currently plugging through chapter 10 and if I finish it before tonight I'll save it for tomorrow. The premier will either A) short circuit my brain and make me unable to write for at least 24 or B) inspire me to write out of sheer anger/joy/some emotion.
Mycroft reached out for Gregory before he got to him. Gregory pulled him into a fierce kiss before moving away just as abruptly and then jogging back out of the library.
As they drove John opened his phone and went into his conversations. There were three messages he’d ignored when he turned on his phone, Willa and Harry had only just gone to the bathroom and the messages hadn’t seemed urgent at the time.
John shrugged and crossed his arms over his chest the way he always used to when someone, mainly Sherlock, would insult his blog. “She likes them.”
John turned to wrap his arms around Sherlock and buried his face in his chest. They stood there like that for a while until finally John pushed him away to resume changing.
Of all of the options about what their secret had been, this possibility had never even entered his mind. He never even let himself consider this at all, ever. Never tried to imagine himself as someone’s actual father, as their
All the anger she’d been feeling since they’d told her she was on paperwork duty left. “Is it…?” She couldn’t even finish the question properly.
“If you wish to go with Gregory, I will finish taking Miss Watson’s statement,” Mycroft volunteered in an uncharacteristically helpful way. Greg narrowed his eyes at his husband but didn’t say anything.
"I'm trusting you to act like a big girl," she warned, "if you scream or cry when we go outside I will shoot you. Do you understand?" As she said this she pulled open the purse she was carrying and in it Willa could see a tiny silver handgun.
That got Sherlock to sigh and hold out his arms. John gently placed the baby into them and Sherlock on instinct drew the boy up to his chest.
Sherlock stood and gave John a once over. “I guess John can come to.” His said sounding bored, but his eyes were playful.
“Who do you work for?” Sherlock asked stepping forward, he was holding something in his hands in front of him.
A very pedestrian tragedy that some might have deemed a worthwhile story, but one Mycroft found tedious. Though he wondered if that dullness had caused him to overlook something.
There are also many places a parent (and face it at this point Sherlock is a parent as well as John) will go in defense of their child.
The room was dark but John could see the other man hadn’t moved much except to possibly burrow further into the bedding. He stood in the doorway and cleared his throat. “Sherlock.”
“Thank you.” She said as she reached up and patted his cheek. “Where’s Sherlock? You’ll both be needing some strong tea.”
She frowned as she climbed the steps, there were three voices coming from above. One John, one Sherlock and the other she didn’t recognize but it was another man. It was far too late for 221B to be entertaining visitors, even those of the client variety. She’d heard that since the introduction of the little princess into their detective agency that they were entertaining those guests down stairs. She wondered what John was possibly up to.
Sherlock was at first surprised at the contact but then wrapped one arm around John’s shoulders. “You’ve just spent six years in exile for me, before that you were dead for two years for me, and now you’re offering to protect my daughter. I don’t know how you ever believed you were a sociopath.” John said unsteadily and still he didn’t move.
Louise was Mary’s contribution and John didn’t bother to ask where it came from, he found he didn’t care.
He didn’t really have anywhere to go but he later found himself outside of the New Scotland Yard building. Lestrade’s office was in the same place though he didn’t recognize many of the faces as he walked through the building, what’s more no one seemed to recognize him.
Sherlock watched her and found he didn’t mind Christmas so much this year. He doubted he would ever love the holiday the way some people did but this year, with Willa and John safe and happy, it wasn’t so bad. The thought of his brother’s dinner loomed over his head threatening to break their tiny bubble of happiness.
There wasn’t much to look at though. Parts of the ceiling had come down in the room and there was water damage everywhere. The only feature in the room that might have been worth anything was the mattress but that had been burnt so severely all that remained were the metal coils sticking up.
“Sherlock and John,” She looked up after a moment realizing that there was no way either of men would just stay home if they’d realized the body of a little girl had been found.
caused this. She bit on her lip to keep the confession inside. John would murder her if he found out regardless of the fact that right up until tonight it had all been innocent. He wouldn’t see it that way, all he would see was the betrayal and he would kill her. She wasn’t joking and she didn’t think that Sherlock would do anything to stop him, in fact he might help.
John felt a thrill at the idea. He flicked his tongue out over Sherlock’s nipple, he hissed in response back arching up towards him. John did it again and Sherlock moaned, his hands stilling right above John’s hips. John turned his attention to his other nipple and was rewarded with more moans and soft rolls of the hip.
It had taken a year of sobriety before Mycroft caved and began placing money in the account again. By that point it didn’t matter much, Sherlock had found his own means. It was easy to take money from the organizations he brought down. By the time they realized he was embezzling, if they ever did, he was usually ready to destroy them.
John stood up quickly and used the advantage of surprise to whirl Sherlock around and push him back onto the bed. He already looked like pure sin spread out on the sheets, John was going to have a hell of a time keeping sane this weekend. “Two can play this game, Mr. Holmes.” He warned and leaned over the other man.
Her face may still have been the same but in the dark bathroom, she looked like a totally different little girl.
Mycroft gave as good as he got and they ended up nearly dueling one another. It was very reminiscent of their childhood spats while practicing their instruments. Even David, whom Sherlock had not seen give any interest to the evening, took of his headphones and sat up. Sherlock continued the escalation until it was so ridiculous everyone was laughing.
John raised an eyebrow. His singular complaint during the tour of the school had been that in the expansion of the art rooms the music rooms had been marginalized. He had thought Sherlock would have been displeased with the idea of Willa attending somewhere without a decent music program.
“I… what? What about my case? I didn’t do it.” Erik protested and stood as well, this drew in the attention of a guard.
“Anything.” Sherlock said before he’d even thought of it. He realized then that he would give anything to John.
John fully grasped the situation now and laughed. “Oh my god, you’ve been giving her local honey for her allergies.”
Seriously. My editing technique involves forcing the automated Microsoft voice to read me back my works. Making Microsoft Sam (look I know it's not called that anymore but it'll always be Sam) say words like 'fuck' and 'cock' is both the highlight and lowlight of my day.
Greg closed the bag and handed it behind him. Evidently, he’d been elected the one to deal with them exclusively. A new bag appeared in his hand and he took a step towards Sherlock, “Sherlock.”
“Hello John.” Sherlock said. Anyone else might not have notice the way Sherlock’s voice broke just slightly on his name but John did.
John then proceeded to tease Sherlock, taking him to the edge over and over only to draw back and ask inane questions, for nearly thirty minutes before finally letting him come.
Sherlock smiled at John’s text. He’d been increasingly chatty all day and a small part of Sherlock’s brain was wondering if he’d be able to talk John into phone sex tonight. Or hell, even a mutual wank over video chat.
Ignoring all the warning signs that said 'go away,' Greg stepped behind Mycroft's chair. The back was low enough he was able to put his hands on his husband's shoulders and begin rubbing them in a futile effort to relieve him of some of the tension.
Sherlock’s arms wrapped around his back pinning him into the kiss. “Make up for it then.” He said when he finally loosened his grip a little. John noticed his right hand had begun tracing the ancient scar on his shoulder.
"Surveillance report on your brother, sir," she said, holding out a single piece of paper towards Mycroft.
“Gregory and I have the children next weekend. We would love to have Willa over.” Mycroft said and it sounded like someone was forcing the words from his throat.
John was debating what to wear, Sherlock was showering, when Willa came into the bedroom that afternoon. She had a look on her face like she wanted to talk.
“John.” Sherlock interrupted unable to sit through anymore of the babbling, Mycroft was visably relieved not to have to listen to it as well. John’s mouth audibly snapped shut.
He took his time, watching as everyone began to fall in place and get back to their jobs. To most of these people Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were legends they’d heard about since they were too young to even be on the force. Everyone was having difficulty knowing exactly how to handle a situation in which these men weren’t legends but instead distraught parents who’s coping mechanisms were always shit.
As Willa came out of the bathroom, gave Sherlock a little nod of approval, John realized that Sherlock had been watching him the whole time with a guarded expression. John tried to smile reassuringly at him but Sherlock didn’t return the smile.
Sherlock leaned forward and pressed his face into the still dark curls around the base and inhaled. It was pure John and he nuzzled in further, cheek brushing against his cock. He turned his head after a moment and ran his tongue up the side.
I deviated slightly from my normal writing for this chapter because the Mary conversation NEEDED to be in Sherlock's POV.
“Don’t.” Sherlock said softly, fingers digging into his hips. “If you must, I’ll let you feel guilty later but not now.”
“He started throwing up and his sugar was getting so high. I gave him another bolus while I called 999.” Erik explained and tears were running silently down his face. “I had Lydia too so I couldn’t ride with him. When we got to the hospital he was already unconscious. When he… died, the doctors told me it was from the hypoglycemia. I didn’t even know about the nicotine until after Emma showed up.”
“What about not wanting your gun around Willa? It’s practically become a part of you.” Sherlock continued, not caring how irritated he made John now. Worst case scenario was he would get angry and ask Sherlock to stay home, not exactly the worst thing in the world.
Once back in his own office, no word of news from anyone else, the lure of sleep had claimed him. It was rare Mycroft honestly went this long without sleep, even on his busiest nights he was usually able to catch an hour here and there. Falling asleep felt like admitting defeat like he was throwing up his hands and saying he couldn’t find Willa so he might as well nap. Logically he understood it didn’t make sense, but he couldn’t change the way he felt, no matter how hard he tried.
John hadn’t realized he’d been thinking for so long. “Sorry. I just have trouble disassociating from children.”
Realizing that he hadn’t actually moved into the building any further than the entrance Mycroft shook his head, placing the now melancholic thoughts where they belonged.
John couldn’t answer, not right now. He couldn’t look Sherlock in the face and hold onto the tattered remnants of his composure. He’d promised himself that there’d be no more break downs. No more panicking. He needed to keep it together for Willa because falling apart would do her absolutely no good. It certainly wouldn’t get her home any sooner, likely distracting Sherlock from being able to see that one vital clue that they all knew was out there, somewhere.
John shook his head. “Not seriously. He was diabetic, Willa was fascinated by his insulin pump for a while.”
Willa’s entire body felt like she was under water. She wanted to scream but her body wasn’t listening again. The whole world spun when the man took her from the woman. He carried her the way Papa did sometimes when she was tired, with her legs around his waist and her head on his shoulder.
He went back to work three weeks after Willa was born, simply because he needed to get out of that house. There were moments, days even, when everything was nearly perfect. John could look at Mary and remember who he fell in love with. Most of the time though Mary would speak and it took every ounce of John’s willpower not to scream at her to shut up. There were evenings when he couldn’t take it any longer and he would bundle up Willa, wrestle her into that damn pram and then leave on a walk.
gunshot wound with his lips next and covered it with kisses, like he could heal a six year-old wound.
“No, never.” Sherlock changed course now and was kissing along John’s jaw. John couldn’t help the sigh that escaped when he reached his neck, his head fell back giving Sherlock more room, fingers tangling in the dark hair.
Sherlock’s lungs fluttered and he fought to keep himself from hyperventilating again. Mycroft was climbing out of the car, leaving room for Sherlock to follow. Once his legs remembered how to work he did.
“Oh you don’t know?” She asked in mock surprise, one hand coming up to rest over her heart. “Oh John, I’m hurt, you haven’t told him?”
“Wear your black jeans.” Willa announced. She’d found one of John’s books on the bedside table and had it open. It was Tom Clancy’s ‘Against All Enemies’. John wasn’t sure if he should take it from her.
“New Years Eve.” He reminded, watching as Willa managed to extract something from the game without setting off the buzzer
Back in what was a living room, Sherlock had pulled Willa from one of the chairs to the door that had once lead  into the bedroom.
Willa was curled up on one of the chairs in the office when he got there, she looked absolutely miserable. She wasn’t warm to the touch but flinched when he spoke. He lowered his voice to carry out his conversation with the secretary.
John leaned back on the door, takin in the room with interest, and realized the door was unusually heavy. A fire door. Upon further inspection there was a sprinkler system embedded in the ceiling.
When John came out fifteen minutes later Sherlock was pushing the last of the pins into her hair. “Go look.” He instructed.
“Quite. I assumed it would rather appeal to your humors.” Mycroft said. It apparently did because Sherlock ate without further complaint.
Willa was eating toast before school when he noticed it. “You’ve been eating honey on toast every morning. Is that your new favorite?” He asked absently when he walked out to find her at the table.
“Mary,” Harry clarified. “She called me just after Willa’s first birthday. She said she’d tried to reach out to you, but you wouldn’t have any of it. That you wouldn't even speak to her. She said all she wanted was to know how she was doing and maybe a picture when I had it.”
Sherlock peeked his head into the bedroom and then promptly turned and bolted up the stairs. John had no idea what Sherlock was up to.
After lunch, and after the girls and David had raided their piles of chocolates, Mycroft led them towards the front of the building. He had a spring in his step that amused John to no end but had Sherlock rolling his eyes.
When Willa was three months old John began to worry about Mary. There was a certain lack of emotion between Mary and Willa that was slowly becoming more evident as the baby grew. Mary wasn’t neglectful or even a bad parent as Willa was always content, clean and fed when he got home from the surgery. He noticed Willa never seemed to smile up at Mary whereas the moment her tiny blue eyes spotted John she would break into the widest gummy smile. Mary seemed almost apathetic towards the whole thing, towards them. She often left for ‘alone time’ as soon as John got home, never asked to come along with them on their walks and if John was home she never went out of her way to feed or cuddle the baby. John worried about postpartum depression.
“Wait, Janine?” Harry asked suddenly realizing where she’d seen the photos before. “Oh my god.” She glared at Sherlock. “From the papers. You’re bloody ex?” She yelled at him.
, got the chance to nip at the pale expanse of flesh. When he did Sherlock rocked his hips up into his.
Soooo proof that my computer is out to get me. My writing music is sound tracks. Avengers, Torchwood, Harry Potter, Sherlock, etc.
She then leaned forward, hands coming to rest on Sherlock’s shoulders. It was a rather obvious display of dominance and they all knew it. John knew better than to let her goad him, and yet it was working exactly as she hoped.
They agreed to the idea after a bit more coaxing. John had reassured Molly that after a decent nap they would be able to tag team the whole sleep schedule.
He wasn’t worried about what Willa would say. She’d tell everyone and anyone who listened how excited she was that Sherlock was going to legally become her Papa. He just didn’t think it was appropriate for Harry to be seriously second guessing the decisions he made as a parent.
Sherlock brushed against him as he came into the room and went around John so he could sit at the foot of the bed. Harry suddenly couldn’t decide which one of them to watch so her eyes began flickering back and forth between them rapidly.
The mirror was broken, glass splintering up to the top with bits missing to reveal the black parts beneath. The lights in the bathroom didn’t work, nor did any of the other lights in the building, at least that she’d noticed. In the other room they were using a small generator to power the few works lamps scattered about. She’d shut the door but a faint light was still spilling in from the space beneath it and some from the street lamps, filtered through the filthy window.
He hadn’t wanted to do it. He really had tried to talk sense into Janine, telling her that killing the girl was one thing but desecrating the corpse was somehow worse. It was disgusting. But Janine, so unfailing in her loyalty to Angie, had never once questioned her judgment. She spoke about her the way Catholics spoke of the Virgin Mary.
This time though, when he would give anything to be blissfully unaware of the time, he was able to count down every passing second.
“Mrs. Hudson is home this weekend. I wouldn’t have been able to make you scream.” Sherlock said and his voice was suddenly dark and dirty. It went straight to John’s cock and he groaned.
Mycroft couldn’t imagine Harriet Watson being the one to receive a ransom call for Willa and even if she did it was unlikely that she’d forget to inform anyone else about it. If this wasn’t just some innocent call and an injured woman, which he was slowly beginning to doubt was a possibility, then she was certainly involved in Willa’s disappearance. Mycroft just wasn’t entirely sure how she’d fit into the entire thing.
Sherlock was a bit away speaking to an older man with a rather obvious case of scabies. John was all too happy to lurk in the background sipping as his coffee and observing. He made a mental note to send Sherlock’s coat off for fumigation as soon as they had the time. Meaning just as soon as they’d found their daughter.
Willa huffed and pulled back to stand properly. “Hello Uncle Mycroft, how are you?” She asked in a dull tone.
Sherlock thought for a moment. “Would you like to paint a new cup?” He wondered why he hadn’t thought of it first.
“You’re going to regret th-ahh.” Whatever Sherlock’s warning had been it was cut off when John took him into his mouth.
“I’ll go up and prepare her for your gift.” John said stepping back. The kitten was rather cute, with big blue eyes that were looking around the hall.
“I know but you should try, yeah?” John said choking back emotion. Sherlock’s fingers threaded with his.
When Willa was three John had decided he was done living solely off the money that magically appeared in his bank account each month and went back to work three days a week at a surgery. Willa was in nursery school for a week when she came home with the word ‘why’ blazing around in full force.
John flipped a few pages on the wall calendar. “Yeah, your birthday’s during the week so I’ll talk to your teacher and we’ll make cupcakes.”
Sherlock was uncommonly gentle when he grabbed John’s wrists and turned his palms upwards. Speaking softly when he said, “no, John, you are.”
Papa told her that once too, Daddy had made a grumpy face at the lesson. But it worked, neither of them came and demanded she open the door. They were trusting the fact that Willa had nowhere to go.
Sherlock lunged forward and pinned his hands up near his head. “I will tie you down.” He threatened, his voice rough and deep.
“Exactly, we’ll have her back in no time.” Mrs. Hudson said and gave a quick nod as if agreeing with herself. “What can I do?” She asked.
“For real?” David shouted, the teenage stoicism melting away as he practically salivated over the bike.
“Hmm, yes and someone keeps telling everyone it’s my birthday as well so I feel entitled.” Sherlock said not moving from directly in John’s path.
She carefully pushed the sweater through the crack until most of it was out the other side, hanging down from the window. Holding it in place, she bent down and scooped up a small pile of her hair and stuffed it into the sleeve still on her side. Cautiously Willa slid the window down until the shirt was pinned, the noise wasn’t as loud this time, then she poked at the fabric until none of it was showing on her side.
Mycroft shot him a look Sherlock remembered all too well from their childhood, the ‘don’t be an idiot, Sherlock’ one. “Of course I am.”
Isabelle fancied herself an actress and had had a number of small rolls on television but mostly seemed to enjoy partying. She’d recently had a number of nude photos leak to the press and instead of being mortified it only encouraged her antics further. She had recently been rumored to have agreed to pose for an adult magazine.
John watched as Sherlock slowly turned from where he was inspecting Greer’s bookshelves. “You’ve only just returned.”
Sherlock cuddled the kitten higher on his chest. “It’s better to seek forgiveness than to ask permission.”
John stepped around him finally and went to the wardrobe to pick out a nicer outfit for tonight. There would be photos if he knew his sister and Mrs. Hudson well enough, which he did. He was thankful for his strict ‘no Willa on social media’ rule, otherwise there would have been hundreds of photos of him as well.
He brushed past Sherlock and began climbing the stairs. He let out a small sigh of relief when he heard him following.
I'm in the middle of writing this garbage porn and fucking "Waltz for John and Mary" plays. I literally screamed and nearly threw my computer across the room.
Doctor Drescher inhaled deeply, clearly preparing herself for whatever she was going to say. “Doctor Watson, a classmate of Willa’s, Noah Wolfe, passed away this weekend.”
So I'm super mean to Willa but it's all for continuation of the plot. This helps further what happens in the next chapter which might be the last one for this story. If it's not the last it will definitely be the second to last one.
“No you don’t.” Lestrade informed him. “But I reckon you’re not going to tell me what you’re really up to. So go ahead and text him if you want.”
“Well that’s finished with.” Sherlock announced when he came into the flat late the Thursday before John’s training.
Jessica must have heard it in his voice because she nodded and scrambled out of the room without another word.
Sherlock winced at how fast John straightened to look at the doctor standing in the doorway behind them. Provoking John like that while he wasn’t in a good mood was not a great idea, of course the doctor honestly didn’t know that.
Willa was accustomed to Sherlock now. She enjoyed him around mostly because he was more than willing to indulge in her experiments once he learned she wasn’t just labeling mess making ‘experiments.’
Willa let out a noise and dramatically threw herself backwards across his legs so her head came to rest on one of Sherlock’s thighs. “So never.” She announced petulantly.
When they got home Sherlock disappeared into the bedroom to assemble the telescope, which John hated to admit was pretty nice. They still had time before needing to pick Willa up from school, John cleaned the flat.
John shook his head. “No, I just wish these vultures would learn to leave well enough alone.” He stood and squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m going to call the school and warn them. Thank god they’ve already got some high press kids there.”
She took a staggered step backward and held onto the wall, the shock written across her face. “What?”
Inside the box was a brass cylinder about 15 centimeters long. It took him a moment to realize what he was looking at. Once he did Sherlock grinned and pulled it out. It was a spyglass telescope that when extended went to about 35 centimeters. Looking through the lens Sherlock could tell it was fully functional. There was an inscription on the outer tube.
Harry looked startled and actually pushed herself further up the bed as if she could get away from them. “How’d you know about that?”
“It’s a children’s book, you’ll know what I mean when you see it.” John reassured him already halfway up the stairs.
“Oh Willa.” Sherlock said as he looked at her. She was crying, a pile of tissues was building up near her leg. There were scrapes on the right side of her head and her right arm was in a splint hidden beneath a sling.
In the middle of the empty floor sat a wooden chair with a sparse looking red cushion. It looked entirely out of place.
“What about Willa?” Harry asked. Willa, who had been watching the whole exchange like a tennis match, suddenly shrank into John’s side.
On his way out John shut both doors into the bedroom securely trying to block out as much noise as possible.
“So you saved me that night and about a thousand times since.” John whispered softly before pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s hair.
He’d spent the next year wallowing in his rage, pushing everyone away and drinking himself stupid every night. He was arrested almost monthly for various offenses but every single time he appeared before a judge his service history was looked at and he was let off out of pity. It only pissed him off even more.
“Sherlock, why’ve you been making Willa toast and honey every morning?” John called down the hallway to the bedroom.
John had to remind himself to breathe. “Willa’s missing.” It fell out of his mouth in a rush, blunter than he’d planned on telling her, but then how do you tell someone that your child has been kidnapped?
Mycroft had… questioned Harriet for half an hour after everyone else had gone running out before returning to the office. Even though there had been an officer in the hospital Mycroft decided it was best to put one of his own people at her door, to make sure nothing she said or did went unnoticed.
Mrs. Hudson made a noise of agreement. “Well I’m not going to take up knitting now am I?” She asked sounding affronted.
When John had woken and looked at his phone, message still displayed on the screen as unread, he scowled and shoved it face down on the night stand. John then turned and snuggled closer into Sherlock, complaining that he didn’t want to get up.
“Thirty-two year old football mum from Dollis Hills, eighty-year-old in Golden Gate’s assisted living facility, a seventeen-year-old kids from Hackney among five others who have absolutely nothing in common.” Greg said and pointed at the file in Sherlock’s hands.
At just that moment Greg’s mobile began vibrating in his pocket. He ignored it for a second, assuming it was a test, but it continued to go. Once he fished it out and saw that it was work he shuffled over into a corner, not really comfortable enough to leave everyone unsupervised.
John had anticipated it. She’d had a long day and even after falling asleep in the cab she would be exhausted. If she got up at her normal time she’d just end up being a bear all day. He noticed though that at quarter past Sherlock began shooting concerned glances up the stairs. Then at 8:45 he went and stood at the bottom of them. Sherlock had never been around for one of Willa’s catch up days and was no doubt fretting about why the girl who was up at 6:30 nearly every morning was still in bed two hours later.
That thought at least gave him something to do. Pulling out his mobile, he sent a text to David, even though he hoped he was asleep, and updated him (nothing) and asked for him to pass his love onto Addy.
They both put her to bed again, John didn’t feel compelled to read anything soppy but he laid down with her for a few minutes. Sherlock let them have their time and tonight John didn’t stop him from leaving.
John remembered himself and let Sherlock go. “Yeah well, getting soppy in my old age I guess.” He said with a sheepish smile.
It was Sherlock who finally broke the silence, embolden by John’s urging to just ask for what he wanted.
Once he finally worked up the nerve to leave the room he found John had already changed and was lying beneath the covers. Sherlock walked around to the empty side of the bed and slid beneath. Even though he could physically feel the tension in John the bed was warm and smelled wonderfully. He realized he really was tired.
John produced an envelope from Willa’s backpack and placed it in the center of the table. “Everything is drawn up already, all you have to do is sign in about a hundred places. Then we send it off to the courts and wait for them to tell us when it’ll be finalized.”
This brought Sherlock out of whatever mental paralysis he’d been in and he made a terrible face, slumping down in his chair.
“John.” Sherlock growled and leaned down to pepper soft kisses to his neck. It was such a contradiction from his tone that John shivered and leaned backwards into the touches.
Sherlock sighed, loudly and turned. “Don’t play coy, Mycroft, that is the last thing you should ever do. I can see the indents in your fingers, they were there when we met in Russia. You’ve removed a wedding ring.”
John was bent in half laughing, his entire face lit up with joy. He would have kept going forever but eventually his arms started to tire.
Willa knew when she was being mocked and she glared at Sherlock’s back. “I had to stop it last time because you came home.” She informed him icily.
John moved his hands under Sherlock’s hips and tilted them. The head of his cock finding Sherlock’s prostate with every thrust now.
John wasn’t drunk which was a good thing, Sherlock wasn’t sure how he’d explain that to Willa. Instead he was still wearing his jacket, hair mussed like he’d been running his hands through it repeatedly. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him.
Sherlock considered his answer before speaking. “The death of children evokes strong emotions even in strangers.”
Molly let out a gasp when she saw what Sherlock was holding but John held a finger up to his lips while pulling out his phone.
Sherlock leaned over and pulled the phone from his face, ignoring John’s swats. He pressed the speaker button.
John’s shoulders dropped and he seemed relieved. Had he actually considered that Sherlock would want to kick them out? They’d been honestly living on Baker Street longer than Sherlock had so really they had more a right to the place.
He nodded at John who didn’t look any more relieved. “I knew they were watching.” John said after a moment.
“Yes.” Sherlock agreed. He’d already showered and gotten the lingering smell of seventy-two hour old corpse out of his skin. “Now please hurry up. I need to stop somewhere before we get Willa.”
John listened to them talk while he watched his daughter hold the little boy. Aaron was falling asleep on the couch and John had an idea.
She’d worked with Gregory Lestrade for over a decade and there was only one time she’d seem him look this beaten down. It had been less than six hours after ‘Sherlock’ had jumped from the roof.
Sherlock leaned against the rail as his knees threatened to give out. It was the first time she actually had called him that name, not just asked if she could. “Goodnight, Willa.” His voice was weak even to his own ears.
Sherlock passed the time by making deductions about the people standing around them to John. He was in the middle of a deduction when the counting began and for once was happy to stop mid thought.
The streets weren’t very busy because of the holiday and John let go of Willa’s hand. They were walking close enough their shoulders brushed and Willa was a few paces in front of them, every so often glancing behind to make sure they were there.
Sherlock nodded and began untangling himself from Willa. Once she was laying down the laptop moved to rest on the side of the bed to face her.
Hadeon laughed until John dug his thumb in where the bone had split. “You really don’t know do you?” He gritted out.
He waited a few minutes once he got downstairs. He opened the laptop back up and went into the usage tracking for the security camera in her room. Sure enough, an ISP from Wales was currently active.
Willa felt like she knew this woman though she was certain she’d never seen her before. Déjà vu. That’s what Daddy had said was the feeling of having experienced something before even though you really hadn’t. Willa had never had déjà vu before.
John had expected Sherlock to heed his warning about the Christmas festivities that would take place and spend the evening elsewhere. Yet Sherlock was not only still in the flat when John returned from picking up Willa from school, he was awake and sitting at the desk typing something on John’s computer.
Greg nodded, mostly to himself before going towards the door. Just as he was about to exit he realized Mycroft was following him. He stopped short and turned around, forcing the other man to bump into him.
John shook his head. “Seriously Sherlock I don’t know how you can sleep like that. The way you curl up isn’t natural.”
John had his mobile out and was thumbing through the contacts when Sherlock barged in through the door to the kitchen. He seized John by the shoulders and kissed him hard.
Willa smirked and John recognized it as her ‘you’ve lost’ face, he almost felt bad for Sherlock. “I was testing to see if food dyes affected how fast snow melted and if so which colors affected it the most.” John could hear Mycroft in her words. No doubt he’d helped her refined her hypothesis when they’d been in the kitchen that day waiting for John and Sherlock to come up.
No doubt he would get sunburnt and be miserable but it would be worth it to see her and John on holiday. They would go during a full moon so he could teach her the most about tidal schedules and sea life, while John would teach her how to build sand castles during the day. John’s tan would make a reappearance and Willa’s hair would lighten in the sun, her freckles darkening again. He was about to pull out his phone to check for the perfect date when the car pulled to a stop in front of the flat.
“Look at me.” John urged and Sherlock opened his eyes to find John closer to his face than he had been.
Sherlock coming back had made Harry sick with worry but she’d stamped it down after seeing how happy it made John. Six years was a long time, surely Sherlock would have changed. Except he hadn’t, he was still a psychopath except now he’d been dragging her niece around in it as well as her brother. She’d hoped John would have more sense than to allow Sherlock this close to Willa but as always John was blinded where Sherlock was concerned.
It had started months and months ago when Mary was alive and on the run. John and Rosie had temporarily moved in with Sherlock, John unable to function in a place that reminded him of his anger every second of every day. Rosie was still waking twice a night to eat at that point and as soon as she would let out the slightest whimper, Sherlock would either make sure John was going to tend to her or rush off himself. He preferred bringing her down and making the bottle (or John making the bottle) rather than preparing one first and taking it up to her.
“Willa’s been talking.” Sherlock said amused, it confirmed his suspicions about Willa paying attention during Mycroft’s visit.
“I scolded her Mycroft, I didn’t hit her.” John said wearily as he dropped into his seat. He wasn’t entirely sure that he wouldn’t disappear if he did ever strike her.
John didn’t have a good reason for that. After Willa’s first Christmas it had become a tradition. “I think even if I didn’t let him play Father Christmas he’d buy her just as many gifts. Better she not realize Uncle Mycroft would buy her a small country if she asked.”
“Come in,” he told her. Mycroft knew the lack of knocking meant there had been some kind of news on his niece.
“We’re going to be late.” John warned from where he was leaning against the counter watching them, there was a small smile touching his lips.
There was a canopy set up to prevent anyone from seeing the body and no one questioned as Greg shoved himself into it. All motion inside the tent stopped and everyone just watched him, Greg didn’t doubt he looked a state, he could feel the sweat forming on his brow already.
She clearly wasn’t asking, as she was already disappearing into her flat towards the kitchen. “He’s out with the homeless, putting out the word about it.” He found himself feeling a bit calmer in this woman’s steadfast presence, his voice was more even now.
Sherlock looked almost intrigued at that bit of information. “You don’t have allergies.” He commented coming into the room.
John nodded. “That obvious?” He went around to Sherlock’s side to allow the doctor access to her injured arm.
“I want to taste all of you.” Sherlock whispered against his pulse point, tongue darting out to press against it.
She looked so much like John with her arms crossed and her chin stuck out in defiance. It was impossible for Sherlock to suppress the rush of emotion he felt towards this tiny girl. It was irrational. He’d barely met her and for all he knew she was a terrible brat. But that simply wasn’t an option, there was no way John would raise one of those common terrors. She was a part of John and she was being raised by him so there was no doubt in his mind that she would be just as extraordinary as her father.
She clucked her tongue at him. “That was one time, John Watson. I don’t make a habit of drugging people.” She scolded.
At four John went to wake Molly and Aaron. They were passed out fully clothed, on top of the covers and lying sideways across their bed.
They did decide to go with Sherlock’s suggestion of the telescope. John nearly had a heart attack when the cashier rang it up.
“Use your brain, John.” Sherlock snapped in a low voice. Oh yes, he was guarding himself against John.
This one was sitting on the book shelf in a lovely silver frame. Mycroft, Lestrade, John, Willa and two other children were the subjects of the photograph. Everyone was dressed up including the children, all of the men had matching boutonnieres made up of red lily’s pinned to their jackets.
“I want him to adopt me.” Willa interrupted suddenly, she was obviously worried about the sudden tension. Willa would never understand why anyone would find problem in Sherlock adopting her.
Sherlock finally began interacting with everyone during dinner, even managed to trade a few barbs with Mycroft, who instantly seemed relieved. Still he was nearly over attentive to Willa during the meal and John had to bite his tongue from scolding Sherlock when he cut her turkey for her. He recognized the gestures as an out from the conversation and figured there were far worse things Sherlock could do to distance himself when he was overwhelmed by what was going on in his brain.
John kept his gaze upwards and leaned down again, ignoring Sherlock’s hands tightening in his hair, and flicked his tongue in. Sherlock moaned this time, head dropping back.
Sherlock groaned burying his head further under the pillow, he freed one hand and reached over to nudge John.
John laughed. Willa bounced between typically childish books and things even John as an adult had very little interest in.
There was the sound of retching from behind them as Greer Fisher decided not to heed John’s advice to stay behind.
“You were threatened,” Greg said as soon as he realized it. The other four people in the room turned to look at him as if they hadn’t expected him to speak up. “That’s why you got so worked up earlier,” he explained.
“What were you threatened with?” Mycroft asked, toying with the handle of his umbrella looking for all the world as if he were bored. Greg knew better.
John nodded and pressed one last kiss to the scar. He followed a sparse trail of dark hair down to Sherlock’s navel, backing slowly off the bed so he was standing again.
Sherlock actually looked startled at the sound whereas John just stood. “Herself is meant to be doing homework.” He made his way towards the kitchen.
Willa started awake. She struggled to open her eyes, they were still so heavy, but when she did she could just make out the sun rising above some of the buildings outside her window. Not her window, she remembered and gave up struggling to keep her eyes open, the tears stinging at her eyes anyway. Her entire body felt too heavy, and besides moving her arm, she couldn't get it to do much she wanted. She wondered why she was awake since her body clearly wasn't ready to be up.
“Stop Sherlock.” John said through gritted teeth, because that was the very last thing he wanted to say. “Sherlock, stop.” He repeated and tugged at Sherlock’s hair.
During the third week in January the renovation in 221C is finally completed. John had gotten used to passing workers on his way out in the morning and hearing the sounds of construction carry on below them into the evenings. He’s not sure what had taken the renovation so long but he hadn’t stepped foot in the flat in years, it might have been worse off than he remembers.
There were about thirteen thousand things currently running through Greg’s head after a phone call like that. The most prominent being
“She’ll be fine.” He said, his voice sounded far away. Willa didn’t understand why, his mouth was right there.
“So you don’t want any more children?” Sherlock continued to press. He needed to know the answer to this question.
John sighed. “Go, Willa.” He ordered just like any good parent who’d watched their child guzzle down two full glasses of soda during dinner.
Willa eagerly pushed a door open and dashed into the room. John followed quickly, shoving the second door to the side. Willa was stopped in the center of the room staring at the tree. On her face was a look of such pure joy that made John smile. He quickly took several photos because
“Good, a fictional man is one thing, an oversized rabbit who delivers eggs is just insulting to children.” Sherlock insisted.
Sherlock slapped a hand over John’s mouth. “I am fully capable of murdering you in such a way they will never find the body.”
“I tried not to think about you.” John said in response. “In the hospital the day she was born I nearly punched a hole in the wall. After she was weighed and measured the first person I wanted to call was you. After that I thought it would just be easier not to think of you.”
He didn’t see it though and he hated himself for that. Willa had suffered because he hadn’t been vigilant enough. Hadn’t paid enough attention when John’s child, who had a heart as large as her father’s but vastly more untarnished, began to withdraw emotionally after a tragic loss.
John joined them after a moment and between the three of them the tree was decorated in short order.
Sherlock shook his head and sat up instead. His hands when to John’s jeans and worked to open them. “You’re overdressed.”
Gregory slumped over at this question. “They’re… it’s rough right now. I don’t think either of them have slept.”
“Bloody hell.” John cursed because sometimes there was a level of culture shock he went through in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes. A man who could call a five star hotel ‘not his favorite’ without thinking it odd.
John knew they needed to do it soon. Willa was frighteningly perceptive about those things and it was getting hard to act as thought nothing had changed. Sherlock was following his lead and hadn’t even asked when John planned on telling her. It appeared it was entirely up to him.
John caught her and then lifted her up to hug her tightly. She clung to him for a second before twisting away and half climbing out of his arms into Sherlock’s.
Sherlock turned to John and he instantly looked normal again, except for the small spray of blood from the last blow across his cheeks. “Shall we go home?”
“Never thought I’d see the day when Captain Watson settled down with a little one.” Luke said teasingly.
“Would it make you feel better if I said it was half a present to myself?”  Sherlock asked hailing a cab.
“But you can’t be Aunt Molly’s boyfriend she’s married to Uncle Aaron, I was in their wedding.” Willa informed him.
“Besides, this actually went pretty well, at least until she chucked herself off a jungle gym.” John said. “Which she would have done even if I were home.”
“There’s Daisy, she’s thirteen going on twenty.  Mason, he’s nine and desperately wants to be an only child. Gunner and Chase, they’re six and probably trying to figure out how to string up that poor boy they’re with. And finally, little Poppy, she’s just turned three.” Sherlock tried to smile politely at every introduction but he wasn’t exactly interested in the children. Just because he was positively smitten with Rosie didn’t change his feelings towards small humans in general.
“John I’m sorry.” Sherlock said, it was scarcely a whisper over the never-ending sound of sirens and people milling about on the street.
Willa was smitten, there was no other word for it. Even after the photos had been taken and they all settled back into their conversations she sat in the chair stroking him.
He knocked only once before pushing the door open, Mycroft was expecting him. What John hadn’t expected was to push open the door and be greeted by both Holmes brothers.
The next few files were only seconds long CCTV footage tracking glimpses of them as they made their way down the streets.
Sherlock gladly removed his hand and crawled up John’s body. John wrapped a hand around his cock to steady it, the other one coming to rest on Sherlock’s hips.
Finding an outfit he was content with John threw it on the bed and kicked off his shoes. He was in the middle of pulling his jumper over his head when Sherlock made a noise.
John messaged back after he administered the medication and took her temperature, which was thankfully normal.
“You were never planning on using this as an actual flat were you.” He asked Sherlock one he realized how much planning had gone into this room alone. There was no way he would have been able to change the plans since they’ve gotten together.
Sherlock nodded immediately. John, who had come into Sherlock’s life with trust issues, had had that precious trust pushed past the brink too many times in the past.
He slid to his knees, ignoring the pain from impacting on the tile floor, and scrambled up to Harry’s head. Her pulse was perfect, she’d just been knocked out.
Sherlock stood when he realized he recognized Lukas from the funeral that day, he’d been one of the ostracized members of Erik’s family.
Sherlock nodded, pleased that John was catching up, “exactly and when we find out who it was we’ll be able to determine if it’s connected.”
He turned to put him in the bassinet in order to go find something useful to do but he spied Sherlock on the sofa busy with his phone. John changed his route and walked over to him instead.
“Sherlock we… well Willa actually, she wants to ask you something.” John said cautiously before nudging Willa.
“John, I believe my brother would have known even if I hadn’t told him.” Sherlock said and then grabbed his arm. “We’ll be going now. Try not to need us before Sunday night.” He said this both to Mycroft and Greg.
