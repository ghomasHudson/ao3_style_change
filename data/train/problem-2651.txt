“Sherlock Holmes, of Sussex Downs, I know him,” Mike repeated.
But his data was still incomplete.
“Now you listen to me, Holmes,” John began, his voice stern in a way that John had never directed at Sherlock before. Sherlock felt his shoulders tense, but he still refused to look at John. “If you think I am going to abandon you to those psychopaths for three entire months, you’re not--” John broke off.
Chapter 10
Well. It’s wasn’t exactly a waste.
As the light from the campfire begins to dim, he thinks he hears for the first time raised voices. Good. One waves his automatic weapon around, pointint it at no one bust gesturing wildly. Another voice, deeper than the first, also heated. Someone has found the note he left, then. They’re meant to all think that one of the others has ratted them out, that Interpol are on their way out of Tbilisi, have in fact been on their way for some minutes, and are likely (barring some absurd accident) already in the woods nearby. (The woods to the west of the embankment, he heavily implied, in order to direct suspicion away from the eastern woods where he kept watch. If these men were half as intelligent as Mycroft had given them credit for at the beginning, this gambit would not have worked. But fortunately, they were idiots.)
“Examining a—without me?” Sherlock grumbled. “Why would they—” Something cold and unpleasant began to take root in his stomach. “Never mind, I have to go,” he said absently, swiping left on his phone.
The following week, on a Thursday, Sherlock prepared to execute the second experiment. The idea came to him one night while he was playing one of Accolay’s violin concertos.
Dear readers, if you are still here thank you for sticking with me though a medical disaster, move to a different state, and job change! I am hoping that I will have time to work on this fic more now that my life has chilled out a bit.
Sherlock had other plans though.
“What’s Lestrade on about? He thinks you’ve been texting me pictures of bodies?” Sherlock fixes John with a puzzled look.
Unable to form words, a glassy-eyed Sherlock simply arched his body toward John, a small whimper escaping his swollen lips. Instinctively, John pressed down against the detective, rubbing their rock-hard erections against each other.

“We’ll get it fixed,” John promised, noticing Sherlock’s forlorn look at his beloved coat.
“Not all doctors have messy handwriting,” Sherlock scoffed.
“John, I…” Sherlock began, but John dropped his hands quickly.
“You could help me wait for it to bake,” Sherlock suggested.
“We—I mean I. I really would like to talk about this, if—if that’s all right,” John said.
On the other side of town, John Watson finished drinking his third bottle of beer.
Sherlock nodded. “I’ll be back to normal an hour after. They take a bit of time to work,” he said.
“I just wanted to see if you would get jealous.”
“Don’t.” Sherlock stared into the kettle as the first few air bubbles began to rise to the surface of the water. “I’m so sorry Sherlock, I won’t do it again, I won’t come home drunk and handsy, I’ve never done anything like this before, I swear it won’t happen again,” he listed, his voice flat and devoid of emotion. “Does that about cover it?”
“Numbers station? What?” Lestrade looked utterly lost.
Sherlock set his teacup on the side table and snuggled down into the blanket. “All right. Goodnight, John.”
He saw John’s pupils dilate in a brightly lit room. Heck, he was even gaping. Sherlock had to call his name twice to bring him out of his tiny stupor. John seemed mesmerized by Sherlock’s nudity.
John muttered curses while he struggled into his tie, which did not seem to want him to knot it around his neck, and stuffed his feet into his shoes. There were condoms spilling out of his bag along with his books and wand, and he swept the lot unceremoniously back into the bag and threw it over his shoulder.
“What? No, its….you two know what numbers stations are, right? Your suspect is copying one. There used to be one broadcast from Muswell Hill that played a Scottish folk tune as the start tone, but the numbers were in English. I don’t know why he changed it…”
Well, what do you know. It is a different picture and now I can see it:
Thank you to Unpopcultural for the beta read! I really appreciate it xo
“You mean since your boyfriend...”
“Âllo! Vous-la, vous savez que vous êtes en eaux Française?” A supremely irritating voice draws him out of his thoughts, and Sherlock looks up. He seems to have drifted a bit closer to shore than he intended, and apparently the four occupants of this French coast guard boat are displeased with him.
“How the hell is that not the point? Say something to him!” Lestrade shot back.
“That was sodium hydroxide. It’s fine.”
It was already a quarter past ten in the evening when the detective and his blogger trudged up the stairs to 221B. John immediately went up to his room, kicked off his shoes and collapsed on his bed without even changing his clothes.
And so here Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective and sometime vampire, found himself lying on the floor of his sitting room at nine o’clock on a Saturday morning, feeling as warm and cosy as if he were wrapped in a wool blanket in front of a roaring fire.
“Read the cover,” Donovan urged.
I tap the picture, enlarging it on the phone screen a little. It looks the same.
“Sherlock! Holmes, m’boy!” Greg shouted. “We got you a present!” He waved a smallish square box, wrapped in garish red and green paper.
“Wouldn’t dream of it, love.”
He would ask this while doing something ostensibly innocuous, like pouring water into the kettle or mashing a tea bag against the side of his mug to make his tea brew faster, and each time Sherlock would look at him sideways.
He looked at Mike for help, only to see a student hurrying down the hall towards the three of them hollering “Dr. Stamford! Dr. Stamford!”
Not your pet detective. JW
Sherlock held the phone away from his ear, but sill managed to catch such Lestrade classics as “You can’t just handcuff a man to a door and leave him there,” and “you basically kidnapped him,” and “have you ever heard of warrants?”
“For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.” 1 Corinthians 13:12
Well. Lots to plan, supplies to gather, European Union borders to sneak across before dawn.
, to be exact.
“All right. I’ll see you later,” John said, and hurried out the door.
“Yeah, no,” John decided, and squared his shoulders. “I’ve only been here for about five minutes and I can’t stand to see you like this for another hour. There’s got to be a faster way to fix you. Sit up a little,” he said, kneeling by the side of the sofa.
“Watson,” Professor Sprout called. “I would think that as a future Auror medic you would be very interested in medicinal herbs. I expect that you will be relying on them often in your work.“
“Y-yes, John,” Sherlock stammered.
Sod off. SH
my hands leave a gross smudge of sweat on the screen of the phone, for crying out loud, and that makes typing even more imprecise--
This message could not be delivered.
“John?” came Sherlock’s voice. John’s face felt hot but he forced himself to look into Sherlock’s eyes, trying his best to look casual.
“I don’t want to intrude,” John said, unease creeping into his voice. “We don’t really know each other.”
thing to say.
The taxi ride is a long one, and I spend most of it thinking. “How long do you think it will take?” I had asked, blinking up at him against the sun. “Oh, I’d say no more than six months,” Sherlock had said, an undercurrent of something I couldn’t quite identify in his voice.
Messy one today. Looks like a standard jumped in front of a train suicide  JW
Sherlock’s voice cracked a bit from disuse. “Well, get on with it,“ he said, and waited.
Why aren’t you telling me anything GL
The eyes were flat and cold, with only the barest hint of anticipation. The lines in the man’s forehead said cruelty, and anticipation, and added to the laugh and the expression in those eyes and the well-muscled build and the thin, predatory smile meant one thing: this was a man who had hurt others, and enjoyed it. This was a torturer.
“Sherlock, wait,“ John said. “Did—did you take your pills this morning?”
This, as it happened, was Sherlock’s first mistake. While he was holding the door open for John, a breeze blew through the door, swirling some loose newspapers around a pile of bottles, making no small amount of noise.
“This is what you do, isn’t it?” John asked. “Watch us both like hawks, and kidnap me for a ‘chat’ when you think something bad has happened?”
“Hey. You need a break,” John said. “You’re been at this awhile, yeah?“ He set the bow on the arm of the sofa and lifted Sherlock’s left hand from the strings. A smudge of red remained on the strings above the ebony fingerboard.
“As you say,” Mycroft replied. “But I’m afraid in this case there isn’t much that I can tell you. It is quite possible that you know more about Sherlock’s…situation than I do, Doctor Watson.”
The last thing that Sherlock remembered was a large mass moving quickly towards his head. He ducked, but his reactions were slow, dulled by pain and stiffness.
“Well, I had it last night...”
“John––“ Sherlock started. But John didn’t hear the rest of the words as he closed the door and descended down the stairs, his cheeks burning.
Anyway I don’t know why I’m still texting you, it’s not like you’re getting any of these at all, wherever you are. JW
“We haven’t been the same––not since you came back,” the doctor continued, his left hand trembling as it gripped the towel around his waist.
John remembers an afternoon around the end of Sherlock's first year, back when there was something terrible about himself that Sherlock did not want John to find out.
John stayed in his chair for a few minutes, listening as Sherlock’s breathing evened out and he began to snore softly.
It doesn’t take time to hit the forward button! Come on, send it to him. He really came through for us on that last one. GL
“You didn’t take your pills this morning, did you?” John shook his head.
, Sherlock thought, glancing down at his wrinkled robe and running a hand through his curls to dishevel them further. He was glad he had sprayed down his bedroom door with WD-40 earlier in the week; it would have been a terrible start to his plan to be foiled by a squeaky hinge. Letting out a breath he would never admit to have been holding, Sherlock rapped his knuckles on the bathroom door.
Sherlock took a deep, shuddering breath.
As he held the envelope open to slide the card back into it for safekeeping, he saw for the first time the date on the postmark of the card: December 5th, 1992.
Well, hardly any point trying to sleep another half hour, may as well get up. Half a liver to remove at 6:30, and it doesn’t hardly inspire confidence when your doctor’s half asleep.
When John’s brain caught up to Sherlock’s words, he pushed his chair back, causing his cane to clatter to the floor. He ignored it in favor of bracing himself against the side of the table, and carefully made his way around to Sherlock’s side. Taking a deep breath, he caught Sherlock’s hand, which was still holding the card, between both of his.
“Yeah no I’m fine, it’s all fine here, thanks Sarah”
Oh piss off. JW
Sherlock glanced at John, who shrugged. He crumpled the wrapping paper into a ball and dropped it on the floor, then flipped to August.
“No, but….in my sock index. In the very back. There’s a bottle. Can you bring it?” Sherlock asked. It was the last thing he wanted, but did not think he was currently capable of walking to his room himself to retrieve it, and he figured that John knowing about the bottle was better than him passing out from hypothermic shock in front of him in the bathroom.
“Oh, where should we do that?” John asked, teasing.
Sherlock huffed, a damp sort of sigh. “I do, actually,” he said. “There are curses on the estate preventing entry to all but pure-blood wizards.”
“Think they’ve got enough decorations?” John asked, glancing around the greenhouse. “I think they’ve covered just about every single seasonally-appropriate greeting.”
With no new cases from Lestrade, Sherlock spent the next day and a half alternating between lying about on the sofa drinking tea and furiously composing on his violin. After the first four hours of violin, John called in to the clinic to see if he could pick up some extra hours to get himself away from the noise and his incredibly distracting and scantily dressed flatmate.
He wiped a grimy hand on his jacket, then turned the envelope over to read the front.
“The pills are my own design. I said that I have to have them to live—that’s—there are other things that I could have instead of them.” He paused, looked down at his arm. The stitches were done; John was washing the needle in the sink and replacing the contents of the first aid kit.
“You can sit down you know.” She said waving over at the dining table. “Or you can sit down in the living area, I don’t mind.” She said. Lestrade then spoke up.
“That was incredible.” She murmured. The woman froze slightly before coking her head to the side, arms crossed.
“Come on, you two are with me. I’ll let the other know where they need to go when we get there.” Donovan looked at her boss.
x-x-x-x-x
“I work with NYPD, have been since I was 13, when they get cases they can’t solve, which is almost always, they contact me.” She glanced up at Keira. “I suppose you could call me a Consulting Detective or something, I don’t really care for labels.” Keira just blinked.
“Lestrade, I suggest you get back to your office, I’ll explain as much as I can tomorrow John grab a chair and sit down next to me.” With that Elizabeth looked back at her computer screens. Lestrade and John looked at each other worriedly. After a few minutes Lestrade sighs and just nods at John before leaving the apartment without another word. John grabs a chair from the dining table and picks it up to take it into the front room. He glances over at the photo of Elizabeth, Keira and Sherlock and sighs.
“Biological and Forensic Science Mr Wilson.” Said a female voice from behind him. Keira looked up to see a rather tall female with long black hair, blueish eyes and incredibly sharp cheek bones. She gave Keira a small smile before looking her up and down. “Italy or Malta?” She asked. Keira just blinked.
He starts crying—actually, crying is an understatement. He's sobbing.
But I guess she can’t take care of Sherlock and I forever.
“He was a fake,” I tell her.
I set it on the arm of the chair and look out the window, trying to figure everyone that passes out—trying to guess their stories—to deduce them they way Sherlock would have. I don't usually come up with anything though. Just the obvious things like the man with dirt under his fingernails, holding a paper bag and stumbling down the street. He's obviously a drunk and spends all of his money on alcohol, leaving very little for clothing (and a shower. I walked past him one day with Mrs. Hudson and we both agreed we would let him come inside to take a shower.)
It was different because I had Sherlock by my side.
I blink. Sherlock is staring at me with a tired expression and Mrs. Hudson is staring at me with a look of concern.
“After that you'll be going to Serbia for a year or two.”
He tears off a piece of his dinner roll and slathers it in butter before popping it into his mouth.
John furrows his brow. "What's going on?"
“John!”
I knew John would be excited to see me, but I didn't expect this kind of reaction from him. He looks like absolute rubbish—he has dark purple circles under his eyes and it looks like he hasn't gone outside since I left. His face his pale and his thinner than he was before. He needs a shave . . .
I give in and not, scanning the room even though I already know where I want to sit.
John is starting to get angry and clenches his fists.
When he's finished I stand and admire my headstone. That's one thing Mrs. Hudson got right—it's one that I would have chosen.
She sits down next to me and I look up at her. She has a dishtowel slung over her shoulder and her hands are red from the hot water. “You're lucky,” she says, even though that's the opposite of what I'm feeling right now, “I don't sit on the floor for just anyone. It messes with my hip, and you'll probably have to help me up.”

“No.” I say, trying not to raise my voice.
She came with him today, and I heard her talking about how they're going to come back every week. I remind myself to come back, too. Just in case.
“Bloody specimens in my fridge. Imagine—keeping bodies where there's food!”
When I come home from the grocery store I still expect him sitting in his chair with his fingertips pressed together, thinking.
He kisses the top of my head. “Me too.”
She doesn't say anything, she just stares sadly at her Trifle like it was the one that said that and not me.
But what if I want him to see me? What if I want him to keep holding onto this hope that I'm still alive. I know he's hoping that now—why else would he come talk to my headstone every week?—but he's losing hope. I can tell by his voice, the way he sounds disappointed and sort of ridiculous for even hoping.
“I'm sorry.”
John knocks softly and opens the door.
"I have a doctor."
And those six words are enough to break my heart in two.
“Freeze!”
"Goodbye, John."
He closes his eyes and shakes his head. "No, alright, stop it now." He starts walking across the street again.
I nod and move closer to him. “I’m glad you’re back.”
I take a taxi to the edge of town where I'm supposed to meet Mycroft—apparently he has some important job for me to do.
I look back at John, who shakes his head a little. "Why are you saying this?" he asks.
For him.
That's alright . . . I'll let Mycroft send me where he wants and I'll fix all of his problems.
“Yes.” I close my eyes.
It's the end of Sherlock Holmes, the world's famous (and only) consulting detective genius.
It takes everything in me not to step forward. But I keep my face blank and hide underneath the low branches of a tree. John might have seen me if he wasn't so caught up in his whole speech.
I compose myself, stand, and let Mrs. Hudson fling herself at me.
"No," he cries. "Don't."
Mrs. Hudson is the first one to stop coming to talk to Sherlock, but I'm not far behind her. I keep coming for another two weeks, and it's then I decide that I need to move on.
I turn to look at John, smiling.
She puts a hand over her mouth and her eyes get wide, but she doesn't cry. Not for the first time do I wonder what Mrs. Hudson has gone through to get to this point. To seem so. . . emotionless.
before.” He says.
I was hiding behind a row of trees today, and leaned against one that wasn't half as sturdy as it looked. John glanced up, but didn't see me. I ducked down just in time.
And why is it, when someone asks the question, we feel obligated to say yes, even if it isn't true?
“I'm glad to be back.” I say, and I mean it. This is the only place I really feel at home.
“Shut up.” I say to the voice in my head. Not that it will listen.
But he asked me to, so I have to. For him.
I can hear everything he says, just like I could when I was laying on the concrete. I could hear his whole world falling apart.
Walking back to Baker Street was a complete blur. And if I hadn't known my way by heart, I'm not sure if I would have even made it back, my head was somewhere else entirely, but I could find my way to Baker Street from anywhere in London.
I take a sharp inhale and wipe my eyes. I raise my head and give one quick nod before turning and walking away. It takes everything in me to walk away from my best friend. I made a promise to myself to come back every week to put new flowers around his headstone and to talk to him—to say the things I should have said before.
“Careful!” John yells with a look of panic on his face.
I never want to let go.
I smile because that means I can see John Watson again and it will be perfect.
Mycroft is sending me somewhere in Japan or something to take care of some of his unfinished business.
Thanks for sticking around xx
What's this??? Two chapters in a day?! *gasp*
I nod.
I stood across the street and watched him sit at the same table we sat at together, the night after he moved in. He looked out as Angelo was arriving with his food, and when John looked away, I took that as my cue to leave.
Sorry for the short chapter, I'm trying to get ready for Camp NaNoWriMo, so the updates might be shorter and more irregular so I'm sorry for that but I'll try to update as much as possible!
"It's all true."
“No,” I say, resting my head in my hands. “It—”
He smiles and nods lightly. His face is pale and his lips are chapped and cracked. He looks like absolute shit, but I'm to happy (and relieved) to see him. None of that matters right now. He's home.
Two hours later, cleanly shaven and wearing my signature coat and scarf, I leave Mycroft to his “very important business” and take a taxi to Baker Street.
I clear my throat. “Sorry. Lost in thought. What did you say?”
I pass Baker Street, even though I know it's risky. I walk up to the door, and almost knock, but stop myself just before my knuckles hit the door.
And then I realise that maybe it would be better if I didn't know what they were saying.
I thought about sneaking into Baker Street and taking some of my things, but Mrs. Hudson has a gun, and one of them would definitely notice.
Had she known I was coming back? It wouldn't surprise me.
They have me surrounded, and I'm outnumbered.
I look up at the house, feeling small as it looms over me, casting a shadow from the setting sun.
“I said,” I'm panting, from both the lack of breath and the pain, “fuck off.”
I follow Sherlock's gaze to the stick of butter sitting on a red plate next to my elbow and hand it to him.
“I'm sure you've been having a lovely time, but the holiday is over. Back to Baker Street we go.”
Mrs. Hudson recently decided to start dating again. I’m not sure how it’s going because she won’t talk to me about it, but she’s been going out quite a bit lately. I hope it’s the same guy and that they’re getting along well, but it’s more likely that she’s going on dates with different men.
I didn't want to leave, but I knew that I couldn't stay here, either. At this rate John would figure out it was me following him by the end of the week. And then what?
“Where are you going?” I ask through a mouthful of biscuit.
"Do what?"
I clench my jaw, unable to tell if I'm angry or sad. A bit of both, I suppose. “He. . .” I shake my head and blink back tears. I can't do this. I can't say it out loud.
“Can I move back in?” I ask quietly, like I'm ashamed to ask, even though I know she'll say yes.
I smile and nod.
I shake my head lightly. I don't want Mrs. Hudson to know what I went through. I don't need to worry the poor woman any more than I already have.
He turns and raises his eyebrows. “Hm?”
I put everything back in the drawer where it was and sit back in the chair, studying the blade.
“Tell me where he is,” the man that kicked me leans in close. “If you do we'll let you go.”
John looks around and starts walking back across the street. "Where?" he asks as soon as he reached the sidewalk where he was before when he got out of the taxi.
I open my eyes and turn to Mrs. Hudson. “Listen, I-I'm not actually
It's time to surrender.
Without John, what more do I have to live for anyway?
One of the pedestrians that was around when it happened helped me over to a nearby bench and sat with me, and that was the only thing holding me back from screaming my lungs out—the only thing holding me back from following Sherlock . . .
“I've never heard you say
I open the middle drawer, pushing my razor and shaving cream aside to get to the back. A box of blades sit there and I pull them out, opening the box and taking one out.
“John? John Watson?”
Glance back at Lestrade.
he thought.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed. “John, yes, let’s—yes.”
“We know you’re in England,“ Molly said, fiddling with the pocket of her lab coat. “The dirt on the floor in the room where he keeps you is chalky, Sussex dirt. Could be near Dover.“
“I don’t want a drink,” Sherlock protested, but allowed himself to be lead to the bar.
The escape continues.
“Well,” Sherlock sniffed, clearly thinking he sounded dignified. “Be that as it may, seventh year arithmancy starts in ten minutes on the opposite side of the castle.”
A note of Captain Watson had crept into his voice, and John’s tone brooked no argument.
“What, a ladder? What for?“ Lestrade looks mildly curious now. “What’s he saying?“
And there he was, finally, finally. Sherlock must have heard him coming, because he stood in the middle of the room, barefoot, handcuffed, no shirt, looking--well. Looking like a mess, but a non-life-threatening mess, John thought. He dropped everything he was carrying at the door and crossed the room in very few steps, pulled the taller man into a hug. Sherlock’s shoulders stiffened, and he made a noise that might have been the beginning of a protest, and John put his hand in his hair, holding him closer.
But there was always the matter of the phone, and the near-certainty (now validated) that Mycroft was surveilling John quite closely. And if Mycroft couldn’t know that he was (still, stubbornly) alive, then that meant John couldn’t either, at least not in any obvious way. That thinking had kept him anonymous throughout most of the mission.
“Greg….” John’s voice took on a slight edge. “Don’t.”
Sherlock glanced at Greg, considering. The DI was clearly hiding something, but there was pitifully little evidence to lead him to what, exactly, the man was hiding. He eyed the glass that was now in John’s hand. Unremarkable, plastic, pale yellow coloured liquid inside. He glanced back at the bar, but the bottle that Greg had poured from must have been whisked away, or finished already.
The dirt samples from Regent’s Park, Richmond Park, Clapham Common, and Victoria Park were neatly recorded in tables in Sherlock’s lab notebook and he was just about to make the first slide from a Hampstead Heath sample when the power went out at the lab. Grumbling a little, Sherlock tipped the used slides into a sharps bin, then stacked the Hyde Park, St. James’s Park, Greenwich Park, and Hampstead Heath baggies into a drawer. He scribbled “DO NOT DISTURB - SH” on a piece of paper tape and stuck it on the drawer’s handle. Molly was usually the only other person to use this lab and if anyone could be trusted with the Dirt Survey it was her.
“Did that—I’m sorry, did—” Sherlock stumbled over the words, his lips still pressed to John’s arm.
“How about here?” John asked, rolling up the sleeve of his jumper and unbuttoning his shirt cuff.
(See the end of the chapter for
John goes out on an errand, leaving Sherlock just enough time for a secret task. Or so he thinks...
what if there’s a serial killer out there and ill never know cause u aren’t telling me what he said! GL
“Go, go,” Sherlock grumbled, his voice muffled slightly by the duvet. “You needn’t worry that I’m going to feel neglected or used just because you’re rushing off first thing in the morning.” That was exactly what John had been worried about, but the hint of smugness that had crept into Sherlock’s voice at the end convinced him otherwise.
“Something to do with maintenance, waiting for someone to replace a burnt out bulb,” he says, clearly irritated. Well I’m sorry Lestrade, that makes no sense at all. This is London. Lights in tube stations are not just left burnt out for hours on end. And even if they were, what’s the likelihood that five out of the er.....counting...seven light fixtures in this station are all burnt out at the same time? It seems unlikely to me. I’m not him or anything but isn’t there something funny about that?
His current supply of pills was from the third batch he had made. The first had been too strong, and when he had shown up at a crime scene after taking one of those pills, Lestrade had accused him of being back on drugs (technically true, but not the drugs Lestrade meant), then told him he was burning up and to go home and sleep off his fever. The second batch of pills had become contaminated when he was called away from babysitting a delicate step of the synthesis to a chase, and….well, he had been making them in a pathology lab. There was no shortage of possible contaminants. Sherlock was fairly certain the second batch were contaminated only with the common, dull Streptococcus pneumoniae, but found he was not actually all that interested in testing this out. He’d thrown them in the incinerator down in the Bart’s cadaver lab.
“John.”
John trudged into the great hall, exhausted from Quidditch practice, and plopped down on a bench at the end of the Gryffindor table.
“John?”
Meanwhile, John was having a bad dream upstairs. In his mind, he saw the arsonist they were interrogating earlier. The arsonist took off his face like a mask and revealed that he was Moriarty. Moriarty then pulled out a gun and before John could do anything, Sherlock was shot in the head.
“Y-yes John,” Sherlock stuttered, and began to outline his deductions.
“Well, the reason for that should be obvious,” Sherlock said, flopping down onto the sofa. “I haven’t come up with a good lie yet as to why I was so useless at the suspect’s murder nest.”
By the time the cab stopped in front of a brick townhouse in Muswell Hill, John had the beginnings of a plan and Sherlock just wanted it to be over. He shivered and wrapped the Belstaff more tightly around himself—John mustn’t notice. John must never suspect. The sooner this was over, the sooner he could get at the bottle of pills that he had stashed at the back of his sock index. Normally he didn’t go out on crime investigations without at least one or two hidden in an inside pocket of his coat, but he had forgotten them this morning, and—damn. And it had been about twenty-four hours since his last pill, and he already had chills, which gave him approximately an hour and a half before hypothermia started to set in.
Sorry for the angst :/ Sherlock has some wrong ideas about a lot of things.
He heads farther out to sea, one name in his mind, echoing in time with the sound of the waves on the side of his boat--
Important how GL
When he finally reached his room upstairs, he locked his door and leaned against it. His hands were shaking.
I believe that within five days my brother will need your assistance. Specifically, I require you to be in Milford-on-Sea, Sussex, at the weekend. MH
This message could not
Thanks for reading <3
Sherlock throws the phone to the deck of the boat in frustration. Mycroft is right--it is sentiment, pure, irrational sentiment, but somehow yesterday evening it seemed very important to drop the hint, to tell him without actually going so far as telling him. To soften the blow, maybe, when he (barring further setbacks) arrives in London sometime next week. He supposes that it’s no longer mission-critical that he remain completely undercover, but he had—rightly—assumed that if anyone found out he had survived this goat rodeo of a mission it would get back to his insufferable brother, and he has had just about enough of Mycroft’s meddling and orders lately.
Half the mug’s contents later, he reflected that he did not wish to speak with John any time soon, and retreated to the safety of his bedroom with his tea. Sherlock latched the door behind himself and considered the mess before him. A pile of graduate chemistry textbooks teetered on the edge of the dresser, from whose drawers were spilling any number of non-indexed pants and vests. His sock index was in disarray thanks to his preoccupation the past week with a particularly difficult case that had also been very disguise-intensive. His backup stash of his favoured skincare products were in a disordered pile under his bed rather than in their rightful place (the top right drawer of his dresser.)
This was a finale meant to be savoured, its quarter notes and dotted half notes suggesting something bright and beautiful, but Sherlock twisted and stretched his now-bruised fingers, forcing the notes meant to be played in a luminous second position into a tortured third.
The walk home sobered him, and by the time he walked through the door of Baker Street and ascended the seventeen steps to their sitting room, John had a clear head. Sherlock was curled on the couch with one of Mrs. Hudson’s afghans wrapped around himself. Thinking that he was asleep, John crept through the doorway and didn’t put the light on.
A twinge of pain in his arm brought all the details back: ducking away from Lestrade, the knife-throwing murder suspect, John. John. The worst thing that Sherlock could imagine (okay, second-worst, he admitted to himself—the worst did not bear thinking of) had happened the night before and…he felt wonderful. Floaty. Warm, when he likely should have been shivering already. Sherlock picked up his phone: it was already after 9 am. He definitely should have been shivering already.
“Right, around this corridor there should be a maintenance hatch and a ladder,” John said, leaning too close to Sherlock’s ear. “If you think you can climb it, that would be the safest escape route. Lowest chance of encountering any hostiles.”
Sherlock finally turned around to face John.
“I don’t remember that conversation, and I have an eidetic memory,” Sherlock replied. “Besides, I’m not doing anything dangerous.” To illustrate, he picked up the spray bottle again and puffed it at the flame. A mist of 0.5 molar sodium hydroxide glowed red in the flame as it burned.
“Do you think so little of me?” The voice chuckled again. Sherlock was rapidly becoming impatient with this conversation in spite of how satisfied and amused the other participant seemed to be. He struggled to sit up (Why? Ah. Hands handcuffed behind back. How dull. Sherlock resolved to pickpocket his gaoler at the first opportunity. In his experience, kidnappers were frequently unimaginative enough to carry the keys to handcuffs on their person.), then turned around to see a man sitting in a chair.
That, as it turned out, was a question he should have thought more about before proceeding to unwrap the box.
Sherlock leaned around the corner and eyed the ladder with distrust. John had not yet seen his feet and didn’t know about the layer of first-degree burns Sherlock had been walking on thus far without complaint. He took a deep breath.
“Really? Why?” John asked.
“You memorized them.” Sherlock couldn’t keep the note of incredulity from his voice. His John Watson, memorize anything more detailed than a shopping list? Half the time he couldn’t even get those right.
Ten seconds later, he heard the front door open.
“No.” Sherlock shivered again in spite of the blanket.
By the time John pulled open the door of the greenhouse in which seventh year Herbology (fairly boring, but an absolute requirement for anyone wanting to go into the new Auror Medic training program after graduating Hogwarts, as John did), he was finally beginning to feel like himself again. All day long, he had felt wrong-footed and as if he was unaware of half of what was going on. Herbology class would fix that. John was good at it, and he usually shared whatever plant they were working on with Mike Stamford, who was easy to talk to and willing to help out with an occasional prank.
I wait until I hear her close the door downstairs and I see her walking down the street until I stand. I look out the window again, just to make sure she didn't forget something before going to the bathroom.
I look down at the headstone.
It breaks my heart to see him like this.
Two men are standing at my side. One is asking me questions, and when I don't give them answers, the second one cracks my back with a whip. I've gone numb. I don't even feel the pain anymore.
She just smiles coyly and goes back downstairs.
I push him away. “I have a doctor!” I snap. “And if you let me see him he could help me,”
I don't mind, it will keep my head busy for awhile.
I didn't want a funeral, and I would probably want one less when I'm old. I never cared much for scenes, unless they were crime scenes.
Mycroft sighs and rolls his eyes—the classic older brother face. “You can't see John yet. You need to shave and cut your hair. You need to make a plan.”
I quickly scan the trees in the distance and, just as I suspected, there are snipers above us.
At this point I've lost all hope that he's coming back. It was nice to imagine for awhile—I guess it made it easier. But I know better than that now.
” Mrs. Hudson says quietly. “All of the science equipment. I left it all in boxes, I don't know what needs doing. I thought I'd take it to a school,” she looks at me. “Would you. . . ?”
fish and chips I've ever tasted,” she's saying, but I'm only half listening.
We both stare at each other for a moment, trying to keep a straight face, before we both start laughing uncontrollably.
I lean my head back against the wall, with my knees still pulled up and my forearms resting on them. We sit there for awhile—Mrs. Hudson and I—not saying a word, but still being there for each other and finding comfort in the silence we share together.
He's sitting in a chair in the shadows, so I can't see his face, but I recognize his voice.
herlock has been locked in his room since Lestrade dropped off the photos. I’ve knocked a few times but he won’t answer. I hear him muttering to himself, talking himself through the case.
“I know.”
Ten men come out from behind the trees wearing all black. They have masks on, so I can't see their faces, but I know they aren't some kids playing around.
Mrs. Hudson is happy to see me. She made a classic english breakfast, even though it's almost four o'clock.
“No,” I say, leaning back in Sherlock's chair. I add, “Thank you, though.” So I don't sound rude.
I let out a breath of relief and nod. “Okay, thank you.”
“Can you please pass the butter?”
He nods and sits down next to me, the mattress sinking under our combined weight. “How's the pain?”
I mumble random words just to get him to untie my mouth. If they wanted answers, they shouldn't cover my mouth with a dirty cloth.
She puts her hand on my face and smiles broadly. “You came home.”
So I’ve been hiding it, hiding how desperately I want him, and for a few weeks I even thought maybe it was a good thing, him going on this mission or case of whatever it is off somewhere. But then one month turned into two and now eight and damn you Sherlock fucking bloody Holmes you better not be dead before I can get to you. Not when you’re so close, finally on English soil if I can believe Mycroft.
Happy Christmas,
Mycroft sighed.
“Charming as usual, Anderson,” Sherlock shot back. “You, one the other hand, have not had a date in the how long is it now? Four months since Donovan left you?” He chanced a look at John, who grinned at him. All right. This is still normal, at least.
“Can I help?” John asked, drifting over to the counter. “Ooh. You have glace cherries?” He snatched one from the bowl and ate it.
(compared to some other fics of mine that shall remain nameless)
“Fucking hell,” John hissed, getting a glimpse of Sherlock’s back for the first time. “I am going to fucking kill whoever did this to you.”
The surgery goes well. I leave my phone in my locker which turns out to be a good job because Lestrade has sent me no fewer than eight text messages by the time I check it after scrubbing out and getting back into my civilian clothes.
Sherlock Holmes”
“Two in the morning and two in the evening before midnight,” Sherlock said automatically.  “But I’m not cold. I don’t need them yet.”
John stuffed Sherlock’s arms through the sleeves of his coat to try to bring a modicum of decorum to this escape (and to remove distractions), then turned to pick up his bag and gun. Sherlock became reacquainted with the floor.
“I--” John didn’t see any way out of this, but he desperately did not want to show Sherlock the card. Any chance (and he doubted he had any chance at all, but hope springs irrational and eternal) he had with Sherlock would surely be destroyed as soon as the man found out that he carried around a card he had written as a child every day. There would be no recovery from that.
“I though’ I told you no Bunsen burners’n the kitchen,” John said, crossing his arms across his chest. A few of his vowels were a little more broad than usual-he must have been drinking, Sherlock decided.
“That must be it. It must have been taken at some point during the night,”
Simplest way to resolve this: dispatch them all with a sniper rifle. They are well within range of the gun that Mycroft insisted he take along, six months ago. The gun that he lost in a flood four months ago. Mission objectives: determine if suspects have been in contact with illegal arms dealer, and if suspicions proved correct, neutralize them in the most expedient and unnewsworthy manner; lethal force permitted.
Later, John would look back at this conversation and recognize this for the truly perilous moment that it was. But when it happened, he said only what came immediately to mind.
Some series spelling mistakes on that last one--Lestrade must be really mad.
Sherlock snored in reply.
“Shouldn’t you put your tie on? You’ll get points taken from Hufflepuff if you’re caught without it,” John said.
“Câlisse, ai-je? Quelle port et-ce que c’est, la bas?” Sherlock waves vaguely at the shore. Probability of disguising his RP accent to a native speaker in Metropolitan French: nil. Probability of successfully passing for a native speaker of Québecois French to this Metropolitan speaker: 76%. Probability increases by 8% for each passable Québecois swear. As far as he knows, the public have not yet been made aware (courtesy of John’s blog) of the months he spent undercover in eastern Canada, so there should be no association in the mind of the average European between himself and this dialect. If anything, a rational person would find it far more likely that he would speak Metropolitan.
“Is it like that for you,” John asked, and the words came out mashed together into almost a single syllable.
It didn’t take John long to pack. Growing up as a muggle meant he owned few magical things, apart from what was required for his classes and Quidditch, and John had always been tidy. His books and clothes lived permanently in his trunk, so it was only a matter of fishing some dirty socks and vests out from under his bed and…oh. And pulling that note from Sherlock out of his pillowcase. It was the first letter Sherlock had ever sent him (and he hadn’t sent many: once John had introduced the Holmes brothers to smartphones they were instantly hooked) over the summer after his third year.
“So is he coming or what?“ Lestrade takes short, irritable drink of his coffee, which smells like stewed cigarette butts.
“I’m sick and tired of this, Sherlock,” John growled as he glared at the back of the taller man’s head.
“Yes,” Mycroft Holmes had replied coldly, eyeing John with distaste.
John didn’t reply. He dumped some iodine onto a towel and wiped it across Sherlock’s arm, perhaps a bit more roughly than strictly necessary.
The floor creaked as John took a few tentative steps towards the sofa, debating to himself whether or not he should wake Sherlock. He looked peaceful, but—today was a No Pills day and unless Sherlock had changed his habit and taken them, he would be blue and shivering before dawn.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock I’m so--”
Unfortunately, the class had actually settled down at Sprout’s command, and she heard his giggle loud and clear.
“Warmer, if you can imagine, quilts and afghans everywhere,” Sherlock promised. “Say you’ll come home with me, please.”
and suddenly he knew that he could never sleep apart from his mad Holmes ever again.
The next time Sherlock and John arrived at New Scotland Yard in a shared cab, Anderson happened to be leaving the building just as they were walking towards it, and Sherlock cringed at the nasty smile that spread across Anderson’s face.
“I’m not a glutton! I don’t need to do this!”
Sherlock passed him the glass. “An exceptionally rare vintage of mead,” he said. “Nineteen ninety-nine. Only a few gallons were made from those hives that year, and I didn’t know any of them survived.”
He did not look at John, but opened the medicine cabinet and pulled out a bottle at random. Something pinged in the back of his brain, an itch of
His disbelief must have showed, because John laughed softly.
“I don’t have a love life, John,” Sherlock muttered, a blush creeping up his cheeks.
No, the warmth that currently hummed through his veins could not be attributed to the fact that he had drunk liquid blood for the first time in almost a year. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, turned onto his side. Responsibility for this could be laid squarely on one person, and one person only. It was John Watson’s blood that had done this to him, turned his veins to sunlight and warmth.
“You daft git,” John said fondly, twining the fingers of his other hand into Sherlock’s hair. “We should have done this hours ago. You’re freezing, and not from the rain.”
“Vous m’approchez moi je vous décalissir comme vous n’avez jamais vu,” he throws back to keep up appearances, but there’s no real malice in his voice. The growl is only there to keep up some pretence at all of the level of hostility expected in this kind of interaction. Sherlock is already turning the boat around.
He glanced around furtively as he pulled Sherlock’s wand out of his bag, but fortunately nobody seemed to notice. Whether or not the wand would actually work for him was another story. The holly-and-kelpie-hair wand had sat on the shelf at Ollivander’s since before the current Ollivander was born, and at some point an Ollivander ancestor had replaced the proper label on its box with one that said simply “prickly wand, do not buy”. The wand that had chosen the younger Holmes brother had apparently been waiting for a wizard just as prickly and temperamental as itself. John’s own wand, made of oak-and-dragon-heartstring, was as solid and reliable as its wizard.
“Oh, this silly thing? It’s really nothing,” John said, not sure why he was embarrassed by it. “I got this Christmas card last year. Christmas Eve it came in, if you can believe that. Written by some school kid, probably because their teacher made them. But I liked the picture, and there was something funny about the date. I just sort of held onto it.” He fell silent, and when Mike didn’t reply, he began to feel a little odd. Unsure what to do next, he decided to show Mike the card.
“Fucking hell! He threw a knife at you!” John yelped, and launched himself at the suspect.
Hardly ideal, but: make do. Deal with these two, and then retrieve the stash of supplies that is (hopefully) still hidden in a hollow in another tree, then get out. Spite Mycroft with survival.
Police sirens blaring from the street wake me up, and I roll over to check my phone. Battery dead. I lean off the edge of the bed, fishing around on the floor for the charger, and plug it in. How long has it been dead for? What if?
The next section was supposed to be slow, but Sherlock played on as he he had before, shoving his bow across the strings too close to the bridge, catching on the other side a few times and causing the violin to shriek in protest. He rushed through the cantabile to the finale, his reddened, purpling fingertips flying over the silver and ebony. Long slashes of tarnished silver were written across his fingertips.
The conversation from eight months ago echoes in my mind, as though repetition could wring any meaning out of it. It hadn’t been six months after all. Sherlock, you liar. My eyes burn and I blink furiously. Sherlock, you bloody liar.
“We’re…walking into an ambush.”
Sherlock wrenched his hand away, knocking over the still-lit Bunsen burner in the process. He lunged the tap and turned off the gas just as it was beginning to scorch a long scar into the table.
“Lestrade is worried about you,” John said, setting the violin in its case. “Had a pint with him after work. He said you wouldn’t go give your statement earlier, that he had stopped by today.”
“What?” Sherlock said, nonplussed.
ohmygodohmygodohmygod
“It’s not…” Sherlock trailed off a bit, blushing.
2:33 AM
His stomach turned and he found himself scrabbling backwards with revulsion, the word NO screaming through his mind. He wasn’t conscious of actually screaming, but he must have, because a voice from behind him chuckled.
“You do,” Mike said with a chuckle. “Sherlock, meet John Watson. Old friend from Bart’s days.”
At any rate, there seemed to be nothing inherently offensive in the term, and (in his mind at least, never out loud) Sherlock had cautiously adopted it. The word glowed a bit when he thought of it, but Sherlock didn’t examine that particular feeling any more closely.
Sherlock broke into his stash of comfort chemicals. He knew John would not approve, but Lestrade had been insufferable with his implications and sly looks. He needed an outlet for his frustration and if he turned back to chemicals, well, he could hardly be blamed.
Not sure if you’re reading this or not JW
Highest priority: return to London with minimum delay, make contact with John. Capture (imprisonment? Likely, given Mycroft’s irritation about being wrong about anything for the first time in a decade) incompatible with this. Therefore imperative to avoid capture.
This message could not be delivered.
“Of course I’ll be your roommate, bumble. Starting tonight. ”
Panicking, Sherlock fled from the bathroom, his mind a white-hot mess. He found himself stopping in the middle of the kitchen.
The man got on with it.
Sherlock hummed in reply, not paying attention to the swaths of multicoloured lights and signs that covered every non-glass surface in the greenhouse, proclaiming MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY HANNUKAH and JOYOUS KWANZAA and EID MUBARAK, all in large, sparkling letters.
“Um,” John said eloquently, “then you mean you aren’t…” he trailed off, unsure how to finish the thought.
“Do you think someone took it while you were asleep?“ Dear God John, did he really not know he was doing this?
This message could not be delivered.
“Of course there are,” John said almost fondly, shaking his head. “Well, I will write to you. I’ll write every damn day.”
Sherlock released what sounded like a sigh of relief and let go of John’s hands. The doctor continued to slowly undress his best friend, kissing each patch of exposed skin as he went along. He stopped when he reached the button of Sherlock’s trousers, looking up as if to ask for permission.
It was the same pattern every day. Sherlock had previously been quite confident in his ability to tune out pain, but now his mastery over his body’s myriad weaknesses rose to new heights. He drew his consciousness deep into his mind palace while his captor did his work.
Sherlock looked at his watch as he took it off and placed it on an empty soap dish near the bathroom sink. His guest would arrive in approximately 10 minutes. Just enough time to prep his skin.
John thought as he forced down a strange lump creeping up his throat.
John didn’t realize he was gaping until Sherlock called his name a second time. “John, that gentleman over there is Brian Carruthers,” the detective explained. “He has been sketching me for the past 60 minutes.”
The next Thursday evening found Sherlock primping himself in front of the bathroom mirror. He was dressed in his favourite purple shirt and a pair of tight, black trousers. The detective was busy taming his curls with a styling mousse. He was expecting John to arrive any minute now.
Sherlock couldn’t imagine where that could possibly be. John often acted this way when he had a date lined up for the evening, but he had gone through John’s phone while he was showering after Sherlock had finished using up all the hot water, and there were no texts to indicate that he had a date or even a potential date.
Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe somewhere...
“You’re late!” Greg yelled this the instant John and Sherlock stepped into the room at NSY, causing John to wince and Sherlock to roll his eyes.
For a few moments, John simply hovered over Sherlock, nuzzling his hair, his nose, and his cheekbones before finally making a move to unbutton his friend’s purple shirt.
, John thought. He knew there were other, more productive ways to deal with his current emotional crisis but sod it. Right now he just wanted to hide in this obscure pub and have one-sided, telepathic conversations with the empty beer bottles in front of him.
John rolls his eyes. “I’m not having this conversation with a man in a Halloween costume,” he says. “Piss off.” He considers pulling out his gun, but dismisses the idea. No need to escalate this prematurely. Cosplay Moriarty doesn’t seem too stable. He’s swaying back and forth and half the time isn’t even pointing his pistol at John, Sherlock, or anything in particular.
“Breathe, Sherlock,” came John’s raspy whisper, his nose nuzzling Sherlock’s own. The detective was panting heavily, his body trembling under John’s touch.
Looks like you’ve shown your hand and not only to the denizens of Baker Street, so to speak. MH
“Do I even want to know how you know how I like my tea?”
“I need to do my exfoliating,” Sherlock said, trying to keep his voice level. “There’s a schedule.”
Yes, letting John know his secret had been a mistake of the highest order.  Sherlock fished his second-best Bunsen burner out from where John had attempted to hide it under the sink, attached it to the gas canister he had set out, and lit it.

I have carefully refused these thoughts in Sherlock’s presence as well as his absence; but here in the back seat of a taxi (sod waiting and sod Mycroft. Somehow he’s going to pay for this) I find myself unable to push the thought away--of having a life with Sherlock. Truly having--
That is apparently healthy enough a reply that she shuts the door and leaves. I have apparently thrown my phone at the wall (likely source of crash that summoned Sarah) and get up to retrieve it. The screen is cracked. Did not think I threw it that hard. I open the texting app again and stare at the non-message:
“Sherlock Holmes––do you have feelings for me?”
The man walked slowly over to the place on the floor where Sherlock had woken up and picked up the jar, shaking a small amount of something. (No, Sherlock insisted to himself. There is no need to pretend to deduce what is in that bottle. You know.) into the spoon. He uncapped the bottle and picked up the lighter, and Sherlock heard the hiss of the lighter fluid combusting. His body knew what was next even if his mind refused to acknowledge it and he forced himself not to look as the man drew the liquid up into the needle, then reached for the rubber band and turned around...
With impressive ease, John walked down the hall with six feet of detective in his arms. When they finally reached Sherlock’s room, John laid the taller man on the bed with painstaking tenderness.
“Doctor Watson, are you alright? I’m sorry I thought I heard a crash--“ Sarah’s opened the door, peeking through it at me with an expression of concern.
“Maybe you could ask Brian to be your new flatmate, too,” John blurted before turning around and walking out the door.
Sherlock could feel the warmth of him, even through his coat.

As always, a million thank yous to Unpopcultural, who beta read this chapter. THANK YOU <3 <3
Sherlock’s breath hitched at “eat something”, and he stared at John. John chuckled and pried Sherlock’s phone out of his hand, hit end call, and set it on the sofa.
“I am coming with you, and you are not facing
He tore a corner off the envelope and edged his thumb along it, keeping most of the envelope intact so that he could slide the card back in later to protect it.
“Tagging along with your boyfriend again, are you?” Anderson sneered, and Sherlock wondered if this time John might actually hit him. He could count on one hand the number of times he had seen John look this angry – but somehow John just smiled pleasantly at Anderson. This was deeply unsettling, and Sherlock said the only thing he could think of to restore some normalcy to the conversation.
If you're still with me after that hiatus, thank you for reading! I've been sitting on this chapter for about a week now...I wasn't quite satisfied with it when I first wrote it, and then family wedding/reunion made things pretty hectic. Anyway, here it is!
This mesage could not be delivered.
“As of five minutes ago he was examining a body near Kensal Green with DI Lestrade,” Mycroft said, the words precise and sharp as though he were reading.
Mycroft finds out he was wrong about something; rude texting ensues. Francophone!Sherlock being threatening.
“Oh,” John replied, tilting his head to the side. “D-did––did you cancel your date because we had a row? I––I’m sorry, Sherlock, I didn’t ––“
“Dear Sir,” the card read, and the writing inside was recognizably from the same hand as the person who had addressed the card, but while the address had been hastily scrawled, this was careful and precise. He read on.
Somehow, they had made it into the bathroom, and John pointed at the toilet. Unsure what to do, Sherlock sat.
The older man finally took pity and settled between the younger man’s thighs. In one fluid motion, he slowly pressed into Sherlock, drawing out loud moans from both of them.
“John, wait!” Sherlock attempted to say, but it came out somewhat slurred, and John ignored him in favor of head-butting him and then twisting the man’s knife-throwing arm behind his back.
The footsteps paused outside Sherlock’s bedroom door, then abruptly turned to the left as the bathroom door squeaked open. Sherlock listened carefully, but did not hear the latch fall into place. Well, then. The phrase “you’ve rather shown your hand there, Dr. Watson” echoed in his mind.
why is this so damn hard
Or had been, before John had bloody gone and hugged him, and patted his hair, and shushed him when he tried to ask what on earth was happening. This, the mind palace copy of Molly assured him, was a shade outside the realm of the standard bromance. The logical course of action at this point would be to gather more data and try to infer John’s meaning.
“No.” Sherlock’s eyes darted between John and the floor.
“That’s not possible,” Sherlock breathed, recognizing it instantly. “I sent that as a child.”
For a long moment they were both silent, and then John cleared his throat, his voice somewhat returned to normal.
“What does that have to do with anything?” John asked. “I swear Mycroft, I am tired of your word games. Just tell me whatever it is you stalked me to a pub to tell me.”
“What do you mean?” Sherlock wondered, his crystal blue eyes searching the other man’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’ve absolutely nothing to go on here, we need Sherlock,” Lestrade mutters into his coffee.
“Here’s how this is going to go,” Captain Watson said, drawing Sherlock’s attention back out of his mind palace. “You are going to go have a look in the basement windows, and come back and tell me if you think he’s home. If you think he’s out, we’ll go in, but if he’s there we’ll call Lestrade and wait for him to get here with backup.”
“Oh, sorry, Ryan. I’m late for office hours...Sherlock, we’ll have to discuss those pathology results another time,” Mike said, turning to walk with the student back to his office.
This is a shorter chapter, a bit of a teaser really. Sorry about that...the next one will (probably) be a lot longer. Cheers, and thanks for reading!
Sherlock glared at her, then spun on his heel and followed John out the door.
“Good. That’s—good.”
The nose from the kettle dropped off, saving Sherlock from making a reply that would otherwise be required. He fished a bag of tea out of the tin and dropped it into a cup, then unplugged the kettle and poured in the water.
A thick rubber band. A lighter. A spoon. A small jar. A needle.
The last one is different.
“Mm—John?” Sherlock asked, the vowels lazy and indistinct from sleep.
“Riding. We’re in a cab John, do keep up.”
John stood in front of him—too close, warm, warm warm—and pulled his arms through the Belstaff. The wool was torn where the knife had gone in.
“Hey. I would be honored,” he said, and leaned down to place a whisper of a kiss on Sherlock’s cheek. “Merry Christmas, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Are you?” Sherlock turned his back to John and busied himself with filling the kettle and switching it on.
“Hello, John,” drawled a very naked Sherlock who was spread out on the sofa. He was lying on his right side, his right arm bent under his head. His other arm was loosely hanging down his chest. Sherlock’s legs were slightly bent up, artfully covering his nether regions. It reminded John of a Watteau painting. The one with the sleeping Antiope. If only John had paid attention to his art history lessons in school.
Sherlock watched his tea steep. The water closest to the bag took on an orangey tint that gradually spread outwards, and as he poked it with a spoon it swirled into the rest of the cup. He glanced at the fridge and decided – no way to get the fridge open and the milk out without turning to look at John. He dropped the spoon and sopping tea bag in the sink, then gingerly took a sip.
“Damn straight.“ John put an arm around Sherlock’s waist (nope, not thinking about that, not the time, he ordered himself), hauled him to his feet for the second time, flopped one of Sherlock’s arms over his shoulders, and half-carried, half-dragged him through the door.
This mess
A silence settled around them, wove between them, and still Sherlock did not dare to look at John.
In the time it took John to cross to his armchair and settle in it, Sherlock was already asleep.
“It’ll do,” he said. One finger traced idly along the stitches, and Sherlock’s shiver had nothing to do with his failure at homeostasis.
“Look, I’m sorry, I’m going through some things,” I say lamely.
Not the same picture! Taken 3 days later. GL
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock made a strangled sort of noise and flung himself at John, wrapping his arms around John’s shoulders and burying his face in John’s neck in one swift movement. He murmured something that sounded suspiciously like “my only,” and before John could try to work out what he meant by that, his heart was beating wildly at the first press of cold lips against his neck.
It eventually became clear to Sherlock that withdrawal was not going to happen.
He slid the knife from Sherlock’s shoulder, causing him to gasp involuntarily, and wiped it on a handkerchief pulled from his pocket.
“Get out!” He yelled, brandishing his violin’s bow like a sword. “GO!”
“I’m sorry, I….I don’t know why I did that. I just…” Sherlock picked at the back of his hand, trying to get the words to arrange themselves in his mind.
He was spot on about those lights last week. The power had been cut to them, and Donovan thought to check the CCTV from the past couple days and found a recording of someone actually cutting the lines. Turns out we already had him in custody for a spot of vandalism and when Donovan told him about the CCTV he confessed the whole thing! Pushed that woman in front of the train, well, she was already dead of course, that was just the coverup.  GL
Sorry about the delay on this one....work has calmed down a bit and I hope to be posting more frequently.
“J-John,” Sherlock whined, the taut muscles of his stomach quivering with every breath. “P-pleathe,” he panted, a hint of desperation in his voice. “Pleathe, John.”
“Sherlock…I’m sorry,” John replied. “I thought…well. I’m sorry.” He passed over the bottle.
that would only grow in strength if he actually used the Sunday bottle that he had apparently grabbed on today, a Thursday, but Sherlock ignored it. He flicked the cap open, not paying attention to how much he put on his hand or the evenness of the layer of cream as smeared it across his face. It didn’t matter. He stared at the sink. How to fix this?
Too slow, they were both too slow, and if he didn’t get to that flat in Muswell Hill soon it was going to kill him.
John snorted. Sherlock giggled. Soon, both of them were laughing in each other’s arms.
For a few seconds, John and Sherlock locked eyes while they moved together. Sherlock was blown away by the love and desire that he found in John’s gaze, achingly sincere and open for him to see. Sherlock couldn’t hold back his tears. Before he even knew what was happening, his body shook violently and he felt himself screaming. The intensity of his orgasm almost knocked him unconscious.
Sherlock was aware that he had shivered, and forced himself to stop. Emotion would not help him here.
His fingertips over over the screen, debating. Answer? No. That would defeat the entire purpose. Shouldn’t be too much longer. Wait just a little longer, John.
“Sherlock, will you just be normal for five minutes and open it, you’ll like it, I promise.” Greg pushed the package at Sherlock, who took it reluctantly.
“Hey. It’s—I mean. You know it’s what I’ve wanted. That hasn’t changed.” John leaned into Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’ve been trying not to pressure you. I hope I haven’t been.”
“Yeah. Um, good,” John said.
Abandoning suspicion, he took a long draught. “Oh,” he breathed. “Greg, how did you get this?”
John thought as he glared at Empty Beer Bottle Number 1.
Sigh. “I’m sorry too, Sarah.”
Sherlock dared another glance at John through the window of his fingers. His face was very serious, and he cold anger seemed to have returned to his eyes.
Sherlock grabbed a sheaf of paperwork off the corner of Lestrade’s desk and shook it at him. “Didn’t you call us in here to fill these inane things out? Let’s get on it with so we can leave.”
Lestrade snorted. “No way. Anyone with eyes can see he’s head over heels for you.”
“Nope, we’re not doing that, Sherlock. Now you tell me everything you know or even think you know about this place, and when we get out of the cab you do exactly as I say and we may come out of this alive,” John commanded.
Sherlock’s next breath caught in his throat.
Sherlock took a few more sips, then pressed his closed lips to John’s arm in reverence.
Sherlock swallowed them both dry before the last consonant was even out of John’s mouth.
“I’m pretty sure you will once you look at Mr. August,” Donovan snickered. “Or should I say,
autocorrect, where are you when I need you? Finally I manage to get out
Sherlock soon learned that the man responsible for his captivity was possessed of limited creativity. Sherlock felt confident that he could have devised much more painful and interesting tortures using the implements the man had employed thus far. This thought, and a few others, helped to keep him sane in the weeks that followed his awakening in the dank room.
Welcome to day 6 of Seasonal Fucking Cheer:  "What? The heat's not working?"
“I don’t like to see you all cold,” John murmured, his other hand on the back of Sherlock’s head, holding him in place. “You felt the way I’d always imagined you would be after you fell, and…” John swallowed; the dizziness of his thoughts had nothing to do with blood loss, he knew that for certain. “I had two years to imagine it. How cold you…it’s…too real,” he finished. “Please, Sherlock, for me. Don’t be cold.”
John and Sherlock arrive home after misadventures at the NSY Christmas Party, and someone has left them a gift.
“It’s all right, Sherlock,” John interjected. “You had a point, you know? I shouldn’t be meddling with your love life when my own is so depressing,” the older man chuckled, his anger transforming into bitter resignation.
John and Other John had a solid hold on the suspect, and dragged him over to where Sherlock sat. Other John said something, and John stuck his hand out to Sherlock, who flinched back. He mustn’t find out.
Molly was out, but she had either had the consideration to leave the lab unlocked or was tired of him picking the locks, and Sherlock spread out the array of sample bags on the slate-epoxy counter and settled in front of his favorite microscope. The Dirt Survey, as Sherlock called it, was on his schedule of experiments that he repeated annually. The various parks around London each had their own characteristic soil (and possibly more importantly, pollen) compositions and on more than one occasion, being able to determine that the mud on a suspect or victim’s person belonged to one park and not another had been the difference between a conviction and a mere hunch. He found a fresh box of slides and cover slips in a drawer and set them beside the microscope. He divided each baggie into three samples, tipped a bit of the first Regent’s Park sample onto a fresh slide, began looking through it for pollen.
“Sherlock, are…are you alright?”
If I knew that I’d probably know who made it but that’s your job to find out, detective inspector JW.
How else could he rationalize to himself his response when John had appeared in his cell, looking every bit the part of the dashing rescuer?
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
No, no what if. If (WHEN, some part of my mind insists, he said WHEN not if when he left) he comes back it’s going to be like last time, appearing out of nowhere, all barely concealed glee at his newest disguise, crowing about how long he’s been following me around without me noticing--
Sherlock felt this was not going well. He had expected that John would be upset at him for disappearing again. Or ask him about the text messages. Or be angry that Sherlock had not included him in his mission.  Not that “John getting angry with him” was what he meant by “going well“. This entire train of thought was not going well either, and Sherlock gave up on it and held his arm out to John.
“Sorry,” he said, feeling the heat rising in his cheeks. “I didn’t—I didn’t mean to take so much.”
Sherlock fished in the pocket of his dressing gown, and when he fingers found the little bee clips, he stuck them in his hair, pinning the longest curls away from his face, and set to work.
John paused on top of the stairs for a moment, trying to collect himself for a possible confrontation with Sherlock but the flat seemed quiet. He gingerly opened the door and found the living room empty. Letting out a relieved breath, John slowly approached the center of the room, touching things and looking around at the bits and pieces that made 221B home. But John knew it wasn’t the odd knick-knacks that made this flat special. It was a person. One particular person.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and tried to brush a stray hair from his face, succeeding only in smearing a swipe of floury dough across his temple. This did not add dignity to the situation.
Sherlock looked from the letter in his hand to John’s miserable expression, smiling somewhat as he touched the words he had written twenty-four years earlier, and privately made a decision.
At some point Sherlock became aware that John was petting his hair and that the flat had become stiflingly hot, and he drew back, dabbing at one or two stray drops of blood in John’s elbow.
I’m not daydreaming about it or anything! It’s not like that. (Is it like that, with him, ever, with anyone? How would I know?) I’m just sketching out an idea, just getting a plan in place so I can do what I need to do if the situation comes up. I mean, I’ve always got a few things on hand at Baker St. Just being practical. With his line of work I never know what condition he’s going to show up in.
“What, like Secret-Keeping?” John asked. “Isn’t that a little…I dunno, overkill?”
He started taking long walks, initially only because the physiotherapist said that it might be good for his limp, but he continued because he was starting to like it. He had a routine: Hyde Park in the morning, Regent’s Park in the late afternoon. He got to know where to expect the swans, and after that started paying more attention to the woods around him and walking more quietly. He was able to see a trio of hedgehogs one morning, and one evening, after sitting very still on a bench that was somewhat off the main paths, he got a glimpse of a fox.
he thought
One patient, an agitated 5-year-old with chickenpox, actually tried to bite off his thumb. John shook his head and smiled despite his exhaustion.
“I got shot.” John swallowed. He wasn’t sure he liked where this was going.
“We really do,” John replied.
“Mr. Holmes?” A deep voice inquired as Sherlock opened the door. The man was about Sherlock’s height. He had a lean and slightly muscular physique. His auburn hair was styled in a messy, shoulder-length cut. It was clear to see that the man was fairly attractive.
“Your temperature seems fine this morning,” John noted. “Any chance of me getting a look at those stitches? I’m worried that I was too keyed up to put them in straight last night.”
He became more familiar with the less-popular, narrower, back paths of the parks that were more protected from the city noises and found himself spending more and more time sitting in stillness on a bench or patch of grass, watching the brush, waiting to see an elusive stoat or hedgehog or fox. He started seeing them more and more often, and then he wondered if they were showing themselves because they were getting used to him, or if they had been there all along.
“What’s what?” John asked.
“Sherlock, wait,“ John said. “Did—did you take your pills this morning?”
“Probably not,” Sherlock answered absently, his attention focused on the pocket of John’s jacket where he knew the letter would be. “Anyway. The letter.”
John was pulled from this dangerous train of thought by Sherlock’s lamp-like eyes, which were suddenly very close to John’s own.
I'm turning into a huge fan of Dr. Yildiz. She's vaguely based on a sister-in-law of mine (i have 7) who, while not a biochemist, is smart and takes no shit from anyone.
But at this stage of the game...to crudely shoot them out of a forest would be inelegant, barbarous. Someone would find the bodies, eventually, remote as these ruins were. The bullets might be analyzed. Of course Mycroft was meticulous, gave him a type of rifle that is common in the Balkans and rather rare elsewhere, but still. Shooting them would leave open the possibility that something, however small, could be traced back to the Home Office, creating yet another mess that an accountant might choose to dump on his unfortunate younger brother. No, better to deal with this in a more tidy way.
John figured that he must have fallen asleep during Arithmancy, because the next he was aware, the classroom was empty and he was cradling Sherlock’s wand embarrassingly to his chest. His other arm stung and seemed to be asleep from leaning his head on it for too long.
ar you readng ths  jW
“That’s not how schedules work, John,” Sherlock snapped back, seeing no reason to keep his very real irritation from his voice.
if he said it the same way it’s because he meant it the same way
“Does. Does it bother you that I--” John asked hastily.
Thanks for reading <3
John knelt down beside Sherlock and pulled a flashlight out of his doctor’s bag. “I should have checked you over first thing. You’ve lost a lot of blood, haven’t you.“ It wasn’t a question.
“Tell me what you need,” John said.
“What is it?” Tired as he was, John was mildly curious. There was nobody back home who was likely to write to him--his parents were long dead, no close cousins, and Harry--well. Harry probably was too drunk to know what month it was, let alone what day.
Once more, with feeling: if, now that you have read this, you feel that there are other tags/warnings that are appropriate, please tell me asap! I don't want to blindside anyone.
He turned slowly, stiffly, and faced Mike Stamford, whom he hadn’t seen since their graduation from Bart’s.
A light was on in one corner, just barely visible around a particularly large pizza box pillar, and Sherlock hummed to himself. Perfect. They would go in, John could tackle him or something, and they would handcuff him to the doorframe and be on their way home to Baker Street and pills with plenty of time to spare.
To be continued...the outline that I have includes one more chapter, so I've finally changed the /? to an /4. See you soon (probably over in my potterlock fic Hail Thee, Festival Day because I just read Cursed Child and. I just have So Many Feelings about it.)
“You know what,” John replied. “Where is best? I’m assuming you’ve done this before.”
John glances over at Sherlock, who immediately tries to look innocent and not at all like someone who is eavesdropping intently on his conversation with Lestrade.
“Um. No. But it’s not not-helping?” Sherlock replied. He leaned over to the counter and added the last of the cherries and raisins, then craned his neck back to look at John. “I need to put this in the oven.”
“Shut up.”
Sherlock attempts to question Dr. Yildiz. It doesn't go well (for him)
Scaret fever scare at the surgery today. Fortunately just a weird flu. JW
John realized.
“You know something, and you’re going to tell me what it is,” John replied.
“I have a soft spot for artists, I suppose,” Sherlock smiled, hoping that his answer was convincing enough for John.
As far as sneaking into the EU was concerned, he was pretty sure he had the ideal route already mapped out in his mind. The difficult part would be the five straight days of walking (twenty hours by car, if he could hitchhike the whole way, but that could not be counted upon) to a port town in Turkey, chosen for the proliferation of tourists that would be present there at this time of year. Busy enough with tourists that a  man speaking with received pronunciation attempting to rent a boat would be assumed to be a sport fisher(especially once he had gathered the necessary fishing accessories, secondhand so that he would look appropriately dedicated to fishing) rather than an asiring illegal immigrant to the EU. Ideal for his purposes, once that tiny detail of the inconvient thousand kilometers across Turkey were crossed.
“I don’t know what all you two get up to with chasing criminals, and Lestrade let that last one go, didn’t he?” Mrs. Hudson handed Sherlock a biscuit and sat down beside him on the sofa. “Budge up there, you.”
“Hmm.” Sherlock pulled his phone out, fishing through the settings menu for…there. “How many messages have there been so far? And how much time passed between messaged? And did any of you have the foresight to record any of these? Were they all the same, or different messages each time? We’ll have to wait for another anyway…but…” Sherlock trailed off, looking at Lestrade expectantly.
“I—no, but you don’t have to…” Sherlock pulled the duvet back up, covering his neck and shoulders. “I mean, I didn’t expect you to still want…”
John reluctantly followed Sherlock around the corner, and they climbed the ladder, Sherlock first, John watching and cringing as with each step, the narrow metal rungs dug into the burned, stiff skin of Sherlock’s feet. Seventeen steps later, John was crowded up behind Sherlock, standing on the rung directly below him and reaching up to push open the heavy iron plate that was the only thing remaining between them and escape.
“Well, I’m terrified, John! I’ve never felt this way before!”
“Oh, Sherlock…” he flicked his wand, taking control of the petal again. It drifted to Sherlock’s face, who though he eyed it warily, allowed the petal to float closer and to dab the tears that threatened to spill from his eyes. “I know it’s been a hard year for you.”
John crumpled with a shout of pain, barely managing to keep his feet with the aid of his cane.
“All I’m saying is––just be sure about this Brian guy before you––b-before you commit to anything, okay?” John offered, licking his lips. “Don’t let him hurt you.”
“You’ll recall that there is, in fact, no password or indeed no security of any kind on the door to Hufflepuff tower,” Sherlock said archly. “Besides, if my pestilential brother intended you ill he would have acted already. Really, you should just move in with me. You know I don’t have roommates.”
Suddenly, Sherlock’s trembling hands covered John’s––as though in a half-hearted attempt to stop the amorous proceedings. The former soldier glanced up at the other man’s face. Sherlock looked like he wanted to say something––but the words seemed stuck in his throat.
He sniffed. “This isn’t coming out right. I’m—”
“I don’t care.” John was shouting now.
“Not at first. Not without a little--” the man paused, his flat smile reaching a little to his eyes. He stood up from the chair and walked over to where Sherlock was sitting, taking his time until he stood behind Sherlock.
“I can’t imagine what you are referring to,” Sherlock said stiffly. “I’m sure you’ve done nothing at all.”
Sherlock took a deep breath. The universe was clearly conspiring to ruin his life.
Sherlock put his hands over his face and looked up, peeking at John from between his fingers. John’s face was red, and his eyes were angry, cold. This was it, then. The end of everything.
“Whatever,” Donovan said, and rolled her eyes. “But it is weird you’re here without him.”
“Er…right. Tomorrow, then.” Lestrade backed out the door, keeping a wary eye on the detective.
Sherlock nodded. “Every other day, yes, that will keep the cold away. And. I. Yes. To the other part. Thank you.”
A door slammed.
NSY Pub night. You coming? GL
“Oi, what took you two so long?” Lestrade called out upon noticing them from across the floor.
“What we did yesterday, was that good for you?” John asked, and somehow he had moved to stand very close to Sherlock very quickly.
John rolled his eyes. “If you actually drink that I will be shocked.”
“This place is never open,” Sherlock said. “Look around. There are unique strains of at least ten different poisonous plants in here, all designed in-house. Security on this greenhouse is tight.”
“Sherlock, wait.“ John gently peeled Sherlock’s hand off of his arm, holding the Hufflepuff’s hand in both of his for a moment, before turning to walk in the opposite direction, towards Gryffindor tower. He caught a glance of Sherlock’s face, and what he saw there reminded him of how terrified he himself had felt years ago, when he had first said
He didn’t hear the door the next time it opened.
They walked a few blocks in silence.
“Sherlock, I can’t just move into Hufflepuff tower. I actually am in a different house,” John replied.
When he was sure that John was fast asleep, Sherlock went to the bathroom but left the door slightly ajar. He started to take off his clothes until he was wearing nothing but his trousers––and what a flattering pair of trousers they were. Bespoke. Expensive. The kind that hung low on his hips but hugged his figure just right. The fabric did wonders for his thighs and his lovely derriere.
This finally got Sherlock’s attention. He turned to his side to give John a strange look.
“I’ve already got us both tea, yours is just with milk how you like it, over here,” Sherlock replied, steering John towards a table beside a heater.
From Herbology, it was a short walk to Quidditch practice.
Of bloody course it couldn’t be. The little blue blob with the non-answer, always popping up in the same shape after I send my text to nobody that nobody will ever see. If someone went through my phone they’d see a little army of them after everything I send, all the same, like ants in a row, except for
age could not be delivered.
As always, I'll repeat my call for beta readers: I'm getting back into writing fanfic after a several year break, so if anyone wants to beta read I will seriously consider all offers!
John’s impulse was to jerk his hand away but he forced himself to stay still, and after a moment the sharp sting lessened, and he could swear—was Sherlock humming, a little?
“I didn’t have a date last night,” John said wearily. “And I really wish you would drop this. Don’t mention it again in front of Sherlock.”
“I believe you have something of mine, Doctor Watson,” Cosplay Moriarty says in an imitation of Moriarty’s singsong accent.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you,” Sherlock said, his voice barely audible, his eyes very wide. “She bragged about it, what she’d done to you.” He paused. If John didn’t already know….but surely he suspected? If he said those words, it would be the death knell of their friendship. Surely no one could forgive a thing like that. No one should have to.
“There,” Sherlock said, waving the card around. John was startled to realize that he still had it--normally if the card was away from him for so long he began to feel anxious, but he was surprised to realize that it didn’t bother him at all that Sherlock was still holding the card. “It’s Christmas next week, I’m going. Come with me.”
When Sherlock was finally, completely naked, John took a moment to sit back and drink in the magnificent beauty before him. Sherlock’s graceful form was all long lines and lean muscle. His elegant legs seemed to go on for miles. John let his hand wander up one shapely leg until it reached the milky smoothness of Sherlock’s quivering thigh––and then he reached higher, tracing the detective’s Adonis belt with his thumb, intentionally avoiding the very place where John knew Sherlock needed him the most.
There. He had said it, and the first friendship of his short life was now over. If his shoulders shook only a little he would have never admitted it.
He had had the text reply, the one he couldn’t make himself actually set as an automatic reply--so that every time John texted him, he was there, fingers blurring over the touchscreen, always writing the same reply. Sometimes it had been a few minutes before he was able to do it--and every time he wondered if John would work it out. If he was timing how long it took for the non-message to get through. Sherlock doubted that, though but lately it had simply gotten too difficult to keep up the farce. After four days on the boat, skirting the southern coast of Europe in his guise as a vacationing fishing aficionado, between the sun and the not-enough food and the aching in his ankle that still had not gone away, something had driven him to make a more obvious move, to give himself away. Not that he had thought sending it from a clone of the original phone would make any difference at all in the end, not with Mycroft with his horrible web, watching at the periphery like a spider--but he had hoped that he might have a bit longer before Mycroft caught on.
The second warning was the thin fold with a staple in the middle along the first edge that he revealed as he tore off a strip of paper.
