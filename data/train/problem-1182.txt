“It’s not hearsay if you’re saying it it’s as good as gospel; just spit it out,” John interrupts while Sherlock continues talking.
And then the words come to him. "You are," he admits because his hand is forced and he can't have Sherlock thinking he's anything less, despite the glaring obviousness he's incriminating himself by saying things like this out loud. Normally he would have more reservations, speaking so blatantly on matters much better left unsaid. But now all he can think is 'please think anything but that-'
“Is it?” Sherlock returns in a tone of piqued intrigue, very full of himself. Then his eyes shift to the edge of his field of vision and he looks surprised, some fine, irregular detail catching his interest.
Sherlock finds himself marveling at the ineptitude of the average Homo sapien. “Come on, Lestrade. The number that follows seventy-eight thirty-four,
in front of you,” he reels vehemently. It is one of those rare occasions where Sherlock seems to be at a loss for a witty response, or, in fact, any response at all.
What appears to be a hint of annoyance flickers in its eyes, darkening on its features and casting shadows on its face, deepening into a look of frustration. Its eyes become as ominous as they are enigmatic, malcontent with inexplicability- as if he were as unexplainable to
Sherlock shakes his head and rolls his eyes, head leaning on his hand. Portrait of a man resigned to his inevitable fate- boredom. He reaches for his phone to curb his symptoms.
, Sherlock is showing only the tip of the iceberg of his anger, and even that much is daunting enough to make John feel like he's treading ice. But he objects at the look of censure Sherlock is giving him, like John is completely out of line with no reasonable justification whatsoever.
Finally the creature's questions are in part answered, but rather to his disappointment. When the structure bursts alight with flame just before nightfall, it's extremely anticlimactic. He rolls his eyes sardonically, completely unsurprised. What was he expecting? This is what humans do. Set fire to things. Perhaps they find it cathartic. They have, on rare occasion, even set fire to the ocean.
Sherlock looks back down at the newspaper fine print. They don't broach the subject again until Sherlock is called on for a case.
“Who are you talking to?” they inquire contemptuously. Mary rolls her eyes in annoyance at their approaching interloper. Sherlock steps toward the gate again to get a look at the child who has summoned their attention.
” he says just softly enough to miss. It comes across distracted, as some off-beat, stray thought that Mary barely manages to catch. While Mary struggles to discern whether she heard him right, Sherlock redirects his attention to her, returning with improved clarity and diction.
Undeterred, she draws out a chair and takes a seat at the game board. “I'll tell you what, if you win I will walk over to Scotland Yard right now and turn myself in,” she says brazen-faced, twirling a dark pawn in her fingers. A stroke of inspiration glints in her eyes and her smile curves steadily upward. “Or better yet, I'll tell you how I did it."
“Can we wake him up now?” Mary complains, hearing Sherlock enter the flat. She’s lying on her side next to John on the sofa, back turned, hands flattened together and placed under her ear like a pillow. John himself is lying on his good shoulder, having wedged himself into the cease of the backboard, clothed in day-old office attire and a tie he hasn’t bothered remove.
It'd been a relief to discover she was no longer within their crosshairs. Had they found her, John doesn't know what he might've done.
“I haven’t the faintest,” he sighs with disinterest, his bow resuming its oscillations. He twists the fine adjustment knobs at the base of the fingerboard while playing two strings, then reverts back to the coarse pegs at the top, finally bothering to set the Stradivarius in tune.
He calls for him to wait, reaching for his shoulder, when suddenly the caped man turns and grips him by the neck with a gloved hand, slamming the soldier back against the stone wall. The soldier looks back at him with wide, startled eyes, completely taken off guard when after a couple months on the war-torn front he'd thought he'd seen everything. As the gaslight glances off his form, the soldier can see he has the ethereal complexion of a ghost, like he's never seen the light of day. What's more, he looks like something that walked out of the last century, a Victorian blouse with a ruby-pinned cravat beneath his vest.
He feels extremely wary of it all. It's a dangerous thing to go chasing after hopes that can't be sustained.
Sherlock is leaning above him, cradling more and more of his weight, and John feels himself swaying backward, their noses aligned, touching so that he’s staring down the end of Sherlock’s nose, not his own. It’s ridiculous. The more John tries to avoid him, the further Sherlock leans in, constantly nudging John back. It’s flirtation, really, it is.
"Indeed. It's how she can control people, get them to jump off buildings, etcetera. That was how we lost her childhood psychologist, Thomas Hartley."
"We don't kill criminals, we bring them to justice. If you went out and killed her I'd have you arrested for it."
Sherlock furrows his eyebrows because John is being odd and light-headed. It doesn't occur to him his word choice was misleading or ambiguous at best. John twists around in Sherlock’s arms to meet his eyes.
“You lucky devil,” he smiles ruefully, his expression one of blatant adoration, and Sherlock reflects back immaculately, a splitting image of requital, what looks damn-near like weakness, mortal weakness, flickering faintly in the far reaches of those dark spheres. But that’s something sociopaths do isn’t it— feigning mutuality with mimicry.
“How do you calculate that?” she asks in dismay, “He won’t even talk to me. I’m resigned to say he just hates me.”
"You really like your profession don't you?" she asks, returning to casual conversation like she didn't just confess to one of the worst killing sprees of the newly-minted millennium, "These images don't bother you?"
Rose follows in thoughtful silence, then says, "Maybe he was so egomaniacal he thought he couldn't get killed."
"Why do you have so much faith in her and so little in me?" John wants to know in earnest, "Why don't you trust me?"
She catches sight of something amongst the cacophony of images splayed out on the table. One photo stands out amongst the rest to her. He watches her pick it up, the look of shock on her face apparent and unguarded. But it's more than just shock. The slowness with which she peals it away from the rest, inch by inch, is magical to watch-- like the pictures are an old jigsaw puzzle and she's fitting the last piece into place.
He turns on his heel and walks off, leaving the two of them to suffer the whiplash of his complete 360. He'd so quickly cut them off with an eerie, forced civility, it gives Anderson the hibbie jeebies thinking about it. Sherlock rarely gave up that easily- it was like he'd just flipped the emotional off switch in his robotic brain and walked off- it was just
"Did you do this in that kitchen of yours you call a lab? It's not admissible," Anderson says, tossing the photocopy back onto the desk, into the metaphorical reject pile.
It occurs to him that is kind of what he's doing. He shakes his head, amused. "I am. Keep on like that and you're liable to turn all the women into serial rapists that obsess over you."
“Sherlock, it has been twenty, years. ” he breathes, eyes severe, dark, unforgiving ultramarine, “Her entire lifetime- she has grown up, believing you, believing that you are who you said, that you are her parent.
“Enough of that. I’ve had it with your delusions and paranoia and pleas of insanity. You actually almost killed yourself, do you know that?” Sherlock snaps, sounding like a CO, even paternal. The anger in his voice seems to get through to John.
"Sherlock?" he asks but it warrants no response, just a cavernous, resentful silence in which one might hear their own echo. "You're shaking."
Sherlock's phone chimes and he looks down at the screen, relaying a text from Lestrade with details of the latest body to drop. Sherlock gets up to retrieve his coat from the hanger, tossing it over his shoulders.
"It was just a joke," Anderson says in his defense. Needless to say, crime scene humor often is in poor taste.
“It does, doesn’t it?” Sherlock mutters, head propped against the arm of the sofa and arms extending forward, tilting his head and the photograph at various angles thoughtfully.
“Sir, are you alright?” John asks, kneeling down to take his pulse. He appears to be a few years past middle-aged with whitening hair, but otherwise in seemingly healthy condition.
The ground starts spinning under his feet, and his legs buckle. He puts his hands over his eyes, tries to subdue the ringing in his head.
“Holy mother of god. Is that what you thought?” Sherlock remarks in feigned disbelief, taking a draft of sparkling wine.
His mind scrambles to think what it could mean by that kind of look, his eyes frantically searching that blaze of emerald green, but part of him knows he’s playing stupid, trying to contain the gnawing feeling that he already knows what it wants, all too familiar with that kind of look to not recognize it when he sees it.
She tries dangling the carrot closer to his nose. "All you have to say is yes." He opens his mouth but no words come out. His expression is really quite priceless, every inch of him struggling, and despite it all, he's still trying to pretend he isn't.
After all he had done the same thing not 24 hours earlier- repressed every natural emotion and reaction until all that was left was a rancorous demeanor and a few cutting, biting remarks- effectively suppressing the trauma until it was ironed out into a tame, picture-perfect semblance of
. They burn with a dangerous kind of curiosity, boring into his soul like a Pandora’s box of destructive potential waiting to be unleashed, harboring paradoxes that make him want to shake his head in incomprehension. They seem as if to ask how can you be as close as possible and still not close enough?
He steps out tavern's backdoor, where only business of a seedy, clandestine nature need take place, and he catches sight of the caped man's ominous silhouette receding down the alleyway. Upon breaching his lips, the unearthly chill in the air burns in his lungs, making his skin tingle and hair stand on end.
"Or would you have me kneel down and tell you how I'm sorry, how I regret everything, how I would give anything to have you back? Something along those lines?"
“It’s no use, you know. He won’t eat it,” John sighs, picking up his box of indispensible jumpers. He’s half convinced Sherlock has taken up a hunger strike just to get him to come back home. Rummaging through the box's contents, he sees that the Christmas jumper with the red collar is missing. He glares accusatively at Sherlock, splayed out on his armchair.
“He is!” she yells, flustered. Thankfully, Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind the potentially disruptive increase in volume.
"No, I don't know what you're talking about and alas, I've lost all interest. As far as I'm concerned the only problem is
Without any warning, Mary kisses his girlfriend in front of him for a seasonable length of time, then leaves the pair of them aghast and wide-eyed as she walks off.
“What is wrong with you? How can you be content not knowing whether you’re married— to me no less?” John demands, uncomprehending, “Don’t you remember famously deducing our daughter's--
“Are those tears supposed to be for Sherlock?” he says. That hits a raw nerve and earns him some biting words and a drop kick out of the building.
, in bed with her. You might as well be sleeping with her." As the accusations get wilder, John's eyes flit to the slipper where he usually stashes his narcotics, starting to wonder if all this is really because he's been dabbling again, "Maybe you are, for all I know."
“I want you to take me in for all that, like you tried to do before- remember? I’ll give you whatever you need, please just take me in,” the elder pleads.
“Why not?” John wants to know, leaning on one locked elbow with a fawning expression on his side-cast face.
“Of course its for selfish reasons. This is classic manipulative behavior, the hallmark of any self-respecting sociopath. He wants me to think he isn't one but I am not liable to make that mistake again.”
He heads through security, that is, the legal way. The number of security personnel has ramped up significantly from last time, although they don't give him much trouble, which is likely a byproduct of Mycroft's influence and the fact they already have him in their system. He can't imagine they get many visitors.
Emotional distress? After a brief spell of shock, he’s amused, his lips bending upward into a smirk.
“Look, I don’t wish her wrath on anybody, not even you,” Mr. Davenport adds in what is supposed to be an attempt at mitigation and plods off, leaving Sherlock a little aghast. What is it with these people? Maybe they think he exudes AIDS.
“Gotten himself a new girlfriend, as it turns out,” he remarks disinterestedly, outstretching his hands with a shrug. He flops down on the shuffled sofa cushions and picks up John’s newspaper, reads the introduction upside-down, then throws it over his head on the vacant portion of the settee, for what little the hell being raised about taxes is worth to him. His legs are tangled over the green, leather curve of sofa arm, and he stares idly at the ceiling, curls a jumble on the leather.
"My god, you're a fantastic shot," Lestrade remarks once he arrives on scene, admiring John's handy work. He and the rest of NSY have simply assumed he's his sister, Harry.
He swallows, glancing toward the door. "Perhaps we ought not to be doing this here," he says evasively, "If someone came in-"
But then, inexplicably, he suddenly feels at a loss, short of breath and helplessly, powerlessly overwhelmed by him, even though Sherlock hasn’t so much as lifted a finger. It’s as if Sherlock’s word is somehow law, or worse even, fact, with the power to disarm him, take him apart like a kitchen appliance, take his piece apart and reassemble it with filled carrots for cartridges— god, if he did pick a fight, it wouldn’t be a fair one, would it?
She stands and follows him as he fumbles backward in a series of ungraceful steps, backing him into the wall. He doesn't understand why he's reacting like this.
His transport protests when her hands start to take certain liberties under his blazer, but he ignores its objections. He insists to himself that it's fine, that it's alright to lend his transport over to her like this when the gains so far outweigh the cost. A moment's discomfort for a lifetime sentence should be a fair bargain, particularly when the alternative would be her getting away with it all. But this puts even his resolve to the test.
“Might be difficult for someone with trust issues,” Sherlock admits, finding it significantly harder to breathe with John’s wingspan wrapped around him like an anaconda.
“And my hands are where?” Sherlock eventually returns, analyzing the new arrangement like it’s a Tetris puzzle and.. possibly having an Asperger’s moment.
Issuing a sigh, John lets it drop and comes as he's beckoned, sitting next to him. "I didn't want to interrupt. The way you play is so beautiful," John says, drawing a line across the black, glossy surface. "I didn't know you knew piano."
"What, do people not usually point that out to you?" John demands, irked. "God is the male ego really this fragile?" he contemplates to himself, following him out the door. For the love of- Was this what women had to deal with all the time? It was utter garbage.
That does it. John grips him by the collar and pulls him downward so that they are face to face, practically vibrating with anger. He has half a mind to lock Sherlock up in an ivory tower somewhere where he will never see the light of day if that's what it takes to stop him from putting himself in danger for stupid reasons.
John obeys and Sherlock walks away from him in a temper, then stops still. John looks at him, confused because there seems to be something coming out of his back, seeping onto his shirt.
can shut up now,” Sherlock throws her words back at her with a smirk, though he is clearly more annoyed with himself than his dance partner. As they continue waltzing, he directs most of his attention to Mary, but is continuously aware of John’s presence beyond the corners of his vision, and absently wonders how much of their conversation John might have heard.
"How may I be of service?" Mycroft asks with his usual, insufferable drawl. Sherlock rolls his eyes.
. John clenches his fist, turns his neck away from his hand with reserved tension. “You can’t give me.”
“He gave me a check and told me to give it Mrs. Hudson, but first to cash it in, take hundred off the top and go buy something called Mal- Malboro?” she says, taking a seat at the counter with a bowl in hand for cereal.
“Boyfriend?” Sherlock hazards uncertainly, hands merged together and face turning partway in John’s general direction. John closes his eyes as he responds with unerring control.
“Well..” He muses though he already has the answer, then steals a glance at Mary. “If Mary says so,” he smiles, taking her in his hands so they are nose to nose, “Didn’t you say so, darling?”
Sherlock is gazing deep into John’s eyes when he makes the startling confession "I don't think this is waltz," confiding in his partner yet another spectacular deduction.
"There was a time when you would look like that because of me," he eventually, very reluctantly explains, his hands bearing down on the back of the wooden chair next to his desk. It creaks in disapproval under his clenched fists, "Now you've abandoned all of the abilities you once lauded me for in favor of my
“I agree it’s kind of..” Sherlock mutters, a little off kilter, struggling to place what exactly the vague, hypnotic vibe is, coming off the motions they’re going through. Maybe Sherlock left some lethal chemical out to dry that’s making them fuzzy.
“Oh, I calculate he’ll come. He’s wrestling with the fact he’s not the love of your life. He’ll get over it,” Sherlock replies, all nonchalance.
Of course, he couldn't be sure whether the illusion of a date would be enough to draw her out. There was a distinct possibility she was already in the wind, on a flight to some unbeknownst continent with a shot of port in hand.
“Explain your reasoning,” he says and Mary looks surprised, even confused he’s asking such an obvious question.
As he continued to follow the him, not even hearing the angry honks as he commandeered the crosswalks, gradually his suspicions were confirmed. John was headed to the Diogenes club with the intention of seeing his brother, which was fine, perfectly fine, not that it was consuming his every waking thought or anything. One car screeched to a halt six inches from him and was rear-ended by another. When the drivers started yelling abuse at each other, causing something of a scene, Sherlock simply ignored them and walked around, more pressing matters on hand.
She places a hand under his jaw and directs his face back to her. His jaw slackens at the overpowering extent at which her eyes burn at him, fierce, envious. He returns the look with confusion, a touch taken off guard and not certain what she's after.
The way he was was a crime- he never resorted to his baser instincts, he never deigned to violence, he was not crippled by the lesser passions that afflicted most people. He could not be corrupted by money or sex, bribed, bought, or blackmailed.
The gentle breeze and reassuring waves calm him and he tries to forget the insidious machinations of his mind, thinking of other things less morbid. He doubles back along the coastline, his ventures uneventful, and the morning lags on.
He releases Sherlock's collar which he hadn't realized he had grabbed, and shakes his head, defeated. "Damn it, Sherlock. You don't understand. I-" John looks down at him, wanting to call him so many things,
"How did this happen?" he says after a long silence, the warmth of his breath casting fog into the air, "I don't understand. Any of this. I thought that- I thought for sure he-"
"You're so perfect," she says in a low growl, fully aware of how uncomfortable the comment makes him, twisting knots in his stomach. "God I want to ruin you," she breathes, her fingers insinuating in his hair. He closes his eyes in silent prayer, trying to keep calm and collected despite the PTSD. It makes her want to laugh.
“Oh hello John,” Sherlock beams, stepping in his way just as he’s about to start in their direction, “Did you want a dance as well? I’m afraid you just missed her,” he says as if he had no hand in it. “I think it best not to interrupt at this point but you can still dance with me if its all the same to you.”
"The more you talk, the less it seems like you have any understanding of what forensic science actually is."
Mary puts the sugar on the counter and scampers over to her father, checks his pulse and shrugs. Sherlock’s eyebrows furrow in consternation. He races over to check his pulse, two fingers flying to his jugular. John's pulse isn't quite as elevated as Sherlock's, but normal, all the same. He sighs half in relief, half in annoyance he actually fell for that, and Mary flashes him a cheeky grin. Sherlock rolls his eyes.
Now she's literally just saying things to get a rise out of him. He glares at the thinly-veiled sarcasm, irritation festering inside him at how that is exactly what's happening. No one believes him. Bureaucratic pressures have culminated in rendering her untouchable. She smiles with satisfaction when his hands tighten almost imperceptibly at his sides at her behest, having struck a nerve. He clenches his jaw, not sharing in her amusement.
He full-heartedly agrees. "You're right. So why don't we skip to the part where you show me how you did it?"
The chimera watches in the shallows as the human recovers, gradually gets his bearings. The man slowly starts to panic for some unknown cause, skirting the beach, searching for god knows what, threading his fingers in his hair. By the time his rounded the beach for the third time, he takes notice of the brunet seeping beneath the water, submerged to just below his eyes. He pauses in midstep and blinks his dark blue eyes, registering of the presence of a head of brown curls amongst the expanse of seascape.
; but he knows he has to say something. And it's best to catch Sherlock when he's in one of the upswings of his mercurial nature, rather than the alternative.
“That’s strange. I have this odd craving for jam—” he says with some consternation, as jam is typically a breakfast food.
Sherlock senses he’s pushed John a little too far and stops talking. John remains painstakingly quiet. Eventually Sherlock feels the need to console him.
"Do me a favor and save the chivalrous sob story for someone else," John grouses, exasperated both by his flatmates insufferable inability to shut up, and the fact that there's crap sinking into his boots. Crouched over, he keeps his weapon low but ready.
"You have more power over me in your little finger than she has in her entire arsenal of torture tactics," he says, answering the confusion in his eyes. "She could never destroy me, John, but you
She didn't call him a freak but it's what she's thinking, along with the fleeting thought that the juxtaposition of his weirdness with his pretty face is very odd to behold. He holds himself in check, despite the fact that she's leering at him the way a wolf looks at meat (he's not sure whether it classifies as lust, cannibalism, or something in between).
A/N So, many of you said you wanted angst and not fluff... which was the wrong answer, guys, idk why you do this to yourselves. Also, many of you wanted more dominant John Watson, which is also a not a good idea... because then this happens. I have so many regrets right now.
Sherlock tries to pull himself together in the fogginess, but can’t shake the lurid, dreamlike quality of it all in the chaos of blaring alarms and stobing lights.
“—Juvenile school-dance,” Sherlock stops and then starts, “Romantic?” he blinks, that look on his face that says he’s processing a thousand and nine hundred ninety nine split-brain thoughts per second, then tips over to two-thousand, and gets frozen. But John doesn’t have time to piece together he actually said that out loud because he’s too puzzled by what Sherlock said.
"Sir, we need you to calm down," the resident says. John tries to force his way past but to no avail, making an over-large scene.
“Well, we’ll just have to stay and make sure he does,” Mary smiles down at him, and Sherlock blinks at her.
“I’m not made of glass John,” he says against one of John's fingertips, as his touch moves down his face.
"No you're not!" Sherlock finally puts his foot down, narrowing his eyes at John's wide-eyed expression, "Yes, I'm all fine with the progressive nonsense until you actually get hurt. Then we're going to have problems."
John clenches his hand, digging his nails ino his palm. Mycroft doesn't seem to be understanding him. "She... She's done something Mycroft. She-" John struggles, but it catches in his throat. He can't say it.
"It's not about you, it's about the cases," John says, frankly surprised he doesn't appreciate the distinction.
“Sherlock, you didn’t eat anything,” Mary says puzzled, but Sherlock doesn’t respond as he’s making a beeline to his bedroom in long, brisk strides.
As he ambles downwind in the pursuit of more shipwreck material, trying to balance on a trail of step stones to a further patch of shoreline, he looks again. This time he doesn’t feel quite so hurried to look away, because it’s obvious the creature has made the greater transgression, still staring at him like that, always staring at him like that.
"Yes sorry about this last minute thing. Sherlock was off on a case and I got called in-" John offers explanatively.
It stopped. Only a fraction of a second before it would have sliced his carotid and reduced him to a puddle of six liters blood on sand, it stopped. Perhaps on a whim, spur of thought, change of heart, who knows.
An inexplicable, irrational feeling of dread takes root in John's chest. Then his eyes migrate down Sherlock to his gloved hands, which confirm his worst fears.
"I'll see what can be done. In the meantime, try to keep him away from her," he says with a sigh and takes his leave.
John continues looking at Sherlock with a pained expression. He can’t take his eyes off of him- his heartbreaking, familiar face, that with just one smile could toy with his emotions now frozen in death and expressionless, those eyes that used to follow him around the room, now forever closed, incarcerated in eternal sleep.
"Please," he whispers, stifling his anger and trying a softer approach, "Do this for me, at least. I can't do go on like this knowing what she did- " Sherlock is tense, his back turned, concealing his expression. John reaches for his hand, holding it tenuously in his fingers.
Mary disregards John’s claims about her imaginary mother, and instead cuts to a more pressing issue. “What about his alibi though?” Mary asks Sherlock.
His absurd obsession with her merely wrapping her hands around him is getting tedious. "Why are you so fixated on that? I don't see what's the problem-"
Mary warily pushes the plate away, scraping the bottom against the acid-burnt table top. Sherlock frowns on the gesture, closing the fridge door.
The trees purify the air, removing the taint of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, infusing the breeze with an autumn scent, while the fountain makes it taste delicious and watery. He saunters through the courtyard near the periphery of the buildings, enjoying his short-lived freedom, reminiscing about the graduate years he spent here toward his professional degree. He can see his youthful memories play out in front of his eyes, like shadows hiding frolicking and playing. He shops short.
“I did actually, Dad.” She might be referring to her father, but it seems increasingly apparent she’s referring to Sherlock because they’re staring at each other with blinking-contest incessancy. They have a moment, naturally, because Mary has never called Sherlock
"What's this?" she asks, flipping through the series of crime scene reports and photographs, which detail nothing short of a bloody massacre.
Suddenly what she did doesn't seem so far of a stretch or unbelievable. When at the tender age of six one witnesses their father kill their mother, it's bound to change a person into something... else. That and the sheer feeling of powerlessness-
"What's it look like?" She asks, taking the deceased’s key card. John kneels down to check his pulse, but he's gone. Clean cervical dislocation. John isn't sure if he's in the right position to be reporting in a murder considering their suspicious mode of entry, or who he should even call, given that this appears to be some sort of black site.
The room smells like dust in the air, and lumber in the hearth, and the fine notes of Sherlock's cologne. The warm glow of incandescent lamps chase out the clingings of autumn nightfall.
"You don't look at me the same," he says, finally addressing him, "Now all you look at me with is pity. Like I'm broken." His voice- the way he hesitates finishing that sentence- it turns the world to static and free-falling ash, the idea itself so foreign to John he can't even believe the words he's hearing. He sees his lips moving but the words don't make any sense.
Something, no, he recognizes it perfectly well-- the chimera, lays nestled along the dunes, slumbering in broad daylight. It looks oddly human from the waist up, lying on it’s stomach with forearms braced above its head like an idle sunbather. Seeing it a mere few paces away, much too close for comfort, it occurs to him that perhaps he should back up, when its eyes flicker open and the glowing green irises that make John’s heart stutter lock onto him.
"This goes beyond anything she could possibly have on you-" he checks himself, realizing that was something of an unwarranted outburst.
"Alright, you got me. I was going to make it rain hell on earth before I let that man get away with what he did," she says like the idea is laughable, "As though I was going to let him die happily in a cottage in Nice."
John irritably acquires milk, bread and eggs from the fridge and scrambles them together to make French toast. Sherlock watches him in playful amusement, leaning in threshold with his arms crossed, with an unspeakably self-satisfied smile. John whole-heartily ignores him. It’s not until he’s engulfed by a set of long, languid arms from behind that he is fully alert to what his flatmate is doing. He freezes.
They stand outside on the doorstep, entrance’s door revolving as people enter and exit the hospital.
“Well, it’s—“ Nigel standoffishly tries to fumble for an understatement, but John raises eyebrows in a plea to spare him the deceit.
"What aren't you telling me?" He demands finally in exasperation, warranting no response other that Sherlock clearing his throat and adjusting his collar. Mary fidgets with her thumbs.
She guides him to a back door entrance, entering a key code into the security pad to disengage the lock.
“I’m curious to see what would happen if you ever encountered a game you couldn’t win-" As they’re moving simultaneously, their fingers touch by accident, sending a jolt up his spine. He retracts his hand as if he’s been burned, knocking over his own king in his haste. He struggles to quiet the sudden hammering of his heart and get ahold of himself. An irrational, visceral sensation had come out of nowhere and taken him over- a surge of panic that left him rattled and hardly able to think.
“So what do we think about this Nigel person?” Sherlock asks as they file out of the office, John a pace ahead.
It hadn't occurred to him the envy that might inspire. She hated him for it. He was everything she was not glaring her in the face. All the bars she could not meet.
They enter the second to last room on the left of the hallway, where John heads to the counter where he retrieves a spare manila file. Nigel files in behind him.
"You left your lipstick at the crime scene," he informs her, revealing the smear of pigment on his fingers. "You appropriated his MO and killed 7 men, that is, within the borough of London, outside the numbers escalate. Your intent was to psychologically derail, torture, and literally scare the man to death by leaving bodies everywhere he went-- which to your credit, might have actually worked..." he says, vaguely impressed, "Your motives for this are less clear. But I imagine your intent was to exact your revenge on him and the male sex as a whole for its crimes." The only flags on her record were a few dated infractions for child prostitution, which he suspects is probably where she developed such an extreme perspective on men.
Sherlock relocates to the windowsill, crossing his arms and gazing down onto Baker Street, the breeze shifting in the curtains.
He stops himself before he gets too worked up. He turns away and runs a hand through his hair, trying to recollect himself.
After tossing and turning Sherlock admits defeat, acknowledging sleep isn't happening tonight. He presses a hand over his eyes as unbidden images come fresh to his mind, playing vindictive mind tricks across the backs of his eyelids. He gets out of bed and dons his dressing gown, prowling around in search of the kitchen in the mid-morning darkness.
"I wanted to see your reaction," he says, his fingers feathered together in front of him, looking poised or devious or diabolical or all of the above, he fancies.
"Sherlock wait-" he starts from the top of the stairs. Sherlock pauses in the doorframe and looks up.
"Of course it is," she sighs, returning the violin to her case. "So now that you've finally realized he's not a sociopath you've come groveling to me for his life."
Then Sherlock becomes hesitant, reluctant even. “In truth, I think it makes him miss you,” he risks saying.
John knows you're not supposed to blame the victim. But Sherlock is not like most victims. He goes out, actively looking to get assaulted. No matter how he turns it around in his mind it makes no bloody sense.
John’s self-control cracks in that split second and he steps forward on impulse, reaching for her. “Mary—“
"Do I? I can't be sure it's not ‘Bolero’," John says that funny like he has no idea what that is, because he really doesn’t. Sherlock looks amused with him, possibly because he’s god-awful at Spanish.
“I don’t need to tell him anything. Everything he needs to know, he already knows,” Sherlock states nondescriptly, taking a backstep in concordance with the give and take of the waltz.
A growl rumbles from the creature’s throat as the human takes a few steps toward him, toes kissing the waves. The creature’s shoulders rise with tension and his fingers claw the sand.
"He's never going to open his eyes again though," she says, looking down at her brother. John follows her eyes back to Sherlock, settling on his painstakingly familiar face, his gaunt features and wavy, black hair.
"He said, and I quote, 'Sherlock, if you do not oblige me, I will strip you of your statutory rights, one by one.'
"Oh dear, what's happened?" Irene asks, taking off her sunglasses. Somehow John had been rather hoping they'd seen the last of her. For some reason, he finds he's developed an even greater dislike of the woman than before and feels vaguely threatened by her presence, although he can't really explain why.
Having grown weary of having to pick John's messes up off the floor day in and day out, Sherlock sighs taxedly, tossing a rogue gaze aside, one hand on the bed the other resting on his waist.  Then, with a spurt of agility, he bends over, scoops her up in his hands, and falls back effortlessly to a seat on the bed. The material of her gown, a wispy, gossamer layer over white-gold satin, curves over the bend in his elbow, tugging wrinkles into the stiff starch of his shirt, and tumbles over the bleach white sheets.
“Is that.. engine exhaust in my hair?” he muses in a startled tone, stoking charcoal out of his fringe, then his eyes blink down at his legs, which are crossed over each other comfortably, apparently taken aback. “And aluminum scuff marks?” he ponders, tilting his wingtips side to side.
Before, John had admired him and made no effort to keep his attentions a secret (since Sherlock never missed a thing anyway). Sherlock hadn't minded in the slightest and had in fact liked how John's eyes followed him around. He'd always give him a smirk and return the look for a brief moment whenever he caught John looking at him, as if to say, "I am extraordinary, aren't I?", looking like a cat that got the milk. But John feels like hasn't any right to be looking at him like that, not anymore, not after what he'd let happen. Sherlock is on the mark in pointing out the emotion for what it is, shame, but has horribly mistaken it's direction. John isn't ashamed of him, he's ashamed of himself. Every time he looks at him it only serves to remind him of how miserably he failed to protect him.
John stops in his tracks. He turns back partway, then haults, paused in the middle of the room. Then he turns his head, and leaves, through the front door and down the staircase.
"Right," John states, eyes fixed on Sherlock's lifeless form. He’s still in shock. It doesn’t feel quite real.
John comes down from his room the next day to find the flat vacant, with exception of Sherlock's former best friend, the skull, innocently minding its own business by the hearth. Sherlock's case files and sheet music are scattered about, fluttering in the draft, but the detective himself is conspicuously missing. The unusual absence of any electrical fires, holes in the wall, chemical explosions or any other property damage that would be coming out of his pay cheque this month is a good thing, but suspicious. It's far too quiet for a morning in 221B, and if he didn't know any better, he'd say an anvil was about to drop through the ceiling or poison gas was going to start leeching out of the floor boards. Then he hears the piano mysteriously playing one floor below, which to his knowledge hasn't been played since Mr. Hudson met his demise in Florida.
After mulling it over for hours on end, well into the silent night, he's still unable to get it out of his head. He decides he needs to seek her out. Get answers, get it straightened out. Even if everything he learned in medical school is telling him it's a lost cause.
John shivers at the response, feeling sick. He feels light headed and leans a hand on the rock. “No,” he croaks.
"But I do. I understand perfectly," he feels Sherlock's low voice rumble in his chest, sounding almost amused to John's dismay. There's something worrisome in his voice that John doesn't even recognize at first. He must've misheard- it's couldn't be hatred?
“You deserve better than this, and I just, I don't want you to be unhappy so," John swallows, and proceeds, "I said you were free to leave before, but now I mean it.”
He sets the mug down next to him on the counter that has become more of a laboratory chemical bench than an eating area. "It's freezing in here," John breathes, "You realise we have a thermostat?" Normally he touches Sherlock's shoulder from behind when he passes him tea, but this time he hesitates. He takes the seat across from him instead. Sherlock doesn't once break the motionless pantomime act.
“You’re another person,” it chimes in faux, exaggerated relief, and John’s throat tightens in recognition of his own words, “Oh thank God!”
Before he can parse out her intentions or worry about what dosage she's given him, he swoons, collapsing on the table.
Needless to say, the news falls ungracefully on Mary’s unsuspecting ears. She looks as though the world around her has been shattered like so many fragments of a not-so-fortunate mirror getting ploughed over by a stampede of monster trucks. Her eyes dart to John, who’s minding his tea, in a demand of how he intends to answer for this. He sees the look on her face, and his expression goes from one of sheer innocence, to one that is slightly miffed and glaring narrowly at Sherlock.
“Chick bait?” Sherlock demands, taken aback, although he has no idea what that means. He looks to Mary for a translation, but she shrugs helplessly, shaking her head at the nonsense. Apparently the boy doesn’t make any sense to her either.
His bold blue eyes stare straight ahead at the island, temple flexing, jaw rearranging the taste of mineral salt in his mouth. His mouth flattens into a defiant frown and he stands.
a parent. This probably feels like a vacation to you,” John says with a feigned conversational tone, contesting tolerance and annoyance giving his voice an uplifting lilt.
Hello, in this chapter and ensuing ones, the camera switches back and forth between two perspectives (John walking and Sherlock dancing), while also incorporating a
John is trembling with rage. "Sherlock!" he yells in a way that commands him to turn back around him and answer to him.
“The indiscriminate manner in which this serial killer operates is unlike anything I have ever seen,” he mumbles pensively through his fingers, “Jumping from city to city, across nations, like they are trying to outrun something... Or chase something."
Sherlock turns away and disappears up the stairs, abandoning John in the threshold where a few gloomy rays of light leak into the dark corridor. John covers his mouth, feeling sick to his stomach, and sinks to his knees, trying to breathe and resist the counterproductive urge to scream.
When he arrives at the last door, he tries to open it but the handle burns his hands. He finds an entry panel next to the door, and scrapes off some encrusted ice on the display. He tries to remember the code she told him and enters it into the key pad. The door slides open automatically.
Equally frightened by the alarming sounds coming from that direction, the soldier glances up to find a man approaching them, clad in a dark cape. Two infantrymen open fire on him but he disappears, reappearing behind them like a fleeting, unnatural shadow. Before they know it, he's torn his hand straight through the ribcages with his bare hands and left them crippled on the floor, leaving only two remaining survivors that are holding the soldier captive.
" John looks extraordinarily vexed, whispering his name as if he'd said something scandalous and morally reprehensible. "You wouldn't be so concerned with the nature of my intentions toward her and you certainly wouldn't be
“Sherlock, you have an eidetic memory with better recall than the bloody camera,” John informs him with hundred percent certitude, “I think you can
The second time seeing him like this isn't any easier. He'd been dreading it the whole week, putting it off, avoiding it, distracting himself with work. But the pain and horror and shame spring up fresh the moment he lays eyes on him, like it's happening all over again.
“They need not be reiterated because they are always there, always in supremacy to what you think or say, always in triumph over our petty little debates of who loves who and what matters to what; so you are freed of the need to repeat yourself into oblivion, John, because
"No, darling not-" but John reaches a hand out, but is too late. She gets up on the sofa to meet an air-headed Sherlock, who turns to her detachedly. As he attempts to stabilize her from wobbling on the sofa, she gives him a kiss on the cheek. Sherlock stares at the maggot in his hands in shock, the wires of his brain fizzing out and sending damaged sparks into the air that would warrant a “danger” or “hazard” sign in any urban setting. He stares at it intently, eyes boring into its skull, the gears of his mind clunking along in a state of precarious dysfunction, CPU data usage exceeded.
“So. That makes two of you. Here. Together,” she goes on to remark cheerily, with pointed punctuation, “In a church, no less.”
“No John,” Sherlock resumes in triumph,“to be someone’s father you actually have to be their father, if that makes sense.  A father is a
“That being said, if you are in fact, someone’s father, it counts for very little. It just means— what? That they supplied you with half your non-mitochondrial DNA?” Sherlock laughs, “It doesn’t imply a relationship, nor an obligation to one thereof, it just means that you have fulfilled your basic purpose of reproducing and congratulations is in order.”
“Damn it, why? Why are you so obsessed with her?" John says in a temper, unable to understand why Sherlock keeps insisting on solving this case with a blanket disregard for the damage he's doing. In fact he seems to be intent on causing as much damage as is possible, which John thinks is beginning to constitute a pathological pattern, with all the self-destructive tendencies from the drugs to the not eating to the actively searching out of homicidal maniacs.
By the time Sherlock bursts out of the double doors she'd vanished through, she's nowhere to be found. He scours the lobby area searching for her to no avail. He has completely lost his suspect. Profound. Spectacular, he thinks, raking his hand through his hair.
He’s trying to breathe but also trying not to scream, contemplating what to do. He looks around for another platform of rock to rest at, feeling like he’s going to pass out. The nearest rock is several metres away, but he comes to the realisation he can’t even make it there. He can’t take another stroke, can’t move, without the shoulder joint screaming.
“Of course I am but he’s not—“ he stammers, but then his world begins to reel, "You can’t think Sherlock is your
In a last ditch effort at self-preservation he looks away, trying to conceal the humiliation on his features and salvage the broken and bruised remains of his pride. She turns his face to the light, relishing the sight of his cool, burning eyes that have nearly lost all their haughtiness and condemnation in favor of a more docile nature, sombre like a broken mustang.
Unable to detect the hollowness of his words, Sherlock appears satisfied with that. "Is it alright if I borrow your tie?" he asks, holding the silk band in hand. John glowers pointedly at the thing in disapproval- it's very showy, garnished with a sun-shaped pendant- a medal for valor.
“As do you, Mrs. Davenport.” Thankfully well-versed in underhand verbal sparing between family members, Sherlock returns the compliment with a smile and head tilt toward Mary, deftly employing the familial vernacular for ‘the sentiment is mutual’.
"Do you think I simply don't notice when you look at me like that, instead of the way you used to? I'm the one has to see that look of shame on your face, knowing it used to be pride." Sherlock's words cut so deeply, John doesn't have to ask which look he's referring to- it's all over his face right now, the guilt, and it only gets worse when Sherlock points it out as if on cue. "Sometimes you
"Oh really. So you'd give her preferential treatment over me? Because she's killed a lot of people, and I don't see
“That you are to John Watson as John Watson is to jam,” she says, because there’s no plainer way to say it. She walks a few paces from the sofa to his music stand near the window still, glowing silver on their silhouettes.
For what it's worth, John greatly disapproves of how he's taken to mock flirting as a source of amusement. John's mouth goes through a couple iterations of opening and closing, unable to find a proper comeback for that. Sherlock gives him a parting smile smugger than a marshmallow on chocolate and closes the door behind him, after which John casts the mail aside and retreats to the sofa to nurse the strange discomfort that's taken lodge in his chest.
John doesn’t seem to understand what this means and stares at her with a sort of blank, lost look on his face.
"Stop it, just stop it, Sherlock. Please," he says, his voice strained and high-pitched. And they're at it again. Part of John knows it's no use trying to stop him. Sherlock would never give up on this because it's not in his nature, in the same way it's not in John's nature to stop protecting him. It was like one of those pesky equations with no solutions. He shakes his head, water clouding his vision. "You don't know how much I hate this."
There's no service or anything in particular to commemorate his death. It seems the local mortician and parish have gotten tired of the formalities and would rather take the weekend off than cater to another one of Sherlock's fraudulent demises.
"Yes, now. There's been another," he says with his usual curtness, dialing Lestrade to tell them they're en route.
“Not dead yet, I hope?” are the first words to greet his ears as he comes to. Hazily, he registers the figure of a man standing over him, silhouetted against the overhead LED lights. He's dressed in all-black, night raid gear. His face, however, is uncovered, revealing a striking head of blond hair that is in stark contrast to the rest of his sombre attire.
Sherlock seems unimpressed, like 'all the women' isn't that much of an achievement and doesn't do him full justice. He settles for "That's interesting coming from you." It takes John a minute to play catch up.
But a wave of stormy ocean flattens over the stone, and his nerves jitter out of control again. His eyes flutter down to the blackness of the surrounding ocean, beginning to spiral around the circumference of the rock, like an ominous mixture stirring in a pot.  The rush of water whizzes around his ears with a hissing
"So you do think so little of me," he says using a tone John had been on the receiving end of from many a scratched lover. He refuses to believe what John would have him think, that his struggles are futile and his defeat inevitable. "All those things you said were just lies." John's breath hitches.
"I don't think that would fix the problem," he replies. She smiles at that, amused at how he always goes through the pains of maintaining that proper and aloof facade.
"Enough!" John is getting royally pissed with his manic need logicify everything. "What you're doing to yourself is far worse than what I would ever do to you. You might not think of yourself this way Sherlock, but you are flesh and blood, and when your body finally stops so will
"Maybe you just drive women crazy," he thinks aloud, realizing he just interrupted as an after thought. The melody stops.
"This man died just as she was leaving- a man who just happened to have killed her mother and is a paternal match. That doesn't strike you as odd?"
“If he actually paid rent, that'd be one thing- I mean, having a roommate makes sense as long as they help pay the bills and don’t try to sabotage you when you do. But Sherlock doesn’t do either of those things.”
“Are you going to get that?” John asks Sherlock, who is gazing out the window. John is otherwise preoccupied at the moment, struggling to get their power back online not because of the storm, no, but because someone’s corrosives inexplicably made their way into the circuit breaker, which has since gone haywire.
"And here I thought I'd never see the day you actually said yes," her sultry voice sounds from behind him, interrupting his thoughts. She sits down across from him with not an ounce of suspicion or concern. "I had half a mind you wouldn't show," she admits, looking pleasantly surprised to see him.
That plan is shot when the shoulder starts throwing a fit, screaming indignantly that it is indeed, a fracture; a deafeningly-loud, vision-blurring, and just insufferable injury that refuses to compromise. He falters with a startled gasp, his hand clenching on his upper arm and imprinting his fingers into his bicep.
"Don't," Sherlock tells him, when he so much as suspects John might be blaming himself, "This one's on me."
Without easing his glare, the merperson pivots on the palm of his hand and dives back into the water, vanishing beneath the cover of seawater.
Though it's been an accident, Sherlock seizes the opportunity to make his escape, but in scrambling to his feet he trips backward on sloughs of carpet.
John has to wonder why Sherlock is being such a prat this morning, considering he just got laid. Not all of London is so fortunate.
“Don’t you trust me John?” Sherlock’s calm voice reverberates against his ear, and John finds it nothing short of blissful how it mellows him, gliding smooth, gleaming golden like running honey. John looks up to find Sherlock's calm gaze on him and feels a tumbling landslide of relief, the demonic paradoxical wiles of his brain— rabbit-traps and rabbit-holes— done away with, long forgotten. Sherlock is mercifully there— smiling and composed and perfect— his embrace holding him up, holding him together so he can walk and run and dance with him, as if he weren’t a physiological mess fraying at the seams.
Mary sees him scrambling for a properly worded explanation, and tries to fill in for the poor, tongue-tied know-it-all. “You’re not going to say it’s not-“ she begins to say when
"Of course you're not. But you're still human," John reasons, not understanding why he's saying nonsensical things. John glances down to see he's clenching his hand at his side.
“It feels like you could vanish into thin air,” John says, eyes running over him in fascination. Sherlock lets go a little, possibly because he likes the attention.
that? John wonders, giving Sherlock a sidelong glance. Sherlock makes no move to refute her, instead electing to fight fire with fire.
Sherlock’s amused, baritone voice sets John off-kilter, disorienting so, not unlike a blow to the head. John’s pace slows, and he absentmindedly drags a hand along the wall.
“Do be scientific. If a person is unconscious they’re unconscious. You can’t wake them up with a kiss anymore than you can with a pin prick. And John’s basically comatose,” he declares with a dismissive turn of hand, then rests his chin on it again and spins through the rest of Mycroft’s daily fabrications.
Another flash and he sees the shadow just in front of him. There’s a pang of panic at the sensation of it snagging his foot with rough, raw strength enough to make him feel though he’ll be torn apart, and he emits a startled yell before he’s choking on water. He plummets down for what seems like forever, water gushing against him so viciously fast, it feels as though the salt is scraping his skin. The grip doesn’t hurt, like a shark would. John is beginning to wish it did.
“I seem to recall he was supportive of some of your previous relationships,” Sherlock offers as a consolation.
While John was sleeping soundly last night, assuming Sherlock was being “normal” and getting laid, had he actually been— John forces that train of thought to a stop. He feels like he’s about to lose it. Was this something he could have stopped, had he been less stupid?
“Denial?” John asks, he checks the time on his phone, and gets sidetracked into the living room looking for his workbag, “What are you talking about?"
Sherlock looks taken off-guard. “John says you can’t cook or you’ll burn yourself,” he talks to her as Mary retrieves an egg carton from the fridge.
When John tries to hold him, Sherlock actually bites him, and when John touches his fingers to his mouth it comes away with blood. He blinks at it, and then Sherlock in dismay, his mouth curving upward at the absurdity of the situation.
“Okay fine. Let’s be ‘scientific’. I’ll prove it to you,” Mary decides, catching Sherlock’s (vague) interest. He glances over pointedly-not out of curiosity, trying his best to look bored and disbelieving.
Sherlock doesn’t answer the question, turning his face away so that a curtain of curls fall over his face. John hates to bear witness to how he keeps repeating these uncharacteristic mannerisms, one after another, textbook symptoms glaring him in the face. They don’t suit him at all.
“No, no, wait, Sherlock-“ John scrambles, grabbing onto him like a cat with claws, dragging him off balance rather than stabling himself, and they topple chaotically onto the oriental carpet, a heap of limbs alternating slacks and denim. Sherlock is an unruly bushel of curls sprawled on top of John, trying very hard to contain himself, and failing.
Sherlock is finishing the dishes. He does that now. It’s weird. John is seated in his chair, staring melancholically at the fireplace. Mary has long since retired to the upstairs bedroom for the evening, which now may be venturing into the early hours of the morning.
So...  the angst fix got delayed again. One day, my friends, one day. I've got it mostly written out, but it started referencing this, so this had to come first.
“You know you could try dipping her backwards,” he suggests, holding John and John holding him back in what is, essentially, an embrace, chests pressed together with slow, rhythmic breaths.
“Kiss him?” Sherlock retorts, amidst scanning through police reports on his phone, “I fail to see how that would improve the situation.”
“Sherlock,” he catches John say, his voice in conflict, “It’s ok. Yes, of course I forgive you,” he mumbles nonsensically, turning his other cheek to face someone nonexistent, clearly immersed in his dream world.
In the midst of his ascent, he inevitably slips on the moist surface, teetering on the brink of falling back to the depths. But he responds well under pressure and gunpoint and things of that nature, so he manages to catch himself. He resumes scaling and soon makes it to the horizontal platform of the apex. He throws himself against one of the walls of its naturally-eroded canals, trying to regulate his panting and rationalize the receding panic.
"Why? Did I ruin the mood?" Sherlock asks playfully, reading the gruesome thoughts on John's face. He's smiling, unapologetic and unrepentant like he's done a good deed.
But instead of becoming roadkill, John swoops down and wraps his arms around him, throwing him over his shoulder. Both of them fall deathly silent, taking a moment to process what has occurred. The surprise of being able to lift Sherlock clean off the ground snaps John out of the blind, unthinking rage that had originally prompted him to resort to such drastic measures. His intention had been to prove to Sherlock that he is well past underweight and borderline emaciated. He hadn’t necessarily expected it to work- or be this easy.
“Can’t we wake him up already?” she whines, looking up from her father’s peacefully clocked-out face.
Something in him twists past breaking and snaps, and then he's turned to her, blurting things out blindly without even thinking. "That is
"There is also the small matter of everywhere he went, bodies started dropping," he says, staying on track, "As you know, he died last Sunday. Heart attack. Then the bodies stopped dropping."
The sun ascends overhead as day break turns to mid morning, white rays bearing down on the dry, barren landscape, and the beach opens into a bay with cliffs looming in the distance. He approaches the waterline and glances over a bluff obscuring the bank, where he sees something breaking the waves. Squinting in the light but unable to discern what it is, he moves toward it, boots peddling in the sand for traction.
The cold nips at his nose and cheeks, stealing away the feeling in his hands and feet as he continues staring at Sherlock endlessly, in spite of her taunting him about that earlier. His thoughts go back to what she said- that she could fix him. Was she telling him what he wanted to hear? Was she conducting some sort of psychological experiment on him? Maybe she was just toying with him.
He comes to the surface half-alive, but is soon gasping for breath rapidly and anxiously, not knowing whether to cry with relief or misery that he lives to die another moment. His heart leaps in his chest when his eyes catch the rock he’d been in the midst of a journey toward earlier. He tears after it, his muscles protesting the abuse, but operational under the fuel of adrenaline.
That seems to be the right answer, because John chuckles irrepressibly and looks up with a smile, eyes alight with green-grey mirth. Sherlock stares humourlessly at that ephemeral warmth, chronically dampened with pain. Then John’s smile falls away into a line of open mouth.
Sherlock laughs dryly at that. "Not revenge," he says, acknowledging that this goes well past that, snapping off his forensics gloves. "This is war."
“A thing?” Sherlock cocks his head in feigned ignorance. He is fully aware she had a lunch date, with Scottish physician scientist who has an unusual penchant for ice lollies but the benefit of being himself and not the unfortunate, stood-up fellow in the cafeteria is that he gets priority.
Sherlock is pacing back an forth, circling him like he's trying to find a way forward but can't. He's wrestling with himself, coursing his fingers through his dark curls like he wants to pull his hair out.
in their not-so-distant past where they got handcuffed together in a more permanent sense. "No, I got it," he assures him.
John looks at the mug, then looks at Sherlock. It’s really not much of a decision. He wants his tea. “Yes.”
Curiosity piqued, he follows the music down the stairs, and slowly the faint, disjointed notes he can barely make out become longer and more recognizable phrases. Once he ventures down into the study, he discovers Sherlock is indeed the source of the sound, seated with his back turned at Mr. Hudson's Steinway. Even more intrigued, John leans in the doorway and watches Sherlock play, not voicing his presence so he doesn't stop. He's never seen Sherlock play anything other than his violin. And, well, people.
"How do you know what look I'm giving you?" John asks, curious. Sherlock spares him an ill-tempered glance, which he somehow manages to return with a straight face. He does not know what that says, that Sherlock knows him so well he can predict his reactions, but finds it puzzling nonetheless, quirking an eyebrow. Once he's confirmed John is, in fact, giving him
"Just drop it, Sherlock. Your whole theory is ridiculous," Anderson says, smugly crossing his arms, "You know, I'm curious, how did you even get her DNA, anyway? Did she 'rape' you too?" he asks. Sherlock's mouth opens with a response, but then clicks closed.
"Happy Christmas," she chimes with a wink, addressing Sherlock. It's by far nothing like Christmas unless you're in Australia, but it's become common knowledge Sherlock tends to associate dead bodies with presents and Christmas and frolicking elves. What's odd is the way she says it, like she personally wrapped this gift for him.
John shakes his head in discontentment, knowing what goes up, must go down, or in the case of Sherlock’s new-found hopes, crash and burn into one of his sinister black moods. Mary exhales a exasperated, amused sigh at the kitchen’s infallible egomania, veering toward the cluttered mantle above the fireplace with Sherlock’s dusty bat and beetle vivarium.
John strides into the waiting room of the clinic at a brisk pace, ready to see his next patient. He plops manila folder to a mesh wire bin situated on the administrative desk, where he recognizes one individual amongst the assorted crowd of drop-ins, a teenage boy coincidently seated closest in the line of chairs to him.
Just as he's leaving the club to rejoin his uncouth counterpart at the flat however, he hears the iconic chime of Sherlock's Blackberry and stalls midway in the hall. Then he hears his voice coming from the lavatory. Puzzled, John props open the door to the Men's and discovers him by the wash basin across the room.
“I don’t know what you mean,” he replies tersely, buttoning his collar so that he’s his prim and proper self again. He’s cold in the extreme, icy even, pointedly composed so as to betray no weakness.
John's hand balls into a fist. "What do you mean you can't? " he starts, shifting onto his feet. Sherlock has stood up from the table and turned away in a refined, graceful motion. There it is again, the steely, impenetrable mask in place of his friend.
For god's sake, she did not have to put it like that, he thinks, glaring at her as she walks off. She might as well have added on the 'too soon?' most people tag on after telling a joke.
"Leave him, John," he says softly. John stands back, feeling very uncomfortable watching the mounting panic in the man's eyes as the door closes on him, serial killer or not.
"You think this is revenge?" he asks, dubious, "None of these men were in the system for assault." Or anything, actually. The ones they'd been able to identify were all squeaky clean- mostly business men and white collars, not unusual with this being London.
The gesture is all in good fun, perfectly harmless, but when John retracts a final few inches, his mind freezes. Then his eyes widen with the pain of a sudden and invisible stab wound, and out of no-where, water runs from his eyes, spilling out in glowing streams of refracted light.
"You want to know how I did it?" she returns to the subject of the interrogation, finally addressing the question he'd so badly wanted to know, the one he'd staked himself on. "Really, it had nothing to do with strength..." She touches his face as if he were made of delicate, rippable paper and he goes still. The touch invokes the memories of what she did to him, and when they resurface, force him to relive the vivid, lurid details of he night before last. But he refuses to reveal how much he hates the gesture by resisting, which would be an admission of weakness. "...And everything to do with weakness."
Sherlock sighs wearily at the ceiling with the lack of response, arms resting flat against the wall, then turns and barges into the room at the speed of light.
But Sherlock is so convinced John is feeding him lies Sherlock can't bear the sight of him. "It wouldn't surprise me," he answers the forbidding look on John's face that's a truckload of octagonal stop signs warning him not to continue, "It would certainly explain a lot."
There's an awkward silence. "I'll get back to you on that," Sherlock decides and proceeds to walk around him. But John purposefully moves in front of him, catching him off guard, and he has to back pedal to avoid face-planting into John.
“I bet you would know exactly what I would say,” John entertains the thought, in fond memory his friend, “For my note.”
“I fail to see how that is any of my concern,” he says, not ungluing his eyes from the array of disorganized boxes. Surely there must be a method to this madness.
Upon entering the lobby, he discovers the facility is completely deserted and the power is out. "Brilliant," he says aloud, just what he'd been looking forward to- venturing unarmed into the unsurveilled depths of a creepy, abandoned mental hospital. He hears Mycroft in the back of his head, having warned him against this several times.
Sorry this ended without much closure, I will add in the rest tomorrow. Also, forgive my mistakes because I haven't ironed them all out yet :p
"It's silly of you to think that being a man changes anything," she says, like he's been terribly foolish, "You and I both know what you really are, behind all the posturing and keeping up appearances."
“Well it must have been because it’s not here,” Sherlock indicates his temple then flourishes his hand helplessly. John narrows his eyes at him haughtily, knowing that if this had been a case file that had casually disappeared, Sherlock would be going ballistic.
The guilt quietly chipping away at his sanity, John eventually gives up entirely and binds him in a hug, even as he keeps thrashing, trying to escape. He keeps pleading with him to stop, which Sherlock mindlessly ignores, fingers practically prying the floorboards from the living room floor. John buries his face in his shirt, wishing he could explain why he has to do this without having it fall on deaf ears.
He glances at the ceiling and spies a camera posing as an innocent fire sprinkler, for once grateful his brother is so paranoid he has even the lavatory under surveillance. Now was the time to use that convenient scientifically proven fact she was attracted to him to his advantage and manipulate her into slipping up. If he could get her to say something on record only the killer would know, it would be enough to put her behind bars.
Only three minutes in, she’s down seven pieces and Sherlock has concluded he can finish the game within the next ten moves. Another minute and he’s planned out several, redundant routes to capture her king, drawing from a series of dusty, antediluvian strategies she’ll never have even heard of. Eight minutes in and he's locked down inevitable success- there is no possible move she can make to win and the game is over. Now it’s just a matter of letting it play out.
"Whatever you have to say today I don't want to hear it-" she says, brushing past him. It's as he sees her go that the guilt flares up in his chest and he feels compelled to apologize. "Molly, wait-" he says, grabbing her arm.
“So,” he admits, a little bashfully, “For all my deductive powers, I am unable to eliminate the possibility you may be marrying the tall one.” He points to a figure that looks remarkably like himself, rapidly walking backward down the center of the room and reverse deducing the identity of the mayfly man's target.
He flinches when her thumb ghosts against his lips, pressed together in a hard line in an endeavor to keep his face neutral and expression muted, in spite of the misery with which he fails. Her heart flutters at the mixed expression, the softness of his shame so palpable, so ripe she could practically sink her teeth into it.
Sherlock is completely silent now, while Mary’s soothing voice tries to guide John back to a more healthy train of thought. The brunet looks away, hiding the flush on his cheeks. John’s fingertips press and knead into the lean muscle on his inner thigh, smoothing up the sleek textile of his slacks. Sherlock can’t refuse him, John knows he doesn’t have the power to. He can’t scream either, has to keep all the feelings encased in a mask of composure. Table manners.
He notices a flood of burgundy emanating from underwater, brewing like a storm. It drifts up in pints, soaking his clothes, its thick, suffocating scent permeating his nose and mouth. Violent colour mixes in the water, intensifying, until John is practically swimming in it, gagging on the taste of it. It feels so surreal, perfectly fantastical, like everything else, but the pain is too real to be a dream.
“Oh,” Sherlock realizes with a pleasant, you-learn-something-everyday tone, as though the association never occurred to him but still kind of makes sense. In any case, the point remains there exist some subtle differences between Sherlock and
“Please, I’m just concerned,” John replies testily and looks away. The multi-level complexes along the boulevard stream by with rain traveling down the curve of the window shield. Time ticks slowly. John’s hand twitches irresistibly.
Sherlock looks at him with a set of gaping blue eyes as John rises from his seat, jaw going slack as John says, “I think that you should leave. I want you to leave."
“Not for late for me Dad, late for you,” she spells out for him. John looks surprised if not somewhat amused when he realizes he's meant to be on the receiving end of this 'talk', “You would think by this point you would be past all this denial.
“You wore a dress,” Nigel remarks upon Mary and Sherlock’s entrance, befuddled. They take down the few entry steps and arrive beside him, amoungst the various, formal-attire attendees.
He doesn’t close his eyes when she kisses him. Eventually he turns his cheek, detached and not himself, and stares absently at the pathological department building.
It wants to take him apart, like any other routine cadaver dissection for educational purposes, only
“We’ll have to ask John when he wakes,” he resolves and sets the violin in its velvet-lined case, sliding the bow into position above it.
"And you still don't see a problem. With any of this. -Don't zone out, you're zoning out," John snaps, seeing he has since lost Sherlock's attention, who is looking at the windshield like a dog that wants to go outside. Only Sherlock would actually have the gall to do that while they are having this conversation. John's command snaps him back to present and the detective rolls his eyes.
John stares after him, then sinks his face into his face hands. Just talking about it with someone else makes it seem more real. He hadn't been able to say it out loud. He's hardly able to admit it to himself, much less others.
At some point, in the context of his own screams, he hears those of someone else. And then another, and then several more, this time closer. His abusers let up and stop trying to tear his arm out of its socket, their attention turned in the direction of the commotion.
The way she usurps space until he's positively trapped with no where else to turn- admittedly, it's a little... overwhelming. Her body language is more forceful than words, domineering and possessive. Every outlandish, overbearing gesture of hers lays claim to him, seeming to mark invisible lines of ownership and possession onto his skin.
“Stop it. Stop it. Please,” he hisses angrily, biting the water. With a flail of desperate, trapped-animal power he kicks free from the monsters grip, and touches his hands to the slope of rock. He inserts his digits into the crevices of its sheer slope, and pulls himself up.
Perhaps he should have anticipated, or even expected that sort of reaction from her. But it still left him standing there in the hall for quite some time, stunned. Yet somehow the sensation of that hit against his face was kinder than the wounds he was carrying internally, a brief respite from the howls of his own grief, the abject emptiness that followed, and the brutal way the world just continued on.
“Okay,” John reaffirms, positioning his fingertips on the surface of the table and looking back up at her, “So… not only do you think that Sherlock and I are together but you think.. that we are your parents.”
He decides he officially hates how dark and obscured her sense of humor is- he doesn't understand it, and things he doesn't understand, he can't predict, which is unnerving.
He hears those haunting words over and over in his head that evening. You should let him go, John. The way she'd said it with such plain, factual conviction gave John the feeling he ought to listen to her. But he can't. He tries to sleep and gives up at some point past 4 in the morning.
"Killing all those people in the same fashion he did and leaving them for him to find was a means of psychological torture," the words sit heavily in the room, eliciting sheer incomprehension and disbelief.
“Go on,” he goads him, cocks his head with one of those cursory head tilts that exudes quiet and undeniable confidence, “Tell her I’m not seeing anyone else.”
"You're right I'm not," he says, scanning through ads for cardio machines and the latest pharmaceuticals.
The regularly oiled handgun in combination with the twin-strapped shoulder holsters he has been in the habit of slipping under a jacket suggests something along the lines of a government agent or freelance assassin. Judging by the current state of affairs, Sherlock is more inclined toward the latter.
” such a distraught, passionate voice. In some perverse way, it almost makes sense to go and kill yourself over something that beautiful.
When his thoughts start to wander to what they might be doing that very moment, he throws aside the journal he'd coerced himself into reading with more force than is due and stands at attention. His fingers ache. He clenches and unclenches his fists. He hasn't the faintest idea what he was reading.
Her steely eyes shift gracefully over to Sherlock, harboring a contained look like that of a provoked rattlesnake. “And you brought your..”
After flipping through series of gory case files, one after another, Sherlock abandons the stack of paper on the desk and recedes introspectively into himself. The rain has receded into a misty drizzle and traffic is in a midsummer morning lull. He notices a familiar license plate that's trucking back to Greater London at its usual time of day, followed by an industrial district worker going to take the tube to their noisy flat that affords them no sleep, followed by a motorcyclist who's not looking forward to having a conversation with his boyfriend about how he might have run over their cat.
Sherlock grips the side of the blonde’s head. "John. Please don’t," he pleads, ineffectively. He tries pressing a kiss back, but John clenches his teeth, choking a sob.
"It drives me insane how you gamble with your life!" John yells in a tortured voice. Sherlock scowls at the nonsensical anger in his eyes- after all, it was his life, and not John's, wasn't it?
Lestrade blinks at the weapon as if he hadn't noticed it before, considering that John is perhaps right.
He stands up, nearly knocking over the table in the process. The game pieces topple to the floor and he watches them roll on the ground, feeling light-headed. Amid his blaring senses, a pulse that won't stop hammering in his ears, skin that won't stop burning, he detects a faint laugh.
"Honestly John you pick the most opportune moments. I nearly had her," Sherlock says, meaning to go after her. John's hand tightens on his wrist, barring him from moving, much to Sherlock's exasperation.
He glances sidelong at John, playing a sinister vibrato note. “Open heart surgery.” The note wears on.
Sherlock has been busy undoing his shirt. When it comes undone, John’s not surprised to find the whip-like lacerations across his back. But he’s horrified by the state of his wrists, which have deep welts on them, like a rabid dog was trying to chew them off.
He douses his face at the faucet and lets the ice cold water drench his skin, collecting all the errant thoughts in his head in a stranglehold and silencing them. Then he tampers with the stove until he figures out how to turn it on and makes himself some tea. (Typically John or Mrs. Hudson does this for him.) The kettle has gone from whistling to screaming at the top of its lungs before he blinks and makes to pour himself a cup. He takes a seat at the kitchen table, which houses his microscope, a few discarded experiments and some chemicals that belong in a fume hood, and watches the saccharine concoction glint around the tea spoon, wondering at what point it becomes honey with tea instead of tea with honey.
John feels himself shaking uncontrollably, nails digging into the palms of his hands. "That's not possible."
"No I don't. Feel free to explain it to me John, why you saw fit to sabotage everything-" The sleuth zigzags in front of him in a temperamental fume, whirling about tempestuously. John hates how he does that. He hates everything about him. He hates how in spite of the baleful wind he can still feel him giving off warmth, heat rolling off his body in soft, molten waves. He hates how he has to watch him dart in front of him like he's taunting him, and how hair-pullingly insufferable it is that he still manages to stir John's deepest, darkest wants when he's being this obnoxious.
“It's overcast. I’m inclined to say we picked a rather bad day." Sherlock looks vaguey intrigued, like he's detected a blip on some sort of imaginary radar he's got going. He ventures a sidelong look at John,  face blank and eyebrows risen in mild curiosity.
“Spare me your concern. I have champagne,” he replies blandly, holding the glass he's swiped off the mantle near eye-level. Then he brushes past his brunet counterpart, treading over to the assortment of wines to fill it.
“Right,” John nods in stoic concurrence. Sherlock stands there, wiping his fingers. The fabric, tossing from hand to hand, weaves in and out between his digits with deliberate efficiency. The silence draws attention to his brisk, mechanistic movements, and makes John restless. The whole atmosphere feels oppressive.
As the match progresses it becomes readily apparent she’s an average player with no cards or tricks up her sleeves, any subversive, underhanded tactics conspicuously lacking from her repertoire. If anything, her limited amount of strategic knowledge would be disappointing if he didn't stand to gain from it.
“I didn’t-! Listen to me, I'm telling you this isn't what it looks like,” he raises his voice compellingly, and the sound of it rings with earnestness, “Don't listen to him, Mary. He's trying to make you come back."
He's shaking head to foot, struck by how real all of it feels, although in staring back at the monster that is so far beyond what his mind is willing to believe, his mind gives up on trying to understand, rejecting the idea that any of it could be, for all intensive purposes, real or actually happening.
As John journeys back and forth, doing his work, their back-and-forth grows increasingly more frequent, and John supposes it’s not exactly unexpected that the more he looks at the figment of his insanity, the more insane he feels. Contrastingly, he becomes less and less aware of the chaos gradually brewing inside his head at its command, under the orchestration of its glare- that deeply aggravating and transfixing glare, that glare that makes his stomach turn and evokes something craving and possessive in him. It’s beautiful, horribly beautiful. Even the word beautiful doesn’t seem to suffice, it’s more like seductive. Perhaps not in the same way he might consider a human seductive, but that might be because he’s never encountered and human quite so seductive, or possibly even because he didn’t know what seductive
As they proceed further into the interior of the bulding, which is cordoned off behind locked doors and security panels. They encounter an armed guard at a security checkpoint, who Eurus engages in conversation before promptly snapping his neck.
"It was a long time ago. We had to get rid of the dog. It was causing certain... uncalled-for complications." Mycroft says, nursing a nicotine craving with one low-tar cigarette. "Who told you he had a dog?" Mycroft enquires, keeping his other hand in his pocket, shielded from the cold.
"He broke the D string," Sherlock corrects him. He's doing a good job of not showing it, but he's obviously irked.
“So I forgot today,” John sighs apathetically, snatching his wrist from Sherlock’s grasp. He then turns to Mary pointedly, “And that ring, mind you, means that I was married to your mother, not to him.” He points to the raven-head beside him, whose been residing there prettily, in their flat, for the past twenty-five years, for decorative purposes. He's taken to wearing the ring as a symbol of how he is
Greg remembering this singular event was his last hope; he can’t connect the cases with hard evidence if one of the cases is missing, or according to new Scotland yard, doesn’t even exist.
“You act like you’re above all this, but you’re really not,” she retorts in a don’t fly too close to the sun tone.
“What’s the matter, Watson?” he asks, “Didn’t look where you were going?” And they giggle at that too.
Sherlock's gaze inches back to Mary, blip confirmed. Mary rubs her temple tiredly at the transparently immature and antagonistic subtext.
When he wakes it's to the sound of muffled voices. His vision comes blearily into focus at the excited sound of a young cadet. He thinks the cadet is saying something along the lines of 'look, this one's alive!', hollering the rest of his patrol over to his find.
"I woke up female today," John says once he descends from his bedroom that morning. Sherlock looks at him perplexed. John then goes to make himself his morning tea. They don't discuss it.
Sherlock's breathing is quite erratic against his ear, his heart hammering in his chest, the sweater he's wearing feels delectably plush and teddy bearish as it strains and threatens to tear, which John hadn't really been a fan of until now. John holds him so forcefully, he's equally afraid he might break him as he is of him escaping. He thinks maybe he's gone mad.
Mary raises her eyebrows at the suggestion. “Oh I can do better than that,” she says, pushing off the floor to her feet.
Suddenly human jerks to sitting and brunet jolts up startled. As it hacks away, coughing up fluid, the brunet’s expression reverts from a state of shock to that of annoyance. He looks back at the sea, his tail flapping impatiently, considering re-drowning the human.
“My name is John. John Watson? Do you have any idea where—“ the man trespasses knee-deep into the water, and the chimera releases an hostile, threatened growl, clenching his canines, flaring his bioluminescent green irises at the intruder. John sees the silver tail whiplash beneath the surface and falls back on his haunches, chest heaving with rapid breath, his pupils dilated and his heels digging into the cemented sand. Fear. Good. It’s mutual.
The notes unravel effortlessly from Sherlock's fingertips into a canon that grows more complex as the melodies coalesce. And it becomes painfully obvious, laid out bare for him to witness, as beautiful cadences simply erupt from the keyboard with humbling and masterful dexterity-- His infraction had been much more severe than simply taking the wrong case.
When he sets foot on Sherrinford after a miserable clipper ride to the island that drenches him head to foot, it's the usual beastly, tempestuous weather, with flailing birches and flooding shores. When he arrives at the main entrance, locked doors bar him from entering and no one comes to open them. Eventually he discovers his government clearance also affords him limited access to the asylum and keys himself in.
“Darling, he’s not—“ he begins, then starts laughing uncontrollably, burying his head in his hand, “oh please stop.”
, but Sherlock proves unfit to balance himself and crumples onto the floor beside him in a giggle fit. John blinks at him in sheer disbelief, until his gaze sours into a petty, jaded glare, unsurprised but not unexasperated. The idiot really got a kick out of that, didn’t he, screwing around with some damaged person’s psychological trauma. Must be like the sociopath equivalent of playing pool.
"Hm. You know, there are some thoughts you could, in theory, keep to yourself," John suggests, so that Sherlock knows in the event he should find himself in the company of people with less... eccentric interests.
"I don't know- sometimes, things get mixed up," she offers as some sort of explanation, shrugging her shoulders. He looks at her scathingly. She seems to think a missing corpse is perfectly normal, like it came back to life and just walked out of there of its own accord.
