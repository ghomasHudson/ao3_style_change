“Must you always insist on so many layers? It feels uncannily as though I’m unstacking a Russian nesting doll.”
“Tis almost morning, I would have thee gone. And yet, no further than a wanton’s bird, that lets it hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, and with a silken thread, plucks it back again. So loving jealous of his liberty.”
And so, he finds himself following John about, not unlike a mongrel dog; trailing his steps around the flat, discreetly following him from a distance when he ventures out, and
“Best be out with it Marie,” Sherlock informs her boredly, crossing his legs and examining his nails, “between the footage from the security cameras, and everything else that your idiotic lover informed us of, it’s well and truly over for you in any case.”
“Oh! Okay.” Sarah flushes, shooting to her feet. “I’m sorry,” she stammers self-consciously in the young man’s direction as she turns to go.
“A noble sentiment,” Sherlock simpers falsely. “So then Eddie, tell me;” he prompts, casually sipping his tea, “when, exactly, did sleeping with her become a part of your brotherly duties?”
about the blonde, despite the fact there’s really nothing in particular about him that should draw the eye.
Sherlock clutches desperately at the arm wrapped securely about his shoulders, and cries out as his own orgasm slams into him like a runaway lorry.
certainly wouldn’t feel the need to murder anyone in cold blood, especially not at the risk of being separated from my unborn child. So perhaps you’re right. But then I hardly think that
Then John’s words sink in and Sherlock’s pulse kicks into high gear, thoughts whirling in a chaotic, panicked rush.
“When you say a few hours, what do you mean by that?” John asks calmly as he eases his fingers out from Sherlock’s grip and rises from his chair. He cuts around the table and kneels at Sherlock’s side before taking his hand again. “And how long and how far apart are they?”
“I'll be right back, love.” John murmurs with a small squeeze of his hand, and gets up. Sherlock nods settles back against the pillows, watching with slitted eyes as John disappears through the doorway and their newly cowed nurse slinks back in.
“N-no. I suppose it isn’t.” He stammers breathlessly in reply. They lie silently for a beat, eyes locked together in the dim light. The quiet of the room grows positively palpable, until Sherlock finally swallows and resumes his story, much quieter than before; almost hesitantly. “Victor was adamant that the irregular nature of my arousal was entirely due to my usage of suppressants. He didn’t comprehend that I was just not as interested in it as he was. I had no desire to discontinue my suppressant usage and return to the unpleasantness of heat cycles, but... I had also grown very accustomed to his companionship and was likewise loath to lose it.”
1986 was one of the years that Sherlock had committed to his mind palace, it was spaced near the first time he met John, the last time he saw his beloved Crup, Red Beard, and the fall of the Dark Wizard, Lord Voldemort, by Little Harry Potter. It was the year that Mycroft was promoted in the Ministry of Magic, and was in the middle of helping the current Minister delgate punishments for known Death Eaters. Which was one of the most exciting things Sherlock had ever heard of his brother doing.
“I know we should have told you, but you know you’re a lousy actor, John.” He chuckled softly, hoping the joke would break John’s silence. John cracked a small smile, but didn’t say anything.
"Not a lot. I wish I could have learnt more, but Mum is teaching me stuff about the human body and how it works, it's really cool." John said as he looked at his mother.
Sherlock stood up from the table and moved behind John as the man placed in teabags into two cups and filled them with hot water. Sherlock grabbed John by the waist softly, his thumbs grazing the soft jumper as he moved them along the man’s lower back. He forced John to turn around and face him. The man’s face coming into view with a puzzled look on them. Sherlock grabbed John’s face in both hands and stared. His eyes focusing on one thing. The pale blue of John’s eyes. Sherlock stared intently into them, looking for what it was that seem to hold him in time, that would control him, feel as though everything was fine in the world. To John it felt like Sherlock was trying to pull him apart, figure him out.
"Possession, that's the thing. Possession. What's the girlfriends name Molly?" Sherlock grabbed Molly by the arms in excitement.
"You are not far from wrong there, John." Sherlock grumbled, placing his head on the reports in exasperation.
John quickly took the turn around the corridor coming across Peeves floating along in the hallway, sticking gum in to the keyholes of the doors again. Something that was very likely to annoy Filch. John smiled to himself as he imagined the caretaker the next day trying to remove ll the gum from the locks, it wasn't nice, but it was a funny occurance in the school that seemed harmless enough for John to laugh at. Luckily For John the Bloody Baron came floating along the corridor. The poor Poltergeist was shuffled off and threatened by the Bloody Baron, which allowed John to get past him without any irritation or teasing.
Sherlock felt himself collapse against John in exhaustion, his hold of John's wrists loosening into a limp hold. John and Sherlock breathed in heavily together on the table, Sherlock listening to John's rapidly beating heart. He could feel John's shifting slightly underneath him, his hands burying themselves into the dark curls on top of his head lovingly. John wriggled again uncomfortable, signalling that he was starting to get very stiff and sore on the table. Sherlock shook his head from his orgasmic bliss and removed himself off John's, helping him off the table as well. John quickly rearranged his jumper, trousers and pants, tucking himsef delicately back in. Sherlock walked over to the sink and washed his hands as John fxed himself.
"Cute." John whispered to himself with a warm look to his face, probably thinking that Sherlock hadn't heard him.
Sherlock’s mouth left John’s chest, the older man whining at the cold air now brushing against his skin. Sherlock unbuttoned John’s jeans as quick as he could and shoved them down his waist, down to his knees along with his briefs. Sherlock looked down at John’s dishevelled form. He looked a mess of hot red flushing skin, his greying hair fuzzed in different directions from the blankets and pillows, blue eyes darkened with desire. He was mouthwatering. Sherlock kissed softly down John’s stomach, forcing John’s thighs as wide as they could go with the jeans pooled where they were.. Sherlock moved against John’s length, his teeth scraping against his thighs. A hand slowly encasing itself around John in a tight warm hold, he could feel himself pulsate in Sherlock’s hold, his mind going blank at the feeling of fingers moving up and down in a lazy movement. A wet glide suddenly surrounded itself around John, his body jumping a little in surprise at the feeling of Sherlock’s tongue moving against the tip of his cock. Then there was suction, hot, wet suction.
John loved the excitment and danger that Sherlock created when they tried to figure things out together. It bothered both their parents and Harriet to wits end, but there was no stopping them when the two were together. Harriet had always despised Sherlock, and John's relationship, finding it annoying. She always told John that Sherlock was too young to be friends with him anymore, what would people think if they saw him hanging out with a first year when entered Hogwarts. John just responded with 'people will just talk I suppose'. Harriet did everything she could for John to see reason in her claims, but he kept shooting her down. Whenever she talked to her mother about it, she would just sigh at Harriet and explain that Sherlock was the first ever wizarding child that John got to know, there is an emotional attachment for him there, and age shouldn't affect a friendship. When Harriet told her father about John's friendship with Sherlock, he sneered and told her not to talk to him about some strange child that John is now friends with.
"Alright Molly, I'll ask Mycroft for the information. I doubt he would deny me the request, as it would put Sherlock in a better mood. And I know for a fact that he is getting sick of his surly behaviour lately." John laughed.
Sherlock groaned and jumped up from his chair. He took quick strides over to the kitchen and stood over John. John gulped the last bite in surprise and smiled, small little innocent grin as he grabbed a bite and offered it to Sherlock. Sherlock leaned in and took the offered bite from John's fingers. The sweet honey glaze and burst of orange bloosom cascaded over his tongue as he crunched into the bite. Sherlock raked his tongue over the honey coating on John's fingers, softly sucking the tips of them. John's pupils dilated, and his breathe deepened as Sherlock stared down at him intently as he gave one last suck to the fingers, before releasing them. John launched himself at Sherlock lips as soon as he finger were released. Sherlock grabbed the back of John's neck, plastering him to the front of him. Sherlock raked his tongue over John's bottom lip, earning a groan from him. Sherlock was feeling so high, the taste of honey and rose water on John, the soft emitted groans from him. It was all so intoxicating. Sherlock pushed John up against the table, lifting him up to sit on it. John leaned back, feeling overwhelmed as Sherlock dominated the kiss. Sherlock nibbled John's bottom lip softly, his hand burying itsef into the back of John's hair, the other grabbing him around the waist pulling him in close. Sherlock moaned as he felt John wrap his legs arond his waist creating pressure against their groins.
"That's an interesting name. I like it. I have to go now, but I hope I can meet you again one day. Maybe at school." John smiled as Sherlock smiled back slightly.
“John, I would do anything for you and Rosie.” Sherlock whispered grazing his lips along John’s cheek, earning a passive grumble.
John was still writing to him every week. They met up under the watchful eyes of both their parents to talk, play, just do anything together, but what Sherlock loved most of all was the fact that John loved danger. Sherlock was danger incarnate. John's first time in meeting up with Sherlock again was in the Ministry of Magic, and they wiggled and wormed there way into the Department of Mysterys. Hiding at any opportunistic time when personnel drifted by, and they found themselves diving into hidden archives of magic more wonderous than Sherlock could have hoped for. Sherlock's mother worked as an Unspeakable at the time and her job was in located in the time room. So Sherlock had a theory of where everything was when it came to finding each room in the department. His mother liked to talk in her sleep when she was worried or something at work was causing her distress. Sherlock dragged John in the multiple layers of the department, investigating room after room. When they were found in the archive almost a full two hours later, reading some really questionable dark magic. Unfortunately for them, Mr. Lucius Malfoy had found them in the archive, and he was certainly gunning for a promotion in the ministry. Sherlock's mother faced an inquiry at work for Sherlock's behaviour, and John had never seen his mother so angry in his entire life. He promised himself never to run head first into anything Sherlock said ever again.
Sherlock moaned at the slight pull of his hair, and pumped himself a little quicker. He wanted this to be mind numbingly good for John. He wanted to pour everything of his love and passion into it. He started to feel the pace of John’s hips increase, knowing that it probably wouldn’t be long for John. He let his mouth slack and let John take control of the motion, as he fisted himself in time with the movement, feeling the burning need to cum in the bottom of his stomach.
"Well, Sarah might get a little bored, and it could take a while." Sherlock shrugged as he looked over to the Great Hall, noticing said girl was coming out of it looking for John.
"John, thats stupid. You constantly sneak out with me at night time, and all the times you do it with Silly Sarah as well." Sherlock growled.
"When the girls talk about in the dorms it usually has something to do with the fact that people feel an odd sense of possession when in relationships." Molly said, now looking up at the quidditch pitch.
Mrs. Watson was lying against the floor in disbelief. Sherlock quickly followed John to help Mrs. Watson, up and noticed the way she looked at John. She was scared and impressed all at the same time. She had obviously never witnessed something like this in her life as well, and would know all to well what the possibly concequence for something like this could be. Harriet ran over to all of them and wrapped her arms around her mother tightly. She grabbed John's hand in hers and shook her head, crying with relief.
"Well, I can't say that, Mum's right over there. You did however get one thing wrong." John smiled as he looked over his shoulder.
Sherlock closed his eyes and decided to do some sorting through his Mind Palace. He automatically delved into the John wing and opened the door to a memory that was one of his favourites. It was when Sherlock had confessed to John on how he felt. It was good because it came as complete surprise to both of them.
John was almost bouncing on the spot he seemed so excited about the prospect of this case. John laughed to himself after a moment knowing that Sherlock wouldn't ask either his Father or Mycroft for the information, as I would be detrimental to his belief that he could do things himself.
"I don't know. Nobody knew for certain. Graves liked to keep to himself, thats why a lot of people assume it was suicide." Molly said, wincing at the grip Sherlock had on her arms.
The only good thing about this whole cooking thing was the fact John got softer. Not only in demeanor. He was softer everywhere. He would gain this small amount of fat on his stomach and behind that seemed almost luscious. Sherlock would be transfixed for what felt like hours as he watched John sway around the kitchen, high on life as he mixed something in a bowl and then looked down into his cook book, re-reading the same method for the third time. Sherlock would have to surpress a little groan when he saw John bend over the oven to check on whatever thing was baking in the over. The way his pants would be a little more snug when he bent over was like Sherlock's little personal hell. John, so unassuming and so innocent in his little cooking world, would never dream up the little illicit fantasies that Sherlock was concoting in his mind. Sherlock would sit at the kitchen table, pretending to read whatever report was in his hands, as John hummed away in the kitchen. Sherlock would watch as John licked his fingers free of melted chocolate, wipe away flour from his face, and smile over at him when he caught Sherlock gazing in his direction every now and then. John was intoxicating in the kitchen. He would always smell of whatever he baked of for the day. Usually John smelt of black pepper and bergamot from the shampoo he used in the shower. But during winter, it was cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. It was the warmest smell in the world. Late at night when Sherlock would crawl into bed right behind John, he would nuzzle up so close to John and still smell the seductive spices lingering on his skin.
Sherlock loathed 1987.  He was in the middle of his second Year at Hogwarts, and it was also the year John got a girlfriend. Though mind you it only lasted about the first half of the school year. John had started to ignore Sherlock's needs for this Sarah's, and that was just not on, in his opinion. She was nice enough Sherlock understood, but she just had to be stopped. She was putting a halt on plans, on lessons, on puzzles and on the bloody cases. Whenever Sherlock was sitting with John in the quiet of the library, reading and writing down all of the work that John was currently working on, and that Sherlock was craving on learning. She would come sauntering in with a shake of her hips and plop her stupid hufflepuff butt right next to John and distract him with her stupid shiney smile.
John quickly folded the piece of parchement and placed it into envelope with Mycrofts name and address. He waved over to Mike, who was still struggling to comprehend what has happening on his paper, and headed off down stairs into the common room, bidded a quick hi and bye to Harriet again who looked perturbed at John going in an out. John exited the portrait and headed over to th owlery in the west tower of the school.
"And as much as it pains me that you agree for me for once, I still hold my opinions on divinations and why only fools take it." Sherlock chuckled smugly, earning a glare from Harry from across the common room.
"They will probably all get eaten before one of them comes over again." John laughed patting Sherlock's chest.
“Fine. But I get have you anyway I want tonight after we put Rosie to bed.” Sherlock said with a little smirk on his face.
"Well you obviously come from scottish heritage, as your hair seems to take on a little red tinge in the light, though if you were to stay out in the sun long enough I would say it would go completly blonde. Your skin is normally fair, but you currently have a slight tan to it, so you must go outside to play frequently, something a wizarding child rarely does, unless they have their own property, or their parents watch them constantly if they're in front of muggles. Your family is well off, but from the smell of it, your father is a bit of an alcoholic. The smell has still lingered on you. Your Mother is a witch, thats how you came into your magical inheritence, but she didn't tell you until you recieved your letter to school I imagine. You have an older sibling, most likely a brother considering the bruising on your forearms, indicating rough housing, or a lot of fighting, and considering the hand spread I would say a male from that. Did I leave anything out?" The child finished staring at John with pride.
“Masturbating, John,” Sherlock had to grip tightly on the bedsheet to avoid climaxing just from John’s aggressive swearing. He found it tantalizingly thrilling – being looked down on by John who was only holding onto a thin thread of self-control – to tear his curtain of restraint little by little, until he unveils John’s true self. “While thinking about you ramming your cock into me.”
Sherlock huffed dismissively, when he found himself eyeing the man in front of him in appreciation. John shook his leg, displaying his groin for Sherlock to see, as he sipped thoughtfully on his already half-empty cup of tea. He leaned back to rest his upper body on the backrest, his mind still among the clouds, when Sherlock caught a glimpse of John's hardened nipples. Why was he even wearing such thin clothes in this cold? Sherlock cleared his throat, grateful that his body knows how to follow his brain and not betray him, then went to get John the beige jumper he seemed to favor among all the others. "Wear this. You're going to get sick if you don't dress in layers." Sherlock said, handing the clothing to a surprised John.
John clicked his tongue in frustration, then brushed his hair with his fingers. He still felt pissed, not because of the Sherlock’s kiss, but because of his ambiguous actions. The frustrated doctor took one sip of his cold tea, then pushed himself up from his chair, fully decided to acquire an answer from Sherlock, one way or another.
"We don't want to hide it either." John spoke up bravely, forcing Sherlock and Harriet to stick behind him as the larger man approached them.
The next few times Sherlock and John tried to stay out of trouble. Though nearly setting the house on fire for a cookie experiment, and cutting off the hair off Harriet's dolls, just for something fun to do. It wasn't exactly keeping out of trouble, it was good enough for the boys. Mrs. Watson absolutely adored Sherlock's quick wit and observational skill just like her son did, but knew when to draw the line when he asked probing questions about her married life. Whenever they were out an about Mrs.Watson watched them like a hippogriff.
“John I’d promise anything you ask of me. After all this time you think I won’t give you anything you asked of me.” Sherlock said to the lump under the covers.
“No, Sherlock! There were other choices. You just chose to ignore them!” John turned and yelled back at the man before storming off into their bedroom and slamming the door on the younger man’s face.
"You have to ask to Sherlock. He was in Ravenclaw after all." John sighed removing himself off the bed.
John sighed into the soft kiss, unwrapping himself from under the blankets, allowing Sherlock to be closer to him. Sherlock brought his hand to John’s face, his tongue tracing John’s bottom lip. John allowed the kiss to deepen, feeling Sherlock move his hand from his face to his hip. He grabbed hard at John’s hip grounding the man against him. John moaned into the kiss. Sherlock’s tongue delving deeper, lips sensuously moving with his. John was feeling completely consumed by Sherlock. His body feeling like it would burst into flames with just the slightest brush of their bodies. The younger man moved over the top of him, his hands briskly moving along his thighs, john shuddering as Sherlock pulled them around him.
Sherlock has been very irritating and depressed for awhile now, as you are fully aware of. I found out today that Auror Lestrade is doing some work on Geoffery Graves suicide. I know It's out of line, but would you mind to terribly if you could send over some of the information about the case and couple of the photographs so Sherlock could give it a look over. I reckon it would cheer him up immensely to have a case to pour his brain over.
John failed to keep his promise the next time he saw Sherlock they had gotten into his father's case files. Sherlock had been very intrigued by the work his father was currently progressing through. The victims in question had been poisioned by acromantula venom, but there was no record of any acromantula ring in Britain at this current time, the only one he could find was in Spain. Sherlock flicked through the pictures with John, constantly asking him questions about the bodies,. But John really had no idea about any of it at all, though he was very excited to help Sherlock in his quest. When Sherlock's father brought home a big round egg, the size of a soccer ball. Sherlock of course took it upon himself to hatch the creature that dwelled within it. Of course it only took Sherlock a few minutes to figure out what to do to progress the egg to hatch faster. Needless to say it only took a couple of hours for the creature to be released and John to be sent to St Mungo's first floor for Acromantula poisioning, and for Mr. Holmes to recieve and inquiry of his own at work. Sherlock never stopped apologising to John the entire time he stayed in hospital, which of course was only a couple of days. Mrs. Watson decided then that boys should be doing visits at her house instead, saving another trip to the hospital for future cases considering the Holmes line of work.
John dragged his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, gently pulling the curls as they grinded against each other. The feeling of Sherlock hard against him, causing shivers to vibrate across his skin. Sherlock slowly moved down John’s neck, tenderly nipping and sucking along the flesh there. His hands now moving from thighs, which wrapped tightly around him, to the hem of John’s sweater. Sherlock pulled it up along with the shirt underneath to feel John’s warm tanned flesh under his hands. He was pushed away briefly to allow the sweater and shirt to be pulled up over John’s head. John attacked the buttons of Sherlock’s shir once he was free, hands roaming over the pale smooth skin. John looked at the old bullet wound on Sherlock’s chest, fingers slowly running over it. Sherlock removed John’s hand from the wound it around his neck bringing his cool chest into contact with John’s overly warm one. He bent down and softly kissed over the toughened skin of John’s own bullet scar, moving quickly up his neck, leaving little nips and marks against the skin. He’s mouth moved over John’s swiftly, taking control that was easily given this time. John’s thighs tightened around Sherlock, when he felt cool fingers run gently run down his chest, thumbing over his nipples till they hardened against the touch. Sherlock smirked at John’s little shudder and moan and moved his mouth down John’s body. John arched into Sherlock’s mouth when tongue and teeth met his nipple in a harsh nip. Sherlock rotated his hip against John’s, feeling the hard length pushing against the confines of John’s jeans. Sherlock continued nibbling John, his hands moving down cupping John. John bucked harshly into Sherlock’s hand, moaning obscenely at the touch.
When John Hamish Watson and Harriet Watson turned eleven years old, they were thrown into one of the biggest changes of their lives. They both recieved a letter saying they were to be admittied into Hogwarts school of witchcaft and wizardry. Their mother had taken them into John's room and explained to them, how important this part of their lives would be. She took great care telling her children, that when she was their age she too had recieved a letter that said she would attend this prestigious school, and that everything leading up to her life now was a result from it.
There was brief moment where Sherlock lips brushed up against his. John felt his eyes close at the touch, his arms encircling around Sherlock’s waist to keep him grounded in the feeling. Sherlock’s nose brushed up against his gently, lips now tenderly pressed themselves along his cheek, and into the crook of his neck. John sighed into Sherlock’s shoulder, as them man buried himself further into the crook of John’s neck. Inhaling the smell of soft cotton, tea, and Rosie’s baby powder. He crowded John into the counter, pressing him up against it. Feeling the smaller man’s hands run up and down his back slowly.
John removed his hand from Sherlock’s head and let the younger man crawl over the top of him, trailing soft kisses against his neck once he found the place he wanted to nuzzle into lazily. John smiled happily at the feeling of Sherlock’s lips gently kissing the nape of his neck. John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair lovingly as they both lay there, blissed out at the feeling of pleasure and love between.
“I can’t promise it won’t happen, John. You know the kind of life we live. But I will never leave you again, John. I promise. I will fight with everything I have to be with you and Rosie. And if i have to go away on a case for Mycroft, i will call, I will message, I will remain in contact so you always know that I am coming back.” Sherlock said softly.
"I suppose your right, as usual. But there would be no harm in asking, the worse I could get is  a no." Sherlock continued to eye John.
"Then perhaps you should look in the mirror. Your staggering appearance tonight tells me that you have been drinking most of your hours away. Your eyes are blood shot, you are exuding violence, the stench coming off you is interminable, and will most likely cling to you for the rest of your life. The fact that you have come here and started threatening your family, and insulted someone you don't even know, shows the inteptitude you share for people of our nature. If I were you, I would feel like a pathetic jealous muggle." Sherlock cracked as he pulled himself away from behind John.
"Great. I shall see you after third, and you at practice." John said nodding to the two as he was being lead away towards their class.
"Well, then I wouldn't be able to come in and have these fascinating conversations with you." Sherlock said, earning a side glance down from John, that was a cue for it was a bit not good.
"That's amazing. What else can you tell by looking at me." John was pratically beaming with enthuisam at the new boy, who now began to look a little confused.
"Sherlock it's rude to stare." Molly said uncomfortably as she figured out that Sherlock was fixated on the couple.
Professor Snape came sauntering into the room, scowling impressively as the sight of the students readying themselves for class. He began preparing the ingredients, explaining in a drawl, greasy voice each property of what they were squishing and cutting, and how each one would affect the potion. Sherlock looked up to Professor Snape who was now shaving a graphorn horn in tiny fragments. Sherlock copied the procedure to perfection, and watched as Molly struggled to keep things in the same length. He rolled his eyes and grabbed the horn from the girl and shaved it evenly for her, and deposited it into her cauldron before Snape could see it.
"That's the last time Molly." Sherlock grumbled underneath his breath, causing her only to giggle slightly.
Molly hummed a thanks of appreciation over to him, and looked over to see Anderon struggling with it as well. Molly looked at Sherlock expectantly, hoping he would help him as well. Sherlock huffed in irriatation and just grabbed the product from the boys horn from his hands. Anderson about to shout something, stopped when he noticed Sherlock shaving the horn for him perfectly. He handed it over to Anderson with a scathing look and sniffed at Molly who smiled happily over at Sherlock.
John smiled and laughed at the owl, letting his fingers be nibbled by the bird. He scrounged around his pockets for something for the bird to eat, but came up short. He sat down on the floor, probably not the wisest move considering the mess on the ground, and sighed. John started to close his eyes when he heard shuffling along the steps of the tower. Black curly hair came into view as it walked in the open doorway and stopped.
“You know what I mean.” John huffed as he threw the blanket off his head, making Sherlock chuckle again at his irritated look.
"I suppose, but no giving this one here tips about what we were doing." John laughed nudging Sarah shoulder jokingly.
"Who cares. You're obviously new here otherwise you wouldn't be taking so long to decided. Though looking at you, you're not a muggleborn, but you're damned near close to it." The boy growled as John looked continued to stare at him in surprise.
"Well, you must really like it to do that." John laughed scratching the back of his head. One of those irritating quirks he did when he was embarrassed.
"Mum!" Harriet screamed, as she came rushing back into the room with Mrs. Watson's wand, pointing it at her Father who was still holding John in his hands. "Let him go Dad! I swear I will use it!"
“No! You can’t keep doing this Sherlock! Every time there’s danger you can’t always throw yourself in front of it. What if that man had actually killed you! You wouldn't be here! What would I do? I can’t lose you again!” John sobbed as he threw his weight back into the door keeping Sherlock out.
"Don't give any of these to Mycroft or Lestrade." Sherlock said, popping another one into his mouth.
"GUYS, I'M LEAVING! SOMETHING HAS COME UP." John shouted up at the crowd still floating about the pitch on their brooms looking shocked as John left with Sherlock grabbing his hand and pulling him from the stands now. John groaned in frustration, knowing full well that to shut Sherlock up he was going to have to allowed himself to be pulled along.
It wasn't long before more violent things would happen to Sherlock. He was beaten severly one day and taken to the infirmary for Madame Pomfrey to look over him. In potions class someone would try to spill some of their concotions on him, set his robes on fire, or cast some ridiculous curse on him. John had found him one day frozen in the library under a table. He had to pull him out of the library with Molly following closely behind him. Madam Pomfrey gave him a once over and helped unlock the boy from a Petrificus Totalus and sent him on his way with John and Molly. The most common of people to be the one to perform these spells was Moriarty. A snide little boy who had some sort of vendetta against Sherlock.
Sherlock dipped his fingers into the glaze on the plate that was left over, and thought to himself that John being ridiculous was always something he would look forward to. year after year.
Sherlock wasn't too sure what had happened after in entire thing, he told his peace to the minister about what happened and then was forced to go home with his parents before he could find out what was to happen with John and his mother. When he asked John a couple of hours later, he was told that he was allowed to go to school and nothing too bad had happened. Though Sherlock knew otherwise.
Sherlock continued to play with the set every time him and John were together. Despite them getting into hundreds of shennanigans over John's summer and winter holidays, they were usually found expanding their minds in Mrs. Watson's kitchen. John with his biology books open, or one of his many assignments for school, and Sherlock reading one of the many chemistry books that John had borrowed from the library in town.
Sherlock stopped shaking his head and looked down at her. She was grabbing a hold of his shoulder now. He could notice that she was taking in his red features now, and that his breathing was becoming deeper and a little uneven. Sherlock nodded his head quickly, saying he was fine. The feeling in his chest kept tight for the rest of the class. Snape even pulled him up on the fact that the boy was flustered, and questioned whether or not he had attempted to drink the potion to early, reiterating that drinking the antidote to uncommon poisonings too early, could cause mild fevers and eventual poisoning itself. Sherlock gave professor Snape a derisive look for suggesting something stupid in the first place, which earned him a loss of five points for his house.
"Molly, do you know of anything happening around the school at the moment that needs to be solved?" Sherlock asked as he pieced together an idea.
John ran up to his dormitory as quickly as he could, knowing full well Sherlock would be waiting in there, rather then waiting outside in front of the portrait for him. He quickly spoke the password 'apertus' which is probably one easiest passwords they have had, and Sherlock being Sherlock would have figured it rather quickly. He walked in, seeing Sherlock laying across his bed, pictures and case reports strewn across the bed spread in front of him. John smiled, finding the imagine all to familiar and cute and dropped his books on the ground to sit on the bed next to Sherlock who was deeply engrossed in a toxicology report on Grave's body. John looked over Sherlock's shoulder to read the report with him.
"Geoffery Graves was in a sexual relationship with a person that wanted to own him solely?" Sherlock questioned to himself.
"Now you can write to me if you like." John smiled brightly at Sherlock who just looked back in surprise. "Mum. If Sherlock write while I'm at school can you tell him where I am staying, or does the post cover that?"
In 1986 Sherlock started Hogwarts, he was more than keen to start and excell above all the other students. He already had a sound understanding of the school and how it ran because of Mycroft. He understood all of the teachers, and their teaching behaviours, what they wished from students when it came to marking time and exams, and above all John Watson was there. Sherlock wanted more than anything to see John. He was the only person in this world that Sherlock believed to be, not dull. Which confused Sherlock greatly. The boy that Sherlock had met all those years ago would now be in his fourth year of Hogwarts, and would have a much more sounder knowledge of magic then when he first learnt it all those years ago.
John ran over his thought of what could possibly be irritating Sherlock lately, but nothing was coming to mind. He seemed to be horrible to everyone lately, and whenever he was excited about something, he would get irritated later again when John explained he had plans with Sarah. John was aware that Sherlock had a slight issue with Sarah. She wasn't like him or Molly, or anyone Sherlock really got along with. She was popular and preppy, clever, but not too bright. She was normal. She did have some faults that he was aware of. She put too much time in her friends and thinking about parties in the Great Hall that they could throw. She was sweet, maybe a little too sweet. It got a little irritating to be honest, especially with other guys. Sarah wasn't really aware when she was being hit on, and the fact she just went with it unawaredly annoyed him greatly. She didn't like adventuring out with Sherlock on cases, which was something John missed doing alot. She was just happy to snog in the common room, or join in at a party with one of her friends. She didn't really like Sherlock all that much either come to think of it. Everytime he spoke she would roll her eyes, or mumble something under her breath aout it being strange, but she would never call him a freak. John grumbled a bit thinking about it again, and shook his head trying to eliminate the negative thoughts he was starting to think about Sarah. She was nice, she was sweet. Her and Sherlock would just have to get along if they wanted to be involved in his life.
Sherlock watched himself standing in the doorway of the flat. John was swaying along in time with some music that was on radio, Rosie was in his arms and smiling and babbling at John. He was singing as well, completely unaware of anyone else in the room with them. Sherlock leaned against the door and John chucked Rosie into the air, she squealed happily in delight as John caught her and kissed both her cheeks. Sherlock wasn’t too sure what the song was, but it sounded like something that he had often heard in his youth. Some 80s rock rock or pop song that would have been popular at the time. John favoured music from the 80s, it reminded him of his youth. Sherlock watched as suddenly flickers of electric indigo danced along John and Rosie’s skin. The light had caught a the coloured glass ornament that was hanging in the window. Something Sherlock had bought on an outing with John and Rosie. Rosie had squealed in delight at the colours dancing in the wind, and Sherlock had to buy it. Anything that had made her that happy Sherlock had to buy.
“What, exactly, are you speaking of?” responded Sherlock, not moving his gaze from the direction they’re headed.
“Wear this. You’re going to get sick if you don’t dress in layers.” Sherlock said, his eyes not on John’s face but somewhere farther down, avoiding the quizzical look John gave him.
“Bloody fuck,” John muttered, fists clenching tightly, as if to tame himself from completely losing control. His face was contorted into a pained expression, but Sherlock noted the blush spreading on the expanse of John’s skin. “Sherlock,” he starts breathily, “Would you please, PLEASE, clarify something for me,” John pants.
"I'm afraid I know not what you are speaking of." Sherlock replied, smirking at the wide-eyed man beside him.
John heard the exasperated huff Sherlock released and moved to settle his gaze on the people doing all sorts of things outside. He shook his leg to ease some of the growing tension he felt, sipping aggressively on his tea. He leaned his torso on the backrest when he found his cup to be empty, aware of Sherlock staring intensely at him. John snapped out when Sherlock suddenly stood up to retrieve something somewhere, and came back with John’s beige jumper.
"Nghh--!" John unintentionally moaned when Sherlock's curled fingers hit something inside him. He continued teasing John with his fingers, smirking and contented as he did so, until the doctor became a begging mess. "S-Sherlock, please." He whispered, tears rolling down from his eyes.
Sherlock yelped when he was lifted off the couch by strong hands. He stared at John’s face, unusually tight and scowling. His heartbeat quickened when he saw that they were headed for the bedroom, and his cock got even harder. “Joh—” Sherlock was cut off when he was thrown onto the bed.
He poured the hot tea on a cup and noticed the crossword puzzle on the bottom right corner of the page. One by one, he answered them, listing the words in his head. His mind suddenly went blank as he felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise, shuddering at an unknown unusual sensation. John cleared his throat to dismiss the feeling. “Sherlock,” he called and turned to look at his flatmate, frowning lightly at the detective’s facial expression.
, he thought as he lapped his tongue on the bruised skin. John's mantra, consisting only the detective's name, seemed to hypnotize Sherlock into being more feral than any mating animal. He pressed kisses on the doctor's chest, and sucked on his nipples, earning him a delicious moan from the man he pinned. He continued moving down, sucking and biting on soft skin, until he reached John's leaking member. He licked the slit slowly, making sure his tongue dipped on the opening, then enveloped it with his hot and wet mouth.
John Watson was absolutely oblivious to the fact that someone was currently studying – ogling at, even – every inch of his rigid body, as he casually read the newspaper he had taken this morning. He was standing with his back turned to Sherlock, much to his delight, and John’s body was covered only by a slightly fit shirt (thank you, shirt) and some sort of snug pyjamas that comfortably embraced his toned legs, even though it fell straight towards the ground due to fabric quality. Very much like the wearer’s sexuality.
John grew silent for a while, his frustration dying down just by thinking of living with Sherlock without any more repressed feelings. John exhaled and said, "I love you too, you fuck."
John shivered as he felt the hot breath on his ear, speaking his name. "Sherlock," he exhaled. His eyes closed as he felt the detective's head moving away from him. He knew that he looked like a ripe tomato, by now, and he was too embarrassed to even look at anything. When John opened his eyes, he noted that Sherlock's pupils were dilated, his eyelids doing a great job at making him look even sexier. John shuddered unexpectedly and Sherlock smirked at that.
“Huh,” John responded absent-mindedly, whether to the answer or to Sherlock’s exhibition of unusual behaviour, he was not sure. He licked his lips mindlessly and he could
John pounced on the helpless but welcoming Sherlock, tearing his clothes off impatiently. He pressed kisses from Sherlock’s mouth, then his cheek, to his jaw, down to his neck, biting hard on the skin as John worked on the accursed trousers that prevented him from immediately reaching his goal. Sherlock keened in pleasure and bucked his hips in a desperate attempt to ease his painfully hard erection, but was stopped by a strong and firm grip on his hip.
"Sherlock," John moaned, bucking his hips forward to feel even a bit of friction on his rock-hard member.
"Bed," Sherlock exhaled when they broke their kiss, then carried John bridal style towards their room. John's eyes widened at the unexpected strength of the man holding him firmly. Sherlock practically threw John onto the bed and leapt above him, once again devouring his delectable mouth. He removed his coat, then John's, while kicking off his shoes. John unbuttoned his shirt and unzipped his trousers, as Sherlock worked with John's clothing. A few minutes after and all they felt was the skin of the other man and their erections rubbing together.
It was at this moment that John released a deep moan, clenching Sherlock’s clothes and tearing them off of him slowly and teasingly. He nipped at the skin on the curve between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, and left a trail of red marks down to his nipples. Sherlock bucked his hips, his erection meeting John’s jeans, and whimpered impatiently, wordlessly urging John to ease his evident arousal.
Sherlock opened his eyes to find a wide-eyed John standing by the door. “I-I forgot my… card.” John stared, still taken aback by the sight in front of him.
“What is the point in answering that section, anyway?” Sherlock frowns, completely back to his normal, Sherlock-y self. “It’s a waste of time.”
“Jo--” he started, but was silenced by a finger against his lips. Sherlock noticed the glint in John’s eyes, similar to a predator that had trapped its prey, and his wolfish grin that sent shivers throughout his whole body.
"Aw, I never knew you cared for me." John replied, half-sarcastic and half-genuine. His smile, though, Sherlock noted, had no signs of dishonesty.
The sound of Sherlock’s voice sent shivers to John’s whole body, making him hold back a grunt that would’ve come out as a moan. “What, what in the bloody fuck were you--”
Sherlock keened when he felt John’s finger penetrate his hole, short exhales landing on his leaking cock that tortured him even more. “Oh, John, please touch me,” he mumbled, attempting to reach John’s mouth by desperately bucking his hips, but is prevented by a firm grip on his abdomen.
“Oh, come on, John,” Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked at John, “It’s the middle of January. Even I’m wearing at least two layers of clothes more than you.” Sherlock cleared his throat and once again looked away from the doctor. He turns on his heels and walked towards the window, getting his violin along the way, to escape the suddenly awkward situation.
the feeling of uncertainty. He was nearly always infallible ever since he was a child, except those occasional intellectual bouts with Mycroft, until John Watson stepped into his life so casually. The first time Sherlock laid his eyes on the doctor, he had immediately been intrigued by him, and Sherlock was eager to see how John Watson would react to his deductions. Sherlock can still remember the unusual feeling of relief and excitement when the doctor's eyes shimmered in awe and complimented him so genuinely, instead of being outrageously offended and repulsed. Sherlock can't help but smirk fondly, if that quivering movement of his lips could be called a smirk, at that memory.
John grinned and licked Sherlock’s slit lightly, earning him a delicious moan from the pinned man. He added another finger after pushing in and pulling out repeatedly. He scissored Sherlock’s entrance, then added a third finger when he deemed it necessary, curling his fingers against that spot inside Sherlock that made him incoherent.
“K-Kiss me! In front of those cameras!” John shouted, his face completely red. When John looked at Sherlock, his face still exhibited that same unamused look from before which made John to flare up. “You bastard, if you’re going to do something, be sure that it won’t fucking give people ideas!” John exclaimed, then turned on his heel to walk away from the infuriatingly charming detective towards the direction they came from.
“You know what I’m talking about. Could you just–“ John stopped and grabbed the detective’s arm to stop him from walking. “Why in the world are you even in a hurry?!” Sherlock only gave him an unamused look, then lifted a brow to remind John of his question. “Why did you do that in front of those photographers?”
“Why would you do that, Sherlock?” John asks, panting, as he walked longer strides to catch up to the consulting detective.
The detective chuckled heartily and replied, "We haven't known each other THAT long, John. It's only been four years."
"Oh, come on, John," Sherlock rolled his eyes, "It's the middle of January. Even I'm wearing at least two layers of clothes more than you." He averted his gaze from John's intent staring, internally swearing at the warmth growing on his face. Sherlock turned away, grabbing his violin in the process, and walked to the window to fiddle intensely.
John sat inside one of the cafes he usually goes to during the rare occurrences that he was not with Sherlock, staring at the now cold tea he ordered about fifteen minutes ago. He touched his lips absent-mindedly as flashes of the event that frustrated him rushed back to him.
“Not exactly,” John answers, settling the newspaper on the nearest table and walked towards the couch in front of Sherlock. “For some, it may help in building their vocabulary.”
“Nghh,” Sherlock bit on his lower lip to prevent any noise from escaping his mouth. When he felt his climax approaching, he accidentally moaned John’s name, when he felt a strong hand grab his wrist.
The man in question stood in front of the window as he played his violin softly. It was a piece he rarely played, so some parts of it were forgotten, being replaced by gentle melodies that made anyone who hears it picture a meadow under the golden glow of the spring sun. He continued playing as he watched John stomping down the pavement, obviously eager to have his questions answered. The main door opened, then closed, and was followed by heavy footsteps on the stairs. "John," he started, still playing his violin, as the doctor entered the door to their flat. "You must know that I don't just kiss anyone." His hands stopped moving, then he turned to the doctor, setting the instrument on the table.
The doctor mumbled the headline of the news on the front page, as he walked towards the kitchen to have a cup of delightfully warm morning tea. Sherlock’s gaze followed John’s every movement and he loved the sight of the doctor’s perfectly V-shaped torso, seasoned by military training and exercise. Sherlock could only imagine the feeling of John’s pelvis against the cheek of his arse as he gets viciously fucked, his face buried on a pillow to muffle the wanton moans he–
John whimpered as he licked and sucked on the two fingers that would soon penetrate him, tears forming on the corners of his eyes. When Sherlock deemed his fingers to be slick enough, he removed it from John's mouth half-heartedly, and used it to stretch him. He pushed it in and out excruciatingly slow, then added a second finger. Sherlock scissored John's tight entrance, causing the said man to squirm in pleasure and slight discomfort.
“Hmm,” Sherlock hummed, noting that John’s breathing also started to hitch and that his pupils were darker than normal. He smirked at the surprised doctor and decided to continue what he was doing, now looking directly at John’s eyes.
John breathed erratically as he pounded deeply inside his lover. Sherlock’s muscles tightened and squeezed against his cock, making him cum inside Sherlock. He thrusted a few times more as he rode his orgasm out before removing himself from his lover’s hole, then lay down beside him, satisfied by the intense sex both of them have been dreaming of.
“Fuck,” John grunted under his breath, “Why the hell did you ki–“ the doctor cleared his throat as a blush spread across his face and neck.
"Fuck," John moaned audibly as he felt the warmth enclosing his cock. His legs stiffened in surprise and pleasure as he felt a finger prodding his entrance. "Sherlock," he gasped.
John felt hot and impatient, and the Sherlock’s voice did not do anything to help ease his growing arousal. "Fuck, yes." He replied, grinding his crotch onto Sherlock's thigh. His eyes closed as their mouths connected in a passionate kiss, Sherlock using his tongue to pry open the doctor's mouth. John welcomed the prodding tongue and opened his mouth. For a while, the room was filled by nothing but heavy breathing and moaning .
Sherlock whimpered as he took the two fingers in his mouth, and sucked wantonly. John withdrew his hand and teased Sherlock’s entrance with his slick fingers, first circling one digit on the opening before entering.
“Huh,” John responds absent-mindedly as he scribbles the letters of the word onto the newspaper, licking his lips the way he usually does in the process. Sherlock was unable to resist following that vile tongue that did things to his insides, and John seemed to notice. Whatever.
"Now, John, tell me," Sherlock moved his hand to cup the doctor's cheek, their bodies completely pressed together, "Would you like to continue that kiss?"
John looked at the sudden movement between Sherlock’s legs, then back to his face, his expression that of confusion and excitement. He stood by the door, still as a statue, as he continued watching Sherlock’s masturbation.
John cleared his throat and read the headline of the newspaper. He walked towards the kitchen to satisfy his need for tea, keeping his eyes on the paper he was reading to stave off his embarrassment and unease under Sherlock’s scrutiny.
Sherlock removed his mouth from John's chest with a sharp nip, earning another soft whine from John. He smirked down at John's flushed face a glazed eyes. He let go of John's length and pulled himself out of his pants. Sherlock grabbed himself and John into his hand and started thrusting and stroking in time. John moaned underneath him again, trying to break free of Sherlock's grip to at least grab a hold of him. Sherlock slipped his fingers across there heads, fluid leaking copiously out of them now. Sherlock could feel his hips stuttering against John now, his breath almost puffing harshly out of him. He couldn't stop looking into John's dark eyes. Sherlock felt theat building up intensly, he knew he wasn't going to last any longer, and by the looks of it neither was John. He brought his lips down to John's, completely consuming him. Sherlock thought John was trying to suck the life away fom him in the kiss. Their tongues slipped over each other, John's teeth grazed over his lips. The taste of honey and rosewater pulling him under, nearly drowning him. John groaned long and hard as he spilled into Sherlock's hand, his body pulsating and trembling with release. Sherlock chased after John, cresting in pleasure as he watched John completely slip in his control.
That year was 1982. The year that John crossed all barriers of his known life and became a wizard. John was both scared and enamoured by the prospect of something new. His mother always said that the unknown and dangerous always excited John, and the idea of magic was certainly new and dangerous to him. He finally understood why he accidentally made his sisters things dissapear, or why when he yelled and scream at her, his voise would suddenly go mute without reason. It was also the year that John's father began drinking to cope with the new addition of weirdness in their life.
One such case was when she took them out into the muggle world for some shopping. Sherlock was intrigued by everything and anything that came across his path. He questioned why everyone drove cars, or rode bikes as mean of transportation instead of walking everywhere. He asked about all the little tools and toys that would come across his way and how they could possibly help Muggles further their speed and success in building things. It wasn't until Mrs. Watson took them into a discovery shop that nearly all the questions stopped. Sherlock was fixated on a small little chemistry set that was displayed on the top shelf behind the counter. It was shining and gleaming with glass beakers, tubes and flasks. There was a little bunser burner next to it with a little paper flame attached to the top of it, and twenty or so little jars filled with solvents and acids.
Robes were the next thing to come by, Mrs. Watson only purchased basic robes, but saw fit to the children being fitted. Harriet explained to the woman measuring her that she wanted to stand out at school, be popular and the queen of the entire school. When the woman asked John what he wanted, he just explained he wanted to be as normal as any other child there. Mrs. Watson smiled at her son, and chuckled at her daughter sweetly for her enthusiasm. They left bags full to brim of items for school, and stopped quickly for an icecream.
"The gift I was getting was for you Sherlock, I know you will enjoy it immensely. But don't open it up in the Ravenclaw tower. Come to me when you want to look over it a little more and talk to me about it." John said.
"Well, I wouldn't send the letter to your father. You would probably be disrupting some kind of work at the moment." John laughed nervously.
"It's in their nature Hamish. They can't hide it. They can't ignore it. It's what they are. They are special children." She spoke loudly as she tried to move her way in between the children.
1986 was an amazing year for Sherlock, he was sorted into Ravenclaw. He already had an arch enemy, named James Moriarty, who was in Slytherin. Best of all though, he had John with him all the time. The first few weeks together, they had already scoped out parts of the Dark Forest and had gotten caught by the half giant, Hagrid. They had been caught in the restricted section of the library by Filch, cause Sherlock wanted to learn something besides first year charms. McGonagall also had to pull them aside when Sherlock took John's broom and rode it around the campus chasing after a fourth year girl, who had placed a love potion into one of John's friends, Charlie's drink, and had been caught stealing more ingredients from Snape's potion's closet.
Sherlock watched John as he walked into the kitchen. He kept his gaze low, pretending to be more interested in his failing experiment in front of him than the man in the cream coloured jumper. Sherlock slumped his shoulder slowly and let his eyes flicker back to the experiment in front of him as John moved to the fridge. He listened to the man groan in disgust at the morbid contents on the bottom shelf, before slamming the door of the fridge a little harsher than was necessary. Sherlock smiled to himself at the disgusted look on John’s face as he walked over to the kettle instead to fill up.
"Professor Trelawney has given us a constellation essay. We have to figure out what will be said in our star charts for the month." She responded as Sherlock snorted to himself at the ridiculousness of the class.
Sherlock pushed John further against the table his hands running down to John's belt, his mouth now moving against John's neck, sucking, biting, pretty much just devouring as much of John as he could. Here against John's neck was the taste of sugary, buttery dough, most likely had gotten some smeared there during the cooking process. Sherlock felt as John's hands were now at the hem on his tight trousers, pulling the black slim fit shirt of them, as he was quickly un-zipping John's trousers and trying to pull them down along with his red pants that he seemed to favour. John had now slipped the buttons of Sherlock's shirt, exposing his chest. Hands ran down to the trousers again and quickly made work of the button and fly. He cupped Sherlock's cock, teasingly tracing against the seam of his pants, near the head.
John heard the door open, he buried himself further under the blankets, basically encircling himself so that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to get under them with him. He felt the bed dip next to him, and Sherlock laid next to him, not touching him. Sherlock knew that if he touched John right now that the man would push him away, and most likely off the bed.
John watched as Molly walked of the library heading of down towards the hufflepuff basement . John knew there was a lot that Sherlock was hiding from him lately. It had a lot to do with the fact that him and Molly were getting so much more closer than normal as well. Perhaps there was something there? John thought to himself. He quickly left the library without even a goodbye to Sarah, in his haste to owl Mycroft for some information about the Graves case.
"Well, a boy from your house apparently committed suicide during the summer holidays." Molly said forlornly.
“Fuck you, Sherlock!” John raged from behind the door. Sitting in front of it throwing all his weight into keeping it shut like a child in a tantrum.
Sherlock pushed the pages back in the parcel shaking his head in disbelief. He wrapped his arms around John quickly and hugged him tightly without even realising what he was actually doing. Sherlock coming to on what he had done pulled away quickly and coughed in discomfort as John looked at him in slight shock. Usually he was the one to initiate some sort of physical contact with Sherlock.
They later went into several book stores to pick up their standard books for the first year, all their equipment, and their mother had decided to pay for an owl for them to share. John fell deeply in love with a muddled brown barn owl. His feather were soft and siken, his eyes were deep and dark, and he danced around hooting, playing John right under his wing. Harriet wanted a cat, se loved the small little black kitten staring up at her with curiousity, meowing slightly, as she tried to reach through the cage with her dainty fingers to pet it. Mrs. Watson eventually caved in and both her children a pet each. John named his owl Gladstone. Harriet named her cat Lilith.
John pulled off a little envelope that was stuck against the parcel, opening it to read it. Sherlock, watched as a smile spread against John's face, and a couple of chuckles came out of him as he read the letter. John folded up the letter and placed it inside the envelope. John got up with the parcel in hand and tapped Sherlock on the shoulder, gesturing him to follow him. As they reached the corridor outside the Great Hall John turned to face Sherlock with his stupid smile again. John handed Sherlock the parcel, which weighed a considerable amount.
"Graves? I think Lestrade is on that one. Molly tells me he was here the other day."John said, ruffling the back of his head, trying to figure out how to stop Sherlock sending the letter to his father.
Students would later join in the taunting and jeering after realising Sherlock was a little different from them. They would close in around him and call him names. Sherlock would just stand there and take their abuse with a snide comment or a shrug of his shoulders, but John knew better on how it was affecting Sherlock. He would chase after the humilitaed boy, and wrap his arms around him. Mumbling just to forget everything he heard, and the he wasn't a freak, he wasn't a sociopath. He was remarkable, brilliant, funny, and above all his best friend.
"Well, Geoffery Graves comitted suicide over the holidays as you know, but Auror Lestrade was here the other day, enquiring McGonagall and Dumbledore on some information that could have possibly be left out. So, of course Sherlock wants to know and find out a bit more about the case." Molly said.
John huffed a laugh at the man in front of him. It was unbelievable that to some extent that Sherlock had become a romantic in their relationship. Though half the time John knew that Sherock saying these things was just a way for the man to try to figure out what John was. After all these years Sherlock still had found John interesting to be around. That he was somehow more entertaining than the other people they encountered in the world.
"Well Grave's wasn't exactly stupid Sherlock, he probably knew what he was doing, and I reckon people who contemplate suicide often think about it before doing it." John said. Slowly looking down at the ground and stopping his movements.
"Harry may be the oldest, but it's like by five minutes. She's also a  girl. Just has big hands, and a mad temper." John laughed again at the dark haired boy who shook his head in disbelief.
Sherlock cried as John choked and struggled against his father. He felt something tingling against his body where John was holding him tight. He felt something like this before from his brother, but not as intense as what he was feeling now. He could feel magic building around him, encloving him and John. This was incredible. John was unconciously building his magic for something huge. Sherlock continued to struggle with Mr. Watson's hold on the boy. John gave out one choked scream and everything exploded in a loud bright bang. Sherlock's entire body was wrapped in John's arms. John had forced with all his magic into a huge explosion. His Mother and father had flown across the room on one side, and Harriet had been pushed back. The wand in her hand dropped to the floor in fright. Sherlock felt the warmth tickling his body, it was unbelievably intense. He had never felt magic this strong in his life, not even his brother could have produced something like that intentionally. John looked down at Sherlock, who was looking up at him in awe. John was freaking out, he arms were burning, his body was aching and his mind was muddled mess. He looked around the room and saw his mother trapped underneath his father. He quickly released Sherlock who felt the buzz of magic leave him, and pulled his unconcious father off his mother.
"Oh, yeah. The Graves kid. I thought he just transferred and thats why his friends were crying." Sherlock said.
Sherlock quickly pulled away from John, and started freaking out in his head. John looked completely stunned by the remark. He looked like he also was having trouble processing the words that had been said. Then a smile cracked over John’s face. A beautiful, soft, shy smile. The colour was glowing in fractures across the both of them, the song had changed to another 80s song that Sherlock only vaguely remembered, John reached up and pushed a few of Sherlock errant curls out of his face and pushed up and met Sherlock’s lips in a quick chaste kiss. It like everything about John, was somehow extraordinary. When John pulled away from him, he offered the quirk of a smile and chuckled at Sherlock stunned expression.
"Just a study I have conducted recently." Sherlock says taking his tea and blowing. Smiling over at John who looks at the tree and grinning happily.
Peeves had fun trapping him in closets, throwing things at him as he passed, though he did it to a lot of students who got in his way as well. John had also been a victim of some of Peeves hijinxes from time to time, but he knew how to deal with him now. Especially if he was irritating him with Sherlock in tow. But with Peeves insulting and tormenting Sherlock on a nearly daily basis, it didn't take long for others to notice it.
"Sure, we can go over it through to lunch, and then I have to go for Quidditch practice. You can meet me there again afterwards if you like." John nodded as he let go of Sarah.
Watching John move around, and hearing Rosie shuffle around in the next room quietly babbling to whatever toy was in her grasp, was something Sherlock thought he would never hear or see. He was more than happy at the outcome of John moving back into the flat with Rosie, and even happier when he managed to cross a threshold in their relationship he thought he would never be able to cross. Sherlock looked over at John again. He was standing at the counter with his hands on his hips, waiting patiently for the kettle to reach the boiling point. John’s greying hair fell flat on his head, except for the stupid cowlick that always managed to stick up at the back of his head. The cream coloured atrocity he was wearing looked warm and inviting on the smaller man. Sherlock sighed slightly, silently pushing his experiment away from him. He still had trouble believing that John and Rosie were in his life like this. He imagined that all his lies and his difficulties would have forced John away forever, but somehow the man was in his life, closer than ever.
Lestrade usually hung around a little more at this time, and Mycroft too. Sherlock's annoyance at there presence could be felt all across London. Lestrade would knock on the door in guise of apparently having a case for Sherlock, usually it was a cold one he dug up somewhere. He would sit on the couch as John fed him cake, biscuits, or a slice of tart, with either a coffee or tea to compliment the flavours. Mycroft, would just come to show his "concern", when really all he wanted was whatever baked good John had whipped up in the kitchen that day. It would take at least two to three slices of whatever cake or pie that was cooling on the counter for Mycroft to leave. There would even be a subtle request from Mycroft for the next time he came over, and John stupidly enough ended up cooking it for the bastard anyway.
"Fine. But you can do the questioning when you have the time. You know how I detest talking to idiots." Sherlock said shaking his head away from John's fingers before the pressure felt to good.
Sherlock quickly handed him the report after he was done with it, and looked down at another report that was going through the crime scene. John noticed several plant ingredients that were highly toxic with human congestion, but these weren't even remotely wizard like. These were poisons of wrongly consumed food. John shook his head in confusion, seeing a combination of taro leaves, elderberries and the leaves, and a weird mix of toadstools. So two of the poisons were cyanide and a kind of amatoxin. If untreated these would naturally cause death in anyone. But the death would be horribly painful.
John reached the owlery and found his owl, Gladstone sleeping on a little perch next to Sherlock's spectacled owl Bee. John smoothed his finger against the soft feather of Gladstone, before rolling up the letter and placing it into the little carry tube on the owls leg. Gladstone gave John's fingers a little nip as John told him to be careful on his trip to Mycroft's. John looked over to little Bee, and scruffled the feathers a little while the bird hooted happily at the affection.
“But, I love you John. And Rosie. Both Mycroft and I thought this was the best possible outcome for everyone's safety.” Sherlock continued.
"You little Shit! How dare you talk to me like that. What gives you any reason to talk to me like that?!" Mr. Watson raged loudly.
"Hold on Sherlock, I can't just leave the team in the middle of practice." John frowned over at Sherlock who was twirling in a mass of excitement now.
Sherlock walked down into the Great Hall for breakfast, finding his way to the Ravenclaw table, sitting next to a some kid named Anderson. He looked over at the Gryffindor table to see John animatedly talking to his friend Mike, and chomping into his toast with great appreciation. Sherlock gazed over to the Hufflepuff table to see Molly munching on something while still fixated on the anatomy book John had given her, and Sarah looking over at John, trying to get attention somehow. John seemed completely oblivious to her trying to get his attention, as he was now looking over at Sherlock smiling widely. Sherlock could feel that tightness increase in his chest again as John waved him over to join him and Mike for breakfast. Sherlock scowled a little into his chest as he tried to repel the compressed feeling, while walking over to John. John moved over so he could sit in between him and Mike, and reached over for another piece of toast and a sausage.
Sherlock had only ever met John's father once, he knew he had alcohol problems, gambling promblems, and often called John's mother claiming he would take her back in a hearbeat if she would just stopped with the magic and put the kids into a normal school. Mrs. Watson started ignoring all phone calls from her ex-husband, and waited for the kids to get home if they wished to call him. He came one time during John's holiday's during third year while Sherlock was staying with them for a night. He came pounding at the door like a drunken baboon screaming out for Mrs. Watson to open the door. She stood pressed up against the side of the door, hoping and pleading for him to go away, she was muttering to herself about whether or not she could summon enough courage use some form of spell to whisk him away. Sherlock ever observant watched as she begrudgingly opened the door to the wild man. He came stumbling in, reeking of whiskey and smoke. John quickly stood up chest puffed out and chin high as he looked at his father. He pushed Sherlock behind him along with Harriet. Sherlock could feel Harriet trembling beside him, and John holding steady to his nerve. Brave, strong John, holding onto all his courage.
"It's probably the reason why Sarah constantly tries to leave marks on John, though he never really seems to enjoy it." She said looking at John up in sky smiling away handsomely.
"Yeah." John said shaking himself out of thought. "I'm fine, just lost track of my thoughts for a second." He laughed, scratching te back of his head again.
Sherlock looked back up at the field watching as John chased around other players, knocking the quaffle right out their arms and scoring a point, cheering to himself as he did it. He looked down at some of the people watching the practice game in the stands and noted that there were a few couple from different houses watching and cheering. Sherlock looked down at one couple in particular. She was a slytherin student, cosing up to a hufflepuff boy, her mouth marking his neck with a few purple brusies. His hands buried in her hair as she continued her assult. Sherlock watched as the girl pulled away from the boy and offered him a drink which he happily took. Sherlock's eyes widened as the boy sipped it happily, and they went back to kissing easily.
It usually took about three weeks before Sherlock cracked, and he would have to take control of the situation. It was usually close to Christmas, and John would have decorated the flat with garlands and wreaths. He seemed to like the more contemporary colours that had come out in more recent years. Sticking to copper, gold, silver, black and turquoise, little wooden LED lights hanging delicately, the house looked festive and vibrant. The black christmas tree in the corner of the flat, baubles shining brightly from the stark contrast. John had obviously chosen the colours he liked for the theme, with Sherlock in mind. Cold colours mixed with warm ones, both standing out side by side but complimenting, it just felt like them on a christmas tree. Sherlock being the cold blues, silvers and blacks, and John the warm coppers and gold, even the small wood LED snowflakes were a warm reminder of John.
Sherlock stopped and looked at the door in shock. He could hear John crying into his arm now, trying to muffle the harsh sobs. Sherlock let loose the grip he had on the handle and slid down the door. As soon as his knees made contact with the carpet on the floor he placed his head softly on the door and continued to listen to John cry in the other room. He closed his eyes tightly.
When John was completely changed he sat back down on the bed and raked his fingers through Sherlock's hair playfully, chuckling at the younger boy's lightly flushed buried face. Sherlock grabbed the files as he lifted his head up to meet John's happy smiling face. The fingers slipped out of his hair as John stood back up and nodded to he door for Sherlock to follow him downstairs for quidditch practice. As they passed the common room John found Harriet sitting on the lounge in the common room with her friend again, working hard together on one of their divination essays.
John’s stomach tightened and his thighs trembled, and like a rubber band snapping the tension snapped. John’s vision whited out as he came deep into Sherlock’s mouth, he could feel Sherlock groaning against him when he came, he could feel the hand against his thigh jerking slowly, as Sherlock rode to his completion as well.
Sherlock insulted Sarah whenever he got the chance to do so. He would nitpick about her slight behavioural keys, that he learnt from observing her with John, he would sneer at her when she tried to suggest an observation on one of their cases, and would roll his eyes when she would whisper something provocative into John's ears, which caused John to become a stuttering mess, and completely droll. Sherlock loathed this woman so much it almost hurt to physically look at her.
"That was bloody amazing. I can't believe you knew that all from just looking at me." John beamed at the boy.
1982 was a year that changed John's life. He and his sister left on platform nine and three quaters on an old red steam engine. He travelled across a huge lake, with a terrifying giant squid inside it to reach his school, while he was directed by a man who was almost the size of his house. He was sorted into Gryffindor with his sister right ahead of him. He met some amazing friends called Mike Stamford who was in Hufflepuff, Charlie and Bill Weasley, brothers both in the Gryffindor house. Charlie was a few year older than him and Bill as well. He also met Sherlock's snobby older brother who was in Slytherin. He was a posh old git and was in his fifth year and refused to give anyone the time of day except for a former student who kept coming back to discuss his internship with something called the Aurors, with Professor McGonagall and Headmaster Dumbledore.
“There’s something here. Something I can’t find.” Sherlock answered, feeling John’s voice break whatever hold he had been in.
John hugged Sherlock into his side a little tighter as they walked a lot closer while thinking about Peeves and Sherlock. Sherlock noticing this looked up over at John, seeing his grim face. Sherlock sighed and let John escort him back to the Ravenclaw tower. Once they reached the portrait and it laid it's riddle for Sherlock, he turned to look at John. He just smiled as brightly as he always does, causing a tight feeling to squeeze itself across Sherlock's chest. Sherlock smiled back at him and nodded his goodnight softly to John and entered the portrait and walked up to his dormitory.
Mrs. Watson nodded and reached down into her purse pulling out a pen for John to come claim. John pulled Sherlock along by the arm as he grabbed the pen and smiled at the boy as he pulled the glove off his hand and quickly jotted something down onto the boys hand. Sherlock watched in interest as John wrote something down with a strange looking object, it rather hurt a little too cause it felt slightly sharp. John finished and looked over at his mum giving her back the pen. Sherlock looked down at his hand in awe as he saw a name and an address written down on the back of his hand in ink. Sherlock looked over at the object John's mother had placed back into her bag, and thought to himself that it must be a muggle writing tool.
"You want to be freaks? Is that it?" He bellowed, only now taking notice of Sherlock standing behind John. "Is that one of them. One of those freaks!"
"Mrs. Watson do you know anything about chemistry?" Sherlock looked over at her, almost pleading with his eyes.
"Even so, don't even make them when they're around. They're mine." Sherlock smirked looking down at John's warm smile.
"So what do we know about the Graves kid suicide?" Sherlock asked, eyeing the girl with mild irritation.
Molly who was also in hufflepuff, and one of Sherlock's less than dull friends, would listen to him complain all day about that Stupid Sarah, and her stupid face. Molly knowing all to well, that Sherlock was just a little jealous that John was now giving his attention to someone else, just nodded and sighed in agreemement. Molly liked Sarah. She was actually a really nice person. Popular, smart, cute, and an amazing flyer when she played as one of the chasers on the hufflepuff Quidditch team. She also helped Molly out with a lot of her work.
“John, stop being stupid you know there was no other way to ensure yours and Rosie’s safety.” Sherlock bellowed at the door, trying hard to open it.
"Well, this time, I have a feeling that we could be caught, and I know for a fact that Filch is going to be very irritable tonight considering Peeves has put gum in all the locks of the surrounding corridors." John said, looking down at Sherlock.
"Sherlock, one day you're going to say something so wrong and John's not going to be there to save you." Harry yelled out at the retreating figures.
“But, that’s not fair. I solved a case, saved our lives and have to cook dinner for the rest of the week.” Sherlock grumbled, as he watched John shuck off his jeans at the side of the bed, leaving him completely bare.
"I thought I would send a letter to father. I'm enquiring about a case he could possibly be on." Sherlock said.
"Sherlock, I doubt if you even knew the kid was dead the way you pay attention to the people around you sometimes." John laughed, causing Sherlock to scowl a little. "The only time you notice people is when something seems off."
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand tightly and moved back closer into John space. He leant down and kissed John softly again, taking advantage of it this time. Gently grazing with tender motions, until the both of them were left a little breathless. Sherlock pulled away from John, offering a unsure smile.
"Sherlock, there was a memorial and everything, how could you have forgotten that?" Molly asked in concern.
"Wow, you're tall for seven. Perhaps we can meet again somewhere else, like here, when I'm on break. Mum would definetly be able to bring me." John smiled at the boy reassuringly.
"What about the marks, what's the sense in marking someone?" Sherlock continued, only this time muttering to himself.
"Getting ready for Quidditch practice. Might as well get changed here since you're still prattling on." John said pulling out his quidditch from his trunk.
"Yeah, we did a little in science, but nothing involving those. We learnt mostly about the earth and our bodies, nothing else though." John explained to Sherlock.
"The freshness of the bruises on his neck is something to consider, also how quickly after there copulation did he consume the vial, or what did he think the vial was for." I need more than a toxicology report on this, I need the pathology one as well. I need the levels of dopamine that was going through his body. Any fluids found. I need more information than one Mycroft sent John." Sherlock stood up bringing Molly with him.
Mrs. Hudson really enjoyed John at this time. He was a lot more allocating to her meddling in the flat. She would hover over him every now and then, telling him which kind of chocolate would be best for this simple dessert, or what brand of butter was more "buttery" out of all of them. The only time Sherlock had some sort of input on this whole thing, was when John would grab an inferior jar of honey for the honey cakes. Sherlock couldn't have that happening. Sherlock wouldn't be surprised during this time if he found John and Mrs. H floating around the kitchen with a pot of tea steeping in the corner of the counter, and her hovering over John as he creamed butter and brown sugar together.
"Well, I'll always be around to curb what you say. You can't survive without me." John laughed boisterously as Sherlock, waved his arms flabbergasted trying to defend that he could survive without John to come to his aid.
"How about I get this for you Sherlock, as long as you promise not to cause anymore trouble for the rest of week." She winked as Sherlock beamed enthusiastically.
Sherlock loved the excitement of going to Hogwarts. It was something new and dangerous. Something that could keep his busy mind preoccupied. He loved how his houses portrait door would give riddles to get into the the dorm. He loved trying to figure out all the other houses passwords to see if he could sneak into the dorms unnoticed. He loved his classes, hated certain teachers, loathed most of the other children in his House or just around the school, and learnt how to convince professor Mcgonagall that whatever he was doing to get into trouble, was just to solve a case or a puzzling problem. It was one of the most exciting thing Sherlock had ever experienced.
"Cool. Well It was great meeting you Sherlock. Please write." John said as he took his bags and his sisters bags in both hands and nodded to the boy as the family toddled off to the entry way at the Leaky Cauldron, their little trolley fulled to the brim with books and parcels.
John looked down at Sherlock with slight chuckle, knowing that he was trying to be polite not to say anything on the matter of divination classes. Though it did go notice by Harry she just sighed into her paper and looked up Sherlock.
John flew over closer and hopped off his broom in front of her Sherlock. He smiled happily down at the beaming boy, and the blushing Molly, who looked as though she had lost the function to breathe. Sherlock grabbed John robes and started pulling him along in excitement to continue on with the case.
He headed off to the Gryffindor common room to see Harriet talking to one of her friends on the couch. She was cosying closer to the girl who had her arm wrapped around her comfortingly. John quickly said a hey to her and ran up to his dorm to find Mike on his bed concentrating throughly on the Ancient Runes essay they have to have done by tomorrow. He quickly grabbed his ink and quill, with a small piece of parchment and jotted down a note.
"And John's relationship with Sarah is?" Molly chuckled slightly, while Sherlock threw her a filthy look.
"You wouldn't happen to know what wrong with Sherlock, would you?" John asked the owl, who just continued to hoot happily.
Sherlock watched as Mrs. Watson tried to pull the man away with all strength, as he inched closer to John. Harriet took her oppourtunity to run into the kitchen, trying to pull Sherlock with her. But he wouldn't budge. Sherlock stood his ground behind John, his eyes flickering over the man's dishevelled appearance. He could see the obvious signs of alcoholism etched into every corner of the mans enraged face. The red spider veins climbing on his nose, the bleary blood shot look in the eyes. numerous crumbs and stains on the mans skin, indicating he was not even aware of what was clinging to his face, and the staggering violence he was emitting from the focused look he had on John.
“John, you open this door now!” Sherlock growled grabbing the handle and throwing his body weight into the door now.
"Fine, Sherlock. Don't listen to me and be miserable." Molly sighed as she opened the book and grabbed a piece of parchment and quill, choosing now to ignore Sherlock since he was being cruel again.
"She'll deal with it I imagine. Just let me break for Quidditch practice though." John laughed as Sherlock nodded.
“Good. It has to be what I want, it can’t just be toast with the ‘good’ honey.” Sherlock smirked over at John, who was chuckling.
Molly quickly made her move and flittered down to the entrance of the library, finding John looking staring where Sherlock must have left and Sarah trying to get John's attention back on her. John closed his eyes and sighed, leaving Sarah's arms moving a little closer to Molly's concerned expression.
John looked beside Sherlock in alarm. He had obviously had enough of being insulted and decided to take things into his own hands. Unfortunatly for Sherlock, was that he didn't really know what he was dealing with, and he had no control over any of his magic as well. He wasn't legal to perform anything to defend himself with. John took Sherlock's hand in his hands and pulled him behind him forcefully again, and gave the boy a angry look, mentally telling him to shut up. Mr. Watson grabbed John by the collar, trying to yank him away from Sherlock. Mrs. Watson now had a hold of her ex husbands torso and was trying to pull the man towards the door as hard as she could.
Unfortunatly it was also the year that John's mother divorced his father, and he began drinking more to cope with what his children were. John fought constantly with his father, trying to show that he was not scared of who he was, and what he could do. It was also the year his mother moved to London, causing a huge rift between the lines of his family. The only person John talked about this to was Sherlock.
Sherlock growled in irritation with John's hands and grabbed both of them quickly and placed them above his head against the table. He confined them into one grip tightly, the other wandering down John's chest, pulling up the thick bulky sweater and shirt. Sherlock, placed soft kisses against the newly exposed skin. John struggled against Sherlock's grip slightly, as he felt lips against one of his nipples, and a hand now pulling against his cock. He whined slightly into his throat as Sherlock ran the tip of his thumb against the head smearing pre come over the head. Sherlock started thrusting slightly against John, trying to relieve the pressure in his groin.
"Well Grave's has been in a sexual relationship, that much I can tell." John replied with a bright blush on his face looking back at the toxicology. "Also these posions are a bit strange for wizards or witches. There has been cyanides and amatoxins found in his system, and traces of taro leaves, elderberries and their leaves and toadstools. That really strange." John said looking at Sherlock, who also looked perplexed and slightly flushed at the mention of the sexual relationship of the victim.
"It wasn't hard. I just spoke about your current attitude, and that you having something to look at, or a case to go through would pick you up." John smiled, as Sherlock thought back to last night with a smile.
"Ah, well I hope they enjoy it." Sherlock responded, feeling a little miffed at the idea of John buying other people presents.
“John, I don’t understand you. You seem simple like most of the imbeciles in this world.” Sherlock began.
“Yes, Sherlock.” John laughed, causing Rosie to squeal in delight in her playpen. Obviously thinking that they were both playing a game.
Sherlock knowing that he was being ignored huffed again and left Molly to her studies. Molly sighed as she heard a pile of books slam to the floor and Sherlock yelling at someone to move out of his way . She could hear the muffled voices of John and Sarah asking him if he was okay, but all they got in return was a shout at for being stupid again and not knowing anything. Molly closed the book and moved the parchment from her lap and waited for the silence that would indicate that Sherlock had left the library.
“Hmm, you have to cook dinner for the week. And it can’t just be toast with honey on it: John chuckled at Sherlock’s grimace.
Sherlock shuffled down further on the bed on his side and looked at John’s now tired looking face. He smiled and wrapped an arm around John, trying to pull the stockier man closer. John grizzled slightly and allowed himself to be pulled over.
He could see John smiling brightly over at him again as he was handing him the parcel, and could feel the stupid hug he had given him in over excitement. Sherlock shook his head stupidly, feeling his face go hot and red as he thought about John again. His chest tightly restricting him again. Sherlock ran over the possible ides of why he could be feeling like this. Molly looked over at Sherlock, who was still currently shaking his head, obviously trying to remove something from his mind.
“I had no choice John, what if you and Rosie had been hurt.” Sherlock yelled after the smaller man, trying hard to keep up with the storming John.
John learned his love for potions, even if Professor Snape was a bit cold and demeaning. He loved defense against the dark arts, herbology, flying, history of magic. The only thing he grew bored of was Muggle studies. But the best thing was that someone other than his Mum wrote to him all the time. Sherlock Holmes, the boy with a million thoughts running through his head, and a million answers to give if anyone had any.
"I wonder why he could be in such a foul mood all the time." Sarah asked john, who shrugged his shoulders unknowingly.
Mr. Watson sneered at his daughter as she continued to point the wand at him. His hands tightened around John, encaving the boys throat. Harriet looked at her Mother, who was still trying to pry the man's arms away from John's throat. The grip around John's throat squeezed him severily. Sherlock was now fighting at the man's hands, using his nails to dig into the skin hard, even going so far as to bite the mans arm when he could see the pressure force on John's throat. Harriet started hyperventilating, her mind muddling in fear at her father. She mustered a huge amount of courage and started to think of a possible defense spell to fly her father away, but nothing was coming to mind. John looked down at Sherlock, biting his father's hands, clawing at the fingers, trying in vain to free him. He could feel his mother tugging hard behind his father, trying to fight against the weight and strength of her ex-husband. John could see Harriet freaking out in front of him, trying to find something in her head to use against her father.
“You didn’t even factor in on how this would make me feel though. You never factor in what could happen, if things go horribly wrong. You’re a complete idiot.” John spoke harshly through the door.
"Yep, but you're only allowed to play with it if I'm supervising. I don't think your parents would know to much about this." She laughed as Sherlock bounced up and down excitedly.
The only thing that John could really remember was how angry his father was that day. He had never been told about his wife's secret life, he was never told the potential his children could have, or the fact that their was even magic. He became distraught as he watched his wife bring magic into their house, and the children would watch in delight as she would transfigure pots and kettles into birds of many different colours, or charm the dishes into washing themselves. He yelled and screamed for answer to her secrecy for days, the only reply she gave was that she had to hide her magic for so long because of the current war.
"Oh, he just really needs as a case, and the way to get the information he needs is to either talk to his father or ask Mycroft." Molly explained.
"I asked your brother last night. You have been so moody lately, that I thought a good case would make you happy. Plus Mycroft has some sort of power over Lestrade so I knew he could get it easily." John explained happily.
"Perhaps we should ask some of his friends if they knew he was dating anyone?" John said, ruffling his fingers through Sherlock's tangled curls.
John left his place on the floor and crawled over to the bed. Burying himself under the covers. He closed his eyes and started to breathe in deeply, trying to calm himself completely. He thought of Rosie downstairs with Mrs. Hudson and smiled a little to himself as he remembered her waving bye bye to him and Sherlock before they left on the case. Thinking of Rosie being safe always calmed him down. Her little curls in teal bows that Sherlock had struggled to do. Her chubby arms waving excitedly at him. John had known that Sherlock would always come back to him and Rosie, it still hurt though to watch the man he cared most about have a gun pointed at him. John could still hear the ringing of gunfire echoing around in his head. If he had just be in the know of the situation at hand he probably wouldn’t be so angry at Sherlock. But he fact is he wasn’t told the plan, and he had to watch the man he loved be shot at.
Mike started talking about his Ancient Runes essay over with Sherlock seeing if he could help him with any of the information that he could have possibly missed. Mike was often in trouble with this class, and Sherlock had no idea why Mike was taking the subject if it troubled him this greatly. Sherlock pointed out several mistakes along the page to Mike when a screeching could be heard over head, indicating the daily mail was in-fluxing into the the Great Hall. Sherlock looked above as what appeared to be hundreds of owls were flying above them, each looking for it's own master. Sherlock could see John's barn owl with an incredibly large manila envelope, happily flitting down next to him. John took the package off him, and gave the owl a little scratch on the head while feeding him a couple crumbs of toast to him.
"Time to go Sherlock, you're causing too much trouble again." John laughed at Harry looked up from her paper in annoyance at the younger boy.
"What about your brother, he could get them for you." Molly suggested as Sherlock puffed out a laugh of air.
John remained quiet under the covers, his eyes open looking at the warm glow of light from under the covers.
"As much as it pains me to agree with you Sherlock, yes this assignment in particular is incredibly painful and stupid." Harry muttered, earning a bright grin fom her friend.
“I only did what I thought would keep you and Rosie safe. Mycroft saw to my safety, you know he wouldn’t let anything happen to me.” Sherlock said gently, still listening to the harsh breathing from the other side of the door.
Sherlock walked along with Molly in tow. He quickly deposited off the package in his dorm in his trunk to hide, and grabbing his potions books before heading off to the dungeons with Molly. When they sat down at their tables bringing out all the little piece of equipment from the potions closet, they started looking over the black board to see what today's potion was going to be. Sherlock grimaced as Anderson next to Molly when he brought out his equipment, and started going over the list of ingredients. Molly pulled out her belongings as well and looked over at Sherlock, who now seemed to be sporting a small flush to his face. Molly shrugged it off as just him being irritated with having someone that he didn't really like sit with them again.
Sherlock was lying in bed completely relaxed and happy. He was staring at John again, but he always seemed to stare at John. The sunlight was filtering through the curtains, bathing the sleeping John in a warm glow. Sherlock smiled to himself as John let out a small snore. It was rare to wake up before John when there wasn't a case. John was usually up by now, starting breakfast now, preparing for when Rosie would start making a ruckus, demanding attention and to be fed.
"Well I don't know Sherlock, it's rude to even ask someone that." Molly hissed softly trying to Sherlock from looking at the couple.
"Yes Sherlock. That's a chemistry set. It's very similar to potions, but uses acids and bases to find a cause or to create an effect. All life stems from the ideas and notions behind chemistry and physics. Muggles find differnt ways through these to find out the mysteries of life. It's even been known to help solve police and auror cases." Mrs. Watson winked as Sherlock looked back in awe at the Chemistry set.
“Nope, this is a punishment Sherlock, you can’t bargain.” John smiled as he shifted to move out of the bed,
Sherlock had always felt terrible for how he left John. He hadn’t imagined that it would have left such scars with the man, but it had. John was incredibly brave and intelligent, but he was still human. He would always bare the scars of Sherlock’s fake death, and Mary’s death as well. And Sherlock always seemed to forget that John feared the he and Rosie would be left behind, and that he would become useless mess again. Sherlock sighed, ruffling his hands through his hair agitatedly. He always seemed to make John upset in some way. Now he had opened a can of worms that John obviously didn't want to open.
"Close. I'm a nurse. I work on muggles and what can heal their bodies." Mrs. Watson continued as she looked at the set with a smile.
Sherlock released his hand from John and unbuttoned his tight pants and took himself in hand. He took John’s cock as far as he could into his mouth and swallowed against it. John groaned and started fisting the sheets below him, Sherlock mouth torturing him in slow deep movements. He could feel the bumping of Sherlock’s hand against his leg, as the younger man pumped himself slowly. John’s eyes flew open when he felt Sherlock’s tongue move against the underside of his cock, his hips moving in time with the motion of Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock grabbed John’s hand from the sheet and moved it to his head, making John guide him at the speed he wanted.
John placed the report down and looked over Sherlock's shoulder again for information about the crime scene itself. The boy had been found laying on the ground face down in a bathroom, most places where suicide victims seemed to be found, and there was a large empty vial laying next to him, with traces of the toxins found in it. It certainly did seem like a suicide given the situation, but there seemed to be something more to it.
"Get John to ask him then." Molly said as she looked down beside her  for the anatomy book John was lending her.
"You won't be seeing him for a while, you probably won't be able to see him again." She sighed, standing up and taking her children's hands.
Sherlock noted the nervous tick and left the subject closed, knowing that it was most likely a touchy subject that he was thinking about. Sherlock looked back down at reports and flicked them around in his hands before placing them back in the parcel carefully. John quickly removed his shirt and tie, when Sherlock looked back up at John in slight concern. John's face was constricted tight in thought, his lips pursing slightly. One his shirt was fully removed John stood there with his Quidditch shirt in hand as he began shaking his head, removing the thoughts. Sherlock flushed at John's tanned chest and buried his face into John's bedding, trying to ignore the older boy now putting on his shirt and changing his pants.
Sherlock stayed alongside Molly for four months of John's dating. Helping her with her work, watching as she played around in the herbology labs, following her into her library, to escape the stupid faces of John and Sarah kissing each other in the Great Hall. It wasn't until Sherlock became so fed up with it that he shouted in anger into his pillow and groaned that he finally started to think up of a plan to remove this girl from John.
"No. Well elderberries can be, but you have to boil them, cook them, actually quite a lot of things before you can consume them. I think Taro is more common in asian countries, but you never eat the leaves. But everyone knows you're not suppose to eat toadstools. That seems like common knowledge for everyone considering the colouring."John explained.
It’s an arduous trek to Sherlock’s bedroom from there on out; hands moving to grapple clumsily with one another’s clothes while their mouths stay locked together. There’s a precarious moment, when they both attempt to toe off their shoes and socks at once, that they nearly end up in a tangle on the carpet, but they manage to keep one another upright by pausing to take turns. There’s a crash from somewhere by the dining table when Sherlock sends a shoe flying with a kick, and he pauses with John's earlobe pinched between his teeth as he deliberates whether anything especially concerning has been knocked over.
“My Dear,” Stamford smiles brightly. “Watson here is in search of a mate.” He casts an eye about and lowers his voice. “It seems that he has only his good name left to recommend himself. Harry’s squandered it all.”
“Hardly a difficult deduction. Given the nature of her occupation, it was either that or an illegitimate child. And, being an Alpha, she’s certainly isn’t about to have one of

He should be pleased to hear it; exuberant, really. It’s exactly what he’s been waiting his whole life to hear; clear, concise, and completely uncomplicated.
On the sofa, John closes his eyes momentarily and takes a deep breath, as if to steady himself. “I’ll thank you to know that I’m perfectly capable of self-control Mycroft, ta very much.”
well known amongst the elite set as somewhat of a playboy. He’s been staying at the Cavendish home since Philip's departure to the Gulf. The very picture of the devoted younger sibling; loyally attending to his brother’s home and bonded in his extended absence. Terribly quaint. Of course, going by her calendar, he’s practically spent every waking hour with her over the past several months. Which seems a bit excessive for simple fraternal duty, doesn't it?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, plowing on with a dismissive flick of his fingers.
“He’s had a scan and all the possible testing done. All of it. Everything looks good— fantastic actually. I checked it all over myself. He’ll need some feeding up, yeah, but that’s not a surprise to anyone, and I think I’m more than equipped to handle that. Especially if he has reason to cooperate for once.” His deep blue gaze is calm and unyielding as it meets Mycroft’s head on. “You can’t hold his mistakes over his head forever.”
“Ah,” Sherlock hums impassively, then pipes up again after a beat in what John recognizes as his coolly detached ‘scientist voice’. “The sudden introduction of the scent of a potential alpha rival where before there was an Omega dep-”
they depart. He has to button his coat up over the bloody mess of his shirt-front, but once it’s done, he has no trouble at all flagging down a cab.
“You left it in the pocket of your second-best dressing gown, you clot.” She laughs, resting her head on her hand tiredly. “I managed to sneak it out when they thought I was having a cry.” He gawks between the two of them, completely bewildered as Sherlock thanks her and tosses it in the air jauntily before tucking it into his coat.
There are no more pheromones leaving him in a buzzy state of bliss, entirely convinced that he could have what he wanted so very badly, without any consequences. Much more importantly, in worryingly short order, there is quite suddenly no Sherlock.
John — I’m pregnant. There’s no getting around the fact that we obviously had intercourse,” Sherlock barrels on without so much as a blink. “But, given the impact the duration of my cycle suppression was expected to have had upon my fertility, we hadn’t thought conception to actually be possible. In
He opens his mouth to lash back viciously, just as John pipes up from the sofa. He’s closed his laptop and settled it quietly on the table, and cradles his mug between his two hands as he leans forward earnestly in his seat.
quite particular about the Holmes lineage.” He drops dramatically back over the arm of his chair to sprawl across it delightedly.
They’re the same sheets that he and John had shared his heat in. He’d found them shoved into the deepest reaches of the upstairs cupboard while searching for an old disguise of his last week, and surreptitiously smuggled them down to slip back onto his bed. John had clearly tried laundering them repeatedly, but nothing
“Mrs. Cavendish, I’m Detective Inspector Lestrade,” Lestrade turns to introduce himself to Marie, flashing his badge briefly. “In light of our recent discoveries regarding your Alpha’s death, we've taken your brother-in-law into custody on suspicion of homicide. Before we did so, he disclosed to us the, uh, full nature of your relationship.” He sits down next to Sherlock and pulls his phone and notepad from his pocket. He waves his phone about to display it clearly as he sets it to record and then places it and the side table to the right of Marie. “Mr. Holmes here is one of Scotland Yard’s consultants. Due to his input, we’re well aware of your... um,
Not for the first time, he wonders just what it is about Harry that inspires such patience in his sister-in-law. He isn’t sure what she did to win the unwavering devotion of someone like Clara, but she’s damned lucky she did.
And when they’re tangled together, with John buried deep inside of him and his own cock trapped between the sweaty press of their bodies, rubbing against that soft, warm curve of flesh...
Sherlock sits in wait on the front step of 221, his coat left hanging on a hook just inside the foyer, he tilts his face up into the sunshine with a smile, listening to the screech of the gulls. He’s pulled out of his reverie when familiar jeep pulls up to the kerb, cans rattling noisily on strings in it’s wake, and horn blaring. John, dressed outrageously in a morning suit and top hat, leaps up from the driver’s seat to stand on the runner-board.
“Ta,” he grins wolfishly,crawling up over Sherlock’s body to nip playfully at his lower lip with a friendly growl. “Your turn.” He grasps the waistband of Sherlock’s pants and begins to slowly peel them downward. “God,” He huffs. “These feel extraordinarily expensive. Do I even want to know how much a pair of them cost?”
“Too bad,” she smirks, then reaches out to pat his knee. “Off you pop and talk to people,” she directs him.
In the dim light and quiet of the room, it feels as though they’ve created a pocket in time that’s just their own; separate from the rest of the world.
He gives a pleased hum and wraps one long-fingered hand around the base of it, giving it a solitary stroke before leaning in. He keeps his eyes fixed on John's as he laves his tongue wetly up from his fingers to over the head before taking it into his mouth. John chokes and bows forward over Sherlock’s head slightly in surprised pleasure, his eyes falling shut with a hiss.
It would be easy to chalk it up to his usual post-deduction disinterest, but the fact that the case is very much so unconcluded tells John that something is different than usual. Though Lestrade doesn’t seem as terribly bothered by it as John is.
“Oh!” Irene exclaims as if just having recalled something of importance, “Jim Moriarty sends his love.” Irene announces with a delighted sneer, and Sherlock raises his head attentively in his seat.
“Oh! And these,” Lestrade adds, digging into the bag again to pull out a number of salt and vinegar crisp packets. “John said you've been absolutely barmy for them lately. And they had them on offer when I nipped into Tesco Express for lunch.”
he waspishly attempts to remind it as he watches Mrs. Hudson loudly make a scene with Mr. Chatterjee inside of Speedy's,
genes were destined to fall by the wayside until now. A child with my genetic material is unlikely to have anything below exceptional intelligence and you're not unintelligent yourself.”
thought he was ‘remarkably intelligent’? The man must have been pretty bloody brilliant in that case.” John scoffs, his face pinched in an oddly resentful manner. It’s easily identifiable as jealousy, though Sherlock can’t imagine why. John’s normally quite accepting of his exceedingly average intellect, and only grows snappish about any disparity if he’s overly hungry or Sherlock has made too many quips at his expense.
Omega. He doesn't miss the small, sidelong glance Sherlock shoots his way as he does it. It has him drawing himself up a little straighter.
John rubs his palms against the fabric of his chair’s arms and stares down at the hearth as he thinks back on it; remembering the look of panic that had flickered briefly in Sherlock’s eyes before they’d gone carefully blank. The way he’d so suddenly and uncharacteristically
John offers a wolfish grin, then tips him back onto the mattress with a gentle push. “So unless you've got any other objections, I think we should get you out of these pesky clothes, hm?”
He takes the tube rather than a cab, allowing himself the extra time to panic. If it wasn’t before, it’s undeniable now; in spite of his best efforts, he’s well and truly
“Yes,” Molly nods solemnly. “More than forty years ago now. It's been his whole lifetime, basically. So obviously the St. Juniperus system has been a big deal for him. The biggest deal! Of course now, until he passes over- goes permanent- he's on a five-hour weekly limit. I guess you're the same.”
No; thankfully he'd moved the container of dermestid beetles into the kitchen the day before last; after John had pitched a fit over discovering them atop the stack of books next to his chair, when they’d popped home for a mid-case kip and change of clothes.
activity,” Sherlock explains and a wave of understanding, followed closely by amusement ripples across John’s expression. He raises his eyebrows pointedly at Sherlock; the gesture clearly meant to reference the
Despite the dosage of his suppressants, which have always have tidily kept those sort of thoughts at bay, he finds himself quite helplessly aroused every time John so much as
“Not exactly,” John says and puts the newspaper on top of the table and strides towards Sherlock, tea cup in hand, settling on the couch in front of him. “For some, it may help in building their vocabulary.”
Sherlock’s eyes followed the movement in a way that made him want to see those eyes wet with tears as the owner of those said eyes begs for relief. John felt the cold on his skin and cursed at himself for wearing such a confining shirt.
John moved his kisses down to Sherlock’s abdomen, exhaling against his navel, as he massaged both of his inner thighs tantalizingly slow. “Not yet.” John sat up and folded Sherlock’s legs, placing them against his torso to reach the neglected hole. “Now,” John said breathily as he moved his hand near Sherlock’s mouth, two fingers extended, “Suck.”
John jolted out of his trance, his eyes widening. "What was that? Could you say that again, please?"
Sherlock noticed John’s efforts and licked his lips to relax him. “John,” he whispered, “Let me hear you.” He pulled almost completely out of John, then immediately rammed himself back in, hitting John's prostate until he neared his climax.
“Whatever happens to you in the next few moments, Sherlock,” John muttered breathlessly, “Is a consequence of your incessant seduction, whether you were aware of doing so or not.”
Sherlock sighed as he sat alone on the couch in the living room of 221B. John went out a few minutes ago to purchase some groceries, leaving Sherlock to his devices. His vulgar thoughts towards his flatmate still flooded his brain and he can feel his body heat up from the inside. Sherlock looked at his groin and found that he was completely, painfully erect.
A curve suddenly found its way on the corners of Sherlock’s lips, his arousal becoming more evident, when he replied huskily, “Anything, John.”
, he thought as his hand snaked to the inside of his trousers. He grabbed his member to ease some of the frustration that he was feeling and slowly moved his hand up, grazing the wet tip with his thumb in the process, then down as he traced the swollen veins with his forefinger. He closed his eyes to focus his senses on the feeling he took from the stimulation, not noticing that the door opened and he was no longer alone.
“Hng, John!” Sherlock called when he came, his release spilling on his stomach and on John’s abdomen.
“Hmm,” hummed Sherlock as he continued walking, away from the irate doctor, chuckling as he wondered how long John could stay away from him.
His name coming out of Sherlock’s mouth was the last push he needed to lose his self-control. Sherlock was startled when his wrists were grabbed, and was even more so when John moved his hands under Sherlock’s knees and on his back to carry him like how a newly-wedded man carries his wife.
And that was it. Sherlock knew that his efforts did not betray him, and that John only needed one more nudge to awaken the dormant beast inside him.
