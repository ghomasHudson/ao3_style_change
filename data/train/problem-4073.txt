“You are teasing me again,” Castiel said. His attempt to sound unaffected failed spectacularly due to the distracting things that Dean was doing to him below.
“So take him to a five-star restaurant,” Sam supplied next. “Wait, no, that’s really not your scene, huh?”
Her tone was biting and sarcastic. Claire fell silent and stared at the wooden trim of the door frame. She rubbed her thumb over the edge of smooth cherry and frowned deeply.
Dean and Cas get in the Christmas Spirit, Castiel’s mentorship with Claire deepens, and Castiel goes to take care of his ducks and ends up bringing home a stray.
and eating Christmas cookies that Ellen had brought over for dessert. Her and John had long since left—headed to the airport for a week away on some tropical island out in the Caribbean (John’s gift to her)—leaving just Sam, Jess, Cas, Dean, Jo, Charlie and Jack in the apartment.
Castiel feels the panic grip him at the thought and reaches for the corner of his dresser to keep his feet.
Something in Dean broke then, just a little. Dean pulled Castiel into the circle of his arms, one hand at the back of his head, hugging it to his.
It was not a pretty thought, but somehow thinking it and knowing it was something he kept in his back pocket in the event he needed good material for blackmail made Dean feel better.
Castiel sucked in his breath at the way Dean purred the last word into his ear, then lost it in a surprised gasp as Dean took the tender appendage into his mouth. He licked delicately along the ear’s rim, drawing a low moan from his captive audience.
“Okay, I’m a little pissed,” he admitted, “But not why you think. I’m pissed cuz you didn’t trust I’d say yes.”
Castiel’s breathing caught and he drew in a sharp inhale, attempting to regain control and explain what happened. When Castiel did finally speak again, his voice had dropped to barely above a whisper.
, and not in a good way. Did’ja know you can get sand burns? Cuz I sure as hell didn’t.” Castiel paused in his administrations and laughed into Dean’s navel. Dean squirmed under him and grumbled, “Hey, that tickles. I was being serious.”
“Call if you need anything,” Dean cuts in, “I’m granting you Honorary Winchester Family status. You call, we come. No questions asked.”
When Dean pulled up to the curb and put Baby in park, Claire shoved open the door and for a moment Dean thought she was going to leave without saying anything else, but then she paused as she was halfway out of the car.
“Marlene, thank you. I… I don’t know what to say…” Castiel said. He surveyed the room in awe as he played with the strap to his music bag.
Jacob finds the hunter in his room studying the spell they’re using in the morning. He leans against the door frame.
“I think I am getting the hang of this,” he said, which was the precise moment he remembered to keep his knees bent a moment too late. He collapsed in a heap on his ass.
Dean nodded. He followed Castiel as he wound his way through the crowd, eyes peeled for a flash of long, red hair.
“Course that doesn’t mean—” Dean broke off, jabbing his fork into the pie again. “Neither way is the
When they arrived back at the motel, Cas helped him inside and set him down on the bed. He pressed a bottle of water into Dean’s hand, which Dean drank thirstily. He could feel the djinn’s poison slowly draining away.
A few minutes later there was a knock at the door. Dean opened it and through it came a squealing blur of red.
“I know you do. Hell, I’m gonna need a few years myself after this whole deal, let me tell ya,” Dean says. He scratches at his nose with his finger and averts his eyes. “But I, uh…had one other thing to tell you before…well, you know.”
Castiel was attempting to read or what. He did know that the look Cas was throwing him made him nervous, like maybe he underestimated the man somehow.
“Uh…” Justin glanced at Brian, who was standing next to Castiel with a look on his face that Justin had only seen once before. Brian caught his eyes and he nodded almost imperceptivity. “Uh…sure. What, are you going to read my palm or something?”
,” Dean gasped emphatically, hanging his head back as Cas proceeded to obliterate his neck. Lips and tongue and teeth in a crazy, hazy swirl that left him lightheaded. Then his shirt was off and Castiel was lowering down to his chest. Dean slumped against the surface of the pool table and groaned loudly when he started flicking at his nipple with the tip of his tongue, then taking it gently between his teeth with a slight graze. Flick and nip. Flick and nip. It was driving Dean mad.
Things with a teenager in the house were…illuminating to say the least. Jack was respectful and polite most of the time, but he had a tendency to anger quickly in certain situations and on a couple occasions actually snapped at Castiel. Both times Jack got a faraway, terrified look in his eyes and apologized immediately. Both times Castiel told him it was okay, but that he should watch his temper and if he got angry should take three long breaths or try counting to ten before answering.
worried. It felt good knowing he had Sam’s support behind them, made him believe that maybe he could do this after all.
by this small infraction, that for a moment Dean forgot that he hadn’t actually done anything wrong. Still, it was hard not to feel guilty for lying when Cas then asked quietly, “Why didn’t you say anything?”
“You realize I’m a bartender and I hear that pickup line on a daily basis, right?” she said, “You’re going to have to do better than that.”
they had almost kissed right here in the middle of the party with his dad front and center. Dean felt his heart thud unpleasantly against his chest, his stomach suddenly turned sour.
“Yes, perhaps we should…ahh…we probably shouldn’t rush this,” Castiel struggled to say. He tapped his fingers against the mug in his hand. His voice dropped to just above a whisper. “But it is…a nice thought,” he admitted.
Tessa washed her hands in the sink and put on a fresh pair of gloves, then moved back over to where Castiel was waiting on the exam table.
, which was also ludicrous) he didn’t want to show him a person he wasn’t. Which is why he chose a slate-blue tee and army-green shirt under his favorite leather jacket and a pair of worn yet stylish jeans.
Across the bar, Em reached across the table and took the bottle from Sam’s fingers, setting it aside. He grabbed Sam by the hand.
Sam sputtering with a face full of Dean’s dirty sock is one of the more memorable moments of the night.
“Uh. Y-yeah. Anna’s just…she’s just a friend. She helped set us up,” Dean explained. He let out the breath he’d been holding. Well. At least that much was true.
Dean trailed off, finally getting the box open. He pulled out the contents and held it up to look at it.
Dean blinked and dragged his eyes up off the sidewalk to look at him, realizing he hadn’t said a thing to Cas beyond a generic greeting. Now he was looking at Dean in concern, his brow furrowed deeply. Dean hesitated, lips working soundlessly until he found the courage to speak.
Alex is. I found myself appreciating her character so freaking much here. The third was all the singing. I intended on Cas and Alex singing, not on Dean chiming in too, but hey, the boy was insistent. For those interested, Dean is singing Alice and Cooper's "You and Me," and Cas responds with Rod Stewart's "You're In My Heart." I've had both stuck in my head on repeat for near on two weeks now and it's awesome. Still working on putting together a formal soundtrack that I plan on releasing once this whole thing is finished.
, but he’s grateful to have Cas on his side. Then Cas starts talking about the apocalypse again and Dean tunes out the whole ‘
“Yeah, well, you have a pretty messed up way of showing it!” Dean snaps at him, “I mean, what was that bull about not getting what you want—oh.” Dean breaks off suddenly. “Wait, you mean—?”
“What, indeed,” Charlie replied mysteriously, her accent slipping for just a moment—and Dean could just barely detect the smugness in her voice. He scrubbed a hand over his face and did his best
They walked in amiable silence, weaving around dog walkers and bicyclists and people jogging in the park. When the pond came into view, Dean figured it out.
Dean merely shrugged to say it had been uneventful for him as well and stole a bite of the thing simmering on the stove. Jambalaya, as it turned out. Dean let out a whimper as it burned his tongue. Castiel tutted at him and shot him a look that said he deserved it. Dean kissed him again with the taste of cayenne still on his tongue.
Cas turned to the young man by his side—the same man who had led the mass earlier. He was dressed in long white robes and seemed to be around the same age as Castiel, with light, sandy-blond hair and clear, grey-blue eyes that crinkled at the corners, mouth thin and wide with dimples that appeared on either side when he smiled. His face was smooth and kind, made younger by the lack of worry lines on it that Dean supposed was a result of his faith. There was a purple scarf draped around his shoulders that was almost as long as his robes. Dean was pretty sure they didn’t call that a scarf, but he didn’t know the correct term for it. Habit? Nah, that was the thing nuns wore. Dean drew a nervous breath as Castiel opened his mouth to introduce him.
Dean hummed and pressed a kiss to the crook of his neck. Castiel breathed out and turned all the way around, drawing Dean in by the ears for a slow, leisured kiss.
“Wait. You’re loaded?” She turned to Castiel and smirked, barely missing a beat. “I thought you said he was your
He was a little nervous about that. He’d been hoping him and his brother would have time to chat a little before Sam met Castiel that night at the party.
Castiel shook out his hands and grabbed a paper towel from the dispenser to dry them, avoiding eye contact. He hesitated before speaking again.
The voice over the phone was brusque, but Dean knew his dad well enough hear the affection hidden behind it. A lighthearted grin stretched across his face, breaking the few lines of tears that had escaped despite
“Marlene set up a schedule with those who wish to learn piano,” Castiel said, “The first three lessons went very well. All of my students seemed to very much enjoy my tutelage.”
. This was so unlike him. It was ridiculous. His stomach felt like it was in his mouth. He’d ended up back in the first thing he chose—nothing special, something he would wear any day. But that was kind of the point; regardless of how much he wanted to impress Cas (and he
Charlie nearly dropped the dish she was washing, but caught it just in time to save it from smashing to pieces in the sink full of dirties.
, naked. And pie,” Dean said defensively, moving back into the bedroom to step in close to Cas. He tugged at the man’s sleep shirt, the one Dean had given him months ago, and pouted at his boyfriend. “This morning I got none of those things.”
As Castiel changed keys to lead into the chorus, Dean recognized the song with a jolt. He sat down quickly next to Cas to catch the next lines with him.
“Castiel took me shopping,” Jack was saying animatedly, “But you already knew that. We also talked about some possible employment options. And then we came back here to bake cookies.”
“Well, ain’t that the truth,” Ted spoke up from behind Brian and Emmett. He leaned over the booth to get closer to the conversation.
“Sorry ‘bout that,” Dean apologized, pretending he hadn’t heard anything. He sat back down and reached for his own mug. “Long flight. I don’t do so well on airplanes. Cas says I worry for nothin’, cuz the chances of dying in a car crash are a lot higher, but—uh…” Realizing he was rambling, Dean trailed off, then felt compelled to finish his sentence lest he sound even more suspicious. “Anyways, I’ll take the open road to the skies any day, but Cas, he insists on flying anywhere more than a day’s drive away,” he finished.
With a strength of will that he wasn’t aware he had, Castiel reaches out and takes Dean’s hand—feels the pulse of nervous energy through the necklace as he does—and drops the amulet again into his palm. Immediately the feelings he’s siphoning from the amulet vanish and their absence leaves him momentarily disoriented.
The cabin rose into view at the crest of a small hill, surrounded by a grove of towering white pine which loomed over it. A small pond rested in the lee of the rolling slope, its waters gentle and clear as glass with how cold it had been. A few lingering vestiges of ice clung to the shoreline, refusing to dissolve until spring. Though it had been mild weather in the city, here winter decided to announce itself loudly with frequent snaps of wind splitting through the trees. It still hadn’t snowed, thankfully, which is how they were able to come here so late in the season. No way was Dean taking Baby out on the salted roads.
crossed William’s—the realization that Dean and Cas were more than just friends. Helen remained blissfully unaware, for the time being.
—the chance to find out. To figure out where we fall when things get real. And until you start, you’re never gonna know what you’ve got.”
“Right. And that’s not freaky or physic at all,” Dean muttered. He gave Castiel a weak smile. “So you’re not upset I sent that photographer away?” he asked.
He led them to a small herbalist store. They ducked through the doorway into a crowded room filled with shelves of wooden containers. Castiel walked up to the counter and pulled a piece of paper with Chinese lettering from his wallet.
“Wh-what?” Dean blurts out. He scoots back from Castiel, and the rejection would have hurt less had it not been for the kiss.
He held the mistletoe up over their heads to demonstrate, leaning forward to capture Castiel in a kiss right there in the middle of the busy store. Dean heard someone in the crowd hoot and whistle so he slid his hand behind Cas’s neck and pulled him closer to
She gave a little giggle and a couple chews on her piece of gum and then walked away to tend her other tables.
!” Harry said in a bad Tony Montana impression. He held up his gun with a dramatic flair. It was attached to him via a blocky cardboard backpack that was designed to look like some kind of technology and a cut-off extension cord. Both he and Ed wore matching tan jumpsuits.
“Hey,” Sam said, grabbing him by the arm. “No way in hell you’re driving. In fact, I think you should sit this one out.” He dug the keys out of Dean’s hand and shoved Dean back. It didn’t take much, considering how drunk he was. “I mean it, Dean. Take the night and clear your head. I’ve got this. If you feel any better, come find me.”
“Good.” John grinned widely at him and then gripped Dean by the back of the neck in a fatherly way. “So! Dean. Where’s this girl you’ve been seeing? I can’t wait to meet her.”
“My mother taught me,” Castiel said, looking up into Dean’s bright green eyes, “Baking with her is among some of my fondest memories of being a child. We would make gingerbread cookies every year at Christmas and then the whole family would decorate them. I thought Jack might enjoy the activity, and I know how much you like anything sweet.”
“So what the hell was that all about?” Emmett was asking, taking a sip of his drink. His big blue eyes looked up at Sam, wide and expecting a response.
“Dad. Dad! I know. I’m at the hospital.” Dean gulped. “There was an accident. I’m fine, but Cas was injured pretty bad.”
“Dean, all you’re doing here is standing around wasting time,” John scolded, raising his voice. He frowned harshly at his son. “I was wrong. Maybe you don’t have what it takes to run this company after all.”
“He’s been putting in a lot of extra hours the past couple weeks,” Charlie noted, “I caught him a couple of times napping in his office.”
“Yeah?” Dean said, “Cuz it’s not really my thing but Marcin said you were a romantic and then his story—”
“Cas, wait,” Dean said, reaching out for him, “Don’t end it like this, Cas, please. I still want you. Maybe not in the same way but it’s—that’s got to count for something.”
and just wasn’t saying anything. His nerves skittered under his skin at that thought, and he felt a cold sweat break out at the base of his neck. Finally his father gave up trying to read the answers from his silence and let out a heavy sigh.
“I know to what he is referring,” Cas said. He considered Ben for a long moment. “Do you have…some form of illness?” the angel asked.
“Shit,” Dean laughed. “Well hell, if you ever want a job…” he trailed off, reconsidering. “Actually, you know what? Never mind. Not sure I want someone like you with access to our servers.”
Castiel smiled secretly to himself and set the book down. He turned back to John with a light blush across the bridge of his nose, embarrassed that the man was there listening to what was usually private flirting between them.
“Marcin, kindly refrain from telling him all of my secrets,” Cas said, “At least until after the first date.”
,” Dean replied lightly. He ran a hand through Castiel’s mussed hair and laughed when the man swatted his hand away, complaining and attempting to fix it. Dean helped, but only so that he could continue running his fingers through the soft brown strands of Cas’s hair. He hummed.
Dean reached over the hood of the car to the piston he had been working on earlier. His fingers worked at the grooves, at the thin band of metal that fit snug against the worn steel. It came loose and Dean twisted it around in his fingers, looping the thin metal around itself a couple of times.
Dean’s breath froze halfway up his throat. He let out a sputtered laugh and blurted, “Shit,” then laughed again, still breathless. “Jesus, look at us—we’re friggin’ hopeless. We hadn’t even been on a proper date and we were already head-over-heels for each other.”
“I’m sure you will do just fine,” Castiel assured him. He smiled secretly to himself, like he knew something Dean didn’t.
His lips quirk up on one side for a crooked smile that belies his eagerness. Castiel can feel it, though, through the necklace. He sends his own elation right back, and it’s enough where something between them breaks loose like a branch that holds the entire river behind it—the last defensive wall holding them back from what they truly desire.
He got up and rummaged in Cas’s cupboard for the bottle, then filled up the water again and returned to the bed. He offered both the painkillers and the glass to Castiel, who took them with a grateful look.
.” Dean swallowed painfully and forged ahead, squeezing his eyes shut for a brief moment. “I thought it was a dream, and then when we woke up together I figured you had come back to the motel, but you—he—still had the ring on the next morning. And then later we went out and he said—you said—”
“Dean, would you like me to take you right here on this table?” Castiel asked. His voice was husky and heavy with arousal. Dean grunted and made a gurgling whining noise in the back of his throat that he had to admit wasn’t at all manly but in the moment he really didn’t give a shit. “I’ll take that as a yes,” Castiel said against his skin.
“It was a mumble bee,” Castiel says. Actually, he mumbles the last part. He thinks it will deliver the joke better.
There were tears in Michael’s eyes when he looked up at Ben, but he couldn’t find the words to speak.
“I love it when you beg,” he said in a sultry, low voice. Then he growled and nipped at the skin under Cas’s jawline, drawing a faint moan from the man.
“Don’t fuck with me, Zachariah,” Dean said, laying on the threats and jabbing a finger in his face, “You’ll lose.”
“That was often the diagnosis for mental illness back in the day,” Castiel explained, and suddenly it was clear as day to Dean why he would make such a great psychiatrist. “Thankfully things are different now.”
“Shit, really?” Dean swiped at his lips, smudging it even worse. “It’s not what it looks like, I swear,” he said quickly. He winced at how that came out. “That makes it sound even worse doesn’t it?”
“Love you,” Dean murmured against them. His eyes fluttered closed, and he felt rather than saw Castiel’s smile widen.
“It was…wonderful,” Castiel said softly. He still felt warm all over from the song, and the words just didn’t seem to do it justice. He placed a hand at the back of Dean’s neck, letting it linger and say everything he was feeling but couldn’t find the words for in the moment. Then he nudged Dean to slide over. “My turn,” he said.
“I’m proud of you,” Dean told him, “And I’m thrilled you’re doing this.” Castiel smiled at him adoringly in lieu of a response, and Dean felt the familiar rush of happiness that accompanied him whenever he thought of how god damn
“Sugar in any form is dangerous,” he said. He put all thoughts of the donuts aside for a moment and leaned in to give Cas a thoroughly sugary morning kiss. “Thanks, Cas, this is awesome,” Dean said with a smile. Cas grinned back at him.
Jo’s response was to capture her mouth again. Charlie abruptly stopped talking and sighed into her mouth.
Ah. That made more sense. Castiel nodded and sat up as well, looping his arms around Dean’s torso to embrace him from behind. He rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder and drew him in close.
Dean turned away and covered his face to hide his shame, leaning out over his knees as he hung his head in his hands. He drew them away a moment later, staring down at them as he dragged in a shaky breath.
“I see,” Castiel said. He gave Bobby’s hand a little squeeze and smiled warmly. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Bobby.”
“It is difficult to explain…” Castiel trailed off and stared off into the crowd of undulating bodies, eyes squinting as he tried to think of a way to explain it where Dean could understand. “Life never stands still.”
Castiel arrived in the small room just as they were sweeping and mopping up the floor. Charlie had her music playing through her phone by then. It rested on the counter as they danced around the room with their mop and broom, bobbing to the music—which was in Japanese, Charlie informed him when he asked.
“Dean, please,” Castiel pleaded, sounding mildly annoyed. He tried to press closer, to take whatever pleasure was to be found from brushing against Dean’s inner thigh, but the man was too far away. To his displeasure, Dean pulled back further and shook his head.
“What the hell is LARPing?” Dean asked. He shook his head. “No, don’t answer that. No time. I’ve got an internet problem here. Think you can show a couple of computer dimwits how to fix it?”
“I mean, you’re not gonna remember any of this right? So this is like, my only chance to come clean.” Dean scoffs lightly and smirks a little at the irony, but it drops quickly off his face. “I should’ve told you this ages ago, but I was too much of a coward. Guess I was afraid of how you would react, whether you would…approve or not.”
Castel led him into the lobby of the church, then around the sides of the pews toward the back. When they passed the altar and slipped into a room behind it, Dean started to feel a little uneasy again.
Dean hums against his skin and pulls him forward away from the door. He’s about to turn them and shove Cas to the bed when he finds himself falling back to the mattress instead. Castiel straddles him and crawls up on his knees, hands under Dean’s shirt. He pulls it up and over his head.
They headed toward the pavilion in back. Though the structure was the largest part of the park it seemed to be for the most part ignored by its inhabitants. Dean saw fliers taped to the thick concrete pillars that announced
Dean doubled over in laughter as soon as the store was out of sight, right there in the middle of the street. He held his arms around his stomach and laughed until he felt his knees hitting the pavement. Castiel was at his side, chuckling lightly. It grew in strength into all-out laughter by the time Dean was practically curled up on the ground.
Dean grabbed a cinnamon latte after his workout (what could he say, he was feeling the amorous pull of autumn that morning) from a little café around the corner to his place and decided to go for a walk in the park. It was early yet, and a group of women were doing yoga on the green. Dean allowed his eyes to slide over their collection of finely toned backsides as he sauntered past them in the midst of an expert rendition of downward dog, sipping from his coffee and breathing in the fresh chill air of fall. In another couple months the trees would be completely bare and there would be a dusting of snow on the ground to replace the fallen leaves. Tourists from all over the country would flock here to get a taste of the Big Apple during the holidays, bugging up the subways and sidewalks with their sightseeing maps and their IPhones…
Castiel nods and allows Dean to finish pulling him down to lay stretched and spooned together on the couch.
He showed Jack where the bathroom was and then where he would be staying, as promised. He handed the boy a set of towels from the linen closet and showed him how the shower worked. Jack thanked him again and Castiel left him to it, wandering back to the kitchen to speak with Dean. He sighed, placing a hand to his forehead and wondering what the hell he’d gotten himself into. He looked up and dropped the hand as he entered the kitchen.
“We won’t know for sure until we get to the hospital, but I’ve seen a lot worse. He should be okay now that he’s breathing on his own.”
Dean ignored the look in the angel’s eyes and closed the bathroom door. He stood under the spray of the shower for a long time, letting the water wash away everything that had happened in the two blissful days he had spent with Castiel.
“Ran out of beer,” Samuel said, exiting toward the garage. Dean heard the door creak open and the familiar
“Nevertheless,” he said. There was a lilting edge to his voice, and it was unclear if he was saying it to Dean, or to himself.
Cas and Dean decorate their place for the holidays and Cas discovers that teaching is harder than it looks.
Castiel’s breath sputtered out in a rain of tears. He nodded vigorously, squeezing his eyes shut tightly against the rising relief. How was it that Dean could always make him feel this way? Like there was nothing wrong with him? Like nothing in him was broken and needed to be fixed? That it was
They kissed slow, lazy, taking each other in and learning the rhythm of the spaces between their breaths. Tongues reaching, searching, exploring—delving inward, licking, and flicking. Hands groping, grasping, tugging at cloth. Their bodies shifted in silent conversation, pressing against one another and pulling closer.
“Cas, if it’s weird then don’t keep the shirt, and I don’t have to call you anything,” Dean said in a rush.
“Aww, you mean you cheated!” Dean griped, “I thought we were goin’ for a ‘technology free’ weekend?”
“Dean?” Castiel said. Dean swallowed the organ back down with difficulty and grimaced. “Dean, what happened? Who was that woman?”
Jo seemed a little taken aback by that response, but that was when Dean and Cas showed up for their drinks, so the moment passed. Jo handed out the glasses, explaining what it was called and what was in it as the two tried it. Charlie sipped her drink quietly, watching.
“Hey, nobody likes hotel living,” Dean countered. “It’s the one thing my dad and I agree on. Too many nights spent in crappy motel rooms as a kid.” He paused, explaining, “We weren’t always rich.”
Cas stepped up to him and placed two fingers at his forehead, putting Dean to sleep. He then disappeared in the blink of an eye.
With one last fake sob (and a wink), Carmen made a disgusted noise and turned away, shoving off through the crowd. Dean stood frozen, watching her go. She stopped briefly at the entrance to the ballroom and looked back once, then tossed her head like a pro and exited.
This time Dean took control, surging up and gripping Castiel by the sides of his head, forcing his tongue past his lips for a rough kiss. He pulled away, mouth open and panting, tongue hanging loose and dripping with their shared saliva.
When the meeting ended, Castiel led him over to the kitchen manager—a large, surly older woman who assigned him as a line runner.
Castiel’s eyes went dark and narrow. That was it. Dean was done for. He flicked the noodle at Dean’s face to see how
, and the delicate white flakes settled down on the thick woolen blanket keeping them warm as the carriage continued on through the park. The horse snorted a couple times, stopped once for a pit stop—or a
“You’re the fish whisperer,” Dean reminded him, “That counts. And you’re the coffee bringer. And a fire dancer.” At the confused look Cas shot him at that last one, Dean grinned wolfishly at him and explained. “Last night, in front of the fire,” he said. He leaned into Cas’s chair, breathed the next words against the skin just under his ear. “The way you writhed under me as I fucked you…”
He framed Castiel’s jaw carefully in his hands and placed a slow kiss on his lips. When he pulled away he smiled and searched deep blue eyes for a spark of light. It was dim, but it was there.
It didn’t do much more than get the thing’s attention. With paranormal speed, the thing’s head whirled to face him, dropping its victim who slid down to the ground crumpled against the wall. It started for Dean, a hungry look in its eyes.
Dean got up and started pacing back and forth while he did, wondering what the hell was going to walk through his front door.
“Do it,” Dean spat at him. His voice shook in a maelstrom of emotions, with anger topping the list. He’d expected this reaction from his father, but that didn’t mean it hurt any less. “Go on,” he egged, “Hit your faggot son. Mom would be
He looked up at Dean from under his eyelashes, his eyes bashful and immensely fond. The words they had said to one another liberally the last couple days weren’t necessary in that moment, but he said them anyway.
“No. Well, that too.” Dean smiled, feeling a little breathless. “No, I meant…dating and stuff. I’m worried I’m going to fuck it up.”
They were strange words, out of the blue. Castiel glanced up at Dean and seemed to know this. He continued.
“I should get going anyway,” the older Winchester declared, rising to his feet and downing the rest of his drink. “Need to get to the office early in the morning, take care of a few things.”
Dean stared at him for a moment. It always surprised him whenever Castiel sounded so…well, religious.
Dean grinned at the happy couple and decided he needed a drink. He took Cas by the elbow and led him over to the bar to help. They came back a few minutes later carrying shots.
The inspection went about as well as Dean expected. After two hours of pretending to give a shit about city regulations, the lady finally left, but not without a hefty fine just because he hadn’t hung up the appropriate signage in the break room—one of which was about appropriate conduct in the workplace and…yeah, Dean had broken about ten of those rules on his first day alone. Opps.
She nodded over to their host and Charlie followed her line of sight over to where Dean was standing amongst a group of friends and family, talking animatedly with one hand. His other arm was slung around Castiel’s waist, and the other man was leaning against him as though they were
“Right. That’s right,” Sam said quickly, looking up. He immediately went back to staring at his food.
Dean cleared his throat again, slightly uncomfortable by her forwardness but flattered all the same. “I could order you another steak,” he offered.
“You’ll do fine,” John said sincerely, “And no matter what they say… just know that I’m damn proud of you—the both of you.” The amendment at the end was added as a quick afterthought, his father stumbling over the words in a rare display of emotion.
Growing up the son of a wealthy businessman, Dean wasn’t used to picking and choosing. He got what he wanted when he wanted. He grabbed a couple cookies from the tray—
“Yeah, well…” Dean felt a blush rise across his face and was grateful it was too dark for Cas to see. “Thanks for not giving up on me.”
You can expect updates from me every 2 weeks or so from here on out... Sometimes longer, if it’s needed. I’m getting into the complicated, sticky bits near to the climax so things might take longer to eke out, but I've got a clear sense of where things are going. In the beginning I can just write like The Flash, make up a bunch of shit willy nilly, throw in a lot of filler and fluff, but the end I gotta like…bring all that shit I threw together in the pot and serve it up and hope it doesn’t leave a bad flavor in the mouth. I may also be starting an original work of fiction (partly inspired by this story) in the next few months as well, which could slow things down BUT I will keep posts no more than a month apart. That much I can promise. :)
“Need anything else?” Justin asked him. He gestured to Dean’s plate, but only half seemed to be talking about the food.
It's Castiel's first time meeting Dean's entire extended family, and not everyone is as accepting as they had hoped.
The guilt hits Castiel like a slap to the face following this admonishment and he ducks his head in shame.
“Look, we need a spare to win this,” Dean says encouragingly in Castiel’s ear, patting him on the shoulder, “Remember what I showed you.”
Dean grabbed him by the sleeve of his coat and dragged him in a tight circle back around to the opposite direction so that he wouldn’t crash into the other skaters. Unfortunately this put both him and Cas off balance and they went tumbling down to the ice again. This time Dean got a nice whack in the head from Castiel’s cast on the way down. He winced and rubbed his forehead.
“That was the day we met,” Castiel finished for him. He nodded as it suddenly dawned on him. “She was the owner of the lipstick.”
(thank you, Charlie) angled toward the TV in a wedge and separated by a small end table in the middle. There’s a pair of tables on each far end of the couches as well. It’s a very nice upgrade, Castiel thinks.
,”—Here his voice hushed down to a whisper. He grabbed Dean by the edge of his costume and pulled him down to speak to him—“Since when do you bring a
“I much prefer this form of dancing,” Cas said with a gleam in his eyes as he lowered himself on top of Dean.
The grin on his face was barely noticeable, but it was there. Dean beamed at him and watched as he turned to leave. He lingered in the doorway as Cas walked back to the elevators, head titled in admiration of that fine ass in those pressed black pants.
But… no one had ever given her the benefit of the doubt like that since her mother left, and… well, she didn’t want to be the one to pop whatever over-the-rainbow, fairy-tale bubble this kid lived in.
Dean takes a shuddering breath and seriously considers witchcraft is involved here. Because it’s the only thing that explains this complete and abrupt 180 in his sexuality.
He walks to the head of the lane and holds up the ball, taking a deep breath to try and calm down. He ends up lobbing the thing unceremoniously into the gutter and groans in frustration.
“Maybe we can leave the speculating to the police,” Ben cut in, effectively putting a stop to the morbid conversation.
“Then…you also have strong character,” he said, “And Dean. For…giving me a chance— for seeing through my anger and not judging me for it. And for helping me through a difficult time. Thank you, Castiel. I wish I could do something for you both in return. Christmas is next week and I can’t even buy a pack of gum.”
Dean was suddenly there at her side wearing that goofy, overly-excited smile of his that made him look a little like a Tele-tubby. Not that Charlie would ever tell him that.
Dean slid his hand down the front of his pants, feeling him through the thin fabric. He felt rather than heard Cas’s breath hitch as his palm folded around him. He squeezed firmly, rubbing slowly with his thumb as he pressed their lips together and rolled his tongue around the inside of Cas’s warm, wet mouth.
“No offense, but…you’re wrong, man. Look, Cas—I won’t lie to you. I don’t know you well enough to get what my brother sees in you,” Sam said, “But the Dean at the table here tonight? Man, I barely even
Anna was standing next to the bellboy, ear tilted to something Cas was telling her but she only half seemed to be listening. Dean headed toward them and waved as Anna’s eyes glanced up. She grinned when she saw him. From this angle, Dean could see the slight downturn to Cas’s lips when he realized his friend wasn’t listening to him any longer. The bellboy turned to see what had drawn her attention and Dean watched as his eyes narrowed.
“Right. Cas, this is my dad’s business partner and a friend of the family, Bobby Singer,” Dean introduced.
“Yeah, okay. Good,” the hunter says, jolting back to himself, “Where the hell is Sammy with that coffee, anyway?” He shoots to his feet and storms out of the library shouting, “Sammy!”
“People might start asking questions if you stay here with us for too long,” Dean finished, “We like havin’ you here, sure, but to be honest we kinda need our own space too. Nothing personal, kid.”
“Sounds like you did alright,” Dean said, fidgeting with the bread in his hands, “Better than most in your shoes.”
This meeting and the last few before it were all part of a trial run to see if Dean had what it took to be a respectable son and take over the family business, but so far it hadn’t been going very well. Maybe because his heart just wasn’t in it.
“I can’t wait to hear all about it,” John was saying, “Tomorrow, though. For now, I’m calling it a night.” He rose from the couch with one last pat to Dean’s shoulder and shuffled off to his room.
When Dean finally wrapped a firm hand around the base of Castiel’s cock and began slowly stroking him up and down, the man was so sensitized to his touch that he shouted into Dean’s mouth and tensed with pleasure. It didn’t take long to prepare him, and Dean had to pause for a minute to catch up. Thankfully with how turned on
Less than five minutes later they broke through the small grove of trees into a wide field. The silhouette of an old, rundown barn could be seen in the distance, just a skeleton of rotting two-by-fours and broken windows. Dean led them to the middle of the field, then stopped.
Someone pulled Dean back, the paramedics moving in. One placed a mask and a breathing pump over Castiel’s face while the other readied a stretcher. They pulled him onto it with one precise movement and began wheeling him toward the ambulance.
On her second trip back with an empty tray everyone was all of a sudden shouting. Charlie looked back and saw the ball starting to drop on-screen Dean’s bigass television. She glanced back to Jo and joined in the fray.
He thought Cas was going to argue with him further but all he did was take three deep breaths and then rasp, “It’s in my phone.” He grimaced and swallowed with some difficulty. “I…don’t know where it ended up.”
“Naw, I brought a bag,” he said, “I collect ‘em from places I pass through. Never really had a use for them until now. Hell of a lot easier to start a fire with the whole book than it is one lousy matchstick.”
“That is what I thought,” he said, clenching his teeth. “You must think I am the biggest fool for thinking—” He broke off and shook his head violently, eyes flashing in anger. “Did you honestly think I wouldn’t find out?”
. Dean stood ramrod straight looking like he’d just been electrocuted and wearing that terrified parent face that Charlie had only ever seen on her ex Dorothy’s face when Charlie decided to teach her dog how to skateboard.
“Idiot,” Dean says, but the insult is said with warm, honeyed affection. He twists to where he’s seated facing front and pulls the angel into his side, looping an arm around his back. Castiel’s nose buries itself in his neck and as he hums against Dean’s skin, Dean can feel the smile on his face.
“Dean…” Cas said, peering at him curiously, “If you referring to your past relations, that doesn’t bother me. I may have been jealous of Carmen, but I can’t exactly fault you for anything that happened before we met.”
Whatever Dean had been expecting, it certainly wasn’t the rows of wonky ice cream flavors that awaited him—which ironically were categorized under ‘Regular Flavors’, as opposed to the much shorter ‘Exotic Flavors’ list which sported a number of traditional
Cas took the ring between delicate fingers and slipped it over his knuckle. This time the look in his eyes was reverent—the same look he got when he was praying.
“Cas, I love you too,” Dean tells him, without pretense. Because really, they’ve wasted so much time already.
“What the hell was that!?” he demanded, stepping in close so that Cas could hear him over the wind. “Look, if you’re pissed at me for last time, it wasn’t my fault. Sam practically beat me awake.”
What Dean didn’t expect, however, was the tidal wave of passion that Castiel seemed unable to hold back any longer. Now that his hands were free, they wandered up and down Dean’s back, squeezing the muscles in a gentle, soothing massage. With his lips, Castiel pressed a trail of kisses from the base of Dean’s neck to his ear, and upon reaching this destination, took the soft lobe into his mouth and sucked on it gently. Just when Dean thought he might die from pure ecstasy, Castiel pulled back.
Cas chuckled. “Yes, I do,” he replied. His eyes flickered briefly to Dean, then back to the older man. “Marcin, this is Dean,” Castiel introduced.
Which was ridiculous enough for Dean to forget all about the subject manner when he finally stopped laughing.
couldn’t do it. Dean was just going to have to suck it up and hope nobody abused her on the tow over.
“Yes, I understand,” Castiel replied. He fiddled with his cup, then downed it and moved over to the punch bowl to fill it up again. His blue eyes flickered up to meet Dean’s. “Your brother and Bobby know already. It is more than I expected,” he said.
Dean looked around the street, at the throng of men and women pressed up against lovers, friends, and family. He smiled.
“That’s not it,” Dean rushed to say, “No one’s kicking anyone out. I was just feeling a little…left out, that’s all. I uh…you guys obviously get along well…”
“I think you have had enough sugar for one day,” Castiel said, plucking the bag from his fingers and setting it down on the nightstand. “Besides, I have something to show you.” He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder and looked at him expectantly. “It is far away and driving would be inefficient. May I?”
“Your apartment is…impressive,” Castiel said, looking around. Dean placed Cas’s plate on the coffee table and set his beside it.
John Winchester stood awkwardly in the entryway next to the breakfast bar. Castiel’s blue eyes widened considerably, and suddenly the fact that he was wearing Dean’s pajamas felt more than a little incriminating.
“There you go,” Dean said with a grin. His fingers played with the collar to Castiel’s shirt, the backs of his knuckles brushing against the skin of his neck. “Now you’re ready.”
Cas cried out and shook under him, and Dean moved his hips rhythmically, rolling in and jerking forward at the end of each thrust. It was a move he typically saved for the ladies, but what it was doing to Cas was clearly working.
Or maybe that wasn’t the best idea, considering Sam would be sitting right next to him in the car and Dean couldn’t exactly control the incriminating sounds he made in his sleep. He was lucky enough as it was that they hadn’t been doing anything serious when Sam woke him up.
The necklace is special to him though. It connects him to Dean in a way that makes him feel close to the hunter—in a way he hasn’t since before Mary’s death—since before Purgatory and the Leviathans. Castiel wonders if his love for Dean Winchester will ever be free of the years of lies and betrayal that sticks to it and suffocates it like The Empty.
“No, it’s fine,” Cas replied. He peered at Dean a little strangely, head slightly tilted to the side, blue eyes squinting like he was trying to figure him out. There was a hint of a smile at the corner of his lips. “There happens to be no one special at the moment.”
way was so potent. “I just…guess I’m not used to it. Guess I wasn’t expecting…I don’t know.” He shook his head and dropped Castiel’s hand, opting instead to fiddle with his glass of whiskey.
The ride back to his loft was silent, with Castiel looking distractedly out the window with a duffel bag of his things set on his lap. He had changed into a dry pair of clothes (his closet had been perhaps the only thing spared from the incident) but his hair was still dripping wet. Everything in the apartment was fried—the coffee maker, the toaster oven, the fridge—even the small stereo they had danced to just that morning. It was a very lucky thing Castiel hadn’t been fried along with it all.
“Clearly, it isn’t,” Castiel argued, and Dean could practically hear the frown in his voice. When the silence stretched between them again, he added, “Dean, I cannot help if you don’t talk to me.”
Cas’s hand slipped into his and Dean led him up the hill. He held his breath as he swung open the front door, unsure of what he would find.
to say something but doesn’t know how. Castiel is afraid of what those words will be, and cuts him off.
Sam and Eileen finally get back with the pizza and join them. The pizza boxes get thrown on the larger table behind them, and they settle plates in laps while they eat and try to decide on a movie.
hurt, like The Empty is happily sucking up his misery with a straw—and for one fleeting moment, Castiel wonders if this is all just an elaborate scheme that The Empty has cooked up—some new torture to get back at him for defying it—and whether he’s really back or if he’s still trapped in that black void.
“I mean it, Bri,” Michael said, his voice dropping. He let go of Brian’s jacket. “At least tell me what the hell happened so I can stop worrying about it?”
“I convinced Cas to come dancing with me tonight,” Anna explained. “That’s where we’ll be. Around ten.”
Dean’s brain stuttered to a halt.  Cas’s voice was deep and smooth like a fine-aged whiskey, but filled with such power and light. It reverberated out over the small church and spoke of things ancient and lost to time. If angels could walk among them…Dean might actually believe that Castiel was one of them.
Brian wasn’t sure what had just happened, but he had just witnessed perhaps the sixteenth strange thing that night and this time he was getting some fucking
“Says who, Yoda?” Dean snorted, but he caught Cas’s meaning. His heart sped up at what the angel was suggesting, and the wind whipped up around them with renewed strength.
. And he got around. His tabloid fame was just as decorated as Dean’s own, only not nearly as straight. Suddenly Castiel’s guarded behavior toward him made a hell of a lot more sense.
It hit right in the middle of his face, one end stuck to his eyelid—which had closed just in time—the noodle stretching diagonally across his nose and dangling down to the corner of his mouth. Castiel very carefully reached up and picked it off.
“Dean,” Castiel said, stopping him. Dean looked up at him timidly. “How long have you been wanting to ask me that?”
“Well, you’d obviously be great at it,” Dean muttered. He was back to staring down at his lap again, fidgeting with his shirt and generally feeling shitty.
Dean laughed. He couldn’t tell if Cas was joking or just making an observation. “Yeah, well, I figured it was time to switch things up.” He reached for Cas’s hand. “Come on, I’ll give you the grand tour. I’m itching to see it for myself.”
“Because they’re all fucking clueless,” Claire interrupted venomously. “Like they know what I’m going through.”
Sam glanced at Dean, who was still working on his mouthful of lemon bar and thus banned from answering. A calculating look crossed his face as he considered Deb, who was standing with her fists on her hips waiting for an answer.
and Dean, gullible as ever had driven two full days worrying like hell to find it was all just a ruse to get him here. As soon as he stepped through Bobby’s front door, Sam grabbed him by the arms and forced him into the living room, holding him down while Bobby tied him to a chair that was set inside a devil’s trap.
“It has to be,” Castiel replied, gesturing to the obvious. He leaned up against the kitchen counter and took a sip of his beer. Dean followed the action with his eyes, holding his breath. The place was so small, there was barely three feet between them, and maybe two and a half over to the bed. Dean very carefully kept his eyes from flickering over to it, but he could see it clearly out of his peripheral.
“You’ve done good, son,” John said, clapping a large hand on his shoulder. “Seems you’ve got what it takes to run this company after all.” The full-out grin on the old man’s face grew wider. “What’s say we celebrate? Go somewhere special for dinner?”
“Yes, that would be best,” Castiel agreed. He smiled, loving how Dean knew exactly what he had been about to say without having to say it. He snuggled closer into Dean’s side and pressed a kiss at his sternum. “I would very much like to have you on a beach, though,” he said in a low rumble.
He turned back to Cas and covered his mouth with a heavy, post-orgasm kiss. When he pulled away he looked down between them.
It was just as well. He had much more important things on his mind at the moment. He needed to focus.
much at all,” the man replied. His voice was lower in the morning, Dean had noticed, and it sent small roiling waves of pleasure through his lower abdomen and down to his toes to hear it grate over his Adam’s apple like that. “You seem to exist in a perpetual state of scheming. Or at best, if you
“I would like something to read on the plane,” he said. Read the book, or read Dean’s comments in it? It was only a small difference.
Dean grinned and nodded in agreement. Then he took Cas’s hand in his and nudged him with his shoulder.
It was when he was setting the box of memories on a shelf on his side of their shared walk-in closet that Dean came up behind him, quiet and curious as a mouse.
“Woah, hey, hang on a minute there, MacGyver,” Dean said, interrupting the kid and holding up his hand, “First of all, you’re staying here until you figure things out, and second, shut the hell up and eat before the food gets cold because these burgers deserve some friggin’
“We will only be a minute,” Cas told him, and then he and Jack left Dean waiting impatiently by the Christmas tree.
By the time Dean realized he maybe should have ordered them lunch, Cas’s text came through saying he was on his way.
—from one Cas to the other. His—the one kneeling on the ground next to him, the ring around his finger—and the Cas who stood behind him with sad, fearful eyes.
and Dean would possibly get a hard slap upside the head for his insolence, but he had his reasons and honestly Zach was a dick—had always been a dick—and Dean really didn’t give a shit about making nice with the man. He didn’t care what his fucking net worth was.
“I didn’t lie,” Dean said in a short, clipped tone, “I just didn’t tell you. I would have, when the time was right.”
He felt it when Cas came, and the sensation of his tremors closing around Dean’s dick sent him off the edge as well. He gasped and jerked forward, riding Cas until the last wave of pleasure rolled languidly over him, and then he collapsed alongside him on the bed, breathing heavily.
“Well come on then, a girl needs a chaperone in a place like this. Plus, I never pay. It’s bad for my skin.” Emmett led him away with his hand raised over his head and his booty doing a little shake as he shuffled over to the bar.
—hi. Are you Mr. Gray?” Dean asked. He licked his lips, which had suddenly gone dry. “William Gray?” There was no way this wasn’t the case, but it was still polite to ask.
Dean hid a face behind his drink. His father was blissfully unaware that Zach had an unnatural fixation with both of his sons. Dean could suffer his advances, such as they were, but he
“No way! I knew it!” Alex exclaimed, leaning closer to him with widening eyes. “Show me something,” she demanded excitedly.
“Good,” Castiel replied. The hand on his ass slid off as he turned around to face Dean. “Someone keeps giving me drinks.”
“What exactly did you think you would accomplish here today?” it asks, “You’ll never escape from me, not while I hold you here.” The thing still doesn’t seem to have figured out exactly what they are doing, so maybe Jacob can use that to his advantage.
in Dean’s. Not Fairy. Not Cowboy, Not fag nor any other derogatory nicknames you care to come up with. You don’t have to like mine and Dean’s relationship but you
Claire waved her phone around in front of Castiel’s face, where the music video she forced him to watch was still paused at the end.
“I meant emotionally,” he clarifies, “For every day we are apart, I will send my love to you through that pendant so that you do not feel so alone.”
The bright bronze of Dean’s amulet gleams back at him much like the hunter’s own smile. It does not fail to occur to Castiel that everything in this box is linked to Dean somehow—that Dean is the most precious thing to him—and he doesn’t think that will ever change. Castiel lifts the necklace out of the box by the string and twirls it once, twice, three times around the width of his hand so that the pendant hangs in the middle of his palm. Castiel brings it to his lips and closes his eyes.
It blew Dean’s mind, he just couldn’t believe it. They were all homeless—most of them probably didn’t know where their next meal was coming from and some of them could die as soon as tomorrow judging by their haggard appearance, but they all seemed at peace with it.
He pulled out his phone to make a list of other things he would need to get, and was immediately distracted by the text Dean had just sent him.
“Cas, hey,” Dean said. He took Cas by the arm, rubbing up and down the yellow fuzz of his sleeve. “You’ve got a great family here. Paul and Anna. Marcin—” Dean gestured around the room. “Something Bobby always told me. ‘Family doesn’t end with blood.’ These people love you, Cas.
Short minutes later Dean was burying his face in Castiel’s hair, hand gripping the soft strands as he groaned and came undone in his grasp. Castiel followed seconds later, forced over the edge by Dean’s enthusiastic response and the frantic tug of his hair as Dean pulled his head back and mapped open-mouthed kisses down his neck.
said. Dean’s mouth dropped open a little in surprise. His voice was low and gravelly, and far too damn sexy for a man of his profession.
“I cannot, I have work later,” Castiel said. The following hesitation was brief, a controlled inhale against his rising arousal. “But I am free tomorrow night.”
“It’s called ‘special effects,’” Dean told him, snapping out of it. “But a lot of the actors in this do their own stunts, which if you ask me is fucking
The days following Mary’s death are hard for Castiel—harder than perhaps all his former millennia combined. Dean’s anger boils away under the surface, always one biting word away from the edge. The hunter can barely stand to look at him, and Castiel knows that if he were to try and give the amulet to Dean now, he would most likely throw it away again. So, he thinks, if Dean does not want the necklace, then Castiel will care for it.
They were eating in the dining room for once, since the breakfast bar only sat two. Dean set one plate down in front of Jack and the other in front of Cas, and then went back for his. He was just settling into his seat when he noticed Castiel holding his hand out to Jack. Jack took it curiously, not seeming to know what the gesture was for and yet accepting it anyway.
“What would you like, Sam?” Castiel asked abruptly, changing the subject, “And Jess? I’m afraid I don’t know what she likes either. Besides lobster.”
They ate mostly in silence, enjoying the sounds of crickets in the bushes and the occasional croak of a bullfrog. The butter turned out to be swirled with cinnamon sugar, and Dean whooped in excitement, eating three rolls before realizing he perhaps ought to enjoy his
“You should widen your search to include twin-souls, or soul connection, or any mention of multiverses and doppelgangers,” Jacob says. Dean looks at him blankly so he hunches forward and gives him
His face tightened suddenly and he looked down to his plate. Dean grew quiet, not quite knowing what to say. Castiel very rarely talked about his family. Every time he did Dean had to keep reminding himself that they weren’t bad people and that up until what happened with Balthazar, they had been a happy family—that they still loved Castiel, despite him leaving and running away without a word to the city.
“Good,” Dean said, “And for the record, not playing hard to get, not even saying I’m not interested. I’m just not on the menu.”
to ease the sexual frustration he’d been feeling since that afternoon. It was his kind of a place, and Dean slipped through the door with an easy smile feeling right at home.
At Castiel’s nod, Dean lowered himself carefully onto him, pushing his head up into the space between his legs. This time Castiel lay frozen, holding his breath as he waited for Dean to be ready. Dean groaned at the stretching feeling, sinking inch by burning inch until Castiel was balls deep in him.
“What…” Dean croaks, still touching the vial around his neck. “What are you feeling right now?” He licks his lips, nervous of the answer.
“Shit, sorry,” Dean said quickly, looking down. “That was a dumb thing to say. It’s not like I’m—I mean we haven’t even—” He broke off, feeling restless and let a breath out through his nose.
Dean was jerked back to reality as the car finally came to a halt in front of the airport. His eyes found the clock on the dashboard and he swore, hurling himself from the car. His briefcase caught on the door, hitting him painfully in the back of the leg and half on his ass, but he was in too much of a hurry to do more than wince as he bolted for the sliding glass doors that marked the terminal’s entrance.
“What about you? Are you sticking around? Don’t you have angel stuff to do with the impending apocalypse?”
Breakfast ended without further eavesdropping or conspiring. Dean and Sam got up from their booth and walked over. Dean had his hands casually stuffed in his pockets and seemed a hell of a lot more relaxed than his brother, who stood ramrod straight behind him.
” the noise blared out from her phone, startling the couple on two fronts as she popped up from behind the breakfast bar. “Pretty sure that isn’t sanitary!!” she yelled, laughing loudly at the looks on their faces as they broke apart from their kiss.
“He’s great,” Dean assured Cas’s mom for the—how many times had it been? Five? Six? “He, um… like I said, he’s working as a music teacher, and then on Sundays he sings for a local church. His voice—god, it’s like nothing I’ve ever heard before. It’s awesome.” Dean grinned just thinking about it. “He’s pretty well-known for it, actually, at least locally. And he volunteers at a soup kitchen. And, uh… yeah, so do I,” Dean confessed.
“Hell yeah, spank me harder,” Dean flirted. He pressed eagerly back against the front of Cas’s loose sweatpants, encouraging him to do just that.
“Please tell me I’m not dreaming again,” he said breathlessly, “Because if I am I—I seriously don’t think I could handle it.”
The far end of the bookshelf was filled with a series of thick, leather journals in varying shades of brown. There were five of them in total. Below this, on the desk itself, was another of the same size and girth. Dean picked it up, carefully untied the strap keeping it bound together, and flipped open the cover.
“I have been searching for Castiel,” Jack says, his voice turning grave, “But I haven’t been able to find him. I did, however, find Jacob here. I heard a
John would be back from California the following afternoon. Dean wanted to have his ducks in a row before he arrived.
“It is not an easy career to succeed at,” Castiel insisted, “For one, there is an excessive amount of travelling involved. It is an expensive lifestyle. The pay is terrible, and if you hit one wrong note—just one—they will never let it go.” Castiel shook his head. “No, I am better off going to school for psychotherapy.”
“Okay, that’s enough.” Dean stepped in, pushing the man back. “Go find somewhere else to stick it, huh?”
Castiel’s eyebrows raised, as though it were an odd thing to say about volunteer work and he seemed impressed. He said nothing, though, and merely unlocked the door. They went in, and Castiel made a beeline for the closet. Dean took a seat at the small kitchen table opposite the bed.
“What would you have me say?” Castiel growls at him, his eyes narrow and piercing. He turns away with a deep frown and tugs his coat off vehemently, tossing it into a chair.
Brian stood off to his side, frozen in shock. Dean moved directly in front of him to block him from the demon’s sight. The last thing Dean wanted was another fatality tonight.
The horse walked at a leisurely pace, winding through the park. With the freshly fallen snow, it was like something out of a Christmas carol, a true winter wonderland.
It was a thinly veiled exit line, but then again, it was a club. Expectations here were low. The girl Carmen would forget all about him by the time morning rolled around. She was probably too drunk to remember him now.
Castiel was silent as they walked side by side down the street. They were headed back to Cas’s apartment, presumably for a change of clothes.
Something about that made Dean bristle in anger. He couldn’t believe two people so involved in charity work could let their son go hungry. It just didn’t seem right, and he said so.
He had just finished telling Missouri about Claire and dinner the previous night when their plane landed at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International  Airport. Dean felt like his whole body was buzzing, having spent the last three hours reliving every detail of his time with Castiel. It wasn’t anxiety thrumming under his skin by this point, but excitement. He
The woman nodded, bade them a Merry Christmas and walked away. Dean held up his hand and flashed her a fake smile as she left, watching as she approached a different couple, this time one that accepted her request. He could feel Castiel’s confused, curious gaze burning a hole in the side of his head, and turned, as expected, to find Cas peering at him with intense focus.
A subtle grin fought through Dean’s nerves as he considered the woman who had raised Cas. She was petite, coming only to the middle of Dean’s chest, with a figure that was slight, yet graceful. Her cheeks were rosy and full, and when she smiled at him they dimpled on one side.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel whispered. It was a true whisper this time, perhaps the first time Dean had heard his voice completely without his signature gravel.
Dean shot Cas an apologetic look and let his father steer him back toward the group of businessmen, some of which Dean recognized from the LA branch and others he had met here in the city.
“No, thank you,” Castiel answered her as he patted his arm dry. He rolled his sleeve down carefully and turned his hand over, studying it. “It feels very strange,” he commented.
Who was he kidding? He was already one hundred percent face-first on the pavement in love. But Cas didn’t need to know that just now. It was still far too soon.
He reached for his own cock, precum bubbling from the head, aching to be touched. The first stroke was like a godsend, and by the third he was ready.
When Cas set his bottle down and took the popcorn from him to lean in for a kiss, Dean had to admit that the real world had just as much to offer as his dreams. He carded his hand through Cas’s hair and kissed him slow but eager.
“You’re getting good at that,” Castiel noted, sighing back against them. He reached out and gestured with his hands for the coffee, despite the right being for the most part useless. Dean chuckled and poured him a cup, adding the right amount of milk and honey (yes, Cas preferred
Cas half turned back to him, tilting his head and looking at Dean with the slightest narrowing of his eyes.
Alex got up and Castiel slid to the end of bench as Dean took his seat at the piano. He was more than a little curious to see what Dean would play. He hadn’t even been aware that Dean
That caused a flare of anger in Castiel. Next to him he felt Dean go rigid and Castiel felt a surge of protective energy rush through him.
of porcelain against the table and Castiel raises his head to find Dean pushing a steaming cup of java toward him. He grabs it like a man lost at sea would grab hold of a life raft and he more sinks into the coffee than pours it down his throat.
“We met at a club,” Dean said shortly, “Really not that interesting.” He glared at Carmen, as much as he could manage with his father standing right there watching them. “
Dean blurted out a quick apology and then hit the play button. He pretended not to notice the ghost of a smirk on Charlie’s face or the way Jo had blushed when she had scooted closer. He looped his own arm around Cas and pulled him in for a quick kiss, spicy with the taste of rum and nutmeg on his tongue, and settled closer next to him with his own drink.
The sound of her typing continued for another minute and then Charlie said, “Oh look, Mrs. Melnitz is flying back to her single condo where she is…retired and volunteers at a cat shelter, and… judging from her Facebook account, she was in the city visiting her granddaughter’s family. Perfect. Just let me…”
“Is that so?” Zach responded politely. His voice and eyes were angry though. He checked his watch and shifted the briefcase around in his hands.
“Yeah, but that was…what? Four years ago? So anything from the last few years isn’t in your memory banks,” Dean says. He knocks playfully on Castiel’s head. “
, he wanted something warm to cover his ass. He huddled closer to the gas fireplace as he drank his coffee and listened to Cas explain.
“Dean, I get my cast off in three weeks,” Castiel said, “I would very much prefer not breaking my other arm until then.”
“Good, we’ve got time.” Dean grinned at him from over his shoulder. “Too bad you don’t have something here. My shower is
“You’re really getting the humor today, Cas. You must be in a good mood or something,” Dean replied, turning his head slightly so that he could look at the angel sidelong. Castiel nodded atop his shoulder.
“I’m fine,” Dean grumbled, slumping back into his seat. He swallowed hard, turning away. He figured he’d made enough of a fool of himself for one day. A second later he turned back to the woman. “It’s just… they don’t know about me. They don’t know I’m coming. I’ve never done this before and…
Helen quickly finished drying her hands and then draped the dish towel over her left shoulder, a habit that Dean had seen Cas do on numerous occasions when they were cooking together. The smile on his face quirked upward.
than all the other times Dean had driven her. She practically purred contentment under the hood as he coasted her down the hills and accelerated into the curves.
Castiel is still not sure if Sam knows, if Dean has told him about Castiel’s confession. He doesn’t think so. He thinks Sam would have come and talked to him about it by now if he knew. The younger Winchester would want to make sure Castiel was ok. Since he hasn’t done this, Castiel has to conclude that Dean hasn’t told him. He’s grateful for this. He doesn’t think Sam looking at him with pity and trying to get him to sign up for online dating apps would necessarily help him feel better.
“Awesome. Shit’s going down pretty soon, I think,” Dean said. He looked back to Cas with a soft smile on his face. “Is your phone handy? I wanna video this shit.”
“Well…yes. I do know what you mean. But I wanted to hear you say it.” Jack looks straight at him and leans in a little. “You can’t get what you don’t ask for,” he says.
Castiel flopped over so that he was facing Dean and pillowed his head under his hand. He squint-glared at Dean. “Then get up and make a fire,” he said.
“I suppose that would be alright,” Castiel said after he’d swallowed, “It is not too boring?” he fretted.
Dean thought maybe he could get behind the whole God concept with his own personal angel leading the way.
“No. Don’t,” Sam said quickly, “Don’t let him use you for donuts, Cas, that’s basically prostitution to him.”
Then Dean placed a hand on Sam’s arm and asked him something serious. Surprise flitted across the younger Winchester’s face, only to be replaced by a goofy smile a moment later. He pulled Dean into another tight embrace and said something that looked an awful lot like,
Castiel made a slight whimpering noise as the hard nub of his bare nipple grated against the soft fabric of Dean’s worn black tee. He squirmed around Dean’s waist and then there was the echoing
After a number of songs and an indeterminate number of drinks later, Dean was just starting to feel at ease. His skin glowed and his smile was loose, and for the first time that night he didn’t feel like the entire room of people was about to eat him alive.
Which is how it came to be that Saturday morning Jack joined them in the kitchen where Cas and Dean were cozied up at the breakfast bar sipping their morning jo’ and asked, “Dean, will you make me waffles for breakfast?”
“Look, I’m sorry you got mixed up in all of this,” Dean said, holding out his hand, “Believe me, if I could set things straight…” He trailed off and chuckled a little hysterically at that ironic choice of words, ran his hand along the back of his neck. “But I can’t. Not tonight. It’s just…it’s not the right time.”
At Marlene’s nod, Claire hopped up off the bed and walked over to them. The look she gave Castiel was venomous, rebellious.
Then Dean’s head swiveled to Jack with a dangerous gleam in his eyes as he leveled them on the teenager. Jack’s grew frighteningly wide and he practically dropped the phone as he rabbited for the hallway, Claire skidding along behind him in her stockinged feet as they both fled Dean’s wrath.
“Cas, it’s fine, don’t worry about it,” Dean said. He placed a reassuring hand at the back of Castiel’s neck, fingers playing with the strands of his hair. “We’re just teasing you.” He softened, then leaned in for a kiss. “Thank you again for breakfast,” he said in a low voice.
It was a kiss unlike any he’d ever tasted. Yes, there had been firsts before—their first kiss at the opera, the one in the belfry, their first kiss as a couple—even the kiss that afternoon in the hospital, with Dean fully outed to his father. Still, this one felt different somehow. Fresh and brand new and filled with infinite possibilities—as though admitting it to himself and telling Cas had reshaped his entire life. Dean felt
“Yeah, well, now you know,” Dean said, looking away. Talk of his roots always made him uneasy for some reason.
The meeting was grueling and it took all of Dean’s skill and tact to close the deal, but finally after two hours and a few rounds of whiskey, Dean got him to sign. And for two percent less than the guy had originally been willing to go. Dean relayed the good news via voicemail to John, then hopped back into the company car feeling lighter than air.
“Yes, I can see that.” Uriel’s eyes slid over to Castiel, who swallowed nervously under his calculating gaze. “Perhaps my employee will care to help our other guests now that you are leaving us,” he said dryly.
From what he picked up eavesdropping at the diner, the two most popular places to be on Liberty Ave past sunset was the bar Woody’s and the club Babylon. The baths also seemed popular, but Dean didn’t want to be naked if he happened to run into their incubus. Besides, from what he could gather, all of the victims had been at one of the two aforementioned hotspots on the nights they were murdered.
Castiel’s breath caught at that. Dean watched in self-satisfaction as his penis twitched in excitement. Hardening again already.
Dean nodded and turned back to the center, crouching down so that the DVDs were at eye-level. He got the sense that Castiel was getting freaked out by his opulent lifestyle and suddenly regretted the comments he’d made about his tiny nutshell of an apartment.
There was a hungry gleam in Castiel’s eyes. He lowered himself down between Dean’s legs with a purpose, mouth reaching for him as soon as Dean eased back into the pillows.
“Naughty,” Dean said, teasing again. He nibbled at the ear. “If I’m being honest,” Dean admitted into the sensitized cove of Castiel’s ear, “I’ve thought about it too. Been wanting to tie you up since I met you.”
The next morning, Castiel was grateful for his new coat on his way in to the group home. The wind was gusting frigidly cold air that turned the subway into an icebox. Even with the extra layers he was half-frozen by the time he arrived.
Deanna wandered into the kitchen just as she asked it, carrying a load of dirty plates in from the other room.
coming from the foyer. John’s loud footsteps echoed through the ornate living room. Dean had just got off a call and was getting ready to take a shower. He looked up into his father’s irate face as he stormed into the room. The man was
As peaceful and as beautiful as it all was, Castiel thought to himself, it was a poor façade, for not everything was fine and dandy on this morning.
“I think about where we might end up,” Dean said, “Whether this will last, because it feels too good to be true sometimes, you know? But then I think, no, that can’t be right because it’s not like what we have is perfect.” He looked over at Cas. “We’ve got our issues. But when I think about the future it’s not about that. It’s about…being happy—being
Castiel lurched under him and cried out. Dean grinned—he hadn’t been expecting that. It was a move Dean loved to use to make his partner squirm, and Castiel did not disappoint. The man panted and whined into the sheets, begging Dean to do it again.
Conversation flitted between the mundane and talk of Dean and Sam’s childhood, as well as sharing stories on how everyone met.
a mile and a half by his count. Either he was on the shore to nowhere, or heaven went by the ‘arrive when you need to’ rule, which Dean guessed would make sense within the whole ‘as you wish it, so shall it be’ logic of this place.
“Cas…why didn’t you say anything?” Dean asked. Castiel’s eyes flickered over his face, reading the hurt in those puppy-dog green eyes.
“Yeah, alright,” he says, still smiling, “Was gonna ask if you maybe wanted to take a break anyways.”
Dean hummed and stepped back. Charlie was grinning at them, the tip of the broom poking into her cheek as he leaned on the handle. She gave a wistful little sigh.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said, “It’s not you. I know that sounds like a bad cliché, but I swear that’s not it.”
all night with Cas and then doing it all over again? Dean rather felt like he was the luckiest man alive at the moment.
The walk out of Salisbury Plain is long, but it’s a surprisingly nice day and hey, he’s alive, so Jacob’s not really worried about it. He’s a little sad to have left behind such good friends, but he’s robot-heads-over-the-moon excited to be back home.
“Jesus, it’s like all of them are me when I was 16,” Dean remarked. He dug in his pocket for a second and pulled out something small. “Guess I overestimated this place. I don’t want to have to beat these guys back all night, so desperate times and all that.”
,” Dean whines at him. He sighs and slumps back in his seat. “Come on, don’t be a dick. You were the one who…” Dean trails off and sighs again, scrubs a hand over his face. He glances back at Cas. “Whatever. It’s fine. I’ll just follow you back like this, how’s that?”
“Cas. Uh, hey. G’morning,” Dean greeted. His heartbeat sped up as soon as his eyes met with Cas’s bright blue ones. Maybe he wouldn’t need the cardio workout after all.
“Is that where we’re—” Castiel cut off and twisted back to face Dean. “Just what have you planned?” he asked, a curious edge to his voice.
Castiel’s head swivels to face the hunter like an owl focusing in on a sound from deep within the forest, his brow pinched together in confusion.
“So, you two have any plans for Christmas?” he asked. He looked from Castiel to Dean. “Cuz I was thinking…maybe Jess and I can fly to New York again. See the city all done up in lights.”
“I could, but it wouldn’t be nearly as enjoyable as witnessing your reactions to my unorthodox answers,” Castiel said playfully.
Dean caught it in his hand and threw back his head in laughter. Good Lord. Regardless of how they’d gotten here, Drunk Cas was
“Well? Don’t leave me in suspense. What was it?” Dean asks, sitting down opposite him. He’s already grinning.
“I have work early,” Castiel murmured. He made no move to leave, though, or to pull away. He merely continued to stare at Dean’s lips. He pressed forward, capturing them again.
John was holding the door open for them when they pulled apart, and they hurried up the walk, ducking under the arch of his arm and into the warm, cinnamon-and-apple-pie smell of the Winchester Family Home. The smell of roasting turkey also hit them as soon as they walked in, nearly bowling Dean over with the succulent smell of slow-cooked meat. He turned back to Cas with wide eyes.
Castiel blushed furiously, but it was covered by the kiss Dean pressed to his lips. His mouth tasted bitter from the coffee.
him. The spineless coward. Dean glared after the man. He was so not getting Dean’s blessing for that. Anna could do way better in his opinion.
“Yes, well…I was never very good at saying no to you,” Cas replied with a thin smile. He glanced around, taking in the bustle of people pressed in around them on the crowded sidewalk. “Where are we? I expected we would be meeting at the lake.”
“Oh! Oh my goodness, yes, I—I know all about that. I volunteer, you see, at a shelter.” She laughed gaily. “Why, it must be fate that you called me! I mean, what are the chances?”
Dean held his breath, waiting for him to ask something more, to make a comment about the supposed ‘meeting’ that Dean had the following day. When he didn’t, Dean let out the breath and tried to tell himself that he was working himself up for nothing. It was just a boring old meeting to Cas—he didn’t typically ask about those. Of course Dean had a backup story prepared, but he was unlikely to need it.
“Alright, let’s get this party started,” Dean said, throwing on his Christmas rock-and-roll playlist. He began by helping Cas take everything they’d purchased—tinsel, beads, lights, the
Dean was a nervous knot on their way to pick up his car. After over two weeks of waiting for it to arrive, he couldn’t decide if he was excited or about to throw up. The condition of the Impala hinged on which it would be, and the uncertainty—Schrodinger’s car, if you will—was killing him.
“I thought…” Castiel’s eyes flickered up and met his tentatively. “I assumed…after what I said…” he trailed off, and Dean could feel his heart thudding away in his chest at the uncertainty in the angel’s voice. He couldn’t really blame Castiel for having doubts about them when he’d thought the exact same thing for the better part of a decade.
He was facing Jack when he said it, so he missed the slight downward turn of Dean’s lips. It was gone by the time he looked back at Dean, replaced by a gracious—albeit staged—smile.
There’s a heavy beat of silence in which Jacob does his best to keep his wits about him. There’s a rushing noise in his ears that’s getting louder by the second.
“I know, I know,” Dean said. He heaved a loud, frustrated sigh. “I wasn’t thinking.” His green eyes flickered uncertainly to Cas’s steely blue ones. “He hurt you, and I just kinda…lost it,” he said, apologetically.
“Hmm,” John hummed suspiciously. “Dean, I know it isn’t any of my business but…does Carmen know you’re seeing other women?”
Dean swallowed a groan and sent Carmen another rendition of his pathetic puppy-dog face. He cleared his throat.
“Fine. Whatever.” Sam let out a frustrated sigh and pressed his lips together in that signature bitch-face of his. “Anyway, Bobby called. He needs our help with something. Said it was urgent.”
Castiel reached for the glasses and blinked at the strange sensation of having full use of his hand again.
“I’m not sure yet. Something that pays reasonably well and is willing to take on someone who is… inexperienced. Castiel I think had a couple of ideas.”
“I don’t want to end up in the tabloids,” he muttered, “Not with you.” Dean stuffed his hands into his jacket pockets and hunched his shoulders before he explained. “When I met you, that’s when that part of me—the old me or whatever you want to call it—that was the end of it. I want that person to stay in the past, you know? And I feel like if…if it happened with you then it might…”
Dean starts to run his hand through Castiel’s hair again, but freezes halfway through when he says that. Castiel freezes with him. Neither move nor breathe for a long beat.
Dean shoved his hips forward since he couldn’t move his hands, which got him an inch of something rubbed up against Castiel. It also got Cas to stand up on his tip toes and lean in, dragging the full weight of him down against Dean’s front. This got him feet of the slide he was looking for and his hips jerked again at the glorious friction.
the fireplace roaring when he got out, as promised, which did a lot to dissolve his sour mood. The other man was just hanging up the phone when Dean approached him with a towel knotted about his hips. He made a needy grab for the coffee.
Jo led the way, Charlie trailing behind her while appreciating the mesmerizing swing of her hips as she walked expertly on four-inch silver pumps—the kind of shoe that Charlie would break every bone in her body should she attempt it herself. There was a small crowd as they entered. Many of them were coworkers Dean had invited from the office—Charlie grimaced as she caught sight of her underlings Harry and Ed—as well as a few of Cas’s friends. Anna and…Chad? No, it was Chuck. Because when he wouldn’t stop singing
“Heh, yeah, that could be it. Ok, hang on. I’ll be there soon as I can.” Dean hung up and looked to Kevin, who was still waiting by the door. “Kev? Cancel my meetings for the rest of the day. Something I gotta do.”
Castiel’s voice hitched as he breathed out, “Dean, I am not a plate,” in a tantalizingly-strained whine that had Dean’s cock poking at the sheets.
“One sample per bowl,” the woman told him in clipped, short words. Her eyebrows angled sharply down toward the bridge of her nose.
“He’s fine, just feeling a little under the weather,” Dean told him. He glanced to Cas, who had disappeared back under the covers and assumed a fetal position.
Castiel shook his head. He buttoned up his jacket, gave a light chuckle and pulled further away as Dean stole a kiss to his pale neck to stall him, then leaned back in to kiss Dean on the lips as he fastened the topmost snap.
They headed toward the park, walking side by side in companionable silence. Dean wasn’t really sure where they were going or what they were planning on doing once they got there, but he had the rest of the day free and found he really didn’t care either way.
Dean opened the door for Cas, ushering him in. He wanted very badly to kiss him goodnight, but thought better of it in present company. Instead he resigned himself to a light press to the small of Cas’s back as he climbed into the cab and a relaxed smile.
“I am not a fan of either of those things,” he said. The guilty look lingered, however. After a moment he asked, “Where would you put it, Dean?”
“You let him live,” Castiel clarifies, because it’s an important distinction and Dean deserves it to be made.
“You’ve got some fucking nerve, asking that after the shit you just pulled,” Dean said angrily, stepping in. “Cas, you don’t have to prove anything.”
But that was half an hour ago, and Dean still hadn’t heard back from the doctor. His feet carried him across the waiting room floor as though they were on wings. If there had been anyone else in the waiting room then Dean was sure he would be freaking them the hell out too, and a large part of him was grateful that there was no one here to witness his frayed nerves and obsessive pacing. He would stop if he could, Dean told himself, but he just couldn’t help it. He’d watched enough Dr. Sexy to know that this was the part in every episode where things went horribly wrong—just when you thought everything was hunky dory—and in his worked up state, Dean’s mind wrenched into overdrive that something might happen before he got the chance to tell Cas everything he’d been too much of a coward to say to him before.
“Go?” Dean blurts out, his eyes widening, “Go where?” When Castiel doesn’t answer him at first, Dean says it again. “Go
“What? No!” Dean said, shaking his head. “No way. Where’s this—? Why, cuz you’re a guy? ‘Cause it would be easier, or more
“Oh. I see.” Castiel lowered his eyes, blushing lightly. Dean shifted his weight to his other foot, feeling suddenly self-conscious.
Castiel did as he asked, closing his eyes as Dean stripped off the clothes he’d worn to dinner and slipped the thin maid’s costume over his broad frame. He’d gotten the largest available size, but it was still a little tight in the chest and shoulders—it was very obviously not made for someone of his physique, and Dean pulled at the front of the outfit in increasing self-consciousness.
The smile Dean gifts him is worth him saying it. Dean leans in again and kisses him, and this time Castiel feels his heart as though it bursts through the amulet and into his own. It is breathless, this feeling, and he gasps into Dean’s mouth, both surprised and aroused.
“Hang on a minute. What bunker?” Jacob cuts in, holding out a hand, “Also—what’s with the disappearing act? And can someone please explain the whole multiple Earths thing to me?” Jacob takes a breath, feeling his carefully controlled panic rise up full force. “Just what in
“Why? Who the hell am I supposed to be impressing?” Claire lifted her chin, nodding in Castiel’s direction, “Him? You think I give a shit what he thinks of me?”
in the system,” Harry told him, “Everything is hooked up exactly as it should be. It’s not a technical issue so it has to be a
“Come on, Ducky, you gotta eat something,” Dean urged him, “You can’t be running on empty on your first day. Claire will
“Yeah, I can see that,” Dean said. “I guess I had you pegged for the wine and dine type, that’s all.”
Dean shadows Castiel down the hall, makes sure that he isn’t about to collapse before leaving him on his own. His hand rests in the small of Castiel’s back, comforting, and it’s a nice gesture, Castiel thinks, that Dean still cares this much about him after everything they’ve been through—that he still risked his life to rescue Cas from The Empty despite knowing how he really feels about the hunter. He wishes it didn’t hurt so much. He wishes Dean touching him like this didn’t feel quite so much like he’s drowning blindly in The Emptiness all over again. He steps out of reach, clearing his throat.
! Didn’t mean to interrupt…uh, anything,” Sam said awkwardly, “I think the fire’s mostly out in the other room if you want to come in now. Gran basically told Granddad that if he didn’t have anything nice to say then he could ‘keep his goddamn mouth shut’!” Sam recounted. His following laugh was forced. Dean supposed it was because Sam had spent the last few minutes attempting to diffuse another Winchester-Campbell bomb.
As the words tumbled out of him, Dean was left feeling anxious and confused. He stared down at his hands and watched his fingers fiddle with the end of his tie, feeling strangely detached from his body in that moment.
They arrived at the soup kitchen with plenty of time to spare before they opened to the public. Reverend Paul greeted them as they arrived, pleased to see that Dean had tagged along. There was a brief organizational meeting before the doors opened to assign tasks and introduce any new faces. Dean was soon lost in a pool of names. When it was his turn to introduce himself, he gulped.
“Yes, what was I thinking?” Castiel replied. He was grinning though, blue eyes bright as they looked up at Dean.
Dean turned them and pushed lightly. Castiel fell to the edge of the bed, hands flying to Dean’s thighs. He ran them up under the skirt and felt Dean shiver as his thumbs brushed the sensitive skin over his hip bones. He lowered himself down, straddling Cas on the edge of the bed, the skirt flowing out over his thighs, and leaned in to press a kiss to his lips.
It may have been Dean’s wishful thinking, but he swore Castiel sounded disappointed. Cas shrugged into his tan overcoat, watching as Dean set the bag and the toolbox in his hand down next to the door.
He hung up and turned back to his father, sucking in a breath to gather up his courage for the inevitable interrogation that was about to follow.
“You know I’ll take care of you,” Dean said, pulling Cas in tightly against his chest, “And the kid. Hell, at this point we should just start a charity.” He grinned down at the man in his arms. “Cas and his lost kids,” he teased.
Dean fell for the trap—hook, line, and…ice cream. He pulled Cas to a stop and pressed his lips to his mouth, pushing his tongue inside to get a taste of the sweet cream on his tongue. It was faintly spicy, and it most definitely
“Is that where you left your dignity?” Castiel asked him dryly. Dean laughed and felt his worry wane away. If Cas could joke about it, then maybe Dean was reading too much into this.
“Shit,” he cursed shortly into it. His eyes flickered up to meet Cas’s, briefly. “’S harder than it looks,” he grumbled, focusing down again. He brought his other hand up to shield what he was writing and said, “Don’t look, I want it to be a surprise.”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel said. He was giving Dean his ‘I don’t understand’ squint, so him saying it out loud was rather unnecessary. “What is the ultimate purpose of a…condom?”
“Remember when I said I was getting you a stupidly expensive present?” Dean asked him. At Castiel’s slow nod, he continued. “Well, turns out it doesn’t wrap so well. So. That door stays locked until Christmas morning. Sorry, but you’ll have to find somewhere else to hole up.”
Dean heard hushed voices filtering down the hallway as he exited the bathroom, and though he couldn’t make out the words, he could clearly hear the scolding tone of Helen’s voice. Dean approached the sitting room as quietly as he could, straining his ears as he got closer.
“I wasn’t, okay!!?” Dean yelled back at him. He moved away with a growl, running a hand through his hair in agitation. “I wasn’t thinking! But look—I still made the right call,” he insisted.
“Dean, what I want to do to you…” Cas said huskily, “It would not be appropriate in this setting. Can we please finish this somewhere else?”
“How can you be so sure?” Castiel asked him, lifting his head up off Dean’s shoulder and turning to peer intently at him.
“Um. W-well…I’m a dedicated worker,” Kevin started, “And…I have a great memory, so I can remember anything you need me to. And…um…I’m resourceful…”
“He…didn’t really give me an answer,” Castiel replied. He sighed. “Well…he did, but…not one that makes much sense to me.”
followed a moment later. Then there was a low murmur of voices that had Dean furrowing his brow in confusion and craning his neck around the corner. Cas hadn’t mentioned having any guests over tonight. He hadn’t texted to let him know he was bringing someone back with him.
“Tell him I’m sorry but something came up,” Dean said. He gave her the big green puppy-dog eyes he knew worked on pretty much anyone. It helped that he actually
, she made me promise to tell Sammy,” he said, pushing back the sudden emotion. “It took me a few months but I finally did as she asked.” He paused, thinking back, and smiled a little sadly. “I think she wanted me to have someone to talk to about it,” he confessed, “And she must have known I wouldn’t tell my dad. I think…I think she didn’t want me to be alone. We were always close, you know? I could talk to her about anything as a kid and she would always have my back.”
5. Lastly, I've updated the rating on this fic because I finally started in on the smut chapter this week.
Dean walked John to the door, following silently behind his old man with his eyes glued to the hardwood floor under his feet. He chewed the inside of his lip, a million things on his mind but no way of knowing how to express them all.
“Good point. Maybe I should have you earn your keep if you’re going to be staying here more often,” Dean said thoughtfully, “Maybe I should fire my housekeeper and have you take her spot. Then I’d get you all to myself. I still think you’d make a great French Maid,” Dean told him. He dropped a kiss on his lips and grinned wickedly at him.
“Yeah, so do you, probably,” Dean said, looking ashamed. “I’m not exactly the kind of guy you’d want to bring home to meet your mother.”
“I won’t,” Dean said. The line finally reached the counter, and he paused for a moment to order his coffee. “I’ll let you know how it goes,” he added as an afterthought, failing to hide the thread of unease in his voice.
“You should eat first,” Dean told him. He grabbed the laptop off the bed and closed it, then swung his legs out over the side of the bed. “I had Kevin drop off some food. I can warm some of it up for you.” He started to get up when Castiel grabbed his arm—or rather, tried to, then remembered the cast on his wrist too late and ended up swiping at Dean’s arm with it instead.
,” Dean said, shooting him a coy smile. Castiel met his eyes in the mirror. They twinkled with mischief.
“Where did you learn to fix a sink anyway?” Castiel asked him then, “I would have assumed you would just call someone if it was needed.”
Castiel blinks and snaps out of his daze with resounding grace, which is ironic considering his grace now hangs around Dean’s neck. It surprises him that the hunter still wears it. Castiel’s eyes follow the small vial necklace as Dean shifts in front of him, watches as it resettles against the hunter’s sternum. Over his heart. He touches the one he has in his pocket and feels the familiar swirl of guilt-wrapped-fondness. It is beginning to wear on him.
“I know we’ve been moving kinda fast,” Dean continued, “And I know you’ve been hurt in the past. I know you got trust issues cuz of that.”
The silence stretches until Jacob breaks it with, “I’m sorry.” He watches as Dean’s eyes flit to him, sees the same sharp anguish in them—this time wet with tears. Dean runs a thumb over his eye and wipes away the moisture.
They continued eating, sounds of pleasant chewing and slurping intermingled with light conversation. Dean learned Castiel had a number of siblings, all of them brothers. All of them, except Cas, had become priests like his parents wanted.
“Well, let me paint you a scenario,” Dean said, crossing his arms and shifting his weight against the edge of the desk, “Say my dad asks you about my schedule. And I’ve got plans with someone.” Dean raised an eyebrow at the kid. “Someone you’ve maybe met before, you catch my drift?”
He nudged Dean, who had earbuds in and was attempting to blast his flying nerves away with Metallica.
John took his son by the arm, pulling him off to the side. Zach was doing a great job of pretending he wasn’t listening in, but Dean knew he was. He gritted his teeth, cursing his damned luck.
” he curses, shoving at the vamp and swinging the machete like a pro. The vamp’s head goes rolling across the floor and its body tips over, falling limply to the ground, and Dean slumps back against the post in defeat.
It’s silent between them for a beat, long enough where Dean can start to see the heartbreak in his father’s eyes. Something squeezes in his chest like a vice and grips him with a painful clarity.
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean replied. He was already grinning and he didn’t really know why until he remembered with a jolt that
“Yes, I believe this is the last of it,” Castiel replied, shaking himself out of his daze. He rose to his feet and took one more look around the room. Then he tucked the box under his bum arm, picked up the painting with his good hand, and followed Dean out to the car.
Dean was moving before he could think twice about the consequences of getting himself involved. The businessman was just opening his mouth to deliver possibly the most uncomfortable pickup line in gay history when Dean cock-blocked him quite emphatically.
He opened his hand. Resting in the palm of it were two thin bands of silver. He looked up at Cas, seeming almost shy about what he was about to suggest.
Then Castiel’s hands were at his waistband and he was unbuttoning Dean’s pants. Dean’s breath caught as his cold hands slid under his boxers.
“Uh-huh. Isn’t that Kevin’s job?” Charlie asked. Then, sensing that Dean’s patience was wearing thin, added, “Dare I ask what happened to the perfectly good plane tickets you said you
“Very well,” Castiel replied. The bellboy shifted his weight. “May I ask…what is on the agenda for today?”
“I said I don’t want your help!” Claire snapped at him. She shoved to her feet. “Anyway, I should go,” she mumbled bitterly, staring at the table, “They lock the doors after curfew.”
“Hey there,” he said with as much charm as he could muster. He read the woman’s nametag pinned to the front of her blouse. “Bella. I missed my flight. 'M trying to get to Minnetonka. When’s the next one?”
Castiel didn’t say anything—didn’t argue, didn’t agree with him, just peered at him with his head tilted to the side and his eyes squinted in a way that had Dean feeling like he was reading something between the lines that Dean didn’t want him to. If Dean had any idea what the hell it was, maybe he could put a stop to it.
“Dean, I thought we agreed you would be more than just accompanying me on this trip,” John was saying in a low voice. Dean tried not to be distracted by the squinty look the bellboy was shooting him from across the lobby. He wished it were possible to send telepathic messages.
“Cas..?” he says, hesitant, because if it isn’t real then he’s going to have to deal with the fallout before he dies again.
He holds the pendant and watches for a moment as Dean says something to Sammy, who turns to Eileen to get her opinion. He feels the tug again when Sam swoops down for a kiss and the couple laughs, Eileen craning her neck back as she looks up at Sam. Dean’s eyes shift to meet his, and for a moment the hunter just looks at him. His eyes seem to ask a question, but Castiel doesn’t know what he’s trying to say, and he most likely has zero answers for Dean anyway. He’s about the worst person to look to for advice on how to meet the right person and fall in love. All of his relationships have ended in blood spilt, literally.
They grabbed rental skates and before he knew it, Castiel found himself wobbling forward toward the ice skating rink, with Dean ready to catch him should he fall
A couple hours later, Dean found himself seated at the hotel restaurant across the table from the realtor, Pamela, giving her his pitch for the New York branch of
He grabbed the bag from the counter for Cas and walked him out of the store with his arms still looped around him.
“The doctor said the cast will be off by Christmas,” Castiel mused. “I suppose we will decide then.” There was a soft smile to his lips, and they twitched when his mouth shaped around the pronoun.
He was so wrapped up in his thoughts of domestic bliss and the faint smell of Dean coming off the soft fabric of his borrowed PJs that Castiel didn’t register the low murmur of voices coming from the foyer.
“I was also…angry,” Castiel admitted, “Though not at you. Not really. I was angry with myself for…liking you despite knowing your track record with other women and…wanting you anyway.”
Cas swept his eyes over the costume Dean was wearing for the first time and opened his mouth, presumably to ask what it was. Before he could, Dean heard a deep booming voice from behind him.
Cas shows up after, and the feeling in Dean’s stomach jumps a little. They’re actually having a conversation this time around (He even makes Castiel laugh—Dean didn’t know he could
“I like anything you sing,” he answered, feeling pleased at the light blush that sentiment brought to Cas’s cheeks. He pressed another lingering kiss against his lips. “How about the spare bedroom?” he asked when he pulled away, “I mean, there’s the room next to the workout room but it’s kinda full of stuff right now. Don’t think I’ll have time to clean it out before Christmas.”

“Really, Dean,” Castiel said, shaking his head and extracting himself from Dean in an attempt to get back to his feet. He got to his knees before Dean was pulling him up against his solid, muscular form. He held Castiel for the space of a long breath and just gazed at him with such fire and affection in his eyes that it left him speechless.
“He’s still a bit shy,” Em explained. He turned to Justin. “So, Justin, how’s your hand feel this morning?”
Castiel’s voice grew dense and sharp—one hot mass of energy that crackled in the air. Dean hugged him tighter and let out a heavy sigh.
“Do you have any idea what this will cost us?” John said harshly, the frown on his face deepening. “The stock points are going to
The God’s-honest truth was that he was risking a lot more by lying to his father, if last night and this morning was any indication. But would Cas want him without all of the money and prestige? Dean was pretty sure it was the only thing he had going for him at this point, and if things with his father didn’t go well it might just break them. He already felt like he was holding on by a thread, trying to be responsible, trying to be someone he could be proud of—someone worthy of being with Cas. The truth was Dean didn’t trust himself enough to hold it together if he lost everything. That was the part that scared him the most.
Dean’s head snapped up to meet his father’s calculating gaze, his green eyes widening. He dropped the last folder into the drawer without seeing or even caring where it ended up.
Castiel nodded and took a shuddering breath. He blinked rapidly and Dean could see moisture behind his eyes. He scooped Cas’s face into his hands.
whatever it was so that he could get the tears to stop, but this was different. Castiel was crying out of relief—in the act of letting go. It was a cathartic process, and Dean didn’t feel uncomfortable with it, just incredibly grateful that he had the privilege of witnessing it happen.
As they passed under the Bow Bridge, Castiel gasped softly, looking up at its worn stone underside. Dean stopped rowing long enough so that they drifted under it slowly. He tilted his head back and admired the lattice structure underneath and the intricate swirls in the corners of its arch.
“How so?” Cas said. He tilted his head, not getting the reference. The look of soft bewilderment on his face had Dean staring at his lips and thinking about the night before.
Castiel grinned and stepped forward, hefting Dean bridle-style into his arms. He closed his eyes briefly in concentration and Dean gasped as a pair of iridescent, mother-of-pearl colored wings suddenly emerged from between his shoulder blades. Castiel leapt into the sky, and with one large beat of the near fifteen-foot appendages, glided out over the sea. Far on the horizon, the sun was just starting to set in a brilliant display of color. Dean closed his eyes and relaxed into the feeling of the breeze on his face and the soft sound of the wind whispering through Castiel’s feathers, and thought about what it would be like to have his own set of wings—to have the ability to go anywhere he wished in the blink of an eye, whether it be here in heaven or on a real beach somewhere. Either way, he knew he wanted Cas there with him, because
“Cas, it’s fine,” he said softly. He pressed his lips briefly against Cas’s mouth, gathering him up into a soothing kiss. “I’ll be gentle.” He took a breath, paused. “We don’t have to go all the way,” he said.
“Sure, go ahead. Get me thrown out of here. At least I won’t have to sit through any more of these dumb lessons,” she grumbled.
“It is quite alright,” Paul said. “I believe I’ve said that one before myself. Typically when counting out the offerings at the end of the day.”
The generous blush that painted Castiel’s cheeks had Dean grinning widely and vowing to say more embarrassing things to the angel in the future, his macho-man persona be damned.
“Ahh…no. Thank you,” Castiel said quickly, blushing. Why, he wasn’t entirely sure, until he realized that Dean would surely attempt to catch him should he fall. “So, don’t land on my arm, knees bent. What else?” Castiel asked, attempting to focus away from how it would feel to fall into Dean’s embrace. To think he was doomed and then have those strong, bulging biceps wrap around him. To look up with a surprised gasp into laughing golden-green eyes and a face as bronze as the statue at the entrance to the rink.
“Hey, get in here,” he said, meeting Cas’s eyes in the mirror as he brushed his teeth, “Who cares if your cast gets wet now, right? I’m tired of showering alone.”
“You are…using me as a distraction,” the angel says after a moment, “So that we do not have to talk about Michael.”
Dean looked down at his plate with a light blush blooming across his nose. He really didn’t know what to say to that, so after a few seconds of awkward silence he ended up with a mumbled, “Thanks, Jess.”
Dean stands in front of Cas with what he figures is a pretty lost and pathetic look on his face, but he can’t bring himself to care right about now.
“I know how much you like a bath, Cas, don’t even lie,” Dean said against his skin as he let go. He licked a slow strip up the length of neck he’d just had between his teeth. Castiel drew in another breath and tried to control the shudder that rolled through him. He was only half successful. Dean grinned at the reaction and hummed into his skin. “I could take you in the tub too, little Ducky.”
Castiel grinned wickedly and took advantage of his distraction to toss the noodles in his hand at Dean.
Dean just shrugged and set the phone on the nightstand, then sat down on the edge of the bed. He placed a hand at Castiel’s cheek and then slid it slowly back through his sweat-damp hair. Castiel took a measured breath in through his nose and out through his mouth, closing his eyes with a small noise of discomfort.
Dean felt his eyebrow rise into his hairline. Was it just him or had the gesture been a bit…colorful? He glanced to Castiel. The man’s blue eyes were wide. He’d noticed it too.
“Well!?” he screams into The Empty, “Where are you, you bastard!? You thought you could trap me forever in here!? I told you I would get out!” Well, perhaps not, but it’s a gamble Jacob’s willing to take. “Don’t you have anything to say to
“Don’t,” he said, “You and I both know it’s a lie. Look, I’m not blaming you, Cas. I’m saying I get it and I’m willing to do whatever you need to get there.”
