As they were leaving, Dean realized something: they only had one horse for three people, and the one who was capable of transforming into a horse was passed out.
” Hester shouted. Dean observed the two dryads arguing, while he was trying to understand what they were saying.
The main thing he was feeling was pain, though. Everything from his skin to all of his bones were changing at the same time in his body. Even after all these years, he was still not used to it.
They saw the two men leaving, going somewhere unknown. At this moment Walt stood up and moved as discreetly as he could.
“They are. Ben woke me up at six am this morning because he couldn’t wait to go egg-hunting. I hope Claire didn’t give too much of a hard time.”
"It must be nice in summer. No surprise that you guys don't let anybody in the forest." Dean said as he leaned over.
Dean ended up on the bed. A lot happened in the last hours. It had been a while, a very long while since he’d talked about the curse. He knew he had to leave Castiel fast as he could before he ended up getting attached. But right now, he was too tired.
"This is very heart-warming, but you should go back to your house. And I need my beauty sleep." Rowena told them.
"Actually, yes," Dean said as he got out of the car and stretched his legs. "Wait. I think it worked." He searched for anything sharp he could find. There was surprisingly nothing like that in the glove compartment or his pockets.
After a few minutes, everyone had arrived. Anna and Gilda announced to the beginning of the egg hunt to the very excited kids.
"Did you find anything?" Dean asked, startling Castiel who immediately took his eyes off Dean, hoping Dean wouldn’t have noticed.
“Hello, we’re searching for a woman named Alex. Do you know if she’s here right now?” Dean asked the bartender. The man had a weird haircut that we had never seen in his life. In the front, the hairs were cut short and in the back, his hair was much longer. In secret, Dean hoped that this haircut would never be a trend.
Dean walked towards Castiel - slowly, cautiously -  and hugged him. "Hey, everything's gonna be all right."
“Sam! We have a problem!” He could sense the other man struggling, but he didn’t care. They will have a lot of questions for him.
Dean looked at the branch Castiel gave him, realizing that he almost turned down such an important gift.
“I promise we are not all like this.” Castiel laughed as Dean continued to grumble, pain shooting through his legs. He stretched a bit and picked up his bag from the ground.
"Yes, sweetie. So, what do you have here?" Rowena pointed to Castiel. She was a redhead with a thick Scottish and was wearing longer clothes than the two other dryads.
A few dryads were already there, fighting off those people. Some of them had bruises and were bleeding.
"Do I have to remind you that there are people after us; and, unlike you, I CAN DIE," Castiel shouted back.
Once the hunter couldn’t see him, he threw the clothes to him. A sound like bones cracking resonated behind him. Grunts of pain that almost made Dean turn and check if Cas was fine followed it. The hunter closed his eyes and waited. He tried not to pay attention to the noises without success.
After a few minutes of stumbling in the dark, they finally found the end of it. Dean peeked out and saw a long, empty corridor. They emerged on their tip-toes, dust and cobwebs on their clothes and in their hair.
“Dean?” he asked. “You can turn around.” When Dean did so, he saw Cas looking at him, anxiety in his eyes. “Dean, I can explain. I swear I didn’t hurt Sam and...” he started, obviously nervous.
It was a peaceful morning in the Winchester’s household. Except for the six years old Ben who was jumping up and down his father’s bed.
"I'm almost done," Castiel said behind him. "Okay. It’s done." A big cloud of smoke rose from the bowl they were using, making Castiel cough.
"Dean, look at the bee I made!" Castiel told Dean as he showed him his finished drawing. The bee, Castiel showed him had freckles on his face and had green eyes.
"Are you sure you're all right? It's late and you’ve never come here before on your own." Dean asked Castiel. "Is something going on in the forest?" He continued, his eyebrows frowned.
"I'll survive," Dean answered and Castiel rolled his eyes. "Believe me, I'll survive. What did you find?"
Dean had been looking at very boring texts for almost half an hour when he finally found something. Staring at Castiel, who was reading another book on sigils, he went to fetch Sam. Please tell me I’m wrong, he thought, as he glanced back at Castiel. He could see confusion written on Castiel’s face.
The group was living in a castle that was three hours away on horseback. After this explanation, Dean had insisted that the young woman show him and Castiel the way.
"Wait, Castiel! Don't!" The last thing Castiel saw and heard was the werewolf attacking him and the sound of a gun.
"Improvise, I guess." They started at the table, hoping that if they kept a low profile, he wouldn't come to see them.
Dean looked around, lost. He didn’t understand what to do. This wasn’t a usual case. He didn’t have the time to sit down and search in books which monster was behind it. He wasn’t sure if he should trust Cas but he had no one else.
"That wasn't my intention. But as your friend, I want to know everything." She answered, jumping from her tree.
"Had a lot of things to do. And I found a place with a lot of rare plants." Dean said as he put away some potions and turned his back to Sam.
“He is definitely hiding something, but I don’t believe he’s dangerous. Maybe we should trust him a bit more.”
They had talked beforehand and decided that Castiel was going to wait until Dean had explained the basics.
Dean was studying another book. There was nothing that could help them. He glanced at Castiel, who was picking up random books. Sitting in front of Dean, he started to read it at a rapid pace with only his fingers peeking out of the sleeves of his borrowed shirt.
“We should go to the next village. Sam and I saved a psychic, Missouri, from a witch. Maybe she can help us. Get behind me on Baby’s back.”
Castiel chuckled before he remembered their situation and sighed."We should add some more protection. They’re probably still after us."
“Well, let's look at that, shall we," Rowena told Dean. Dean looked at Castiel, not knowing what to say. He wanted to go with them. He wanted to stay at Castiel's side.
"Dean, Sam asked me to go search for you." Well, that one on the only thing he said to him. The last two weeks he had only discussed with Sam. Wich seemed puzzled about what was happening.
Once Castiel finally had a car - it was a large, grey car, more discreet than the previous one - they headed back to their motel. Castiel arrived first.
His impression was confirmed when she gave them the map. The two watched her rush toward her horse and leave in a hurry. Now alone and hidden, Dean got the map out.
"Castiel. You remember there was a fire last night?" His mom asked. "We learned this morning that the house that was on fire was Dean's."
"Cas," Dean said gently. "Look at me, please." Castiel turned around and looked at Dean who had a big smile on his face. Dean opened his mouth and closed other and other again.
"I was searching for you. Am I bothering you, guys?" She asked, visibly confused and looking at Dean who was staring at the floor.
Sam was standing between his brother and Alex, not knowing what to do. It seemed like Dean had a lot to recount later.
“We aren’t getting any other information, are we?” Dean sighed. “Anyway, I need to do some research in the library. Are you coming, Castiel?”
At his potion shop, Dean couldn’t stop thinking about his few encounters with Castiel. Unfortunately, with all the work, he had to wait until the end of the week to get back to see Castiel. And he wondered why Castiel wanted to see him again. Not that he was complaining. The day passed slowly, way too slow for Dean. From time to time, he wondered if he should bring some human objects that Castiel had never seen before.
The first three weeks went by quickly and without any problem. Castiel and Dean were constantly together and, Lucifer left Castiel alone. However, this didn't last long. Apparently, Lucifer thought it was hilarious to prank Castiel. The morning after Castiel got stuck outside his dorm, only wearing his boxers, he decided that he needed to find another roommate.
"Castiel, come on, Castie,l wake up...please." Dean was holding Castiel’s head in his lap, cradling his face. Castiel was still breathing, but the thought of Castiel being badly hurt was too painful for Dean.
They were on their own and were heading in the unknown. It wasn’t the first time the Winchester brothers had been separated. However, for Dean, it was the first time he was hunting with someone other than his brother.
His hand still hidden by the sleeve, he slipped out of his room on tip-toes. Seeing almost nothing in the dark, he tried to find his way to the main door using the wall.
Dean waved goodbye to Castiel from the Impala. Castiel waved back from his own car and smiled at him before starting his car.
Behind him, Castiel looked completely lost. Dean realised that he had probably never stepped foot in a place like this. The crowd, the laughter and shouts coming from everywhere, and the strong smell of alcohol was too much for him.
The next day, Sam found Dean asleep on his couch. The night before, Sam had had to insist that he went to sleep instead of staying at Ella’s bedside.
how Dean would react when he learned that Castiel was a kelpie, or that intruders had kidnapped Sam and he hadn’t done anything?
“We could always escape.” Dean laughed as he helped Castiel hide the weapons in the Impala. “Won’t be my first time.” Dean grabbed his phone to search for the closest mechanic. Once they called the mechanic, Dean waited with Castiel, both of them sitting next to the car.
At the sight of him, the intruders froze. Castiel took advantage of it and kicked one of them with his hoof. Galloping toward the main door, he searched for Sam, but he was nowhere to see.
It was better than hunters, at least. They could be peaceful witches and maybe nothing awful would happen to him.
"The house is selling for rather cheap for its quality." The woman showing Dean and Castiel told them.
"Yes. Thank you.” Castiel grinned up at Dean. “So, what fake job are we pretending to have this time?"
"Right, I remember. My whole body hurts," he said as he stood up. Castiel looked back down at Dean’s lap, seeming to realize something.
Castiel chuckled, remembering Dean talking about how every single ingredient in his lab, his eyes wide open.
"Hm? Oh, yes I'm fine." Castiel went back to looking out of the window. "Why are you doing this for me?" He asked.
The door opened again and Dean had almost jumped off his chair. The women who entered looked exactly like the description. He runs toward her, ignoring Castiel calling his name.
"Whatever, you are going to say next, no I'm not going back inside without you." Dean sighed and slightly shook his head. That was not the first time that happened. And by experience, he knew Castiel won't let this go.
"Nah. Mostly just a bunch of ingredients that are going to be a pain in the ass to find," Dean said, making Castiel chuckle.
At the other end of the corridor, Charlie and Kevin cheered as they saw the event unfold before slowly walking away.
"Ingredients for every occasion. It took me some time to get there." Dean opened another drawer and got out a box of matches.
As Castiel and Dean got out of the police station, Dean spotted Castiel's car, a Lincoln." Is that yours?" he asked, pointing at the car.
"All right." Castiel agreed. With that, Dean led Castiel out of the forest, looking around himself in case of. They arrived quickly and without any problems at Dean's house.
Dean got out of his niece’s room, feeling crushed and exhausted. She had fallen ill, and no one had found a way to heal her. Not even Dean had been successful, even with his knowledge of potions. He had tried many things but was running out of solutions.
Castiel concentrated on the tree's roots, trying to find the source of the sickness, imagining the tree getting better, him (almost kissing Dean).
She stepped back, still as wary as before. Once she finally agreed to come forward, Dean got back on her.
"Here we are." Castiel pointed to the bushes that hid the cave, avoiding Dean's glance. The entrance was a passage hidden between two bushes. Castiel entered first, bowing his head. It was smaller than he remembered.
And for Cas, well, it was his first time hunting at all. He trusted Dean and he knew that he wouldn’t use him as bait at the first occasion. Yet anxiety overwhelmed him. If anyone got hurt or worse, killed, it would be his fault.
"Oh, shut up." Dean pushed Castiel slightly laughing along with him. Every time Dean laughed crow's feet formed around his eyes. To Castiel, it was one of the most beautiful sights he ever witnessed.
Dean rolled his eyes and continued digging. Once Dean finished digging, Castiel threw him the lighter and the salt. Dean burned the skeleton, the ghost reappearing one last time, burning, before disappearing for good.
"It's different from cars and motels." The house had a grand living room with a glass chandelier and stairs leading to a second floor.
“She’s out. Alex leaves the tavern every morning. She only comes back late at night. If you want to talk to her, you’ll have to wait a few hours.”
Dean was watching him, getting annoyed. It was not ideal to stay too long close to someone, but right now Castiel needed help. He had to help him.
"I've run into you lately more than I have anyone else," and the last time we saw each other was two years ago..."
"My tree has been chopped down but Dean replanted it." Dean grabbed Castiel's hand, trying to soothe him when he noticed them shaking.
"Hum, Cas?" Castiel perked up as he heard his name. Suddenly, he realized how close he was to the hunter's face.
"You know what? Cas can explain better what is going on than me. Cas?" Castiel took a deep breath before entering the living room.
As Dean told Castiel the story of how his little brother, Sammy, manage to escape the hairdresser and went back home on his own, Castiel noticed a discreet smell. The smell was barely perceptible and Castiel was having trouble figuring what it was and where it came from. This scent was recomforting and calming, with a hint of sandalwood with spices. And for some reason, it seemed to come from Dean.
With Alex’s help and a bunch of other hunters, they had killed the vampire Alpha. Afterwards, Alex went to live with the other hunters. She had found a home where she could be safe and herself.
"Shit!" Castiel ran towards where the shapeshifter used to be. To his surprise, he realized that someone else, probably a hunter, was already fighting with it.
Sam and Eileen had hundreds of questions to ask them. Meanwhile, Ella wanted to know if the leaves in Castiel's hair could be removed. So she pulled on one of them, hard. Ella apologized for a few minutes, tears in her eyes when she realized she hurt Castiel.
Dean recognized her as Claire, Castiel’s daughter. Castiel and Claire lived across the street from Dean and Ben. They arrived in the neighbourhood three years ago. Like Dean, Castiel was raising his kid on his own. However, no one seemed to know why he was living on his own with his kid. He hadn’t talked about an ex-wife or husband or if he had adopted Claire on his own.
Castiel kept smiling at him. It felt weird to have someone care like that. When Dean took off his shirt, Castiel stared for a second.
“Holy shit! Don’t do that!” Dean shouted. “You are going to make me have a heart attack if you continue.” Where did the dryad come from? He wasn’t there two seconds ago.
It had taken time for Castiel to get over Dean leaving him out of the blue. He’d gone from motel to motel, not going out of the motel out he was staying in.  Castiel almost tried to find Dean a few times.
“I swear, I am.” Dean nodded, hoping the dryad would believe him. The dryad came down the tree and moved toward Dean. He stared at Dean for a few seconds like he was examining him, trying to know if he was being honest or not.
After a few moments of exploring the cave, Dean and Castiel sat down, leaning on the wall. They stayed there next to each other, in silence for a few minutes.
"Dean? Dean, wake up." Someone (murmured), waking Dean up. He was laying, face first, on the ground. A baby gurgled next to him. A baby! His baby! That was enough to fully wake Dean up. He sat down, Castiel was looking at him, a soft smile on his face. He looked exhausted.
“Well, I wasn’t expecting that,” Bobby whispered. “You should ask your brother to talk to him. Anyway, seems like you’re affected by this a lot. How did he touch Dean Winchester’s heart? I thought that was impossible. ”
"Thank you again. I will give back your clothes when I can." Castiel told Dean. Dean nodded at him and waved him goodbye.
Dean went back to Castiel and sat next to him. He could have lost him. He could have lost him so easily. And now with Castiel being pregnant, it was even worse.
“Could you repeat that, slower this time?” Bobby asked, trying to figure out what Dean was telling him.
"No, I know what it is," Dean interrupted him. “You can’t live as long as I have and not have heard of it. But, dude, the Book of Damned is
"Hey, I'm not going anywhere until you get your car back. I mean unless you want me to go." He could stay with Castiel for a few hours.
Because of that, he decided that showing Castiel was a better idea. It’s for that reason that Dean ended up kissing a surprised Castiel. Both of them couldn’t believe what was happening.
Castiel took a deep breath and started his car. The sooner he dealt with it, the better. After driving for a day and a sleepless night, Castiel finally arrived in front of the motel Dean was staying in. He looked at the motel before driving away and drove to the closest dinner. He needed to think about it a bit more.
One of them was unconscious and Cas recognised him as a hunter that had stopped by the house before. One intruder turned his head towards Castiel but didn’t seem to notice him. Castiel closed the door of his room as quietly as possible.
"A little bit. But I barely have any energy." Castiel put his head on Dean's shoulder and closed his eyes.
Castiel was thinking of how to answer when he heard a couple speaking behind them. He managed to hear about weird disappearances in the town.
Castiel was falling asleep, a wrapped gift on his lap, as his parents drove back home. Dean's birthday was coming, and Castiel had dragged his parents to the mall to find the perfect present for Dean. Castiel couldn't wait to offer his gift to Dean and see Dean's smile as he unwraps it.
Better wait in the room and get prepared to defend himself in case of need. If they do hunt him he won't have any chance to survive. But he will refuse to surrender. If he dies, he will die fighting. He had found in Sam's room a small dagger, that he could hide easily in his pocket. A loud banging on the door startled him.
“Why are all of your books about creatures?” Castiel asked out of the blue. Dean hesitated for a few seconds. Was it a good idea to tell him that he and Sam hunt those monsters?
“Did it work?” Sam asked, standing up from his couch when he saw Dean. He had dark circles under his eyes, the result of the long hours he’d stayed awake. Besides Sam, Eileen was looking just as exhausted.
“Dean...Dean...wake up. You have to get back home.” Sam said with a low voice, knowing very well that you shouldn’t wake up Dean by surprise.
It was Dean who opened the door and leaned on it. The hunter stared at his shoes for a bit. He didn't seem to have any weapon on him.
"Cas?" Castiel heard, making him smile and turn around. Castiel ran toward him, his heart beating in his chest.
A week later at the same hour he first saw Dean, Castiel stood in front of his home, waiting for his Dean. Last time he didn't think to ask Dean his address. Now, not knowing how to find Dean, Castiel could only hope that he still wants to play with him.
The hunter lifted his head and looked at Castiel. His blue eyes were filled with worry. “If he is still alive,” he answered as the bartender served them their ale.
“You know what you are, Sam? Too kind.” The older brother looked at Sam, groaning. “All right. But one condition: we always keep an eye on him.”
The sound of a siren rang, breaking the silence inside the car, woke up Castiel. Lights of a fire truck danced on the windows of the car.
A few seconds after stepping out of the passage, Sam took a few steps back. A woman he didn’t know was heading toward them on her horse.
Dean stared at the inscription for a few seconds before it hit him. He was naked when Dean had meet him. Interrogating Cas in his birthday suit under a horse blanket, again, is not on Dean’s bucket list.
“Is he naked?” asked the younger brother while examining Castiel. “Give him some of your clothes before we take him inside.”
But he couldn’t leave Castiel there with no monitoring. One part of himself was telling him that Cas came to see him of his own free will. He wouldn’t need to attack Sam if he wanted to hurt him. Sam trusted him. The other part insisted that Dean would put himself in great danger if he didn’t keep an eye on the creature. The first part won, though he didn’t put his sword away.
"Someone looks happy. Good news?" Dean asked him, grinning. Castiel winced at that; he didn't want to spoil the surprise.
Dean tilted his head slightly, and their lips slotted against each other like lock and key. Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel's waist and pushed him on the couch.
"Dean, we destroyed the book for a reason. There are things in this book that could cause mass destruction and hundreds of other catastrophes."
It didn't take long before Castiel fell asleep again. Dean walked towards his lab, taking one last look at Castiel before entering his lab.
When Dean arrived, he knew immediately that there was a problem. The main door was wide open. They are always cautious about that. The sigil would be useless if they let the door open. You don’t want monsters to enter your home in the middle of the night, after all.
It was late at night when Castiel decided to go to Dean's house. After minutes of walking and getting lost twice, Castiel arrived in front of Dean's house. He looked at the door, his hand lifted ready to knock. Mustering his bravery, Castiel knocked on the door. A sound of a bottle breaking followed
"Dammit." Castiel groaned. "I think it would be wise to take out the weapons first. This would not be the best time to get arrested."
In the seconds that followed, the two men heard Sam shouting in the distance. He had stumbled upon Gabriel and the last time strangers had entered their home, it hadn’t ended well.
"What...you thought I was the kind of guy that would abandon you at the first opportunity?" Dean chuckled but stopped when he saw Castiel's face. He was frowning and seemed slightly annoyed. He sighed. " No, man. I wouldn't have left you on your own. That would have been shitty."
“I am here to see Castiel!” Dean answered with difficulty because of his position. Dean had no idea why she was attacking him. But, he was sure she wasn't going to hesitate to kill him.
They had also changed a few things in the house. Like in the bedroom. They got a new bed and Castiel would alternate between sleeping with Dean and in the tree.
"We'll never be able to buy this. Even if we used fake credit cards." Dean leaned towards Castiel and replied.
" When he entered Dean's house, yesterday, Castiel was overwhelmed by how many things Dean had. At first, he had no idea where to look. But the longer he passed the more he found this habit endearing.
When Castiel got into his car, he sat for several long minutes. He wasn't ready to confront Dean. He didn't know what he was going to say. Maybe he could just print the photos he took and put them under Dean's door with a note. Dean did leave
"I wouldn't get too close if I was you," Castiel told him. But Dean didn't listen to him. The riverside was sloping. Those who didn't know this place often ended up falling in the water. So did Dean. Fortunately, the river wasn't deep.
"No, no, no. This can't be happening." Castiel stood in the middle of the room, not knowing what to do. He saw the note left by Dean.
Silently, he opened his door and took a peek into the corridor. He tried to understand what was happening and if he could help Sam with whatever was attacking him. Suddenly, the noises stopped and six people emerged from Sam’s room.
“Let’s go,” Dean says, walking towards the dining room, not caring if the other man follows his instructions or not. Still not fully awake, Castiel tried to keep up with him. Sam was already there and had obviously been eating long before his brother woke up.
Once he arrived, Dean put the horse in the empty stable. Giddy, he went searching around for Sam. He found him, reading a book as always.
Castiel left the dinner, took a deep breath, and walked towards the motel Dean was staying in. The entire way, Castiel repeated to himself to calm down.
"Who the hell are you?" Castiel asked as he turned on his flashlight to get a better look at the other hunter. Green eyes, a strong jawline, and light brown hair. And somehow vaguely familiar. Like if he saw this face a few times, somewhere. Probably in a bar or roadhouse for hunters.
It was a miracle, one of them was injured but they could get out of there without all three of them being stuck on one horse.
Castiel hurried up to finish the spell as quickly as he could. Dean grabbed his gun and hid behind the door, ready to defend himself and Castiel.
"Personal space?" He immediately jumped away from Dean, blushing. What was happening to him? He was becoming too close to the hunter. In both sense of the term.
After four hours of travelling, Dean had finally showed up at Bobby’s house. It was his and Sam’s second home. When they were kids, they would pass their time here if their father was on a case that was too perilous for them.
Dean blinked at her and smiled before nodding. Right before opening the door he told Ellen, “You should do the same with Bobby.” The healer had never blushed so hard in her entire life.
Castiel and Dean finally got out of the sewer, dirty from head to toe. They had gotten lost in the sewer and walked to find the exit for what felt like a few hours.
"I don't know, but it may be important. Look, we have been waiting for an opportunity to make money for a long time. This may be it."
Balancing two cups of coffee in one hand, Dean opened the door to their motel room with his other hand. As he stepped inside the room he called "Hey, I'm b-" Before Dean could finish his sentence, a gun was pointed towards his face. Dean flinched, dropping one of the cups of coffee and spilling coffee all other his shirt and his plaid.
Dean slightly cut the palm of his hand, then stared at it, waiting. It wasn't healing. It was just bleeding.
Once on Baby, Dean cast a glance at Castiel. He would never forgive himself if the kelpie didn’t wake up.
Castiel was searching for Dean, as much as it felt weird and creepy to do that. Knowing Dean, Castiel knew it wasn't going to be easy. But fortunately for him, Dean had a very recognizable car that he loved too much to get rid of the Impala.
"Nah, you can stay. I like having company." They decided to visit the town. It was a small country town with a little art museum that they decided to check out. They talked for two hours in the museum, which was too long for this small museum and neither of them had any idea what paintings were in there, since, instead of paying attention to the paintings, Dean and Castiel had talked to each other the entire time.
"A branch? Tell me it doesn't come from your tree." He knew that would hurt Castieand he didn't want that to happen. "You know I don't need to use branches from your tree for my potions."
“He said his name’s Castiel. I found him in our stable. Oh, and the horse is gone.” said Dean, enraged, pushing Castiel in front of him.
“Anna is waiting for you over there.” She pointed towards Anna who was sitting next to a tree in the middle of the park, with another little girl.
“I am sorry. I did not think you would come back.” A silence feels between them. “Is your niece better?” The dryad asked.
A few days later, when Dean arrived at the forest, Castiel ran towards him, hiding something behind his back. When he saw what it was, Dean looked at Castiel, confused.
“You looked terrified.” Castiel chuckled as Dean laughed along with him. Indeed, he hadn't expected to end up like this or to stumble on a dryad.
“You know, when father and mother told us that if we were ever caught by a human, we had to get their trust, they didn’t mean that,” Gabriel answered.
"Hello, ready to go see Rowena?” Castiel nodded. Dean got out of bed, helping Castiel to do the same, trying to make a few noises as possible. Dean looked outside the window. Dense fog made it impossible to look further than the house. When he and Castiel got out of the house, the cold hit them.
"Would you like to meet my family?" Dean asked out of the blue, after a few minutes. This question had never crossed Dean's mind before. Somehow, it hadn’t occurred to him.
After approximately one hour of research and not finding much, Dean stood up, tired. He sighed. "I'm going to need a quick walk. I can't concentrate anymore."
Castiel had to hurry up if he didn't want someone else to die and now was the perfect moment. Castiel had finally found the shapeshifter’s hiding place, a sewer.
"Then what was it?" Roy asked him. This had been going for a few minutes now, and Walt just wouldn't stop talking about what he saw.
“Sure. You didn’t hang me by the feet too the first time. Do you have any idea of what we could do?” Dean asked, smiling at him. Castiel smiled in return and told Dean to follow him. He did so, a bit slowly because he fell from the tree. They arrived next to Castiel's tree. Castiel took something from the ground.
"Thanks! I'll go ask my parents!" Castiel ran back inside and hoped his mom and dad were going to say yes. He had no friends in the neighborhood, and Castiel couldn't wait to play with Dean.
"It's okay." Dean nodded. They passed the rest of their time in the cave until Dean had to go back home. When Dean was gone, Castiel went back to his tree and went to sleep, disappointed. What happened in the cave this day was strange. What would have happened if Charlie didn't interrupt them?
Dean and Castiel were walking into a car dealership. They had finally gotten every paper they needed, both real and fake. Castiel was walking behind Dean, pensive.
A few days later, Dean was in town, buying ingredients he needed for his potions. And a pie. Ella was now no longer sick. Therefore, Dean had decided to offer a pie to the dryad. What was better than a pie to thank someone, anyway? He took a cherry pie, hoping that the dryad did eat fruits. He went back to the forest after putting the ingredients he just bought in his home.
With every minute who passed, Castiel was getting more and more nervous. Did he figured everything out? Or at least that he was a monster like he said? Next time he won't follow humans. If there is a next time. At some point, Castiel stood up and put the book away.
Castiel paced, waiting for Dean. Dean couldn't visit him often enough in his opinion. But he knew it was the weekend when Dean came to the forest to visit him. This time, Castiel had something to show him. A place that he and Charlie had found when they were kids. They had found a cave. No one ever came there, except for them.
Dean was pacing in front of Ellen’s house. It had been roughly half an hour since they had gotten there and Castiel was still unconscious.
At least there was no more hesitation around whether Castiel was staying or leaving. In front of him, Dean was glaring at him. Smiling, Castiel threw in the towel and speared a carrot with his fork.
“All right. Just take some of them. Please, be quick.” The dryad sighed. Dean strongly thanked the dryad. While Dean took the leaves, he heard the dryad wincing behind him.
Castiel stayed silent for a moment, staring at the sky. He knew this. They couldn't risk humans discovering that dryads occupied the forest instead of some dangerous creatures. And he couldn't pass as a human. And he couldn't live away from his tree for too long.
Dean continued to try to escape when he realized that both dryads stopped talking. Hester stared at Dean for a few seconds, her eyes narrowed.
Dean saw Castiel shaking next to him. "Let's go back inside." Castiel nodded and Dean helped him stand up. [Inside, Dean found a note written by Charlie.
Dean held out his hand and took some leaves. The next thing he knew, he was upside down, a branch holding his foot. He looked around him, startled. A man appeared in front of him. He had yellow leaves in his dark brown hair and his hands seemed to be made of wood.
"Shit! Castiel!" Dean put Castiel in his bed and tucked him in before running to his garden with the branches from Castiel's tree. Dean already regrew a few trees only a few times before. He tried to remember the exact steps as he prepared the branches. With the help of Charlie Dean replanted those branches.
Dean went back to the Impala, looking at everything in the photo. But, something in the rear mirror got his attention. The same blue car that he’d seen earlier was parked close by. A man was getting out of it, heading towards the entrance of the gas station.
"Someone is hurting my tree." Castiel groaned, trying to stand up. "We have to go back to the forest."
"Wanna help me?" Rowena asked Dean. Dean nodded and sat down next to her. Castiel was half-naked and had blood and slick running down his legs. This was the last thing Dean saw before it all went black.
She was the one finding the victims for the family. Dean and Sam had ganked a vampire not long ago after learning about the vampire alpha’s existence. However, this vampire hadn’t informed them that the alpha could see through the eyes of every other vampire.
During the night, Castiel couldn't sleep at all. The sound of fire trucks was the only thing he was hearing and he could only hope that Dean and his family were safe.
"Let's visit the house?" They walked around the house, seeing the bedrooms, bathroom, and kitchen. Everything was big and shiny.
“Right, like you don’t have a soft spot for Ellen.” Dean made Bobby blush, which rarely happened. Bobby would often pretend to be sick so he could see the healer. She must have noticed a long time ago. Dean suspected that Ellen wasn’t saying anything because she also had a soft spot for him.
“It’s a potion for protection,” Dean told him. The dryad looked at him and the potion back and forth.
"How long have you been cursed?" Castiel didn't know how much of this was true, but something made him want to believe Dean.
The first thing he noticed was the sigil. Someone had destroyed it. He immediately ran into the house, searching for any trace of Sam and Castiel.
"Finally! I searched for this room for way too long." He sighed. At least Castiel wasn't the only one to be late.
Dean shouldn’t have brought Castiel here in the first place. He had never hunted anyone or anything in his life. Castiel had informed him that once, when he was a kid, his father had shown him how he killed humans. Castiel had refused to go with him to any human hunt or to eat humans again. His parents and the rest of his family hadn’t taken it well. Dean knew that.
Dean is in the library, again. He had to know if his doubts on Castiel were founded. Speaking of which Castiel entered the library at this exact moment.
"It has been destroyed." Castiel tried to reassure Dean and put a hand on Dean's arms. "It took us time, but we got rid of it once and for all."
Someone was slightly shaking Dean. He grabbed the arm of the person and twisted it around their back.
“Is it weird that I’m happy that I was hit on the head?” Castiel asked, still dazed by what happened had happened, making Dean chuckle.
They continued to talk about everyday life. Castiel decided not to tell Dean about this newfound smell and tried to forget about it. Unfortunately for him and Dean, Castiel's mom called him back home two hours later. They promised each other to play again as soon as possible.
"Sure. Call me when you're ready." Castiel let Dean lead him to another room, blush the entire time. Dean closed the door behind them to make sure the woman wouldn't hear them.
"Bee. Just... Bee." Castiel said quietly, hoping Dean won't find it weird. He wasn't very good with choosing and inventing names for his characters and plushies. The simplest was often better anyway.
"Right... You have been away a lot lately." Dean froze. He hadn't talked to Sam about Castiel. What was he supposed to say anyway? Hey, this is my boyfriend Castiel, he is a Dryad. Oh, and he might be pregnant! The normal things.
“You won’t say that once you that you tried the pie, that I got you. It’s the best in town.” Dean said as he got the pie out of his bag. Castiel stared at him, eyes squinted and head tilted.
"You're coming?" Dean asked Charlie who nodded in response. Once he had everything, Dean came back running to Castiel. Dean and Charlie helped Cas to stand up and they walked towards Dean's house as quickly as they could.
"Ok, ok, I get it. Let's run away." Dean started the Impala, keeping an eye on the blue car. He saw the other man coming out of the station, realizing that he got tricked.
Castiel smiled back at Dean. "We don't know if I am pregnant now. But if it's the case, I would be happy to have a kid with you."
"Thank you!" The other boy said. But instead of going back to playing, the other boy stayed in front of the fence. He was holding the ball on his chest and stared at his shoes. A few seconds passed, where neither Castiel nor the other boy talked. With every second that passed, Castiel grew more and more uncomfortable. He was about to ask if everything was alright when the other boy spoke.
The last time someone attacked them was a long time ago. And they took a few precautions so that wouldn't happen again.
"Dean?" He called again when he didn't see Dean. He searched around the motel room, calling for Dean. But he quickly realized that he was alone. Castiel grabbed his phone to call Dean just to hear Dean's phone, still in the motel room, ringing.
“So, are you staying or are you leaving?” He looked up and noticed a sigil painted in red on the door.
“I made it. I own a potion shop.” Dean answered, grinning when he saw Castiel’s dumbfounded expression.
"If you ever become a threat in any way or we find out you’ve lied to us, we will hunt you down. And this time, no second chances."
He ran out of his room as soon as he could to find his parents. He found them, (speaking softly) in the corridor.
He moved to the next one and this time there was a voice on the other side. They were speaking about him.
Struggling to keep his cries of pain quiet, the young man looked down at his hand. The skin was red, dry, and sore.
Castiel winced. That wasn't a good start. Castiel waited for Dean to come back, searching for what exactly he was going to say. He sat on Dean's couch right in front of the fireplace. Dean came back, a smile on his face, and sat next to him.
“People in the town say that a monster lives here. From the stories I heard, I thought I would meet a demon or something as dangerous.” Dean answered with a smirk.
To Castiel’s surprise, Dean wrapped an arm around his waist. “I’d like a minute to talk with my husband.”
"Would you want to stay here tonight? It's getting late." Castiel opened and closed his mouth, searching for an answer.
The only person who could help them find Sammy couldn’t come soon enough. The ache was getting stronger and he only knew one way to make it disappear.
"You don't have to! I just had to ask because..." Dean rambled. Castiel chuckled at that. He never saw Dean like this. Usually, Dean was way more confident than that.
"Probably next week." It was always complicated for Dean to watch them go for some time. But he knew it was the best for Castiel and Jack. And he wouldn't trade it for anything.
“There’s someone new in the house and the last time we talked was three months ago. Since then, for a reason I don’t know, he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore,” he said as quickly as possible.
When the week was finally over and Dean could go back to see Castiel, he picked a few books with him. As he arrived in the forest, Dean called for Castiel. He looked around, in case Castiel appeared out of nowhere again.
"We have to hurry." Castiel grabbed Dean's arm, trying to stay on his feet. When they arrived, Dean and Castiel saw a group of men chopping down Castiel's tree.
Suddenly, the door of his room was kicked open. He must have made too much noise and drawn attention. Thankfully, he just had the time to finish his transformation.
Castiel chuckled seeing Dean's face light up."It is a surprise." Castiel smiled at Dean and led him towards his secret place. When they arrived, Castiel realized he had been holding Dean's hand all time. He realized that Dean was staring at their hands too and blushing. Castiel let go of Dean's hand and cleared his throat.
“Here we are,” Dean said as he raised his hand to knock on the door. Right before he could, the door opened and Missouri appeared.
Walt only had the time to take another look through before one of the men closed the shutters. He still saw the men's face. One of them looked like he had left in his hair and his arms strangely looked like wood.
Dean and Castiel had been searching for the spell ingredients for months. For months, they had been hiding from the group of hunters that Castiel had worked with. But now, finally, they had found all of them. They found an abandoned warehouse that was far enough from any populated areas to do the spell.
"Dean, no need to panic." Castiel chuckled. There was a silence, Castiel didn't know what to say. "You remember the cave?" Dean nodded a small blush appearing on his face. "Am I crazy to believe something was going on? I mean between us?" While he was saying all of this, Castiel was avoiding Dean's gaze and picking his clothes.
Castiel winced as Dean didn't say anything. He shouldn't have said that. He tried to pick his clothes quicker. All he wanted now, was to leave.
“No, this makes complete sense. He needed the blanket, which resulted in him spooking the horse,” replied Dean.
Castiel was lying in the bed, again. He couldn’t get out. Even worse, Dean and Sam were probably hunters.
"Sure." Castiel searched for the lever to pop the hood, then got out of his car to look at it with him.
"I found those herbs in the forest. Some are rare." Castiel said, handing the herbs to Dean. Dean stared at him for a few seconds, taking the herbs. Dean did bring gifts to Castiel, but he hadn't expected Castiel to do the same. Dean recognized among other things perilla, mandrake, and some John Charles.
Castiel was laying in his bed. He had been unable to sleep for the last three days. At this point, his family must be organizing a search party. And at this point, he was getting too much attached to the brothers. He couldn't not care. Especially Dean. As much as he tried to avoid him he couldn't stop thinking about him. It became harder and harder to ignore Dean with every day that passed. At least he was gone this morning to see however this Bobby was. He had insisted that Sam finally have a new horse. Especially because of their new case. On the last one, they captured a vampire, who gave them a track on the vampire alpha. Alphas were the first of creatures lineage.
“Awesome!” Dean said like it was the greatest news of his life. “Anyway, did you discover anything new about the case?”
Well, Castiel does know about a short-cut, not that he would ever admit that to Dean. He was still rambling about how Castiel must have cheated until Cas put his snout on Dean’s head to shut him up.
This news felt like a punch in Castiel's guts. He couldn't imagine losing his mom. He couldn't imagine how Dean was feeling right now.
He got out of bed as discreetly as he could, although Castiel laying on him made it more difficult. He had to go. Now. Fortunately, Castiel didn't die yesterday; but because they are hunters, it could happen at any moment. Dean couldn't take seeing one more person he loved dying. He knew he was going to hurt Castiel by leaving, and he didn't like that either, but it was better if he left.
She had been brought to the Alpha and he had asked her to destroy the sigil in exchange for her liberty. Of course, she had accepted the offer as soon as she heard it. As a result, the vampires had entered the Winchester house to kidnap both brothers. Since she did what she was told to do, Alex didn’t have any news about the family that kept her orthe Alpha.
"My tree is starting to blossom!" Castiel told him, a huge smile on his face. "I'm pregnant!" After he registered what he said, Dean laughed and hugged Castiel closer.
“You aren't supposed to drink that.” Dean chuckled. The dryad seemed even more confused. “You pour it around your tree to protect it.”
"I am sorry. But it's not every day that your friend finds himself in the corridors only wearing his boxers." Dean had a hard finishing his sentence as he was shaking with laugher.
Castiel was running down the corridor as fast as he could. His first day of college and he was already late. The corridors didn't seem to have an end. Classroom number 301, 302, 303. Here it is, classroom number 304!
According to Ellen, he wouldn’t  wake up before a few hours but he would heal. Even with the good news, Dean couldn’t stop worrying. What if Castiel woke with no memory or couldn’t speak or walk anymore?
After he had eaten all his fish, half of his bread, and a few vegetables, Castiel asked. “I’m sorry, but can I get back to my room?”
He didn’t know what to do. Was it a harmless idea to go into that room? He should be vigilant, yet these men had let him enter their home and had even given him clothes.
Dean was only mad at him about Sam’s kidnapping for a few minutes. They were finally approaching the village and Castiel was relieved. The torture would soon end. It was the first time Castiel had seen this village.
"I hate this part," Castiel grunted as he looked at the body of the shapeshifter. Especially when it was shapeshifters, they were gross. Whoever thought that skin that could be completely taken off to change form was probably rotting in hell.
"Yeah, I do. A lot." He chuckled. In total they were eight There was Anna, Gabriel, Lucifer, Michael, Raphael, Balthazar and another Hannah. How his parents manage to have that many kids, is still a mystery.
“Sure thing.” He said and nodded, a smile appearing on his face. Castiel returned the smile, and his gaze followed Dean as he got out of the forest. When Dean got out of sight Castiel wandered towards the deepest corner of the forest. He wanted to pay back, Dean.
However,  Dean told him about his parents. How his mother died, burned alive by a demon. How it destroyed, slowly his father. Dean and Sam learning about hunting at a very young age. His father sacrificing himself for Dean.
He could make a potion for the dryad. Maybe one for protection. Dean took a glass jar, some pins, sea salt, a ribbon, and a black candle. He took Dean time and energy to finish the potion, but it was worth it.
Realizing how close he was to Dean's face, Castiel gulped. And according to his expression, Dean had noticed it too. Castiel leaned in slowly and closed his eyes.
"I would love to. But to be fair, I don't know either what to do." Castiel said as he cards his fingers through Dean's hair. "We can wait to do that, you know." Dean nodded at that. "But if you want to do it, then I would love to."
“Time to get off,” Dean announced. Castiel tried to get off of Impala’s back, but unlike the hunter, who got off the horse smoothly, he would have fallen face-first if Dean hadn’t caught him.
They passed the next hour playing football. Next to them, Bee was (laying) on the ground. Dean would comment with a funny voice, on everything that happened, pretending to be Bee. Once they got bored of playing football they laid down in Castiel's garden and passed the time speaking about everything and anything.
The last three months had been odd. Dean couldn’t find out why Castiel was ignoring him after Dean had prompted him to talk. If he wanted Dean to ignore that he was a creature, why now? After assuring Bobby that he was fine, his uncle gave him a look of disbelief. Dean couldn’t hide him anything.
"I searched in that one. What the hell?" Castiel groaned. "You could just have told me where it was," Castiel grumbled as they were putting back the objects. When they were finished, Castiel took a few seconds to look at everything in the room.
"Are you trying to insult me?" Dean asked, laughing even harder before getting splashed in the face by Castiel. They could have continued for hours but every minute that passed the water felt colder and colder. They got out of the river with a few difficulties, their clothes heavy because of the water.
"You're sure you want to buy this house? It has an awful past. And there have been rumors..." the woman looked around her, before continuing "that this house is haunted. A few people have already left the house, terrorized, and never came back."
Like Missouri said, Alex knew a lot of things. She knew what had happened and where Sam was. The young woman had been living near the castle of the Alpha vampire, who lived with a large family of vampires.
Taking advantage of the other men's confusion, Dean grabbed his sword and charged the men. No one could hurt Castiel. Not on his watch.
Dean grinned at him. That was kinda cute. "Castiel, you remember the cop we saw at the police station?" Dean asked, all of the sudden.
"Yes, same here. I used to play around with potions as a kid. I scared my parents more than once." They laughed as they exchanged embarrassing stories of their childhood. From time to time, Dean would look in the direction Castiel and Rowena had gone.
"Charlie, what are you doing here?!" Castiel asked, standing up as fast as he could. The redhead was standing in front of the cave's entrance, her arms crossed.
However, they quickly joined by two other students, Charlie and Kevin. Kevin was in psychology with Dean and Castiel and Charlie, informatics. You would never see Charlie without her computer.
"Nice to meet you too. Castiel told me a lot about you." Charlie said, grinning. Behind Dean, Castiel mouthing at Charlie to shut up.
Three years had passed and it will soon be the end of college. Castiel was weirded by all of this. Those years passed so quickly. But something was bothering him. Dean had been a bit distant lately. Those times Castiel would mostly see Dean in class or at the lunch break. And even then he wouldn't speak much to him. Dean would get out of their dorm as early as possible and get back as late as possible. However, Dean wasn't acting like this with either Kevin or Charlie. As he was thinking about Dean's odd behavior he spotted Dean, Charlie, and Kevin speaking, at the end of the corridor. Castiel immediately turned around and walked in the opposite direction.
"I... I don't know who to tell you this. I am sorry for avoiding you. The year is almost finished and I don't know what will happen to us after college. And because of that, I panicked a bit. It took a lot of time for Charlie and Kevin to convince me to talk to you. Anyway, what I wanted to ask is would you like to go on a date with me?" Dean asked as he was looking at his shoes. For a moment, Castiel didn't know what to say. He was just staring at Dean, processing what he just told him.
Castiel was sitting in the dining room glaring at his bowl. Sam had put fish, bread, and vegetables in it. Vegetables! He’s a carnivore, damn it.
"I warned you," Chuckled Castiel when he saw Dean getting his head out of the water and leaning on the riverside.
"Thank you, Cas. I don't have anything to offer in return. But this means a lot to me. I swear I will take good care of it."
"I know, I know. And I don't want you to come to visit me before you give birth." Rowena told them. Dean and Castiel nodded in sync. They had to admit that she looked slightly scary, her eyes slightly glowing purple as she told them that.
"All right, hang in there. I need to grab something." Dean helped Castiel lean his head on another tree and draped his coat on him. He then ran toward Castiel's tree and cut a few branches from it. Dean heard Cas wince behind him. But he couldn't slow down. They didn't have enough time.
Dean and Castiel drove for two long hours, chatting about things they did during those three years, both carefully avoiding talking about the last day they saw each other.
"No, I don't want to bother you." Charlie headed toward the exit of the cave. Castiel sighed and turned toward Dean.
A year had passed since Dean's house burned down. Dean's birthday was coming around the corner. And Castiel was going to miss his birthday for the second year in a row. And Castiel still had no idea what happened to Dean after the fire, but he didn't want to know any more or even think about it.
"You still need rest, but you will heal. And your kid will be all right." Rowena told Castiel. Her hands and eyes were glowing slightly purple. "Dean helped a lot. I can recognize another witch’s talent when I see one."
They resolved their case thanks to Cas who seem to know a lot about the supernatural world. He had heard about another physic, Missoury Moseley that lived in the village. Cas had begged Sam to come but he had refused. It was too dangerous for him to come. When they arrived at the psychic's home, they found Missouri sitting in a corner, a cup of hydromel in hand as she already knows what would happen.
“Why would anyone steal people’s eyes except for a spell?” He hated witches. Couldn't they just use herbs instead of body parts?
"Hello, yet another crappy motel," Dean said as soon as he stepped into the motel. And now they were sitting in front of a computer, trying to find anything that could help them in this hunt.
"Nice to see you again." Charlie moved next to Dean after managing to knock out one of those men. She grabbed his arm and stopped him. "Go take care of Castiel. He needs you."
Dean Winchester was a moron. He was lying in bed, with Castiel, who had his head on Dean's chest and was still sleeping. He shouldn't have stayed with him. He shouldn't have kissed him, and he shouldn't have gotten in bed with him (they didn't even do anything there, but he still shouldn't have done that).
It took them almost a week to realize that Gabriel had left the nest. Dean couldn’t imagine not having his brother around. In return, Dean told him about his parents, how his mom had died and how his dad had started to hunt with him and Sam.
“Baby, what’s going on?” asked Dean, curious about his horse’s behaviour. “Come on, no need to be afraid.”
"Apologies accepted. You want to come in?" That was the worse idea he ever had. He is an idiot. Dean seemed as shocked as him that Cas made that offer.
There was, in the small town, a market where peddlers were shouting to attract potential customers. Castiel was mesmerized by all that agitation. It was the first time he had been here. It was the first time he had been to any sort of human town. His family had avoided humans as much as they were able.
On their way to the tavern, Dean was telling Cas everything he should know about taverns. The hunter was hoping that they would find this Alex girl as soon as they arrived. They had already lost too much time. The tavern was full and Dean was looking around trying to figure out  if any of the people inside were Alex.
"I should go back to work." Dean sighed as he stood up and stretched. "Do you want to come tonight?"
"It's not the moment for this kind of discussion, Dean." They crouched behind a fallen rack pallet. As much as neither of them had thought they were still followed, they’d still prepared a backup plan.
"Sure. Why not." The hunter closed the door behind him and stepped forward. He stopped in front of Castiel, looking around and playing nervously with his fingers.
He knocked on the door and waited for Bobby to answer. As soon as the other man opened the door, he grinned and pulled Dean into a tight embrace.
“He could have sent a human to destroy the sigil! He could be part of a coven or a werewolf pack. Man, I don’t know, ok? Something about him is just off. I talked to him and  he avoided as many of my questions as he could.”
"Ok, that's creepy. Cas...for the love of God, do something." Hearing that, Castiel snapped out of his trance and shot the ghost again.
"Your names young men?" Asked the teacher. He was a man in his fifties with brown graying short hair and a beard. And if Castiel remembered well his last name was Singer.
"Ok." Dean nodded, not seeming to care about Castiel's choice of name. "Do you want to play football? Bee can be the commentator." Dean proposed.
“I know you are desperate to find Sam but it is not going to work if you’re drunk.” Cas sighed as he put the two glasses on the table. That sentence surprised Dean. Cas had ignored him for three months but he obviously cared for him. He did want to drink, but Castiel was right.
"Not yet. I don't think we're going to find anything until we're on our own." Castiel answered. They had already planned to come back at night. But for now, they needed to know as much as they could about this house, i.e.how to get in and get out as quickly as possible and any supernatural activities that may be present.
"Dean, don't..." Dean and Castiel jumped at the same time as the ghost repeated right in front of Dean.
Dean left, coming back to his house as fast as he could. The moment he was back home, Dean grabbed as many books as he could and started his research for a solution. After hours and a lot of books, the only thing he found that could help was a tree called ginkgo. The leaves were told to have healing properties and could even extend their life span. Fortunately, there was a forest not far from Dean’s house. And Dean knew they were ginkgos in this forest. However, they were a problem. Numerous stories surrounded this forest. Legends said an evil creature was living there. A monster that terrified those who dared to enter its lair. Some people said it was a demon or an evil spirit. And those who saw it always had a different story. Sometimes the creatures were made of wood, sometimes had horns. But one thing that Dean knew was that no one saw it coming.
Castiel took a look at the (corpse's) neck. There was nothing that could indicate a murder."Maybe a ghost?" Castiel proposed.
"We agreed to burn the book. No one should have access to it. It could be a catastrophe. " Castiel nodded, but his phone in his coat pocket had never felt so heavy.
Seeing Dean's face Castiel started laughing. "Sorry. It's just you look like a deer  in the headlights."
Dean's remark took Castiel by surprise. It was rare for people to compliment his name. Most kids found it weird and made fun of him because of it.
What would happen when Dean came back? Getting back to the house was too dangerous in his horse form and he couldn’t come back, naked, in his human form. He didn’t know what would be worse:
Castiel stared at him, trying to figure if he should listen to Dean. He finally put his gun down after a few seconds. It’s not like he had a choice anyway. "First question: I saw a photo of you. An old one. How haven’t you changed and how are you still...alive?"
"Uh, sure. I'm tired and don't know if I could drive safely to my motel. Do you have somewhere I can sleep?"
"You wanna hum... Sit down?" Castiel had no idea what to do. His first plan hadn't work and he just destroyed his second one.
"Yes. But don't worry, this is not the first time someone passed out on me during labor." Rowena said behind them.
"Yes! And you are Castiel?" He said as he reaches out his hand to Castiel. Castiel stared at the hand dumbfoundedly for a few seconds before shaking it. Castiel took a moment to take a closer look at Dean's face. He had deep green eyes, light freckles, and dark blonde hair. Castiel also noticed that Dean was slightly taller than him.
"Sorry." Dean stepped back, but still held Castiel's hands. "I don't know about you but I feel like celebrating this win. And perhaps creates some fake IDs afterward. Maybe a house?"
"I feel like I’ve been trampled by an elephant," Dean said before going into another coughing fit. "I hope the potion is worth it." He grumbled.
“Here? A lot, but not every tree has a dryad attached to it. Our job is to protect the forest and animals living here.” Castiel answered. “And what about you? How did you find that potion?”
Dean entered his lab. The creature seemed to be a dryad, but he had to be sure. The shelves in the room were full of empty jars, potions, books, and many ingredients. Dried plants were hanging from the ceiling, upside down. A vast table at the back of the room had a few objects scattered on it and a small cauldron. Above the table, you could see a colorful and flourishing garden from a window.
"Here you go. Be careful, please." Dean told him as he handed a gun from his glove compartment. Castiel grabbed it and aimed at the wheels of the car behind them.
“Yeah, and you’re a kelpie, right?” Castiel didn’t react for a few seconds, not knowing what to say. “Are you hurt?” Dean continued. “There was blood on the bedroom floor.”
Usually, the small town of Pryston was calm. It was known as a quiet and peaceful place, not a town where weird murders would happen; but that was exactly why Castiel was there.
Dean and Castiel walked slowly towards the figure, their guns pointed at the ghost. The voice called out again. Both of them turned around towards the sound and saw a pale figure in the distance.
Since that afternoon, Baby was nervous. She didn’t trust the other horse. Something about him made her jump out of her skin. Now odd noises were coming from the other stable. She had been watching it, engrossed, expecting something to happen. All of a sudden, a hand grabbed the blanket that was laying down on the top of the door. Rushing, the hand disappeared a few seconds after.
At the mention of his brother, he looked at the tavern’s door, just in case Alex passed it. He had, during the whole evening, kept an eye on it, but nobody had looked like Missouri’s description.
Dean got off his horse and tied the horse’s lead to a tree, then drew his sword and walked toward the house.
“Family,” Castiel answered, still reading the book in front of him. This would be more difficult than Dean had thought.
Dean and Castiel passed the two next hours talking together. Until Castiel bluntly asked if Dean wanted to go on a date. They both stared at each other, surprised. Castiel never thought he would ever be brave enough to ask Dean out. Dean said yes.
"That's what I tried to tell you! If you’d listened to me, it wouldn't have happened!" Castiel shouted. "Why would you even call a ghost that probably murdered people!"
"Want to go grab some food?" Dean asked when it was lunchtime. Castiel nodded and they headed to the nearest restaurant.
"A curse." Dean sighed. "My brother, uncle, and I found a new case: a witch who tried to bring back her son from the dead. And she needed to kill some people to finish the spell. When I stopped her, she got understandably mad. But before we had time to kill her, she cursed me."
“I bought some gifts. I want to apologize for yesterday.” The dryad stared at him, his head tilted. Dean got the potion out of the bag and handed it to him. The dryad took the potion, looking confused.
“I don’t remember,” he said, panicking a bit at the thought of Sam and Dean noticing the lie. Even if I wasn’t his first lie, he was still sweating.
On the first page, a sigil was drawn. It was similar to the one the main door. On the second one, there was a description. When Castiel had read those lines, he cursed. If any creature tried to open something wich had this sigil on it, they hand will burn. If he had left his hand on the window he could have lost it. There are more discrete things than a burned hand. And now Dean was gone.
At that point, he only had one way to get out of this situation: he had to change into his horse form. He undressed as quickly as he could manage.
Back in front of the house, Baby was giving Castiel a hard time. He had untied the harness, but Baby was galloping in a circle. Behind him, Cas was running behind her, trying to catch her.
"Crap. What do we do if he talks to us?" Castiel asked. The two of them were in civilian clothes and his fake FBI card was in Dean's car with the rest of his stuff.
"The hell?" Castiel groaned once when he was in his car. Don't get him wrong, he was used to weird things. Ghosts, witches, and strange deaths were his everyday life. But this was a brand new kind of weird; and now, the more Castiel thought about it, the more his head hurt.
Like a few days before, he found Castiel’s tree again. Something was drawing Dean toward it. Somehow he could recognize this tree among all the others without problems.
“Wait, you wanted to leave? And you stuck around for the food and bed? What conditions do you live in?”
Reluctantly, he left the room and stared at all of the doors in the corridor. Which one are the witches behind? Putting his ear to the door closest to him, he listened for something, anything.
"Would you want to go to my home? I have a fireplace, there." Dean immediately regretted asking, ready to hear Castiel reject him. But instead of that, Castiel stopped what he was doing and blinked at him before smiling.
Irritated by his answer, the hunter stretched out his hand and snatched the blanket away and tossed it. Naked. Naked under a blanket, this Castiel guy was in his stable instead of the horse.
"Sorry for all of that...and for freaking out on you. I didn't expect your death. And even less you coming back to life."
Dean was giving Bobby one last embrace before going back home. He had thought a lot about Bobby’s idea. If asking Sam was the only way to talk to Cas, then Dean would ask him. The only downside was that Sam would never let him forget his feelings for Cas.
They had been staying in another town, Dean helping Castiel to find a new car. The motel room they stayed in was bleak, with two full beds, an archaic television, and a door to what barely passed for a bathroom. The front door had three massive locks on it, which didn't bode well for the security of the town.
"Thinking back on it, your face was hilarious." Dean laughed but stopped immediately when he saw Castiel glaring at him.
"Castiel. We know you have spells from the book of the damned. Whatever it is, it's not worth it. Either you give it to us voluntarily or we'll take it by force." One of the hunters warned him. Not knowing what to do or say, Castiel looked at Dean for help.
"Thank you. I'll see you when the little one comes." Castiel prepared to go back to Dean and Charlie. Rowena put her hand on his shoulder, stopping him and making him Castiel turn around."
"Been a hunter for a while." Dean chuckled. "Alright Castiel, let's get rid of him and get out of here."
After hearing these words, Dean ran as fast as he could, despite Castiel being in the same house as him. Before he could enter the room where Castiel was resting, Ellen grabbed him by the arm.
