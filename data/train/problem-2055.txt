But they say no Heaven (except the real one) is perfect, and there was one black cloud looming over us. Our two cottages were at the end of a row of six, and although three of the other sets of occupants got on well with us, the fourth, a sneering fogman called Geoff Bowen who always scowled whenever he saw us. And when Ted (the Belford stationmaster) pulled us over one day to tell us that Bowen had been making what he called 'hinsinuations' about us, I was worried.

“The general did request my services”, I conceded noting how both young men turned pale at that. “However, having seen how things are I am inclined to deliver him justice. Although maybe not the sort that he is expecting.”
Now I was just being silly!
I had been in the middle of enjoying a well-written rant in the local newspaper about the government’s clamping down on those 'automobile' death-traps – officially-sanctioned number-plates and a twenty miles per hour speed limit both of which seemed fair enough to me – when the Reverend Reuben Carroll arrived. He was a small nondescript fellow of about fifty years of age, clearly quite nervous but also very determined.

My vision returned, and I briefly wondered why he had not come as well. Then I realized that the sneaky little bastard was actually wearing the platinum cock-ring that I had bought for him and which he had had engraved that last time he had had to visit London (seriously, where on earth had he found a jeweller to do

“That was what prompted me to seek out Kitty, which was just as well”, Lady Bradstock said grimly. “It happened at the Hall right in front of Nathaniel. Poor Tom just collapsed in his chair and had to be carried out.”
“Next, Mr. Cooper took up an interest in the local theatrical society and was able to fund the purchase of several items for the group. In particular he secured a false front which ladies wear to give themselves the impression of a larger bust for reasons best known – and definitely best kept – to themselves. This was important as it would play a pivotal role in the transformation of a scrawny young blonde housemaid called Miss Lily Baker into a large, dark-haired older woman called Mrs. Ophelia Bollinger. He was careful there too; there is a real Mrs. Ophelia Bollinger who is indeed a psychic and who lives in Essex.”
Hence a few days later John and I decamped to Paddington Station for the long journey all the way to Penzance at the furthest point west of God's Wonderful Railway; a certain hazel-eyed someone had once very unfairly suggested that I liked this company because they clearly shared my utter lack of modesty! Normally a long train journey anywhere in England (and sometimes even a short one) would have been cause for the sort of activities which would have had a certain English city doctor staggering out of his compartment at the end of his journey in need of a lie-down, but I did not suggest such a thing just now. Instead he just leaned into me and we relaxed as the train set off.

His wife had decided that she liked him to have one of those again fashionable stubbled beards so he now looked even more like a dopey Celtic warrior that someone had dressed in a police uniform, but anyone who had won the confidence of Miss St. Leger had to be a lot more than that. “I was looking into something else and I came across this.

My nephew Jack himself had been ill at the end of last year though mercifully not with the horrible flu, and in one of those ironic twists of Fate which life is apparently fond of throwing at people that illness had brought in the lady who was to help him through the dark days ahead. A nurse called Miss Antonia Belvedere (Toni to her friends) helped my poor nephew through all his travails and I for one was not the least bit surprised when Jack subsequently proposed to her, their marriage taking place on Midsummer's Day.

Sherlock had laid in another selection box of chocolatey goodness from the village sweet-shop, including some of those new nutty Marathon† bars that I liked. It could not be for a celebration as we had had one the other week when his nephew Tantalus's son Carl had been blessed with twin sons, whom he had named Blaze after his grandmother's second and far superior husband, and Christian after an uncle of his wife. So the news had to be bad this time.

It is vitally important that since they wish to tarnish Mr. Leeds, a link is established to the town where the rival works exists. Still in disguise she secures the services of three of Wellingborough's less reputable citizens to attack the man that she is now dating. She knows that the sense of smell, albeit often under-rated, is actually important in the way it makes people think and that it will make her seem more of a man. Unfortunately she rather overdoes things; you might wish to see if there is any of it in her house sergeant, as I think that she would find such a thing hard to explain.”

“It seemed probable”, he said. “Where did it take place?”
Murdered by the Dutch government, whose agents pushed him in front of a train. The unusual aspect in this instance is that he had already been reported as drowned in the loss of the steamer 'Friesland' where the same Dutch government had murdered his sixteen fellow passengers, so his twin brother Elisha was more than a little surprised to see him alive on the up platform of Manningtree Junction Station – but not for long.
“Mr. Troilus is as I have said not the wisest of men”, the lawyer said. “He made the error of telling his father that all this ‘psychic malarkey’ as he called it was utter tripe, and that his brother was as dead as a door-nail. His father did not take it well and retaliated by cutting off all communication with him.”

Tempting though that prospect was – it had been two whole days without sex even if it felt like two whole years – I would not give my brother the satisfaction of a success this late in our relationship. He was already grinding his teeth after Mother had said what she would do to him if anyone ever found out where our cottage was. It had been quite bad of John to suggest writing her an anonymous letter from someone claiming to have heard it from him.
“And?” I pressed.
“I think”, he said, “it would be in your interests to concentrate on the money. Quite clearly five hundred pounds was paid into a bank account and then withdrawn so as to create a link with Derby. Most people do not have that sort of money lying around so someone must have obtained it somehow. The most likely way is a short-term loan; perhaps your colleagues in Derby can go round the local banks and loan sharks to see if anyone has borrowed that sum or something slightly in excess of it recently.”

“You have quite a few family members, Benji”, I said, thinking that I was understating things by a factor of... a lot, “and Luke has appointed some good lawyers to help you. As for spending it, you have all those grandchildren and great-grandchildren still growing up. You should honour my cousin's memory and use his money for them, as he would have wanted. He left it all to you because yes, he loved you. He loved you enough to overcome the pain he felt when you were with someone that you loved better and to always respect that union before his own desires. That, Benji, is true love.”
“In this age of ever larger government, such philanthropy is seemingly becoming a thing of the past”. If that happens, then it will be as grave a loss to our Nation as the retirement of my father's friends, who I hope are enjoying the same peaceful and quiet retirement as my father is now set to. Thank you all.”
Apart from Lieutenant Anderson the others in the picture turned out to be Lieutenants Bellingham, Feilding and Addleford, the last of these being the target of our inquiry. A week passed and although Sherlock did not ostensibly do much with regard to the case I knew that he was up to something. He was receiving regular reports from somebody by telegram each evening and he seemed generally satisfied with their content.
All right, maybe my nephew had a point. From the look of horror on his face he had heard that remark all too clearly – which bearing in mind how much of the world he himself had seen, had to take some doing!

Two days later Sherlock received a photograph in the post along with a note from his brother. He shook his head when he read it.
The following morning our two bags stood ready by the door. While we waited for the cab to arrive we both looked around the rooms that we would probably never see again. Despite the love I felt for the cottage on the downs, I still felt sad at leaving the scene of so many of our adventures.
“Luke spoke to me about something else”, he said, looking at me rather oddly. “He had a message for me from Ginger, concerning your niece Emma-Jane.”
It took me a moment to process that, but when I did it seemed impossible. That rare malady, known colloquially as Royal Bed Disease, sometimes struck the sons of families who had intermarried too closely, such as first cousins marrying each other. But how..... oh no.
“Bad memories”, he said ruefully. “My father did but one thing right in his miserable existence when he married my mother, who was English or at least Scottish. People just think it is that blood resurfacing, and given how terrible he was at the end it is not a subject that many would wish to dwell on, especially as people know that I do not like it. Do you remember meeting Bill and Ben when you came to Rigsby?”
Sherlock said nothing but sat himself down in a chair and focussed his azure gaze on the businessman. Who I was not surprised to see was already sweating.
Thankfully Father and Mother arrived back before Lion had come round so were we able to explain matters to them. They were of course devastated but agreed that some time away would be beneficial for the poor fellow.

One of the Merriman's Bank Robbery gang, he was captured by fellow member Miss Sharon Sannay and, when he refused to tell her where he had hidden the loot, she left him tied up in the bell-tower of Melton Constable Church just before the Sunday bell-ringing, from which the shock killed him. She later draped his body over the buffer-beams of a locomotive with the same name as one of the bells, Vici, to confuse matters.

One thing that I should say here, especially since so many modern historians insist on claiming that Great Britain did not need to get involved in this conflict, is to remind the reader of German ambitions in this war which were later revealed to the world as the September Programme, so-called because it was drafted in that month. While our Nation would not have ostensibly been made to suffer as a losing party in Germany's then seemingly likely victory, Berlin would secure Belgium, cripple France, take that country's imperial possessions to establish an empire to rival our own, and with the new vassal states carved out of its gains from Russia would be poised to take us on on far better terms at a future date.

“Who is it?” John asked.
We were staying down in Eastbourne for a time as the cottage had needed some major repairs undertaken. That summer had been very dry and a crack had appeared in one of the side-walls, necessitating the sort of work that would have made living there very uncomfortable (I was for some reason not allowed to suggest playing 'Let's Traumatize The Construction Workers'). The recent passing of both the Malones had meant that instead of heading to Brighton as we had originally planned we had come here to help sort out their estate on behalf of the Rocklands. Incredibly the voters of the St. Marylebone constituency which lay close to Baker Street had, for reasons that only they would ever know, elected Mrs. Rockland to parliament which she was duly terrori.... setting to rights.

A certain fanatical Irish nationalist recently escaped from a London gaol, and sought a part of the country where he could lie low for a time while having a chance of crossing to his homeland. Having made sure that he was seen in the Liverpool area thus making the authorities think that he was looking to make the crossing there, he came north and worked his way towards Portpatrick, resting here until the hue and cry had died down somewhat.

He said that in the room to the left there were three items; an old prayer-book, an old chair and a painting. There was one each for Simon, Stuart and Solomon respectively; they could either inspect them themselves or they could have experts in to look at them before they made their final decision, which had to be within a week.”
“Miss St. Leger's ever-efficient organization has been finding out rather a lot about that young man for me”, Sherlock said. “Not only did his father provide him with a course of shooting lessons but the fellow also has expensive tastes which not even an actor of his talent's income could not possibly support. His bank account has received several mysterious deposits of late and it may be that with time they can be traced to the country which employed him.”

“Most obligingly her letter this morning gave the address of Lowen's molly-house”, I grinned. “He is waiting there with a dozen of his 'boys', several doses of chloroform and a photographer renowned for being able to develop his work very quickly. We shall be able to confront the woman with evidence of exactly what she was hoping to accuse her husband of doing, visiting a molly-house – and with rather more besides!”
I just rolled my eyes at him.
Fortunately our village station lay not far from my house so we were easily able to drop the doctor off there before racing on ahead; I could see steam from a locomotive at the platform so hopefully a train was due out soon. I doubt my poor old Bertie has ever been driven quite so fast in his life but Mr. Holmes managed to coax great speed out of the beast without using the whip and we were at my parents' house in surprisingly short order. I suppose that I could have asked him just how he knew what he knew, but somehow the time did not seem right.
I nodded.
That spring I read of the final passing of old Colonel Warburton down in Hampshire, and immediately wondered if his mother would now honour her promise and inform our son of his true ancestry. So my son's next letter came as a bolt from the blue; I knew that his mother had herself been ill over the winter but it had been much more serious than I had been led to believe, and she had followed her father-in-law into the hereafter within the month. Worse, she had failed to tell Ivan the truth as she had promised! I felt cheated as if I had somehow 'lost' a son but Ivan remained in contact with me after the events of Northamptonshire and I supposed that at least I was an honorary second father. Even if it was a poor consolation prize.

Unfortunately, it seemed that the gods of luck were not to be on our side. Mr. Battenberg's flight on the twenty-fifth was due to take off at ten o' clock so we had arranged to leave our hotel at a little before nine to be there in case anything happened. But the previous night had seen a tremendous storm sweep through Middlesex and although the day itself dawned bright and sunny, the single road leading up to our hotel was under nearly three foot of water. The only way out was a half-mile walk to a deserted road north of the place from where we had a further half-mile into the nearest village before we could find a cab to take us to the air-base.
After a short journey we reached Savernake (High Level) Station where I gestured to John that we should get out.

It would have been quite shameful of me to feel proud at the wrecked form of my lover limping down the stairs, looking like he had just gone through three consecutive rugby matches (and lost every one). General Sherlock had most definitely made Field-Marshal – three times!
I still did not strut, whatever John said!
Sherlock looked at his watch.
“Those who live by the sword die by it”, Sherlock said softly. “Doubtless he was promised a great reward by whichever country employed him. I almost wish that I could have been there to see him get it.”
Unfortunately our celebrations had consequences.....
“They are talking about a film later this year that will be in colour”, I said. “I wonder how they can do that?”

“I am only two and a half years older than you”, I grumbled. “And why?”
“What is it?” I asked. “Not Bill and Ben?”
The Good Lord may have short-changed me with brains almost as much as he'd done with the looks, but when I'd seen Ned eyeing up the three of us I'd realized that a man who liked other men was looking at two happily married (and, I admit, good-looking) young men. So I'd put two and two together.

Born in 1923, the eldest son of Baron Harry I. Served with distinction in World War Two, he only held the title for some six months before following his father to the grave. His daughter Mary married Christian Holmes II (Tantalus Holmes's great-grandson); their son Shere married John Watson's descendant St. John and they became the Watson-Holmeses.
“Yes”, she said. “How could you know that?”
I had been undertaking what had been an initially interesting case concerning a middle-ranking political figure on behalf of Randall that autumn, which had been dragging on since late September and was now some way past becoming tiresome. This was galling as John and I had been invited to York for the festive season as his brother Stephen had just moved there where he was responsible for running the new offices of his company (I may have helped with that move ever so slightly). John was I knew greatly looking forward to spending Christmas with his brother and his family as well as the further opportunity to explore that ancient city, but as our departure date approached this bothersome case dragged on and on.
“This new relative of mine – as if I do not have more than enough of the things already! – says that the matter concerns him and some of his fellow members of the Bernician Royals Rugby Club”, I said. “He works on the railway so perhaps that may also be relevant. An odd Christian name, Brencis. It sounds foreign.”
“It has been removed”, she said sadly. “I presume that after Holly spoke to Lieutenant Anderson he must have asked for it to be taken down; the photographs either side of it are still there.”
Ah. He kind of had a point there.

I supposed that the three daughters were likely behind young Master Cooper's decision to adopt the Gable name, as he would therefore become the last of the line. And more likely to inherit something.
“The excellent condition of your own teeth states that you do not smoke a pipe”, Sherlock said, “but someone has knocked out old tobacco dregs into a fire and one or two did not quite make it. I take it that your 'friend' is in the habit of collapsing onto the couch in an untidy heap to the detriment of the poor cushion, and the indentations thereon suggest that he does not always rest there unaccompanied. The markings are.... familiar.”
“Miss Woodhouse?” the lieutenant asked, confused. “Is she the friend of that harridan who descended on me in London that time?”
There was something unspoken between the two men but I could not tell what it was. We made our farewells and left.

“Like the new one that you have on”, John smiled.
“But why would a nurse in an Essex sanatorium want to..... 'off' our friend?” I asked.
“Yes”, I smiled. “It was very good of him and Rachael to visit Mother, although perhaps not the best timing as she had just finished one of her stories. 'Family Ties', the one about the brothers who made up a tug-of-war team.”
The general drove my love to Berwick Station from which they would take the train to London. I waved them goodbye then went slowly back into the house. Only then did I break down in tears. Lord, I was a wreck! Sherlock would be ashamed of me if he had known but a long lonely time without the light of my life stretched ahead of me and I did not know how on earth I was going to get through it.
I scowled and hurried out of the rest of my clothes, not helped by his working my erection as I did so. He was already up on the small bench that was the only furniture in this place and clearly ready to impale himself on me.

“He is not here yet”, I said.
Only then did I realize a second impossibility; he was exactly the same as when we had first met in Inverwick over half a century ago. He had not changed much by the last time I had seen him in Suffolk some eighteen years after that, but now he was.... well, he was unchanged after half a century!
“Your turn”, he said, grinning as he raised his legs in the air.
“I shall stop at once”, she promised.
“I am afraid that that was why he chose the site in the first place”, my nephew said. “He is also a vicious anti-Semite and is always claiming that my people are trying to rule the world. The lease on the flat  has nearly a year still to run, and I am not sure that I can hold out that long with things the way they are. Worse, my own boys despite their tender ages are spoiling to get involved – my eldest and namesake has only just turned ten, as you know – and only the fact that their mother rules them with an iron fist is holding them back.”
“Yes, he left for Wiltshire the day before I left.”
“We don't know what, though”, Mr. Bassett-Evans said, frowning. “They wouldn't shake hands with us afterwards, or even talk to us. Our coach went to their dressing-room to ask what the hell had been going on but they threw him out.”
For some reason I was reminded of a small child pleading with an adult. I smiled at the image.
“You planned this!” I said accusingly.
Just days later I may or may not have become a great-grandfather, possibly or possibly not again. My grandson Trelawney's sluttish wife gave birth to a son whom they called James, but my friend Ginger's research showed it to be almost certain that the boy was not his. I monitored the situation from afar and fretted.

“That'd be Ethelbert, Mr. Cowper”, the station-master said unhesitatingly. “He's local and works the semi-fasts from London as far as Leicester. Goes up and down the line several times a day and always catches the last train to his home just outside Leicester. Works every Sunday – you know how some folks won't do that – then usually takes Tuesday off to make up for it. Sound fellow.”
“The rat!” Mr. Bassett-Evans said forcibly. “Dumping our Ned!”
“I have two!”
“But you should”, I pressed. “I know that he is unaware of the fact, but he is your son and you did help save him a few years back. And he knows you as one of his great supporters. He would think it odd if you were not there.”

Yes, that was cynical of me – and as it turned out, absolutely correct as per usual. At the end of August Mrs. Leeds wrote to tell me that his grandfather the colonel had fallen gravely ill and as the outlook was seemingly terminal she asked to wait until he had passed. She did reiterate her promise that she would tell Ivan the truth, and although I did not like the delay I had had little choice but to accept it. Although I still feared the worst.
“Last year my uncle, my father's elder brother Graham, died”, Mr. Jukes went on. “He had always been on at my grandfather to give this place to him before he passed on what with all these new taxes they keep coming up with, or at least to give his own three sons something. Simon, Stuart and Solomon, all in their mid-twenties. Not a brain between them mind, which is why this is all so strange.”

Our visitors when they arrived were well-dressed ladies both in their mid-twenties, although one was clearly much richer than the other judging from the fineness of her apparel. And also pregnant; four to five months I judged. I wondered as to how they were related.
With two other sons and a daughter by this time, the squire had formally disinherited Ivan not knowing of course that the boy was my blood, not his. Even when Anne had given birth to two boys there had been no reconciliation and I had wondered if one of the reasons that Ivan had enlisted might have been in an attempt to regain his father's approval. If so he had failed.

It was the last day of September, barely a week after our return from Eastbourne, when Sherlock received an invitation to a wedding. Normally he would not even have considered going especially as the thing was to take place on Lismore, one of the Hebridean islands in Argyllshire, but without going into details he was not only acquainted with the groom but that gentleman's father had greatly assisted him in one of our cases during the Moriarty years and was now seriously ill. My beloved still offered to decline as of course the invitation was solely for him, but I knew from listening to my patients (I treated people in the village and surrounding area as the nearest doctors were in either Lewes or Eastbourne) as to how easily bitter feuds could be started if Person A’s spouse was invited when Person B’s was not, yet by giving way to everybody the hapless bride and groom might well end up with some five hundred people coming to their great day! Although it would be a sacrifice, I would have to bite the bullet and let my friend go alone.
It was September and Sherlock’s birthday (his seventy-fifth), which meant that he got to pick everything that warm late summer's day. After a long slow and sensual start to the day he decided that he wanted to load up the Charger and head to one of our favourite spots by the nearby River Ouse for a picnic, which he had ordered from one of the great London stores to be delivered to the cottage before lunch-time. And of course there was chocolate!
My visitor nodded.
“I love it when you pout.”
not that predictable. I had only worn the turquoise panties on the off-chance.
1911. Sherlock 'forgets his keys', the duo meet up again with an even more exhausted Mr. Bronn Blackwater, and John becomes a grandfather – but he will likely never know his grandson as such.
For some reason he looked pointedly at Doctor Watson as he said that, and his friend blushed deeply.
“What can we do?” he fretted.
I stared at him. The man was a genius!
“At least you can remember our last moments here with fondness”, he grinned unabashedly. “Or at least remember the fondling. Besides I need to keep you on your toes,
The obvious next thing to do was to visit Mr. Troilus Gable and see if my hypothesis was correct. His impressively large if rather ugly house was called 'Maryvale', I presumed after his wife who Mr. Ireland had told me had been Miss Mary de Vale before her marriage. I knew that Mr. Gable lived there with their two daughters, one still at school and the other one engaged to be married to a local bank manager. The third was training to be a doctor in London, much to the disapproval of both her father and grandfather.
“She did not tell you about me?” Ivan said a little too loudly. I winced.
He really was a devious bastard!
I had forgotten or more likely did not think to recall Sherlock's brother's warning about the seven cases that still lay ahead of us, the last of which might be particularly traumatic for me personally. Instead I looked across at the man that I loved more than life itself and smiled.
I shot him an exasperated look. Seriously, what was the older generation coming to?

“A new King Arthur then”, I sighed. “Maybe he might even have his own Round Table of knights.”

“What do you mean?” he asked.
I thought back to my examination.
“I have seen Mr. Freeman before somewhere or other, and I noted then that he has a slight accent”, Sherlock observed. “Which country does he hail from originally?”
The war was brought home to us rather too vividly when German airships bombed the ports of Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn that January. That the Hun would go after civilians was regrettable but unsurprising; we really were dealing with the lowest of the low. The rain of terror from the skies would continue for over a year as the damn Zeppelins could fly higher than any aeroplane of the time, but by 1916 the development of exploding bullets would bring these behemoths crashing to earth with their murderous crews.

An alibi for the time of the attack, I noted. Although whoever did it must have used hired thugs, so that meant little or northing.
“Aerolites”, Sherlock said. We all looked at him.
“What do you think, doctor?” Mr. Guilford Holmes asked edging past us. “It is basically a 'Johnlock' Museum. Your publishers rented the place off Mrs. Rockland after you moved out and they also took Room Four for someone to keep an eye on the place. Her, ahem, copious family takes up all the other rooms. People want to see where the great Mr. Sherlock Holmes solved all those cases you wrote about; some even pay to spend the night here then come away with a commemorative certificate.”
I had a son. Yet I had not. I could not ruin his life by charging in and taking more than I had been blessed with. He looked at me and smiled.
“Let us hope that the consequences are rather less grave!” Sherlock smiled. “Did you have any luck with tracing that money?”
I glared at him. Was it too late to start considering a divorce?
Then he went down like a sack of potatoes!

“The same thing happened exactly one month later when he was with me on July the twenty-seventh”, Lady Bradstock said. “He was very bad and so convinced he was dying that he told me all about Kitty and James, although of course I already knew. He did not mention the previous attack or I would have come to you then; that is very much like him I am afraid. As with Kitty he was perfectly fine the following morning.”
The war started badly for the Entente, with the British and French armies pushed back and Paris itself coming under bombardment at one point before the Germans were pushed back. But they had clearly been prepared for just such an eventuality, and from the Channel to the Swiss border there appeared the terrible trenches that would ensure the war (on the Western Front, at least) mostly went nowhere for the next three and a half years, while millions of innocent young men died just because the vile Kaiser Bill wanted even more land. War was horrible!
However that warm October day we went there as per usual and found that the nearby farm was up for sale. The owners Mr. and Mrs. Saddleworth told us that they were retiring and had had an offer for the place from some developers.
“Shortly the doctor will be taking this poisonous confectionery back down to Oxford where he will test it at the laboratory, before returning here”, he said. “The chemical in them is in itself relatively harmless. But when combined with a certain other chemical, the result on the person unfortunate enough to imbibe them both and at the same time is dramatic. It involves two things; complete loss of bodily control and rapid hair growth. Though I have not met him I would wager that the earl did not take well to seeing his youngest son struck down in this way.”
“Those damn suffragettes are at it again!” I groused. “All right, they may have helped rid us of the odd bigoted sibling of yours but now they have gone and disrupted the State Opening of Parliament. Why can they not understand that such actions do their cause more harm than good?”
If it really possible to die of sheer mortification, this would surely be it! The Reverend Peters smiled benignly at me.

“Most likely him if he is not careful!” he said to my surprise. “Last year he made the mistake of trying to track down Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson; he had heard somewhere that they were still in England and set himself to find them. He was advised not to pursue the matter and to mend his ways, but he has since been seeking out other people related to or helped by them instead. And now he is going after friends of the two gentlemen, presumably hoping to draw them out in response. I think that it is time he was told to desist.”
“It seems obvious enough”, he said to the evident surprise of all of us. “I assume that Mrs. Start is a person of small build, as is the suddenly accident-prone Mr. Spencer?”

“It came about because of Ruth's brother Drake”, he said. “He has a farm in the Clun Valley near where we were stationed at the time of Scott's disappearance. Their eldest son Derek reached twenty-one recently and came to visit me here just after. He had been having some trouble with some of the local youths who had been teasing him over his hair, so I had some of the boys drop round and put things to rights.”
It was damnable unfair of him to use The Voice on me just then, especially as Nick was right there cleaning the room and rolling his eyes at our usual ridiculousness. My life was so hard.
We only had to wait a short wait for a train at Ongar Station and Lion was visibly nervous the whole time. I could relate, and as the train chuffed towards the capital its slow progress did nothing to ease his worries. At Woodford we were fortunate enough for our compartment to come to a halt opposite a newspaper stand so I stepped out and purchased one. We had only just got underway again when I reached an article that made me gasp.

“The train that I am concerned with would have been the first one from here to Derby on a Sunday morning”, Sherlock said.
“Has something happened to her?” I asked.
“What happened?” he asked.
“I dare say that the fellow that you passed near Guildford might disagree”, smiled someone who was not letting lucky that evening. “I do not think that your gesture quite qualified as an authorized hand signal.”
The trapped brothers looked at each other, clearly confused.
“I still do not know how you can do that”, Mrs. Malone sighed, pouring him another one. “About a month back Miss Michaela Wolferton took a room next door. She is working at some archaeological dig up in Hailsham, Lord alone knows what for.”
I did like Mr. Galahad LeStrade, but as we journeyed back to Baker Street I could not but think of that handsome virile young body and my own sadly ageing one. I had passed fifty-two that year and Sherlock was very unfairly still in his forties. My friend must have known that I was feeling a little down because he said that he wanted to stop to send a telegram on the way home and that he would do so from Trafalgar Square so we could dine at my favourite restaurant there. I loved him for doing something small yet as considerate as that.
“Have you lost something?” I asked.
After twenty-four hours of not being allowed into our garden he finally relented and I followed him out the back only to baulk at what I saw. Our shed was now dark blue and could probably be seen from the main road over a mile away; thankfully it was partly behind the cottage otherwise the villagers would certainly have had something to say about it!

“It ties in with my question as to the superstitious nature of the earl”, Sherlock said with a smile. “Belief in werewolves, especially in country areas, is surprisingly strong even amongst the nobility. The dates of the attacks were the last three Full Moons, and tomorrow night is the next one. I feel sure that Mr. George and Mr. Daniel have lost no time in reminding their father of that fact. Now we will have some coffee, tea and cakes, although the doctor regrettably for him must hasten back to the city of dreaming spires and his tests.”
“How could anyone accidentally make people act like they were drunk?” I asked.
The Adventure Of The Brave Lion
The Charger rolled forward smoothly and just moments later was parked outside a very familiar cottage. We kissed before getting out and went inside, into a perfect copy of our old home down to the bees and the blue shed (complete with its light). Sherlock and John, together forever. It was as it always would be... elementary!

“This peace has had mixed blessings for us”, the monarch explained. “The United States seems to have been more affected by the horrors of the trenches than our own country despite its belated entrance into the conflict.

Our final year in Baker Street was seeming to pass far too slowly, and we limped into a chilly February still far too far away from that wonderful cottage on the Downs. I had not told John one thing as of yet, namely that I had agreed with the owner Mr. Jubal Smith that when his current tenants moved out in April my men would move in and refit the place with lots more rooms specially for us. It would be ideal by the time we reached it at the end of September –
Sherlock nodded.

He yawned far too adorably, and had there not been bacon in the immediate vicinity then that would have had Immediate Consequences.

I sat up in shock which.... so not a good idea. I was sure they heard the shri.... the manly exclamation of surprise down in the village!
“The event concerning my client occurred up to and over the weekend of the fourteenth and the fifteenth”, the lawyer went on. “Without wishing to deviate into technicalities which I find confusing if not incomprehensible, the men at the works were building an auto-mobile powered not by steam as is usual but by this new-fangled diesel engine. I should also say that the technological side of the business is relatively small and consists of precisely three developers, one of whom was Mr. Leeds.”
Poor Mr. West!
“And you never said?” the boy asked incredulously.
“Today!” I said glancing at my watch. “Oh Lord!”
“My brother Sherrinford also gave me a clue that time in East Suffolk when he told me that not all blessings are good ones”, he said. “The name Benedict means blessed. If we are being honest the play was irredeemably atrocious, yet one of the leading young actors of our generation still wished to be in it. That seemed odd. His choice of the relatively untalented Mr. Freeman to play opposite him was also curious, but as the man had a Germanic background that might prove a useful diversion at some point.”
“Is this true?” he demanded.

The meeting with Mr. Lionel Delaware took place in his Wellingborough offices on the following Sunday. In the days leading up to it Sherlock proved that he was as sure-footed as ever in our relationship, never missing a chance to touch me for reassurance and always allowing me to be as close to him as I wanted. I do not know why but the threat to my son made me that much needier than normal, not so much for sex as for simple contact. Thankfully I had Sherlock so that need was more than fulfilled.
See it we did. Lieutenant Anderson’s fears proved less than groundless, and Miss Woodhouse made it clear to his half-brother that his skin colour interested her marginally less than the average July rainfall figures for northern Outer Mongolia. They were married at the end of the following year, emigrated to live near her American friend a few months after that and had their first child in 1906.
“I want money for them!” the woman said quickly.
The Adventure Of Salt And Binegar
I shook my head at him. It was a complete coincidence that we had got a hotel which served excellent breakfasts. I owed Luke for that at least so I might not send Benji that extra-large box of 'supplies' after all. Or I might be generous and settle for just the large box.
I glared at one seriously unfunny retired consulting detective.

Chuffingden is not that far from Lewes as the crow flies, to which small town the railway that serves Berwick runs before continuing on to Brighton or London. Although we loved the cottage dearly there were times when we wished to be away from it for a while, and one of our favourite places to go was the fields to the north of Lewes, where Simon de Montfort had won the great victory that had secured an English parliament.
“Interesting”, Sherlock said as we began walking back to the village. “One might have thought that she would have been keen to catch her father’s killer. But as the police officer on duty you do have the right to insist.”
“My name is Lady Ursula Bradstock”, the finely-dressed lady said, “and this is Miss Katherine Kelley. We have a somewhat unusual case for you, gentlemen, and we hope that you would consider taking it.”

We dispatched the promised telegram to Miss Kelley then took the train back to London. It seemed odd to think that almost exactly thirty years back a fresh-faced young English doctor had been heading in the opposite direction along these same tracks, little knowing either that he was about to meet the love of his life or that it would take full twenty of those thirty years for him to get his head out of his fundament and realize.....

He blushed prettily and I saw the distant smoke of the approaching train. I worried for a few moments but then I saw a carriage drawing quickly into the station forecourt. The train duly arrived and we got on; just as the guard was ready to depart a sharp-faced woman in a black dress hurried out of the ticket-office and boarded a ladies' compartment in the middle of the train. A second-class one, I noted, even if her dress very clearly denoted first. I smiled and sat back, thinking it a pity that we had no time for.... that.
We quickly reached the small cottage by the river. There was no road here, just a rather rickety-looking wooden bridge over the river to a path on the other side that almost immediately passed across the single-track line to Kirkcudbright. Mr. Creighton Dallas was out in his garden repairing a bench; he was a large brown-haired fellow, very solidly built unlike his wiry late brother. He stood up as we approached, regarding us warily as if preparing for battle.

Postscriptum: One day very soon, he did. Mr. James Bigglesworth became arguably Great Britain's most famous fighter ace in the Great War, which against all the odds he somehow survived. The last flight of Captain Henderson, whose plane and body were found not far from Heath Row where we had assisted Queen Molly's niece Miss Ferrers, brought an end to the experimental air-service, but the massively improved planes that emerged from the Great War led to its resumption once that terrible conflict was over. Even if John still shudders at the idea of flying.
Unfortunately, as with many families it was to be the aftermath that proved almost as devastating to our circle. That summer had seen a particularly virulent global influenza, what would later become known as the Spanish Flu (rather unfairly so called because the war had led to a ban on reporting its effects everywhere except neutral Spain). This terrible disease had struck a weakened population just as victory had seemed in sight, and persisted throughout this year afflicting the young and the young adult populations particularly hard. Sherlock's grandson Trelawney saw both the children from his first marriage, succumb; naturally their mother who we had encountered just before the start of the war had abandoned them once she had realized that there was no money to be made out of them, and he had had them brought up by friends of his.

Sherlock and I had cause to visit the capital yet again that August when his sister fell ill. I was horrified to see that some of the trusty old horse-drawn omnibuses had been replaced by new petrol-driven vehicles, which emitted all sorts of noxious fumes as they chugged along barely any faster than what they had replaced (although I suppose that arguably that was better than the 'political promises' that their predecessors left in the road!) . My annoyance at least made Mrs. Thompson laugh and I am pleased to say that she soon recovered.
The Wrecking Of The 'Sophy Anderson'
I was sure that I caught the station staff exchanging money as we left. I considered glaring at them but it would have taken too much effort.
I caught my father's blush at that, and my mother taking his hand. Much as I loved them both, they really were a pair of saps!
He looked utterly confused.
“I would like a quick look”, Sherlock said. “Do not disturb yourself sir; we shall only be a few minutes. Doctor, shall we go?”
“Never mind”, he growled. “I am sure that I can make it
His eldest son and namesake had married last year – just before Stafford's christening which was why I had been in even poorer shape than usual after a double dose of angst on my lover's part – and now they had had their first-born son who, to my great happiness, had been another Luke (it was also the name of the younger Benji's wife's brother, as well as that of my godson out of trap sixteen). Then Bet, who apparently was now trying to kill me, had sent her husband round to me where I had faced the horrible realization that he had twenty children so if they ended up each providing him with twenty grandsons....
two, daddy; I can walk on my own!” - and Johnnie was already asleep bless him, so I looked round for our eldest son.
I nodded. Ivan must have cut his lion's mane recently I noticed, and he looked as miserable as I felt. Sherlock also looked at the photo, frowned for some reason, then turned to the sergeant.
“Let us go to the police-station”, he said. “It is bitterly cold here. Once we are safely in the warm, I have some ideas as to who has committed this crime.”
Outside the station I was concerned to see that the three ruffians had followed us from the restaurant. I wished that I had brought my revolver, now in my bag at the local hotel where we had booked in for the night. To my surprise Sherlock left my side and walked over to them. There was some muted conversation then he returned; the three men hurried away.

All right, my fifth. It was not as if I could marry the coffee-machine; as I had so amply demonstrated when John had said that he could do at least some things that the machine most definitely could not.

A robotic lover that could then help you recover with instant coffee and bacon.... you never knew with technology going the way it was.
In the year which would see the start of National Insurance to pay for those new pensions for the elderly (and 'someone' can stop smirking right this minute damn him!), our happy lives had seemed set to continue. Even if it took me nearly a full week to recover from the ‘celebrations’ that Sherlock had laid on for my sixtieth birthday at the start of that year and it was the twentieth of January before I went down to the village, only to find out that my ex-friends there had been running a book on how long it would be before I was seen again (the vicar won, but I think that was unfair as he must have had a 'tip' from upstairs).
By all rights Ivan should have known that he was my son by now, as it was nine months since his mother Mrs. Leeds had written requesting a delay in informing the young man of his true parentage while his grandfather – not actually his grandfather, I thought sourly – Colonel Warburton struggled with what Ivan's mother had assured me was his final illness. Her last letter had said that the colonel was still losing ground so I had been anxiously preparing myself for the inevitable – and now this!

“I was lucky”, he said. “My time over there was almost up and I was allowed to return early to sort out the estate. I went to Hector and persuaded him to come to England with me.”
Of course my bastard of a lover insisted that I go on one of the new vehicles before we returned to the blessed safety and sanctity of the cottage. It was a horrendous experience that I never wished to repeat again, although he soothed my ruffled feathers with a private compartment all the way back to Sussex and a 'ride' that left me having to sit down at Berwick Station for some time before I could make the great trek out to the cab in the station-yard.

“That ties in with the case”, the lawyer said. “The government periodically funds the development side, but like all governments they expect something in return. Now that the rival office in Derby has produced a vehicle that performs reasonably well it is likely that there will be less money for my client's workplace.”
“Why?” the sergeant asked clearly confused.
I knew to what he was referring, as the Americans had recently and quite foully engineered the overthrown of the Hawaiian monarchy and seized their lands as a new territory. This had given them an important base halfway across the Pacific and there had been subtle pressure from Washington D.C. that they would really appreciate it if the British might end their relationship with nearby Strafford Island. To their credit London had responded with a very firm 'No'.

“He is adamant that they remained locked in the office”, the lawyer said, “although of course that does not preclude copies having been made. Four days later the rival establishment in Derby produced a test vehicle with the exact same improvement that Mr. Leeds had been working on. I am afraid that there is still more. When the police searched his house they found not only a return railway ticket from Wellingborough to Derby for Sunday morning, clipped, but five hundred pounds† in cash.”

He had filled out a little now that he was turned thirty (which given that as a boy he had resembled a broomstick was no bad thing) and become even more handsome, but there was a frown on his face that did not bode well.

Sherlock's influence was called into action again this year, when a nasty little gossip magazine called 'Cooking With Gas', the sort of rubbish that I would certainly never have even glanced at, published a scurrilous article attacking his grandson Lord Trelawney for his part in the war. Incredibly the normally trustworthy 'Times' picked up the article and was vaguely supportive of the claims made against the young man, at least until Sherlock had a letter from one of the top spymasters during the war published. In it he said that of course he could not go into detail but the young man had done sterling service for his Nation that had saved many lives (this was indeed true; as part of his work he had detected a major design flaw in a new type of tank that could have had disastrous consequences had the vehicle gone into production unchecked), and the result was that the horrible rag was forced to close with its few finances being used to help wounded soldiers and their families.

“You know that Blaze came up to London yesterday?” he said.
I looked at him in surprise. Sixty-four now, Sherlock had grown into what one newspaper had rather daringly called recently ‘a silver fox’, the grey and the dark in perfect balance in his always untidy hair making him look positively gorgeous. Whatever the Fates threw at the Watson and Holmes clans, at least I still had him.
“He sounds a most positive addition to your staff”, Sherlock smiled. “Thank you for taking the time to see us today, sir.”
“Later then!” Sherlock grinned.
I may have let out a whimper of happiness judging from the faint quirk to his lips but he ignored me and carried on with his book. I frowned and moved to the side of the bed, kneeling down before starting to kiss his ankle which I knew was one of the spots that turned him on. He shuddered slightly but did not put his book down although I noted there were definite stirrings further up.
Ye Gods he was not wearing any underwear! That was just unfair! I was going to die before I had my cottage!
Sherlock led the way around the edge of the field. He seemed lost in thought.
“That sort of thing happens in the barracks, sirs”, he said, “and I have no mind to it provided it does not interfere in what happens on the battlefield. McCullough, the fellow Ruth did for 'Sir Come-Scribe', he is one and the other fellows accept that; they know he would always have their backs in the field. What they do and who they do it with is their business providing it is not done in my time or affects their jobs; they know me well enough that anyone who behaved like that would be shown the door. I could see the general either having a coronary or being tried for his son's murder – perhaps even mine – if he found out. Scott hurried back to the barracks but of course I was there long before him.”
I was surprised at that, as I could not have imagined the fellow we had met being able to manhandle anything more than a paper tissue. But then perhaps his gawky height counteracted his lack of substance.

Before quitting Baker Street we had made sure that only a few trusted friends and family knew of our new cottage's address.
