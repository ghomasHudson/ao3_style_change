The realisation dawned on the slave's face. "Oh. I...I'm sorry, master. I didn't mean to–." Holmes cleared his throat. John wasn't sure which one of them was more mortified.
John paced in the small room, clenching his fists and fighting the urge to lash out at the slave who still stood in the doorway. Stood! Any normal slave would have been kneeling on the floor the second they became aware their master wasn't pleased with them.
The words, painfully familiar, rang in Sherlock's ears automatically. Repeated by him countless of times to different masters and not once had he believed them. He would never believe them. His purpose, his

slave. And the way you've been behaving, the things you've said —it's unacceptable. I can't let you get away with it. We can't– I can't..."
“You’re my master now, it’s within your rights to name me as you please”, the slave countered, still talking to the window rather than him.
"Killing you won't even be a crime," Hope spat out.
The slave nodded. "Yes, master."
She answered after four rings.
"It's there in my file, isn't it? I'm ill-tempered and bad-mouthed. I'm not a good slave", Holmes snapped.
What Sherlock didn't know was that after the auction was over and all the people had left, Mycroft was returned to their cell alone. The cast around his leg and the general appearance of him had chased away the buyers. As embarrassing as it had been to stand naked on the stage, it had been even worse to have no one bid for him. During all the time he had stood,
"She's agreed to meet me at Regent's Park station."
"Are you alright?" Lestrade asked soon after they were in his car.
"Yes, mistress. I will do as you command," he replied a bit shakily. He was terrified. He was to have sex with this woman, but he hadn't the slightest of an idea how he was supposed to do it right. He would have to ask Hannah.
, he thought as he'd tied the scarf around his neck. "See you tomorrow, John."
John thought about the question for a while before answering. For some reason he didn't want her to cling too much onto the troublemaker part. Already protective over his property.
"Honestly..." John muttered under his breath, steadying himself with the back of the chair. Fucking leg, he hadn't meant to sound
"And this is how you repay me? By publicly humiliating me?"
"You never– You didn't tell me I'm supposed to do that," the slave tried to defend himself without sounding like he was arguing. "You buy the food, so I–"
citizens." His master looked offended by the mere idea of it.
"You aren't going to punish me," the slave eventually stated the obvious as they were getting ready for bed.
"Floor,
Dirty clothes and dirty dishes. This was his life. These were the things he was supposed to care about.
John Watson had never owned a slave in his life. They had a family slave when he and Harry were children, but by the time John had been six years old, her health had rapidly declined from old age and she’d been put down soon after. They never bought another slave. Couldn't afford one, John himself couldn’t afford one once he had moved out. Then he'd joined the army, still unable to afford one, but also entirely unable to maintain one. Not that he had ever really wanted one, not that he thought he should have one. To own a slave would be a life utterly in his hands. And John, given his somewhat...unfortunate history with slaves before the army didn’t feel confident about having such responsibility.
"You think he'd murder his owner? Why?"
"Looks like a card. Slave agency, perhaps?"
lesser beings. Him becoming one didn't change that. He'd spoken long with Stewart, their head slave, about what it would mean for him and Sherlock to be enslaved. If any of their family slaves felt this was justice, then they were doing a fine job hiding it. More than anything, they seemed to pity the brothers. Their yard slave Spruce was enraged that this would happen to the family he had served his entire life.
For the first time during their one sided conversation Holmes seemed alert. "You'd move away from London?"
"I understand," Mrs Spedding assured. "I can see he's very fond of you. Loyalty is a good quality in a slave. Telling him sooner would've caused unnecessary stress for him."
Holmes sighed exasperatedly. "That's the name she uses, yes. And she's
"Explain yourself", he managed to order with relative calm, "and make it good. I might not own a whip, but I have belts."
Sherlock's fingers curled around his knees and he prepared to explain when John knelt down, and he couldn't help but to raise his head to look at his master. John took an advantage of it and clutched his chin firmly, turning Sherlock's face towards the light. Sherlock let him. He loathed when people did this –this insufferable act of dominance and ownership. He expected to be slapped any second now and steeled himself for the punishment to come. John's eyes studied Sherlock's face, and the angry line between his eyes only grew.
John sighed, but followed the man outside and down the street in silence for a while. His limp slowed him down and made it hard for him to keep up with Holmes who constantly found himself several paces ahead, stopped to wait or skipped back to his master restlessly.
Yelling, shoving, threats and violence. And nothing else to do but to submit to it, to beg for forgiveness.
She flinched and oohed again when someone kicked the front door twice. John's brows drew together and he flexed his fingers.

sell him?
John nearly choked on his tea.
"I wasn't planning on calling Anthea, either," John assured the slave. Or whatever her real name was. He had discreetly compared Anthea's number to the one the woman in the black car had given him. It wasn't same. M didn't seem to be connected to Holmes's brother after all.
"I was an army doctor. Of course I've euthanised slaves."
"Come on, off with those wet clothes. Don't you want to get warm?"
"I can't relax! This room is driving me mad, I can feel my braincells die, one by one! I need to get out!" he'd groaned.
"Couldn't sleep," Sherlock admitted. "No reason."
Donovan's jaw dropped and Anderson turned to look at her over his shoulder. They exchanged a quick look before Anderson turned back to Holmes. "Look, whatever you're implying–"
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. He really, really did not want to talk about this. Not with Mycroft, not with anyone. "I know."
"It's because yours doesn't have a photo," Holmes said. "Look at all the others. They all have photos."
"Well maybe if you accepted–"
"I'm not exactly a perfect slave, am I?"
here likes you. What does it matter, it's never stopped you before."
. The stigma still existed, faded as it was because it hadn't been re-tattooed since his previous owner bought him. Even the stigma meant little now, but he would have preferred the familiar code to being nothing. His collar labeled him as No. 38, but it wasn't his name. He didn't have a name here.

did you just do?" Ryan bellowed.
She looked at him pointedly, like a person who dealt with similar situations on daily basis. ”Yes. Also helps that there are no previous ownership records in the national database.”
"My fan again?"
Holmes had dinner at ready when he finally did find the energy, if not will, to return. The slave still did not set a place for himself before John explicitly told him to do so. At least he looked better rested than in the morning.
"I know chemistry and anatomy", Holmes stated, then half a second later decided to explain: "I used to work at a morgue."
"Almost done," Holmes announced. He turned on his heels to go back, but quickly turned around again. "How was your day, master?"
"I, uh... Yes. I'll take it."
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” he suddenly asked when the cab pulled back into the forenoon traffic.
He was probably coming back then. Hopefully. Still, Holmes had left the flat without his master's consent, apparently without any acceptable reason.
"No," John said instantly. "Not that."
He knew he was being inconsistent, and that it must have confused Holmes. Treating him as a human being made him feel like a human being, but he wasn't. It was just so easy to forget at times.
Holmes narrowed his eyes. "I don't know. Ask my first mistress, she chose it."
"She might have just lost it. Or maybe she left it at home. Maybe she doesn't even have a phone."
"I see?" John repeated. "That's all?"
"And here you are... Risking your life, just to kill strangers," he thought out loud. Jeff Hope's eyes averted and more pieces came together. The picture was almost complete. Only few missing pieces remained. But he'd get there.
"Upstairs," John cut him off with a stern order. "I will deal with this first."
"I didn't mean it literally!" John felt an odd need to defend himself even though Holmes wasn't really accusing him. And even if he was, he had no right to.

"I will do whatever I want with you, Holmes."
"Yes, mistress."
Lydia sighed. She walked to the sofa and picked a woollen blanket that lay over the backrest. She returned to his side, crouched down and wrapped it around his naked body, letting her arms stay around him.
Jeff Hope realised something had changed. He looked down just as the gunshot echoed through the room, loud and ringing in Sherlock's ears. Jeff Hope fell on his back, and Sherlock knelt down, frozen to the spot.
Sherlock stopped struggling instantly. Sandy let go and he ran to hug his friend. "I'm sorry," he sobbed quietly into the dog's ear. "It's all my fault."
," Hope boasted. Sherlock snorted.
Hannah came to him while master and mistress prepared for bed.
Truthfully, sending him to the bathroom had been just an excuse to get the slave out of the room while he changed into an old t-shirt and trousers he'd been using an pyjamas ever since his return to London. He really had no idea what to do with Holmes's bed. He didn't have any extra pillows or blankets, not to mention, a mattress, but despite the knowledge he was rummaging through his stuff when Holmes returned.
"Yes. Yes, I would."
"He's just acting, he knows what he's doing."
"Hey, hey, hey, easy..!" Hands steadied him and prevented him from moving.
John started to make his way back home, stopping only to buy some essentials. More shopping would require Holmes to carry the bags. As he was paying, something very strange happened. He could swear that for a moment, instead of his total, the cash register read HELLO JOHN.
Sherlock nodded.
have any say in this? He's my property, in case you hadn't noticed. And in case
Greg Lestrade watched him walk away to his new owner. He approached slowly, head slightly inclined to look at least a little apologetic. Greg didn't believe for a second that was how Sherlock truly felt. He stayed to watch far enough to not hear what was spoken, but close enough to intervene should he be needed. He fully understood of course that Dr Watson would be having some words and more with his slave. Had Greg been in his place, he would've disciplined Sherlock, too. He was a great help to the police and what he did was truly unique, but he was still a slave and a damn nuisance of a slave.
"Part of the pension" he explained. "I've got an army pension now."
John did as requested and Holmes typed it down.
Blood and brains all over the burning hot tarmac. Scrub, scrub, scrub. The smell makes him nauseous. It's still with him when he tries to sleep. It's under his nails.
At this point is was common to begin to address one’s master directly. John waited whether Holmes would do that, or continue disrespecting him and distancing himself by still speaking of his master as a third person. Holmes drew a breath and his eyes moved to look at him as it was customary when starting to speak the oath directly to one's owner. His lips moved exaggeratedly as he forced himself to continue and the words to come out clear and as calm as he could manage.
John searched the upper floor, then ran back down, skipping steps as he did. He pushed the front door open, shoulder first and strode towards the twin building when a noise that haunted his dreams pierced the air. He lunged towards the nearest cover, but even as he did he realised he wasn't the target. The sound seemed to have come from the back of the college.
The slave sighed, but turned around and kowtowed. "I'm deeply sorry, master."
"Behave," John scolded, elbowing the man lightly. "And don't touch my computer."
"I miss Redbeard."
For reasons unknown, John felt defensive. "What's wrong with a male?"
He ran and he ran until he came to the evident, horrifying conclusion: he had nowhere but his mistress and master to go to.
"Sorry, murder charge?"
"What about it?" he asked irritably, but despite himself crouched down to have a closer look.
"Good. Face the wall."
Holmes merely shrugged, bringing the tips of his fingers closer to his chin.
," he replied frantically, pulling himself to sit on the bed. "Sherlock, whatever you do, you
"Say, you and your brother," he started. Sherlock sighed inwardly, having hoped they were past the subject already. "You don't see each other very often, do you?"
"Holmes..." John cringed, but no one seemed to care. Holmes wanted to know where the victim was and Lestrade was all too keen to show him upstairs to it.
"Really, do you think
He couldn't have returned even if he had wanted to. He couldn't remember where he'd come from. It didn't matter. He would never go back.
"There's Luxembourg and New Zealand, too."
"Nothing? Really? Shall I just call him back down and ask for his version?"
It was hard not to imagine what would happen to them after the auction. He himself was fortunate to be old enough to be sold as a regular house slave. The idea of tending to someone like an old lady with an army of little dogs revolted him, but it'd be better than the remote chance of being sold to sex industry. His calm and polite manners should ensure him house slavery. It was the best option for him. His overweight build thankfully wasn't what most people looked for in a bed slave. What he was far more concerned about was Sherlock.
Clearly just running at the first opportunity was not the way –and his poor bottom had been smacked so many times that the soreness would not go away. His eyes were puffy from crying and he was bruised from fighting against his punishments. He needed a better plan. He needed to leave at night when no one would be there to catch him in the act.
was his immediate response. No. He knew what John wanted.
He drew a breath and continued a little more respectfully: "Punish me when this is over, but until then,
Sherlock shook his head slowly. The bridge of his nose ached with dull pain, as did his eye. It would fade.
"Are you any good?" the master inquired.
Her gaze swept over him, assessing him. She didn't stop smiling her gentle smile. "I know this is all new to you. I know you've just become a slave."
”Uh, yes”, John replied and limped through the door the slave kept opened for him. ”I'm here to collect a slave.”
John didn't need to say anything. The look on his face was all the confirmation Holmes needed.
Holmes's eyes bore into him, as if he was determined not to look away. "
The slave shivered in his wet clothes and backed away from the door when the two men forced their way past John into the corridor.
The slave paused when the DI touched his shoulder. "Yes?"
He was still angry in the morning as he poked his slave awake. Not as angry as he'd been the previous night, and he did feel bad about overreacting. But Holmes deserved it, he reasoned. In fact it was long due considering he'd only resorted to physical discipline once before last night. It had certainly not been an easy first week with his new slave.
"Did you–? How? If you've–"
Holmes moaned, but shrugged off the coat, undid his scarf, unbuttoned his shirt and threw it on the floor as he got up on his feet.
"I'm happy you came back, Holmes," Lydia murmured and kissed his hair as he swallowed back tears from his punishment. Gradually she allowed him to move more freely. He could go out given he would return and behaved well. The better he behaved the more privileges he gained.
The child slaves were ushered to hall C where their feet were chained to the floor next to makeshift walls that divided the hall into orderly paths. Documents matching the numbers on his wrist were pinned on the wall behind him and he was ordered to let go of his bag. He didn't need to give it away, just leave it untouched next to him.
"W-what"? The word slipped out of his mouth accidentally and he regretted it the moment he said it.
"Holmes," John repeated more determinedly.
"It doesn't matter" he said, stood up and walked to the wall opposite that had become his bedroom. "I'm just a slave, after all."
For a moment he had no idea where he was. His eyes darted to search for anything familiar and he swallowed the lump in his throat as the disorientation started to fade. John Watson's flat. His latest master slept peacefully and comfortably in his bed on the other side of the room.
"And a fine slave you got," Angelo mused, fingers digging into Holmes's shoulders. The slave shifted uneasily, but didn't try to pull away.
"Well, you're more than qualified", the interviewer had said, but John had immediately noticed something off with his tone. Sure enough, he had continued: "Officially I should keep you waiting at least until tomorrow, but I think it's fair to tell you right now that it's a no."
"Shut up, I'm updating", Holmes snapped, eyes still closed.
"Well," his brother spoke. "It's certainly an improvement to your previous lodgings. Could use a bit tiding up, but if this is how your owner prefers it..."
Sherlock closed his eyes. Mycroft's nagging voice in his mind reminded him of how John was a decent owner.
Holmes waved his hand dismissively. "It wouldn't. What my previous owners used me for is their private business and not recorded by InS or anyone else."
"Well..." John began uneasily. Right now? Holmes didn't really deserve to be freed, now did he? And he still needed his slave.
"It's a game. It's genius! I know how people think."
“You’ve got to wait for the next bus that takes slaves”, the driver explained. “Or your slave can follow you later. But this is non-slave turn.”
"S.H.?" John questioned.
Sherlock huffed dryly. He hadn't energy left to argue. Instead he asked: "What about you? Are you alright?"
"He'll take it", Holmes assured her.
"I'm sorry," his master offered after a while of uncomfortable silence.
He knew he should not have. It would take him long to get there. He knew he had no right to, he knew his owners would be furious, but he
"No, sorry. Nothing I can do. I can't hire a guy with PTSD."
"I know, I got fat", Mike joked good-humouredly.
The single word carried heavy regret.
Daddy died before he was cut out of the car. When the midnight came, the horizon was lit by fireworks.
It didn't.
"Look, I know I was angry last night and lost my temper, but I'm not going hurt you for cleaning the loo", John reassured, gesturing with his arm. The room was cleaner than the day he moved in. "God, you've really been doing this all night... What even took you so long?"
"I just went for a walk,
Sherlock fetched his own share of the breakfast. "Our parents died and we had no place to go."
"I'm sorry, John. I'll remember that next time," Holmes promised calmly. "Anything else I can do for you, master?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn't, but John nodded anyway. He wouldn't be taking his orders back, not tonight. "Yes. But not before you've apologised."
"What? What are they gonna do?" Sherlock asked frantically, eyes wide in alarm.
"Doctor Watson, answer me. Can you see it?"
The woman was well-dressed in black and looked tall even sitting down. She had a round, playful face all business, long blonde hair and manicured fingernails that typed something on the phone she was carrying. She didn't look dangerous, but it was clear which one of them had the control.
consider that a chore."
"Not really. I knew to expect you."
"Get out, Mycroft," Sherlock barked, jumping to his feet. This wasn't a conversation he wanted to have. "My master doesn't want you here."
"Yes", came a monotone reply from the bed. "A previous owner of mine needed a driver."
"I assure you he is very obedient. He won't cause you any trouble. Isn't that right, Holmes?"
"Because of Florida?" John asked, but the slave had no chance to reply as at the same moment the car's door opened again and a woman stepped outside. Still not the one from before. She had long, dark brown hair, beautiful tanned skin, brown eyes, full lips... She was absolutely stunning in a word.
"But you
Sherlock nodded and stayed as he was. "Yes, mistress."
(See the end of the chapter for
Billy gave the door a wary look but nodded. John waited until he heard the door to Mrs Hudson's flat close. Someone kicked the door again.
"Fair enough," John shrugged. "Some tea would be nice."
The room felt different that night. It took John a few seconds to figure out why. The unpacked boxes from the floor had disappeared, and John's books that had been there were neatly arranged in the mostly empty bookshelf. Previously only some of either Mrs Hudson's or some previous tenant's books had been the only ones there. Or perhaps some of them had belonged to the late Mr Hudson.
"And that appeals to you?" John questioned dubiously.
But he kept his thoughts to himself. He didn't want to add to his slave's bad mood, nor did he want to worry him. In any case, M hadn't made any further attempts to contact him. Hopefully moving to Baker Street would permanently get them off his back.
have something in common after all. He looked at the bottles.
Holmes had considerably calmed down since the morning. When John opened the door and stepped in, he found his property lying on his back in the middle of the room, arms and legs spread so that his body took all the floor space. His eyes were open, but he didn't stir or seem to notice John's presence until he leant over him and lowered the shopping bag gently on his stomach.
"Does it hurt?" John asked.
an escape attempt. You don't need to buy me a collar, I'm not going to escape", Holmes said irritably. "I shouldn't have left the flat, yes, but I came back. Isn't that enough of a proof?"
She re-crossed her legs and her eyebrow rose questioningly, but she remembered what he was talking about before asking out loud. "You went to get the slave?"
EDIT: I once said to someone in the comments, but I probably should say it here, too: "Things will get worse before they get better, and then they'll get worse again before getting better." Things have now gone worse. They've only known each other for a few weeks by the end of this chapter. Slow build.
He tried to look at it like mistress had said. The best way he could now serve them was to be sold to a new owner. He loved his current owners, didn't he? It was his duty to serve them the best he could. He wanted to serve them, didn't he? He was worth 25,000 pounds. Like mistress had said, he should be proud of himself. He should be happy.
"A hundred and twenty at least," Holmes corrected. "Relax, nothing happened. And if it ever does, I'm not going to stop you from punishing me. I'll even work to get your money back if you want me to."
"Tragically you cannot because you're not
"And now you've seen how I'm doing. Why are you still here?"
"Come on, Mr Holmes. This is the best bit!"
"What the
But it was still several hours before it. He didn't want to go back to the flat, so he walked an hour aimlessly before deciding he could as well go see if he'd find whatever it was a new slave owner might need. He hadn't been an owner for more than a day, but he was already seeing the city differently. Most buses had an internationally known black stick-man on white background with a red collar around the neck, and an X over it, indicating no slaves were allowed to step on. Some taxis had it, too. A few shops, restaurants and buildings also had the slave banning sticker on their doors, banks and cash machines most notably. He saw many stickers with an added stick-man.
"I know people," Holmes offered a vague explanation. "What does it matter, we are solving a murder! More people than Jennifer Wilson and the others will die unless we catch the killer."
"Who is it?"
discipline you. Is that understood?"
"Not necessarily. I just want to scare him."
Sherlock sat at the back of the ambulance, orange blanket draped around his shoulders for a long time. He would've much rather returned to the scene of crime, but had firmly been ordered to stay put until Lestrade would have time to talk with him. Sally paid him a brief visit to ask what had happened and to inform him his owner had been contacted. Several others came in small groups with camera phones and took pictures of him.
"Fair point," John admitted. "Still, maybe she forgot it."
John scoffed. "I wasn't that drunk."
"I'm alright with it if you are. You're the one who's going to die here."
that this is your fault?"
EDIT: people seem to agree with me. I'm glad about that. But I added a little "warning" at the notes of the first chapter. Feel free to suggest tags, too, if you think something should be tagged.
John eyed the documents, still not really caring enough to fully read them, still thinking he ought to cancel this and scribbled his name at the bottom. She signed them as well, added an official looking purple InS stamp on them and enclosed the other one to the archives at the back wall, and the other together with the slave’s file.
John extended his arm and beckoned with his fingers. He wasn't angry, not really. He was just doing what he was expected to do. Sherlock pursed his lips, but obeyed the wordless order and fetched the rattan cane. John didn't even bother getting up. He hit Sherlock's thighs once through trousers and gave the cane back for him to put away.
"Better. What are you then?"
"Somewhere nice and quiet."
Holmes's face fell as if he only now remembered his position. His entire posture changed from that of full confidence into a submissive one that made him look smaller than he really was, and reluctantly he returned from the doorway to John's side.
"A fourth
"Mistress please, please don't sell me. You're my ninth owner. No one will buy me."
His uneasiness changed into something of agony. "Anderson doesn't like me."
John wasn't like that. He couldn't afford to lose a master like John.
"See? You wouldn't. I don't blame you. If our roles were reversed, had I always been free, I wouldn't give a toss about your rights, either. I'd use you and I wouldn't care if you got hurt."
John wasn't sure whether Holmes's reaction was a deep nod or a half arsed bow, but he went to the bed and fell down on it like a log. John surfed the web for the news and weather for another half an hour before closing the laptop into the drawer with his illegal firearm. As far as he could tell, Holmes hadn't moved an inch.
The slave scoffed as if he'd offended him. "Of course."
John blinked, opening and closing his mouth a few times before finding words again. "Did you just tell me to shut up?"
"Like you said, I dragged you out to a crime scene against your will. Two people were killed tonight. Bit different from euthanising a slave. Most people wouldn't approve." He looked down at his master's face, examining it for a slightest twitch of a muscle, but John's expression remained the same.
"Sherlock, please, listen. Don't try to be clever. You
"Wait. So you think...the murderer has her phone? Why?"
"I'm not," Holmes interrupted him. "I wouldn't sign that contract even if I could."
Holmes groaned irritably. "Oh, please."
"And that's were you went wrong," she firmly stated. "Let's try again, shall we? Hello there, child."
"Hunny said you requested me, mistress," he greeted upon entering the living room.
"What is? Is he here?"
The slave shrugged nonchalantly. "What did he want?"
There had been slaves at the kindergarten and the schools he went, there were slaves at the university and there certainly were slaves in the army to “keep company” to the soldiers. But never had he owned a slave of his own.
Despite the work wasn't the same each day, the days still blended into an endless loop of hard, physical work and too little time to rest. There was nothing here but work and sleep. Each day had him waiting nothing but the sweet unconsciousness and the few hours of break that would always end too soon. But there was no tomorrow here. No next week, no next month, no next year. The future didn't exist, for if he thought of the days he still had ahead of him, he would not get through today.
by a man named John Watson."
"Yes, mistress."
The ambulance had just arrived. As Jeff Hope was far beyond their help, the staff seemed annoyed that the only person they were needed for was in fact not a person at all. They talked to him, checked him for injuries and concluded he wasn't injected with anything lethal and it would be for the best just to wait it to wear off. There was nothing uncommon about a slave and a panic attack, and people tended to treat them as mild inconveniences. Sherlock would rather not have even mentioned it, but the police slave did. As expected, he was only told to get himself together. They wrapped him up with a blanket, offered him hot water with sugar and then left him waiting.
"I know," Mycroft sighed. He wasn't feeling exactly entertained himself, either.
Sherlock shook his head. His thoughts were much clearer now, but he felt exhausted. "I threw a glass of white wine on my face."
John raised his eyebrows sceptically at the claim that someone would like him, but, speak of the devil, the said man arrived to their table, arms spread wide in a friendly gesture. "Holmes! My favourite slave."
Because I
"I meant to cook pasta, but I burnt the spaghetti", the man on the floor replied. "Master", he added quickly. When John said nothing, the slave continued to explain himself: "The cereals were just a quick fix, I didn't have time to start over. There's sauce, though it might have gone a bit cold..."
"Come, get up," John said, helping him up and pulling a kitchen chair for him. "Have some tea."
"Just to keep in touch with peop–", Holmes snapped, then quickly cut himself off. He finished with a correction: "other slaves."
"Oh, he is," Lydia confirmed. "Down, Holmes."
was the natural way for Holmes to behave.
The pile of newspapers, adverts and magazines that had taken most of the space on the sitting room's table were gone. The room in general seemed far more orderly than when he left in the morning.
Holmes hesitated a moment before replying, then probably realised the hesitation alone was enough of an answer. "Yes."
"No you don't."
Although Holmes would have probably been more than happy to run an errand if it meant he'd get to roam around London freely.
"He's bit of a troublemaker", he grunted.
"I've played four times and I'm still alive and kicking. You're not playing the numbers, you're playing
John shook his head amusedly. "Brilliant."
Even so, he explained the case for John. At first the young woman's death seemed as baffling as Lestrade had made it sound. Then Holmes pointed out the obvious detail no one else had even thought to question. With the right questions asked the boyfriend's, the original suspect's, alibi made little sense.
"No," Holmes moaned. "I don't–, I didn't–"
"Oh, don't be so prude. There's nothing wrong with it. You are not my first owner to enjoy pornography", he dismissed. Better they watched porn than made him perform. "And likely not the last."
"Baker Street. Short walk from Baker Street Station."
This time the slap hurt even worse.
“What?” John blurted. Behind him the slave stepped out and the alarm silenced. Of course, he'd forgotten that most buses didn’t take slaves. In his defense, it wasn’t something he had ever needed to think about before. And he hadn’t been in London for a long time. Too bad the slave had an ID chip, otherwise they might have got away with this as long as the slave had kept his left wrist hidden.
His brother's fingers gripped the umbrella tighter and he shook his head slightly, but refused to argue any further with him.
"Don't worry, Holmes," she said, stroking his jawline with her thumb. "I'll take good care f you. You have nothing to fear."
"You'd be happier if you did," his master pointed out. "Because like it or not, you are. What you do –it's...amazing. I've said it before and you are, you're brilliant. But it won't change the fact that you are a slave.
are going, master. I need you get me on the Tube at least."
"I'll make sure
He cleared his throat. "Alright. Let's see that crime scene. I'll deal with him later. I'm not having him waste any more of your time than he already has."
He bowed again, and with a last meaningful glance at Holmes the slave walked out of the flat. Holmes himself was left irritated.
"M?" he repeated hesitantly and turned to face his master. "No, doesn't ring a bell."
"Good. So then you'll understand if I'm slightly...curious."
"Of what?" John startled. He had been watching and listening carefully, but was unprepared to be asked for an opinion. His slave smirked and pointed out he was doctor, so obviously the body.
The man himself however panicked, shouted for help again and slapped hard Sherlock's left cheek to keep him awake. "God dammit, Sherlock, you're not dying in my arms. Come on, stay with me!"
Holmes sagged against the wall a little more at each strike. He tried to keep quiet, so each cry and yelp of pain came suppressed between grit teeth. Anger washed over John. It took him over, all the frustration from the past few days controlled his arms. He was only distantly aware of shrieks of pain he drew out of his slave.
desperate. It had been so long since anyone had treated him truly as their equal. As a human being. Even if it were a from the mouth of a serial killer, he'd take it.
Sherlock remembered accompanying Mycroft to the local branch of InS to plead for their case. The office was cold and grey like the weather outside. The man they talked to was much the same.
He swallowed as he saw one of Anderson's underlings spot his gloves.
"Doctor John Watson", the man stepping out of the car greeted. He was tall, considerably taller than John was, dressed in what was perhaps the most well-tailored piece of clothing he'd ever seen on anyone. In his hand the man held a black umbrella and for a moment he leant on it very much in the same fashion John often leant on his cane. The man's face wore a pleasant smile, but despite of it something about him was exceedingly off-putting.
Once they realised Sherlock was silently sobbing, it made the matters even worse. So much so that eventually Mummy reached out to slap her husband.
magazine published by InS and something called
"Fine. But I'm still thinking about the collar. Why did you say 'technically'?"
"No reason at all," he replied, bowed and disappeared into to kitchen, his bare arse and back red from the beating. John watched him fill the kettle through the window between the two rooms. He had plenty of time to change into pyjamas and sit at the edge of the bed until Holmes returned with a mug of steaming tea. He accepted it, trying his hardest to act casual with the naked slave standing in front of him, crotch very much in the line of his sight. He sipped the tea, ignoring Holmes the best he could.
For a moment, John was at loss of words. What did she know about his slave? How did Holmes know these people? He tucked the questions away for later and corrected her: "No. InS gave him."
"You'd be the first", he told bluntly.
John let go and Holmes's gaze sunk back to the floor. He clapped his hands slowly in a mocking applause. "Well done. Just one more thing."
No, absolutely not, he dismissed immediately. He would not even consider it. There were no loop holes in slavery. The laws had been perfected with hundreds of years of history. Yet people argued the laws as they were today were way too loose. He would not let any false hope seep into his heart. Whatever Mycroft's plan was, it would not include his legal freedom. He would never be freed of the stigma. He would always be a slave.
The slave said nothing and kept his eyes cast down, clearly bracing himself to be beaten. John sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "What the hell happened?"
"Do you know what they do to escapees?" Lydia Marlowe asked him that day.
“It comes with a standard ID chip on the left arm. It has a GPS tracker that can be accessed online. I’ll enclose your log-in information for our online services with the contracts. It’s covered by the basic insurance automatically. However, in this case I would

admit you are anything but loyal. A slave was supposed to love its owners. Disloyalty, showing any kind of resentment towards one's owner was punishable.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, and I don't want to. Stop this car and let me out. This isn't negotiable, the slave's not for sale!"
“Good. But, just because it is my job to remind you: six meals a week is the minimum. There’s more information about the exact calories on the pamphlet. Causing permanent injuries is forbidden and a slave must be allowed a reasonable amount of sleep. Again, the pamphlet has some ideas of discipline. An injured or ill slave must be allowed enough time to recover. After all, a healthy slave is a useful slave”, she recited like she was trying to sell toothpaste on TV. Even her enthusiastic smile with a row of whitened teeth matched the image in his head.
"You can learn to like it," he'd been told by slaves and free people alike. They weren't completely wrong. He could often enjoy the physical aspect of it. It could feel good, but that was just his body's natural way of reacting. He could act and pretend, but he couldn't
Holmes looked away. "He was put down. Our master said he wouldn't pay for his treatment. It would've been inhumane to kick him out of the hospital with his injuries."
"He'll take it", Holmes repeated, efficiently cutting him off.
"I'm not implying anything", Holmes assured innocently, walking past him and up the stairs to the front door. "Surely she just was in the area and offered to substitute."
. I would've thought you just", he shrugged and waved his hand nonchalantly, "line them up and shoot them in the head."
"You recently acquired a slave" the man stated instead, stepping closer and looking down to him. John would have been offended hadn't it dawned to him that with such an enormous collar the man probably wasn't even able to bow down his head very much. The slave noticed him staring the collar and tilted his head so that the metal around his throat was jabbing his chin while he spoke: "Have you found him satisfactory?"
when it came to Holmes. He started over: "What happened? Were your parents in financial trouble or..?"
As he waited, John dug out Holmes's file and
"Master Watson. Forgive me for intruding, but seeing my brother was unable to step outside, I let myself in," he spoke, bowing deeply. Holmes sat on the edge of the bed and said nothing.
Pretend or not, Holmes remained obedient and silent, so John decided to use his time by starting to arrange his slave a commuting pass, and a right to carry and earn money. Though naturally any money he might earn would belong to John.
Sherlock smiled, too. How good it felt to be doing this again –say out loud what he thought and
make that happen.
There were two reasons for why he didn’t want to use the tube. First was that the nearest station to his flat wasn’t exactly near, not when you had to use a cane with a sometimes painful limp. The second was the slave.
"So, you're still at Bart's then?" he inquired more out of politeness than actual interest.
"Er, yeah. Got him about a week ago."
Sherlock didn't understand at all what he'd done wrong, not even when Mycroft crouched down to his level in an empty corridor and explained. Mummy found them some forty minutes later. "Get your coats, boys. We're going home. Your father's already left to get the car."
And right now John Watson was the only thing that stood between him and near certain execution.
"Sherlock, I thought you were dead!" Mycroft snapped at him. He glared at his brother, then slowly regained his composure. "I didn't expect you to survive, much less ever be back in London."
But the fact remained he had technically already been put on the death row once. There would be no second chances. Should John give him back and should no one buy him...InS would deem him waste of money to feed until the next big auction day. It would be entirely possible they'd decide he wasn't even worth the paper work for one more auction. In that case he'd be lucky to be killed in the InS basement. He'd rather a quick death by lethal injection than be subjected to medical research. And even if someone did buy him, he knew it would not last. With nine past owners, no it'd be ten past owners, and the record he had he knew it would only give him a year or two more at best. Just seeing the scars on his back turned away most potential buyers. He'd known it when mistress Summers decided to sell him, and knowing how hard it would be for him to be sold, he had begged for her not to do it.
He decided to ignore it and limped away. He was only two streets away from home when it happened again. He paused briefly, but walked on. The ringing stopped when it became clear he wasn't answering it.
"But what if it was?"
"Undoubtedly", Sherlock agreed. "Almost fourteen months. But just little over a week with master Watson."
"Sherlock," he eventually said as calmly as he could. "Tomorrow when you're being sold–"
A shiver ran through him as the distorted voice called him by his name. It was impossible to determine whether the voice belonged to a man or a woman. He straightened his back. "Who are you?"
The fractious mood stuck with the slave for the rest of the day. He seemed to once again be testing his master's nerves, but John was determined to not be affected by it.
To this day, Greg had no idea what had triggered it, but one moment everything was perfectly alright –the next he heard Sherlock screaming and the slave was on the ground, his owner viciously kicking him. His owner had been so violent, so enraged it took both him and Anderson to drag the man away from Sherlock.
John nearly choked on his beer. It shouldn't have been that funny, but for some reason it was, and before he knew it, he was laughing. He couldn't remember the last time he had laughed like this. To his surprise, the slave joined in after a moment.
"You could try," the cabbie laughed. "You wouldn't even make it out of this room. Either you play or I choose for you and force it down your throat."
"Ah, here he is," Lydia Marlowe called happily. "Come, bring it here. Leave the tray on the table."
"Yes, I'm aware. It's unfortunate that we learnt he'd been brought back to the country just recently."
"I'm at your mercy, master", he pledged quietly, before turning away.
Holmes got up and followed his limping master to the door, closing it behind him. When John came back after twenty-five minutes, the slave sat at the table, eating what apparently was what had remained edible of the pasta. At his arrival the slave swiftly got up to help him with the jacket once again, took the plastic bag and hurried to clear the table.
"Shit. Shit, you broke my arm?!" he cried in alarm.
"Nevertheless", John said firmly, determined not to let Holmes's feelings affect him. He was a slave. His feelings, while John did care for them, did not matter on this subject. "It's not like you were just thrown into it, right? They must have asked around for remaining family members."
Technically John could have whacked man with his cane for being clever with him, but he just handed the slave his letter. ”I've got this.”
, it said. He'd never paid any attention to these before.
"How do you even know this person?" John couldn't help but to ask after they had located each other again at the barriers and emerged to the street. As a slave, Holmes had been travelling in a different car. "You said you helped her."
What else did upset people want?
"We haven't bedded him, no. He turned sixteen this January."
He didn't care. All that mattered now was to know who the woman was. It didn't matter he was a slave and she wasn't. The pull for her and the yearning for something familiar were all he could think of, and in that moment there was nothing more important in the world than figuring out who this person was and to hear her speak again.
. A fucking year of near picture perfect slave and then his mistress sold him because she grew bored of him?
"Thank you, mistress", Sherlock sighed in relief. He took her hand with his own shaky one to kiss her knuckles like it was done back home. A formal apology. It felt like the right thing to do, despite that the old him would have never done so willingly. As strange as it was, it felt infinitely good to touch someone like this. Here he never touched another human being. The only times anyone ever touched him were to hurt him.
"I'd have been more useful inside than sitting here," Sherlock grumbled.
Perhaps rewarding him for good behaviour was actually working. At least the manageable behaviour continued. John still left him unattended for several hours each day, unable to spend all day within four walls with him. There were no new escape attempts, he had checked. In fact, his slave behaved so well that when on Thursday night John walked out of the bathroom, he couldn't help but to gape at his slave for a moment before picking up his jaw.
John swallowed hard and blinked at the sight before him.
"You are whatever
"I think we can agree you've done enough for one night", he said. "Did you– is that
"What game?"
Mrs Spedding turned her eyes back on the young man on the floor. Sherlock cast down his eyes. It wasn't polite to stare at free people.
"Before my previous owner", Holmes explained, "I had been sold to Florida. Her husband owned the company that owned me. He was sentenced to death and I helped with that."
The owner and Donovan had had an outright screaming competition when the man insisted Sherlock was his property and he could discipline him the way he felt was needed. Sally screamed back at him how he was way overdoing it, how his form of discipline was verging on illegal.
"No, but it was still my fault. We forced him and the roof was my idea."
"Where do you think you're going?"
"No, no, it's all part of the plan," Angelo assured. "Holmes
Why now, why after nearly twenty years? Why John Watson? What was there about this crippled army doctor that made him even consider submitting to slavery ever again?
John closed the door behind them without a word and moved past the men to stand between them and his property.
Mycroft sat down and waited, both hoping and dreading for Sherlock to be brought back as well, but it soon became evident that his brother had been sold. He lay on the bed, realisation hitting hard that he might never see Sherlock again. He could only hope his brother's buyers were good people, and that Sherlock had listened to his advice. But at least he had been bought. He supposed, in his position, it was the best possible birthday present he could expect.
"Easy for you to say. You might be a slave, but you've still got slaves to command. The hardest task around the house you have is to sleep with your mistress," he scorned. "Not that
"I'm none of your business!" Sherlock snarled.
"I believe that's none of your business."
Greg watched Sherlock converse with his master. The man had every right to be angry with his property, but he wished Dr Watson to be reasonable with his discipline. Sherlock, over the course of time he'd known him, seemed to have an unfortunate trait of attracting violent masters. Violent within the law mostly, but still violent.
The woman pursed her lips at his reply and without a warning slapped him across his face. Sherlock yelped in surprise. It stung, but he would not cry. His eyes darted around the room. He saw the slave look at him with pity.
Sherlock didn't sleep. As soon as he heard the doctor's breathing pattern turn into that of sleep, he straightened his legs and turned to lie on his back. He didn't even entertain the possibility of sneaking out tonight when he didn't yet know how heavy or light sleeper his new owner was. He wasn't feeling especially energetic, but neither did he feel tired. He had napped on the bed quite a while and if there was anything to do at the holding centre, it was sleeping.
Despite the traffic, John could hear someone running to the door before it was flung open. A young boy, twelve or thirteen of age, flustered with excitement stood at the threshold.
The slave was already putting on a coat. "He should, he's the one who gave it to me."
"Where's the milk?"
said the title.
money for him?"
"No."
The cabbie groaned in pain and Sherlock's attention was back on him.
"Well done!" she cheered and ruffled his hair. "I'm sure we'll get along very well. Tell me your name."
Never trust a free man.
"Slaves?" Lestrade prompted.
"Tenth? Last time we met it was seventh."
Jeff Hope looked at him, thinking. Judging. He leant back on his chair and shook his head slowly. "Nah. You're not him."
The conversation moved on. He learnt that Mike was now a married man with children. They exchanged phone numbers and John agreed to see him again some time over a pint. Mike promised to ask around Bart's if there were any vacancies or need for a substitute.
"No, I need–"
"What did you request, then?" John asked as Holmes stopped at a black door next to a sandwich bar.
Holmes stood up and bowed. "Thank you,
"I wouldn't know about people," Holmes evaded.
"Well, you
John whistled. Six years was a long time, considering that out of the twenty-something years he'd been enslaved he'd been missing for three years and owned by nine different people.
"Don't be. It's nothing to do with you."
"I don't think she's interested in you," Holmes said, ignoring the fact that John was talking over him: "What do you mean "the most dangerous person"? That woman? Anthea?"
Lestrade sighed exaggeratedly, but dug his pockets for a replacement phone to make a memo. Sherlock watched his fingers tap the tiny keyboard.
“Please read the file carefully. And I can’t stress enough how important it is that you read the slave rights and laws that concern you as a private slave owner. You can always give a call to our service number in case something comes up.”
Never. Never, the 12-year-old him thought. No matter what happened, he would never find himself on the other side of that window. He would never have his blood stain those white tiles.
"Please, I don't want to be sold," Sherlock begged. Somewhere at the back of his mind, he was aware that he was near hyperventilating and that he should calm down. "Don't send me away, mistress. I beg you, mistress, don't do this. Please, I love it here, I love you..! Please."
“99OR-79/3J3A”, she read from a small tablet’s screen without bothering to look at him. “Change immediately and follow me. You’re leaving.” She clearly had already gone through his file for she added: “
"I was," he admitted, but didn't elaborate further. It only served to increase John's curiosity.
"Wash the dishes, make the bed and do some general cleaning around here while I'm gone. The first two I expect you to do every day. You can sleep on the bed if you want. I'll be back around the same time as yesterday."
"Honestly..." his master muttered, accepting the mug. He set it aside. "You're slipping. I talked with Mrs Hudson the other day, and Billy's the age where he starts rebelling and you should be an example. She shouldn't need to deal with that."
Sherlock had no love for his seventh owner. Master Singh was a sadistic man who enjoyed tormenting his slaves.
“No tendencies for falling ill and naturally it has passed all our health checks and its vaccinations are in order. Would you like to have a look at the teeth? Prostate? Erection?” she offered, picking up a box of disposable latex gloves from the shelf.
He went to see mattresses, but cringed at their price. Maybe some other day. He probably couldn't even get one home by himself and couldn't afford to have it brought in a van. He hadn't been in London for long and already his finances were running low. At this rate he'd have to move out of London within a few months. He really needed a job if he wished to stay, the army pension wasn't even nearly enough to sustain living here.
"Right... Anderson, keep everyone away, Donovan return to your post", Lestrade repeated. "Doctor Watson, this way, please."
Holmes had been completely impossible ever since getting up. He had performed all his daily morning tasks, but as if each of them had personally offended him. He'd paced the small flat frustratedly, groaned in irritation when John had ordered the man to sit down and eat his damn breakfast. Holmes had obeyed, but soon started drumming the table with his fingers. He'd told him to stop which had led in Holmes ranting how being closed within four walls was slowly killing him mentally and how John as free man couldn't possibly understand what it was like for him, being a slave and having a brain in which the thoughts raced liked F1 cars, having a mind like an engine that would explode if not used properly. At this point John had ordered him to shut up unless he wanted John to discipline him again. It was disturbing how eager Holmes had looked for a second.
"Sex with your owner is a privilege and in fact quite pleasant," Mycroft all but lectured calmly. "Speaking of which,
As for the countries that have abolished slavery in this alternate universe, I picked them up because all of them were in the top on several different freedom, democracy and equality indexes I spent way too much time on reading. Plus I need at least Norway to be there. For reasons.
John must have known that Sherlock could perfectly well hear him, were it in shower or at night in his bed. Especially those few times online porn had been involved. But again, Sherlock was only a slave. It didn't matter what he saw or heard. After the first few weeks of insecurity about a slave around at all times, John now seemed to feel at ease with his presence. He didn't necessarily order him out of the room when he changed clothes. After a shower he didn't feel the need to hurry covering himself with a towel.
"You know...you should've just told me."
was evidence, too. "I don't have any other gloves," he added quietly.
have you freed."
This time John laughed. "Consult?
"Sorry mate, I'm off duty."
"I am Sherlock Holmes."
, too?"
But Mycroft knew it was all in vain. He didn't care for himself much at this point, but if he could just spare Sherlock from the life of slavery... He himself hardly deserved anything better. He'd never seen anything wrong with slavery. All his life he'd looked down on slaves, thought of them as lesser beings. It had never crossed his mind it could happen to him. He didn't feel guilty for how he'd treated them or for how he'd seen them. This changed nothing. Slavery was still needed and slaves
"Yes, I know." She didn't take the offered handshake and John let his hand drop awkwardly.
"Oh..." His shoulders slumped. "Yes. Yes, of course. I'm sorry. I'll find you new business as soon as the bruise fades. Just...don't worry. I'll get the money."
"Sherlock, your brother's here to see you."
would be allowed to take it from him.
"And you aren't?" John muttered before repeating: "Archenemy? That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard all day. Besides, if that's true, why would Holmes want to meet you? Why do you want to meet him, anyway?"
", Holmes confirmed with utter confidence.
“No, that’s not what I– Afghanistan...”
While Sherlock had never even seen the man, he knew the company –and he himself were owned by a man named Hudson. His eyes widened in horror with the realisation and he dropped on his knees instantly.
He turned to look away, angry for his own thoughts betraying him so, but the feeling refused to leave him. He managed to dose off for a while, partly awake, yet dreaming of needles in his arms. Of ones that granted him bliss, and of ones that would bring him death. He stirred awake around four in the morning, when doctor Watson started moving restlessly in his sleep. Soon Sherlock could hear him whimper and it didn't take long from that for the man to thrash awake violently, left arm darting quickly as if to fend against some unseen enemy. He held it there for ten seconds or so, until he remembered where he was.
"Interesting."
There were no good memories from The Oyster House. Near naked, crouching on all fours on a table surrounded by laughing, giggling women. Spanked for each bad quality of the groom for marital happiness, milked for long lasting sex life and many kids to come. But it wasn't the worst thing he'd done or that had been done to him at The Oyster House.
Sherlock didn't move, but huffed an angry reply: "I won't be a slave!"
"None of them left notes."
”That should pretty much cover it, but a copy of the actual slave rights act is with the papers you receive. I suggest you read it carefully. Your slave’s ID is 99OR-79/3J3A. I'll print out its papers and you can give these”, she began, handing him the said slave rights act, the newest copy of monthly
“You are correct, sir”, he said quietly, bowing down his head.
"I don't suppose you have anything that could be used to make a bed?" he inquired.
"No it's not," John exclaimed in outrage. "It's an extremely kind gesture from the owner. A slave, even a freed one, doesn't have anything. They wouldn't have a place to go and hardly any means to function in the society as a person. An owner who frees a slave must take it as a protégé for years to come. That's why most emancipated slaves marry their owner."
"Yours?"
Holmes regarded the room with a confused expression before meeting his eyes. "Yes."
"Because I said no."
"Listen now, " John grunted, pressing him against the wall, pushing hard against his windpipe. "I'm a soldier–"
Sherlock tore his eyes away and turned sharply back at Lestrade. "Anyway. It's late," he declared. "And my master's there. I should check on him."
He had unsuccessfully tried to encourage his department to purchase Sherlock after his violent owner had been given a twelve-year slave keeping ban, but by the time Greg had been ready to buy the man himself, he'd already been sold elsewhere. He hadn't seen or heard from Sherlock for over four years before now. He'd tried asking at InS, but they hadn't been willing to give him any information other than that the item he was looking for was no longer on sale. All he had got out of the receptionist after a lot of pestering and asking if he could at least be notified if Sherlock would be sold again had been a dry laughter: "I can't tell you were it's been sold, but one thing's for sure..! It's not coming back."
"The plate is older than I am," he pointed out. He pushed a piece of the wall that was actually a well hidden slave cupboard's door and dumped the case in. Many old houses still had cupboards that had to be opened with a key and could be locked, but thankfully Mrs Hudson had cared about the safety of the slave of her future tenant's when she'd decided to renovate the flat. Nowadays the recommendation was that a slave should never be locked in a cupboard. In case of fire the slave rarely was the first thing people thought of saving, and many slaves had died unable to get out. People still did it, but numerous fire safety campaigns had reduced the amount of slave deaths.
John inwardly grimaced at the description. Most people referred to slaves as him or her when their sex was clear, but there were always those who preferred “it”. She obviously had the slave's paperwork on her screen, so she fell into the latter category. But perhaps it came with the line of work.
"No, I wouldn't have cared. He could be dead for all I care," Holmes replied with bitter anger. "But it's the official reason. A twelve-year slave keeping ban is better than a prison sentence."
John’s first reaction was irritation for being interrupted, but as the slave kept speaking in an endless flow of words, seemingly without stopping to breathe at all, John couldn’t helped but to listen in awe. Once he stopped, John stared at him and he stared back with unwavering blue eyes.
"No! You can't do this to me! You can't!"
"Alright, I will", John promised, though he had no idea what he would do. He hadn't yet physically disciplined Holmes, not properly, and he hadn't bought any kind of tools for such purpose, although perhaps he ought to buy a rattan cane. Maybe even a shocker. He didn't approve collar shockers, those things were inhumane, but a wristband or an anklet would probably come in hand if Holmes truly was anything like his official papers described him to be. Stupid, stupid to be lulled into believing Holmes's good behaviour would last. He should have realised the slave was toying with him. He wanted to know what his slave had been hoping to achieve by logging onto his laptop, but almost dreaded to ask.
The box smelled of chips and there was someone's number scribbled on the window with words "for hot wet pussy" over it. And the phone kept ringing as he tentatively reached for it.
Eyes fluttered closed for a second, chin tipped down. A shrug. "Fine. It's going fine."
"Thanks, but that was my idea, too. I know we were just kids, but it was stupid. I should've known better."
"Just someone who's noticed you."
Sherlock had allowed himself to be pushed on the bed, but when the husband and wife pinned him down and tried to undress him something primeval –no. Something
"Where do you go from there? The park?"
The slaved smiled humourlessly. "
John Watson wasn't any different from his previous masters. Feign submission, act eager to please, beg a little. Really, it was easy. To John's credit, he
"No. They died", Holmes replied. If the subject made him feel anything in particular, his voice or manners were not revealing it.
"What's with your brother's, er, his collar?" he asked instead of pursuing the topic of his slaves original name. "It's… Well it's enormous."
, a silent voice at the back of his mind suggested, but John dismissed the idea. Holmes's ID-chip had led him here.
John looked him silently for several seconds, then shook his head. "Are you done?"
"Not yet, no. Unfortunately I'm very well informed of your situation. Which is exactly why you shouldn't waste this."
Ms Bruce all but rolled her eyes. “Personally, I don't understand why anyone would free a born-a-slave, or even a class C slave like this one here”, she huffed. “They can’t adapt to the society. They only become a burden for the real, tax paying people like us.”
in my life had a slave talk back to me like this."
Sherlock woke up into the silent room. His heart was racing, blood rushing in his ears. For a moment it was the only sound he heard before he started registering the sounds of traffic from the streets, the noise the refrigerator made and the steady breathing of his owner across the room.
"Child's play," Holmes dismissed, but clearly he was pleased with himself.
"What?" John yelped, but Holmes was already waving them a taxi.
A lone taxi stood parked at the front. The numbers matched. It was the same car that had taken Holmes. The police weren't here yet.
Once they were out and the door had been closed behind them, the guard shoved him a black duffle bag containing all his possessions. Sherlock threw it over his shoulder and followed the woman, nodding a goodbye with a grin to the guard. The man narrowed his eyes in obvious distaste and grabbed his arm violently.
"What now?" John asked as the waiter hurriedly fulfilled the request.
He was assured the police would handle this, there was nothing else for John to do but wait. But John of course had other plans. No one would just snatch his property and get away with it. Especially when he still wanted to give Holmes the beating of a lifetime.
"It's just a slave. We'd have paid extra."
I will get you out of this. I
"What do you think?" his mistress asked her. She was nervous almost.
"That was a long time ago," he snarled. It didn't count. "I'm sure you know how to show yourself out."
He hugged the pillow and pressed his face against the blanket. There was no mattress for him to sleep on. Just the blanket and some kind of a folded rug under it. Violent sobs shook his body, he wailed and hiccuped his grief and fear and loneliness. He wanted nothing more than to wake up from this nightmare and seek comfort from his parents' bedroom. He wanted to curl up between his mummy and daddy in their bed, and have them tell him everything was well. That it was all a bad dream, and then they'd have Sandy make him hot chocolate and sing him to sleep.
to escape," he pointed out. "Four times."
"You're not sleeping before
"Please..." He didn't know what else to say. How could his mistress do this to him? He had been loyal. He had stopped with the pointless escape attempts because he had nowhere else to go. He had become obedient because it was better than being beaten every day. He had learnt to adore her, he had loved his lessons and schooling. He had worked hard to make his owners proud and like him.
"A crime scene."
The man smiled briefly before turning completely serious. "Because a short while ago I was under the impression that he was dead."
"Hello," he replied. Mummy had always told him to be polite. He attempted his best to stand still in the living room he'd been brought into. The man had gone, leaving him to this woman. She played violin, Sherlock could see it. And there had been a sign in the window by the door saying "violin lessons".
Mummy and Daddy began arguing in hushed tones, and the moment their tones reached the point they started to attract attention they both left the hall.
," he emphasised by almost making his index finger and thumb touch, "close to beating you until you are unconscious, so
"I still have a few minutes," Mycroft countered and carefully sat at the opposite chair. "I'm not here to fight with you. I just came to see how you're doing."
Second day as a slave owner and he'd already lost the said slave. Or let it escape. What the

"Fine. John."

"Why Florida?" John wondered. "Why were you sold abroad?"
"No," Holmes denied the accusation, but John continued as though he hadn't spoken at all: "How could I buy something, if I didn't know we're out of it?
name yet."
"Not as sorry as you will be tomorrow," John snarled. He felt like kicking the man between the ribs, but suppressed the urge. Holmes's right hand had teeth marks where he must have bitten down on his fist to keep from screaming. "Get up, make that tea and go to sleep."
"That can't be part of the plan." John made a beeline to his coat.
Well, that wasn't very helpful either. He read a bit further about dealing with an adult slave with behavioural problems, but he learnt nothing new. It said essentially the same Holmes's personal file had said. An adult slave in general understood what it did wrong, so it should just be disciplined harder and harder until the slave would bend to its master's will. Didn't seem to have worked with Holmes so far.
The footsteps paused behind his door. He jumped down upon hearing a distinctive beep of the card reader and the electronic locks unlocking. The floor guard must have really had a bad day for bothering to actually open the door. Sherlock could hardly hide his grin while kneeling on the floor like he was supposed to. Couple of blows with the baton and he'd have at least
"Why not?" the man instantly wanted to know. No proper slave would questions its master, but by now John had grown used to Holmes's lack of respect. So long as he didn't cross the line, John could allow it.
John let it go unnoticed. "Laundry's going to be your job as well. I'll show you the laundrette later. Shopping, too, to some extent, I think, after I've updated your papers and get you a permission to carry money."
But Holmes was smart, of course he was. Smart enough to give the right answer this time and not risk getting smacked across the face again just yet.
Mycroft smirked at his brother victoriously. Holmes scowled.
"Yes", John gasped, gripping the shopping bag. His heart was pounding and the blood was rushing in his ears, yet he was calm and his senses were alert. The second camera turned away.
"Social status is not a measure of intelligence."
John breathed out and silently counted to ten. Holmes was difficult, he'd known that.
He attempted a humorous smile. "And my barcode."
"Yes, master." Holmes's shoulders relaxed and he looked relieved. Perhaps he'd thought he'd gone too far by assuming they'd be sharing the bed tonight. It hadn't even crossed John's mind, truth to be told. Even if they were to have sex, which definitely wasn't tonight, he didn't think he'd like the slave to stay in the same bed. Holmes certainly hadn't earned the privilege, and even if he had, John just didn't want to share his bed with another man, slave or not.
"I don't know, you seemed pretty out of it."
John rolled his eyes. "You can go shopping if needed, but no further. And if you do, ask Mrs Hudson if she needs anything."
"Holmes," he called, but no reply came. He tried again with a more demanding tone and carefully shook the man with his foot.
He flipped the pages again and paused to read a paragraph about bedding a slave:
The slave smirked, but the faked smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Shut your mouth or I’ll find better use for it.”
"So", he started, "I don't really know anything about you."
talked this disrespectfully to him.
you to give me a proper name.”
Like an animal caught in the headlights, Sherlock froze momentarily. The man was one of his keepers and his cane hit him on the back as he hastily kowtowed. Mrs Hudson stood up, yelping in surprise.
"I'll do whatever you order. But right now we have a serial killer to catch."
He didn't say anything. Sherlock's eyes widened as a glowing red mark appeared on the cabbie's chest. It moved slightly to rest on his heart.
"Sherlock," Lestrade warned quietly.
"Why do you want to know about my slave?" John questioned. The woman had told him to sleep over it. He had, but he'd understood it was him who was expected to make contact. Surely they wouldn't try bothering him again this soon? Had she or her enigmatic employer changed their mind? John certainly hadn't changed his mind, he was not selling his slave and he hadn't contacted the mysterious M, whoever that was.
He didn't hear any of the rest of the conversation. All he could do was to stare at his own trembling hands in utter disbelief. Mistress was selling him. By this time tomorrow, he'd be waiting for his new owners to take him away. His new mistress stroked his hair for goodbye, and Sherlock could barely reply to her. Mistress wouldn't have even needed to order him to stay while she showed the guest out, because he didn't think his legs would hold him right now.
"Who said you could go out and have a walk?" John questioned as the slave stepped in and closed the door.
, he reminded himself. There was still the deadly gamble, there were still things he wanted to figure out.
They were left with a slave who showed them how to properly bow, stand, kneel and kowtow. Only Sherlock had to try them, while Mycroft with the cast on his leg got to watch. The slave spoke about rules, but Sherlock only pretended to listen. They had to repeat a version of the slave oath. He'd heard their own slaves recite it on few occasions. Then he was led away, while the slave would talk some more with Mycroft. He was sent to a shower, a long corridor he had to walk through as wall-mounted shower heads poured cool water and soap on him.
"I tried to run away, ma'am," Sherlock told. Shame washed over him. He could feel the warmth of a blush on his cheeks. What had he been thinking?
"Holmes took it, sorry. Well, Detective Inspector sort of gave it to him, but I don't think he meant for Holmes to keep it. Is there any way you could pass me to him? It's about the pink lady."
Making his master lose his face was one of the worst things a slave could do. Thirty years back it would have been legal for John to kill Holmes on the spot. Eighty years back it would have been expected of him.
?" the slave countered angrily. "Would you still think the same?"
"It isn't, though. I don't mean the clinical stuff. I don't care about your...muscle structure or– or the fact that you apparently speak fluent French."
"I-er, I own him", he answered, pointing Holmes with his cane.
"What about that pill? Sergeant Donovan told me. Two pills and a choice. You weren't gonna take it, were you?"
John left his tea mug on the table and undid his belt. "No need to take your shirt off, just pull it up and lower your head", he instructed.
"He believes he has to behave," Holmes muttered as he started to scrub the permanent coffee stains on the mug.
"How about a Rose's, do you like Rose's?" she suggested. "They're famed for their appearance and performance. How about a set of twins from Rose's? Just return the slave, and any of this could be yours. Name your price."
"I think it's likelier he'd only arrived. You didn't show up much later," Sherlock continued, eyes scanning the crowd behind the police line. The shooter was unlikely to linger, but one never knew... He stopped at a familiar face.
"You're mad."
"Am I doing something wrong?"
It was easy money. How come everyone didn't rent their slaves? That's what John had thought. Tonight included he had rented Holmes six times in total. The fourth time had earned him enough, but it was
"You do not understand what you're dealing with, Doctor Watson."
Mycroft did his best, yet by the end of January they were still no closer to finding anyone, even though on Sherlock's tenth birthday on the 6th the house had been full of flowers and cards of condolences for their loss. There was little to celebrate, when they'd attended a funeral just a day before. No one but them and their slave were present. Mummy and Daddy had been buried, and neither Mycroft or Sherlock returned to school. February the 10th was their deadline. The local authorities seemed to have no interest in their case apart from the fact that once they were enslaved their property and lands would fall in the hands of the county.
"Like you said, it's all over the news." He raised his eyebrow. "
It wasn’t fair. A year of tolerating her stupid kinks and playing along and she got
An idea began to form in Sherlock's mind. A plan to get them both away. Dangerous, of course, but his life was already dangerous. Even just suggesting it was potentially dangerous. If he was wrong about Mrs Hudson and the lengths she'd be willing to go, she could have him killed for disloyalty. Even if she agreed, standing up against a drug cartel could easily get them both killed, him especially since Mr Hudson had every legal right to kill him should he want to.
“When’s the next one?”
"Ah, yes", Sherlock said, turning around upon noticing his mistake. "Detective Inspector, this is my current owner Doctor John Watson. Master, this is DI Lestrade from Scotland Yard."
you have a therapist.”
"You reek. Have you been drinking?"
He sent Holmes to get some well deserved sleep and decided to check his emails once more. Among the messages, a new one stuck out. It looked exactly like the others that had come through the website he'd left his advert on, and it read:
Sherlock did not reply, only stared at her with wide eyes. She frowned. "I'll slap you again if you don't answer."
"Alright, do that. Take some of my clothes for the bag if you need. Yours I guess might not be enough."
"He's been there for two minutes now. It's him, I'm sure of it," Holmes murmured. He turned around, beckoning the waiter. "White wine, quickly! Get Angelo."
"I heard you were abroad somewhere, getting shot at", Mike laughed. "What happened?"
"I wasn't asking if she's
"What if it had been you,
"You're such a disappointment, Sherlock. Never knew when to keep your mouth shut. Mummy and Daddy are
"Then do", Holmes replied nonchalantly.
"I...will go clean myself then."
Just watch and listen and obey and accept, and
are you doing?" John asked, trying hard to keep his tone neutral.
"I don't know. He just asked if I had any complaints about you and wanted to meet you."
He never learnt her name. Before becoming a permanent addition to his nightmares, she had been just another slave seeking for freedom. She had sat behind him on the boat and all he remembered was the baby crying almost constantly.
"Then how did you pick them?" Sherlock pressed, hiding how pleased it made him the man was calling him Mr Holmes again.
"Holmes?" She didn't look in the least surprised by the knowledge that a slave had possibly gone missing. "He ran off a while ago. He does that."
would be better than the grey walls or the back of a mattress above him.
"There's been a fourth", Holmes said and steepled his hand under his nose. A wide smile spread on his face.
Sherlock hesitated a moment before replying: "Car crash," he said as indifferently as he could. "My father steered the car on the wrong lane. Three people died."
"I called in advance," Holmes explained when John asked about it. "I need a clear view to the street. Don't worry, it didn't cost me anything. The man who keeps this place likes me."
they won't shoot you, too.
"You seriously don't see anything wrong with this picture?"
"My body, my soul, my abilities and my thoughts, all of me belongs to you and is yours to use as you please. I give myself willingly and deserve nothing in return. I respect you, I obey you, I love you. I am grateful, for you give my life a purpose. I'm yours, and your word is my law," he finished and bowed down to the floor. He rather bowed than kissed John's hands or worse, his feet. His jaw hurt. He hadn't even realised how hard he'd been biting down.
John drew a deep breath in an attempt to calm down. His left hand was still shaking, so he kept it curled in a fist, willing the tremor to stop.
"I don't," Sherlock denied immediately. Too quickly. "I merely accept all the facts. We'd be free men if it weren't for me and my– ...big mouth." He was barely able to conceal his grimace at the last words.
"Coffee. Always coffee in the morning. Milk, no sugar."
, his brain supplied and then:
"He was actually house breaking elsewhere," Holmes explained. "Got a little prison time out of it."
"Why?"
They ate, but the silence between them stayed. The small TV was turned on to show the morning news and a talk show to provide some noise for the background, and his master occasionally made comments on it. Sherlock managed to mostly keep his thoughts to himself, only barking a sarcastic comment here and there a few times. It wouldn't do him well to have his brand new master annoyed with him just yet. But to his surprise, John Watson laughed good-naturatedly at his words, providing them with his own opinions. Soon they were having an actual conversation and Sherlock all but forgot his position until John checked his watch to realise he should leave in five minutes to make it to the appointment in time. Ella would not take it well if he'd be late.
"A slave has a far better chance of freedom by escaping than by signing that contract. My brother is a fool."
"Slaves
The cupboards weren't actual cupboards despite how they were called. They were more like tiny rooms in crawlspaces between the walls. Sherlock had no complaints about the one he now occupied. The space was high enough for him to sit down with his back straight, wide enough for him to lie comfortably on his back without either of his shoulders being against the wall and the space took almost full length of the wall, so he had more than enough space to sleep comfortably. String of bright LED-lights ran by the low ceiling and there were four deep shelves at the back for him to keep his clothes and possessions. The ventilation was good, it was dry and there was no way for rodents to get in. It wasn't even very claustrophobic compared to some cupboards Sherlock had occupied previously.
"Not everyone leaves one", John countered.
The name meant less and less as the days went by.
His mouth remained taped shut for the rest of the night.
Although he was curious, there really was nothing John could do to make Holmes reveal the name he was born with, if he wanted to keep it a secret. Not even InS should have records of it. The moment a free person was enslaved for life they ceased to exist. There would be no official connection between the person they were and the slave they would become. It was easier for the families as well. Officially the person enslaved was dead, or in some cases, they had never existed at all. Holmes had been young, so there was a possibility he had never existed as a free person. Or he had perished among with his parents.
"Cigarettes," he confessed. "I got them for doing tricks. So they're mine."
It had been so important to get away that now that he had, he bitterly realised he had no plan. He had nowhere to go. But anywhere would be better than with the people who had bought him. With people who hurt him if he didn't do what they wanted him to do, with people who gave him orders and made him work, with people who treated him like a slave.
"I'm sorry, but
John slapped him as hard across the face as he dared, avoiding his nose. He didn't want the man to bleed on the fitted carpet after all.
"Doesn't sound like a very quick way of making money," John sighed. "What's the best paying thing you could do?"
Had he been in John's place he'd have done the same.
A bearded man wearing light blue coveralls met them at the door. He didn't look pleased in the slightest at the sight of John's slave.
"Thinking."
"I didn't have any", he said quickly.
shouldn't even be allowed here", Anderson complained.
And so John had agreed. If Holmes rather got beaten for not arriving punctually than didn't go out at all then so be it. But tonight John wanted him present.
Additional information stated he had an ID-chip with a GPS tracker installed in 2000. That was fairly late, especially considering what the handler said about him. He'd been listed as lost property between May 1996 and November 1999. He was forbidden to sign an emancipation contract until 1.1.2032, limit given for several attempted escapes and
"You. Will. Not. Talk. To me. Like. That!"
Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed. Please let me know of your thoughts if you can spare a moment. :)
"How do you know they were involved?"
"And love?" John questioned amusedly.
"Nothing."
"Told you what?"
Holmes came to the kitchen's doorway holding the recipe book John had bought him. Holmes had warned he'd never been responsible for preparing food before, but so far he'd done well.
"Just a bit nauseous. Disorientated," he explained. "He– I didn't– Someone shot him through the window. I tried to ask him about the pills, but– The blood, I thought, I thought– I did
"It's none of your business," Sherlock cut him off. He didn't want Mycroft's help, didn't want his brother to stick his nose into this and potentially get on the bad side of his mistress because of him. Chances were the collar last time had been because of him. Their entire unfortunate situation was because of him.
Frustrated he started to make his way back to the restaurant when he stepped on something. He looked down and saw a phone. Not just any phone. Detective Inspector Lestrade's phone, the one Holmes had been using. He pocketed the device and ran back to the street to hail himself a taxi as well. Holmes was chipped, he only needed to get online, purchase the damn tracking device service and he'd have an instant access on Holmes's real time location.
were both phrases any slave would use to describe their owners no matter what kind of owners they were. They were empty words. It was no more than a polite phrase, but something in the softness of Holmes's voice betrayed there was more to it. John had never thought of it before, but it must have been a huge shock for a child to be sold to slavery, to move in with strangers who became his owners.
I want to trust, the slave in him said. It yearned to trust. It yearned to let John have everything and never have to fear or make decisions again.
Some kind of lottery winner, perhaps? A slave among gift vouchers and cars wasn’t an unusual prize. Sherlock shouldn’t have kept looking at her, but he did, since most people found it unnerving to have a slave stare at them like a free person.
Jeff Hope kept watching him, radiating silent fury. "I should've known from the start."
“So, why the deadline?” he asked instead, turning his attention back to the woman.
, Mycroft had said. Even though he'd known it would never be true, he had believed it. He had waited for his brother to come and save him, to magically fix everything. But days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months and months turned to years. He had all but given up on believing he would ever see his brother again when after three years, on a hot summer day, Hannah interrupted his daily violin practise.
Holmes flashed a smile at John. "Would half four be too early?"
"The slave oath. I want to hear you recite the slave oath."
And so Sherlock returned voluntarily. They still hurt him, but they were kinder than before.
Holmes huffed amusedly. "Yes, it's larger than the one he wore the last time I saw him. It's a punishment."
"Yeah, whatever... Won't take long."
"It's good to see you again. There've been a few cases you would've cracked a lot quicker than we did. How long have you been back?" he wanted to know.
. She was into books about pale, sparkling vampires”, he explained with distaste. “I had to read them to be able to get in character for her. I’ve deleted it now. Master initially just referred to me as “the pale one”. Probably an insult to mistress’s...hobby. “Darling, get the pale one to warm the bed.” “Pale one, do the dishes.” “Pale one, clean the cat’s litter box””, he imitated. “Her version was the one to stick, eventually.”
"Go ahead, Holmes, you can tell her."
"He said he thought you were dead."
"What are you doing?" hissed the slave he'd been working with.
you to trust me. I want you to know that with me you are protected. I won't let anyone harm you. Not again. I promise."
"Sherlock."
John thought of the previous night. Did he know? He had, the moment Holmes had asked him to, but his slave hadn't said a word before that. What if Holmes hadn't pleaded for him to stop?
John nodded thoughtfully, but didn't ask what else he had been rented for. He took a pen and rolled it between his fingers.
. His hand tried to unconsciously reach the jacket pocket under the coveralls at least he had had the sense to wear when offered. He didn't want Holmes to see the strange business card, so he kept it with himself. Someone badly wanted his slave, but why? His skill set was certainly impressive, but he was also ill-tempered and a bloody bad slave at most of the time. Why would someone be so interested in buying him so suddenly? If someone wanted him so badly, why hadn't they bought him sooner? There had been plenty of opportunities.
"Euthanised", Holmes repeated, tasting the word. "Is that what it's called in the army? It's so...
great moment to say he actually really, really would prefer a female. Especially after that. He didn’t want an ill-behaving slave. He wouldn’t trust himself with a slave like that.
"Sherl–!"
His slave was gone.
He was described as a slave who needed "strict rules, control, physical work to keep him occupied" and "regular disciplining should unwanted behavior arise". It also stated that his owner should be "strong-willed, consistent, repressive, resolute and ready to provide physical disciplining". John could see why he was given to an ex-soldier. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for Holmes, John wasn't sure he was the kind of man the paper described.
John's gaze found the file still on the desk. "The viol– Yes, right. You have a violin. Can you play it?"
discipline you."
"I can't sell you."
"I've had some practice," Sherlock slurred, but Jeff Hope could hardly make the meaning. His tongue still wouldn't work properly. He reached for the door, but it didn't open. Probably wouldn't, even if he could get a firm grip.
"No, I'm just borrowing it." Holmes jumped up from his seat. "Come on, John, we need to go."
The fingers in his hair gripped harder, tugged so violently that it hurt. He squeezed his eyes shut against the flashing lights, but he couldn't shut the music out. The bass radiated from the floor, vibrating through his body. His hands shook as he fumbled with the flies in the dark. The man's knee had been going up and down with the rhythm until Sherlock began. Now his feet were firmly against the floor as he worked his hips to push himself deeper in Sherlock's throat. It was disgusting –so, so utterly disgusting, yet he settled for his task eagerly. Desperately. He needed it
John turned. "Sorry? What did you say?" he asked. Evidently he had not heard.
have you freed.
"So..? How was it?"
But he wasn't meant to be a slave, he wasn't! Wasn't he? But maybe,
He hesitated a moment. It wasn't a secret, but it involved a period of his life he would have rather forgotten altogether.
Lestrade's words made little sense to him.
"How would you know?"
“That’s not a bad name at all. Alright, Holmes it is. I’m John.”
. But the adrenalin his fit of anger had produced was wearing off and the grogginess was seeping back. "So you're dying and decided to, what, assassinate people for cash? Why?"
Or...it could be an euphemism for sex.
He staggered, legs giving out and fell on the floor despite trying to hold on to the table behind him to stay on his feet. He hugged the table leg, dragging himself half under the table.
Sherlock nodded shakily. "Thank you, Detective Inspector."
you doing? Or should I just check the browsing history?"
Sherlock looked at him defiantly and said nothing.
"Well, excuse me, but you really don't look or act like a slave. At all."
She grimaced slightly. “There was some trouble with it in the past, apparently. An escapee and foul-mouthed. I suppose that's why they picked it an owner like you. It needs more discipline than an average slave to stay in line.”
Hannah entered the room to clear the coffee table. She avoided looking at him.
The doorbell interrupted his musings. The slave had returned. But before John could even begin scolding him, a pink suitcase was shoved into his arms.
"Oh, you! Did you find him?"
"But you're a slave."
Mycroft's words from their conversation swirled around his head.
"Change of plans", the slave said bluntly after reading the text. "We need to go to Lauriston Gardens, Brixton."
Because a slave who hurts a free man deserves to be beaten, whispered a treacherous voice at the back of his mind. Because a slave who dishonours its owner should be beaten. Because he deserved to be blamed.
“Yes, master.”
"I know the landlady, she owes me a favour. Sort of. She'll give you a special deal."
A week later Sherlock had himself successfully moved into the cartel's service. And they were going to take it down.
"I'm flogging you the moment we're back home", John vowed, but despite himself did exactly what Holmes wanted him to do. He examined the body, noticed the mysterious "rache" on the floor while doing so and explained what undoubtedly Lestrade's team already knew. Asphyxiation, passed out and choked in her own vomit.
"I know a good restaurant there. Hopefully the murderer shows up. Come on, John," he called excitedly. "Might be dangerous!"
He leant back on his seat, pondering the situation for a moment before closing the lid.
"Why would anyone be fan of a slave?" the cabbie countered instantly. "Some people have more unusual interests than others."
The slave moaned, but obeyed reluctantly. "What?"
"I should be back by six," he informed Holmes. It was his first actual full day of work since moving back to the country. Not anything full time, but he'd be doing a sick leave substitution for the next four days at least. Hopefully other work would follow. He was running low on money given all the recent expenses. He might have to start seriously considering alternative ways of making money. "I want the tea ready or near ready at least. If it takes longer, help yourself and keep my share warm. Wish me luck."
"Baker Street?" John repeated in disbelief before laughing. "That's right in the middle of London! How on earth do you imagine I could afford Baker Street when I barely afford this?"
"I– Forgive me, mistress. I wasn't expecting this," he apologised with a hasty bow, violin still in his hand.
"My employer would be willing to pay a considerable sum of money for your new slave."
He was to be rented again today, but at least this time it would be fairly straightforward. A 50th birthday party. He would provide some of the night's entertainment with his violin –a pleasant change for the drunken parties he'd previously been to. He would just have to play and help the house slave with the clean up afterward. He had been promised food, shower, and sleep before he would be returned to his owner the following day. Hopefully, by next week Sherlock would have made John enough money to never do this again.
" I don't do drunks. Go away."
"Apologies", he muttered silently, head bowed down. Sherlock could feel Lestrade's eyes on him.
How often he'd heard those words.
As always, thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed. Please take a moment to let me know your thoughts if you've got a moment to spare. That would be really nice.
He still saw, but he had learnt to ignore. Looking at people for too long meant trouble. Telling what he saw meant pain. He thought he must have imagined it, when his attention was caught by a woman's voice with an English accent. It pulled his mind out of the stagnation, it rang clear above the noise. His eyes sought frantically for its source, his conscious self not quite trusting it had been real.
"The door?"
"Nobody. Your question is fallacious. You ask "who," yet you're talking to an object. You cannot label an object "who"."
"Anthea", she stated carefully with a mischievous glint in her eyes.
"How do you know?"
Jeff Hope led him to an empty cafeteria. Tall windows faced an empty, dark car park on the other side of the building they'd arrived to. Hope didn't switch on all the lights. "This okay?"
"As you wish, master", he replied half-heartedly.
need to ask for a permission for
But despite the bleeding, bruising and swelling, no life-threatening or permanent harm had come to Sherlock. After he'd been patched up at a hospital they had had no other choice but to return him to his legal owner. Greg would forever remember the call he received a few weeks later, three o'clock in the morning. Sherlock's panicky voice in his ear, begging for him to come and help.
"Three times before the missing episode and once after it. He's lost his rights for an emancipation contract because of it."
"My sixth owner was quite generous and had a good taste", Holmes said, eyes still closed.
His eyes had not once left the two men in the hallway until he heard the door close above. Before the men had uttered a word he'd raised his index finger to shush them.
"I called a few places I thought might need a violinist," he told. "Two places actually remembered you. No one needs a violinist right now, but they might give me a call in the future. That's alright with you, right?"
"No, I forbid you from falling asleep."
escape."
"There've been people passing by all night. How do you know it's him?"
"Did I tell you to get dressed?" he snapped when the slave reached for his shirt. Holmes looked at him, hesitating briefly before withdrawing his hand.
She was lying almost certainly. She seemed uncomfortable with whatever it was she wasn't saying. He frowned at her but didn't ask. If she lied, it was because mistress had told her to –and he would not question his mistress.
London was his home. If John took him away from London, what would he have left? London gave him anonymity. Here he could walk the streets and not be looked as a slave. If John took him away, if they left London, if they moved somewhere smaller, people would soon learn what he was. There would be no escape from it. No more mysteries for him to solve.
Where exactly are you taking me?"
"I expect you to do better next time, though", he managed between giggles once the laughter started to settle. Holmes sobered immediately.
John didn't say anything. The man stayed up for another hour or so before Sherlock heard him get up and walk to the kitchenette and back. The lights went off and he heard John make his way to the bed, his breathing soon turning into deep and steady rhythm Sherlock had by now learnt meant the man had fallen asleep.
Sherlock bit the inside of his lip, silently praying he wouldn't get an erection. Would it be an insult if he did? What if he was supposed to get one? He held his breath, but she let go and moved on to feel his thighs and calves.
"We? You mean you. You think
John knew he wouldn't get more out of him. Nor should he. Whatever his slave had witnessed in the hands of his previous owners was none of John's business, and Holmes should never reveal anything personal about his previous owners. John understood that, and accepted it. If he were to ever sell Holmes, he wouldn't want the slave to talk about him, either.
John wanted to wince, but the Detective Inspector didn't seem to care or notice how the slave should have introduced them the other way around. He offered his hand to the man, and although Lestrade shook it, his attention remained on the slave.
"No, it'll work for now. Carry on."
"Please, stop! Think of Redbeard," she tried to reason with him. "It's inevitable and you're making this harder for him."
", John chided. "I'm sorry, he's–"
John turned to briefly look at the man crouching on the floor, not commenting her words. The man was skinny and pale, but not in a way he’d seen abused slaves being skinny. He wasn’t malnourished. Just regularly skinny like a slave. He clearly had muscles, but he could also see the man’s spine visibly sticking out from his back. The scars didn’t stand out much from the pale skin, but they were scars and there were lot of them. If they weren’t caused by an abusive owner, they were unquestionably a bad sign. There were only so many reasons for a slave to be legally caused such wounds.
"Yes, but how do you get along with him? Will he keep you? I looked into your records at the Institute and you were set to be put down."
The look on Holmes's face relaxed. "They're more like...acquaintances. Which one?"
"Yeah, well, I meant inside.
Sherlock leant to the door frame. He swallowed and blinked a few times before replying. "You tell me."
Behind him, the slave had got up and was pulling a shirt over his head, silently eying at his new master. Just when John got the newly acquired papers safely closed to his bag the slave slipped into a surprisingly expensive looking dark coat and bent over to pick up the duffle bag and the dressing gown. Without a word he placed the latter one on the desk and bowed to his handler. She didn’t acknowledge the gesture in slightest and kept her eyes fixed on John, who smiled for the lack of better response.
"You saved her husband from a death sentence?"
you to think."
"Er, sorry?"
He did, but by next summer Mycroft was sold to MI5 and Sherlock had expected to never see him again. Mycroft may have believed him dead for the past four years, but Sherlock hadn't heard a thing from him for nine years until The Oyster House was all over the news and Mycroft saw his face on a newspaper. Not that it would have helped, had Mycroft been able to keep an eye on him.
"At Baker Street?" he questioned again. Was he out of his mind? The room had to be tiny.
House burnt at night. The house slave's throat slashed open in the garden. The pet locked in the master bedroom's cupboard. Husband and wife in their bed. All three of them burnt to death. 11-year-old Carl Powers nowhere to be found.
The cabbie smiled, his bad teeth showing between his lips. "You're gonna love this. Just watch."
“Why not? Not that I was planning on freeing him or anything...” It felt a little bad to say so in front of the slave in question. He was only vaguely aware of what an emancipation contract actually meant apart from the obvious: a contract between the legal owner and the slave where the owner agreed to free the slave. He imagined the conditions of such contract to be extremely strict. The owner could not back away from it easily, so the contracts weren’t very popular as far as he knew.
"I don't think so." His speech was getting better, but his limbs still felt numb and he had trouble focusing his eyes. Moving his head sent everything spinning. Still, he'd managed to make a few details. "Where are we going?"
"We?" John echoed. "So you were in the car, too?"
. I want the best for you. As a slave. You are my responsibility. So just be good and do your part, and you don't have to worry about anything. Worrying and making decisions are
The slaves official papers only mentioned his ID-number, which John couldn’t recall, not that it was a proper name anyway. Though naturally, a master could call their slave whatever they wished, but most people gave slaves actual names that stuck with them even if they changed owners. Some named them like pets and apparently many named their bed slaves by actors or characters they fancied. Some even gave names that were insults and not for children’s ears. John had no interest in making up names if the slave already had a name he preferred.
"He'll come with us then."
"The way you treat me gives it away. You didn't really want me and you feel –well not guilty for owning me, but
With a heavy sigh Sherlock curled on his left side under the duvet. He remembered, as a child, long before this nightmare, climbing into his bed before his nanny had even left. He'd pressed his cold toes against her thighs or tummy, and she'd hugged him, sang for him and read him stories. Mummy had sometimes read for him, too, but mostly she had been too busy. Sandy always left the door ajar so that Redbeard could walk in and sleep by his bed.
slept with yours yet?"
"It is. But putting down slaves is not what I meant. You
Guests at the Marlowe household were a common sight. Henry and Lydia Marlowe were sociable people with a large circle of friends. At least once a month a dinner for anything between three to fifteen people kept Sherlock and Hannah busy. Sometimes a guest would bring their slave for additional help. But all that had changed when their master's business began to struggle and then came to a sudden end. Sherlock didn't know the details and had learnt very quickly not to ask. A slave such as himself would not understand. Sherlock didn't agree with his master, but if master said he didn't need to know then it must have been so.
. And that was a long time ago."
Sherlock set down his master's breakfast. "Clearly."
This part Sherlock hadn’t heard before, so he listened carefully what being a pension legally meant for him and his new owner.
"Sounds like you got along well."
"And finally, to the right, half behind that tree."
"I just needed to get out! I spent two weeks in a tiny cell at InS, I
Silence fell between them for nearly a minute as she kept working on her computer. The phone on the table started ringing, but she never answered it. John tried to occupy himself by looking at the framed picture of Mt. Fuji on the wall.
"It's the PTSD."
The thought of Mycroft made him angry. Stupid, stupid fat Mycroft. Where was he now? Why wasn't he here? Why hadn't he done anything? Mycroft had told him it'd be good if he was sold. But it wasn't good at all. Maybe Mycroft had always wanted to sell him. Tears fell down his face when he remembered the times he'd bullied Mycroft, the times he'd got himself in trouble and Myc had muttered: "Behave, Sherlock. Don't you know that bad kids are sold as slaves?"
John bit back all the immediate responses that came to his mind and fought back the impulse to hit the man's jaw. Instead he pursed his lips a little before responding: "I got shot."
"No."
"My owner before that rarely let me out of the house. Like I told you, Lestrade managed to borrow me a few times, but that was it."
It was like everyone around them sighed of relief collectively and then returned to do whatever they'd been doing, pretending nothing had happened at all.
Holmes watched him with growing confusion and disbelief. "But you're angry," he nearly whispered.
"It might be."
"I don't like the tone of your voice."
"I'm right, aren't I?" Sherlock claimed. "Hurts worse when the truth comes from a slave, doesn't it?"
Dear John,
Please him. But John hadn't ordered him to. Or had he just now?
The grimace of shame on Mycroft's face was the worst thing he'd ever seen, but it was gone instantly and his brother turned to face the caller. "Yes, master?"
The corner of Hope's mouth twitched. Something...something important he was still missing.
She laughed good-humouredly at that. "I haven't noticed you before. Have you been here for long?"
"Is. That. Understood?" John spelled out each word, grabbing the slave's curly, black hair to force him to face his owner looming over him. The slave grimaced and hissed in pain as John pulled his head by the hair, far enough to make him sit on his knees like he should've done in the first place.
Only none of his previous owners had ever forgotten his status and John had not bedded him yet. Perhaps Mycroft was right about that, too. Perhaps John thought he'd put up a fight.
Dr Watson raised his eyebrow at his tone. "Your master's up, you should be preparing my breakfast."
"Very funny. A friend of yours," he corrected. Holmes tensed and turned to look at him with an utterly disturbed expression.
And there was a part of him, a part that frightened him, whispering him to forget about fighting. Telling him it'd be so much easier to submit and finally,
"It's not your fault, Holmes," she said softly. "We wouldn't sell you if there was another way, but there isn't. You know we've been needing money after Henry's business–. After the–."
"Shut it, both of you", Lestrade barked. "Doctor Watson", he continued with more calm, "I would really greatly appreciate your slave's opinion of the scene."
"I'm willing to believe he owns you and for some reason rather sent you than came himself."
John scoffed. "Why would anyone want
Sherlock turned to look at John who had, unnoticed by him, walked into the kitchen. He looked down at his hands, still holding at the edges of the plates he had brought to the counter by the sink.
"Sorry." Sherlock backtracked to the kitchen, refilled the kettle and logged in on John's laptop while the water boiled. His inbox had nothing worth of his attention. He was routinely asked to track down runaway slaves, but he never bothered replying no matter what they may have offered him in return.
And what frightened him the most was that somewhere deep within him a part of him wanted to. A part of him that truly was a slave wanted to love and want his master, wanted to submit and serve. The slave in him just wanted to feel secure and safe again. Wanted the relief of knowing someone else always knew what was best for him. It's sickened him. He wasn't like that. He would
Sherlock didn't dare to move. He could hear the man draw shaky breaths and in the dim light coming from the window he could see him biting into his fist to not sob out loud. The doctor probably didn't remember he was in the room, but then again, even if he did, what would it matter to a free man like him? Sherlock was just a slave, it hardly mattered what he saw or heard. He idly wondered if he should go to his master, attempt to soothe him somehow, but the mere idea disgusted him. He wasn't like that, he wasn't that much of a slave. He wouldn't willingly go to his owner's bed in the middle of the night, when the man had just woken from a nightmare. Not unless he was ordered to.
"I haven't mentioned the figure."
"No."
understand that his owners had been right all along. Of course they had been. It had been foolish to think he knew better. His owners knew better. Pursuing freedom and fighting back hadn't made him happy. Being useful and making his owners proud was his source of happiness and stability.
cross me. I'm going to let you go in a moment and then you both
him. You've been given to a decent master who's unlikely to abuse you. Don't ruin it by rebelling."
He watched Holmes gather his clothes from the floor, and put aside John's cane before wishing his master goodnight. His back must have hurt him, but he fell asleep within minutes, long before John.
He was visibly irritated, but so was John. Probably not as much as the slave hopefully imagined, but a little nevertheless. Hacking into his master's laptop wasn't exactly the kind of thing a slave should expect to get away with. Holmes wasn't unaware of his dissatisfaction, so after a moment of silence he sighed and dropped on his knees from the chair. "I said
Sherlock saw him looking and for a moment a knot twisted in his stomach. Each time with a new owner he feared they might not honour his ownership to it. Twice he'd already accepted he'd lost it forever. But for once the bureaucracy that ran the InS had been on his side.
"I'll see if I'm in any shape for a statement tomorrow," Sherlock sighed. "John– My master," he corrected, "was somewhat unhappy with me earlier. I've earned myself quite a beating."
“Yes, of course.” He eyed at the document and quickly signed it without really reading it.
"Shows up?" he questioned, closing the door behind him.
Sherlock's gaze lingered at his cupboard's door. He felt warm and comfortable here. His body felt sluggish and the duvet was heavy on him. It would be nice to get to stay and sleep here. Maybe it would be better to get it over and done with. Sooner or later it would happen, and the wait was surely worse than the routine it would become.
He jolted awake to the sound of doors slammed open. There were footsteps and shouting and people, but he couldn't make sense of any of it.
The scene of crime was easy to spot as soon as the cab pulled to the street. Sherlock waited impatiently for John to pay and strode far before him to the police cars with their flashing lights. They were just secluding the area with tape. Lestrade's back was easy to recognise.
"But I guess I need to move out", he sighed eventually. "I just can't sustain living in London with the army pension."
“That…” John started when he felt like being able to make a complete, coherent sentence again, “was amazing.”
Well, apparently he was about to now.
John shook his head slowly in amazement. "Unbelievable. You got all that from a phone? You're amazing, you know that?"
"People don't just marry their slaves unless they love them. They want to make it legal and equal." Surely no one would marry a slave unless they truly loved it like a person. The idea was absurd.
"What?" John blurted out. The slave didn't move. "Holmes, I said–"
"You were still sleeping and your phone is on silent", Holmes told. His eyes were cast down and he stood by the table with his hands folded above his crotch, for once actually looking like a slave.
"So you're hoping someone replies?" John wanted to know, pointing at the phone Holmes had beside his thigh on the bed.
"Yet you're here."
There was no need to cross the entire sea, they'd been told. Not in that boat. They would rendezvous with a proper ship at the international waters. Norwegian. Safe for soon former slaves.
John rolled his eyes. "Oh, just admit it. You're grumpy because with all your escape attempts you lost your rights to plead for emancipation. If you hadn't messed up, you'd still have a way out."
"Did he escape?"
”So, a war hero?” Ms Bruce finally inquired pleasantly as the printer on the side table started printing.
. I'd be a fool to admit any kind of disloyalty."
Mycroft disappeared into Mummy's office among with the strangers who would soon take them away. Sherlock stayed with Redbeard until they came to take him away. Sandy tore him away from the dog and held him with all her strength as he kicked and clawed to get himself free. Redbeard barked and fought against his leash.
"Master explicitly told me it had to be spotless and done quietly", Holmes said, sounding a little wary. The extremely polite pattern of addressing one's master didn't fit well with the defiant look in his eyes.
"I did, but I've sort of lost him again."
Breakfast between them had become by far one of John's favourite things. They might watch the morning news in the sitting room or he could read the newspaper, and he could comment on things like he was talking to a perfectly normal human being. During the breakfast he often forgot Holmes was a slave at all. They talked and they joked and they laughed together. And each time the spell would eventually break, leaving John feel awkward and uncomfortable. Holmes was not his friend. No matter how natural and right it may have felt to speak with him, it wasn't right. It only caused tension to built up between them when at first they were acting like friends and then abruptly switched back to master and slave.
"Anthea? That's an unusual name. Very beautiful."
"But you didn't feel like waking me up?" he questioned.
"Enough, all of you", Lestrade commanded before John could tell Holmes to apologise and shut up, or before either Anderson or Donovan could add another word. "Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes. Donovan, return to your post. Holmes, you follow me."
"Which is precisely why I wear such an exaggerated collar", the man patiently explained, frowning slightly as he spoke. He glanced meaningfully at John's hand. "To avoid someone losing their face by making an embarrassing mistake. My mistress would be most displeased if that were to ever happen again..."
"Fine. Do you have any idea who "M" could be?" he asked reluctantly.
"Ask the family slaves about the lovers, they ought to know", he advised. Lestrade immediately questioned him, so irritably, but hastily Holmes explained how he'd reached the conclusion about Cardiff with a little help from the weather maps.
"You don't think a slave like me could know all those things?" Sherlock challenged. "You think because I'm a slave I must be intellectually inferior? Just a few minutes ago you were praising my intelligence."
"My sweet child," Lydia murmured and caressed his hair after Hunny had beat him on her orders. "My dear boy... I wish Hunny wouldn't have to do this to you. Why must you disobey us? Why do you keep running away? Your place is here with us. With me."
"Well therein lies your problem. You are so insubordinate he thinks you'd make a scene of it."
"I don't want to be sold," Sherlock interrupted grumpily.
Sherlock snorted. "Thank you."
"That's because they don't want any complaints from your owner. It's for the shock."
"Once a week for fish and chips. No, of course we don't."
She closed the door, leaving Sherlock into almost complete darkness. The narrow streaks of light weren't enough to help him see. He heard the latch move, locking him in.
"Did you–" John attempted to compose himself. "Did you sleep at all?"
He crossed the street and headed for the side road where the black vehicle awaited. He drummed the cab's back window with his palms before lowering to speak to the driver through the open front window.
Silence fell between them, and Sherlock found it hard to look at his brother.
Eventually John sighed and let go. "Do you really know capoeira?"
"Well?" Holmes prompted, still completely oblivious to his master's anger.
"This? I just found it. Is it yours?" The cabbie offered the phone to him.
Lestrade drove him back early in the evening. John had been shopping while he was away –and not just for food. A new item which Sherlock was far too familiar with had been added to his possessions. A rattan cane, one of the most common tools for punishing slaves. Sherlock wasn't surprised in the least. He told himself he wasn't disappointed, either. John had already used a belt on him and it still stung badly. Assuming he was beyond using violence against his slave was laughable.
a house slave", Holmes confirmed. "Mostly. But I'm not a cook. It's not very interesting."
"Good", the voice acknowledged and to John's astonishment, the camera turned away. "There's another one to the right, a little higher. Do you see it?"
"How unfortunate," his brother tutted, but didn't back away.
It was the voice of reason and logic he so often listened without question, without hesitation. And it
"Well you would know that, wouldn't you?" she sneered under her breath.
"What was the investment then?"
, “a quick look while I collect your new property.”
"Successful career, unhappy marriage. Chances are they have at least two slaves. What do you think, master?"
"Why?"
The second last chapter dealing with A Study Pink. Hope you enjoyed. Happy New Year, fellow slavelockians! (Is that even a word? But I'm assuming you must like slavelock at least a little since you're here.)
"I'll catch a serial killer," Holmes replied. He accepted the wine and threw it all over his face as his master watched in confusion. The slave dried his face just as Angelo returned to their table. Holmes smirked. "Headless nun."
Surely Holmes wasn't truly that bad, he reasoned, climbing up the stairs. Just mistreated. And misunderstood. His papers labeled him stupid, but he was nothing like that. He had a brilliant mind, he just didn't get to use it productively.
"When?" Mycroft pressed.
"Master, he's just a child!" she argued. A month ago Mycroft would've slapped her for talking back. Today it didn't feel appropriate.
So John did not back away from his threat. After they'd had breakfast and Holmes had done the dishes, he had ordered his slave to remove his shirt once more. Still very sore from the previous night, Holmes moaned in pain every time the leather touched his skin, though John was far more gentle this time. But Holmes did not shy away from the belt. The man faced the consequences of his actions without a word of protest and rightfully asked for forgiveness after it was done.
Lestrade, however, objected, protesting that he already had a forensic team and that he couldn't possibly have more people touch the body. But he gave in when Holmes claimed not even the slaves of Anderson's team would agree to work with him. Now that they were just the three of them, Holmes's earlier self-confidence had returned. Had John not known, he would have never assumed the man challenging the DI into a silent staring competition was a slave. He really ought to buy the man collar.
"You talk big," Sherlock mumbled. "Anything at all" was hardly going to frighten him. It wasn't much of a threat to a slave. "Quite a risk. People saw us. My m– colleague at the restaurant saw."
"Good. Good," John said with a firm nod. "Because I told you before.
"Get dressed. Gather all your belongings and I'll go through them with you in the morning."
"Yeah, I know." Though he wondered how she did. He looked around in the unfamiliar neighbourhood. He couldn't even remember the name of the bloody place. "Sorry, where am I?"
"They did," he confirmed. No use trying to deny it. He had been the one to suggest renting in the first place.
"Is an older brother not allowed to simply want to see his little brother after four years? Let me look at you."
Even so there was no denying that had Greg himself been Sherlock's owner, he would've already had the slave beaten. John's dignity and ability to see the bigger picture for letting Sherlock go see the body after speaking like that was admirable.
"He hasn't ordered me to," he blurted out. Mycroft looked at him skeptically. Sherlock couldn't blame him. He himself had thought it obvious John would want to test him the very first night he owned him. "He doesn't want to sleep with me."
Sherlock nodded in defeat. He still had the coat, his most prized possession after the violin. Perhaps, if he behaved well, John might give him other gloves to use. It wouldn't be the same, but really it should make no difference whether he actually had something like gloves or not.
Sherlock said nothing, just silently pulled the gloves over his hands and studied the small bottles on the table.
Lydia laughed. "Oh, Holmes. Don't be silly. You'll never be able to pay for yourself. She's paying twenty-five-thousand pounds for you."
"Mike Stamford, a mate from Bart's", he continued, pushing back the thoughts. Normal people talked to their slaves, too. "Promised to meet him again later."
Holmes's eyes narrowed and his lips pursed in anger.
"Why would anyone pay you for killing random people?"
"It's good to see you in good hands."
"To be sold back to London, of course", Holmes stated and rang the doorbell.
"How?" John questioned, despite already digging into his pocket for the phone unconsciously. He had never heard a slave speak with such a demanding tone.
He heard the guest hum approvingly. "And the violin? That's the most important thing of course. Could I hear him play?"
"No," his brother replied stubbornly. "I don't want to be a slave, I don't want anyone to buy me!"
Holmes smirked. "I think so."
in the situation made sense until he saw the cabbie's body over Lestrade's shoulder. He went boneless from relief. Yes, that was it. He was in London, he had just narrowly escaped death and John clearly had not abandoned him if he had found a way to contact Lestrade.
"It belongs to my owner", the slave said. "I've asked to be able to meet you, Dr Watson. I have my mistress's permission."
Sherlock did not cry. When the auction opened and the people began to pour in he made nasty deductions of anyone who dared to come close. He was hit several times by the auctioneers in order to silence him, but it didn't work for long.
His brother got up to leave, but Mycroft grabbed his left wrist. "Look at this. This is what we are now. This number here is now your name. There's no escaping this now. Don't make things worse for yourself."
Holmes wasn't comfortable and John could see it, but his slave didn't complain. The moment the happily tipsy girls arrived for him everything about him seemed to change. He was all smiles and eager for their adoration like a puppy dog. Clearly he had no intention to sabotage John's business. Had he sulked or said he didn't want to do it, John would have felt even worse about himself.
"I-I knew that." God, he didn't want Mycroft to see how disappointed he was. How naïvely he had believed Mycroft was here to take him away.
want to have sex with you."
it was my right to sleep or have sex with you. I'm sorry."
"I'm a slave, the risk's always lingering somewhere," Sherlock dismissed. "You though...you've been dying for three years."
The dog was taken away from him. They were pulled apart. Poor Redbeard struggled and fought against the leash, whining miserably. Somehow he knew.
"How could it not?"
John got in and while he advised the driver of his address, the slave walked around the car to get in as well. He placed his bag on the empty middle seat, eying at his new owner curiously.
"Sherlock, what's going on? Are you alright? Breathe, tell me what happened."
No. No, she couldn't go away. Not yet, not now!
"Why?" John asked confusedly. He would have thought a slave so eager for freedom would have jumped at the opportunity.
Jeff Hope screamed in pain and, god, it felt
, he repeated as a silent reminder.
Sherlock did as he was told to. He grit his teeth when the belt smacked his back one, two, three times, each of them hard, precise and painful. A military man indeed. And it clearly wasn't John's first time doing this either. Sherlock exhaled slowly, still holding his shirt up and keeping his head down while his master redid his belt.
"They might find Redbeard a new home, too," she tried. "Please don't cry, Sherlock."
"Fatty?" John repeated confusedly, but shook his head and let it go. "Is it his birth name?"
”Apparently, yes”, John admitted reluctantly. After a few seconds of silence he added, for the sake of conversation: ”I didn't know they were giving slaves to veterans these days.”
my wishes. I've never given him a permission to even talk to any of you. Let alone to
have you flogged."
"I'm not stupid, Mr Holmes. You're not getting off this car alone. Don't worry, you've only been out for about ten minutes."
It was the first time John heard the slave speak and he was startled by the sudden, odd question. “What?”
. But John never voiced the thought. It would’ve only been a cruel reminder. Sad as it may have been, Holmes was now a slave. His slave. If a child had nowhere to go, it was only right to give such child a meaningful life. As a slave, such child would be taken care of, and would have a purpose in life.
"Yes, master", Holmes replied and after half a second added: "Thank you, master."
Gears moved in his head. M. Not Mycroft. The fan. Moriarty. M for Moriarty.
John gave him a sharp, warning look. Sherlock scowled at him. He'd even said "please"!
"What are you doing?"
"Well, it's near impossible for a slave to–"
He had meant to keep it civil, not beat his slave to the ground. He didn't regret the amount of force he'd used, but he hadn't meant to keep going.
Mummy had died instantly when the car hit the door on her side. Daddy was still alive, just barely, when Mycroft despite his fractured fibula had helped Sherlock out of the car through its shattered back window. His father had died before the rescuers cut him out. He didn't remember much of it.
The latest entry was from yesterday:
"If that's what you wanna believe.
At the crime scene earlier Sherlock had been his old self. For a moment Greg had thought the slave hadn't changed a bit during the last few years until Dr Watson had interfered. He'd never seen the joy of a case die so quickly in Sherlock's eyes. He'd never seen him return to his master's side with such beaten impression, without a word of defiance.
Sherlock's fingers gripped the duvet. No matter what John had planned, it would happen tonight. He would offer himself like Mycroft had told him to. He would put on his best "I want you" face and crawl across the bed to greet him as soon as he closed the bedroom door behind him.
"You don't need to worry about either of them," Holmes assured. "I doubt she has any interest for you. No offence. But neither really is my business, master. You are."
"Yes, but this is more fun. So what do you think?"
. Had been. Now he was furniture. His legal rights to some extent were worse than those of pets. You couldn't hit a dog after all, but you could hit a slave.
Sherlock sighed loudly. It took him considerable effort to sit up straight. Just walking here seemed to have completely drained him. He propped an elbow on the table to support his forehead with his hand to get a proper look at the bottle on the table. It did intrigue him.
"I know a lot of people," he replied vaguely. He may not have had friends, but he had acquaintances from all levels of life. He knew slaves whose entire world was the building they tended to, and people who would sell even their own families to make profit. He'd met murderers and blackmailers, slavers and thieves. Not all of them he would help, but it was beneficial to know them.
"Please, mistress, please. You can't do this. You can't sell me. Please don't."
John met up with his rugby mates again. One of them even offered to come help with the upcoming move with his van. Day before the actual move, John took his slave to InS to have his chip updated with for commuting rights. He still didn't have a permission to carry money, but John was glad to finally be able to get Holmes a slave version of an Oyster card. It made using the Tube and the buses a lot easier.
Lestrade shook his head apologetically, but he knew what the slave meant. He had slaves at home, too, and he knew how slaves could treasure even seemingly insignificant things they may have owned. "Sorry, I can't promise anything."
"No, I– That's not what I meant. I mean, this room", he gestured at the bedroom behind the kitchen. He hadn't even noticed it had a cupboard. "It's great, but I can't see how–"
Sherlock breathed out, sitting down. Mycroft would've told him he should've known he was under the stairs –he'd been given a tour in the house. Mycroft would've called him unobservant.
Holmes didn't reply and they didn't talk about his brother or freeing slaves again. He behaved well that week. Whether it was because of Lestrade's influence or because he'd met his brother, John didn't know. Perhaps it was just that he was busied and thrilled by their move to Baker Street. It added to his good mood that his commuting pass was ready.
The slave smiled politely, bowed at John from the waist and disappeared into the black vehicle that immediately steered away. The odd encounter hadn't taken even five minutes, and he could still see the lights of the police cars. Whoever they had been, they were gone now. John was left with yet more questions about the mysterious inquiries after his slave, and zero answers.
John's temporary job came to an end, and he marked the occasion with a nice hot bath. It was good to have a proper sized bathroom. Harry might laugh, but few things were better than a dim lit bathroom and a warm bath. Even better when the dim light was provided by tea lights on a dinner plate (on the toilet lid, but best ignore that) and soft melodies drifted beyond the ajar door to his bedroom. After moving to Baker Street, Holmes had finally given a sample of his violin skills. It had been by John's request, though he thought it odd Holmes hadn't asked himself. Having now heard him play, John assured him he could play any time unless told otherwise. Holmes was pleased by his praise and confessed he'd been unsure whether his master would like the playing, and so had only played in John's absence. Since then John had caught him fiddling it deep in thought. The noises he produced with the instrument weren't exactly music, but they weren't unpleasant.
indicate protection of some kind and he didn't like what that suggested. He already had one owner and John certainly wasn't the shooter.
wants to buy me."
Sherlock opened his eyes, inclining his head to get a better look at him, but did not get up from the sofa. "Yes, John?"
John looked at the business card in his hand, contemplating whether to just throw it away. He didn't want to worry Holmes with it. He'd done some thinking after talking with Mike. Perhaps Holmes behaved the way he did because he was insecure. So many owners seemed to have abandoned or mistreated him. No wonder he didn't feel comfortable with yet another new owner. Slaves were like pets in that sense. If they were mistreated they couldn't trust their owners. Perhaps Holmes's behaviour would improve if John showed him he would be treated well and be cared for. It might make things worse if Holmes had a reason to believe John might get rid of him because he had been offered money.
The driver sighed. “There are several on this route, there’s one driving right before me, you just missed it.”
"Pity she didn't agree to go out with you," came a dry reply.
"You don't believe me," he stated. "Let's make a simple test then. If you could free me, right now, would you?"
"Yes. They were... They were good to me."
He smirked. "Well, ending up like
Holmes took a deep breath and breathed out slowly before repeating in a much calmer tone: "My purpose is to serve."
John wetted his lips and straightened his back. "My father was charged for beating up a slave to death. He was drunk."
John's words hit like a slap on the face.
"We share some common history."
"Yes what?" The master leant closer.
Holmes didn't say anything for the rest of their dinner apart from thanking him yet again after he was done. John stared at his blog in an attempt to write a new entry, but ended up deleting each sentence he managed to start. In the end he just re-read all his previous entries, if they could have even been called that, and made a new entry with a single line:
"Revenge?" Holmes laughed mockingly. "Why would she write an angry message in German while she's dying? She scratched that with her nails while
Sherlock rolled on his stomach and stayed rebelliously silent.
"Like you didn't kill those four people before me?"
Sherlock's eyes averted. The slave in him resurfaced, triggered by such a simple remark. For a sickening moment, he felt he should bow down his head. Like he should be kneeling on the floor instead of sitting here. He used the moment to dig the gloves from his pockets as if that was why he looked away.
John shook his head. "Go to sleep," he repeated.
"You missed your appointment with your therapist, master", Holmes informed him as he served the breakfast. "She tried calling you several times."
He stroked the inner side of his left wrist where he knew the tattoos to be. 99OR-79/3J3A. Such an innocent series of numbers and letters, yet they had the power to rob away his humanity.
John looked at him with an unreadable expression before suddenly standing up. "I'll cancel the stag do," he said.
"Is there anything else I can do, mistress?" he inquired, standing straight, head slightly bowed, eyes cast down and hands brought together in front of him. A picture-perfect slave.
The money, the money...something about the money. Someone paying, a sponsor. Why a sponsor? Fan of him, fan of murder –no! Not relevant, not now. The money, where does it –of course!
, first and foremost," John nearly growled at them. "He knows where I want the line drawn."
“No slaves on the bus”, the driver called, his voice dull and monotone, as if it was something he had to repeat at every second stop.
Awkward silence fell into the room. At least it felt awkward for John up until Holmes's stomach growled loudly. The slave bit his lip and looked away. He was tired and hungry. He hadn't dared to sleep should he not wake up before his owner, and the only thing he'd had to fill his stomach was water. Even that he hadn't drank much so that he wouldn't need to use the toilet later. While he didn't think master Watson to be anything like his seventh owner had been, he still didn't know him well enough to say for sure how he would act when angered enough. And tonight had not been the night he wanted to find out if something like flushing a toilet in the middle of the night was something to make him snap. He'd been extremely careful with the tap and shower, too, using only minimal amount of water to not make any noise.
"Sister. I've a sister", dumbfounded John corrected. "Why would you accuse me of that? How
"You should've seen the others," Holmes muttered when John commented on it. He was hungover himself and would've gone straight to bed had John allowed it. Instead John ordered him to shower and sit down at the kitchen table.
"The victims didn't know each other, they were all found in random, empty places they had no reason to go to. None of them had a reason to commit suicide and all of them were taken from crowded places and/or only moments after having talked with someone they knew."
"What's what?"
"Not at you, you idiot!" John snapped. "I'm angry at myself for letting this happen. I'm furious that this happened to you."
sentiment. They just happened to be good at hiding his stigma.

His reasons were always the same. He wished to communicate and meet with "other slaves" as he himself put it. So far he had managed to arrive back punctually only once. At best, he was late by anything between five minutes to half an hour. At worst –hours. The record so far was over eight hours and the only explanation John got was "I lost the track of time". Holmes's GPS record revealed him going all across London and beyond, and often to completely different places he'd said he was going. How exactly he did that, John had no idea. Holmes swore he was not using John's money. Every time John asked, the only offered explanation was "plans changed" and stoic submission to any discipline John deemed proper. They'd worked out a system for that by now.
