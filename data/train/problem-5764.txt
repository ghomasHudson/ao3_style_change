Tony nodded. “Honestly I think I got things on this end if you wanna go help run interference for Bruce. I feel so bad that he’s mixed up in this.”
He wasn’t just being nice. His own cock was aching hard and he was still a hedonist with a tiny attention span.
Tony felt his smile go all lopsided as he tried to figure out how to stop the pleasant smalltalk and get down to the heavy stuff considering he didn’t want to do either. He sighed.
“It makes you seem like you’re bored of everything and not taking coming out seriously. And you can’t risk looking like that this time.” Nat explained.
Tony shifted to hold all his weight on one arm and brought the other hand back to rest on the small of his back. It was shaking visibly. “I’m not nervous. I do trust you. I just feel better if I have something to hold onto. Makes it easier to relax. So go as hard as you want, I can take it, but help me hold my hand still.”
It was pretty obvious that both of them were having freakouts on their own. Thankfully, Steve had something to remedy that, which meant Bucky was wrong about it looking like business.
The line was silent for some long moments, and Steve couldn’t help picturing Bucky blinking at the receiver. Finally he said,
Steve looked to Natasha for confirmation, and she shrugged in agreement. Steve sat at his drafting desk and let his head lull back as he spun around in the chair.
Sam gave him a sincere, wistful smile. Then, as if to cut the tension he grinned and asked. “Are you sure he’s not just on cocaine? I hear you gotta test these rich dudes.”
A little woman with silver hair and crinkled eyes came quietly from the back room, answering in some tripping language Steve didn’t immediately recognize. She looked at Steve and nodded, glancing at Tony and offering a string of approving-sounding words. Tony laughed. She looked back at Steve and by way of explanation said in a thick eastern european accent,
“I didn’t know if the plan would even work. I just tried to set it up as best as I could, and I don’t even have combat experience. It was sheer luck that it worked.”
They danced until the song ended, and said goodbye with a long kiss at the door. Once Steve was in bed, he called Natasha needing a bit of support. He always became a bit depressed when he talked about his mom, but he just hoped that she was looking down on him and proud of him.
“Yeah, let’s hope.” Steve placed a gentle kiss on Tony’s forehead and sat next to him on the hospital bed. “Definitely one of the more eventful Christmases of my life.”
Tony smiled back, feeling some of the tension evaporate. “Well, I didn’t have a lot I had to do today, and I realized I really need to-.” He noticed another guy at the dining table. “Oh, hi. Damn, I hope I didn’t crash the party.” He gave the guy a small wave.
“You act like it didn’t happen, and the media might love that you’re human. Jennifer Lawrence fell at the Oscars, but everyone was okay with it.”
Tony stepped up and moved to give Steve a little kiss on the cheek. “You’re too good to me. So how’s your day been?”
Bucky had a thought. “Maybe you could have a code word. With Tony. Like you gave me back when I was just out of the hospital. Something to let him know if you’re in trouble and can’t think.”
“I guess… I’ll wait for him to call or something. I don’t want to make him think he can keep sending me stuff like this.”
“You know what? He’s your Soulmate. Whatever you think is right probably is.” He headed to the kitchen to make a sandwich.
“Well, you made Natasha, a human froot loop, and I’m assuming Charles Xavier listen to you and work together. That’s not nothing.”
Steve immediately went to the hospital after Nat told him where Tony was being taken. He didn’t even need to ask which room he was in, he just followed the Soulmate bond straight to him. By the time he got there, Tony was being bandaged up for what looked like electrical burns and Steve’s heart broke. Tony looked like he’d been to hell and back with burns, cuts, bruises, even a black eye. Maybe he’d take up Natasha’s offer on killing Stane after all.
Tony leaned back on the edge of the cutting table and watched his two fairy godmothers pluck and fuss with his gorgeous guy. They had Steve turn, and Tony caught his breath as he caught the contour of Steve’s ass in dress pants. He grinned to himself and pulled his hand down over his mouth, muttering, “We are gonna break the internet.”
Bucky tried not to pay too much attention to how angry he felt, and his lack of a strictly rational reason. It definitely seemed to want to walk and quack like a kind of jealousy. Steve was his best friend. And this rich guy thought that he could just… he didn’t even know what. In his place. Over his shop. Like he could just walk in and leave his great big mark wherever he wanted. He paced the apartment, trying to calm down.
“I won’t. Promise. I won’t go after the people in your past if you don’t go after the people in mine. I will, of course, be a good boyfriend, and if we ever move in together I’ll give you equal access to all the resources I have in case
“Jeez, man. Operative word there being ‘person’. Come on. No, I’m not planning on ‘showing’ any people like some kind of pet.”
Steve smiled. “It was nice. No one knew where we were, so there weren’t any reporters. I know it sounds crazy, but whenever Tony had time to come see me, it almost felt like
Steve chuckled. “Well, I think Patrick is scared shitless to approach me on a subway platform again.”
Surprisingly Bucky grinned at that rather than shooting Clint a dirty look, which was their usual routine. He looked sheepishly at Steve.
“The number doesn’t bother me. I guess I’m just worried I won’t be as good as them. I mean, we’re not to that point yet, but I’m not even that experienced to begin with. I don’t want him to be disappointed.”
Tony shook his head. “I’m sorry, I don’t understand what that means well enough to speak with authority. I realize I’m being a total engineer right now but… no. I’ve never arranged my life like that and I have… “ He stopped himself and took a moment to figure out if it would be a disaster to be honest. “I’ve tended to avoid people that do. For their sake as well as my own. Because I don’t understand why it bothers you all, I just know that it does and for some reason it’s my fault.”
Tony smirked, but not unkindly. “Whatever it is that’s blocking up your head right now. It’s two in the afternoon, I haven’t done anything to warrant a hangover, but I feel like my brain isn’t working. I assume that’s coming from you.”
“I’ve dealt with criticism like that my whole life. I’ve been told by every person imaginable that I’m not who I believe I am, or that I’m going to hell for who I date. I’ve been called every name possible for someone like me, before and after I transitioned. So you need to believe me when I tell you I don’t care about them, and that you are worth it.”
Tony leaned into Steve’s side and went on scrolling through his music. “I was just thinking. Wondering really. If you liked to dance.”
Tony gave an awkward little wave and headed for the stairs. He skipped up to street level two at a time, pretty sure that he was falling hard.
“Ok, well it sounds like you guys have some stuff to talk about so I’ll get out of here.” He glanced at Steve. “See you this weekend, Steve.” He made a couple second’s significant eye-contact with Tony and let himself out.
“Hey, man, you said you could handle the pressure. This is practically training-wheels day. Be strong!” Tony called to Steve’s vanishing back.
Right there in his hands was one of the paintings Steve had seen in his art appreciation book. It was Toulouse-Lautrec’s painting of two androgynous figures kissing on a bed, signed and in its post-impressionistic glory. Steve had to set it down because his hands were so shaky and he didn’t want to drop it. He didn’t even know what this painting
“Yeah but this is supposed to be my interrogation and you just made it all about you. I think being lavished with attention and gifts is finally going to your head. Which, I gotta say, it’s about time.”
“I guess you could say that the goal was to have one part of my life without a goal. Your turn. Does that make you uncomfortable?”
Tony grinned. “The second time was far more literal. I got caught in a closet. At a party. With press.”
Steve blushed and Lucinda laughed. “Let the professional see what’s best. I’ve surprised you before with my selections, haven’t I?”
“I really don’t… I swear I’m not trying to be evasive, I’m just worried I’m gonna leave something out that you think counts and then you’re going to think I lied to you when the fact is… I’m just from a different planet, ok? I just don’t work like that. I can’t. I can’t put people in categories about… who they are to me. I know faces and names and everyone’s different.”
“I wasn’t sure how spicy you like it, so I got kind of an assortment. It’s all still a little on the spicy side, though.”
“Okay.” Steve thought for a moment, then asked. “I know this seems weird to ask, but… how many people has Tony slept with?”
Steve could feel Tony clench around him, and his own orgasm was just out of reach. So he quickly sat up, wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, and started thrusting up into him with reckless abandon. It was as if his orgasm was taunting him by not finally happening.
Steve smiled and nodded at Bucky. Once Bucky had left the apartment, it left Steve with Clint, who was on his phone. Which meant Steve could do some interrogating like a good friend does.
Tony flicked his tongue out to impudently taste Steve’s head without permission. “I’m gonna get myself all ready for you, so you can fuck me as hard as you want.” He pried a little bottle of lube from the space between the mattress and the bed frame. “if that’s what you want.”
Steve chuckled and took Tony’s hand as he got up. “I’m too small to lead, I don’t mind.” He wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and laid his head on his shoulder. “I also don’t mind being taken care of every now and again, for all of my stubbornness.”
“And I don’t think I have to tell you that if you hurt Bucky, I’ll rearrange your face so it’s unrecognizable. And so will Natasha.”
Tony decided this was the time to finally turn his company around. Once everything was put together, Tony worked around the clock to shut down the weapons branches, and open up new branches for SI. He made sure to give everyone employed the option to move to the new branches via training and transfers, and paid those who didn’t fairly. Tony’s first idea was
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Yes. Because you haven’t reminded us in three whole minutes. Look, if you don’t wanna look like a guy who’s obsessed with how you look, stop obsessing about how you look. It’s not hard.”
“That’s not exactly what I wanted to talk about.” Steve gripped a bit tightly onto the velvet box behind his back. “Tony, you are probably the most amazing man I have ever met. You’re kind, you’re a genius, you find solutions rather than focus on problems too long. When I first drew that sketch of the paint job you wanted… I was scared shitless because I thought some random Stark Industries rep was my Soulmate. Then Bucky told me it was you, and I almost thought about ignoring it. Then we made our mistakes, and we finally met.
And then a horrible thought occurred: what if Tony was trying to buy his affection? He’d heard some things where Tony did that in the past, so it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility.
Once inside, she told the head security guard to try and get the paparazzi off of the property. They didn’t need employees’ access to their job impeded by vultures.
Steve chuckled. “I think I can determine that for myself when we meet. Then you should know about me that I’m incredibly stubborn and if I see someone doing something to someone else, I’ll always try to step in. That usually results in some bruises and the occasional broken nose, so I hope you’re ready for getting calls from an ER every now and again.”
Tony strolled into Ferrara’s, hands in the pockets of his hoodie. He’d agonized about how far down to dress to keep from attracting attention, and the last-second check of his low-key casual look in the shop window wasn’t leaving him any surer of his choices. But at least it was objectively comfortable.
Tony took the porch stairs in a leap and knocked on the door. Then he wiped his palms on his jeans for the fifth time in ten minutes.
“Well sure I did. I’m not an ogre. I mean ‘all those people’ is a pretty big category, and sometimes we would just meet at a party and maybe catch breakfast the next morning but… I mean, I never went to bed with anyone who wanted more than a good time from me, if that’s what you mean. I don’t wine and dine gullible young college students with big promises and flashy gifts and then break their hearts. I go to bed with people that like to go to bed without worrying about a lot of social calculus.”
Tony smiled but didn’t answer, continuing to flip through. “So you keep mentioning ‘issues’. You mind if I ask? Your feet flat or something? I mean, if it’s none of my business, I get it.”
Tony heaved a deep sigh. “He’s just told me some stuff about his life. Stuff that nobody should care about but could get him eaten alive.”
Steve’s eyes widened at the amount of food Tony sat on the table. “I can definitely see why you decided on a painting now. And I’ll take the second choice.”
Tony’s eyebrows went up and he gave a low whistle. “Then I apparently need to keep buying you dinner until I can wheedle your skin care regimen out of you.” He grinned.
Tony nodded and pushed up onto his extended arm to let Steve rest on his back a little and cranes his head around for a sidewards kiss. “I’ll give you anything you want, sexy. You know I Latrec on the first date.”
Steve really thought for a moment about a possible code word. It definitely had to be something that wouldn’t be randomly brought up in casual conversation, but also not too out of left field. After a few moments, he came up with,
Steve nodded, doing his best to understand. “Then let’s just do who you felt romantically attached to. Does that make it easier?”
“Nat’s been sending me updates on everything. Apparently she’s already had to turn away five reporters that got passes from entering your office. She said they’d lied saying they wanted to interview you about the BMW-Stark engine, but she could tell what it really was.”
“See there you go again. You bring this stuff up then act like it’s not you doing it. You’ve got issues, Rogers.” Tony gave Steve an affectionate half-hug. The party was going great, and he hadn’t even felt like drinking.
Tony knows of course that his father never stopped sending expeditions into the ice, that he searched on year after year. He thinks that it was perhaps that, which made Howard so bitter. Sometimes it’s easiest to accept a death immediately. Sometimes hope is worse than certainty.
What – who he also recognises, is Captain Steve Rogers, alias Captain America. Tony stares a good 20 minutes at the picture of the blonde bombshell, who could be a model from the last cover of the magazine Out. Just like in the comics and in Dad’s old pictures, and completely different at the same time. The Tesseract was a side matter for a while.
the guy my Dad wouldn’t shut up about?” he says to Bruce, the only person with any sense on this ship. He doesn’t know what he should find worse: That he had to measure himself up to this showboat or that he himself once admired him.
It will take a while until he can accept Captain America, maybe he’ll always remain the red rag to Tony’s bull – but
Manhattan has been reduced to rubble. Tony doesn’t dare to look up at Stark Tower, because he knows exactly how frayed his Baby must look. (Pepper’s Baby, he corrects himself, at least twelve to fifteen percent Pepper’s Baby as well.)
Coulson didn’t have any living relatives, yet a lot of his colleagues respected and admired him. The seats are full of his SHIELD co-workers, the Avengers sit gathered in the first row and further back is – surprisingly – the cellist from Portland.
Captain America is a command-horny, pretentious puppet on steroids. At least that’s what Tony tries to convince himself as he bangs out one insult after the other and tries to crack the shell of America‘s golden boy. And it’s easy, so easy, because Rogers, Cap, is outraged over simply everything Tony does. It’s as if Tony’s whole existence is already too much for him.
Howard doesn’t have to sound it out, Tony can read through the lines: Captain America was one of those kids.
Agent Coulson (Tony refuses to call him Phil) brings him the data on the Avengers Initiative, on SHIELD, on the Tesseract. He recognises the blue cube immediately – his father’s notes were vague and extremely mysterious, even so, they alone were enough to make it clear how powerful this object must be.
“Steve – Captain America - had one exactly like it. He was a hero,” says Howard with a smile that Tony doesn’t understand. His Dad looks proud – but how can he look so sad at the same time?
Obie is a bit greasy, a bit too avuncular, but it’s alright. He brings Tony things from the science lab which he would otherwise never get his hands on. When his parents don’t appear at his graduation ceremony, Obie stands in the front row and afterwards buys him a bottle of whisky. Tony is only seventeen, but they both find that he’s earned it today.
Tony gets his first Captain America shield when he’s three years old: a small, hand-painted thing made from a light metal – not bigger than a record, because Maria insists that everything else would be too dangerous. Tony is too small, too young, and doesn’t know the meaning of the star or the name behind it, but his
. Really.” He answers, therefore again, with emphasis, because he isn’t in the mood for this discussion. (Strictly speaking, he never is, but Steve doesn’t need to know that. Not yet.)
The words almost fall out of his mouth, like so many things he spouts, unfiltered and un-thought out. He thinks better of it in the last moment and calls Captain America a lab rat.
“Oh, that,” Tony says, and tries not to swallow too obviously, before he waves it off. “Forget it. We were all a bit cranky, weren‘t we? Deranged God of lies on board, sceptre with an otherworldly energy source and all that stuff. People’s emotions already boil over with all that. Or in Banner’s case cell structure too.”
At once he begins to feel doubt, he feels just as foolish as back then. Maybe it was a stupid idea after all. But then Steve stands beside him and takes the trading cards out of his breast pocket.
After the accident, Tony has the crazy idea (and it’s born from the alcohol really, because he’s absolutely smashed at the time) to build his father a Captain America shield. Something that he can lay on the coffin or in his grave – whichever, it’s not like Tony has any idea how that sort of thing works. He just has the idea that it would be something Howard would’ve liked. Would’ve meant something to him, because Cap meant something to him. A last big gesture after his death, because despite everything, Howard is – was – his Dad, and Tony wouldn’t hate him so much if he hadn’t at one point loved him a lot.
Steve looks relieved in a disgustingly sympathetic way, and the fold on his forehead dissolves. Tony tries to ignore his feelings of emerging affection as much as possible, which isn’t difficult, because he’s
“When I grow up, I’m going to become Captain America too.” Tony says at eight years of age, when Howard’s attention is becoming more and more sporadic and no more new stories of Steve Rogers have come to his mind for a long time already.
“Cap would never have done that,” says Howard, and Tony cannot come to believe that, even if Cap had done it – Howard would have forgiven him for it all.
Tony throws the shield and all the comics that his Dad has ever given him out of the window. Maria lets Jarvis collect everything together again and put it back in boxes in Tony’s bedroom, but he vehemently ignores their existence and never touches them again. At some point they end up in the attic and get forgotten.
When Tony turns ten years old, Howard has had enough and sends him to a boarding school. His parting words before Jarvis brings him to the bus are: “Be thankful. Kids back then would never have been able to afford such a chance.”
On the few occasions an adult is needed (when Tony blows something up, or gets into wild parties) people get used to sending Obadiah Stane for him.
The funeral is terrible and reminds him of all the people that he’s outlived without deserving to (Dad, Mom, Jarvis, Yinsen, so many more, and now Phil too).
Tony doesn’t know till this day if it’s really a compliment which Howard Stark had in mind, or just arrogant self-praise, or both. Either way, he’s thankful that at least this one time, Captain America doesn’t have the edge on him.
To a certain extent, Tony and his Dad talk to each other much more often, even if most of the time it’s only about how severely he’s disappointed Howard. Captain America goes on to remain a topic, this time as a model, as a warning, as leverage, in order to give Tony a guilty conscience.
Stevens gets a hand on Potts, palming him through his slacks, and Potts is about to object to coming in his pants when he’s suddenly spun around and shoved against the door, sending a dustpan clattering to the floor, and god, this should have been his plan all along, because Stevens looks so damn good on his knees. Potts reaches out and grips his hair, messing it up the second he touched it.
Steve needed to flirt with unsavoury people for his job, Tony knows that, all of them do. Doesn’t mean he has to like it.
“You’re good, you’re… really good,” Tony says, once he catches his breath. He finally does get the name of the man in a black turtleneck: Steve. He’d told him in between sucking bruises against his collarbone, like something to be forgotten the next morning… which… yeah, that’s fair.
Steve looks hopelessly lost for a moment, “Tonight, at the bar with Johnny... I know I cleared it with you but if you really don’t--”
The guy laughs, caught off-guard, almost like he’s forgotten himself, “Tony Stark,” he admits, the way one would have to disclose a criminal record, proffering his hand, manicured, ringless. Steve takes it, lingering slightly longer than one would necessarily consider ‘friendly’.
Even further behind Nick is another man, around Tony’s age, in a three-piece he knew Tony would have appreciated. No tie, of course. Earlier, Alfred had held up two different ones that would have matched perfectly. He’d almost cried then.
Carol nods as Nat reminds the officer to go get her fictional partner. She hears a loud snap from behind Carol and she mutters “Thirty seconds.”
Steve watches the nano-suit wrap around Tony’s body, entranced by the way the red and gold metal cling to his body. Before he knows it, Tony’s three inches away from him and he’s looking up into the armour’s eyes. Up.
Tony takes a second to process everything that just came out of his mouth, and Steve takes his silence as rejection, or contempt.
So instead he made a stupid joke. The type that you would only find even the slightest bit funny if you had been awake for over a day and now found yourself in a situation where time moved like sticky sweet syrup, where urgency had never bothered to be invented, where you’re so drunk on intimacy and love you can barely see what’s ahead of you, and honestly, in that moment, in the moment where nothing else exists and it feels like the world was made for you and for them and for you to be together in that moment, you can’t care that you can’t see what’s looming ahead.
It makes him want to mess him up in the way that would land him with a dishonourable discharge. Or the hospital, if the pristine uniform gave anything away.
Tony laughs, “That was my goal, sweetheart,” he says, brushing back Steve’s hair. He’s so rarely like this - pliant and lethargic, and the wonder never passes over Tony’s head that he gets to see Steve Rogers like this, because of him.
“Sure. Just a little sus’ that you’re making a social call less than a week after Rogers’ got out, don’t you think?”
Just before their flight for LA leaves, Steve finds a payphone to call his probationary officer, gesturing for Nat to go on ahead.
“That was fun,” Tony says, mildly, when he catches his breath and his pleasure fades into a pleasant, hazy glow.
Peggy tells him to socialise, as he will, eventually, have to go back to the States and start his job. Apparently, being cultured is somewhat important for a liberal arts professor.
“Okay,” Peter says, after giving Bucky the rundown of Loki’s entire day. The kid’s green, like pastures-in-the-countryside, hex code 00FF00,
Steve turns his head to press a kiss to Tony’s shoulder, murmuring, “I love you,” back, finally, finally settled, in mind, body and soul.
Steve knows it's a bad choice of words and a bad choice of phrase as soon as he says it, he could play the
Scanning the room he’s currently in - modern art - his eyes catch on a guy wearing sunglasses and a tailored suit (that’s really,
Unfortunately, the effects of the gas stayed. Clark has been fully prepared for a spiel about engineering he had maybe twenty percent chance of understanding (his engineering knowledge extends to old tractors and whatever Bruce likes to talk about when he’s stressed), he hadn’t, however, been expecting a long unbroken stream of pure Tony ‘legally certified genius with many many PhDs’ Stark thought on the paradoxical nature of his bone structure.
As efficiently as he can, Steve tugs on his civilian clothes: suit jacket, suit pants, white shirt, no tie, top two buttons undone, and wingtips. There’s no mirror, but he still stands with his shoulders back and straightens out the cuffs - the old skin feels good, if a little loose. He contemplates wearing the ring - he should want to start a new life, a clean life, maybe helping troubled youths reform, maybe reconciling with Tony, he shouldn’t wear it: rings are often far too symbolic for their own good.
“You’re not even a felon and you choose to spend your time here,” Steve spits back, squinting up at them, “finally shifted the stick from your ass?”
“Sir? The lounge at the Grand gets busy around 1, if you’re interested,” Natasha tells him with a smile.
“But… this just feels… kind of weird. We haven’t even met yet, and he sent me this painting. It kind of feels like he’s trying to buy me or something.”
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair with a groan. “And you know I use it with clothes on. So get the - mm -
Steve really thought for a moment. Was it about the number? Or about how insecure he was? Tony was an amazing guy, and he didn’t even care about Steve’s gender identity. He actually wanted to have sex with him last night, despite the fact that Steve wasn’t wearing a binder or packer. He sighed.
Steve took a step forward and hugged Tony like he did earlier, which was safer. He realized he really liked hugging Tony. It felt familiar but alien at the same time.
different. He’d take me to restaurants, sometimes buy me a gift, but never wanted to do anything sexual. I figured it was a nice change from my first relationship so I went with it… until I saw him on campus two months into our relationship. I saw him holding hands with a girl, acting romantic with her, and I confronted him about it. He acted like he had no idea what I was talking about, and I ended up leaving him. Apparently his parents were the old-school Mexican Catholic types, and if they found out he was dating me, they’d disown him. I was basically his dirty little secret.”
Pepina nodded and murmured something as she took his coat and laid it out on a table. She looked back at him and said,
As they got into the elevator, Natasha got a text. “Bruce is apparently being harassed at work. He’s already scared three reporters off.”
Tony sighed. “Sending security would just look weird. Tell him I’ll do my best to be super interesting today. I’ll hang out by the window with the blinds up, I’ll have half an intriguing cell phone conversation where they might be able to read my lips. That should keep them busy, give campus security a chance to catch up.”
When Tony handed Steve the harness, Steve immediately went to the bathroom and tried to be as quick as possible with switching everything out. He managed to get his shoe covered feet out of his pants and boxers without tripping. Then he put the packer over the rod sensor, and put the harness on itself. Since Tony had tinkered with it, he could feel that there was an air flow as soon as it was put into place. He got on his boxers, but put the packer through the front fly, and exited the bathroom.
The investigation and court hearings against Stane went by incredibly quickly. The video Domino found helped, so did the testimonies of the X-Men and X-Force. Going through Stane’s financial records, it revealed that he had been embezzling money for decades, even when Howard was alive. So not only was he charged with crimes like attempted murder and kidnapping, but also embezzlement.
The tangled and ripped sheets, the damp, sweaty patches all over the pillow. Bucky could envision what had transpired simply by the scene that greeted him. He swallowed the lump that was rising in his throat.
His dick swelled, glazing Steve’s puckering hole with his precum, until he rammed it back in, stealing a short grunt from Steve’s glazed lips. Steve felt the building pleasure pooling inside his belly, threatening to burst free.
Steve was starting to become highly uncomfortable under the shorter man’s scrutiny. This Tony was unpredictable and as a tactician, Steve didn’t like his odds at all. He missed his Tony. He tried to keep his posture strong and his head held high. He sure wasn’t going to give Tony the satisfaction of thinking that this was acceptable. The silence was killing him. He wished Tony would talk, put him out of his misery, so to speak.
As Steve was about to let himself be carried into unconsciousness, the hand at his throat suddenly vanished, air rushing into his lungs, famished. Tony’s last order hovered like a whisper in his mind, but he didn’t question it. He let his moist lips part loosely.
Tony prompted himself onto his knees above that heaving chest, leaving Steve’s hole gaping and twitching. Tony wanted to mark him as his own and he would do so. Steve would feel him forever. He would leave a mark so deep on his soul, it would stay like a stain. Like the one that matched Stark’s own.
‘Here,’ Maria interjected in their playful quarreling, handing a large brown envelope to Steve. ‘These are your fake identities and documents. Since none of you are quite adept at undercover missions, we made sure to make them as close as to your actual names as possible to avoid unnecessary detection…’
His clothes were in shambles, but at least he could pretend it was from a fight. He made short work of his pants after he put on his blue shirt. His hands passed through his hair, slicking it back. His heavy steps alerted Tony that he was up. He swore he saw Tony jump and tense.
“I tend to assume they’re telling me because they want me to know. Usually when they want me to know, it’s because they think I might be trying to make up my mind. Usually I’m not.”
Clint got up and went to the sink to start some dishes that looked like they’d been sitting. “Me neither. But he did.” He dropped his voice and said in a breathy gasp. “For
Tony raised a hand in reply. He gestured at the counter with his thumb, then pointed at Steve in question. He repeated the gesture a couple times
“Ok, well, media handler playbook says to wait a couple weeks then attend something publicly with Steve. Control the narrative, you know? And my mom’s annual gala falls at just the right time to catch the social and entertainment news cycle on a slow week. It seems kinda perfect, but I was dancing with Steve last night and now I don’t know.”
Natasha, of course, had noticed Tony’s change in attitude. She also kept track of all of his calls, so she knew he was doing a bit of stalking about the painting (which she of course told Clint about, but not Bucky because then he’d tell Steve). She hadn’t thought it was good to say that the painting was a bad idea since Tony didn’t ask, and from the way Bucky sounded on the phone, she had been right. She went down to the workshop to do her usual check-up on Tony and saw probably five different half built machines that hadn’t been there a week before. Well, she couldn’t stay quiet now, Tony was worrying enough to come up with things that didn’t even matter. And was that a
“Um… that’s…” He put his phone on mute for a second, took a deep breath, and unmuted it. “Then… let’s do a proper meeting. Where we get coffee or something and talk face to face.”
“Goddammit! How many one night stands has he had, Jarvis!? I feel like you’re being intentionally dumb!”
Steve lead them inside and shut the door. “Filled with physics equations I barely understand, but also sketches I could easily do.”
Steve backed up and wiped his eyes on his hand. “How are you on good terms with Professor Xavier anyway?”
“Best not to risk pictures of me and you if things are that crazy.” Steve said as he went to the couch.
“Get out of my office before you make up more excuses that I’ll debunk. Just ask, and you’ll have your answer. Anxiety is really not good for your heart rate.”
Steve laughed but shifted Tony off of him fully. As he guessed, there was a large wet spot between his legs, and in his underwear.
“Well, I’ll get to see you in a tuxedo instead of a business suit, so I’ll say yes now and save us the trouble.”
A blush creeped onto Steve’s cheeks and he looked down at his shoes. He wasn’t used to being complimented like this. It was… nice.
“Sounds like somebody needs a sabbatical.” He leaned one hip on Bruce’s desk and put down the box he’d brought with him. “Thought you should get a little swag since your life’s been turned into a red carpet walk.”
Steve was at the coffee shop he was supposed to meet Tony at. It honestly made him feel a bit sad that their coffee date never happened, but he would survive. Like he thought before, Tony Stark had nothing to lose if things went South with him-.
“Yeah. But I’d rather take the subway to get wherever we’re going. I just don’t want any fancy treatment before we… figure things out, I guess.”
“Um… I… guess…?” Steve awkwardly got up, and felt uncomfortable but also excited at the same time. Gently, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s torso and swore he was as red as a tomato as he did it. And he actually felt safe when Tony wrapped his arms around his shoulders. And wow did he smell nice.
“So it makes them feel like when people think they know Daily Vloggers, even though it’s incredibly edited down.”
Tony nodded. “And yet I’m sufficiently intimidated. Still, someone should warn him that if there’s ever a kick-my-ass conga line, he better not try to line-jump Natasha.”
“Do you want to look at my sketches?” He asked as he held the small sketchbook up. “It’s usually a good ice breaker.”
Tony groaned appreciatively as Steve shook and slowed. He squeezed his wrist again. “Do you want me to finish? I don’t mind if you’d rather get back. I know parties make you nervous.”
“Well… I do know one thing that would make me happy.” He said with a smirk. “And it’s the reason I wore Buster instead of my usual tonight.”
Steve raised an eyebrow, but let it go. Now wasn’t the time to bring up how strangely informed Clint was with the subject. Steve could do this. He could make a good first impression. At least he didn’t have the money to buy a multi-million dollar painting and send it to Tony.
Tony let his spine sway like a charmed snake and moaned a gentle encouragement as Steve indulged in touching him as he moved. Once he had his balance and his rhythm and Steve seemed settled in to enjoy, he let his own hand stroke down his cock. He was so twanging-hard he just wanted to tease himself with light touches that meandered down to behind his balls. He loved to feel how Steve stretched him, how being filled and fucked helped to press his prostate down into a subtle swell that he could feel through his skin.
“Hello, Ms. Barnes,” Tony called from under a half-finished mark six mechanical assist arm that was turning out as more of an art piece. “What brings you to my cave of wonders?”
Steve chuckled. “I guess one year is a-.” He stopped himself before he could finish his statement, not sure mentioning a strap on was appropriate.
Tony sighed. “Look, when I’m dragging you through my world, it makes sense for me to furnish the trip. You’re doing me a favor by being willing to navigate this nonsense, and I appreciate it. But I wasn’t kidding when I said this was training wheels day. This is as gentle as the embarrassment and objectification is gonna get. Still think you can handle it?”
With a groan, Steve sat up. “Fine, I’ll try my best… but that doesn’t mean I’m not scared shitless of looking stupid.”
“I’m not mad at you, I just… I’d heard you did that for other people and…” What the fuck was he trying to say? Goddammit, Rogers, get it together. “In terms of making a first impression, buying someone an extremely expensive painting isn’t the way to go.”
Knowing how Steve and Bucky met, it kind of made sense that he couldn’t pick it up. “Buck thought I was his Romantic Soulmate when we met, so it makes sense why he didn’t notice.”
Bucky shook his head, still reeling. “Yeah, it definitely feels like that. I mean the only alternative I can think is that he’s an international art thief and wanted to hide this someplace nobody in their right mind would ever look for it. So, yeah, I think you have every right to feel a little
He thinks to himself that if he is just as strong, just as brave as the friend of his father, then maybe they don’t need the Captain and the stories anymore in order to be together. Maybe
Tony feels a disgusting wave of excitement and anxiety course through his body, because his old man was right again and because, soon, he was going to meet the biggest shadow of his childhood.
In Stuttgart and afterwards in the forest, Tony had only seen a small sample of what he really has up his sleeve. Now in Manhattan he gets to see the full show and – wow.
His Dad doesn’t stop working whilst he talks. His voice, the metallic clang of the work tools and the occasional hiss of the blowtorch become a familiar melody to Tony. One which, often enough, lulls him and leaves him falling asleep on the chair in the corner.
“Coulson asked me to,” Steve replies quietly, but collected, whilst he scribbles his signature onto the next card. His handwriting is terribly careful, every letter looks like it’s painted. “I didn’t know him well enough, but it’s something that I can do for him.”
Apologising is a concept that only vaguely applies to Tony’s everyday life and he isn’t awful at it for no reason (see the Strawberry Disaster with Pepper). Regret, guilt, yes, he knows them well, but communicating all that to the outside gives him a headache.
“Good night, Champ,” Tony thinks he hears and falls asleep with the smell of machine oil in his nose.
“Cap would be disappointed in you,” says Howard, even though Cap’s recognition hasn’t been important to Tony for a long time already.
Howard raises an eyebrow, as if he knows exactly what Tony’s intending, and grins anyway, saying: “Just this once more, Champ.”
Tony is too clever for the younger children, too small and thin for the older ones, too peculiar for the ones of his age. He’s not exactly a problem child, but he’s… problematic. Maria calls it headstrong, Howard calls it annoying.
The Captain, Steve, laughs, sincerely relieved, and looks as if he wants to do something touching or embarrassing. Hug him or burst into tears or something. Although Tony would far rather have Pepper nearby right now, it’s okay.
Eventually he chooses ‘JARVIS’ because the old, quirky butler was one of the few people who was actually interested in him.
Tony can’t stop fidgeting, until Pepper takes his right hand. She must notice the chaos in his eyes because she squeezes his fingers once, quickly but comfortingly. Steve, who is sitting to his left, lays his right hand on Tony’s free one and likewise holds it to Tony’s chair. Tony throws him an annoyed look, but at least he can’t fidget so much anymore.
He’s sitting, concentrating, in one of the SHIELD meeting rooms, signing each one of the Captain America trading cards. A few of them are still dark red from Coulson’s – from blood. They always will be. Tony tries not to look too closely.
Tony is a clever child. He quickly learns that Captain America is something that he can always lure his Dad in with, no matter how busy he might be. Even if he’s in the workshop – a place from which Tony’s actually forbidden, and that he’s thrown out of without a word of complaint – he lets himself be won over by the words, “Tell me about Cap.” every time.
Tony has never been so happy to have created JARVIS as he is in this moment. He gratefully accepts the subtle hint and for a moment feels terrible because he didn’t think of it himself, because he
“The Stark Tower is always open for you,” Says Tony, and after a short moment he adds: “Even if it’s big and ugly.”, grinning.
The shield is half finished when it becomes clear to him what he’s doing, what an awkward, crazy idea it is. He’s spent half his life escaping Captain America. Why does he want to do this to himself?
“I’m sorry.” Says – Steve (because Tony somehow can’t see him just as Cap). Around them the clean-up is in full swing and Tony feels profoundly useless. His armour doesn’t want to start anymore and all the older Marks are currently still in Malibu. At the moment he can’t do anything other than stand around and arrange for that a lot of money is sent to the city of New York and its victims.
Nothing good for Steve I tell you! Ahaha. But This time he is done been pushed around. Let's see where that leaves our little Steve.
The noises from the bustling street outside were almost too loud to cover Bucky’s lazy steps currently shuffling around, possibly fumbling with the lock.
In other circumstances, he might have even entertained the idea of giving up control. But now, he hated the prospect of it. Steve’s Adam’s apple bobbed up and down nervously when he heard footsteps slowly approaching, only to stop a few meters away. The vast space around them made them look insignificant.
‘That was then, this is now…’ With his left hand, he firmly pressed down at the soldier’s arched back, stopping his struggles ‘Stay down!…Hmmmm, I dont give a shit about what you want. This is about
‘Really?’ Tony’s eyes were wide in shock and curiosity. Tony briefly wondered if Bucky and Steve had ever experimented, but stopped himself short before he felt the rage consume him.
‘I’ll use you to my heart’s content, so, shut up now so I can fuck you properly,’ a twist of his hips hitting Steve’s sweet spot made the man whimper in defeat.
‘Damn!’ Steve stumbled over his two feet trying to cover up the damning evidence of Tony’s actions and his own humiliation. He would deal with this on his own. There was no way he’d let anyone else deal with this.
In a trance, Bucky trailed a solitary finger over the soiled sheets softly until he reached a dark spot. It was very faint, but it was still present. He’d recognize that lingering smell anywhere.
‘Right…’ Tony managed to chortle out as he stared at the cheap, flimsy bag Cap had slung over his shoulder.
Steve didn’t know how long this went on. Him, with his arm flexed above his head, grasping the curtain bar and the old fabric hanging from them. His back was against the cold glass of the window. A fleeting thought passing through his mind hoped the window would withstand those violent trusts. He could hear cracks, longing for the wall next to them.
‘Morning everyone!’ The billionaire cheerfully announced while he spun his chair around, to sit right next to the internally fuming Captain America.
The pace at which this was going made his heart race into unfamiliar territory. That last pleas simply motivated the dark haired man more; those words making his dick fill with warm blood. It seemed Captain America was starting to understand who held his hypothetical leash. He continued to steal every little sound and murmur from Steve’s sinful orifice.
The soldier’s dark jeans and hoodie hugged his fit body perfectly, just barely damp from the lingering precipitation in the air. His broad shoulders lurched forward, his cap casting a shadow over his red rimmed eyes, as he ambled in the direction of the dimly lit motel.
He took a moment to admire his hard work. Without his stupidly tight uniform to hide the view, Steve was perfection personified. Under his rough ministrations, he could clearly see the Captain’s debauched look and how it affected the other man. Steve’s chest rose and fell in rapid movements, blue eyes avoiding the constant attention afforded to him. If Tony didn’t have such steady self-control, he was pretty sure he would have came at the sight of him.
Tears streamed down Steve’s panic stricken face, his breath coming in short bouts. No coherent words could pass Steve’s lips.
Thank god for the serum and its ability to heal quickly. The fun he would have torturing Steve with this. Tony briefly wondered with every squeeze of his dick if the soldier would remain tight after every session.
‘And as for Steve, his tactical prowess, quick thinking, and his enhanced abilities will come in handy if things go awry. You’ll need to work together for this to work. Steve will be your back-up since you won’t be able to have your Iron Man armor with you.’
‘Sure…Whatever you say, Cap,’ Tony let out with a smile, holding in the angst he so badly wanted to release.
Streaks of light blond in Tony’s hair were reflected by the rays of sunlight.  He looked like a member of a 90’s boy band. The captain wasn’t exactly sure how to feel about it.
Steve’s pleasured face quickly changed to one of agony when Tony’s strokes, not lubricated enough from his precum, started to chaff.
After taking a moment to admire his handiwork, Tony’s fingers laced themselves to the back of Steve’s taut neck and yanked effortlessly so his wet, succulent lips laid at the shell of Steve’s red ear. Steve shivered as hot puffs of air tickled his ear, Tony’s masculine scent enveloping him.
‘I can’t…’ He lowered his head in shame, hiding it from Tony’s burning gaze. The sweet burning pain emanating from the ruffling of the fabric against his painfully erect penis only seemed to make Steve moan louder. His ass finally wide enough to take Tony’s constant plunging. It felt as if is body had accepted his situation before his mind could, bending to every one of Tony’s dangerous whims.
Steve instantly shut up and sat back down, arms folded across his muscular chest, his eyes never leaving the pompous expression plastered across Tony’s face.
While the others simply looked amused at Tony’s tardiness, Steve never missed a beat and kept eyeing the dark-haired man with a venomous glare that could rival Nick Fury’s.
However, the burning tension clustered at Steve’s hunched shoulders was telling. Bucky easily picked it up and tried to approach the issue another way. Steve was clearly avoiding him, ignoring his attempt at humor. The super soldier’s tone was definitely unpleasant.
Detaching himself from Bucky’s friendly touch, Steve quickly headed towards the direction of the unoccupied bathroom only to be thwarted by Bucky’s strong grip on his forearm.
If a few years in the army doing missions taught him anything, it was to never dismiss your gut. And right now, it was screaming.
‘Spread your legs more, soldier…’ Tony’s voice held more weight to Steve this time and he felt a kick behind his shin pushing his legs apart.
‘Well, I’m sure you’ll make up for your inexperience with enthusiasm. Now that the semantics are out of the way, what do you say we get this party started, soldier boy?’
Still, he let the stream of water engulf him in its warmth. It ran in rivulets down the lines of his well-developed frame.
He could hear the other man's calm breathing, yet Tony’s heartbeat rang loudly in Steve's sensitive ears.
Tony once again slapped his ass, his flesh creating small ripples under the constant assault. Every time the flat of Tony’s punishing hand met the curve of Steve’s ass, he heard Tony’s breath hitch in pleasure.
‘Jesus Buck, you don’t get it! You can’t fix this!’ Steve shouted in the direction of a pumped up Bucky.
Each of Tony’s thrusts were shallow and harder than the previous one, stealing moans and soft mewls from Steve’s unwilling mouth.
The gradual descent of Tony’s cum currently leaking from his hole made Steve want to puke as he could sense it soaking through the cheap cotton sheets of the bed. His palms curled into fists at his sides, remembering Tony’s cock inside him, the cruelty of the man’s words cutting deep within his soul.
When Steve came to, it was to an empty and gloomy space. The room was eerily quiet aside from Steve’s own slow breathing. As his blue eyes fluttered open, his vision blurred momentarily, his tired gaze focused its attention on the whiteness of the crumbling plaster ceiling above him.
He thought as he finally noticed he stood alone in the middle of the room. Bruce, Clint and Thor had gone from the premises.
‘T-tony…pl..ease…I’m sorry,’ begged Steve as he twisted his hips. The floor rubbed against his muscular back, scorching it, splinters prickling his skin.
‘Then, talk to me for Christ’s sake. Stop putting everything on your shoulders... This wouldn’t be a fucking problem if you were honest in the first place!’ Bucky yelled back, his tone firm.
Tony fished out another burner phone from his pocket and threw it towards Steve's dark boots on the dusty floor.
Considering the state of his white undergarments and the wet patch that darkened its fabric, his mind reeled as to why he had let himself be overwhelmed by Stark’s sickening touches. He had come, let his senses overtake him. He groaned in pain, his teeth clenched. Tony had gone too far, yet Steve was too shell shocked to properly respond.
‘Jesus..., look at you Rogers… You make me look like a saint in comparison.’ Using his hand to palm at his already bulging erection, he sneered in Steve’s direction.
‘Hey,’ softly asked Bucky, approaching where Steve now sat with bulging eyes and a flushed face. Bucky lifted his arm carefully to appear non threatening.
‘D-Don’t..fuck-ing…tell me what to do!’ Stark shouted, his voice hoarse from the hand clenched around his throat, slowing cutting off his air supply.
Giving a once over to Steve’s disheveled and worn appearance, it looked like Bucky had made the right call to get the coffee.
Whatever had happened last night, whatever caused Steve to be so distant, Tony Stark was responsible for it.
Steve panicked, then bared his teeth at Bucky like a wild cornered animal as he scrambled for any type of leverage in an attempt to mitigate Bucky’s enraged mood.
‘D-Don’t….please…oh…urg.. not, not in..side…J-esus T-tony,’ Steve’s pleas grew louder, forgetting they weren’t the only ones in the room.
And just like that, the bulkier man leaned down to give a chaste kiss on the corner of Tony’s thin lips, which resulted in him being pushed back forcefully.
On that note, for those who stayed enjoy this chapter. the other might take longer to right, but I might be convinced otherwise ahaha
Steve gasped in horror and stilled. Tony, using this moment to sink in deeper, and for a brief second, it looked as if Steve’s body had relented even more. He arched his back, the back of his head tilted, almost hitting Tony’s nose.
‘Arg…’ He couldn’t take back the moan that left his lips and he couldn’t forget the tremors his own dick responded with. If the ground could swallow him up, he would gladly let it.
Steve was startled and let loose a whelp that he wished never made it past his lips. It happened so fast, he almost lost his balance while one of his hands left the hard concrete to cover his mouth. With only one hand holding up their combined weight, coupled with his shocked response, he stumbled forward, losing his grip. He couldn’t help himself as his head leaned back to steal a glance at Tony’s lustful features.
‘Did I tell you to speak? No. I didn’t think so…’ said Tony as he watched Steve close himself once more to him, his defiant glare remaining. ‘And, oh…’
Steve bit back a snarl. Bucky would pay the price for his disobedience or even worse; he would bare witness to Steve’s assault.
Steve wasn’t sure what to make of that, but it gave him hope that at least a small part of Tony cared about him. Steve nodded for him to go on, unsure he could trust what would come out of his mouth.
Steve saw red, his mind blank, only to be filled by rage and a sense of powerlessness. His body carried itself by what could only be described as protective instinct. What rushed towards Tony's baffled face was pure, untamed force.
‘Once at the resort, you’ll be on your own. Get the intel, find the agents, and get out. No heroics. Once you get there, give those names and you’ll be in.’
Hey guys, Here is a bit more character development and introspection on Steve's part. Tony's part will shortly follow.
Steve’s fair skin contrasted so well against Tony’s darker hue. Their sweat mingled to make the sweetest of aromas. Steve felt small against Tony’s chest. Steve’s position laid him bare for Tony to witness, to take it all in.
He barely had time to register what happened next when he felt something bigger press at his aching hole. His eyes grew tenfold, his mouth already pleading with Tony to reconsider, only to have Tony’s spit land perfectly on his flesh before Tony forced his way in.
‘Last thing before we start,’ as Tony appeared to consider his next move. His voice dropped an octave, his expression abruptly switching to something akin to sympathy.
Firstly, I want to say thank you for your kind words. Lately, I had been left with not much desire to write and felt like the quality was inadequate. I might have also written that chapter, like twice. I was really insecure as of late, but your kindness motivated me to write more and continue.
The twitch from Tony's face made his discontent quite apparent. Steve shoved it aside choosing to take a stance. Cooling his temper, he opened his mouth, still finding it hard to voice the words.
Tony pushed into him, their bodies melding together, the dark-haired man’s hold unwavering. The pressure at Steve’s neck increased, razor-sharp nails now burrowing into his bleeding skin.
Now onto Tony's part. Things will only get worse... Please thanks for the comments, ideas and your kudos. I totally am overwhelmed by the love!
‘Don’t you dare go away… you take this! Take what I fucking give you!!!’ Steve’s right leg was flipped over Tony’s muscular shoulder, exposing him further. He angled himself once more at Steve’s wet opening and slid in, the new position affording him a better view of his slick prick going in and out of Steve’s tight hole.
The billionaire had to distance himself from Steve as he felt his heart thud sporadically. Why couldn’t he keep his mouth shut? And judging by the balled fist at his sides, he would keep antagonizing the Captain even further.
The moment grew to a sudden halt the moment the words left the man’s pale lips. Steve’s hand recoiled sharply from Stark’s collar as if he’d been burned.
Again, this was his own damn fault. Tony crushed the tablet in his hand against the wall and howled at the sky, glaring daggers at where Steve once was.  He spat hatefully, his broken laughter echoing within the room, sickening.
Steve did not miss the hidden threat behind Tony's vicious words.  His nerves had him on edge and made him bold. His feet nudged the phone to the side, never leaving Stark's line of sight when the cell left his periphery.
,’ responded a stoic Steven. He lowered his head, his boots suddenly the most interesting thing in this room.
Steve wasn’t surprised that Bucky left, he figured it fell in line with the rest of the friendships he had had, letting someone get closer to him and then pushing them away with his pompous attitude.
Here is the next chapter for this installments. Hope you enjoy the small steps taken by Tony towards the darkness.
The contour of his eyes was marked by the unforgiving hand of restlessness, Steve’s muscles screamed at him as he attempted to prop himself up onto his elbows.
Eventually, his hands became rougher, nearly rubbing the skin raw as he cleansed each area Tony had laid waste to. It wouldn’t go away. The phantom stain remained.
With careful efficiency, Steve started to wash himself, his own palms wandering leisurely over every little blemish that perturbed his porcelain skin.
He growled, ashamed of himself for even thinking about that. Stark had violated him. Twice. Without any hint of remorse. Something had gotten loose and there was no way he could let the man win. Bucky counted on him to be strong, so did his friends. He was Captain freaking America, he could take a beating.
Whenever he tried to get closer to Steve, somehow their mix was a deadly chemical reaction set for failure.
He bit through his gritted teeth, ‘My parent’s murderer! You knew and you kept it a secret! Protecting yourself! Protecting
He felt himself being dissected under those piercing brown eyes. He shifted his stance, teeming with embarrassment. His cheeks blossomed, pink coloring his pale skin. The contrast looked sinful.
‘You should know by now, Rogers. I'm very… resourceful…’ he mumbled, his thrusts shallow, his mouth biting into the meat of Steve’s shoulder, drawing a sharp breath from the blonde.
What frustrated Steve the most was the demented look that adorned Tony’s face while Steve's pain was unleashed. Tony smiled tooth and grin, not even fighting him off as if he knew the control he held over Steve.
Tony hummed in contempt as he let his arousal brush against Cap’s thighs, making the other gasp into his own mouth. The exchange grew heated and dangerous. Tony’s teeth caught his lower lip, nibbling softly until he bit harshly at the supple skin, leaving a trail of red blood trickling down his chin onto his collar.
‘Lucky for you, I packed for two. I knew you’d be useless without me..,’ as Stark’s voice trailed off, proactively claiming his first victory in what he assumed would be many verbal sparring sessions with Cap.
Steve’s hold loosened with his next words, his brain supplying a frightening solution through his unwilling lips.
Grabbing at the collar of Tony's shirt once again, he lifted Stark in the air effortlessly and pushed Tony's temporarily paralyzed form against the cheap wallpapered wall, causing it to buckle under the pressure. Tony's feet hung hopelessly and scuffed the wall in their attempts to find leverage.
“Or play spot the ninja Nat if you get bored.” Bucky grabbed an apple off the table and took a bite.
They walked into the shop, and there was an older but obviously fashionable woman behind the front counter with long brown hair, a white blouse with a tape measure hanging from her neck, and black dress pants. She looked up from her book and beamed at Tony. Then she walked out from behind the desk and opened her arms.
Steve put the dishes in the dishwasher. “Three more days apparently.” He wiped his hands on a towel. “At this rate I’ll go through Tony’s entire Netflix queue before those days are up.”
Steve opened the box, and inside was an adamantium ring (courtesy of Xavier). He took it out of the box, and slipped it onto Tony’s left finger.
Steve was so happy to be looking at his apartment again. It was nice to have a bit of a vacation, but he missed home a lot. It was also a day when the shop was closed. So Steve went upstairs, and was shocked by what he saw when he walked into the apartment.
Tony winced. “I hear you. I hear what you’re saying. Problem is… I mean, what if he decides to go through with this? He really doesn’t understand how bad it can be. Like, he’s been through stuff, he’s not naive, but you know how it is. It’s one thing to look at the water and another thing when you’re in it.” Bruce opened his mouth to reply again but Tony plowed on. “And if he decides not to, if he decides he can’t handle it, or doesn’t want to… I just… I mean that’s it. I’m kind of a package deal at this point in my life.”
The sensation of being jarred and filled and stimulated and shaken to his core swept up through him. He dug his fingers into the covers and squeezed Steve by the wrist, matching his already-escalating thrusts and shifting on his knees to get it right where he wanted it.
Steve groaned a little louder as Tony started to move back and forth on his dick. He could actually feel Tony’s tongue shift around on him, the sucking sensation, all of it. He started to minutely thrust in time with Tony’s movements, and could hear Tony moan from fucking himself with his fingers. The vibration of his moans were almost too much.
Tony put down the remote that betrayed the shake in his hand. “Right this second, yeah, I think I’m ok. In general, no. I feel like… I don’t know. Like I did something wrong. Like it was me that did this.”
Lucinda looked at Steve, who was still a bit unsure. “Steve, Tony called in ahead of time about it, I don’t sell out my clients and I won’t judge. You have my word.”
Steve strode confidently over to Tony and kissed him full on the mouth. He tended to be more dominant when he had the harness and packer on, probably because he became more confident with it, and pushed Tony onto his back then settled between his legs.
“I’ll also recommend he lock his office door and classroom doors so no reporters try to get clever.”
“They tailor for celebrities. They’ve seen everything. It’s the one upside of moving from small-town stigma to limelight stigma. You’re never going to be the wildest thing anyone’s ever seen.”
Tony shrugged. “Stuff. Dirty stuff. And the quantifiable properties of Soulmate sex. We could get a grant and everything.”
“Because he felt like you were trying to buy him out instead of actually getting to know him. That’s what he said when he saw the painting. And I’m tired of both of you not getting your heads out of your asses. You’re adults, do the adult thing and actually talk to one another.” Natasha said with a raised voice.
Lucinda shook his hand. “Lucinda Carmicle.” She looked back at Tony. “Very much a gentleman, I can see why you like him.”
“I’m not claiming to have been cool like that where Bucky’s been concerned, I’m just saying Natasha is. We both have seen other people, and we root for each other about it, you know?”
Clint rolled his eyes. “Gee I don’t know. Because you’re in love with an incredibly handsome billionaire and cohabitating with him and he’s obviously into you and you’re both adults? Not like you have to, but I’m not crazy to ask. Sheez.”
He… hadn’t really thought about that. Tony had told him about possibly being kind of an icon for the LGBT community by being in a public relationship, but could he handle hiding out when there was something big like this? Would he have to hide again when the media found out who he is? But Tony… he was just so energetic and happy when they were together. He made Steve smile just by being himself, and that didn’t happen often with people. It may have been early in the relationship, but Steve felt he was worth it.
“I know. I’m sorry,” Steve says, looking down, “can... can we pretend this never happened. ‘Cause I really like you. Don’ wanna see you gone.”
, “what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time?”
“You know I’m not going to stop, I… you know how much Tony means to me, and I know he sent me the papers but he didn’t... he didn’t sign them. He didn’t sign them and I’m not going to give up on him until…”
pretty, Nat and Diana are pretty, Thor is pretty, hell, sometimes even Steve is pretty, but your pretty is also handsome, because you’re Superman, and you’d expect your handsome to be the manliest of the manliest, except your also pretty in a delicate which makes fuck all sense and—” the rest of Tony’s sentence gets drown in a pillow that he forces over his face. Clark, the pretty-handsome-bastard that he is, gently tugs it away.
“Likewise,” Steve says, catching his eye, returning the second half of his smile. He’s a little shorter than Steve, just so that Steve, in the event that they would be kissing, would have to tilt his head down a little. “What brings you here?”
“JARVIS, scan, scan, for Steve,” Tony says, ignoring the way his voice cracks. JARVIS shows an infrared scan of the building, a bright red blur in a sea of blue. Steve. Tony carefully flies towards it, paying no mind to the structural warnings JARVIS displays over his HUD.
“So are you, Tony,” Steve says, grinning. Tony’s utterly in limerence with the way Steve’s tongue curls around his name (and other things). The pomade in his hair has lost all effect and thus his bangs are falling into his eyes and messily over his forehead and, God, he’s gorgeous.
“No,” Steve groans, attempting to facepalm. His fingers slide through his messy bangs and he loses his balance, crashing into the wall.  “I wan’ wanna be more than that. Dummy.”
“Do you think NYU will hire an ex-convict? Or maybe Columbia?” Bucky teases, grinning. Steve shoves him, gleefully dispelling any thoughts about what he’s going to do after this. He gets his revenge… then what? More crime? As loathe as he is to admit it, who the fuck is going to hire an ex-con?
“Believe it or not, Ms. Potts, I’m a free citizen,” his lawyer had told him that he got parole by the skin of his teeth, and possibly only because one of the judges was young and had studied him back in college, but they didn’t need to know that.
If looks could kill, Natasha’s pretty sure she’d be making her way downstairs already, but alas, all James’ eyes can do is hold far more scathing and bitterness than she’s used to. If she were to tell someone that she’d once been witness to love and adoration from him, she’d get carted off to the nearest looney bin. Or worse, a shrink.
Steve is silent for a long moment that may well have been an eternity. “You’re going to get rid of it.” It wasn’t even a question.
Steve frowns, “Don’ wanna be your bud,” he grumbles. Tony pretends that hadn’t cut all his heartstrings then played cat’s cradle with them.
“Hey, hey, none of that, you’re not dying today, if you die, it’s going to be when you’re old and grey and the serum’s given up,” Tony babbles, silently begging him to keep his eyes open. Carefully, carefully, he makes his way out, trying not to cause the building to fall even more, putting Steve in the stretcher the medics have out.
Steve sighs, he’s lucky that Bucky got him when there wasn’t anyone else around, “You said you needed a reason, a real reason, well this is mine. When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren't gonna hurt anybody. We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That's why I'm here.”
“You knock,” Steve tells Sam when they find themselves in front of a door that grandly declares that this is the location of
In his second show of incredible self-restraint of the night, he doesn’t acknowledge Steve at all as Storm drags him outside, presumably to kiss him in the dirty alleyway next to the bar, even though Steve deserves something far better than that. Dickhead.
Up in apartment 4C, Peter Parker empties his pockets to find the Apple watch and, instead of the overstuffed wallet, to his dismay, he unpockets a business card with a name, location, and time. Well, if he’s going to be kidnapped at least the culprit has been kind enough to give their name - possibly an alias, the primary location - a relatively popular diner, and the time - dinner.
, but he’s good, diligent. And without a record, yet. If he were a sentimental man, he would say that he reminds him of Steve at that age. If.
“I can see why you were such a good teacher,” Bucky mutters, staring at the blueprint in front of them.
‘Have you ever done something like this before?’ Noticing Steve’s silence, he pressed, ‘You can speak your mind.’
Tony’s ears prickled, his smug face twisting darkly. The steady rhythm he had created grew heated, more forced. His grip tightened at the back of Steve’s neck, he bit at Steve’s flesh, breaking the skin, lapping at the blood there. He tugged harder at Steve’s cock, the dry pumps pulling at Steve’s sensitive skin.
Steve hated to admit it, but Tony was starting to make a lot of sense. He couldn’t let Tony know that, though. He could do with a bit more modicum, though.
Steve quickly obeyed, parting his legs to allow Tony better access to his thighs, his eyes vacant and grim. Steve could feel Tony’s wandering fingers parting his cheeks, those large thumbs digging into his skin, revealing his puckered hole. He heard the sharp intake of breath from Tony, he could feel the smooth slick of Tony’s prick sliding between his thighs. It sent shivers down his body; he had never felt so vulnerable in his life.
Stark’s eyes were closed, his hands tweaking Steve’s nipples between the pad of his fingers, if he wasn’t already busy teasing Steve’s dick with little whacks here and there. Tony’s lips were moving as he was speaking, but no sound was heard.
‘Shut it, Stark,’ fell from Steve’s lips as he started to gesture towards his abuser. ‘You had your chance and you took it. We had a deal, I did everything you asked, now let them go…Or are you not a man of your word, Tony?’ Steve’s ice blue eyes now ablaze, his resolve unwavering as his tone changed ever so slightly for his last words.
‘N-No… ahh! N-ever me…Tony I didn’t-’ he choked back a moan. His respiratory tract was burning under the press of Tony’s grip. Fingers dug into the sides of his throat, every gulp of his Adam’s apple constricted by the palm of Tony’s punishing hand.
Apparently, Tony didn’t appreciate the fact that Steve seemed unaffected by what had transpired. Not as much as him, anyways, and it pissed him off.
Suddenly he felt cold. His blood turning to ice. He started shaking, both of his arms snaking around himself in an effort to keep the heat in, but slowly losing the battle to the impending fear that stalked him.
No matter, Steve didn’t let up, his worry shifting to sudden paranoia, which made Bucky wary of his companion’s unprecedented behavior. Steve faced Bucky with a heavy look on his face, and voiced his concern, almost spilling the contents of his hot beverage onto the side table when he dropped it roughly with a loud thud.
Steve hadn’t really slept well the previous night, still bummed out from the news he had received. He still didn’t understand how two stubborn individuals like themselves would not clash on an undercover mission.
‘Indeed, Man of Iron, the captain will surely see how wonderful of a man you are!’ boasted Thor, tapping Tony on his back, almost making him choke from the strength of the swat. God, Thor needed to control his strength.
He couldn't pinpoint it for sure, but Steve's hand remained clenched on the door knob where it kept failing under the Super Soldier's strength.
Steve’s rim was puffed and red from the abuse, while his dick bobbed up and down the flat of his stomach, leaking precum. He simply laid there, taking all Tony had to offer. He was…weak. He had hurt Tony and no matter what he did, it wouldn’t bring
‘You know, I used to think about us sometimes, too. When I allowed myself to hope your hatred towards me was just a phase. We worked well enough in the field. We could have had this if we both would have been honest from the start. I get I did you wrong, Tony, but what you’ve done today… I don't think there's much to salvage anymore and I can’t believe I ever thought this could have worked.’ Steve turned to walk away, his strut powerful even though he sported a small limp.
