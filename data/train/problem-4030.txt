“I’m serious,” Castiel says.  “You have got to be completely obsessed with your own navel-gazing inferiority complex to make such an inaccurate assumption.”
When Dean comes back with the whiskey, Sam is in the shower.  Dean is soaked again, wet from his trek to the liquor store in the rain, and Castiel stares down at the table while Dean shucks his jacket and jeans and puts on dry ones.  He feels strange, these days, when they are on a case and he has nowhere to go; the Winchesters never make him feel like he shouldn't be there, sharing their space, but he sometimes worries that his welcome is more of a formality than a feeling.
“Really?” Sam said.  “Because since Cas has been hanging out around all the time again, you’ve seemed a little freaked out to me.  You sure there’s nothing you two should talk about?”
Dean felt like an idiot, driving down I-40 staring at Cas with his dick hanging out of his pants, but he tapped the brakes and pulled off onto some kinda side road that seemed to lead to nothing at all.  “What’s going on?  Look, Cas, you ever don’t want to do something, you just tell me to fuck off, I won’t take it personally - ”
Sam rolls his eyes and asks Castiel about the end of the hunt, tells him about a mother changeling they’d hunted years ago; Dean has told him the story before but he listens attentively, and then Sam talks about a zombie they hunted a few months ago in Arkansas, a couple of vetalas they tracked to Minneapolis.  Sam glances at the bar a couple of times, but Castiel’s back is to it, and so he doesn’t notice anything until Sam jerks his head up, looking startled, and says, “Dean.”
“What’d you think of that?” Dean said, grinning up at him and letting his tongue dart to lick at the corner of his lip.
“I don’t want you to sit outside in the rain all night, Cas,” Dean says, and when he looks up at Castiel from beneath his eyelashes he looks apologetic and hopeful and miserable.
“Why do people comment on YouTube videos?” Cas asked, looking so perplexed that you’d think it was part of the riddle of life, the universe, and everything.
“Huh?” Dean says.  “Hang on a sec - ”  He crosses the room, turns the music down and then turns back to Castiel.  “What’d you say?”
it, even, but he couldn’t get used to need.  He wasn’t sure he ever would; he wasn’t sure he ever wanted to.
“Great,” Dean says.  He hands Castiel the bottle, and Castiel takes another, longer drink.  “Atta boy.  Can you still get drunk?”
Dean looked around.  The brush here was dense, and you’d have to really crane your neck and have damn good night vision to see anything from the road, but still - you didn’t just pull over and fuck a guy over the hood of your car.  It wasn’t a
When it’s over, Dean turns his face away, lets Castiel press his lips to Dean’s throat in the silence, and when Dean gets dressed and leaves he barely pauses at the door, says, “Night, Cas,” and closes it behind him.
“Dean,” Cas murmured.  He was thrusting up impatiently where their hands were tangled together between them, his brow sweaty, and Dean
(Later, when he told Sam about it - without any of the details, because Sam had always made it very clear exactly how much of Dean’s sex life he wanted to hear about and it was none - Sam looked at him like he’d grown a second head and it was a vamp.
“I think you’re missing out on the potential for comedy,” Cas said, watching as Dean started to unload the groceries onto the conveyor belt.
Enough of that; Dean would have plenty of time to get mushy about having time to stink up a place when he wasn’t feeling like he coulda been facedown 30 hours ago.  He toed off his shoes and kicked off his jeans and collapsed straight into bed, burying his face in the pillow and starting to feel himself slide toward unconsciousness almost before he’d gotten comfortable.
They don't have any leads on the other werewolf, and they're all a little on edge about it.  Castiel wishes vaguely that he had his own car with him, because being in the Impala at this moment is unpleasant.
Cas didn’t make him talk much after that; instead he stayed quiet, his lips firm on Dean’s, his hands skating across Dean’s skin.  Dean thought they woulda been hard and fast tonight, kinda heated like they sometimes were after they argued, but Cas didn’t seem angry.  He seemed
Sam calls a week later, says there's some signs in Chattanooga of a couple of witches that they could use his help with, if he's interested.  Of course Castiel’s interested; Dean will be there, and Sam will be there, and so by definition he is interested.  He wonders if Sam knows how little else truly
raining, but there’s an awning that extends over the path that goes along the motel's rooms, and plenty of space to sit on the ground without getting wet.  It's not exactly pleasant, but Castiel can ignore the cold and the damp well enough.
The next day, Castiel can tell Dean doesn't want to talk about it.  Dean wants so few things, and Castiel wants to give them to him when he can, so: they don't talk about it.
“That you’ll, I don’t know,” Dean said.  “Stick around.  That you’ll come by on some kind of normal schedule, that you won’t fly upstairs one day and we’ll never hear from you again.”
“Fuck no,” Dean said.  “When he was a kid I’d put a couple twenties in an envelope for him and tell him to go wild at the 7-11.  That’s as close as Winchesters get to sentimental.”
it: when Dean was kneeling at Cas’s feet with his dick in Dean’s mouth he looked at Dean like he hung the goddamn moon, which was crazy because Cas actually
“You can head out, if you want,” Dean says, grabbing the remote and turning on the television across the room. “Case is done, but since we’re paid up for the night we’ll probably crash here and drive home in the morning.”
“What do you mean, what’s with me?  The demons are dead and I want to go home, so let’s get in the car and - ”
, either - he’d always thought it would be… more.  Not like he’d thought Cas would come rainbows or whatever, but he thought maybe there’d be some kind of confirmation that, yup, he’d just had a roll in the sack with an angel.  Some kinda heavenly glow, or something.
“Yeah, I’m familiar with the concept,” Dean said.  “But there was something - it was an angel thing, right?  You used some kinda mojo right in the middle.”
They push to their feet, and Castiel listens carefully at several doors in a row until he finds one that’s vacant.  Dean pulls out a credit card and jimmies the lock open almost immediately, and Castiel follows him inside the dark room silently.
But over the years that Castiel has observed him, Dean's wants have been stripped down, minimized even further, subsumed over layers of need so deep that he can never rest, because the things Dean needs are impossible to obtain: he can’t capture them permanently, and so he exists in a constant state of needing them more.  His nature is that of a servant, and his father built him up to serve a cause, so he needs to be serving it all the time.  In that way, he is not as different from Castiel as he'd like to think.
By the time he pushes into the glass-walled room, one of the demons is falling to the floor as Dean yanks Ruby’s knife out of his chest.  He spins around and throws a fist into the face of one of the humans, and Castiel takes the opportunity to drive his blade into the back of the nearest demon.
Cas slid a hand under Dean’s shirt, brushed the tips of his fingers underneath Dean’s waistband.  Dean shuddered; it would tickle, under other circumstances, but under these circumstances it just made him twist his hands in Castiel’s coat and pull him closer.
Castiel spends half a day getting to Michigan and another half a day tracking a lead that goes cold.  He calls Dean, but Sam picks up, puts him on speakerphone and asks questions and says, “It’s okay, Cas, we’ll find her,” and Dean just grunts.
“Sorry, the guy who doesn’t need the calories definitely doesn’t get to pick the place.  We’re going to Jimbo’s or whatever it’s called.”
Castiel knows that Sam doesn't like how much his brother drinks, is unimpressed when he spots the emptying bottles around the bunker and their various motel rooms.  Sam doesn't usually comment on it directly, just glares passive-aggressively and rolls his eyes and, hypocritically in Castiel's opinion, often joins his brother around the bottle when the mood strikes.  Castiel doesn't actually see much difference between Dean when he's drinking and when he's sober, which he understands is a textbook sign of functional alcoholism, and he knows that means that Dean doesn't necessarily
“When the hell have we taken a vacation?” Sam says.  “Text us the address, Cas, we’ll be there in the morning.”
And anyway, he’s an angel of the lord, and he isn’t supposed to want things; the fact that he has grown to do so is irrelevant.
“Just a formality,” the man from the bar says.  They’re in a large conference room, and Castiel can’t see their faces but he can see their feet below the frosted glass, four sets, Dean’s and the man from the bar and two more.  He doesn’t know if either of the others are demons, and he pauses around the corner, listening.
just didn’t seem to cover it.  “Goddammit, man,” he growled, and then he grabbed Cas by the lapels and kissed him, hard, because anger was so much cleaner than everything else bouncing around in his head.
Castiel wrenches his knife out of the demon’s back as it releases Dean and jumps forward to catch him before he slumps to the ground.
Dean huffed a laugh.  “You see any cabs around here, Cas?  C’mon, we’ll just make him listen to Zep the whole way back.”
it had been a shitty day and this - an armful of angel, a thigh between his legs, and Cas’s surprisingly skilled mouth on his - was
“What’s with you and your whole anti-social media thing, Dean?” Sam said.  “Just because you’re almost 40 doesn’t mean you’re ‘too cool’ for the internet.”
,” Dean said, jerking a thumb at the angel crossing the parking lot.  “He wants to pay for the gas so he can
And now Sam had picked the worst freaking car to steal in all of goddamn Arkansas and Dean had to go pick him up.  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “All right.  All right.  We’re on our way.”
“So I’m gonna go show her the Impala,” Dean says, winking at her.  “I mean, we’ll probably focus on a few
It was only a minute later, maybe, when Cas pushed at his shoulder urgently, and Dean released him with a wet
By nightfall there's not much to be done - interviews will have to wait til morning, and it will be more useful to revisit all the crime scenes in the daylight - and Dean's barely turned off the car before he jumps out and says, "Going to get supplies."
“I have a rewards card,” Cas said, procuring said card from Jimmy’s wallet and holding it up as proudly as if it were a Nobel Prize.
"Dean didn't tell me not to tell you," Castiel said.  "He didn't tell me anything.  There's nothing to tell, Sam."
“Yeah, this is a totally normal reaction to a guy offering to pick up the thirty bucks for your gas.”
“I agree,” Sam said, and clapped him on the shoulder.  “It’s really serious.  Look.  Give it, I dunno, a month, and if you don’t figure it out, come talk to me again, okay?”
“Well, thank you for your financial contribution to the household,” Dean muttered.  “What name did you even use to - nevermind, I don’t care.  Does this mean you’re going to take over the grocery shopping?”
“So good, Cas,” he said, tightened his hands on the wheel.  “Fuck, you feel so good.  Don’t stop, man, that’s - you’re so
“Don’t ever do that again,” he said while he stripped Cas’s jacket and coat off, ran his fingers down the buttons of Cas’s shirt.  “Don’t ever, ever - ”
And anyway, Cas sure wasn’t complaining.  He was staring at Dean - normal, obviously, and only slightly more unnerving than usual by virtue of the fact that they were horizontal and, you know, naked - and breathing hard, and looking about as happy as Cas ever did, which wasn’t saying
, and the thing had gotten the jump on Sam and thrown him down a freaking flight of stairs.  Dean had ganked the shifter
Dean looks at him, his face blank and his jaw tight, but Castiel knows this man’s soul and he knows when he’s trying to
“He actually sent me one of him as a panda, I took a screenshot for you - look, you’re being kind of intense about this, Dean,” Sam said.  “If it’s freaking you out so much, why don’t you just ask him?”
“It’s not,” said Dean, with the confidence of a man who had done it exactly once.  “I mean, not on an empty stretch like this.  We haven’t passed anybody in like ten minutes.”
To his credit—and Dean’s endless frustration—Cas does little more than blink. Was he expecting it? Is he startled, disappointed? Did it make him think of that
Dean is—very good at this; Castiel fights to stay caught up but he is lost somewhere, left to merely catalog sensations. The yellow light he’s closed his eyes to, the hum of an air conditioning unit, the cheap synthetic feeling of the sheets wrinkling beneath them, they all stand on the edge of his consciousness. But mostly, it is Dean, Dean, and Dean again.
“Maybe this is how I want you.” Cas speaks from the crook of Dean’s own neck and he feels the vibrations shudder through him, multiply. “Maybe I’ll keep you here.”
“At least we don’t have to deal with both at the same time. Thanks for that, I guess,” he says, and makes good on his promise of several minutes ago, standing from his chair. “How long do you need?”
“No, I don’t believe I could,” Castiel says, listing closer, reeled in by the light behind Dean’s eyes, the eyelashes splayed under them. “It’s very bright.”
Dean blinks. “Whatever?” He grins, but it’s tinted with the crease of his brow. “You don’t know what you’re signing up for here, Cas, I could be into some kinky shit. Not that—wait, uh,
“Enough to know I made the right—choice.” Cas’ voice goes feathery as Dean takes him back into his mouth, gentle, savoring. “I—”
The longer they sit, the more Dean’s mind wanders. Sweating slightly in the oven-heat, was this what the garden of Eden was like? Not that Dean is too enchanted by ideas like that anymore, the mythic ones; with their luck, the real garden of Eden is supplying some dispensary outside of Kansas City. Dean’s tired of trying to predict how the divine’ll manifest itself only to find the word of God on the back of a soup can; he’s tired of reading soup cans.
“I know I don’t, you think I’ve lived a life with this many problems by just doing whatever I thought would make other people happy?” He held on; he never should have let go. “You said it’s not in the having, but I
He’s trying, he is, to make a gift of himself half as effectively as Dean has done, but he is so alien—he was built for a certain kind of love, and there are some prayers he cannot answer. What a picture they now make, the supplicant on his knees and pleading for a thing he does not want from Castiel, and the angel over him writhing and possessed with the inability to even give him a semblance of it.
“Velma, okay? Velma’s got class, she’s not gonna be hung up on somebody who’s named after the worse barbecue cookout alternative, no way.”
are? I should be apologizing, I mean,” Dean waves a hand. “In the kitchen? I was being a dumbass. I just—I shouldn’t have done that, uh—kissed you. It was stupid of me.”
He said as much to Sam once, after a disparaging comment when Dean went back to the kitchen for yet another beer while Sam was still on his first, and Sam replied testily, "He doesn't
“Oh,” Castiel says, recognizing the dismissal.  It’s abrupt, but then, it’s Dean.  “Of course.  Tell Sam I said goodbye.”
“Shut up,” Dean snapped, but he got two rooms.  When he threw the second set of keys at his brother, Sam clapped Cas on the shoulder -
As if to prove it, Dean closes the door behind him, slides down the wall and settles himself on the ground next to Castiel.  “I don’t know, Cas.  I don’t fucking know.”
Of course, it’s absurd for him to wonder about such hypocrisy, Castiel thinks as he watches Dean tip back his head to take the shot, because he does it too, is doing it
kind of fragile, like maybe those assholes back at the warehouse couldn’t break him but Castiel probably could.
“Which is why I was the one who shoulda stayed!” Dean said.  “They were barely even roughing me up!”
"I mean you and Dean," Sam said, and paused.  "There's a thing, right?  I mean there's always been a thing, but lately - there's
“Yeah, he’s here,” Sam says.  “Did you want to… to talk to… oh.  Uh, hang on.”  There’s a muffled sound; Castiel hears Sam speak, then Dean’s deeper tones in the background.  When Sam comes back to the phone, he sounds - different.  “Hey, Cas?  Look, um.  Dean’s… busy.”
Cas’s mouth slowly fell open.  It was a very human gesture that Dean didn’t see all that often.  “You do realize I’m an
“I apologize for taking away the privilege,” Castiel says dryly.  “I thought it was more important to protect the child.”
Castiel doesn’t know what to say to that, so he does what Dean taught him to do - hangs up without another word.
, and Dean - oh holy shit, if Dean hadn’t just come he woulda been ready to go in a heartbeat, watching Cas’s eyes widen as he felt Cas warm and wet against his lips and cheek.
But the angel’s mind being blown had not, it turned out, been particularly different than anybody’s else’s mind being blown.  It wasn’t that Dean was disappointed, it was just that, in all the times he’d thought about sleeping with Cas - which wasn’t, like, a
“Well, yeah, but it’s not - I mean it’s raining,” Dean says, gesturing around like it’s possible Castiel hasn’t noticed.  “It doesn’t really matter where you are, man.”
Castiel blinks.  “You,” he says, stupidly, and then quickly continues, “and Sam.  Humans.  Angels.  Demons.  Hunting - ”
“Social media.  Yelp.  The goddamn chip clips,” Dean said, gesturing around the bunker at large.  “It kinda seems like you’re, I don’t know, settling into life on Earth.”
Dean texts a week later for a case; they’ve tracked a mother changeling down to Tucson and realized too late that it hopped a plane to Detroit.  Sam’s looking at plane tickets but if Castiel is closer - and of course he is, because Castiel is almost always close to Lebanon, Kansas and Lebanon is closer to Detroit than Tucson is by a lot - if Castiel is closer, maybe he can go check it out.  They’ll make sure to get the kids they found down in Arizona turned over to the authorities and meet him up there when they can.
” and that Dean would grab the front of his trenchcoat, maybe to deck him or something, Dean wasn’t totally sure, and that Cas would head off the punch by
Dean’s eyes widen slightly.  “Cas doesn’t - Cas doesn’t care,” he says, recovering quickly.  “Why would Cas - you don’t care, Cas, right?”
Dean’s hands are in Castiel’s hair, and a sharp tug makes Castiel startle; Dean takes the opportunity to press kisses against his jaw down to his neck, sucks a bruise into the space below his ear that he could heal with a tendril of grace if he wanted to, which he does not.  Castiel turns his body more fully toward Dean’s until they’re a tangle of limbs on the ground, Dean’s hands roving over Castiel’s coat, trying to get closer and finding that he can’t.  “Cas,” he says, almost a moan, and Castiel pulls back.
“I know what we told Sam,” Dean said, crushing his mouth to the angel’s.  “Sorry, you wanna keep reading about Sumerian moon rituals instead?”
“I’m not turning around just because Cas wants to have a fancy beer,” Dean snapped.  “Maybe we can go to your place if we’re still here tomorrow, but bar food’s been good enough for us for 30 years and that’s not changing now.”
“Shit.” Dean scrambles back, ass against the opposing counter in a second flat, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Cas blinks back at him. “Shit.”
“I would,” he starts, then nods, as if he’s affirming his newly thought decision to himself, as if he’s still learning the borders of the human body in his possession. “I would continue to follow you, Dean Winchester.”
“What?” It’s all he manages to get out before Cas is kissing him, full and open-mouthed. There’s not a piece of restraint, everything about him clamoring to get in, at Dean. Dean’s felt possessions less all-encompassing, but—he wonders, absently grasping at Cas’ shoulders and thoughts barely formed, if that isn’t exactly what love feels like, exactly what got Cas killed in the first place.
He settles into his seat with a sigh, feeling the heavy weight of everything he’d been able to put off for the last few hours start clinging to his clothes again like static electricity. He’s tired, sure, but there aren’t enough shitty motel rooms in the world to sleep off the pending apocalypse, so he turns the key and points true north again—towards Sam.
“We need to stop,” Cas says, voice like an anvil—splat. Dean’s a cartoon blood smear. “We’re going to stop. Dean, I can’t have sex with you when I—I can’t do this anymore.”
“You heard the woman,” he gesticulates with his occupied hand; the rib drips red onto the table, “get to it.”
“What?” Dean feels his own face fall into something that probably looks like cartoon despair. “You’re kidding—Cas! Sam’s gonna be here in like, five hours, how could they—”
There’s something strange about ending the night beside his car, something that has him itching to fall into the rhythm of what this almost is. Because, of course, dinner, an escort, Dean’s beginning to feel like he should have bought a corsage. Cas doesn’t exactly help, what with the staring, but on the other hand it’s—Cas. The most routine of hunts, road trips, whatever, get turned on their head when he enters the scene, sparks flying. Maybe it’s the grace, too nebulous and large to be contained in one small human body, diffusing into the air around them to make everything feel strange and new and somehow profound. Maybe it’s just the knowledge Dean’s the only man alive who’s ever seen an angel eat some Kansas City ribs.
“Dean, we got back from dealing with that ghost like a week ago.” At Dean’s blank expression, Sam sighs. “The—you know, the one with the,” he gestures, “hair.”
He almost never does, whatever, but it’s reached a new peak recently, a new horrible boredom and itch that he doesn’t have the facilities to address.
“Tell me,” Cas says, his tight-not-tight-enough grip punching Dean’s breath out of him like some kind of office supply tool.
“Okay, fair, I guess,” Dean says, trying not to burn, “but what’s that gotta be like? Hot and heavy and then—oh,
“I have to check out,” Cas says after a few more minutes of background noise. Dull wheels skidding, the voices of strangers—Dean’s gotta be on speakerphone in the cart’s basket. “So I’ll let you go.”
“Sam and I were thinking we wait until we can more reliably tell them apart,” Cas says, studious little expression on as he watches the chick move her head twitchily back and forth in Dean’s hands. “To prevent the crises of identity, I’m sure.”
earth, and the man sitting across from him is tipping the scales in their favor. Dean taps the table with his fingertips.
“Cas,” Dean says, and here it is, the point where everything becomes boneless, where he starts to think fondly back on millions of abuses that were not this singular sort of denial. “Cas, please.”
He’d known all those years ago, watching Jason Patric in a leather jacket on a shitty motel room TV, clenching his jaw and being oh-so-grateful for once that Dad’d been gone for days. He’d known that first fumbling fight turned something else behind a bar he technically wasn’t even old enough to get inside of. Dean had known, several times, that year before Hell, the one dotted with more bar hops than usual, the one that’d had him screaming on the inside:
“Sure, we all do, but—I just got back from the apocalypse, man, I could stand to be around a friendly face for a minute.” Dean waits, faltering in the monolith stillness of Cas’ expression. “Never mind, it’s fine, just drop me near—”
“Then don’t.” Dean holds Cas’ hand to his own chest like it’ll keep the whole man there. “Don’t, just do whatever you want to me, please.”
Dean hums, lets the vibrations fade out of himself gentle and slow. He catalogues it, all of it in his suddenly exhausted mind: the hair on Cas’ arms, the heartbeat at his back, the soft press of his nose into the back of Dean’s neck. He scribbles each sensation down in bright red ink somewhere in his mind. Don’t forget this, it might be all you get, you coward. Do not forget this.
Dean’s breath is sharp against his thigh; a laugh, dismissal, something else, Castiel doesn’t know. Maybe it’s not a reaction to his speech at all, but rather to the way one of Castiel’s hands has slid very carefully again into his hair. He tugs, only just, and is rewarded with the sudden laxity of Dean’s face, his eyes slipping shut.
“Awesome,” he says, deep and dark, and fumbles with Castiel’s belt until it’s left hanging at his waist. He has one hand hooked in the waistband underneath when he stops, blinks. “Wait. Hold on—you’re not gonna like,” Dean mimes an explosion with his free hand, “smite me or anything here, are you?”
“I,” Castiel, weak as he’s felt his grace becoming, hesitates to confirm against the heady feeling now awake and living within his fingertips. “Not intentionally.”
The kind of thing that would make Sam’s nose scrunch as he put on a two for one combo smile-grimace, would make him say
Dean’s front teeth leave divots in his lower lip as he glances away again. “Cas.” It’s low, pleading, but for what? Castiel traces the slow trail of a blush up his throat and he knows.
Dean throws out his arms. “Yes, man, how am I the one who’s having less of a time with this? You’re the one who took a college class, like, ever.”
It’s immediately obvious he would not be comfortable with the revelation Castiel has just stumbled upon, dark eyes wide in the dim light. It’s equally apparent that he would never ask someone to fulfill this desire—especially not Castiel, who is not the object of such wanting, no more than anyone else this starving man lays eyes upon.
“Isn’t it?” Dean’s smile has returned, but it’s a brittle kind of weapon this time. “Isn’t this all just some kinda celestial pissing contest? You’ve heard them, it’s—predestined, or whatever; what the hell am I doing here, anywhere, that’s gonna change anything? We’re all
“You were—very adept,” Castiel says, knowing the words are wrong as he reaches for them. “Faultless.”
A body, a weapon, they are the same thing to Castiel in every single moment except this one, wherein he can see nothing less like a blade than himself. Irresponsible, to succumb to the whims of this frame, but he wants—oh, he wants to.
Castiel considers him for a moment, each of his tired lines. For all that hope hinges on the man in front of him, he is hesitant to speak, to add more to the burden. But what use is an angel in the waiting game? He must find his own purpose now, no matter how futile.
Turns out, chicken coops aren’t all that complicated. It helps that there are about four hundred different plans online—he looks at one shaped like a UFO for a long time before finally clicking away—but hey, Dean would have figured it out eventually.
you to have it. And I—I want to have it too.” Cas’ smile was wide enough to span any sort of divide that’d ever sprung up between them; Dean didn’t have to flounder for even a second wondering if there was some fatal misinterpretation afoot. “I can’t believe you fucking
It’s hardly anything yet, but the promise is there, and soon enough Cas crooks his finger and—delivers.
“Do we have to talk about it? You could just stay.” He tries to press the truth of it deep into Cas’ skin with his fingertips, and only really succeeds in reminding himself of the borders of his body, all the ways in which they’ll never really meet.
As far as he cares, this might as well be it. He’s not gonna go hunting for more, at least—he’s found enough of Eden for him right here.
Sometimes, maybe more than that, Dean identifies a certain feeling, pattern. Cas and he’ll be knee deep in the act, sweating and cursing like God intended—or didn’t, whatever’s hotter—and Dean’ll feel it, three times against his ankle. Ignorable, except the same sentiment is being roughly hummed against his jaw. No words. Just the body, the shape.
And here’s the part of the conversation where Cas interjects, dry as anything, about the completely unrelated bug problem he’s having with his pepper plants, and do you know which fowl species are perfect little exterminators, Dean?
And hell, maybe he does. Dean’s never been all that careful about reading contracts before he signs them.
It was a whisper, the way whatever strange energy that’d been inhabiting Jack’s skin bled out from him and slinked away, but Dean saw it all the same. Without checking over his shoulder, he knew the Empty was gone, closed up for good. He knew that Jack was free of his power, of the strength and burden of it. He knew that the people standing before him were so incredibly precious.
“Hey,” he says, leaning in the doorway of Cas’ room. He won’t go in yet, that’s not his part to play.
Dean looked at him, stuck like a jammed tape. “We can get him back?” And then, “wait, what do you mean, call him? Won’t he listen to you?”
And with that, the finger that’s thus far been politely circling his asshole makes itself well at home within. Dean inhales—not a gasp, no surprise, because he knows the direction from here. They’ve stepped it out, fewer times than Dean would expect to be this comfortable with it, but enough that he knows just how good it’s about to get.
, somehow, miracle, skin of his goddamn teeth, to be watched? He hopes, he prays—as much as longing is a prayer—not.
“Hey there,” he says, shrugging on a friendly cadence; she blinks slowly, unimpressed. “Two of whatever’s on tap and the same of your sloppiest ribs.” He glances to Cas, who is barely paying the waitress any mind, and back. “Please?”
Cas tilts his head, resting it at the angle and considering him. “I’m just thinking,” he says, as if he ever just does anything. “It took me a while.”
Yes, like he doesn’t hear it still in the squeak of the mattress, the shudder of the ancient air conditioning vents.
“Oh, you know,” Sam says, and if Dean thought the previous smile was nice, it’s nothing compared to the absolute sun show he’s wearing now. Dean makes a preemptive face. “She’s great. I mean,” he snorts a little, “she’s an asshole, but she’s great. You know she’s got half a degree in art history? It was for a cover, apparently, but she’s still got it.”
Cas just hums, like Dean’s already lost the argument, he just doesn’t know it yet. Jokes on him, Dean hasn’t met a stupid grudge he didn’t dig his heels in six feet down on, and the residents of the bunker—land above included—are remaining
Dean nearly melts into the bed. “Sure, man,” he says around the laugh in his mouth. “I have absolutely no idea what that could possibly mean, but—whatever you want to do.”
And then Dean has to deal with Sam’s nothing-has-ever-made-me-sadder face, but it’s okay, actually. The weight on his chest is easing up, grumbling around like it might actually think about vacating the premises sometime soon.
“I assure you,” Cas says, smile going a bit quizzical. “It was no hardship. The store’s employees really are very friendly.”
When it broke, Dean put his forehead on Castiel’s. They shared the air between them, and Castiel finally found enough of it to laugh. It didn’t really sound like a laugh. It was too broken, and too happy. It took him a second to realize that’s what he was feeling: happiness. It was too big in his chest, so big it almost felt like sadness. He could feel it beating along with his heart.
Dean just needed to see him.  Whatever else there was, it didn't matter.  They'd work it out—all the kinks and road bumps and everything that was suddenly different and new and full of equal parts fear and promise.  Dean just needed to see him and everything else would fall into place.
Presently, someone sat next to him, drawing his attention away from the crowd.  Charlie was folding her legs in front of her, carefully balancing a paper bag of popcorn so none of it would spill.  “Hey,” she said.  “Sam and Dean aren’t back yet?”  She held out the popcorn in offering.
“But why YouTube comments?  Wouldn’t there be more effective ways to air grievances to larger audiences?” questioned Cas, the paragon of logic.
More sex, more love, more money, more power, gluttony and lust and envy and sloth and wrath and pride and all of it ultimately about wanting more than they absolutely
credit cards, so don’t act like he’s doing me a big favor,” Dean said, “and second of all, what’s he planning to do with all this stuff he’s learning about?”
“Anything,” Cas interrupted, and Dean was good at dirty talk and good at pushing people around but when he
If this had been a normal hook up, back in the days when he did that kind of thing all the time, Dean would be starting to plan his departure - maybe throw out, “I’d love to stay, but I got work in the morning”, or maybe settling in for a quick nap before sneaking out the door in the middle of the night - but this was
Cas hummed around his dick, clearly less concerned about the whole “reckless driving” thing than he’d previously claimed.
, after he actually did something about it, he pulled back from Cas’s lips and asked, “So wait, does that mean you
, and Dean didn’t have a lot of experience with this kind of thing but he was pretty sure you didn’t hit it and quit it with a guy you’d known as long as he’d known Cas.  So instead he gave Cas a winning smirk.  “Good time?”
“I hope you took it to the backseat, is all,” Sam continued blithely, like Dean hadn’t almost just fallen over out of sheer shock.  “That’s common courtesy, man.”
,” Dean said loudly.  “I mean us.  Me and Sam.  Like - are you gonna stick around like a normal guy, or one day are you gonna go off and like, do something else.”
And the irritating part, Dean thought an hour later as he watched Cas take an innocent sip of his microbrew and tried not to have a visible foodgasm from his bacon cheeseburger, was that the son of a bitch was
Dean shoved half a slice of toast in his mouth.  “I mean, I wasn’t exactly complaining, man.  But yeah, humans gotta sleep.  You know that.”
It’s just a kiss.  Castiel has heard the heavenly host singing for millennia, has felt the warmth of all the angels in heaven through his grace, has won battles against foes he never should have had a chance to beat.  Kissing Dean isn’t anything like that at all.  It’s too
First of all, there’d been a shifter.  Then, it turned out the shifter had been hanging out with a vamp, because they were just
“But I have no plans to leave,” Cas continued.  “And I don’t plan to hide it from you if I do.  If I have to go, you’ll know.  I think after all this time we’ve fairly conclusively determined that we’re better off together.”
“You’re not running a tab,” the bartender says, eyeing Dean.  “And you still ain’t paid me for the last two rounds.”
“So it’s like porn?” Dean said.  “You’re telling me Instagram is just full of porn?  And you signed Cas up for it?”
“Enjoy,” Sam said, sounding just as exhausted as Dean felt.  The hunt had ended up okay - the demons hadn’t been super smart, and they’d sent three teenagers home to their parents after the assholes possessing them had smoked out - but they’d staked out the wrong place all the night before and then driven straight home because Dean just wanted his own damn bed.  It had seemed like a good plan when they left Cedar Rapids but now, 43 hours into being awake, Dean felt like shit.  He was sure he used to pull multiple all-nighters in a row with nothing but a cup full of Gas ‘n Sip coffee to get him through; then again, he didn’t used to be 35 years old and carrying around an assload of injuries that never really had time to heal.
The Winchesters are still three hours away when Castiel hunts the changeling down to a school gymnasium and kills it with his blade before it can snatch the girl it was after, but for reasons he decides not to evaluate too closely he waits to tell them it’s already done until they call him from twenty minutes out of town.  “What do you mean, done?” Dean barks.
“I was thinking we could try something different,” Cas said.  “Louisa’s Tavern is just a mile in the other direction.”
“First of all, we agreed we weren’t talking about the f word, so shut your cakehole.  And second of all, I’m not
“You won’t promise it either.”  Cas scraped his nails up Dean’s back, pulled his belt from its loops and threw it across the room.  “And I wouldn’t ask you to.”
“You done?” Dean said, even though Cas was, as usual, carrying nothing and had done zero grocery shopping whatsoever.
“He was human at one point,” Sam pointed out.  “He made it on his own for a while, so now he’s interested in all the ins and outs.  It’s a little quirky, sure, but it’s
A shudder ran through Cas’s body like a surprised little aftershock.  “That was - unexpected.”  He blinked, dazed.  “Can we do it again?”
“Yeah I’m sure,” Dean snaps, taking a swig of beer.  “I don't need anything from you, Cas.  You hear me?”
“No, I know you - but when you want something it’s to kill a fucking archangel or save the world or whatever.  You don't want, like, normal stuff.”
“You don’t seem to mind it too much,” Dean said, slithering down off the side of the bed to kneel between Cas’s legs.
“Well, nobody’s asking you to, but if you keep doing all this, I’m gonna get my hopes up,” Dean said, and then froze.
, suddenly, and Dean became aware all at once that Cas was doing something - he couldn’t tell what it was, but it was
There was heat in it this time, and it pricked something in Dean a little more awake - the idea of Cas, pressed up against him, warm and soft and naked, sounded pretty amazing, but -
By the time his cart was more full with both Dinner Stuff and Sam’s Bullshit, he’d lost Cas.  Cas tended to wander away in stores - sometimes he just left to sit in the car, but more often these days he wandered around and touched a bunch of shit and bought nothing - and Dean had a guess where he’d be.  He pushed the cart back to the middle of the store and up the greeting card aisle to find Cas standing in front of “Birthday Cards - Daughter-in-Law” and smiling to himself like he was reading the goddamn funny pages.
Castiel feels his chest tighten, an annoying and autonomic human reaction that this body failed to discard even once he got his grace back.  “I suppose.”
“Oh, come on, I’m good for it,” Dean says cheerfully, and Castiel thinks of the half-empty bottle of whiskey in Dean’s hand while they sat in the rain.
“It’s a straight shot out to the farm.  And anyway, you can angel mojo us back on the highway if we start drifting, right?”
no complaints in that department; the whole thing had been pretty freaking great if Dean did say so himself, which he did.  Unexpected, sure, but
Castiel didn’t seem to notice; he pushed Dean up against the wall next to the ice machine and shoved his tongue down Dean’s throat, and it was a
“So this is your thing, huh?” Dean says, his voice suddenly losing its slur.  “Taking advantage of people who need something.”
They drive in silence for five, ten miles.  Castiel assumes that Dean intends to wait out the entire ride back; he has seen Dean stay furiously silent for significantly longer than the twenty minutes between the bar and their motel.  In retrospect, Castiel wishes that he had ridden with Sam.
The hunt isn't going well.  They'd found the werewolf they thought was responsible for the three women who'd been discovered with their hearts missing, put a silver bullet in him and burned the remains, and they weren't even back on the road before the alert came through on Sam's phone that there was another body, same MO, all the way across town.  "A pack," Dean had grumbled, "how did we not know it was a pack?"
Twenty minutes later, Dean tiptoed back into his room, knees shaking in the good way.  He was trying to be quiet but -
“Normal stuff?" Castiel repeats, quietly, dangerously.  "You think I consider the man I rebelled against Heaven for to be
Dean turns on the TV, and Castiel is grateful for the distraction.  The bottle sits on the counter, and the glass in Dean's hand is refilled before Sam comes out of the steamy bathroom.  Sam doesn't comment, just sits at the table across from Castiel and opens his computer.  He digs into the police records on the original three werewolf murders, and Castiel weighs in with unhelpful information about the case that they all already know.
, and it’s never going to be perfect but Castiel wants him back so much that he supposes they’ll just have to figure it out.
Castiel knows Dean’s soul, and so he knows better than anyone - certainly better than Dean himself - that that soul is bound up in a very small number of central driving needs: the need to be useful; the need to help people in an effort to chip away at the bottomless pit of guilt and shame that dominates his psyche; the need, above
“I’m saying I want you,” Castiel says.  “And I’m angry with you because you didn’t bother to ask me, and with myself because I didn’t try to tell you.”
“No, of course not,” Sam soothes.  “Look, let’s just get a drink and get some sleep, Dean.  We’ll find something else in the morning.”
“Yeah, okay.  What do you want from me, a hug?” Dean said.  “Okay.  I’m glad you’re sticking around.  Good talk.  But you gotta start breaking down your own damn Amazon boxes, man.  They don’t fit in the recycling bin this way.”
“Ew, Dean,” said Sam, who somehow still managed to have the ability to be grossed out even after over three decades of knowing Dean Winchester.
He didn’t bother to ask Sam or Cas if they wanted to stop, just put the Impala in park and got out of the car at the first motel that looked halfway decent by their standards.  It was another ten hours to the bunker and he’d be damned if he was going to sit in the car in silence until sun up; no, he was gonna grab a six pack, drink most of it, and then catch a few hours sleep before they drove the rest of the way home.
It’s a cruel question and Castiel knows it.  Dean is less in touch with what he wants than any human Castiel has ever observed.
“Dean,” Castiel says, because the weight of Dean’s pain is so obvious even when he tries to hide it, and Castiel wishes he could say something that could change any of it.
"So he actually said that?  He said - this is a one time thing?  Like you and him - just the one time?"
There was a long moment of silence during which Dean wondered if he’d finally found something Cas wasn’t down to try.  And then -
Here’s how he knew: it was eight and a half, maybe nine minutes back to that taco place just off the highway.  It was a little late for lunch but way too early for dinner, so it wouldn’t be busy, and anyway when they’d eaten there last night service had been quick, so: six minutes to order and get the food and nine minutes back.
So he stood up, running his hand briefly over the hymnal in the back of the pew, feeling its dried and cracked pages. He wouldn’t find his answers in a book, nor would he find them in an empty church. He left.
The guy thinned his lips in annoyance and extended the box in his hands towards Dean.  Dean reached out of the window and took it. The contents inside rattled a little as they shifted.
He blinked into the sudden light, even if it was barely enough to combat the shadows, as he flipped the bathroom switch. Hoping it would help, he bent over the sink and splashed some cool water on his face, and rubbed it on the back of his neck. It didn’t help at all. It warmed up the second it hit his skin, and only served to make him feel worse. It was like living in a puddle.
He filled up a cup and downed it.  It tasted rancid—like someone had tried to mix whiskey with orange juice and thought it was a good idea.  He didn't care.  He downed it in one go and filled his cup up again, and repeated the process until he started to feel his head tingle and his thoughts get fuzzy around the edges.
He hadn’t meant to shout. At first, he didn’t even know he had. Not until the rest of the room went hushed and he noticed the stares he’d attracted. Dean looked down in shame, his heart slamming against his ribs.
When their bodies slowed to a stop and the last of the pulsing aftershocks ebbed away, Cas let out a heavy breath and collapsed onto Dean’s stomach. His face was in Dean’s neck, pointed nose brushing the freckles there, his hair tickling Dean’s cheek. Dean rested his hands on Cas’ back.
The butler didn’t seem threatened. He gave a wilting sigh. “You know, Castiel, I’m getting a little tired of your attitude.” He held up a lecturing finger. Slowly, he turned, moseying away from the doorway. He walked along the wall, his reflection passing through the full-length mirror. In the mirror, Castiel noticed the shadowy corners of the room behind him. The darkness deepened and swirled, seeming to come alive. Something cold licked at the back of his neck.
“Yes, it is,” Cas answered with barely concealed snippiness. “In fact, I frequently put your son in different outfits and make him talk unintelligibly.”
He went to the table and sat down in one of the chairs.  Some moonlight was spilling in through the windows, but he reached for the gas lantern in the center of the table and turned it on high enough to cast an orange glow around the room.  He removed his hat first, setting it on the table, before pulling off his boots and socks.  Dean retrieved his hat from the floor and smacked it twice to get the dirt off it before hanging it on a hook next to the door.  Then, he went to the edge of the bed and lifted one leg up to wriggle his boot off.
But the tenseness in Dean’s shoulders relaxed somewhat. He glanced up at the house across the grounds; then, he pulled the sack closer to the tree, concealing both it and himself from view. As he got closer, he ducked his head a little, glancing at the open pages on Castiel’s lap. “Secret’s safe with me.”
Scared that he’d forget about all of it—everything he’d protected himself from, everything he’d planned for his life—for Cas.
Next, the intercom crackled into life.  “Uhhhhh, ladies and gentlemen, we’ve just turned on the fasten seatbelt sign,” the pilot said, voice muffled, and this was it.  He was about to tell everyone that their engines had failed and they were all about to die and that, for some reason, wearing a seatbelt would make everything better.
The outlaw’s serrated knife was stuck tip-down in the splintering wood of the table, right next to where she sat, boots dangling off the edge as her legs swung back and forth.  It was almost childlike.  There was a candle lit on the other side of her, its tiny flickering light playing shadows on her face.  Her brimmed wool hat sat atop spiraling dark waves.  Her eyes were two black holes in the darkness.
The tinkering of a bell sounded in the distance, immediately shifting the atmosphere.  Gabe sat up straighter, eyes alight.  “Dinner time!” he exclaimed.  “C’mon, Jimmy.  Better get going before the line gets too long.”
He jumped up so quickly that, if the chair hadn't been bolted down, it would have clattered to the floor.  He rushed towards the exit, the guards suddenly standing to attention.
He lunged forward, knife first, and before Dean could even react, Cas' elbow had connected with his gut.  A sharp pain went through him as he was knocked to the side, out of the way.  When he caught his bearings, he realized Cas had sidestepped out of the way of the knife's point.
Castiel whipped around. Dean had his phone out, flashlight shining from it. He was pointing it off to the side of the plot. Castiel’s eyes immediately tracked to the spot it was illuminating. A deer carcass was rotting between two trees, its stomach burst open, beady black eyes gone milky.
“Relax,” she said, like that was an option.  She propped her elbow on the bar, and rested her head on her fist.  “I’m pretty sure no one else saw. But even if they didn’t, you two aren’t exactly subtle.  I don’t think I’ve ever stared at someone for as long as you guys stare at each other in my life.”
Dean scoffed, pretending the compliment didn’t cause him to blush. He laid back, his head on the pillow. “Yeah, don’t think Sam downstairs would agree with you on that one.”
He could hear more voices.  They sounded close—right next to his ear.  But they were muffled, too—just quick bursts of sound and garbled speech.  He couldn’t make out any of the words.
“Catch you later, man,” Lee said as they parted, clapping his hand into Dean’s and bringing him into a one armed hug.  Dean slapped his back lightly before pulling away. They were the last people in the bar, which meant it must have been close to 2 AM.  Dean hadn’t realized it had gotten so late, but time usually slipped away from him when he was with this group.  Besides, it was nice to have Cas there. Cas seemed better after their conversation, so maybe this whole night was kind of good, after all.
Before Castiel could open his mouth to ask what had happened, Naomi spoke up. “The souls the prisoners had stolen from the individual heavens, Castiel. We believe Duma and Barachiel had absorbed them. After they were brought here, they used that power to free themselves from their cell and give them to Chuck. The transfer killed them.”
“Thank you, ma’am,” Henriksen told her.  There were more shuffling noises, and then footsteps headed for the door.  Castiel held his breath, telling himself not to make a sound.  They were so close.  He feared Jack would take that very moment to begin crying.
There had to be, even though Dean didn’t remember seeing one.  Maybe it was around back.  He prayed they wouldn’t have to go fetch water from the pond.
What was worse—at one point, when they were stuck in the tunnel for about ten minutes—Dean felt Cas’ hand fist the sleeve of his jacket with a kung fu grip.  He tried to tell him to stop, but Cas’ eyes were closed. His breathing was a little stilted through his nose as he focused on it intently. And it finally dawned on him that Cas was nervous—no, he was
“Yes,” Castiel said bluntly.  “If I have to.  You said that was the deal, didn’t you?  That you raise him with your beliefs, and I raise him with his mother’s—and he’ll get to choose for himself.”
Castiel was so deep in thought that he almost missed the exuberance of his friends as they entered the house.  It was decorated brilliantly. Fake miniature bamboo trees lined every wall. A net was strung up from the ceiling, laden with foliage.  The floor was completely covered in sand and dirt. The only lighting was dim and tinted green or gold. A DJ was in one corner; the table in front of him had wooden masks nailed to the front.  A few sorority girls, wearing animal-print togas and heavy face paint to resemble tigers and lions, were going around with trays of alcohol in bamboo cups, offering them to the throngs of people packed into the house.  A painted banner reading
But he wasn't worried about any of those particulars at the moment.  He was mostly focusing on the scratch of Cas' stubble as Dean kissed beneath his chin and jaw.  They were in the kitchen as the sun outside was setting through the small window, painting the tiny room in pinks and golds.  Cas was sitting on the only free counter space in the entire kitchen, his shoulders pressed against the cabinets up top.  Dean was standing wedged between his knees, his hands planted on Cas' thighs through his jeans.  As Dean kissed him, Cas' fingers were carding through his hair.
“I didn’t know whether he was hungry or needed a change.  All his supplies are packed in my suitcase,” was the answer.  Cas narrowed his eyes up at Dean.  “You know that.”
And he was immediately met with a punch to the face. Dean reeled to the opposite side of the door from where the assailant had been waiting for him.
Castiel's eyes trailed after her, and he tried to focus on being grateful that she still wanted to be his friend, but the interaction had left a sour taste in his mouth.  He didn't want her to be right about Dean, and he told himself she wasn't.  Dean had never been modest about his hook ups.  Surely, Castiel would have heard about one by now if there were any during his trip.
“Your brother is,” Castiel stops, remembering Sam’s bowed and weary head. To say the word well would be to misspeak. “I believe the worst of it is over.”
Cas, unrelenting as the force of nature he once was, still is, holds his face in his calloused hands and leaves Dean gasping, awestruck, a hundred other things he’d never thought he’d actually unveil in front of another breathing person. And maybe he wouldn’t, in front of anybody else, but—it’s
Dean raises his eyebrows but smiles all the same. “Cas, you’re one hell of a dude, but you’ve got the worst taste of anyone I’ve ever met.”
They slide into a booth with just enough time until closing that it’s merely inconsiderate rather than outright rude, but their tired-looking waitress still hits them with a decently curled upper lip that doesn’t twitch even in the presence of Dean’s toothiest grin.
“Dean Winchester,” Cas says. His voice, if it was anyone else’s, Dean would say was trembling, wobbly underneath the weight of its own tone. It’s Cas, though, so Dean knows there’s no possible force on Heaven, Earth, any of the stupid dimensions in between that could break it.
“Nothing like talking to you angels to make me feel like half a high school diploma’s almost too much,” Dean says, reaching for his beer. After a long pull, “dig in already, c’mon, I feel weird.” Cas very slowly does, chewing like you would if you were still half asleep. “Well? How are the molecules?”
He means it; the soul before him is grand, has withheld the most battering of forces, but remains so carefully finite. He will accept what is offered and no more.
“Here,” he says, drawing his thumb out of Dean’s mouth to present his palm. Dean follows the unspoken order and drags his tongue along it, marveling at the fact he leaves anything behind, dry as his mouth now feels.
“No,” Dean agrees, closing his eyes. If he’s lucky—which, with Cas lying next to him, he is more often than not—he’ll be drifting off to dreamless sleep any second now. He can only hope the same is true of the guy he’s curled around. “We wouldn’t.”
too early, coming home with a box full of seven fucking baby birds—more than the minimum recommended, which Dean
Dean swallows hard, reminded of angel possession, permission, all of it melting away in the face of Cas’ steely hard gaze.
Unopposed, Cas runs his mouth, though not to say anything, not exactly. It’s all echoes. He hears Cas say his name from somewhere far away, over and over again.
It was difficult, at the moment, for Dean to give anything but Cas the time of day, but the corner of his eye still managed to pick up tendrils of black waving in a non-existent wind, whatever membrane that’d been pulled away to reveal them remaining so.
“I suppose…the fact I make it to any sort of future it’s,” he pauses, tilts his head as sardonically as an angel is able, Dean guesses. At least, this particular one. “It’s a strange idea.”
He blinked and he was reaching deep into the cold, damp prison on only some crazy instinct, made crazier by the touch of smooth, warm flesh on the other side.
“Jack,” Cas said, and Dean could see that with every utterance of his name, the kid fell more and more into himself, closer to looking at them straight. “There is so much more to being alive than you’d ever know if you don’t release yourself.”
on the shoulder. He rolls off of Dean slightly and onto his back, putting an arm over his eyes; Dean scrubs his own with the backs of his knuckles, clears his throat.
“That soon? Back to work then, I guess. Just,” Dean tries imitating a whip-crack noise with his mouth, but it loses a bit of its punch when he’s got no free hands to drive it home. “There’s, ah. There’s a motion that usually accompanies that.”
And the miracle was, Cas was looking back—until he wasn’t. Dean blinked and he’d lost the grip on his sleeve, lost his hand, as the concerned tilt of his head was now pointed toward Jack, who looked at the world with blank but smiling eyes.
It really should be easier by now. Dean clenches his jaw against the truth, the part of himself that wants to reveal that it wasn’t so much a question as some kind of plea:
another before he turns away again. “Well, let’s—let’s start on that marinade. You know how grumpy Sam gets if there’s not something cooking on arrival.”
Dean watches him for a moment, then leans back on the same flowered motel bedspread he’d sat upon before the earth shifted on her axis. He closes his eyes, lets the bare amusement playing about his mouth shoulder the full weight of his expression.
“Y’gonna make pickles?” Dean says, holding one of the vines gentle in the crook of his finger. Up so close, it even smells like cucumber, cucumber and the gritty soil it’s sprouting out of; clean and dirty, but neither scent cancelling the other out. It all just smells like life.
“But you should talk to me about this—if you want to. Four decades is a long time to be so, uh, repressed—”
He shrugs. “Why not? Five bucks isn’t much.” Not, Dean thinks with the weird satisfaction that comes with somehow surviving this long, anymore.
“Don’t—what?” Dean looks up at him, the curve of his neck pronounced and coloring with blood and heat. “Don’t say that.”
Cas ducked his head a little closer, an attempt to get in Jack’s nonexistent sight line. “Let it go. You don’t have to wield this power—no one does.”
Cas makes a noise, painful in its pitch, one that has Dean looping an arm over his shoulders, threading a hand through his hair. God, he’s gotta find a way to get him even closer.
“So, yeah,” Dean leans forward on his knees, stupid sort of smile on his face. He’s earned it; he really hasn’t. “You got any advice for that?”
“I said I would,” he says over every inch of Dean’s breath fleeing his lungs. “And I will, I will make you feel—you will feel incredible.”
“This is not to discourage you from texting Jack,” Cas says, eyes drenched in the heaviest sincerity Dean has ever been on the receiving end of. “I would very much like you to do that.”
“Okay, now that it’s settled,” Sam says, pushing back from the table to set his bowl and mug by the sink. “I’m heading to Eileen’s. See you in a few.”
He loses himself for a moment; whatever is spoken in that space is equally beyond his reach. He wonders if he finished voicing it. He hopes so.
“Dean.” There’s something about Cas’ voice during this particular moment that makes Dean want to stop him, ask him something, anything, just to hear the answer in his scraped clean, unarmored tone. But then, he doesn’t need to—Cas isn’t the one who’s got a problem expressing himself. He tilts his head back and leaves it all unspoken.
Dean laughs. Pauses. Laughs a little more. “Man, you are just the most boring dude alive, huh?” It’s both praise and condemnation, something new between the two. “You know shit’s dire in heaven when you’re the one leading a rebellion.”
“Okay,” Sam says, hands up, smiling a little. “Okay. Just checking, because, you know. That whole conversation we had about not lying to each other anymore?”
“Ah, you must be wondering at the implications of this new character in relation to Betty’s hallucination.” Cas tilts his head. “Though I suppose we don’t know if it
“I’m sorry for the inconvenience,” Cas said, and Dean laughed, a small huffing thing that felt light in his lungs. “I’ll, ah, plan it better next time.”
“Shit.” Dean pulls away to look a dark-mouthed Cas in the eye as the tremor of the bunker’s door finishes echoing through the walls of his room. He blinks, stares again, gets a little caught in it, because, because—
Cas hums something neutral, unwittingly saving Dean’s life, ‘cause he’s not entirely sure what it’d come to if he chose to agree
The second is something they haven’t, don’t, will not talk about, because even just remembering Cas’ teary face seconds before he—Dean can’t think about it. He just can’t. Sometimes he skirts the edges, wonders if Cas meant what he said, wonders if he somehow still does, but he’s never gonna bring it up. It’s enough to let that stone go unturned, to trust in it as another weird and nebulous thread tying them together, keeping Cas
He’d walk back into shared motel rooms with bruises up and down his neck, half a prayer in his head that Sam wouldn’t ask, half a lie formed on his tongue in case he did.
“Listen,” he says, overcome by a wave of sentiment that takes control of his voice before he can stop it. “I know you’re not an angel anymore, I know you gave it all up, that whole old eternity thing, all for us, and,” Dean stops, inhales. There are things that get easier with time and there are things that Dean will be hacking against forever; it’s hard to tell what exactly this is yet. “And I love you for it.”
And so he does, one year of a millennium down as he coaxes Dean up and over that sharp and beautiful edge, the one that gets him seeing lights behind his eyes that have nothing to do with angels.
“I’m,” Cas says from where he’s already steps away from the hallway. He gestures over his shoulder. “Enjoy your coffee.”
“Yeah, it’s me. We’ve been—we’ve missed you, man.” He took a breath, remembering that last tortured time he’d looked Cas in the face. “Hey, if you’re not coming out ‘cause you’re afraid it’ll be weird, or whatever, that’s a stupid reason, alright? I’ve done a lot of thinking since you left in the middle of our fucking conversation and you know what? I think I have an answer now.”
“Dean, this is great,” Sam says, and Dean breaks eye contact with the the overgrown scruff on Cas’ cheek to look at his brother. He’s smiling like a kid whose parents just okayed a family dog, and hell, if that don’t feel kinda nice too. “Y’know, there’s probably a charm we can put on the coop to—”
Castiel’s hand flexes where it’s found its way into Dean’s hair, earning him a sharp breath in response; he wonders at, rages against the idea that bounties of human beings have indeed known just this. But then, they can’t have, for only he has Dean Winchester now as he is, desperate and wonderful and holding his body down with his own.
There was something in Cas’ face that Dean had never seen in anyone else, a kind of sweet knowledge, a kind of holding that happened even without the laying on of hands. Maybe it was the kind of expression you could only form after making the switch from angel to human and back again like some flickering lightbulb; maybe it was just the natural chemical reaction of their two met gazes.
“No.” Castiel’s borrowed fingers itch; for what, he does not know. A touch of the divine, some whisper of God that continues to escape him? How will he find it here, stranded on some lone highway offshoot and standing in front of a man made of sweat and blood? “No, I hardly believe you can be blamed for such a thing anymore.”
Whatever kind of damage you have to accrue to be imagining the rustle of sheets to be human words and emotion, well, Dean’s sure to have picked it up somewhere. Exact location doesn’t really matter, because the real problem is that it’s been this long, and now he knows: he’s never gonna hear the words actually spoken again.
“I’ll be sure to report that to middle management,” Cas says, surprising a snort out of Dean, who draws back far enough to look him in his flat, amused eyes. Man, he likes this. “I did work retail once, if you recall.”
“Yeah, okay,” he says, stuttering into Cas’ grip. He was already half-mast, what with the heady feeling of Cas falling apart at his, ah, TLC, but this takes him the rest of the way to paradise. “Yeah, like—like that.”
“We should,” Dean says, a hopefully effective counterpoint to whatever the hell’s running through Cas’ head right now. “We really, really should.”
It feels a little rotten, cornering Cas in the space Dean knows is something like an escape for the world’s most wingless angel but—he’s gotta. He’s going crazy.
He waits for the creak of the floorboards that means Sam’s continued on whatever Cas seeking mission he’s currently on, but gets some from the opposite chair instead. He glances over to see Sam settling in with raised eyebrows.
If there is, Dean’ll never find out, because Cas whips the phone out of his hand before he can blink; in another, the laptop is snapped closed and set on the nightstand with it.
“Good. Uh. Good.” He looks back down at the bird in his hands. Worth two in the bush, or something. “She got a name?”
The rumble from that same area is immediate. “And what would there be to ‘freak out’ about?” Cas says, wry even as he wraps his fingers around Dean’s wrist.
“Oh, sorry, were you watching?” Dean says as he sets it down in the wire fruit bowl, turning just enough over his shoulder to catch Cas’ eyes, creased and gentle in his face. He lingers there, pulled taut by the thing that’s always existed in their shared gaze. “Hey, thanks.”
“Thanks, but I’m good,” Dean says, and it’s true. Weirdly, it’s true. “I’m forty-one, you don’t gotta life coach me.”
Cas doesn’t respond; Dean looks up to see his back turned like Dean’d never spoken, oh-so-casually headed for the doorway that leads out of the kitchen and away from this particular line of questioning. Dean grins, jots it down, and then stuffs the list in his pocket to grab Cas by the waist before he can fully escape.
“Hey,” Sam says. Dean looks over his shoulder to see him smiling sort of quizzically. “Coffee ready?”
“No, no, I just didn’t expect you’d take me up on it,” he says, and smiles. The gentle creases around his eyes when he does so make Castiel wish for any fate but the one he’s now plummeting towards. “So, what? You wanna take another shot at this whole,” Dean gestures lazily in the air, “last night on earth thing? Hit up some other ‘den of iniquity?’”
Dean grins himself, picturing a former angel of the lord glaring up at a small glass canister just out of reach. There’s an ache to accompany it, of course there is, but it’s of a kind made sweeter and better with time, like the one in his jaw after too much sugar in his coffee.
It’s very simple, after so much conversation, to fit an immortal palm against mankind’s all too human jaw and close the distance.
Dean pulls off to look up through his eyelashes at Cas, leaning back against the cool black metal of his baby. He can’t quite make eye contact, what with how Cas’ head is tilted back, which is a shame. He knows how he looks like this, wearing one of his tighter black t-shirts, lips swollen, eyes dark. He wants to see something like it reflected in Cas’ face; he wants to know his own desperation.
“So I just—” Dean glanced at Jack to see him completely absorbed in his task, eyes open but unseeing, jaw clenched. “Right. I can figure it out.” He cleared his throat, edging ever closer to the vortex that could probably eat him alive, ever closer to the angel inside that would want him moving towards anything but that. “Cas?”
“Hold her—yeah,” Cas says as Dean brings his little bounty up close and personal to his chest. “Careful, she’s not big enough to fly yet.”
Dean swallows. “Yeah. Right.” If he means to say forever, at least he’s couching it. “I can—listen, this whole thing’s been a mess, but I can give you that.”
This, strangely, the most reassuring element when Dean’s head gets to racing about the wide, wonderful, fuck awful world Cas is giving up to sleep like a stone on the other half of Dean’s memory foam mattress: he’s been human before, and they’re not exactly strangers to the scramble that comes in the wake of losing and finding each other before, but—this is a new piece completely. It’s incomparable; as much as they’ve held onto each other over the years, Dean’s never quite felt the grip of Cas’ hand as acutely as he does when they—during the—
There’s a miscommunication there that Dean should dirty his hands to try and correct, but he can’t quite diagram where the conversation will go from there and he’s so, so tired of fighting.
Like peeling back the thin, outermost layer of an onion, Jack made a downward motion with his hand and there it was, the swirling dark mass of it. Dean blinked, trying to tamp down on the urge to step between it and Jack and push them both back a few steps.
Dean sighs, the air of himself reflecting off the nearness of Cas’ thigh. God, he—he can’t think about this, not too deeply, he can’t think about Castiel, angel of the lord, the best friend he’s ever had, losing his grip on his words because of Dean. He’ll die all over again, he swears it.
“You’re a sap,” he says instead of articulating any of this, lets the softness of his voice do it for him. Besides, Cas already knows. “C’mere.”
It’s easy, too much so, to sink into it, the heat and noise and need of it, easier still because it seems Dean is—enjoying it. Or, at the very least, just incredibly, needlessly skilled.
“Yes,” Cas says, narrow point focus entirely beaming down upon Dean’s pathetic sore spot of a soul. “Yes. Dean.”
“I would prefer,” Castiel says, not wanting to wipe the grin from his face, precious in its rarity, “if this time around we did actually just remain here quietly.”
, although a lesser man might, but it certainly snaps what’s left of his mind to attention. And sure enough, a paltry few seconds later, Cas is reaching into his boxers to get his hand around Dean’s dick like he owns the thing.
Cas, familiar with his preferences, pushes him down into the mattress below until Dean is utterly bursting with the joy of containment. He presses back up against the weight of Cas’ body, the seal of a hand around his wrist. Their kissing is as it always it: wet, hot, the only thing Dean will ever need again.
There’s a part of Castiel that wishes to remain like this, watching the line of Dean’s shoulders shift in amusement without the weight of the world leaving them downturned, but another, truer part burns in his throat like the thirst he will never understand. How simple, these actions he wishes so heartily to resume, how deceptively so; Castiel is struck by the disproportionate weight of his wanting.
If he’s gotta lie—which, Dean’d like to meet a bastard who didn’t—he’s found the best way to pull it off is to hunt the truth down and skin it, to wear its dead pelt until he could pick the thing out blindfolded in a dark room. That’s the key, learning the facts backwards, forwards, as best he can, all to keep any semblance of them escaping from out between his clenched teeth.
Dean knows the relief of coming back alive, the one that makes you cling that much tighter to those you came back to, and he’s going to milk it for all it’s worth.
Castiel stands almost before he knows he’s doing so; there’s a pull that tugs the very core of himself towards the faithless man before him, as if his own flickering grace wants to obey the laws of diffusion physics. He halts, standing an arm’s length up and over from Dean’s now upturned face. Upturned, upended, his expression clouds with wariness, but there’s something like a challenge in the tilt of his jaw, hunger in his open mouth.
Sam drops his hand a little to glare at him. “Fuck you, dude, I’d have more about the end of the world. Either—
“Five minutes ago, you didn’t know shit! Okay? Don’t get all,” he gestures in Sam’s direction, “with me.”
Cas hums, neither downtrending nor hopeful but somewhere between. Open to interpretation, maybe, the kind with scribbly annotations and open Wikipedia tabs. The kind that’s hard, sure, but reveals something you’ve long been searching for, connects some swarm of unseen dots.
“Whatever,” Cas says, like he’s tasting it, so Dean’s a little jealous of a goddamn word now, but it’s fine. The tension around his eyes doesn’t entirely go away and Dean doesn’t even mind; the lines of his face when he squints have always kinda made the back of Dean’s knees go hot anyway.
“What do you want,” Cas says, but his voice, so close to the fragile shell of Dean’s ear, doesn’t hold much of a question. There’s a severity he adopts while he’s trying to consume Dean whole that makes him wanna shiver, shake, tell the truth. He sighs out something piecemeal and broken instead.
Cas huffs a little under his breath. “Don’t make me leave you here,” he says, doing the opposite and crowding Dean right back up against the unyielding barrier of his own door. Despite the contradiction, the pit of Dean’s stomach twists like a rope, because—that’s the crux of it all, isn’t it?
Dean’s expression cracks open—jaw slacking, eyes half-lidded—oozing apart until all that remains is the bare skeleton of an animal need. He swallows.
“I’m still clearing out boxes of what I can only hope aren’t cursed objects from the closet near my room,” Cas says. “The cult presence is very much a lingering one, Dean.”
“Hm.” Dean pumps his hand a few times, not quite with the intention of going anywhere with it, but with a goal in mind that’s achieved when Cas lets out an unguarded huff. “How much?”
The words do not belong to Castiel, and yet they have sprung from his own mouth. Tower of Babel indeed.
“Never surrender to Michael,” are the words that form without his control. “Promise me. You—he does not deserve you.”
Cas sighs, rubs his forehead with his hand and Dean’s, the world’s stupidest ape, is distracted by it. Who’d he learn that from? Not Dean. The world leaves its fingerprints all over Cas even without his help.
“Because it’s true, man! They’re three bucks more and I can hold like, ten of ‘em in one hand. Oh, grab another thing of mustard while you’re out.”
Dean exhales as noisily as he can through his lips and places the final can of black beans in the cabinet with a thunk. “You
“Hey,” he says, face buried in the side of Cas’ neck, his attempt at halting successful. He’d known it would be.
“So,” Sam says, smashing through ice he might not even know is there—with Sam, there’s always a good 50/50 chance he has absolutely no idea about the tension he’s just stumbled into. Younger siblings, Dean guesses. “You see they’re advertising for chicks out at that Orscheln’s in Smith Center? Like five bucks a pop.”
Dean tilts his head, hungry in only the most satisfactory way, the itch of teeth already open and poised over flesh. “Tell me anyway.”
Sam laughs, tired but genuine. “Whatever, man, as long as it’s not world-ending, I guess you can take your time,” he says, making as if to get up. “I’ll just—”
hey there thanks for reading! I’m committing the cardinal sin of changing the chapter count im sorry my pacing was off and this has been sitting half finished in my documents for so long I want it out I want it gone but I’ll be back in like a month with more bullshit don’t worry! As always any comments or kudos are much much appreciated thank you sm!!
“Hey, so,” Dean says, instead of answering the unspoken question present in his tilted head. “I know you’re busy but, c’mon—Kansas City. It’s against the law to not stop in for some barbecue.”
Cas makes a noise into the private sanctuary of Dean’s neck, and Dean can’t help but echo it, muffled by the loose hand still over his mouth. It’s almost enough, Cas covering him, inside of him, taking him apart. He’s almost forgotten the rawness of having it all torn away.
“Is it good?” Cas says, and Dean knows he’s not really looking for a direct answer. “I want it to be good, unendingly, what you need, deserve—I’ll take you apart, I’ll look upon your interior and I will not tell a soul.” Adjusting his grip, “please, let me, show me, please, Dean, I—”
He opens his mouth, stop starts a few sentences in vain, and then just gives up on all of it; instead, he plants a hand on Cas’ knee and clings for dear fucking life. Cas tilts his smile towards him like he’s heard him anyway.
The breadth of Dean’s sigh is tremendous. “Good, that’s—thank you,” he says, scrubbing at his face rather than keep eye contact. He laughs very slightly. “God, what a—you see what I mean, now? Stupid.”
“Hey, I’ll drink to that,” Sam says, raising his beer. “To the end of fighting over dumbshit secrets.”
“Do you,” Castiel pauses, whatever lure his grace is experiencing now polluting the air around them, plucking at their edges, “want that?”
“No one has fled crying,” Castiel says, shifting his gaze up towards the stained popcorn ceiling. “So I must say: much improved.”
“No, it’s not,” Sam says. He sighs. “A little less because I have faith in you two crazy kids to work this out quick, and more because my girlfriend’s gonna be a little annoyed if I show up trying to move in, but. No, it’s not.”
Dean breathes through the harshness of a sob, jaw left slack in the aftermath; they’re already made of too much momentum to even consider it. “I’d beg you not to.”
Cas lets something free from his throat, a keen, a moan, some muted kind of banshee howl, but Dean barely has time to register the meaning behind it before Cas is kissing him all over again.
“Well, be sure, alright? If customer satisfaction has anything to do with it, you’re not going out of business any time soon.”
“What?” Dean says. His eyes flick between Castiel’s as he fails to speak. “Are you gonna tell me you, ah,” he swallows, “‘find my lack of faith disturbing’ or whatever again?”
It’s not a penance, unless it is, unless it should be, but it’s not. It’s just—Dean’s giving him some space. Both of them some space. It’s not his fault it stretches into the next week.
,” Sam says, joining in a little like he doesn’t know if he’s allowed. “Shut up, I’m trying to be supportive.”
Cas drops his hand and the look in his eyes makes Dean’s stomach begin the slow chemical transformation into lead.
“The upcoming local school board election, Dean, what do you think? Whatever’s going on with you and Cas.”
—and then it’d be apple pie, shutting his brain up with the hands and teeth and dick of the first guy who looked at him twice across a hazy bar. Which isn’t to say he turned women down, because boy, he did
The permission ends as Dean turns his face down and away from Castiel’s reaching fingertips. “Yeah, well,” he says, clearing his throat. “What’ve you got to compare it to?”
It all scratches Castiel in exactly the wrong way. “I’d say that the end of the world is dire enough, yes,” he says, spine straight; his back does not graze the rounded cushion of the armchair.
“I, uh, get what you’re saying,” Dean says. “It is nice, to not be arguing with you over something stupid for the entertainment of some asshole’s studio audience.”
“No—no, Castiel,” she said, slowly shaking her head.  “If I don’t—You have to protect the baby.  My parents.  Take him to my parents—”
He didn't even realize what was happening until his vision was darkening around the corners and his temple felt like it had been split open.  Everything was sideways and spinning.
The week had gone by in a whirlwind of last minute arrangements, readying the Impala for the long journey, and wrapping up whatever projects he had at the garage.  But the time had finally come.  Tomorrow, he and Sam would be hitting the western road on their way to Dad.
"Sure.  It'll be just like old times."  She was walking slowly backwards along the perimeter of the fence now.  "How about tonight?  Say, seven?  We could watch a movie at my place."
The curtain was pulled back again and Sam peeked his head through.  “Hey,” Sam said, seeming pleased to find Dean awake.
He ended up in a dead end hallway that ran along the back of the house. There were doors to three bedrooms along the walls. A tall window, nearly floor to ceiling, was at the end of the long, straight hall. It made Castiel pause. There was something familiar about that window. Something strange swept over him—a chilled kind of numbness. He’d never experienced it before, but he thought it might be what humans refer to as déjà vu.
"Easy!" Dean yelled, trying to rip his arms away, but they wouldn't budge.  Kubrick flared out Dean's jacket and started going through the inside pockets.  He pulled an ace out of one and a queen of hearts from the other, and held them up for Gordon to inspect.
Dean didn’t know why that made his breath trip in excitement.  It wasn’t like he’d get any credit for the idea. The creatives would take it and make it their own, and the head honchos would get more money in the bank.  He’d still be answering phones. What did it matter to him? Cas probably wouldn’t tell them it was his idea, anyway.
She glanced up and saw a tall woman with light brown hair walking toward her.  She was wearing a linen regency dress and a diamond necklace, far more elegant than the frock and corset the outlaw currently had to suffer inside.  A cat-like smile was already pulling at the woman’s face.
, Cas?  Huh? What do you want?” Dean demanded.  “Why the hell did you even bring me here?  Fuck—why are you even my friend? What, am I just another charity project to you?”
The door clicked when Zachariah closed it. Dean put as much space between them as he could. He turned around, watching Zachariah carelessly dump his bag onto the floor. He held up the boots, turning his nose up at them in disgust. “These filthy things. Do you know
He said it like it was nothing at all.  Like it was easy. Like toying with people’s lives was excusable.  Like it wasn’t his problem. Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing.  God, had Cas always been this way? He couldn’t quite reconcile this Cas with the one he knew.
Castiel cleared his throat in an attempt to rid himself of his discomfort. He handed the bottle back to Dean. Even after only a couple sips, he could already feel his thoughts going fuzzy—but he
, Dean Winchester. Lingering, clinging to something that was no longer there. Unable to accept that he was a different person than he was before he found Cas in this life. Different from Dean Winchester. But different from Dean Wesson, too.
Uriel looked as if he knew the implications of that, and it only gave him more reason to follow Castiel’s plan.  “Yes. I will speak to him. But that’s all I’ll do, Castiel. I will keep my mouth shut and allow you to proceed, but I won’t get involved further.”  He looked at Dean again, almost sneering. “Not if this plan of yours fails.”
He grunted and fished his keys out of his pocket.  Walking around to the driver's side, he got into the car.  Before he could even start the engine, Cas had climbed into the passenger seat.
Cas shook his head again. He wrapped his fingers around Dean’s wrists. “Even if we did, there’s nowhere we could go where we could be together.” Dean wanted to tell him that wasn’t true. They could go west. They’d keep to themselves. No one would look twice at them. “My father is connected. He will find us and you will be the one to pay the price.”
He couldn’t take it anymore.  He bent his elbows, arcing his body downwards.  He supported his head with one arm and moved the other down to jack himself off.  Cas was still moving inside of him and around him, alternating between flattening and spearing his tongue.  Dean worked himself hard, broken noises escaping his throat. It didn’t take very long for his vision to go dark, and he was spilling out with an aborted shout.
coming.  “But most of my trips are spent in a conference room.  The only parts of the world I’ve really seen are office buildings.  And on the rare occasion I do have time to myself, I . . .”
“Leave me alone,” he said.  He’d wanted it to sound like thunder, rolling and deadly.  It had sounded instead like the dying of the world before winter.
“No.” He offered his upturned palm to Dean. Dean’s face pinched warily. His eyes flickered between Castiel’s hand and his face. Castiel huffed, because it was simple. Why didn’t Dean just
just as a little behind the scenes tidbit, if anyone is interested - i obviously made the last dance(s) set to vieuxtemps, which you can listen to on the
Castiel pushed slightly backward to get a better look at him.  Dean’s eyes were alight with mischief as he licked his lips and nodded sidelong at the stagecoach.
“I just mean,” Dean tried again, “what if Dean Wesson did something bad? What if it’s the reason this is happening to us?”
He took a few steps forward, still standing much too far away.  "I just need a little bit of time to figure out what's going on here."
Dean quickly looked back at his screen.  He scanned his eyes across it to make it look like he was reading.  Next to him, he was aware of Max and Alicia still chatting, but he couldn’t hear a word they were saying.
Cas seemed to get the message, even though he only looked more confused.  “No, Dean, we were never—that was one time—we only—.”
Cas stepped up close into his personal space, but it wasn't like it usually was.  There was no warmth or comfort in it.  Dean wanted to recoil and play dead.
Dean glanced around the airport terminal from his place on his chair.  Despite the fact that it was early morning on a Tuesday, there were a ton of people around him scattered along the rows of chairs.  Most of them looked like business travelers, but there were a few families with unruly kids around that seemed to be taking advantage of the off-season vacation deals.  More people rolled their carry-on bags down the walkways towards their gates.  Dean’s gate was still closed up tight, and the attendant at the desk next to it was helping a line of customers with their tickets, wearing a smile way too big to be anything but murderous.
Dean didn’t know what to say to that. Cas sounded too damn genuine. He broke the heaviness hanging around them by saying, “No problem. Your wedding gift to me can be a blowjob.”
“Thank you,” he told them both, signing it for Eileen as he spoke. He didn’t know much ASL, but he’d picked up some from her and Sam over the last year and a half.
Cas laughed again, now that Dean’s knees were hanging off the bottom of the bed and he was standing between them.  Dean lifted his head up to look at him, taking in the flush on his chest and thighs, his bruised lips, and erratic hair.  His gaze landed on Cas’ dick, and Dean bit his bottom lip, wondering if they had any petroleum jelly.  Probably not.
