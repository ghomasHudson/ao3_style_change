Then, somehow, they had made it through the door, and Sherlock had pinned him to the wall and was peeling John’s coat from his shoulders. Hot, desperate gasps left their mouths between frantic, tortured kisses. John found the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt and unfastened them, locking onto Sherlock with lust blown eyes. They were climbing the stairs and struggled with the door to their place, laughing in heavy, short breaths. Sherlock took John’s face in his hands and fell still. There they were, after all this time, standing in the open door of
“Search for Spock, huh? Didn’t take you as an Original Series fan. I thought Next Gen for certain, maybe Deep Space Nine.”
John remembered that Sherlock had mentioned two copies. John laughed, knowing that wasn’t the case. It was a Polaroid. Who copies a Polaroid? Sherlock obviously could not part with them, not until ten years after the fact. He carefully tucked the precious images back into the envelope and pulled out a third.
John sat atop the compound, focusing his night vision. The scorching heat had disappeared and now the cold of night was sweeping in, sneaking through his uniform. There were suspicions that an attack may take place on base sometime this week. Political shifts had once again stirred the population in Afghanistan. John had not been able to keep any kind of sustenance down for three days. He was exhausted, weak and well past anxious. The captain leaned back against the mud bricks of the rooftop and watched for heat readings. This was his fourth night shift. Everything was running together.
“Faster, John.” John dug his fingers into Sherlock’s hips to ground him. The sound of skin on skin was tantalizing.
John winked, snagged his gloves off the small table in the foyer, and shut the door with a click. The trio flagged down a cab and shot off in the dark towards the heart of London.
Molly climbed up onto the stage and sat next time him. “I’m here to listen, if you need someone to talk at.” She gingerly rested a hand on his shoulder. He leaned into her touch.
“So where’s your actual home then?” John inquired. Adele was singing through the opening credits. John was tempted to fast-forward. He chuckled as Sherlock grabbed the remote and did it for him.
John could feel the eagerness nestling in his bones, waiting for Sherlock to step out again. Finally, in pure white light, Sherlock came back to the stage. He was dressed in black and white, his feet bare. John could see each muscle strain and relax under his tight clad legs, his brown, cropped hair still for now. The lighting played games on John’s eyes: Sherlock’s jaw was strong and smooth, his cheekbones high and sharp under a set of pale eyes. They closed as he rested on his knees and folded his chest down, extending his arms straight out in front of him, palms down on the floor.
Jane appeared and placed her right hand on top of Kirsten’s to keep it from shaking. Jane’s grin was huge and it warmed John’s heart.
.” John felt heat rising in face, knowing his ears were turning pink with anger. This was his best mate, the least he could do is show a little support.
“I love you so much, Molly. I’m so happy for you.” Jane managed through the sound of the music and other people singing.
He waved his hand dismissively, agreeing they were all healthy, and likely attractive to most people, but Sherlock had long since forgotten how to cater to desire or sexual attraction. Transport. He was just about to turn away when he made eye contact through the window. He was blonde, a bit on the shorter side, with fierce, blue eyes. He was laughing, clapping his friend on his shoulder, when their eyes met. His face fell instantaneously. Sherlock recognized the blonde’s friend; it was Callum, Molly’s fiancé. The gears shifted and clicked: they were a rugby team. And judging by their state, they just won a match. The blue eyes held his, switching back and forth, dropping to Sherlock’s mouth and back up again. Sherlock felt a shiver pass through his spine. Was this how people felt when he observed them? It had been years since he had felt this sort of vulnerable. He could see Irene watching them, knowing she was as fascinated as he was with this man’s attentiveness. Eventually, the blonde dropped his eyes, licked his lips, and turned his attention back to Callum.
He allowed himself the pleasure of resting his eyes on the best man. John stood next to Callum, hands clasped in front of his hips with a resilient posture. Sherlock wondered if he was raised by a military man; so many things about John seemed meticulously in check. Even his hair, mussed about with product, looked perfect.
The tutoring session continued on as Sherlock broke down complex ideas into tiny, infantile ones. John was always amazed that, despite Sherlock’s outrageous opinion of himself, he never made John feel stupid or ill-prepared during their reviews. Holmes always said “
“It’s not that Eccleston is gone. Don’t get me wrong, he was a fantastic doctor. I just feel so badly for Rose. I think Clara is the only other companion that had to watch their Doctor die, or regenerate... 9 isn't much like 10. That must be so hard. I couldn’t imagine…”
It took them nearly three hours to finish their takeaway, and by the end of it, John was in far too deep.
Sherlock stood in the living room of John’s flat, towel wrapped around his waist. Water was beading from his hair down his chest and he felt his skin break out in gooseflesh.
“Sherlock. You are a man of many incredible gifts. You are brilliant, clever, brave, and too fearless for your own good. You are a bully at times, a menacing kisser, the best person to share a bed with. You are calm and composed, but more beautiful than ever when you fall apart. You are loyal, faithful, forgiving and patient. You are a fantastic penpal, a fierce friend, the most human human being I have ever met… and I do not deserve you.”
The passerby of Kandahar were blank faced. The children carried weapons far more fearsome than Watson’s own. He eyed them cautiously. Kids eight years of age propped semi-automatic machine guns over their frail, tiny shoulders. John had no idea when or how things would escalate in this life-sucking city, but he knew when they did, it would not go well. The dust shifted with every footstep. Everything was covered in it; the filthy powder was inescapable. One thing was certain: there was no sign of real life here, only empty shells of humans. John nervously checked the magazine of his gun and tucked it safely in the back of his pants. The weight calmed him; it felt familiar. Familiarity had become a danger to John. It served as a distraction; it was an idea so foreign and far away. He missed the second hand smoke from Sherlock’s careless habit. Missed lending a lighter to those lithe fingers. What John Watson would give to trace the jaw line of the chemist’s face. He would give anything. Anything at all.
"It shouldn't have been either of you." A tear broke free and rolled down the bridge of Sherlock's nose. "I'm so sorry, John. I am so sorry."
John felt colder in a matter of seconds. He had been perfectly content pretending he would never have to walk onto the Afghanistan tarmac again. “January third is my flight.” He shoved his hands deeper into his pockets, feeling heavy as lead.
without him, breathe without him, make an inane and pointless decision without him. He had floated so far away before John waltzed in with his clever mouth and kind, blue eyes. John had run with wolves and never wavered. The detective was finally grounded, steady, safe, and happy.
The accessory found the floor with a thud. Sherlock turned to face the large mirror hanging in the bathroom, french doors opened wide granting visual access to the vanities and cold tile floor. He found John’s eyes once again through the mirror’s reflection, and returned his attention to the buttons of his grey shirt. John could feel his heart accelerating as Sherlock hit the last pearlescent fastening, his eyes never leaving John’s. As he shrugged out of his clothes, John watched the muscles of Sherlock’s back flex and relax, like finely tuned gears shifting in and out of place. His mouth watered as he pictured sinking his teeth into the strong deltoid leading up to that gorgeous, alabaster neck. After an infinitesimal amount of time, the shirt hit the marble floor.  John allowed himself the pleasure of feeding on Sherlock’s structure; the delicate musculature of his shoulders, and how that anatomy flowed seamlessly into the whipcord flesh of his back. John traced the strong outline of Sherlock’s ribs, down to the waistline of his pants. He released his eyes from Sherlock’s gorgeous arse back to the mirror, where Sherlock stood staring, worrying his bottom lip in a way that made John want to do it for him. Sherlock smiled deviously. “You’re being quite polite. That was rather the opposite of my goal.”
She felt the tears blossom before she could have any say so. She stood there awkwardly, unsure of her voice and knowing if she spoke, she would only cry more. Dr. Phillips pulled her into his chest and held her as she shook. He patted her hair and squeezed her tight to him. “It’s going to be okay, Jane. I know.” Her arms were folded up between their chests.
“Sorry, John Watson.” Irene giggled, and then looked a bit ill. John could have socked her in her gorgeous, red mouth. Damn her.
Callum smacked John’s ass, and John yanked his head up, snarling. “Fucking shit, Callum. Do you really have to wake me that way?”
John crawled on top of him and took the coffee mug from Sherlock’s hand. He kissed Sherlock gently on the mouth. “And I would have read a fifty thousand word novel,” he whispered. Sherlock wrapped his hands around John’s waist.
"Absolutely wretched, John. I loathe it. How do you do it?" Sherlock's eyes softened a bit, his eyebrows high in his head in a look of disbelief.  "I just wanted milk."
“Just our regular would be great, Jess, thanks,” John responded, pulled out a chair from their high top by the street window.
And that was all he needed. Jess brought a second glass, and the boys drown into their routine, like nothing had ever happened. And in the back of John’s mind, he knew nothing had. Nothing was different, not really. Not in Callum’s eyes, or anyone else's. Did he really need anything more?
Sherlock plugged the tub, white on the outside and navy on the inside, and let the water run as he made himself a hot cuppa.
“Excellent. Tell her I said thank you. I’m sorry I’m not there to help, love.” John could hear Molly on the other line, murmuring something or the other about earning forgiveness. John blushed.
Sherlock’s mouth was at John’s neck, lips moving against the shell of his ear. John’s own erection twitched in his tight jeans as Sherlock’s voice, pure sex, certainly, sang low in his ear.
“Helping me make a point, John. I told you about the murders.” Sherlock’s eyes found John over the bright pink of the dead woman’s suit. They were dark. John could hardly see the pale irises. Was Sherlock high? “Also, you get to see me work. I do enjoy an audience...” Holmes looked like he could devour John whole, right there. Watson felt gooseflesh on his arms. He imagined Sherlock undressing him with his eyes. Nope, not high. Aroused.
“Oh, that is quite sad. I admit to being wrong so rarely that you believe you have heard incorrectly?”
He shook his head, attempting to clear John Watson out of it, at least for the time being. He was hosting auditions tomorrow, and needed to be attentive, well rested and selective. He pulled out a folder and flipped through the candidates: Mary Morstan, Jim Moriarty, Sally Donovan, Janine Taylor, Bill Wiggins, Philip Anderson, Soo Lin. They were an odd array of possibilities and Sherlock didn’t know how to feel about any of them. He gathered up his sketches, tucked them into his backpack and downed the last, warm bit of his hot toddy. He gave a two fingered salute to the bartender as he pushed his way out into the cold.
“Sherlock.” The detective’s eyes were red and blinking furiously. He seemed so small and young on the couch, curled up with his cashmere covered feet stuffed deep into the sofa cushions, holding that tiny slip of paper as if it were the most precious thing he had ever encountered. John knelt in front of the couch, and pulled the ring from his pocket. He watched Sherlock’s chest hitch at the sight of it, and John grinned. He was a live wire. Fear left him and was replaced with courage, want, and excitement. The eyes of the man he loved were blue tonight, and John held them as he spoke: “I can't let another day of our
Sherlock stood in the kitchen, feet freezing on the tiled floor. “Yes, that would be good,” he answered hesitantly. John extended the cup to him before leaning in and planting a soft kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. “Thank you, John.”
“Why didn’t you say anything?! Molly! Take a picture! I’m twinning with John Watson. Literally. Like in every way. That is so weird, holy shit!” She gave John another thorough look, from top to bottom, and grinned.
“Nothing. It’s just… you just said please.” John casually lifted his hand to his mouth in an attempt to stifle a quiet laugh. Sherlock felt the corners of his own mouth turn up, and a small sound escaped. Watson giggled in response, a different laugh than the others. Less guarded and constructed. The sound warmed Sherlock’s skin. Was that even possible? For a sound to warm one’s skin?
John stepped back and used his jumper sleeve to wipe the wet from his face. “Sometimes?” He looked up at Sherlock, swollen and watery-eyed. John hesitated a moment, and decided to continue the sentimental streak. “You are the first person in my life to believe I am something of worth. Thank you.”
“You were asleep on the floor by the sofa. You looked uncomfortable, so I brought you here. Do they really make you sleep in the dirt in the desert? They really are tight-fisted.” Sherlock sipped his tea.
Callum was an interesting man. Sherlock had properly surmised everything important about him when they first met, or so he had originally thought. While he was ordinary in the most ordinary ways, he was also a man of great spirit, courage, and gumption. He loved Molly with every ounce of his being, and this brought warmth to Sherlock’s heart. Some believed him to be unfeeling, but that was far from true. So very far indeed.
Sherlock arrived back at his hotel as the sun was rising. He slipped into his hotel room and ran a shower as he slipped out of his running shorts and trainers. It had been months since he had resorted to running in order to clear his head, but he didn’t have a stage of his own to work out his frustrations on, so the seven mile run would just have to do. He glanced at his watch. Two hours until auditions. Perfect. He put on a pot of coffee, having picked up something better than the god awful hotel blend, and slipped into the steaming bathroom.
sounded as if it were spoken with an “F” instead. John bit back a smile at hearing Sherlock’s other name from someone else’s mouth. It sounded light less absurd coming from this girl, rolled off her tongue a bit better than John’s.
And with a swipe of his finger, the message was gone. And the day passed. And then weeks. And then months.
John smiled at the sound of Jane’s laugh. It was a cross between a giggle and guffaw, and was oddly endearing. “What exactly qualifies as a non-adult beverage? Do you have juice pouches in that fridge?”
John packed the last sixer in the fridge when the bell rang to the front door. He let out an exhale, gave a stern, reassuring nod to himself, and made his way to the foyer. His teammates were piled up on the stairs, grinning and toting drinks of all kinds under their coated arms and mitted hands.
*The Bond movie referenced is Skyfall, in which Adele sings "Skyfall" in the opening credits. Yet another must see if you have not.
of Scotland Yard. The kiss was fierce; heavy with appreciation and graditude; it was laced with a quiet, desperate kind of want. Sherlock released John and kept his hold on the lapels of his coat. John stared at him in shock, soaking in the fact that, had there been any question to anyone about them before, it was answered just now. He forced himself to furrow his brow and look stern.
“God, you’re brilliant,” John panted. Sherlock was straddling John’s hips, leaned forward and nuzzling his neck. John could feel Sherlock smiling against the curve of his jaw, warm heat finding his skin in gentle huffs from Sherlock’s mouth.
“Earl Grey all right?” he called from the kitchen. He heard Sherlock arranging their food on the coffee table in the sitting room.
John rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest. He glared at Sherlock, obviously trying to feel out how serious he was about this proposition. Sherlock held his ground, stood taller and raised a defiant eyebrow. John concluded he was completely serious. With a sigh, he padded into the sitting room and selected a thin, burlap colored book from a shelf.
“Take the tea with you, if you like. I’ll come by later to pick up the mug.” They exchanged small smiles and he left the room, closing the door with a soft click behind him.
So please know, this "writer" would be absolutely nothing without her fantastic readers. I am so fucking thankful for you.
Jameson is a delicious Irish whiskey I have been recently introduced to. I drink it neat, but even knowing my pacing, it can knock me on my ass sometimes. I imagine Watson wanting something to get the job done quickly when he is in a dark place.
"Don't touch me." John muttered under his breath, his words bitter and cold. Sherlock squared his shoulders.
“It’s... it’s fine, I just thought, you know, that you were eager to come home to me and you never mentioned anyone overseas. I didn’t know you were planning to… to… get married, or propose, or whatever, to someone I had not even heard of. And then I had your letters… I was just horribly confused as to why you would write those things to me when you had someone else.”
“You can thank yourself for making me so desirable.” He winked at Jane and planted a quick kiss to her cheek. “What about you? Met anyone nice?”
“About twenty-two miles. Shouldn’t take long.” He extended his canteen to Sherlock. The brunette rolled his eyes and snatched it from him, unable to deny his own thirst.
“How was it then?” John asked. Jane sensed a small amount of tension as Callum came further into the room, nursing his Imperial. They had talked and talked about it before the boys arrived. She knew Callum would be fine.
They had chosen to write their own vows, much to John’s reluctance. While Sherlock could charm his pants right to the floor, Watson knew what he was capable of in a crowd. Regardless, they were here, and John hadn’t the faintest idea what was about to come out of the brunette’s mouth.
The lurch of her stomach brought her to her feet in the nave of the beautiful church. As everyone eyed her rising, Jane stumbled out of the pew and headed as gracefully as she could to the massive doors.
Sherlock wrapped John's hand around his neck and then traced his fingers over John's scar. "Not this one, then."
While savoring Sherlock slipping down his throat, John wrapped his hand around his own cock and two thrusts in, he came.
Operation HERRICK is the UK military operation taking place in several countries, including Afghanistan. There are soldiers stationed in both Kabul, the capital, and Kandahar. John is part of a medical squadron, 250 Hull Medical Squadron, previously named the 50th Northumbrian Division.
The last parcel nearly broke John’s heart. It was tear-stained, and the writing was barely legible. Some of the letters connected together, speaking to the frenzy it was written in. And he swore. Sherlock only saves foul words for two very special occasions: absolute fury and precious drunkenness. John never thought he could see his best friend’s name and associate it so closely with agony.
He sat Sherlock down on the closed lid of the loo, and crawled on top of him. He kissed him slowly, evenly, thoroughly. There was no clashing of teeth, no growling or fierceness as John had predicted earlier in the evening. Instead, there was a flicker of heat, burning in them both, and no verbal acknowledgement of it was needed in order to be painfully aware of it. Sherlock’s strong hands were gripping into the dimples at the small of John’s back, dragging his hips in and down. John’s head lolled back in a wordless, soundless gasp as Sherlock made love to his neck. One of John’s hands was tangled in Sherlock’s hair, the other digging gently into the man’s oblique, red marks slowly blooming in the fingers’ wake. The cupids bow planted a soft kiss on John’s sternum before one of Sherlock’s hands freed itself from the clutches of John’s gray pants to run the tap. The sound of water against tile soothed John even further, the humidity beginning to cling to his skin. Sherlock pressed his fingertips against John’s chest, and John followed their inertia, up and off his legs. Sherlock placed John between his still-sitting knees, running his hands along the strong lines of John’s back, sculpted and defined. He placed his cheek against John’s abdomen, brushing open-mouthed, reverent kisses along the lines of his body. John hummed quietly, hand twisting into the soon-to-curl hairs at the nape of his neck. Sherlock’s thumbs found themselves resting inside the elastic waistband of John’s pants, Sherlock’s eyes moving upward to find John’s. Their expression was soft, laid open, vulnerable and accepting. Sherlock tugged the pants slowly down John’s legs, savoring the exposure of skin underneath. Pliant kisses were pressed to the inside of each of John’s hipbones. John’s hands found Sherlock’s resting midway down John’s thighs, and he laced their fingers together, giving a small pull upwards. Taking the indication, Sherlock rose to his feet. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, slipping his hands inside the back of his pants and pulling them down and off. One of Sherlock’s hands was cupping the side of John’s face, covering most of it in its graceful and fascinating enormity, and kissed him tenderly on the mouth. John absently reached for the curtain to the shower, stepping in backwards and pulling Sherlock in with him.
He uncrossed and crossed his legs again in an attempt to recover the lack of blood flow in his left; he had begun to feel the pinpricks in his foot. He sighed aloud into the empty room.
“Honestly, Watson. With all due respect, shut the hell up. We fucking love you, man. You’re our Captain. We’d follow you into a fucking oceanic abyss if you asked us to.” Jasper tipped his hat and winked. “We can take a little heat. Figured you’d know that by now.”
“I vow to put body parts in containers before storing them in the refrigerator.” A wave of laughter swept through the crowd, and John smiled, pleased to know others appreciated Sherlock's morbidity and love for the odd as he did. “I vow to wash my own socks, since you cannot properly pair them, replace the earl grey when we run out, with my favorite brand as it is better, and to wash the tub after experiments. I vow to try to remember things of significance, like your birthday or our anniversary, to pick up take away on evenings you are particularly cross with all the world, and to mute the telly when you go to bed.” Their life flooded in front of John’s eyes: what a perfect one it was. “John…” Jawn. God, yes, even now. “I vow to look after you, take care of you and protect you, as long as you are alive and breathing on this earth. I vow to do my best to never take advantage of your kindness—“ John scoffed. “generosity, and forgiveness. I vow to listen before I dissect your words and thoughts. But more than anything else, John Watson, I promise to remain the man you have always known and have always loved. You have endured a lifetime of hardship, war and tragic loss, but through all things, remained the same. I vow to be a rock solid foundation you can lean against, to love you and cherish you for everything you were, everything you are, and everything you are yet to become.” John swiped his handkerchief over his face, eyes smiling at Sherlock. The lithe fingers now held a silver band instead of a menthol cigarette from a past-life, and with these, he slid the ring over John’s knuckle, bringing it to rest in its new home.
My Harriet is obviously quite different than the drunkard we have heard of in the show. Her and John were two years apart, and very close.
Sherlock’s back hit the pillow as John hit his knees. Lacing his arms underneath Sherlock’s legs, he gave him a firm tug. A small chuckle escaped from Sherlock’s lips and John grinned before burying his face in Sherlock’s silk-wrapped erection. The laughter shifted to soft tremblings as John set to work.
John stared blankly into the mirror, fooling with his tie for the fifth time. His felt as though his nerves were exposed and everything, even the tiniest breath, made his insides lace up tight. He took a deep breath, feeling the gray jacket shrink around him as his chest expanded. There was a quiet rap at the door.
John took a deep breath and sighed. “Damn.” Quiet giggles and whispers carried. “I’ve made you quite the sentimental prat now, haven’t I?” Sherlock chuckled softly, nodding. John held out his left hand and examined it. He wrapped all ten fingers around Sherlock’s.
John slipped the ring over an elegant knuckle and Sherlock pulled John’s hand to his mouth, planting a kiss on the silver band that now rested there. And then they were given permission: Sherlock wrapped an arm around John’s back and pulled him as close as he could, ribcage to ribcage. The silver eyes were staggering and John drown in them, certain it was the best decision he had made in all his life. Fingers were at the nape of his neck, twisting their way into the wild curls, and then their mouths met. The world went white and John smelled cedar, cinnamon and Sherlock.
They arrived at the church a few minutes early. Large, wooden doors were opened as they entered into a humble cathedral, tucked away from sight. It wasn’t much to see on the outside with its half timbered frontage; inside, the stone ceilings vaulted high above them, and the aisle lead to a massive organ, bronze colored pipes disappearing up into the darkness of the church. While St. Bartholomew the Great was a somber and severe shell encasing the memorial of Sam, it was full of people, far more than Jane had anticipated. A woman with rich, brown hair, tired eyes, and the sweetest smile gently touched Jane’s shoulder. “You must be Ms. Jesep.” Jane had never met this woman, but she could see the boy she adored in her face, in the dimple in her left cheek, in the way she fidgeted and the warmth of her presence.
was on the shelf underneath, and Sherlock pulled it. The spine was worn, the pages broken in and smelling slightly of cedar and John’s cologne. He inhaled and smiled. The front cover had an inscription:
John leaned against the wooden frame of the bedroom door and admired him. It was early, eight something or other, and they had returned to the flat in the obscene hours of morning. Their cases had been consistent, demanding and quite a few of them incredibly dangerous. Last night, John had been certain they both were going up in an explosion of cement, fire and chlorine. It had been pure misery, watching Sherlock’s face twist in panic, watching him as he desperately tried to smother it with indifference. It was a dead giveaway to Moriarty: they were each others ultimate weakness. If either of them needed to be taken down, simply target the other and whatever you desire will become yours.
"And St Helens wins, yet again, 45-15 against Ireland. Next up in the International Cup, St Helens versus Scotland."
Dari* surrounded him. John could see nothing through his open eyes. He blinked. Had they taken his sight? A stabbing sensation overtook both his arms; he was hanging from his wrists, his toes barely touching the ground. A searing pain ran the length of his ribs. He desperately tried to focus on the sense of his skin to decide if he was still clothed, but he could not tell. Panic consumed him. There was an agonizing drone in his ears; he was certain he could feel his brain trembling in his skull. John shook his head, and felt a white, hot heat strike across his legs. He knew instantly he was no longer protected by his uniform. Three more came across: first his shins, then his knees, lastly the top of his foot. Yet again, darkness swallowed him whole.
“I’m sorry, Jane. Who is Sam?” She felt heat rise to her cheeks as a wave of unnecessary fury consumed her. She knew better than to drink like this. She knew B wouldn’t understand because B barely knew her. And rarely ever asked anything.
“Yes, well…” Sherlock found his spot on the sofa and pushed play on the remote. “You’re very attractive, John. And fit. And you had on form-fitting denim.”
Molly’s brown eyes went as huge as saucers. “Twelve days? You haven’t talked to John in twelve days?”
“Yes. I did, in fact.” Sherlock let his other hand follow the curve of John’s arse and slide into his back pocket.
life pass without telling you this… I love you. And to love you has been the most incredible gift I have ever received. I cannot remember my life before you were in it, nor do I wish to picture my future without you there. I was so alone and I owe you so much. You have saved me in hundreds of ways. While I know I am not worthy of your love, please consider giving me the honor of proving my affection for you every day of the rest of our lives. We can die any day, last night was evidence of that, and I want you to know, whenever that happens, that I love you more than myself, more than anything else this earth could ever muster up to offer. Sherlock Holmes, will you marry me?”
“I owe every one of you an apology. I’ve been a fucking prick these last two weeks, and you’ve done nothing to deserve it. You have busted your arses day in and day out, giving me tens of hours extra of practice time while never once complaining, listened to me bitch and moan and be absolutely foul, offered up solutions when my own head was too clouded to offer them...” He looked to them for a response, and felt a warmth bloom in his chest at the sign of Rhys’ smiling eyes and Callum’s silent chuckle, pressing him to continue on. “I was a right arsehole. You were fantastic. You will win this match today, and it will not have a damn thing to do with me. Just wanted you to know I’m fully aware.” He waited for the crash of emotion to pass, and finished. “As always, boys, you save me, each and every day. Now. Let’s get the fuck out on that pitch and get this shit over with. I’m looking forward to the green of Ireland.” His teammates clapped and whistled, rising to their feet, slapping each other on the back and grinning like fools. A tear leaked from John’s eye as his brothers traveled through the entryway out onto the green of the field, under the bright lights and screaming fans. He wiped it away brusquely, knowing despite the way his life had unfolded, nothing,
“Unzip them as well.” John watched as Sherlock pulled the tiny metal clasp, revealing silk pants glimmering between the two pieces of fabric in the dim light of the room. “Cheers,” John whispered, his throat going dry, though his mouth hardly suffered the same fate. The pants were glistening where they were pulled tight across the head of Sherlock’s cock. He reached forward, fingers outstretched, and gently ran them along the lines of the zippers, refusing to touch the hot, firm flesh resting between them.
Mmm. That was an interesting thought. Sherlock considered this for a moment, knowing it was not what John was asking, but may indeed be a subconscious thought. “They’re fine, John, thank you. You’ve done a nice job keeping up with them.”
“Me. I guess I had not slept or eaten or done things all you normal humans do. Whatever. Anyway, Mycroft knew that the disruption in behavior correlated with your departure.”
John laughed. “You’re an idiot. I don’t mean me, Sherlock. I mean in general. You’re obviously miserable, though you’re never left wanting. You make excuses for your arshole behavior and blame it on everything other than what it actually is. I don’t know a single fucking thing about you. You don’t read or write or paint or sing. You just sit. And sip tea. And observe until your brain oozes out of your skull. Aren’t you bored? Isn’t your life boring that way? Don’t people become dull once you’ve deduced them to a pile of nouns and verbs?” John stood and rested against the brick of the building. He carded a hand through his hair and sighed. “You take all the adventure out of getting to know someone, Sherlock. Whatever it is you are afraid of, you have allowed it to consume you. Devour you whole. Quite sad, really. You’re much too clever to live a life that empty. So I’m just curious. What happened?”
John was in a dark grey suit, nearly charcoal in color, with a pale blue button up underneath. It clung to him the same way Sherlock’s clothes did. He shuffled uncomfortably.
And then John Watson was sitting in the booth opposite him, mug clunking down on the table, both elbows resting on the edge. Sherlock tried not to notice, but couldn’t stop his eyes from roving over the gorgeous, rich colors of the flag on John’s left arm. He peered up at John, trying to mask his face with indifference, and felt his chest lurch at the intensity of his gaze.
“Sherlock, please. We’re fine. I’m fine. I’m right here. I’ve got you, yeah? I’ve got you.” The detective trembled underneath him. John wrapped his arms tighter around him and kissed his bare shoulders, his neck, his ear. He buried his face in the raven curls and inhaled. Cedar and chlorine. The combination gave him chills he quickly tried to hide.
Sherlock remained silent, his heart moving the same as before, but John felt his hand press into his back, grounding him.
He smashed the bulbs on the ground and located the two guards as he walked to the mouth of his torture chamber. He deftly sank the metal and glass shards deep into their necks, gave them a solid punch and left them to bleed out. He prayed he could still run a five minute mile.
John tugged his warmest fleece on over his long sleeved crew shirt. Though he knew it wasn’t cold out, the first real change in seasonal weather always threw his body off. He shivered under the wet of his hair and lack of heat in the locker room.
John stirred, his body sedated from a solid sleep. He breathed heavy through his nose and stretched his legs out on the sofa, taking time to feel the cotton around his toes and the flannel rubbing against his ankles. John opened his eyes and sat motionless as the gears of his head began clicking forward in slow motion. A tall glass of water was waiting for him on the coffee table. He grabbed it and downed two thirds in one go. Pushing the blanket from his bare chest, John sat upright on the sofa, resting his elbows on his knees as he combed through his now clean hair. He dug the heels of his hands into his eyes as he shook his head.
John nodded and gave Jane a small smile. “Are you comparing B to Ian in more ways than their movie manners?”
A pretty blonde strolled up to him. She laced her hand around his neck and leaned in: “Dance?” It was a question with a hint of assumption and shit ton of alcohol. John slid off his stool and volunteered to be led through the throng of humans. She was mild at first, keeping her distance and only lacing her knees next to John’s. Then her hands had found his chest, running from his shoulders down to the top of his trousers. John felt a bit warm under his collar as he watched her turn and wrap her long hair in a fist, pressing her hips into his. He wouldn’t reach out to touch her; this wasn’t really his scene. But it was fun, and innocent, and mildly sexy.
“It was. The cabin looks so amazing in a fresh layer of snow. Can’t believe she got one of you with your hand outstretched.” He paused on one image, Molly standing on the fresh powder, holding her bouquet of forest foliage, and wrapped in the gorgeous shawl Jane had knit for her. Her mouth was open in a laugh, her eyes barely squinted. She turned her head up to him, studying his face.
The detective began tightening around John and Sherlock spilled over, crying out John’s name (Jawn… there is nothing more perfect in this universe than the sound of his name during his climax), was there an “I love you” in there, too? And John moved to deep, slow thrusts, melting into an all-consuming orgasm; Sherlock was the sun and around him, tiny galaxies burst into existence. He bit the soft skin on Sherlock’s ribs, his fingers digging deep into the detective’s thighs as he slowly came back to Earth.
“How. Are. You. So fucking delicious?” John asked between each steady motion of his hips. He barely recognized his own lust-ridden voice. What a foreign and empowering sound it was.
Captain John H. Watson fell onto his cot, shirtless and sweating. The sun was starting to set, but the Middle Eastern heat would linger until darkness fell. He thumbed the corner of the well-worn postcard mindlessly, and traced the cityscape of London with his finger. It felt like ages since he had last been home. He missed the city, missed the masses of people (or rather, feeling safe amongst a mass of people), missed take away and tea and proper shampoo. He missed the rain. He missed him, too.
“Come on, John.” Sherlock was up and out. John tucked his gun into the back of his trousers and followed him into the darkness.
“Sounds perfect,” she agreed. She stood and offered her hand. Molly pulled him to his feet and clutched his fingers tightly. “This too shall pass.”
Sherlock woke in a cold sweat. He felt his eyes dilate to readjust to the darkness. That was one of his favorite uncontrollable responses to cocaine – feeling his eyes expand and soak up everything they could absorb. That’s what the drugs were for after all, another fine tune. One extra click, another measure, just one step above his typical genius. Once he had realized that was a possibility, to be even sharper than he is in a sober state, there was no going back. He was always on point; sometimes he just needed one tiny bump of help to stay there. Not to mention his career was so dull sometimes. Too easy, figuring out where the strangled woman in the hammock came from, why she’s dead. Criminal’s foxy wife, fooling around with men she ought not to. Hire an assassin, eliminate the loose ends, or hell, sometimes they’d kill them themselves. It was rare, in his line of work, for the criminals to stoop to the level of murder. Most of them detested getting their hands dirty. They didn’t make their money doing legwork. Neither did Mycroft. Sherlock scoffed. Precious, delicate, sentimental Mycroft.
And just as he thought John was winding down, passing off to someone else, he dropped to the floor, resting back onto his hands. In a flurry of movement, John entire weight was settled on his forearms and wrists. Sherlock laughed, slack-jawed, as John began to break dance.
The couple looked up to find his eyes. They swept their hands towards them, calling their best friends onto the floor. John quirked his eyebrow at Jane and dramatically extended his hand, taking a deep bow.
Love at first sight was ridiculous. A childish concept and a shallow excuse for those who lust far more than they could ever love. But as John sat in that velvet lined seat, chin perched on his folded arms, tear tracks evident on his cheeks, he thought surely, though it was ridiculous and impossible, this was the closest he would ever come to it.
Her phone was buzzing from the kitchen, but she ignored it. In a tiny place in the back of her mind, she knew this was best for her. To be alone. All her life she had been with someone, never because she felt she
. The man slid his black-denim covered leg between John’s, and Watson felt his breath exit in one frantic rush. The song leaking from the DJ’s speakers was a huge hit in America… a slow, pulsing beat. Latch. That’s what it was.
A few moments passed and John’s face fell serious once more. “Boys. Thank you. You’re my blood. I feel as though I have to be fair. If and when this comes out to the public, it’s likely St Helens will get a lot of heat for having a… damn, a gay captain, bisexual captain, whatever. We’ll be under scrutiny, and you’ll be getting shit for my personal life. If any of you want to resign, or trade, I understand completely, I just feel as though—”
sort through it. If you could pull him out after Harry, your presence can do anything.” She leaned forward, draping an arm around his damp jersey, and touched her forehead to his. “I promise.” She brushed her hands through his wavy brown hair, curling from the wet at the nape of his neck, and pressed a gentle kiss to his lips. “Shower up. Dinner’s nearly ready.”
The violin found its home in its stand and Sherlock trotted down the short staircase to the auditory seating. He took his place next to John in the third row as he watched the medical student remove his binders and notes and textbooks. John glanced up and nodded at his presence. “You can keep rehearsing, if you want. You know I don’t mind listening.”
He felt a hand on his shoulder, squeezing him tight. “Focus, John. She’s going to be fine.” Sherlock’s voice echoed in the warehouse, replacing the cold wind with warm baritone. He lifted Harry’s arm and found a series of bruises on the soft skin inside her elbow, following the lines of her veins. He looked up at Sherlock with terror in his eyes. And then his best friend was maneuvering behind Harriet, working his arms under her shoulders. “On three, we lift her.”
John stirred under the covers and reached absently for Sherlock, only to find he was no longer there. John blinked, and then heard it.
John sighed. It was a forgiving sound, as though he disagreed but could maybe, possibly, see why you felt that way. Sherlock sensed that this was Captain Watson’s home. He never seemed distraught or homesick, never spoke much of his family or wishing for his next leave, and every single day he was on. Completely focused, wholly involved and attentive, kind and gentle but never someone who would be easily swayed or manipulated. He threw himself into his work. He was solid as steel. A shiver went through Sherlock’s body.
“Several reasons. Mostly because I want you with me. Also, you are a life saver. I just solve the crimes. Thirdly…” Sherlock stepped into John’s space with obvious intention, “I get off on it. And having you there with me will prove to be most… interesting.” His voice was nothing but a growl. Sherlock grabbed a fist full of John’s hair at the nape of his neck and gave a firm tug, granting Sherlock access to an open mouth. It was a filthy kiss, rough and hard and screamed “I will take you and you will love it.” John whimpered into Sherlock’s mouth, and just as he was about to gain his senses enough to reciprocate the I-am-definitely-taking-you-to-bed-later kiss, Sherlock was down the steps and opening the door. And then he was hailing a taxicab.
Molly turned to watch the two in the kitchen, smiling as Jane nearly choked on the concoction. John covered his mouth with his hand, trying to stifle a laugh. Jane swiped her sleeve across her pursed lips, and then set the glass down with a clunk.
Watson uncrossed his arms and set his duffel bag on the ground. He placed his hand on the small of Sherlock’s back. “I’m sorry, Sherlock.” He was met with silence. “This is what I have to do. I’ve committed to it; it’s the most sensible route to a final destination for me.”
The trio walked up to them, wiping their foreheads with the back of their hands or their shirts, whichever was more convenient. Sherlock gave a slow, late clap, chin nodding up and down.
John helped Sherlock into the cab. He shimmied in next to him, using his shoulder to prop the detective up. The door closed and they were gone from the curb. Minutes passed in silence. Sherlock hiccuped.
“Cap, have you seen Jane lately?” John’s eyes lifted in interest. He nodded and gave B a small smile.
“John?” he called out gently. Normally his intuition was in tune enough to deduce when something horribly wrong had already happened, and at the moment, he couldn’t detect any trace of that familiar pull in his stomach. There was no sound in the flat at all; Sherlock had started to wonder if he was alone when he rounded the corner to the sitting room.
Sherlock’s eyes blinked once, twice. He opened them wide, momentarily panicked at his location. He felt the heavy hand thrown carelessly about his waist. He slipped out from under it, quickly and quietly, knowing John was in the middle of a deep sleep cycle. Sherlock stood by the side of John’s bed, resting his back against the still-shaded wall of the room.
Callum’s smile faltered, followed by a look of guilt. “John, if you don’t want to come, we’ll be perfectly fine, really, don’t feel like you have to –“
John and Sherlock stepped into the car. The city was dead and eerie; no one ever saw this side of four o’clock. The driver followed a series of backstreets, to where, John had no idea. He clenched his jaw as he glared out of the myriad of droplets on the window, distorting the buildings as they passed. This was one time too many he’d had to rescue her. He was so grateful for Mycroft (a true first), but he had a sick feeling inside him. Something was terribly wrong. They stopped outside an abandoned warehouse.
Molly was dancing and planning and exhausted and exhilarated. As the weeks passed and the wedding day grew closer, her love for Callum was reiterated through sweet notes on the mirror, late night love making despite their absolute exhaustion, and the wrapping of their wounds or damaged goods, delicately washed and medicated, sealed with a soft kiss through fresh gauze.
Sherlock was standing resolutely by the window, violin still poised on his shoulder and his chin in the rest. He wasn’t tired, John decided, but he looked worn in. Not in the way John’s chair was, but in a way that would make one think Sherlock was much older than one would believe him to be.
John's eyes hardened instantly. A venomous laugh left his throat. It was a foreign and unwelcome sound. Sherlock reminded himself to put on a thicker skin. This wasn't about him, and it was not a good time to make it so. He pressed his thumb to the bend of John's elbow, where the last tattoo lay nearly hidden. It simply said "here," comma included. "Tell me about this one, then." It seemed harmless enough.
Sherlock walked in to the smell of coconut, cilantro, and peanuts. The tiny bell hanging from the door hinge jingled faintly. He approached the counter.
Molly’s brown eyes rolled a bit and she let out a mildly frustrated laugh. “Is Katherine ready?” Her eyes were sparkling. John was always amazed by Molly Hooper, but tonight, by one thing in particular:  that Callum told Molly about every woman John dated and Molly remembered every single one, in spectacular detail. He supposed he could only blame her fantastic character. John realized he probably ought to take a few lessons from her. He could never remember who had a dog and who taught kindergarten. He mostly remembered their favorite recreational activities after sunset.
Jane sat on her sofa flipping through Netflix. She wanted to watch something new, but was aware that it wasn’t likely she would feel better by doing so. Jane knew what her quick fixes were, and tonight that’s what she needed: to sober up, and to shed happy tears. She wandered into the kitchen and pulled out a tub of chocolate chip cookie dough, poured a half glass of milk, and settled back onto the couch before picking a Tennant season of Doctor Who. She’d watch as many as she needed to in order to right herself again. Even if it meant eating an entire container of cookie dough before she got there.
October passed in a rush, and before John knew it, December was around the corner. St Helens had won every match they played, always ahead by at least 5 tries, and John was thrilled. He had had little time for anything other than practice, sleep, perfecting new plays and travel to and from different places across Europe, simply to kick some ass. Their last match was the week before Christmas, and the boys had all agreed to take a week off in November to be with their families and to regain their humanity before diving headfirst back into six hour practices and scrimmages.
John leaned into Sherlock’s chest. He placed a delicate kiss on the warmth of Sherlock’s torso, sliding his hand down to the hem of his shirt. John fiddled with it absently as he began to twist his way into Sherlock’s lap.
John stood glued to the spot, digging his toes into the hardwood floors as if they would help keep him rooted. He listened as he heard caps click and water fall in various amounts, finding himself curious as to what portion of Sherlock’s body was being catered to. Nervously, he stepped up to the door and grabbed the knob. He stood there for what felt like ages, debating. Finally, he talked himself into it and opened the door.
Had someone called his name? He felt like he was wrapped up in bubble and everything, every sound was distorted. They must be mistaken. There was no Captain here. He was just a boy.
“S’okay, John. Just the way shit goes sometimes.” She used her sleeve to stubbornly wipe away the tears – John could tell she was frustrated with crying, probably having little control over stopping it once it started. She gave his hand a squeeze and moved hers away, back to rest at the sides of her legs on the counter.
three-quarters and fullback are positions of players, two of the seven "backs" positions on the team.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Sherlock. I know one good load off loosened you up. Quit pretending to be an insensitive prick.” His voice hardly shifted. He was on twenty-two, Sherlock realized. He blushed at the fact that he was keeping count. He couldn’t help it. The deltoid, traps and triceps that belonged to John Watson were things worthy of individual praise. His back was gorgeous. All tanned muscle with freckle kissed shoulders. Thirty-nine. Fifty-three. Eighty-four. Sherlock stared. Moments later, he saw his hand extending towards John’s body, without even asking permission. He quickly recoiled. What the hell was he doing?
“A clean cut doctor isn’t such a terrible thing, John.” There was a roughness in his voice that hadn’t been there before. He could feel Sherlock’s lips behind his ears. “Neither is Soldier John,” he whispered. “I’ll admit, I was nervous at first. Afghanistan has made you colder, and it has taken some time to recover your humor and gentleness. You’re still under there, just a bit more stoic, a bit bossier, a bit sexier… which I had previously believed to be impossible.”
“Sorry. I didn’t mean to sound like a prat. You could rightly tell me to sod off. I just. I don’t know, I wasn’t insulting you by asking why you lived alone. You just seem like a great guy, and I was surprised. You know. That you don’t have someone. And then Callum made a crack at you, which… I know you guys are best mates… Mols and I do it, too. I just didn’t want you to think that I was… I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m trying to say.”
John stood there a moment, soaking in a part of Sherlock he had never really witnessed before: Sherlock at peace, Sherlock asleep, Sherlock quiet. Had this man really made a habit of falling asleep on the sofa with a nightlight on? That’s what the telly reminded him of – it offered no sound, no voices to keep a presence or make a space feel less empty... it was just a light. John remembered Sherlock up at all hours of the night, tinkering under a microscope, or dragging on a cigarette as he sat folded into himself on a chair. Somehow the man never managed to look tired, but right now, as John watched him sleep, he thought he looked older. He was technically, but John saw it in another way. His eyes had gone grey and fierce in a way he was unfamiliar with. His voice had deepened, or maybe John had just forgotten how enveloping it was. He had tamed his wild hair and wild words. He remembered Sherlock resting his chin on his head in the airport, wrapping him up in a safety net. He had bought John pyjamas and warm socks, picked out bed sheets for his room, snagged his duffel before even finding John at Heathrow…
“Did you consider for a moment perhaps there was reason for that?” John’s voice was darker, and thick. Self-loathing was curling hot inside his muscles.
Sherlock rolled John's arm over to see the soft inside of his forearm. The tattoos blended together cleanly and ended in sharp edges. "Is there a theme to it?"
“Here you go, loves. Need anything, you know where to find me.” Both the boys smiled at her in thanks. Callum wrapped his hand around his mug and lifted it into the air.
“Sleep alright, boys?” John asked them, raising an eyebrow. Rhys looked a little worse for wear, but Egan looked alert and solid. As always.
“Sherlock, I would be honored.” She was beaming down at him from the stage. “Did you have something specific in mind?”
Sherlock opened the door and was greeted by a kiss from Jane and Molly. Callum gave him a firm shake and a confident smile. They hung their coats and moved toward the sound of company in the living room. Irene sat perched on the edge of John’s sofa, sporting a forest green dress and a glass of brandy. Rhys was chatting her up, hopelessly, and Egan and Violet were helping John and B with the refreshments in the kitchen. B turned to grab some ice from the freezer and smiled at Jane. She grinned back and walked up to Irene, reintroduced herself and joined Rhys on the couch. Another ring of the doorbell sounded through the small flat and Molly offered to answer.
He dug a knife out of the man’s pant pocket and stabbed it into the ground. Slowly, he bent over and rubbed the rope against the blade. He hadn’t the faintest idea how long he had been held. It could have been anywhere from three days to three months; unconsciousness does not help one keep track of time. John felt as if he hadn’t seen the sun in years. The rope fell to the ground and John twisted his hands inside the joints of his wrists. They burned and clicked, like parts of a machine that had been neglected. He stripped the beast on the ground, covered himself and quickly made his way out the door.
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open, his eyebrows rocketing near his hairline. “What was I to say?! John hasn’t spoken to me in nearly twelve days, pity me?”
“Yes. Quite, thank you.” He placed his right hand on Sherlock’s thigh, his thumb rubbing loving circles through the expensive fabric.
John was straightening the cream linens on the table. Jane was laughing as she unrolled the burlap décor, placing candles elegantly next to succulents and pine needles. He glanced at her as she busied herself with the centerpiece, and felt warmth in his chest at discovering her. She had come so far since they first met.
The song ended, and Molly was wrapped tightly in Callum’s arms. John was certain there was no better place for her to be.
It hasn't been a month and a half, but it's been damn near close. I struggled with this chapter. I ventured from and wandered back to my original plans for this content, and just ended up rolling with it. Be honest, tell me what you think.
“You should have called me, John. Whatever it was, I could have helped,” Sherlock heard himself whispering. This conversation may disappear into drunkenness forever, but he realized he needed this, even if John wouldn’t be able to recall it. “You idiot. What on earth could have possessed you to do this to yourself?” He started rinsing the suds down John’s back as he put his mind to work, piecing together the small bits of information he had. His hands stopped moving as the realization dawned on him. “Oh.
“Rhys, Egan, switch to three-quarters and fullback so Jasper can work on his tackles,” John commanded from across the field. He walked briskly, hands resting on his hips, panting from running drill after drill. Sweat was pouring from every one of the boys’ brows. Rhys and Egan obeyed, quickly trotting across the damp grass.
“Good,” she said with a small smile. “I’m sorry that we didn’t really explain the situation. You sort of went in blind.”
“No, John. You were still there, I only had to hunt a bit to find you. Afghanistan changed you; it would change anyone. But you are still the man I knew before you left. You are the same Doctor you always have been, Time War or not.” Watson’s vision blurred instantly. Sherlock kissed John’s temple and ruffled his hair before walking to the cabinet. He retrieved two glasses and filled them with wine. John chuckled.
“Hello, I’m John. Nice to meet you.” John’s expression was friendly, kind. Unlike his first glance at Graham. Sherlock chuckled at the recollection.
“Yes, all right, Jacob, thank you. Excuse me, guys. Keep working and please, god, don’t get crafty with those blades.”
“I was curious as to when you would offer up words,” the other replied, without turning to face his visitor.
Callum nodded, eyes scanning the crowd. He awkwardly pulled out the binoculars and put them to his eyes. “Wow. These things are wicked. I can literally see the panels on the stage.”
The heat disappeared and Sherlock ghosted a kiss across John’s neck. The audience cat-called. John felt the blush rising to his cheeks.
Sherlock’s last letter was indulgent. John was shocked at the reference to so many emotions, feelings, to so much humanity, in all honesty. He, of course, knew Sherlock felt. He may be a "high-functioning sociopath", but he’s no Vulcan. John had witnessed Sherlock at his very best, and also his very worst. But it was certainly unlike him to speak about sentiment, much less investigate it further. John was curious about what the conditions for Sherlock were like in London. He must be lacking in The Work to turn to petty human emotion for research.
He looked at John and shook his head. Sherlock’s expression read somewhere between bored and irritated. “No. Graham is aware, but only because he mingles with all sorts as I do. The others aren’t up to date.”
Sherlock refilled his cup, and grinning for having gotten his way, plopped down on the hounds-tooth sofa. John watched him, preening like a peacock. “Don’t look so damn smug.”
His brother was seeing someone. Sherlock wasn’t an idiot; he was a Holmes. And the Holmes knew, saw, observed all. He had noticed the sassy saunter of Mycroft’s walk, the way he caressed the handle of his umbrella when he was standing in place, the small, disgusting glint that surfaced in his eyes when he wasn’t focused or talking about The Work. Pathetic. Sherlock knew it was the Detective Inspector. Lestrade. Graham? Gavin? G-something. What did it matter? Mycroft would destroy him soon enough. He always did.
Egan spread cream cheese over his pitifully toasted bagel and smiled. “How’s Violet?” John implored. Egan was married, had been for nearly six years now. Violet was a fantastic woman, a badass and a hell of a character to have a man like Egan by her side. They were wild – outdoors all the time, hiking, kayaking, white water rafting. Last summer, they backpacked across Europe, just the two of them. John envied them, in a way. How amazing it would be, to have someone who shared so much in common with you. He felt he had never experienced that. Just a bunch of ditzy women looking for money and great sex. Anyway, Violet was four months pregnant. Most men would see the birth of a child as the end of world as they knew it, but of course Egan had wept tears of joy when Violet told him. Fucking incredible man.
“We have it good, haven’t we, John?” He saw the tears welling in Callum’s eyes, too, as he soaked in the tail end of the sunrise.
“Well…” John dissolved into a million tiny pieces as he studied Sherlock’s eyes, flickering back and forth between his own. His lids were heavy, and Watson couldn’t make out if it was due to sleep or lust. Either way, it made him feel… odd. His eyes dropped to the tip of Sherlock’s nose, sweetly rounded, dipping down to meet the curve between his cupid’s bow. That mouth. God, that mouth. Pinker with the rush of blood waking in the morning, full and pouting and slightly parted. John squeezed his eyes shut, trying to filter through the physical and pinpoint the emotional. What
