For lying awake thinking about him for two nights in a row while, obviously, he has just continued on with his life as usual the moment he left my house.
Granted, he had to climb out of a first story window, down a vine covered wall and through a small hedge to do so, but the trouble was well worth the end result.
'To come and have a look at the ball! It's all so beautiful.' A dreamy look was on her face as she stared off into the distance.
Every moment they spent together a harsh reminder that, in a couple of months, this would be the exact thing he would be missing and every moment spent apart now precious time lost.
Holmes just nods and then he's pulling John along with him. Away from the table. Away from Miss Hooper. Back towards the sea of colours and music and people that surrounds them.
He silently wishes for a miracle to happen. For time to stop and keep them here forever. Like this. Relaxed. Friendly. Sharing a drink he might have put a little bit too much strawberry in. Watson doesn't seem to mind.
'Locky?' A warm hand was on his shoulder now and soon he found himself enveloped in Mycroft's coat. The warmth and smell that was distinctly “Mycroft” and “home” finally calming his nerves just a bit.
I had thought that, by not ending things with John, I would allow myself to have at least one happy memory untainted. One boy who would live in my mind as he had been when he had been at his very best. Golden, bronzed and full of sunlight with smiles that were easily given and my name something that flowed from his lips unrepentant.
They were moving fast now. John's heels pushing into Sherlock's backside. Pushing him inside as far as he could.
Actually hurt. I might as well have physically struck him. And suddenly I think back on the bruise on his face. But somehow I can't quite bring myself to ask about that again.
John briefly contemplates just turning around and walking away but then the stranger finally does say something.
At this part of the day it has become far too hot to do much of anything at all and so Sherlock and John find themselves stretched out leisurely on their backs on the shore of the small lake near their houses.
He takes one more look over his shoulder but all he can see is the dark square of the window in the shadow of a rainy late afternoon.
As if he's afraid John will disappear if he lets go. Like so many other good and wonderful things usually do once he's over the peak of his high.
Oh yes....he had better flee......he will not be able to contain her here forever.....surely he knows this......and when she gets out.......
And when he looks at Sherlock from the corner of his eyes he sees that Sherlock has rolled onto his side, facing John.
John looked at her as she pressed her body closer against his thigh in an attempt to share his body heat, 'will you take “no” for an answer?' he tried against his better judgment.
'He was drunk behind the wheel when he lost control and crashed into the guard rail. He died instantly', John said. His voice steady. His tear streaked face and puffy eyes the only evidence left of his emotional breakdown mere minutes ago.
But what Holmes had done for him does deserve mentioning. It deserves recognition. And so, in the half-light of the inn with no other patrons around to hear, he finally works up the courage to do so.
Once class is over he'll just tell John and Molly he can't come. Pretend he's not feeling well or something.
There is the spell that Holmes has put in place so nobody in the house will be able to see or hear them, there is the gentle aura of magic that seems to follow Holmes wherever he goes like background noise, a slow and static hum, and there is also the afterglow of a most amazing orgasm.
Today Sherlock and John are not taking it easy. They've had plenty of relaxed, laid back days this last month. Getting up late, lounging in the sun together, going for a swim, sitting in each others backyards or maybe not even doing anything at all.
John is smiling again now. One side of his mouth curled upwards and I desperately want to kiss him. Find out if he tastes like warm honeyed tea.....
I'm making my way across the school parking lot towards the street and the busstop around the corner. My bag is slung across my shoulder casually and I let the autumn sun warm my face.
He wants to pull the sheet up to his chin again but if he does Watson will know he feels insecure about the situation.....that he is vulnerable.
I know I should ask him more, draw the truth out of him, but he is closing up and pulling away from me and I don't want him to leave and so I just kiss him again and he melts against me and for a couple minutes more nothing else in the world exists.
And for a moment the rest of the world just sort of disappears. There's just silence and darkness and the only light is the light coming from the screen of my phone. The words on it burning themselves into my mind and heart.
As always: a million thanks to anyone who has been reading along because it's truly all the hits and kudos and encouraging words that motivate me just that little bit extra to keep writing.
He hands me his phone and I take it with shaking fingers. I add myself to his contacts and hand it back.
aunt”, she says, “the one I'm going to take care of and that's why I can't come with you guys.......yeah.....such a bummer.”
There is a feeling in his stomach that is close to all encompassing euphoria and he is afraid that if he feeds it and lets it grow he will actually start to fly and will never come back down again.
'After our little conversation of last week I realized that, being the omega that you are, you would never be able to make a decision like this for yourself.....so I have made it for you.'
John's face lights up again and Sherlock can't help but stare at the dimple that forms in his left cheek. Right next to his mouth...and his lips.
And however much he has been trying to forget them ever since they started, now.....now he suspects that maybe.....they have been trying to tell him something.
Sherlock already knew he had nightmares every so often, usually related to magpies and death, but they seem to be coming more often now.
John can actually see the magic as Holmes takes it in his hands and weaves it into something new. Something volatile and dangerous and sharp.
Sherlock took another step towards him and slowly closed his fingers around the hand that John held extended towards him.
Master Holmes had said “first thing in the morning”, hadn't he? Confused, John took in the darkness around him. It was decidedly not morning yet.
“Ah....”, John doesn't understand what that's supposed to mean but there's no time to ask for an elaboration. They have to find Miss Hooper. And fast. If magic is involved.....she might be in some very grave danger. John's thoughts drift back to “The King” and what she had told them about him. If he's behind this.....
He had asked Sherlock about the strange flowers he had seen and how he hardly recognized any of them.
Sherlock finds solace in the fact that, although they might be heading in different directions, for the time being, the sun and the moon still occupy the same sky.
It would have been a beautiful sight if not for the look of panic on Sherlock's face and the sound of barking dogs drawing nearer.
Greg doesn't seem to be convinced. He doesn't blame him. At this point he's having a hard time convincing himself.
He didn't know where Sherlock went when he wasn't here. Up until now he he had always been here. So he couldn't go look for him.
'Good to see you're finally standing up for yourself, dear', his mother said, turning towards him. Her tone far too friendly for what John was expecting. He had thought that at this point they would have reached curse word territory at least.
“You probably used magic or something to do that”, young Sherlock grumbles as he leans his short body over the table to grab the card away from his older brother.
He ends up just buying a small bouquet of flowers because after spending almost 20 minutes in there he thinks it might be weird to just leave empty handed.
Sure he will burn himself up in the process but for one shining moment he will be more alive than he has ever been.
John gives the present another scrutinizing look, sets it down on the coffee table, pours himself a glass of whiskey, sits down and waits....
He already feels like such a bad person but if he is able to make someone feel good for a change then he's probably not completely lost....maybe......
Her eyes are cast down where she sits. She's looking at her hands where they rest in her lap. But when Holmes sits down she does look up and when she sees him her entire posture changes.
He's wearing a dark suit and top hat as he is leaned against one of the red velvet curtains. His arms are crossed and so are his legs. He seems to be alone as well. There is no drink in his hand. No partner beside him to talk to or dance with. People walk past him but nobody seems to pay him any mind. John tries to see what the man is doing, what he is looking at from his vantage point against the wall but his eyes are hard to see underneath the dark rim of his hat.
“Will you stay here”, I ask and this time he does look at  me, his eyes the deepest pools of blue I've ever seen and for a moment I almost forget what else I was going to say, “for tonight anyway....I mean.”
Of course my mother is already at work. She sits at the kitchen table typing away at her laptop. Her blond straight hair frames her face like curtains and her glasses have slipped down to the tip of her nose and she pushes them back absentmindedly.
I really hope everybody who has been reading along has enjoyed the journey and, if nothing else, has gained an interest for the source material.
When the class finally ends John doesn't immediately come over to him so they can head to the coffee-place together like he usually does.
His father rarely spoke to him anymore. Barely even looked at him and when he did the look John saw in his eyes was full of disdain and disgust.
Holmes actually chuckles then and John feels his previous worries ebb away. He finds himself laughing too.
'You have to go',  Sherlock said. His voice barely a whisper, but still sounding too loud in the quickly darkening field. The hint of panic almost visible where it clung to the edges of his words.
Finn will say that Watson will need to be brought in front of the Order. In front of the All. Let them decide what to do next.
In the light of the dying sun she sees every death she has ever encountered so far in her short life.
John's lips, his tongue, his kiss....it drives away the last remains of the ashy layer of death the last cigarette had left in his mouth.
Something he went through in his own room, alone, behind a locked door with the windows tightly shut and the curtains drawn.
With his eyes still closed he feels the corners of John's mouth curl upwards as their kiss deepens. He moves his own hands away from their warm resting place underneath John's fingers and moves them to the back of John's neck, his shoulders, his lower back. He finds that, now that he finally can, he wants to touch everything.
Well....if you could even call it that. To John it looks more like a halfway ruined shack at the side of the road. He voices his concerns to Holmes but he assures him the carriage will be quite safe there and so they free the horses and carry on on horseback from that point on.
“Please come along, Miss Hooper”, the soldier says. There is no magic in his words. It is just a friendly request but she follows it without hesitation.
“Listen...Watson”, Holmes says. His voice no more than a whisper, “whatever rumours you  might have heard about me and my.....spending habits.....that is all they are......just rumours. The Holmes family is not in debt. My brother kept a close eye on our finances and so do I.”
First he brings Sherlock's left hand to his lips and kisses the knuckles reverently. Then he brings Sherlock's right hand to his lips as well and repeats the motion.
John had really hoped that, after finding out that master Holmes could do magic....real magic.....he would be able to find out more about the why and the how gradually, bit by bit, as time went on.
Watson seems to be carrying an ax. He has it slung over his shoulder nonchalantly but his grip on the handle is tense.
The curve of the Cupid's bow lips he had covered with his own and would do so again once Sherlock stopped speaking.
She lifts her fingers and gently places their tips on the medallion that hangs heavy on a chain around her neck against the skin of her bare chest underneath her nightgown.
I tell myself this is what I should have been expecting but.....then again.....I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting to begin with.
And so he silently puts on his shoes and sneaks down the stairs and out of the house to sit down on his own front porch and stare up at the stars and the night sky.
The next thing Finn remembers is the sun setting low behind the horizon. The sky around them is a heavy shade of golden-red. Mycroft has put the journal away and is rolling the muscles of his shoulders in an attempt to get the tension built up by a day of reading out of them.
The baritone of his voice seemed significantly deeper in the dark of John's bedroom and he silently wished he'd left at least a small light on. The curt greeting seemed to settle in his stomach along with the beer and made him feel queasy for a second. John swallowed.
The sound of the engine, the crackle of the on-board radio used to communicate with the hospital and then there is the frantic beeping of a machine that registers if Sherlock's heart is still beating or not.
I look at him and his face is so full of honesty and he's waiting for an answer that I am not able to give and so I just shrug.
Holmes just gives him a sort of half shrug as a servant walks up to them, bows and takes the horses from them.
“So what is it you wanted to talk to me about, Ru.......” He abruptly stops talking, purses his lips together in a thin line and averts his eyes once again.
“Sherlock”, he had said as he thrust carefully – oh so carefully- inside, into his very core, “I love you”.
Holmes audibly groans. Finn shakes his head at him as he gives him a fond look before he turns back to John.
“It'll be better than just plunging yourself into the lands beyond the Veil in the hopes of finding something.”
They sat by the fire in companionable silence for a while. Sherlock warming his hands and Finn seemingly lost in thought. If you didn't look at him too closely the Dark Elf could almost pass as human. Only when you paid attention to the details did you notice that there was something not quite right. His complexion a strange shade between light brown and olive-green, closely resembling that of the people that lived far to the south, but if you looked really closely not quite the same. His short dark hair, neatly slicked back at the moment, seemed to be black, but the closer you got the more you noticed it was made out of darkness itself and looking at it too long would make you feel as if you'd gone temporarily blind. Now, well past the midnight hour, with Finn's magical fire as their only source of light it was hard to make out where the night ended and Finn began. Sometimes Sherlock wasn't sure if there even was a clear distinction. And then there were his eyes. To the casual onlooker they seemed to be an almost golden shade of brown, but on occasion flecks of red light could be seen swimming through his irises. Like liquid fire or barely contained magic. Even now, with black night all around them and the fire between them Sherlock could see it as Finn looked at him and spoke once again:
And Sherlock. His thoughts were on Sherlock once again. How the blue of his eyes reminded him of the water and sky of the highlands. How his curls framed his face as the wind jostled them just so. How the baritone rumble of his voice had seemed to hum in harmony with the beating of his own pulse. How the smell of him had mingled oh so sweetly with the fresh scent of wildflowers all around them...
Spare himself the grief that is to come when John finds out more and more about him and decides his girlfriend is the far better option....
Sherlock stares out of the window at the passenger side as he tries to predict in which pattern the raindrops that hit it will fall while the radio plays in the background.
They sit together on a blanket John has spread out for them. Their backs against an empty stall. Their hands wrapped around a cup of tea John has made them.
“Oh, yeah?” John seems genuinely interested and it makes Sherlock feel warm all over. Once again he feels like comparing John to the sun as he basks in the warm glow of his undivided attention.
'I would have thought you'd had your fair share of early mornings when you were in the army.' Holmes said, lifting one of his eyebrows, his hair slowly getting damp as morning dew stuck to his curls. The whole image reminded John of his horrid dream even more and he shivered once again.
My fingers feel heavy and unresponsive and my breaths come in short labored gasps. I rub at my eyes to try and chase away the black spots that have suddenly appeared at the edges of my vision and take one long, shuddery inhale...........and then I read:
John's eyes shoot open instantly and he feels he's wide awake as memories from last night's dream come flooding back.
'Then don't go with them. Run away with me. We'll hide. We'll live together as exiles. I ran away too. We both have nowhere to go back to now. We could.....'
Long brown hair tied together in a simple pony tail, eyes that are just a bit too small, a knitted sweater with a colorful pattern, her knuckles too white as she grasps onto the strap of her backpack just a little bit too tightly.
There is a small hint of a smile dawning at the corners of his mouth then. Molly can't help but answer it with a soft smile of her own.
I look over at his table and while the rest of his friends are talking loudly amongst each other he's looking at me. He gives me his most radiant smile. The one with the dimple and I just need to look away again.
“It's fine”, he says, “If anything I'm relieved. I was starting to think you actually didn't like me but it just turns out you have a boyfriend. I should have known. Of course someone as pretty as you was already taken.”
Behind them somebody laughs. The sound a strange and stark contrast against the cold and oppressive atmosphere that hangs over their table.
With the knowledge he has now....about magic...the magpie.....the moon-goddess.....he might be able to ascertain some clues amongst Holmes' possessions that are hidden from others.
“He's a freak and he's had a crush on you for ages. It's disgusting. You're lucky he hasn't violated you yet....or has he? Has he touched you inappropriately in the library? You don't have to tell me John. I'm just a friend. Looking out for you. See!”, here Sebastian waves the test answers around, “What has he ever done for you? He's just a weird guy with no friends. He doesn't even attend classes. He just hangs around with you hoping he'll get inside your pants.”
“What are you doing here?”, John asks, smile still on his lips, as if he is actually happy to see me.
The present stands between John and Sherlock on the breakfast table. The late morning sun filters in through the windows. Outside it is still raining.
But he finds that all he can think about now is Watson in his new blue suit. The one made out of expensive fabric. Tight and form fitting. Like a second skin. The colour making the blue of his eyes shine like the sky on a warm summer's day.
Sherlock sighed. That particular spell never seemed to work for him. He had no idea how Finn did it.
After that day he had fervently hoped it had been the first and last time he had had to deal with them.
By now the cold had made a home out of his bones. So, in the end, Sherlock just gave up on getting any work done that day as he folded up his map and went to look for a maid to light the fire in his room.
Sherlock's lips are swollen, spit slicked. His breath comes out in short and shallow pants. And his eyes.....there's nothing but pupil. Large pools of black that John finds himself drowning in. There are secrets in Sherlock's eyes. And answers. Answers he will find nowhere else. He's desperate for them.
John decides to just not reply if Holmes is going to state the obvious. And so he remains silent while Holmes avoids his gaze.
“I'm sorry”, he says again. The words no more than a whisper more felt than heard as they ghost over my lips like a warm breeze.
It's too dark to see if John's blushing or not but as his sentence peters out he keeps his head down and avoids looking at Sherlock.
“It's good to see you again”, John says. And he looks and sounds as if he means it and I'm as confused as I've ever been.
As quickly as he can John makes a frantic grab underneath the sofa but then....out of the corner of his eyes.....he sees it.
“I think I'm ready to tell my parents about us”, John suddenly says and Sherlock feels absolutely freezing once more.
Sherlock finds himself drifting off to sleep but in the end it is the sound of John's voice that drags him back from the borders of blissful unconsciousness.
And even though they physically hadn't done a whole lot more than sitting, John felt absolutely exhausted. And as he looked to his side he saw that Sherlock hadn't exactly gotten through the afternoon entirely unscathed either.
Any other time it would have made Molly smile too but right now she feels frozen in place. The smile sliding from her lips just as easily as it had come.
He starts running a bit faster as he follows after him. Making his way through the crowd none too gently.
The warm liquid soothes and warms his throat and seems to chase away some of the cold that had settled in his bones and deep in his chest overnight.
Sherlock closes his eyes and this time it only takes him a couple of seconds before he finds himself in the familiar green wallpapered halls with their truly ostentatious pattern.
His answer is too fast. The explanation too easy. I know I should pressure him more, ask him more but his hands are on the back of my neck now and he's pulling me back against him and suddenly we're kissing again and his tongue slides against the seam of my mouth and I open for him willingly and now
Finally John reaches his assigned seat. He's on the aisle seat of a set of two seats at the back of the plane. The other seat, next to the window, is already taken. It's occupant is currently sitting wrapped up in a blanket, slouched against the plane's small window.
“I'm not sure yet”, Mycroft says, “maybe......there's something here....in my father's journal.....I think I've found the last place he went to before he went missing. It's marked rather.....oddly.”
I gingerly slide my textbook out of my bag and from the corners of his eyes I can see Phillip look at me but his eyes shoot back to the front of the class as soon as I turn towards him.
He quickly searches his mind-palace but everything seems to be in order still and he lets out a sigh of relief. His anger dissipating with it.
How many unfortunate omega's would have turned to these seemingly innocuous flowers in the hopes of terminating an unwanted pregnancy safely?
Mycroft seems to visibly relax next to him. His hands not gripping the wheel quite as tightly anymore.
The last shop at the corner of the street sells car parts. I don't know anything about cars but it does somehow remind me of Molly's brother and suddenly I'm all nerves again.
'I'm not really one for gossip', John said. He felt it would be best to avoid talking about Master Holmes for now. Mary knew him better than anyone here and she might catch on that he knew a little bit more about the events of last night. And as soon as Mary knew...everybody knew. It was a well known fact she could not keep a secret to save her life.
Maybe one of them would have finally said something had Sebastian not come along, but, honestly, John wasn't even sure what that “something” was.
His searching lips just as needy and brutal as his thrusting hips, driving his hard cock deep into Sherlock's body down below.
She has decided to spend the entire carriage ride giving out instructions for their upcoming visit to him and her daughters as well.
Finn sighed and tried to quell the fire just a small bit more. Some of the embers fizzled and died and he cursed as he raised his hands once more and the warmth of a newly kindled fire hit his skin.
Maybe it's like when you wake up from a very nice dream and you try to remember what it was about and how it made you feel for as long as you can but with every second you spend awake you can feel it slipping away further and further from your conscious mind until all you can remember is that it was just....nice.....and nothing more.
He is still no closer to the identity of “Person X” and, if he's completely honest with himself, he kind of forgot about “Person X” altogether when he was together with John this afternoon.
Sherlock smiles to himself. He has to admit, it's not one of his best but he is feeling a bit distracted at the moment.
And so he had fought and alienated anyone who so much as tried to feel sorry for him until his mother finally saw sense and made him switch schools.
Death smiles at her some more. Its teeth are sharp. The unforgiving rain makes it seems as if a shark is watching her from beyond the glass.
Anger is good, it's nice and warm but it's also dangerous. You hurt people with anger. I see his face fall with my continued denial of him and his apologies. A sudden and unexpected pain shoots through my chest. Being angry can be like playing with fire. If you're not careful you might hurt yourself in the process too.
And sure enough, she emerges like a ghost from the shadows. Her white nightdress and blond hair only adding to the effect.
Outside of the car the sun sets and the moon rises. The light of the moon sunlight reflecting off of its surface.
She never told them more than was strictly necessary. There were never any descriptions of herself, never any descriptions of these places she found herself in, the people she met, an indication of how she felt.....just “I am well.”
John doesn't know a Greg. Thank God. He doesn't think he would be able to handle this if he found out that he and Sherlock have mutual friends.
The only company his stepmother and her daughters and a throng of supposedly “important” people he could not care less about even if he tried.
When he looks down at his palms there are crescent-shaped indentations leftover from where his nails have temporarily dug into his skin.
I shake my head and look down at my hands. They shake as I hold on to my phone. The screen is dark and when I open the messaging-app John hasn't replied and my message remains unread.
He wished he had had more time to actually talk to Sherlock. He wished he hadn't left so quickly at the end of his heat.
And if those are not some of the best lines of poetry you've ever read then I don't know what to tell you....
John was about to say something, but she continued of her own accord keeping her face fixed on her tea, not meeting his eyes.
Now that Holmes was somewhat clean and not in any mortal danger John pondered what to do with him. Without help from Holmes himself he would never be able to bring his lordship all the way to his own chambers in the mansion. And what if someone saw him in this state? There were enough rumors surrounding Holmes as it was already.
Sherlock was putting up a facade it seemed. Meticulously hiding this softer side from the world. If he really was gay John could understand why.
It gave him something to do every time he finished his classwork long before everyone else. John had never once shown any sort of interest in the arts.
A broken soldier who had been living as an actual drifter before he was able to get this current job at Holmes Manor.
His dark curls slightly mussed where his head rests on the pristine pillow underneath. The warm early sun makes the strands appear like dark spun silk whenever it hits it.
John's wearing a loose hoody with the hood up so all I can see is the tip of his nose and part of his fringe sticking out at odd angles.
Holmes is already moving again but John needs a couple of steadying breaths before he is able to move again himself and only when he joins Holmes where he is crouched beside the remains of the creature does he realize that the creature's head is no longer attached to its body.
The bear shook him left and right with a strength matching its size, making him slide across the ground and John had to clamp both his legs tightly against the sides of the body of the beast so as not to get thrown of.
No doubt the aunt will be interested in marrying her young ward off so she will not be able to resist traveling as soon as possible to meet this prospective husband in person to make sure he is indeed a good  match.
She finds that knowing the fate of another while they themselves are still blissfully unaware is an incredibly heavy cross to bear.
I had just chosen not to see it, not to comment on it. Stash it all away for later because I didn't want to hurt him.....or maybe myself.......maybe I had just been selfish all along and maybe John was now paying the price for it.
“We have the theory...”, he starts only to be interrupted by Finn coughing politely, “I'm sorry”, he continues, “
It tastes like home-made lemonade and roasting marshmallows, like paint drying on naked skin left there by warm fingers, like fingertips making their way from his shoulder to his hip igniting the flesh underneath them, like an endless sky of stars, like an endless blue sky without clouds, like big drops of rain that fall from between a canopy of green leaves, like letters carved into a tree, like the sun and the moon coming together, like waiting and then releasing all at once, like......like......everything.
She tends to talk a lot during lunch-break and usually I just pretend to listen to her but today I decide to make an actual effort.
He was sure that what he had seen had been real and then he had been sure Holmes had either seen it too or had known it was there at least, but however hard he tried he could not come up with a reasonable explanation for these strange images. Even thinking on them now there was something about them that gave him chills.
“Nighthawk told me you'd be coming today”, she says, “there is a servant on his way to take care of your horses and then you can come in. Tea's ready!”
He has embarrassed himself so utterly and completely it is better to give up all pursuits of John. They are too different. It will never be. John has his girlfriend and seeing them together, so happily in love, will only bring Sherlock pain, heartbreak and misery.
John looked around. Unsure whether they had actually reached their destination or if Holmes was just messing with him now.
He wouldn't do that though. John liked her. They seemed to spend a lot of time together. Sherlock supposed a friendship had formed between them and maybe.....more?
“Just one 'no' would have sufficed”, he says and just like that he's gone. Back to the dance-floor. Only, further back this time, just far enough so John has lost his clear line of sight.
A long moment of silence passed. Made all the heavier by the absence of the sound of insects and birds that were usually present at the meadow.
When they reach the coffee-place, it's only a five minute walk from the school, John walks ahead and holds the door open for him.
They had stood side by side in John's backyard. Their shoulders touching. As John carefully unscrewed the lid from the jar.
Maybe he should go to Molly Hooper first......but.....then again......he's never shied away from a challenge and......if he's being honest with himself, angry or not, he would very much like to see John Watson again.
It is then that she decides to give John a conspiratorial wink and he really is at a loss for words then.
He felt utterly satiated. He felt happy. He couldn't even remember the last time he'd felt happy. If he ever had.
“I spent the night in a hotel”, John says. It's not a lie but it's also not the entire truth, “I just had to get away for the night.”
He was just getting used to it; the thrill of adventure, the unexpected, not knowing what the day would bring when you woke up in the morning.
They can't postpone the inevitable any longer. Sherlock needs to get through security soon or risk missing his flight.
He dared not think of what he would do if he came to their meadow and found it deserted except for the twittering of birds and the rushing of a gentle breeze.
Misshapen creatures with tough leather-like skin, gaping mouths with stony teeth, hairless and disproportionate limbs.
Behind them the door to the house opens and closes again. There are footsteps on the gravel and before Sherlock realizes what is happening John is moving away from him again.
'Is it your leg?', she asked. The look she bore on her face shifting into something that looked an a lot like concern.
At first John had felt relieved, then anxious, nervous and pretty soon, as the hours passed him by, all those emotions melted together and turned into anger.
'This is not a joke!', once again the glasses on the table rattled as his stepmother now slammed both hands on the table, 'you listen to me Sherlock Holmes. We have become the laughing stock of the entire community. All because of you. Your father built up a respectable reputation during his lifetime and now that he's gone you just seem intent on tearing it all down.'
He wants to answer but, with John not here, he has no idea how. He doesn't know how to put into words how things have changed between him and John. What he feels exactly when John is close to him and how earth-shatteringly different that feeling is when John is away.
They sit close together. Their shoulders and legs touching. It is as if they need this physical contact to prove to themselves that, yes, everything that has just happened is real.
Each grain of sand that falls in the hourglass heavier than the last until enough have gathered to crack and shatter and drown.
Holmes just gives him another dazzling smile. His hair is windswept and one errant curl hangs obstinately down across his forehead.
It's large. About the size of a fist and the skin is twisted and uneven where scar-tissue has attempted to close the gaping wound as well as it could.
“I wouldn't dream of doing magic this side of the veil”, Holmes' voice is low and dark and his breath tickles the shell of John's ear, “it's strictly forbidden.”
It could have been worse. At least he didn't have to wait on the guests inside the house. Serve them food an drinks. Mary had been looking forward to it, but he shuddered at the thought.
He remained silent for so long that John was starting to wonder if perhaps he had lost the connection, but just as he was about to take the phone away from his ear and check the screen Sherlock spoke again:
John sighed, closed the door and snuck back upstairs. Carefully avoiding the creaky floorboard in the hallway so as not to wake up his mother.
Where there was a cold chill before there is now a trail of warm liquid light that fills him up from the inside out. John cannot help but smile himself as he casts his eyes down to his forgotten cup where he has placed it on the floor.
'I said no', a moment of silence and then Finn continued in a softer tone, 'but he might need you when I get back.'
And then there even was that one message from last Wednesday-night where he texted me at 3 am just to say:
Sherlock releases all of his magic on the dark man. He just brushes it aside as if it was an insect bothering him on a hot summer's day.
John coughs. Obviously he feels the tension that has suddenly fallen over the conversation and wants to do something about it. That's just how John is. Ever caring about others. Sherlock loves him for it.
Knowing Watson he will most likely feel extremely embarrassed about this whole situation. He might even refuse to share the bed again.
John actually started giggling again and after a couple of seconds of just staring at him with a very confused look on his face Sherlock joined in.
“Well”, she says, “if, one of these days, you do feel like talking about it you know where to find me.”
So after his father had died John had switched schools and had carefully avoided telling anyone anything about where his father was or what had happened.
The brush of his lips gentle. Barely noticeable. Only the suggestion of a touch. But it is still able to send rapid fire through Sherlock's limbs and he feels himself melting away as he comes undone underneath Watson's strong hands.
The spell put on him that almost made him go beyond the Veil......it's not gone.....it just waits.....it waits for him to walk into its trap.....like a spider waiting for a fly.
He has to grip the door-frame tightly to keep himself from falling over as a sudden sense of vertigo rushes over him.
It had put him in a foul mood and when evening came he found himself alone in the stables having a sparse supper consisting of bread and a bit of cheese.
Maybe someone else had passed by in the meantime as well.....was Sherlock talking to them now? Teaching them the right pronunciation of all the strange flowers that grew in the meadow. He remembered the feeling of Sherlock's arms wrapped loosely around his waist and all of a sudden he felt warm all over. He wasn't sure why.
He had been in love with James. From the moment he had met him really. James had been a soft spoken man. Quick to smile. Always so worried about John. In the beginning John had chalked it up to the age difference between them. James being about 10 years his superior, but now, looking back on it, he wasn't so sure anymore. There had been touches and lingering looks. A lot of time wasted. No point in dwelling on it now. James had gone missing in action just a week before John had been released from the hospital although John didn't find out until much later. He had been forced to leave the army after that. Turns out they had no use for a soldier with a tremor in his sword-hand and an unexplainable limp that came and went at the most inopportune moments. After that John had been roaming the countryside. Looking for the odd job. Unable to go home...
I take a couple of steps towards them and then he spots me and his face lights up again and it just hits me.
I try to glare at him but I don't think I'm very effective. He's making me uncomfortable. Maybe because we're in this small room together and he's talking about us dating or maybe he's making me think about John or maybe because there is a part of me that thinks he might be making sense.....maybe.....
There are words in the kiss. Sentences. Their meaning clear to both of them. No “How and What” guidebook needed.
It was then that, just for a second, his vision temporarily went completely white. As if he had been struck by a flash of lightning.
My phone lies between us on the table and as it suddenly comes to life with a short buzz the table vibrates along with it.
He leaves me stranded on my sink-island and the distance between us seems to be an untraversable sea once more.
About  me and John and what we've had and how I most definitely have not been pining over him this last week.
“Finn told me to stay”, he replies. Trying to hold Holmes' gaze for as long as possible. It isn't easy. The man's irises seem to be made out of ice and John feels himself shiver under their scrutiny.
This last year he had learned that people who barely knew you tended to have a habit to make up all sorts of stories about you if how you looked or acted was a bit out of the ordinary. He'd had his fill of rumors, thank you very much. And he tended not to listen to them. Mike had told him all about Holmes Manor and it's inhabitants though and he did remember the bulk of the story.
He has already dressed himself in one of his new suits. He has slicked his hair back just as he always does when he is about to attend a social gathering of the upper class.
He desperately wanted to know if Holmes was found. If he was alright. But at the same time his dreams of the two previous nights haunted him still. When he closed his eyes he was plagued by visions of a pale eyeless face drenched in blood. Visions he would rather not learn to be true.
Before I realize what they're doing they've unzipped John's hoodie and they slide it away from his shoulders and arms. It gets lost somewhere on the floor around us.
He gestures vaguely to where my clothes are in disarray and my curls dangle in front of my eyes because his demanding fingers could not stop pulling on them.
The supernatural....the other world.....it was almost as if some part of him knew it existed all along. Had always known.....
He doesn't know why he asked it. He probably shouldn't have asked it. But Sherlock does not look alright. He looks like he's coming down with something. As if his skin is not his own and he feels awfully uncomfortable in it.
'But I thought you were one of them too. One of the fey....', John's voice was soft. He had just regained his freedom only to have it result in losing Sherlock in just the span of a couple of hours.
I nod. Because I think I can give him this. I want to give him this. If giving him some time might mean that, eventually, he'll be able to give me more than stolen moments. I will try.
Once again John finds himself running after him. The night air feels cool and fresh as it fills his chest. The moon lights his path in an unusual way. The shape of Holmes a dashing specter as he races off in the distance.
He's going to tell her he doesn't like her and to stay away from him and he's going to call her 'Crazy Molly' and it will all be because of me and no amount of chocolate in the world will be able to cheer her up for quite a while.
And then she will pluck the fragments of bone and strips of flesh that have caught on them off with her fingernails and she will eat them and savor their taste for years and years to come.
There was no “hello?” or a calling out of his name. The visitor just stood there and waited. As if he had all the time in the world. As if what he needed would come to him eventually.
Cautiously reaching out to Holmes' magic every now and then. Testing the waters. Seeing how much of it was safe to use. How to draw upon it effectively. Gently making its way back into the soldier's consciousness.
With a heavy workload ahead of him and the sun having already started its steady ascent through the sky all thoughts of master Holmes and the events of the previous night were soon driven to a small corner at the back of Johns mind. Destined to remain there until well into the afternoon when he stopped by the kitchen for a quick bite to eat.
Wallace chose to completely misinterpret the sudden tremble that ran through the muscles underneath his too damp fingertips and decided to add his tongue to the already mortifying experience.
From that point on the evening passes faster than John had thought it would and before he realizes what's going on Holmes is suddenly pulling him along by the sleeve of his jacket towards the table where Miss Hooper is now sitting alone.
And as he inhales again he can almost smell the grass of a freshly mowed lawn on a hot summer's day.
My cock gives a valiant twitch as the memories of what happened when I finally got to be with him alone come back to me in bits and pieces.
He wants......he's forgotten what he wants......John is so close......he can't breathe.....he might be having a panic attack.......he can't be having a panic attack......he will ruin their date.......is this even a date?........John said “just coffee”.......there still is no coffee........John's hand is on his shoulder.........why is John's hand on his shoulder?.......John has asked him a question and he hasn't heard it and he doesn't have an answer.
Finally Sherlock smiled again, but his eyes were cast down and the laughter lines that had made him look so young and carefree before were nowhere to be seen this time around.
He didn't think it was possible but the kiss deepens as John now crushes his lips against his mouth. It almost hurts. Sherlock kind of wants it to hurt. Pain is just another feeling and with John he wants to feel everything.
Maybe if he knew something more about Sherlock....maybe he wouldn't feel so cheap and dirty about the whole ordeal then.....maybe he wouldn't feel......whatever it is he's been starting to feel lately.
They spent two more days like that. When John woke up on the third day he instantly knew something had changed.
And, although none of it will even come close to the truth, it will be nice to hear something about the man anyway.
John knows exactly how to behave himself. How to talk to other people and Sherlock.....he just flounders along and on occasion he says something that's not entirely inappropriate....or so he hopes.
Sherlock closes his eyes now. The sunlight filtering through the branches of the tree feels warm on his face. It's still early afternoon. It'll be a while yet before he has to leave.
Caught off guard by the direction their conversation had suddenly taken John gave her a puzzled look.
“You don't have to worry”, he hears himself saying, “I might be an addict but I'm not an idiot. I know where I get my supplies and I get tested regularly. I never gave you any....diseases.”
The gentle wisp of a raven-dark curl setting his own flesh ablaze as they reached for each other in the midnight hour.
And with my presence where it doesn't belong I'm inadvertently trying to mix these two sides of him together while, maybe, they are irrevocably unable to combine.
Some story lines need to be wrapped up. John's father in particular, Sherlock's true identity and then there's something about a baby.....
'Not really', he managed to produce a smile as she looked up at him. Her eyes big and sorrowful. 'It'll get better if I give it some rest. Shouldn't you be at the ball?'
The look Holmes gave him closely resembled a thunderstorm with his eyes shining bright as two harsh flashes of lighting.
He stares up at the ceiling as parts of memories of the dream he had just before waking up drift back to him.
Once again he just decides to not comment on it. Mostly because John seems to still be a bit nervous and his hands shake ever so slightly as he drinks his coffee.
The fairy-queen screamed. Enraged. The sound of her voice so piercing it felt like hot needles making their way inside his ears where it reached them. John almost let go to cover his ears with his hands in an attempt to drown out the almost unbearable stinging pain. But still he held on.
He would do his best to figure out what was going on. Who exactly had it in for Holmes. Keep him safe.
“My dad's not home today”, he says, “he left on another long trip for work. I'll be fine. My mother must be worried sick. I need to see if she is alright.”
It's not a complete lie. I do have plans. I assume I have plans. If only John would text me. I try looking at John one final time. Send him a telepathic message to follow through on his promise and end my week long suffering but, once again, Andrew is in the way.
His memories of his encounter with what had apparently been the goddess herself when he had been dying and bleeding out are still hazy at best but he is pretty sure he had promised her something.
And Watson had surprised him once again. Instead of thanking Sherlock for his help in the matter he had gotten mad. Now reminding Sherlock of a storm brewing over sea. The strength of Watson's character at war with the current weakness of his body. And Sherlock had been at a total loss of what to do and so he had left. He had fled to the mist as he always did when he was at a loss. The mist helped him forget. Usually. This time around however he had found it impossible to dispel the thought of Watson from his mind completely and so, the mist unable to soothe his mind, he had returned back home much sooner than was his wont. Determined to make an ally out of Watson this time around.
“It's not your fault”, John says. His eyes fixed on the road in front of him. Sherlock is not sure if he actually wants John to look at him right now. His mood so dark. He's afraid his eyes will shoot actual lightning when he does and they will end up hurting Sherlock in the process.
“That is probably one of the weirdest things I've ever done”, John said. No longer able to suppress his giggles.
The smile on his companions face widens. John finds his hands shake slightly as he plays a card of his own. He stubbornly convinces himself it's because of the busy day they've had.
So he had been sure sleep would descend upon him quickly when he crawled into his bed shortly after.
'Now you listen here', his father spat out, 'we have been over this countless times, but it just does not seem to sink into that soft, stupid omega brain of yours. Bonding is the
Just for a moment he feels as if there is something he needs to tell Holmes. Something important. But he cannot seem to remember what it was and just as quickly as it has come the feeling passes.
much. But, once again, he finds John is just like the sun. Being this close to him and his radiance seems to blind him. Makes him forget what he wants to say and seems to burn him up from the inside out.
A puzzled frown forms on his face at the sight of them and then he sees John and the frown turns into an actual scowl.
“Mr. Watson”, Holmes' loud baritone can almost be felt as he speaks to Mary loud and clear, “will come to Mrs. Hudson when he is done assisting me. You can tell her that. And you, Miss Morstan, should go back to your own chores. It is what I pay you for after all.....isn't it.”
Now that Sherlock actually sees Watson he is surprisingly less nervous about their upcoming encounter.
He doesn't remember soft lips curving up into a smile before they kiss his, he doesn't remember hands roaming underneath the blankets until they find his own, he certainly doesn't remember the blankets getting hopelessly tangled as two pairs of legs wrap around each other, a soft giggle escaping his lips only to be captured by the lips of another.....he doesn't remember any of that....surely not......and even if he did....which he doesn't......he chooses not to.
I watch the lights of the city as they stream past in a starry blur, people milling about on the sidewalk, the evening traffic, and I wonder what I'm even planning to do with John when I get him back to my house.
John says something to her and her smile gets even bigger. She quickly hides it by slapping one of her hands over her mouth.
John smiles a nervous smile and he can't seem to be able to keep his hands still as he continuously folds and unfolds the same page of his book.
But there is sound. She can hear people laughing and talking and there is music in the air as they move closer to the mansion.
“And I need to be with them when they get there. I know you plan to go back to the Order. Take me with you. There is nothing left for me here”
Handcuffs and all. Greg never does anything if he can't do it properly. Sherlock respects that about him.
Even though he had only known Sherlock for a couple of weeks he felt a friendship had formed between them. A friendship that, in all honesty, he was very loath to lose.
Sherlock is in the passenger's seat of John's car. John is driving but his lips are pressed together in an unnatural line on his face, his jaw is tense and his hands grip the wheel just a little bit too tight.
He shouldn't look. He probably should wait until he is no longer floating, sinking, drowning, he should wait, he should, he should look, and so he looks
“I've changed ever since I met you”, sherlock clarifies, “In all the right ways.....you've made me....more.”
I say nothing. He isn't worth my time. None of these guys are. I try brushing past him but he stops me.
He just wants.....he wants to.......his thoughts are a jumbled mess......he looks into Watson's eyes but that only makes him lose his train of thought even more.
“Oh”, John's reply as the grip he had on Sherlock loosened slightly. Sherlock missed it already. “I could have taken you home safely too.”
I don't even know if.....whatever it was we had.....meant the same to him as it had meant to me. If he even still thinks of me sometimes......
Sherlock glimpsed down briefly at the piece of paper on the table, still partially covered by Johns hand but the passing grade was clearly visible, and just raised a haughty eyebrow as he looked at John.
“I'd love to read it sometime”, John continues talking, “maybe we'll do that one for the school play next year.”
Sadly though they did not have 10 more minutes. Turned out they didn't even have 10 minutes to begin with, because as they left the confines of the tool shed they had used to spend time together, John still sporting an awkward erection, he heard a familiar, shrill voice and immediately froze.
The sky above is still far too vast and menacing but for the moment the gentle pressure of John's skin seems to be keeping Sherlock anchored to the ground at least.
The moon had drifted from behind the clouds and its light cast a soft and otherworldly glow on his face. Making his eyes glimmer like stars and his already sharp features stand out in an absolutely mesmerizing way.
“I just don't know how to talk to you”, he says. Another truth. John seems to be able to wring the truth right out of him. He really hopes John will stop looking at him like that soon before he gets a little bit more of the truth than he bargained for. Sherlock is pretty sure he'll never be able to come back here after John finds out about......
Just a small boy holding his big brother's hand as the heels of his new shoes made far too much noise as they hit the marble stones lining the great hallway.
He picks up the next one, blows a heavy layer of dust from its cover and starts reading again. This time it takes him at least two chapters to come to the conclusion that the, fairly long winded, author has no clue what they are talking about.
At first John isn't sure what's happening. It all seems to go so fast. But then Holmes suddenly goes down to his knees and the medallion rolls away from his limp fingers only to come to a halt somewhere underneath the sofa.
Gently he cups my face with his left hand. As if I am fragile and might break. As if I am something precious and worthwhile.
Sherlock types out. His hands are positively sweaty now. He's not sure what he wants John to answer....if he even wants John to answer at all.
The beer tastes like piss, the service is slow, half of the lights on the ceiling don't work and neither does the air-conditioning.
'S..s..since I already know half of your name.....I....I don't think it would be entirely fair to take the entire rose.'
Holmes has brought a small bag with a change of clothes and a couple other things they might need on the road. They stow it in the back of the carriage together with a bag John had prepared a bit earlier for himself.
Once again the threads burn in Morgana's hands. It feels like fire searing her flesh. She clenches her fists tighter. Smoke starts to rise from between her fingers and her eyes seem to be ablaze from the inside out. It is as if there's glass in her throat as the magic from outside the veil courses through the tendrils of her magic and makes its way inside of her body.
John wonders if he has gone too far but if he has he doesn't care. He is done with treading lightly. With just living his life. Just existing. He wants to be part of this adventure entirely or not at all.
“Joooooooohn!” Mary drawled. She was getting impatient. Surely if Sherlock kept ignoring him he would go with his girlfriend and Sherlock would not have to live through the mortifying experience of throwing up in front of John.
As the other people in the stands around him would yell and sing, stomp their feet and clap their hands, Sherlock would just sit there.....and marvel at the radiant power of John Watson.
There's a note stuck to the stem of the flower. Sherlock takes it between his fingers but before he can open it  and read what it says John stops him.
, John thought, but the slow rise and fall of his chest and the raspy sound of his breathing told him Master Holmes was indeed still alive.
He was about to call out for Sherlock again when suddenly two hands encircled him from behind and grabbed him loosely around his waist.
The smile has gone from  Andrew's face now. He just looks concerned. At the moment he reminds me a little bit too much of Molly and her sad smiles and I don't think I can handle any more sadness directed towards me today.
The grip of John's hands tightens where they find themselves against Sherlock's back. Sherlock moans too now. And for a moment he wonders if John can taste the sounds they make too....and what it tastes like to him....and then he's not thinking much of anything anymore as he loses himself in the moment. In John. In perfection.
Or maybe she had wanted to be the one to find him. Maybe she felt as if John had robbed her of this last intimate moment with her husband. John didn't know and where he had tried to talk to his sister about this he hadn't dared to try and talk to his mother.
But of course it hadn't been. That was just the way the world worked. Boys liked girls and  those who didn't.....they were the strange outliers......not the other way around.
For some reason John was reminded of his sister. Who, after finally realizing she was a lesbian, had come out to their mother only to have their mother send her to a strict boarding school at the other side of the country. On the very rare occasions where his sister was allowed to visit home she always seemed a bit unsure, guard and walls firmly up. Hiding away her true feelings and true personality. Only when she was completely at ease, usually when she and John were alone together she would let her guard down again and to John it always felt like the sun breaking through the clouds. She reminded him of Sherlock so much.
He finds himself unable to focus on any task for more than a couple of minutes and it makes him high-strung, irritable and easy to snap at people.
Sherlock chooses to ignore the spelling mistake John has made. He probably wrote it in a hurry, he figures. Somehow it totally suits John. Innocent, honest and to the point. Sherlock can't help but smile.
At the moment John is doing something on his phone and he's got some sort of dreamy smile on his face while he does it and he completely missed something one of his friends is saying to him because of it.
“Our visions never lie”, the voice seems to be coming from all around him this time as it whirls around the walls of the pyramid while it makes its way to the top, “it has been activated by The One.”
It was the kind of thing kids would bully you for. But not John. John had always been an exception to the norm.
Once Molly's aunt receives the letter he expects her to leave within a day. Once he's sure she has left Molly Hooper behind he will send for Holmes and Watson to join him here.
Maybe there is something in there....something that will lead him to, if not the whereabouts of Holmes, at least to Finn....or....something.....something connected to magic.....and excitement....adventure......something that will not make him feel as if he is slowly dying anymore.
He does his best to not think about how he had woken up with Holmes in his arms yet again that morning.
“I'll be the judge of that”, Sherlock says and before John realizes what's going on Sherlock starts swaying his hips to the beat of the song that is currently playing.
Mary is the only one who has tried to talk to him on a couple of occasions over the past few days, she has even brought him tea and biscuits when he found himself sulking alone in the stables.
“I don't know”, Sherlock replies, as truthfully as he can, “it's new.....and unfamiliar....please don't make me name it yet....I can't name it yet.”
At this point I am pretty sure he is going to send us away and the sense of relief that that thought gives me makes me feel slightly guilty as well.
He's 22 pages in and he realizes he still has no idea what the book is about. He sighs and puts it down again. But that only brings him back to the reality of the room and Holmes and their situation and the fact that Holmes does
“No way”, for a moment I think Andrew knows. That he has, somehow, recognized John just by the hair on his knees or the curve of his legs but all he says is: “you're dating a rugby-guy!?”
Somehow Wallace's right hand had made its way from the armrest of the chair to John's left knee. It was now making its way slowly upwards. Cold fingers were playing with the hem of his kilt as a thumb slowly stroked the skin of his thigh. To John it felt as if a frog was trying to make its way underneath his kilt and he shivered as a result.
She gestured excitedly towards the hallway beyond the open door. John followed her inside. His earlier hesitation temporarily driven away by Mrs. Hudsons cheery nature. Good old Mike. It seemed he had taken every precaution to make sure John was well received here.
Sherlock had smiled a sad smile that John never ever wanted to see on his lovers face ever again for as long as they both lived.
For a moment Sherlock wracks his brain for the memory of where he was a couple of nights ago. With the current spell that had been put on him his memories of the recent past are hazy at best. And then he does remember.
“Why would I ever do that?” John says, “I haven't seen Mary in months and I.....you......surely you've caught on.....”
The painted heart is now completely covered again. Just an insignificant patch of white rapidly drying in the sun.
John doesn't know what to say and so he just doesn't say anything at all. Mrs. Hudson is a clever woman. She usually always knows everything that goes on in the household. He is just not sure how much she knows about his.....'friendship'..... with Holmes.
'We were expecting you today', Mrs. Hudson continued, 'Mister Stamford wrote a very long letter of recommendation introducing you. We're all very glad you're here. Come in, come in!'
“You know”, he says, “adventure and becoming a doctor are not mutually exclusive. You just need to find a different angle.”
Every new question he had asked about their destination, Holmes or his current situation had been met with a silence, a haughty blank stare or an evasive answer at best.
Although he could not hear it, John was pretty sure Sherlock chuckled then because he could feel the vibration of it all along the side of him that was pressed against his friend.
The man laughed again and for a second John thought he felt the soft touch of fingers on his hand, but before he could register it the man was moving away from him again and, to Johns relief, headed for the stable doors.
Up to this point he had almost forgotten about the throng of lords and ladies surrounding them. All of his attention having been focused on Miss Hooper......and Holmes.
I reach into my pocket for my phone and I manage to send him a quick text before lunch break is over:
But when I turn around I look into John's fiery eyes and every sense of clarity I thought I had been able to gather melts away like ice in the sun at the sight of them.
And so he devotes the rest of his time to placing all these new and wonderful memories and sensations he has recently acquired into his mind-palace while they are still fresh in his memory so he will not lose a single detail of what he holds so dear.
Sure there were no stairs here, but the last time he had carried Holmes in a similar fashion there most decidedly had been. He had carried Holmes up the stairs to his small bedroom that night. At the time he had assumed his master had been unconscious for all of it. Now he wondered how much of it he actually remembered.
The person on the other end is practically screaming into Sherlock's ear. He doesn't recognize the voice. There's a lot of noise and shouting going on the background. He's not quite sure what it's all about but it's clear that, even if John's there, he's called at an inopportune moment and they won't get any talking done anyway.
Here Mycroft had actually laughed taking another 10 years off of him and the room had seemed brighter once again. He had stuck out his hand and ruffled Sherlock's hair where he had thrown himself over the desk.
This probably meant Johns mother and sister were leaving for a bit and John would call them if he needed anything. Perfect.
My mother leaves the tray with two steaming mugs and a couple of biscuits on my desk and then leaves.
Finally Sherlock has reached a gateway that will lead him beyond the veil. He has secretly snuck out of the room he had shared with Watson in the early hours of the morning.
There had been no air, no sound, no up and no down. Only icy water. Making his movements cumbersome and his mind hazy.
Sherlock gets up from the table. He's not in the mood for any of this now. He's got enough worries as it is.
Right now he gets to his feet as well and places himself behind Watson, bends himself forward and places a soft kiss on his neck.
Dark magic oozes from his fingertips towards the soldier. Ready to corrupt and kill. To turn once living flesh into rot and decay in the blink of an eye.
There is a slight breeze today and every so often an errant curl gets caught up in it and is swept across his face. Sherlock bats it away absentmindedly as he seems to be talking agitatedly to a short, thin man in a white hazard-suit.
Something that feels greater than himself....greater than Holmes....greater than the both of them. Somehow it feels right. As if he was always meant to end up here....with Holmes....chasing birds made out of fog.
The warmth radiating from the body pressed against him seeps into his veins and makes him feel as if he is able to do magic himself.
He just walked up to the table Sherlock found himself at with as confident a gait as he could muster and with his left hand he slammed the cause of his current good mood in the middle of the table.
However soft and slurred he had spoken, it appeared that Sherlock had still been able to hear him over the monotone drone and hiss of the bus because John felt himself drift away to the rumble of a deep and almost affectionate:
He had however been quite confused as to why Holmes seemed shocked, but then in an awed whisper Holmes had said: 'I have never gotten that one to work on this side', then he had blown out the flame and left.
And with that Holmes dragged the man to the open stable doors, threw him outside in the wintry cold and after closing the doors behind him he turned his attention to John. His face suddenly a lot softer than it had been mere seconds ago.
He is starting to feel just a little bit unsure again now that the warm glow of kissing Holmes in the morning light is starting to wear off.
“Mrs. Hudson is in there”, she points towards a door in the back of the kitchen. John knows it leads to a large storage room. It's usually used to store large bags of flour or grain, sometimes Mrs. Hudson uses it to cure meat.
His father said nothing for a good long while and John felt a small hint of excitement upon seeing the barely concealed rage that flickered in his father's eyes as he balled his fist again minutely.
His eyes shooting fire as his lips form a tight line. His nostrils slightly flared....either from exertion or anger......as he is now making his way towards the barstool where John is currently seated.
“It's alright”, Molly says. She blushes and avoids Sherlock's gaze as she stares at the parking lot across from them. She's probably feeling a bit guilty about telling that lie about her sick aunt.
And even if he had spoken to him only once, Bill's voice is hard to forget. It has a pretty distinct sound. Somewhat nasal with a strange accent Sherlock can't quite seem to place.
“Lock”, my mother says, she hasn't called me that in quite a while. She used to call me that all the time when I was younger, before.....I look at her from underneath my fringe.
They also never eat, sleep, see the light of day or do anything besides meditate and weave magical spells that keep them that way and in the process they are granted the most powerful of visions.
When Mrs. Hudson finally finished with the tea she put down a cup in front of John and placed one for herself in front of the chair at the opposite side of the desk.
“As long as I remain clean Detective Lestrade is willing to keep me on as a consultant”, Sherlock says but before he's able to say anything else the detective himself, whom John hadn't even realized was still here, interjects with a short:
Of course I already knew where it was going and how it's going to end, but I've started deviding the events in neat little chapters now. There will be more than 15 chapters though. So stick around!
Once again he finds he's unable to form words but this time for the complete opposite reason. He's never been this happy in his life. Somehow it all feels like a dream to him.....a very good dream....but how can any of this be real.....
Because, once the lights come back on, John's arm leaves my shoulder and I feel cold and alone even-though he is still basically sitting next to me.
And with its dimensions not bound by the laws of this earth it had grown immense over time. The memories in there too many to count. But with the help of magic he kept them all neatly organized in their respective rooms with their doors opening to the green wallpapered walls of the halls surrounding them.
As the weeks passed, trading one day in for another, December slowly rolled around. Bringing with it heavy, icy rainfall and thunderstorms. On one particularly stormy and dreary day the heavy weather lasted well into the night and John had trouble sleeping as strong winds assaulted the barn where his room was. Cold gusts of wind slipping in between the cracks, rattling the woodwork and spooking the horses. Not even his familiar nightmare would come and he started to imagine that he was hearing all kinds of strange noises in the howling wind. Until he actually did.
He wonders how they've spent these last few days......or maybe....maybe he doesn't really want to know.
Sherlock doesn't want this to be over. Not ever. And so he has manged to stay as far away from John's car as he possibly can. Politely declining every time John offered him a ride.
How Greg will just 'happen' to give him a job and how Greg then will just 'happen' to decide to get a coffee at the bar where John just 'happens' to work.
If she looks at it for too long it seeps into her mind and heart as well and it makes her feel empty and hollow.
If only rehab wasn't long, draining, difficult and complicated and didn't leave you not quite the same person you were before and not nearly as 'alright' as you hoped you'd be.
So instead he decides to try and lighten the mood in an attempt to lift the weight of John's confession.
But when John finally lays down in his small bed in his simple room at top of the stairs he finds that sleep comes hard after all.
In that moment John had been prepared for the worst so he had been taken completely off guard when, after what seemed like an age of silence, Holmes finally spoke:
The East Wind is a story their father made up to try and keep them in line ever since they were still young boys.
John was halfway down the castle wall. His hands tightly gripping onto a makeshift rope comprised out of several bedsheets, a tablecloth and his bedroom curtains. Above him the window and its windowsill he had precariously hoisted himself over lost in the black midnight around him. He silently prayed the knot he had used to tie his makeshift rope to the bedpost would hold, that the different pieces of cloth haphazardly tied together would not come apart underneath his weight, that their combined length reached low enough...
He'd go into battle a million times facing almost certain death if he knew it would keep John Watson safe.
John just keeps smiling at him and shakes his head. Again John seems to understand the words he is unable to say.
The handsome, rich and enigmatic gentleman mage does not fall for the failed soldier with an involuntarily limp, a bad shoulder and no specific talent or fortune to speak of.
He made to roll over on his stomach and present as a good omega should, but Sherlock's hand on his shoulder stopped him from doing so.
His toes were cold and numb and he shivered as the day grew darker and darker around him as the hours passed by.
There's a map on the desk. Sherlock cannot make out what is written on the map. There is too much dust on it.
And the last thing he remembered was the feeling of Sherlock's teeth on his neck. Breaking the skin. Sealing the bond-bite and tying them together irrevocably.
Everything around him seemed cold, pale and empty. There were no birds singing. They had all migrated south for the season.
His handwriting is horrible. All swirly loops and crooked letters and his dots are more like small dashes than actual dots.
The face in front of him no longer the familiar one he had gazed at lovingly so many times before as it morphed into something else entirely.
“Just what I thought too.....”, it is as if Holmes wants to say more but he quickly closes his mouth again and glances at John.
John giggled, then coughed, then winced as his throat once again felt as if it housed thousands of tiny creatures with sharp teeth and nails that were trying to claw their way back to freedom.
But, if there is a chance that this is the last time he gets to talk to him, there is one thing he feels he has to say to John.
“Shouldn't we be watching “A Midsummer Night's Dream” instead?” he asks. Which is probably the least flirtatious thing he could have asked but he's starting to panic now.
By now it has become quite clear that something old and evil has awoken. Something that will not be satisfied until all that they know lays in ruin.
He hides himself a little bit deeper in the shadows of the awning and thrusts his hands in his pockets.
As Master Holmes' unblinking gaze seemed to have glued him to the place where he stood he wasn't too sure anymore.
'Are you planning to do something sneaky then?' John asked. Their lips only inches away from each other.
“That's right. A letter”, John sounds positively seductive now. Sherlock likes it, “and in that letter you can write everything you want to do to me....when I get back....in great detail....so I can read it when I'm alone......and think about you.”
He's standing close.....very close.....and John can see where small drops of sweat have formed on his skin and where they have gathered at the bottom of his throat.
Bournemouth was a dream with us the only two people in it and now that we're both awake again that dream-image grows fainter and fainter with every minute that passes until neither of us can remember it anymore.
The evening Sherlock spent in John's room has changed something fundamental in him, but what exactly? John has some figuring out to do.
'I know your home situation is somewhat difficult at the moment', the headmaster had said, 'but school is important. How well you do now has a tremendous impact on your future. I just want you to succeed in life, John.'
At the moment he is scrubbing away at his bare chest. The scar on his left shoulder sings when he splashes it with cold water.
He will spend the rest of the weeks they have left before the performance of “A Midsummer Night's Dream” as if the hypothesis that he is John's secret crush were true.
And he went faster still. John wanted to tell him to wait. That he couldn't keep up. But every time he opened his mouth the mist swooped in with it's ghostly fingers to steal the air from his lungs and all too soon he couldn't run anymore and he felt Holmes' fingers slowly slipping from his wrist as he disappeared ahead of him and John sank to his knees. Behind him he could hear the sound of flapping wings getting closer and closer and ahead of him he could still faintly hear Holmes' voice as he shouted for him to follow:
John actually laughs and the sound is warm and honest. John is not laughing at him, he's laughing with him.
“Hello, John”, the first thing he said when he reached them. Purposefully ignoring Sherlock. The jovial tone of his voice at complete odds with his icy stare that, at the moment, seemed to have frozen John to his seat.
“Listen”, he says, “I think it would be best if we didn't see each other for the foreseeable future.”
He will bring him to Molly Hooper, confirm his suspicions and then hide him away as far from the Order as he possibly can.
“Listen, Sherlock”, John says, “I'm really sorry. Sometimes I talk but don't actually think. I didn't mean to offend you.”
The night is actually quite warm and mild and now that she is no longer being dragged along by a demonic creature Molly closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.
“My friends can be a bit loud and obnoxious sometimes”, John continues, “if you want to sit somewhere else next time we can.”
“Hey, Sherlock”, John's voice is gravely, as if he's tired, and there is a hint of sadness that clings to the edges of his words.
I'm also wearing a tight black shirt with a v-neck and I've spent over half an hour getting my curls just right.
'You keep saying that....' A crooked smile was forming on the Dark Elf's face as the light of the fire was reflected in his golden-red eyes.
he looks down at his feet but it does nothing to hide the bruising and swelling on the left side of his face, his top lip is split and there is still some dried blood on his lower lip and his chin.
Far too soon for his liking the bell rings signaling the end of lunch break, and also his time with John, for today.
And so we shake hands and smile at each other and make promises that are even thinner than our lies and we let them drift away on the summer breeze that graces the beach and float away on the waves of the sea.
How he never once managed to get his wild curls under control and he always looked as if he'd come in from a storm and how proud he had been when my hair had started doing the same.
From the corner of his eye Sherlock can see at least three ladies chomping at the bit for a chance to ask Watson to dance with them.
“I know how hard this must be for you, Sherlock......having to say goodbye to John.....to what you two found together this summer.........I.....”
An inscrutable expression formed on Sherlock's face for just a second, but John caught it. It looked almost....sad.
The beginnings of smile were slowly forming on Holmes lips now as he too recalled that particular memory.
By the age of eighteen Mycroft had already had several job opportunities lined up for him and so he had picked the one that seemed the most profitable. It just so happened to bring them from London to rural Indiana.
As long as she doesn't see it, it's not real. She will choose her own reality. Be the master of her own fate.
Sherlock is even more confused now. John is still not looking at him. Is that what John wants? He had hoped that maybe.....but then again....although.....it had all felt so right.
And that scares him too. It's something he has never experienced before. Something he finds hard to describe. Something.....
Back then young Molly Hooper had just come into her powers and the Order had only just started to take notice of her.
Of course there was a part of him that still felt glad that the master of the house seemed to be back in good health this time but the feeling that he had been discarded once again overshadowed that light gladness he had started his day with completely and had left a dark and heavy cloud behind instead.
Holmes' surprised laugh is once again filled with fireflies and they dance around them in the night-sky like stars.
Later, when he snuck back into his room, John could not remember exactly what they had talked about. It hadn't mattered. The conversation had just been there to stop the silence from letting both of them realize what actually was going on.
There is another warm gush of breath against the side of his neck accompanied by a deep groan and then Watson tenses underneath him as the hand on their joined erections stills.
I've added an actual chapter count recently to let you all know how serious I am about finishing this.
He's pretty sure he can't handle another evening like that. He couldn't even handle the last one. That one had ended up with him throwing up all over John, the side of the road and, almost, the inside of Mycroft's car.
Mycroft's expression remained one of worry. A hint of sadness creeping in at the edges turning the spell a shade of blue. Finn felt like putting his arm around him but decided against it. Such a gesture would most likely not be appreciated at this moment. All he could do was put some more magic of his own into the spell as he turned it bright yellow.
He glances back at the bar briefly but Mike and Greg seem to have left. He doesn't blame them. This pub is without a doubt the worst pub in London.
A couple of houses further down the road there's a music store but all of the windows are covered up with brown paper so I can't really look inside.
Once we enter my room I close the door and sit down on my bed while John examines everything in it as if he's the archaeologist who found Tutankhamun's tomb.
There is a pack of playing-cards on the table. Most of the cards are still face down in a neat pile between the two brothers. Only about a fourth of the cards has been turned over. This second small pile lays discarded to the side.
Holmes' chest can be seen moving up and down rapidly where he is still lying down on the bed in order to regain his breath.
His headache is back and the clouds that had been in his head moments before have become toxic as they've dropped down to his chest and throat where they now suffocate him.
“Look”, Sherlock says, “there's a very simple test to see if I'm right. We get Watson and the medallion together again and just.....see what happens.”
There is a smug smile on Finn's face. Sherlock does his very best to not immediately punch it right off again.
Watson seems to be able to pull the magic out of everything around him and make it do extraordinary things.
Suddenly the stranger turns around again. Perfectly timed to beat and nothing but elegant of course. John almost chokes on his own tongue as suddenly their eyes meet.
“You don't need to ask for permission every time you want to kiss me.......but I do appreciate the sentiment.”
It had become somewhat of a custom for the team to do something fun together on their weekly afternoon off. John would usually join them, but ever since his study sessions with Sherlock had started he'd been forced to stop coming along.
“Your brother is a good man. He's got nothing but your best interest at heart. You should try and remember that sometime.”
It becomes a part of you. It's like your skin. You're not constantly consciously aware of the fact that it's there until something unexpected happens.
I'm all sharp angles where they shouldn't be, I've got my mother's pale complexion combined with my father's dark and messy curls. It makes me look harsh and soft at the same time but in a strange way that seems to fit less and less the more you look at it. I am the worst of both worlds. Sometimes I wonder what other disasters lay hidden within my DNA. Just waiting for time to unearth them and transform me into an even greater mess. But usually I try not to think about it at all.
Of course he had wanted to kiss Watson. Of course he had. Only a fool wouldn't want to do something as perfect as that but....he had hoped to do it on different terms.
And the weapon turns out to be this silly medallion he's had in his family for years. He's pretty sure it was a gift from the Order to his great-great grandfather to begin with.
“Mary had nothing to do with this”, is what he ends up saying. Not really an answer to Mrs. Hudson's question but he has already hurt Mary enough. He feels that, if he is going to lose his job, he doesn't want to take Mary down with him.
John trying his very best to look inconspicuous and failing miserably. He couldn't stick out more even if he tried.
Sherlock didn't even look up from his book when he gave his reply to the question John hadn't exactly asked, but they both knew what he had been aiming at.
'Are you sure you're not coming to the party tomorrow?' he tried again as they were getting ready to leave.
And then he saw the arch of the figures back and he remembered how it had felt underneath his hands as the body it belonged to had bent over him. Peppering kisses on his cheeks and eyelids.
When they both regain their breaths and their strengths somewhat they have a quick wash and dress themselves again.
But there is only so far he can go. At his back is the freshly painted garage wall. The paint drying fast in the hot summer sun, but nowhere near to being completely dry at all.
And....of course I do....because Molly is giving me one of her sadder smiles combined with some very pleading eyes and all I can think of is me telling her her lipstick wasn't fit for school and how happy and 'herself' she had been when we had gone to Patrick's party together and how nobody besides me seems to ever talk to her and calls her 'Crazy Molly' and.....I sheepishly fish  my phone out from underneath the table where it has been hiding on my lap.
If you close your eyes before the sun sets only to open them again once it has completed its journey around the earth and has reclaimed its place in the sky above you......it will be as if it has never left.
At least John assumes it's a “he”. All he can see at the moment of his travel companion for the next two and a half hours is a bit of dark, curly hair.
Greg punches him in the shoulder as Molly squeezes my arm apologetically. I can't look at her. I know she's giving me one of her sadder smiles right now.
At that point in time his memories of Sherlock had been sparse. He had seen him a couple of times but had never really paid too much attention to the boy.
Because to understand this, any of this, any of what he is saying, I need to be absolutely sure that we're on the same page.
They would talk, walk together, sit side by side in the grass. Only, as time wore on, the small distance that always seemed to be there between their bodies slowly started to disappear.
Finally....finally John's confidence seems to falter a little bit as the smallest hint of a blush can be seen and the fingers on Sherlock's back tense up ever so slightly.
'It's been ages since we had a proper ball!' Mary had said to him two days ago when the news had been announced. She had clapped her hands together in excitement like a child. John had just shrugged: 'I don't really see the point in getting excited about a ball you don't even get to attend.'
Holmes has gone over to the area with the tables to find one of the servants walking around with trays of high glasses with expensive and exotic looking beverages. John really hopes there's a lot of alcohol in them.
“I know a sleep-spell when it's being put on me. I wasn't born yesterday....I've taught you too well.”
He gingerly makes his way to one of the empty chairs furthest away from the students who are already sitting there, slides it back from the table and sits down himself.
Carefully they laid him down in bed and John covered him with a sheet. All of a sudden the nakedness of Holmes seemed more than he could bear.
He is however quite surprised to find John still sitting, slightly slouched, in their living-room in his chair by the unlit fire-place. A glass of whiskey dangles from the fingers of his right hand. Most likely not the same glass he started the evening out with.
“I'm sorry”, Watson says, “I can't stay for much longer......I wish I could......it's already mid-morning and I have a lot of work today.....”
Mycroft doesn't reply immediately but the look in his eyes shift momentarily and Sherlock knows he has hurt him.
John still remembered the way to the mysterious meadow as if he had only just been there yesterday. He would probably still be able to ride there without a single wrong turn with his eyes closed.
“If I were dating you”, he says, “I'd want everybody to know. Hell....I'd hire one of those planes to write it across the sky.”
It's like this physical ache inside of my chest behind my lungs and it hurts and it makes it hard to breathe.
“Where's Greg?” John says, still slightly coughing, in an attempt to direct attention away from himself.
John doesn't really understand why Sherlock keeps apologizing. He's done nothing wrong. Whatever is making him feel the way he's feeling now....it's all fine.
I'm finding it difficult to divide my concentration between covertly looking at John, thinking about John, both wishing John would look and would definitely never look at me again and having smalltalk with this girl I've just met.
'My name is Mrs. Hudson and I am head of housekeeping here. It is my job to know everything that goes on'. She winked at him. John gave her a small smile that did not quite reach his eyes.
No matter how much he thought about it his mind seemed to turn to only one destination every single time.
And sure enough, there he is, Holmes, not yet gone, but, from the looks of it, in the process of making another hasty retreat.
They all had turned up empty. Loose strands blowing in an otherwordly wind because there was nothing there to connect to.
If John suddenly does wake up he will just close his eyes and pretend he is still unconscious. He is good at pretending.
The insatiable craving and incessant want that had racked his body constantly for the last couple of days, flooding his veins, with only Sherlock's gentle touches and ministrations keeping him from drowning in it completely, were no longer there.
Sherlock is 9 years old and he is sitting on a marble bench in one of the vast hallways of the Order's buildings.
It was night. Had been for a while now. There was a full moon in the sky and, now that the gray clouds that had hung overhead so oppressively during the day had moved along, countless stars could be seen.
'I said it's fine',  a few moments of silence before Sherlock continued. His tone seemed to finally be a bit softer this time.
“If people don't find you in the stables or at breakfast this morning they will probably just assume you've gone out early to get work done in the gardens and orchard. They'll just go on and continue with their own duties as the day progresses....now if people can't find you in the afternoon either....that's when questions will start to rise....”
During their actual classes Sherlock always does his very best to stay as far away from John as he possibly can.
It's set in France and there are warm colours and the soundtrack is pleasant and I think it's about a woman who runs a small bakery but I'm having a hard time concentrating on any of it because John's arm is now definitely slung around the back of my seat with the tips of his fingers casually grazing my shoulder.
John was mesmerized. He felt like an explorer finding a beautiful garden in a forest of thorns. He had no idea if Sherlock was even aware he was showing his hand to such an extent. He usually kept close to himself, carrying an air of aloofness and superiority while any personal questions were met with short evasive answers that weren't much of an answer at all.
And with that Sherlock stretched out his hand for John to take. His smile widening as John answered it with one of his own and took the outstretched hand.
As we make our way up the stairs towards my room John suddenly stops. He's looking at the pictures hanging on the wall and once again I cringe.
A group made up out of seven the most powerful of mages. But they have become all-powerful at a price.
“There we go”, John's voice had been all gruff and gravely. It had done things to Sherlock. “Way better than sitting on the cold ground, right?”
Also: I have SUCH a soft spot for Mycroft! I like to think these boys used to have a very lovingly relationship, but it got derailed somewhere along the way. I also have a soft spot for Mycroft calling young Sherlock 'Lock' or 'Locky'.
In the end we turn it into this sort of game where we make up a story for ourselves based on what we guess is going on.
Sherlock is looking out of his bedroom window. He is carefully peeking past a small crack between the curtains.
John can't really believe what he's hearing and so he looks up wide-eyed and with a look of utter shock on his face.
Fifty-eight years together sounds like a long time but I don't think any amount of years will ever have been enough.
And as his fingers lost contact with the wall on his left and the fingers of his right hand had not yet found anything solid to touch upon on the other side, for a moment, he felt as if he was floating in inky black water.
Outside the window the sky has gone from sunny to gray and overcast and a slight drizzle has started to come down.
After the ordeal in his mind-palace this morning his thoughts are not entirely coherent and Watson's hands seeking support on his lower abdomen and waist while he kisses Sherlock's neck surely aren't doing the clarity of his mind any favors either.
Although....not consciously at least. It was a warmth that started in his chest, but quickly moved to his lower abdomen.
The dark man extends his hand towards the soldier and Sherlock lets out an inhuman wail that seems to be made out of the purest of sorrow.
The other thing that was distracting him was Sherlock. Sherlock was sitting at the opposite end of the table, reading a book, he seemed different today. His hair wasn't as unruly as it had been the last time. All of his curls were neatly held in place just so with what John assumed was hairspray. Well, all but one curl that hung defiantly across Sherlocks forehead. John couldn't stop looking at it. And then there was his shirt. Sherlocks attire from last time had been classy, but pretty unassuming. Everything he had worn had been a dark color. Almost designed to make him blend in. The shirt he wore today was a very tight purple thing with a v-neck.  Lost in thought Johns eyes drifted from Sherlocks errant curl to his neck. Which was surprisingly pale, a stark contrast with the purple of his shirt and the jet-black color of his hair. Sherlock swallowed and without even realizing he was doing it John answered with a swallow of his own.
“It's alright”, he says, mainly because that's what people say in these kinds of situations .Not because he actually believes it. He and Holmes both know what happened here. They've waited too long.......the Magpie King......he has caught up with them and because of them an innocent girl has died.
Of course she had assumed it was a woman. The only person John had talked to about his bisexuality was Greg.....and if that hadn't been the first red flag that his relationship with Mary maybe wasn't as perfect as he had hoped.......
'I think I'm ready', he said, stretching his back as well, 'at least I hope to god I'm ready. I'd hate to think this was all for nothing. I'm used to rugby, but who knew math could be such a work-out.'
