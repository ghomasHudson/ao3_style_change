Immediately, he started pumping his hips and guided Steve’s ass upward with his hands. Because Tony might not be able to do anything to prevent the hyper stimulation that came with being an omega, but he could damn well make sure that Steve enjoyed this as much as possible.
“Shankyou” Tony mumbled from where he was now sprawled on top of Steve, his face smashed against the super soldier’s naked ribs. A little grabby motion of his fingers down south informed him that Steve was in fact wearing pajama bottoms under the sheets, and wasn’t that the most disappointing thing that had happened to him all day. As a petty revenge, he pressed his nose closer to Steve’s warm skin, inhaling the crisp alpha scent of green apples and fresh snow that still managed to halt all the synapses in his mind even six months after getting into Captain America’s pants for the first time. If Tony had been a considerate partner, he would have thought of how his own body must reek of booze, sweat and boozy sweat, and would have at least offered to go take a shower. As it happened, the last shred of his decency had gone down the drain with the old fashioned that Rhodey had spilled on his jacket earlier that evening and, oh right, that’s where he had left his jacket – in the men’s room where he and Rhodey had attempted to clean it in spite of the fact that none of them could even stand straight at that point, let alone figure out how to remove alcohol stains from consciously-grown velvet.
, he thought as he hit the jackpot and Steve’s spine arched off the bed, trapping his erection against their stomachs.
. But, you know, why are we still together when I obviously keep fucking up emotionally and disappointing you sexually?” He struggled to keep his voice light and careless.
“I told you I didn’t want to talk about it,” he muttered, and immediately kissed Steve hard and dirty on the lips. Rings. He needed to go buy rings. He couldn’t design them, because his good eye for weapons and machines and armors were wasted on something as delicate as jewelry, but he could go to the best jewelers in America. Hell, in the world. He could ask Happy and Rhodey to come with. And of course, he would send pictures to Pepper to get her opinion, because Tony’s tastes leaned toward anything red, gold and with flames painted on the side, so obviously he would need her. He already needed her to do everything else for him, what was one more thing.
“I thought that rule was about me.”
“What?”
Steve huffed, either a quiet laugh or a sigh, Tony couldn’t say.
“So, do you want to talk about it or would you like us to pretend nothing happened and just keep on screwing?”
If his eyes hadn’t been closed, he would have rolled them. “Everyone’s fine, the girl just cried because her dress was designer and she was supposed to give it back after the party. I told her I’d pay for it, and I told Rhodey to stop dating Victoria Secret angels.”
Tony kinda wanted to marry him.
“God, I hate you.” Then, because he was drunk, in bed, and he had a half-naked Steve under – most of – his fingers, he pressed his hips forward until the hard bulge of his pants rubbed against Steve’s thigh, the separation of their clothes and the bedsheets just thin enough to drive him slightly mad. “Can we have sex? I’ve been horny and thinking about you all night.”
“Sure. I’m up for anything. That’s actually the title of the piece Oprah Magazine did on me in ‘08: ‘Tony Stark: Up for Anything’. I’ll email it to you.”
Tony scrambled across the sheets, fumbling in the dark until he found his way in his third favorite place in the world: between Steve’s legs (his second favorite place being his lab, and his first being between Steve’s legs on the couch in his lab). He grabbed Steve’s bent knees with his palms and slowly slid down his hands underneath his thighs, until he reached that soft patch of skin where his legs met his ass. Even in pitch blackness, Tony knew exactly what he was looking at. He had spent so long tracing Steve’s skin with his fingertips that even with his eyes closed he could picture all that expense of smooth golden skin perfectly. He pressed forward until the tip of his cock met Steve’s entrance, and right on cue Steve’s breathing started getting fast and shallow, because nothing got him more hot and bothered than this.
“JARVIS, cancel that order! It’s almost five in the morning, Tony. I’ll go get us lube tomorrow at a reasonable hour.”
Apparently, Steve Rogers was.
into next week. Now open my pants for me, I can’t see where my fingers are.”
“How was the rest of the party?” Steve asked, his fingers treading softly through Tony’s hair, detangling them from what was probably a scandalous amount of cotillion, confetti and glitter.
“Well I don’t, not about
When he finally stopped trembling after what felt like seconds but could have been a few minutes of black out, he rolled his sweaty forehead off Steve’s throat and sighed dejectedly:
Right. The clothes.
But instead, what he heard was:
Tony grinned in the dark, and slithered back down.
Tony snorted, which was his usual reaction to Steve being his adorable, naïve self. That and a good eye roll.
. Steve’s file didn’t mention a bond mate, not even a partner, but Tony had a feeling, a feeling which he would never share out loud not only because asking someone whether they were grieving a bond mate was deeply rude and intrusive, but also because he didn’t want to know the answer. Steve obviously liked getting fucked by an omega, had obviously done it before judging from the way he was as comfortable handling Tony’s slick and flush and oversensitivity as he was handling his shield. And from Tony’s research, there had been two dark-haired, spit-fired, try-me-and-it-will-be-the-last-thing-you-do omegas in Steve’s entourage before his time in the ice. Peggy Carter and Bucky Barnes. Tony was ready to bet that if Steve had been bonded to someone, it would have been one of these two. Hell, it could have been both since poly-bonding hadn’t been outlawed in the States until the 50s. In any case, Tony wasn’t about to open that particular can of worms, wasn’t even about to touch it with his suit on.
“I love you too.”
“I don’t know, would you be okay with being on top?”
“I told you already, I don’t think it’s disappointing, just fl-”
God, Tony wanted to marry him.
He opened his eyes, but of course he was still blind as a bat in the dark room, so he fumbled around until he got his hand on what he hoped was Steve’s nipple and pinched it. However, since Steve had a chemically-engineered tolerance for pain, he didn’t make a sound, and Tony wasn’t sure what he had grabbed.
But marriage, a civil union. That he could handle. And there might just be the tiniest chance that Steve would say yes.
“Yeah, yeah, flattering, you said that before,” Tony gritted and he let his head rest on the hollow of Steve’s throat, gripping Steve’s cheeks to spread them wider and got him down on his cock, inch by inch. “Well, get ready sweetheart, ‘cos you’re gonna feel real flattered in about two minutes.”
Except that Tony had the distinct feeling that it wasn’t getting
Seconds passed with nothing but silence, a silence so heavy that none of them dared breathe or move, as if the slightest sound could somewhat detonate the grenade that Tony had carelessly thrown between them. When seconds turned into minutes, Tony realized that he didn’t share Steve’s inhumane ability to hold his breath and the sound of his own shaky inhale was loud as a gunshot in the stifling darkness of the bedroom. Ultimately, Steve unclasped each of his fingers from Tony’s hips, so slowly and carefully that he might as well have been disarming a bomb, and he slowly rolled on his back next to Tony, who was calculating how fast he could asphyxiate himself with a pillow before Steve tried to stop him. At least he would die surrounded by the scent of fresh snow and green apples, he thought, before realizing that he had just reached a new level of pathetic, which was certainly a surprise considering the words that had escaped his mouth just moments ago. But, again, that was Tony Stark for you, forever breaking boundaries in science, wealth and mortifying levels of embarrassment.
“It’s not pregnancy I’m worried about.”
“I said sure, we can have sex.”
“Hell yes, it’s okay. It’s 100% okay. Absolutely A-okay. It’s – it’s… JARVIS, let the record show I’m giving full consent here.”
“I know,” Steve murmured against his lips when Tony finally broke their kiss. “So let’s not talk about it.” And here, he clenched down on Tony’s spent cock, making both of them gasp.
And here Tony squirmed, and frowned down in the general direction of his cock – for fuck’s sake, he really needed to ask JARVIS to switch on the lights – and winced because even though the sensation of his own hand was pretty fucking good, something was definitely wrong. He clenched his ass reflexively, waiting for the usual trickle of slick to run down the back of his thighs but…
in the sex department, if he was being honest, and here Tony had to mentally shake off the memories of all the times he had shot his load way too soon while inside
Dignified? Probably not. Satisfying? Abso-frickin-lutely.
“I really have to do everything myself around here,” he mumbled as he pried one of his hands away from where it had been clenching Steve’s shoulder and got it around his cock, pushing his briefs out of the way. The feeling of his hot palm, warmed by the prolonged contact with Steve’s own overheated skin, against his dick was enough to wrench another moan out of him, and he was suddenly jerking off hard and fast, unable to stop himself and get on with the rest of his plan – which had been to undress Steve, flip him on his stomach and give him the ride of his life.
“I thought you wanted to screw me,” came the hot murmur against his throat, immediately followed by the warm-wet-thrilling sensation of a tongue pressing flat against the underside of his jaw.
And his third thought had been:
“Why would I, when I have you and JARVIS?”
Tony that was giving Steve cold feet, but rather the idea of getting inside
outside of Steve. At this point, it was useless to pretend that his sexual record with Rogers was anything other than embarrassing, and what the fuck Steve was getting out of this whole relationship was still a mystery to Tony. Even if it was true that most alphas didn’t usually go around getting hot around the ears at the idea of being fucked by an omega, Tony didn’t doubt that Steve could have his pick of any number of omegas willing to switch it up in the bedroom. With his abs, and his face, and his body, and his whole personality, it was still a wonder why he bothered with Tony at all.
“Right, yes, definitely. I’ll get right on that. Just gimme a minute to…”
Steve, bless his heart, ignored Tony’s furious rambling at his own body, and instead clasped his fingers around Tony’s jaw, forcing him to look up in the general direction of his face.
“The second option, please.”
Tony sucked in a breath of air and blinked in the dark. Was it okay? Was it okay for Steve Rogers, the man Tony had been steadily falling in love with for the past few months while desperately trying to ignore it before it was too late and he screwed everything up like he always did, to fuck him? Was it okay for the sexiest, kindest, most adorable, most gorgeous alpha, the one who had spread his legs for Tony countless times, who had sucked him and rimmed him and jerked him for hours, to get inside him?
! Of all people! – to get between his legs and fuck him, the throbbing need to come had been so desperate and urgent that Steve’s jean-clad, muscular thigh had seemed like the perfect way to release the trembling heat that had been balling up inside him.
“First of all,” Tony spat out soft tendrils of the carpet which clung to his tongue. “First of all, I thought you would pick them up on your way to bed. Second of all,” and here, he gave up trying to free himself and simply got on his elbows and started crawling forward, “that was all entirely premeditated and I am now in the perfect position to go to bed with a minimum amount of noise, thus leaving your beauty rest undisturbed. Listen,” and he kept crawling, rubbing his stomach on the carpet for emphasis, “not a whisper. I am a goddamn genius.”
“Wait, what?”
“I am so very honored to be included, sir,” came JARVIS’ dry reply, and now that Tony was thinking about it, he wondered if Steve and his AI were spending too much time together. They were starting to sound awfully similar.
Steve let out a little puff of embarrassed laughter, like he used to the first few times JARVIS had chimed in while they were doing the horizontal tango. Well, more like vertical, if Tony’s coming in his pants while pinned between the bar and Steve was taken into account. But then that would just make it regular tango, wouldn’t it?
“Now, see, why would you do something like that? Here I am, trying to show you a good time and you keep making me jump the gun. I’m starting to think maybe you don’t really like sleeping with me, seeing how fast you want me to be done.”
But that was okay. Steve had been steadily dating him for about six months, unsteadily having sex with him for seven, and had been more generally putting up with Tony for over a year. He was probably used to being disappointed by now. Even in the sex department.
Steve’s grinding came abruptly to a halt, his body frozen over Tony’s, his fingers pressing bruises on his hips, and Tony realized that he had said those words out loud.
“I’m dry. I’m actually dry,” Tony’s own voice sounded incredulous. “How the fuck am I dry right now? I spent all night embarrassingly wet just thinking about you, upstairs and naked in bed.”
Even in the pitch blackness of the bedroom, Tony recognized the sleepy mumble of a super soldier muttering in his pillow. God he hoped that Steve was naked under the sheets. Now that the image of a pliant, barely awake, naked Steve had ingrained itself in his mind, Tony found himself drawn to it like a moth to a flame and he instinctively stepped toward the bed, and promptly ended face first on the expensive carpet.
Tony braced himself. For what, he wasn’t entirely sure. A gentle let down was the most obvious hypothesis, though an awkward conversation about feelings was just as possible and equally dreadful. Least likely was the probability of Steve getting angry with him, but it still had to be taken into consideration. After all, Tony had been the one pushing barriers and obstacles in front of their relationship, fucking up at every single opportunity and generally reminding Steve that he was not boyfriend material. And here he was, blurting out love declarations in the middle of sex like a goddamn teenager having his dick wet for the first time.
Steve huffed but obediently started unbuckling Tony’s pants with one hand, while the other was shoving the thin sheets that had been separating them aside.
“I can’t believe I’m fucking dry. We need lube. Do I even own lube? JARVIS, get someone to bring us lube right now.”
, that’s all he needed to aim at. He was never going to last long, he could already feel the heat pooling down in his lower abdomen and his toes were starting to curl in pleasure, but he could still get Steve mostly there.
“JARVIS, give us some light. I’m gonna need to see what I’m doing for this.”
Gosh, Steve was an idiot.
He did that little trick three more times before Steve realized that he wasn’t getting anywhere until he got an answer.
“You’re supposed to be on my side,” he exclaimed indignantly. “And what exactly am I holding right now?”
“Hush, you know the rules, you don’t get to talk during sexy time.”
Steve obviously didn’t share his concern for dignity and was just plain moaning under him, squeezing his inner muscles and making Tony hiss in the process.
Tony stumbled into the room, swearing under his breath at the stray clothes that had wrapped themselves around his feet, nearly sending him sprawling on the floor, and which refused to untangle from his ankles and the sole of his shoes.
century took care of that too. Three words: knot-proof condoms. Well, two words. I’m not sure. Anyway, they have this special shape to contain the knot so there is no skin-on-skin contact. No skin contact, no bonding. Yay to commitment-free sex and emotionally-detached hookups. You can thank the 80s for that one. Well, that and good rock music.”
, y-you, you keep begging me to fuck you in that sweet, sweet voice of yours.”
Steve’s chest rumbled with a silent laugh, and he cradled Tony’s face between his hands, bringing him up into a kiss as his hips kept undulating on Tony’ softening erection. When he spoke, his voice was low and husky, sending a fresh wave of shivers down Tony’s spine:
“What’s wrong?” Steve’s voice had lost its teasing edge and was now deadly neutral. If Tony could see, he’d bet his eyebrows were drawn tight, his eyes straight and focused ahead, full on Captain America-I’m-here-to-kick-ass-and-drink-milk-and-I’ve-just-finished-my-milk serious expression.
Steve’s fingers jerked against his jaw and Tony would bet half his car collection that he was blushing, a red haze at the tip of his ears that slowly dissolved into a pink hue across his nose and cheekbones. God, he had it bad for the guy. Which was even more embarrassing considering that he was currently unable to perform the one thing that Steve was getting out of their relationship apart from heartburns and headaches.
“Say it one more time. Please.”
, Tony thought reflexively. And then, when he registered Steve’s actual words, when he realized that Steve – Steve who never backed down from a fight, Steve who never gave up, Steve who liked to remind everyone that
Case in point.
Steve’s voice sounded unfocused and even a little pained from where he had been trying to wiggle his way onto Tony’s cock, rocking down in tiny little movements. Tony hardened his grip on the curve of his ass in response, not letting him set the rhythm just yet. He knew that Steve wouldn’t break out of his grip right now, not until Tony got inside him and got his angle just right.
“Duly noted, sir,” JARVIS answered and then, because JARVIS was a real bro, “You may go ahead, Captain Rogers.”
“Sure,” Steve chimed, bringing Tony’s usual inner rambling and slightly less usual grinding of the hips to a halt.
“You just can’t do anything yourself, can you?”
“Fuck yes,” Tony breathed. He would go to his grave saying that was a cocky reply to Steve’s snark, and not a sound wrenched from his throat when Steve thrusted his hips up, rubbing the front of his pajamas against the hard line of Tony’s cock which was straining against his underwear, peaking from the open fly of his pants. And really, why the fuck was he still dressed? He had given Steve one job, and it didn’t even require any super serum strength to accomplish it. The friction of soft cotton against his dick was excruciating and the feeling of Steve’s own erection pushing toward him, poking through the flannel of his pajamas, dragging against his hipbones and stomach, was enough to drive him insane.
Instead of agreeing with Tony and enthusiastically tackling him into the sheets like he hoped, Steve made a soft sound at the back of his throat. “Everyone okay? No one injured?”
“God, I love you,” he blurted, his face pressed into the pillow that he was gripping with both hands.
So when Tony had met the actual Steve Rogers and discovered that he wasn’t just brave, headstrong, commanding, righteous like his father had told him, but also hot as hell, kind and funny and shy and so deliciously awkward, of course Tony had fantasized about getting bent over the nearest surface and fucked within an inch of his life by Captain America. Even Romanoff, Black Widow, Russian spy, voted most attractive female beta in the Western hemisphere, still got a little gleam in her eyes whenever Steve removed his sweat-soaked shirt at the end of their sparing sessions, so he clearly wasn’t the only one affected by Steve’s general perfect alphaness.
Just as Tony was considering making a run for it and locking himself in his lab for the rest of his existence – or, more realistically, until Pepper came to get him for the next annual board meeting of Stark Industries – Steve cleared his throat.
“Then get to work, soldier.”
Tony felt Steve smile from where he had been pressing soft, open-mouth kisses on his throat.
Long story short, Tony had zero qualm about humping his way to orgasm tonight. Well, this morning. What time was it? Probably too late (early?) for Steve to be interested in one of their round of athletic sex. Well… athletic for Steve, since he was often the one doing the grunt work while Tony’s role was mostly to provide enthusiastic encouragement and a healthy amount of slick so that his dick could find its way into Steve’s ass as smoothly as possible. It was sure hard to be a rich, privileged omega with an inhumanly sexy boyfriend who insisted on getting fucked into the nearest surface at least four times a week. Honestly, Tony didn’t know how he got himself out of bed in the morning.
Then, after a second attempt.
“Rogers. Cap. Captain. There is not a single alternate reality in the multiverse where I would choose sleep rather than sex with you. And if I’m wrong, and there is in fact a Tony Stark going about his business in some god-forsaken corner of the world and if he is dumb enough to say no when you are offering him to have his wicked way with your body, then I will find him and
–, Steve was giving him an out. He was being handed a goddamn joker, a reset button, a get-out-of-jail free card. They could go back to the way things were before Tony vomited his heart all over their relationship, they could go back to peaceful days and fun dates and mind-blowing sex and quiet nights. Steve was giving them a chance to go past Tony’s anxiety and absence of filter and multiple daddy issues and general neurosis.
“What are you even getting from this?” Tony asked, because apparently all that expensive liquor he had gotten out for Rhodey’s birthday had disintegrated what little brain-to-mouth filter he had left.
“Oh, you afraid to pop a knot? Don’t worry, the second half of the 20
“Great”, Tony mumbled, his nose and mouth still mushed against Steve’s ribs. “Rhodey let his date drive and she crashed his birthday present into the pool. But I knew he’d do something stupid like that so I got him two Maseratis. ‘Cos I’m a goddamn genius.”
“I thought you didn’t want to talk about this,” he shot back, and Tony could hear him trying to compose himself, gripping Tony’s biceps to refrain the full-body shudders that kept running through him. Deciding that was just unacceptable, Tony started pushing inside for real, and they both groaned loudly when the head of his dick breached him. He stopped right then, and clutched fingers around the curve of Steve’s ass, which was getting slippery with sweat and Tony’s own slick.
“This is delightful,” Tony said, biting into the slice. “You all look so precious.”
Steve almost scoffed. “
Steve laughed. “I’m literally almost double your age.”
“Tony’s a nice guy. You should ask him out.” That would be a frequent thing Steve would hear over the next few months. And he had tried. Twice. Kind of.
“Yeah, they can manage without us. Worst case, we’re only going a couple hours’ drive away. If I need to call in emergency transport to get us back to the city it won’t be a huge deal.”
He pointed at it. “Is that Bradley’s cheesecake?”
Tony had run to the kitchen to grab some snacks to return to his workshop, so he hadn’t been paying attention to what Steve was watching on TV when he first walked into the common area. Curious to see what got Steve worked up in a kind of fury usually reserved for a losing sports team, Tony peeked his head into the living room to see what the problem was.
“That day you got injured?”
is ever upsetting you, or you need to rant or cry or vent about anything, I’m here for you, Tony, no questions asked. I’m not going to pester you about it, or make you talk about something you don’t want to, but I care about you, and I’m here to support you however you need it,” Steve said, letting go of Tony’s hand and leaning back in his seat.
Tony was not one to dwell on the past, at least he wasn’t until he got together with Steve.
“Well, that’s good. That was . . . it was really scary, Tony.”
“To ask Tony out. This is a singles mixer. How are you planning on . . . mixing?”
Steve reached between them, shifting to make room so he could stroke Tony off with his other hand.
After cleaning up, the two both crashed into bed in each’s arms, asleep the second their heads hit the pillows.
The box was full of pictures he had JARVIS print and little mementos of their relationship. Tony began to sort through the contents.
“Tony, you still up there?”
“Too much to ask? Of course not. Actually, it’s a great idea. Just don’t tell Clint we have this though, he’ll eat the whole damn thing.”
“Evacuated already. Once the parents started yelling the staff quickly got everyone out.”
“Ughhhhhhhh,” was all Tony could respond.
“Hmm?”
bed you needed to be in. And last time I checked mine is plenty big enough for the two of us. C’mon, let’s grab you a change of clothes from the dorm and we can head back to my place.”
On the TV, four bakers were frantically running around a kitchen set, grabbing supplies from a shelf. A woman dropped a container of flour and it burst onto the floor. A man with a handlebar mustache started whipping a mixing bowl.
“Oh come on, there has to be something you really want that you normally would never get yourself.”
Steve already understood how frustrating it could be to want to help and know that medically you couldn’t. A childhood of sickness, missed playtime, and hospital visits pre-serum meant that Steve didn’t have to imagine how much Tony would be struggling right now.
But before Steve could finish talking, Tony entered code needed to alter the programming for the cloaking device. Suddenly, where Steve had been standing alone in the smoke, he now found himself surrounded by AIM agents, guns raised, next to a massive tank whose beam continued to assault the campus walls.
They hosted a birthday party for Steve at the Tower, taking some time to watch the fireworks celebration from the roof. Steve spent the whole time arms wrapped around Tony from behind, whispering soft words into Tony’s ear as the colorful fireworks rang out over the city.
They fell asleep like that, but when Steve woke up that morning, he found he was alone in the bed.
“Absolutely,” Tony said as he reached up and cupped Steve’s face. “You’re amazing, Steve.”
Steve leaned over, and opened the drawer with one hand. He didn’t take his lips off Tony’s neck as he blindly fumbled around the drawer until he pulled out a bottle of lube.
“Love?”
They left the medical wing and trudged over to Director Fury’s office, with Steve taking Tony’s hand in his with an affectionate squeeze.
Tony felt a pit in his stomach. “What do you mean?”
“Wanna take this inside?” Steve asked, running his thumb down Tony’s jaw.
“Yes! Steve, don’t you remember what I said when I asked you this morning?”
“Explosion by the front gate. We’re investigating.”
“Hi, Loki,” Tony mumbled, face still buried.
As Tony said that, a glow emitted through the smoke and a continuous beam shot out toward the campus exterior wall. Chunks of rock began to fly back toward the campus.
“ . . . Yeah.” Tony sighed and laid back down on the grass on his stomach, burying his face in his arms.
“So how are the weathering tests going?”
“Yeah?”
Tony missed when he first met Steve, when it was easy to deflect his feelings by teasing him. But now? His crush had gotten so bad of late, that when they didn’t have a topic to talk about, like in their study group, Tony got flustered.
Tony glanced over the pit. “Looks like a basic ball pit. What’s wrong?”
“Hmm. Okay. Go sit on the couch. I’ll be right with you.”
Tony began to move in, and Steve slightly tilted his head, as they both moved together, lips almost touching and -
“Ugh, don’t remind me, actually glad I was in the ice for that,” Steve mumbled, and the mildly dark response got a snort out of Tony, who slightly choked on his drink. Tony couldn’t help but notice the cheeky look on Steve’s face as they both started laughing.
Tony nervously looked at Steve, and looked a bit uneasy. It was clear the conversation wasn’t going anywhere and Steve desperately wished he could slam an eject button to flee if he could.
- and he felt his body continue to shift. Mouth turning into more of a muzzle, claws coming out of his hands and feet, light brown fur spreading all over his body. He wanted to panic, run, scream, do anything to make it stop. It wasn’t painful, but it was terrifying. He dropped forward, now on all fours, and the instinct to run and escape the indoors hurdled him through the glass window and out onto the lawn of the compound and sprinting into the woods.
Steve smiled and pulled Tony in close.
“It’s fine, Sam. Honestly, I’m just over this being a distraction for me. Better to just move on, get over it and focus on finishing the school year, right?”
But Steve woke up the next morning with Tony in his arms, the other man having made his way across the bed during the night.
The first few passes went alright. Teddy noticed an open maintenance shed toward the back of the campus, although when they investigated there didn’t seem to be anything out of order. For the next sweep, they agreed it was best for the purpose of a learning exercise to have Steve and Tony go with one of the younger students each. As Tony passed the maintenance shed with Teddy again, it was locked as they had left it. They returned to the front of campus, grabbing the snacks as they waited for the others to return.
“I wouldn’t worry, Tony. I’ve seen your moves at Club A. I think you’d do great,” Steve said, his focus buried in fitting armor plates together so he couldn’t see the new large blush across Tony’s cheeks. Seeing his opening, Tony took a deep breath and began to ask.
Tony looked at the gala program again, and then finished fastening it into the scrapbook. He added some more pictures, put in some more captions and stickers, and finally satisfied, looked at his project.
“Noted, both noted. Alright. Good job. You two get out of here. I want you both on bedrest for the rest of the weekend. Rogers, I don’t care about whatever healing abilities you may have. You had parts of a tank drop on you. You report to the medical wing for a check-up first thing Monday morning. Is that clear?”
When they arrived back at the cabin, Steve stopped the car in the driveway and reached over to stop Tony’s hand from unfastening the seat belt.
“Steve, Steve, I’m close -”
Tony couldn’t find the words to articulate how much Steve meant to him, but Tony knew that there were other ways to say ‘I love you’. Steve had already found one.
They both washed up and changed into pajamas. Tony got into bed first, claiming the side of the bed furthest from the door. Steve climbed into bed soon after, getting comfortable under the warm blanket. He was right about the bed - at the moment there was a comfortable foot and a half between them with more room to spare.
“What’s that?”
“Aww, do I make you nervous, Steve?”
“Tsum sum.”
“Alright, Tony. It was nice to see you. Have a nice Valentine’s Day!” Steve quickly backed away, and retreated back to Sam and Bucky.
to say ‘hey, can I buy you a coffee?’ because there’s no stakes in it. Either they take me up on it, and we have a couple hour hang out, I get to know them a bit and maybe it leads to something, maybe it doesn’t, or they just say no and I can just let it go, no hard feelings and move onto the next person who might be interested in having a little fun.” Tony looked down and started picking at the grass.
So Steve moved into place as Tony pushed off and plopped onto the tube as they accelerated down the hill. Steve felt Tony lean into his side as they zoomed down the slope toward the lake.
Steve slid back into the booth, cheeks burning bright red as Tony was pulled into a dance with a girl Steve didn’t recognize.
“I love you. I have been in love with you for months and it’s driving me up the wall, I don’t know how to not get flustered around you. And I’ve been so scared because you’re also a really good friend and a teammate and you’re the first guy I’ve had really deep feelings for and that’s scary too and I just - I just didn’t know how to deal with all of that. It scares me and you scare me and I love you so much, and I thought if I tried to distance myself or convince myself you didn’t care then that would make it better but I hurt you instead, and I’m - I’m just so sorry, Steve.”
dynamic
“But then a month ago. I was up in my workshop working late, tinkering with something when I heard a big crash. Ran outside to see a big brown wolf in the moonlight, just standing in the middle of the field. Then the wolf got up off all fours and stood on its hind legs. And I could see it wasn’t just a wolf. And then that wolf turned around, looked at me . . . and fell to the ground and turned back into you.
All too often Steve’s dreams would return to the no-tech dimension, the vision of Tony stuck behind in that vivid hell. Nobody knew about the nights he would wake up drenched in sweat, how frequently Steve would catch the sunrise as he spent another night painting or working out alone.
“Yep. But it’s not going to be what you think it is.”
“By what?”
The energy of the city and the moment got to be almost too much as they entered the Tower, making Tony feel like he was going to bubble over and explode like a shaken up soda.
Jan shrugged. “Not here, but I think he might have gone back to the quad to chew out Scott. Widow texted me to ask what could have possibly happened to make
“Okay change of plans. I can distract the tank, but I’m not sure how close I can get. How you doing down there?” Tony asked.
“What you asked me, earlier? Tony, I was so scared and so lost when I thought we were never going to see you again. And that I was never going to get to tell you how I truly feel. And the team went through so much and I’m still scared that I could lose any of you, and especially you, Tony. I don’t need anything for Christmas. I already have you back. I don’t need anything else.”
But as Tony approached, two missiles shot out from the top of the tank. He quickly unibeamed each on, relieved the work on his aim had paid off, but the guns at the top of the tank made it clear there was more where that came from.
“What about the Valentines’ Day mixer? Didn’t you meet anyone there?”
“You look really great, Steve,” Tony said. “Got something special planned?”
On their third day, the weather wasn’t too great, with a small snowstorm blowing in. Steve and Tony had grabbed breakfast at a local diner, but otherwise spent the day in the cabin relaxing, Steve painting a landscape by the window and Tony tinkering on a small robot.
“I - you haven’t even tasted the food yet.”
They chatted, and walked down the boardwalk. They stopped to play some carnival games - Steve was great at the bottle stand game, Tony better at ring toss - and collected some tickets and stuffed animal prizes which they immediately handed over to some passing children.
“Have I done something, Tony?”
“I’ll keep an eye out, sir,” Jarvis replied from inside Tony’s helmet.
“Morning.”
“I - what?”
“You got a drink?” Steve asked.
Tony looked up and lightly chuckled.
He wasn’t sure how to ask, because this wasn’t going to be just a usual date. Between their busy schedules, and the high profile that came with being part of the Avengers, Tony and Steve had been keeping their relationship out of public view. The team knew, and so did some members of SHIELD, and Tony’s inner circle. But the fact that Iron Man and Captain America were an item was not public knowledge.
“Tony! Are you alright? What’s wrong?”
“Look closer.”
O’Leary’s made some of the best steaks in all of New York, and Tony reserved a private room for the team. Even Thor had managed to come, having decided to spend a few weeks on Earth with Jane. The dinner was delightful, with good food, drinks and just spending time in each other’s company without the pressures of saving the world for once. And Tony couldn’t help but notice the small smiles and glances he was getting from Steve across the table.
Later that week, each student received an email with their assignments. Tony opened the message and quickly scanned the calendar, his eyes landing on the following Friday.
“Sure! I could recommend a million places. What were you thinking? Tropical island? Rain forest? A cottage off a warm beach?”
deep down that something was wrong.
“Hulkling, Hawkeye, what is your current location?” Steve shouted into the communicator as he finished putting his gear on.
“Of course you do! You’re amazing, Tony, and I’ve wanted to be with you for so long and oh my
“Wanna go around a few times?” Steve asked, pointing to the rink.
Steve hadn’t felt this relaxed in his entire life. He hadn’t realized how heavy the weight of being Captain America had been on his spirit until he didn’t have to be that. The team was fine - they checked in twice a day - and for a week Steve could just be
“Oh, uh, you know, just passing through! Bye!” he said, and Tony, convinced he must be the same shade of red as his armor, turned and ran back in the direction he came from, leaving an incredibly confused Steve behind.
"I'm starting to think that I shouldn't leave the Tower anymore." Tony walked over to grab the tablet, noticing that Steve left the camera footage up for him. "Or maybe I just shouldn't leave you alone- Hey." He looked down and sat that Jamie had wheeled herself over to follow Tony, bumping into his leg. "Hey munchkin! Was I not giving you enough attention? Did Papa ignore you today?”
“Nothing sweetheart come on now, time for bed,” Steve said gently picking Tony with little effort. Tony in return gave a squeak fo surprise.
"What a productive morning. After that you must be hungry."
He was so caught up in his own head he didn’t hear the doors open, he didn’t see Steve standing in the doorway watching him with worried eyes. It was only when he heard Steve’s sigh (he should really get that sigh trademarked) he turned around and saw Steve still dressed in his captain America suit. Tony immediately jumped up and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck pulling him down for a kiss. Steve made a small noise of surprise before kissing Tony back gently.
“I did! It’s not like I had no sleep and I took naps.”
Steve watched Tony, content to have the man in his arms again. He didn’t know if it was just his own worries but the man felt skinnier. He would need to make sure he was eating properly now he was back. He closed his eyes and drifting off to sleep, holding Tony close. They both slept soundly the whole night, because they were both finally home.
Later that week Steve took Tony away to Prague. He wanted to make up for lost time. They spent the days in each other’s company. Tony smiled at the memories of Steve bringing him to the bridge.
"Steve I can't ask you to choose between me and Bucky again. I'm setting you free."
As much as Tony would later deny it he would do anything for Steve's waffles. The pair got changed and headed down to the shared kitchen. Tony sat at the island and watched Steve make his waffles.
Steve none the wiser smiled "Thank you Tony for being so understanding," he said, walking over and kissing the top of Tony's head before leaving again.
Tony turned around to face Bruce. "What’s up?"
Steve gave a hum to that and Tony sighed. "Fine make me get up and leave the comfort of our bed," he knew he was being dramatic but he was comfy.
“Tony, you promised you would look after yourself when I left.”
"Who dareth enter my sanctuary?"
It was only a couple days later when Steve had been called away on a classified mission somewhere in Europe. Of course, Tony wasn’t allowed to know anything. This was due to the small teeny tiny incident that occurred when Tony travelled to Portugal to make sure Steve was okay after he was injured on a mission. After that a new rule was put in place to stop any further interference from Tony.
"Hey sweetheart," Tony flinched at Steve's gentle voice, the same voice he used for Bucky because Tony was special anymore. "I'm sorry I've not been around. It’s just Bucky gets so nervous and he had nightmares. I need to be there for him."
"Oh hours. Yeah, I got up for a run, saved the world, met God," Steve let out a laugh and Tony melted at the sound.
Tony woke up to the light filtering through into the room, he rolled over on the bed to look at Steve. For once he was still asleep and Tony smiled to himself. He curled up against Steve’s side, feeling content. He heard a mumble and smiled.
Steve looked shocked, he stepped forward making Tony step back. "Sweet heart, Tony what are you trying to say."
Tony sighed, rubbing a hand over his face as he looked at the plans for what felt like the hundredth time.
“Sleep is boring, and I bet the mission has you all wound up…” Tony trailed off winking at Steve
Tony sat down again, picking up his notes and reading them over again. It was useless, the words just seem to blend together, moving around the page until they became one big blob of black ink. He threw the papers down with a groan and leaned on the desk.
Steve smiled into the kiss pulling back. “If this is the welcome, I’m getting now then I should go away more often,” Tony responded with a whine
"We're both idiots aren't we capsicle," they both laughed ay the familiarity.
"Oh, come on Tony," Bruce and Natasha followed Tony over to the couch. "You know they aren't like that. Bucky is his best friend, but you're the love of his life!"
Natasha sighed, dropping down onto the couch next to Tony. She put a hand on his shoulder and gave a smile. "Steve loves you Tony, only you. He never talks about Bucky the way he talks about you. When he talks about you his eyes light up and he smiles like he can't help it. You and Steve are each other’s perfect halve. You know there's nothing to worry about."
But Steve wasn’t here now and Tony was forgetting to eat despite Jarvis’s constant nagging. He would work himself to the bone because without Steve he found it difficult to sleep. Nightmares would haunt him, keeping him from rest.
"I always will."
Tony sighed; he knew she was right. He was just being paranoid. Steve would come back, kiss him and hold him. He would tell him he loved Tony and everything would be okay.
Tony sighed. He finished eating, clearing the plates away and saving Steve’s waffles for when he got back. He decided to get some work done if he wasn't getting time with Steve.
“Honey you don’t have to get all dressed up for me,” Tony purred, watching Steve before getting changed.
So now Tony had no idea where Steve was and even better no way to contact him. All Tony got were mission updates that told him Steve was uninjured but It wasn’t enough. He missed Steve; he always did but this was different. Of course, they weren’t joined at the hip, Steve went away every now and again and even when he was here Tony had meetings and upgrades to make so they spent time apart. But it was different now, he didn’t know where Steve was.
Tony thought about Natasha's words. She was right. Worrying about Steve and Bucky would only end in pain. He needed to end this, if he wasn't with Steve then it wouldn't hurt anymore.
"Hey Tony. Its Bruce."
Steve and Bucky were laughing, joking, teasing each other. Tony walked back to the bedroom, he couldn't bear to watch, the burning in his chest was overwhelming. If Steve wanted to hang out with Bucky, fine. He didn't need Steve.
“What are you staring at?”
"Talk to him Tony. Bottling this all up will only hurt the both of you."
Tony was a couple hours into designing new arrows for Clint when he heard someone enter the workshop.
“No go away less, much less, how about never actually. Yeah, just stay here with me. All the time, think about how much time we could have, we could get through your lists” Steve listened to Tony’s rambling with a smile.
"You be quiet and just think about how lucky you are. If it wasn't for me, you'd be eating pop tarts with Thor all day."
Steve sighed in reply walking into the bedroom they shared. He placed Tony on the bed carefully then walked over to the dresser grabbing a long shirt and clean boxers for him and Tony. He passed the clothes to Tony before changing himself.
The tower felt empty, sure he had his friends, Peter was coming around more to talk to him and Pepper tried to make sure he was eating at least one meal a day but it wasn’t the same. He missed Steve’s smile, his open arms, his laugh, his voice. “Get a grip Stark,” he said aloud, god when did he become so needy.
“Steve you can’t just- I was working…” he whined, burying his face in Steve’s chest.
"Uh yeah sure."
Tony huffed and started to eat "So much for peace and quiet..." his mood only got worse when he saw Steve walk back in with his jacket.
They were called out when some chemist believed he had found a cure for his cancer. Let’s just say the results weren’t pretty and it ended in a steroid fuelled maniac with super strength running around New York. He had already attacked and seriously injured a group of 25 tourists and killed 2 others. Tony and Steve were the first ones to initiate contact, Steve tried to talk sense and well….
"I'm fine Nat, just a little tired."
"Hey Tony can we talk"
This pattern continues over the next couple days. Date nights were cancelled. Food left uneaten. Tony threw himself further and further into his work. Sleeping less and eating less. Until he was pulled aside by Natasha.
Tony dropped his head to the desk "Bucky needs him, Bucky needs him. Bucky comes first." He muttered getting back to his work slightly angrier.
This was the internal monologue as Tony ran out the workshop with Bruce following close behind. He was only stopped by Natasha
“None of that, you need sleep,” Despite his firm tone Steve couldn’t help the blush forming on his face.
"You're just being paranoid. Steve loves you; he chooses you. He will always choose you," he mumbled, the tears made speaking harder.
"You can't keep doing this Tony. It’s not fair on you. You need to tell Steve how you really feel."
"I'm letting you go Steve."
Tony looked around the room and smiled. Leaning up he whispered in Steve’s ear
"Thank you for choosing me."
“Not a call, not a text message, not even a fucking letter. Stupid Fury, stupid mission, stupid, handsome, amazing Steve” Tony muttered to himself. Dammit no focus on work, not on Steve, work work, work. Tony forced himself to look back at the schematics on the screen but it was no use all he could focus on was the ache in his chest. He stood up and walked around the workshop, yawning. It was another night he was spending without sleep. He could hear Steve’s voice in his head, the disapproving frown that he would do anything to make disappear. It was unfair because It wasn’t even his fault technically. It was all Steve’s fault really.
That was until the workshop opened. "What do you want Bruce?"
"Look at that got me a man that’s charming, handsome and can cook."
Tony sat on the bed waiting. He counted the minutes ticking by before he gave up and got ready for bed. He lay in bed watching the door, waiting, willing Steve to walk through. To smile and apologise, to lie next to Tony and take him in his arms and tell him it was okay. That Tony wouldn't have to watch Steve choose between him and Bucky again. Because Tony wasn’t sure that Steve would choose him again.
"No! Ask me. Ask me right now. I will choose you, Tony its always you," Steve walked towards Tony backing him into the wall, he couldn't stop the tears. "Tony it’s you, I choose you. Please Love, sweetheart don’t, you can't just leave. Tony please it broke me when I lost Bucky but God it would kill me if I lost you."
Steve took a deep shaky breath, tears falling "Tony what n-no please no. I ca-can't no. You can't g-go. I need you Tony, sweetheart pleas-please."
Tony knew what that meant. Steve was going to get up and get changed, cover up those God-like abs (Tony knew he was thirsty but could you blame him!) and make him leave the bed.
"Tony you haven't eaten or slept in days. You stay in your workshop 24 hours. We miss you-"
Tony pulled Steve's shirt and kissed Steve hard on the lips. Steve choose him. Steve loved him. Steve wanted him.
Steve was a constant, he would bring Tony food when he was on a working binge, gently remind Tony when it was time to come to bed and force Tony away when he wouldn’t leave. Steve always seem to know when Tony needed a break, when he needed to be held even if Tony didn’t realise it himself.
"Morning Sunshine," Steve’s voice was always deeper in the morning.
"Bucky yeah I know. I just need to talk to you for a minute," Tony interrupted Steve, he got a nod from Steve as a response.
"Sorry sweetheart emergency meeting with Fury. I'll try and be back soon," Steve walked over, kissing Tony goodbye before leaving with a frown.
"Heard what? That the one person that could come between me and Steve just so happens to be the one fucking person that is barrelling back into our lives?!"
"I wanted to give you some warning..." that sounded bad "they’re bringing Bucky back." Oh, it wasn't bad it was just the most disastrous train wreck that could have hit Tony's life.
"I heard about what happened with Steve. I wanted to let you know that we are best friends but nothing more. I never wanted to come between the two of you. All Steve did was talk about how much he loved and missed you, you know."
As soon as the programme ended Tony rushed to his bedroom. He slammed the door shut behind him letting the tears fall. He sat down on the bed, trying to calm his breathing.
For the rest of the day Tony locked himself away in the workshop. He refused to think of Steve and how much fun he was probably having with Bucky. No, no, no he didn't care at all.
They all waved and said hi before turning their attention back to the Tv. Everyone except Tony.
This was the fourth night in a row he had spent working on fixing and improving the suit. He was currently trying to reinforce the chest plate after it was torn off him like it was fucking papier mâché during the fight. “Idiots always ruining my design.” Tony muttered shifting about some prototypes on the screen.
"My son is cute, so I compare him to cute animals." Tony smiled, making deliberate eye motions of checking him out. "You look good with a baby in your arms." Steve kissed him softly.
"No," Steve said with a shake of his head. "Not messed up, just troubled. It's more common than you think." Tony almost frowned a little. "Anxiety and PTSD, they go hand in hand, and-"
“Careful, thems’ strong commitment type words,” Bucky said, looking at him pointedly, one arm going out to catch Conor before he fell over Bucky’s leg. Rowan was trying to climb up his shoulder. “One might think you’re sweet on him, sweet enough to make a statement.”
Steve chuckled a little at them. "Alright, let's go swimming."
"How are things in our nation's capital?" Tony asked as the doors shut
"Of course," she said right away. "Mary was in college when Bill served his last tour."
"Why are you going through his music?"
"So soon?" Steve asked, a little furrow between his brows. "That won't hurt him, or damage the surgery that he had?"
Peter was not going back to sleep and he was making it clear that he did not want to stay in the bassinet, letting out little cries. Mary picked him up, then glanced over at Tony as she cradled him in her arms. "Do you think you could grab the bottle in the kitchen? It should be on the counter, I was warming it up before you got here."
Peter tossed and turned in his bed, clutching to his stuffed animal. He let out a little whimper before he opened his eyes, a few tears falling to his pillow. Peter sat up, stuffed cat to his chest. "Daddy," he murmured quietly.
Tony plopped down on the couch, and the woman smiled at him. He tapped his glasses, turning off the shades. “Have I asked before if I can call you Dany? Because I really think that Dany would fit you better.”
"We'll talk about it after dinner," Steve said quietly to them, noting that Wade was stalking over towards them, eyes pinched and staring in Tony's direction. "Head's up, Tony."
"And yet, you willingly put up with me."
"Did Mary tell you that she's moving," Mrs Fitzpatrick said suddenly. Mary almost facepalmed, but Tony was used to this.
As much as Tony still wanted to be angry with him, he just missed Steve. He told himself that it was stupid, to miss him more on this day more than any other, but it seemed to be human instinct. This time last year he was alone as well, so what did it matter that he was alone again, on another Valentine's Day?
And then, on that fateful movie night, when everyone had gone back to their quarters and it was just Steve and Tony in the common room, and Tony had been slightly tipsy and thought it would be hilarious to make a pass at Captain America, just to see him blush and stutter his way of this one, Steve – not Captain America –, Steve had stared at Tony with the clearest blue eyes he had ever seen and looked considering.
Distantly, among the cascades of shivers that ran up and back his spine in perfect synchronization with the slow drag of Steve’s cock, Tony became aware of the fact that he was getting wet. He could feel the telltale signs, the tingles in his lower abdomen, and then further down, where his dick was steadily dripping slick, gently at first, and then more profusely, soaking the sheet under him and making him slide toward the headboard every time Steve’s body rocked him forward, until Tony had to physically brace himself against those thrusts. Steve’s own stomach was probably equally slick by now, from where he was rubbing at the place where Tony was the wettest, up and down and up again.
“No, it’s not alright! For fuck’s sake, when you left the party I had to go to the bathroom and change underwear because Rhodey said I smelled like our dorm at MIT where I used to throw orgies and he didn’t need this kind of reminder on his birthday. That’s how wet I was until my body suddenly stopped cooperating! What the fuck, guys? Are you on vacation right now? Started a union? There are usually negotiations involved before you go on full-on strike!”
“Piece of confetti that fell from your hair.” Of course, the bastard with the enhanced night vision sounded amused.
Steve made a noncommittal sound and kept on stroking Tony’ hair soothingly, seemingly unfazed by the fact that he had Tony Stark humping his leg like a dog. And he probably was. After all, the very first time they had sex – if it could even be counted as sex – Tony had gotten off just like that. In his defense, when Steve Rogers, Captain America, leader of the Avengers, Alpha male of everyone’s dreams, had him pinned against the bar of the deserted common room, whispering in his ear that he wanted Tony –
He answered hurriedly, before this particular thought also found its way out into the world:
shut Tony right up.
“Just getting you started,” and really, Steve’s voice had absolutely no business being this composed, not when Tony had to keep rubbing his chest on the sheets just to remind himself that he didn’t have an arc reactor anymore, and that his heart was not about to fail him. “Is that okay?”
But Steve had simply frowned some more and shaken his head. Which Tony understood, of course. Back before the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s, penetrative sex with an alpha was a serious matter. Accidents happened and popping a knot – or clamping down on a partner for the alpha ladies – without meaning to was as life-altering as a pregnancy. Bond-breaking wasn’t allowed back then, and even today it was still far trickier than a divorce which could be up and done with by the simple stroke of a pen. So, Tony got it. Steve had cold feet about getting inside him, which was understandable from someone who had grown up knowing that penetrating a partner meant possibly knotting them and being bonded for life. Message received. Loud and clear. No problemo.
It took all of Tony’s efforts – and a little help from Steve – to hoist himself up on his hands, one on each of Steve’s (warm, always so goddamn warm) shoulders.
“I told you, I love making you come. It makes me feel good about myself.”
“Aren’t you the one who reached out to her to set her up with him for his birthday?”
Tony kissed and sucked his way down Steve’s body and just as he reached his neglected cock, he shot back up again, wrenching a frustrated moan out of the blonde.
“I told you to pick those up before we left for the party,” came a muffled voice from his left.
“Oh no,” he panted. “You get to keep making noise. You keep,
“Right,” came Steve’s dry reply, and Tony yelped as a strong hand suddenly grabbed him by the back of his shirt – and where on earth had his jacket disappeared to? He was pretty sure he had gone to the party with a jacket and a silk vest and tie – and hauled him onto the bed which was actually far closer than Tony had anticipated in his blind journey across the floor. “Here, I might as well save you from breaking your nose on that expensive bed frame of yours.”
. And his second thought had been:
“Do you even know where to buy lube?” The hilarious image of Steve, in full Captain America gear, startling a pharmacy cashier by dropping a shopping cart filled with lube flashed before his eyes, and Tony was about to open his mouth and beg Steve to let him come with him so he could record the whole thing when he was suddenly flipped on his stomach, his face pressed into the pillows: “Woah. Hey, what are we– oh
“It’s alright, Tony. We can– ”
“I’m not going to get inside,” Steve finally said, and it took Tony a few seconds for his thoughts to gather and register was he was saying. “I’m just going to try and…” The slow drag of his dick up and down the cleft of Tony’s ass felt like a sucker punch, like every single one of his nerve endings was on fire under his skin, like being zapped after touching the wrong wires in his suit, “get things going for you. Alright?”
“I love you. Now get down there.
Here was the thing: being born an omega, male, female or otherwise, meant going through puberty knowing that you would be regularly at the receiving end of things – dicks, fingers, tongues, sextoys, didn’t matter. It was sort of expected that in the pyramid of sexual activities, omegas were at the bottom, alphas at the top and betas, the lucky sons of bitches, happily swimming in the middle. Now, Tony was a child of the seventies and had spent his adolescence woefully unsupervised and thousands of miles away from any kind of authority figure, so he had done the whole sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll shtick. He had topped, he had bottomed, he had done both at the same time, had cruised through alphas, betas and omegas like they were tasting samples at Costco, males and females alike. But no matter how wild or kinky his partners had been, there had always been this underlying message that everyone had understood even if none of the liberal, alcohol-soaked, drug-addled people he had sex with would willingly admit aloud: omegas were meant to be fucked and alphas were meant to do the fucking. Switching once in a while was okay, and even encouraged so that everyone could have a good time, but it was just that: once in a while. And Tony had never been one to disagree with that. Some of the most intense orgasms of his life had come from Pepper riding him, riding his dick, riding his face, her delicately manicured fingers digging relentlessly into his scalp as she fucked him, her clean alpha scent – fresh laundry and lavender and hot summers in Provence – making the wild gears in his brains come to a halt. He wasn’t the one who wanted to topple the whole socio-sexual order of the world.
“I was actually hoping we could talk for a moment.” He made a gesture for Tony to join him on the couch and sat back down.
Steve said nothing, but walked over to the play place. Tony looked around. The plastic tubes and slides and nets connected in a colorful mix, the largest slide dropping its rider into the big ball pit.
Tony looked confused. “Um, that’s because we . . . are on a date?”
“Yes, Tony, that felt so good. Thank you so much!”
They continued around the room, hanging bows and garland, stockings on the wall and big snowflakes on the windows.
“You asked me on a date?”
And then having the team torn apart again, scattered across time and space, only to then be tossed into the chaos of Battleworld.
“Yes, Director Fury,” all four students answered in unison.
He turned around and saw a beautiful strawberry ricotta cheesecake on a pedestal and realized it looked familiar.
“Enjoying myself? Tony, this is so nice. Do you know how long I’ve wanted to go on a date with you to a museum?”
“Tsum tsum tsum!” the tsums all replied, some happily beginning to bite into the pizza.
“Tsum tsum!”
Tony looked at the several course meal in front of them. “You should feel accomplished, look at this spread.”
of lying, but sure, I can help you.”
“Right now?”
“It’s okay, Tony. Let go, I’ve got you.” Tony spilled over Steve’s hand, a sensation that caused Steve to finish inside Tony a few thrusts later. Tony pulled Steve in for a deep kiss until Steve pulled out and rolled over to Tony’s side, both men completely spent. They took a moment to just enjoy the other’s presence, until Steve pulled Tony up to clean them both off.
“Oh, I wasn’t planning on asking -”
That was in the past, and as an adult, Steve completely understood where his mother had been coming from. He didn’t hold it against her - she had just been looking out for her little boy. And after literally being on ice for years, he guessed she was right to be wary of the cold.
Tony immediately jumped up and ran outside, too angry in the moment to finish asking Steve on a date. After several minutes of yelling - something along the lines of “
“I’m good, moving in closer to engage.”
Finally getting to rest felt amazing. The next morning absolutely did not.
Tony felt like he was going to vibrate out of his skin from nerves.
Tony entered the room with a small, quiet knock. Steve was happy to see Tony, but was immediately thrown off by the odd look on Tony’s face.
Tony took a breath. “Okay. So, would you want to go with me? Like together? As -”
Nat looked at Tony, grabbed a bag of chips from a cabinet and turned to go back to the couch. “What? Don’t give me that look. It’s actually a pretty entertaining show.”
“Oh, Steve, don’t -”
The thoughts casually grew to imagining what a date with Tony would be like - dancing, holding hands, and even their first kiss.
Tony noticed that Steve was dressed up, a collared shirt that showed off his waist very well with ironed slacks and shoes.
Steve let out an affirmative huff.
“Why do they look like us, Steve?”
Tony guided Steve outside to a large shed in the back, where he pulled out a large tire and rolled it to the edge of the hill that led down to the lake below.
“Thank you, Director Fury.”
“Tsum.”
They continued the walk back to Stark Tower in silence, which Steve decided to break.
“Tony, this feels great.”
“Are you sure you don’t mind me tagging along on your vacation?” Tony asked.
Tony caught Steve as he fell back down. “I’ve got you, I’ve got you.” Tony pulled Steve in for warmth. “Are you okay?”
A few months prior, Tony couldn’t have imagined having such a nice day like this, when they had been at each other’s throats working together for the first time. Sure, Steve was still shy, and a little reserved, but Tony enjoyed chatting about what old New York used to be like, and talking about the City’s history that Steve missed. Without the stress of the world ending, and the pressure of meeting for the first time, it turned out Steve was actually really easy to talk to.
Tony looked at the beautiful color filling Steve’s cheeks as he took one hand to cup Steve’s face. Steve looked into Tony’s eyes and was absorbed by how they sparkled in the moonlight.
Steve felt a small blush spread as the doctor left. With his room door open he could hear a small commotion as Nat was the first to run into the room.
“Jarvis, keep scanning that one. Is he okay, can he even eat that?”
“Tsum tsum tsum.”
The quad was decently filled; a few students here and there looking over textbooks in groups. Two students were practicing fight training as another girl looked over flash cards. A boy nearby had sparkles coming out of his hands, which Tony assumed to be a spell of some sort. A couple cuddled under a large tree, and a few students were laying in the grass like Tony and Jan were, just appreciating the nice day.
Steve looked at Tony, his soft gaze of admiration making Tony’s heart skip a beat. “Okay, Tony,” Steve said, taking a moment to breathe, “I need to know. Do you want to keep going?”
Steve laughed, and realized that this time with Tony had been the most relaxed he had been in months. He allowed his thoughts to wander, thinking about what it would be like to cuddle with Tony on the couch Christmas morning, hot chocolate in hand and watching snow fall over the city.
Once again, a question that seemed innocent enough. If Tony was planning a trip, he would need to know how many people were going, right?
, Jan. I can’t get a hold of this, this bundle of feelings, it’s just so wild and delicate and it makes me feel like I’m always about to combust and I don’t know how to deal with that. And if I do ask? And he says no? Or it doesn’t work out? I - I wouldn’t -”
Tony broke away first, beginning to look and fuss over Steve. “Steve, Steve, are you okay? Are you hurt?”
“Nuh-uh. Bad concussion. You’re not going anywhere.”
A small blush went across Steve’s cheeks. “Would you like to go to dinner with me?”
It was cheesy, Tony knew, but he couldn’t deny the tingle of excitement when the delivery of scrapbooking supplies arrived. Paper, stickers, labels, markers and pens, colorful tape. If Tony Stark was going to do something, he wasn’t going to half-ass it. Nor was he going to pass off the assembly of the scrapbook to a professional - this was too personal, and even with all the instructions in the world no one was going to be able to capture what these memories had meant to Tony more than Tony himself.
“You what?”
“And where was Steve?”
almost lost you and could lose you again - it blinds your judgment.”
“Steve!”
He picked up heat signatures of about thirty to forty people, but couldn’t see anyone.
“Steve?”
“Seriously, if Fury wants me to go over this new tech and check for bugs, I’ll do it. I don’t know where he’s getting his stuff from but mine is probably better.”
Once they pulled apart, Tony said, “I know we said we should go slow, but we don’t have to go
“Exactly.”
a date. Just a hang out. Then see how he reacts and we can go from there. For the record, I
“Wait, Tony -”
Steve immediately felt a little out of place. A few girls sent Steve flirty smiles in his direction as they entered.
Steve was currently covering his head with his shield as bits of rock and concrete pinged off the shield. He could hear the roar of the beam continuing to cut through the exterior walls of the campus.
“Tony, what are you -”
“Okay, we can get up early tomorrow and make a decision.”
Tony flashed a mischievous smile. “Maybe. But we’ll be here all night waiting for these little guys to crawl over here themselves. Hop to it. I’ll go get the other one.”
Steve had so much fun, but as the afternoon went on he felt that pit in his stomach grow more and more. That as much as he was enjoying himself, and loving the time with Tony, he wished that this outing meant something more.
Looking back was human, regular Steve. Just himself.
Tony smiled and they both laughed, slightly easing Steve’s nerves.
Steve was in stunned silence for a moment. Tony looked a little confused, maybe even a little hurt. Steve immediately felt bad.
“Seriously, there’s no need to be embarrassed,” Tony said, cupping Steve’s face. “I’m glad you also wanted this to be a date too. See? We’re already on the same page.”
“Steve?”
“Oh he’s always been like this, Sam. Even in the 40’s. Enjoys going to dances and never bothers to ask anyone to dance,” Bucky said. “What? Prove me wrong.” He said after seeing Steve frown.
Nat had a point.
“Tony, are you alright?!” Steve asked, afraid.
“It’s okay, Tony. I’m here, I’m alright.”
Tony was in shock at what he was hearing.
The TV played the morning’s news, as Sam, Clint and Nat watched and ate their various breakfasts. Tony was preparing himself a cup of coffee as Steve walked in.
Meanwhile, Steve could hear footsteps surrounding him but still couldn’t see his enemies. The smoke was covering the source of the beam but it wasn’t enough to cover the ground. He should, at the very least, be able to see the legs and feet of whoever was around him.
“Morning, Pepper! What’s going on here?”
“What are they doing?” Steve asked, confused.
Steve let out a small whimper.
“And if you want to do that, that’s totally fine, but if there’s something I did I’d like to know so I -”
“Morning.”
“Bad - bad dream. Dreamt about Battleworld again. Being lost, in the desert, looking through pyramids - I -” Tony mumbled quickly.
“Of course - of course. I don’t - yeah, it was pretty scary. I’m . . .  I’m glad you’re okay.”
“Tony, what’s wrong? You can tell me anything.” Steve stared back at Tony - into Tony, and Tony felt his heart break.
Sure, winter was great. But winter in a city like New York just got to be a little too much, sometimes. So that’s what prompted Steve to ask Tony about winter getaways as they finished another training session. Even Captain America needed a change in scenery once in a while.
“Good night, Steve.”
, Steve’s tsum replied, hopping off the bed quickly to go find his human.
I can’t believe I didn’t realize this was a date,” Steve moaned as he shook his head.
“What are you planning to do, Steve? Steve?” Tony asked, to no response.
Tony didn’t know how to proceed. He couldn’t see his enemy, and he couldn’t even do a barrage attack because Steve was now mixed in there among the smoke.
The truth is Tony
Steve loved how easy it was to talk to Tony. Despite how different they were, there was always something Steve could learn from Tony, and he loved how Tony lit up when he spoke about something that mattered to him. Steve laughed to himself, thinking about how unfortunate it was his eyes needed to stay on the road and not on Tony.
“Security system? But he’s got me, what more of a security system does he need?” Tony asked with a wink.
“Oh no, Tony.” Steve quickly sat on the bed besides Tony. “Can I get you anything, Tony? Do you want me to call the medical wing? Do you need water? Are you feeling nauseous? You need a cold towel? Can I get you some medicine? Are you feeling hot? Chilly? Do you want the windows open? Is it too cold in here? Do you need tissues? Can -”
"I am sorry for the destruction that was wrought to your Tower, and to this city," Thor said solemnly.
"Captain Rogers," Jarvis interrupted suddenly. "I must insist that you immediately make your way to the Seventy-Eighth floor." Bruce and Steve exchanged looks. Then Steve's eyes widened. That was the floor Julie and Wade lived on.
“-and Mary said that at Peter’s last eye appointment, the Doc said that he might need glasses in another year or so.” Pepper’s mouth made a little ‘o’ shape and she nodded.
“I love you, too,” Steve responded, his lips pressing to Tony’s forehead. Bruce had moved from the couch, and was piling the pillows in one place for Tony. Steve acted his pillow, not letting go of Tony.
"Steve," Bruce said, trying to slightly diffuse the situation. "Tell me none of this smells funky to you?"
"I don't need it, though. I have a roof over my head with working heat and running water, I'm good."
“There’s still so much room to mess up though,” Tony told her. “I don’t know how I’ve lasted this long, honestly. It’s probably because there’s still people here to help me with him. I’m really not sure how you manage to do it, manage to be a full-time parent all the time.”
"You're getting cranky," Steve commented.
Steve took Tony's hand, wrapping his fingers around it and started to kiss every knuckle. "And this is something that I shouldn't even want, because it goes against my very nature," Tony continued, voice softer, watching Steve's mouth. "This cuddling, and little gestures, something that should make me uncomfortable, but then it's paired with your absolutely stubbornness. And there's a fire that thrives inside of you, and I'm like a moth attracted to a very good-looking flame. And I'm rambling, and you're not stopping me."
Steve felt his hackles raising. "I'm sorry, isn't everything?" Steve turned to face Tony full on. The two looked at each other, the others still fighting in the background.
Steve did. Thought back to when he had just met Tony, in those glasses and hat, picking up Peter. When he saw him outside of Peter's school when he had to keep a low profile. How Peter would tell Steve about what he was going to do with his Dad, or what they had already done that weekend. Peter adored Tony, said that his Daddy would never let him down, that he was always there. Mary said it, too. She admitted that Tony spoiled Peter a bit, but Steve wasn't sure that the term meant the same now as it did when he was a kid. Peter was always respectful, said please and thank you, did talk over adults, very much, unless he was really excited. Mary had never really had to punish Peter, except when he would get in trouble for being gone to long with Wade on an adventure, but even afterwards she would smile fondly at Steve, tell him that she was glad he had such a loyal friend.
“She’s a sucker for being held,” Meg informed. “And socks. She likes socks, and feet.”
Bruce let out a little sigh and shook his head. "I'm separating the DNA from the other chemicals right now. Once I can do that I can run the compounds of the serum, and run the DNA through CODIS, and other international DNA databases."
"What's wrong with his arm?" Steve frowned. Was it some kind of new weapon?
Tony slowly pulled one arm away from Steve, rolling gently onto his back. As Tony reached for his phone, still in his pocket, he thought that for once, the blonde wasn't up before the crack of-
"Steve was there," Mary interrupted him, and he snapped his mouth closed. "Steve was at the same battle you were. He's not a delicate flower, someone whose innocence needs to be preserved. He fought through a good chunk of the Second World War, and battled against things that no other soldier had too, or should have had too."
"Steve's a big boy who can last a little longer than you can," Tony told her, Jarvis trailing the call through the speakers as he ran to one of his suits. "J, can you get into the cameras where she's at?"
"Shut up!" Tony growled. He knew his shout would probably have drawn the attention of Thor. "I ever hear of you getting anywhere close to Earth after this, expect to see me. It will be the last thing that you see," Tony promised. The door was opened by Thor and Tony turned, stepping through. "Thanks, big guy," Tony said as he walked down the hall without so much as a glance back. That business was done with. For now.
Tony hummed. "Kissing you outside of the gym wasn't enough? Now you want me to actually use your name? Next you're going to tell me that you want to go out on a
“Cinderella’s way overrated,” Wade declared, the shoved a huge bite of chimichanga in his mouth.
“I’m gonna show you how Brooklyn Boys play,” Steve responded with all the confidence of Captain America, and the cockiness of Steve Rogers. Rhodey grinned, accepting the obvious challenge.

"I'm not a morning person," Tony piped up. "I just usually happen to be awake in the morning because I haven't gone to sleep."
"We have to tell the others, Tony," Bruce told him.
Tony pulled out his phone, brought up a list, then pointed in a direction. "We'll head that way first. Better grab one of the flatbed carts." Steve nodded and Tony pat his back, smiling. "Only have to do the big shop only once. The rest is just to buy way too many clothes, and restock on supplies."
"Sir is in the workshop," the AI dutifully answered. "Shall I take you there?"
"We can do it," Peter proclaimed.
"That's how you start a conversation?" Tony raised an eyebrow, hand twitching towards his watch again. "No, 'Sorry I tried to kill you?'"
"Did you come all the way out here to tell me that?" Steve's fingers rubbed along Tony's knuckles. Tony's body always ran a bit warmer, thanks to the arc reactor, and Steve always tried to drink that in whenever he could. Tony shook his head a little and Steve shifted a little.
"I was so hoping you would try something." Tony turns a glare up at the man that is standing over him. "Come now, I will give you a tour of where you will be working from now on. Hydra is pleased to welcome you to our ranks."
"Yeah, I know, I heard all about it." Tony had donated to the clean up, and subsequently kept military eyes off of Bruce long enough for him to make his escape. Brice didn't need to know that though. "I can get you in without anyone seeing, and I've got a place for you to stay where no one will even suspect you to be."
"Hey, don't tell
“You’ll not touch my sacred stash.”
“You’d better start explaining right now,” Steve said, not moving from his position.
Peter let out a gasp, then ran inside the room, pulling himself up on the end of the bed. "Phil!!" He could see that the man was still injured, so he was careful, but insistent on crawling up the bed. The older man wrapped his arms around the boy, smiling.
“You gotta blow out the candles, baby girl.” Steve mimicked blowing, pursing his lips, waiting for the one year old to follow suit. She had seen Peter, and Tony, blow out some candles, and she squealed now that she knew it was her turn. She started to blow as well as she could, Steve secretly helping her out. She clapped, eyes big, and looked at Steve. “You did it!”
"So, she hasn't calmed down then." Steve felt bad for Tony. He shouldn't judge, but the only interactions he's had with the woman were her putting down Tony. Steve had already done that, and he felt bad about it, Tony didn't need that from the Grandmother of his son.
"You haven't found the pool yet?" Tony asked, then shook his head a little. He pat Steve's arm, pushing a little to get him out of the door frame. Steve moved and followed Tony when he walked down the hallway, past the foyer, and then towards the back of the mansion. The passed the door that would lead out to the garden and Tony took a right. Steve caught the distinct smell of chlorine and wondered how he had missed this before. There was a glass door and Steve saw tiled floor and lounge chairs. Tony tapped a panel on the wall next to the door, and the door clicked open. He pushed the door open and Steve stepped inside, blinking. The pool had to be almost olympic sized, complete with a shallow end, and a deep end that went down fifteen feet. Two jacuzzi's sat against the wall furthest from the door, and there were other chairs, loungers, and tables sitting along the walls. The room was cool, not too warm or muggy, and when Steve walked over, crouching down to put a hand in the water, he felt the water was the perfect temperature.
"Still your son, though," Steve said gently."He still talks about you all the time, says he had fun with you last week, until you guys had to come home." Tony nodded but didn't anything, but Steve didn't feel as much tension rolling off of the man as before.
“I’m not really sure,” Steve told him honestly. “You and Peter might change schools, but nothing’s certain.” He glanced down at Wade, hand coming up to gently rub the side of his head, pushing some hair back. “You and your mom should be safer now, but Todd will still be around.” Wade nodded a little.
"Sir?" Jarvis asked through the internal mics.
“Toblerone is a candy bar,” Meg explained to the two Super Soldiers. “It’s a lot better than the mass produced ones you can find at any gas station.”
"Yeah!" Peter unbuckled from his booster seat as Tony got out of the front seat. He opened the back door and Peter hopped out, almost vibrating with excitement. Tony took Peter's hand and they headed for the large museum. It was a weekday, and it was early in the day, so there weren't as many people at the museum, just how Tony had hoped it would be.
Tony needed to get out of this room. He needed to end this, he needed to make things safe for Peter, for Mary. "I can get there faster."
"Awesome!" Wade arm-pumped, and Peter smiled brightly at Steve.
"There were teams??" Tony shouted with exaggeration.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Uh, thanks," Tony said, and Steve blinked. "For keeping an eye out for Peter, you know, when I can't." Tony shrugged a little, put his hands in his pockets, and walked off down the sidewalk, already crossing the street by the time Steve had gotten to his feet. He could see the man was having a hard time dealing with unable to be with his son, and Steve felt for the man. He didn't know how he would be able to deal with it if he was in the same position. If Steve had had a kid when he was still Captain America, and in the spotlight. He wouldn't want them to know about his son or daughter, to keep them safe, but he was also making some frightening enemies at the time too, and he wouldn't put his family in danger.
"Non-lethal, uh," she waved her hand a little as she thought, searching for a word. "Reconnaissance only. We need to know where he is, and if he sent the shooter after Julie and, or, Wade." Steve tilted his head a little at her, silently asking what she was up, too.
"Is your bed big?" Peter asked, innocent brown eyes looking up at him.
"You're in New York," Steve started softly. "In your Tower, down in your workshop." Tony could feel his hand starting to shake. "It's almost two in the morning, and Peter is fast asleep upstairs on your floor." Steve flattened Tony's hand against his chest. "Follow my breathing, nice and easy, match it up."
“Isn’t it adorable??” Tony crowed.
“Which room, Daddy?” Peter said when he got to the end of the hall, looking between two wooden doors on either side of him. Tony pointed to the right, and he turned to read the sign then his eyes widened. “Awesome!”
"It's almost nine in the morning, Tony," she told him. The engineer blinked a little, unaware that that much time had actually passed. "After last night-"
So he found himself, slipping out of their apartment, (with a note on his Mom’s forehead, telling her where he was going, he didn’t want to worry her), and sneaking down the hallway. His destination wasn’t far away, in fact it was on the same floor. He was on a mission, to go to Miss Meg’s floor, and sneak up on her roommate. Miss Meg had of course told him that he was welcome to come over whenever he liked, so long as the door was unlocked. Wade figured that Jarvis was in charge of the locks by the way he had overheard Dr Bruce talking with the scary red-headed Avenger. She hadn’t been too keen on them for some reason, even though Peter and Wade enjoyed spending time in Miss Meg’s apartment when their parents were busy.
“There’s uh, there’s a dirty joke in, in there.” Tony’s words were a little jumbled as he closed his eyes, letting Steve do most of the leading. “M’head.”
"I don't know where the hell I'm going," she said quickly. "I'm from Michigan, not even one of the big cities! We're asshole drivers, not experts on traffic. I barely know my way around Philadelphia yet!"
Steve let out a frustrated huff, hiding his worry for seeing Tony like this. This was the last thing that either of them had expected. But being fair, neither of them had probably expected anything. Steve almost startled when Strange pulled his hands back from Tony.
“Yeah?” Steve asked, letting out a little chuckle. “Guess we’ll see if you’re right, huh?” He lifted the bags a little, then turned to head for the stairs. “I’m putting these in the room, maybe you can make us something for lunch?”
"When can you put a blanket or pillow in?" Steve asked as he walked over to the crib that must have been brought in while he was taking a shower.
"Because I feel lonely." Tony's words were so soft that Mary almost missed them. "Fuck." He got back up to his feet, keeping his back to Mary. She stood up, watching him, but didn't move. "This is what I didn't want!" He shouted, more aimed at himself. "I didn't want this, didn't want any confusion! Didn't want feelings getting involved." Tony growled a little and shook his head. "I need to keep things how they are, because I have it all worked out. I have plans set in place to keep people safe, and not pulled into any of my bullshit, at least more than they have, too. It works that way, it's always worked that way."
"Is there something that I'm going to miss?" Tony asked her, looking away from Bruce.
"Nah, yours are better." Tony glanced down at the sleeping girl.
“Yes, well, it seems a lot of things have changed for both of us.”
"I can't tell if you actually need to look, if you're just coming up with an excuse to check me out." Steve gave Tony a cheeky smirk and Tony's mouth almost dropped open a little.
Mary looked at Tony, raising an eyebrow. “Don’t give me that look,” Tony pointed at her, then grabbed the handle of Peter’s luggage. “Alright, kiddo, grab your bag. Mr Steve and Jamie are waiting for us in the garage. If we leave soon then we can grab dinner at the hotel.”
This chapter is a lot later than I would have liked, but I ran into some tough family health issues this weekend, and it's still not over. I'm a caretaker for my mother, (much too young, for either of us), and there's a lot of tough decisions up ahead. But, this story, and knowing that so many people love it, is a nice escape for me to get back, too. I'm in love with the characters, I love watching them grow, and helping them grow, because I think that's what's supposed to happen in a long, involved, story such as this one is shaping up to be.
"Why would you need to talk to Mary about this? Steve would be the one leaving-"
"Daddy?" Tony jumped, and looked at Peter as he leaned up on the stool that was across from the frosting station that had been set up. "Can we make a Cap cupcake for Mr Steve, too?"
Tony tapped at Steve’s hand with his fingers, and his head whipped over to look at him. His other hand was resting on his chest, over his arc reactor, his eyes were nearly closed, but he was looking at Steve, he was back. The blonde leaned down, dropping a kiss on his forehead, brushing back some sweat soaked hair. When had that happened, Steve wondered.
“I told him the two of us had therapists, but no one would be mad if he turned it down.” Steve crawled into bed, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him a little closer.
Tony moved the tablet when little arms started to slide down from the bed, and down Tony's chest. He looked up, raising an eyebrow. Peter smiled at him, half off the bed, upside down. "What are you doing? You're like a spider."
Also, can you imagine the fanart of Tony and Steve posing with their actor counterparts??
"Whose is it?" Steve asked as Tony stepped back to head for one of the empty rooms.
"What, do you just want everyone to live with us now?" Tony teased. "Next you're gonna say that Grandma and Granpa should live with us-"
Tony started to shake his head, lifting a hand to stop Steve. “No, it’s fine. It really is. I was more or less surprised that they went with you…. I’ve never taken them to go see her, because I don’t want anyone accidentally seeing them with me,” Tony admitted. He leaned against one of the counters, crossing his arms across his chest. “There are only 7 people who know about them, and sometimes I feel that number is too big. I know they could take care of themselves, but I don’t want to put them in danger just because of who I am.” Tony rubbed one of his arms, and Steve could sense there was more, that Tony was keeping something to himself. “Aunt Peggy knew about them, but I just hadn’t gotten them to meet her yet. I’m glad they went with you, though. I really am.”
“One day, he will take revenge for that nickname,” Steve murmured, closing his eyes.
“Little Bit?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow.
Bruce smiled at Tony, watching him go on about Peter. Tony stopped and looked at the other scientist. "What?"
"All the stuff from the past," Peter told him, watching all the people walking into the doors of the museum. "Everything that already happened, that we want to remember."
Tony was paying for the picture, arranging for it to be sent to their room when Peter and Steve came out. Peter had the biggest grin on his face, and Steve’s face looked a little pale, hair disheveled. Tony grinned at them, Peter running over to hug Tony.
"Daddy picked me up while Mama did the boring food shopping," Peter proclaimed, smiling at Steve. "We got matching haircuts!"
The door to Mary’s bedroom was indeed open, and she was sitting up in the bed, awake, and smiling. Jarvis must have told her he was coming, because she looked like she was expecting him. “Steven Rogers, how dare you not be in the city to greet me when I wake up.” Steve smiled at her and took a few big steps to reach her bed, leaning in to hug her.
Tony had never cooked a chimichanga in his life, but Jarvis assured him that it was something even he could do. He didn't trust his AI's assessment. He looked at the frosting selections that he and Peter had picked out; a lot of red, some black, white, and some blue. Apparently Wade really liked red and black, and Tony thought that he could make a red, white, and blue cupcake for Peter.
"I got some fear," Wade countered. "Just a little bit though. I like trying new things, it's fun!"
"You're in there, though, I know it." Steve walked closer to him, stopping just before his touched the couch. "If you were the weapon that Hydra was using you to be, you wouldn't be here right now. You wouldn't being protecting those three," he motioned back towards the bedroom.
"Watch out!" Yinsen called out to him, voice weak, but audible in the suit. Tony stopped short then leaned back when he heard the projectile headed right for him. It hit the wall and Tony put his arm out, opening a panel in the arm, arming his own little missile, and firing right away. Silence, the man went down.
“Do you think that’ll stay like that? Or taper off eventually?” Tony glanced over to Bruce.
He squeezed Steve's hand once before he was pushing himself up again, brushing away Steve's other hand that tried to stop him. "I have to- Downstairs- I've got his stuff." Tony managed to get his feet on the ground and stood up. He wobbled for a second before he started walking. "In my workshop, I've got the shooter's stuff. I need to go through it, need to know why."
"I've got something special to show you, little man," Tony said, adjusting Peter in his arms. The boy was growing quickly, and soon he wouldn't be able to hold him like this for long, but Tony would keep doing it as long as he could. "Only one other person knows about this, and that's Rhodey. You remember, Rhodey right?" Peter nodded, sitting up a little in Tony's arms.
"But I am," she whispered back.
"Oh my god," he whispered. "Do you know what stage this is in?" He asked, finally tearing his eyes away to look at Bruce. The older man shook his head, but the look in Tony's eyes knew he hadn't misinterpreted the findings.
"Oh, this should be good." Tony opened the file, seeing only two songs there so far. "What the- Pocketful of Sunshine and I Want It That Way?? Jarvis, vitals! I'm not having a stroke am I?"
"That's not what I meant, Tony." Steve put his hands up in front of his chest a little. "I know you've kept Peter out of the press, and I'm just hoping that this man isn't stupid enough to say anything just because he wants a little attention."
Tony had pretended to be asleep when he felt Peter wake up in the morning. After dinner Tony had made sure to take Peter to his bedroom to sleep, once again staying next to Peter the whole night. Peter had a routine on birthdays, and Bruce had promised to help him make the blueberry pancakes for Tony in the morning. So when ten minutes previous Tony felt Peter waking up, he had closed his eyes, relaxed his body, (hiding his tablet), as Peter carefully climbed down from the bed, and wandered off to the kitchen.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Or Tony," Mary threw in.
"You've got one more drone incoming," Natasha's voice came back over their coms suddenly. Tony noted that she sounded different. "This one looks different. It's the last one though, you're on your own boys." The transmission was cut and tony frowned.
Steve kissed the top of her head. “Your hair is almost long enough to start doing something with. You’re growing fast, baby girl. Mary was right, I’m buying you clothes left and right.” He didn’t know what exactly was happening, why he kept talking, but it seemed to help calm him, and Jamie liked to hear the sound of his voice, especially when she was tired. “Well, probably more of them online, with Jarvis’ help. Hard to go outside and not be recognized lately. And with all the trouble we’ve had lately,…. Well, it’s going to get better, you’ll see.” He took a breath, nodding a little to himself, and turned around himself. “We can go out, see Peter and Wade now.” She cooed a little and Steve smiled. “Yeah, it’s going to be real interesting the older you get, with them teaching you. Real interesting.” He kissed the top of her head again.
Tony heard it all - “don’t be scared!”, “he’s nice!”, “he’s sweet!” - but that didn’t change how strongly Tony felt about Steve, and how scared it made him to feel that way.
He peered into the water and sure enough, the face of a fuzzy brown wolf stared back at him, yellow eyes shining brightly in the night. In a moment where Steve thought he should be panicking, he found himself to be calm. The pieces of the past couple months clicked together, it wasn’t all in his head.
“Huh?” Tony asked, slightly jumping by surprise.
“Anywhere.”
Tony’s head was still pounding as he covered his face with one hand. “Oh god, then what?”
“What do you mean?”
“Stark! Rogers!” Director Fury shouted from a distance. He made his way through the rubble and let out a huge sigh of relief when he found Tony and Steve sitting together among the wreckage.
Tony took the supplies to his bedroom, spread them all out on the floor and jumped up to grab a box from his closet. A old hat box, handled with care, Tony carried it over to his pile of supplies and opened the lid.
Steve jumped out of bed, and opened the door to the main living area. Tony was awake, already dressed and quietly sipping coffee at the dining room table.
“Are either of you hurt?”
After a moment, Tony leaned up, closing the gap between them to softly kiss Steve on the lips. The kiss was warm and tender, and Steve immediately pulled Tony back in for another. Steve’s hands moved down to wrap around Tony’s waist, making Tony’s body flush with his. Tony was now seated on Steve’s lap, his thighs slightly squeezing on Steve’s hips.
“Oh, they already know, they’re just arguing in the waiting area right now about who can see you first. I’ll send someone in on my way out,” the doctor replied.
“Any idea what you might want for Christmas?” Tony asked. “I know we usually do Secret Santa but after a year like this I’m getting multiple gifts for everyone anyway.”
“Why didn’t you say anything, Tony?”
“Fine.” Steve jumped up and made his way over to the bar, moving past some students and taking some deep breaths to let go of some the frustration he had with his friends before he spoke to Tony.
“Yeah, still pulling fire from the tank. Why?”
The doors first opened to Steve’s apartment, but Steve continued the kiss as the doors closed and the elevator continued up to Tony’s suite.
“Just thinking about work. We’ve got a few new products launching soon, a new foundation to help support education starting up, and of course, uh - well the gala.”
“He said bedrest. Never said
“What about you? Any requests?”
It should be impossible. But I should know better, that the impossible is absolutely possible with this crew. And I’m sorry I didn’t speak up sooner. But the thought that something was happening to you, that we almost lost you - that
“Are you sure? Because I don’t want you to feel like we have to go public if you’re not -”
want to come with me, I'd love to have you. Uh, come with me. Come along with me.” Steve blushed some more as Tony smirked, a naughty thought clearly passing through his head as Steve realized how vaguely suggestive that just sounded.
But Tony grew quiet instead, looking down at the ground and not saying another word. As far as Steve was concerned, that was all the confirmation he needed to know that Tony wasn’t interested. A little tied up in his own feelings, Steve continued to work quietly until it was time to leave, and he didn’t waste any time exiting Stark Tower.
“Well I know I’ll recover quickly with a team of nurses like you three to help out.” Tony reached out and pulled the tsums in for a hug, and patted the bedside next to him so Steve could cuddle with him, a request Steve readily followed. Tony slowly began to rest, feeling better already, knowing he was so cared for.
“Yes! All of that sounds great!”
“He’s not going to say no. He’s clearly into you.”
The house itself was open plan, with the majority of the space dedicated to the kitchen and living room. In the living room, a big flat-screen television was next to a large fireplace surrounded by comfy couches. There was a beautiful wood dining table to the side. The kitchen had even fancier appliances than the one back at the tower and included a wine fridge, marble countertops on top of forest green cabinets. Other open live edge wood shelves lined the wall of the kitchen.
It had been the Saturday before Valentine’s Day. Jan was throwing a singles mixer at Club A.
“Feel better?” Tony asked. He slowly blinked as he looked at Steve happily.
“Keep going? Of course, I do Steve, I - are you sure you want me?”
But up close? Steve knew all too well that if you stared at New York in the winter for too long, the ugliness began to show. Crowded stores meant annoyed shoppers, mass transit packed with riders wearing multiple layers. Too cold outside, too warm inside; the pure white snow turning into grey nasty mush after just a moment on the pavement.
Steve continued to work Tony open as Tony let out small moans in between repeating Steve’s name. When Tony was ready, Steve slicked himself up and slowly pushed into Tony, meeting Tony’s lips with a kiss as he bottomed out. Steve held himself up with one arm by Tony’s head, stealing loving glances into Tony’s eyes between kisses as Tony got adjusted.
