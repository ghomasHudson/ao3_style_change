“I don’t know,” Bobby mumbles, “he’s not bad looking. Anyways, what’s going on between you and this Cas guy? He isn’t he your brother’s butt-buddy.”
“I must have slipped and hit something,” his mother says, looking at Castiel for confirmation. He nods. She looks as uncertain as he feels.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Sam gave the impression that you have an ex that you still have to see.”
“I guarantee it,” she says, lifting her beer bottle in the air. “Hey, can I say I stayed at your place last Friday? I need an alibi for my mom.”
And Dean thought he would be a safe bet.
“Varsity soccer player,” Sam said.
Cas didn't seem to move, but was suddenly much closer. Angels. Convenient to have in your pocket.
At Dean's side in a moment, Cas shifted his armful of clothes so he could rest a hand on Dean's shoulder. No magic healing happened, but Dean did feel better. Still it was a struggle to focus on the apparently spinning blanket. Trying not to barf, he said, “You have a house?"
Cas looked straight into Dean, then he pulled him very close and whispered a question against the sensitive skin just below Dean's right ear.
“It's the angel part that's not adding up for me,” Irene said. “Also, are you the friend of Dean's that Sam told me died? The one Dean was mourning in the Antarctic?”
“More a summing up,” Dean said, starting to close the distance between them.
“You're the best angel,” Dean agreed. “But maybe we should discuss what we tell other people, before just blurting it out. Right after I make a pit stop.”
"Like I said. I'm not blind. Every time I looked at you, there it was between us...the unspoken human/angel CelestialSexual thing. But I was such a wise-ass man of the world. I thought I knew how everything worked. You were my best friend. I was your brother in arms. Guys like us, we live fast and die bloody. I knew what I saw, what I felt, well that could never be real. Not in Chuck's world.”
"Or...we could go back to hunting things..."
"It's...never mind." Dean pointed a finger at him. "So what you are saying is we can go to other universes and hunt monsters and save people. Kick the ass of some asshat personification of God and come back here afterward?"
“I told you,” Sam reminded him, “Irene has a Master's in Quantum Mechanics.” He shot a glance at Cas and added, "You look different."
“And Jack did all of this?”
Supernatural
The sound of squealing breaks, shattering glass and cursing came through the speaker and then the phone went dead.
“You can't still be angry with them. Not here.”
“Will you stop with the knowing.”
Cas held up a to-go bag from the Roadhouse. A waft of his hand turned it into a picnic with blanket, cushions and beers on ice.
The Angel only tries to enter his cell once. Dean watches as one of The Angel’s many hands grasps the door and gently pulls it open. All three pairs of wings are tucked behind it, but it is still unaccountably massive against the small door of the cell. Dean curls himself tighter, hides his face in his knees. He knows The Angel is going to hurt him, and he should be prepared to fight back, but he knows he’ll lose. His eyes squeeze shut, and he waits. He waits until he hears the door click shut behind it, until it’s just them enclosed in the cell together. He waits through its silence, and through the shuffle of its wings. He waits. When he opens his eyes, The Angel is guarding the door, looking for all the world like it had never moved.
you.” He puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder, a gesture to bring comfort if there was any skin to receive it, “They’re here to take you from me,” he drags the hand down, and Dean chokes on his cry, “They’re going to hurt you worse than I ever could. I’m almost jealous.”
Alastair’s only response is to laugh.
In all his years of hearing the angels’ language, it’s never become anything but incomprehensible to Dean. The frequency they communicate in is painful to listen to, and he can barely make out individual words among the many voices that compose an angel’s voice. But while he has no clue what The Angel is saying, he imagines it translates somewhere in the vicinity of “Fuck off”. It doesn’t close its wings until the other angel is gone, and they’re once again alone. Dean has retreated back to his corner of the cell, hands over his ears, and he can’t meet The Angel’s eyes.
Cas’ rings hum, and he turns to work on other things.
Dean turns his eyes away from Cas, “Can you take away the scars?”
Cas’ face quickly returns to neutral, and he doesn’t respond.
More than once he feels compelled to speak up, to try and initiate a conversation of some sort, but he has no idea what to say. Instead, he finds entertainment in the ever-shifting landscape of The Angel’s body. It has three heads. On its left is a raven, and on its right is a bull. Its final face, nestled between the two, is human, or so Dean thinks. The Angel refuses to turn that face towards him.
Castiel’s bull head snorts, “The last report I received, she was working with another hunter, a man named Jake Talley.”
Cas taps his chest to get his attention. It’s the same pattern as before, once firmly, then twice more gently. “Open your mouth.”
“Guess that’s that, then.”
“You should not drink so much, Dean.”
Next is his bones and blood vessels, and suddenly he’s warm again, as nerves thread their way through himself. His skull forms around his brain, which Dean knows he shouldn’t be able to feel, but somehow he can. The bones of his inner ear are dropped into place, and Dean can hear again.
Dean had been on the rack for thirty-two years when Alastair first heard it. He’d gotten off the rack for the first time almost two years prior, and had put himself right back on when they’d brought him the soul of a young girl. So it goes. Dean took apart the souls they provided him, and if he refused, he was strung up in their place.
Cas touches his hip, feather-light. It bends with the pressure, becomes that much narrower as a result.
Castiel bristles, “I cannot just create a new body. I need your consent, or it will not bind properly with your soul. And your brother is fine.”
Dean spends almost two years off the rack, learning to relish the feeling of blood on his hands. His soul corrupts in his chest, slowly, slowly. He knows that it turns even when he’s on the rack, but he can feel the light flickering when he tortures the other souls. The angels have arrived in the ring above him, and what was once heavenly music has devolved into nothing more than inhuman screaming. Off the rack, Dean feels almost ready for them. Unbound, he can cut and run, hide himself among the masses of souls awaiting torment.
“What the hell does that mean?”
The words sound sincere, but they taste sour. “Gee, thanks.” Dean tucks back into himself, “You gonna tell me I mangled it next? That my body was a temple? I’ve heard it all before, just so you know.”
“Aw, that’s a real delicate way of putting it, buddy.” For how intimate this experience has been as of yet, having Cas switch to being stilted and clinical is sort of off putting. But he’s right, Dean’s feelings are incredibly mixed on the subject.
“I will be there, watching over you. I may not make my presence known, but you won’t be alone, Dean.” Cas takes Dean’s face in two of his hands, and tilts it up. His heads spin on his shoulders until his human head is facing Dean. “When you see me next, I will be in the body of my vessel. But I promise, until then, I will be watching. I will be keeping you safe to the best of my ability.”
Torture under Alastair works like this: A soul is given a physical body mimicking their body on earth, and that body is torn apart piece by piece until it dies. The body is then restored, and passed from one of Alastair’s prodigies to another. Except in very rare cases, Alastair does none of the dirty work himself. John Winchester had been such a case, he informed Dean once. The screws in his hands and feet made it hard to care.
Neither of them speak for a while, while Dean considers.
Dean grins, “If you say so. What’s with the other one, then?”
“How does this work?”
Dean hears as well as feels Cas snap the bones of his fingers back to straight, and his curiosity gets the better of him. “Why are you having to change so much? Ain’t it all being built new?”
“Oh, that’s my solution to your not wanting your scars to be as visible. This,” his thumb tucks into the divot, “is a recreation of a surgical drain scar. They’d be present even if you had no visible incisions.”
“I hear them.”
His muscles last the longest. Each individual fiber is attached by hand, and not even Cas has so many hands that it’s a quick process. He feels them lock into place on his chest, and he tenses.
“I can hear them.” For once, Dean’s mouth is uncovered. His voice is no longer his own, marred by the gravel of a lifelong chainsmoker, or a man who’s spent the last thirty-six years screaming.
“Jesus, ease up dude. It can’t be that bad.”
It’s not that everything disappears around him, more that he’s suddenly in a sea of nothingness, interrupted only by Cas’ true form appearing in front of him. Dean has no idea how he’s seeing Cas, as he no longer has a body. He can’t see whatever it is he is now, but Cas seems entranced by it. A hand dips towards and through him, and the feeling registers in his incorporeality but in a way he cannot describe.
“Sister. Sammy’s my sister, asshole.”
And if that doesn’t just piss Dean off. “So I’m supposed to be back on earth right now, and you’ve been delaying? I don’t know if Sam has even lived this long without me, and you’ve just been keeping this from me?”
He wakes up healed, the rack in front of him.
“Angels cannot create. We can simply observe, as the world shapes itself. To take the form you were given and mould it to the correct image of yourself… is noble. Holy.”
is silent.
“You are not like most humans. I’ve told you this before, but I don’t think you understand just how true that statement is. My true form is more than just jarring, to humans. It burns the eyes out of their skulls. If there was a single human present for miles, and I delivered you to the surface instead of to where you were buried, I could cause them irreparable damage.”
Turns out Space is pretty neat, even if Dean’s love of it extends only to stargazing and Star Trek. The exhibit consists mainly of a dark room that is lit by the light of the glowing planets in the solar system. It’s cool, but the best part for Dean is watching Cas’s face light up at each display. Cas spits out trivia at the same rate that Dean makes pop culture references, and their afternoon is traced by random tidbits that Cas spurts out and the smile that Cas makes when Dean compliments him on his knowledge. It was amazing that one person could so casually toss out so much information and Dean was beginning to suspect that Castiel Novak was a bit of a nerd.
. You just
“I liked Cas even when I thought he was um…”
“Dean, are you okay?”
Castiel looks sicker by the minute. He shakes his head.
“Yeah,” Dean snorts. Typical of the FBI. They’re completely out of their league on this one. “More like whole legion of them. It’s a cult.”
Fair enough. “Fine, you can come, but this douche,” he points over to Gabriel, “isn’t welcomed to join us.”
God, it seems like forever since Dean has stayed in one place for long time. Ever since 9
Castiel scoffs at this. Gabriel is currently wearing a suit that cost more than Castiel’s monthly rent and doesn’t seem to mind if he gets flour on it or not since he outright refused the offer of an apron, stating that he didn’t want to look like “Little- Miss Betty Crocker over there”. Gabriel is irritating.
. Sam also sees out of the corner of his eyes a smug look that Cas is trying (and failing) to hide. For a few seconds it seems like it’s just Cas and Dean in the room, longingly staring at each other, and for once, Sam doesn’t mind.
“What, do you get your freak on by watching other people sleep?” Dean says gruffly, shaking Castiel from his meditative state.
Cas looks like he’s actually contemplating this, so Dean just shakes his head. “We’re
“Who the hell is this?”
“No, no- I understand.”
Castiel is sceptical about this. Every corpse he was wakes usually wake like they have fallen asleep for a few minutes before their death. Often they were confused, and fearful- just like how Dean was when Cas had brought him back. In all of Castiel’s experience there’s no such thing as Heaven or hell- Castiel has asked enough to know better. All corpses return with their last memory of being on Earth. There’s no report of seeing fluffy clouds or of the fiery pits of Hell. Except for Dean.
“It’s true! I’ve told you, the world isn’t as random as you think. There’s some cosmic order to it that even I must follow. Your mother was a victim of this world’s need to realign itself. My mother had died, Dean.”
“In Maryland?”
“Damn it Cas, I thought you were dating my brother! And I was jealous!”
“Oh, so you’re…” Dean looks to Sam, who is blushing slightly. Well this is a game-changer. Not only is his brother in love, he’s in love with a dude. Not that Dean is judging- it’s just that Dean has always been the bi one. “Actually, I have heard of you. It’s nice to finally meet you.”
series had left fans with the two brothers torn apart and about to go through hell- literally for one of them. Thanks to popular demand, I am glad to say that the series will be returning. The next collection will bring our two heroes back together and will introduce new advisory for them to fight. To talk more about this, we have the author of the series with us, Carver Edlund.”
“Than what is it? What benefit do you get from resurrecting me? I’m not that great of company. Look,” he chuckles lowly, “I’m practically useless to you.”
“Hey!”
“Please Balthazar,” Castiel protests, his face turning red again. “I’m from Illinois, we don’t talk about these things.”
Dean couldn’t believe that he was dragged to an art gallery on his day off. Usually his weekends were spent cleaning up his apartment or working on his car, generally nothing as
Incidentally, the entire reason that Sam stumbled upon this information was because Dean had insisted that Sam should take a break from anything supernatural. This meant that every document in the Batcave was off limits to Sam, which sucked because Sam had planned on spending his free time re-organizing the Men of Letters' stuff. Dean had strictly forbidden Sam from looking at even one little piece of paper that involved the supernatural and because of this, Sam was stuck in his room bored to the point that he resorted to reading the Carver Edlund e-books that Charlie had forced upon him.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean mumbles, his mind elsewhere and Sam’s pretty sure Dean is still stunned by the idea of Cas in panties.
“Um… just a couple of days ago. He told Jess about the affair- all of it. She moved out the next day.”
Castiel looks tiredly at Gabriel, who lets out a growl. “Cas, in the kitchen, alone.”
“Mainly because I like how they feel on me,” Cas says wide-eye. The sexual tension between those two is so thick that you could cut it with a butter knife, but apparently it is not as thick as Dean, who just goes “huh” and leaves the room. Sam lets out a frustrated growl. He should be made a saint for dealing with those two.
Castiel eyes his cousin suspiciously. Gabriel is famous for playing games with people, and Castiel has often been the butt of many of his pranks, but it seems kind of cruel even for Gabriel to drag out his conversation if he knew that Dean was still alive and kicking.
“Dean?”
“Like these?” Cas holds up a pair that is light pink and lace- just lace- with a little black bow at the top.
“Guys?” he asks. “You mean it was more than one person? Feds think it’s just one guy.”
“Ah, yeah, Lydia. I have a daughter with her, that’s all.”
Dean’s smile brightens even further. “Yup, was finally able to track one of his cell phones. Found it was used less than a month ago. As soon as we’re done breakfast, you and I are hitting the road.”
“Well, that’s just great,” Dean mutters, moving for an open bottle of Johnny Walker’s Red that is sitting on the table. Bobby looks disapprovingly as Dean takes a swig.
“What else can you say, Dean? That you’re sorry? That you knew that from the moment I began seeing Madison that I would end up losing my wife? I don’t need to hear it.”
“Please don’t call me that,” Sam asks with a small cough. “Not when I know what kind of… state you’re in.”
“Hate to say it, but I think once a guy raises you from the dead, your business is his.”
is what he plans on saying, but instead it comes out as “Cas-do-you-remember-all-those-years-ago-when-you-were-God-and-you-said-you-didn’t-care-about-sexual-orientation? What-did-you-mean? Like-do-you-care-that-I’m-Bi? Does-that-matter-to-you?”
“Gabriel, I’ve told you before, Frankenstein was the creator, not the monster,” Castiel says tiredly. He gives Dean a pitying look and moves across the motel room.
“So far nothing. They found him in an abandoned house yesterday- just a few miles out of town. Police are worried there’s some wild dog running around, killing folks. But there hasn’t been a sign of any animal since. I’ve sent his pictures to the higher powers. Just waiting to hear back from them. If he’s wanted for any major crimes, well, case closed.”
“He didn’t actually say all that, did he?”
“Come on, you’re not seriously scared of my mom, are you?”
Ruby looks surprised. “Sam? What do you want with Sam Winchester?”
“So you fucked it up with Castiel,” she states.
Dean does not want to talk about this with Castiel, who according to Dean’s book is still a complete stranger. Hell, he barely wants to talk about this with Sam.
“Sam is an adult,” Castiel says calmly. “He can take care of himself for a few days. Until I see an actual emergency, I will not let you leave this apartment.”
The thing about aging is that it is a natural progression, as well as a gradual process, for most. For Castiel, who has seen the beginning of man, the human life span is a remarkably short one. Dean laughs at Castiel’s observation, stating that it was easy to see life pass on a cloud, although Castiel isn’t quite sure what Dean means by that. Never before has Castiel watched the aging process firsthand, and now he finds it a slow and painful one.
“We’ll find him,” he says. Dean just glares at him and turns the car on.
“Only bad things I hope,” Crowley quips, his British accent throwing Dean off a little.
“What do you mean?” Castiel looks at him puzzled.
, it’ll take you no time at
“Why not? Did he do anything to offend you?”
“I’m sorry-”
“Whoa,” Gabriel yells out, pulling Castiel behind him. “Sorry, zombie boy, but I’m not having you drop in here. There’s health codes and stuff we have to follow. So can your angst and we’ll bring you back to the morgue so we can send you back to sleep.”
“Or just bad luck,” Dean says quietly.
“It wasn’t your fault,” he announces. “You didn’t know what you were doing. I can’t blame you for that. I’m just sorry that my mom had to die for you to learn.”
“See, it’s not just another affair, Dean. I really feel like we have this…” Sam drops eye contact with Dean, instead choosing to play with the straw wrappers on the table.
Castiel is left alone to examine the living room. Bobby has quite the collection of books, and he looks enviously at some of the 1
“Ready boys?” Jess asks, grabbing her coat from the booth.
,” Dean snaps, standing up from the couch.
Sam’s shoulders begin shaking. Sam doubles over and collapses onto the table, his entire body vibrating with laughter. He’s laughing so hard that a couple of people in the bar turn to stare at them. Dean moves further into the booth. Even Ellen, whose cleaning some glasses shoots them a concerned look.
Castiel, age twelve, had spent most of the afternoon in Old Farmer Joshua’s backfields with his cousin Gabriel. It had been a day spent looking for small critters for Cas to study (and for Gabriel to torment) before it had turned into a never-ending round of hide ‘n’ seek that Gabriel had without a doubt won. Tired, but with the endless energy that all twelve year olds seemed to have, Castiel had walked home, certain that he would return to find his mother making dinner and his father locked in his office under the guise of working on his next great America novel, but secretly drinking.
“I told you, I’m straight and I was having an affair with a
“Yeah, we got that honey.” Gabriel signals to Castiel to touch her again. “Unless you know who stuck the dog on you, it’s time for you to go back to sleep.”
“When we finish the case, I want to see Sammy and then I want you to let me die.”
“Maybe we should go outside,” Sam suggests weakly.
The poor guy looks shell-shocked- and if Dean had the time, he would understand- but right now his main priority is Sammy, not some dude he knew when he was fourteen. Plus, he doesn’t need all the extra guilt, all that faithful trust from Cas. He doesn’t need to the guy looking at him like he’s some poor sucker. He doesn’t need to be watched over.
Castiel is leaning against the doorway, his head titled up and with Dean leaning into him, kissing him at his neck. Neither of them has noticed Sam, despite the flailing that has just occurred.
“What are you doing?” Castiel asks carefully.
. He remembers how she used to invite Castiel over for pie. She never said outright what she was doing, but Dean would come home and find a pie-smeared plate always in the same location and his mother talking about how nice Cas was and why doesn’t Dean try and hang out with him more. The poor guy had a less than ideal family life, Dean remembers, and Mary just had so much love to share. She used to scold him whenever Dean joked about Castiel, always telling him there was something special about that Novak boy. Guess she was right in the end.
The girl gives Gabriel a scathing glare. “He was demon,” she says scathingly. “They both were. Right out of Hell.”
“Lilith,” he says. He can feel Castiel tense beside him. Ruby glances over to him, her eyes flicker black and she scowls.
“Why don’t you just tell us where he is? It’ll probably save all of us some time.” Bobby says, pointing to the Devil’s Trap. “Unless you have some way of waltzing out of here.”
His sleep is broken by a scream. For the few moments he’s awake, he has forgotten that there’s another body in the house and he’s startled by the scream.
If it had been any other night Dean would have received the infamous Sammy bitchface, but tonight Sam just shifts uncomfortable in his seat.
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam mumbles, opening his beer. “Do you just want to hang out and watch
“Your ex?”
There’s a moment, he thinks, where he might have his answer, but it’s gone when Cas decides to stay behind, letting Dean and Benny escape, and now Dean’s left with nothing.
“Those serial killers you and Gabriel haven been tracking, that’s where they are.”
“Yeah, I’m willing to admit when I’ve made a mistake.” Bobby looks at Dean in way that Dean just needs to spill the beans. “I like Cas,” he states.
“You haven’t talked with him for a year?” Dean yells.
“Well, lead on, Colombo,” he says, pointing Castiel to the entrance of the main exhibit.
As his foot hits the first step, he hears a cry from outside.
He would be outraged, but the guy lands another punch, catching him off guard, and Dean is on the ground before he can protest. Another blow is aimed at him and he can feel blood on his face and the air leaving his lungs. He can’t see out of one of his eyes and there’s the taste of iron in his mouth. The man starts kicking him and Dean doesn’t react, doesn’t do anything, just curls up into a ball, crying out for help. If his dad could see him now…
Bobby looks absolutely disgusted. “That just ain’t right.”
“Yes,” Castiel agrees. “They are both unusually attractive.” He can hear Dean let out an awkward cough behind him.
Dean lets out a laugh. “I guess that brings out a whole new definition of family business,” he mutters.
Bobby still looks at him suspiciously when he enters the kitchen. It must be hard for a man to let something
“You went to Chuck for advice? Seriously?” Castiel shrugs.
“This what?” Dean pushes. He knows where this is going, but he needs it confirmed by Sam himself.
“Not opening the store would also raise suspicion.”
“Yes, that’s interesting, Becky,” Castiel says, moving past her. “Excuse me.”
“Of course. We were just waiting for you,” Sam says, smiling at her before giving Dean a pointed look.
He quickly presses the ignore button and looks up to Sam and Bobby, who are both eying him suspiciously.
“Hey, I haven’t heard from him in a year.”
“Jesus, Cas, hit it. I told you it was mistake to bring a live thing in here!”
“Yeah, well the way Cas described him, I thought I could never live up to his expectations of sex. Crowley’s no threat! I mean, look at him!”
to use his abilities to make money off of the dead.
Castiel rolls his eyes at his cousin. Behind him comes the sound of the door opening and Castiel glances up to see Dean Winchester entering, wearing sunglasses and Castiel’s clothing. Next to him, looking extremely tiny and vibrating with excitement, is Becky. Dean zeros in on Castiel and moves towards them with a purpose. Castiel groans just as Dean sits across from him- right next to Gabriel. Becky has followed and is practically bouncing next to them.
“I’m not a shape-shifter,” he says, pulling Bobby’s right arm behind his back, grabbing the knife from his hand. “Alright, if I was a shapeshifter, could I do this with a silver knife?”
“So?” Castiel asks.
“No shit,” Dean mumbles with suprise, lying back on the couch. “Now, that I don’t believe.”
“Give me your best shot,” she hisses. Sam raises his arm, his other hand gripping a knife. The girl begins to cry out in pain, her eyes flickering white to yellow. Dean remembers those eyes, remembers them taunting him as his skin was sliced from his body, torn by two rabid animals, both with the same eyes, yellow and white.
Dean goes red at that. He tries saving one person from a skinwalker and all he gets is a crappy reputation. “So you heard about that?”
“Will do,” Dean nods. Castiel looks smugly and Sam doesn’t even want to know. Sam shifts awkwardly.
Lilith starts laughing. “Oh, you two. You’ve both come so far for revenge and now only thing that stopping you is yourselves. Come on Sam, finish the gig.”
Castiel rolls his eyes at his cousin’s tack, but steps forward to touch the body.
Fate has other things in mind for Castiel, for as he steps forwards he trips on his own two feet. To steady himself and before he can think, he grabs Dean’s shoulder.
He runs into the front window, and sees the hunched figure of Dean Winchester over that looks to be Mrs. Winchester.
The guy keeps kicking and Dean thinks, honestly thinks, he’s going to die here in some alleyway behind a skeevy bar, not by a monster, but by a human. But the guy grows tired and Dean is left curled up, moaning and thoroughly bruised. He’s pretty sure a rib or two is broken.
“Gabriel, I owe him-”
Dean shakes his head. “No, just monsters who deserve it. They’re things against nature- freaks.”
“Why I am still talking with you?” Dean jokes, although his voice is low and serious.
“Those are rock stars,” Gabriel laughs, lifting up an FBI badge.
“No, your boy comes up clean. Can’t find anything about anyone raising the dead by touch alone- except for Jesus, but I think it’s a safe bet that Castiel isn’t the second coming of Christ.”
Sam still a little butt-hurt, but he nods. “Yeah, just clean up after yourselves the next time,” he says, motioning to the soiled panties on the floor.
“Was he here by himself or-?”
editions that are lining the walls. Bobby and Dean return a few minutes later with Dean looking suspiciously at Castiel. They splash water on him, making him taste salt and ask him to hold out his arm. When Castiel looks to Dean, he is only given a bored ‘go-ahead’ before Bobby cuts into his arm. Bobby nods to Dean, making Dean visibly relax.
Mary Winchester’s grave never has flowers on it- his father didn’t stick around long enough to see headstone raised, let alone leave any flowers. It wasn’t until after he buried his dad that Dean even got to see where Mary was buried.
Castiel hums to pretend that he is listening as he rolls out another piecrust. Becky’s chatter has long become background noise for him. She’s a hard and dedicated worker (almost passionate), but she did have the tendency to be excited about things that Castiel rarely found of interest. He ignores her as she stands in front of the TV set, babbling about how something’s
“Dean….” Castiel says, turning away from the window where he just watched a sign welcoming them to Indiana rush past them. “Are you kidnapping me?”
“My daddy is over there,” she says pointing to a figure on the park bench that overlooked the pond. It looked to be the same one as the one he and Dean had spent the entire night on, talking until the sun had risen the next day. The figure rises quickly and begins hurrying over to Castiel’s direction.
Sure enough, a young brunette woman appears before them. Her sudden appearance gives Castiel quite a shock and Dean has to hide his grin as Castiel jumps violently back.
“Gabriel,” Castiel begins to explain when they’re safely in the back room.
“Yeah, sure does.”
“Are you okay?”
There’s no TV in the gas station, which is a relief. The man at the counter looks to be in his late 70s and he’s reading a porn magazine without even the decency to blush when the two men enter. He takes their cash for fuel and for what some regard as food without batting an eyelash.
, thinks Sam,
“Where you boys heading?” he asks them eagerly.
Gabriel is right. When Castiel returns to his apartment, he finds Dean sitting in his living room, nursing what appears to be a bottle of Jack. Dean barely gives Castiel a second glance when he enters.
“She’s not that scary,” Jo says with a laugh.
Dean might not have gotten laid that night, but he learns. He practices the word “bisexual” in the mirror, looking at himself, in his mind going over and over the term till it becomes as familiar on his tongue as the taste of greasy roadside burgers and convenience store pie.
, so you brought back a dead serial killer who is also pissed at you. I apologize. You’ve
“So the guy that killed me is still out there, harming people?” Dean asks, looking slightly red.
Dean can feel himself growing increasingly irritated as Gabriel talks. Gabriel it seems has the ability to pick up and pry into whatever makes people uncomfortable and he certainly looks like he takes pleasure out of it. Castiel says nothing beside him, sort of just standing there looking emotionless. Honestly, it freaks Dean out more than Gabriel being a jerk. When neither respond, Gabriel just shrugs, grabs a plate full of French toast and moves back to the living room. Castiel lets out a sigh and follows, leaving Dean with no choice but to trail after them.
It’s probably more than Dean deserves- the fact that Cas had let him keep talking long after the initial hellos, was a totally surprise to him. He’s done his piece, he had tried to apologize and Castiel has refused to listen. Nothing else could be done. He could try to get Sam to talk with Castiel, explain the situation to him, but it was douche-bag move to make and only cowards send their brothers in to fight their own battles. He could stop by Castiel’s apartment and try to reason with him there. The image of a door being slammed in his face was a painful one, and Dean was certain that would be the only thing that Cas would do if Dean just showed up unannounced. Right now Dean’s head is swimming with indecision and he can’t make up his mind. Maybe a drink and a talk at the Roadhouse would help him along. He decides to do just that before the tinny- sound of “Smoke on the Water” blares in his hand.
Gabriel, why do you require my service?”
And so, Dean learns to accept that some questions can never be answered, not for him anyways.
“Don’t know about the guy,” the bartender says, “She might have called him Sam a couple of times. Her name was Ruby, that’s for sure. Heard him yell at her enough,” the bartender nods before she bends behind the counter.
“That will never cease to amaze me,” Dean scoffs.
“And this Castiel guy has decided to refute any attempts you’ve made to apologize.”
“Gabriel. Have you seen the news?”
Castiel pushes on. “You see why I brought you back? I needed to ask you for forgiveness. I know that it’s impossible to ask-”
“Not from where I’m standing. Here, he overpaid, so have a free drink on him,” she says, pushing another beer bottle his direction. “You guys been together long?”
“Dean, they’re only baby ones,” Cas states. He leans against the counter, making no motion to help Dean.
Castiel’s smile drops. Dean looks instantly apologetic.
“It appears that I have. He’s been ignoring me.”
that sounds like a good idea.”
They pass the next several hours playing catch up and for a moment it feels like two old friends meeting after years of not speaking. Dean talks about Sammy and how he got into Stanford of all places, how the last time he spoke, Sam had been planning on becoming a lawyer. Life seems to be good for Sam. Dean’s, on the other, Castiel only learns about through the contrast of Sam’s. While Sam had finished school with full honours and a scholarship, Dean had to drop out. When Dean tells Castiel that he got his GED, there’s a sense of hidden pride in Dean’s voice, like the man rarely gets to talk about his accomplishments.
Even at twelve, Castiel knew that Mary Winchester was special. She is kind and sweet to everyone and almost everyone in the neighbourhood adored her. Mary seemed to know that Castiel is lacking
They drive the rest of way in silence.
it in the pot. I can’t put a live thing in hot water, Dean,” he states gravelly, his eyes widening like Dean just asked him to slaughter the Easter bunny for dinner.
“Dean,” she states in her tell-me-or-I-tell-my-mom voice.
“Hey, don’t look at me like I’m crazy, you’re the one who raises the dead. Cas, you don’t know what I’ve been through to find these sons of bitches. You think my worst crime is credit-card fraud…” Dean laughs weakly. “People have gotten hurt because of me. I have seen and done things that nobody in their right mind would do.”
“No, I just… I just have a bad association with burgers. Um… excuse me,” he says before rushing off to the bathroom.
with an ice pack on his knee. Castiel spends those days next to him, asking the odd question, but generally silent as he watches Dean watching TV. Sometimes the questions make Dean laugh, which encourages Castiel to spend his days with Dean on the couch, ignoring the household chores he has taken upon himself to do.
“I’m sure we can arrange it,” Castiel says quietly.
“You the dog expert?” the old man asks. His tag reads Rufus Turner and he looks like he spends his spare time killing things and enjoys it. This maybe why he’s the town’s only mortician.
“Do you know where Sam Winchester is?”
“I did say that Dean and I do share a more profound bond,” Cas supplies. At least now, Dean has the good grace to look guilty.
“Hey, look at that, looks like the prodigal boyfriend has returned.”
“Sioux Falls, South Dakota,” Dean says, making Castiel jump a little. Even if Dean says it in the rudest manner possible, it is nice to hear his voice.
,” Dean yells, jumping off the gurney. The thin sheet that is covering him falls to the floor and now he’s standing in a morgue completely naked with some nerdy-looking stranger staring at him. With his oversized trench coat and the accountant suit underneath, Dean wonders if he’s some lowly FBI employee and if that means that the Feds have finally caught him.
When Castiel wakes the next day, he finds Dean already awake and sitting by the laptop they’ve borrowed from Bobby. Once again, it appears that Castiel has overslept as the clock next to him glares noon.
Instead, Castiel is sitting patiently, waiting for Sam to stop complaining so that he can speak.
“Yeah, yeah, of course,” he mutters, scrubbing his face roughly.
Sam had brought up the suggestion after he has to sit and look at Cas mooning after Dean, who had long left the room.
“Um… the Carver Edlund’s books,” Sam weakly admits.
“Sounds like you picked yourself a winner there, Sammy,” Dean scoffs. This is typical of Sam. Sam has this great girl, perfect some might say, and he’s running around with some slut that could lead him to ruins. Jess is the only girl Dean has every approved of and Sam can’t be happy with just her.
God, the memory of his mother is like a jab to his side. It still hurts- even after ten or so years. His mom was just so
“Dean, calm down,” he hears Bobby say before he feels the knife being taken from his hand. “And leave my furniture alone.”
She is lying on the floor again, looking just like how Castiel had found her that afternoon. No colour in her face, her extremities a cold blue and her eyes wide. Castiel moves beside on the floor, reaching out to shake her again. There is no warmth in her body, no movement to indicate life. For the second time that day, Castiel is looking at the body of his dead mother.
Bobby grunts, “Like I haven’t noticed.”
Dean doesn’t sleep that night. His dreams are filled with blood, hidden by dark and the only thing he can remember when he wakes is a pair of yellow eyes staring up at him. Castiel has to wake him again and once again he’s lost before he realizes where he is and that he’s alive. This must be how soldiers feel when they return from war, knowing that they’ve faced Hell and must still keep going through the ordinary. He’s not sure he can do this every night- that falling asleep is even an option.
Dean wants to say yes. There’s actually nothing better than the thought of hanging out with Castiel, but that moment in the museum plays in his mind. As tempting as that offer is, Dean doesn’t think he can control himself if he spends any more time with Cas. If Castiel had been anyone other than his brother’s lover, he would have said yes. Sadly, Castiel is the apparent love of Sam’s life and Dean needs to leave him alone.
“Yeah, well, so is eating grass, but that’s not stopping you,” Dean snaps back.
Dean doesn’t even have the decency to look guilty. Instead he just grins at Castiel.
“Oh,” he states. “So your avoidance wasn’t because you took a dislike to me?”
“Thanks Cas,” Dean mumbles, turning to his laptop. Castiel sits down next to him, and they pass another day together.
“It seems I can only have relationships with men who are prone to cheating. My ex-boyfriend’s numerous affairs were one of the main reasons I left hm. I should have ended that relationship long ago, but I didn’t want our friends to think I was deficient in some way.”
Castiel looks surprised. “He killed Ruby for you. The entire reason he sought out Lilith was to avenge you. Your brother loves you, Dean.”
Dean lets out a shaky laugh. “Right, the talking. Like you were all for it when you refused to tell me the truth about how me being alive killed that agent.”
Inside is a labyrinth of hallways, but it’s also deadly silent and he follows the low whispers and sounds of footsteps until they’re in a hallway littered with bodies.
He reluctantly leaves the kitchen. He has this sense of duty to stay and watch over his mother, but she clearly doesn’t want him there and he has the latest edition of
“He’s Dean Winchester.”
“Crowley? As in the other half of Milton and Crowley? You worked for your ex?”
Dean is practically beaming when he knocks at the door.
“Erm, I was thinking more like
Dean turns around, only to see Castiel glaring at him, arms crossed like a pouting child. “What’s your problem?”
“Yeah, well, it’s not like he’s making your life any easier. If he gave you a chance instead of making you feel like crap, you could both be happy, but he’s wallowing in self-righteousness about how you treated him.”
“I was in Hell!” he says, his voice breaking. His father would have called him out on that. “How I am here? I was in Hell.” His throat feels sore, rough and raw. He could kill for a glass of water. The man’s serene expression breaks at this and a frown appears on his face.
“But you never thought ahead enough to see that I would be hurt by you ignoring me?”
“What are you doing at an art gallery?” Sam scoffs.
Suddenly there is laughter behind them. Dean and Cas turn simultaneously to see Sam standing at the entrance of the kitchen with his phone in his hand. He’s practically doubled-over from laughing. Dean turns a shade of red, while Cas just stares at Sam with a look of worry in his eyes.
The feeling of unease doesn’t leave Castiel and he can barely eat his dinner before he excuses himself. His mother kept talking about Mary Winchester’s death throughout the meal. While most meals in the Novak household had been spent in total silence, she spoke about how horrible it was for John Winchester to lose his wife and how the coroner couldn’t find a reason for why she died.
“Regardless, I would still do it,” he says, bending over and kissing the top of Dean’s head.
Castiel knows that this part of Dean’s life- that hunting down creatures- is what he does, but he still doesn’t like the glint in Dean’s eyes when he says this.
“Okay, first off, I’m not some princess and second, yeah, that’s about it. Just put him to bed for me.”
“Why do you never correct that?” Castiel asks one day when their waiter tells them it was nice of Castiel to take his father out for a meal.
There’s always something unnerving about the city morgue. It might be because of its basement location or the solemn atmosphere that comes with the fact that it’s a place that stores dead bodies. Even Gabriel is quiet when they enter it. Today there are only two bodies out, normal for a small town. Only the one on the right is fully covered with a blue sheet.
Castiel tries not to look hurt, but Bobby looks plenty offended on his behalf.
“And you didn’t think that I would want to know that someone
Castiel expects the ride to Lawrence to be in the same silence as their drive to Bobby’s, but as soon as they set off, Dean turns to Castiel.
“Of course,” Castiel says, moving to sit at the tiny dinette table. “Although I am surprised to see you making your captor breakfast.”
“Well don’t you look like the cat that caught the cream,” Dean teases, his face still feeling incredible hot. Bobby snorts.
“Ruby?”
“You don’t owe him anything. And I’ve said before, you won’t owe him anything when he’s dead. Go back there, trick him over to the morgue and touch him! He’s not going to complain then. I’m not having this discussion again with you again.”
“Thank you! Jo said I was overreacting when I showed her.”
“It was all part of Lilith’s plan,” Sam announces from his place in the doorway, two coffees in hand. He moves to Dean’s bed, passing Castiel one of the cups. “She needed me to release Lucifer, by killing her.”
“You can join me if you want,” Castiel offers.
Sam lets out a watery scoff, but opens the door so that Dean can come in. “No, you were right. I shouldn’t have lied to Jess. I should have
“That what I said. Anyways, he might be in love with this girl and he’s talking about leaving Jess, like for good.”
“No, no. It’s okay,” David reaches out (and Dean pretends he doesn’t lean in, doesn’t crave the touch). “I’m not mad. I’m just processing this. I’m just surprised that’s all. That you would want this.”
Mr. Turner eyes the bill. Castiel wonders how much business he’ll lose if people find out that he tried to sneak into a morgue.
“Dean-”
“Nobody is going to believe that.”
“Dude, I didn’t think this lowly popular culture gig would be your thing,” Dean teases. “I’m surprised you would lower yourself to spend an evening on Chuck’s books.”
“Not that bad.”
He expects a laugh from Dean for that, but instead Dean lunges forward, grabbing Castiel by the shoulders and pulls him to a kiss. At first, it’s awkward- their noses bump and Castiel is so in shock that he stands there stiff, unyielding. Dean steps back, looking disappointed and embarrassed. Dean rubs the back of his neck, the blush becoming deeper on his face. He looks like he’s about to leave, so Castiel steps forward.
“Yeah? About what?” Dean snaps. Castiel presses himself against the driver’s door. Dean moves to push past him.
It must hurt Dean to see that Castiel hasn’t physically aged since the time they first met. Back when it was just the beginning of “Dean and Cas”, they were often mistaken as lovers, a fact which Dean had always outright denied. Now Castiel is often mistaken as his son, something that Dean rarely protests.
“Hello, Gabriel Novak speaking.”
“I believe it is because I am not allowed to walk around in the nude. I remember you clearly telling me this on the first night I stayed here.”
“Like Jessica?”
“The best,” Dean mumbles brightly, signalling for two beers. He hands a glass over to Castiel. “Hey, loosen up. Enjoy the night.”
“Yeah, of course I do.” Still Dean does not move. He sits there, looking shell-shocked.
series. At least the series was making him money. “This book is total bullshit.”
“Cas,” he gasps, reaching out.
“Shouldn’t Dean have some choice in this matter?”
“Someone wants to make that series into a movie?” Dean blurts out.
What has Sam’s life come to that he is giving an angel advice about women’s underwear?
“I can’t explain. I mean- they’re not even my type- they're nervous and high-strung.”
“Cassie,” Gabriel returns, eying up Castiel’s latest batch of pies. “Break time?”
“I don’t think that would be a good idea,” he states, rubbing the back of his neck. For a second, Castiel looks disappointed and Dean wants to take back his denial.
“Of course,” Castiel reluctantly agrees. He’s not sure what is going through Dean’s head, but if it means that Dean is willing to stick around for a while, he’s all for it.
“Hey Sam, do you have the keys to the Impala? I’m going for a grocery run.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “My ‘problem’,” he says, air quotations and all, “is that you didn’t trust me to help you. You are so hell-bent,” Dean snorts at this, “on finding your brother, you didn’t think about what it would mean to me if you left. I am helping you, Dean Winchester. I’m always going to take your side.”
“Sorry? What was that?” Dean teases.
“That’s why you don’t wake the dead, Castiel. They’re better left alone. Unless that corpse comes with a nice little cheque attached, it’s best if they remain silent.”
“That hasn’t prevented your face from being plastered across the news for the last few days.”
“What?” he sputters, his jaw dropping. He clears his throat, “I’ve never been married.”
“All part of the life,” Dean grins. “You can’t work nine to five as a hunter. You just have to make do.”
“No problem,” Dean says. “Sorry you had to stab your girlfriend.”
Gabriel looks quickly over to Castiel, before looking back at Dean. The action is so fast, that Dean almost misses it.
“Yeah, that’s just great,” Dean mumbles, slamming him down onto a kitchen chair.
“I haven’t had the time. I spend my weekends with Emma and I’ve been trying to get this publicity launch for that shit book series that Bobby is trying to sell over and done with. Hey, do you want tickets for it?”
“Boy, I don’t want to hear your fantasies!” Bobby says, choking on his drink.
“No,” Dean shakes his head, waving his arm at Castiel. “Just a normal life.”
“Roughly. Hard to catch their tracks. They’re good at what they do. I mean, remember how I looked in the morgue? Would’ve you guessed that a person did this to me?”
His body is buzzing with energy, but with Dean’s dismissal he can feel it all rush out of him, leaving him with a stomach twisted with nerves and a rapid heartbeat that blocks out all sound. This confession was suppose to resolve him, was suppose to lift some of the guilt he carries. Now he’s standing in a stranger’s kitchen, exhausted and drained.
“Or what, you’re going to zap me back to Hell?” Dean snaps. “Sorry buddy, but I’d rather be dead than stuck here with some necromancer freak.”
Sam had to do a double take when he read these words. In his hands (rather, on his laptop) he was right now holding a great deal of power that he could use against his brother, which practically made up for the fact that Sam also now had too much knowledge about his brother’s sex life. Part of Sam wanted to scrub (with steel wool) the image of Dean in silk panties, but another part of Sam (the younger brother part) also wanted to utilize this information as revenge for all the times Dean had called him a girl and had babied him.
The kitchen is empty.
“I’m glad to see that Jo is a good influence on you for once,” Sam says with a smirk.
“I need more warning before you do something like that,” Cas stammers. He in turn, draws Dean closer to him and reaches over to cup Dean’s jaw. “Like this,” he says slowly, before pressing his lips to Dean’s. Quickly, he deepens the kiss. A low moan comes from Dean, which makes Castiel smirk. Dean is the first to break the kiss, quickly stepping back.
“Dean,” he says gently. “All of this is my fault. You shouldn’t feel guilty because I let someone die.”
For the second time that day, Castiel hangs up on Dean. If the first phone call had been discouraging, the second one had left Dean feeling guiltier than he thought humanly possible. Whatever hope he had of making things up with Cas had been wiped out before Dean could even map out the plan. It seemed like an even bigger sense of failure, but he turned to the whiskey bottle brought out for courage and began drinking from it to push away whatever feelings he held at the moment. Tomorrow he could face the day, hung-over or not, but tonight he felt like wallowing in self-pity.
“Like I’ve said before, I know you, Dean Winchester. I’ve known you since we were both children. I know you would never kill anyone.”
“I don’t know about that,” Chuck mumbles, picking at his jeans.
,” Dean scoffs.
“Like for good? I’m not going to drop any second now, am I?”
“And what if you get caught? You don’t need Sam finding out that you’ve escaped death by the national news.”
“When I was twenty-two.”
The pictures on the menu look like they haven’t been updated from the 1970s and Castiel suspects the food hasn’t either. “I had gathered that your connection with the FBI was largely due to supernatural influence,” Castiel says dryly. “But the breaking and entering? Credit card theft?”
“Dude, I’m sorry if I led you on. I honestly just panicked and that was the first thing that came to mind. I’m cool with it,” he quickly adds when he sees Dean’s face, which is probably red. “Actually I’m flattered that you would be interested. You’re a really attractive guy! Like if I swung that way, I would.”
to you?”
Dean nods and sits himself down. “You know I’m not always there for the emotional stuff, but I am here if you need me.”
“When I brought Dean back from the dead, I only meant it for the minute, but I did not have the time to gain the closure I was seeking.”
“I can’t, Sam!” Dean snaps back.
He probably deserved that last slap to his chest.
He was certain she had been dead. Although he had no personal experience with dead bodies (the closest he had come to
“I guess that would make a man grouchy. What’s so special about this girl to make him think about leaving Jess?”
and believe me when I say that he’s an okay guy.”
“Alright, alright. I need you to run out and get the best bottle of Scotch you can get your hands on. That mortician might need some buttering up.”
The four of them are walking aimlessly down the street. Jo and Sam have taken the outside, which forces Dean into the centre, next to the uncomfortably stiff presence of Castiel Novak, who stands besides him almost as if he is afraid of Dean. Dean isn’t sure what to make of Castiel- he seems quiet, but he’s abrupt to the point of rudeness and he makes the entire conversation feel formal, which is hard for Dean to get around.
“Oh, alright.”
“No! I’ll just have to cut back on what I send to Dad and I’ll talk with Lydia about next month’s payment.”
“Yeah, those are perfect.”
“What do you mean as far as you know. Bobby, you’re suppose to be watching out for him.”
Dean doesn’t see it though. Chuck is small, squirrelly looking, unshaven and shakes like he has the DTs (which Dean suspects might be the case). Chuck looks out of place with his rumpled jeans and stained t-shirt, although it’s a vast improvement from his usual boxer/housecoat combination that Dean usually sees him in when they conference at Chuck’s house. The fact that Chuck has even left his house is considered remarkable, but Dean thinks otherwise.
He doesn’t fall asleep at first. He rarely does. His body is used to few hours of sleep and although he feels the lack of energy, his mind is still wide awake. He waits for Dean to leave the apartment, to go find his younger brother and to abandon Castiel again. But Dean doesn’t- at least not when Castiel is conscious. A few minutes after Castiel gets into bed, he hears Dean settle onto the couch. He continues to wait, but the door never opens and he hears a soft snore coming from the living room. All the tenseness he is feeling drains slowly from his body and he finally falls asleep.
“Oh my god, can you believe it, Castiel?” she squeaks out, flipping to the local channel news station “They actually found a serial killer here.”
“So, Cassie, how did your old date with Ted Bundy go? Did you get the closure you so desired?” Gabriel chuckles. “He didn’t try and strangle you, did he?”
“Me neither. But, can’t say I didn’t expect it. Seemed more like I was just keeping a long-held appointment. Guess I just arrived early,” he says with a shrug.
Sam had confessed to him that he wanted to leave Jess for Amelia, and Castiel had urged him (gently, as that was Castiel’s way) to rethink this action, but Sam didn’t want advice, he just wanted someone to support him. Apparently, Castiel wasn’t the only one who disapproved, as he remembered Sam complaining about how his brother was in no position to judge Sam’s personal life and that he was upset that Dean wasn’t there for him.
- or, if you prefer, the story about Dean meeting his future self and where Sam is Satan (literally). Dean had briefly mentioned this event, but hadn’t allowed Sam any of the finer details. So despite the fact that Sam had already lived through these events, and that the writing was pretty awful, Sam was addicted and he plunged deeply into the untold story with pleasure.
It’s been two weeks since Castiel kissed Dean, and Dean’s still in shock, which is pretty pathetic on his part. Cas only kissed him on the cheek and here he is still mooning over it like Olivia Newton John’s character from Grease (and the only way he knows he’s acting like this is because Jo keeps humming “Hopeless Devoted” every time he walks into the same room as her). He’s mentioned a little bit of the situation to Jo and all she said was for him to stop sulking.
Even with a pissed off demon standing in the middle of the room, Castiel rolls his eyes. Dean shoots him a grin and a shrug. “What? It’s true.”
Dean hasn’t been in Lawrence for a few years, and tries to avoid it at as much as possible, but when he’s here, he has to stop at his mother’s grave.
Castiel pauses when they reach Baby.
Gabriel comes bursting in half way through their silent breakfast. The guy comes in all bright and cheery and apparently completely oblivious to the cold war that’s playing out.
“Found anything about Cas?”
Sam chuckles, “have you used the
“Sorry if I woke you,” he says smiling and clearly not sorry.
“You don’t have to tell me. I was just making conversation,” Dean snaps. Another awkward silence fills the car. Dean shifts uncomfortably as he pulls to the curb.
Castiel blushes again, looking back down at the floor. “Excuse me,” he mumbles, moving quickly away from the group.
“Sure, sure. What kind of dog do you have?” Dean says as he sobers up.
“Uh-huh,” Mr. Turner says as he slides the twenty over. “Well go right in. Body’s on the right table.”
After nothing and through the dark came blue. Or rather, blue eyes.
“You know I didn’t kill those people,” he finally says. “It was a shapeshifter.”
Dean looks over at him, surprised. “You would?”
“You know I would wait an eternity for you, Dean,” Castiel tells him sincerely.
Castiel looks sharply to Dean, who is turning red, his smile dropping.
“You’re not going to cash in on Dean’s death,” Castiel states firmly. It’s one thing for Castiel to have to kill his neighbour, but it’s another thing entirely if Gabriel thinks he’s going to make money out of it.
“I don’t know! Okay? We’ll cross that bridge when we get there. Right now I’m a little more focused on finding Sammy, killing those sons of bitches and heading back to Hell. Just don’t got all dark side on me, and we’ll be fine.”
“Yeah, I can put the word out,” Bobby sighs.
“I need to talk to him.”
Castiel turns around to see an angry Dean Winchester shooting daggers at both him and Gabriel.
- if it didn’t mean your life.”
“His number is dead and he refuses to speak to me. Said something about me taking your side. I’ve had some people try to track him for a bit, but he’s off the radar now. Haven’t heard from him since.”
“Well he’s a jackass.”
“Not really,” Castiel shrugs, although he looks slightly hesitant.
“You said there weren’t any consequences,” Dean growls. “But now some guy- this Victor dude- is dead because of me. You want to explain? And this time,
“Other than the fact that I was one that raised you from apparent perdition, you are the serial killer out of the two of us. If anything, I should be the one with trust issues.”
“Dean, are you okay?” Castiel asks quietly.
“I just don’t get it,” Dean mutters. He is sitting at Sam’s kitchen table, rummaging through last month’s collection of bills. Sam sits next to him with a beer in hand and silent, although Dean is certain that Sam is secretly laughing at him. “Where did the money go?” he said, throwing his hands up in the air.
Sam sighs. The problem with his brother is that he comes off a little rough around the edges and hostile. Castiel is the sort of guy who is polished and pristine, who likes books written by Russian authors and suits over jeans and Sam can see why Dean and Cas would butt heads. Castiel doesn’t see that Dean’s smart because he doesn’t come off as such. There’s a hidden intelligence within Dean that people rarely get to see and Sam wishes that Cas could see that.
“You Ruby?” Dean says, stepping towards her.
Dean stares at him for a moment, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. “Yeah, I guess I did,” he says, turning over. He lies there, looking reluctant to move. It seems all the urgency Dean had the night before has left during slumber.
“Oh,” Castiel says raising an eyebrow and drops his gaze with Dean.
“I thought you would be pleased with the news.”
“Well, aren’t we just a pair of sorry bastards,” he says, taking a drink from his bottle. “We’re living our entire existence on the guilt of two dead mothers.” He keeps laughing, but it sounds like he’s going to break at any moment, that it will soon be hysterical.
“Surprised you aren’t with Sam,” Henriksen smirks. “Thought you two were joined at the hip.”
“Oh, has Dean always been known for his forgivable nature?”
“Yeah, well I can’t believe I took a former angel lingerie shopping so that he could have gay-sex with my brother.”
“Bi?” Dean asks, the term feels foreign and uncomfortable rolling off his tongue. David’s face lights up as he explains what it means, what other terms means, how the capacity of human love is not contained in just two little terms.
Those blue eyes blinked at him. He saw them only for a second before the light became all too much. He had grown so use to the dark that light was painful at first.
“Only if they’re causing trouble,” Dean says, taking a swig of his beer.
“Dean?” he hears a gruff voice ask, and he turns to see Castiel sitting next to him, his arms folded over that stupid beige trench coat. He looks to see his hand in Castiel’s.
“Goddamn it,” he yells, kicking at a nearby chair.
“I don’t know,” Dean admits. “He’s changed his phone number since I last had it.”
“Um, maybe not those. Try something more satiny… maybe even pink.”
Until he’s not.
Castiel had left his previous firm after a humiliating break-up with Crowley and Sam had made him feel welcomed at his new work. It was Sam who had invited him to join him for lunch and it was Sam who made sure that Castiel got out and about so he that he wouldn’t spend his time hiding away in his apartment. Castiel is entirely grateful for that. Sam is a good friend too. He listens and he does the talking when Castiel doesn’t want to. Sam also values his opinion, something that doesn’t happen often to Castiel. Sam comes to Castiel with personal problems so often that it has allowed Castiel to share what is on his mind, something he rarely does.
Dean ignores him, but Ruby looks over, a knowing smile appearing on her lips. “A nice tone would get you some nice answers. I don’t know who you are, so why should I give you Sam?”
“Fine, I can drive in silence.”
“You are quite capable of talking to me right here,” Castiel states. Dean lets out a low frustrated growl.
“Maryland.”
“No, dude,” Dean laughs. “I thought you were banging my brother. He kept going on about how serious he was this person and how he wanted to leave Jess for them. I thought he was talking about you and I was… I was beginning to develop, um… feelings towards you.”
“Thanks. I owe you.”
Castiel nods. “I can do this, but only if you agree not to keep bringing up Victor Hendrickson.”
“Is this okay?” Castiel gestures to the couch. “I can buy a cot in the morning if you want.”
“Dean, don’t you see? Letting you die makes that FBI agent’s death pointless!”
They sit in silence, both mad at each other, until Jess returns.
“I would highly recommend the TV series- if it works out you would have a solid paycheck for the next 10 years.”
“Said that Castiel has the “Gift of Orpheus”. It’s the ability to revive the dead, but the second touch, like Orpheus’s look back, makes people die again.”
), had given Castiel the attention he so craved and needed.
-From Carver Edlund’s
Either Jo has been dumping perfectly good whiskey or she’s more heavy weight than Dean thought, but she’s no way as tipsy as Dean feels at the moment. It’s like she planned this in advance, because just after Dean settles in at the bar for the evening, she sits next to him with a look that says “we’re talking about your emotions whether you like it or not”.
Castiel walks quietly into the kitchen in fear of breaking what seemed to him a sacred silence.
“I appreciate the advice,” Castiel mumbles. Sam hopes Castiel isn’t too hurt by his brother’s rudeness.
. According to him, anyone who allows him to succeed is a “sucker” and deserves their fate (or at least, that’s what Gabriel told Castiel the first time he lent him money).
“No,” Dean protests, “he’s really not.”
“Have I done anything to offend your brother?”
“If they’re just babies, then
He hurries to the trunk, pulling out a gun and a couple of knives.
He’s heard the term thrown at small thin dudes who like theatre, has heard his father curtly use it when passing certain men, has heard it tossed around locker rooms for the entirety of his high school career, but it’s never been directly aimed at him.
Sam sits there for a moment with a stony look upon his face. “Wow, Cas. I thought at least you would support me in this since no one else has.”
By seventeen Dean knows that being attracted to dudes will ruin his life. His father, his brother, Bobby — they would all look at him differently if they knew. Would look down on him for being this way. So he keeps this part of him to himself and learns to play it safe.
Castiel is greeted by the smell of coffee when he wakes, but the cup is cold and Dean is nowhere in sight. There’s not really anything he can do- he doesn’t want to leave the room and miss Dean, and so he waits in the hotel room, watching an old cartoon about a coyote and his futile quest to kill a bird.
Some would call it hiding- Castiel prefers to call it thorough baking- but he spends most of the day in the kitchen, avoiding any contact with customers and with Becky. He fears this batch might be his worst yet. He’s too nervous to pay attention to the ingredients he’s mixing, and two of his pies have been severely undercooked. It’s almost a relief when Gabriel barges in. Almost.
“You could say that,” Castiel returns without humour in his voice.
So, it takes him by surprise after he rescues Thomas’s books from the nearest garbage bin and offers to take him on a date that Thomas looks at him with open disgust, the thankful expression replaced by hatred and horror.
“It was hard to avoid. You’ve been all over the news for the last couple of days. The town has been…
“I’m on board with helping you catch the guys who killed me,” Dean announces. At this, Gabriel instantly perks up.
“I’m just going to keep asking you.”
“It’s a bakery. Really more of pie shop,” Castiel says humbly. It seems such a simple thing, almost pitiful to admit to Dean.
It’s Dean’s turn to roll his eyes. “Yeah, I’ll just slip out of my feelings for Cas shirt, burn it, and move on.”
“And that’s what I’ve been doing since.” It doesn’t sound like much- at least compared to Dean, who has travelled around the country and has seen almost every walk of life. Castiel has lived in three states in his entire life and he feels like he’s missing out. Dean tells tales of gate crashing a fancy auction all so he could get his wallet back, of pretending to be an assistant on the set of some crappy B horror movie. Castiel has a bank loan to pay off and the only person he sees on a regular basis in his cousin It makes him seem like his life is so empty.
it’s his mother. There’s a body on the floor that appears to be the same shape and has the same bright red hair colour of his mother, but her hands and feet are inhumanly blue and there’s an expression of peace upon her fact that Castiel has never seen before. He thinks maybe somebody has left a wax dummy of his mother on the flood instead. Castiel watches for her chest to rise, but like the rest of the room, it remains eerily still. After a minute of waiting, nothing happens, and Castiel reaches down to check her pulse.
No, that was wrong. Sam remembers the flash of lace he saw in the archive and it wasn’t
“You put it the pot,” Dean says, motioning towards the stove. Cas gives him another look of confusion.
“Before Cassie here left, we were talking about blow jobs,” Balthazar announces, breaking the staring contest between Dean and Cas.
“Says the guy who brings back dead people.”
Sam doesn’t say anything, which tells Dean more than enough. They pay for their beers and leave without talking, and Dean hopes he hasn’t screwed up Sam’s marriage too much.
“Dean you know I’m not going let you die-”
“No, I’ll be fine.” Castiel blows his nose loudly, almost drowning out the noise coming from upstairs.
“Who’s the poor sucker that had to die in my place this time?”
“I need you to trust me on this. I need to see the body. The Dean Winchester I knew would have never hurt anyone.”
It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing. He’s got a name and he knows that Sam’s been here recently. He moves outside, calling Bobby with a prayer that he doesn’t wake the guy.
“He’s part of the reason,” Dean admits. “Like I’ve said, he’s nice, but it’s not worth it for Sam to leave Jess for him.”
Dean looks over to Castiel.
The dude was definitely flirting with him- and not like the knock three times on a bathroom stall door, quick glances in the park, kind of flirting.
“Well, you don’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The white light wakes Dean from the light slumber he is in and he rubs his eyes, looking over to see Jo absorbed with the movie. Jo had picked the movie that night and it wasn’t to Dean’s taste (too bad he sucks at Rock, Paper, Scissors). Even if it had been a good movie, Dean wasn’t sure he would have been able to pay attention anyways. His free time is spent worrying about his baby brother and how Sam is currently handling this affair, which is apparently more than just an affair, that he’s having. His brother had confessed to being in love with this girl, which had shaken Dean. Dean had thought Sam and Jess’s marriage was solid, that they were really in love with each other, and that these affairs were just coping methods to deal with stress. The confession that love might be involved meant these affairs were something more to Sam, something deeper. And it also meant to Dean that Sam and Jess’s marriage wasn’t working and that frightened him. If the perfect couple couldn’t stay together, than who could?
Castiel laughs, biting into his pancake. It’s surprisingly delicious. Although Castiel spends the entirety of his day baking, he rarely cooks breakfast for himself, only having time for his usual breakfast of coffee, pure and black, and nothing else.
“You named your dog Waffles?” Dean scoffs. The idea of that the stiff and formal Castiel has a dog named Waffles makes him smile. Castiel blushes.
“He’s out getting coffee. Of course you had to wake the second he leaves the room.”
“Whose Sam? Your boyfriend,” Balthazar says with a laugh.
“Could we at least have a name?” Castiel says just as Gabriel grabs his hand pulls him towards the woman.
“I think the ending of a marriage is a serious matter and one that cannot be discussed frivolously during lunch. Personally, I think you should wait it out. An affair is a much shorter thing than you think.”
“Hey,” Dean nods.
Gabriel does not have this moral dilemma. Maybe he was an angel in a past life and feels that he gets a free pass in this one because of this, but Gabriel doesn’t seem to mind making money off of
“What? You think I can’t like art?”
deal with them,” Dean huffs. “Fuck!” he yells, before taking an elaborate leap that could rival Baryshnikov. Cas moves away from the counter and quickly picks up the lobster- an action that practically means he’s rolling his eyes at Dean. Dean lets out a huff of relief.
“So, if you’re not kidnapping me, may I ask where we are actually headed?”
“You were dead, killed by Lilith. I had to save you, had to at least try and avenge you.”
“Well, have you tried picking up the phone and calling? Because if I were you, that would be where I start.”
The guy whose apartment is haunted is grateful, like really really grateful. Once Dean comes back, dirty and smelling of gasoline and decay, the guy, David, offers him a drink.
Sam looks at him like a chastised child. “You think I should tell Jess about the affairs?”
Dean returns late that night, although he doesn’t even bother trying to sneak in. Castiel wakes to the slam of door being shut and he creeps downstairs to find Dean opening a beer.
“No. He’s your boyfriend, why would I be talking to him?” Dean scoffs, taking a sip of his beer.
“Come on, Bobby. You think it might be good?”
David freezes beneath him and Dean pulls away, disappointed and worried, waiting for the slurs, for the shouting to begin. David just looks puzzled though, a little stunned.
“But seriously, why have you been ignoring Cas?” he says, his eyes widening to the unbearable ‘puppy-eye’ thing that he does.
“That must have been very demoralizing for you,” Castiel states sincerely.
In which Dean finally discovers Sam's real relationship with Castiel and gets some advice from Bobby whether he asked for it or not.
Dean is a morning person- he’s so far been the most aggravating person that Castiel has met (a large feat considering the fact that Castiel is related to Gabriel). “You don’t have much options for breakfast.”
“I should have known you drive a gas guzzler,” Castiel says quietly, moving to the passenger side.
And that’s one of his biggest regrets.
“As I’m ever going to be.”
“Can you entertain yourself while I’m at work?” he asks. Dean raises an eyebrow and gives Castiel a salacious look.
The fact that he knows the corpse makes it slightly less bearable to look at it. Still, pale, and completely torn and broken lays someone who Castiel had seen laugh and play, had watched carefully at night in a frustrated and misunderstood childhood crush. Someone who had been his first kiss. Now there’s nothing left.
The walk back had been nice- only marred with worry about grass stains that occurred from an impromptu wrestling match that Gabriel had (of course) started. Castiel knows his mother will scold him for it even though it had been entirely Gabriel’s fault. He also knows that Gabriel would get away with it; his older cousin has the ability to charm a nun, and would never be reprimanded for his bad behaviour. Mumbling about the unfairness of this, and the fact that Gabriel always played dirty (Castiel could never gain the upper-hand in their play fights), his evening looked to be spoiled, until he enters his street and hears the yells and whoops coming from his neighbours across the street- the Winchesters.
“Hey, don’t sweat it. I’m leaving and I’ll give you a ride. My car’s just back there,” Dean says, pointing with his keys to the far side of the parking lot.
“I would Dean, I
“So I take it that your search last night was successful?” Castiel asks, sitting up. “What did you find?”
“You are implying that you could not afford to pay me the last, oh,
apparently, says. Dean scoffs at this. “You are currently standing in the basement of the city morgue. You were killed four days ago by what the police think was a wild dog.” Dean snorts at this. Wild dog, or something like that. “You are also a suspected serial killer, among other things if that matters.”
“No. Have you ever heard of calling at a decent hour?” Bobby snaps. Apparently angels don’t answer those sorts of prayers.
He’d been dead.
“Yeah,” Dean coughs. “Does he want to see me?”
“Dean Winchester?” a voice replies that is deep and throaty. “This is Castiel Novak. I’m a friend of your brother, Sam-”
“Bobby, this is the only lead I have. Sammy’s been spotted by locals with this Ruby chick. Can you send the word out to your hunting buddies?”
“Oh, we’re not tog-”
“There’s no catch?”
Now that’s over, Dean wanders lazily around, munching on hors d’oeuvres until he runs into another one of Bobby’s client, Victor Henriksen, who writes True Crime novels. Henriksen is talking to a tall blonde man, whose wearing a blazer and a low V-neck sweater that screamed douche-bag to Dean.
“So the whole power thing?”
“Uh, Bobby, could I talk to you alone?” Dean asks, signalling to the kitchen.
“Hey, guys,” he says weakly. Dean doesn’t pull away, although Cas quickly moves his hand away. Dean gives him a lazy smile. “Hey, Sammy.”
“Uh-huh,” Rufus says slowly. It’s clear that he’s not convinced nor that he trusts either Gabriel or Castiel. “Must have been the same creature that go this dude,” he says pointing to the dead man on the left.
Castiel’s not sure about this, especially with how angry Dean currently is with him. He expects that this journey will be like the first, and he’s not ready for an 8-hour drive in complete, uncomfortable silence. But when he gets out into the yard, Dean looks up from the map he’s holding with a grimace on his face.
“I have explained to you the reasons why I cannot,” Castiel states calmly. “It is for my own personal feelings that I cannot, and is nothing against you as a person. If you had taken my advice, or maybe your brother’s, who I assure you is acting in your best interest, you would be happier.”
And Cas leans over, gently grabbing Dean’s chin, and kisses him, kisses out all those self-doubts, all that self-loathing, kisses out any questions that might still be in Dean’s head.
“Cas, I’ve explained this. Amelia and I are at this delicate point of our relationship. Jess and I are old news. I mean we had a good try at it, but it’s over. We want different things in life.”
“You really can’t blame him.”
Even if Jo is a head shorter than Dean, weighs like a hundred pounds and looks she couldn’t lift over ten pounds, Dean is terrified of her. Which is mainly why he agreed to go out. Jo keeps to her promise of an evening filled with booze and pissing off the newcomers (much to her mother’s protest). They’ve made a killing that night (or at least Jo has, she’s ruthless when it comes to pool) and instead of saving that money like the good responsible adults that they like to pretend they are, they were spending it on the best whiskey that Ellen can provide.
Dean shrugs. “Hey, I’ve been keeping below the radar my entire life. This is nothing.”
“That’s not right, Cas,” Dean says, taking the cup from Castiel. “You know that. Humans are suppose to grow old.... even if it sucks.”
“The police will have to call the coroner to attest this. Do you have anyone you can call? Your dad? A grandparent?”
“Dean, your mother’s death wasn’t at the hand of some demon. I was me,” he confesses. “I killed her.”
Gabriel scoffs at this. Gabriel is infuriating- not only because he spends most of his spare time teasing Castiel and harassing customers, but also because he abuses Castiel’s abilities to his advantage. It shouldn’t surprise Castiel, but Gabriel has figured out a way to make money from the dead (and it doesn’t involve working for a funeral home or in life insurance).
Dean lets out a huff. “You know you’re a stubborn son of a bitch.”
, in which it was obvious that he was madly in love with the male lead-”
“I can’t name any of them,” Dean interrupts, “probably because they never come up in conversation.”
Castiel hasn’t been in Lawrence since the thanksgiving after his mother died. A month before school ended, he heard word that his father had sold the house and moved to Illinois. He never expected to return to Kansas, let alone Lawrence, and the look on Dean’s face tells him that Dean is feeling something similar.
“Dean, I know I don’t have the power to stop you from waiting to see your brother, but believe me, I am acting in your best interest. Just wait here for a few days and we can find him- together.”
“I’m not either.”
“Not going to ask where I’ve been?” Dean says with a mouth full of burger.
He corners Thomas the next day and threatens the dude, swearing if he hears anything about what happened the day before, he’ll pay, because Dean Winchester isn’t some fucking queer.
Dean scoffs, turning away from Castiel.
just a minute ago. There’s a blush of embarrassment on her face and she’s slightly pale, but nothing like the paleness of when Castiel had first entered the room.
to see you. It would be easier for me-”
“Really? You like the metal sculptures?” Castiel states with a sniff.
“Why did you do that? There was still time left!” Castiel snaps.
“Sammy,” Dean rushes to his brother’s side. “Sammy, what are you doing?”
“Yeah, you did a good job with that!” Dean snaps, pointing to the papers in front of him. “You’ve introduced another race of creatures that no one is going to like.”
“Do we have to boil this one, Dean?”
It makes him drop his knife and turn to Cas, who has looked up quickly from the clatter on the counter.
Castiel shrugs his shoulders. “Do you want to grab dinner?”
“I’m also not bi.”
“Ruby,” Dean says with a smile, slamming down the laptop’s lid.
“Come on, Cas. I know the rules, we’ve played this game. I’m a freak- an even bigger freak than you. I don’t deserve to be here. You were-” he chokes on the words, looking down at the bottle in his hand. “You were just allowing me some closure before you zap me back to the underworld.”
“I know,” she says, patting him on the arm. “I’ll get Ash to drive you over.”
here,” Gabriel points to Dean, “was just the beginning of what I like to call the ‘Hellhound Murderer’. Catchy title right?”
“Lilith,” the girl slips out before she falls back onto the table.
Castiel shakes his head. “No, of course not.”
So Dean leans in again, but David pulls back.
When the burgers arrive they smell heavenly, but it only makes Castiel’s stomach twist with pain. He watches Dean as he bits into the burger. Dean makes a noise that is ungodly orgasmic, his face lighting up with pleasure and he chews loudly, moaning after he swallows. Not only is Castiel feeling sick, his body is betraying him and he shifts uncomfortable as he tries to cover his boner.
“Thanks for the support, bitch.”
He watches her, looking for any sign of abnormality- other than the fact that she had been
“Emma-bear,” he scolds one Saturday afternoon. Emma is currently eating cheerio’s, and missing her mouth because her lap is covered in them. She just grins at him and continues with her attempts of eating breakfast. It’s a grin that Sam says she takes directly from her father, and he knows his little girl doesn’t just have Bobby whipped.
“He’s my cousin.”
“Uh, hello,” Gabriel says, knocking on Castiel’s head. “Have you been listening to any of the words coming out of your mouth? Castiel, I’m sure if you figured out the seriousness of the situation. One FBI agent is dead because of you and we have a guy who can’t even spend one afternoon in your apartment without going AWOL walking around here. For the sake of, oh
“Brown hair, dressed kind of skanky. I don’t know why he stayed with her- they were always fighting.”
“What do I do with it?” he says, waving the lobster around.
Becky turns to Dean, “That’s a compliment. He looked like a male model even if he did kill people for a living.”
inflict upon himself in a few days?”
Chuck catches Dean’s eyes as he continues to stumble through his speech. Dean mimics the cutting of the throat and he can see Chuck wince even from where he is standing. Chuck mumbles out the rest of the speech and excuses himself hastily.
Castiel wakes to the smell of bacon cooking. Downstairs he can hear the movement of two men
“I hardly even know you.”
Turns out Dean’s gay thing is way less gay than he thought.
“We had a deal. I find your serial killer, you zap me back to Hell.”
Well folks, this is all I have written so this might be the last update for a while because a) I'm a slow writer, and b) I'm not sure quite sure where to go next. Thanks for the comments and the kudos and hopefully I'll have more up soon!
Screw Cas for playing the saviour card. Dean never liked the idea of owing people a favour and this is a big one. He does literally owe the guy his life, even if he is giving it up in a couple of days.
“I really don’t need you to psychoanalyze me, Dean. I have Chuck for that.”
… a very brilliant man. I was tired of being overshadowed by him intellectually. Why did you get a divorce?”
“Yeah, I told you, I’ve been following their trail for years. Finally figured it out. They’re going to strike in Ilchester, Maryland. I’ve got Bobby searching for recent missing person cases. I expect a call from him any minute.”
“You’re not going to let me listen to my own music in my own car?”
“Dude, what’s up?” Dean asks when Jess excuses herself to use the bathroom and Jo had cleared off to finish her shift.
“Um…” Castiel says. Dean points to the ground where Emma is still sitting, absentmindedly petting the dog, her attention on her father and Castiel, her eyes wide. “Oh, right. Maybe we should continue this another time.”
“I think you’re reading too much into it,” Castiel says, taking a swig of beer. The bartender chuckles, glancing over at the entrance, a small smile appearing on her face.
“Not normally. But I believe you,” Castiel says with a small chuckle.
Castiel feels the blood rushing away from his head, his heart beginning to pound so hard that he can barely hear Dean. This is all his fault- Dean’s death, John Winchester’s death, were all of his doing. At twelve years old, he had known that he had ruined the Winchesters’ lives, but he never expected the damage he caused to extend this much. His entire purpose of bringing Dean back was to ask for forgiveness, but now he knows that what he has done is unforgivable.
He barely dreamed when he was alive, but when he did, his dream usually consisted of Sammy, of fireworks and of Baby. On bad nights he would dream of his mother and apple pie, but this was only at his lowest point, when he felt he deserved the guilt. So dreaming of a stranger (this had to be dream) was weird.
Dean looks him over, his mouth opened as if he’s stunned, but he still looks hurt and a little surprised. Shaking his head and dropping a few bills on the counter, he turns and leaves the bar.
“Can you believe I live with that?” Dean asks with a laugh. “I swear he’s strangling a parrot up there.”
“Yeah, I guess.” Dean rubs his face, trying to work out a growing headache. “I mean, I don’t know. He’s not
Dean’s another problem of Castiel’s. Once again, here is another person that Castiel isn’t sure about when it comes to in terms of their relationship. They aren’t friends, nor are they strangers, but they seem friendlier than just mere acquaintances. Although Castiel is grateful for Sam’s friendship, he has found that his best memories since his move come from Dean. Dean is passionate, but this passion is emotionally based rather than intellectually and this is so different from the lawyers he spends most his days with. Dean is humorous, or at least Castiel thinks Dean is, since Dean keeps making references that Castiel doesn’t quite understand. Dean also doesn’t seem to mind that Castiel is awkward and, in fact, Dean makes himself feel more comfortable with himself than anyone else. And it’s difficult for Castiel that Sam is keeping at a distance, because he would like Sam’s permission and advice for pursuing a relationship with Dean.
“What did you think we were going to do with it? Take it to the movies?”
Sam had hoped that the embarrassment of two grown men buying ladies underpants would be undermined by the end of the lustful looks that Castiel gave Dean. Vowing never to return to that store again, Sam had otherwise thought the shopping trip had been successful and he had given the former angel several excellent tips on how to win Dean’s heart. Cas had nodded and seemed interested in Sam’s advice, so he thought Cas would act upon it, but there seemed to be no change in behaviour- Dean still largely ignored Cas’s obvious mooning and Sam was still stuck between the sexual tension the two of them had.
“I don’t know. He raised your ass back from the dead,” Bobby mumbles.
“So, you going to tell us?”
“I have been told that I do no excel in social situations,” Castiel confesses blandly. It causes Dean to give the man next to him a double-take before he bursts out laughing. Cas looks at him with bewilderment.
“This connection,” Sam blurts out. “I think this might be the one. Like I might be seriously in love.”
asking Sam if he knew that his brother was in love with an angel.
“What kind of closure do you need? You don’t need his
“Dean?” he inquires, although most of his attention is still on the book in front of him. Beekeeping, maybe? Cas has been talking a lot lately about getting some hives, but Dean’s not sure if he’s joking or not.
Say what you will, but Castiel was raised a Christian, and whatever stance he now has on Heaven or Hell, he still feels that it’s kind of
Sure enough, as he approaches, he sees the two Winchester boys playing out front. The younger one- Sammy- is holding two action-figures in his hands (a GI Joe in one hand and a Batman in the other) and is loudly emitting noises that are supposed to be machine guns. Castiel watches as Dean, Sammy’s older brother, grabs the Batman figurine from the younger boy.
Gabriel huffs. “What’s his deal? Another John Doe?”
“Yeah well, we’re the other ones,” Gabriel says, slamming the money onto the desk.
“Is it about Sam?”
“First, I’m hurt by that. Second, you probably shouldn’t threaten the guy who holds the keys to getting you into that morgue. I’m just saying that there’s no part of bringing back a dead
Castiel shakes his head.
Dean chuckles as he flips a pancake onto a plate. “Maybe it’s just the Stockholm Syndrome kicking in,” he says as he places the plate of pancakes in front of Cas. Castiel raises an eyebrow. “It’s an apology for my crappy behaviour last night. I guess I just woke up on the wrong side of the morgue.”
“You said your lover was high-strung and nervous,” Dean points out.
“Uh, yeah, about that, how did you find out about the panties thing?”
“It’s complicated,” Dean snaps. “Since I can’t get a hold on Sammy, my best bet is an old family friend. Lives hear Sioux Fall in South Dakota. It’s less than a day’s drive.”
“You okay with all this supernatural stuff? I know it’s a lot to handle…”
“Yeah, me either,” Dean says moving inside. “But here I am.”
They both look down at the body. Castiel’s stomach lurches.
Or at least that’s what he told himself. If the moping of pre-Castiel phone call was painful and childish, Dean’s mental state after his talk with Cas was just downright pathetic. Bobby’s extension of caring had worn out long before Dean had made that phone call, and it certainly didn’t reappear after. Bobby just ignores the sight of Dean eating at his desk and no longer tries to correct it. Finally, after three days of this, Bobby stops in front of Dean’s desk and just barks out “if you want a pity-party, you’ve come to the wrong place. Why don’t you take a couple of vacation days and come back when you’re more the little miss sunshine who used to work here.”
“Noticed what?”
A jolt of comprehension straightened Sam in his chair. Quick as the thought, his hand slid across the table to seize Dean's wrist.
There was the sound of angel's wings cutting the air, the thunderous whisper of shifting reality. Dean knew it intimately. How many times had he cringed from it, but now he felt nothing but a full body sensation of profound joy. It was like taking a bath in cuddly hugs. He didn't have to turn around to know his ride had arrived.
Dean tried to ignore the slight flutter in his chest as he struggled to process what he really wanted. A way out of endless introspection? A chance to be really useful? A thousand afternoons like this with Cas. To just be, live without the guilt or denial or Chuck controlling them all like they were characters in his twisted fanfiction.
“I bet,” Sam said on a smirk. Then, he blushed and pulled an apologetic face, “Sorry, is that allowed in actual heaven?”
And all three men were gone.
“And you are not invited,” Cas added.
“Chuck isn't the only creator with delusions, Dean. I think they pull in too much energy and take over as avatar deities, a personification of how we see God. People reflect themselves into what they choose to worship. There's one universe where some reality TV star took charge. And the Leviathans are out there, with a truly scary, scaly Almighty.”
“We're a little shaken up. Sam dropped the phone and drove off the road, but its just a flat tire and a broken side mirror. I didn't know you were involved or...married?”
Until the next moment.
Acknowledging the point, Dean gave a lopsided smile and blushed.
“And I should just kiss you, like I've always wanted to do, so we can both get on with being happy?”
Dean cocked an eyebrow at Cas, who flashed him a toothy, totally sappy smile. There was still a touch of shyness in it, which amazed Dean considering how completely in charge Cas had been twenty minutes earlier.
A heavy hand descended on his shoulder. Slid down to his elbow, lifting gently.
“No shame here, Dean. Clearly!”
“We had a winning team until that slutty cheerleader ruined Joey's...” Dean reined in his indignation, and continued in an intensely reasonable tone. “Okay...we are not here to dredge up the past. We are here to discuss this plan to...”
“I know, right?”
"Yeah. No, I can't leave Sam in a happy world where nobody knows him. Not if there's a chance we could die. We need to wait and see if he wants to go with us."
"We don't have to kill them, we could just have a dairy farm."
“My dad would say there are no gay angels.”
“Eighteen messages,” Dean said, hitting the callback button, without listening to any of them.
Dean spotted his jeans near the front passenger tire. He hobbled to them, then on to fetch his other boot.
“Are you alright?”
“I got a ride coming,” Dean said, confirming what they both already knew.
“Not everyone is comfortable with the full spectrum of sexuality. Your father might be repressing some concerns about his own masculinity, overcompensating with passive aggression. Or perhaps he's fallen under the influence one of the Evangelical movements that seek to control large groups of people with hypnotic resonance via mindless chanting.”
"Car. Backseat.”
"Because you drove us to a field," Cas said, leaning over to peer at Dean, as if concerned he might not remember. "You dragged me to the Impala and said, 'Get in the car. Not the back seat.' Then, you drove us to the edge of town and turned quite sharply into this field. You stopped the car, popped the trunk and said, 'You get the blanket and I'll find the F-ing lube.' Which I just realized is probably not a descriptive adjective, but an expletive."
“Yeti could be migratory, Sam, you don't know.”
"To just wait?"
“Cas,” Dean warned, giving an almost invisible shake of his head. He turned to Irene with a half-apologetic grimace. “He over explains. Most angels are junkless. No sexuality or identity or gender. They just take on the human suit to communicate with us.” He shot a glance at Sam. “I notice you're not saying anything about my coming out.”
“Remarkably peaceful,” Dean said. He tossed his bag in one chair and sat in another. “No sea monsters.  No yeti.”
Sam granted his big brother a full on happy face, got in the car and drove away. Dean watched him go, smiling like the most satisfied man in creation. He would have said he couldn't have been any happier than he was in that moment.
"Why does that sound like something out of Doctor Who or Buffy? Are we going to a world without shrimp?"
“What Cas means,” Dean said, giving his better half a “what the hell” frown, “is that he and I are going. Just us. And only for a few seconds. We wanted to let you know, Sammie! That's it. End of discussion.”
It had been a man, right? Dark haired? Medium height? Medium build? He was moving fast, but he couldn't have gotten far. Dean stopped running when he reached the lot. Slightly winded, he paused for a few deep breaths.
“Fine. Yeah. I'm good. Great. Look, Sam, I found Cas.”
"We don't have to take Sam."
“The yeti isn't from the Antarctic.”
“No monsters. No demons. No angels. This is just a town full of people Jack saved.”
“That I love you.”
Dean/Castiel
“I suppose it makes some sense,” Sam replied. “Selah is from Hebrew. It is like a choir direction in the Psalms. It means to take a moment to breathe and exalt the Lord. Maybe the former angel vessels were drawn to the name. Like you.”
“How long have you had a house?"
"The wings are...' Cas stopped speaking to smile. "You can see me as I am?"
“The Fairy prion”
“I sense this is one of those times when, even if I know, you would prefer I not tell you so.”
“So, these other universes are not the same as parallel dimensions,” Irene said, pointing a fry at Cas.
The waitress arrived and Dean turned on the charm for a second or two to ensure they both had fresh coffee and pie. Sam took the moment to scan their surroundings. It was a habit he would never give up, he imagined, setting his back to the wall, facing the windows, covering the exits. The cafe had floor to ceiling windows on two sides. Beyond the expanse of glass, people bustled back and forth in an open plaza square. A fountain sprayed heavenward. A flock of mixed birds bathed and frolicked in the water. A passing truck honked and the birds rocketed upward. Dean flinched. He whipped around from his leering study of the retreating waitress to glare out at the ruckus of wings. It took both the Winchesters a beat or two to relax.
“You're saying it with your eyes, Cas!”
Dean leaned into the Impala for stability as he fastened his pants, then he opened the car door and sat down on the seat edge, sock-clad feet still out on the ground.
A long time later, Dean lay sprawled on the spare blanket from the Impala's trunk. There was a rock, or maybe a tree root, under his left buttock, but he was too spent to move. He watched Cas collect their clothing, noticing that they both still wore socks. A tiny smile tugged on Dean's lips, despite his best efforts not to get all sappy.
“Connected, yes! Love thy brother as thyself.”
"I can sense you are no longer as concerned about personal space."
"I have never understood your considerable concerns over shellfish, but if you have a craving, we can have shrimp when we come home."
“No. Nobody is in charge here. It works off of you. Your needs.”
“Cas, if you keep talking, we are going to be arrested for public indecency.”
“I know.”
“But I guess that's over now.”
"He's on his way, right now. We have real world problems. We have to tell him I'm gay."
“Well, I'm in,” Irene told them. “Just watching you guys interact has been the most fun I've had, since, I don't know? Comic-Con? And I would kill for a look inside this Empty place.”
“Yeah. Uh! No! That's a hard pass just now.”
It was Cas' turn to give Dean a "don't be a dumb-ass" look. "No, Dean. I'm saying there is a way out of this particular universe. I still have the keys."
When he finally stopped hearing the bang-bang of his own heartbeat, he said, "Well, that was...very relaxing."
And then he saw it. His personal nightmare come true. Out of the corner of his eye Dean caught the flap and swirl of a mid-length, beige-fabric coat as the person wearing it turned into a parking lot a block and a half away. Dean resisted the urge to sprint down the street. He bit down on the impulse to shout after the barely glimpsed figure. He did that in his dreams, night after night, only to wake up alone. He'd run after such a figure at least a dozen times in the waking world, too. It always ended in embarrassment and awkward explanations. He resisted every urge for a full count of three seconds.
“Hello, Dean!”
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
Dean/Cas
Supernatural
“No. That was you, Cas. You were blind; I could see just fine. I could see it. Feel it. You and your rainbow wings."
Sam and Dean looked at one another and then turned in unison to stare open-mouthed at Castiel.
“You want to pick up a few dozen and go see Mom and Dad?”
“About what you said...back there...”
NOTE: I put a little coda to this coda in the comments...but now it is gone...and there is even more Supernatural AU Ending Fic. To be clear...this fic is meant to stand alone, but I sort of wrote more, because I couldn't stop here.
When Dean continued looking at him, expectantly, Cas furrowed his brow. He stood baffled for a moment and then, realizing Dean was right and some things needed to be said, he turned up the wattage on his smile.
“Personal space,” he said, forcing the words out.
The town of Selah, Washington was overflowing with Angels.
“Shut up, Sam.”
“Dean, over here!”
Cas let his trench coat and other assorted bits of clothing cascade across Dean's torso. Dean was fairly sure Cas could have evaded a tumble with ease, but he didn't resist the pull. They rolled across the blanket. Kissed some more. Eventually Dean couldn't manage anything but promises. After a disgustingly tender period of gazing into Cas' eyes, Dean remembered how much he hated Hallmark movies. He cleared his throat, dismayed at himself, and broke free of the embrace. Struggling first to all fours and then to his feet, he snatched up a t-shirt and his underwear.

“Yeah, you do. When Cas came back from Purgatory, for example.”
"I think you found my off switch...eventually. All security systems have powered down. Sleep. Food. Then what? You wanna look for a motel room?"
They leaned into one another, both grinning like idiots or two people who had been unexpectedly delivered out of pain and suffering into paradise. They took forever to catch up. Maybe literally. All Dean knew for sure was that after a time, a shorter time than all eternity, he was ready to do something else.
“It's dangerous, Irene.”
“I took a brief, intense interest in the game.”
“Hi, Irene," Cas chimed, before Dean could reply. "We are in Selah, Washington at Maxine's Diner. Eating cows, but not having milkshakes."
This town was a waking nightmare for his anxiety issues. And, what kind of world was it where he was the one with paranoid delusions? He'd faced down vampires and werewolves and the Army of Heaven.
"Castiel. I'm Dean's better half," Cas said, just as Dean spoke again.
Summary: A Coda to the Coda I wrote for the Destiel fans that is entitled “When You're Done.” I like the way that ended. This is not really a sequel or an official part of THAT story, which came to me like a flash and demanded I write it. That was a labor of love for Destiel fans, even though I am not one. I just wanted to end the series on a happier note. This is just some crack!fic, because my brain went into sappy Destiel overdrive and I wanted to write about what happened next. I blame the cute Destiel videos I watched to prep for writing their reunion.
“Or eight.”
“The one you deserve, yes. That's Jack's plan.”
They went for burgers and Dean called Sam to give him directions to the diner.
"It a new shirt," Cas told him.
“What?” Sam called from the kitchen.
“Not for one second.”
“It's like that song," he said, with sudden inspiration.
“Seriously,” Sam said, hesitating to take the offer. “The Impala?”
The End
Dean jumped and spun around, fist pulled back to punch. It was Cas. Hair. Build. Face. Trench coat. Son of a bitch.
“You've been driving her for years, right? Take the long way back. It's a great road. Just don't change the tunes.”

“Oh, yes. It was our first,” Cas said, standing to begin dressing. “As far as I remember, also." Pausing, in his attempt to button his mostly button-less shirt, he said, "I apologize, if I was excessively domineering.”
“I dropped the phone, Sam, in the heat of...the moment. Moments. Many moments were heated.”
"I meant, if you have a house, why are we in a field?"
They'd gotten through the hugging and the catching up and were clearly confusing Sam's girlfriend, but not as much as Dean thought they would.
“No. I mean. Jack is everywhere here, but there is an Awareness that is everywhere, too. The real God was never a person or a thing.”
“But we are definitely meeting at the Roadhouse later, right?”
The pie and coffee arrived and they applied themselves to the joy of eating together after so much time apart. They talked of Sam's final semester of law school and Dean's time on the merchant ships and fishing boats in the Southern hemisphere.
There was a jangling sound, like keys falling to the floor.
“It's a party, Sam. Bring your happy face.”
"What about...this?" Dean waved his finger back forth to indicate there was something between them.
“Innuendo? Yeah, Sam, if I get to be me.”
“Sam, you have a life. You have a job. Irene's a nice girl.” Dean wafted a hand at her and offered a sweet, if fleeting, smile. “We will be back before you even know we're gone. This isn't a permanent thing.” As he said the last, he cut a sharp warning look at Cas, a fraction of a second too late.
“I'm not fictional,” Dean told the photo.
“A house?
“Son of a bitch,” Still, quaking with laughter, Dean snatched up the phone, thumbing off the speaker as he mouthed “What?” at Cas, before directing his next remarks into the phone. “Long story. Fill you in when you get here. Selah, Washington. Maxine's Diner on Fifteenth Street. See you soon.”
“Hello, Cas!”
“Cas!”
"Dairy farms kill the babies and steal their milk, Dean. It's very sad."
Dean didn't answer. He wasn't fictional. But he felt hollow, like an abandoned character, something out of the lore. It was like a piece of him was missing. He could lay his weary body down, but without that part, he couldn't rest. When he was out on the ocean, he'd told himself that missing part was Sam. Now he had Sam and Sam was happy and safe. Sam deserved this life. Maybe Dean just needed to find his own happy place in this world without hunters. Sam popped his head around the door frame.
"Need blood to the head,” he groaned, letting his torso slump forward. “So dizzy.”
“You know I don't trust computers. I prayed and was drawn here."
“Seriously? It was soccer, Dean, in Oklahoma.”
"And no matter how long this takes us, the food will stay hot?"
He hit the disconnect icon and wrinkled his brow at Cas. "Better half? Really?"
“Are you saying we don't have to kill lambs if we raise sheep? Isn't that how we get lamb stew?"
“Are you okay? Can I help you with something?”
"A place to live. Four walls. Fresh air."
"If you're about to suggest we start antiquing, I'm leaving."
“Yes.”
“Don't ever apologize for being you, Cas.”
“So, I don't have to explain or apologize for anything?”
“I'm just savoring things, Sam. Easing in to my happy ever after, taking my time. Looks like I have plenty to spare. But you can go. Explore. Have fun catching up with family.”
“Hmmm,” Dean said. “Like Jack said, he's in every drop of rain, every grain of sand. In us, too, like everyone is family.”
“No angels?”
"Hello, Sam!"
Summary: The Wincesters won. God is good. The world is safe and at peace.
Angels with a capital A.
Disclaimer: Seriously, I didn't mean to even write this...so I don't think there will be any further updates. But...once characters start yapping in my head, they keep on pestering me. “Then, what happened...? What about Sam? They are going to do what now?” All these characters are the property of WB and CW and the Supernatural writers, I don't know why they are talking to me.
“They are flippin' everywhere, Sam!” Dean hissed into the phone.
Dean shuffled a smidgen closer.
Dean didn't recognize Irene Cooper at all. Maybe she'd died at the hands of some monster he'd later killed, maybe she'd just disappeared and come back. Everyone had been restored, not so much back from the dead as rebooted, into Jack's brand new world. It had been a real gut blow for the Winchester brothers. Nobody remembered them, not Bobby, not even their parents, a childless couple living happily in retirement. Nobody remembered the monsters, except as stories, which on balance, the way some of these people had died was probably a blessing.

“Who looks nothing like Ruby, right?”
"Where are we--?
“I know you probably like...other things...sometimes.”
“I'm going to hit the road for a few days,” Dean said. “Maybe look for a house in the country.”
"You're not gay, Dean. You're clearly strongly attracted to women. And a few men."
Spoilers: The Series Finale
Dean tried calling back but Sam's line stayed busy. Then the phone rang again. The screen said Irene Cooper.
Cas started to speak, but stopped himself. He struggled for a word that would convey knowing without using that particular word.
Sam laughed despite his renewed worry. “I sent you a picture.”
"No. You have a house. I'm okay with the house. I'm just not a fan of birds. Couldn't we raise cows or goats?"
“What's that supposed to mean?”
"We can be back before Sam gets here,” Cas said, then scrupulously added, “If we don't die."
“I'm still recharging,” Cas said. In response to Dean's cocky smirk, he added, “From my time in the Empty.”
“Maybe. Maybe, I'll just leave. Nobody's stopping me from leaving." A man across the street caught Dean's eye. He nearly dropped the phone. "Gah! Dude! It's Lucifer!”
“So, my needs brought you out of the Empty.”
"Too many pigeons in the city?”
The company t-shirt had a logo on the back of a bunny pushing a wheelbarrow. It wasn't even a little bit scary. Dean swallowed hard and glanced around again. He should call Sam back and tell him never mind. As he leaned against the bumper of the Impala, a woman who had once threatened to skewer his liver and feed it to him, crossed the street. She smiled and nodded at him as she passed. She had two adorable children in tow. Dean had a sudden recollection of the equally adorable little girls possessed by Lilith.
“Yes. You no longer have light or color receptors, or skin to pick up the sensation of the air around you. Or a brain, to register those senses.”
He smiles, “Shit, Cas, that ain’t true.”
When Dean wakes up, he’s in a cage. Maybe ‘cell’ would be a more accurate choice, but The Angel guarding the door makes him feel no bigger than a yorkie in a kennel. The walls are barren, and there’s nothing on the floor but him, and a small pile of clothes that had been tucked under his head as a makeshift pillow. He realizes he’s naked, and moves to pull them on. The Angel averts its eyes, and says nothing.
“I do not.”
“I look like I give a rat’s ass about ‘supposed to’?”
Dean stands and leans back against the wall, “So, how is this gonna work? You just snap your fingers and presto-chango I’m a real boy?”
Dean’s throat twists, “Your next vessel? How many have you had?”
“Shit, just give me the same equipment. Easier that way.”
It’s the silence that finally begins to eat at Dean. He’s always been a chatterbox, and when he couldn’t talk Alastair was glad to fill the dead air for him. But The Angel is silent, save for the hum of its rings spinning, and the gentle
Cas nods only his bull head. The raven has looked away. “I do. James Novak is a troubled man. He is disillusioned with his church, is on rocky footing with his wife, and is terrified of letting his daughter see him struggle. He has begun to lose faith in God, so he prays instead to his guardian angel. Those prayers have been rerouted to me ever since I was informed that I would be taking him as my next vessel.”
Dean is about to give out when The Angel arrives. Alastair left him hours ago, knowing that today was the day the vanguard would break through their infernal defenses. But, even as he prepared to flee, he refused to cut Dean’s torment short. Dozens of cuts litter his body, intended to bleed just slow enough to string him along for days, but enough to make him too weak to fight back. It’s beautiful, in the clinical way that Dean has come to view his own torture. He knows exactly why Alastair has laid him out like this, the patterns of the veins he had nicked or severed to get the blood to flow just so. In his fear, however, Alastair had become sloppy, and in a few places the knife had gone too deep. If he tries, Dean can cut his time on the rack short.
“Okay then.”
“It’s the angels,” says Alastair, voice almost reverent, “They’re here for you.”
Dean’s thirty-ninth year in hell has just begun when he accepts Cas’ request to rebuild his body. He still feels some measure of terror when Cas enters his cell, but the gentle warmth of his presence soothes it away.
Cas’s rings slide out from under him, and he lands on his feet in his cell. He takes a second to brush his thumb over the divot of a scar, slide his palm over the handprint. “Yeah, Cas. It’s perfect.”
“I do not mean in the way you are thinking.” He pauses, and Dean’s heart keeps jackrabbiting in his chest, “This body you wear now is nothing more than a vessel. Your true body remains on earth, ripped apart and decaying. It needs to be rebuilt before you can be restored to life.”
“I was referring to the shaping of your body at your own hands, Dean.”
“Does it have to be right in the middle of my chest?”
There’s no way Dean is risking that, not after all the bodies he’d been put into by Alastair. “Don’t put me to sleep. I can take a little pain.”
The Angel is fire and death enclosed in a series of spinning rings, and Dean’s very being recoils from it. Its presence burns at those parts of his soul that have become less than, and his ears bleed at its shrieking song. His heart pounds at the sight, but he’s fighting to keep his eyes open, refusing to be so vulnerable in front of such a creature. The Angel reaches for him, and he thrashes against his bindings, but to no avail. A hand reaches through the tattered visage of his body, and his soul sears at its touch. The holy fire composing The Angel’s body surrounds him, tongues of it licking at his wounds, and he can do nothing to fight it. He is cauterized from the inside out, as the corruption of his soul and the blood on his skin burns away, leaving him clean. His eyes drift shut, against the pain or the light he isn’t sure. They don’t reopen.
“That’s not true.” The protest falls short even to his own ears.
Dean supposes that makes sense if you don’t think about it too hard, “That’s why everything’s all black?”
Dean starts talking more, after that. Castiel never fails to respond to him, which makes him think that maybe the silence was starting to grate at him as much as Dean. He’s become a ‘him’ in Dean’s head now too, which fits about as well as ‘it’ did, but it seems more polite. Not like Dean ever needs to refer to him in third person anyways.
“Leave it as it is.”
“You broke the first seal, Dean. Started the apocalypse.”
So it’s some God’s plan bullshit, which Castiel still follows to the letter, which pisses Dean off to no end. “Why not? It’s not like I’ll ever see you again after this.”
“Well… Damn, Cas, I don’t know.” If Dean had muscles he would squirm, “I ain’t given it much thought.”
Some body horror in the form of descriptions, as Dean is being built from the inside out.  Minor warning for discussion of trans bodies in regard to Dean's being rebuilt, hopefully nothing that should be upsetting. More detailed warning in the end notes if you're worried!
Dean would smile if he could, “Never thought I’d know what it felt like to have someone touching my bones.”
Try as he might, all Dean hears is the ringing in his ears.
“Those parts of your body responsible for the creation of hormones. I can’t sense from your soul what you would prefer for them to do, besides maintain your testosterone levels.”
“Unless... would you prefer I did otherwise?”
Dean is beginning to fade into blissful unconsciousness when the screams of The Angel shatter the walls enclosing him.
Dean has become used to this routine, to his work occasionally being disturbed by the presence of Alastair at his back. He will watch for a bit, and move to his next mentee. This time is different.
Castiel doesn’t respond immediately, but he doesn’t always, so Dean tries again. “Cas?”
Nudity hadn’t bothered Dean for years, is the thing. When you’re tied to a rack, with nitric acid bubbling in your wounds, being bare is the least of your concerns. Nakedness had barely registered to him for years now, but here he was, pulling on a pair of loose fitting pants and feeling as exposed as the day he was born. He’s human again.
His wings flicker, “You’re exceedingly easy to read. I have no need to invade your privacy to know what you’re thinking.”
A hand traces the edges of the print, “When I burned away the parts of your soul that had become demonic, it left a brand. This is the physical manifestation of that.”
Dean touches his throat, “This ain’t my voice I’m hearing?” his vocal chords don’t buzz under his fingers.
“There’s no need to be so upset. It’s different from demonic possession.”
“Huh.”
“You adjusted my hips before I even thought to ask.”
“You will see it in time.” And what the hell is that supposed to mean? Same cryptic bullshit he says to get out of answering every third one of Dean’s questions.
The silence is suddenly unbearable. “Heya, Cas.”
Dean does, somewhat reluctantly. Cas reaches three fingers in, taps the flesh at his lower jaw, and pulls them out. Dean’s tongue appears in their place. He sticks it out at Cas in retaliation.
The raven clicks its beak. “I only have to restore your skin now, and your voice.”
Cas pauses partway through building up Dean’s insides. “Your endocrine system,” he ask, “I don’t know how you’d like me to create it.”
“Why can I see you then?”
“Really? Because I’ve heard enough from religious nutjobs with real strong opinions about me and my sister, and I don’t care who you work for, I don’t want to hear it.”
The knife sliding over his ribs stills, and Alastair cocks his head. “Do you hear it?” he asks.
Cas bows his heads, “You won’t like the answer.”
“I believe she would be much better off with you there as well. You’re a good influence.”
“They’re here for you,” says Alastair, like always.
“Uh,” Dean looks down at the new scar on his chest, “What’s that about?”
The first strains of the Angelic Chorus begin to filter through the rings of Hell while Dean is on the rack, being skinned bit by bit.
Dean doesn’t have time to respond. Cas puts two fingers on his forehead, and the world goes black.
The bull looks down at him through its lashes, “Angels have no need for feelings. I have a duty to Heaven, and I intend to see it through, whether or not you approve. James Novak will be kept safe in my possession, and his family will be cared for. It is more than you can say of the people you save.”
All three sets of wings flare, and Dean feels himself come into being.
“You’re- what? All that and you’re dropping me back in a pine box six feet under?”
What Dean calls The Angel’s body is not really a body at all. It’s more a construct, composed of the same heatless flame that licked Dean’s wounds clean. It engulfs and is surrounded by a series of three ever-spinning rings, which somehow manage to avoid interfering with The Angel’s three pairs of wings. If Dean had ever bothered to research angels, he would recognize it as a seraph purely from these facts. A creature of fire, with a fondness for groups of three. But he didn’t, so he doesn’t.
A moment stretches on, with the new angel watching Dean, Dean watching the new angel, and The Angel watching them both. New angel’s eyes dart over to The Angel and back. In an instant, a dozen of its wings fold back to reveal dozens of hands that reach through the bars of the prison and towards Dean. He flinches back, but one manages to get a fistful of his hair and pull. He’s dragged towards the bars to be scrutinized, both by the eyes coating its hands and those on its wings.
Dean has no way to express his pain, but his soul must project it, since Cas backs off.
