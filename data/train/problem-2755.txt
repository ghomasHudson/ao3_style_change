John leaned forward even further and slipped before anyone could grab him.
His pillow is still indented from where John had lain his head. John's fragrance lingers on the pillow and the sheets. His bed smells like John. Sherlock takes a moment to press his face into the pillow and inhale deeply. The scent of John is mixed with that of Sherlock's linen, and Sherlock wants to smell this exact fragrance every day for the rest of his life.
From the corner of his eye, John spotted movement. He turned his head to look fully and recognized his friend, Mik. Mik was hurrying out of his own front door, though much more hastily than John and his father had that morning. He had a leather satchel clutched in his hands, top flap hanging free and swinging wildly, about to spill all of its innards unbeknownst to the distracted teen.
Then the empress was gone.

Harry glared down at John. “You promised not to fall in!” she accused.
Contrary to what John had expected, Mik actually looked relieved at John’s reply. “Hiring you as an assistant would be ideal for me, though I would like your assurance that you’ll give me at least a few days’ notice when you decide you’re going back to fishing. That way, I can get your help with the influx of cholera patients and have more time to continue research on my cure. And if you’re not my apprentice, then I can continue looking for one who can stay on long term.”
As calmly as he could, Sherlock maneuvered his way to the nearest cloth wall hanging and peeked behind it. There was nothing but stone wall there.
Wat motioned for John to stand back as he instructed Harry, who mostly already knew what she was doing, on throwing the net overboard. She grunted as she hefted the net and put her entire weight behind the throw.
“Oh, well, I don’t know.” Mik pondered for a moment. “I’ve only gone for a day, but yesterday we talked a lot about outdated healing practices, like bloodletting and ash tea medicine. I learned a little bit about leprosy and—”
“Papa,” John said, looking up at his father, “earlier, in the market, that lord… you said—he said—you said you would…”
Between both Sarah and Mik, the game from Sarah’s hunt were skinned and butchered in a remarkable short time. Sarah loaded the meat back onto her sled as Mik grabbed John’s arm and tugged him out of the room.
Mycroft scoffed and straightened. “Don’t be a fool. Jealous of what? I simply meant that you’ll never truly win the game if your opponent knows you as well as you know them. Your deductions may have been correct, but the only reason you still stand beside me instead of injured or dead is because the widow didn’t know as much about you as you did about her. Do you think she would have attacked you with such a weak spell if she had been aware of the strength of your wards? Her ignorance led to your triumph, and you would do well to remember that.”
Instead, he ponders the conundrum of needing something outside of himself, another addiction (this time, one he really could not control) that has begun to influence Sherlock, and seems primed to increase progressively as time goes on.

Jaituna’s gaze flicked momentarily to the cowering woman in the corner, a warning, before she took a deep breath and continued, “You and Mycroft are both my sons, but you are not like your brother.”
Wat exploded in laughter so raucous that John, still sitting in his lap, was rocked from one side to the other with the strength of it.
Sherlock admires John's silhouette. As silhouettes go, objectively John's is moderately pleasing. Subjectively, Sherlock finds it unnervingly endearing.
“Can you hear anything at all, Harry?” Wat asked, drawing out his words and enunciating clearly, allowing Harry to attempt reading his lips to discern his words.
Then, John imagined how it must feel to the boy on the elephant, feeling something so much more powerful trying to rise up underneath him. A great wave of force that could topple him and trample him at any moment, and yet he had bested it, was besting it, riding it, bending it to his will and feeling each monumental step as though it was his own. John was afraid, yes, but amazed and thrilled and jealous, above all.
“Your room is still there, for when you’re ready to sleep,” Wat offered, “I’m thinking its about time I turned in, myself.”
Sherlock had not quite been prepared for the heat of the food that he had feigned eating. He had only been half-heartedly listening and arguing as his nanny had tried cajoling him into consuming some sort of heavily spiced, fried mush which she insisted was a vegetable dish. He had eaten a spoonful before involuntarily gagging.
They caught up over breakfast. To John’s surprise, Mik had got a bit better at sharing the conversation and did not just chatter. He seemed to be genuinely interested in what John had done during his time away. Mik was still more than happy to talk at length about what running the clinic had been like after Dr. Vihaan had left, but he did pause for breath every now and again.
John, however, clearly has other thoughts on his mind as he continues to regard the wall panel. Sherlock knows that--unlike himself and very strange indeed--John is quite interested in puzzles even
. The positions we were born into place us on a pedestal, high up enough that it is dangerous if anyone should come to knock us down. Not only are we easy targets, a fall from that height could be deadly. Do you think we have many friends in those lesser than us? They will resent us and block us at every opportunity, even if we are trying to do good for the people. You can’t show any weakness, not even to those you consider your friends.”
When she returned to the front of the house, she passed John without a word and took a portion of the food. John followed her to the kitchen.
Please keep an eye out for my next piece (which is all storyboarded and ready to go!), "Sparks Fly!" Also JohnLock.
“I said, let me help you with the tarp,” John repeated, and began gently pushing Harry’s shoulder to encourage her to move away.
“That’s a wrasse, son. They come in a lot of different colors and are some of the most colorful fish out here.” Wat answered indulgently.
Mik looked up sharply at his name, though the look in his eyes was distracted. His eyes found John.
Sherlock had only just escaped the cobra, and the saw scaled viper, well… it did not look as if it would be satisfied with staring contest. The viper rose and turned toward Sherlock, clearly intent on coming closer. Sherlock scramble back, fingers clawing into the soft dirt as it gave way beneath his fingers, too soft to afford him any kind of speed.
There was another supplicant in front of them, though Siger had not given his attention to the woman since he was so focused on hearing Mycroft’s contentions. Once Mycroft had ceased speaking, it was only a moment before Siger noticed her and beckoned her forward to share her plight. Even as he did so, he gave Mycroft an indecipherable look and muttered something aside to him. Mycroft nodded and turned to lean down to Sherlock. As the woman began telling her issue, Mycroft relayed that his father had suggested a break after resolving this issue.
WARNING: Seriously for serious friends, this chapter depicts torture/severe beatings and is quite violent. Zero porn, I'm so sorry. But lotta mean mean bone breaking deathy violence. Ye be warned.
Sherlock is alone.
The woman, who had been getting progressively paler with fear and then redder with anger, screeched as Sherlock finished. She leapt towards him, muttering a spell under her breath. Sherlock reflexively flinched and Mycroft made a movement to raise his arm to shield his brother but aborted the movment. Almost instantaneously, the protective spells on Siger’s throne, which extended far enough out that Sherlock’s chair was in their range of defense, took hold of the witch. The spell froze her in place, while the protective enchantments that had been placed on Sherlock’s person since birth caused the spell she had cast at him to fizzle into nothing before it came close to touching the prince.
“That boy,” Jaituna said ruefully. “My poor, over-serious son. Though, that isn’t necessarily wrong, and you’re getting into real trouble these days, it seems, not like swapping the cinnamon with red pepper.”
The fish spilled out of the net and into the water of the basin. John marveled at them, while Harry and Wat’s nagging for him to be careful was just background noise like the hum of cicadas. The colors were amazing but the sizes, too. He had seen some of the big fish that his father and the other fishmongers brought to market, but none of them had been alive, twisting and writhing and splashing like the ones in front of him. The colors were amazing, but the sizes were, too, ranging from the fish as big as John to some as small as his hands. In that moment, John truly could imagine growing up and being a fisherman, side by side with Harry, seeing and feeling this every day. John thought it must be the best trade in the whole world.
son! And I love you,” Wat’s arms wrapped around John and pulled him into Wat’s chest. His warmth and scent were so familiar. Wat smelled like their house,
“Psh, yeah right. You’re a runt.”
“And good riddance,” Mik added when they had gone further down the hallway. “I hate butchering. I’m a doctor specializing in illness and disease for goodness’ sakes. I know it’s too bad that there aren’t any butchers in the district, but what’s that got to do with me, huh? Why doesn’t she just move somewhere else, then?”
“Oh, yeah, I heard about that,” John said, and Wat nodded in agreement. “Papa was hoping to get some grease from him before he left, but he told us that he planned to be here for a while.”

“Yes, and he’s taken me on to be his apprentice,” Mik said, voice pitched higher in excitement. John, who had known Mik for years and never known him to have an interest in the medical field, assumed Mik’s mother had her hand in this, also. “I’ve just started yesterday and I’m learning so many interesting things. Nothing in depth yet, off course. Vihaan says that book learning is most important first.”
“Ah, well,” John said sheepishly, then held a knuckle between his teeth in a nervous habit. Mik laughed.
John giggled at the thought and the results of Harry’s antics that night. His father looked down at him quizzically, though he did not pause in greeting Chala.
Sherlock nodded.
“Very good, my son.”

The emperor was seated in the empress’ throne, both of which were on a raised dais which allowed the rulers to peer down at their subjects even during the ceremony which was supposed to exhibit and reinforce just how accessible they were. Ironic.
Yet, one particular object had arrested John’s attention as he departed, or rather, the memory had arrested him. He had touched the anti-magic box, as he had for the last eight years since his father had told him of their family’s blessing. Or should it be their family’s curse? As he had reached for it, he could suddenly picture the moment again in his mind’s eye, as clear as the day it had happened. His confusion, apprehension, and trust in his father had all warred inside of him. In hindsight, it had not really been a choice; he could not deny his family their safety if it was within his power, sure, but at five years old he simply could not deny the authority that his father had wielded in anything. His father had phrased it as a question, asking John to swear to join in their little family ritual, as a courtesy and because he was kind.
‘It’s just a small thing, though,’ John convinced himself. ‘No need to be unnerved by it.’
He much preferred the soul and drama of the esraj, but no one inside the palace much cared for the opinions of the youngest prince. The spare.
If his mother was this perturbed, then the wine had truly been a close call.
John had only twice seen a noble come to the marketplace. John did not know much of nobles or royalty except for the stories he had read in temple books or heard by gossip. Even with only that, he could tell that the ones who came to the marketplace on their own were the poorer sort. More usually, they sent their servants.
(El Choclo Tango, violin solo.)
“Bye, Sarah,” Mik called over his shoulder, to which John did not hear a reply.
Of the necessities that came with their family trade, market days were John’s favorite. He loved the active air of the place: music played erratically, hot food sold by food vendors, seeing the various wares of the neighboring stalls. Everything was so colorful, so vibrant, endlessly fascinating or familiar. He disliked how, on particularly warm days, they had to cover the fish and be mindful of the freshness. On windy days such as this one, the fish also needed protecting from dust and other airborne nuisances. It was tedious, but it was not as if he had many options. He was to be a fishmonger, as his sister was, and his father before her.
Mik, who had never been much taller than John, had experienced a growth spurt of approximately an inch and a half in height, but considerably more inches in width. John was still waiting for his own growth spurt, and rather hoped he grew more than Mik had, and up instead of out. Mik’s face had filled out with the chubby look reminiscent of cherubs. It made him incapable of looking fierce. Even his glares, though they were few—he had mellowed some as he aged into his teen years, conversely to the rest of the adolescents in the neighborhood who seemed to aspire to be the next Harry, breathing fire and roaring loudly and being generally as irritable as a dragon—were not heavy like most glares. Personally, John felt that Mik’s sternest glare was akin to being glared at by a small river lizard, that is: small, without consequences, and unreasonably cute.
Nextly, I received valuable critique about Sherlock being a little out of character with his apparent instant attachment to John. I have a few reasons: 1) I am a hopeless sentimental idiot, so unfortunately he mirrors that a little. 2) My favorite view of Sherlock is sort of the mid series 2, post Hounds/pre Fall Sherlock, who grasps that John matters to him, who's still himself but more or less understands the give-and-take of having someone who cares about him. 3) This is AU. Sherlock if he chose to dance Moriarty's jig without totally selling his morality. He is softer than the real Sherlock, but not as soft as he gets sometimes.
Wat had been distracted for most of the night, since Harry had been mistakenly given the wine that the adults had been drinking. Of course, Harry had been able to tell that it tasted funny immediately, which only made her drink it all the faster. She had managed to finish most of it before Wat had noticed and, since she had been only twelve at the time, was uproariously drunk. Harry, at the best of times, was like a firecracker lit indoors. Tipsy, she was… better? Worse?
Both boys watched Wat go for a moment. John turned back to Mik to continue where they had left off. Mik spoke up first, still looking after Wat’s distancing figure.

“You constructed your husband’s murder, sabotaged his farming equipment until he accidentally killed himself. Made it so that you just needed to clean up the mess. You are a simply farmer’s wife and yet you came here with as much staff as some of the ladies who plan an extended stay in the palace do! You don’t like to get your hands dirty, and yet you had to dispose of your husband’s body. You allowed his body to rot on your land, but when the crops consistently failed, you knew he was taking his revenge on you.”
“Harry?” John’s quiet voice cut through the sounds of her fumbling and she jumped.
Try to counter the spell? How could he, when he did not even know what the spell was? He could guess, some kind of poison, maybe, or perhaps the drink was charmed. Maybe the pitcher was charmed to encourage aggression in the handler? He could not be sure. The possibilities were numerous, so regardless of the counter-spell he chose, the odds were very much against him. No.
Sherlock was small enough to wind through most of the other courtiers, most of whom appeared to find his behavior amusing, or at least they pretended to. He called for his mother, who he had only caught a glimpse of. That had been enough of an excuse to escape Mycroft, at any rate. Sherlock heard his mother’s voice call for her entourage to stop, which gave Sherlock the time he needed to worm his way through to her.
Sherlock pulled back from her and gave her a watery smile. Things were honestly not so different. He had always known that he was different from mostly everyone else. The only people he had been able to connect with had been his family and it was honestly sort of a relief to find out that there might be a reason for that, that it was not just because he was defective. As his mother rubbed his back, his gaze caught on his nanny, who was still shifting from foot to foot in the shadowed corner.
“What?” John asked, sharply. The entire empire? “No way… no way any one person has that much money!”
It doesn't matter.
“Oh, great,” Mik said, visibly relaxing. He returned to smearing jam on toast while he waited for the coffee to percolate. “How long have you been back?”
However, there were more pressing concerns at hand. Once Sherlock’s eyes had acclimated to the dimness enough to see the hall, he could see a set of stairs carved from the stone of the wall to his left. He ascended them rapidly, taking no care to muffle or silence his footsteps. However, it seemed that luck was on Sherlock’s side; although he burst from the stairway, the mage was too engrossed in his own task to notice Sherlock’s sudden appearance.
“Of everyone who might concoct a plot against us, a minor noble’s would be the least likely to be found out. They manage their own time and make their own schedules, for the most part. And they don’t have to deal with being surrounded only by people trying to manipulate them and use their political power, since they don’t have much to begin with. Sherlock, are you listening? You are old enough that you need to know of the dangers against you—”
At his hesitation, his mother drew back to study him. She followed his gaze and said, “Hadsana also knows about you. She was the woman who brought you to the palace. We honored her by keeping her on as your nanny.”
“Do not whine, Sherlock,” Jaituna’s voice was hollow as well, but the emptiness was a warning in itself.
) but the next time he deigns to acknowledge his surroundings, that is where he is. That's where he is and what he's done--but what does that matter? Why would that matter?

Siger made a show of waving a welcoming hand and gesturing to the newly appointed chair next to Mycroft. There had not been enough room for it on the dais, so it was lower and approximately a foot further back from the seats his father and brother already filled.
“The estate has wealth,” Mycroft corrected, “though it is not hers to command. If it was, would she have come herself, newly from the birthing bed? No, likely the majority of the wealth is in some commodity, not easily liquefiable. Their estate uses it to trade with their neighbors, but the coffers are rather dry at the moment. Unhappy marriage, too, see how the husband has not accompanied his wife to this hearing? Likely displeased with the child then, or rather, his mistress is displeased with him finally having child in wedlock—”
John shot Harry a look from beneath his lashes. While he had not expected to fall in, the water had been cool and comfortable. Being inside of the basin, fighting against the mini-currents caused by the other writhing bodies in the water was… refreshing. For a moment, John had felt as if it must be the best moment of his life. Harry, on the other hand, was looking plum-like again. His papa also looked a little shaken, so John decided he would try not to fall into the basin again. Still… no matter how much Harry glared or yelled, John refused to regret it.
Then John remembered something.
“Actually,” Harry mentioned, stiltedly, “I think I may have heard of that lord. Tupaina or something, right?”
Harry tried to whirl around to the direction the sound had come from but overshot and had to steady herself with a hand on the mantle.
Sherlock likes sound of that.
The climactic confrontation!
John smiled a bit at his friend, who had been talking nonstop ever since he had let John inside. John knew the last decade must have changed his friend in some ways, though it was somewhat comforting to see that the man was still a chatterbox.
“And then… and then he left her there, drugged and incoherent, prone and unable to fend for herself…”
“I’d love to have you around, John, but you can’t just disappear like you did before. I’m currently looking for an apprentice, someone I can train up in medicine as a profession. I do want to help you, but I can’t give that position away lightly. It holds certain expectations.” Mik conceded, hands clasped in front of him. He relayed the information while looking John in the eye, and John could tell Mik was trying to convey how important the matter was to him.

“Mycroft!”
John could not see much through the narrow doorway of the tanners. From what he could see, their stand and the one across the lane from them had begun to sway jerkily. As John watched, their table—which had been unevenly set up even in the morning and suffering under a load improved it not at all—buckled and sent the remaining fish an ice chips scattering. They hit the ground and trembled, too, but John could not hear them over the roar in his ears.
Sherlock followed the mage’s gaze to another servant. She had just left the taster’s table with a golden pitcher, the only kind used to serve his mother and father. The mage’s hands lowered and a satisfied smirk stole across his face. Sherlock could not see any physical change in the servant’s appearance, and a geas was impractical and could not be cast without looking into the recipient’s eyes anyway. The enchantment was probably upon the pitcher, then. No, certainly upon the pitcher and/or its contents.
"Mmrnph," Sherlock repeats instead of voicing the sentiment, eyes falling closed completely on John's answering smile.
“Sherlock, there’s… something you need to know—”
“Now that you’re both aboard, I can push off,” Wat said, hefting the plank on board and pushing it aside. Wat let down the sails but there was not much wind. They drifted slowly out into the river.
Becoming a fishmonger was an aspect of his future that was also set in stone. Their home was beautiful, as was the feeling of freedom that flowed through John when he stood on the bow of his father’s ship as it pulled into the brisk wind of the rivers. The fish they pulled in were healthy and abundant. Laughing at his father’s corny jokes and poking fun at Harry’s expense made each trip out enjoyable. He and Harry made bets on which river would give the best yield every week. For all that Harry had been fishing for years before John, she was still pretty terrible at making predictions based on the weather and moon calendar, so John won a lot. He enjoyed that, too. It was all enjoyable, very enjoyable, enjoyable every time, and yet… at some moments it just all felt so tedious.
By the time that Sherlock had finished, his mother wore an anxious expression.
“Oh, um, yes. My mother was recently able to convince the traveling doctor, Vihaan, to buy our old house and set up a practice,” Mik paused here, a little short of breath and unused to the swift pace the other two were setting. Wat noticed this and slowed a bit.
John did not understand it—why now, why like this—a tear welled in his eye at the words. He was depressed but relieved. Mik had told him the same things but hearing them in his father’s voice made them more real, like hearing his father say it made it more… true. Harry was going to be alright.
“Wat’s sons are home!” She barely paused a moment to cursorily scrape some of the mud off of her sandals before shoving the door wide open.
"Yeah, I get it. I'll leave you alone. We'll talk in the morning." John says. It's the last thing Sherlock hears before he falls asleep.
John looked back to his father, who was demonstrating the correct way to pull the bucket up so that John and Harry wouldn’t hurt their backs.
The pitcher’s contents—wine, Sherlock could see—splattered all over the servant and the empty floor behind her. Sherlock angled his chest sharply upward to achieve a greater distance from the floor. When he had achieved enough distance, his body was in a near standing position, and it was easy for Sherlock to simply cancel the spell, drop the shorts ways to the floor and land on his feet.
“Yes!” John exclaimed in joy. He wasted no time in running off down the street to find his favorites.
“You,” Sherlock attempted to infuse as much command as her could into his young voice, “come forward. No, not you, woman.” Sherlock amended as the supplicant had moved to approach.
“While that sounds stimulating, we really need to get the fish to the market before customers start coming through. I’ll go on ahead, John. You’ve been working very hard, lately. Why don’t you stay and talk to your friend a little more, then head straight to Harry?” Wat interjected before Mik could get momentum going.
Jaituna was too controlled to let the confusion cross her face, but Sherlock waited a hopeful moment and she exclaimed, Oh! Yes, I do. Did you want to do that?”
Sherlock wakes up alone the next day. Judging by the angle at which the sun is illuminating his floorboards, he has slept through the entire morning and well into late afternoon. What a waste of time, all those hours sleeping when criminals were getting up to crimes (hopefully some of them were interesting) all across the city! There is so much to learn, so much to deduce and unravel!
The pit was not deep, perhaps four feet, if not less. Sherlock landed hard on a roiling mass, but he could still see the night sky above him and the crumbling dirt of the rim of the pit. He instinctively dug his hands into the moving mass below him to find some stability. He could not see the mage, though the man could not have made it far in the short time since he had cast the spell. Sherlock listened for the man’s footsteps, to see if the man had continued running or stopped to see his handiwork.
Being dull was certainly no crime, but… it just was not what John preferred.
“What’s wrong? Why would anything be wrong, John?” Harry asked, acidly. “I’ve only been taking care of our handicapped father for the last six months, while you were off exploring!”
Chapter title is from the epic song "Scars" by Basement Jaxx. I'm likely to use lyrics from now on.
“Yes, mother.” Sherlock agreed, only somewhat begrudgingly. “Why are there so many people here?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sherlock spat acidly. “I just did exactly as we have done all day! What, are you jealous?”
The morning was temperate but dry, the slight breeze blowing dust from the yard over John’s feet as he crossed the threshold of his home.
John did not need to cut Mik off, it turned out. There was knock at the kitchen window that made the doctor jump. He and John turned toward the noise.
John was both anticipating and dreading the answer. He leaned in as Wat began to speak.
“Can’t you just not fall into anything at all, you little ninny?!” Harry screeched.
Wow, get some water for these parched souls, John thought. They look so thirsty, they may just pass out.
Outside of the palace, where he was rarely allowed to venture, his nobility was often such a novelty that the citizens fell over themselves to grant his every wish, even those he had yet to wish for. Inside of the palace, he was practically ignored. In all settings, adults spoke over and around him.
Harry whirled back to face him. She crowded him, jabbing her finger aggressively towards his face. She absently dragged the clay pot across the counter behind her, and John looked down at the scraping sound. Harry did not seem to notice she had done it.
John shrugged it off and slid his bag off of his shoulder. It contained all of the belongings he had been able to bring back from his post, including the souvenirs he had picked up for his family he had been unable to send by post when the fighting had escalated. He continued into the hall that led out of the sitting room, which was the main hallway of their home. Each of their rooms were situated to one side of the hallway or the other.
“What…” a voice came from behind John, but Harry was still rambling too loudly to hear it. John heard it and turned to the side.
3) Heads up, I've been in full-on Klaine fanfic mode, so anything just super out of character/weird here...I blame Blaine Anderson for getting into my head.
“How was the fishing today? Were you on the Beas river? I heard there was some flooding.” Chala asked his father, though she took a moment to look down and stroke the fuzzy wisps of hair over her baby’s forehead. The strands looked soft and thin, like black feathers, and curled prettily around Chala’s fingertips.
John held his Wat’s hand as they made their way home. The sun was still setting. Twilight was almost upon them, and the waning rays of sun shone bright red and orange across the grassy plains the family walked over. John squeezed Wat’s hand and leaned more of his weight against his father, focusing more on the play of light over the fauna around him.
By all rights, if Harry was sticking with the way their father had trained them, she should also be up or waking up soon. John suspected she would not be up for a while. She likely would need to sleep off whatever it was that she had drunk last night. It was a good thing that John had been sending all of his pay back home. He did not want to even think about what the state of the household would be like if he had not.
John kept his seed.
John’s little legs were ablur as he scurried to catch up to Harry who, being eight years older and in her tween years (which included a number of new attitudes, with a consistently overlying mood of impatience), hurried to catch their father. The lush green grass and soft moist soil cushioned his pounding feet, though it caused him to slip every so often. To John’s immature and admiring eyes, his sister seemed to glide across the flora gracefully, every step sure and quick.
Harry came through the down clumsily, and for a moment, John wondered if she had sustained injuries, too. Then she straightened, swiped a hand out to paw at the box by the door and entered the house. She shut the door behind her and began fumbling around on the shelf. John could only assume it was for a candle.
“I—I’ll tell you after dinner,” Wat rushed out, pushed off of the wall, and was gone inside before John could string together any more response besides his shaken expression.
Sherlock hisses, insistent.
“… Yes.” Jaituna replied, guiltlessly. “But surely you must see that the empire must come first, for all our sakes.”
"No, Sherlock," Mrs. Hudson says, slow and stilted, face an intriguing myriad of emotions: sadness, anger, fear, pity, and a few others Sherlock can't spend the moments it takes to detangle. "Oh dear, have you seen the news Sherlock? Maybe you should sit down. We can talk--"
The phrasing reminded Sherlock of Mycroft. The smile that curled his lips was involuntary, but he allowed it to stay there. The longer they stood here talking and hugging, he began to remember what it had been like before her distance. He remembered their little adventures and traditions, rituals and secrets that were only for the two of them. Mycroft appreciated Sherlock’s wit at times, but Mycroft could never understand Sherlock’s inquisitive nature the way Jaituna had.  Did. He truly had missed his mother.
John finished slicing and peeling the fruit for Wat and handed it to him on a plate. Because it was difficult for him to stand for long periods of time, Wat sat down to eat. He and John caught up with each other: John told him about the battles he had been in and how he had achieved his promotion Wat talked about the how the fishing had been lately—even though he had gotten all of his information secondhand from Harry—about the accident, and his recovery.
“I’m hungry.”
A lot of things were as he had left them, though there seemed to be an influx of people in his district now. Where his street had previously had two or three families with children, now there seemed to be a multitude. He passed a large group of them. There were fifteen to twenty children gathered there, playing a singing game. Besides the children, no one else was out. John thought it was strange that such a large group of children were out with no adults present but told himself that he had more important concerns. He continued on without a word to the group, though he nodded and smiled at the few who looked up to watch him pass. They watched him warily until he was some ways down the street. John turned back toward his destination and frowned.
The snake slithered out from underneath him. Sherlock’s palms came into contact with the soft soil of the pit and—
My spellwork is as advanced as my tutors can get. Well, some of they say they know more but aren’t comfortable teaching it to
Jaituna stared at him for a moment. Other than her eyebrows, which had risen a minute amount in surprise, her face was unreadable. Then, she burst into chuckles.
I was just promoted to captain. I’ll ask for leave as soon as possible. I don’t know when I’ll be able to get out.
“Perhaps the lord there is considering buying the marketplace,” Wat responded, hushed.
“Oh my gosh, why are you doing that? Now is not the time for games, John!” Harry’s tone was both angry and wobbly, like even her irritation was not enough to quell the monumental fear she had experienced recently.
“Very good, Sherlock,” his mother praised, and pet his head.
John was stunned and hurt. He had come home as soon as possible, and he had not been off playing around or whatever it was that Harry was getting at.

Darting past the mage who still stood smiling down on his mischief from the edge of the hidden balcony, Sherlock dived over the edge. Falling rapidly, he spoke the flight spell, but nothing happened. His abruptly movement on the balcony had drawn the gazes of many of the courtiers. A few of the less controlled people raised their arms to point in surprise and interest.

Author's Notes: I'm being a jerk and intentionally cutting this scene in half. I kind of want their first time together to be its own chapter. Cause I'm sentimental that way.
John mirrored the sentiment but found that he could not find his voice. Maybe he, too, was too shaken, like the pebbles.
“It’s Tufaena, get it right,” John teased weakly.
John's enthusiastic peal of giggles after this is Sherlock's first clue that his deconstruction may not, in fact, have been merely mental.
“I can do it myself, Harry!” John said belligerently. He walked up to Harry, finally even with his sister now that they had stopped.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft called, clearly trying to draw Sherlock into interacting with young Lady Tufaena. “Sherlock!”
“His imperial majesty requests your presence in the throne room for the Hearing of the Public Grievances.”
Mycroft made no such effort to hide his ire. His voice was sharp and cold, “Must you persist in being obtuse, brother? Every moment of life in this castle is part of the game, every interaction with someone else another move on the board. Small victories can be fun or diverting at times, but the real object of the game is to have and keep your power. Those with no might behind them do not survive, Sherlock.”
“Mummy, I've gone over it multiple times in my head! Why did none of them try to bite me when I landed on top of them? I had startled them; I could tell. If any one of them had bitten me, I could have died, and yet none of them even tried. Until the saw scaled, but then the cobra seemed to defend me which is even stranger… I don’t understand, mummy…”
“They are here to support Mycroft. Remember, his birthday is less than a month away. Preparations for the celebration have already begun.” There was pride in the empress's voice, a tone that he rarely ever heard her use when speaking of anything but her empire. “Your brother is a very important man and already people wish to curry his favor.”
“So, what brings you here, John? I would have thought you would be out fishing already?” Mik asked as they cleared away their used dishes.
As John exited the shop and returned to take in what remained of their stall, he stepped over bits of debris that had fallen not only from the temporary stalls but some of the buildings around them.

From that, Sherlock could tell that Jaituna was still somewhat ambivalent towards Mycroft's betrothed, the young Lady Tufaena, though from what he had heard his parents say on the matter, it was not because the empress particularly disliked her. The same could not be said for the girl's father, Lord Tufaena, but for reasons other than the marriage or, at least, in other reasons in addition to the marriage.
Sherlock calls Mycroft.
“It’s the farmer,” Sherlock said in a hushed voice as shock caused the arm he pointed with to waver. “He’s still there with you. Why won’t he leave? Sentiment? But then, why make the crops fail?”
“This is my cousin, Sarah,” Mik said, waving Sarah and the sled by so that he could lock the door behind her. “Sarah, this is my old friend and new assistant, John, son of Wat.”
As they left, Sherlock noted that Mycroft’s eyes followed the apprentice’s departure. He smirked at his brother. The movement drew Mycroft’s eyes to him.
Harry unearthed the candles from further down the mantle and lit several. She declined John’s offer of assistance as she went from room to room and lit the lamps. She spent a greater amount of time in their father’s room than the others, though not by much.
John could barely think past how thrilling it all was. Being on the ground during an elephant stampede—his heart was
His doctor. His.
John gingerly pushed the door to his father’s room open. He opened it slowly, so as not to startle his father if he was inside, all the while thinking of other places his father might be, if not in his room. Perhaps John should check the garden next. It was possible, with such a great injury, Wat may still be residing with the village doctor. John hoped that was not the case. Out of all of the desires he had for his return, he primarily wanted to find out that Harry’s recounting of his father’s injuries was an exaggeration.

“No! You’re my son,
“No, of course not. I’m simply making a point. Don’t be dull,” Mycroft snapped.
“Mycroft,” their mother said reprovingly, though the hand she raised to briefly cup his cheek was gentle, “what a state you're in. You know better. Chasing your little brother around the castle?”
, that’s a whole different thing.”
John hoped that he would come home, see that his father was not as bad off as Harry had stated, then take a quick bath and fall into bed. He did not have it in him to do much else. He had slept in the caravan that had returned him to his district, but the trip had been turbulent. He had gotten a nap, at best, and he had quite a bit of sleep to catch up on.
John tried the clinic door, only to find that it was still locked. He knocked on the door. A few minutes passed before he heard the sound of the lock being undone. A drowsy Mik opened the door. It was clear that he had only just woken up. His eyes were barely open to slits and, although he was dressed, he still had his nightcap on.

“Run the household?! How dare you come back and say you’re going to run the household.” Harry fairly screeched. This close, John could clearly see her now: her stained clothes hanging loosely off of her, the splotches in her cheeks, her uneven stumbling gait…
Also, it's 2am, I'm exhausted, and my eyes won't stay open. Couldn't edit, I'm sorry.
John could see a boat in the distance. He wondered if that was his father’s boat.

“I… The reason he said…” Wat tried again, stiltedly trying to find his words. “Your mother…”
Sherlock tries not to sigh. He won't sigh over John, in John's presence. Perhaps one or the other, but not both. He does have some pride. Mycroft's voice echoes in his mind, telling him to have some composure, but Sherlock swiftly represses it lest he be tempted to whine at volume and/or strip and cast all his clothes out of the window at a crime scene simply to spite his brother.
Once he was level with the box, he noticed the carving around the lip of the box. Tiny flowers woven intricately in a chain bloomed in a circumference around the box. There were small chips of colored glass inlaid in the wood for the petals and the leaves and vines had been painstakingly painted with a delicate green dye. The blossoms, though miniscule, looked almost lifelike. The shine that reflected from the bits of glass made them look dew-kissed, like John had seen the grass and bush flowers were just after dawn.
Sherlock turned his face away from his brother again, though Sherlock worried it might be pointless to try maintaining an unaffected façade at this point. Ahead, in their path of travel, he caught sight of a bustling group of courtiers, likely abuzz because of someone important. He and Mycroft were still too far away to identify who it was.
Mik joined their brisk walk and genially clapped John on the shoulder. John closed the satchel for him and Mik chuckled.
‘Curious,’ John thought, as he walked past them.
Mycroft was seated in their father’s throne, looking peering down his nose at the current supplicant. He was wearing a complicated expression, both benign and condescending, which had the unfortunate effect of having his nostrils flared wide. Unfortunate. Wait, was it unfortunate? Why was it unfortunate? Sherlock thought it made him look like he had a sinus condition.
“Yes, your son is back home,” Harry said acidly. Then, she closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and visibly tried to rein herself in. John imagined it had to be difficult to accomplish when her face likely burned from liquor and she seemed to lose her balance immediately when her eyes were not open. “Are you hungry, papa?”
And here's the entire thing!
The line is silent for long moments. Then, Mycroft explains.
John wanted to be up there with him. It was dangerous, sure, but the elephant was huge, larger than life—a titan—and what was danger compared to the feeling of what that must be like? John had felt small before, but looking on this he had never felt bigger, looking at what this small person was doing—
“A lesser noble truly has the most advantages.” Mycroft continued, taking a deep breath for calm, “They are allowed to keep a small staff, which affords them privacy, unlike us. They may not have all of the wealth of other lords or ladies, but they have the most mobility, able to come and go anywhere without raising suspicion or expectation. Surely, you must see that there are certain downfalls of imperiality. You, out of everyone, must see that.”
There was a young woman outside of the window, standing at the side of the building and peering in at them. Her dark blonde hair was pulled into a sensible tail at the back of her head and she was dressed in drab dark brown clothes. When Mik saw her, he released an exasperated noise.
Comments are love!
Mik’s eyes opened wider as he saw who had arrived, and John watched the man furiously rub the sleep from his eyes.
She followed his frightened gaze to the tree. “What is it, John?” Though she didn’t need an answer because she saw it then. John remained silent but slipped his tiny hand into hers, holding tight.
“Go to sleep, your highness,” Hadsana—Sherlock decided he would actually remember her name from now on—cajoled him. Maybe he would even do as she bid him to do… once in a while… when it was convenient.
“Accipiter gentilis,” Sherlock turned in his seat to speak in the direction of Mycroft’s ear.
A half-formed expression of confusion flitted across Harry’s face but was gone in half a moment.
John remembered now that although Mik was a fairly friendly fellow, he could be high-strung and whiny at times. That side of Mik usually came out when Mik was forced to do something he did not like, though it was many times worse if his mother had been the one to force him into it.
“Your mother, Emma,” Wat said, “was kind and capable. When I first met her, in was in another district. I had just been passing through and say her, a young woman dressed in a bright yellow skirt kneeling in the dirt to help a horse that had lost its shoe.”
“There isn’t too much time before I should start expecting patients,” Mik chattered as he showed John to a small table and chairs in the corner of the room. “I’ll certainly have a minute to catch up with an old friend. Though, oh—”
As if there need be any greater punishment than the dull, repetitive, platitudinous experience of everyday palace life.
Warning: There is some brief description of animal butchery, just a couple of lines. I tried to keep it vague so that it wouldn't squick anyone.
“Well come on then,” Harry shot over her shoulder, drawing John’s gaze away from their father. “You have to learn so that we can be the best team of fishers to ever have fished! They’ll talk about us far and wide!”
John, looking through the narrow doorway of the tanners, saw another elephant thunder past at a remarkable speed. The next one had a person riding on it.

“Really?” John looked up at her, shocked, then back down to the peach pit which he eyed dubiously. “Is this really a seed?”
“Six months!” Harry interjected, but John continued as if she had not spoken, though his voice became a bit more strident.
As John approached Harry, he noted that she had mostly finished setting the stall up. It leaned to one side more heavily since the posts that supported it were set unevenly in the ground. John went behind their stand to retrieve the trestles in which the fish would lay, to set them on top of the stand.
John’s words seemed to shake Wat out of his reverie and he cleared his throat to reply, “Uh, yes. They said… they said she can probably come home in the morning or afternoon at the latest, though she may need some care over the next few days. Harry was pretty upset, almost hysterical, so they gave her something to drink, something to calm her down. Doctor Vihaan burned some herbs for her that were supposed to help her ears. I’ll… we can go back for her in the morning.”

Jaituna was frozen for a moment, her face blank. Abruptly, she drew Sherlock into her arms and held him tight. He was surrounded by her warmth and her floral scent as she embraced him, and it was enough to finally leach the tension from him. She pressed her face to his hair and her voice was wobbly for the first time he could remember. After a few moments, he felt her tears dampen his hair and understood the shakiness of her voice. His answering embrace was hesitant, but then it became strong, and he hugged her as tightly as she held him.
Sherlock glanced up at him, and then back down as he formed his reply, “But, no, she is clearly wealthy—”
“Mummy, are you saying that I can go to learn about foreign magic in another land?” Sherlock had to be sure that he was understanding correctly. This was not the time to allow wishful thinking to influence him.
John knew that he would never consider Tufaena his father. The man was nothing but a monster. He was like the beasts in John’s books, preying on the innocent and the good. The authorities had the responsibility to take care of citizens like him and his family. It stung that they had not only condoned the attack on his mother, but that they were likely still dirty, corrupt and being paid off by the very person they should be prosecuting. Even dealing with the other revelations of the night, John could not stand the thought of the grievous injustice that had been dealt to his family.
The clinic kitchen was clean and small for the size of the building, though it was larger than the kitchen in John’s home. The counter appeared to be made from some sort of pale stone, and the brick oven was set into the wall, likely attached to a network that allowed it to heat the entire building during cold seasons.
Sherlock followed a short way behind the servant as the man made several turns down different hallways. The man paused at the turn of the next hallway, seemed to listen intently, and then took off running. Why run, Sherlock wondered, if you were innocent of all wrongdoing? Sherlock had not even been chasing him and, even if he had, he was not exactly the scariest person in the palace, being 11 years old. The action smacked of guilt, of nefarious intent or behavior. With that in mind, Sherlock chased after him.
John was brave. He knew he was brave, but one day he would be brave like Harry. When he was bigger.
“No,” Sherlock said again, more strength in his voice this time. The snake’s gaze was still connected with his, and then suddenly—
“Sherlock,” Jaituna began, stiltedly, “What is that mark on your arm?”
He was going to be just like her someday. When he was bigger.
. Why? Why him? How? How did other people put up with the endless barrage of uninteresting things? Did the drudgery of it all fail to penetrate their vapid consciences?
Harry waited a moment to be sure that Wat was finished, and then rapidly shook her head from side to side, tears falling from her eyes and flowing in wayward paths down her cheeks due to the momentum. Wat pulled his sobbing child into his arms and tucked her head beneath his neck. Wat looked over at John as he tried to soothe Harry, and John could see the moment his father came to a decision.
“You realized you needed to move him, get him completely off of the land, so you bleached his bones, then hid them away into the animal bones going to grind in your neighbor’s mill. You hadn’t known beforehand that your neighbor’s runoff was coming onto your land because it had not made a difference. But even after you had disposed of your husband’s remains—”
Sherlock abhors the amount of sentiment he is subjected to in these current days, abhors how his perfect subjugation of his emotions has been corrupted and overridden.
It had been years since his mother had last visited Sherlock’s rooms. Her regal presence seemed to fill up the space differently than it had when he was younger, before he had learned the pretensions that were required of the royal family at court. It had been so long since Sherlock had interacted with his mother in private; it was difficult to look at his mother and only see her as that, not the empress she had to be in public. He had the novel feeling of being nervous around her. Thankfully, she broke the silence first.
“You’re staring, brother.” Sherlock teased. “What, see something you like?”
Mycroft had also straightened in his seat. His posture was stiff and straight, but Siger maintained the same condescending air, presenting a façade that seemed both benign and impartial. Sherlock could not tell if his father was feeling what he felt, but perhaps Mycroft had been.
John had never known their mother; she had died while birthing John. Though he had never met her, she was still such an important part of their family—mentioned often enough at home and with her belongings still scattered here and there around their cottage like pearls on the ocean floor—that her presence had never really faded.

Wat reached out to ruffle John’s hair the way he used to do when John was much younger. John could not remember the last time he had done so, and it suffused him with a warmth that did a lot to wash away the coldness of his worry over Harry.
Wat chuckled softly, a single short sound that sounded sort of sad. “I guess we’ve had a pretty busy day, huh?”
The marketplace itself was one long street, wider than most others. There were buildings on each side, inns, apothecaries, and other merchants of the like. In front of those permanent shops, other sellers set up temporary stands to sell their wares on certain days, such as Wat and his children did.

Excitement thoroughly concluded, Sherlock jumped at the chance to escape the tedious duties. He practically leapt from his chair. When he would have literally run for the door, Mycroft wrapped a quick hand around his arm and escorted him from the room in a more stoic manner, befitting their station.
“He’s not that old.” John was slightly offended on his father’s behalf, but not enough to sound defensive, “And yeah, he’s fit I guess, but you’re really just saying that because you get tired and out of breath so easily.”
“Careful there, John. I’m mighty hungry and if I don’t get to eat some almonds I may have to eat a little boy instead,” Wat said, pseudo-menacing as he held out his hand for the almonds. “Why, it looks like there are enough here for all of us. Why don’t we have a snack and break before we start heading back?”
Sherlock could not imagine what his mother could possibly be about to tell him that required such a grave manner, but he said, “I promise, mummy.”
Sherlock raised his arm to inspect the area she had indicated. There was a bright red splotch on his arm, like a sunburn, though it did not hurt at all. He belatedly realized that it was the same place where the servant had spilled the wine on him earlier. He mentioned that to his mother.
“Alright then, go on and change into your nightclothes, my little sher. I’ll go and find a good book.” His mother offered.
Mik’s face seemed to cool a bit, but his reply had an acerbic tone, “Who wants to spend their whole day hitting a ball of rags with a stick, John? I want to know more about the world outside of our own district. I want to know what the emperor is doing, like… My parents have been arguing with each other, lately. My papa says we might be going to war, that one of the lords is so wealthy he might try to take over the whole empire.”
John followed his father into the sitting room. He sat and waited while Wat lit the lamp in the room. When that was finished, Wat sat beside John. He looked distracted, gazing at the far wall and never even glancing toward John, who was staring so fixedly at the side of his father’s face it would likely begin to sizzle at any moment. Wat cleared his throat once, and then again, before he found his voice.
Mycroft’s betrothed—Sherlock did not know her name—was pale and waiflike. Sherlock thought she looked weak. For all that he had not taken Mycroft seriously when he had bemoaned the grave dangers of court life, Sherlock could not fathom how someone as frail as she was would survive being empress. A maidservant had needed to alert her to Mycroft’s presence even though he was practically standing over her, and even when she did acknowledge him it was only with a sickly smile. His mother’s voice broke Sherlock from his perusal of his future sister-in-law.
The possibility that he might find something thrilling had revitalized him, until the convoy had reached the plains. He had been disappointed, at first. The plains were just that: plain. Flatland and scrub, dry and dusty, for as far as his eye could see. But then, on the outskirts of civilized land, or at least as far as the heir of the empire was allowed to go, there had been an elephant breeder eager to showcase his herd to the crown prince, and Sherlock, well… anyway, now he was being punished.
Sherlock thought that Mycroft had said the word ‘child’ with so much distaste that it could not possibly still be considered polite, but no one remarked on it. Lady Tremaine inclined her head in acceptance and favored Mycroft with an exhausted smile. She curtsied to them and left the room, business apparently concluded. Siger shot a dark look at his sons, which Sherlock knew meant they had better behave or Siger would try his best to make them regret it later.
“Highness…”
“John, I told you to be careful,” Wat said with a frown as he beckoned to Harry, who was already on her way back to them with a canvas tarp. Wat set John on his feet and wrapped the tarp around his drenched son.
“What have you been learning,” John asked, turning back to address his friend. “Anything that could be useful for us?”
Sherlock could not understand what she meant. There were obvious dissimilarities between him and Mycroft, though he was certain his mother would not stoop to saying something so obvious, so… “Are you talking about that rumor that Mycroft is not papa’s son?”
Sherlock ran as fast as he could, breathing hard now, but the man was still lengthening the distance between them. If Sherlock did not catch up soon, he might lose sight of the man. He followed the man to a small enclosure in the garden, walled in by hedges higher than Sherlock was tall.
“That was when I was 17 though, Mik. I’m a militia captain now—I definitely know what responsibility is. Not to mention, I’ve become much better at predicting the consequences of my actions. You can trust me.” John cajoled. Mik looked dubious but nodded. John knew that Mik probably trusted him as a friend without a doubt, but as an employee for Mik’s business, one who had let the man down before, John had something to prove.

Arranged marriages were not uncommon. Siger himself had arranged the marriage, though it had been an affair carried out between only him and Tufaena. Much to the empress' displeasure, she had only heard of her own son's engagement after the documents had been signed and sealed. The entire ordeal had taken place around the time Sherlock had been born, and even in all the time that had passed since then, it was still an underlying bone of contention between the imperial couple.
One of the vendors had offered to deep fry some of their fish for them, if they would share with the vendor, and John promised he would relay the message to his father. In addition to all of that, one of the vendors, a young woman who worked at the nearby temple and blushed more than anyone else John had ever met, had sent Harry a love package of mutton tikka—and John could not help but be a little jealous. Why didn’t he have paramours who sent free food—and some kebabs, though John had run out of space to carry them and had shoved the ends of them into his mouth instead. He did not think Harry would want them after that treatment, and John giggled internally as he imagined her annoyed reaction.
John felt a sting of disappointment and looked behind him, at his papa. However, before John could complain about it, Harry’s hand landed on his shoulder and pushed him slightly across the deck.
“You’re drunk,” John said darkly.
John tried to further rationalize what had just happened. That man had called him a bastard, but maybe he had been looking at Wat? No, he had definitely been looking at John. It didn’t make sense. It was nonsense. It was so much nonsense that John found himself suddenly breathless in the fervency of his denial. He tore his gaze away from his father to look back out at the street, where the marketplace activity was resuming.
