He focused on Mitch now, picking and choosing where to place the cuts. Tiny little nicks that barely drew blood earned him small, gasping moans. Deeper, thicker cuts with pooling streams of blood earned him guttural groans escaping Cas’s lips. He was teasing Cas. He knew Cas enjoyed getting covered in it, absolutely soaked, so Dean was carefully avoiding any areas that might spurt blood far enough to reach where Cas was seated mere inches behind Mitch.
Cas growled and shoved Dean back, causing him to fall back against the bed. He followed quickly, stripping his boxers and socks off, dropping them to the floor before crawling over Dean and roughly unbuttoning the man's jeans.
Cas slid his chair directly behind Mitch, and began undressing. He left his boxers on, dropped his clothes in a pile outside of the mess zone, and took his seat, leaning back in the chair. He loved being directly in the action, close enough to watch everything with a detailed eye. Dean was a master with a blade, and when the blood spurted, there was no better feeling than the hot sticky warmth of it hitting against him and dripping down his own skin.
"They were just talking about you on TV, angel." Dean greeted him and huffed a laugh as he shut and locked the bolt to the motel door, as well as sliding the chain into place.
A picture of a dark haired blue-eyed man in a trench coat with a long silver blade in hand flashed onto the screen. He was looking directly into the camera and smiling, a splatter of blood on his cheek. Dean traced his finger across the screen, hesitating over the man's lips.
"Close." The only word Dean could manage to groan out between thrusts, a one word request for permission.
"One...two...three...four….five…" He smirked as pride bloomed warm in his chest. He exhaled a chuckle as the video focused in closer on some of the FBI agents looking disgusted or scared, he couldn't tell which through the grainy image.
“We still have six whole days, angel.”
“Why him?” He asked, distractedly. He never really cared why, but he knew it was important to Cas, so he always made sure to ask. A good husband always supports his partner’s interests, afterall.
Dean pressed down, puncturing the thick vein leading through the man’s soft skin, and watched as the blood spurted up, coating his hand and casting a few drops onto Cas’s thigh. Cas moaned deeply and tightened his grip around his cock, turning the head a deep purple color. He stroked slowly, reveling in the friction and tightness his fist created. Dean watched the skin slide up and down with Cas’s fist, the slow but incredibly sexy pace lighting Dean’s veins on fire with desire.
“Oh Mitch is a real treat, honeybee. Multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault, as well as rape. But of course, a rich, white, 20-something college student couldn’t have anything like that on his record, so daddy had them all wiped clean. Didn’t he, Mitch?”
"Cuyahoga, Dean." Cas smirked. Dean's gaze was steadily affixed onto Cas's every motion, following him toeing off his shoes, and slowly unbuttoning his slacks. He pulled the zipper down notch by notch, drawing it out, enjoying the heat flooding onto the man's face.
Dean pressed his face into the pillow, his hands clenched on the top of the mattress, knuckles white with the force of it. A small moan escaped his mouth as he rocked back on his knees, purposefully pressing his waiting hole against Cas's knuckles as they slowly pumped his cock.
Dean loved Cas’s intelligence, his planning and plotting. He knew that Cas was the brains of the operation, the one responsible for choosing their targets, abducting them, choosing the locations, and eventually, of dumping the bodies. He was a mastermind on how to leave just the right amount of trail to be noticed, but not enough to be caught, and Dean often found himself staring in awe and wonder, trying to figure out how he’d gotten so lucky.
"FUCK, angel…" He cried out as the last of his release dripped over his fingers and onto the bed beneath him, knowing that Cas wasn't far behind him.
He continued making small cuts, moaning with each one, enjoying the white hot pain he knew was slicing through Mitch’s flesh. Cas pumped his cock with vigor, his hips leaving the seat on each thrust up into his fist, squeezing and milking his dick. Dean could tell he was close, Cas never did have the stamina when it came to watching him work. He enjoyed the mess, the screams, the chaos. He loved seeing Dean in his element.
He slowed his pace, dragging his cock out until just the head remained inside, teasing at the rim, before sliding slowly back in. Once he seated himself deeply inside pressing the tip of his cock against Dean's prostate, he rocked his hips, grinding against him. Dean let out a low moan, soft and building, feeling the pressure increase. He reached beneath himself and grasped tightly at the base of his cock, attempting to stave off his impending orgasm.
Dean slowly traced the knife down along the edge of the man’s arm, not inflicting any damage or cuts just yet, but allowing Mitch to feel the cold steel press against his skin and anticipate the next move. Dean loved this part, when the victim’s adrenaline would start pumping, their heart rate increasing, causing their veins to bulge and pulse. He loved watching the cold sweat break out on their skin, the goosebumps rise up as if attempting to shield his body from the incoming pain.
He glanced over Mitch’s shoulder and made eye contact with Cas’s too-blue eyes, staring into the intensity of them, and pressed the blade against the man’s forearm with just enough pressure to puncture the skin, causing a single thin stream of blood to ripple out and streak down his arm. Cas moaned and grasped his cock through his boxers tighter, encouraging his erection to grow.
Mitch’s eyes grew wider as he realized what was happening behind him, and he again started to scream against the gag, thrashing against the chair and bindings. Dean tsk’d at him and shook his head, pushing the tip of the knife deeper into the vein, attempting to blow it open wide. Mitch screamed out, throwing his head back and twisting in just the right way that caused enough pressure, and
The blood gushed up and splattered across Dean’s hand, coating it in the thick warm liquid. His eyes glanced towards Cas and saw the desire blow his pupils wide as he vigorously stroked his cock in a ruthless manner. Encouraged not only by the sight of it, but by the noises both Cas and Mitch were making, Dean began eagerly slicing into Mitch’s arm in various locations. Not deep enough to cause him to bleed much more, but just enough to have the blood pucker to the surface and draw out Mitch’s screams of agony.
Cas gripped the man's hip, his fingers bitting in, deepening the bruises that had been left from this morning's antics. The pain shot through Dean in the most delicious way, a mixture of heat and lightning.
"Yeah, that one. Goddamn I love Thursdays…" His eyes were large and greedy as he stepped forward into Cas's personal space, hooking his thumbs through the belt loops on his slacks, and pulling them down over the man's hips and thick, muscled thighs, letting them drop into a puddle on the floor at his feet. He licked his lips before biting the lower one, leaning in to press his nose against the corner of Cas's jaw where it met his throat, deeply inhaling the salty scent of blood and sweat.
“There you go, buddy. Relax.” He chuckled darkly, placing the tip of the small blade under the man’s chin and lifting it so that Mitch had to look him directly in the eye. “The more you struggle, the more excited I get. Your choice.” He winked at the man and laughed deeply as his eyes grew large and horrified at the idea.
“Thank you, honeybee.” His voice was soft, loving. He was filled with gratitude and awe at what Dean had given him. Dean dropped his head, taking the tip of Cas’s cock into his mouth. Being very careful with how sensitive he knew he was, he carefully sucked and licked the cum that had dripped onto his length, gathering it in his mouth, before leaning up and kissing Cas deeply, letting him taste his own release. Cas moaned into Dean’s mouth, their tongues sliding together, his cum bitter and harsh against the warmth of Dean’s kiss.
*****
Dean's eyes flew open, letting out a howl, his knuckles white on the headboard, desperately holding himself in place. He truly loved the control Cas took in these moments. They never, ever had bad sex. But the sex they had Thursdays after Cas had disposed of a body, and abducted another victim? It was intense, to say the least.
"Now, Dean. Come for me." The demand in Cas's voice was clear, the power in his words felt through every nerve ending in Dean's body.
Dean sighed happily before rolling onto his side, throwing his arm over Cas's chest and snuggling up under his arm, resting his head against the man's shoulder. After a quiet moment, Cas turned his head and kissed the top of Dean's, nuzzling into his hair.
Cas grabbed hold of both cheeks, spreading them wide, enjoying the sight of the tip of his dick peeking in and out of Dean's ready entrance. When Dean relaxed and allowed himself to open slightly, pulling Cas's cock in just a bit, Cas groaned and slid in deeply, fully to the hilt in one smooth stroke.
Dean dropped the blade on the floor and let his eyes roam over Cas’s body. His tanned skin, the muscles rippling with the effort of jerking off, the sweat dripping from his brow, the blood flecked on his thighs. He was beautiful. The precum was beading at the tip of his cock and Dean moaned at the sight. He took his hand and smeared it through the blood on Mitch’s arm, carefully collecting as much as he could, and then kicked the man’s chair back away from Cas’s, far enough to fit between them. He kneeled directly in front of Cas, lifted his hand and pressed the warm liquid against Cas’s chest, slowly sliding his hand downward, leaving a bloody trail along the man’s stomach.
"Fuck, angel, just like that." Dean gasped out. He hurriedly began stroking his cock, grasping it tight and rough, enjoying the painful friction he caused. He could feel his orgasm building, his cock swelling and pulsing. He pushed his hips back, meeting Cas at every thrust, using the momentum to fuck his fist with passion.
“Dean…” The warning in Cas’s voice was clear, and even though Dean wanted to play more, he knew exactly what Cas meant from that single word.
"Mmm, can't wait, angel."
He released Dean's hips and collapsed onto his back, pushing him against his own wetness covering the bed. They laid there like that, Dean pinned beneath Cas's muscular weight, gasping for air and allowing their heart rates to return to a calmer pace. Cas reached down and slowly slid himself out of Dean's ass before rolling off of him and lying on his back next to him on the bed.
At Cas’s words, Mitch began to thrash in the chair, desperately grunting against the cloth gag in his mouth, likely attempting to defend himself, or his actions. But it was useless. Dean knew that Cas never made a mistake, and even if Mitch wasn’t guilty, it mattered little to him. This was his turn, his time, and he intended to make the most of the next six days.
"Already prepped for you, angel. Need you." Dean's words came out in a pant. Cas clenched his jaw and grasped the edge of the plug, slowly twisting and pulling on it, carefully teasing him without removing it.
He traced the edge of the knife towards the man’s elbow ditch, twisting it a bit to create a slight mark, but not enough to break skin. Cas leaned forward, pushing his boxers down to expose his hard and flushed cock. Dean groaned at the sight and lost his train of thought for a moment, too focused on his perfect husband’s perfect dick, hard and waiting for him. He glanced up at Cas’s face and saw that single eyebrow arched, a silent demand.
"Mmmm tomorrow's your turn, honeybee." Cas placed a kiss against Dean's neck and smirked as he felt the man's heart rate accelerate. He wrapped his arms around Dean and grabbed handfuls of the man's ass, pulling their bodies flush together. Dean's breath hitched as he felt the hard outline of the man's cock straining at the fabric of his boxers pressed between them. He reached between them and softly palmed the growing erection, teasing it through the cotton, toying with the wet spot forming at the tip of his dick.
Cas pulled the plug roughly, enjoying the soft
The best thing about dumping near water is the vast availability of unattended warehouses located right on the water’s edge. It makes it incredibly easy to store, torture, and kill someone, all within 100 yards of where their corpse will be disposed of, without having to worry about anyone discovering you.
That was all Dean needed.
"Is that so?" Cas's voice was mocking, teasing. Dean's head jerked up and looked back towards Cas, his face blushed red. He nodded once before biting his lower lip and moaning, a not-so silent plea for more.
“Sorry, angel.” He smiled at the man, trying to relay without words how much he loved this adventure they were on together. Refocusing, he cast his eyes down towards the man they had tied to a chair, deep in a back room of an abandoned boat storage warehouse on the oceanfront.
“You’re not going to enjoy this. This will hurt. You will scream, and cry, and beg. And just when you feel that you’ve had enough, where your mind and body simply cannot take any more… I’ll keep going. You’re going to die here, Mitch. And you’re going to feel every moment of it.” Dean’s grin split his face as his eyes lit up with excitement, eagerly watching as Cas became half-hard beneath his hand.
"You'll come when I tell you to." Cas's hips snapped, pulling back and plunging himself deeply as he returned to his rough pace.
"Sleep, honeybee. You'll need your energy for tomorrow." He felt Dean grin and kiss his neck with a contented hum.
Cas dove in deeper, setting up a harsh and hurried pace. He slid one hand up to Dean's hair and grasped tightly, snapping his head back and away from the pillow.
"Cas," Dean whined, panting the man's name through moans, "Come on, harder, please, harder angel…"
He remembered showing Cas some of his favorite old horror movies.
bikini on, and there were a lot more rock posters. Also, it stunk like ax body spray.
“Stop being so goddamn immature!” Mary scolded. “This is serious!”
“This isn't some
When Dean woke up, he got ready to storm Cas again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I hear family angst, who's leaving me out?" Dean walked into the library, a shit-eating grin on his face.
“Nephilim!” He shrugged, then he furrowed his brows. “...well, kinda. It's confusing now...but this won't hurt me! I promise!”
“So, you still know me well, even when I’m soulless.” He purred. Footsteps were heard, getting near him.
Cas didn’t respond, as usual, and Dean let out a rough, garbled laugh as he stopped leaning against the wall.
“And why isn’t it?”
The most striking feature, however, was their eyes.
“Why'd you just spread your wings when I talked to you?”
He was close- just five feet away.
Ben looked at him, his green, hopeful eyes glistening- hardened with determination.
“HEY! Not for you!”
Sam's face was bright red, and the two stared at eachother for what was a good five seconds. It felt like years, but it didn't feel like it was long enough. Despite that feeling, Sam coughed awkwardly, shoving Gabriel off and standing up, attempting to wipe all the red Arizonan dirt off of him(and scoffing in annoyance because he knew it'd stain). Gabriel was coated in dirt as well, and stood up right after the human did, clearing his throat and nervously chuckling.
-----------------------------------------------------
Hey!! I'm so sorry this plot is really goddamn slow but it's getting somewhere I sWEAR.
“I wanna come with.” He purred. Dean cranked his head to face him, and then looked at Cas.
“Am I the ONLY one in this base who needs sleep?” Mary groaned, rubbing her temples. She sighed at looked at the three boys. “Okay, this conversation doesn’t matter. Change of plans, Cas you stay here and watch Dean. Sam, get dressed and come with me, and do everything I tell you to.”
Dean knew Cas was dead, but Sam was starting to get really, really worried for him.
Dean groaned a bit, wanting to up and pass out on the snow right there. Everything was still spinning, and everything
He remembered showing some cowboy movies, too.
“But-” Cas started, but shut up as soon as Mary gave him a warning glance. He looked to the ground, but quickly drew in a sharp breath as he felt Dean's arms latched around him.
Eventually, his body seemed to untense- his glazed-over eyes flickering back into focus as if he woke up. He lowered his hands, looking around.
“Like
“Lets go kill some testicle monsters.” He smirked. Mary rolled her eyes.
Dean narrowed his eyes, and cocked the gun once again.
he's been sleepwalking like that, he's been damn curious to understand it.
“They're still cookies, Jack.”
Dean grabbed his gun that he had dropped once again, and aimed.
He walked into a room that had a few crosses on the walls, along with shelves of angel statues and frames with bible quotes in them. Perplexed, Sam walked towards a shelf with an empty spot on it.
Sam put his head in his hands.

“Trust me, we wouldn't really endanger a kid's life,” Dean spoke.
“I know you like I know my own mind.” Dean cooed in return. “Now, do you want to do this the easy way and be a good robot and obey? Or do you want to be a bad little terminator.”
“This is a lovely house,” Jack spoke, looking around curiously. Dean nodded, and Ben laughed a bit.
“Oh? But I’m not toying, Castiel.” He purred. “I want me a slice of angel cake.”
“Normally i'd root for the underdog kids who get bullied, but you are one nasty, messed up witch.” He snarled. With that, he squeezed the trigger, firing and hitting her between the eyes with a witch killing bullet.
“One more time, Sam. What isn’t okay?”
“See? What'd I tell you? WAY faster route!”
I have a LOT planned for this fanfiction, so please just stay tuned during the hunts they go on.
Dean gets captured.
Before he could finish what he was saying, Dean opened his mouth, letting out a ton of black smoke. His body went limp, and his soul escaped out the room quickly.
He realized he was sitting there for a bit too long when he heard the sounds of clanging and banging from downstairs.
This chapter isn't as pleasant as the title implies.
“Sounds good.” He said, and accidentally dropped the pencil.
He broke into a cackle.
Sam whispered. Dean didn't respond, and Sam knew he was still...
The witch went limp, and then fell to the ground as the overwhelming power the demon felt began to ebb away.
Then, the ringing started.
“Hey, I've only ever hated cats because they made me sneeze my brain out.” Dean replied in a mock-sharp tone, casually acting as if Pudding didn't just jump into his lap. “Cats are way cooler than dogs.”
Before he walked into the road- cars zipping by.
Sam swallowed a bit and shook his head.
“Is that what you’re trying to tell me?” He wheezed out into the freezing air. Cas was standing under a street light, staring at him through a band of static. “That I’m made of glass? I’m WEAK?”
“I still like it better when you chose your words carefully. Y'know, actually try to sound like Sammy. Not some nut-job of my brothers empty corpse.” Dean chuckled.
you to be polite when at someone else's house. You aren’t barn animals.” He huffed out a laugh, walking in. “Are those actually cookies?”
He felt something get caught in his throat.
“Oh! That's my Adderall.”
“So,”
He just felt lucky that Dean could drive with both his hands behind his back and a blindfold on if he wanted to.
“I was simply curious. I had little to no exposure to human interaction.” Cas growled. Dean slowly rose up from his chair and strut over to Cas, slowly walking behind him and then leaning into his ear.
He blinked, and his black eyes returned to green. Soon, the power was replaced with exhaustion, and Dean slowly ran his fingers through his hair and looked back to his family.
“WHY THE HELL ARE YOU COVERED IN BLOOD!?” Mary exclaimed, horrified. Dean shrugged.
“Bad. Don’t attack your family, Dean.” He growled. Dean hissed in pain and eventually calmed himself, ceasing his fidgeting and thrashing in Gabriel's arms, and now panting as he stared at Sam. Gabe laughed nervously.
“After I had taken Sam's memories of hell and then snapped out of my coma, and I was, you know…” he licked his lips nervously. “I uh...I tried to fly a very cute cat to Meg at some point, however it reacted very poorly.”
“Right. Anyways, Cas y- ...what are you doing?” Dean rose an eyebrow when he looked behind him, seeing Castiel's wings had suddenly spread open as Dean addressed him. Cas blushed slightly and sat back in an obviously fake-comfortable fashion.
Warning for talks about death, puking, and accidental self-harm.
He scoffed a bit, thinking about how Dean did the exact same thing for Cas.
But he shoved those down and locked them away. He didn’t want to break down.
“They've probably been out for days.”
His stupid, rough-n-tough brother- he wondered if that's why he started nesting the second they got the bunker.
They got into the car and Mary forcefully buckled Sam into his seat, and began driving down to the address she received from the vic’s files. She turned down the music in the car when Sam dialed Cas’s number and clicked his phone to speaker.
Did I self insert myself just so Dean Winchester could shoot me in the head, killing me instantly? Yes, yes I did.
“Kid, you could go to college, still. You could fall in love with someone and get a job, get a house, have a family. Anything but a life like this.” He looked into his eyes, sighing. “This job can get you killed in the span of a week.”
Also, every morning, someone would walk inside with him, and he was always covered in snow.
“I’m never letting you go again.”
“Do not try that again, Dean. I’m not afraid to hurt you.” He growled, using his old angel-in-command voice. Whatever she was dealing with, Castiel hoped Mary was having an easier time working with Sam.
Before he could finish, the demon was pried off his brother, spitting in confusion and rage. Once Sam recovered, he panted and gazed around until he saw Gabriel, struggling to hold Dean as if he was some pissy cat. Castiel ran in with the squirt bottle, spraying Dean with holy water.
“You grabbing anything cool?”
No one fucking does that to Cas. No one, especially some witchy sonofabitch with clever ideas.
“They uh- I just can’t really bake.”
A friend is found dead. Sam gets dragged. Dean gets convinced by a monster.
“Why do you need us, cockmonkey?” Dean slurred. Crowley chuckled,
Dean has to make tough moral decisions to save the day. Cas gets embarrassed. Sam's fussy. Gabriel's gay. They adopt a cat.
His sleepwalking was getting more dangerous, and since he told him
Dean rolled over onto his side. He was freezing, but he was burning.
Life with Demon Dean is...well... hell. What is to expect when he comes back as a demon? He lies, cheats, steals, brawls, and argues just for the amusement of it. He'll steal Sam's books just to see his face when he can't find them. He'll openly lie to Mary because he knows she can tell, and he enjoys seeing betrayal flicker in her eyes. He'll cheat at any poker game with Crowley, because it's always amusing to trick the king of Hell. And as much as Cas hates it, he'll surprise attack him at random moments. Sure, Cas felt lucky that Dean never tried to badly harm him, but it was annoying to be carrying two coffees to sit down with Mary and study a case when suddenly- boom! A black-eyed way-too-handsome man jumps from out of nowhere and spills hot liquids all over you. Demon Dean is sadistic, selfish, and almost always smiling in the most forceful yet charming way.
God, he missed that light.
At one point, however, Mary caught them leaving.
CLANG!
HELLO EVERYONE AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!! I'm really not someone who likes to celebrate on main, but I've been feeling a little sentimental recently so here we are! It's 11:28 PM on December 25th, I worked hard to upload this "on time" so here you go!
Maybe he was just seeing things.
“I thought you said he was sleeping!” Mary hissed at Sam, who held his hands up in defense.
But this time, surprisingly, Cas was sitting on the side of his bed.
“Dean! There you are!” Cas breathed.
“Dean refuses to turn the volume down on the pornography he's watching.” Cas huffed, sounding very stressed out. “Anyways, this is a very perplexing case and I’m not sure what could’ve caused it. I’ll do some research about the lore, but I don’t know, this strangely feels familiar- DEAN PLEASE STOP LICKING A DONUT SUGGESTIVELY AROUND ME IT’S MAKING ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.”
“Well, that's taken care of.” Dean breathed, looking around.
“Whatever. Lets just go do some research and gank whatever did this. Got any ideas?”
“Hell no, you’re not going on another hunt without someone sane.”
Mary walked into the kitchen with Sam on her tail, and stopped abruptly as she recognized Dean laying on the table, passed out. An entire bottle of Fireball was empty next to him, along with multiple beers.
Sam went home passed out in the back seat of the impala, being laughed at by Dean while Mary drove in absolute silence.
sign on the front, as well as a
“It’s a bit early for that, don’t you think?” Mary said slowly, calming down from thinking her boys snuck out and murdered innocents.
He regretted a lot of things he’s said to Dean, actually. While he’s been pissed at him before, he never really noticed how much he did for him, how much he loved him, until he became a demon.
“Oh I'm digging, all right! I'm digging just how perfect you look, even when you're covered in dirt~!”
“You mother fucker!” He spat, charging at the angel. Cas started rapidly shooting water at Dean, who yelped and flinched back.
“We’re home!” Called Mary, walking into the bunker. From the kitchen, Cas was heard groaning a tired greeting.
“Don’t worry kid,” Dean reached under his seat, and then pulled out a bag of McDonald's. “We’ve got you covered. Nothin a good ol’ Micky D’s can't fix.”
Once again, he heard a weird, frankensteined sentence made of his own voice, words he's said before.
“...what?”
"Alright, let's go deal with this case." She said, slipping her fake FBI badge into her jacket.
The sensation of ‘flying’ with an angel is something that was always interesting. As Cas placed a hand on Dean's shoulder, he felt as if an entire bag squeezed around him tightly for a split second, until they landed, and the sensation was gone within seconds. He felt Pudding fall off his shoulder, and looked at the ground, bursting into laughter.
He opened the bag, digging in and shoving a fistful of fries into his mouth. Claire stuffed her hand into the bag, and Ben whined.
Ben gets introduced to the bunker.
“Okay, let’s save that talk for when we’re at the house, there's no need for me to crash the car cause you wanna Veronica Sawyer the kid.” Dean cleared his throat, and Ben was thankful for that, because first of all, he didn’t want to argue right now, and second of all, he wanted to eat his burger.
“Sam! Grab the gun!” Mary exclaimed from the floor, crippled on it after a werewolf had slammed her down. Sam lunged for the gun with silver bullets, and aimed it at the werewolf, who had now grabbed a teenage girl and held her in front of himself. He had his claws wrapped around her throat.
“Fine. Jack, sit on the ground again.”
HELLO!!! NEXT CHAPTER IS GONNA BE A CHRISTMAS CHAPTER!!! :D The rest of this fic wont be holiday themed i swear.
“Cause I’m older than you and so is Ben.”
A new case arises, and the brothers start to hide things that they shouldn't hide.
With that, Jack took a bite of the violently burnt
“We found a vamp nest.” He stated casually, walking over to the fridge.
“We killed it.” He replied, opening the beer and drinking from it.
Next to him, Sam heard a tiny snarl. A young girl attacked him, baring her fangs and sobbing. Sam shot her with blood, causing her to scream and fall over.
“Yeah” He muffled through his burger. He then swallowed. “I need to get a few things.”
“I swear, you have the liver of god.” He growled. Dean laughed.
He wanted to see Cas’ big, blue puppy eyes more than anything right now.
‘“Y'know, I really wish you cared.” She breathed. Sam looked down at her and tilted his head.
“...I mean, is it really an interest if you...don’t do that?” Dean shrugged, leaning against the bed stand. “...what's RSD?”
Sam had asked him
“I mean, I wouldn't really mind it, as long as he's okay with staying in the bunker and occasional long car rides if we take him on hunts.” He stated hesitantly, as if he was embarrassed.
Kaia let out a scoff. “Can either of you eat any faster?”
HOLY SHIT SO!!! HI GUYS IM SO SORRY FOR NOT POSTING FOR LIKE A MONTH LMFAO. I've actually been working on this a lot, and tbh this chapter is twice as long as normal. I'm trying to plan the rest of the plot of this, and knowing SPN and how much lore goes into it, that means research. Lots of it.
Now, Sam has seen people sleepwalk, he has experienced himself doing it, even- he was little when he did it, Dean always getting up from bed to guide Sam back to his with a glass of water, but the way Dean acted here…
“I do care, though.” He said slowly. Mary huffed and shrugged.
“Perhaps we can keep it? Cats are far less trouble than dogs, and this one is quite intelligent.” He rasped, ignoring the fact that Gabriel was still laughing at Dean's cat-like symptoms. Sam looked at Dean with a doubtful expression, but was surprised to see that the demon was wearing a thoughtful face. He scratched Pudding casually behind the ear and nodded a bit.
Sam stepped forward. The werewolf buried his fangs into the girl, and she let out a bloody shriek.
“We need to burn and bury the body,” Cas stated, nodding towards the witch. Dean nodded.
“Who are you?”
“Please make it the former.” Cas breathed in exhaustion, hanging up. Sam shoved his phone back into his pocket and looked at Mary.
Gabriel adventures with Sam through his mind. Dean pretends hes fine despite being stabbed in the chest by a weapon purposely made to kill him.
“Hello, may I take your order?”
Dean kicked forward, a newfound adrenaline pulsing through his veins as the memory was forced through him. The witch yelped and fell back, covering her now bleeding nose. As she was stunned for a few seconds, Dean grabbed his gun bolted over to the net, and attempted to hack through it with a knife.
Ben was sitting in the back, crammed with Claire and Kaia- Jack laying on the floor of the car.
“I meant what I said, Cas”
his genetics, then he’s the height he should be. Dean was smaller than he was supposed to be because he barely ate anything as a kid, as much as he and Sammy both pretended that wasn't the case.
“You died, and my idiot brother didn’t know how to save both your corpse and your soul at the same time.” Gabriel shrugged.
“Because it hurts their feelings and it shouldn’t be funny.”
Dean gets all of his parts together, and one more that he never got back.
and you do everything you can to research more about it or find content with it.” Ben looked at him for a moment, before going back to packing.
“Adderall?”
“Why didn't you land on your feet?” Dean smirked cruelly. The sphinx narrowed his eyes.
He stared at something that wasn't there.
Hey!! Long time no update.
“So...what're we gonna do with the cat?” Sam asked, gesturing to Pudding- who was laying on Dean's lap.
“Dare you to eat one,” Claire smirked at Jack, who blinked.
"Oh, hold on lemme change." Sam perked up from behind his book, now getting up.
I also painted a scene from last chapter!: https://randomgooberness.tumblr.com/post/638333567031738368/last-night-at-4-am-i-got-the-sudden-uncontrollable
HELLO EVERYONE, I'M NOT DEAD! I've actually been working my ass off on this fic, and I'm stocked back up on chapters! I need to stock up a little more, but basically, I'll just update when I can! I have animatics and a webcomic I work on as well, so I'm very busy, but I still very much love this story!
Besides that, though, he didn’t...mind this life. Apparently, the brothers and Jack had a bunker of their own- and Claire stayed at a cabin with a woman named Jody. Kaia had apparently moved in recently, too.
Two certain characters aren't coping well.
“Honestly! You'd think most witches would be strong enough to cast a stick spell onto their bags!” The witch laughed. “It may just be me being a clever Ravenclaw and all.”
“I didn’t think he would just leave like that! He’s probably with Sam, though!”
Sam was fun, too. Like a weird uncle. He was probably the healthiest out of them all- he went on morning jogs, he ate things like salad and healthy stuff in general, and he checked in with Ben a lot to make sure he was okay. It was a bit annoying, but he kinda appreciated it.
A lot of the time, he would goof off, crack random, witty shit or talk about stupid things he’s done on a hunt. Other times, he’d get annoyed by things- which was funny, too. He knew every lyric to every Led Zeppelin song, he knew the ins and outs of his car and everyone else's, and he could name any cowboy or horror movie based on screenshots.
“Got it.” Dean replied, walking out before anyone could say anything else. Sam felt a bit suspicious over this ‘favor’ Crowley was doing...but he said nothing.
Not to mention things like guilt or fear of being abandoned or rejected- aka the name for it. You do anything to avoid it, you kinda become a people pleaser.”
“And if anything, it’s…”
He opened his mouth as if to say something, but
The inside of the room was different- more mature than before. One of his old Pokemon posters was replaced by a
Sam was knelt down next to him, eyes still round with worry.
“Sharing is caring, Braeden.” Claire smirked, grabbing a fistful as well and absolutely going to town. Ben glared, and grabbed his burger, unwrapping it and stuffing as much as he could into his mouth.
This chapter is lowkey boring I am so sorry
He sped into a quick-walk by the time he saw the impala, and once he was over there, he was basically running.
“I’m not a Knight anymore, Sam.” He finally replied. “I don’t have the mark anymore, either. I’m just like a normal demon now, hell I could die from a demon blade if someone took a swing at me. That's probably a stupid thing to tell my terminator brother, but that's not the point.” He rambled, scratching at his head. “I’m just as easy to fight as Meg or Ruby or some shit. There wouldn't be a point in trying to leave.”
“It looks like it crawled out of Purgatory's asshole!” Dean hissed. Sam scoffed a little bit in amusement, and Pudding narrowed his eyes.
“Yeah, sure, I'll have a double burger with a side of fries, no salt.”
about it, Duff.”
“Hey, um,” He cleared his throat. “Isn't...isn't that dangerous?”
He bolted upwards almost immediately, seeing Cas and trying to run after him, but Cas seemed to be just out of his reach.
Sam turned to see Ben walking over, brows a little furrowed. Dean followed him, gazing around.
for, Ben?”
“You need to stop being adorable, Cas. You're gonna give everyone a heart attack.”
Lying there, was a fake mustache. Something about it made Sam uneasy, and it seemed familiar… Interested, Sam picked it up and put it into his coat pocket. He then headed back downstairs to report the nothing he had found to Mary.
“He flirts with everyone when he's like this!” He squeaked. Sam rolled his eyes and started to walk out the room.
“Don't think I haven't seen how you act. You’re just as fidgety and distracted as I am, Dean. So is Claire and so is Kaia.”
This morning he found him out in the snow again- this time in the parking lot. It was surprising because he
“Damn, even soulless, Sammy is still your bitch!” Dean laughed.
“Whoops.”
“We’ll be home in an hour or two.” Mary reassured the angel, sighing in slight frustration over her two sons.
Sam entered Lisa’s room after a while of searching and pacing about.
The young witch walked over to pick up the gun, bending down.
“Awe, I want a house like this.” Kaia sighed. Claire let out a laugh.
“Don't say that while you're shirtless, please.” Sam cringed slightly.
The car started driving, and Dean cleared his throat.
“In this economy? No.”
“More than anything.”

“What...the hell...is that.” Dean growled, pointing to the cat.
“Y-yeah?”
They were now in the hotel room, just how they had left it. He grabbed the car keys out of his pocket and headed out the door, allowing Pudding to scramble back onto his shoulder. Cas followed behind them quietly.
“Dammit, lets just go check out the house again after the crime. Maybe there’s something we missed” Mary scoffed, getting up and walking to the garage. Sam sighed and followed.
Sam struggled to remember what Dean looked like when he was real little, but he’s always struggled with those little sparks in his eyes. He wasn't sure when Dean lost his innocence, but he knew he should’ve been learning the differences between UpperCase and LowerCase letters instead. The light was always getting dimmer and dimmer, flickering a bit as Dean reignited the fuel with alcohol once he turned 14, but it was always
So, seeing Ben, wide-eyed, shaking from loss but still hopeful? It felt like a stab to the gut.
“Okay, sure, whatever.” He muttered. He walked into his room and took out the mustache from his pocket, looking at in in interest and confusion. He was interrupted by his phone buzzing, however. He took it out of his pocket and read a text.
The voice of a young waitress snapped Dean back into reality, and he looked up, grinning as if he hadn't just been having a mental break down.
He stood a moment longer and knew exactly where it was.
It was bright and early, and they were indeed driving.
He unlocked the car and hopped inside, turning the key in the ignition and smirking as it revved up as Cas sat into shotgun. He turned on some loud rock music and pulled out of the driveway.
No response.
“...and that is…?”
Sam raised a brow, and let out a bit of a laugh.
“How’d you even start this intense alcoholism, anyways?” He asked in what sounded like a rude tone. Dean hesitated.
“What? Don’t you like porn?” Dean shouted over the sexy music, a shit-eating grin plastered on his face. “Remember that one time you watched it with us?”
Ben looked up to Dean, tilting his head a bit, before turning and seeing what he was talking about.
Dean laughed and shook his head, grinning in amusement.
Dean felt hands grab him by the shirt and then yanking it off, taking the hex bag with it and freeing him. He saw Sam, still shaky from the spell work cast on him, throw away the shirt to the ground and help his demonic brother up. Cas had run over to the witch with an angel blade in hand, grabbing the smaller girl and putting it to her throat.
than others.” Ben walked across the room, grabbing some stuff from a drawer. “Emotions are physical, like an insult feels like actual pain and sticks with you for
“And?” Cas asked. Dean grabbed a beer from the fridge and shut the door, eyeing Cas.
Ben looked around, sighing a bit and shaking his head, before walking over to the staircase. Dean had to bite back a laugh when he noticed he still did the stomp thing he always did when he got to the top of them. Clearing his throat, he followed up, too. He could hear the rest of the gang clamoring about.
“Sure, why the hell not?” He said more firmly, smiling a bit. “What’dyou think about living with some hunters, buddy?”
He popped open the door, only to see Claire in his seat.
I swear there's a plot to this fanfiction somewhere, it's just drowned in stupid jokes.
Life with Soulless Sam is tough. He's unpredictable, violent, and careless. Try to talk about feelings with him, he's indifferent. Try to explain how insults can hurt people, he doesn't understand. Try to tell him 'no, we can't kill that person just because the monster is using them as a shield, that's not okay', he is confused. Don't get him wrong, he DOES try his best! He just can't understand empathy like normal humans. He can't understand why having blood on your hands is a bad thing.
“Oh COME ON! It’s funny, soul or not!” Sam replied. Cas sighed and didn’t intervene the argument, pretending to be very interested in the table.
“Are you kidding me?” Pudding purred. “I'm the best cat you could get for a job like this!”
“You're an idiot.”
Sam stayed up this time, watching Dean with a laser-sharp focus.
“How many are left of you?!” He spat. The girl sobbed.
Dean sat up, eyes wide open. Sam sat up, too, watching Dean, waiting for him to get out of bed, but...he didn't this time.
“I don't know any of you.” Kaia shrugged. Claire grinned.
“Oh- it's a sphynx cat!” Sam exclaimed. “They're hairless, and they're actually supposed to be really smart. They're great if you're allergic to cats, and they don't even smell!”
WARNING: EXTREMELY DETAILED AND INTENSE GORE.
Sam tried not to think about the fact that he knew, he
The pain never stopped feeling as shitty as it did. He almost found it ironic, the whole glass ankle thing...Like he himself was made of glass.
He missed him with every heartbeat, every step, every blink and swallow. He missed him each time he saw a blade of grass and a drop of snow. He missed him, holy shit he missed him.
Dean had actually straight up forgot he was shirtless, and just shrugged. He walked to the back of the impala, opening the trunk and grabbing gasoline, salt, and a lighter. He walked back up next to Cas, grinning.
“Th...thank you. F-for saving me.” She sobbed. Sam aimed the gun.
Ben frowned at him, and Claire smirked, walking over to the fridge.
He wanted Cas there, god he wanted Cas there.
“Shit.” He grumbled. “The food there was like...annoying little shrimps.”
We’re here
He didn't know for how long this went on, but eventually, he snapped into consciousness in the exact same position.
So here you go.
“Dude.” Sam growled sharply, nudging his brother and giving him his signature bitch face. Dean smirked at him and sat down at an empty table, Cas piling in next to him and Gabriel piling in on the other side with Sam, who seemed to sit straighter in an uncomfortable and awkward manner.
CLANG!
Blasting,
Sammy was staring at him, wiping the blood dribbling from his mouth away and panting. Cas was wincing and healing his vessel where he had been burned, frowning at his ruined jeans. Gabriel wasn't even pretending that he was helping during the fight, he just leaned against a tree and stared at Dean.
“Okay, awesome. So we wait until schools out, then we go track the witch.” Dean said to Sam, who nodded.
Epilogue.
Sam rolled his own eyes, sighing and laying back down, but still keeping a watch on his brother.
“Four men were found with their testicles bitten off, two of them died in the process. We talked to the other two, and they both described seeing a humanoid figure before being knocked out. When they woke up, they were in a house and injured. Any thoughts on what it could be?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gabriel ended up leaning too far forwards, drawing in a stiff breath as he tumbled forward once the shovel under him gave out.
Cas seemed to go anywhere he wanted during these like he just wanted to avoid Dean or something. There was no pattern. This time he was heading out into the street.
“He was!”
“Dean, please use headphones when you’re watching something inappropriate like that.”
“You're possessing a human, therefore you have the ability.” Sam replied bitterly, narrowing his eyes. “I gave you a shovel, so get to it!”
Cas: https://randomgooberness.tumblr.com/post/637237540641013760/the-third-member-of-team-free-will-gay-angel
“What do you mean?” He rasped awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. Dean chuckled slightly and turned back around to focus on the road.
Sam nearly folds the t-shirt and places it next to the other shirt as Vanessa throws the paper on the coffee table and grabs the last present.
Vanessa cuts Dean off. "Dean, I have a car, I am currently loading it, I know how to fucking drive Dean, you don't need to come and get me, I'll be fine."
"Please..please...please" Sam pleads as he covers his crotch with his hand, hoping that Pluto doesn't step on it with his long, sharp, knife-like claws. Dean moves closer to the armrest of the couch as the large dragon moves closer to probably lick him. Instead, he nestles himself between the brothers, one wing-arm off the couch the other is curled underneath him. Pluto lays his tail cross Sam's lap and he rests his head on Dean's knee, his horns safely a few inches from Dean's side.
When he watches the last girl drop to the floor, her light ginger hair now stained a deeper red, he shoots awake to find a pair of blue eyes staring at him.
"You don't even know the best part," Sam says, hiding a from with his mug.
They quickly finish their food and throw away their trash. Once everyone sits back down they start talking about their plans for tomorrow.
"Wow, that is impressive," Dean says over the music. The sound of wing beats barely make it over the music, "what did I walk into?" Castiel asks.
"No, no thanks, " Dean replies.
Vanessa laughs, "yes, you can touch them, you've touched my gills so of course, you can touch my scales" Vanessa offers him her arms, "luckily they're not as sensitive, "
Sam puts his hands up and smirks. "Dean," Castiel nudges him with his wing, "it's your turn."
"Anytime."
"Thanks, Nessa," He swallows down another sip. "Where is Sam?"
"Oh, hi Dean" she turns around to face him "you look nice". Her dark brown eyes bore into his own, and he can feel his face heating up as he looks at her outfit. She's in a white sundress that reaches her knees, a small belt is wrapped around her waist and she has a pair of black flats under her arm. "You okay?" She snorts.
Dean clears his throat, "sure they are, I've never noticed when your eyes turn yellow, some of your scales appear on your face."
The blonde vampire gives her an odd look but she shakes her head. "Wow then, we hit the jackpot, "
He unlocks his car and yanks the door open, he throws the bag into the empty passenger seat and slides into the driver's. Dean closes the door and rests his head in his hands.
Wanting to watch some of the lightning, Dean stands away from Baby and watches the sky. Thank god it's not cold out, otherwise, they would've camped indoors and made smores on the cookie-scented candles that Sam got him for that one birthday, but this is much nicer. Granted he got bit by a dozen mosquitoes and lost a marshmallow to a squirrel, Dean would say he is having a wonderful time!
While they wait for dinner time to roll around, Dean suggests that they escape the heat by swimming, to which Vanessa quickly agrees.
"Nessa," Dean mumbles and reaches out and touches her arm. "You're so loud."
"It's two more gifts than I usually get," Vanessa shrugs as she grabs for the biggest one, which is from her dad. "You didn't get me any more gifts, did you?" She turns to Castiel, who shakes his head no.
"You gonna cum for me angel?" And as soon as she finishes that he explodes all over her hand causing the lamp light bulbs to explode and shatter all over her stuff on the bedside tables.
"Well then, we'll just have to do some research on it, until then I am going to go and take a much-needed shower then probably sleep," Sam says, glancing at Vanessa.
Sam sighs, looking up from his laptop from where he sits on the motel's bed, to his brother. "Exactly why we can't take a day off Dean, we have to interview the witnesses again, not go to some zoo."
Dean stands straight and turns back to the stove, but not before stealing a piece of the pancake and earning a death glare from Tim.
"Anyway, so I'm making a pie? Got it," Dean says, making a mental note of the ingredients he'll need for a classic cherry pie.
"As I said, we don't really do much for my birthday, just sleep in till lunch then eat as much as we can before we pass out from it." Vanessa picks at her nails.
Almost as if something large is falling from the sky. Curiously, Dean looks up now realizing that he hasn't heard any thunder in the past few seconds and it's been pretty constant. As soon as Dean looks back at the tent the whole forest gets bathed in light as if the sun immediately rose.
"There," Vanessa mumbles as she finishes her bun, "I'm sure, plus I can't keep these two outside since the heat and not inside alone, they tend to eat stuff like my couches and pillows."
"Man, you're good at singing," Dean says as he takes the last bite, "and the food was delicious." Dean stands up and stretches, taking his plate and finishing off his tea and putting them in the sink, he walks over to Vanessa to kiss her on the head than goes back to the table to sit and watch her work.
"Tim?" Tim says, he tilts his head as he stares at Dean (he has been doing a lot of that).
"To find your mystery thing? No, I just woke up," Sam complains as he shuffles over to the car. Sam pulls out the same stuff Dean did and slams the trunk close.
Dean scans the metal stand that has magnets all over it. He's trying to figure out which magnet would be best to put on the bunker's fridge, but there are just so many good ones.
"Again? That sounds like you'd have to do something for me," Vanessa hums.
"Why would I do that?" Dean asks, groaning as he sits on the dock, dangling his legs off the edge.
"Not as pretty as my sister's, she got them from my mom," Vanessa hums and buries her face into his chest. "They're a pretty blue."
"Like the chocolate?" Dean asks, hoping it's not that kind of kiss. Dean has admitted to himself that he has been in love with the angel ever since he rescued him from that one angel, Zachariah.
"Yeah that one, so I pitched in and created the cheetah," Castiel hums, his big smile still plastered on his face.
"Like Blue Planet?" Dean chuckles to himself.
Vanessa sighs, "as a dare, I had to get even drunker and combine a famous painting with someone in my family, so I horribly painted my sister as the Mona Lisa and I painted a terrible mustache on her" she smiles as she remembers the fond memory.
Vanessa wonders to herself.
"A little?"
"Yeah her, would you be a dear?" Dave/Vanessa cups her face, she nods they head for the door. As soon as it's closed the sound of a head falling on the ground makes Dave/Vanessa grin.
"So what? I have someone in my house! I didn't want to tell you guys this soon, now I need sleep," Vanessa growls.
They don't even bother to look at the exhibit next to the eagle, instead, they make their way towards the next big area.
"Fine, let's go get dressed then," Vanessa wiggles out of Dean's arms and sits up.
The largest one slowly walks past Vanessa and walks to Sam, his light blue scales catch the sunlight from the large windows, making it look like glittery ice. Sam doesn't make any noise but moves closer to Dean as the dragon tries to sniff him, his large ram-like horns nearly stab Sam's arm. The smaller one ignores the brother and jumps on the couch to lay on Bobby, who sighs and starts scratching their head.
Dean runs his hand down her sides, reaching her hips, he places a hand where her crotch would be. "This would be so much easier if you had legs," Dean chuckles.
She peels off of the bloody clothes and her underwear and walks into the now steamy bathroom. She places the clean clothes on the counter next to the shower. She pulls back the shower curtain and steps in, ignoring the blistering water. Vanessa looks down at her legs, noticing that there are big red splotches all over them. Indicating that a full moon is coming or the water is too hot.
"Sorry, Cas," Vanessa apologizes and adjusts the towel around her.
"There," she says, backing away from his neck, Vanessa looks him in the eyes and smiles. "All mine," she touches his bottom lip with her finger, he opens his mouth and stops past her nail, Dean swishes his tongue over the pad of her finger until she pulls it out.
Dean walks over to the dresser that on the right wall, he opens the drawer hoping that Castiel might've come back with new fresh clothes so he doesn't have to wear Vanessa's. Normally he wouldn't complain about wearing anyone's clothes, especially Vanessa's extremely soft pajama pants that have deep pockets, but with his heightened sense of smell, he can only smell the ocean which isn't too bad, magical herbs, dragons which smells just like smoke, and the worst of it, dead fish.
"Yes, I'll grab them," Daniel disappears into the pantry and comes back out with the tins.
Cas blinks at her, "they are very beautiful." He mumbles.
Unfortunately, it's the only other thing she can think of, she should have asked if it was okay to touch them instead of sinking her hand into them. Vanessa just remembered that she did this at the witch's house! Now Vanessa feels bad for him, having to do that while having a hard-on? That must have sucked.
"That's a lot, Nessa."
"Dad do you think it's weird that I came out of an egg? Would you have wanted me to be born like an actual human?" Vanessa looks at her dad.
"What is it?" Dean and Castiel ask at the same time.
"You're staying the night with Vanessa?" A drowsy voice says. Everyone turns and looks at where it came from to find Dean standing in the archway with nothing but a plain gray t-shirt on and a pair of Vanessa's pajama pants.
"Dean?" A voice calls from downstairs.
"I won't forget, tis but a curse," Vanessa dramatically brings her hand up to her face. "But a funny curse at some points." She yawns.
"It's the picture Sam took of us and Bobby when we went out to celebrate after our first hunt together in a frame," Vanessa rubs the glass with her thumb. She levitates it over to Dean.
"Really? That's..." Dean trails off.
Dean smiles at the angel's excitement. He slowly reaches for the door and takes the handle in his hand. "Dean," Castiel whines. "Stop being an ass or I'll rip that door off."
"What would that be?" Castiel asks after the sound of his wings flapping makes both Sam and Dean jump.
"I'll have to take you up on that" Vanessa says flirtatiously, "I wanted to make it up to you by not calling, " she says tracing a heart on Dean's cold thigh "but it'll have to wait"
Dean sighs, glancing down to his plate, stabbing a piece of his pancake, not wanting to admit that his brother's right. "Fine. Whatever."
Next chapter will be fun, i hope yall enjoyed this one.
"Well if it's Jim he can't be a Timothy," Dean takes the can as well as a spoon and hands it to Tim. "Do you know how to use a spoon?"
"You don't?" Vanessa asks, she runs a hand through her messy hair wondering if this is a good thing or a bad thing. She tries to remember anything that her instructors taught her about angels, most of it was about the war and if you ever meet one don't piss it off. Vanessa has made that mistake countless times, her hidden scars could back that up.
Vanessa turns off her phone, Castiel had cleaned up all the shattered glass so she puts her phone back on the bedside table.
With that, Tim locks onto Dean's eyes and says. "Hello, Dean. I am here to watch the TV with you again."
nerd. Anyways, I've gotta go now, Sam's back
She slows her pace as Dean starts getting closer and closer. So much so that she has started to lick the length instead of putting it in her mouth, Dean lets out a low whine as she licks one clean line to his sensitive slit and continues to slowly take him in her mouth. It's not long until Dean's right on the edge, Vanessa smiles sweetly at him "I'll stop teasing, " she says before sliding him perfectly in her mouth and down her throat.
"I-I got nothing," Sam rubs the back of his neck. "Except for the fact that they hatch from eggs. Right? Thats still their thing?"
Vanessa was close behind Dean for the first half until the weight of the towel around annoyed her and she dropped it on the ground, she quickly catches up to Dean who is standing on the dock grinning.
Most of the gifts that Dean got her are shirts, which he hopes that she doesn't mind, Dean has gotten her quite a few.
Dean cradles Castiel's jaw with his hand as the other one manages to find its way onto the angel's leg. Their kiss is tender, just as Dean hoped. They slowly pull apart, each not wanting it to end.
"What are you doing?" Dean hears a gruff voice ask, after flipping a pancake, he turns around to find a bleary-eyed Tim.
"That's fucking awesome! I would kill for something like that, watching Blue Planet has made me want to swim with whale sharks since I first saw them," Dean exclaims, his green eyes seem to spark with excitement.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That was saving our lives" Vanessa replies, she pulls her arm towards her chest and the knife flies back at her, but into her hand instead.
"Who doesn't like coffee?"
Dean cuts Sam off, "we will be leaving soon, and I have a feeling that this conversation will take more than two days!"
"You didn't drink any blood, did you?"
Dean nods and finishes up his coffee, placing the empty mug on the table. When his eggs are done, Daniel throws a couple of bacon slices on the plate and hands it to Dean. He happily digs into the eggs then takes a bite out of the bacon.
With the list of her favorite TV shows, movies, and who Vanessa's favorite characters are, Dean thinks he got great gifts. He had chosen most of it and Sam got her a thing or two but he didn't specify, but Dean did have to get a little help from his good friend Charlie, who had the same reaction that Vanessa had when he said he doesn't know what Red vs Blue is.
"But you know, we won the war, we got to keep our territory and our kingdom entered the golden age after that, " Vanessa explains with a sad smile, almost as if she was there when it happened.
Vanessa smiles as warmth floods her body. "I mean, I'm kind of design to be," Vanessa says as she hums the rest of the song.
"What?" Vanessa asks, alarmed.
"Me? No," Castiel quickly replies. "I've only played the one board game called Sorry."
"What time is it?" Dean smothers his face into the pillow.
"I gotta go, don't leave without me," Sam pats Dean's shoulder and turns towards the back of the diner.
"So, while he was yelling at me about how I didn't finish the job sooner, someone else completed the bounty, so I didn't get paid and got yelled at," Vanessa growls as she cracks the eggs into the pan. "Do you want eggs?"
"Favorite TV show?"
"Soorry, I kneew y'all were coomin' tooday but I thought it woould be much lateer," Vanessa smiles and wraps her hands around his back. "I shoould have wookeen up earlieer to greet yoou."
Tim clicks his tongue in response. "It's fun to turn on and watch," Dean turns back to look at Tim, his startling blue eyes never seem to have left his face. "I tend to say the answer out loud if I know it."
"Thanks, I'll keep that in mind."
"Witches..." Vanessa mumbles as she scratches her chin " odd, I should've heard about that, especially if it's in this city."
"Prepare to lose then," Vanessa says before diving into the water. Her eyes quickly adjust to the darkness as she swims with ease deeper, reaching the bottom within seconds.
"That's a loaded question."
He makes a small dent in his thirst as he downs the cup of water. He wipes his mouth and tosses the cup into the sink. He walks out of the kitchen and shuffles up the large wooden stairs. He quietly walks past the bathroom and into the guest bedroom next to it. When Dean first woke up in this strange room, he immediately knew that this was where Vanessa kept any prisoners she had, the sudden smell of sweat and blood that was covered in the scent of flowers hit him like a train. Nevertheless, he didn't complain, it was mostly because he didn't want to show his soon-to-be-gone-fangs.
Dean turns to glare at him, he takes a seat right next to him and groans. "I'm fine, it's just the damn sun, it's too bright" Dean complains, if the curtains were open any longer, Dean's small headache would've gotten worse.
The man opens his mouth but all that comes out is gibberish. Noticing the confusion on Dean's face, the man furrows his brows and clears his throat. "What are you doing?"
After another hour Sam joins them, to which Tim's attention is finally pulled away. "Find anything?" Dean asks without looking away from the book.
He groans as he pulls out a butcher's knife that is rusty and has an overwhelming smell of old blood. He slams the drawer loudly and curses at himself silently, hoping that no one woke up. He saunters over to the bed and falls on it, shoving his face into his pillow, breathing in its harsh flowery scent. He shuts his eyes in hopes that he falls asleep, during his time as a vampire he hasn't slept a wink, most of it was out of fear of the others killing him and the rest was out of fear of what they'd do to him asleep.
She glances at her surroundings, the bottom of her deep pool is barren like most, but instead of just a concrete bottom it also has a thick layer of sand so it's much more comfortable to fall asleep on.
Castiel beams at the compliment, his face turning all shades of red. "Thank you, Dean," his voice going even lower from the compliments.
"Where do you think you're going?" Vanessa asks, she turns him around with her magic and sits him back down on the bed. "Without giving me a kiss?"
"Alright then," Dean says, reaching for his phone. "Call if you find anything worthwhile. Bye."
"Wow," Dean looks over the picture. It perfectly captures the feeling of the moment, Vanessa with a beer in her hand laughing her ass off, Bobby grinning at something he had just said, and then Dean trying to take a swig of his drink and not laugh. The dim light in the photo highlights Vanessa's braided bright pink/purple hair and all of her beautiful features.
"Have you talked to her yet?" Sam semi whispers. Dean thinks of a smartass response but decided against it, "about what?"
"Nooo!" One with long blonde hair screams as she hugs one with dark brown hair.
"Now this one I definitely found at Walmart," Dean smiles and leans into the couch, completely forgetting that half his arm is engulfed by feathers.
"Thanks, " Sam says as he looks at his now cleanish shirt.
"No problem, I hope to work with you and your brother again, next time I won't offer your souls." Vanessa smiles at him and touches his arm, making Dean's face and neck heat up.
"Did you want me to show you how the TV works again?"
"Then he just couldn't bring himself to do it, he thought you would be mad at him for not calling, so he didn't," Sam says, he makes a left turn down a narrow road, out into the countryside.
“Take me to a shelter and I’ll not only escape but I'll track you myself.” Pudding growled at Dean, narrowing his eyes and flicking his tail. Dean looked at Sam.
Dean had stared at him when he asked that, glaring.
Over the past two days, He had been staying at the motel with the hunters- which he didn’t hate at all. In fact, he kinda dug it. Claire would ramble to him about monster stuff, Kaia would make fun of shows on the shitty TV, and Jack would...well he’d be Jack.
The gang try to make a cure for Dean. A very British face shows up and Dean does stuff that you can only do in a rated R movie.
“Let them go.” Dean growled. The witch scowled at him.
A jolt of shock went down Ben’s spine as his eyes darted to Jack.
“Hi.” Sam growled.
Ben goes to his mother's funeral and makes the choice he's been leading up to for years. Dean has a lot of things on his mind.
“Kinky werewolf, maybe?” Sam suggested, obviously forcing down a smile. “Uh, maybe a witch. The vic said he remembers being knocked out by a humanoid figure, then waking up in excruciating pain under the belt. A witch might find some magic uses for that kinda thing.”
Sam trailed off, his expression showing that he realized what he was saying. Dean huffed a bit and sat back, subtly rubbing at his right arm and looking away.
If anyone deserved to live, it was Castiel.
“WHY THE HELL ARE YOU COVERED IN BLOOD!?” Mary exclaimed, horrified. Dean shrugged.
"No, I can't trust you on a hunt." Mary interrupted before Sam could walk any farther to his room. He turned to her, wildly confused.
I've been working on this a LOT recently. I'm currently writing chapter 16, so as you can tell, I'm a bit far ahead(especially because instead of being 1000-2000 words each chapter now they're ranging from 3000-4000).
“So to your house, Ben?”
“Dean…” he swallowed. “... what's going on?”
Until he came back from hell.
After about eight hours of driving, it was decided by the court of the car to stop at a restaurant and then allow the nocturnal demon with the ability to not need sleep to drive for the rest of the night.
“Your name is Sam Winchester, and I just shoved your soul back into your tall body.” Gabe stated, staring down at the human. Sam blinked curiously.
“Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, people with ADHD have emotions that are way
“That's a myth made up by dogs!” He hissed. Dean chuckled and looked around.
“Huh.” Dean scoffed in amusement. “Well, you have this one's consent, so let's go.”
“Dean, please don’t go sneaking out.” He growled. Dean shrugged and began to walk out of the room.
The two of them together? They were a nightmare that Mary and Cas could never expect.
“Uh-huh.” Dean’s eyes caught onto an orange container on Ben's bed stand. “What is that?”
Dean stared back.
Before Dean could say anything else, Cas swiftly grabbed the squirt bottle from the table he was sitting at, squirting Dean in the face. Dean hissed and flinched away, subtle steam rolling off of the surface of his skin. Sam was a pain in the ass now a days, but his brilliant idea of holy water in a squirt bottle was very useful.
“Dude! I just hacked up blood from choking, I could use help!” He insisted irritably.
“Shut up, mouse brain!” Pudding spat, growling and standing back up.
“Oh. Huh.” Sam breathed, still keeping his eyes on the road.
“Yeah, me and Cas can stay here and study teenager style~” He purred into Castiel’s ear, who drew in a long and nervous breath.
...Well, thank you, and goodnight.
“It’s j-just me! Y-you killed my entire nest!” She wailed. “Please don't hurt me!” Sam stared down at the little girl with a cold face. He brought the machete down, cutting through her neck as she screeched.
She walked into the library and looked at Cas.
“Wh...what are you?”
"Yeah, I've only kissed two guys before!" Dean scoffed. "Well- er- slept with one...once. But that- that didn't count."
He walked over to the closet, opening it up and walking inside- and looking at the shelves. Being unusually tall had its perks- such as not needing to stand on his toes to find the shotgun hidden behind a shoebox.
that night- not to mention, Dean had the keys on him, and he knew he did, too. It was like he was aware while sleepwalking.
Like Supernatural, it has hilarity, angst, trauma, found family, and stuff like zombies, monsters, and demons.
“DONT FUCK WITH THE WINCHESTERS!” Dean cried in victory, laughing. Sam looked over at his brother, and saw that the man was soaked in blood. Normally, this would be terrifying to Sam, but now he could care less.
Dean smoking out of his meat-suit was based off of a comic by Consulting-Cannibal on Tumblr. Scout is amazing and I love her.
“Dean what the fuck?” Sam's voice was monotone as if he expected it, but he was still pissed. Gabriel laughed in the background, and Cas remained focused on Pudding.
“This is Pudding!” The employee smiled.
After a few agonizing hours of speeches, funeral services, etc, he perked up when he got a text.
“I've already told Sam that I am a good liar, for I once tricked and deceived both you and him.”
He knew Dean was grieving, and now it probably just got worse after watching Lisa die.
The next thing he knew, he was on top of Sam, whose expression was full of shock and confusion. Gabriel could thank Chuck that the human couldn't see how harshly his wings were sticking up now.
“So, Jack,” Ben looked to the ground. “What cool stuff can you do?”
Mary loaded up her gun and shoved two extra clips of ammo into her pockets, looking to Castiel.
Dean mind melds with a cat.
“Hello?” Castiel’s low voice answered, sounding slightly in distress.
“Ben, if you're rooming with us, you ought to know something about Jack.”
Gabriel ended up leaning too far forwards, drawing in a stiff breath as he tumbled forward once the shovel under him gave out.
“Hey!”
“No.” They both replied.
“Oh please, I healed you, ya tall drama queen.” Gabriel snorted, smirking. “And I'm an angel, I don't dig.”
Dean followed Ben through the halls, pretending like he didn't know each room. He gave a small smile watching the kid open his room- the door still had a

“Watch your fucking language,” Dean muttered, putting the car into gear. Ben couldn’t help but laugh a little bit.
about normally but was genuinely interested in now that the words came from Cas’ mouth- fuck, hed actively put in research about bees just to crack jokes about them with Cas, just to see him smile, just to heat that tiny little laugh. He wanted to touch him, play with his tie, ruffle his hair to annoy him, jokingly place his hand on his shoulder and go
He tried not to laugh a bit at the contact name he gave her. Kaia had called her it once and he couldn’t stop thinking about how weirdly fitting it was.
The boys sneak out to do local hunts with Crowley. Sam and Mary have no luck with the testicle case. Dean thinks back to the first time he got drunk by himself.
CRASH!
Dean set the gun down, and the witch smiled, snapping her fingers once again and allowed Sam to breath. Sam panted, and stared at Dean in shock. Dean looked away from him, and back to the witch, narrowing his eyes.
But yet, the other half of him screamed to save his little brother, to ignore his demonic instincts and do the right thing.
They were quiet for a moment longer, before Sam spoke up. “...He isn't human.”
“No, Sam.”
“Sharing is caring,” Jack said, shoving french fries into his mouth.
“Your insults don't mean anything to me, considering I’m about to kill you.” Sam shrugged. “I’ve always wondered where demons go when they die. Mind telling me if you ever come back? It’ll be good to know before I kill you a second time.”
“It just feels good getting a job done.” He shrugged.
“What're you doing?” Sam growled.
But he was...off. Ben didn’t know Dean well, but he knew this wasn’t how he normally was. His eyes were glazed over, he was barely eating, he was digging himself into the news for extra demonic signs, and he was always...sickly looking.
How was this life?
Before Dean could say anything else, Cas swiftly grabbed the squirt bottle from the table he was sitting at, squirting Dean in the face. Dean hissed and flinched away, subtle steam rolling off of the surface of his skin. Sam was a pain in the ass now a days, but his brilliant idea of holy water in a squirt bottle was very useful.
Christmas Special!
“I could really use some help, yknow!” Sam panted, taking a quick second to breath and lean against the shovel. Gabriel nodded.
“Welcome to hell, what’ll it be? Watching a crappy movie or trying to knock me out with more alcohol?” He sassed, smirking. Castiel scowled at him.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “Go back to sleep, Sammy.”
He pulled up to the warehouse, and recognized Crowley standing outside. The brothers exited the car, casually walking up to the king of Hell.
The blonde stormed out of the room, and Sam turned to face Cas.
“Dude,” Sam glared at Dean. “GPS said to turn
“Yeah, you totally could.” He replied casually, biting into his chocolate. Sam scowled at him.
“Thank fucking god.” Ben grabbed the bag.
“If I go down saving people, then it’s
Ben stared Sam dead in the eye, walking over to him and glaring all intense- just like Dean does.
Dean grabbed his pistol out of his pockets, cocking it and aiming it at the girl. She seemed to already be able to tell what type of bullets were loaded into it.
He was in front of the road, a semi honking LOUDLY as it sped by him. All he could do was huff, staring at the stars above and realizing Cas was nowhere to be seen.
Dean sat there for a moment, before getting up and walking to the fridge- grabbing one of the tiny vodkas and walking back to the bed to sit down and sip at it.
"Sam!" She calls out.
Dean chooses the latter and walks past the bed and heads downstairs. He sets the bag of goods on the coffee table in the living room, he has everything he needs laying on the floor.
"He got captured, he made us leave him behind, I'm sure they're trying to turn him, luckily we know the cure if he doesn't drink and AH!" Sam hisses as Vanessa rubs a mixture of the herbs on the gash. Her wrist glows pink as her hand shines a healing light on the cut. After that's done, she places a large bandage over the cut then buttons his shirt back up.
Vanessa hisses and rubs her aching legs, Sam didn't notice, but Cas did. "Are you okay?" He asks, moving to stand next to her.
He scolds himself as he checks over the unconscious guy. His black hair is short and sticking in every direction, and the ends seem to be singed. Unfortunately, he is not wearing any clothes, so Dean tries not to look in that area.
"You don't have to ask Vanessa," Castiel replies. "I feel better if I ask," she lets go of his hand and wraps it around the back of his neck to pull him closer.
"He apparently had errands to run, he said he'll be back when everyone wakes up, " Dean says while scratching his chin "not sure what kind of errands an angel has but he'll be back soon"
"I'm sorry, Cas, but if I just hadn't have made outed us I would have gotten her, I'm so fucking stupid and–" he cuts her off.
"You just lost us the element of surprise" Sam hisses.
Daniel sits on the other couch away from them after he closes the door, he pats his leg and calls Malachite away from the bags. "So how long have you known my daughter?" He asks as he scratches her head.
She feels her face getting hotter as she watches Dean examine the rock. hopefully, she can blame the heat for her red face instead of Vanessa giving Dean rock.
"Update, Sam wants a sandwich" Dean informs Vanessa.
"Typical little brother, my dad always made me take Sam wherever I went too, it was nice a little bit until he got annoying real quick," Dean tells Vanessa with a smile.
Dean turns his head to Sam, who is sitting in a lawn chair next to him. "I would make a great fucking kindergarten teacher!"
"He's gorgeous," Dean says, admiring the pattern on the snake. "Did you make this one?" Dean tries to whisper, not that anyone would know Castiel is an angel, just so that they don't seem weird.
"Well, I'm going to give you my present, then I'll leave you to receive Cas'," Sam grabs everyone's plate and deposits them before going to grab Dean's gift.
Ignoring Castiel's humming, Vanessa finds a knotted part in the feathers, thinking that this is just like someone combing through someone else's hair Vanessa slowly undoes the knot, careful not to break any feathers, but Castiel's stupid feathers won't stop fluffing.
good, I think your dad is near the house," he says, looking where the door would be.
"Told you," Dean mutters before taking another sip of his coffee.
have our own problems and anxieties, I know you probably don't wanna talk about it, but if you do I'm here," Dean says softly then places a gentle kiss onto her forehead.
She slowly moves her hand up and down the length of his shaft, twisting ever so slightly and she draws out a low moan from him.
"I bet it does," Dean smiles and kisses her forehead. "And we could go swimming too. And eat whatever we catch, Bobby taught me how to prepare a caught fish, 's not that hard."
"Yes, all supernatural creatures have a distinctive smell. Right now you guys reek of vampire blood, which smells like you guys burnt trash and rolled in what was left, and add your own blood on top of it." Vanessa explains trying to not take in very big breaths.
"Sam Winchester, this dumbass's brother," he points to Dean.
"What's wrong!" Sam springs up blindly looking for danger, his eyes still closed as he yawns.
"Yes?" Hadiya's smooth voice sends a small shiver down her spine, Vanessa hasn't heard her voice in years, but she has never forgotten it.
Vanessa grabs another bottle and fills it up, "except for Cas, "
"That was quite a fall," Dean looks around the crater.
"Do you get to make any?"
"Okay, okay, enough talk eat your food now," Daniel says before returning to his burger.
"Cas, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to blow up on you like that," Dean starts his "shitty" apology. "I was just so anxious about this ever since Sam suggested I invite you, I didn't mean any of it. I'm sorry," Dean finishes, and as soon as he does, he feels like a weight has been lifted from his chest. Although he can feel another one falling in him as he watches the silent angel.
She can still see her figure running down the block her, but Sarah is much faster, her lungs burning when she turns the corner to find that Sarah is long gone.
"It's because I made a couple of those reptiles," Castiel sighs, he guides Dean into the dimly lit building. "My apologies, it's just that it'll be my first time seeing them out, and I'm a little excited."
Dean glares at him, "I–shut up" he grumbles.
Dean knows to be respectful, friendly, and above all else, he knows to expect him to pull Dean over to the side and tell him that 'if he ever hurts his daughter, he will hunt Dean down and kill him where he stands.'
From where he is sitting he watches Vanessa's glowing yellow eyes move from Castiel to Dean. Dean blushes when Vanessa gives him a warm smile and then goes back to talking to Castiel. A wonderful idea pops into Dean's head, he should make a huge breakfast for Vanessa to show how thankful he is for her rescuing him and letting them stay.
"Why? I've seen the better half of you, and I don't give a damn if you change out here anyway," Vanessa mumbles as shuffles to her dresser.
"Are you okay? You don't look too good," Vanessa asks then slaps her hand on his forehead, it's very warm and sweaty.
"Take your time" Vanessa calmly says but gives him the 'take your time but also kinda hurry up' look.
"I don't know, a freak accident?" Dean retorts.
"I can assure you that Vanessa is not lying, you have to come with us," Castiel says, glaring back at her.
"I wanted her to only have a bottle or so, but she kept wrestling them out of my hands," Dean explains as Vanessa throws herself onto Castiel.
The doors close behind her as she hits the lobby button. Hunting runaway witches are always hard to hunt, no matter their ranking. They only care about one thing, which is to hide. Over the years, Vanessa has perfected her skill, which is why she is so valuable to her boss.
Vanessa clears her throat, "Hello ma'am, my name is Alice Flores, me and my partner, James Hopson, are with the FBI and we are here to talk to Sarah Winston, is she here?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, umm, Dean." He quickly turns around. "Have you found your magnet?"
"That's interesting, " Sam replies dryly, he yawns then rubs his eyes. "Where is Cas?"
Everyone at the table stays quiet, too lost in thought to speak or move. Drumming his fingers against the hardwood table, he finally breaks the silence by standing from his chair and popping his back. Deciding to take a break after reading a whole lot of nothing, then having new things to research dumped onto his lap.
"He had errands to run, not sure what he's doing, but he'll be fine, " Dean replies.
"I feel like one, stupid itchy fins kept me up almost all night, " Vanessa complains as she tries to ignore her red arms. She shakes off a clump of hair off of her hand as Dean notices that in between each finger is webbed and muddy blue, and on each finger are long black talon-like nails.
Vanessa nods silently and throws the blankets off of her. "Did I snore? My sister and brother used to complain about that all the time when we were little."
Vanessa grabs the glass vile as Dean places the wooden spoon where the vile was. Dean watches im awe as Vanessa takes a pinch of the scales and sprinkles them in. Dean watches and chuckles, the pot is supposed to be used for boiling crabs so it's supposed to be tall, so tall that Vanessa needs a step stool.
"I'm down for being anything, offense, defense, or I could rescue the handsome damsel in distress" Vanessa states.
"It's okay," Castiel says, he pulls her into him and wraps his large inky black wings around her. Vanessa turns into his chest and starts crying into his clean suit jacket. He pets her hair as she continues to cry.
Vanessa goes from pointing at Dean to Castiel, confusing him even more.
"Vanessa," Castiel starts, but Vanessa lets go of his coat and starts running after Sarah.
