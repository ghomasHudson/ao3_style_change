“Cap?” Sam’s voice interrupts Steve’s internal musings.
It isn’t until their Humvees are pelted by gunfire that he realizes that he should have listened to his gut instinct.
“You have got to be fucking with me.”
It’s been more than year since anyone has seen him. After two months of no news, Sam finally cracked and joined Shield just to be able to search for him along with Natasha and Clint. Hill is nowhere as lenient as Fury—surprising considering how much of fucking hard-ass Fury was—but she wasn’t stupid and if Falcon offered himself in exchange for a mission to find his hubby, then she was taking it.
“Don’t worry. Your pet soldier won’t remember a thing about today. I know concussions can make things rather
Tony doesn’t want any member of SHIELD to believe that just because his late father was interested, doesn’t mean they can get their grubby little paws all over his stuff.
And these young, foolish Asgardians are the reason why he’s endangering the people he’s come to really care about. To love.
He then turns to Hephaestus. “Also, there’s some last minute details I’d like you to take a look at tonight as soon as your finished up here.”
Tony moves over to the lock chip that he made a couple days ago and palms it in his hand. He planned on finding a way to use it on his own, despite the problem of drawing immediate suspicion.
“It’s funny how it all works. The contradictions make my head hurt sometimes,” Hades laughs and looks at Hephaestus with crooked grin, eyes suspiciously glassy. “What I’m trying to say, is that you’re so much more than Olympus’s best weapon manufacturer. You live for, you
(He may or may not have liked Agent Carter more for that alone. He’ll definitely miss her.)
Hephaestus’s eyes narrow. Why did he need to do the best that he could?
He's permanently heartless.
(He really wasn’t surprised about the fights. If an injustice exists, Steven Grant Rogers will try to stop it. That quickly becomes a fact like Poseidon crashing the waves of the sea.)
Steve asks.
“Stevie wouldn’t stop talking about you, which would be enough, but you also got his six when I couldn’t. That’s something worth noting in my book.” Bucky takes a sip of his drink while an interesting dusting of red appears on Steve’s cheeks.
Tony nods and the small smile that cuts his face is painful.
Pepper sighs. “Well, this is going to be a nightmare of paperwork.”
What’s even the point?
They pause outside of the busy recruitment office. Both watching the steady current of people moving in and out.
He forces himself to keep his response easy and light, “Of course. You have the same right as everyone else.”
Instead he thinks of his magic, and his strengths relative to a human.
Tony can’t bring himself to look at her. “No. Not yet.”
Each whip that wraps around the suit completely shocks his system.
The thought of what Hephaestus could make for Steve however, doesn’t vanish completely. (He blames his constant multiple trains of thought, not his
Tony palms a hand over the tired lines of his face.
If the lack of conflict or complete silence between the three gods seems odd to him, Steve doesn’t comment on it.
Plus, even he can admit there’s some merit to the newscasters who claim he’s turned into a hermit.
Hephaestus stares at the door.
His eyes look like they’re glowing.
Because the thing is, Hephaestus has no doubt in his mind that Steve is the recruit to be chosen. He may not have wanted to admit it earlier, didn’t even allow himself to think about Steve being subjected to such experimental methods, but as soon as Phillips mentioned Steve… denial was impossible.
Now, Tony’s never claimed patience as a strong suit, so with a little help from JARVIS and a quick bypassing of Stuttgart Museum’s security cameras, he pulls up a visual of the ground.
Sunglasses hide his bloodshot eyes and the tears that trail down his face. The press swarm like maggots or vultures, shamelessly preying on the death of a millionaire and his son.
It’s strange, actually being here to see it.
, because his emotions struggle to get what his mind is saying.
Unafraid, without glamours, and emboldened by the responsibility that rests firmly on his shoulders.
His mother sat, as always, to his father’s right, in a throne only slightly smaller. She did not speak to him.
The perfect soldier.
Ares ignored him. This was how he always acted when they were with anyone though. Hephaestus did not know why. He just knew not to question it because honestly, he was not good in many ways. He did not blame Ares. He understood.
“We’re gonna get you out of here.” Gentle, but firm hands haul Tony up. He tries to stand on his own, but he just feels so drained. Exhaustion threatens to pull him into a blissful darkness.
“Right. Let’s get this show on the road.” He clasps his hands together.
But no, it was Rhodey, a friend he thought he had long since driven away.
Anger is a powerful emotion. But it’s one he doesn’t have the energy to maintain anymore.
“Tony, you don’t happen to have any tech in that area I should know about?”
He knows what will happen if he doesn’t.
No one needs to say that the Axis powers have produced a threat far more terrifying than anyone can comprehend.
Tony, let’s remember, has already been on edge for the last twelve fucking hours or so. Despite all of that, he refuses to admit any discomfort to a complete, more than untrustworthy stranger.
What he will question however, is the figure he sees standing under the awning once he circles back around. Those broad shoulders and absurd waistline do not belong there.
Tony finally drops down onto the slightly curved roof. It’s even more slick with ice and he has to scramble a bit to keep his footing.
Why would he not be here? Was she not the perfect wife and woman? Was he that much of a fool to miss her giving birth to “his” son?
Maybe this is another change he needs to make in his life.
But it’s been ten months.
Now though? Now he thinks he can see what all the fuss was about.
Hera, the supreme goddess, patron of marriage and childbirth, was not very good at being a wife and mother. She may be the goddess of family, but she did not understand that kind of love.
No, no fuck that.
A part of himself that wants to hide, be protected from the subsequent danger that might follow from putting himself out there.
He doesn’t understand what’s going on.
If there’s one thing he’s learned in the last seven thousand years it’s that nothing important ever comes without a cost. A cost that for a while now, has been a “Hephaestus Original.”
The god of war, usually so harsh and violent, softly brushed through the disarrayed curls. Ares snapped his fingers so a small set of formal robes replaced the ones covered in grease.
A trembling breath in, and then Tony takes a step away from the counter to finish getting ready.
Soft curls bounced, reflecting almost blue hues in black hair. Already sharp, sharp amber eyes snapped into focus.
Steve beams. Before Hephaestus can recover his breath from the force of that smile Steve gives him a quick hug. The bastard keeps grinning and lets go to jog over to the entrance of the Electra. “You coming?”
Of course, before anything can be done, a high pitched whine begins behind him. Acting on pure instinct, Tony drops down just as the blast from the Hydra weapon fires.
But worst of all, it’s compromising.
The man sighs. There’s something slightly condescending about the way he shakes his head. “Not behind closed doors, Tony. This was a board of directors meeting.”
Tony just stands beside Bucky and Steve. Attempts to keep himself from fidgeting.
He’s stuck at what’s got to be one of the top five worst locations for privacy, but with all the recording devices set on a loop and JARVIS prepared to warn him about any intruders, Tony did his best to make due.
“He doesn’t.” Hephaestus responds, weak.
Keeping the faceplate on once they got to the Helicarrier would be suspicious as fuck. He’d probably have SHIELD pouncing on him faster than you can say Fury.
Noticing the keys attached to the fallen wardens belt, Steve quickly bends down to grab them and dangles them to show Hephaestus. He smiles at Steve’s success and quickly punches the warden one last time so they fall unconscious.
Not that Ares approved, traditional bastard.
He’s known it from the beginning, Steve is meant for amazing things. It’s amazing that people are finally starting to recognize that.
He’s disgusted at himself for the satisfaction stirring in his belly from Steve’s rejection. He really does need to get his head on straight, damn it. At this point though, Hephaestus isn’t quite sure how.
Steve and Hephaestus watch with bated breath as Bucky leaps, forced into abandoning the gantry completely as it falls away and toward the harsh flames below.
The latter part is where the real distraction comes in.
JARVIS asks him to start drinking chlorophyll to counteract the symptoms of the Palladium poisoning and Tony doesn’t even ask about the AI conducting his own research. He just agrees without an argument because who cares if he survives a few days more? It’s death either way.
“I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube,” Fury says. Tony rolls his eyes.  “And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.”
“In Hera’s gardens, right next to the gates.”
The setting sun turns the sky into a wash of brilliant color, but Hephaestus ignores Apollo’s departure in favor of focusing on Steve. He ran into camp with only a shouted
“Tony…” Pepper slowly shakes her head. “Tony, you can’t be serious.”
Growing up for Hephaestus was not an easy task.
It occurs within a matter of moments, but Tony watches Bucky’s fall off the train as if it took place over the course of a lifetime. Each millisecond catalogues the shock, the pain, and finally the pure anguish.
Hephaestus speaks with conviction, his belief in Steve clear and firm. “You are worth so much more than this.”
day, Hephaestus sat behind Agent Carter to watch the recruits with exasperation and disgust.
It’s only been within the last several days though, that he’s been coming to terms with what that means. It’s a name that carries so much pain and resentment.
“Guess what I bought on the way over?”
“Yeah…” Hephaestus chuckles, “This is kind of a special project.”
He leans forward. Tony doesn’t allow himself to move. To breathe.
He tries to recall the last thing he remembers. Trees. Wind. Thunder. His father. Zeus. Sky. Falling. Air. Falling. Ungrateful
She looks just as beautiful as she did in his dream. But the quick look and smile she sends him is painfully empty.
Steve then looks down at his lap and smiles self-deprecatingly. “You just seem so confident all the time. Thought maybe talking to you might help calm me down a little.”
Tony matches his attitude with an ugly smirk.
He remembers that day when the young princes of Asgard came to Olympus. It was the same day he lost his hammer.
“Steve.”
Two glasses of champagne in hand, Tony takes his time walking right past the agent and over to Pepper. She raises a brow as he passes the drink to her and takes a seat on the leather upholstered sofa.
“I was inquiring about his hammer.”
“Besides we own the controlling interest. It doesn’t matter how many points the stock dipped.”
This was never supposed to happen.
Where his hair before was the color of umber, usually slicked back in a style that fit in with the other men of the 1940’s, now it's back to its natural black. Tousled in a way that leaves curls falling into his eyes.
Ignorance is no longer an excuse.
Tony sighs. “Please, Pikachu, spare me the titles. I think we passed that point when you decided to aim Mjölnir at my head.”
His car had failed.
Chains made by Hephaestus himself.
“Don’t tell me you’re having second thoughts about your decision.” Pepper eyes him like she’s calculating how far she’d have to throw her stiletto for it to hit him.
“Finished the tracker I see?”
It seems the universe has decided to cut him a break after all, because Steve stops suddenly, hand raised with a stiff gesture. There’s no hesitation in the group to follow their Captain’s command.
Loki.
When he finally reaches his destination, the pulse of his reactor in his throat, Hephaestus knocks on the heavy metal door that is designated as Howard’s lab. There’s a muffled shout to come in and he cracks open the door to find the large space surprisingly empty. He can tell how filled the room usually is by the organized chaos only engineers and scientists capable of that's leftover on what looks like dozens of workstations.
The sharp pain of familiarity slowly dulled the more time they spend together. It could be explained by exposure, but it helps that Agent Carter is almost nothing like Athena.
Tony ducks his head, eyes annoyingly bright. Once he gets it a little more under control he motions to his hand. “Well I owe you both an explanation, in the very least."
And then, well, it’s not so funny anymore.
“But Tones, you can’t go around blowing stuff up,” Rhodey argues.
“I’m not mad, you know?”
Hephaestus snaps his head up in surprise at the question. “What do you mean?”
Steve continues, undeterred, “But if you know where they are–”
Twice.
Now, he knew he often tested her patience, as he was infamous for his many affairs among all of the gods and mortals.
“Is this really the time?” Steve says, panicked.
But that doesn’t mean a mask isn’t required.
“You know what I wanna know?” He covers one eye and squints out the window for several long seconds. Tilts his head from side to side. Then far too innocently he looks back at Hill. “How does he even properly see?”
About forty-five minutes later Tony walks out of his bedroom feeling significantly more clean.
He was wrong though.
This infantry is clearly the workhorse of the military, not only battling the enemy troops to gain more territory, but doing physical labor back and forth to the front lines. They transport the food, clothing, weapons and medicine.
“I don’t think you understand. You, Hephaestus, are the god of fire and innovation. You are my
“What are you doing here?” Steve asks.
The joy is temporary though.
It’s an unusually warm day in June when Tony gets the alert about a disturbance in New Mexico.
It awed Hephaestus sometimes, whenever he would over hear gods speaking about it in passing conversations.
“Stark!” Steve has to shout as the wind picks up. “We need a plan of attack!”
He blinks, shakes his head. Tony tries to concentrate on the task at hand, but the urging aura of the scepter, the tempting yellow glow, doesn’t budge. He barely manages to shove it into the periphery of his thoughts.
The time counting down his freedom from the Titans is almost up.
to keep his friends safe.
He tries not to take over the whole thing immediately, but his patience runs out when they try to use Rhodey against him.
Pepper blinks.
“So what are you thinking? We could use two turbines, one on the exhaust side to collect exhaust energy and another on the intake side to pressurize air?” Hades tilts his head as if visualizing the way the attachment would work.
(Hephaestus tries his best not to think about Steve. Steve seeing the lowest points of humanity. Steve fighting and fighting and realizing it isn’t enough. Hephaestus had to leave before even finding out where Steve was going. Before even saying goodbye.)
Like everything else about me: my brilliant mind is defective.
“You know, Rhodey did say that he was surprised you never made the connection.” Pepper says, offhandedly. “He said that since you grew up with Captain America as your idol, it was surprising you never recognized him.”
He hangs up even though his heart clenches at the thought of her crying alone. But Toni’s precious AI is as efficient as always, sending him a message before he hangs up.

“He’s been suffering a lot since Barnes’s disappearance.” She taps the tip of her fingernails on the rim of the porcelain cup. “I just hoped that you wouldn’t make him snap.”
They both hope it won’t come to that.
Those bastards.
“Let’s go.” I grit my teeth. Let’s see about righting some wrongs. It seems that I’m just in time because the moment I arrive in the village, there are several men with rifles shouting while pointing their weapons at women and children on the ground. I smile humorlessly. “J, put the translator on.”
By the time Yinsen is awake, I have the code uploaded to the main hub I’d installed inside the back plate. In theory, once I have everything correct it will serve as the brain to my weapon. Instead of placing it in the face plate where it will overheat and obstruct my view, I can have it functioning as a spine instead.
When she flies to Mexico to help rebuild a small town devastated by hurricane season, he’s right beside her with a shovel mixing cement for walls. Then when she goes to distribute food and water to famine-stricken villages in Somalia. And then again in the soup kitchens, the homeless shelters, the ocean cleaning project in Thailand, and soon enough, he spends more time out of the office than in it.
“What’s going on?” He asks Nat as she gets off. Her responding glare makes it clear she’s not ready to talk to him yet. He looks at Clint in hopes of getting some answers, but his face is just as blocked off.
Kudos and comments help feed my creativity! <3
Steve raises his gaze to the man shouting at him. Stocky build, average height with dirty blonde hair. Favors his left leg and holds his rifle in his right. Easy pickings.
So, with a soft apology, Steve places the handcuffs on his best friend of nearly seventy years before standing straight to continue his argument with the anonymous man who’d helped him when he thought all hope was gone.
“Pepper Potts dearest—”
“Hey Sam,” Natasha greets the other man with a brief hug, her lips barely brushing his ears, but by the time they separate Sam looks exactly like Steve feels. Natasha lets him stew for several moments as she starts scanning the small kitchen with the sweeper. After checking every corner and receiving only green lights, she finally sits down in one of the chairs.
“Oh God, I’m so sorry!” I freeze. I’d know that voice anywhere.
Steve had loved to simply
“That’s a relief. The boss will be glad.” Toni’s eyes crinkle at the corners despite her poker face.
“You don’t know her like I do.” Steve misses the way Nat’s mouth tighten in the corners, her bored expression otherwise unchanged. “She
I scowl. “No, the Iron Man suit is a part of me.” But it’s not exclusive. “I can build another one so that you can take it back to your superiors. It won’t respond to anyone that isn’t you, but it will at least stop their salivating for Iron Man.”
“As you wish Sir.” The image of a small village flashes on the HUD. “Last confirmed sighting is 10 hours ago.”
“Send him to voicemail, J.”
Bucky demonstrated a huge amount of restraint for a ten-year-old and didn’t argue. “Actually, I was curious. Why do you stand up to those kids if you know that they’re going to punch the snot out of you?”
Of course, when he wakes up that morning, everything seems the same. He’s in his shitty apartment, with his shitty life still in shambles around him, and don’t forget, he’s late to work, as par the course for a Wednesday morning.
“See you on the other side.” He gives me a smile. Something seems off though, so I repeat our plan to him. “Remember, at the end you will find me using our homing beacon.”
He’d pressured Toni into lowering the amount of alcohol she consumed. That meant that sometimes instead of going to a bar or pub, they go to a restaurant or drive thru instead. Steve avoids thinking that the times they spend in restaurants count as dates.
Strange that nobody other than Steve ever saw the danger in her bright megawatt smiles that showed too much teeth.
I grit my teeth and powered on.
“I didn’t know that Hill was still in contact with you?” He frowns at me. Maybe I shouldn’t mention that it was Jarvis. Then his expression clears, and he backtracks immediately. Ah, there’s the Steve I know and love. “I mean, not that I’m trying to imply anything—”
The email had been short and to the point: his work on everything pertaining to Stark Industries had been great for their image and they wanted to make sure that he was rewarded handsomely for any future pieces on them. If he were so inclined to receive further information, they required he get in contact with them via email so that an in-person meeting with their department head can be set up for him.
“No, Steve,” Bucky is adamant, but he softens his tone before continuing, “The past may have made me who I am, but the future is much more important. And this charity will do so much good for the vets who have been overlooked by the system.”
“It’s just, I’m about to make a huge ass decision that will probably make all of them explode and it will be much, much easier if they’re distracted by my ass or thighs to put up a fight.” She picks at her fitted black skirt dejectedly. “I hate using my body like this but it’s for the greater good.”
Things went on in this manner for a long time. Steve hated Bucky every second that he looked like the poster child for a healthy thriving kid. And Bucky hated Steve every second that he had to spend in the Rogers home with his Ma, reminded of just how shitty his life was. And nothing changed until they were ten.
“Nothing wrong with being scared.” Bucky muttered. “Everyone gets scared.”
“J, call Pepper and Rhodey.”
He’s just happy to be privy to her world.
But that might just be from the nerves of
No, he misses her like he would a limb. “Yeah.”
With his Ma’s words in mind, Steve mingles with a greater ease. He might not be one of the rich, but he’s got his gorgeous wife at his side and his career is finally taking off in the direction that he wanted. Of course, just as he makes peace with the discomfort of being forced to mingle with those living worlds away from his tax bracket, he spots her.
So I make appearances, reassure the public that I’m still alive and kicking, and slowly the stock goes back up until I can finally breathe easy. My paycheck had taken a severe cut, but I hadn’t been forced to fire anyone. Days turn into weeks, and those slowly bleed into months.
“Steve,” she interrupts, her voice soft with clear fondness. “You’re rambling, babe. What’s going on?”
I swear, on Nadira’s memory, I will give them front row seats to the best weapon I have ever made.
Several seconds of silence tick by as Steve’s sluggish braincells struggle to make a connection. Then it hit him. Alarmed, he suddenly sat up.
“Jarvis,” I say gleefully after finally completing my tests successfully. “Jot this down. Maneuverability And Reconnaissance Kit, aka MARK I is a success.”
“No Sir, would you like a recording?”
“Captain Rogers is requesting entry.” The first time I’d heard Jarvis refer to Steve as Captain Rogers, I’d been freaked out. But now I kinda dig it.
“Ah, no.” I look around for the wires that I’d left lying around…somewhere. “Have you seen a couple of copper—” Rhodey dangles the elusive wires from his fist. “Yeah those. Give em to me.”
And yet, when they collided at the open bar, he had none of those thoughts.
He stands, gives Steve a quick nod, then leaves.
But that meant it became a pain in the ass finding activities to pass the while during downtimes between missions. Running was out since he already did his ten miles in the morning. So that left sparring or hitting the bag. And only Bucky had ever been up for sparring.
I nod at the boy and his mother before taking to the sky. I know I’m crying; I just can’t show that to them.
I lift up a hatch that hid the tiny grenades, frowning as I see a couple of wires crossed in a way that would interfere with the mechanism. I grab the pliers on the table so that I can maneuver the little buggers. Had I not noticed—
When they arrive at Sam’s home, Clint is outside decked in his gear. Steve is suddenly very aware that Nat is still in her Black Widow tact suit and he is wearing sweatpants and a faded Dodgers t-shirt. Figures that the moment shit hits the fan, he’s the one not in his suit.
“Yeah but those kids shouldn’t make anyone feel scared. Much less the small kids like the one that got picked on.” Steve had stared mutinously at Bucky, waiting for him to make fun of him.
“You can’t keep ignoring this Toni!” He argues behind me as I move closer to the suit. “It’s been what? A year?”
“I know, it’s stupid.”
And if he suddenly gets awe-struck just by seeing her smile, well… Steve is also very stubborn.
A strange look crosses Bucky’s face. “Then the world and I will just become much more acquainted.”
He cranes his head toward the gallery where she’s talking to some stuffy looking old man, obviously dominating the conversation by the looks of her still date and the expression on the elder man. Every inch the powerful heiress, giving no quarter to the expectation placed on her gender. And yet, she eschews the stereotype that as a powerful woman her femininity should go by the wayside. Her gown the color of expensive wine fits her body like a glove, accentuating every curve, and diamonds sparkle at her ears and slender neck. Crimson lips and bold eyeshadow along with insanely high heels tie her look together.
After I pay, I slip my shades on my face again and sip at one of my cups. I’d checked my toxicity level in the bathroom before buying my juice and I’d finally hit 90%. Six hours ago, I’d been at 89%. Time is running out.
“Bucky’s gone.” He winces at the way that sounds. Now she probably thinks that he’s dead. “Not dead! Just… missing. He worked for Shield and never made it back from a mission.”
Because once Peggy got something in her mind, there is nothing that can make her change it.
Now that’s a thought.
My cries hurt my chest, but I can’t stop. I can’t erase the pain that seems to cleave my heart in two. I can’t erase the guilt I feel for not being able to do more. Maybe if I’d been faster…
“So what’s up?” I say, to cover up my AI’s sudden willingness to allow Steve into my sanctum.
“We aren’t looking for a consultant this time Stark.” Coulson says before knocking back the liquor in one gulp. Well, this looks interesting. “We need you on the Avengers, as Iron Man.”
“Who is it?”
My original plan was to fly over the desert until I found a village. One large enough and have communications to the outside world. Unfortunately, that plan met a fiery demise when my propulsors on my boots burn out. I barely have time to mutter out a swear word when I plummet down into the sand.
He sighs and looks away. “I’m still not really sure why you’re doing this Toni. Are you sure you’re ok?”
I pass out mid-flight, waking up as the jet starts to land. This time I feel much steadier and I only lean on Rhodey just a bit as I make my way off. Of course, my precious Pepper is at the tarmac and as soon as I clear the stairs, she launches herself at me.
I chuckle. “I love you too Rhodey Bear.” I gesture at Steve. “You know Steve I’m assuming?”
“Oh.” Her eyes bore into his, almost confused. To be honest, he had been giving mixed signals for a moment there.
“J, send eighty percent of energy to the boots.” I straighten out and feel the push of my repulsors as I get closer and closer to the moon.
“You don’t have to.”
I smile at him, god I adore this dorky menace. “Just peachy Capsicle.” The nickname rolls off my tongue, but he seems to ignore it, opting to reach out to me with my name on his lips. “I’m fine Steve.” And if he touches me, I’m going to fucking lose it and bawl my eyes out.
A chill seeps through my bones.
suit is heavy.
“What is this? Are you trying to reverse psychology me?” I let out a short bark of laughter. “Please Coulson, save your games for someone who cares.” My eyes narrow behind my shades and I give him my best bitch face. “I told Fury that I would help him with the Bucky issue because he is the public image of my foundation, not because I want to be part of your super-secret band.”
“Uh.”
So Bucky sighed and stood next to the skinny pain in the ass, defiantly staring down the other kid. Luckily for them, Steve’s bully had been the kind to pick on the loners and seeing as Steve was suddenly backed up by Bucky, he’d left them alone.
Steve clears his throat, tamps down his wayward thoughts, and continues, “Why do you think so many news outlets focus on your gender instead of your many philanthropic achievements?”
After her parents’ funerals, they’d started a weekly ritual of meeting up on Fridays. Normally he would be the one to go downstairs into her lab to drag her out of her experiments and work. If left to her own devices, she’d definitely go without sleep for at least 24 hours.
Aware that this is the first time that he is willingly choosing to spend time with me, without having to go through the whole convoluted process of discreetly stalking him before he arrives, I only have one answer. “I’ll see what I can do.” Horrified at the look on his face, I blurt out an apology. “I’m kidding! What time?”
“You disappeared on me Toni, suck it up.” She sniffles.
“Sam?” Natasha calls out.
Happy gives me the stink eye. “You heard her boss. Cheeseburger then hospital.”
I look at the tester in my hand and swear. Point one percent higher than two days ago. Time is ticking.
I wave at him energetically anyway. Maybe if I pretend that everything is hunky dory he’ll calm down and tell me what got him all red and splotchy so early (anything before 2 pm is early ok?). When he sees me, all the red leaves his face and instead he turns paper white.
team—is expected to arrive in Sokovia in a few days’ time.  February 5th, 2019.  General West sends a follow-up communique indicating a slight change in orders.  February 9th, 2019.  My team arrives in Sokovia.  February—”
This was… something else.
"Ah, nevermind," Tony said quickly. He cupped Steve's face in his hands, giving him a sweet, lingering kiss. "Let's go home, yeah?"
"Me too."
"Ah… about which part?" asked Tony.
And now there was yet another Langaran test-pilot widow, and yet another Langaran child growing up without a father.
“I said I’d have the goddamn missile built in two weeks!” Tony said.  “And that’s final!”
"That's correct, very good. Now, how about the football team that won Super Bowl twenty-three?"
"As of right now, no one other than the team and Pete have full access to the Compound's facilities, understand? I want all security codes for any personnel formerly working for SHIELD cancelled until they can be cleared to mine and Steve's satisfaction. Oh, and tell Fury he's in charge of the re-vetting, none of us have the time for it. Make him do his own damn spy work for a change."
, Barton! What in the
The teacher pursed her lips. "Then I would appreciate having your full attention during these announcements, is that clear?"
"Oh wow," Gwen said, her eyes wide as she ran her palm over the smooth grey leather of the passenger seat. "Peter, this is nice!"
"There's only been some preliminary results from the investigative team so far," answered Uncle James. "But from what Colonel Phillips told me, it seems as though the beam specifically targeted the landing apparatus."
"Come in?"
A couple seconds later Gwen's face appeared on Tony's tablet, looking so worried that Tony felt a small twinge of guilt for having to lie to her. As much as he hated to admit it, the girl did seem to care about Peter, and he for her.
Tony rolled his eyes. Leave it to Steve to still be worried about him while he was out in freaking space. "Yes, honey," he said. "Someone would have to get past eight separate people all carrying big-ass guns to get at me, so I'm fine."
"Sir!" JARVIS exclaimed. "Something's just entered the upper atmosphere!"
"Tony, let me go!" he cried. "Let me go and find him!"
“Ah huh,” said Tony.  “And you're absolutely sure that Steve—well, that he likes—”
"Let me double-check with Tony first, but it should be fine," added Steve. He popped the cap on his Powerade, taking a long drink as they headed towards the bank of elevators. "Thursdays Peter stays late at school for Robotics Lab, so I'll just have to make sure that we have a backup available to pick him up if Tony gets delayed."
"Oh, that's no problem, Captain," said Gwen. "I've spoken with JARVIS before."
"That's not true at all, Peter," he said, and a shiver shot down Peter's spine at how scared he sounded. "It's just like Dad said, it doesn't matter how strong you are, or that you can fly through the air on your webs or climb up walls, you're still just—"
Tony exclaimed, his jaw dropping in shock as Steve's heart did a flip inside his chest. "Colonel, you cannot be serious!"
“Uh huh,” Tony replies, sounding so much like Peter that a sharp pang of guilt pierces Steve’s heart.
They arrived at Ma's behind Bucky and Sam, who were already almost done unloading Sam's car. Steve planted another kiss on Peter's head as he slid them both out of the backseat, carrying him up the front steps to where Ma was waiting.
It was like Steve could read Tony’s entire being just by looking into his gorgeous brown eyes.  And what he saw said that Tony loved his son more than anything in the world, and that he was no stranger to being hurt.
"Huh?" Grandpa suddenly said as he woke with a start. "Did you say something?"
"No, sweetheart,
Peter frowned. "What about him? I'm assuming he'll be there too. Why, you think he's gonna try and interrogate me or something?"
And with Steve there, Peter wouldn't have to worry about Dad being all alone.
"Twenty? How in the hell are there still that many?" Tony cried. "We've already taken out at least a dozen of 'em, and—"
Which likely meant that they were trying to mess with his memories again, and that he really had no idea how long it had been since he had been taken.
"Nah, not weird exactly, it's just usually something you'd do when you're more serious," said Uncle Bucky. "I don't think I ever met a gal's parents because that meant you were ready to get engaged or something. I'd just meet 'em at the dance halls and have fun."
“And one of the best ways to not forget history, hmm?” said Mr Reeves.  He handed the World War II history book he was carrying to Peter, who proceeded to ring him up like he’d been working at the store his entire life.  “Far too many wars have been started because people didn't learn from history.”  He glanced up at Steve as Peter handed him his shopping bag.  “Captain Rogers here sure knows what I’m talking ‘bout.”
"Yeah, I know."
He also had a strong feeling that Mrs Leeds and her friends weren't the only one spreading goofy conspiracy theories around. The press conference Papa and the rest of the team had held a few days ago had been so brief and vague that it had probably raised a lot more questions than it had answered, and the news people had been having a field day ever since. Peter understood why they had to keep things a secret, the general public just wasn't ready to hear about giant purple aliens trying to snap away half of all life in the universe, but… yeesh.
, Steve can start to think about the possibility of saying something.
"Yeah, honey, I'm alive," answered Tony, over and over again. "Pete and I are both alive, and he's just down the hall in his room sleeping right now. Right, JARVIS?"
"Not for long," he heard Tony mutter under his breath.
Peter's sweet brown eyes briefly locked with Steve's, and he gave him a stuttered nod. "Uh—uh huh, Papa."
"I love you," Steve said, without missing a beat. "I love you, and I love Peter, and I'm never going to leave you. Not ever."
Blaster Peter's jaw twitched as he glared at Green Lady. "No, I really didn't, and—"
Tony had even wondered if Steve had ever been there, but had never dared to ask.  Peter had told Tony about the time when two of Steve’s old Army teammates showed up at his store out of the blue, and how upset he had been afterwards, and the last thing Tony wanted was to upset him even more.  Steve had told Tony a few times that all he wanted was to forget that time of his life, to bury the memories so deeply they would be hidden away forever.  But since there was no way that he could, it was up to Tony and Peter to make sure they never mentioned any of it around him.
"So it was probably Hill's personal car," Steve said.
“Hmph,” Peter grumbles, crossing his arms.  “So what you're saying is, you’re
"Uhh, what the hell?" Tony said as he slowly lowered his hand. "You're one seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?"
Steve thought as he glanced down at his drawing, at Tony and Peter's faces smiling up at him.
Steve shook his head. "No, but they were hosting a humanitarian delegation from Wakanda, one that included their king, T’Chaka."
"Ah, yeah," Tony said. "In a manner of speaking."
Peter gave a nod, flinching as he heard another crash of metal against stone. "Yeah, that's him. And my dad is Iron Man."
"Captain!" Carol cried as she attempted to reach for the gauntlet before Thanos got to his feet, only for him to actually remove the Power Stone from the gauntlet, encase it in his right fist, and punch her directly in the face with it, sending her flying across the plain.
"Holy shit, Steve!" cried Carol. "Is that—?"
Steve's shoulders visibly sagged. "Oh. Well, can you tell us who they are? Maybe JARVIS can get started on locating them."
"No, he didn't!" Howard exclaimed. "But you already knew that, Pym, so what's this all about?"
"Oh yeah, me too!" Peter said with a grin. "And my dad's gonna be by later today too, so it's been a great day for me."
"JARVIS, I need—I need you to keep track of this list of names, let me know if you come across anyone that we know." he finally said.
Tony's heart felt like a giant ball of lead in his chest, and he probably would've just sat there all night if Steve hadn't tugged on his shoulder, urging him gently to his feet.
Once Papa's own boutonnière was in place, Peter's eyes swept across his fancy dress uniform, pausing on the shiny, brand-new medal that he'd received from Colonel Phillips for his pivotal role in Project Phoenix. The medal ceremony, during which Dad was also honoured with a medal and an official certificate of appreciation, had been televised world-wide, cementing Dad and Papa's growing celebrity even more. Peter's medal and certificate, presented to him in a private, no-reporters-allowed ceremony beforehand, were both framed and hanging up on the wall in Peter's bedroom.
And hopefully, everything else would just fall into place.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 😊
"Well, the time has come for us to say, enough! The time has come for the pawns, bishops, and knights to fight back! To take down the enemy king and queen and finally win this never-ending game! And today, we are going to do just that." He tightened his fingers around Tony's hand, already dreading the moment he'd have to let go.
Dad was trying to fix Uncle Thor's ship so he could remove the Tesseract from Earth, hopefully once and for all, and that was a mission that Peter was not at liberty to share with anyone, not even Gwen. Dad and Papa had decided while Peter was still in his coma that they needed to keep the theory regarding the infinity stones a secret for as long as possible, both to avoid a public panic and to prevent the U.S. government from trying to take over from the Avengers when they had no business doing so. At the moment, to the outside eye it appeared that Tony Stark was just lending his mechanical abilities to a member of his team, who just happened to be the god of thunder, and nothing more.
Dad bit his lip, his fingers white-knuckled around Steve's hand.
"What's wrong with me?" Steve asked, aghast. "Tony, you sound awful, and you're burning up! We need—we need to get you to a hospital right away! JARVIS, please call—"
glad that it did."
" Tony yelled as the thing swung its massive fist, hitting Steve square in the back and sending both he and Tony careening towards an old rusty fence near the far bank of the lake. Tony managed to turn just in time to prevent Steve from being slammed against one of the metal posts, the impact allowing Steve to escape from Tony's grip and immediately launch his shield at the water monster.
"So then it should be fine," said Sam. "The guy will be gone, the drug will be destroyed, and we can all move on."
All the time! Choking on water that's not even
Quill stepped back, looking Peter up and down. "You are? What's your name?"
"Uh huh."
Peter tapped the tip of his pen against the book, his lips pressed tightly together. No wonder Papa refused to get help for the nightmares that plagued him almost every night. He tried so hard to hide them from Peter, but like Dad, Papa often discounted—or simply forgot—how well Peter could hear now, especially in the middle of the night when there wasn't anything else happening in the penthouse. And while his dads' bedroom could be soundproofed—thank
When no further response came, Tony dove down, skimming along the underbelly of the ship as Sam followed at drafting distance, guns at the ready.
"Yes, I will," stated Shuri. She glanced up at Peter, then towards another of the floating tables about halfway across the room. "You are also injured."
Natasha smiles.  “Don't you mean, ‘when’?” she says, quickly adding, “no, no, don't answer that.  I’ll let you get to work now, hmm?”
He tapped open the memo, scanning through several pages of the usual obtuse government jargon for anything of actual importance. What was it with these government types that they always had to make everything sound so complicated?
Peter gave a short nod. "Thanks."
"All right, then we just have to figure out who'd be able to supply these alternative materials," said Steve. "JARVIS?"
"No, no, no!" Uncle James was saying as Peter stepped into the hallway. "That's not at all what I'm saying, sir! I'm only asking that someone from the JAG's office look into what the statute of limitations would be in a case like this!"
"Got it!" said Dad. "Piece of cake, Quill!"
"Oh, I don't think it's so much an honour if it's deserved," O'Brien said with a rather ominous grin. "And dare I say that you've deserved every single honour and promotion that the Air Corps has seen fit to bestow upon you. In fact, I've also put in for a medal of bravery to be added to your record for your selfless act following the recent accident. There's no doubt in my mind that Captain Barnes would have been tragically lost if you hadn't been there to break him out of his aircraft."
Plus, Steve loved how much Bucky adored Peter, especially given how instrumental Peter was in Bucky's recovery.
Squeezing his eyes closed, Steve inhaled a deep, shuddering breath, trying to calm his thundering heart. He could still taste the saltwater on his tongue, still feel the searing pain shooting throughout his body from the skyrocketing water pressure.
He knew how precarious his condition was, he didn't need to be constantly reminded of it.
Maybe he’d have to start masturbating in the mornings too.
What Steve wasn't prepared for was for Tony to emerge from the bathroom shirtless, something he hadn't done since before the Battle of Wakanda. Nor was he prepared for him to slide underneath the covers and immediately crawl into Steve's lap, pressing his lips to Steve's before he even knew what was happening. Steve whimpered as Tony licked into his mouth, his hands curling around Tony's slender waist as Tony's fingertips glided down Steve's front to slip underneath his thin tank top.
"I copy, Mr Man!" replied Quill.
The penthouse was eerily quiet as Peter crawled up onto the ceiling, carefully making his way down to Dad's lab. His web fluid was being stored with the rest of his chemistry equipment, which was far enough away from Dad's area that he should be able to go unnoticed as long as he was quiet enough, but Peter was still relieved to find Dad conked out next to one of his workstations when he got there, with code strings running across the monitor and a half-empty coffee cup next to his elbow. A lump rose in Peter's throat at how freaked out he knew Dad was gonna be once he realised that Peter had skipped out on the dance, but he was hoping that getting Papa back alive and taking down HYDRA once and for all would be enough to make up for it.
"Me too," said Gwen. "Sounds like fun!"
“This is gonna help, Buck,” Steve said.  “It’s gonna help all of us.”
that.  I really, really do!”
"Thanos got the Reality Stone," Gamora said sadly. "We tried to stop him, but… he had already acquired it by the time we got there."
Despite his attempt at bravery, Tony couldn't help but flinch as he heard the doorbell echo inside the house, followed only a few seconds later by the sound of slowly approaching footsteps.
Peter's shoulders sagged, nearly causing him to drop his History textbook. "Yeah, me too," he said sadly. "But you know my dads. There's no way they'd leave me here by myself after what happened at the Compound." He didn't add that despite having to be away from Gwen yet again, he was actually looking forward to getting to see Wakanda.
"All right, all right, all right," Tony said before the kid's voice managed to shatter every single piece of glass in his office. "I'll… I'll talk to Steve sometime this evening, okay?"
"I don't know, Steve," answered Bruce just as the man let out a very soggy cough, jumping back when a bunch of water ran out of his mouth.
"Good. Glad I programmed you with a sense of humour."
Tony thought bitterly as he unlocked his office door. Then he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and sank down onto his chair, pushing all thoughts of Rhodey's injury and Captain Rogers' sweat-plastered hair out of his mind as he imagined the huge smile on his sweet son's face when he told him that he'd gotten JARVIS up and running.
"Pardon me, Master Peter, but Mr Stark reports that his telephone call has concluded," JARVIS interrupted. "He is ready for Sergeant Barnes now."
It took Steve's mind about three seconds to process the fact that Tony was actually giving him permission, during which Tony's beautiful brown eyes flicked between his own and his lips so expectantly that Steve could barely breathe. Once he finally made the connection he wound his arm around Tony's waist, drawing him closer as his other hand came up to cup his cheek.
It’s not unheard of for swimmers to try to get into each other’s heads before a race.  Steve’s experienced it probably a hundred times over the course of his career, and he’s always been able to shut them right back out again.
"Well, I'm sure it won't be the last word you make up in your lifetime," said Dad. "I'm pretty sure that the boy who saved the entire planet is allowed to make up as many words as he wants."
“I’m positive,” answered Peter.  He was already thinking of where he could display the set in his room.  At the moment his collectible
He trailed off as Dad looked up at him, starting a bit as if he'd just noticed that he was there, his eyes red-rimmed and bloodshot and so full of terror and anger that Peter had to look away, ashamed.
"We definitely will," said Steve as he squeezed Tony's hand. "And on that note, Tony and I need to be going. Peter's been pretty tired lately, and we don't want to keep him waiting." He pulled out his wallet, intending to pay the bill when James stopped his hand.
"Great!" said Peter. "So… what're we gonna do with 'em now?"
"Well, I'd appreciate it if you could bear with me for a moment, Anthony, because I'm a bit confused," Hammer said, clasping his hands together. "How exactly am I at a disadvantage here? Because I know I'm not quite the expert on military tactics as Captain Rogers might be, but I do believe that—"
Steve pursed his lips, hugging Peter even tighter. "I'm fine, Tony, and—"
"Yeah, okay, but none of this explains where the hell he is now!" Tony looked over at Gwen, whose cheeks were wet with tears. "You saw him leave?"
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
"Uh huh," Peter said. "'Night."
He was saved from having to think of something else by the arrival of their teacher, and proceeded to spend the next fifty minutes putting the final touches on the latest design for his web shooters. He had also recently come up with yet another Spider-Man suit design, wanting to be as prepared as possible for when Dad and Papa finally agreed to let him start training again.
"So, does this trip you're going on have anything to do with the attack you guys had up there at the Compound?" Ned asked.
"It very well could," replied Thor. "And if that is the case, then it will also be imperative that we somehow remove at least one of the stones from Midgard. It is far too dangerous to have so many in such close proximity."
Steve let out a contented chuckle as he emerged from the bathroom to find Tony already dozing on the bed, his computer still on his lap and his glasses askew on his face.  He had taken Peter to a Mets game that evening, the first baseball game he’d gone to in over a decade, and had arrived home to find Tony holed up in his lab working on the new power source he’d been developing.  After regaling Tony about the game for almost half an hour, Steve had finally shooed Peter off to bed, allowing Steve to try and cajole Tony into doing the same.
"Well, hello there, young man," Ma said in her best nurse's voice. She reached her hand to cup Peter's pale, round cheek. "You're sure a sweetheart, aren't you?"
Tony wasn't aware of how much time had passed. It could've been seconds, minutes, hours, or even centuries for all he knew as he sat there, his eyes never once straying from the ashes that coated his hands. Clung to them like the stubborn moss that used to try and climb the walls of the Malibu house.
“I am the luckiest guy in the entire world,” he added.  He brought Tony’s hand to his lips, kissing it over the ring.  “Thank you, sweetheart.”
"I could use some help searching the building," said Natasha. "If HYDRA's going through all of this trouble, then I'm guessing there's still something here that they want."
"Oh, now, Captain, there's no need to be rude, is there?" replied Doctor List. "After all, we're all on the same side here, aren't we?"
Steve gasped, causing him to choke on a mouthful of his superwater and prompting Bucky to pound on his back.
"No, no way in hell would he joke about something like that," agreed Sam. "Wonder who it is? Gotta be someone pretty damn smart if they've managed to hurdle over all the military scientists this late in the game."
they thought that might work?"
Tony thought, his heart lurching painfully as they entered the atmosphere, emerging a few seconds later over an Earth that was both the same, and yet very, very different.
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered, brushing his fingers across Steve's chapped lips. "Rhodey'll know what to say, okay? Pete's only gonna worry more if he hears that something happened without any of the important details attached."
"Yeah. But, as to why they're suddenly attacking Wakanda instead of New York, we don't know, and we also don't know why they stopped after only one blast. Papa's working with Fury to see if we can get some sort of dialogue open with the Wakandan king, but until that happens we probably won't learn anything else."
“Yeah,” murmured Steve as he let out a shuddering breath.
"Tony!" Steve said, chuckling as he shook his head. Only Tony Stark would try to flirt while sick as a dog.
"As always, sir."
“Nah, Pete.  You know you don’t have to worry about me,” Tony cut it.  “It’s nothing I haven’t done before.”
"Yeah, well, give the guy a break, okay, Sam?" Steve said, grinning. "He is almost a hundred years old, you know."
And that was if the procedure even worked, which despite assurances from both Colonel Phillips and Howard, Steve knew was not necessarily a given. The serum had been successful with Steve, even more so than Colonel Phillips—and General O'Brien, for that matter—had ever anticipated, but he was still only one person, one test subject. There was no way of knowing if the same effects would be replicated this time around.
"How does it feel,
"Very good, sir," said JARVIS. "Captain Rogers has acknowledged the message."
"Oh come on, Steve!" Bucky said. "In trouble with who? It's not like everyone else doesn't already know what's going on between you two!"
"Babe, really?" Tony suddenly said from the far corner of the living room, startling Steve enough that he almost dropped his pencil. "Why the hell are you still watching that, you know it's only gonna piss you off?"
"Do it now!" Carol yelled as she landed next to Peter, taking his free hand between both of her own, her entire body glowing in blue and yellow. "Stark, do it now!"
"Well, Fury is one of the best spies that ever spied, so if anyone can do it, he can," Tony said. "So it should only be a matter of time." He didn't add that ever since the whole Project Insight fiasco, Fury's name didn't really carry the same kind of weight and recognition that it had before, and that he might not actually be able to completely rid the world's databases of all traces tying James Buchanan Barnes to the legendary assassin known as the Winter Soldier. No sense in taking the wind out of Peter's sails unless it was absolutely necessary.
"I'm so sorry I woke you, mo grá," he mumbled. "I'm—I don't know—I just can't seem to—"
"You know. Not great, but not horrible."
, though.  Why Steve, when there has to be a dozen different regular swimming teams scattered across New York City that the kid could join?  It’s not like Steve would be barred from taking on his own swimmer, as both Natasha and Clint have several middle and high school students that they teach outside of their regular university coaching duties.  But both of them advertise their availability at those schools, which is how they recruit their students, while Steve, on the other hand, does not.
"Sketchbook?" Sharon said, replacing her stethoscope around her neck. She reached for Peter's wrist next, checking his pulse. "I didn't know you knew how to draw, Steve?"
"Yeah, maybe," muttered Steve as Tony took his hand, leading him through the maze of holograms over to the couch.
"I've got Петр here with me, Тони," Bucky said over the comm, nearly causing Tony to melt with relief. "We're in the very centre of the Asgardian army with Ванда and Пьетро, and the wizard dudes are giving us cover."
"Who the hell are you?" he demanded, causing the man's eyelids to fly open, wide with shock and fear. "Why did you attack my son?"
I’ve gotten a few questions about the difference between the CTX-616 and Aminacin that I wanted to clear up.  The CTX-616/ Cortexiphan was the original drug developed back in the early days of SHIELD/ HYDRA to help wipe Bucky’s mind between his Winter Soldier missions (and bonus points to anyone who recognises the name Cortexiphan! 🤓).  The Aminacin is my version of the Extremis portrayed in Iron Man 3, which is basically a souped-up/ slightly altered version of CTX-616.  In this series, Aldrich Killian never met Maya Hansen, who was the inventor of Extremis, and so had to look elsewhere for his maniacal purposes.
"Yeah, yeah, just don't tell anyone, okay?" Colonel Phillips said with a wink. "Can't have anything threatening my reputation."
"Mmm," Steve mumbled as he buried his nose into Tony's hair, inhaling deeply. "You smell good."
"I'd actually like to defer to Captain Rogers on this one, Mr Chairman, with your permission of course," said Tony.
But since there was no way Steve was going to make Tony face Stane alone when he had been the catalyst for the whole thing in the first place, that point was moot.  Sam had told Steve that he’d made a lot of progress over the course of the week, complimenting him several times on his work ethic while still reminding him that things weren’t going to completely improve overnight.
"Yeah. You too. We'll see ya soon."
"Sorry kid," the thing suddenly said, his eerie voice sending another freezing bolt down Peter's spine. "But this party's over."
"Hell yes, Steve," she said. "JARVIS and I are both ready."
Steve let out a heavy sigh, his fingers trailing up and down Tony's spine. "I know. But now, once he's better, he can have both. He can have whatever he wants, just like you. You both have more than earned it."
"Very good, sir."
"Okay, so… how many do we win?" Tony asked, dread burning a hole in his gut as Strange swallowed hard. The wizard's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Tony could've sworn that he almost looked sympathetic.
He felt Gwen's fingers on his cheek, tilting his head up to look at her. "Can you at least acknowledge what I'm saying?"
Steve huffed out an annoyed breath. "Yeah, I guess so. JARVIS, can you please turn off the television?"
Dad rolled his eyes, grimacing like he was in pain. "You're from Earth?"
Because he couldn't stop yet. From what he could tell, there were at least three of his fingers that were still intact, so he had no choice but to keep going.
"And I've got another simulator session in about five hours with two of your teammates, so it's fine," Tony replied. "You're not gonna be conking out behind the stick though, are you? Isn't this a bit late for the A-shift to still be up?"
"You got it," replied Steve.
Tony's head thudded against Steve's collarbone. "Long as you don't forget to take the occasional peek at your gauges and stuff," he said. "Wouldn’t want them to get jealous or anything."
He had actually
"Uncle Bucky says his arm's been acting up ever since the bunker battle."
Tony was stable. For the moment, at least.
"Yeah, well, right now you don't get a say in the matter," Tony said, probably a bit harsher than necessary when Steve frowned. He tugged on Steve's hand, halting him as they reached the living room. "Look. I just can't have you going somewhere without me being able to keep track of you." He paused, wincing. "Okay, that actually sounded kinda creepy, but you know what I mean. I can't—Steve, I just
"That's my boy," Tony said proudly. He stole a quick glance at the ball field, quirking an eyebrow as one of the dudes swung at a pitch he had no business swinging at.
A pause followed, just for a heartbeat or so, but still long enough for Carol to shoot Steve a very confused side-eye.
"Steve," he said as he looked into the concerned blue eyes of his husband. "I need—I need to get to the lab—"
"Very well. But may I remind you that adding any additional protocols could possibly delay target acquisition and firing."
Gwen whipped around in her seat, glaring at Flash around Peter. "You know, I would've thought you getting dressed down by an actual god might've taught you to keep your mouth shut, Flash," she retorted. "But I guess not even that's enough to get through your thick skull."
Gwen's eyes were as wide as saucers as she took the laptop from Peter's hand. "Yeah, I guess I did. Those are some pretty fast reflexes you've got there, Peter Stark-Rogers."
Well, maybe “funny” isn't exactly the right word.  And it’s definitely more than a bit, too.
But then, even the yellow beam that had attacked the pilots after the trial mission had gone after Uncle Bucky instead of Papa, so it still didn't make any sense.
To their log cabin on the lake, which, thanks to Steve's signature on the lease he'd just presented to Tony the night before, was now officially theirs.
"Mmm. You had another nightmare," Tony said. "Didn't you."
His hand on Tony's shoulder, Steve raised his other hand to knock, then hesitated, not quite mentally prepared for what he might see. Despite Ma's best efforts at caring for him, Peter's condition had already been deteriorating before Steve left on the Phoenix mission, and the thought of him being even worse now, of him being hooked up to even more machines and wires and tubes and not able to interact with Steve or Tony at all, had Steve's chest so tight that he could barely breathe.
"This is what I want, Tony," Steve insisted. "I want to be by your side, and for you to be by mine for as long as forever is, okay? Now, keep your eyes closed, and imagine that I'm right in front of you, asking you this: Tony, will you marry me?"
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas, allthesinnersandallthesaints, JehBeeEh, and She’sLikeTexas ♥️
"I concur," Steve answered, squinting as he searched for anything they might have missed. "Looks like we got 'em all."
"No, I didn't figure you had," Gwen said warily. "For someone who's as smart as you are, you can be kinda thick sometimes."
"Well, that's good, but I'm still gonna tell you anyway, all right?" Steve said with a slight smile. "I thought you would've figured that out by now."
"No, that won't be necessary, Mr Stark," Davis said hotly. "I do, however, have a few final questions that I wish to ask."
He had even been avoiding spending time in the lab with Tony lately, choosing to do all of his homework in his room and completely neglecting his chemistry experiments, which, if Tony didn't know any better, almost made it seem as though Peter couldn't even stand to be around him.
are you talking about?” he snapped, pointing a shaking finger in Tony’s direction.  “Do you realise the implications of even suggesting something like that, you little prick?  How
"You are incorrigible. You know that, right?"
And most of all, in the way that Dad hadn't called him to tell him that Papa was home and that they were on their way, even though Peter knew that the scheduled time for Papa's reentry had passed at least three hours ago.
"Eh, more like the seventies," said Tony.
Tony shifted in his seat, careful to avoid jostling a sleeping Peter as the jet began its early-morning descent into New York, heading for its usual runway at LaGuardia. Steve had suggested that they depart Italy in the evening, hoping that Peter would then sleep most of the flight home and avoid as much jet lag as possible, which turned out to have been a pretty brilliant idea when Peter conked out almost as soon as the plane took off. He had spent almost their entire last day on the beach building a massive sandcastle with Bucky and Thor and playing frisbee with Clint, allowing Tony and Steve a bit more of the alone time they had so enjoyed over the course of the week. The trip had turned out to be everything that he and Steve had wanted it to be, and while he had missed tinkering in the lab, he had definite mixed feelings about returning back to the intense grind that was their current mission.
"And so the serum turned him into a monster," said Tony. His eyes flicked in Howard's direction, his expression almost unreadable. "The serum is supposed to amplify everything inside the recipient, so good becomes better, and bad—"
“February 12th, 2019,” Steve continued.  “My team sets up a meeting with a possible source of information on the illegal sales, but before we can meet up, a single sniper shot is fired into an adjacent apartment building.  Not three seconds later, the entire building explodes, trapping dozens of innocent civilians underneath the wreckage.”
"And who told you that?" demanded Steve. "Tony wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary today, so—"
tour logo.  Biting back a curse, Tony tossed the juice bottle towards the sink and ripped off the t-shirt, checking it three separate times before pulling it back on.  Then he sucked in a deep breath, preparing himself for the lecture that was sure to follow in three… two… one…
“Think it’ll do, bud?” he asked, tossing Steve a conspiratorial wink.
“Oh, no, Mr Stark,” Rhodey replied in the same overly polite tone.  “Please, be my guest.”
Tony sighed, glancing up at Steve. It was starting to look more and more like he'd been right about Peter's senses.
"Ah, you were only gone for ten minutes?" Natasha said, finding her voice. "How is that possible?"
"But you were able to kill a planet?" Peter asked, frowning. "How's that any easier?"
“Duly noted, sir,” replied JARVIS.
Ned's eyes went wide. "Um, no!" he said emphatically. "Dude, I don't have a death wish, thank you very much! Black Widow is like the most badass of badasses, there's no way I'd wanna piss her off!"
"Well, again, that's why I'm here," Steve said with a smile. "It's good to see you, Sharon."
"Oh, really?" said Ms Sharon. "They're coming up here together?"
"I usually pay someone to come over and work on the landscaping, but the last kid I hired got accepted into the university and I haven't been able to find anyone else yet," Steve explained. He opened Tony's car door, holding out his hand towards him. "Ma tries to do it on her own sometimes too, but she's getting to the point now where she just can't."
Peter's pencil flipped rapidly around his thumb as he studied his drawing of the big backyard tree, his tongue poking out between his teeth as he added the goofy crooked branch that'd always stuck out about five feet up from the ground.
"Yes, Agent Romanoff. The beef stroganoff you have prepared has reached its optimum temperature," answered JARVIS. "I have therefore adjusted the stovetop temperature."
Pepper shook her head, giving him a brief smile. "I think I'm still just a bit upset about the performance reviews, and I don't want to bias you until after you've read the proposal. When should I send it over?"
"You know, one would think that it should be me doing the, 'are you all right?' asking, since you're the one down here trying to bust up your knuckles. Again." There was no malice in Tony's voice though, only a thick edge of concern as he carefully unwound the wrap from Steve's hand and tested his fingers.
"I'm already working on a contingency plan for your boy, Tony," Phillips said. "I'd tell you not to worry but I know that's not gonna happen, so for right now I'll just leave it at that. But I promise we're not gonna just leave him there alone where he's vulnerable."
"Could now potentially build one of their own," Steve finished.
"Pete? Buddy, it's Dad. Wake up for me, okay?" Tony choked out as he pressed the back of his hand to Peter's forehead, which felt as cold as an iceberg.
"But—!"
“No one said that you're going to die, Captain,” Doctor List said quietly.  “But, unfortunately, I cannot promise that you will not come close.  You see, Dr Erskine was actually a very selfish man.  He never saw fit to write down or record his secret formula, and so for years, decades really, scientists have been forced to start from scratch in their attempts to replicate it.  But none of them have been successful.  None of them have really even come close, so, pardon me, but I’m sure you can understand just how difficult it must be.  To have so much potential sitting right there, just barely out of reach.”  His sneer transformed into a smile, a wide, leering grin.  “But now, Captain, now that we have you, well… dare I say that finally, victory may very well be within our grasp.”
"Okay, Rhodey, I'd say you definitely picked a winner there," Tony said, smirking at Rhodey's sputtering reply as he took off towards the Asgardian army, hidden under a blanket of shimmering golden shields. There he found most of the team, including Steve, who had Peter clutched in his arms with his shield held over his head.
"That I'm in love with a Stark?" Steve gently asked. "Yes, she does. I told her."
And if Dad and Steve did end up getting married, then Dad would have someone to help take care of him once Peter was gone. Dad had told Peter tons of times that he'd saved his life when he was born, and that he tolerated living in Grandpa's house only for Peter's sake. But with Steve in the picture, everything would be better. They could convince Grandpa to move to a place where he could be happier—and hopefully quit drinking for good—and then they'd be free to move into that house out on the lake that Dad had been drooling over ever since it was built.
“Oh God, Tony, I’m not—I don't know if I can,” Papa said weakly, his breaths quick and shallow as he bobbed his head from side to side.  “I don't think I can—I’m not—I’m not strong—”
look he'd had for most of the battle, but Tony could tell he was genuinely surprised at what he was seeing.
Dr Cho gave a heavy sigh. "Yes, Captain, it was a blow," she said gently. "But try and remember, Peter has a healing factor that's equal or even stronger than yours, and he was able to previously heal from an even worse injury with no apparent lingering effects. We just have to give him time."
"Uhh," Tony stammered, unable to tear his eyes away from Steve's. Was there anything that he didn't think of?
“Oh, yeah.  Like I said, hearing your sexy voice is like a soothing balm for my soul.”
"The DMZ no longer exists," Steve repeated. "Because why would it? It's no longer necessary."
It was enough to make Tony want to build a suit of armour around the entire world, which he logistically could have accomplished if the newly-elected president's National Security Advisor had agreed to allow Tony to expand the capabilities of his defence drones. But, as it was, under current federal law the drones were still only able to be classified as a home defence system, and therefore could not be legally made more powerful than they currently were. At the moment, Tony's drones guarded the Tower, the Compound, and the Stark Industries building in D.C., but so far that was the extent of their reach.
Peter smiled, finally allowing himself to chuckle. "Yeah, I guess that is something, hmm?"
And there was no 'if' in there either. After all of the absolute misery he and Steve had endured in the last several months, there was no way in
"Yeah, but that was 'cause of Mantis," said Quill. "She used to work for Ego."
(See the end of the chapter for
that we need to fix your ship, Quill," Dad said slowly, like he was scolding a very small child. "We need to get off this goddamn rock and back to Earth. Now."
Tony thought angrily.  He did wonder from time to time whatever had happened to her after she abandoned Peter at the hospital, but since Tony honestly didn't know what he’d do if he ever came across her again, he figured it was probably for the best that he didn't.
And then another suit appeared, reflecting the faint moonlight in bright spots of white as it flickered across the screen and disappeared, followed shortly by yet another suit.
"Well, your instincts are usually pretty spot on when it comes to company matters, so once you decide on something let me know as soon as possible," Pepper said. "If I need to have Beck's computer codes cancelled I don't want to give him any warning. As an R&D Supervisor he's had his hands in a lot of pies, so—"
Yet another attribute that Peter shared with Steve.  Abject stubbornness.
"Yeah, with you and Liz," Ned said. "Flash got bumped down to Varsity, and Cindy's now Scholastic like me."
Bruce dropped his shoulders, removing his glasses. "Steve, we don't even know what this is, and—"
"Copy that, One," replied Carol. "Ready on your mark."
"No, no, don't thank me," he said as she disappeared through the hole he'd just made.
"A wizard?" Peter exclaimed. "Did you and Papa actually meet a wizard today? Like, a real-life wizard?"
Thank you so much for all of the kudos and kind comments, I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story!  😊
"Yes, but not like this," said Steve. "Getting details mixed up about the different HYDRA raids during the war isn't the same as having my two timelines merging together like this."
"Goddamnit!" Tony growled as yet another simulation with his new HUD interface dissolved into a mess of pixels in front of his eyes. "JARVIS, we absolutely
"Let's just wait and see what happens first, buddy, yeah?" Tony said gently. "Now, do you wanna work on Bucky's arm, or should I?"
"Tony," Steve said softly. "I'm not perfect."
"C'mon, Spider-Man," he finally said, planting his feet.
Unable to speak, Tony could only nod.
That would be far too noisy. And not to mention the mess they would cause. Much worse than poor DUM-E would be able to keep up with.
"Actually, we waited till the third date," Bucky said, rather sheepishly. "I'd… um… I'd never been with a guy before, so—"
Tony let out a heavy sigh, pushing his glasses up his nose. "All right, then we may as well get going. Phillips already dismissed me for the day."
Three strides later, his lungs already burning from exertion, Steve reached the bank of a small, shallow river. He felt another arrow whiz by his left side as he leaped across it, swinging his right arm at a jumping war dog's head before he even had a chance to land.
The wind screeches outside of the armor. A drop of sweat hits the back of his neck.
He doesn’t think he’s been doing this grieving thing right, but Tony doesn’t have the faintest idea of how to fix it.
“It's a stabilizing agent. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. Also, that the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants.” Tony meanders into the room, casual as can be, and smirks as he pats Thor’s bicep. “No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.”
“Who are you?”
After a few painfully long moments of waiting for the explosion that will never come, Steve opens his eyes. He looks at the General, confused, until he sees the signs on the crates next to him. They read: M-56 TRAINING GRENADES - INERT.
Plus, he’s only just poked at the file, but Tony already doesn’t like what he’s seeing.
“Your father is Hades.” Zeus stalked over from where he was shoved, and leered at him.
It terrifies him.
They’re calling him Iron Man. Or well.
“There are a lot of holes in that plan.” Hades lazily takes a sip of a drink that was not there a few seconds ago.
The spontaneous long road trip in and of itself is annoying, but dealing with Senator Stern and his liberal use of a gavel is just horrendous. Not to mention Justin Hammer.
“What?”
“It’s been hard getting used to drawing again, new hands and all, but I think I finally wouldn’t make my old art teacher cry if I showed this to her.”
Pure and untainted by battle and the gods’ will.
Howard leans back from the controls. “I should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.”
Because his priority is only to get to Steve, Tony is quick to knock out the guy with a hard punch to the face. It’s not strong enough to kill, but remembering what happened won’t be easy.
It was something he could never give up.
“Maybe a sixth attempt is in order.”
“Hey,” Steve leans his shoulder against his. “At least we’ll be lost fools together.”
They pull out old tricks, attempt to take hostages, but it doesn’t work. Because he’s something new. A revelation that is long awaited.
“Of course, sir.” His AI projects multiple photos above the quartz countertop, text describing approximate locations and other details alongside it.
So, when Thor throws Mjölnir with violent intent, Tony takes a deep breath, then a gracious step to the right.
“Did you find what we need or am I wasting my time?” Hades doesn’t ask. His question is a demand tinged with impatience. The ancient, terrible power that only death is capable of seeps into the air in a way that's sickeningly familiar.
Tony makes a vague noise of affirmation and eyes his friend with blatant suspicion. It’s partly because of his presence, but mostly because of the chipper attitude.
“We’re about to start travelling soon so do what you need to before we leave.”
Tony needs to think about this logically.
the uncertainty. It’s funny how quickly things changed from him being one of the most knowledgeable beings in the Universe to one of the most clueless.
After so long, the only conclusion he’s come up with is that he needs to resign himself to Hades and his odd behavior.
Too many stares.
Tony dives without another thought, ignoring the other jet that is likely getting ready to fire another Sidewinder missile.
Looking at her, Tony thinks she deserves to look like that all the time. He hates the stress he puts on her as his assistant.
Hades is offering to help him adapt to society.
Mother breathed out heavily through her nose. Then she breathed in again.
He humiliated the boy for wanting to make swords instead of using them.
They both voice their agreements and Phillips continues, “Doc has the final decision, but I want second opinions.
“Because you don’t need it.”
His grip is firm, knuckles white.
Pure electricity isn’t like fire. It
Once Hephaestus is sure that the men are okay on their own, he makes his way back inside. He can’t forget he has another job to do.
“The truth is,” Tony looks at the crowd of reporters. He thinks of the future. “I am Iron Man.”
“Do not.” Hera said, and she sounded angry underneath a thin layer of polite calmness. “Do not act as if you are the one entitled to my son.”
Because here’s the bottom line, once they became cemented as allies, Tony would have no choice but to disclose his identity to Thor.
A breaking point.
It's always been so easy to just forget about everything else and do what he does best. Create.
So Tony steps out and embraces the cold. He lets himself admire the landscape as he begins to make his rounds around the perimeter.
He doesn’t hear what the man says, but Tony doesn’t need to.
When the elevator slides open, he finds Pepper already waiting in the living room.
“What in Hades name did you do to me?”
“I’ll begin by prefacing that this plan isn’t exactly ideal, but it’s the best we’ve got considering the circumstances.”
Hephaestus just doesn’t know about the consequences.
So, in an abandoned section of the Helicarrier’s hull, Tony braces his arms against a thin railing.
“You’d think I’d finally get the courage to come visit on an anniversary or something, but no. It’s a random fucking Tuesday in October. The twenty-fifth in fact, not that it matters.”
“Oh?” Fury tilts his head slightly.
for the mortal mind.”
It’s a story for another time, so he works and works until he’s satisfied.
Hephaestus repeats to himself that it’s
Steve turns to run a quick inspection of his team. All of them appear to be uninjured, just shaken.
So Tony spends the next two months taking the sentiment to heart, living his life on death row with the motto, “fuck everything.”
Not that Steve cares. He prefers a safe world
“Nice to meet you.” Oh nice, the guy hit the genetic lottery: pretty face
The look in her eyes is still entirely too vulnerable, but her society mask fixes itself on her face again. By the time the elevator doors open to his department’s floor, that small moment of weakness is gone. He tilts his head at her in goodbye before leaving the elevator, feeling a slight sting of reluctance to leave her.
“Joseph?” Steve’s mom had gotten up with a frown on her face, but without a sign of fear as she approached her husband. “Look at the state you’re in! Go on up and take a shower, I’ll put a pot on coffee on for you.”
“I’m off from consulting hours.” I say to Coulson before striding to my bar so that I can pour us a drink. He looks like he needs it. “What’s gone to hell so bad that Fury is looking towards little ole’ me?”
For several moments, I stay where I am, face pressed to the cool glass of my lab table, despairing in silence. Then an idea comes to me.
“Toni, I really am sorry.” I snort, his earnest gaze making it suddenly easy to remember that this is the same dork that once ate my pie and then apologized for it.
Starks have always been made of iron.
Steve turns blotchy.
Also, i have no beta and english is my second language so bear with me.
“Steve!” She grabs his chin in her hands and forces him to look at her. “We went undercover in Russia. Fury thought that there was a sleeper Hydra cell there. Turns out it was an ambush; some idiots knew that we would be the ones sent and triggered Bucky’s words.” She growls out something in Russian. “He got activated. I couldn’t kill them all in time.” The tone of her voice leaves no doubt that they were dead now. “He went after me and I only managed to stop him by hitting him in the head with a metal pipe.”
He’s still functional.
“Pep! I’m wounded, weren’t we having a moment?” She pauses, her hands on her heels before a slight smirk settles on her lips. Then she steps towards me, her lips next to my ears.
I bet if Steve saw me now, he’d realize that I’m nothing but worthless. Only my money and brain are salvageable about me.
Steve settles for following the wonder twins into the house, neither of them stopping to knock on the door.
At first, Bucky used to think that all Dad’s were like that, especially considering that Steve’s dad usually got drunk along with his dad. But then one day, when he and his Ma were over at the Rogers’, he happened to see the older Rogers stumble home in a drunken haze. He had quickly looked at Sara and Steve to see their reactions, but instead of the dread and fear that usually filled his own home when his Dad got home, they were unconcerned. Sara was still chatting happily away with his Ma and Steve was sketching in his notebook.
So it’s a surprise that Steve manages to bump into the elusive woman right in front of the main elevators outside of the employee’s cafeteria.
Surprisingly both wait for me to get my thoughts in order.
I flick my eyes behind Steve at the unfamiliar car pulling up and avoid Steve’s outstretched hand with the same movement. I open the door and see Agent Coulson’s disgruntled face peering at me from the other side of the car.
At the end they ask me the same question, “Build Jericho missile?”
Steve had left the military and never looked back once. He’d received summons and letters cajoling his returns every month. He’d always sent back the same reply: no, thank you. After Bucky received his arm and signed up with SHIELD as a Special Ops agent, he’d gotten double teamed by him and Nat as they tried to persuade him to leave his ‘boring desk job’ as they called it.
“In the meanwhile, don’t come near me unless it’s with a cure or I will activate my gauntlets and to hell with it.” I tap one of my bracers and my gauntlet comes to life with a whine. I stare into Coulson’s eyes until he looks away and only then do I tap it back off. “Nice chat Coulson.”
!” She says exasperated before throwing herself into one of the plush chairs he keeps.
He wears dark blue on black tactical gear with a white star emblazoned on his chest with twin red stripes on each side. “Since when do you dress like a soldier?” I say frowning. Beyond the outfit change, he holds himself different. Dangerously lethal. Combined with the thick beard and slightly unkempt longer hair he sports now, the soft, approachable Steve from PR might as well be someone else.
“Okay Yinsen and Nadira, we’re going to get out of here.”
“Sir, you asked for the emergency sirens yesterday specifically.” If an AI snarkiness was an Olympic sport, my baby would take first place. And I would be the proudest momma ever too. “It’s coffee time.”
He took a sip from his heretofore forgotten coffee, stubbornly locking that thought away in the back of his mind.
While gallivanting around the Middle East, I put my faithful J on the hunt for data in my own company. He helps me a lot, his reach inside my systems coming across various digital trails. Unfortunately, these are dead ends with shell companies but zero identity to who made the connections in the first place. These are obvious tie ins to who sold me out but without any concrete answers.
Fuck he can’t breathe.
Contradictions and paradoxes that would be impossible to keep up with if he was human. When ideas crop up all Tony can do when they fly past is catch it and hang on to control them.
The man grins, hideous and manic.
He has a goal and he owes it to the lives of the people he’s killed to do his damn best in making things right.
Steve laughs, but his smile doesn’t reach his eyes. Hephaestus
Too little sleep.
Experience is a bitch though, and Tony has plenty of it.
So Tony lets himself be shuffled into the car, pure vodka in hand.
He almost spits it out after his first sip.
This was a new kind of guilt-ridden pain.
The easy mood abruptly ends when Hephaestus hears shuffled footsteps behind him. He turns around to find Steve, posture as stiff as his new title, but of course, the blond man breaks the illusion by giving a sheepish smile.
“Do not slouch, Hephaestus,” Hera said suddenly. And the boy straightened immediately.
Steve has always been stunning.
Due to previous experience with electricity (Thank you, Vanko.) Tony’s fear is slightly more elevated than usual. Bad associations, etcetera.
Tony scoffs loudly at that.
Tony has let too many pay for his mistakes.
What if he slipped in front of Erskine? Or Steve? His first real friend on Earth, punished for
“I’m in.” Morita declares after a chug of his drink.
This man who is understanding and kind and never pushes.
They all stand there, listening for what caught Steve’s attention. Tony reaches out to see if he can sense any machines nearby.
Jones watches their backs as Bucky, Steve, and Tony climb down the latter and into one of the train cars.
“Agent Natasha Romanoff.”
Because that suit, even with all its flaws, is a way for him to directly destroy every weapon Stark Industries made without his powers.
Tony’s energy reserves have only recovered to about fifty percent, so he still doesn’t try to connect with the system like he wants. He does however, poke at his most advanced AI, who he feels metaphorically startles.
His mask is still down because of Loki’s cuffed presence beside him.
Before Thanos, before the sudden end and agonizing fight to bring back half the population, Steve thought he knew loss. Knew the suffocation of grief.
The boy panicked, but only clenched his fists under the table until the knuckles bloomed white.
Hermes sighs, “How about you hear the plan first?”
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” A familiar voice chides. “I thought we trusted each other.”
An oath that when broken brings about a fate worse than death.
And he understood. Really.
Leaning against the table in his small room, he taps his fingers against the reactor anxiously.
“I’m sorry.”
Hermes takes a second to follow Hephaestus’s rapidly shifting thought process before carefully replying, “Nothing. It’s true that the plan will be mutually beneficial, but not in the way you think.”
It isn’t long before he hears a pair of familiar voices down the hall.
But at the same time he’s so afraid of what she’ll say. What it all means.
It’s just…
“I fucked up.” Tony whispers miserably. “I know you don’t like it, but I can’t live like this. Those innocent people were killed because of
Ares pushed him to continuously work, and the lack of rest made Hephaestus’s energy dangerously low, even for a god.
The bomb was planted in the brush they just passed over, triggered by the motion of their passing.
Then he’s falling.
“How about Antonius?”
Great.
And then, Tony is bared open.
with every word that comes out of Steve’s mouth. At first he thought it was just him longing for a relationship like Steve and his mom.
“I don't like it.”
His breath catches.
Gods, he’s just stressed.
If that's true, then why is he here, willingly consulting with Zeus’s outcast brother?
There’s only one other person who could make that technology.
Hephaestus does laugh aloud this time, “You can count on me, sir.”
Tony laughs, a clear nervous edge to it. “Well, that’s my exit.”
But when have his feelings ever listened to what is practical?
With a final pat on the shoulder, Hades lets go to turn back toward the bike.
“Yeah, but I’ve got this to protect me.” He knocks on the Captain America shield and Hephaestus rolls his eyes. That thing is an eyesore at best. Steve continues, “Besides, where I’m landing, if anybody yells at me, I get to shoot them.”
JARVIS says, pointed. He’s clearly not just talking about larger threats.
His mind races. Simulates possible outcomes for different ways he could handle this and he just knows he has to create more stress lines in Pepper’s face.
“Do not spell at me.” Hephaestus curls his fist so hard that he almost draws ichor with his nails. He forces himself to take a breath before accidentally setting fire to the place.
The arrogance and greed in his eyes.
“Together,” Hephaestus says.
Tony barely refrains from blurting out a surprised
Obadiah hasn’t.
He decides he’s been enough of a cock tease and smirks, swirling his glass. “Using the modern calendar system, I was born on the fourth of April,” Tony says.
He turned into a complete mess in front of Rhodey last night. An emotional outburst pathetic enough to earn decades of punishment from Athena and Ares.
He feels unbelievably heavy.
“Come over here, will you?” There’s a clatter followed by a loud curse.
He should’ve used more vodka.
The kid came across as the quiet type. Bookish in comparison to his obnoxious brother.
Tony doesn’t understand until ice begins to crawl up his skin.
Visions pass far too quickly and he tries to hold onto what pleasant memories he can in the midst of rejection and loneliness.
his thoughts sometimes.
Zeus’s voice joined his thunder. Lightning struck behind him.
To his utter, tragically temporary relief, the man leaves quickly after that. Hephaestus can hear that the men have started up their terrible singing again.
“Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Howard Stark!” This time a woman makes the announcement from center stage and Hephaestus can spot the bulky microphone she used to project her voice.
He knows something is up and the Colonel won’t let it go until Tony tells him.
Hephaestus’s father, Zeus, had always been unstable.
Now he’s drowning again and he can’t fucking breathe and he’s too pathetic to save him, oh gods
Falsworth keeps his eyes on the moving vehicle. “So mind the gap, gentlemen.”
(It’s always the son looking for revenge.
Maybe it's because Tony’s soul is whole again. And once upon at time in 1943 he appeared this way underneath his glamour and just didn't realize it.
Everyone releases their tension at once when they get confirmation that it wasn’t real. Steve finally gets up and the recruits move to continue their exercises like nothing happened.
He holds out a hand and tries to make his smile reach his eyes. “It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. Also, a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.”
He hears a few choked coughs of muffled laughter throughout the room, but Tony turns toward one Maria Hill whose expression doesn’t shift.
He drops the act. “I can’t…” Tony takes a breath in. Out. “Not now, okay? I promise I’ll explain later.”
When his breath is even again and reality finally is clear, Tony forces himself to look up.
But on the other hand, Tony is not stupid. A secret spy message and the desperation required to get an unknown variable like Tony Stark involved is a recipe for a high priority situation.
bombard his mind. If he’s being honest, the cause of his worry isn’t the intrusion itself. Hades is Hades. His dramatics and unpredictability are nothing new. He’s worried because this time Hades wants to involve Steve.
as incentive for Hephaestus to follow. He doesn’t know if Carter is following, but he’ll be damned if he’ll let Steve barrel into Colonel Phillips’s tent alone.
Steve shouts across the gap, “Then how come you’re running?”
He scrambled up off the floor covered in unknown trinkets and tools, before warm hands reached out to steady him.
She did not feel it.
The implication that there is something out there that scares
“I was just thinking,” Rhodey puts down his drink. “Your birthday isn’t really on May twenty-ninth, but do you even know when it actually is? I can’t imagine gods having birthdays.”
Ungrateful little–
right before Steve brings down the edge of his shield. Only this time he does die. He loses control of his body and Tony turns into dust upon contact. It burns and all Steve can do swear and sob and cry out apologies that will never be enough.
It’s not that Tony now feels inclined to commit horrific acts, but that he simply doesn’t care about anything anymore. He’s numb.
The boy kept himself stiff, and only bowed his head in greeting.
Tony knows full well that he can’t really attack, but let’s just say that the repulsor blast he sends has a little extra something in it.
He just tried very hard not to think too much about it.
“Collins!” Jacques sighs dramatically with a hand to his chest, '
Tony inhales for four, holds for a complete seven, and releases for another eight.
If Hephaestus didn’t know for a fact that the grenade was a dud, he probably would have revealed everything and razed the place to the ground. Consequences be damned.
“Tony?” Steve scrambles to get up and raises his hand. The motion is aborted before Hephaestus can discern what it is Steve stopped himself from doing. “I thought I’d never see you again.”
“We could create a lot more power out of the same size engine.” Hades cuts him off with an excited grin.
(Who’s thinking about it? Not him.)
Because it’s easy to get lost in the what-ifs, he knows that, but Steve can’t help but think about what went wrong. He can’t help but think about how he could have prevented such an unprecedented tragedy.
She seems to understand him on a level he can’t comprehend yet because knowing all of that, she is the one to place a wrench in his hands. The one that gifts him with the ability to quiet his mind for a few seconds.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam shot Bucky a harsh look. "Yeah, okay, but if that's the case, wouldn't it be better that we have these things than someone else?"
"Okay. And you didn't wake me up… why, exactly?"
It’s a bit funny how many things about Tony are oddly comforting to Steve.
If it hadn't been for Tony standing next to him, looking so drop-dead gorgeous in his own impeccably pressed suit, he might’ve honestly believed that it was a stranger staring back at him.  One that maybe wasn’t completely terrified by the thought of wearing the same goddamn suit he’d worn at least a hundred times before.
"JARVIS, can you please activate my locator chip?" he whispered. "Broadcast it only to Uncle Clint's hearing aides, okay?"
A look crosses Tony’s face, one so dazed and confused that Steve might have laughed if he’d had the strength.  Tony’s eyes flick from Steve’s face to the hand resting in his knee and then back to Steve’s face before he shakes his head, biting down on his cracked lower lip.
Even better if Obie turned out to be a homophobic asshole who was also a white-collar criminal.
"Kowalski is here."
“Is he still in his room, J?” Tony asked as he ran his fingers through his hair, grimacing at its greasy feel.
"I'm not sure how much longer we can stand by!" Steve shrieked. A second later he heard the loud rev of a motorcycle, with Natasha and Clint appearing on the street about a half a kilometre away. Increasing her speed, Natasha jumped the barrier of thick bushes surrounding that side of the lake, skidding to a halt as she landed.
He did have to admit, however, that the fact that Steve wasn't trying to hide that they were together helped quite a bit. They had even entered the mess hall holding hands, with Steve sitting Tony with his teammates while he went to get their food, and aside from a few curious glances in his direction, no one said or did anything that Tony would've considered less than polite.
"And?" Tony asked as he set his glasses down on the bedside table, right next to his tablet and Steve's dog tags. He climbed up onto the bed, sliding over to lean his head against Steve's arm. It'd been a long day, and he was tired.
"Bucky's got control of the north side tank," Steve said. "He's gonna take it around to the west side of the building and block the escape route there. I'm already on my way to the tank on the south side."
And while it wasn't much, it was still enough to give Steve the proverbial kick in the pants that he needed to give his team what he hoped was an encouraging nod. Then he raised his own shield and planted his feet, preparing to fight.
"Nah, I can join you guys," he said. He'd noticed it was raining out anyway, so not the best weather to be driving in on a motorcycle. "I'm already busy tomorrow though."
About a thousand different emotions all crossed Steve's bright blue eyes at once, and he reached for Tony's hand across Peter, giving it a single hard squeeze.
"No!" Steve yelled as Doctor List stabbed him with the syringe, still struggling against Peter's ironclad grip as he tried to meet his son's eyes. "Oh God, what did you do to him? What did you do to my son?"
of the near-constant nebulisers, the hushed words of the doctors as they struggled to get his blood oxygen levels back to normal, the various respiratory therapists who took turns pounding on his chest to help loosen the mucus, and the haunted look in his ma's eyes as she remained by his bedside, barking out any order that she felt the other nurses happened to miss.
Tony’s actually told Steve that a few times.  Like he’s rather proud of his ability to calculate multi-variable equations in his head.

"I don't want him to worry about me, Tony," Steve said firmly. "I don't want you to worry about me either. I—"
"Ahh," he said, gasping as another freezing shiver raced down his spine. "It's—it's not a comet, Gwen. I'm afraid it's—it's—"
"I know," Steve answered. He rubbed at his aching jaw with his free hand, surprised that he still had all of his teeth for how tightly it was clenched. "But I'm not sure that'll matter all that much if he's able to convince all of the others to go along with him."
"I already got started on another batch of soup, Papa, I hope that's okay," he said as he popped three oyster crackers into his mouth. "You want Dad to keep eating it, right?"
most awesomenest thing I've ever seen! You were seriously moving faster than lightning! How the hell'd you do that, you're usually so gawky and awkward!"
"If I may cut in, Captain Rogers, I believe I have some information pertaining to current discussion that would be of interest," JARVIS said suddenly. "It is regarding Mr Beck's off-site server."
"Tony?" he gasped as tears began to spill down his cheeks. Tony was alive, as his nanite case was still glowing blue, but his vitals were already beginning to crash.
"Absolutely," Steve said eagerly, smiling as Peter flipped through his notebook. Peter didn't seem to want to talk much about himself or Steve's work, which suited Steve just fine. All the easier to keep his swirling thoughts contained.
Steve nodded as he wiped the spit from his mouth and pulled on his cowl, positive that his face was as red as Tony's armour. "Yep. Ready whenever you guys are."
Tony, is that I never knew that such a device even existed until about ten minutes ago,” Obie said.  “And
But that didn't matter anymore. Peter was back, and Tony was healing.
"We'll see, bud," said Dad. "Sleep well, yeah? I love you."
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats, his long fingers wrapped tightly around Tony's arm, clinging to him as if he was afraid he was going to drown if he let go. Tony brushed his lips across Steve's forehead and temples, murmuring soothing words as he waited for Steve to calm down. He had learned through trial and error that trying to rush Steve through one of his anxiety attacks was the absolute worst thing he could do.
"Captain Rogers' satellite deployment was completed without incident, sir," JARVIS said. "Satellite will self-destruct once I have determined that Captain Danvers has proceeded out of range."
He’s so unbelievably sexy that Steve has to stop and compose himself before he opens the door, hoping his complete lack of a poker face doesn’t give him away.
The voracity of his thought both surprised and ashamed Peter, but not enough to want to take it back. Besides the fact that he had been forced to suffer with a repairable condition for most of his life, he had also had to watch the government constantly tease and torture his own father because of him, running him so thoroughly into the ground that before Papa came along, Peter had been honestly worried that Dad might just drop of a heart attack one day from all of the stress, and that would be it.
The whole team ended up coming up to the penthouse for Uncle Sam's homemade fried chicken and mashed potatoes, which were even yummy enough to entice Dad out of his lab for a few minutes. Uncle Clint and Uncle Sam kept the conversation going discussing the plans for their latest raids, while Uncle Bruce went over his latest decoded files and lamented the fact that Uncle Thor hadn't yet returned from Asgard and that no one had heard from him since he'd left. Apparently Loki was causing even more trouble than usual.
He serves the people now. The collective instead of the few who are privileged enough to abuse their power against the innocent.
“You take way too much joy out of scaring me. You know that?” Tony asks.
He never gets the chance to follow through.
“Officially I’m not here at all.” She sighs. “Schmidt was moving a force through Azzano. Two hundred men went up against them, less than fifty came back. The rest were killed or captured.”
Rhodey scowls, but he understands the risk if the lack of argument is any indication.
Clad in a dark, practical combat uniform, a red-headed woman stands at the end of the small foyer. He spots the SHIELD logo on her outer bicep and once again has to bite back a curse.
Hephaestus feels his eyes soften at that. He really doesn’t know what he’s doing, but the gods know he’s going to do whatever he can to be strong for Steve.
Tony doesn’t finish Steve’s thought. He hates himself a little for being selfish enough to not want to hear about it.
He licks his lips and Hephaestus begins to feel oddly warm.
“And at the worst time, too. I just figured it all out.” Stane chuckles, as if Tony hadn’t said anything at all.
Tony would normally be infuriated by the gall of that, but he’s too busy staring at the projections thrown up before him.
“I have a hunch,” Tony says and then looks at Pepper. She really is the only one who can go there without drawing suspicion and he
“Hey you asked,” Tony shrugs.
He overrides the PA system and pulls up AC/DC’s
His body tenses and his mind comes up with all sorts of possibilities of who could be on the other side of that door. But after an impatient look from Hades, Hephaestus finally moves to let the person inside.
“And you’re not?” Hephaestus looks at Steve with a smile playing at his lips.
Project Rebirth, the military’s operation name for the super-soldier serum, is apparently in its final stages and only needs a final candidate.
Tony and Steve haven’t talked about what their relationship is. Weird as that may be, he can’t help but find a safety in it. So many things could go wrong if Tony brings it up.
Kind fronts can be faked. At the end of the day, Hades cannot be trusted.
So when Tony finally opens the front door to darkness and silence, he isn’t surprised.
“Yeah, that’s valid,” Tony concedes with a wince.
A massive hammer, silver and wrapped in a durable brown material (similar to leather), came down swiftly on a piece of metal.
“No,” Tony whispers. His hands are shaking.
It could just be because he’s never gotten the chance, but Tony can’t risk it. Can’t afford to.
Unlike Hades, Hephaestus feels very hesitant to use his magic around or on any of the humans.
But he can’t just ignore Occam’s Razor.
He is far too on edge. Gods, he needs to get
“Turns out these things cause lung cancer. Who would’ve thought?” He takes one out and holds it between his lips, the packet stuffed back into his jacket pocket.
It’s so far from what Hephaestus expected to see when he came here.
His reasons for witnessing the fighting firsthand aren’t entirely the same as before, although he knows they are still selfish.
Hephaestus tells himself not to panic.
The little boy jerked his head up suddenly from the echoed shout.
When he tries to sleep, his mind races.
Buried under all of the clothing, the god picks up a thin chain. Metal plates cling together once as he holds it up to the city’s lights.
He understands they are both made of metal and shiny. That’s fine. However,
And because this is a war, and the circumstances are far too dangerous to allow for anything else, only a minute later, they continue on.
– before he sees Steve throwing himself on it.
“–I’m trying to do it!”
“What,” he choked out.
“It’s so stupid, because I know this isn’t how being dead works. You can’t hear me. So I don’t know why it was just so
All of that happened decades ago. He’s too fucking late.
Just a bit.
Hephaestus is focused on the not so technical.
It was nice though, having the time and space to let fire dance upon his skin once again. He was actually doing something. Something worth
He’s probably just going crazy. Right?
“Steve!” Hephaestus whispers.
Does he think–
for being the god of metalwork, and therefore provided only the best for battle.
They’re going to leave him. He knows.
“He’s the only one with the good kind of moxie.” Hephaestus hopes he can get through to Phillips. Because he just used
“Don’t worry about it, happens all the time,” the voice has a distinctly casual accent to it, and slowly Hephaestus looks down into a pair of large blue eyes. It’s a young man, small and frail and stunning.
Nothing could have happened.
Oh gods.
time that day. It was announced that the recruit will be chosen tomorrow and to no one’s surprise Hephaestus hasn’t been given any hints as to who either Erskine or Phillips prefer all week.
“Do not get upset, beloved.” The goddess said, “I was merely pointing out the obvious.”
He just made Hephaestus promise to learn how to wield any weapons and armor he creates. Both thought it reasonable.
Looking back, it was ironic how he had given into the god of war’s demands, when all he wanted to do was create, not destroy.
"What's that?"
He was thrown off of Mount Olympus. He was just kicked out of his
He takes a moment to calm his breathing.
Steve turns away and Tony begins to internally cuss himself out.
He needs to keep his cards close to his chest. Especially around government types.
He still has so much to figure out about himself and what he’s destined to accomplish. What the difference is between what he wants to do and needs to do. It all still feels like a question impossible to answer.
In a sea of profiles, ranging from big and green to a flashback from his time as Olympus’s pet engineer, a shock of familiar blond hair stands out.
He can tell he’s making a face and people are starting to fucking stare at him. Jeez.
Tony fights the urge to shiver once again.
He hates how weak he sounds. But all he can feel is deep hurt and confusion.
Tony runs a shaky hand through his hair and stares at himself in the mirror.
Tony thinks he’s okay with this being another one.
(Steve crashed into the Atlantic believing both him and Bucky were dead. Steve was
JARVIS pauses for a second,
And there is no kill switch.
A quick glance around the workshop and Hades wills the door closed. Hephaestus can feel the power of the recording devices scattered around the room power down as well.
their relationship will never be the same, is a punch to the gut. He can’t breathe for a moment. Can’t think.
Hephaestus had to look away.
Because what terrifies him the most? Being directly responsible for someone else’s mind being wiped. Taken apart and put back together just because he couldn’t keep a simple,
Carter examines the two of them with a curious tilt of her head before a resolve washes over her. Hephaestus doesn’t see this, but he is knocked out of his stupor when Carter turns to leave, throwing a remark over her shoulder, “08:00, Captain.”
He should have though.
He sits up in bed to rub his hands over his face.
He hasn’t felt this good, this powerful since before. When his life was training, weapons, and only learning about life outside of Olympus from books and the stories others told.
But his thoughts whisper a reminder. It won’t last,
Tony rolls his eyes. “He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of our way.”
Tony would love to tell them to get in fucking line, he’s dealt with assholes like them before, except that’d be wrong.
Zeus had been much worse than Hera to a young Hephaestus.
He’s alone though.
Steve steps forward. “What did they say?”
Odin smiled with too many teeth, “Of course!”
After maybe a little too much coffee and too little sleep, he had the idea to relaunch the Stark Expo his father created and then stopped sometime in the mid-seventies.
Koios just grins. “Captain. Sergeant.”
He wondered if his trinkets felt like that, when he looked at them with a focused intensity.
Steve deserves to live a long life. Be happy.
Maybe the beratement for his failures has only been held off for the moment and the calm, friendly demeanor is just a front. He shouldn't let himself hope for anything else.
The tales that explain where it all came from, who he has to thank for making Olympus, his home, a reality.
He was wearing this when he fell.
The Titan suddenly backhands Steve across the head. The man is rendered unconscious almost immediately.
, the numbers sing smugly.)
Despite the late hour, several people remain working in the large building designated as the Allied Headquarters for this base. It’s a constant movement brought about by desperation and a lack of choice. Understandably, sleep doesn’t seem so important when a war is raging.
The god steps back and tilts his head at the weapon. Taking the cue, Hephaestus moves forward to let his power loose. Immediately, he takes it apart in the air, a blue glow suddenly tinting the room.
“Why are you doing this?” Tony yells, devastated. His eyes flicker back and forth between Stane and the weapon aimed at his friends.
Tony tilts his head back and thinks about moving back to the city.
“I won’t let you and your little friends stand in the way of my future.”
Tony beams.
But now his heart felt like it was in his throat.
And he’ll be the first to say that his morals have been thrown out the window.
and all he can see are blurry shapes and colors.
Tony bites his tongue though. He knows Pepper didn’t write it.
They find the stairs at the opposite end of the hall and make their way to each cell, releasing the entire captured infantry.
Both his friends still look baffled when Tony looks up from his thoughts. As is totally expected however, Pepper recovers first.
Armed with one gun, the older man stands between Pepper and Rhodey. Both of their hands have been cuffed to a steel bar, and silenced with rope tied brutally tight around their heads.
Hades just smiles. “Came by to say I’ve got some equipment for you to try Captain. If you’ll come by tomorrow morning?”
If the sudden lack of Lynyrd Skynyrd’s
“Fellas.” Hephaestus says, far too casual.
Most of it is useless and unclear, but the power source that’s been haunting him since 1943 sends shivers down his spine.
Steve looks like Hephaestus when he drank coffee for the first time before schooling his features. “I think I understand pretty well.”
“There’s gotta be a rope or something–” Bucky looks around frantically.
“You’re not gonna leave me alone until I let you help, huh?” Tony laughs.
“Which is why I didn’t want either of you involved,” Tony interrupts. “I knew you’d think I’m going off the deep end.”
The clock reads that it’s been an hour since he sent Rhodey and Pepper to the office.
Tony can’t stand over half the people in the room most of the time. Not to mention, the Vanko situation really wasn’t that long ago.
America (Earth in general. Seriously.) Hephaestus knows, will be nothing like the stories he was told growing up on Olympus. Older gods would talk about the planet like it was a damn playground.
Tony sighs. “I do.”
He just knows well enough to never act on it.
“No getting out of this one. Gotta be clean for the big guy.”
Tony yells out a few choice profanities when he looks down at the fallen pilot.
Outside the car window, the cliffside reveals a vast ocean. It doesn’t bring good associations.
“Five?” He echoes.
He knew he saw a fierceness in Steven Grant Rogers from the moment they met. It was in the tilt of his chin, the way his face morphed into bold conviction when he stepped into a recruitment office for the sixth time.
Sweet, amazing Happy does try to escort him up to the penthouse, but Tony sends him home early with a grateful, but firm instruction to take the night off.
Morita crouches over the transceiver while Jones listens to the incoming transmissions.
He looks up to make eye contact with Hephaestus and gestures with his head for him to come over.
Ares did not look disturbed by this. He just turned back to lead them to the celebration.
They meet in the air to a cacophony of metal clashing and blinding light.
He always has been a coward though.
Then it was goodbye sweet caffeine.
A figure hired to help the house, but ended up taking on so much more unintentionally, because Tony has no one else.
This is going to be painful. There’s no doubt about that.
Hephaestus swallows hard, his mouth impossibly dry. He scrambles to think of a reply, but his mind his frustratingly blank.
Yinsen smiles. “The Prince himself had become strong as iron.”
The idea of humans, sounded so very different. Unique.
didn’t yank Tony out of his inventing haze, then Jarvis’s voice in his head certainly does.
“Can you tell me where Hades is?” Koios hasn’t moved from his spot. He looks almost bored with the younger god’s attempts. “If you check I believe you’ll find he’s vanished without a trace.”
The thoughtful silence ends when the chorus, one by one, suddenly comes to a halt. Hephaestus narrows his eyes as he scans the room, confused by the cause.
Steve is going to have to go through all of that. His body was already exhausted after the first hike.
After a quick confirmation that any surveillance is down, he calls out for Hades. “You wanted to see me?”
That over with, Tony turns, intending to find Steve and Bucky.
Tony doesn’t believe him, but doesn’t have the energy to argue. There’s something more important anyway. “Someone’s been dealing under the table.”
He’d been somewhat confused, but just seeing this now, is it really so surprising that Hades is here?
Hopefully, he won’t have to figure out how to fake it to ward off suspicion. Hephaestus will be back home soon enough. He can prove that he is worth more than this stupid artificial heart and bad blood relations.
Tony walks out and takes the podium. He glances at the reporters sitting in anticipating, tense silence. “Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.”
Hephaestus raises an eyebrow, but the older god ignores it.
His visual systems are quick to spot the pair of Asgardians bickering on a ledge in the middle of the forest.
When he arrives in the living room, Rhodey is sitting at the bar with his jacket slung over the chair. He’s nursing a drink, likely his usual scotch.
“Sorry about the sudden attention, fellas. I guess I’m just too good looking for one pub to handle.” Hades saunters up to their table with a wink, Agent Peggy Carter to his right, rolling her eyes.
He could incorporate his ability to conjure fire like he did in the cave, but Tony isn’t sure if he should. Isn’t sure if he even wants to.
He can feel the judgement in the silence of the room.
He jumps and barely restrains himself from knocking over the mug by his elbow. As he turns to her with a scowl, he has the layout of monitors he was working on go to screensaver.
Howard continues, “With Stark Gravitic Reversion Technology, you’ll be able to do just that.” With a smirk, he turns a knob and slowly pushes another lever up.
Steve hunches in on himself. “I just… don’t know anymore.”
With only his own inventions, his own bots, for company Tony Stark becomes a greater success than Howard ever was.
The laugh Zeus responded with was ugly and twisted.
It was odd seeing someone so graceful be panicked.
Hephaestus tells himself to get over it and takes a deep breath.
“What do you mean?” Hephaestus’s easy posture drops suddenly. He turns to face Hades directly. He should have known it wouldn’t last. It never does.
innovation, the forge and the flame. Whether you're on Earth or on Olympus doesn't matter. Hephaestus, you haven't defied the Fates. You can't, really. And if you fail at a goal you set for yourself than remember that despite what others may preach, you’re not supposed to be perfect. We try our best with the domains we were given. That’s all we can do.”
The emotional rollercoaster that is Bruce’s emotions makes Tony a bit concerned and amused. More so the latter when the poor man ends up replying with flushed cheeks and a dazed, “…Thanks.”
“Tony- or uh, sir?” A familiar voice asks.
Past conversations flickered through his mind. It was so obvious. How could he be so
It was obvious from the start how physically different Zeus and Hephaestus were. The whispers grew louder, and the small boy shrank into his seat.
“I was actually just sketching a bit before you got here,” Steve says.
She is a temporary relief, around only when the spring arrives again.
So even though it’s almost painful at this point, Tony grits his teeth and puts on his best Tony Stark persona. He wanders over to the bar with a careful nonchalance. Pouring a drink gives his hands something to do, plus he really needs something if he wants to make it through this conversation. “I thought I told SHIELD I wasn’t interested.”
The room begins to morph. The hazy edges grow and grow until Tony blinks and finds himself falling into the memories once again. Is he just destined to fall forever?
But now it’s time for the fun part.
“Just please,” he squeezes just a little more tightly, “no more pushing away. Pepper, Happy, and I have been so damn worried about you.”
“I am Iron Man,” Fury announces. “Think you’re the only superhero in the world?”
Tony missed him so much.
“So I’ll be helping you make weapons for the American military?” Hephaestus does not inflict his voice to ask a question.
“Oh no, don’t worry about it! Regal me with more of your art school adventures.”
What surprises Tony the most however, is the color of his eyes.
“Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?”
Tony doesn’t think he’s ever been so proud of leaving Pepper Potts speechless.
To his surprise, Rhodey’s expression turns chastising. “Brother. We’re brothers, Tones, even when you’re being an allusive asshole.”
“What are you talking about?”
He smiles slightly at the sarcasm before directing half of his attention toward the cameras in his home, the other still focused on driving.
A few grumbles slipped, and so Ares lifted his chin up to make eye contact.
Romanoff’s gaze doesn’t waver once.
And it isn’t his powers. It isn’t his ability to manifest fire. To manipulate the very ground that they walk on to form mountains. He can shift the fucking tectonic plates in whatever way he pleases so that lava pours from the Earth. It isn’t Hephaestus who ends Stane’s life.
And his mother would ignore him again, like she did when he couldn’t find the right words and ended up stuttering like a baby right in front of his father. He had felt so
He guesses it was true, but sometimes he really wishes he had the help. Memories of working himself into exhaustion and an aching feeling of loneliness creeps into Hephaestus’s mind.
16 steps from the door.
Hera’s eyes glazed over her son to focus on her husband. “Zeus” she hissed, “talk to your son.”
“I could end this now, but such isn’t the path we need.” The Titan sighs in a mixture of annoyance and exasperation.
“Unless,“ Tony points at the doctor, “Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.”
about Steve, okay?) Really, it’s impractical to expect that it would disappear, but it’s easier to focus.
“Would you mind sharing with the class?”
He tells himself that’s the only god who really matters.
A situation, that may (likely) be the cause of Tony’s own unease.
Was she there to catch him?
His first thought is that the power source is
Zeus was going to grovel before her by the end of this. He was going to
He’s been perfectly fine with shoving the whole situation down and ignoring any desire he has to figure out exactly what those far too pink lips taste like. Thank you very much.
Koios chuckles.
For some reason his attention is immediately caught.
“Nick Fury. Director of SHIELD.”
He could imagine an affair with so much potential in one place. Of course it would be the most ostentatious and extravagant thing anyone’s ever seen, but that’s a given.
He did this. He deserves to relive the most haunting memory of Tony mixed with his worst failure. Tony watching his parents be murdered. Tony looking so, so betrayed. Tony on the floor in Siberia, looking
His arm encased in a virtual skeleton of wires and metal, Tony clenches his fist. Two sets of boots with their circuits exposed sit on the table next to him.
Tony feels like he can breathe properly for the first time in years and expands his lungs as far as they can go just to bask in it for a moment.
No one has.
comment kicks his brain back into overdrive.
So maybe the thought of drifting off, forgetting, and taking a break for even a second tempted him more than he’d ever admit…
Steve shakes the very foundation of his being. His purpose.
He's not really mad about it.
Old men and strangers come up to shake his hand. They give apologies that are void of anything except for disinterested pity.
So. Hi. I'm Max and I'm an alcoholic. 21 years old and I'm following our favorite genius's footsteps. There's definitely some irony in there. I'm not ok, but I'm getting there. I finally went to treatment a few months ago and I'm here to say things are finally getting better. I don't intend on leaving this fic unfinished. Writing this has gotten me through some dark times and personally I think it'd be blasphemous for me to just ignore that and abandon all the love that's been put into this work. I don't have a date for you. I'm sorry. I will say soon though. I refuse to let you all and myself down. I wish you all the best in the meantime.
First Tony plays the part, agreeing to build the weapon and giving them a complete list of what he needs. They threaten Yinsen and Tony claims his usefulness as an assistant, his confidence slightly faltering in the face of desperation.
It’s devastating. A yearning that pulls Tony in like an electromagnet.
It didn’t work as a distraction as much as Hephaestus wished it would, but Steve has another thing coming if he thinks Hephaestus isn’t prepared to take the base down with him.
“I liked to build things. Create. I don’t know it hasn’t really changed.” Hephaestus fidgets with his paper napkin by tearing a corner into tiny pieces.
“How can we get Bucky back?” Sam interrupts, his normally serene demeanor drawn and pinched. “I can’t stay here waiting for news. I have to do something!” Suddenly Steve is reminded that despite living quite complacently a civilian life, Sam had been for years the Falcon. The vein throbbing in Sam’s neck belies the somewhat calm façade. “I don’t give a fuck if Hydra is in Shield or not, I care about my damn husband being AWOL!”
“Sir, there is a missile locked on you from behind.” Jarvis interrupts my interrogation.
They each take a tentative seat at the other end of the square table.
But my tears keep falling and despite Steve’s soft voice in my ear, I can’t—won’t deny myself this moment of weakness. I can be strong later, right now I just need someone to hold me while this pain runs its course.
Maybe there’s hope for me yet. “Yes mom.” She shakes her head at me and leaves.
Which brings him back to his main worry: Bucky.
“Hi Captain.” Iron Man says in his strangely modulated voice. “Shield says it’s time to come home.”
“I know. And I know about Fury because I made it a priority. I kept tabs through Jarvis, he gave me the news.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Always Sir.” Jarvis’s voice suddenly crackles through Steve’s computer speakers, startling him. “How may I be of assistance.”
“Okay, I’ll be there.” I stand up and run my hands through my hair, wincing when my fingers get caught in snags. “Do I have to dress up for this? I’m still in my lab.”
So he went with it, stepped back and let her have her space. He worked like a demon, working at least three separate pieces for his newspaper at the same time. All of it to take his mind away from the shamble of his marriage.
Nat rolls her eyes and Sam just gives him A Look.
She barrels past him, then inside she gives him a slap. “Get yourself together. James isn’t dead. He’s just not …. right.”
When I’m finally breathing normally, she pulls away and looks at me solemnly. “Toni, you haven’t had a panic attack in months.”
I grit my teeth. As if my martial arts knowledge would help me in this stupid cave.
Comments and kudos very much appreciated!!
But Steve, impossibly, makes it faster than him and stretches a hand at me. “Let me help, Toni.” I look at him, unwilling to back down. Not now that I feel like a wounded animal, cornered against her will. “Just this once.”
“Well then, that takes care of the product development, the mission and statement, the candidate selection, the budget, the charity’s agenda, and leaves us with…” Pepper trails off as she flicks through information on the projection. “Okay, spokesperson. We just need to decide who will be the designated representative for the charity. Now normally that would be Toni but trust me, her schedule is jam-packed.”
have a heart attack thank you very much. “Steve!”
Steve loses Toni
An end that starts everything
He wishes that he could do something, anything to make her feel better. But he’s also conscious that only time will soothe this wound.
“Buck, I swear I’m happy for you, but I have to sleep. I’ll stop by later.”
I lurch forward, stopping only when I see Khalil’s guards pointing their own weapons at me.
“It isn’t me Stark. This isn’t mine.” He gestures at the office. “This office is Shield issued. Everything inside belongs to Shield. Even myself.”
He hands me my precious babies and I get to work with the stupid suit. “Toni, I know you’ve thought about the coincidence of Captain America’s return in active duty and Steve’s presence when you were found in Afghanistan.”
They scream at me to get down on the floor before I can speak to them. Since I don’t reply they open fire. I aim my repulsors at the men, ignoring the pings of the bullets against my armor. “Hey assholes, I just want to talk.” They ignore me, so I fire. The screams they make as the heat of my repulsors burn their skin makes me grin.
Can you imagine if he fucking kisses me?
“What do you mean I have to tell Toni?” Steve feels a twisting sensation in his gut at the thought of seeing Toni. “What about Sam?”
And now, now he’s off in Afghanistan, if he’s still there at all, doing God knows what. A flash of Steve in his tactical gear pops in my mind and I start thinking of all the ways Kevlar can be pierced. Heart suddenly racing, I get out of bed and rush to the elevator.
Fucking asshole.
Her lips twitch but she gives me a stern glare. “Please nothing outlandish. Your accountants are still in a mutinous state after your sudden decision to start 10 charities a week.” She makes her way out the stall, pausing only to say, “By the way, the meeting won’t start for at least another hour. I have to get changed too.”
“Toni, I have a passport.” Steve says giving her a look. “I’ve left the country with you before, remember?”
“Yeah,” I smile, remembering the dork. “He is.”
“Your legacy will always be war.” I turn to face him and he’s as solemn as ever. “You shut down your weapons division, but the world will never forget that the Stark weapons were the deadliest.”
At first it had been small things: she’d started working longer hours at her office, stopped sending him random texts during the day. Things that at the time had seemed inconsequential until it was obvious that what they had was dying an agonizing death. Unfortunately for Steve, he didn’t get with the program until the day that she never came home.
God, I hadn’t thought this would be so hard. “Sir, Happy is reporting that he is one block away from your location.” Jarvis interrupts my internal pity party.
When she’s gone, Steve feels like all the air has left the room and his energy dims. Steve doesn’t exchange words with Toni at all that night. But for some reason Peggy is uncommonly cold to him after they leave.
Yeah, Steve had the best taste in women. It’s too bad he always screws it up.
It makes her seem…less like a celebrity and more like someone he could get to know.
“Good, I would hate to sue you if you ever open your mouth about what goes on in my company.” I smile at him. “But I’m sure that will never happen.”
“Sir, Ms. Potts instructed me to—”
and now after I finally escape, I find out that I’m dying of palladium poison. So I don’t know Rhodey. I don’t fucking know what the hell I did so bad to deserve this!”
I’d been ambushed in Afghanistan, survived, and now had a massive hole in my chest that houses an electromagnetic field generator.  And to top it all off, the operation was made in a fucking
“He said thank you, Sir.”
Anyway, it can’t be worse than the shit I’ve done.
But maybe I can build something for myself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not at all. I’m open to recordings about myself.” She shifts her balance against the bar and winks at him in clear innuendo.
“Think for a moment Cap, how else would Hydra know that Bucky was going to be in that specific mission?” Clint says.
I fire off another two shots at his heavy weapons on his shoulders, knocking them clean off while he is still hacking his lungs out.
“Okay, so first we need to have establish a clear objective and that will serve as our mission…” As Pepper launches into a long explanation about the administrative aspects of our fledgling charity, I take the moment to zone out. I trust Pepper implicitly. She always knows how to manage my money and company better than I do.
I tap the chest piece and he immediately flinches. “Relax honeybun, I’ve made this specifically for you.”
It’s my turn to blush. “Well, I’m rich so…”
Hi, as always i'm full of apologies and lacking in quality writing. Anyway, this is the penultimate chapter for this series but as far as i'm concerned this is the end. The next chapter is merely an ambiguous time jump to the future, where only a small surprise is finally revealed.
I dictate his movements, urgency in both my words and his actions. When Yinsen can do no more, I tell him to eat and sleep to recover some energy.
Only love can.
I rattle off a list of materials, Yinsen translating quickly and tonelessly. But as soon as the man leaves, he turns to me.
“Toni!” Pepper cuts me off. I pout but she steamrolls over my protests. “Now, I think the best course of action is to get together as soon as possible to get an idea about what we could do with the foundation and of course the foundation’s namesake needs to get involved too. The sooner we do all of this the better.”
Before, when he’d been the Bonnie to my Clyde, I’d been able to read most of his thoughts going by his facial expressions alone. But now, his expression closes off, shuttering in a way that has me shivering.
And wow, that guy is really attractive. He isn’t as tall as Steve, but his lean frame more than makes up for it. He wears his chestnut hair in a messy bun, with a couple of wisps framing his face and gorgeous chocolate brown eyes. And, judging by the empty sleeve dangling next to his body, Mr. Handsome is also Bucky Barnes.
“I’ve already started the proceedings. This was just a heads up.”
Steve scoots over next to me so that Pepper can see the both of us. “Hi Ms. Potts, it’s actually my fault.” Then he launches into an explanation. Pepper looks surprised but she looks at me with understanding in her eyes. “I hope I’m not causing trouble for any of you, the last thing I would want—”
I lurch forward unconsciously, only Yinsen’s hand preventing me from doing something stupid.
Steve shuffles closer to my cot, still holding himself in that battle-ready position that belies his calm façade. “It’s classified.”
After Jarvis finished the scans, and I finally stopped freaking out, an eerie sort of calm settles inside me. This is it. This is the reason why I survived that damned kidnap attempt.
It’s this last question that makes me angry, pissed beyond belief. “Nothing! Nothing except fucking exist, Rhodey!” I’d tried. I’d fucking shut down the weapons division. I’d helped rebuild time after fucking time and
isn’t completely fascinating, but we have to get a move on. I have to take Barnes’ measurements and start making prototypes.”
Steve nearly strangles his phone, only loosening his grip when he hears the glass cracking. “Sorry, I know I’m probably bothering you at the wrong time and you’re probably very, very busy right now. It’s just that I have something really important and—”
“I can imagine.” She sighs. “Is that all Steve?”
Right, haven’t heard that one before.
Pepper sighs, the sound coming across staticky. “No Toni, your CFO doesn’t care about your image. Remember you hired her specifically because of this point?” Still leaves the… “And Director James is less than orthodox himself.”
“Sir, if I may, that is not the healthiest way to navigate life.” Jarvis’ disapproval is clear. “I believe Captain Rogers is a good man. One that is trustworthy.”
sinful voice. His fiancé is such a lucky bastard. “My—Sam said that having the charity named after me is a huge honor. So- uh thanks…”
The chopper must spot me because it turns toward my direction and hovers over the sand. I shield my eyes the best I can and when I see the man who clambers out of the helicopter, I think that I died during my escape and am now in purgatory.
He barked out a couple of sentences to Yinsen, the only words I can recognize are my name, before gesturing to me.
It only takes him and Sam fifteen minutes to be suited up and in the quinjet towards Bucharest along with the backup team. Sam fidgets and shuffles his feet the whole ride there, but Steve refrains from commenting. If it were Toni…
To be honest, I think this fic is absolute trash and I have serious thoughts about orphaning this work so that at least I'll stop being so clingy to the kudos and comments (mostly the lack of). But my mamá didn't raise a quitter so I have the final two chapters. I added the open-ending tag today because I don't think I can go through the whole canon rewrite with this Tony. Also I removed the eventual smut because honestly, I can't limp to the finish line and throw in some sexy times. I'm sorry that i'm such a trash writer and I hope I can produce better works someday.
Ah, great just what I needed.
No amount of humanizing can make Toni Stark attainable.
And yet, it isn’t just her physical looks. From an objective standpoint, there are multiple women milling around in the gala who are much more attractive than she. But it’s something about her spirit that makes her outshine those beauties. The way she defends everything with so much fervor. How she gives no quarter, no matter how much pressure she receives. It’s her iron will that makes her shine brighter than the sun, eclipsing every person in the room by her sheer presence.
Not that it mattered. Antonia—Toni—Stark was a beautiful swan with the prickly disposition to match. No reporter ever got anything other than a blast of her fierce personality whenever they tried to find her soft underbelly. And yet, her beauty detracted everyone from the bright intelligence in her gaze, the sinewy strength in her limbs, and the graceful yet dangerous stroll she always adapted. Everyone saw the beauty of the swans, but the dangerous beauty of a tiger was hardly ever praised.
I ponder over this realization for several minutes before coming to the conclusion that even if I made her CEO, my dad would use the force of his majority to oust her before she could do anything meaningful. Hmmm, but maybe if I made her CFO…
What worries me is the immense pressure on my chest that prevents me from breathing deeply. I open my eyes and see darkness. Oh god, I’m blind. Fuck! Fuckfuckfuckfuck…
For shit’s sake, I hadn’t even noticed that his
I have to find a solution. I can’t die like this. As I stalk through my lab, error messages appear on my holoscreens. By the time Jarvis reaches the last element, I’ve slumped on my seat again, eyes closed as I wait the inevitable.
Those seven months before everything fell apart were absolute perfection.
Not that it bothers me or anything.
“Yeah, count me in.”
the elusive Bucky Barnes is finally found.
, allowing all employees to take two weeks of paid leave, causing the normally bustling building to be still and silent as Steve hurries to the elevator.
Steve frowns at her assumptions. “I don’t work for the big names. I work for myself and an exclusive interview with you would put my online newspaper on the radar. Your love life might work for tabloids, but I want to focus on journalism.”
“Yeah, yeah I know the VA’s sending one of their veterans over at 10.” I poke my tongue out at one of the blinking cameras in the corner of my lab. “I’m not completely hopeless J.”
“I have no knowledge of who Ivan Vanko is.” Toni looks at the reporter and winks. “However, Ms. Everhart, I’m sure you’re just dying to tell us who he is.”
I put away my phone, then get out from the stiff chair. Despite the frequency of these visits, those stupid chairs always make me feel like I’m a naughty child getting pulled in front of the principal.
“Toni… I know that things have been difficult after your return,” she pauses, settling her body next to me at my desk. I sigh and slump on the cool surface, we’ll be here a while. “I’ve also noticed you haven’t been going to your therapy sessions I set up for you.”
Clever wordplay. Almost like he’s…worried.
make sure she knows that her efforts aren’t wasted.”
Steve looks starstruck.
And so is Tony.
When he got back, the sudden absence of Peggy’s effects made everything scarily final. Steve had tried calling her as soon as he realized what she did, but the call went straight to voicemail. It wasn’t until that evening that she called him back to tell him that she wanted to take some time away from him to think things through.
a insight to Toni
Steve doesn’t comment on the title, not up for an argument, and nods in acknowledgement to Jarvis’ words. The ride goes by in silence; the doors opening without a whisper when he arrives at the penthouse. He steps out hesitantly, unsure of what direction to take.
When she’s gone, Steve feels like all the air has left the room and his energy dims. He didn’t exchange words with Toni at all that night. But for some reason Peggy is uncommonly cold to him after they leave the gala.
When they talk about their orientation, they share a commiserating eyeroll. Every bi always experiences the bi equals cheater stigma. And so Toni Stark stops being the
The one where Steve loses his Bucky. Again
Could she have been right?
The goon, whom Yinsen says is named Khalil, looks at me angrily before shouting out commands to his lackeys. Two of them march into the room, one grabbing Nadira by the hair and drags her before Khalil while the other points their weapon at me. She screams, tears running down her face, but she quiets immediately when he places his weapon against her forehead.
