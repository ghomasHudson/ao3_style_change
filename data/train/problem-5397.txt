Steve could feel his body vibrating with anger, fear, wrongness, that gunmetal, coppery taste in the back of his throat that always tasted like seawater when he swallowed.  He was standing, though he didn’t remember getting up. His fists were clenched tight, white-knuckled, though Steve could feel the blood pounding through his temple, a shuddering-throbbing sound that drowned out Fury’s voice to a dull pinprick.  The room swayed in his vision, a red-hued tableau that Steve hated with a blinding intensity for a moment.
Steve walked over to the huge bed and stood at the edge for a moment, trying to gather himself. It was fine. This was fine.  People did this all the time.  The King did not seem cruel.  Everything would be fine.  He crawled into the bed and felt the soft mattress dip underneath him, softer than anything he had ever felt.  The carved headboard in front of him bore the same royal crest as the one above the door, though far more heavily embellished with paints and flecks of gold leaf.  He realized his hands were fisted at his sides and forced himself to open them.  Fine.  It was all fine, he told himself.
“Something public. Very public. See and be seen kind of thing. Dinner, someplace really ostentatious,” Tony suggested. “Pepper’s handling the details.”
“I'm not going to—to do that. If that's what you're worried about. I won't touch you. Like that, I mean,” Steve said, letting his head fall to his chest before turning to look at Tony. Even across the distance separating them, Tony felt pinned by that look, bug on a backboard-style.
Steve hummed, eyes going half-lidded, mouth parting.  He slid his hand underneath Tony’s neck again and lifted, pulling him up, the other hand at Tony’s waist doing the same.  When Tony was on his knees again, Steve dipped his head and pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead.  A hand smoothed down Tony’s hair.  Then Tony felt two hands grip his arms and slowly turn him around until he was facing the closet on the far wall where he had once found his knotting wrap in a box that smelled like Christmas, and he could never tell Jarvis why he got red-faced when Javis studded oranges with cloves to scent the house, and oh, God, yes, his mind squirmed, memory and the moment colliding as Steve’s hand came down, heavy and sure on his neck and pushed him downward.  One arm was wrapped around Tony’s waist, forcing his ass high into the air as his chest brushed against the bed’s comforter.  He turned his head.  The dog tags pooled next to his neck, filling his vision.
Through the glass panes that surrounded the room, Tony could see grey-coated agents working on various projects.  A holo-table floated blue schematics of what looked like part of a turbine engine in front of a group of agents, one of whom pointed at a spot with a thin metal stick, causing the schematic to instantly zoom in.
Tony did look good, Steve acknowledged, eyes flicking up and down where Tony sprawled against the edge of the door, not quite in or out of the gym. Of course he did, draped in a few thousand dollars worth of custom suit, but he also looked different in a way that sent a fissure of disquiet down Steve’s spine, settling like a stone in his stomach. He didn’t like it, Steve realized with a sharp pang, this reminder that Tony was a client, that there was some vast gulf of difference between them that had a lot of zeroes behind it.
When they got back to the suite, he’d call Rhodey. He’d call Rhodey, and they would sit Steve down and tell him everything.
He collapsed in a heap, just barely catching himself on his arm before falling on top of Tony’s chest.  His muscles where quivering with exertion, vibrating and pinging like he had run a great distance, yet he felt loose and boneless at the same time.  He was breathing hard. Sweat coated his brow.  Tony was running his hands up and down his chest and shoulders, his name and other words that Steve couldn’t quite process but understood as good falling from Tony’s lips.  Tony cupped Steve’s jaw in his hands and pulled Steve’s eyes to his.
Tony leaned down, breaking the invisible surface, and parted Steve’s lips with his own.  Steve’s mouth fell open with a soft, strangled moan, and Tony’s tongue swiped inside, hot and deep, pressing against Steve’s own.  Tony urged Steve’s mouth wider, and the kiss turned hot, insistent, Tony’s tongue plunging deep to explore, then drawing back and flicking the tip over Steve’s, teasing, licking and nipping along Steve’s lips, even tugging the bottom one between his teeth, sharp enough to sting. Steve groaned again, throat full of gravel, and craned his neck forward, straining his arms where the chain rattled against the loop on the headboard, keeping him in place.  Tony suckled lightly at Steve’s lip, almost as if in apology, then released it and huffed out a warm breath of laughter against Steve’s mouth.
—I—” he stopped, dropping his hand down in a fist against the bed next to his side and he let out a breath laced with frustration.  Finally, his eyes found Steve’s again, and his expression softened. “It is what must be. As imperfect as it is.” He sounded resigned, Steve thought. “There are rules.  I give you as much leeway as I can, but there are limits, Steve. I hope by now you would trust that those limits are there for your protection, not on some whim of mine. With Zola, then Obie—there is already more talk about you and your influence than I would like,” he added.  “It is imperative that you listen and obey, for my sake, if not your own. I can’t be seen as weak. Not even for you. You must understand that.”
Finally, he made himself get up and get out of his shoes and suit.  JARVIS checked his emails and voicemails while he brushed his teeth, deleting most of them, except a couple from Pepper.  He stopped on the way to bed and picked up the piece of paper with the doodle of flowers on it from the dresser, staring at it for a long moment before carefully putting it back into place.
Just thinking about his Heat made his stomach turn and chest heave with shuddering breaths.  It had been years since he first hit puberty, and the beginnings of what would settle into his Heat cycle started.  He’d thought he was prepared for it.  He’d read the little yellow pamphlet his mother had given him, with the brightly smiling Omega walking on a sparkling beach, enjoying the warmth of the sun while her toes dipped in the waves, thrilled to be welcoming her first Heat.
The stories.  He remembered the stories, after all.  Truth or tale, they came from somewhere.  Here, Steve thought with a start.  They came from here.  The lights. The sounds.  This is the lair of the Shadowman, where he takes the naughty children he steals in the night.  Except, of course, it wasn’t.  That was a story, nothing more. He was going off to war soon. A soldier. Not a terrified child running from his father’s wrath.
Steve knew about that, though.  He knew Obie had been selling weapons under the table, and he knew that those weapons had ended up in the hands of the Ten Rings at Gulmira.  He knew those weapons—Tony’s weapons—had probably killed some of his unit and had cost Barnes an arm and left both of them with a lifetime of recovery.  Hell, that was at least part of the reason why Steve had agreed to this insane scheme in the first place.
“I--” Steve stammered, shaking his head as the cold wash of realization coursed through him.  “You...you did this to me, you--why? What do you...what do you want of me? Why would--”
Tony shivered, skin prickling, and slowly closed his eyes.  Heat pooled low in his stomach, a tight, pulling sensation pulsing through his groin to the tip of his cock.  Shit, he thought, flopping over on his back.  He watched the ceiling fan rotate over his head, around and around without end.   My Alpha pushed an R8 off a cliff because I was jealous.  I feel like we should be talking about this more, Tony thought with a nervous rush of hysterical laughter that made him turn his head into his pillow to quash it.  SHIELD did something to him.  No sense in pretending any of this was normal.  Not anymore.  He had an empty garage where plausible deniability used to be parked.  SHIELD did something to Steve, and when it went sideways, they had their little rose ceremony of Omegas for him and for some reason, he picked Tony.
Fury made a surprised sound in the back of his throat, then pursed his lips.  “Well, I suppose his parents could be persuaded to agree to some kind of pre-Bonding meeting under the circumstances.  That is what this is, right Captain? Assuming his parents consent, which they will with what will probably be just barely the minimum acceptable show of protest, you want to Bond with Stark?  And by you, I mean Steve Rogers,
“It’s pretty common, guys coming back from injury like that.  For there to be issues, I mean,” Rhodey clarified.  “If you’re talking about it, that’s good.  He really quit?”
Steve’s presence in Tony’s workshop began purely as a tactical project, gathering information about his teammate and the armor so they could be more efficient in battle.  Steve did much the same with all the Avengers.  But Tony loved talking about his tech, and Steve found it fascinating to just listen at first, though it wasn’t long before he was asking Tony more specific questions about what they could do and how they could do it.  Which led to a lot of field testing that generally involved Tony throwing Steve at things, but Steve got to fly, so he didn’t mind.  Much.  The time with the fountain had not been forgotten.  He was pretty sure that was on purpose, no matter what Tony said.
“I have to go away for a few days.  I’m sorry.  I know the timing—the timing’s bad,” Rogers was saying.  “Take these.  Show them to Coulson.  He’ll know what it means.  Tell him anything you need, and he’ll make it happen.”
Tony found himself talking, too.  About Jarvis and birthday cakes, watching the sky through his window, the boarding school that almost was, and, sometimes, even He Who Must Not Be Named.  Steve tried, very hard, to listen.   Tony didn’t think it was in Steve’s nature to just listen, not when there was the possibility of a twenty-step plan to solve whatever it was bothering Tony.  But, he tried, so Tony counted it as a win.
He forced his hands to leave Tony’s shoulders before he did real damage, gripping the sheets instead. For a moment, Tony’s warmth left him and the shock of the cold air was enough to snap his hips up, seeking, but then the tip of Tony’s tongue grazed the dripping head of his cock and Steve felt his whole body draw up like a bowstring, muscles bunching and tensing as if electrified, as Tony wrapped his mouth around Steve’s cock once again, engulfing him and he was pretty sure he was shouting something, groping blindly to try to warn Tony away as he came in warm spurts, drawn out by Tony’s mouth as he swallowed around Steve’s shaft.
A burst of hysterical laughter rent the air, almost startling him.  It took him a second to realize he had made that kind of sound.  This was what Steve wanted to tell him.  MIT.  Steve was sending him to college.  To learn.  To get better.  Because that would help the company.  The company.  God, of course.
Tony was silent, back hunched over the worktable, but still now.  Steve wished he could see his face, but Tony was still refusing to look at him.
could do that again. Stupid, probably, I don’t know,” Tony husked out, opening his eyes to find Steve’s dark blue ones looking down on him with an expression of nearly unbearable tenderness.  The kind of gentleness that was laced with fear of failure, like Tony would turn to dust(sand) in his hands if he wasn’t careful.
“Sorry,” Steve said, stepping away from the group.  He took Tony’s hand in his and gave it a light squeeze, then leaned down and pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple.  “Missed you.”
The next morning Tony woke up on top of Steve again, his body shielding most of Steve’s from whatever his lizard brain thought might happen in their bed at night while they slept.  He supposed this was some issue when Alphas were trying to protect their Omegas in caves or something, but now it was just like having his own Steve-shaped body pillow, so yay for evolutionary throwbacks.  He stumbled downstairs to the kitchen and grabbed a coffee mug from the shelf.  Bruce was sitting at the table reading something on his tablet and having an omelet.
A covered pavilion awaited them on a semi-barren patch of land marked by a grove of sparsely-leaved olive trees and a tall palm with spiky fronds that curved the branches so they hung low and shadowed the ground.  Tony, General Rhodes, Marshall Strucker and a handful of guards rode on some length, towards a section of the wall that seemed to be undergoing repair, while the carriage halted, and the driver hopped down to open the door and place the step down for Steve and Cam to alight onto a long, thick rug that created a path over the parched grass and rock to the pavilion.  Feet must not touch the sand, Steve thought with a carefully schooled expression as Cam shot him an astute look.
“You really Tony Stark?” a woman in a bulky coat clutching one of those reusable bags proclaiming it a big, brown bag on the side cut in, leaning forward a bit in her seat across the aisle from them.
“He moved.  Squeezed my hand when I asked him, then started freaking out, pulling at the wires and stuff you’ve got in him,” Tony explained giddily.  It was adrenaline and relief animating him now, he knew, but it felt like flying.  Better than flying.  It was the moment of acceleration after the freefall, everything snapping back together in an instant.
He could hear the sounds of metal clanging, and the rush of air that he knew was the forge’s large bellows.  A muttered curse, and something in a low tone that Steve couldn’t quite parse, though he knew Tony was sometimes wont to speak to the parts of his forge as if they could hear him.  Steve felt a smile curve his lips, the first in a long time, and though his steps slowed, something in his chest lightened, lifted and was gone.  He had missed this.  Tony.  The swirl of energy around him.  The constant sense of being slightly off-balance, as if caught mid-fall.  The hum of activity.  The feeling that something, some happening, some incredible possibility that shouldn’t find footing was imminent, though he could never quite name what it was.
“Don’t use the acronyms.  I’ve told you,” Rhodey cut in.  “You hit on—ohhhhh.   Was he the smug one you kept yammering on about?  Hot Disapproving Guy,” Rhodey recalled with a snap of his fingers that Tony could hear through the phone.
“No.  No, I don’t.  I wish we were, but, no, I don’t,” Tony said flatly.  “Even if we’re right, it doesn’t do us any good if there’s no proof.”
you see?  Impressed them.  How much thought he’d put into it.  He did it, too.  We had eight dealerships by the time he sold them.”
There were records though, if you knew what to look for and where to look for it.  You had to read between the lines.  Mingi, the cursed children who brought bad luck to some tribes in Ethiopia.  The lost ones, they were called by some of the indigenous Pacific Islanders.  Filipino stories told of Aswangs, who sicken and die quickly.  Various cultures seemed to have some lore about it, these children who were born wrong.  It probably didn’t happen all that often, but it must have happened enough to scare people, to make them create these explanations for something they couldn’t control and couldn’t understand.
He jumped in startle when he felt a light touch under his chin and realized the King was standing in front of him.  The room was quiet, though Steve hadn’t noticed, so lost in his memories for however long he had been drifting.  The King made a vague noise in the back of his throat and tilted Steve’s chin up again, the way he had before.  His thumb traced the line of Steve’s jaw, and Steve saw something flicker in the King’s eyes as they seemed to darken.
“I would like that,” Steve said instead of loosing the argument forming on his lips. “Though, I might be the only one in the castle who will agree,” he added, then paused, frowning. “They’ll blame me, won’t they?”
“You had a fish doctor come look at them when you thought one of the Dinners looked under the weather,” Steve reminded him, though there was a smile behind the words.
“You ever actually grill before?” Rhodey asked, looking down at the grill’s display, which was blinking ERR.
How many social rituals were built upon the idea of finding your soulmate?  Handshakes, kisses on the cheek, hell most cultures had adapted some greeting that allowed for touch. Just in case.   He'd been accused of everything from snobbery to germaphobia for his refusal to touch people, even to take things from them, but he had long ago tired of a polite ritual that left him unable to stop hoping all the while knowing each touch was going to end in disappointment.
“Not being a dick about it?”  Steve filled in, eyebrows raised in challenge for a moment before he shook his head and turned around to face Tony.  “Apologize to your assistant for me.  They didn’t mean—I’ll talk to them.”
“I will see to this,” Tony promised, pulling back slightly.  “You must allow me to—I will fix this.  Make it up to you.”
“About your sin-fueled epiphany?  ‘Course not. Though, I’m going to randomly laugh about it, and she’s going to think I’ve lost my mind.  Worth it, though,” Bucky said, walking over to the elevator and pushing the button.
Overwhelming denial, that’s what it was, Steve decided as Tony batted his shaking hands out of the way and hastily tore off his tuxedo jacking, tossing it to the floor in a heap.  Tony was the stuff of fantasies to begin with, but now that Steve knew the man behind the façade, all those furtive, forbidden thoughts kept playing across his mind like one of those old Viewmasters he and Bucky used to play with, except the thoughts occasionally got stuck on the white space in-between images, where the picture in his head was partly some old, haphazard thought of Tony
Steve sighed and shrugged on the robe, then glanced over to where Tony was climbing up a ladder that extended down into the water from the platform that held the bellows.  One of the slaves hurried forward to assist with removing the helmet, revealing Tony’s grinning face.  He waved at Steve and Cam, then held up a netted bag full of shells and rocks and whatever struck his fancy while he plodded across the seafloor.  It wasn’t really about those things, of course, just being able to do the impossible.  To look at some wall everyone else accepted as the way of things and find a path around it.  Or, through it, Steve mentally corrected.  That was Tony.  Always looking to what could be done and ignoring the notion that anything could not. Steve watched him undo the buckles that held the leather suit in place, then shimmy out of it, abandoning it to be dried out for the next time he decided to thumb his nose at the way things were meant to be.
call. We were doing our jobs, and we all knew the risks. We knew the chances going in, we knew they were moving black market weapons, we knew the situation with the RPGs.  Hell, I’d seen the satellite photos myself. But, they were the bad guys, and we’re supposed to be the good guys. We don’t get to just take the easy jobs,” Steve said in a hard, fierce voice.  He blinked at Tony, mouth flattening. “Sometimes, that doesn’t make it all that much easier to take when things go wrong, but the guys in my unit, they didn’t die because of you. They died because of the Ten Rings, because of that man there,” he said, pointing at Obie, “and they died
“Feel better?” Tony asked carefully as he grabbed a towel from the beside table and wiped off his hand.
“Not anything of Erskine’s. Not exactly, anyway,” Bruce amended, eyes watching Tony and seeing entirely too much, too clearly. I should go, Tony thought, the need to flee before Bruce said whatever it was he was holding back, and it was clear he was holding something close, a hidden card he didn’t want to put on the table. Tony didn’t want to see it, wanted to keep playing the game for as long as he could, but he was rooted to the spot, a mild buzzing filling his ears that he recognized as panic.
“That's okay, too,” she replied, coming over to stand next to him and rest a hand on his shoulder. “We'll help you figure it out.”
“There was…I was…the ship I was on, it sank.  I almost went down with it, but somehow…somehow, I didn’t, and then…Next thing I remember, I was on some raider ship, shoved into a hold with more people than I could count,” Steve told him.  He didn’t tell him that when someone got sick, they dropped them overboard and how you could hear the splash, and how your stomach said that was a little more food for you.  He didn’t tell him about the sounds from the deck above, when the crew would take some of their captives upstairs, or what they looked like when they were returned, if they were, all hollow-eyed and broken.  Today was the day for half-truths and kind lies, he thought with a fissure of disgust curdling his stomach.  “We ended up at the port. The overseer from the slaver station there, he found me.  Then Sitwell came.”
“Tony,” Steve said, reaching out and placing a hand on Tony’s arm.  His grip was light, but it held Tony in place when he wanted nothing more than to run.  “I really did have a good time tonight.”
do.  Of course, you did it.  But perhaps it was different with the Others, Anto thought.  He suddenly wanted to ask the Stranger if he did anything other than make grass-bears and baskets.   If he could. Anto suddenly wanted to ask the man if Omegas of the Others hunted, if they built things that no one had built before, if they could think about the counting sticks, or if he was the only one who was like this.
Tony stepped forward and wrapped his arm around Steve’s waist.  He nudged Steve’s foot enough to for Steve to catch on and plant his feet on top of Tony’s boots.  Steve threw an arm over Tony’s shoulder and slid one around his middle.  The repulsors ignited, bright, blue flames sending them twirling into the sky.  He looked at Steve, head tossed back, a wide, giddy smile splitting his Alpha’s features as the ground got smaller and smaller beneath them and the halo of grey-blue sky growing thinner above.   The dog tags jumped between them with the force of their ascent, stretching out towards Steve’s chest in a thin chain of pebbled metal.
All those scenarios seemed to leap to his mind as he stared at himself in the mirror, wondering what Anthony would think when he saw Steve in person for the first time. The dress uniform was probably too much.  He should have gone with something more casual, but he didn’t have much to choose from, and, well…he wanted to make a good impression. He’d pinned most of the medals on. Some stayed in the drawer in their little satin-lined boxes that made Steve think of rows of coffins. Sometimes, when the government didn’t know what to do with the terrible things it asked soldiers to do, it gave them medals, Steve had learned a long time ago.  He thought it might be more true now. A lot of them were new. Bright, shiny apologies for things no one wanted to talk about anymore. He left those.
“I blame Tony,” Barnes said as Steve stepped out into the hallway to let him pass.  He was holding his George Foreman grill, or what was left of it, under one hand.   “Why you gotta mess with everything?”
“He said it because he knew that it would garner a reaction from me, and I—I fell right into that trap, even as I saw it coming. He isn’t happy with me and my plan to arm his rivals, you see,” Tony explained. “Tarn values power above all else, and I threaten his continued acquisition of that. He wanted me to know that he knows what I value most,” Tony finished with a sigh, his gaze locking on Steve as Cam helped him take the elaborate robes off and remove his veil.
Tony blasted another one with his repulsors and started to head back into air when something slammed into him from behind, knocking him through the bus windows and out the other side into a storefront.  He came to a moment later looking up at a row of cupcakes in confusion.  He wondered what Steve’s favorite—
By the time they made the kitchen, Steve was back to being happy with life, at least until Tony tried to find a place to put him while he scrounged for food.  He finally set Steve down on the floor amid Steve’s insistent protestations and raised hands and stepped out of the suit.  Which, well, that certainly got the kid’s attention.
“I’ve dreamed it every night since I woke up in the hospital after Loki’s spell,” Steve continued, as if Tony hadn’t spoken, eyes still locked on Tony’s face.  Oh.  Well.  That’s.  Oh.  What is that? Tony’s mind rumbled, grasping for anything that resembled purchase.  What is that even supposed to—okay, first do not read anything into that, because Steve’s head is not in a good place right now, and you can’t just assume it means something because…because… “It’s always you.  Why is it you, Tony?” Steve asked, no, demanded.  Tony knew the tone well enough to hear the difference.  “Why is it you?”
Tony’s first thought when he woke the next morning was that his head was clearer than it had been in days, though he quickly realized that wasn’t exactly the right word for it. He was…centered. Yes, that was it. Like whatever had been keeping him off-kilter the past few days had gathered itself and coalesced, and he could finally think through things beyond just keeping Steve happy, healthy and safe. He hadn’t been that bad since they first Bonded, he thought with a slight frown, a time which Clint liked to remind him of at every turn just because he’d apparently nixed sex on Fury’s conference table because of an unfortunate lack of pillows. Honestly, Tony didn’t see why Clint couldn’t just let that one go. Still, it was good to have his head clear again, so he could focus on what needed to be done.
“Oh-ho, like I am going to tell you?  Nice try, Small Hands.  Subtle.  Steve, do you hear this?  Shocking behavior, is it not?” Tony asked, grinning as he sat down at the head of the table.  Steve took his place in the seat at Tony’s right. “I’m shocked.  Steve’s shocked. Look at him.  Shocked.”
of things, Tony thought dreamily as he stared at the back of the bedroom door where someone had hung a dart board and one of those inspirational posters where the eagle told you how to be a good person.
“Twenty years and counting, so crawl back to your moms’ basements, you asshats,” the one who must be Lenny replied.  “Can we get some smiles?  Everyone likes a Cinderella story.”
Another spurt of slick leaked out, and Tony caught it before it could hit the bed, coating his cock, then spreading the rest on his pointer fingers and around the puffy edge of Steve’s hole. He pushed a finger from each hand inside and hooked them, gently pulling at the sides of Steve’s entrance, stretching it. Even through the metal, he could feel the initial resistance of the muscle as he tugged, then a warm rush of wetness ran past his fingers and Steve’s hole slackened. Tony withdrew his fingers and lined up the head of his cock, letting the bulbous end catch on Steve’s rim as he shifted into position. Steve moaned, low and throaty, each time the head of Tony’s cock skimmed over the rim of his hole, which contacted with each pass, like it was trying to catch onto Tony’s cock. Tony gripped the backs of Steve’s thighs, taking a moment to enjoy the flash of red metal on pale skin, then thrust his cock all the way in, burying himself fully inside Steve’s warm, wet heat.
Steve shook his head and started to respond, but was cut off by a knock on the door.  Cam hurried to open it. Servants and slaves filed in with trunks and satchels belonging to the King and Steve. Cam took over directing them where to put everything, while Steve took a chair by the fire.   Once they were done, Cam made himself a plate of food, told Steve he would be back to help him dress shortly, and headed down the hallway to one of the small servants’ chambers.
Steve shot him an annoyed look, but clamped his jaw shut and didn’t say anything else as he followed closely behind Tony. They made the cargo elevator without encountering anyone else. “I think we’re clear,” Tony said just as the alarm claxons began sounding.
“Can’t you keep your fucking mouth—“ Steve heard Bucky shout as he closed the door, though he didn’t stick around long enough to correct his friend. Clint was far more right about things than he wanted to admit.
“Of course,” Tony replied, pulling back to look at Steve.  His gaze softened.  “Of course, I would.  You’ve not told me how you came to be here.  Conscripted from Andoria, I would guess, from the look of you. The Juntas are always pillaging for soldiers on those shores.  God knows, they go through their own fast enough to need the conscripts. Or Cymeza, perhaps?” Tony asked with a slight frown.  “The Ettans get half their slaves from there, though I don’t see how you’d have learned what you leaned on a Cymezian battlefield.  I hear they make mortars of hardened sheep manure they light on fire.  God, I bet that reeks.  Hell of a deterrent effect, I suppose.  Anyway, if any of them are even half the man you are, then I should think we would be better served with them here than under the sun in the fields or in the dark of the mines or one of those God-forsaken fighting pits Stern runs.  I thank whatever God there is that you were able to avoid such fates, but this would prey on your mind, I think, that you were able to come here and your friends were not, however misplaced such reproach may be.”
I said on tumblr that this smut thing needed 100K of backstory and then 100K of fix-it.  Basically, Steve rescued Tony from Schmidt when they were boys.  Tony and Steve have pretty much loved each other their whole lives.  Tony is marrying because of politics and Steve is dealing with that about as well as one would expect.  Since there are no planes to jump out of, he marries Pierce.  Tony is having NONE OF THAT, THANKS.
Tony looked over at Dum-E, still faithfully attempting to, well, pat the Audi, like the ‘bot had found a shiny, new friend.  His mind flashed back to the first few weeks in the cabin, alone and free, ordering all his little shoeboxes and building his viewers, trying to look through the tiny hole he made for himself to see the world.
“That’s what I’ve been telling Ross, but the beacons haven’t been lit in, God, what?  Has to be over a thousand years,” Rhodey reminded him.
That… wasn’t right. There must have been something else.  Many something elses.  He must have felt like… have felt… cherished.  Safe.  He must have felt good about himself.  Like he was valued.  Like he mattered.
“Eh, don’t worry about it.  I’ll handle it. You did fine. Better than fine,” Tony assured him.  “Pepper worries that I’ll say something that doesn’t fit the script, and, let’s face it, that’s not exactly outside of the realm of possibility.  Matt thinks I’m going to say something that’s going to sound bad when they repeat it back in court one day.  I get it.  They’re trying to protect me.  Protect what we’re trying to do here.  But, you want to say something?  I trust you.  Have at it.  You clearly have better instincts for it than I do,” Tony admitted with an indifferent shrug.  “The only reason I haven’t announced to the world what Obie’s up to is that I promised Pepper I wouldn’t put her through a protracted he said-he said, not when we can get him red-handed, anyway.”
“No,” Steve amended, his mouth flattening around the word.  The King’s eyes lit up and he threw back his head and laughed, slapping a hand on his thigh.
“I love you,” Tony whispered urgently. “Love you so much, Steve,” he said, letting his hands fall to Steve’s neck to tug their foreheads together.
“Yea—ah, fuck! Jesus, yes, please, Steve, more, please,” Tony pleaded between gasps of air as Steve continued to pump his fingers in and out, the leather of the gloves where they peeled up at the knuckle of his finger sometimes catching on Tony’s rim as Steve pushed in. Tony’s addled brain couldn’t seem to decide if it was pain or pleasure and so just sort of fell into feeling everything at once.   He couldn’t stay still.  Kept squirming and arching, canting his hips up and rolling his head back and forth, like some wanton, needy thing, his whole body quivering and covered in gooseflesh. There was something terrible and wonderful about Steve doing this to him, using the gloves like that, not even bothering to take them off.  It felt filthy.  Wrong.  Obscene.  He loved it, and felt hot shame burn through him at the realization, but that somehow made it better, which made no sense, but he just squelched his eyes shut and let his body take over.  “Need you.  Please, Steve.  Need you.”
“Speaking as someone who knows a bit about locked workshops and things we don’t talk about with others,” Tony began, clearing his throat and glancing down at the parking lot where the car stood out like a blinking, neon Steal Me Please sign.  “Help isn’t judgment, Steve.  I’m not offering because you’re doing a terrible job here or something.  I’m offering because I can.  Because I want to.  Because I like doing something that means something.  Maybe you know a little about that?  Maybe that kind of resonates, just, I don’t know, a tad?  See, the guy who listened to my crazy spiel in the back of a limo after we busted out of a police station, and said, ‘Sure, I’m in’?  That guy could’ve told me it was my problem, get stuffed, you know? But, you didn’t.  You didn’t, and by all rights, you should have, because God knows---God knows, I did more to get myself into this mess than you did to get into yours, so—so I’m saying, I’m not judging, okay? Judgment-free zone.  Got it?”
But...it was something. Something real. To help.  Steve did a lot of things that were supposed to help these days, but helping the way SHIELD did it seemed like some kind of vague, nebulous concept that might come to fruition at some distant point in the future.  This was, at least, something real.
“Careful. You’ll tear that open again,” Natasha warned, giving a quick glance over her shoulder to the open ramp.  Tony swiveled his head in the same direction, wincing as the sudden movement sent a stitch of pain through the side of his chest.
“Tony’s mine,” Steve snapped sharply, pushing off the wall he’d been leaning on.  Tony’s gut clenched, then released, mouth parting in a silent oh of relief. He closed his eyes, just for a moment, and repeated Steve’s words in his head.  Tony’s mine.
Then, he would build Steve something, and maybe that would be the thing that tipped the scale.  You never knew. It could happen.  He could be one uniform upgrade away from getting what he wanted.  Best not to take the chance on missing out, so it clearly made sense to spend the next week or so holed up in his lab.  Yep.  Another brilliant plan from the resident genius.  It was all working out so well, he thought, as his face twisted into a grimace.  He raked his hand through his hair again, then patted it down, because…fuck, where were they anyway, he wondered, peering around Natasha at the ramp again.
He'd already gotten there already. Really, as soon as Steve said the account was his mom's. Brilliant, really, but Howard had always been that. He had to give Howard credit. A good burning in effigy, obviously, but credit where credit is due. Back then, before the big automated clearing houses made everything electronic, in the days before the massive bank consolidations, a closed account at a small, regional bank would show the wire in, temporarily forcing the account to reopen, until the nightly processing spit out an error report the next day. Then, the wire gets a big, old return to sender. Howard gets his five million back without a so much as a fuss, and Steve, meanwhile, guiltily admits to taking the money Howard so kindly offered to loan him. Because he felt badly about going behind Tony's back to get it.
“I told you that nearly a week ago, Stark. Not so sure I need you for this project now,” Fury said, flaring out his long, black coat as he sat down. Dramatically, of course.  Tony was surprised the guy didn’t just throw out the jazz hands sometimes.
Desolation and dread opened a pit in Steve’s stomach, churning slowly and sickeningly toward certainty.  Tony knew Steve had asked Cam about it.
. From night before last, when Tony had let Rhodey take him out and get him drunk. Or possibly the other way around. At any rate, they’d ended up at some strip club just off the main drag, Rhodey insisting he was bored while drinking Tony under the table, and Tony throwing money at whoever happened to walk past. Honestly, strippers were only really interesting because they made Rhodey uncomfortable. Otherwise, it was all just sort of sad and the secondhand embarrassment was usually not worth what little thrill they offered. He thought he might have nodded off, until Rhodey’s elbow in his rib cage got his attention and pointed to the stage.
He turned the shower off and wrapped the towel around his waist.  When he entered the bedroom, he could see Tony sitting on the sofa in the sunken living area, a light bluish glow illuminating his face in the dim light of the room indicating that he had his tablet in his lap.  It was only mid-afternoon, but the massive glass walls that dominated the far corner of the room had been darkened and the lights turned low.  As he walked around to the front of the sofa to stand in front of Tony, Steve could see that Tony was talking to someone via a small, wireless headset that reminded Steve of something out of Star Trek.
“Tell His Highness that I am fine.  I have been sketching and reading, and now, I will eat and drink, and he need not worry,” Steve said with an exasperated sigh.  He glanced sideways at Cam, who was giving him a considering, narrow-eyed look.
Brock made a noncommittal sound.  “You think they’re really gonna care much?  Not like they’ve been by for a while or tried to get together,” he continued, taking a sip of his beer.  “Thought you guys had kinda, I don't know, rifted apart or whatever.  I mean, I get it, they’ve both got these great lives going and all.  Probably not much time for just hanging.  Not everyone’s as close as me and the guys, you know, and that’s cool.  People move on.”
“Noble,” Zola said, brushing his hand across the front of his robe, as if removing imagined dirt.  “Stupidly futile, of course.  The boy will be put to use, whether it is tonight or some other time.  But, I’m afraid, even were I inclined to consider your offer, you are not Lord Stane’s preferred choice of companionship, shall we say?  Now, time to go.  I suggest you remember your manners tonight.  Lord Hammer is known to have something of a temper when he is displeased.”
His plans for the rest of the evening had been totally shot by his detour to Marketing.  Fury was probably going to give him a hard time for missing the intelligence briefing, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.  Pulling out his sketchbook and pencils, Steve began sketching, hesitantly at first, then with firmer and more confident strokes. This time, this one time, he was going to get it right.  Capture whatever that was that made Tony into the person Steve saw.  Maybe it was the knowledge that if he didn’t do it right, someone else would get the job, Steve had never shied from competition, or maybe it was just the desire to show Deirdre and everyone else what they had been missing, too distracted by shiny armor, that it was Tony himself that was the superhero.  No armor had made the call to haul a nuke into space on one Hulk fly-ball save from a one-way trip.  Just a man.  An amazing, incredible, obnoxious, brilliant, annoying, funny and never dull man, but just a man nonetheless.
Tony glanced up.  “Fantastic,” he said, going back to his phone. It was like these people learned general relativity from the back of a cereal—oh, hello, Tony mentally stuttered, thoughts grinding to a halt as his mind processed the image he’d seen.
These are a collection of ficlets and some just responses to asks over on Tumblr that I wanted to save, given that Tumblr is deleting so many blogs and posts.  I have no idea what tomorrow's purge will bring and didn't want to lose these. Nothing is beta-ed and everything is very informal, just some CN-related stuff that I wanted to keep somewhere.
“I have no doubt that you can do pretty much anything you put your mind to,” Steve agreed.  He was tapping at his bottom lip with the pad of his thumb, and Tony found his eyes drawn to the movement.  Tap-tap-tap.  Finger against lip.  Tony wondered what it would be like to feel Steve’s thumb slide along his lip, push inside, Tony’s mouth closing around it, sucking gently while Steve watched him.  There was an answering pull in his belly at the thought, deep and low, sending a warm pressure arching down between his legs to the tip of his cock.
. And it was wonderful, wasn’t it?  Being the type of person Tony would tease.  Steve liked being that kind of person.
“If you would be agreeable to a second?” Tony asked Steve, who nodded, then looked over at Rhodes.  “You’re up, Sourpatch.”
“There you are,” Steve said.  His voice was shaking. “I thought you’d left.” Anto held up his bag.  “That’s your stuff?” Steve asked. Anto nodded.
“You know, when I told you two to get a room, this wasn’t quite what I had in mind,” Natasha observed mildly from the doorway.  Bruce brushed past her, medical bag in hand, and knelt down next to the cot.  He peeled back on the corner of the makeshift bandage and then nodded perfunctorily.
“That’s not—that’s a wildly inaccurate description of, well, everything,” Tony objected loudly.  “I just thought Steve—when he’s Steve again—would feel more comfortable if, you know, it was one of you.  Or Bruce.  He’s a doctor.  I could call Pepper.  She is also an assassin,” Tony said, making a face at Natasha, who raised her eyebrow and narrowed her eyes in answer.
“I care for you, Tony,” Steve said carefully. It didn’t feel like a lie. He wondered if he would recognize one now.  “I like you.  More than I ever imagined that I would, but you want me to look past everything else and see only this,” Steve said, holding up the diamond pendant that dangled from his neck.  “You. Not this—these things,” he continued, pulling a face of disgust.  “But, this, with you, it is not forever.  This was only meant to be for a night, and I know you care, I do, but one day, it will end, and what then? I will be sent to someone else, someone who—who will not be as you are.  Or worse.  I can’t do that.  I won’t.  And what of Cam, then, what about--”
No.  He shook his head and put the bar back on the small, plastic soap shelf that was suction-cupped to the shower wall.  He was thinking about filtration systems.  Not the way Steve’s skin would feel with beads of water dotting the ridges of muscle.
He actually had little to no idea what was going on with the company, since he couldn’t inherit and absolutely no one in R&D would do more than pat him on his head and suggest he do something that kept his hands soft and nails unbroken.  He’d told them he’d just play with the weapons they were producing because he was pretty sure he’d be safe, which had gotten his hide tanned pretty good, true, but had been worth it for the looks on their faces, because the useless fuckers knew it was true.
The walked on for a while.  Tony picked up the occasional plant leaf or berry to sniff and taste and add to his medicine bag or not.  It wasn’t much further before Steve called a halt. He set up a small lean-to to block the wind and laid out a bed of furs from his pack.  They ate the salted meat that Steve had been able to grab on their hasty departure from the cave that morning and drank from his water bag.  They would need to refill it soon, but Steve assured him there was fresh water nearby. He had come this way, he said, and remembered it well.   At Tony’s continued questioning, he drew a crude sketch in the dirt of where they were and where the Great Mother River was, with his camp way down at the bottom.  Tony studied it a long time. He had never seen anything like it, lines in the sand to represent a river, pointed peaks to represent mountains, tall, thin hashmarks for the forest.  He thought it oddly beautiful, but could also see the utility in it.
“What?” Tony said, blinking at Steve in confusion.  “No…no, ah.  The Rolling Stones or The Beatles. They’re…they’re bands.  From the 60’s?  I Can’t Get No Satisfaction?  Sympathy for the Devil?  Hey Jude, Yesterday?  I mean, I’m a Stones man myself, but can’t exactly say there’s a wrong answer there.  Any…ah, any of that ring a bell?”
The rest of the blows rained down in quick succession.  Before he could quite get his mind around the feeling of one, the next landed.  He could hear his voice slur over nineteen and twenty, each one landing a hard, vertical strip down the opposite cheek.  There was a buzz in the back of his mind that filled his ears and seemed to drown out everything else until the sound of the strap cutting through the air, the whip crack of it against his skin, his numbers, all dulled to the background.  He hovered.  He counted.  He thought of nothing but the numbers.  There was no choice there, just the next number.  It was easy.  Why had it been hard?  He couldn’t remember, but the desire to waned quickly.
Tony tore off the top of a yogurt cup that held a depressingly small amount of granola and dumped it in a pile on top of the deck railing.
“Updated?  You’ll keep me updated?  What the fuck does that--wait—no, what’s going on?  Is he okay? Coulson?  You can’t just—“ Tony objected, feeling his heart drop to his stomach and bounce back up like it was on the end of a yo-yo.  The world in front of him shifted to one side and went fuzzy at the edges.  He reached out and stumbled forward to brace a hand on the door, nearly tripping over the steps.
Steve started to draw back, then felt Tony’s hand slide up through his hair to hold his head, a gentle pressure holding him in place, while Tony’s other hand came up splay against Steve’s cheek, and then Tony was kissing him, full and open and hot, and Steve had enough time to think that it felt a bit like falling, though the kind of fall where you would never land.  Where you flew.
“Of course no one is having sex on the conference table. Don’t be ridiculous. There’s not even a single pillow,” Tony observed in disgust, wondering why everyone was staring at him like that, when it was patently obvious the conference room had no pillows.
“You really think that?  Really?  That’s what you think of me?  God.  That’s what you think of me,” Tony said, his voice careful and slow, but there was pain lingering in each word.  Sorrow, too, and a rebuke, though not one aimed at Steve, because, of course, Tony would blame himself, if he could.
Which was why, by the end of the next day, when Steve still had not shown up bearing a carefully ordered list of bullet-pointed questions or holding some piece of equipment that had lost a bout with super-soldier strength, Tony was…concerned.  Yes, concerned was really the best word for it.  Steve might not be comfortable enough to ask questions yet or worry that Tony would be upset because the telemetry receiver looked like a taco now or the training bot was in pieces.  So, really, it was just concern about how Steve was settling back in that led Tony to leave his caffeine and take-out and head up to the common room the next evening.
Steve’s uniform, or the parts of it that were left clinging to his body, was familiar enough.  Tony had seen it on Jarvis’s coffee cup this morning.  Tony looked down at his hand holding onto Steve’s shoulder, digging into the blue material, just above the silvery-white epaulet.  He looked down at the bottom of the uniform, half covered by a sterile blue cloth.  Red and white-striped panels.  And darker red, now, discoloring the white.  There was a piece of the cloth that had been cut away on the floor by the operating table.  What had once been a white star peeked out from the crumple of fabric.  It was reddened now, but it would have been a blazing white, Tony knew.  A blue cowl with small wings on each side and a large, white A in the center sat on a tray next to two red leather gloves and a belt fixed with pouches.
Tony hated magic. He really, really did.  So, it was with no small amount of surprised disgust to find himself standing around under the buzzing fluorescents of a hospital hallway, armored boots clicking loudly against the linoleum floor as he tried to stop himself from pacing, and discover that his first reaction to the news of Steve’s condition was one of a grasping, clawing kind of relief.  Though, guilt at the complete selfishness of that thought followed quickly on its heels, like the world’s worst consolation prize.  How could he think that, even for a moment?  This was Cap…Steve…and it was hard to think of someone who deserved this less than Steve.  Hell, Tony might have been willing to volunteer for Loki’s little treatment, if given a choice.  Last couple of years had not exactly been his best, all things considered.  Panic attacks.  Malibu.  Killian.  The break-up with Pepper.  And then…well, and then everything else that he was definitely not going to factor into his reaction to any of this.
“Just…”  Tony looked at him over his shoulder, mouth a hard, thin line, whole body rigid with tension. “Just get in the bed, Steve. That’s what you’re here for, right?” Tony said bitterly as his hands moved to unbutton his pants in quick, harsh motions.  But before he could look away, Steve caught something pleading in his eyes, something desperate and wanting.  Steve felt a white, hot stab of shame at Tony’s words.  However true they were, it hurt like hell to hear them fall from Tony’s lips like invective.  He blinked and looked down at the floor, struggling with what to say or do in the face of Tony’s apparent derision.
“I’d love to see them sometime. You should come by the Tower.  With the…art stuff.  One day,” Stark suggested.  “You show me yours, I’ll show you mine kind of thing.  But with art.”
Tony turned around and leaned back against the deck rail, planting his elbows on the flat top of the railing and twirling the spoon around in his yogurt cup.  He squinted at Steve, scrunched up his face, looked away and wondered.
Stomach rumbling, Steve shrugged off his outer robe and discarded the veil, then walked over to the oaken table and started piling food from the tray onto a plate.  The fertile lands of the Greenway meant all manner of fruits, vegetables, breads and meats, and its kitchens seemed determined to win some kind of unspoken competition with those back at the Castle.  Every dish was extraordinary. According to Tony, last night’s dinner at the High Table had featured a roast boar stuffed with sweet meats and root vegetables and a fluffy pastry cooked into the shape of a swan.
Tony snorted out a huff of a laugh.  “You should be in Gucci or Prada or nothing at all,” Tony declared, then went still, catching himself.  “Sorry,” he said quickly, mouth twisting into an apologetic grimace.  “That was--I didn’t mean---I don’t know what I meant.  You know what? Ignore me.”
It was just…it felt different.  Probably shouldn’t, Tony could acknowledge, but it did.  He had done his own tour of duty, so to speak, in Afghanistan not too long ago, after all, as the souvenir in his chest could attest.  It didn’t change that he needed the guy to cooperate for a few days before this whole thing blew up in his face.  It didn’t change anything, really.
“You did good,” the King said into the top of Steve’s head.  He felt a light brush of lips in his hair.  “You were so good for me.  Beautiful.” The King’s voice shook, barely, though Steve could feel it against his skin, warming him somehow.  A few more soft strokes and murmured words, and then the King tugged the blanket spattered with Steve’s cum aside and tossed it to the ground.
Nat’s smile softened, mouth quirking up as she regarded Tony.  “Treat this one right, and I’ll braid your hair.”
“I think so.  President Carter led us well through the war, and she...yes.  Yes, I think we got the best person that way,” Steve said.
Steve wasn’t sure what to make of the interest, but he understood performance.  He knew that people needed their stories almost as much as they needed food on the table and a roof over their heads. He understood what a symbol could mean to people.  He suspected that Tony did, too.  Not for the first time, Steve thought about how much Tony wanted Steve to like this place. To see the beauty in the land and its people, after all the ugliness.  The idea that Tony wanted his people to like Steve, to see him as something other than a mere concubine, that was new. Though it went a long way to explain the luxury of the carriage and the opulent robes Steve wore, Steve realized. Tony was showing his people Steve’s value, in perhaps the only way he could.
Behind him, Steve heard the conference room door open.  He turned, slowly, and found himself face to face with Anthony.  The real Anthony.
Steve didn’t slow down, just stalked towards the car with Tony in his arms.  He opened the passenger door and carefully set Tony down inside, leaning the seat back a bit and buckling Tony in.  Tony’s head lolled to the side and he looked up at Steve, then quickly let his gaze fall back down to his lap.  Steve looked pissed.  He had that sharp, tight-jawed look he got when he was truly angry about something.  A well of hot shame emptied into Tony’s chest and stomach.  He had screwed up.  He had screwed up, and Steve knew about it. Steve had seen.  Really
He could handle it a lot better now, and certainly, he could handle one night.  He’d spent years getting shot at, sleeping on the ground, and living off MREs. He figured he could somehow manage to get through one night of sex with Tony Stark, he thought, mouth twisting.  And it would solve
thing that got him through the day and maybe staved off whatever madness awaited, was this...friendship, or whatever it was, with the creature.  Steve looked around, searching for where the creature had gone.
He had known it when he was boy, paging through the faded issues of propaganda comics. He had known it when he papered his walls with images of Captain America and called it a sanctuary. He had known it when he watched those old movie reels and let them comfort him, soothe his pain and make him feel worthy, even if just for a little while.
“Hey, uh,” Steve started.  “I don’t really know who to ask, but…was I or, I mean, am I…seeing anyone?  If anyone knows, that is?” Tony’s hand holding his cards twitched involuntarily, nearly knocking Clint’s beer bottle over before the archer caught it, giving Tony a long, narrow-eyed look.
“I hope so,” Steve replied.  He sucked in a bracing breath and forced a smile onto his face.  He reached into his back pocket and dug out his wallet, flipping it open and staring inside.  “I’ve got...five dollars that says this concierge hangs up on me.”
“The article on the wall said it was the first one of its kind that they were testing,” Rhodey pointed out.
As much as he didn’t know what to say to Tony in his letters, he wanted to say something, craved at least that small connection. And he knew the special kind of pain that came from waiting, being left behind, having spent too much of his life confined by the failings of his body. He hated to think of Tony feeling that way, but could no more have let Tony anywhere near these people again than will the mountains to spew forth their quarry. Just the thought of it made his chest tighten and hands ball into fists to keep from shaking.
“Learned to sleep through pretty much anything in the Army,” Steve said, giving him a considering look.  “You’re really going to do this, aren’t you?”
It didn’t even seem all that odd now that he managed such a friendship with a man whose face he never saw and whose name he never knew.  When he told Lizzie, Willie and Ian about it when they were little, they seemed to think it was absolutely fantastic to have a mysterious friend like that, and he somewhat shyly admitted that he rather thought it was amazing, too, that someone like that would want to be friends with someone like him.   Many nobles helped the War clandestinely, though none quite so directly, at least to Steve’s knowledge, and he figured Iron Man had to have been someone important, given his education and fortune.  There would probably be a heavy price to pay for someone in that position, if their aid to the War was found out by the wrong people, at least, that was what Peggy said, and it made sense.   He would have thought that the man’s identity would have been fairly easy to discern, but no whisper of it ever reached his ear, and Iron Man asked him not to try to find out, so he hadn’t. He would never have put Iron Man in danger like that anyway, as much as he would have liked to know who his friend really was.
“There you are,” a voice called out from behind as one of the doors slammed open. “Fuck, this place is a God-damned maze. How the hell did you--”
He wrapped his arms around Steve, kissing him again, lighter this time, and somehow scooted up the bed towards the headboard, pulling Steve with him in a tangle of limbs.  Tony rolled out from under him, and Steve followed the momentum until it was Tony laying atop him instead.
“They’re giving us the Presidential Suite tonight,” Tony reminded him.  Steve nodded and swallowed thickly.
“Strippers. Elvis.  Quickie marriages.  We’ve hit the Vegas trifecta, Pep.  I love this town.  Please let it be Love Me Tender?” Tony asked, eyebrows raised in question.
“I saw that.  You know, Vestigus wrote the seminal treatise on warfare after years of study—“ Tony started, interrupted by Steve’s snort of laughter.  “
At Steve’s urging, Cam bought a steady stream of foods from carts and vendors, then promptly gifted them back to the adoring crowd.  Full bellies, an afternoon’s entertainment and a few coins to rub together, and most of the people would go home basking in delight, never quite questioning what they saw, at least, not enough to scratch away the surface.  They do not want to see, Steve thought, and it is so very easy not to look when you are shown the exception.
There was a battle raging in his mind between what he seemed believable and what he wanted to believe. Captain America—Steve—couldn’t love someone like Tony.  Not really.  He had misheard.  Misinterpreted.  Missed
“Nonsense, they loved me,” Steve deadpanned.  “Well.  One of them did sort of throw a mortar at me.”
“Yes,” Tony said around a yawn.  “Family.  There’s work to do in the West.  We smashed one head during the War, but there is always another.”
“You were right about me,” Tony cut in.  He didn’t want to go any further down that path, not when there were things he still needed to tell Steve about the extent of his mistakes.  Not when he was using Steve’s trust for clean-up in Aisle Pseudo-Daddy Figure, he thought with a wince. “The whole persona thing.  Tony Stark, name in lights, the bigger, the better, right? The show’s part of my life.  Not going to lie,” Tony said, feeling his voice drop, like the guilt was weighing down the words.  He could feel his hands clench into fists and forced himself to relax. “It’s a lot for anyone to handle, and you’ve probably got more on your plate than anyone should.  It can…consume you.  If you let it.  Glitz and glamour with a side of rehab, just like Mom did it.  But, it’s not who I am.  It’s not who I want to be.  I’m…” he broke off, clearing his throat.  “I’m saying, I’d make a space for you.  If you wanted it. Maybe—probably--I wouldn’t have, back in Bagram, if you’d said yes then.  We’d have had a great night,” Tony acknowledged.
“Gotta keep him looking good, am I right, Tony? Need to stay after him.  Don’t let him go to pot just ‘cuz he has you now,” Happy advised.  “My second cousin’s an Alpha.  Got Bonded, and boom!  Spare tire like you wouldn’t believe,” Happy announced with a derisive snort.  “’Course, he says, why bother, now that he’s Bonded, but I’m like, Frank, you’re gonna grow into that recliner, man.  Gina, she’s his Omega, she’s not gonna be happy with you, letting yourself go like that.”
“I—yes.  I did, I mean.  She’s doing—“ good, Steve meant to say, but couldn’t get the word to come out.  “Actually, the visit didn’t exactly go as I’d hoped.  We haven’t really been able to connect like I wanted when I came out here.”
“Do you?” Tony asked, though Steve knew he didn’t actually expect an answer. He also knew that Tony had been up in his workshop all night and his breath smelled like mint over Scotch, but Steve didn’t point that out, and Tony didn’t wait for an answer. They had known each other long enough at this point to know the drill.
“Howard!  Just what the bloody hell are you doing?” Peggy voice cracked across the room, trembling with barely-contained anger.  “Did you hit him?  Howard!  Answer me!  Tony,” she began, voice softening considerably.  “Did he hit you?”
All of their heads were missing, except one, who had only half a face and looked to Steve like it might have been an armored knight at one time, though its sword was gone and a booted foot crushed into pebbles.   The other statues, he noticed belatedly, also looked as if they had once held various items.  A hammer, he thought, looking at one that only had its lower half left, but appeared to be holding the remnants of a large warhammer.  Another had only the statue’s palms out, the fingers broken off, as if the hands once held something round. They were so lifelike, even with the missing pieces.  He had never seen anything quite like them before. Certainly not the effigies of the saints sitting in their vestibules at the church in Gulleytown, staring piously up towards heaven with mournful expressions on their faces. Steve stared at the statues, enthralled for a moment.
As promised, breakfast arrived not too long after Ms. Potts left.  Steve picked at the bounty without really tasting it.  He finished quickly and showered, using a walk-in shower that was bigger than his first apartment in Brooklyn.  It had all kinds of nozzles that sprayed his whole body and felt ridiculously indulgent, though he didn’t let himself spend too much time trying them out.  He wanted to get out of here, though he couldn’t say for sure why it was suddenly so imperative that he leave.  He dried off in a hurry and changed into the clothes Ms. Potts had provided.
He was trying not to panic, but could feel his heart stuttering in his chest. A year of planning, and it was all going to come tumbling down because he hadn’t been able to shut up about how hot the guy was and Rhodey had, for once, listened to him, the idiot. There had to be some way to keep the guy from talking. Matt had to know some legal crap that would keep the guy from talking---wait.
“I’m not judging you, Steve. Raza got what was coming to him, gods know. But, you gotta leave that here. I know how it feels. It feels good, letting that out. You carry it with you, and it eats at you from the inside, gets on everything you touch, and you just need to get it out of you, and this—this kind of thing lets you do that, and no one is going to gainsay it. Hell, they’ll applaud you while it destroys you, clap you right into nothing,” Bucky said flatly. “You stay here, you keep at this until there’s none of them left, there’s going to be none of you left either. There was a time when I wanted that, wanted there to be nothing left of me, because there was nothing left of them, Peggy and George. But, Steve, he’s waiting for you. You have someone to go to, someone who makes you happier than I’ve seen you since…gods, since I don’t know when! A home. A family. All those things you used to want, remember? What the hell are we still doing here?” Bucky demanded, a rough fissure of unease running through his voice, letting the question hang in the air.
“Enough, Buck.  Come on,” Steve interjected quickly.  “It’s fine.  It’s nothing.  Don’t worry about it.”
And now, here he was, waiting for Steve to get home—back, watching the road from his very own widow’s walk, and he understood why, it made sense.  This life, this thing he’d had a glimpse of, it was far too precious to imagine letting go of it now, and if something happened to Steve, then it all disappeared.
Two prompts in one!  This is for a request for an injured Steve who was hiding his injury and another request for the boys stuck in Ye Olde Convenient Cabin.  I apparently don't understand the meaning of the word "drabble."
.  Really.  I-I told you.  You don’t need to worry or what’s British for worry? Fret?  Do I need to put an extra letter in there for absolutely no reason? No fretting, J,” Tony implored weakly.  “Really.  I’m fine.  Honestly.  Stop looking at me like that,” Tony protested, striding over to his workstation.
“Wait. Condo.  You—did you buy our apartment?” Steve asked, drawing back in his chair to look at Tony with an air of disbelieving fondess.
“Will you ever leave the part about Bucky out of that story?  He feels terrible, you know,” Steve tried, as Tony stood up.
“So, was it as good for you as it was for me, is that what you’re trying to say, or--wow, okay, wow.  Gift that keeps on giving, huh?” Tony’s mind blanked as he felt the alien’s finger stroke over the crease in his ass, just behind his hole, pressing lightly. A whir of sensation raced through him.  Heat thrummed low in his belly, then surged down the length of his cock, pooling at the head. The alien’s face was tight with apparent concentration, though his mouth was open in a soft, wondrous look, his focus on Tony’s face as he rubbed at the delicate skin there.
Steve turned, slowly, letting Tony’s hands guide him around.  Blindman’s Bluff, he thought nonsensically, recalling the childhood game, Bucky’s hands spinning him through the darkness and pointing him the way he was supposed to go.
“I’ll take care of him,” Coulson promised, watching as Steve walked away.  He turned to Tony with an appraising look.  “Ready?”
“He brought me here, you know,” Tony said, staring at the heavy canopy that covered the bed.  “After my parents were killed.”  He paused, blinking up at the dark blue fabric that made him think of a river as it folded into the curtains around the bed.  A river that flowed away.  He shivered, though the room was warm, thanks to the fire in the hearth. He had thought that once, he remembered, or thought he remembered. “I thought he was going to comfort me,” Tony huffed out, mouth filling with the tang of long-held bitterness.  “I was so stupid.” He swiped an angry hand across his eyes and blinked, twisting his head away to look at Steve, who peered at him over his sword, a deep furrow marring his brow.
“There’s always a trail.  You’ll find it,” Steve said with all the confidence in the world, the way probably only Steve could.
to spend time with Steve, and that was...exciting. New.  Good.  Steve would make sure it was good, anyway.  They could have a picnic or something. That was...Omegas liked picnics still, right?  He would like to take Tony on a picnic. With one of those wicker baskets and checked blankets like they always seemed to have on hand in the movies.
“Of course! That is only natural,” Cam agreed, nodding and nudging the water bag at Steve again, this time with more insistence. Steve took it and swallowed down a long drink, then handed it back to the boy. “Sometimes, I think of the people I knew before I came to serve the King, but they have their own lives, and now, I have mine, so I do not think I should dwell too much on them.”
“Your fellow soldiers. From when you were captured.  I could have them located.  I’m not saying it would be easy, but…it is possible.  They could be brought here, even, if it would please you.  Places could be made for them to serve, and your mind would be at ease, then, I think,” Tony said.  “You will write down their names and descriptions and the details of your capture.  If they can be found, we will find them, and I’ll arrange for their purchase,” Tony told him with a firm nod, as if the matter was settled.  Steve stared at him, all the words taken from his mind as if his head had been tipped over and the words spilled out into a useless jumble.
“Thanks,” Steve said dryly.  Making it to Tony’s car was not quite the medieval gauntlet of the prior night, though Steve did notice a couple of brightly dressed “tourists” surreptitiously snapping photos as they made their way through the hotel lobby and out to where Happy had the car humming.
“Right. Right, exactly. That's what--look, Steve,” Tony began. “Sit. Stay awhile. I'm—I'm asking. Let's...We can talk, right? Like actual adults? It was nice. Yesterday, I mean. I—I thought so, anyway,” Tony said, trying not to wince at how pathetic that sounded.
“What else have you heard of the King?” Steve pressed, trying to turn his mind from the matter of Tony and Stane.
It wasn’t his concern. Some strange Omega he’d seen a picture of in a stack of files…the boy’s fate wasn’t in Steve’s hands.  It belonged to his parents, who would surely find a suitable match for him.  Someone who would take care of him, the way he should be cared for, not someone who could barely manage to get through a day without retreating to some half-baked fantasy life.  It wasn’t his concern.  It
He watched Tony pull his tie off, the silk zipping through his nimble fingers, and felt his throat go dry. Heat stirred deep within him as forbidden images filled his mind. His eyes blindfolded with the tie, seeing only the deep, dark edges of red.  His hands tied to the bed above his head, feeling the silk against his wrists.
Warmth bloomed in Steve’s chest.  Happiness. Joy. Laughter. He could remember how it sounded, but he was sure he’d never heard Tony laugh like that, except he had.  He’d heard it over and over. Memories flooded his mind all at once, like a deck of cards that had been dropped to scatter across the floor.  He could see them all, just couldn’t make any order of it.
“Alright,” Tony conceded, nervousness coursing through his veins at the thought.  They walked in silence back up the path, an anticipatory, breathless silence that waited for a sound it knew was coming.  Tony kept his hand in Steve’s, while Steve carried the basket looped around his other arm.
Steve took a deep breath.  “I just…please, Happy.  I just need to tell him…just, please.  I won’t…if he tells me to leave, then that’s it.  I won’t bother him, I swear.”
“Should I go?” Steve asked.  At least this time, the words managed to sound like words, and his hazy mind was slowly coalescing.
Steve stared at it for a beat, then headed back for the cabin, his mind swirling.  His lunch waited on the kitchen counter.  He sat down at the small table and opened the styrofoam container, eating without really tasting the food.  He kept looking over his shoulder, through the screen door where he could see one side of the garage.  Tony didn’t appear. Of course, he didn’t appear.  Steve didn’t really expect him to, but it was a nice thought, and one that kept him occupied while he ate.  Tony, leaving his garage with his container of food in hand, coming to join Steve for lunch, unreasonably happy with Steve’s choices of...soap.   Yeah. That would probably not be happening.
“Sorry, that’s—Daddy issues are date number two, right?  I always forget,” Stark said with a quick laugh, picking up a French fry and shoveling it through some ketchup.  “So, yeah, anyway, Iron Man and Cap, they’re definitely trading BFF necklaces.  You going to eat your had-a-chance-at-life-fish or what?”
He had an answer now, though, Steve thought with a frown as he headed towards the glass doors.  They were on a romantic getaway to Vegas, so that was something happy, right? Brock was making time for them as a couple, which was something Steve asked him to do, so there was that.  Well, obviously there wasn’t that right this minute, because Steve was lost and Brock was MIA, but they were here together on an actual getaway, just the two of them. Even if they weren’t currently actually together. Which...yeah, Steve thought, frown deepening.
The carriage finally ground to a stop, finally, just in front of the inn, where the crowd of people were parted around a long, gold-trimmed red carpet that had been rolled out across the ground all the way to the door of the inn. Steve could see the top of Tony’s head between the soldiers and others who surrounded him, clamoring for his attention.  A murmur of voices rose up outside.  The crowd was calling for their King. And then…then him.
, they just need to shut up.  You’re not going to do that, though, are you?  No, not you.  You’re just going to take it, aren’t you?  Take all of this,” Hammer said, pulling his cock out of his breeches.
“You should be with someone who...who doesn’t care about all that,” Steve sighed, looking down at the water before lifting his eyes back to Tony. “Don’t you want that?”
“Okay, but see, I have a jet.  Jets, actually.  Plural. With food and wine and one has this pole—“ Tony started to explain, then promptly clamped his mouth shut.
“Not the gym.  Probably...I guess the Met,” Steve replied. “I used to go there a lot as a kid. There and the library, I guess.  I had a lot of health problems when I was a kid, and so there would be times when we’d go into Manhattan for appointments and all--me and my mom, that is.  Or later just me.  Anyway, afterwards, that was a treat, you know?  The Met or the library if it was a Tuesday or Wednesday. The Met didn’t make you pay, which was great.  I mean, they suggest it, but you don’t have to.  So, we’d go there and just, I don’t know. Wander, I guess. I loved it, and I think she did, too. She always seemed...happy there.”
The alien smiled softly at him again, almost...shyly?  It--he--ducked his head a bit and looked at Tony from under stupidly long lashes, and why was Tony noticing that, anyway?  He shook his head, trying to clear it, but his thoughts were all cottony and good. No, not good, exactly, that was too simple, he realized.  He felt buoyant. Light. Free. And for a moment, just as the alien dropped his hands away, almost unbearably happy, in a way Tony didn’t think he had ever felt in his life.  No. Not happy.
,” Howard said, pounding a fist against the edge of the pool table, making the balls roll and clack together. “That’s why I’m worried about this whole thing with SI.  You want to let him play in your garage or you get some Professor who consults with SHIELD on the side to pat him on the head, fine, have at it.  He’s your problem now, God knows. But, this is the kind of thing you end up with.  It doesn’t look good.  And it doesn’t do anyone any favors in the long run, I’m telling you right now.”
Steve looked up to see Tony and Happy standing in library entrance, Tony’s face as mask of utter rage, eyes glittering, mouth a hard line.
“You hear all kinds of things,” Tony began. Strange happenings.  Most of them aren’t true, of course, not really, but there’s something here, don’t you think?  Some...power. I don’t know,” he added, glancing around. He shook himself a bit, then gave Steve a half-smile.  “People claim to...to
Tony was not going to make this easy. On either of them.  Perhaps it was better that way, Steve thought, bracing his back a bit straighter and squaring his shoulders, body suddenly thrumming with a jittery energy.  They were not so very different, the two of them.  Neither could trust something that wasn’t hard won.
“Nothing will happen to you. I won’t let it,” Steve promised, almost by rote, because he couldn’t not say it, even if he wasn’t sure if it was within his power or not.
As usual, I don't use a beta, so all typos and mistakes are my own, and I love and adore each one of them like my very own children.  No, wait, that's not true.  Please, feel free to tell me if you notice something.
“I will try,” Steve promised.  “On with you, now,” Steve urged, watching the boy practically run out the door, likely to try to get another glimpse of the carriage or to find a perch from where he could watch the comings and goings from the night’s extravagance rather than a rush to an early bed.
“He told me he offered you five million dollars to leave me, and you took it,” Tony said to the empty space in front of him. He couldn't look at Steve as he said it. He should, but he couldn't. He was holding on by his nails, and there was a chasm waiting below filled with anger and guilt and so many what-ifs he thought he would shatter apart if he let go.
“His friends,” Tony replied.  My friends, too, once, or he’d thought they were.  But that had been a lifetime ago.
“Tony,” Steve repeated.  It sounded odd.  So normal.  Common.  There was nothing common about this man, of that much Steve was certain, and yet, it fit, in the way the King’s face slackened and went soft sometimes, how his eyes lit up with humor at the strangest times, how he moved, all a whir and blur of motion when he was on to some idea or argument.
“Your Alpha?” Stone parroted, drawing his head back in surprise.  “Your Alpha,” he snorted with a disbelieving laugh.  “Ah. Right.”
I could go anywhere, Tony thought.  If I could drive.  I could go anywhere.  I wouldn’t.  But, I could.
Steve had replied as they headed for the subway stairs, his hands shoved in his pockets curling around his nickel until the metal heated in his hand.
“I’d smother the bastard if he tried,” Charles said with a chortle.  “No, no.  Not my David.  He likes to tell it that I chased him down, and the poor man had little choice, but, ask him, really ask him, and he’ll tell you. Saw me at that party, and thought, ‘That one’s mine,’ and that was it.  When my parents objected—he didn’t have much to offer, not then, as I said—he told him all about his plans for after the war.  How he’d take care of me.  Sales, he said.  He could sell water to a drowning man.  Cars were the new thing.  Everyone needed a car.  In America, anyway.  He’d start in sales, but he’d save.  Have his own dealership soon.  Then a franchise.  He had
“One way of putting it,” Barnes acknowledged brusquely.  “And when this is all done and you’ve, I don’t know, figured out world peace or whatever the fuck it is you’re doing, you’re just going to hand Steve a check and everyone goes on their merry way, huh?” Barnes asked.
“Ha!” Stane barked, pointing the cigar at Howard and raising his eyebrows.  “See? Kid’s got it, Howard, you watch. Want to build an empire, Tony?”
Steve in his bed, big body wrapped around Tony, hands molding into Tony's flesh, eyes hard and dark with lust, smiling that same soft, wobbly, crinkle-eyed smile, eyes bright with love. Steve next to him. Steve with him. A them. They could have that, again, or something close enough to it that the rest...well, the rest he could chalk up to life experience and childhood fancy. What was left, it could be enough. More than what most people got, most likely.
Or, he meant to.  He was sure that was his intention, except, somehow, he ended up partway into the forest before realizing where he was.  It was almost like coming awake again, except with none of the slow, easy wakefulness of the morning.  One moment, he was thinking of what he needed to do for the day to get everything ready to harvest, and the next, he was in the forest, with no memory of how he came to be there.  Steve looked around, unsure and not a little bit disconcerted.  He actually half expected that he
“Okay, yes, but you realize that’s not at all what that means,” Steve objected mildly, shaking his head and going back to his pancakes and paper.
Steve went through two more bags before calling it quits.  Somewhat to his surprise, he found himself anxious to get back home.  He could pick up something for dinner on the way back to the cabin, he figured.  He needed to stop by and let Coulson know he could stop monitoring Tony’s purchases, though, he realized with a slight grimace. He would miss getting the texts and trying to figure out what it was Tony was doing, like some sort of wondrous mystery, but if Tony wanted him to know what he was buying, Steve figured Tony would tell him.  Part of Tony trusting him was that Steve had to trust Tony, right?  Right.
“Uh, yeah,” Tony stammered, completely at a loss for a moment, though the woman's face had softened with the ghost of a laugh. “My, ah, my—it was my butler. Last time. Jarvis. He—he did the notarization. Actually, now that you mention it, it's—it's really the only time he messed anything like this up. That we know of, I suppose. I don't—I don't know why—I mean, it was—a lot was happening--”
Not that it had changed anything, except his subsequent attempts at defiance in the form of not immediately capitulating to Howard’s plans appeared to have cemented Howard’s idea that he needed an Alpha who would, in his father’s words, “appreciate that he needed a firm hand.”  So.  That didn’t sound particularly promising.
“It has worked well for me up until tonight, I must admit,” Tony mused, taking another drink.  “Go on, go on, do not let me give you pause,” he said with a wave of his hand. “This is truly delightful. Let me hear all about how you hold me in such high regard that you wish for someone else to take your place.”
“Your turn,” Steve said, taking the rough cake of soap from Tony’s hand. Tony turned, lowered himself, and let Steve cradle his head in the water while he ran the soap through the thick curls.  When he was done, Steve relaxed his hands, letting Tony’s head fall under the water while he rinsed the soap, then pulled him up, catching him under his arms.  Steve repeated the motions Tony had used, up and down Tony’s arms, gliding the soap from the tip of his fingers to the shallow of his neck, then down, over the metal disc that gleamed from the center of Tony’s chest.
Ain’t life grand?  Oh, maybe there were others, but they sure as hell didn’t talk about it.  Who the fuck in their right mind would admit that?
“Okay, well.  Let’s all just take a breath, maybe. That was—wow, okay,” Stane started, holding his hands out in front of him in a placating gesture.
“Oh, let me think…you’re all but intractable when convinced you are right, you care too deeply for people you deem in need of protection, you are far too wont to pick a fight, even when doing so is the last thing that is in your interest,” Tony pointed out, craning his head to the side to regard Steve for a moment as Steve’s fingers stilled on his neck.  “You don’t know when to quit.  I swear, if you came upon a wall between you and where you thought you should be, you’d chew your way through it before giving up.  Hell, you were bound in chains, injured, weaponless, and on your knees.  You
Three hours of bad coffee, brandied cherries, poached pears, graphs, profit and cost projections, environmental impact, investment credits and tax incentives had gone by without either of them quite realizing the time.  Tony found himself halfway through outlining the opportunities with the United Nations’ Sustainable Energy for All program when he realized Steve was passed out against the wall behind his bed with an Army Energy Initiatives Task Force request for proposals clutched to his chest in a partially crumpled wad.
“Okay,” Rogers said after a long moment, letting out the word with a slow hiss of breath that he’d apparently been holding.
“What? What is it that you want, Steve?” Tony asked, slow and barbed with too much knowledge of what, exactly, Steve
“I’ll keep pressure on the wound while you sleep.  Should stop bleeding soon,” Steve told him.  He tried to sound confident of that, as if he could somehow infuse Tony’s body with that certainty and maybe it would be enough.  He slid a hand under Tony’s head and gently lifted it, pulling the decrepit blanket out from underneath him.  Steve shook it out, sending dust and God only knew what else scattering into the room, then spread it over Tony.
“Your feelings for him are strong, though you’ve only known him a short time,” Tony continued, almost as if Steve hadn’t spoken.
wants to ride you like that bucking bronco thing they have down at the Mirage.  But, I think he wants to, like…talk to you, too,” Bucky finished, making a face at the last.
“Thirty,” Steve panted into the bed.  He dropped his hands and clutched at the covers, dry, heaving cries echoing in his ears that he realized were coming from him.  He felt Tony’s hands on his ass, pushing him apart, holding him open, and for a moment, thought he had done something wrong, it wasn’t over, he’d lost the count.  The bed dipped behind him as Tony sat down on the edge.  Bitter shame coiled low in his belly. He’d screwed up. He wasn’t sure how, but he must have.  Then everything was driven away and his mind stuttered to a halt as he felt Tony’s hot breath against his hole and then the warmth of Tony’s tongue tracing his rim.
He watched until the elevator doors closed behind her, then carefully opened the envelope.  There was a check inside.  It was simple, blue-green with black lettering, and almost as long as the envelope, dated today and made out to Steven G. Rogers in the amount of one million dollars.  Tony’s signature was at the bottom.  He had a nice signature, Steve thought, which he supposed was a strange thing to think when he was holding a check for more money than he would otherwise ever see in his life.
Anto knew the signal, of course, but he had never actually done it. The signal was for Alphas.  But, Steve had asked him a direct question, and he couldn’t really not answer, so he made the signal with his hands, flushing a bit with embarrassment as he did.  Steve watched him, then repeated the motion.
“No.  I suppose it doesn’t,” Tony acknowledged with a slight nod.  “But, it does make it reality.  And but for that reality, you, my soldier, would be in a watery grave, not here, with your every whim catered to,” Tony reminded him with a thread of challenge in his voice that made Steve want to shake him.  “Many would trade places with you, gladly, you know.”
was here,” Steve spat out.  “Touching you, and you were---God, Tony, I’ve never been so scared in my life.  He was going to kill you. You were
“Oh, definitely don’t apologize,” the man replied, pursing his lips together and cocking his head to the side like he was considering.  He slid his hand down the frame of the door, one finger brushing lightly over the woodwork, and looked up at Steve through lashes that covered dark, expressive eyes.  “You’re nervous.  It’s cute.  I get it.  First time with a pro?”
“Interesting timing,” Tony said, eyeing Matt with a narrow look, though he supposed the effect was lost. “Don’t we have a subsidiary in Denver?”
But it meant—well. Having a soulmark meant you were someone who could be loved. You had that. And as it turned out, just knowing that meant something to people. Maybe you wouldn’t be happy. There were no guarantees. But, everyone had the chance, and that mattered a whole fucking lot to people. Hell, murderers had soulmarks. Hilter, Stalin…Trump. They all had marks.
Heat flared in his gut again, and suddenly, he had to touch Tony, to see him, with no barriers between them.  He felt Tony’s fingers curl into his own on top of the bed. It occurred to him that the only thing he was wearing was his ring, the one Tony had given him in that strange metal, and Tony would be wearing his own ring.  The one that had been his butler’s, that he had held onto despite it having little material value. The one with the symbol for living. There was something beautiful in that, Steve thought. Their rings, the thing in Tony’s chest, and nothing else between them.  He wasn’t even sure if those things were between them, so much as a part of them, now.
“They just letting O’s roam around now?” Rumlow asked derisively, rubbing his finger under his nose in a crude gesture.  He looked at Tony again.
Tony tucked his spent cock back into his pants and walked over to the dais, taking each step at a time, until he slowly turned and sat down, eyes on Steve.
Steve could not deny that he was happy here.  That he could be happy here for the rest of his life.  The pang of shame that came with that realization was a pinprick against the same spot over and over.  It lessened with each thought, and all of the changes just being here had already wrought, all of the possibilities for their future, they were a salve on the wound.
“It was good, Tony.  I--well—it was good.  Very good,” Steve replied, a faint blush staining his cheeks.  Tony felt a warm glow of something that definitely wasn’t abject relief flood his stomach, as he released a breath he certainly hadn’t been holding for any reason.
Ok, well, that was odd.  Tony was the one that had wanted the pizza to go with an evening of something called “Firefly” that was apparently the greatest thing ever and could not be spoken of without a rant about big entertainment companies and their inability to see anything other than the bottom line.
“They have someone watch you while you pee in a cup. At the pain doc,” Steve replied, still looking at his own reflection and steadfastly not looking at Tony.
He used Rhodes’ momentum, rolled into it instead of with it, and threw the smaller man off-balance, blocking the intended blow, then striking fast.  Rhodes grunted and went down, looking up at Steve from a crouch in surprise.  Steve backed off, waiting for Rhodes to stand again.  He did, this time with his jaw set and eyes blazing.  This time, there was no sluggishness easing into the attack.  Rhodes came fast and hard, managing to land a hard blow to Steve’s hip, but that was the only one he got.  Steve moved, fast, trusting his body to remember, and then Rhodes was on the ground, wheezing and holding a hand up.
“Try to, I don’t know, like…think about it again,” Bruce suggested.  “Where were you, right before you were here?” he asked, glancing at Tony.
“Awww,” Tony said after a moment.  “That’s…” he pulled his face away and looked over a Rhodey.  He could feel his face heating. “Okay, that’s kind of like, super adorable.”
That was likely one reason why space missions usually had more than one crewmember. So that someone was always paying attention to the shimmies to think about whether this one was the kind that meant normal space weirdness or was actually the you’re-about-to-die kind.  That was the thing that ran through Tony’s head about two seconds before the panel in front of him lit up, nearly all of the gauges blaring an alert at him in the sudden cacophony that followed the explosion. That it was probably the shimmy.
“Um. Hey,” Tony replied, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat. “You, ah. What're you—what are you doing up? It's late,” Tony asked, then rolled his mouth into a grimace. They were both up, you idiot, he mentally scolded himself. What was it about Steve that made him go all slackjawed Lenny Small whenever he tried to use words?
His phone vibrated insistently in his pocket. Probably the voice of reason calling, Tony assumed, so he ignored it.
“I believe you were perfectly clear,” Tony replied, pushing himself off the worktable and finding his chair.  He plucked his goblet up, took a long drink, then leaned back and regarded Steve from over the rim, waving it in the air in front of his face with a disingenuous smile.  “But, by all means.  As you stand there in adornments I have given you, enlighten me all the more about how eager you are for someone to take your place after I have played the fool for the whole Court and city to see.  Please.  Go ahead,” he continued, lifting the goblet in a mock salute.  “Believe me, you have my full attention.”
Tony dug into his pocket and pulled out his phone, hitting the familiar number. It rang four times and blessedly went to the reprieve of voicemail. He closed his eyes and let his head fall to the cradle of one hand where his elbow banged onto the table, making his empty espresso cup jump.
Tony was torn between a desire to sag with relief and grab a spoon and a Rita Hayworth poster and start digging his escape tunnel.  Other than Obie, the only Alphas he’d really been around had been his father’s business associates and the occasional military liaison who stopped by the mansion, and they had been nothing if not obnoxiously predictable with their looks of half-interest, half-disgust.  Steve was…different.  Different meant unpredictable, which probably meant Tony ending up not able to sit for a few days.
Leaving the gym, Steve headed for the lockers to shower and change, his mind running in circles that involved crickets, Caltech and picnic baskets.  He was a few steps inside the locker room when he heard the voices.  Rollins, he recognized right off.  He thought the other was Calhoun, a new strike team agent who Steve hadn’t worked with yet, though he’d met him a couple of times.  The third was definitely Rumlow.
That hurt, Tony thought, shaking his hand to clear the worst of the stinging pain from his knuckles.   Surprisingly satisfying, though. “That’s my husband you’re talking about, Senator,” Tony bit out.
“Of course, though, I will have to give this some thought. My own, out of the Eastern Isles, is exemplary, but I’ve heard good things about those from Tytahn, as well. I am sure we can find you someone well qualified to the task,” the Ul said. By the look that passed across Tony’s face, Steve knew that he would never accept any candidate suggested by the Ul, not that Steve ever thought he would. “No matter,” the Ul waved his hand through the air, “you will have no trouble with these two. They have been very well trained, I assure you. I will have them sent to your capital, then. I am sure you will find much use for them, harem master or no, eh?” the Ul said, as if sharing a secret with Tony . “But, for tonight, you must enjoy them!”
“Nothing,” Steve said quickly.  “Nothing.  Forget it. We should get going if we’re going to make the observatory,” Steve said.
“Tony, this is…this is crazy, you know that, right?” Steve said.  “You can’t…buy a building and stay in some terrible apartment just to…”
“Yeah, well. This is a bit more than a battle scar,” Tony told him with a tight grimace.  He looked down and then made short work of the top few buttons of his shirt, pulling it apart with an almost brutal quickness, like he just wanted to get it over with.
He felt Steve sigh into his skin, place one quick, almost apologetic kiss there, and raise his head.  No, no, no, more of that, Tony mentally protested, brushing his hips back again.
“Matt and Foggy are friends.  Be nice.  Besides, I think you owe Matt one,” Barnes reminded him.  “Too bad Clint and the fam couldn’t come.  Laura’s great.  Kids are the best.  Clint…doesn’t suck.”
“I’m to be a scribe, not a soldier,” Cam protested. He sounded affronted.  Steve let out a low laugh that was mostly caught behind his veil, though he heard Peran grunt approvingly.
Steve stared at him for a moment, then sighed.  “You sure are weird about him, Shellhead. But, okay.  No more Stark talk. Want to hear about the time me and Bucky went down to see them install the statue of Washington in Union Square?”
,” Tony said.  “That stone,” he continued, pointing at the one that stood closest to the mountain, the one that was so different, “isn’t like any other stone I’ve ever seen.  In fact, no one has been able to identify its source in all the centuries we have been here. It seems to be unique in all the world, from what I can tell, and I went through a period of time of being fairly curious about all of this.  There
Tony was nowhere in sight.  Nor was he the whole day.  Or the day after that, though Steve woke long enough in the night to feel Tony slide into the bed next to him, wrap his arms around Steve’s back and bury his head into the curve of Steve’s neck.  When Steve tried to question him, it was met with a hushed order to sleep, and soon enough, Tony’s soft, even breathing.  It was nearly a week gone now, and Tony had only been back to his chambers to bathe, change clothes and find sleep, though never seeming to stay still long enough for Steve to get any kind of real information out of him.  Steve had awoken during two of the nights to find Tony sitting by the fire, staring at the flames, face drawn and haggard, but he had said no more than to entreat Steve to sleep, though he had joined Steve in the bed, then, so Steve counted that in his tally.
When the mysterious ‘Bucky’ did not materialize, Should Be In His Underwear No Matter What turned back to Tony, a slight flush burning up his cheeks as he gave Tony a quick, entirely too obvious once-over, and wasn’t that just adorable?

Then again in the lobby, when we were talking about how you weren’t going to say anything, and you nodded, and said, ‘Tony, I’m not going to say anything,’ and then in the elevator when you said, ‘Tony, please, for the love of God, I’m not going to say anything,’ So, anyway, back to the shoelace thing,” Tony said, giving pointed look to Rhodes.
, Tony, then, you called the wrong guy.  You’ve been happier the past week than I’ve seen you in—in I don’t know when. No, it isn’t smart. This thing with you and Rogers.  But, the two of you, you’re both more the run before you can walk types, you know what I’m saying?  Maybe this kind of crazy is just the right amount of crazy for you two.  Any sane approach and one of you would find a way to screw it up, let’s face it.”
