“He lit them up from the inside,” Sam spits out. “Bobby, we can’t wait until we get back. We have to do it now.”
“Divining a name isn’t something just anyone can do,” she says once he’s finished. “The memory loss isn’t a problem. Your angel’s gonna know its name if you can dig deep enough.”
There’s no lightning strike or earth-shattering realization. It just slots into place: angels aren’t unicorn levels of bullshit. They’re real, and one of them is standing a few feet away from him, washed-out and pale as he looks at this painting like it’s the answer to a question he doesn’t even know how to ask.
Once they’re back at Bobby’s a few hours later and Dean’s pulled a out couple of beers, handing one of them to Sam like a peace offering, Sam decides to broach the subject again. “I know we asked why Castiel is possessing you—” he holds his hands up when Dean opens his mouth to protest, “—but why did he save you in the first place?”
“Me and Sam’ll get back on the road soon as we find a job. Plenty to do then, but we got to lay out some ground rules,” he says, and grimaces when Castiel flutters in confusion. Instead of having that conversation, whatever that conversation even is, Dean shrugs wildly and hauls himself out of the car so he can replace the window. Sam appears while Dean is carefully slotting the new glass into place. He urks by the hood, listening to Dean sing along to Since I’ve Been Loving You when he’s not explaining a fiddly step to Cas.
“Maybe humans didn’t want angels overhearing some of their prayers?” she suggests wryly, and then laughs before Sam can think too far on what angels could possibly be doing that would make humans invent a whole language to avoid them. “Nah, it was just the priests at the time trying to keep Hebrew from becoming too dominant a language.”
Castiel focuses on the parts of himself and his grace tucked into the spaces between Dean’s atoms and extends his power outward. He moves Dean’s body, bending him over the table and fixing his grip on the pool cue. Dean’s thoughts fragment and for a moment Castiel worries.
“Shield of God,” Cas translates, tipping the medallion so Dean can see his, apparently old, name more fully. “Now I’m the shield of nothing.”
“Well, there goes my theory,” Dean grouses, throwing up his hands. “Thought maybe we had a reaper on our hands, but nothing adds up. The times of death should have been the same.”
She hums and nods, flipping through the pages and marveling over how well preserved they were. Sam doesn't dare speculate on the reason for that.
So he goes with Sam, waiting the extra time it takes for the cops to clear the area around the house, and they go through the same window Sam used to break in on their last visit.
“I thought not telling you would…” he falters, squeezes his eyes shut and breathes. When he opens them again, she’s frowning at him. “I thought it would keep you safe.”
Sue Ann refuses to move from the spot where she’s collapsed, praying feverishly—so with a few silent exchanges of eye contact, Dean and Sam decide to leave her there. Getting out of town before someone finds her or she regathers her wits is their number one priority now, anyway. The job’s as good as done, even if Dean feels like there’s something missing as they retreat.
Castiel watches him curiously as he breaks, pulling his shot at the last moment so none of the balls sink.
If this were a normal hunt, Dean absolutely would be sniffing up Layla’s skirt while Sam was off doing research in the capital, but nothing about this damn place has been normal. From the rain that never seems to let up, no matter how lightly it sprinkles, to the fact that the only answer they have is angels. He’s gonna be damn glad to see this place in the rear view mirror.
Sam clutches the bottle in his hand a little tighter and walks over to Dean, putting himself into his field of vision, so he’s forced to look at him. Dean meets his gaze desperately and the weight of it blows the air out of Sam’s lungs. “You’ve saved a lot of lives up here, Dean.”
“Hey,” he squeezes out and slips an easy smile on his face, aiming for lecherousness and landing closer to desperate. She shoots him a politely amused smile and then ignores him when Elijah steps forward and reaches out for her hands, wrapping them gently into his.
“I’m not here to convert you,” Elijah says, so quietly that Dean almost doesn’t hear it. Le Grange raises the hand not keeping Dean on his feet and tells the congregation to pray with them. Dean closes his eyes and tries to avoid flinching, unsure what to expect, but not wanting to see it.
He finds some of his clothes folded up in a drawer in one of the spare bedrooms that's been crammed so full of books and broken furniture that Dean's not even sure he'd call it a bedroom. There's only an empty bed frame and just enough space on the dusty floor that Dean could lay down if he didn't mind folding up like a pretzel to do it. But there's a dresser where he and Sam have spare clothes and ID for when they need to cut and run and have to leave behind their bags. Not roots exactly, but somewhere they can fall back to in an emergency. He locks the bathroom door out of habit and starts to peel the dirt caked clothes from his body.
“Good, good, I suppose we can use this to our advantage for now. Keep Dean Winchester under your thumb, Castiel. Don’t tell him anything unless we tell you to. Earn his trust. Watch his brother. We’re considering options for dealing with him and Azazel. Uriel will report to you. Until you hear otherwise, he’ll be taking over the garrison while you’re gone.”
He walks the perimeter of the store, checking aisles as he passes them. Partway down the back wall, the hairs on his arms and neck stand up. He whips around, reaching for the gun holstered at the small of his back, and finds Elijah observing him from a few paces away. He looks just as windswept and wild as before, eyes over bright in the fluorescent lights as they flicker above them. Dean’s heart lurches uncomfortably against his ribs and he smothers his body’s reaction when Elijah’s eyes drift downward, sweeping over his chest and body.
“Oh, is that the problem?” Sam asks, widening his eyes and lifting his eyebrows in a guileless expression. Dean scowls. “Want me to warm them up for you?”
The book tumbles to the floor as Sam throws himself bodily up onto his feet, closing the space between them in two steps. Dean looks up at him just as Sam reaches him and his eyes widen in alarm when Sam throws his arms around him. Tension coils in Dean’s back and shoulders and he sways backwards, away from Sam, only to jerk to a stop and go so still that Sam almost believes he’s holding a statue. Not Dean.
“I don’t—” Sam closes his eyes, so he won’t have to see the regretful expression cross Elijah’s face. “I don’t know if…
“You clean now?” he quips. There’s a flicker of annoyance and in the span of one blink and the next the stain is gone. In fact, the damn dashboard looks brighter and cleaner than Dean’s ever seen it. As if forty years of built up dirt and blood and sun damage have been lifted.
The pleased huffs of quiet laughter he gets at that make Dean want to lean in close and press his lips to the creases it makes at the corner of Cas’ eyes.
Bobby nods, conceding the point, but Sam can see him chewing his words. Probably a little more carefully than Sam has so far.
Who the fuck is this guy? Dean’s picked up a smattering of Hebrew and Yiddish over the years, but the word Elijah just called him isn’t part of his limited vocabulary. There’s a weight behind it. Like it means something. Like
“They’re all people we know,” he says, rubbing his side and hoping it’s only bruised. At least he’s not laid out on the floor with his chest ripped open. “Meg, Henriksen… those kids.”
“You’re a real jerk sometimes.” Sam scrubs at his mouth with the clean side of his hand and scowls, sitting back against the bench. “He healed me. Or were you too busy pushing Sue Ann around to notice that I’m not in an ambulance thanks to him?”
“I know what Passover is, but it still doesn’t make any damn sense,” Dean insists, and Sam looks up from the screen at him, perplexed. It makes more sense than reapers.
him. Castiel loves him, from the deepest core of his soul where it presses against Castiel's grace, to the highway of nerves curving through his spine and branching across his body like wings.
Professor Rebecca Callaghan of Lincoln University had been extremely happy to help Sam out when he’d approached her after her class on Christian history had ended. She’s been poring over the book for an hour in silence while Sam stews from a chair in her office.
When the service is over, Dean shoves himself out of his chair, fully intending to corner the healer, but Layla and her mother pull his attention away when they stand, and Mrs. Rourke gives him a indignant glare.
“Dean…” he starts, only to stop and look at him more carefully, and Dean realizes he’s digging into him a little. Prying where Dean can’t exactly stop him and getting ready to pull his ‘I know things’ crap. Cas nods like he’s figured something out. “I understand.”
The house is dead quiet save for the hum of an AC unit in the window of the living room. Dean strains to hear something else, lifting his hand up and then slowly lowering it down, palm facing the floor, as Sam clambers in after him. He reaches back for his gun and lets Sam lead them through the door into the hall and back towards the lit-up, open doorway ahead of them.
Everyone’s gathered inside the tent and out of the rain, so Dean peeks through the still-open flap. Almost everyone. It’s only Roy on the stage, talking to some member of the congregation with a smile on his face. Layla isn’t anywhere he can see, either.
Elijah doesn’t react to the nickname. He leans forward as if he could cross the space between them without thinking about it.
“I know the M.E. and believe me, it was a freak accident. There’ll be a correction in the paper tomorrow about it. Electrical fire. Burned his eyes out and everything.” She grimaces, and Dean nods in understanding, sucking in air between his teeth to feign disgust. “You’re fine.”
It’s so unbelievably Sam to come back at someone with a fucking scripture one liner that Dean huffs in stunned amazement. Then Sue Ann tries to tear away from Sam with a scream and the room erupts.
Roy nods. “Yep, and that’s exactly what happened. I went into a coma and the doctor was sure I wouldn’t wake up, but Sue Ann kept on praying, and one day she found Elijah out near the reservoir. Hit him with her car and everything. Well, she hustled him off the hospital and that’s where he found me.”
Arariel makes a sound and shoves herself up from the ground, turning to face them. “I agree with Uriel,” she says firmly.
“Yeah, okay, okay, maybe…” He chews his lip, thinking while Dean kicks off the rest of his wet clothes and changes. He opens another webpage and starts reading, sitting up excitedly once he’s gotten through a few paragraphs. “Hold on, what if… what if we’re both half-right?”
“What the hell, Dean, gross! You’ve been wearing the same clothes for like three days,” Sam screeches, bitch face firmly replacing the shattered expression from earlier, and Dean grins and reaches for the other one.
Light, so hot it makes Dean’s inside melt even as the cold following it freezes everything in its path, pours into his body and through his veins straight to his heart. The dying organ gives one last series of painful palpitations as Elijah’s touch sinks into Dean and then stops. The relief of it sends Dean crashing to the floor on one knee even while Le Grange tries to hold him. Or maybe that’s all part of the show. He opens his eyes and Elijah’s eyes are whited out with the same light, the space behind his shoulders and most of the room blacked out with shadows. He’s beautiful.
“It’s rained almost every day since he got here,” she admits, glancing at him to see how he’ll react. Dean nods encouragingly. “No one wants to say anything, but I’m not the only person who’s noticed and well, I think we’re all a little afraid to find out what it means.”
“Yeah, right. Besides, I thought we were going with Elijah being behind the murders. Aren’t angels all Michael Landon, It’s a Wonderful Life, harps on a cloud? This ain’t exactly angelic behavior here, Sam.”
“Dean!” Sam shouts and he covers the distance between them, throwing an arm out to brace Dean before he hits the floor. Distantly, he’s aware of Bobby hurrying over to them.
“He’s not possessing me,” Dean protests again, and Sam nearly bitches him out for it because semantics about Dean’s level of awareness or whatever don’t really mean much when he’s still got some sort of entity riding shotgun in his body.
A woman ducks in front of Dean and is nearly bowled over in the process when Dean is just a little too quick for her to get out of the way in time. The drink she’s holding sloshes over the rim of the glass to the floor and all over her hand. Dean reaches out to steady her arm.
He coughs a few times, grimacing with the pain, but is beaten to answering the question by Elijah stepping forward and placing a hand gently on Le Grange’s arm. He doesn’t take the pulpit, just stands to the reverend’s side and waits for the murmuring to quiet down. He looks at Dean like he’s a revelation and says steadily, in a voice that rumbles like the Impala down to the marrow in Dean’s bones, “Dean Winchester.”
“I didn’t think you’d let me in after our last talk,” Cas admits, blue eyes flicking away from the gun and to Dean’s face, pinning him with the intensity of it.
They drive back to the Le Grange house for hopefully the last time, Dean parking on the edge of the property to avoid attracting attention. It means having to hike the rest of the way on foot and creep through the sea of vehicles. There’s a few new cars and a dingy RV pulled up into the grassy parking lot. Roy’s starting to get attention, just like Sue Ann wanted.
“More like Joe Black,” Dean mutters and then scowls when Sam stares blankly at him, waiting for more information.
“Not bad,” a pleasant voice interrupts Castiel from admiring Dean and he straightens up and looks at the human that’s approached the table. His soul is bright enough, but there’s dishonesty hovering at the edges of his thoughts that makes Castiel squint at him, trying to get a better look at his intentions. “Need a few bucks for another beer before last call. Want to play a game for ten?”
“Solid iron,” Bobby grunts, hauling the heavy door shut and locking it from the inside. “Completely coated in salt. Hundred percent ghost proof.”
Everything stops. Dean puts the car in drive and wipes the fear sweat from his face with the sleeve of his shirt.
“It was,” Cas agrees. He glances over at Dean, and Sam watches his expression relax even further before he snaps his gaze toward the door. Sam realizes Cas was waiting for him to get back before leaving. It’s a humbling feeling. “There’s several things I still need to do. I already told Dean, but I wanted to—”
Layla looks away and through the window of the pharmacy, wearing an expression Dean’s seen on a hundred people with something to tell and the fear that they won’t be believed. He eases into an approachable slouch, unclenching the muscles of his jaw and neck and loosening his shoulders. Nonjudgmental and trustworthy.
“Killing? We can’t kill him!” He snaps the book shut with a dull thunk of leather against parchment.
When she’s out of the room, Dean drops the pretense and turns the full force of his attention onto Sam, who’s trying to pretend he didn’t hear anything, flipping through a pamphlet with fake interest.
He’s still surprised when she tells him, “We had a great couple of weeks three years ago, Dean, but I’m gonna be a realist. I don’t see much hope for us.”
Cas glances down at Dean’s hands wrapped around his, and Dean tightens his grip, waiting for a reaction. The angel could break all his fingers and throw him across the room if he wanted. He probably should. Instead, he awkwardly rolls his shoulders and admits, “I’ve never done this.”
Tucked away in the space where it was, however, is another, smaller book with no discernible title. Sam reaches for it and tucks the encyclopedia back into place. The leather bound text is a lot older than everything else in here. In fact, it might be older than most of the reference books he and Dean use. There are whole pages in languages Sam recognizes but doesn’t know, including a page with a drawing of a winged figure kneeling at someone’s feet.
It's like trying to argue with traffic. Nothing's gonna move Elijah except time and he's got way more of it than Dean. Hesitantly, Dean struggles up from the chair, flapping a hand at Sam when he tries to help, and eases out into the aisle, his heart fluttering at a hummingbird’s pace. Getting up the steps to the stage makes him wheeze and Le Grange grabs him by the arm. It’s impossible not to lean into the support while his chest burns from the exertion. Elijah steps in close enough to touch and Dean stares at him, taking in the unnaturally bright color of his eyes, the steady probing pressure of his gaze, and the line of his mouth bowed in concentration.
“You said six people died in the last year, right? But it’s been picking up.” Dean waits for Sam to hum in affirmation before going on. “Then let's hope Sue Ann’s not gonna risk letting Elijah off his leash on someone else too soon after that light show in the yard, so we—no,
Dean drives them back to Bobby’s while Sam looks at his phone and pretends there’s something interesting on the screen. It’s mostly old emails from his college friends, who he stopped replying to in May, and a couple messages from Jo that have already been answered. There’s a missed call from Ruby. He's still looking at it when Dean suddenly mentions her. Sam snaps his phone shut guiltily. The lie comes naturally, but it eats at him when the conversation falters again. He rests his head on the back of the seat and stares out the window at the trees.
The ambulance pulls into the driveway slowly, and one of the cops tries his best to look intimidating as he threatens Dean. “We catch you 'round here again and we’ll put the fear of God in you. Understand?”
Yeah, right. It’s so painfully normal that Sam can’t muster up the energy to be pissed off. Dean’s been acting off since the heart attack and only gotten more worked up since all this stuff with Elijah started. Especially after he went to the house and talked to him. Sam flips through the book, looking at various pages and trying to decide which ones to prioritize when he gets to Lincoln. Dean reaches out to tap one of the sigils drawn on the side of the page he’s currently on.
“Yes,” he says automatically and the man lifts an eyebrow at him and then shrugs, offering to set the table back up if Castiel will slide over the balls.
Dean spends five minutes scrubbing at a blood stain on the dashboard before Castiel hovers at the edge of his mind, asking permission to try something.
“Chanukah,” Dean replies sarcastically before looking sheepish. “It’s a cellphone. Call me. Me and Sam. Our cell numbers are already programmed in, and I can show you how to add more minutes if you want.”
Elijah looks like a man. The kind who works a nine-to-five, Monday through Friday job, and goes home to his house in the suburbs to sit down to dinner with his wife and kids. It’s the sort of life Sam daydreams about having. Reconciling the man currently dropping down into the mud at his side with the angel whose wings are still showing up as spots in his vision every time he blinks is impossible.
Dragging yourself out of the grave has to be about the worst thing Dean has ever done, and he once ripped someone’s lungs from their body while Alastair threatened to carve his spine out one vertebrae at a time if he punctured either of them.
Castiel watches as Dean reaches out with his arm and feels for a pulse on Bobby’s neck. It flutters against their fingers and Dean exhales in relief and stands up.
The left corner of Elijah’s mouth pulls up. It’s not a smile, but there’s a softness like he’s in on some joke that Dean doesn’t know about. He lifts his right hand up and cradles the side of Dean’s face.
He comes with Cas’ hand around him and the zing of scar tissue healing as Cas mouths at the puckered wound below his navel where a werewolf tore open his stomach when he was sixteen.
“The hell?” he rasps, grinding his teeth from the pain and sucking in air until it passes. When the world settles back into whatever is passing as the new normal, Dean spots the newspaper and grabs it to stare at the date. That’s something he can wrap his head around, right? Dates and times and the steady tick of a clock and not a ring of bomb blasted trees and a voice whispering science class vocab into his ear.
“Bobby, is this…?” he asks, feeling a grin starting as he scrapes his knuckles against the wall, feeling the rough texture against them.
“Soft ground.” He shoves the articles into the front pocket of his jeans and starts back through the house toward the window he came in through. “Pretty sure Roy’s picking victims he thinks are immoral and setting Elijah on them.”
“Our cash reserves are running low,” Sam says as he slides back into the passenger seat and points Dean toward their room so Dean can park. “We passed a pool hall a few blocks back that’s probably still open.”
Ford City’s just as damp and unpleasant as it was when Sam left this morning, a heavy drizzle tapping on the roof of the Impala as he pulls into an empty spot outside of the hotel. Dean’s waiting for him in the room, one leg curled under him where he’s perched on the bed, Sam’s laptop balanced carefully on his knee while he types.
Dean gapes at him. Elijah raises his eyebrows and waits patiently for a reaction, looking pleased and just a little smug at being able to throw Dean’s earlier words back at him. It occurs to him that Elijah does know what’s being implied and by whom, which makes it nearly impossible to resist coming back with, “Only if you’ve got the budget for them.”
Castiel is tired. Exhaustion pulses through every fragment of their being and to the very core of themself. Their wings, singed with hellfire and reeking of sulfur, drag behind them as Castiel carries the precious human soul free, and out into the open air. Eons stretch painfully before and behind them, time spinning on its axis in waves before Castiel refocuses back onto this singular, and consuming present.
“That’s not funny, Sam,” he snaps, and all the emotion he’s struggling to contain for the last few hours let loose. It’s so much easier than letting himself feel the fear. He pushes at Sam with his words, and shouts and eventually, Dean gives in and grabs him, shaking Sam in his anger until finally,
“Our orders are not at fault here, Uriel,” he insists, the words automatic. He wants to mean them. “This is my mistake.”
They pass by a white guy with neatly cut hair who’s standing in the rain and handing out papers, yelling about fraud. Dean grunts in agreement with him and gets a dirty look from a woman with a cane and a wide brimmed hat keeping the rain out of her face. Sam grimaces in apology at her.
He gets them both beers while Sam talks about Meg trapped in her own body, screaming for help. There’s something Sam’s not saying in the careful way he talks about Meg and the way he watches him when he thinks Dean isn’t paying attention. He puts his beer down after a few sips, the taste too many things at once to be enjoyable, and doesn’t pick it up again.
Sam looks up, startled. Dean can’t see it, but he assumes she flashes those ugly black eyes at him, because Sam draws back and tenses. The guy sweeping the floor on the other side of the room locks the door.
“Whoa, hey,” he stammers and steps back. Elijah’s hand drops away with a reluctant slide down his arm that ends with fingers brushing the back of Dean’s wrist. He takes another step back and directly into the edge of a bookshelf, jarring his elbow and shoulder hard enough to rattle the display. “Getting ideas. I’m not…”
Their first game ends with Castiel ricocheting the eight ball off the rim and into a pocket and Will, predictably, according to Dean, offers a second game to win back the ten he just lost. Castiel wins that one as well and then Will sinks two solids when he breaks the third game and laughs, lying about it being luck. Dean hum with amusement and Castiel brightens in response. He doesn’t understand the point of this at all, but Dean’s pleasure over his stilted attempts at conversation and the obvious dishonesty from Will is beautiful.
He motions Sam towards the house. It’s gonna be harder to get in with the cops lurking around, but confronting Sue Ann without an audience is gonna go a hell of a lot smoother than trying anything else. It’s tempting to send Sam up to the house alone and lead the cops away to where a couple of RVs are parked together in a semicircle, but he doesn’t trust himself to be fast enough. Not with how quick the angel’s proven to be.
“Like hell,” he snaps and he shoves a hand into the wing directly in front of him to move it. The thing snaps back with a slither of alarm from Castiel before he can touch it and then fades away when he unlocks the door and opens it to find a stranger standing in the middle of the room. The angel gazes at Dean and his lips curl up in barely contained disgust as he looks Dean up and down. Like he’s something he found on the bottom of his shoe. It’s not an expression Dean sees directed his way often, but it makes his anger just a little sharper.
“What, you think I don’t have caller ID?” she asks, and Sam laughs at himself. “You boys really put your foot in it out there. I’m not gonna be able to do much from where I’m at.”
Sam makes a noise of confirmation and there’s a muffled curse as Dean presses the towel over his face and then tosses it into the sink before striding back out.
Because nothing good in their lives comes for free, and Dean’s been waiting for something to come up.
“That’s what he says—said.” Dean waves his hand through the air and makes a face. It’s two parts irritation and one part emotional constipation. “Whatever.”
“What do you want to do?” Sam knows he’s going to follow Dean no matter how flimsy his reasons. There’s no point dragging it out, and the closer he stays to this, the better chance he has of convincing Dean that Elijah is the farthest thing that could possibly exist from the monsters they hunt, save God.
It’s gone when he blinks. Dean stares at himself, jaw clenching and grinding painfully, and tries to calm the pounding in his chest.
There are a few promises he wants to keep and won’t that he throws out there to make the goodbye hurt a little less, but ultimately, he does exactly what he knew he would from the beginning: he gets into the car with Sam and leaves.
“That shouldn’t be an issue,” Cas assures, and he reaches out to touch the sleeve of Dean’s flannel. “I’ve observed Earth for millions of years. Just because I’ve never engaged in sex, doesn’t mean I don’t know what it involves. What would you like to do?”
“Ain’t afraid of God here,” Dean snipes, ripping his arm out of the older cop's hands and crossing over to where Sam’s waiting for him. Sam's rattling out of his skin and desperate to talk.
“What do you mean, half right?” He can feel Dean staring at him from across the room and ignores him, pulling up another search and looking for more information.
“That’s not… she’s trying to help,” he gasps, pushing himself back with the heel of his boot. Nearly there. “I’m saving people.”
“No,” he answers firmly. The heart in his chest races, muscles aching in a way he doesn’t understand. He’s certain Dean must feel it down in the place where Castiel has hidden his conscience away. “Dean asked me to stay with him. If I leave now… when he’s still trying to decide if he trusts me—
He’s nice enough to leave off the implied ‘after you nearly killed him’, but there’s a guilty bow in Cas’ eyebrows that lasts long enough for Dean to notice.
He jumps, jerking back guiltily and twisting to look down the steps towards Layla as she climbs up to them.
He looks up to the top of the steps and sees Elijah peering down at him, wearing the same clothes as yesterday. The only difference is that he's stripped off the jacket and the dark blue tie has managed to flip itself backwards. His hair, which had been at least sort of tamed Sunday, now looks like it went through a wind tunnel. Or someone put their hands in it. Unfortunately, even standing partially protected on the porch, the rain’s doing a good job of slowly ruining the effect.
“Yeah, maybe. Find out what it means first. I don’t want to accidentally transfer fucking ownership.”
And then she’s not quite Jess anymore, energy pouring off her as she reaches out to grab him and rip his heart from his chest. Sam stumbles back a step, face wet as he raises the gun up, closes his eyes, and pulls the trigger.
Dean rears back with an offended huff and stalks towards the beds to start digging through the duffel bag. Sam smirks at his retreating back. It takes Dean a few minutes to say something while Sam debates reopening his laptop and trying to find evidence Dean can’t deny.
The rain’s stopped by the time Dean aims the Impala toward the hotel, and he goes as fast as the speed limit will allow. Sam tries to say something after a couple of minutes, but Dean reaches over to crank up the volume on the tape deck, drowning him out. He doesn’t stop looking over at Dean, though, even if there’s no conversation to be had with the Stooges rattling the windows.
Cas watches him. Dean avoids eye contact to focus on what his hands are doing. Which is not brushing his fingers against the back of Cas' neck and watching his throat bob when he swallows. Do angels even need to swallow?
Sam frowns, but pulls a notebook out of his bag. He reaches for the pen on the bedside table and uncaps it with his teeth, scribbling a few lines and watching the ink go from faded to dark blue in a few strokes.
do that, except Sam’s been hovering over him every time they pull over—because needing to piss every ten minutes is just another problem Dean’s gotta deal with, now. Which leaves Dean with nothing to do but tally up the loose cash he’s been depositing into the Bank of Impala since Dad gave him the keys and got himself a truck. Two thousand from a few nights in Springfield shoved under the loose corner of carpet on the driver's side by the brake. Nine hundred left over from the lesbian couple who had insisted on paying him for saving their daughter's life from a ghoul back in '99 that he hadn't been too prideful to deny after two and a half weeks of eating nothing but peanut butter and half-rotten apples. Five hundred in the barrel of a 12 gauge that got cracked in half by a Chupacabra in New Mexico. Six grand that Dean's been earning for years, mostly on his knees. Sam's deposited his own money despite Dean's protests and hell, there might still be some of the cash Dad left him tucked away where the vinyl cracked on the backseat.
He loses track of what he’s supposed to be doing for Cas in the wake of the angel’s studious exploration, mind gone hazy and distracted. Cas finishes with a wet kiss to his collarbone that leaves Dean shivering when the old break corrects itself, and then Cas unwraps Dean’s fingers from around his dick and does the whole thing over with the right arm.
, Cas explains. The answer makes him go cold. He can't remember the last time he really felt human. He was Sam’s shield when he was four, his father’s God damn blunt instrument as soon as he could hold a gun, and forty years is so long. He knows the taste of sulfur and blood intimately and wonders frantically if his eyes were black the first time Castiel saw him.
Castiel has been to places like this before. Humans gathering together for drinks and games is not something new, though the game they’re playing isn’t familiar. He hovers near the surface of Dean’s consciousness, observing from behind his eyes and reaching out around the room to learn their surroundings. Dean sweeps the room to check for obvious dangers. No one stands out to him, but Castiel sees a pair of vampires at a table in the middle of the room. He doesn’t bring them to Dean’s attention the way he did the demons in the diner. They’re clean of human blood and only here to enjoy themselves.
“Well, you’ve got the cheapest expert around to teach you then, but you knock me up and I’m gonna take your name back.”
Sam barely bothered looking at the guy except for a grateful mumbled thanks after helping pick Dean up off the stage. Had he been wearing a black suit? He decides to ignore Dean and pulls his laptop back over, opening up a new tab and leaving the old research up just in case.
Sam pushes up into a sitting position. There are people hovering nearby, murmuring prayers, and Wright’s body is—Sam makes himself look—the same as the others. Eyes burned out and gaping up into the rain-filled sky. He stands up hesitantly, testing his limbs for pain and finding none, and then starts looking for Dean.
“Is there anything in there about how to break the seal? Er, pentacle?” Sam asks. Interesting as the bit about the Aramaic is, it doesn’t help right now. “I could definitely use something like this in a book I’m writing, but I’d like to be a little accurate, you know.”
“Trying to figure out how hands on I can get until you figure out this timeshare shit. I’m not gonna have you lurking around getting your rocks off watching me in the shower. It’s creepy.”
“We don’t know that,” Sam assures him hurriedly. His eyes are blown wide with panic. “You’re not possessed, Dean. You can’t be. We checked.”
“I’m fine.” Dean keeps shaking his head, like he’s trying to dislodge something from it. “Gotta… I know, Cas, it’s okay. We’ll go.”
“I was checking out demons in Tennessee, and out of nowhere, they took a hard left. Booked it up here,” Sam explains. Dean’s hope that finding Sam would explain something—
“He’s hanging around inside my head. Gonna wind up figuring it out anyway,” he says defensively. “Not like it’s a secret.”
That’s a leading question with way too many answers and Dean’s caught on to the fact that Cas keeps trying to turn this crap back around on him. Make this into something Dean isn’t going to let it be. Did he
Elijah remains beside him, blue eyes fixed in the direction Dean went. There’s a coiled energy under the skin containing him, and Sam doesn't look away from him even as voices, one of them Dean’s, start rising. He can’t make out what’s being said, but Sue Ann makes a shrill shout for help, and Elijah strikes. A warm palm presses to his forehead.
The gas station he finds is somehow empty despite being appearing well stocked and still in use, so he breaks in. He stumbles immediately toward the water bottles and grimaces when the water tastes disgusting. Oily and slick as he swallows it down. He puts the bottle down with a twist of his mouth and smacks his lips. At least the dirt taste is gone.
“Oh, right!” Dean interrupts sets aside the pistol he’s pieced back together and jumps up to pass Sam and Cas—his shoulder bumping Cas’ as he passes—to get to the duffel bag now sitting packed and closed on the floor. He crouches down to dig through one of the side pockets, pulling out a cellphone that Sam recognizes as Dean’s other other cell. Standing up, he offers it to Cas, who accepts it with a confused frown. Sam grins in delight and ignores Dean’s suspicious glare.
“Do what?” Dean demands and Bobby groans. This is exactly what he didn’t want to happen. A big blow up here and now is gonna make Dean run and give that thing a chance to take over. Then they’re gonna be chasing him down for who knows how long. “You gonna exorcise me, Sam?”
“I’m not going to risk you damaging him before we’re ready. We’ve only broken two seals and Michael’s angry enough over Castiel touching his things, without you frying his cortex a few more times. We tread lightly, or this whole apocalypse falls apart.”
“How can you see all the things we’ve seen and be this skeptical?” Sam asks, puzzled and a little offended. Dean looks out at the slowly growing crowd as they near the tent. The sick people and their families and friends slogging desperately through the rain, carried on by the hope of something good happening for them. He shoves his hands into the pockets of his hoodie and scowls.
Okay, that’s a lot. Dean refuses to derail the conversation based on the implications of that right now, but it’s a close thing. He has to start folding clothes to keep silent. He smooths the lines on a t-shirt across his thigh and rolls it tightly into a cylinder before tossing it across the room and into the open mouth of the duffel bag.
The doctor nods, rambling a little when she explains. “Young guy around your age. Athletic. Paper reported it as a heart attack, but…” She hesitates, and Dean forces a guilty smile, ducking his chin down bashfully.
She relaxes and walks away. Castiel picks up the traces of worry that Dean might still follow her back to her table.
“Ask around,” Dean says defensively. “Someone’s gotta know something useful. Maybe that Layla chick?”
It takes Dean three hours before he relaxes enough to convince himself that Sam isn’t going to say anything else about what happened. Or mention the scar, though he keeps shooting it looks when he thinks Dean isn’t paying attention. A giddy feeling of relief settles over him. Like he got away with something.
“Of course,” Zachariah says finally, and he seems barely contained within his vessel, on the verge of lashing out, but unwilling to do so. Castiel appreciates his control. “And
His laptop battery is running low, but Sam doesn’t want to move and grab the cord from where it’s twisted on the floor behind him. He’s been scrounging through websites for information since he got back from the gym where Marshall Hall died. The city’s better about putting their records online than a lot of places they’ve been to, so pulling up obituaries and newspaper articles from the last year hadn’t taken long. It’s still a surprise that he beat Dean back to the hotel though, but here he is, staring at a stack of evidence that says his brother’s right.
“Angels aren’t supposed to engage in relations with humans,” he argues defensively. “It tends to create abominations.”
Except maybe it is. The car's been their home since they were kids and Dean’s baby since Dad handed the keys over to him with a pat on the back and a stern warning to treat her like a lady. It took him until a few months before he died to start teaching Sam maintenance and now he’s a few days out of the grave with Castiel’s power clinging to his fingers and yeah, okay, he gets why Sam's got a bug up his ass. Doesn't mean he has to like it. “What’s your problem?”
Sam drops his bag onto the far bed, frowning, and Dean shrugs into his jacket, checking he’s got his wallet and cash on him before offering Sam a salute and walking back out.
“Have faith, Mrs. Rourke,” Sue Ann calls from the door, and all of them look up toward her as she pushes it open. “Elijah, come inside.”
She goes back to a section of text near the beginning and points with a pale green fingernail to part of it.
He spits up soil and gags on the sour aftertaste of a worm that had gotten into his mouth as he drags himself to his feet to look around. It looks like a bomb went off; his grave is ground zero. Something is watching him. He can feel the sensation in his bones. Long forgotten hunter instinct makes him turn in a slow careful circle to stare out at the wide expanse of destroyed trees, trying to spot it. Anything. There’s nothing there, but the itch of eyes on him doesn’t leave.
While the boys are still getting food, Bobby wishes he had a few more of his books with him. Hopefully, he and Sam can get Dean back to the scrapyard without Dean throwing a shit fit. They can get Dean downstairs and locked up. Figure out what rode him out of Hell. Bobby isn’t a fool. He’s been to plenty of séances doing this job and the thing had surfaced up out of Dean when Pamela had put in the call. Nearly blinded them all with the light show in the process. If Dean hadn’t pulled away from Pamela, Bobby’s sure they’d be dead or blind and Dean would be walking around with that thing using his body like a meat suit.
“A freebie.” Cas tests the word out and reaches up to push Dean’s hands away from his collar so he can cup Dean’s face in his hands. Dean stills, heart thudding heavy in his throat at the intimacy of the action. “Do you want this?”
He nods into the silence of the car. Searching for another psychic will take time they don’t have, and Missouri’s hours away. He groans, pulling his hand away from the wheel long enough to swipe it through his hair and suck in a breath to calm down. Missouri waits patiently on the other end for him to pull himself together.
“It’s familiar. In a way that most things since coming here haven’t been,” Elijah answers, looking at Dean again, and that scraped out feeling slinks back full force.
It takes far too long to find Bobby in the scrapyard, dragged up into one of the cars by a couple of ghosts. They’re alive by the end of it, but Sam's limping slightly as he pushes open the front door.
Elijah follows him through the hallway toward the front door and doesn't stop until Dean's back out on the porch. It feels a little like being chased out.
The last thing Sam sees is the pitch-dark imprint of wings burning into his pupils as they stretch through the air above.
“That’s it, sweetheart. You look so good. Come on. You want my mouth or you wanna come like this?” Dean murmurs, the words bubbling up instinctively while Cas keeps tugging at his clothes. He manages to wrestle Dean out of his layers and down to his jeans and undershirt. Dean expects Cas to let him get back to the business of getting him off, but Cas lifts Dean’s free arm and kisses his knuckles. The bones shift effortlessly back into place without pain, and Dean sucks in a breath. There’s no ache in the joints when he clenches his hand into a fist until the skin turns white.
“Dude. Brad Pitt.” Sam watches him wave a hand and gesture at his own body like he’s trying to make him see something that's clearly only in Dean's imagination. “Black suit, deva— uh, doesn’t know how to act like a person?”
Sam shakes his head, smiling a little. “Bet he can’t really stretch his wings in a car, Dean,” he says thoughtfully. “Do you think he could have flown us here?”
When it’s light enough outside, Dean goes out and starts sweeping the glass out of the Impala. He shoves an AC/DC tape into the deck and cranks the volume all the way up, pulls on gloves to keep glass from his fingers, and gets lost in the utterly mundane task of car repair. There’s still a scattering of shards glittering on the vinyl when he’s done and he gets Bobby’s shop vac and an extension cord. Castiel slips into his awareness, brimming with idle curiosity that Dean figures is more about this being the only thing he’s got to look at from behind Dean’s eyes than any real interest in detailing. Not that it stops him from opening his mouth and explaining what he’s doing. Even if Castiel isn’t another person standing around watching him work, Dean still feels the instinctive need to fill the silence between them. The angel nudges the occasional question at him while Dean sorts through the shit that’s collected in the glove box, wondering about the importance of every item Dean puts back versus the pile of old receipts and wrappers that wind up in the trash.
“Castiel,” Pamela says slowly from her chair, feeling out each sound in her mouth. She looks at Dean like she knows exactly what he’s carrying around in his veins. Without thinking, he escapes out of the room and slams his way out of the house towards the car.
Sam flinches, twists his face away, and a whisper of sound brushes against the shell of his ear. Claws rip him free from the connection and push him away and he slams into the awareness of his own body. Sweat and blood drips down his face, soaking the collar of his shirt, and his hands are ice cold. He opens his eyes and grins victoriously at the question Dean’s asking with his eyes.
“Sonuvabitch, really, Sam?” he grouses, sitting up and flinging one of his discarded socks in Sam’s direction. His brother splutters in disgust and flings the offending garment away.
“No, but I saw that thing before it laid hands on me. This isn’t your momma’s harp strumming angel if it really is one. It means business and if Dean’s got one riding him—”
He turns the TV on. The signal’s good enough that Hogan’s Heroes is almost watchable. It makes for good background noise while he sorts through his and Sam’s clothes to determine what’s worth saving. Sometimes, not even Dean can get the blood splatters off a pair of jeans or shirt and regular wear breaks down everything eventually. Which is why Dean isn’t prepared for John Banner’s voice to fade into static and the bed to dip with extra weight as feathers rustle through the air.
Castiel’s been hard to read so far, but he’s in Dean’s body, so his reactions must be getting filtered through Dean’s long learned habits and body language. Sam’s seen the way Dean’s picked up the strange stillness from the angel already. So when Castiel draws back and looks away, Sam spots the look of someone caught.
“There’s a whole bit in Enochian—oh, I should have known this was about binding an angel from the beginning, sorry, I swear I actually know this stuff, but I mostly teach the historical, not the theoretical and definitely not the magical, but yeah, it’s all about the names of angels and how important they are. Cause you see, if you know an angel’s name, you can use it to summon them. Or control them, in this case. At least that’s what this priest of yours was trying to do anyway.”
“Bullshit, Sam. You and your demon hiding in the dark.” His stomach drops, staring at her in shock. She lashes out at him again, hitting him so hard in the chest that he goes careening back into the floor behind the desk. She stalks closer. “How many innocent people has Ruby burned through for kicks, huh, Sam? Girls just like me. And you don’t send her back to Hell?”
“You okay?” he asks tentatively. The sink turns on in response, but it doesn’t do much to cover the sound of Dean gasping for air between coughs. Sam rolls his eyes and gets out of bed so he can get dressed.
“Something like that. You’re not supposed to question God,” she insists. Dean doesn’t argue, not wanting to alienate her any more than he already has at this point, but he knows down to the marrow in his bones that if there’s a God then questioning the bastard’s half the point. “Elijah’s wanted to heal me for months, but God hasn’t—it’s not the right time. My mother talks so much about how I deserve to be healed, but I’m starting to think it’s only putting off the inevitable.”
“We’ll come back this afternoon,” she assures her daughter, still drilling holes through Dean as they walk towards the entrance. “You need to rest now.”
“Yes, I’m here again,” she says, the exasperation and exhaustion written into the lines on her face. She sags tiredly.
Sam’s surprised Dean even remembers to introduce him to Layla Rourke before her mother comes up along and leads her away into the tent.
His brother shifts back and forth, nervous energy skittering through him as he glances out the window and into the yard.
“Let’s see,” she murmurs, shifting slightly so Sam can read over her shoulder more easily. “If I’m translating this correctly, he was trying to bind a demon… no, not a demon. Djinn? There’s some crossover. I think he means an angel. Let’s see, dead, dying? Probably death. Angel of death. Or a reaper. Stories overlap on that if you look in the right places, so it’s an easy mix up. Explains why he wrote this part in Aramaic though. Angels can’t understand Aramaic.”
Sam lifts his chin and frowns, worry narrowing his mouth and Dean can see the gears turning in his brother’s mind before something clicks into place with a twitch of his nose and eyebrows. “Okay, Dean.” Sam nods and turns back to the house.
“Sam,” Missouri says firmly, and Sam snaps his mouth shut. “You're much more powerful than you think. You can do this.”
Elijah’s eyes flick back up to his face. “You’re following me,” he states, simple as you please, like Dean didn’t just nearly shoot him in a bookstore. Dean doesn’t have an explanation, and he sure doesn’t feel like giving one either, so he shrugs, daring Elijah to complain about it by lifting his chin and staring him down. Instead of backing up or looking away, Elijah just keeps puzzling over Dean, a problem he can’t solve. “I think this is where I should say something about getting ideas, yes?”
Dean gawks at her, incapable of answering. She turns away from him in disgust and leads Layla back towards their car. He waits until they’ve driven away, and the rain starts to soak through the outer layer of his coat and to the lining, before walking to his car.
“Yeah, I uh, I’m just trying to get a sense of what happened,” he explains hastily, taking the steps two at a time to get them back on more even footing. “And how you knew my name.”
“Your arm,” Elijah says, reaching for him again, and Dean throws up a hand palm-out and halts him in his tracks. Nope, he absolutely cannot do this. Not like this, not ever, and definitely not with whatever the hell Elijah might be. There are two very firm strikes against the guy, and Dean isn’t even counting the part where he has memory loss and might be being forced to kill people.
“Why?” he asks. The anger’s still there, but he tamps it down and focuses on Elijah offering a piece of the bigger picture. He won’t leave the damn job undone.
The air in his lungs leaves his body in a rush and blood, thick and salty, fills his mouth. He forces his eyes open and looks up into a nest of wavy dark hair and vivid blue eyes. His breath hitches when he tries to inhale, jaw aching, and realizes there's a hand around his neck, and it's squeezing. Barely contained power pulses against his skin and the blood trickling down his throat start to burn.
“This is Sam,” he says between one deep breath and the next, when the quick movement catches up to him and makes his head spin.
“Watch it,” he chastises with a gasp of laughter. Dean mutters something rude at him and screws his eyes up so they’re not looking at each other. “Oh my God, Dean, get a grip.”
Dean focuses on the second guy hovering out of the way behind the woman’s chair. Sam’s specialist. He’s maybe a few years older than Dean, and for every bit of the Le Granges' mild Midwestern appeal, this guy exudes an air of someone that doesn’t quite know why they’re even in the room. He looks uncomfortable in his own skin, arms hanging awkwardly at his side. The black suit, blue tie, and wavy dark hair makes him look like a funeral director, not a faith healer, and the distantly curious look he keeps giving people makes Dean nervous.
“No.” Dean cuts him off quickly, then tries to smooth it over with a hastily added, “It’s cool. Find yourself or whatever. We’ll keep in touch.”
“No, but you certainly do to me,” Zachariah says genially from just behind Castiel’s shoulder. All of them go still at his arrival, waiting for orders. It's been centuries since Zachariah took a vessel. “Arariel, Uriel, why don’t you two return to the garrison for now. Balthazar? Take those blades to the arsenal.” The other three angels fly and Castiel draws his wings into a neutral position at his back, folding the pairs into place nervously. Zachariah circles around him, face splitting with a toothy smile that makes Castiel hesitate to offer up the now practiced explanation. “Now, I happen to know that you were testing a vessel in Pontiac before your garrison was assigned to pull—” Zachariah drops his hand onto Castiel’s shoulder with a heavy clap. It resonates through his grace and into his true form. “—Dean here out of Hell.”
But there’s Dad, and that puts a stop to Dean’s brief fantasy. Dean can barely handle the fact that he’s been looking at Cas and seeing some
“You came to be healed,” Elijah says and there’s no question in his voice. He says it with the same surety he had when he said Dean’s name.
Castiel narrows his eyes, looking peevishly at the room. “I’m stationed here. To watch you. And Dean.”
“He’s talking to you right now?” Dean doesn’t look at him, scowling at thin air and shaking his head fiercely. “Dean?”
She smiles, self-assured in her faith. “And to punish the wicked. And you are wicked, Dean. Blasphemy. Theft.”
“No. I considered it, but it’s likely that would require submitting myself for… re-education, and I’m not certain it would work after what you did.”
“I know what you said, and you weren’t wrong, so shut the hell up about it. Why're you here? Figured you went back to...” He jerks his head toward the ceiling, deliberately trying to not think about the reality of a single angel meaning that Heaven and God must exist, too. He’s been edging around the thought for weeks and he’s going to keep doing it for as long as life will allow it.
Flashes of Dean's memories hit them both. Dean holding a woman from behind in a bar, his groin pressed against her hip as he whispered instructions in her ear, bending her over the table and into the shot. Bending her over the edge of a bed later that night. There’s a flush of heat up Dean’s back and neck that settles low between his legs. Castiel murmurs an apology and gets a grunt in return. The anger he expects isn’t there, but Dean’s confused, thoughts spinning around their conversation in the car. Castiel releases his hold on Dean and sinks back into himself.
The grip on his neck disappears so suddenly that Dean drags in too much air and starts coughing. Cas reels back and away, clutching the necklace to his chest and staring wide eyed in astonishment at him. Dean twists aside and coughs blood out onto Sue Ann’s hardwood floor.
Dean's been trying to explain for several minutes, faltering and fumbling through the words, and getting sidetracked with every question Sam asks. He hedges around expanding on why or how Castiel got consent to possess him, but circles back around to insisting he's in control of himself. Except for both times Castiel's taken him over now. Sam's sure there's more he’s missing about this. Whatever the real reason Dean has for saying yes to Castiel, Dean's alive and breathing right now thanks to him. Sam wants to believe a good thing has happened. Angels are servants of God and one saved his brother.
He straightens up in the seat and fumbles the phone, nearly dropping it in his haste to protest. “Wait what? No, I can’t—I’ve had a couple visions, Missouri. I don’t have any kind of control to read an angel or whatever.”
Le Grange steps back up to the pulpit and picks up where he left off, diving into the immorality of homosexuality with the earnest fervor of a true believer. Dean’s skin crawls, but there’s a thrill of satisfaction in knowing he’s exactly what they’re preaching against one way or another, even if he doesn’t swing that way.
Dean nods and heads in the opposite direction she went, towards the bar. Castiel listens curiously to Dean thoughts, a swirl of images and vague memories of women he’s been with in the past, while he waits for the bartender to make his way over.
“There are more battles than this one. More seals. As a hunter, you should understand that there’s a much bigger picture here. I did what I thought necessary.” Castiel stalks over to him. “Show me the respect I deserve, Sam. I'm not your enemy.”
“You’ve looked upon one of God’s own angels with lust in your eyes,” she accuses, composed and unfailingly certain. “I should never have let him lay a hand upon you. There’s no healing the sickness festering in your soul.”
“All right, we’ve got a name,” Bobby says, and he and Sam exchange a look, having a conversation around him. Dean tilts his head and watches their body language. Tries to see if there's an attack coming. “Let’s head back to Pontiac.”
Cas pulls his hoodie back on and the illusion of humanity completes itself a little, except for the intensity in his eyes when he looks at Dean. Nothing human about that level of focus being directed at him. That’s gonna take some getting used to.
Forty minutes later, Sam pulls into a gravel driveway, passing a lit-up billboard planted in the mud declaring ‘Service Today!’. He parks in the field outside of a worn out, but tidy, two-story farmhouse. People are spilling out of the couple dozen cars and the two RVs already parked there. He spots a few struggling on crutches and walkers in the mud. The sign outside of the tent’s open flap calls the place the Church of Reverend Le Grange and Sam hears the sharp angry inhale Dean makes when he notices it.
“Yeah, okay, we can head out in an hour. I’m nearly done here and it’s, uh,” he pauses, thinking quickly, “seven hours maybe. We could make it there before midnight.”
“—then we’re gonna have to figure this out real quick,” he finishes, looking at the glass scattered across the room. He raises his eyebrows in Sam’s direction. “We might want to think about getting out of here soon.”
Bobby suggests reaching out to a psychic. Dean can't argue against it. Worried as he is, he wants to know. So, a few hours after finding Sam, they're in Pamela's house, Dean sitting at her right, beating a rhythm against the table with his fingers while he waits for everyone else to sit down. Pamela smirks at him, flirtatious and easy as she sits and throws her hair back behind her shoulder. Throwing a few quips and looks her way ain’t a hardship. Proves he’s functioning on all the important cylinders.
Dean settles back against the counter and tips the bottle into his mouth, taking a long pull, only to grimace around the mouthful before swallowing it.
“Pretty sure he didn’t touch me there," he manages, keeping his voice as light as he can. Pamela grins at him as he bares his arm, and the hand print, to the room instead. He has to force himself not to pull away from her hand when she touches it. Not only does it still aches, but it makes Dean feel like the thing burrowed into him and left a brand. Marking him like prized cattle. Her hand feels like a violation. Touching something deeper than his skin. He almost tells her to go back to trying to touch his dick.
