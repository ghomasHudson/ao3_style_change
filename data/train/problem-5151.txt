“If they’re demons? Yes, I do,” Cas agreed reluctantly.
“So what’s this madness has to do with a dead reporter?” Cas asked him.
Dean had slept around eight hours when he woke up.
“Oh, whatever,” Roman rolled his eyes, shifting his wrists uncomfortably. “I made her Vice President.”
“I did,” the Omega looked back with a raised chin. He wouldn’t apologize for saving Sam’s life.
“We got out of trickier situations than this, babe,” Dean forced a smile onto his face.
“Traitor,” Dean scowled at him.
“I don’t have anything against Dean –” he stopped for a moment with a frown. “Well, that’s not true. He broke Cassie’s heart.”
Cas chuckled and let his hand rest on Dean’s hip.
“But not for long, otherwise we’d be too controlling.”
“Ready to go,” Charlie reached their table and threw down a couple bills to cover their orders. Dean didn’t even put up a fight about it.
“Yeah,” he admitted. He sighed, “Look, maybe Cas can help. But I was the one who left him hangin’. He’s… I can’t bring my crap to his door, okay?”
So they got up and ready to go downstairs. Kate and her husband, Ralph were already in the little dining room, along with a young couple, the woman with a baby on her lap. Cas and Dean took a table at the corner.
Jack caught up to it, too.
“Never understood what you saw in me then,” Cas said quietly and his hand squeezed around Dean’s. “I was an awkward nerd.”
“Sure,” Dean nodded. “What should we tell the kids?”
The tree was incredible. It was like a Disney movie, really. Almost the middle of a forest, a perfectly circular glade full of wild flowers with the damn oak in the center of it, sun shining through the branches. There were tall evergreens all around them.
“A bunker,” Cas looked at the metal door. “Really?”
Miracle became excited the moment Baby stopped, and when Dean let her out, she followed readily a step behind him and Cas.
“Cas, you remember what happened last time, right?” Dean reminded him. “You losing control now would be even more compromising with them right there.”
“Crowley,” Cas greeted him and he already seemed exasperated. Dean reluctantly admired him for it. Facing a demon still made every hair on his neck stand on end.
Roman’s grin sharpened.
“What happened, Charlie?” Dean asked.
Cas bit his lip and looked at them with something almost like melancholy.
Dean grinned.
The other thing was the pair of fucking
“Really?” Dean looked at him in surprise.
“You don’t know anything about this, do you?” he asked.
“Yeah.”
Dean met Sam’s confused eyes with his own. How had that come up?
“I’m not the one whose mind will be dissected tomorrow,” the hunter shot back. “What are you doing out here?”
“Yeah, I’ve got only detention for more,” Dean shrugged.
“Will you ride me?” Cas’ husky voice whispered in his ear before distracting kisses were pressed on his jawline and down his neck. Dean’s head thudded against the wall and he arched his back to get even closer, hooking a leg around Cas’ knee.
It took a moment to adjust, but then he started to grind his hips down to test the waters and Cas’ grip tightened around his waist.
“Little beaten up and tired but alright, all of us. Wish I could be home already.”
“Cassie!” the newcomer shouted in greeting as he got out of the car, a Ford in pretty good condition.
“Come,” Cas pulled him a couple steps away, to a blanket already laid on the grassy ground with a couple pillows and a thermos.
“I should be,” he sighed and Dean could feel his breath against his lips. It drove Dean crazy and before he could back down, he closed the distance between them.
“Wha–” Dean blinked but before he could’ve complained, Cas got rid of his pants and pushed his thighs wider apart, throwing one of his legs over his shoulder. He kept a palm on Dean’s straining erection, his other hand grabbing his ass. “Oh my God!”
“I know. Religion was something we never agreed on.” He hesitated for a moment. “You should probably get out of this while you can.”
“Who are you?” she asked and Dean saw her angling her hands towards her purse.
“I think we can damn well make some,” he said simply. “We’ve been here a month, five minutes don’t matter.”
“It’s friggin’ hot here,” she complained. “Why did I think it was a good idea to move to California?”
“The other option was hiding in a sex-chamber,” Dean pointed out.
Cas let out his wings, the feathers fluffing up, then turned back around.
“You haven’t found it?” Cas blinked at them. He was caught off guard, too.
The line went dead.
“You okay?” Cas studied his face with that sharp, intense gaze of his. Dean wanted to smooth out the small frown between his brows with his thumb. He only noticed now that they stopped moving, standing next to Baby and he didn’t know how they got there so quickly.
“Angel flying is faster than human perception and isn’t influenced by things like walls or ceilings, just really special warding,” Lily appeased him. “It’s more like teleport, if you want a common phrase for it.”
He kept most of his important stuff under his bed – a bit cliché, but very handy. The duffel was already packed with spare clothes, money and an untraceable laptop and phone. But the most valuable ones were kept under a floorboard in a locked iron box: fake IDs, credit cards and his beloved Colt M1911A1, nickel plated with ivory handles and engraving.
“Hey, gorgeous,” he pulled back a bit to look at Cas, who was a bit disheveled, hair a mess where Dean had grabbed onto it just now, his eyes wide, pupils blown. He was beautiful. He was always so damn beautiful. “I have something for you,” he said.
“Yes, it is,” his boyfriend answered easily.
He woke up to a killing headache, a blunt pain in his ribs and voices murmuring nearby. The smells were all foreign but for the waft of fresh air coming from the woods. The whole place smelled like werewolf but with three different people underneath, almost overwhelmed by despair and fury. Three. Fuck. And they had killed the Alpha. At least he could recognize Sam not too far from him. He was probably still out cold.
“You’re awesome, Bobby,” Dean told his mentor when they sat down, Dean right next to the door. “Sam, you okay?”
Dean let himself get pulled onto his feet and looked back down at the open hood.
“Cas, the problem wasn’t you. It was me.” Cas was fantastic. A stubborn, sassy asshole, true, but he was caring, gentle, freakishly smart and passionate about everything. He was like a ray of sunshine in Dean’s pretty cloudy existence. And he had wanted to give the Alpha everything he ever desired, a happy apple pie life with a couple kids and maybe a cat because Cas liked them. And Dean’d needed to help his father with hunting down the demon. “I couldn’t give you what you deserved, we both know that.”
“Fuck,” was all Dean could say to that.
Dean swallowed loudly, really grateful that Sam and Charlie hadn’t shared their thoughts on the matter. Sam was probably laughing himself to death right now.
Dean shook his head.
“Who told you?” Sam asked.
The weather had been chilly but sunny in Sioux Falls. Here there were clouds and wind and a couple degrees colder, especially without a jacket.
And… there. Just before Victor took a step aside he pressed the key to the cuffs in Dean’s palm. Dean had to try really hard not to grin, nodding at Cas.
“No, he hugged us and said we have to talk about something, too.”
“And I’m the one who should know that?”
“You went back to the one you stole from?” the hunter had to ask. Just to make sure he got it right.
They couldn’t just run. There wouldn’t be time to grab the kids, pile into the Impala and just vanish. No, it would only put a target on their back. But they couldn’t stay here either, because they sure had something they could use to take Cas away and –
“Training at the hospital,” Dean said. “Wants to help people and volunteering there is the easiest way to do it inconspicuously.”
“So you’re going to help?” Sam asked, carefully not mentioning the scene he’d just seen.
Cas grabbed his shoulder in a firm grip that in no way made Dean a little weak before he could’ve taken a step.
“Then maybe don’t flap us in the middle of the place, sweetheart,” Dean clapped him on the shoulder with a grin. “Watch this.”
“Dorothy will be home soon,” she smiled at them, leading them into the kitchen. “She’s got held up at work.”
It took maybe a couple minutes of comfortable silence when Cas spoke up.
Lily said that some of the angels used their endurance to hunt down monsters or demons if they hurt humans. They had the advantage over a regular hunter (like Bobby) in their instinctual knowledge of close combat and the way they could sense or even see other creatures for what they were.
Cas’ face softened into a smile, crinkles appearing in the corner of his eyes. His free hand cradled Dean’s jaw, his thumb smoothing over the stubble on his cheek and Dean leaned into the gentle touch readily which made Cas’ smile wider.
“Bela Talbot’s not that good,” Crowley spoke up. Everyone looked at him as he played with the rim of his glass. “Yeah, she’s a back-stabbing bitch but this is too elaborate for her. She only relies on herself. Wouldn’t use the government, especially the CIA.”
“Thank you,” Charlie smiled at him.
“No, we didn’t,” Cas sighed.
“And you’re an asshole,” he shot back.
They left town without running into any SUVs or Tahoes, then Cas sped up. Dean’s phone pinged with an address half an hour in, Bobby sending him their next destination. He read it to Cas, who nodded.
This weekend was promised to be a nightmare.
“Souls.”
“Sam’s alright?” he asked. His voice was hoarse from disuse. He didn’t know how long he’d been out.
“This was scary,” he tried to whisper but he didn’t really manage it. “What the fuck are they doing here?”
“Ditto,” Dean and Sam replied at the same time.
Waking up in Heaven sometimes still came as a novelty to Dean.
“Yeah, sure can,” he agreed because it was completely true.
“Someone like you?” Cas’ eyes flashed dangerously.
“Already talked to her. It’s fine. I think she just wanted to bitch about something.” He smiled a bit. “Keep the usual boundaries, don’t let anyone see you and we’ll be okay.” His husband still seemed unsure, biting at his lower lip. “Those wings are a part of you now. No need to hide them from us. Besides,” he smirked, and trailed his hand over Cas’ waist, “I really enjoy 'em, too.”
He straightened up to pull off his shirts, feeling Cas’ hungry gaze on him the whole time. When he looked back down, he needed to swallow at the sight. Cas’ face was flushed, hair even wilder than usual, pupils blown and lips bright red. His muscles were shifting restlessly under tan skin.
It took a bit of coordination they didn’t really have to clean up and get themselves into a horizontal position, curled together under the covers. Dean clung to Cas heavily, the fear from earlier quenched but not vanished. The wing that wasn’t pulled tight against Cas’ back laid over him, warmer than any blanket. It was comforting beyond belief and he wouldn’t let anyone take that away from him.
“Complicated,” Dean frowned as he plopped down on the lumpy couch, his arms resting on his knees. “And that,” he jerked his head towards the computer, “was a visit from a wet team. About two days ago.”
“You didn’t,” the prof’s gaze shot to Dean, eyes hard and unreadable. He always knew Dean too well.
“The difficult part will be finding it. I lost track of it while falling.”
“Mm, Cas…” he moaned lowly, voice hoarse from sleep.
“If you’re absolutely sure,” he said finally.
Dean risked a look at Cas and he couldn’t see much in the low light, but the guy’s jaw clenched minutely.
“It was for the greater good!” his brother protested.
“We should clean up,” he lifted a hand to cradle the hunter’s jaw with a tender touch.
“So you never met your parents, did ya?” Bobby asked.
“Roman’s the CEO of SucroCorp,” she took a sip from her wine. “It’s a shell company. He’s very well-connected.”
Sam walked straight over to the end of the bed where they kept her medical file. Cas stopped next to her. Dean stayed by the door, listening for anyone coming their way.
Dean took one hand off the wheel to grab Cas’ and squeezed it.
“You didn’t tell me they were twins,” he murmured to Dean.
“You think they would check that?” he blinked in surprise.
Turned out that Cas was a decent marksman, good in hand-to-hand combat (which Dean had already known), but was seriously deadly with a knife, which was one of the hottest things Dean had ever seen. Even Bobby was openly impressed and that didn’t happen often.
“Wow,” he whispered when the tip of his fingers touched one of the feathers at eye-level. It was maybe the length of his forearm. A shiver ran over Cas’ wings and he took a shaky breath. “Okay, babe?” Dean turned to look at him.
They just stood there for a couple moments, looking at each other and Dean’s shoulders relaxed a bit, some of the tension leaving him.
“Thank you,” he rasped out, striding decidedly towards the Impala.
Dean spent the day catching up on cleaning and paperwork, for which he had to drive over to the garage. Cas had a lot of free time with the lack of need for sleep and all and he kept up with everything without problem, but Dean liked to know what was going on in the business with their name on it.
“Balthazar,” the Alpha said and moved to get out of bed. Okay, that was just hurtful. Especially after what they’d done just a couple hours ago.
“Huh,” Dean said. They had suspected it but it was good to have solid evidence that they’re safe at the moment.
“Hey, Jack,” she greeted him shyly.
“You killed Dick because he’d threatened Claire,” Dean shrugged as he cozied up to him. “I’m pretty sure you’ll find your footing.”
“Cassie?” Jimmy let go of Dean and was by his side immediately.
“He’s a bastard,” Sam mumbled.
“She criticized
“Here’s everything we need.”
“I’m sorry we have to cut this short, Ms. Kelly,” Cas smiled back at her. “If you still have any questions, you can find me in my office at consulting hours.”
“A bit,” Dean agreed. “But why?”
“Miracle,” Dean smiled. “I like that. Come on, Miracle, come here.” Miracle snuffled forward, and let Dean rub his palm over her neck with excited panting.
“Stop fidgeting, you’re making it worse,” Cas scolded him.
“Great,” Dean leaned back in exasperation.
“I just saw the two of you together, how close he was to you and your grin and just…” he gave a defeated sigh. “I’m sorry.”
“How the hell did he know our address?” Dean huffed.
“Be careful,” Cas reached for his hand and Dean squeezed it tightly, looking into those dark blue eyes for a moment longer. He nodded at Sam and he was out of the car.
“You often seduce your students nowadays?” Dean shot back. He wouldn’t talk about this now. Cas had always disapproved of his coping method and Dean’d mostly cut down on the alcohol for his sake. The sex had been more fantastic sober, anyway. But that was over so he didn’t have a right to criticize.
The cut on Dorothy’s scalp was treated as soon as they reached the car. At least Dean felt useful while doing it, the experience of raising two accident-prone kids coming in handy.
Finding an empty hallway was child’s play, most of the people already on their way out of the building. Dean leaned against the wall.
“I looked into myths and legends about anything that could give their offspring away and specifically into human care. I found something about changelings, but those take the place of the real children, so that was a bust. Hybrids just stay with the human parents in most cases. But then I’ve found this old tale,” Sam turned the book around so everyone could see it. “According to this there’s a pair of ancient, immortal creatures whose powerful children are sent to Earth to protect humanity. They’re described as basically powerful, winged humans, who can differentiate between the righteous and the unworthy and can see the devil’s face. Their powers don’t manifest until they’re ready for it. It also mentions that they grow up as humans to learn to live with them and love them. I think they’re the same as the actual angels in the Old Testament but they’re found in every mythology in some form or another throughout thousands of years.”
There was a moment of silence.
Balthazar looked a little taken aback, an eyebrow high on his forehead.
“Somebody’s protecting him,” Bobby concluded.
The new appendages appeared with the same fanfare as last time. Dean’s breath stuck on an inhale.
“Even when you’re wrong?” Cas frowned.
“I am something else, Dean. Something that was proven dangerous. Not everyone would be comfortable with that,” Cas exclaimed.
“You did it,” Dean exhaled. “You consumed that shit.”
Cas didn’t display much Alpha-traits, never had. He wasn’t aggressive or demanding, didn’t have the urge to be the most important person in the room. Posture was not his thing and Dean knew that – he loved that. But Cas liked control, knowing what to expect. He needed leeway to do whatever he wanted. Now that Dean thought about it, it was probably a result of eons of servitude.
“I know who you are, Dean,” she tutted. “You’ll join us soon enough. I already called dibs at your rack.”
Cas drew him in for a grateful kiss, hand a grounding weight on the back of Dean’s neck.
There was a pause.
“Rowena’s really prepared,” he hummed as he pulled out a tube of lube and a condom. “There’s a gun in here, too.”
“Who are they?” Cas asked instead of answering, putting sugar into his mug and stirring it around. “
“We think Uncle Bobby could help figure things out,” Dean added. “So we’ll drive up to him. It shouldn’t take more than a couple days.”
“Me?” Dean asked incredulously. How had they come to that conclusion? He doubted Roman had told anyone about his obsession with Cas.
“Yes, of course,” Sam nodded.
“I either get it back or we both die sooner or later. Sam too, probably, just for being involved. I need to have something to defend us with.”
“Mmm, so good, Cas,” he breathed out and rose a bit before lowering himself again.
As the people left, thanks to the fire alarm, Dean with his bleeding arm didn’t raise suspicion, simply because they didn’t meet anybody. Dean found the nearest janitor closet just next to the break room, and pulled Cas in after him. He quickly grabbed a can of acetone, a big bottle of clog destroyer, some bleach and a bucket. In a minute he had a miniature time bomb.
“Dean, angels are not…” he sighed. “Couple years ago you were even afraid of hunting demons. Angels are on another level altogether. Most demons turn tails and run even just from the rumor that they are around.”
“How can you tell?” he swallowed his pride to ask.
He felt a hand on his forearm, a thumb sliding over his wrist in a calming gesture. So Cas had spotted it, too.
“I don’t know what she wants yet, so I indulge her. I plan on capturing and interrogating her soon,” he announced like it was nothing.
He went to sleep in his clothes, knowing he would wake up in four hours. It was around noon that he took a shower – the water was cold and the pressure was horrible, but it was a miracle it even worked.
He went back to his article and just relaxed for once.
, careful that his husband wouldn’t see it. Cas was really touchy about this. He’d been touchy in the last three days in general. The massage had helped, but Dean wasn’t a miracle worker.
“Yes. No,” he corrected himself quickly, glancing briefly at Cas who just raised a brow. “Shut up. You found anything?”
Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair. Not like he could just get out of this now. And if it was Cas who was in trouble, he somehow knew that Charlie would be ready to assist in any way she could.
‘That woman’ turned out to be a dark-haired, flirty Beta in a leather jacket.
“You wouldn’t sense the flying itself. It would be a bit disorienting, maybe dizzying at first. The only thing you’ll know is that you’ve been at one place and then you’re somewhere else.”
“Castiel Novak,” he twirled the pen in his hand as he looked at the screen of his computer. He was parking in a dark and empty lot in the middle of the city. There was a closed Italian restaurant on his right and a hardware store on his left, a hair salon just across him.
“Hello, Dean. Sam. We seem to have a problem.”
Huh. So her rebellious daughter turned polite and his well-mannered son got into a fight. Dean’s life was getting even weirder than it already had been.
The massive complex that was the CIA base in Langley was looming over Dean ominously as he drove the car towards the garage under the building.
“Yes, fuck, please, Cas,” he hissed wantonly as he grabbed onto the arch of a wing.
“Take care, beloved,” Cas murmured and the line went dead.
“And everyone he spoke to is either dead or a target,” Dean added.
Dean’s stomach was churning and he held tighter onto Cas’ hand.
“I remember, you went into hysterics,” his brother nodded. “You were afraid of your ‘real father’ and what he would say about your disobedience. I was the only one you felt safe around.”
“Hey, Dad,” he touched the sun-warmed stone with his fingertips in greeting. “Sorry for not coming in a while. It got a little crazy at home. Sam told you ‘bout his hunter girlfriend? She’s a badass and really great, won’t take any of Sam’s shit – you’d like her. I hope it works out for him, maybe he won’t be such a workaholic anymore.” He took a deep breath. “Turned out Cas is an angel, with wings and everything. Imagine that. It’s not a smooth sailing either, but we’re handling it, I think. I met my mother-in-law this week. She’s some big ass cosmic entity and doesn’t like me which would suck, but I think Cas got some closure on that front so we won’t see her much. He just took Claire and Jack to Bobby’s to help him, they went after a zombie by themselves, so they’re up for a little work. Oh, and Claire’s got a girlfriend. She’s a dreamwalker, so we’re full of special ones now. It could be worse.” Sadness unfurled in his chest, but the nostalgic kind that made him smile. “Wish you were here. You’d like all the madness going on. Would kick back on the couch with a beer and just find it all hilarious. Maybe you’re doing that, anyway, wherever you are. I hope Mom’s with you. Soulmates spend eternity together.”
“You just get comfortable,” Rowena told them, then turned to Dean. “Come on, dear, let me see that.”
Dean rubbed his mouth, trying to decide what to say.
“That’s a long way away,” Dean grimaced.
“What?” he asked incredulously.
“What’d he wanted for this?” he asked.
“Yes,” Cas nodded. “But I can control it.”
“You’re lying,” he downed his drink, putting the glass back on the table, slowly looking back. “You love deals. So what do you want?”
“You’re awesome,” he breathed out when he had enough brain cells working again. His hand was clean with a thought and he combed his fingers through Cas’ hair in a soothing motion. His angel hummed against his skin from where he was draped over him and smoothed his knuckles down Dean’s pectorals and back up his side.
Roman was the last to get out of the car, dressed in an elegant black suit. Another goon joined him.
He reached the upstairs landing without anything attacking him, but he saw nothing that could’ve hinted at Dorothy’s whereabouts except the couple footprints in the dust, but those could’ve belonged to anyone with boots. There were three doors he could see, but the only one closed was the one at the end of the hallway.
It was pure bliss.
“I’ve had worse,” he murmured between them. He looked down between them and licked his lips before glancing back up. He felt nervous and a bit jittery. “Are you still mad at me?” he asked with a smirk that should’ve been cocky but probably came across as apprehensive.
The bedroom was in semi-darkness, the curtains pulled in tight to keep out the sunlight. The bed had new sheets and Cas’ scented candles were put on the bedside drawers.
Dean didn’t know when he laughed that honestly the last time. Something in his chest loosened, a thing he hadn’t known was there until it disappeared.
Great, they were teaming up on him now.
“What’s going on?” the grin vanished instantly.
Cas was on the phone a couple yards away, talking to Charlie about his brother. Sam was following him with his eyes.
People were already mingling in the house when they stepped through the open front door.
So no, Dean wasn’t really surprised by his reaction to learn about his parents. The flying out had still been overdramatic, but that was just Cas.
When they more or less stumbled into the bathroom, they’d already lost their shoes, Cas’ shirt was open and Dean was trying to get rid of his own shirt without causing himself pain. Cas took a step away, already looking pretty debauched with his messed-up hair and flushed skin, his pupils blown wide. Dean was sure he looked the same.
“You’re a dumbass,” he said and couldn’t help the contentment washing over him.
“So,” Cas asked as he sat down. “What brought you here to Santa Clarita?”
” Charlie told him quietly, “
“I would kill to see him go against Jo,” Sam muttered to Dean once.
“Sammy, you know no medium can –”
“Thanks, kiddo,” Dean smiled.
“Thank you, Mr. Winchester, but I don’t think it’s necessary,” Morris waved it away. Dean took it as a good sign. “According to Mr. Roman’s calendar, he came here at least six times in the last eight months. Now, he was an influential businessman, not the kind of guy to take time out of his schedule to deal with trivial things like this, he had men for that. What do you think is the reason he was personally here every time?”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, getting under the covers.
“He was my mentor,” Dean said quietly, looking at the wall over Cas’ shoulder. “He was like an uncle or a second father. I mean, I learned a shittone of practical things from my dad, but Bobby trained me.” Him and Sam both. And yeah, anyone working for the CIA had a screwed moral compass, but Bobby had taken his time to make sure neither Winchester turned into a psychopath and had a more or less healthy coping mechanism to deal with everything. And it had been all great until Beirut. Then it kind of went to hell.
After a minute of silence Cas’ hand reached over the counter to rest over his own. It was a nice feeling.
“Well, I don’t think I’m considered human anymore,” Cas said bluntly, the wings fluttering behind him as if confirming that theory.
“Jerk,” came Sam’s reaction.
“You should give your number to Sam,” Dean smirked. “I always lose these things.”
“Then there’s no need to apologize, babe,” he shrugged. “Not like I remember any of it. Not like
“Hey, boss!” Andy yelled from the garage. “Could use a little help here!”
“Love you,” he murmured into the air between them, his unoccupied hand cradling Cas’ jaw, thumb brushing over the shadow of his stubble. The way Cas’ eyes lit up every time he heard those words was the most gorgeous thing in the universe.
“Uncle Bobby has a lot of books on obscure and mythical subjects,” Jack said, looking like he was putting it together as he spoke.
Darkness was creeping up on him and Cas’ face came into focus for a single moment, eyes determined and hurt and why would anyone hurt Cas? Cas was perfect. Even his face glowed in an ethereal light.
“Dean!” he faintly heard Charlie from the first floor and a muffled sound from somewhere on his left, but there was a crowbar straight over him, ready to bash his head in.
Dean winced, he couldn’t help it.
“This mess sounds pretty crazy to
He didn’t like the stern look Cas directed at him.
“Wow, that took longer than I expected,” came a British accent from the trap. The guy was tall with short messy blond hair, wearing an awful grey V-neck under a black jacket and a golden chain around his neck. His whole demeanor screamed pompous Alpha. “Hey, Cas.”
“I have to add, if the situation is dire enough, you’ll probably be able to materialize it into a blade such as this,” she showed them a picture of a silvery-looking, triple-edged, long dagger, the handle and the knife made of the same material. “It could be used as effectively as a touch of grace. It is also the only thing that can kill you. As you experienced, you can’t be hurt by a normal weapon. This one would do it, but as far as I know, only angels wield these.”
“You alright, chief?” he heard a gruff voice above his head and he looked up at Benny standing over him.
“This is a miracle in itself, so it seems fitting,” Claire muttered just loud enough, but she was smiling, too.
Cas stood there for a moment longer with a face that screamed aggravated. Then his shoulders loosened a bit.
“Oh fuck,” was all Dean could say. That was not a situation he wanted to barge in on.
He took the half-full bag and put it on the couch in the living room. The windowsills looking at the street were full of potted plants, healthy and green, enjoying the sunlight. Dean didn’t find much personal items, though, no photos or gifts. The fridge was half-full with both take-out boxes and healthier stuff. There was a coffee mug in the sink. Dean washed it, because he was a nice guy like that.
“Hi, Dean,” Charlie sat down across from him, her smile for the first time a bit unsure. Dorothy didn’t say a word.
His eyes met Sam’s across the table and his brother smiled at him which Dean returned easily. Even if it was just for a brief time, because life seemed to fuck them over constantly, he felt safe and happy and he hoped it would last a while. For now, he didn’t have to deal with dangerous situations but he certainly couldn’t say that his life was boring. He’d just have to carry on and see.
“I’ve got you,” Cas rumbled into his ear and changed stance to more or less drag him inside. As soon as the door was closed behind them, his palm cradled Dean’s jaw and the sliver of grace coursing through Dean’s body felt magnificent.
Cas didn’t say anything else, but after Dean finished his left wing, too, every feather in its place, soft and pliable under his hand, he lifted himself to kiss Dean again.
“Hi,” Dean greeted her with a forced smile of his own. “Sorry to interrupt, but I really need to talk to my brother. It’s kind of an emergency.”
Cas pushed them up with his wings enough to get them out from under himself and turned them over without pulling away, many years of routine making it easy to pour lube on his fingers and kissing Dean stupid at the same time.
“Dean? You have to see this.”
That was when he heard it, too, even over the music. Tires screeching outside.
So they had taken it slow. They had perfected kissing pretty quickly and with much enthusiasm, hands wandering over clothes, fingers carding through hair. Dean hadn’t spent hours on a sofa just making out since high school and he’d never done it in the middle of a friggin’ meadow between wildflowers, stretched out on a picnic blanket. It was easy to just lose himself in Cas.
“Bobby?” Dean looked at him with a grin.
Dean left them with a lazy wave to Victor and a kiss on Cas’ cheek, confident that his husband wouldn’t bust them now.
“Well, the hot lady next door said that you and your husband live here and that the dreamy one with blue eyes is Castiel, the handsome one with freckles is Dean. So you must be Dean.” She took a breath. “Everyone was saying you had a family thing and couldn’t come to the BBQ, and how sorry they all are that we can’t meet because we would surely get along. Heteronormative bullshit, if you ask me, but it made me curious.”
“See you later, guys,” Sam nodded at them and asked Charlie if she wanted to join Eileen and him for dinner at Jody and Donna’s. Dean knew the answer so he started walking towards Bobby’s house, Cas right by his side.
“Glowing,” he said with disbelief and Dean couldn’t blame him. “His blood was glowing?”
“Fine,” Cas looked conflicted. “But I’m the one knocking him out.”
“Ain’t what I was asking, but good for you.”
And fuck, they had been having sex almost daily since they were what, seventeen? So Cas knew his every tic and every spot that made him lose his damn mind and he was really putting that knowledge to good use now. No teasing, no built-up.
“Nice,” Dean gestured impatiently. “What about you and humanity? What was so great about it?”
What she talked a lot about was
,” Cas murmured against his lips, his voice reverent. “Love you, too.”
“You’re a Winchester. A pain in the ass by birth. That’s why you got only one year, isn’t it?”
“You’ve got something you wanna say?” Bobby asked indifferently.
They wouldn’t try to kill Cas, anyway. They would make him disappear, yes, but just to get any information out of him (which wasn’t much or important) or to get leverage (which would work).
“I’m not as connected to food as you are,” Cas shrugged. “But I’ll miss PB&J. And your burgers. And coffee.”
“Where’s the Impala?” Cas asked as he parked the car halfway on the sidewalk like the driver had lost control over it. Damn, the guy was adaptive.
“They’re hunters, are you sure it’s safe to keep them alive, Ainsley?” Dean could hear the worry in her voice. “If they’re dead then just more will take their place.”
He was on top when they landed diagonally across the sheets, straddling Cas’ waist and grinding his hips down without hesitation. The strangled moan leaving the Alpha’s lips was beautiful and Dean leaned down to feel it resonating in Cas’ throat with his lips. While he was there, he decided to nibble on the skin a bit.
“Fine,” she pulled back, her usual brave and indifferent face back on again. “Then hurry up, old man, I don’t have all day.”
“You’re not afraid of me.”
“Then we shouldn’t say that out loud often, right?” Dean asked with as much sarcasm as possible.
“Well, nice to see you, too,” Rowena raised her chin and went straight to the backseat.
“We don’t know,” Dean told her quietly.
“Did you know about it?” Dean arched a brow at him.
He decided on the windows looking at the corridor. The glass nicked his face even when he’d tried to protect it and he sprinted towards the door where he’d come from, clutching the stolen badge from Henriksen’s shirt in his hand tightly.
“Sam,” Dean tried to interrupt, but his brother was on a roll.
“Claire and Jack?” he responded with a question of his own, tilting his head in the way he did when he was listening to something that was out of a normal guy’s (like Dean’s) hearing range.
“Whoa,” he gasped but he was already pretty okay with flying with Husband Airline. He only got a little wrong-footed when Cas was doing it without warning, like right now.
Then Dean almost collapsed because she was followed by Cas. He was wearing the same khaki jacket, pants and boots he’d wore to Roman’s, but his jaw was shadowed by an almost-beard instead of stubble and the bags under his eyes were prominent even from a distance. He was putting his weight on his left leg – the right one probably still not healed –, his hands cuffed in front of him and he just generally seemed like he’d had a rough week.
“What?” he asked faintly.
“I like your logic, babe,” he told his husband, “but I was thinking more about damage control.”
“The boy she brought back was her boyfriend, Vince. He’s been missing for over a year now,” her girlfriend added. That was horrible. Also, Dean was just glad his kids were safe at home. “Back to the main topic, sorry we made you think we would hurt the angel if we knew who it was. That was poor wording on our part.”
“When was the first time Mr. Roman came here?” Valente asked.
“Remember when Claire shoplifted?”
Parking on the side of the road in front of Sam’s apartment complex was easy.
“What’d ya find?” Dean sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
Cas stood there a moment longer, then he let out a slow breath and his shoulders slumped.
“The truth? That would go down well. ‘Hey, your parents just killed an important and rich man, got rid of his body and now we’re going to Uncle Bobby to see why your dad has fucking wings.’ Fantastic.” Dean saw Cas sharp, reprimanding look in the rearview mirror and flinched. “Dear,” he added. Sam snickered.
“That way,” Gabe nodded in the other direction. “My friend, Janice, lives just down there and she has a modified panic room – it’s more like a sex chamber, actually. I wait until this dies down then I go off the grid.”
“It’s been a real blast,” Dean leaned against the kitchen counter. He knew they were tracing him. He prayed that Charlie was doing her thing because this wouldn’t work otherwise. “But here’s the thing, Victor. For fifteen years I was one of the best – I’m sure you know at least that from my file.” The rest was probably crossed out in black. “My whole family was in the business, generations. It was all I knew. But I didn’t retire so soon because of the killing or the stress or the bad pay.”
“Thanks, sweetheart,” Dean rolled his eyes, but took his hand.
“They should be back in a couple hours,” Lily finished and the line went dead.
“I didn’t order the killings,” she told him. “It was Roman. Why do you think he’s still alive?”
“How do you want to do this?” Cas panted above him, his hips making these little twitchy movements that were driving Dean insane. He grabbed Cas’ waist to still him so he could focus on thinking about the question. Cas looked really good on top of him and Dean could imagine him riding Dean with abandon. It was an awesome picture in his mind.
Bobby huffed, probably insulted that Dean doubted his sources but this was about Cas and he wasn’t going to take chances.
“Y-yeah, I think so.” Now the frown seemed more thoughtful. He pushed himself up, hands on his lap. “It’s gone.”
“Yes!” he blurted out despite the fact that his body was really on board with the idea. He sat up and took Cas’ hands in his, mostly to stop them from wandering but for some connection, too. “What’s gotten into you?”
He turned to Cas fully, closing the distance between them in one step, cupping his face in both hands. The angel’s breath, which he didn’t even need, hitched and Dean should’ve done this a long time ago just to see this reaction.
“We’re going to shower, then we’re continuing this in a bed,” Cas told him, his voice full of promise.
“Maybe,” he admitted with a full mouth. “Can’t I be interested in it?”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded. The only one who would know for sure why the CIA did something was the CIA itself. They had to go to Langley.
“Yep,” Dean stepped out of the car. He walked down the couple steps to the door with Cas at his back and he was way more comfortable with that than he’d been just a couple days ago. He banged on the steel as hard as he could, then waited. “Okay, keep your voice down, don’t make any sudden moves and just generally stay close to me.”
“Where’s Cas?” Dean asked even though he knew the answer.
“I’ll pass,” Sam spoke up, arms crossed like a sulking child’s. “He likes you better anyway.”
“True,” he admitted. “Thank you, Dean.”
They ate quietly for about five minutes before Dean broke. Come on, the man he’d been pining over was sitting right there, was he supposed to not push it?
Cas called exactly on the seventh evening.
“Why?”
There was a deafening gunshot and the girl’s eyes widened like saucers before she went down like her strings got cut, blood slowly oozing from the hole in her chest. The blade clattered to the floor. Before the male could even do more than turn around, it happened to him, too.
Dean ordered two beers because he still had to drive back and the road to the house was a bitch – and anyway, Cas was back on his mission on making him drink less and it was still working. They didn’t do much more than talk, nothing they hadn’t done back at the cabin but the change of scenery was good for Dean. He liked the background noise and the people around himself. He still had Cas’ undivided attention and he gave the Alpha his.
“Mine door, you mean,” Cas added.
“Where’s Cas?” he asked.
“We’ll see.”
“Maybe.” He leaned in close, whispering, “Cas, you scared me. Please, let me take you home.”
Dean sighed and rolled his eyes.
There was the telltale flutter of wings Dean hadn’t heard in years but was never able to really forget.
“Dude, she’s your daughter. You can worry, sure, just don’t lock her in a cage.”
“I’ll call Charlie,” Dean shot upright to grab his phone.
They had stopped for breakfast in Iowa. By that time Cas’ coat, suit jacket and tie was in the backseat, the sleeves of his shirt rolled up to his elbows, the top two buttons open. It had been a very distracting sight and Dean had had to force himself to look at the road straight ahead, especially after Cas had fallen asleep around one a.m. to the low hum of the radio.
“Fuck you,” Dean grumbled and threw them at him.
“Claire said something she probably didn’t mean to. Kaia connected the dots but she only arrived after us.”
Dean’d never thought he would actually need the skill in real life beside letting out steam, but here he was, going against something supernatural.
Five minutes later, with Cas behind the wheel, they had the base’s gates behind them.
Dean heard his name and had to take a deep breath.
“I know.”
Okay, okay. Shit. Bobby was hurt. Cas was captured. Henriksen would want him alive, Dean was sure of that. And it was not like it had been just two weeks ago, when Cas had barely known anything. He now was in possession of some intimate information, which, Dean knew, he would refuse to disclose.
“It’s so good to see you,” Balthazar seemed genuine about it. He behaved more human than Anna and Uriel, that was for sure. “Even in your current… condition. But that can be easily corrected.”
“We could go public,” Dean suggested but even he didn’t believe that would work.
“And?”
The dinner and the beer vanished quickly but Dean still felt the gnawing pit in his stomach and he was sure it wouldn’t disappear until he and Cas were safe at home.
“I love you,” Cas murmured into his neck, nuzzling into the skin there. He sounded content and sated.
“This is it, right?” Dean asked with a knot in his stomach. He really didn’t like this.
They piled into a booth at the back, Dean on one side and the girls on the other. They waited until they got their coffees and a small bowl of peanuts before Charlie launched into it.
“That shit,” Cas leveled him with a glare, “saved your life, Dean. You were dying before my eyes and your blood was everywhere and –” The lights flickered briefly on the ceiling as his hands curled into fists, scent betraying how upset the image made him. “I couldn’t let you die.”
“Guatemala?” Ash’s eyes went a little glassy as he went through the ops in his head. “Yeah, I think I can help you.”
The way Cas’ trembled just from the lightest touch on the inside of his wings had been like a revelation to Dean. Also had been getting fucked against nothing, trusting Cas to hold him in thin air. God, his husband was so
Sam snorted.
They didn’t talk after that, and Dean followed Cas with his eyes as the Alpha walked back to his room a while later.
“I know it’s not safe for you, whatever they say, so I’m going.” Dean looked at the clock. He should go soon, if he wanted to be there before them.
“Well… I’m sure we can negotiate something,” she threw her hair over her shoulder, leaning back into the leather seat.
“Probably one of my angelic capabilities,” Cas shrugged. “I should ask Lily about it.”
Cas’ hips thrust against him, already hard in his jeans and Dean tried to get enough space between them to get to the buttons of Cas’ shirt and the same time not wanting to let him pull away at all.
“Waterproof?” he asked as he looked closer. He seemed to already know the answer but Dean gave him a nod nonetheless. Then he was distracted again when Cas deftly undid his belt the same time he went in for a kiss.
Dean cleared his throat.
“Tomorrow?” Cas asked in disbelief.
“Wait a minute,” Sam interrupted. “I don’t understand. Angels can just become human?”
Cas got rid of his tie as soon as the door closed behind them, halfway to the shower already. Dean grabbed him with his good arm and turned him around to kiss him again. Cas gasped into his mouth, kissing back immediately, deeper and with more force that Dean kept up with readily. He was pretty sure that he could kiss Cas for a long time, just letting their hands slowly wander and it would take hours before they went any further. Well, next time, maybe, because he’d wanted this for months and he had to get the edge off before he could get himself to really relax into it. Maybe tomorrow. He had every intention to ravish Cas right now.
When Dean sat behind the wheel, with a flap of wings Cas was by his side. The Omega jumped.
“Whoa,” Dean whispered and Cas smiled at him, the nose-crunching one he loved so much. “What was that for?”
,” Cas pointed out. “They’ll know something’s up as soon as we tell them we’re leaving. We worked really hard on the trust they put in us and I won’t risk that.”
Claire and Jack had been another matter. The boy’s main problem had been if now Cas had to leave them for Heaven, but he’d been ready to roll with everything with a smile after they explained that nobody was going anywhere. Claire had taken everything in stride (her only reaction to Cas’ wings were “This is so cool and gay at the same time!”) and instantly declared war on anyone who wanted to hurt her father. Dean really hoped she wasn’t gonna run into a random Man of Letters on the street because beating up someone without seemingly good reason wouldn’t go down well.
“Fine,” he agreed grudgingly.
“You submitted, though,” Sam pointed out. “How long were you with him?”
“Fuck,” he hissed.
Cas’ face darkened.
Dean’s stomach twisted into a knot. Cas said it with such tenderness it was sickening.
The hike back to the entrance of the park was long as Charlie told Dorothy their part of the story. The hunter wasn’t happy with her involving a civilian but couldn’t argue with her bringing the closest she’d found to reinforcement.
“Sam. Dean.” Cas nodded slightly at them and moved farther into the room, weapon still at the ready.
That was exactly what Dean was waiting for.
The Winchesters probably looked out of place in their suits when they walked inside, the main area dark with flashing lights and platforms in the four corners of the room and the catwalk right in the middle. The bar was open with a lone bartender drying off glasses and a couple dancers practicing their routines. The music wasn’t loud but Dean recognized Cherry Pie without problem.
Cas was almost constantly growling, a low sound from deep in his chest that made something in Dean preen with pride. He let go of their erections to steady himself on the mattress, sucking a hickey on Dean’s collarbone with clear excitement.
“Dude, you look more relaxed than I’ve seen you in weeks. And thank God for that. You keep up this last week’s attitude for long, I go all Diane Kruger on you.”
The brothers retreated a couple steps. Cas stood there, back straight, completely unmoving, looking down at the body. And then looking a little more. Dean was about to ask him if he was alright but then Roman burst into flames.
don’t know your car. Who are
“I can’t stop the bleeding,” he heard Cas’ voice coming closer and then he appeared, letting the fireman on his heels taking the lead when he saw Dean.
“Whoa,” he heard Sam.
“Eat,” he put the milk and cereal in front of Dean as soon as he sat down, completing it with a mug full of hot coffee.
The hit shouldn’t have been a surprise, but before he could even look around, he found himself on the ground with all the air leaving his lungs with a pained huff.
It was a really old building, a two-story wooden farmhouse almost half-collapsed on itself, most of the boards in the porch missing, the roof caved in on one place, the probably originally white paint dirty enough to look an ugly brownish gray. It was probably a century old. There was no vehicle or any hiking trail within sight.
“Okay, stop. Tell us what happened,” Dean looked down at Jack, resting a protective hand on his shoulder.
“Catch,” he heard Cas’ voice and he had just enough time to turn around and snag the shiny object from the air the Alpha had thrown at him. Sam was treated to the same move. The object was a silver pen.
“Of course,” Dean agreed hurriedly, putting the card in his jacket pocket. Now that he had it, he wanted to get out really fast. They’d spent too much time here already.
“Yeah, that’s the problem,” Cas rolled his eyes at him.
All hope that he wasn’t an ass went out the window.
“What are you talking about?” he asked as Cas emptied the pan in the bin.
“I have just the place,” Bobby started striding towards the stairs into the basement, expecting everyone to follow.
The monster collapsed like a sack of potatoes, right on Charlie who threw the corpse off with a grunt. Dean just stood there, looking at it, trying to understand what he’d done.
He reached the top of Cas’ pants after spending some time on his tattoo, beautiful hipbones peeking out and damn, had he missed them. He sucked a bruise on one, hands fitted perfectly on the Alpha’s lower back, fingers dipping under the waistband. The fist in his hair tightened, not enough to hurt, just to send a thrill down his spine.
He should’ve talked to Cas about this instead of tossing down half a bottle of bourbon. The last time he’d decided to drink his problems away had been that time when Cas had started hanging out with Meg Masters who’d worked at the coffee shop near campus. She’d been pretty and full of snark and Dean had been so irrationally jealous, sure that he would lose Cas sooner or later. When the bar Dean’d chose to drown his sorrows in had called Cas at three a.m. to take him home, his then-boyfriend hadn’t been happy with him. So he’d sat them down as soon as Dean had finished throwing up in the morning and had made them talk. It hadn’t been easy, admitting his fears out loud. But it had helped, hearing Cas’ reassurances about hanging out with Meg because they had similar backgrounds and that yes, he liked her but why would Dean think it was anything compared to his feelings for him? Also, Cas’ embarrassed confession about asking her opinion on proposing had been convincing enough – which he had done a couple weeks later. They’d always talked through things since then and it
Cas rolled his eyes at him, but otherwise stayed completely calm.
He couldn’t
“But why? You never have any problem with flirting or –”
“It’s in Tennessee, near Crossville,” Sam shrugged helplessly.
“I’d like a French toast and just a glass of water, please,” Cas said.
“I just arrived,” she grinned. “Man, I haven’t see you in years. You look good.”
“You’re grounding us?” Jack asked with wide eyes.
It was now early afternoon and Dean was cranky, tired and hungry.
ex, the big
“I may have… told them it was for an ongoing case,” he looked away from them in embarrassment.
He only had enough presence of mind to pull the blade out, the body bleeding out on the ground before he had to turn away or risk throwing up on it. That would’ve been ugly.
” Charlie told them, her voice full of worry.
“Gonna make a couple calls,” he put those aside and picked up the old-fashioned phone from his desk.
“You really know how to show a guy a good time, Dean,” Sam spoke up for the first time, his voice teasing.
“Oh my God, guys!” Sam complained, his apprehension seemingly forgotten.
“Go,” he said, nudging Dean towards the stairs.
Bela took her chance and positioned herself behind the agent’s back for protection, not saying a word. If anything, she was a smart woman.
“A Men of Letters unit is half an hour out,” Charlie put away her phone. “We should wait for them.”
Cas’ eyes finally shifted away, to the sofa.
He started moving with an easy, languid rhythm, pulling out moans from both of them. Dean pretty much lost himself in the feeling of being full and having Cas pliant and aroused inside him, his wings curling around Dean, the silky touch making his breath stutter.
It was a two-minute walk to the First Christian Church. It was mostly empty, just an old woman praying in the front. The priest was nowhere to be seen.
“Cas Cas Cas!” he yelled, and he had to blink rapidly to clear his vision and scrape together something that was resembling thoughts. “Cas,
The agents didn’t question the car. They opened the back door and pushed Bela in.
“And give Bobby a kiss for me.”
They just stood there for minutes, making out without it leading anywhere. The press and pull of their mouths made goosebumps appear all over Dean’s skin and Cas actually shuddered with his whole body when Dean did that thing with his tongue that always made him moan.
Dean’s gaze met Sam’s. That wasn’t what they'd been expecting.
Dean just huffed and put his phone away.
Dean pulled back from his lips and decided to take charge – Cas seemed to be in the mood for it and who was he to argue. So he took a steadying breath and pushed Cas back onto the mattress. He quickly got rid of his own top and slid down a little to start working on Cas’ jeans. Cas lifted his hips just enough to help him get them off of him, looking on with blown pupils and a flush spreading all the way down his neck. While Dean was standing, he pulled off his own pants and boxers then rummaged through the duffel and fished out the lube stashed in one of the pockets.
Cas’ breath hitched, but then he grabbed Dean’s wrist and entwined their fingers.
Dean was okay, for the most part, utterly and completely drained, mostly emotionally, but alright. He felt a little bit of life returning to him when they turned into their street and then Charlie stopped the engine in front of her and Dorothy’s garage.
“I don’t plan on getting shot,” the other man frowned. “But you take care of yourself… and that beau of yours, since you dragged them into this.”
“Fuck! Cas, what the hell –”
He grabbed his bag and the gun from the floor and stormed past Dean who was looking at the scene for a little longer before hurrying after him.
“I want to know what the hell that was all about!” Bela screamed, just a hairsbreadth from freaking out.
A moment of silence.
Claire sat up straighter immediately, her gaze sharpening even more. Dean exchanged a helpless look with Cas who just shrugged and nodded.
The Continental was still parking next to Baby but Jimmy’s Ford was gone which he had expected. The porch and the yard was empty of any humans (or ex-angels, for that matter), but he had an inkling where he should go.
“Of course,” he said easily, eyes bright and blue.
“Rowena,” Bobby greeted her gruffly.
“No,” the Alpha shrugged. “But we need to confirm that they have my grace. And if it’s who I think it is, maybe they will hesitate to kill me. Not for long, just enough to buy us some time.” He glanced up at Dean, his eyes softening somewhat. “You and Sam really wanna be here for this? If something goes wrong…”
“Man, I only looked up your address last night,” Dean protested. “I wanna stalk someone, I would know everything within hours. I didn’t even know what you looked like until you stepped in the door.”
“Good,” Cas smiled.
“Did you apprehend the necromancer?” Cas asked, tension in his voice. “I don’t want her near Claire and Jack again.”
“I might need a vehicle to find him then. This case cannot wait,” he nodded at Sam and Dean at his back who were trying to be as imposing as possible in their fitted suits they had decided to wear. Lucky for Dean, the Bunker still had most of his stuff from his active days.
Dean was just walking into the office, ready for his lunch break after working all morning, when he spotted Cas at his desk. That wasn’t strange, that was where Cas usually was, but his hair was the kind of messy where someone (meaning him or Dean) had his hands in it, talking on his cell with a heavy frown.
“What? Dean, no –” his Alpha started to protest but he didn’t let it go further.
“Sweetie, it’s clear as day you like this lad,” her smirk was still there but her eyes softened. She was fonder of Sam, yes, but she and Dean had a history, too (and he hadn’t kept her in a basement for weeks like his brother). And yeah, maybe Dean actually wanted to talk about it.
“I’m gonna find out where you worked sooner or later,” Cas huffed a little laugh.
Cas caught his eyes and gave him a crooked smile before stepping up to him to help him out of the damn t-shirt, careful with his forearm. His gaze stopped on the bandage.
“He’s the one still alive,” Bobby nodded in understanding.
Before the conversation could’ve really started, Cas burst out the door, sans Gertie, panic clearly written on his face. Dean’s heart thudded in fear and met him halfway.
“How many times have you told Eileen she wasn’t right?” he asked with honest curiosity.
Sex was something they’d worked on – a lot. Dean had been pretty sure that getting into each other’s pants immediately would end catastrophically and he still stood by that. His lack of knowledge in being with a man was just the lesser problem – not interest, that had been there, his carefully deleted browser history would’ve been enough evidence of that. No, the problem was that it was Cas. And Cas was important and this was the afterlife and Dean had never known and loved anyone for over a decade before bedding them so he really hadn’t wanted to mess it up. Or what if they didn’t work in bed? That would’ve been a tragedy after all that pining.
Cas had maybe five hours of sleep in him so he took a trip to the Casey’s on the other side of the road and came back with pizza and coke. While they waited, the brothers took showers and tended to their wounds which were mostly superficial and Sam didn’t seem to have a concussion, either, which was a small miracle, really.
“Dad!” Jack called out again. “Help me, please!”
“Sammy, where the hell did you put my knife?” Dean shouted through the yard.
Crowley smirked.
“What are you gonna eat?” Dean asked with sudden dread. Cas didn’t eat now, but not ordering anything would be rude and suspicious.
“Hey, Dean,” Charlie stepped up to him and hugged him tightly around the waist. Dean’s shoulder twitched in pain as he hugged her back. “Thank you,” she murmured into his chest.
“Out and proud lesbian,” Charlie grinned. “My girlfriend, Dorothy and I are trying out this whole white picket fence thing.”
“I loved watching you boys playing the good guys, kicking ass for the country,” Dick said after a displeased look in her direction. “It showed a spectacular lack of vision.”
“Faster than fourteen fold of the speed of sound.”
“It’s –” Cas licked his lips nervously. Dean put a hand on his shoulder to calm him a bit. “It’s about the biblical apocalypse. The appearance of the four horsemen.”
Cas’ left eye ticked before it narrowed until it was almost completely closed.
“There was a war,” Cas nodded. “Michael, the Prince of Heaven, the first archangel cast him down, sealed him away. He’s been in a cage in the nethermost depth of Hell for the last five thousand years.”
“Can we go?” Cas asked tiredly.
… Dean’s kink list had grown with at least a dozen brand new things.
“I liked Meg,” Cas protested.
“The devil,” Dean deadpanned.
“What?” Dean scoffed.
Rowena and Bobby looked after him with puzzled expressions.
“Come in,” was all he said, displeasure pouring off him.
“Yeah, there’s not,” Dean reassured him. “Not at all. But it doesn’t tire you out like it's done before. And your emotions are just piling up and you’ll gonna kill someone else because they bumped into you at the vegetables isle.”
Dean mulled it over for a couple seconds. Yes, this would be a leap of faith in not just Cas himself but in his general judgement. His phone was untraceable, yes, and his friend was probably a hacker of some kind, but that didn’t mean much nowadays. One mistake and this whole thing would blow up in their faces.
Cas obeyed easily and laid out on the bed, stretching before resting his head on his arms. His feathers fluffed up before flattening out. They were pulled in halfway, most of them falling comfortably onto the carpeted floor.
“So start talking, Dean!” Cas snapped.
“What the hell?” he whispered, straightening up from his slumping position as he rubbed at his eyes. He hadn’t slept this long in anyone’s presence in a long time. Somehow his subconscious hadn’t rated Cas’ presence as a threat – more than that, it apparently considered it safe. Which, yeah, he was soft for the guy, but that it was enough to silence his instincts was not something he’d expected.
“From now on you’re the one cleaning,” was all Dean could say.
Oh. Well, that explained why Sam wasn’t really welcoming.
“That’s all I can tell you now anyway, but if you have any questions, you have my number.” Lily stood up with a smile, Dean and Cas following.
He knew he was gaping openly, but he couldn’t help it. There was no touch of humanity in sight, just he and Cas and the infinite water.
But who knows? Cas was always too good a person.
“Yep,” he nodded. “You can call if something comes up.”
“You had enough time to smooch so we’re back!” Charlie announced as she stepped into the room, bringing a six-pack and Sam followed him with the plates. They sat down around the table and started handing them out. “Now, tell me, do we have another case like this in the near future? I’m ready to be on the field.”
“But it’s a gift and you’ll be surprised when you see her.” Dean pulled up the zipper and went over to pull Cas closer to him by the waist. “It’s my anniversary present so don’t spoil it.”
Dorothy was bound on the other side of the room, a ratty cloth in her mouth, blood on her face, eyes wide as they met Dean’s. There was no trace of Jack.
“You have a better idea?” Dean sighed. “He would have everything we need to know.”
The room was only filled with the sounds of their heaving breaths and the quiet rocking of the bed. Dean couldn’t even curse properly, his groans swallowed by Cas’ bitten-off grunts.
The demons stopped their attacks. Two of them immediately left their vessels, black smoke swirling and disappearing into the sky but the last one was too slow. Cas grabbed the bloody blade and threw it. It hit its target in his neck, coming out on the other side. There were the flashes again, a pathetic gurgling sound and then silence.
“Hey,” Bess smiled at them brightly and Gertie got off her orbit to run into Cas’ arms who picked her up reflexively.
He clearly remembered that when they had first started dating Cas had never bitched about Dean winking at a pretty waitress or bending a little too low on the pool table when he’d tried to hustle someone. He had always looked on with something like faint amusement dancing in his eyes and sipping his beer and waiting for Dean to saunter back to him and kiss him senseless. He had known that it hadn’t meant anything.
“They’re names,” Dean muttered mostly to himself. He’d seen enough hit list in his life to recognize one.
“I want to do this,” he said with confidence.
“Okay,” Cas squinted at them.
“We’re going dark,” Dean said just as the doors opened and they stepped in. He gave the code and Cas handed over the modified glasses he’d been wearing for the eye-scan. It was a bit riskier than a contact lens but harder to lost and easier to put on. That it made Cas look amazing, making the blue of his eyes all the more obvious, was just something Dean had noticed.
“Somehow he reached Monte Carlo,” Cas sighed in exasperation. “If the CIA doesn’t kill him, Michael will.” He glanced at Dean. “Sorry I stayed outside, I’ll be back in a minute.”
“You wanna travel?” he asked.
“I love you, too,” he smiled brightly and it was the most awesome thing ever.
“Then we shouldn’t do this in the first place,” Cas shot him a bitter glare.
“The fuck goes on in your family?” Charlie wondered aloud. Dean had asked himself that question a couple times by now. “Right, what if we handle the zombie and the necromancer? You can take Jack and Claire home. And we can still meet up later.”
Sam had taken the news like the excited puppy he was, bombarding them with questions and actually taking notes, the nerd. The week had been littered with random phone calls from him every time he had another question, even if they hadn’t known the answer. Dean hadn’t been nice when his cell had started ringing at two a.m. but fortunately Cas had taken it from him before he could’ve said something really insulting. (Bobby probably hadn’t fared better, as he was the expert in the family and a mostly retired hunter of the supernatural on the side.)
Some of the tension
“Now that’s a company I didn’t expect to meet,” came a voice from the middle of the trap. A middle-aged man in a nice suit and long black coat was looking at them with a raised eyebrow. Dean’s hand itched for the Colt even if its cylinder was frustratingly empty. Bobby still couldn’t find out how to make bullets for it. “Feathers and the Hardy boys.”
Cas sighed and probably the only thing keeping him from rolling his eyes was Dean’s ire. The bastard.
“I love you, Cas,” he breathed out, the words rolling off his tongue. No choke-ups, no stuttering. Easy, natural.
“You scouted out the forest,” the guy, Ainsley barked at her sharply. “You picked up any other scents or footprints? Hmm?”
“Gabe’s okay?” Dean asked as he stopped next to him.
“Dads!” Claire and Jack ran up to them. Damn, Dean was too old for this.
“You alright, beloved?” Cas pulled back a bit, voice concerned. When Dean took stock and it felt like every organ and limb was still in place, he nodded mutely. “Then maybe you’d like to open your eyes?”
“Yeah, this helps,” Dean pointed out. They didn’t have time for small talk, not with the cameras trained on them like that. And a big part of Dean’s daily tolerance for social interaction had already been used up by the assistant.
“No problem, man,” he smiled. “Greetings to the fam.”
“Come in. I don’t stay in the open.” He gestured at Baby. “You know where the garage is.”
Getting in didn’t cause any problems. The front door had two locks but it didn’t take two minutes for him to get in. He wouldn’t leave this place without Cas, one way or another. Why had he had to get attached, damn it.
As Dean started the engine Cas was already dialing. Dean heard the second ring before it was answered.
“You do this often?” Sam came to the same conclusion.
They rolled into Sioux Falls not twelve hours later.
“You never even considered the option?” Morris asked.
“Nerds yourselves, then?” she asked as she put the six-pack on the kitchen island. “Already my favorite people around here.”
The next morning they went straight to Linda Tran’s office, dressed in button-ups and jeans (plus Cas in his dorky trench coat), coffee cups still in hand – turned out Cas was adorably grumpy without his caffeine. The over-eager assistant at the desk was charmed by Dean immediately and absolutely believed that they were with the police without asking for ID’s. They were showed to an office on the third floor and she left them in the otherwise empty hallway after some serious and frankly uncomfortable flirting. Yep, Dean still got it.
Dean joined him and straddled Cas’ hips. He leaned down to press his lips to Cas’ skin just between the base of the wings and his husband hummed lightly, eyes falling shut. Dean straightened again and reached for the massage oil on his nightstand.
“The series is about urban legends, right? What’s your guess, what is it?”
“And you sure he’s not in on it?”
“Yes. I visited Bobby to consult about it. He thinks it’s demons and I’m inclined to agree.”
“We start easy,” Bobby picked up a salt shaker. “Hold out your hand.” Cas obeyed and Bobby let the grains hit skin. Nothing happened. “Salt has a purifying effect. Works on ghosts and demons.”
“Wow. Sassy,” Dean laughed, probably looking as smitten as he felt.
Bobby was already waiting for them. They told him everything they’d known so far and the Beta didn’t even twitch a brow. No, instead he and Cas bonded over a book the Alpha had spotted as soon as he stepped into the study. It was as good a pastime as any while they waited for Jimmy and the psychic chic.
“So you called them and they just told you everything?” Jack frowned, hands clasped together on top of the table.
“Castiel goes free,” Dean said simply.
“You were worried?” the Omega repeated. “Why? I’m not your problem to deal with.”
There were a couple moments of silence, both Claire and Jack’s eyes jumping from one parent to the other.
“Kill the Winchesters,” she hissed at her companions. “The angel’s mine.”
“I love you,” Dean murmured into Cas’ sweaty neck when he felt like he could breathe again.
“Yeah, except they saw us,” Dean stopped next to them.
“Okay. Let’s go. But if he slams the door in our faces, I’m keeping rights for saying I told you so.”
“Don’t you dare stop!” Bela ordered from the backseat. “You keep going or I’ll kill you.”
” Charlie said, already sounding distracted. “
They arrived at the park’s parking lot maybe half an hour later. There weren’t many cars, the day being a Tuesday, but Dorothy’s red bike was there, the chrome glinting in the sunlight.
“Copy that,” Dean said as he parked the car in front of a rustic, but clearly well-protected house. At least it was clear for Dean, but probably not for the untrained eye.
“Sure we will,” Dean started Baby. “Every day around eight. You should be done with your homework by then but before going to bed at ten.”
“I guessed as much,” Dean nodded, letting the wing back down to the floor carefully. The other was already in the air, eagerly waiting. Dean chuckled.
With his guardian angel and future mate in the passenger seat he cracked up the radio and pulled out onto the street.
Cas didn’t seem calmer at that reasoning.
“Those big blue eyes of yours will probably help,” Dean sighed. “I just hope we can get this over with soon. Waiting for the FBI to turn up on your doorstep is stressful.”
“You let me win, didn’t you?” he murmured when he found the ability to form coherent words.
“I think I can do it. Burn all of him, I mean,” Cas stood up. He seemed to be back mostly to himself and Dean was infinitely grateful for that practical side showing up again.
The rest of the night was spent in an awfully familiar way, the conversation flowing easily between the four of them. (Dean sent a text to Claire and Jack so as not to worry them longer than necessary.) The only difference from previous get-togethers were that now they spoke without any important secrets between them and Dean could finally truly relax in their company. It was easily one of the best night-outs he’d had in a while.
They were a mile or two out when Bobby and Cas finally looked up from Dean’s wound in frustration.
“I was a student under Alistair for over a year,” he told Roman as he pulled out the wrapped-up tools, watching as the smug smirk vanished from Dick’s face. Everybody who had heard of Alistair reacted the same.
He’d been hung up on the professor since he had met him in the lecture hall with his father next to him. He was slightly awkward around people but always polite and sharp-minded. He’d looked at the two Winchesters and known instantly what they were. It hadn’t hurt that he was seriously gorgeous. Dean’d fallen for him like the dude was the Grand Canyon and Dean a drunk tourist. And when he’d realized that he’d fled like the coward he was.
