His eyes were closed, his face strained, his head thrown back against the pillow. It looked painful, nearly, but I understood it: it was years and years of desire and want culminating in this moment, in this shared movement, coming together like this, pressed together in our most intimate of places. A mark revealed itself on the side of his neck, a mark my mouth had created. I could feel his heart pounding in his chest and felt my own match it beat for beat.
fervour. It was as such that we spent several minutes, before I was beginning to become so heated I felt sweat form at the back of my neck; moments later his fingers brushed through it on his way into the back of my shirt, at the same time that his sharp hips found mine, and I broke the kiss.
The music was intense, just how Holmes liked it, I think, and I travelled the ambient journey with him by his side, as I always ought to be. This time, however, was even more intimate, and not only because we remained touching some way or another the entire time. It was also because of our closeness, the fact that I was so close to Holmes I could smell him, the fact that I could feel and hear his breath, his steady (if a bit heightened) pulse, and the fact that such closeness brought to mind our nocturnal activities once again. I chastised myself for a brief moment: I was obsessing now on the carnal. I had to remember that there was a chance such an encounter would not happen again, or any time soon, at the very least. I forced myself to remember this, until Holmes himself reversed this notion of doubt.
Watson and I had been sharing rooms  -- and I mean beds, too -- for years, and it seemed with each year, I only grow more enamoured by him. It would be preposterous to say my love never faltered: I myself faltered at times, even I must admit, to which Watson himself can attest. My love for him felt, and still feels, like my veins themselves, constantly flowing, constantly pulsing throughout my entire body. He is in every part of me, in every molecule of my being; I have grown so accustomed to this that to lose his love would be a loss inconceivable. Through such grief I would surely cease to exist altogether.
I was making my way to my luggage, abandoned still in the entryway, to fetch my shaving materials when Holmes emerged from the other room. He was a bit red in the face but was otherwise dressed as I had often seen him, albeit in more loosely fitted clothes and without his long coat. I thought better than to ask after it, or to comment on his reddened face, and decided to offer my arm wordlessly. He smiled, the movement not reaching his eyes in the way it had multiple times earlier, and he made no comment on my own appearance. I was not sure he would feel comfortable telling me if I were indeed not dressed as I should be, but I knew better than to ask, to save ourselves an awkward moment. I realised then that perhaps I was too concerned; my feelings, suddenly brought forth from the aether into which I had lain them, were blinding my good sense. Realising this, I tucked it all away and focussed on Holmes before me, alive once more.
I nodded vaguely and looked at him; he was hopeful; I could see hope in his eyes, along with timidity and an interesting sort of shyness. I shook my head. Holmes had brought me here; what sort of joy could seeing such a place bring him?
With just the tip of my cockstand inside, I groaned and Holmes bit his lip, his hand leaving bruises on my hip. I pressed slowly forward, in and in and
I hummed and released his nipple, looking up at him. He pulled me up to his face; I kissed him and licked into his mouth, leaving my hand over his breast.
and hoped his Holmesian mind would translate and reply in a timely manner. I had an idea what he would suggest but prayed it would not come to any kind of separation between Holmes and me. We had only just been reunited; I was not sure my heart could take any further strain, and strain it would if I were to part with Holmes ever again.
I knew the answer without him having to say anything. I knew the act he was putting on, masking his pain for my benefit, and, startled, I sat up and put my hand where his was, on his ribs.
I thanked him again and exited the room and the club as quickly as my legs could muster, my head still spinning. Holmes was, as promised, sitting on the bench across the street, and did not look up at me when I walked over to him. His eyes did, however, follow the envelope in my hand. I handed it to him.
‘I do not wish to know any details of the… involvement of the pair of you,’ he said clearly but quietly, holding my gaze and standing just a bit too close. ‘I can only trust that you both are capable and will not bring about your own destruction because of … passionate … carelessness.’
I lay on my right side, facing the wall, with Holmes in front of me in the same position. My right arm was somewhat above our heads, on the pillow, his under him. I pressed my face into the back of Holmes’s neck and let out a bone-deep exhale. In front of me, Holmes hummed and pulled my left around around him and slid himself back so that we were pressed together chest to knocking knees. I shuddered and splayed my left hand low on his stomach and kissed the back of his neck. In that sad excuse for a bed, with Holmes pressed against the front of me, our chests rising and falling together, I felt I was finally home. Within moments, I was asleep.
This is purely smut — those disinclined to read it may skip, but the last note at the bottom may be of interest.
I felt that the air between us had cleared, it seemed, and I knew surely — or otherwise assuredly hoped — that he would answer my question now.
‘I’ll always limp, Watson.’ His eyes searched mine. Our hands met at his knee. ‘I don’t think I’ll be able to run again.’
‘Indeed,’ Holmes replied with a smirk. The tension was lessened when Holmes chuckled beside me, I joining in.
‘Have you no faith in me at all?’ I muttered, mostly to myself, as I reached across the table and placed my hand on his wrist, feeling his pulse thump against my skin. ‘Holmes, we have already discussed this.’
He nodded and kissed me, his hand and hips moving to drive me to completion. I could only kiss him as much as I could manage and thrust into his grasp, and I could still feel his hard prick pulsing against mine, his breath stuttering against my lips, and I closed my eyes and fell quickly into my end.
. He had agreed to wait for me outside the club, as there happened to be a bench across the street on which he could sit and rest his leg (he had assured me that his meeting with the mysterious researcher would not last long).
Holmes held up an arm and I, a blush threatening my cheeks, walked into the half-sphere of his proffered arm and stretched my arm around him to set my hand on his waist. The young lass did not even blink, and turned again to Holmes; she began a tirade of rapid-fire French at Holmes, a look of earnestness on her face.
I smirked at the attempted detachment of his command, but I knew better: his cheeks were flushed, and his prick wasn’t exactly soft, although it was without a doubt spent for the night. I pressed closer and rocked my hips once to see his reaction: he hummed and thrusted his hips back, forcing me inside deeper. He seemed very interested in continuing, and I knew Holmes rarely did anything he didn’t wish to, so I took him at his word and began to move.
It lasted the span of a breath, our lips pressed together hard, then, as Holmes pulled back or else simply relaxed into the embrace, it immediately turned delicate. He pulled away before I would have liked him to, and then I chastised myself for wanting more when I realised again where we were, the thunderous cacophony of applause roaring back to my ears. I opened my eyes (had I closed them in the span of an instant?) to see Holmes inches from my face, his cheeks ruddy, his hair slightly unkempt, and a pleased, if small, smile on his face.
‘Thank you,’ is all he said, and he stood and stretched, that delightful smile never leaving his face. ‘Oh, I feel
He nodded. ‘I was on my way to see you again. Mycroft had been giving me updates, short coded messages. I— I was on my way to see you again, Watson, and as soon as I saw the papers, I knew I couldn’t ever possibly return to England again, or else risk ruin.’
As the poor afternoon light was fading, it seemed my travels and the day’s events all caught up to me in the form of a loud stomach rumble. Holmes heard it; we were sat once again on the sofa, side by side, my hand resting on his thigh (I must confess we had spent the better part of an hour kissing and otherwise embracing). He chuckled at my bodily noise and clasped my hand.
To whom it may concern: next chapter might go up in rating (and if it does, the fic's rating will be changed). Here's the warning in super advance.
He nodded, looking at his pocket watch, the movement finalising his breezy demeanour. ‘Doctor Watson, now that some truth has come to light, I must discuss with you some … trivialities.’
‘We are safe in this city,’ Holmes replied softly. ‘I have done research. I have felt around; there is nothing here. We are invisible here, Watson. And even if we weren’t… We are, in the German eyes, foreigners. They would merely bid us to leave.’
I groaned and shifted myself. His arms came up around me as I pressed into him; he shook as our erect members met with only our nightshirts between us.
Holmes was speaking to a young lady at the bar, a drink in his hand. I presumed she was indeed a young lady: her appearance, her hair, even her clothes and posture, rather pointed in the direction of a young chap. It was only her eyes and voice which I think gave her away. She was pretty, if not manly looking, and I forced my thoughts to stop there before I made a fool of myself.
A grin broke out on his face, more joyful than I had ever seen him, and I felt the muscles of my face stretch to match his. The bed was ours, and I feel we had deserved it.
I was not sure how that sentence was meant to be finished, but I wouldn’t let him have an excuse not to eat. ‘Holmes, we must find you something to eat.’
We doddered back to his digs slowly and, for once, not arm in arm. There was a heat to his very presence that hadn’t been there before, as though he were burning from the inside out, his chin tipped upward as though floating on high above the rest of us. I wondered at him; his moods, as I have transcribed, have always seemed mercurial at best, and it seemed he had not changed so much in that respect.
I was limited in my movement in this position, but it also allowed me to penetrate him deeper, and I felt the effects of it within the first half-dozen thrusts. I was
I led us in the direction of an empty corner table, my arm around his waist, giving him possibly more strength than he required, but all the same he was leaning on me heavily. I berated myself; had I pushed him too far? Would he be able to stand if I let him go?
‘You are a marvel,’ I hushed, and it came out more hoarse and heartfelt than I meant it to. There was a sharp intake of breath next to me. I felt Holmes’s eyes on me but could not meet them, only settled for closing my eyes and kissing his hand, then holding it to my chest. When I opened them again, Holmes pulled his hand from my grasp and wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and the two of us leaned back on the couch, my hand on the knee of his bad leg, gentle but there.
But that is another matter, a philosophical debacle I have tired of over the years. Now, years into our companionship, I can only admire him, gaze agape at him, at my whole-bodied love for him. I think of this now, watching him sleep next to me as the sun streams in.
It is almost as though he heard it, for just then he starts to shuffle awake. First his arms stretch, then his brow furrows, then he purses his lips briefly before licking them, and finally his eyelids flutter open and he squints. His arm and eyes find me at the same time, and I shuffle closer when he grumbles a wordless
‘You’ve not finished,’ he murmured. He sounded sleepy. I shook my head; I was still very hard and very much inside him. ‘I have an idea.’ He shuffled a bit, dislodging me, and turned over to his good side. I took his hint and lay behind him, just as we had slept the night before; I held one hand to my quite angry cock, willing myself with all that I had not to spend prematurely.
, he would say if he dabbled much in Vergil — it was a beauty to see Holmes calm and lean against me. Or at least near me.
My chest constricted with emotion. Holmes was alive. I reached for him, but the bed was empty save me. The sheet was bunched up around my waist, the pillow fallen off the bed altogether. It was then that I remembered what we had done the night before. I felt my cheeks warm and my prick stir at the explicit images that came to mind, the intensity and weightiness of such an interaction with Holmes, the man I had yearned for for years, but chief in my mind was worry, for Holmes had not stayed.
I had reason to believe it was quite welcome, for as soon as he took in a breath and let it out, he became a puddle on top of me. I kissed his hair and wrapped my arms around his back.
Holmes was always a character on trains. He was a character everywhere, of course, but on trains especially. He was often antsy, especially when our travels were taking us to a new mystery, and too often spent it fretting about. I spent such journeys remaining as still as I could manage, knowing eventually he would sense me and still himself, and by the last thirty minutes of each of these longer journeys, he always calmed enough to sit next to me, lean his head back against the wall of the carriage, steeple his fingers in his lap, and sigh. I do not know if he sensed my smugness each of these times; he never spoke to it. But it was a beauty to see,
Holmes looked down, somewhere in the vicinity of my shoulder. He held the newspaper he had picked up in his hands, crossed in front of him. He shook his head.
“John,” I start to moan. His arms rush around me, his knees bracketing me closer, and his hips buck upwards harsher than before. “
He informed me that my belongings had already been packed (I ruffled at the thought of someone rifling through my things and Holmes’s, but I suppose I would have to be grateful for the expediency of it) and that my practise was already sold. My return to London, by the looks of it, was to be carried out for two reasons: to keep up appearances with the story Mycroft had crafted, and to personally fetch my savings and the money from the sale of my practise. I was fine with a quick trip — the weight at the thought of being so separated from Holmes again had begun to settle in my stomach. Mycroft handed me an envelope and finished our conversation with a speech that left me quite perturbed.
I let my hands brush his neck, cupped the back of it, still keeping him close. ‘You do not seem very grateful for a home in France, my fellow.’
He nodded, almost manic with it. I reapplied more of the ointment, during which time I watched him, eyes closed, one hand by his head, clutching the poor pillow, his other hand moving slowly up and down his prick, as if comforting it. I felt hot watching him and hastened to return my fingers there.
He kept his mouth shut and his head turned. Very well, I thought; I would hear about it later. Setting it aside, I shook my head and gingerly felt around the bruises, checking. He winced every time, which was so unlike him I nearly began to panic. But this was a different Holmes now than the one I had known, for many reasons. I should be glad that he did not hide the depth of his pain from me.
‘Why couldn’t you have told me, Holmes?’ I wanted to reach out and touch him, to understand why he thought he had to keep this all from me. But then I saw the look in his eyes as they reached mine.
‘Watson,’ he whispered, and I lost myself to his eyes and fell forward, pressing my lips to his. He was waiting for such a movement; our lips met, parted, and in a moment our tongues were brushing alongside each other’s and I was straightening myself and he himself so that I was fully atop him.
He tilts my hips up and pounds into me, holding me still so I can only take it -- and I feel my eyes roll back and my cock start to spurt between us. I clutch his other shoulder with a death grip as I come, my entire body feeling like it is shaking apart. I hear him curse and cry out, and he grinds into me dirty, just the way I like, and I spurt for longer than I ever have, his cock rubbing the orgasm out of me. His own release spreads within me, I feel it rush in, feel him tense then relax into me. His arms wrap around me and hold me close, his cock only just beginning to soften, and I let myself be held as I catch my breath. Unbelievable, is always what goes through my mind in these moments. That and -- love. Pure, unquestionable, real, undeniable love.
Once in London, I was to tell everyone that I was offered an opportunity to go back home to my ancestral Scotland, to assist with a family practise, and indeed, I was told, the elder Holmes had set up a practise there with some distant cousin of mine whom I hadn’t seen since I was a wee child. My cousin was informed only that I needed an alibi (Lord knows what he would think of it all; knowing him, if offered a running tab in his pub, he would agree to anything), and Mycroft had an agent willing to sit in the community and watch it the next few months to see if any trouble would come of it. I was to tell Mrs Hudson this and nothing more; Mycroft would not budge, even when I implored him that she would love to know that Holmes was alive.
We set off once more, this time with him clutching me as though to remain upright. If I had looked at him, I knew I would have seen a poorly masked grimace. This was not the Holmes I had known, and I knew better than to embarrass him by exhibiting any pity. Pity I did have, or at least some of it, but we both were upright gentlemen, and I remembered how I hated the pitying glances I received at being invalided and plopped back in London. I was determined not to afford him the same treatment, even if seeing him this affected broke my heart.
Further: I was saddened to learn that the foxtrot wasn’t a thing until 1914, which is far too late for this Holmes & Watson. Even sadder to realise the fun dances of the twenties and thirties wouldn’t be an option for them either… For the love of fanfiction, can’t someone write an AU that places Holmes & Watson in that era and have them dance their hearts out? Or does someone have a fic rec thereof?
‘You are everything to me, Holmes,’ I whispered moments later. The swarm of hormones had invaded my brain, and I felt warm all over and full of love for the man in my arms. Holmes’s head was pillowed on my arm, and I kissed the back of his neck sweetly. He didn’t seem to want me to move, nor had I any inclination to do so, and so I stayed there, my softening prick still inside him. It was the most intimate encounter of which I had ever been a part, including any semi-truthful trysts which had unfortunately and embarrassingly earned me my army nickname. Holmes was different, obviously so, and I spent not a single second or thought wasted on the reality of what we had just done, for to me, it was and could only ever be an act of the utmost love and devotion.
(And to the commenter asking about Magnus Hirschfeld -- can't say what exactly he was doing in 1901, and trust me, I googled it, but we're eighteen years short of his Institut and still seven years short of Edward Carpenter's The Intermediate Sex. Hirschfeld was doing research for his Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen in 1901 I'm fairly positive, so perhaps... somewhere ... H&W are included.)
smile. I did not allow myself to bristle at seeing it directing at me, not in this moment. ‘It is a phenomenon treated quite differently here, my dear fellow, than in our old England.’
He nodded, and his eyes opened and caught mine. There was a twinkle in them, just as there had been before all this, and he had a naughty look to him. ‘Very good, Watson. Yes, the blood was all my own.’ Even I could deduce the pride in his voice at what to him must have been a simple, even obvious, observation.
The rays only serve to accentuate his golden features. To me he has always been a ray of light -- even, as he has recorded, a conductor of light. His greying hair still has traces of gold in it, and when he smiles at me, nay, when he merely gazes at me, he seems to shine like the sun itself, nearly too bright to look upon. I love him at all times, and I especially do so right now. My heart beats with it, every drumbeat seeming to resonate his name.
To live with Holmes here. To move my life away from London. I had in my modest suitcase only enough clothes for less than a week and exactly one novel. The rest of my belongings — clothes, books, medical journals, trinkets collected through the years, that ship still not fully put together — remained in London. Not to mention all of Holmes’s belongings, which I had lived alongside in his absence. Some things I could certainly live without, but a few items I would prefer to see again. And my practise, abandoned at a moment’s notice for what I had thought would be a short jaunt to Germany, still lay waiting for me to return. And Mrs Hudson, our poor housekeeper left alone — what would she think? She would have no trouble letting our rooms, but I could not imagine the emotional toil it would cost her to lose me after she’d lost Holmes. She had told me on more than one lonely night that we were like sons to her. Could we really abandon her to live in this fashioned Elysium thousands of miles away?
I quiver at this and kiss his shoulder as I spread my legs wide. I have no wish to speak, nor do I need to: he knows my body better than his own, and I his. So I continue my slow movements silently, and with no barriers between us, and start to shudder. This was not the plan at all when I woke up, but I am more than willing to float away on this escapade, in the safety of our home and in my lover’s arms.
He shook his head. It was strange, to me, that Holmes would not be interested in seeing his relation after said relation had travelled to another country for him, but I also understood that the Holmes brothers were in no way typical relations. Perhaps Holmes was not interested in letting his brother see his condition (he had rather visibly limped at my side on our walk to the place); or perhaps they had seen each other enough; or perhaps the two of them in the same room would raise some question from someone. I did not ask, for it was not truly my business, and so I bid Holmes farewell with a simple, curt nod and a glance that he matched which communicated
The kettle whistled, and I took it off the heat so as not to wake him. If Holmes must adapt, so I would along with him. I knew that now: wherever he went was precisely where I needed to be. I would follow him anywhere, to the ends of the earth, if needs must. Even to Berlin, this most foreign of cities, it seemed.
We walked side by side, Holmes steering us as needed, down streets unfamiliar to me but presumably increasingly familiar to Holmes, until we stopped at what looked like the entrance to a pub. It was: Holmes led me into it, speaking a few foreign (to my ears) words to the gentleman just inside the door.
‘The ruffian and I parted ways immediately; it was then I realised the German spirit, Watson.’ The first was finally rolled; he reached into his trouser pocket for a match and lit it. ‘He was hankering for a brawl as I was. I wager I could have followed him to another pub, a darker one, more suited to our tastes.’
‘It is nothing to do with luck, dear fellow,’ I whispered against his lips, feeling as though I was holding the very world in my grasp. I felt his eyes on mine, even as mine were on his lips. I kissed him once more, a chaste peck, and continued, ‘It is all to do with love.’
My mood began to sour as I thought this through. Holmes had gone on a manhunt while I believed him dead. I mourned him harder than a man my age should have, and now, knowing better, I wondered if I could have assisted him. This was a case like the others were, and Holmes went through it alone, and got irreparably hurt. Could I have helped him? Could I have prevented any of his bruises, his injuries?
My things sorted, I wandered back to Holmes, who still was sat in the entryway, staring at the wall and seemingly deep in thought. After a moment, he looked up.
He stood up again, leaning on his cane more than he had the entire day. I reached a hand out in response, wanting to say
“You’re a rascal this morning, aren’t you,” he hushes against my hips, bringing my hips into a slow, leisurely roll. My faculties fail me when our erections press together: I can only gasp and nod. My Watson always knows how to break me in the end, to turn me into a feeling creature instead of a thinking machine. Only he can, and it is only him whom I allow to see me like this.
‘And you, too.’ He turned to me and we looked at each other. ‘There’s a café not far that serves cheap day old bread.’
‘Watson,’ he whispered, moving to my cheek, my jaw, my neck, kissing me hurriedly or otherwise pressing his lips and dragging them about. ‘Watson, Watson, Watson,’ he chanted, and my heart broke again as I could only lay back and pant, eyes closed, holding in my arms the man I had wanted for so very long.
Our kisses blurred into each other after that, and I believe we fell asleep again, pressed together as such.
He smiled up at me with eyes as brighter than I’d ever seen them. I smiled back, running my hands through his hair, then allowed myself one more kiss to his forehead before regretfully stepping away back to my seat. It was the afternoon, after all, even if very little sunlight could make it through the miniscule, boarded-up front windows. It was more than a little unseemly to partake in such activities at this time of day, even if we were in a foreign city.
It was hardly bigger than the mat I slept on in my army days, with only a threadbare sheet on it and a pillow with more stains than clean space. As much as I wanted it to, I was not sure the bed could hold two men. Or at least, it certainly wouldn’t without a fair amount of … embracing. And I doubted the sofa would suit either of us at the moment.
Holmes nodded and patted my hand. ‘I was told I had an ear for it. I still have most of the costumes.’
It did; I hobbled through the crowds with my cane, not attracting as much attention as I had expected (or feared). The address was a home, someone’s home, I figured as I came upon it. There was a flowerbox under the single window, dug out and bare, and a dying wreath on the door. I knocked, not finding the bell, and waited. The elder Holmes had said there would be a man to answer the door who would know of me and my purpose, who spoke elegant English and would accompany as necessary on the mystery. I could only trust him now, finding myself in a very foreign country.
He laughed, and I could not keep myself from drawing him nearer and kissing the side of his head. ‘If I return—’ A pained expression overtook Holmes’s face, and I immediately corrected myself in a stern voice, ‘
I opened the door after steeling myself; it was just a telegram. I thanked the young lad (in German, one of the few words I knew), breathed deeply,  and brought the telegram to Holmes.
Holmes instinctively wrapped both legs around my waist and tilted himself even better as I began to move in earnest. He was whimpering with every breath now, every exhale, and I straightened out my sore legs as best I could and ducked my head against his shoulder and rode him with all I had.
We sat on the couch together until I began to get a twinge in my back. Sitting up, I felt him stir beside me and realised he had fallen asleep. How little did he sleep now that he could doze so easily?
I wondered, though, what life we could have if we immigrated to Holmes’s family home in France. No one would know us there except whatever remained of Holmes’s distant family, perhaps. But were we to stay in Berlin… I wondered how long it would take for Holmes to be recognised, or worse, for me to somehow give him away. It was a dangerous game we were playing, staying in a metropolis, surrounded by thousands of people, if not millions. People who could be anyone, people who might be likely to recognise who we were. As much as I wished to give Holmes all the concerts money could afford, I was not sure I would give up our safety to stay here.
‘There is a man I must see,’ he answered surprisingly cheerfully, sparing me a quick glance before looking straight ahead again. ‘He has been researching something quite revolutionary indeed.’
I watched him, his eyes on the floor, as he made his way to me a bit slower than usual (another infinitesimal fact I chose to ignore). Once he reached my side, he took my arm, which was quite a good sign and made my heart soar. I smiled at him and patted his hand, and he let me lead the way out.
I looked over at him on the couch. He hadn’t moved; perhaps he really was asleep. In the time since I had first entered this place, he had not seemed the Holmes I knew and recognised, the Holmes on the hunt. There was no hint of that great Detective in him, that I had seen. Had he possibly given that up, now that he couldn’t be in London? Now that his condition was… what it was? I found it hard to believe, damn near difficult to imagine, but I also doubt I could have ever pictured him in the state he was now. Moriarty had changed a lot of things, it seemed. Holmes had had to adapt. He would have to adapt.
‘I can’t return to England, Watson, if I want a chance to avoid gaol. And England is your home, my dear fellow, it was our home. But I wonder…’ He paused while I hoped and prayed he was going to say what I thought he was. ‘I think I can make something of myself here, and I wonder, I mean to say, I—’ I held my breath as he released his on what sounded like a frustrated exhale. Finally he glanced up at me and held my eyes. ‘Watson, it would be an honour if you would… help me.’
Fire ran through my veins at his words and launched me forwards; I closed the distance between us, kissing him with that fiery passion thrumming in my blood, which was ever thrumming in my blood when I was near him. I tried my best to convey the resounding
This is, as I see it, the end of Part One. I do have plans for a next part, but whether I will write it in a timely fashion is yet to be seen, and also will feature a shift into Holmes’s perspective as well. As it is, I am marking this as completed; if it is to be continued, it will be in another story altogether. I thank you, Dear Readers, for staying this far. You mean more than I ever realised.
His hands travel gently from my hips to my chest, my pectorals, my shoulders, and I sit up straighter on his cock, my exhales shaky. He seems content to let me have this moment, and I appreciate it. I move my hips just so from side to side, feeling him move within me, and let out a whorish moan at the feeling. So full, so wonderfully…
I could not be convinced of it; but to press any further would be to draw a wedge between Holmes and myself. My promise would keep — I would not put any unnecessary danger between the two of us and the rest of the world — but I let the severity, the undercurrent of panic at being
‘Holmes,’ I said, not moving from my spot. My voice came out gruffer than I meant it to, even in my emotional state, and I lifted my chin when his eyes finally rose to mine.
Needless to say, it was a sight for sore eyes. I had a feeling then that Holmes was back in his element. The sight of papers strewn all about inspired in me a feeling of familiar exasperation, for it was not the first time I had seen such a mess created by Holmes himself. The difference here was time: now I welcomed such a mess, because it meant that Holmes was on the hunt again. Even if it would fall to me to clean it up, as our dear landlady was not here (a thought I did not allow myself to sit on).
I smiled, the strength of it growing as Holmes smiled back at me, even as he looked down. He held his lit cigarette in his mouth and began to roll another.
He didn’t have to elaborate further on the sentiment, for I understood: He had chosen to leave me behind to think the worst, as he ridded London of this villain.
The years have only made him more attractive. Or: as my love for him has grown, have I only grown fonder? This is another conundrum which I do not wish to entertain at the moment.
He stood again, and with a quick glance to him and a hasty nod on his part, I unfastened his trousers and pulled them down enough to find a trail of ugly bruises from his hip bone down the outside of his left thigh. They were so fearful looking that I wasn’t able to restrain a gasp this time; my heart thudding in my chest, I rested my forehead on his stomach, holding him by the waist, careful not to grasp him too hard. Those bruises were deep; he must have been beaten to a pulp.
‘Oh!’ A single cry, followed by a keening sound, and I groaned a matching noise and bit just a little. He moaned outright when I released his hip and felt upwards with my hand to squeeze at his other nipple. ‘
He was hot inside, and tight, and I couldn’t think any more about it when he clenched around that finger
I looked at Holmes. He looked sheepish, almost, as though Mycroft had said something or promised something that Holmes didn’t care for. I nodded, awaiting another comment, but got none.
“Sherlock,” he whispers, then tries to sit up a bit. I shake my head and press his shoulders against the mattress, not hard, just enough to prove my point. I can see a glint in his eyes and a smirk on his lips as I move above him, straddling his hips. His hands fall there, on my bony hips, immediately, and I kiss him like I know he likes: slow, deep, with enough tongue to tease but not be overwhelming. He hums in appreciation and I roll my hips to find his desire evident.
Passion overtook me; I felt it rise up from deep within my chest, where it had sat forlorn for years and years, bubble up through me, into my fingers which were on either side of his head, threading through his hair, as I pressed myself forward and pulled him closer simultaneously, in the vain attempt that we become one. As a result of my shoving and pulling, Holmes ended up in my lap in the chair, his head tilting this way and that before he found the best (of course he would find it quicker than anyone else) angle and kissed me with what could only be described as desperate, passionate,
And I do so, his moustache, as well as some stubble, tickling me. I feel him smile into the kiss and feel myself returning it. My God, to think that I could allow myself this, that I could have this at all with the man that I love…
I hope reading Holmes&Watson dancing freely in public soothed & balmed your soul as much as it soothed mine writing it.
‘Is this for a case?’ I asked after I’d finished a second cup of tea. The mess of papers around Holmes seemed to have grown; it didn’t seem possible, but it looked as if there were more newspapers now.
He turned his head to my shoulder, mouthing at it, and moments later I felt a hand to my own arse, giving me a start, but I quickly understood the request of its placement. I thrust into him faster, then harder, snapping my hips as best as I could, fucking him with my prick as well as I knew how.
“I love you,” he says moments later against my lips. I nod, not sure I can say it back at the moment, something heavy sitting in my throat, and kiss him more. My Watson, still in bathed in this sunlight, staring at me with such love in his eyes that I melt against him. The sunlight has nothing on him; I can say that now, and even can venture saying it to him. He is my sun.
He said the last just a bit louder, as though testing me, testing the world, the crowd, and I looked around, panicked. Some heads from other tables looked up in our general direction, but just as soon lost interest and returned to their own worlds. Could we really be so safe? So invisible?
If I could have bent down comfortably to kiss him then, I would have. I opted instead to take his hand and press it to my lips, which earned me a radiant, surprisingly sentimental smile; then I pressed one hand to his arse and the other to my prick. I rubbed it against his rim and felt it twitch; gasping, and looking not down to where I was about to press inside, but at Holmes directly, our eyes connected, I pushed forward and aimed true.
He rotates my hips sinfully slowly, making sure to drag his erect member against my prostate at each go. I tremble and clutch the hair on one side of his head and whimper.
The men and women were separated, but that wasn’t terribly surprising: what was surprising was the way they were separated. Or rather, the… intimacies … between them. Men danced with men, and women danced with women. Men were draped across other men’s laps, women had arms around each other.
I wasn’t sure how to respond; I was shocked silent by his frankness, by such vulnerable words. He continued after another few puffs, looking not at me but at the floor.
Holmes unlatched our lips, panting at the ceiling above us, and without missing a beat I moved down to his neck. It was pale and delicious, and I wanted to mark it. I wondered if Holmes would let me.
‘You see, Watson, and I’m sure you might have guessed by now — Moriarty knew things about me which were dangerous, just as I knew things about him which, given I had gone to the police, would have imprisoned him. Or worse. If they could have caught him, at least…’ Holmes exhaled a near sigh and put his hand over his face, looking at his lap. ‘In some circles, what he knew about me — and he noticed it almost immediately, I am ashamed to say — was far worse than any crimes he ever committed. In the eyes of England.’
After the first act or so, Holmes lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it, then kissed my bare wrist. He turned to me, eyes glistening, and whispered, ‘If only we were truly alone right now…’ And then he glanced briefly in my lap. I was not hard, or at least not enough to be visibly so, but the sentiment of his statement remained.
Interested, I let him lead me down the street, his limp more pronounced when we weren’t arm in arm. He wasn’t wincing, at least from what I could tell from my viewpoint at his side, and it wasn’t so debilitating that I ought to admonish him, as doctor, to take a rest. I let it be and simply observed him, committing to memory his exact gait now, so that I could compare it to a worse one later if need be.
Holmes stared at me and stared at me, something happening on his face, as though he were thinking through some process. There was some emotion in his eyes that he was letting me see, and I was nearly taken aback by it, whatever it was, surprised at its vulnerability. He looked as if he were in pain when he replied,  ‘Mycroft has a plan, I am sure of it. I daresay I’ve an inkling.’
‘Slowly at first, just, ah, one…’ he whispered then gasped as I pressed a finger just there, against his fundament, feeling him. He was hot and clearly enjoyed just feeling my finger there; I looked up from watching it to see his face. He was biting his lip, a sheen of sweat and a look of pure, exquisite anticipation on his face.
After a minute or so walking, Holmes stopped off to the side of the sidewalk to light another cigarette. He offered me one, which I wordlessly accepted, and even lit it for me, his hand cupping around the flame, our faces very close. I watched him intently from this close, unable to help myself. As it was lit, I took a drag and let him rake his eyes over my face as much as he liked, enjoying his thorough attention and affection. I watched him lick his lips, his eyes I am sure on my own lips, and then he turned with a small smile and curt nod and led the way again.
. I sighed, exasperated, and stood up slowly, leaning on Holmes’s good side so as not to anger my own bad leg. ‘The bruises are fine, just extensive. But what of your leg?’
However, my leg was starting to give me real trouble, and as if on cue, Holmes led me into another venue, this time for his Wagner concert. By that time I was quite tired from all the walking and thankful to once again take a seat.
His face is flush, a faint red from exertion, and he stares up at me with brow furrowed in concentration, sweat beginning to bead on his forehead. He is a masterpiece of arousal, and I have to still my hips before I reach my crisis too soon.
‘The ruffian’s.’ He took another sip of his tea then stood, walking across the kitchen to a ripped cardboard box sitting on the dirty floor. I could tell he couldn’t kneel, for he was bent over awkwardly, rummaging around in it. I left him to it and listened.
Holmes, I thought obsessively; I was closer to him than anyone else ever had been, both body and spirit; closer to him, to the man I loved with everything I had and am. I moved within him, feeling my end approaching quicker now, and submitted to it. Holmes was in my arms, making soft noises as I stroked that spot within him with
I nodded, my blood boiling at the thought of being inside Holmes. He spread his legs then huffed in annoyance: his gown was in the way. It took us only a few more seconds to divest him and then myself, and then once more I was kneeling between his scandalously spread legs, salve on my fingers.
,” he hushes against my lips, and when he plants his feet on the bed and brackets my hips, the new angle pushes me forward and I kiss him, gasping into his mouth.
‘Promise you’ll come back to me,’ he said after a pregnant pause. His eyes were drooping; I imagined he was nearly asleep.
My thumb brushed his cheek rhythmically, left right, right left, as I watched his eyes change with my pronouncement.
Holmes looked up at me as I approached, a smile on his lips as he continued talking. It sounded as though he were speaking French. I looked again at his conversation partner, who was now also turned to watch me approach.
Just before the performance began, Holmes turned to me, a soft expression on his face. ‘Thank you for accompanying me,’ he whispered.
When she finished speaking, Holmes held a finger up to her and turned to me. ‘I recognised Erika from my visit to Herr Hirschfeld this afternoon. She has been filling me in on a little case.’ My eyebrows raised, interest piqued, and I turned to her. She didn’t seem to have understood what Holmes had said to me. He continued, ‘I have already solved it, my dear man. Listen.’ He then proceeded to turn his attention back to this Erika and blast out words so quick yet so articulated that I found it impossible to discern one foreign word from the next. It was a blur of deductions, and as he spoke, a look of surprise, shock, then relief overtook Erika’s face.
‘John!’ he cried as I began to spurt against him. I heard myself growling, unable to stop it, and pushed and pushed and pushed against him, wanting to be nearer, ever nearer, and was surprised to feel him pulse and arch and, with a long, almost high-pitched whine, he came against me. The moment was prolonged, carried us outward together, until my limbs became heavy and I collapsed once more (carefully) to his side.
‘Oh, Watson,’ he murmured. The anguish on his face was apparent, but I was thankful that at least there were no tears. ‘Only I won’t be here when you return.’
,’ he exhaled several moments later, and it was all I needed to hear before I kissed him again. My heart was in my arms, all the love and light I ever had in my life, alive once more in my lap; if I never moved from that chair, I would die the happiest man on earth.
‘John, you will have to go back to London,’ he said all at once on an exhale. I closed my mouth. He still was staring a hole in my sleeve. ‘My cousin is buying your practise, but you will still have to pack up 221B and tell Mrs Hudson and anyone else who would suspect your sudden disappearance to another country. Mycroft will order you to leave again. He has probably already bought a ticket for you.’
I looked up then to find Holmes staring at me intensely. He seemed as though he had watched me take the internal journey I just had and was waiting on its result. I was not sure what to say; I looked to him for guidance. Holmes nearly always had a plan, and if one was ever lacking, it wouldn’t be for long.
He nodded at me, or rather in the direction of my fingers, and I took the movement as the goad it was. I withdrew my fingers just to the tip and then thrust them back in. My hips moved with them, following the movement, and my prick ended up pressed to the side of his thigh. His spine bowed, his head thrown back, and he let out the most gorgeous, heartfelt whimper that I hurriedly repeated the movement again, and again, to the same effect.
, and when he turned his head at an awkward angle and kissed me, I gasped and felt myself begin to spurt inside him.
I sat him down at the table and walked around to sit across from him. I blinked; that wouldn’t do. I did whatever I could to move gracefully around the U-shaped booth to sit next to him.
He groaned at the stretch, his hips twitching minutely off the bed, and with one quick look at me, one of his hands flew to his cock. I swallowed thickly. There was a stillness in the air, as though we were caught in this moment, suspended in it, in its intimacy; I inside him and watching him pleasure himself. He stared at me, his hand still on his cock, just holding it almost comically, until I swallowed again and nodded.
After several minutes of silence, Holmes said, without lowering the newspaper held in front of his face, ‘Hamlet is playing this afternoon at the Luisen Theater.’
s of our canes. There was hardly a breeze, and the air felt stuffy, almost oppressive, but I reckoned that was more of a reflection of my mind than anything: For I felt, walking side by side with Holmes on his way back, that I was walking into something bigger than myself. I had just witnessed something unbelievable, on several different levels; Holmes had just shown me a side of human nature I did not fully know existed, as well as a side to himself which, in doing so, put himself in danger should I be less of a man than he thinks me. As it was, and quite obviously, I would die before I would betray Holmes or give him up. That he allowed me to see that sacred part of his soul showed me more than anything else the level of trust Holmes bestowed in me. It was more than an honour and a privilege; I felt I held Holmes’s fragile yet strong heart in my hands, and I wanted only to cup my own doctor’s hands around it and protect it from all the evil in the world.
His hands leave my hips as I continue the slow movements, my breath ghosting against his lips as I cry out at each slow glide, and his hands move to grip my arse. He holds my cheeks for a moment, pulls them apart to gauge my reaction: as I moan and clutch the pillow his head is lying on, he pushes me up a bit.
With three fingers inside Holmes, he changed. His stomach tensed, his prick began to drip, and his whimpers became almost higher-pitched. When I struck that place in him again, he began whimpering my name under his breath, as if unaware he was doing it, and I leant over him to kiss him, to feel my own name against my lips.
Professor Moriarty was indeed dead, that much Holmes personally knew, he said as he had shoved him down the Falls himself. But Holmes had survived, and did not go down with him, and was on his way back to me when he saw one of Moriarty’s henchmen. It was a sign, he said, that Moriarty had not been working alone. He had had an inkling, but this sealed it for him. Moriarty had several criminals under his thumb, and Holmes would have to — get rid of them.
He lowered the newspaper and turned to me, a smile in his eyes. ‘Have you any plans for today, Watson?’
‘I must find something to eat, Holmes,’ I admonished after we passed yet another vendor trying to sell me meat.
I found Holmes sat on the sofa, his bad leg stretched out, his other bent at the knee. Newspapers flooded the room; a newspaper was in his hand, more discarded on either side of him on the smallish sofa, and seemingly dozens more all along the floor and even behind the sofa, as if he had thrown some over his shoulder in dismay or carelessness. His back was me, as I was behind the sofa, so I was able to take it all in without interruption: his charmingly sleep-mussed hair, his wrinkled white shirt, his hauntingly upright posture, his intense focus on the task at hand.
‘You know, Watson,’ he said under his breath, turning to me once we took our seats, ‘I was very nearly an actor.’
Our bread and beer finished, Holmes led me to where I could send the telegram and waited outside while I penned one to Mycroft and another to Mrs Hudson. I left the message to Mrs Hudson short and vague, afraid to give away Holmes’s secrets, even if I wanted to shout to the world that
He cried out and then his hands were between us, shaking, frantically pushing my nightshirt up and gathering his to push it up as well; I stilled and backed off only enough to let him get our erections together with nothing between them. Finally, our nightshirts bunched up around our chests, I lowered my hips once more and rutted against him with nothing at all between us. His hand came to his mouth and I watched him lick it, understanding, and stilled my hips as he reached between us and held both of us in his hand.
He nodded. ‘They do not raid these pubs like in London. There is only the trust that nothing overtly inappropriate occurs in the… front rooms.’ I looked around, taking in all of the touching, freely displayed in the open. It was, admittedly, rather a shock to my nerves. Perhaps I could no longer hold to any purity of soul in regards to the direction of my affections, but to see it in front of my face openly, shamelessly, rose a blush to my cheeks. I felt a volt of panic course through me, but Holmes took my arm and spoke. ‘If you feel uncomfortable, we can of course leave…’
‘Live with me.’ He held my gaze and continued after another shaky exhale, ‘Be with me. My companion. Like you were before all of this mess.’
Holmes’s raven-coloured hair, grown longer than I’d remembered, fanned out on the pillow. His nightshirt was quite too big on him, and white, which resulted in his pale neck and shoulder and collarbone laid bare for my eyes to feast upon. He looked up at me, his eyes a pale blue-green, a hunger in them that I recognised in myself. He waited patiently for me; I wondered how long he had waited for this very moment. The weight of all that this meant on my shoulders, I climbed into bed with him.
Holmes grunted and stood, balancing carefully on his cane. ‘I believe I promised you luncheon, my dear fellow.’
He pulled out a train ticket. ‘For tomorrow morning,’ he said, in awe, and handed it to me. I stared it down, disbelieving. Holmes and I still had the day together.
Mycroft stared at me a moment before speaking. ‘My brother is a dead man. In the eyes of the law right now, and in the future, if ever the present situation were to be found out.’
Eager to see him again, to make sure he was alright and — I admit I had to be sure this wasn’t a dream — to see if he was indeed alive and here with me, I rolled out of the cot and dressed quickly in the trousers from the day before and a new shirt and made haste to the sitting room.
He shook his head. ‘You are exquisite,’ he murmured, and took the hand I had placed on his stomach and kissed it. ‘Do continue.’
Am still working diligently on this piece with few inklings about where to take it. Any thoughts? Anything you want to see our boys do in turn of the century Berlin?
He smiled at this, a little lift of his lips, his eyes still closed. ‘And I realised I had no one at home to patch me up.’ My cheeks reddened. ‘And so I came home, or rather, I limped here, and decided to telegram my brother.’
Holmes turned towards me and laid his head on my good shoulder. I turned and kissed what I could reach of his head and contented myself to just sit with him for a few more moments, before anything could separate us again.
I let out a surprised laugh and kissed his forehead. He leaned against me and closed his eyes. ‘Tomorrow,’ I murmured into his hair. ‘It is Sunday, Holmes. I’ll board the train tomorrow. If that’s even what Mycroft has planned for me.’
I held the base of my prick and felt for his hole, angling it to line up. ‘Are you sure, Sherlock?’ Words were difficult to form, but I had to be absolutely positive that this — that this was wanted, because it felt, to me, like crossing the Rubicon.
I lean my weight on the pillow on either side of his head and lift myself up; our eyes meet and I nod and he pulls me down onto him, breaching me. I gasp at the feeling, my arms threatening to buckle. Every time, no matter how long we have done this, it is still overwhelming. His eyes are dark as he breaches me, and I let him control my lower half, pulling me down, seating himself within me. When my hips have reached his, I sit up a bit and pant, cursing under my breath. Gods above, the feel of him inside me always derails me utterly; I am laid waste to him.
,’ I gushed, then chastised myself from saying his Christian name so loud; but he did not seem perturbed in the slightest. In fact, he blushed further and smirked, looking almost smug. I would have to be careful next time, I told myself, unable to keep up the façade of practicality when faced with this pleased version of Holmes.
‘Holmes,’ I said, and I felt myself begin to shake. His hands, those hands I’ve yearned for, with those long, thin fingers, clutched my shoulders, and I buckled forward. ‘Holmes, is that really you?’
I had savings from my fruitful practise and from not paying rent at Baker Street (per Mycroft’s insistence after Holmes’s funeral). But those savings were rather safe in London, and I had no way of getting to them unless travelling back there. And the thought of leaving Holmes again — even for two days’ time — was devastating.
‘You’re alive,’ I said, but instead of shouting it like I wanted to, like the feeling in my chest bid me to, it came out on a shaky exhale. ‘Holmes, by God, you’re alive.’ My voice broke and I watched a tear rush forward and slide down his cheek. Holmes, crying! I wiped it away quickly with my thumb and leaned back just to look at him, look him in the eyes, in those verdigris eyes which were searching my own, and with a soft noise I broke and leaned forward, pressing my lips to his.
‘Yes, Watson.’ The words were hushed against my head; our foreheads were aligned and touching, and without thinking I was cupping his face. ‘I could ask the same of you,’ he whispered, and the depth of feeling in his words swelled my heart to bursting.
I withdrew my fingers and reached for the salve once more to slick myself up, but was surprised when Holmes sat up and took it out of my hands. I knelt before him, feeling a suppliant although our postures were equal. He kissed me once on the lips, then proceeded to focus all his attention on preparing my cock. I bit my lip and grasped his good shoulder so as not to lose it all then, counted to a dozen and then he was lying back against the pillow, pulling me to him by my prick, spreading his legs as wide as they could go, which happened to be fantastically, gorgeously, scandalously wide. I knelt between them and he lifted his hips up and shifted himself down, so that his arse was in my lap. I was not sure how long I could last in this position with my leg bent as it was, but the idea of it — of being inside Holmes, of being closer to him than anyone else ever had — overruled any concept of pain I could possibly conjure.
I felt him hum more than heard him and watched a small smile change his face. It was beatific; I grinned back at him. The next song was even livelier; I felt my spirits lift with the melody until I saw just a hint of a grimace on Holmes’s face. He did not falter his steps, but I knew just from that smallest eye twitch that he was in pain, had even felt his shoulders tense with it ever so briefly.
‘I’ll make tea,’ he said, and I followed him out of the foyer and into a small kitchen. I took the moment to calm my nerves, which I admit had been badly shaken upon seeing him again. I looked around instead of at the man himself; the house was cold but not damp and a bit smaller than our rooms on Baker Street. There were cobwebs in the corners, and as I peeked into the sitting room as we entered a room which must have been the kitchen, given the existence of a small stove with one kettle on it, I saw the telltale sign of Holmes’s inhabitance here: papers were strewn about, on nearly every surface possible. There were not nearly as many as he had in our rooms, but the style — if one can attach ‘style’ to such disorderliness — was quite the same. Had I not been overjoyed, nearly exuberant, at his being alive, I would have twitched in annoyance at the state of it all.
He settled and reached backward to grasp my thigh, and I came closer to him and pressed inwards once more. He gasped.
“Naked,” he says simply, and I fulfil his request swiftly and with no hesitation. When I return atop him, he is bare as well, save sparkling eyes and our jar of salve in his left hand. “You want more, don’t you?” he grumbles, a warm, knowing timbre to his voice, and I shiver. “I know you do: I can tell, you know.”
It was awkward. Two men in a bed meant for one — it was tight. Because of my shoulder and my leg, I was limited to lying on one side, maybe my back if necessary. It seemed Holmes was limited as well. It took a few movements, both of us situating ourselves to the best of our abilities, but when we found a position, it clicked.
He hummed and shifted a little, pulling me closer, closer so that he was on his back and I was above him, his legs on either side of my hips. The position, the intimacy of it, made me hot; I felt sweat begin to accumulate at my hairline. He was kissing me, and it was all I could do to kiss back, to match him lip for lip, and keep breath in my lungs and some intellect in my head.
He set the kettle on a rickety-looking stove and motioned for us to sit at a very small table, which had been pushed against the opposite wall and was covered with papers and cigarette ashes. There was but a single chair at the table, an indubitable sign of his life alone; I glanced casually at a few papers on the table, careful not to express this sad thought even mutely, not wanting him to deduce my pity when it wasn’t that at all. I busied myself glancing blindly at the papers as he brought in the chair which I had collapsed upon earlier, and then we were sat across from each other.
The kiss turned sweet, almost chaste, as he let go of the pillow to let his hand roam my side then hold onto my hair.
He smiled demurely. I said nothing, still eating, and pointedly looked at the bread before him. After a moment, he picked it up and took a modest bite. I nodded in praise and affirmation, and he chewed and swallowed and continued. ‘We shall see. You need to send telegrams, I imagine?’
With Holmes’s death, I thought that, at some point, my bone-deep love for him would diminish or at the very least, if not disappear, lessen its weight upon my chest. Yet six months, eight months, a year and a half on, nearly everything reminded me of him, every day, and my chest aches still at the thought of him.
She returned it, Holmes saying something over my shoulder, most likely introducing me. I did not hear my name at all; of course — Holmes had provided me with an alibi. I would have to ask him what it was later. She shook my hand and said something else, which I managed to recognise, or at least ascertain given the context, to mean ‘nice to meet you’. She thanked Holmes (another small French phrase I could understand) and departed.
He was beautiful like this: wanton, and shameless, and somehow exactly like himself in this intimate moment. It was still Holmes before me, but a quivering, pleasure-seeking Holmes, lost not in himself but in this moment
With one hand upon his breast and the other on his good shoulder, he prepares me with three fingers, the other hand on my hip to rock me back like I like. I begin to lose control as he hits my prostate with each thrust: my head rolls back and I have to bite my lip not to be too loud. My Watson knows how to tear me apart, and when I look down, I observe he is far from unaffected.
— and retracted myself, breathing heavily, trying to backtrack and save myself, save our friendship. But he held my good shoulder with one hand and clasped the back of my head with his other and brought us back together, our noses touching. He closed his eyes and I did the same and breathed him in, and he whined, I would swear it to the day of my death, Sherlock Holmes whined against my lips before pressing his lips to mine, continuing the kiss which I had started.
Holmes chortled. ‘Yes, when I require an alibi, I am somewhat Norwegian,’ he said in a very convincing foreign accent. He slipped back into his posh lilt: ‘But no one here knows, or cares, about Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr Watson.’
‘You’re no less of a man to me, Holmes,’ I whispered into his hair. ‘I didn’t want to believe those rumours, the nasty gossip they were spreading about you—’ He huffed against my neck. ‘But I am very pleased that they are true.’
This is three weeks late and not even finished -- I am still cranking out the first major Sex Scene I've written in ages & thought 1) it'd be better to update to not lose you dear readers & 2) give you dear readers the option to skip smut easier if needs must.
As promised, rating goes up in this chapter. Nothing plotty happens (other than romantically & passionately) -- so can be skipped if need be.
By this time, Holmes had just finished rolling a fourth cigarette and put out the one he had been smoking. He didn’t reply for a moment, as he put all the accoutrements back together and closed the sack. I expected him to carry it back, but he didn’t, just left it on the table, and I wagered he was too sore. My suspicions were proven right as soon as I thought them; I observed his hand travel to his leg, rubbing up and down his thigh absentmindedly, and then he spoke.
The walk to the café was more than I could imagine was comfortable for him. This wasn’t London, and even in a setting in which I knew no one and no one knew me, I didn’t take Holmes’s arm like we sometimes used to walk. He was quiet, and I could tell his mood had changed. There was a stiffness in him. It took all of my effort not to believe the rigidity lay in his regard for me. I held my tongue — we had talked about emotions enough for one day. I pushed forward and let my hand briefly touch his as they swayed while we walked. It was a brisk spring day, or rather evening, and the wind did much to clear my moody thoughts. Holmes was once more by my side, and I let his presence fill me for the entirety of our silent walk.
He was unbelievably tight inside, and hot, and I bit my lip to force myself to last and not spend just then as I so wished to. The end was coming sooner than I meant it to; watching Holmes react like this, wanton, needy, and so responsive that I wanted to give him more, I leaned down as best as I could, one hand above his shoulder, and held his hip with the other.
He gasped and moved his head to the side and pulled the collar of his nightgown down and over, opening up more of his skin, down to his collarbone. ‘There,’ he rasped, and I understood and latched on, sucking and nibbling until I was sure a mark would be left. He lay there gasping and whimpering, twitching his hips upwards against mine; I pressed one hand to his good hip and held him there, moving further down to latch onto his exposed nipple.
He nodded, eyes still closed, and when I stood from the couch (masking a grimace), I watched him turn himself to his good side and stretch the length of the couch. As it was, it was far too short for him, but he didn’t seem to mind terribly; he snuffled into the back of the couch and exhaled loudly. I pet his shoulder once more and meandered to the poor excuse of a kitchen to make tea. I was quite accustomed to wasting tea at Holmes’s expense, I mused as I drank my newly cold cuppa and poured his out. How nice it was to have his tea to waste at all — for so long now I hadn’t had the chance.
I let the silence spin out, the implication of what he was saying surrounding us. Then, softly: ‘The answer is yes, Holmes.’
‘To Mycroft and Mrs Hudson.’ He took another bite. I blinked at him, his words catching up to me slowly.
‘They could never know what you really are,’ I replied, trying for bravado but it only came out hushed and awed. ‘Not to me.’
, Watson!’ He turned to me and offered his hand. ‘But our day is not over — I have plans for you yet.’
I smirked and stood again, rounding the table and bending over. He lifted his head just as I kissed him, right on the lips, like I had wanted to do for what seemed like lifetimes. Holmes was a man most understanding of actions, and this was one action I would happily repeat every day of my life, if it meant he could comprehend the vast depths of my love for him.
