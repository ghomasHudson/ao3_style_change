Castiel’s hands wandered sensually over Dean’s back and sides, leaving sensitive echoes of contact on his skin. Dean could feel the heat of labored breath on his neck and back. And those hands,
. Maybe he just wasn’t cut out for the domestic life.
“Dean—
“Yep, that sounds about right,” Charlie said with certainty.
“Yeah?”
Castiel’s hand covered his mouth in surprise as he looked up to where John and Dean were standing side-by-side watching him.
he wondered.
the DJ said as the unmistakable notes of Ginuwine’s Pony started playing.
“Cas,” Dean said pointedly. “How long have you been standing there?”
There was a quiet creak behind them, though, each too distracted by the other, neither of them heard it.
“You were all in on this?” Castiel asked, his excitement still buried in awe.
The two settled at a table near the windows that overlooked a small courtyard, delving into the lasagna. “Mmph, I really need to learn to cook,” Castiel sighed after his first bite. “This is amazing.”
Dean raised his brow at her tone. “Um… sure? How about Sunday so I can get all the details about—” He lifted his chin toward Jo and winked.
“Huh.”
In a much better mood, he changed into a clean shirt and waved goodbye to the guys. He climbed into the Impala and steered it out of the parking lot. It didn’t matter what Lisa wanted, because at the end of the day he’d be sharing pie with Castiel Novak.
boys anymore. We stopped being
, he thought angrily.
Dean scrubbed a hand down his face and leaned forward, elbows on his knees and head hanging. “What the hell do I tell my dad?”
“Meg!” Dean said brightly.
He was right. With everything that happened, Castiel hadn’t even thought to ask before, but now he needed to know. “What happened when you met with Lisa?”
He spotted another angel a few minutes later, though this one was much smaller—a silver pendant. This angel had dark wings and dark hair, and Dean imagined that, in color, this angel probably had piercing blue eyes. He didn’t look delicate like the weeping angel. This angel was a protector—a shield. He was a guardian angel. Dean reached out for the pendant, rubbing a thumb over the engraving as if committing it to memory, then held it closer to read the small inscription on the back.
. He had tried to bide his time, taking longer than necessary to carefully sculpt his hair, meticulously choosing an outfit, going with a steel-gray V-neck under a black jacket and his best fitting dark-wash jeans. But even wasting time as he had, his eagerness found him pacing the floor, just waiting for time to tick by so that he could head over to Castiel’s building.
“What can I say? He’s irresistible,” Dean answered, handing the coffee mug to Castiel.
Castiel nodded and for the next few minutes busied himself by forming the burgers while Dean cleaned his hands and put away the rest of the groceries.
expected was the lone queen-sized four-post bed. Dean stared at it for a moment too long before Cas stepped up beside him.
There was a long moment of silence between them before Lisa spoke up again.
“Yeah, more of a project, really. Do you think—is there any chance you’d come by the house today? I could really use your input.”
“Dean—,” he began with a laugh, but he was promptly cut off.
“Um, Cas, would you, uh, wanna go to the Roadhouse Christmas party? It’s Friday night, right Ellen?” She nodded. “Everyone’ll be there.”
Gabriel hurried off to find Dr. Hendricks, leaving Dean to stare into those blue eyes he already missed so much.
“The way to a man’s heart is through is stomach,” Dean answered, sounding much bolder than he felt. He held his breath as he nervously awaited a response.
He perched on the edge of Castiel’s bed. The movement of the mattress and the creak of the old springs must have alerted Cas to his presence, because he slid to one side, holding the blanket up for Dean to slide in. Without a word, Castiel wrapped Dean into his arms. As Dean lay in the arms of the angel that rescued him from Hell, he knew that this was his safe place. Home.
Castiel looked at him curiously but shrugged. “Okay.”
Cas grinned. “I think it’s charming.”
Dean rolled languidly off top of Castiel, staring at him with stars in his eyes. Once Castiel caught his own breath and regained movement of his limbs, he retrieved a damp towel from the bathroom, first cleaning himself up and then perching on the edge of the bed to carefully clean the sticky mess from Dean’s stomach. Dean still hadn’t said a word but was now staring dazedly at the ceiling.
Castiel continued muttering praises into Dean’s skin and his chest swelled with each word.
Charlie bit her cheek and pulled a beer from the ice bucket. “I’ve already met Castiel here. How did you two meet?” she asked, wiggling her fingers at Meg and Castiel. Meg perked up, clearly keen to flaunt her attachment to her handsome date.
She frowned. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel answered with a smile. Dean exhaled in relief as they both opened their doors.
“Hey! Manners!” Dean yelled after him with false indignation, failing to hide a smirk as he stroked his hand over the car’s roof soothingly. “He didn’t mean it, Baby.”
Castiel’s own hands roamed over Dean’s body, feeling the movements of the lean muscles in his back and shoulders, tracing his hands around narrow-framed hips, dipping his fingertips just under the waistband of his jeans.
Lisa’s glare fixed on Castiel momentarily before she hissed at Dean, “Can we talk? Alone?”
“Sam—I—
will be staying
“I’m so glad you agreed to see me. I was sure I’d made an ass of myself at the Christmas party and you’d never speak to me again.”
Dean sat beside him, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees as he fidgeted his fingers. “You didn’t let me finish telling you what my type really is.” His tone was calm but his heart was racing.
We needed you, and
John pulled the door shut behind himself and Dean turned to face him. Sam noticed something different in the way Dean looked at him—an inkling of a softness that he hadn’t seen in many years.
Castiel was silent on the other end of the line for a long moment. “And by
Jack reached across the table to squeeze Claire’s hand. Jody smiled at them both while Claire stared shyly at the table.
He sat for a long time, occasionally touching his hands to his face, struggling to contemplate what this all meant. When he finally spoke, his eyes stayed locked to the floor at the base of the stand and his voice was small, catching in his throat.
Dr. Hendricks gave him a kind and knowing smile. “Of course. If you have any questions, I’ll be checking in again in about an hour, or you can speak with any of the nurses. And Mr. Winchester?”
. Dean felt like his entire life had built up to this moment. Here, in the solitude of a summer storm, with Cas’s hands finally wound around him, Dean felt complete.
He cleared his throat as he approached, announcing himself as he stepped into the glow of the streetlamp. When the man looked up, there was pain in his eyes. He was clearly in the midst of some mental struggle as he sat out here alone, and Castiel didn’t have to wonder why.
pretty,” he said with a one-shouldered shrug that left Dean temporarily speechless again.
“Okay, brother bonding time is over!” Castiel interrupted, standing and ushering Gabriel out the door, sandwich in hand.
He roughly pushed Castiel backward to lie flat on the bed, crawling over top of him. The smirk he received in response was enough motivation to finally bend his head down to suck and nibble at those hipbones he craved, leaving little marks along the way. His hands found their way to Castiel’s thighs, carefully avoiding his erection for now, though Dean’s curiosity was getting the better of him. He kissed just below Castiel’s navel, trailing a path down to his waistband.
“Scariest night of my life,” Charlie said as though she were having a war flashback.
“I live— “Castiel bent his head down a little, pointing through the window beside them to a three-story building about a block down the street, “—right there. I usually pass through here on my way to the hospital.”
Perfect.
“Dean, I was jealous.”
Dean ignored the question and turned on his heel, stomping out of the kitchen and down the hall. If Sam didn’t know, then there was only one other person to ask…
“See you in an hour.”
“What do you mean?” Castiel asked, lightly ruffling the short hair on the back of Dean’s head. There was a long pause where he could feel Dean holding his breath.
“Thank you? But why—”,
The second morning Dean found himself lingering in the doorway, he’d meant to call Cas to the kitchen for breakfast. They’d been on the road for twelve days, and they’d all been exhausted when they arrived back at the bunker. Being there, all together, safe and happy, made the place almost feel like home.
He wallowed in his thoughts as he waited in silence. When Dean and Gabriel finally emerged from the door, he bolted to his feet. Sam was at his side in an instant with Jess at his elbow.
Cas nodded again and disappeared back through the door. Dean turned the radio off, pulled his damp shirt back on, and finished drying Baby in silence.
She squeezed his hand as she looked him up and down. “Wow look at you. You look great. Happy is a good look on you.”
“What? Why?” Jess looked offended at the idea.
They both stopped walking and Dean had seemingly lost the ability to speak. He watched as Cas stuck his fingers into his hair in frustration, making it stand even more than it usually did.
He thought he probably sounded pathetic, but the answering smile that Castiel gave him made him forget any doubts he’d had.
“Meg, the girl you went on a ‘date’ with, Meg?”
secret was going to stay a secret for a while longer. He twirled the towel seductively as he headed back over to Baby.
thing that makes you pretty darn happy.” She turned her eyes up toward Dean, then back to Castiel with a wide grin. She kissed Castiel on the cheek before standing and kissing Dean on the cheek as well. “Thank you for taking care of him.”
“Hey, Cas, you wanna get out of here?”
Gabriel chuckled and clapped both Dean and Cas on the shoulders. “I’ll let you boys have your alone time. I’ve got a nurse to ask out anyway.” And with that, he wandered off into the hospital.
Hope was gone.
“Hey, Cas. Just wanted to let you know I’m running late. I’m just leaving work. Got tied up.
“Look, this—it’s new to me,” Dean admitted, rubbing his free hand over his face, “but I’m good with it.
Eileen watched Dean retreat, catching Castiel by the arm and claiming a booth on the opposite end of the diner. She turned back to Sam with a knowing grin.
. And he had to come through for his son.
Dean flushed. This wasn’t the conversation he’d expected. He avoided eye contact but he nodded. “Yeah… he is.”
“You know, burning down your kitchen is still a definite possibility,” Castiel threatened, though his words were laced with humor.
He studied Dean’s face as they approached the door to his apartment. There was a sadness settling over his features, probably an adrenaline crash after the eventful night. It dawned on him that Dean may not be ready to be alone for the night yet.
Once his arm was free and Castiel was well on his way to full consciousness, Dean returned to the kitchen to explore the cabinets in search of dishes. He shooed Castiel away to his bedroom to get ready for work as he unwrapped the bacon and egg sandwiches he’d purchased from Donna and split a container of mixed fruit between their plates. While he waited for Castiel to dress for work, he made himself at home in the kitchen, browsing through the refrigerator and the pantry and taking a mental inventory in hope that he could cook their breakfast tomorrow.
Castiel smiled and accepted Dean’s phone, tapping at the screen. A moment later, he pulled his own phone from his pocket as it chirped a notification. “I’ve got yours now, too.” He held up his phone to show Dean the little yellow smiling emoji he’d sent himself.
“Anyway,” Gabriel continued, “you get some rest, and I’ll make sure Dean-o here takes care of himself before coming back tonight.”
The group shared a long laugh before Chuck patted her shoulder apologetically. “You’d better get used to it,” Chuck said.
Dean moved to wrap Castiel up in a tight hug as the others took their turn to survey the completed project. Bobby had moved to John’s side as they discussed the build while Sam and Gabriel took turns pointing out details that they’d not been privy to until now.
He fished his phone from between the cushions to check the time.
Dean stepped back, holding Castiel’s face in his hands, and Castiel’s eyes locked onto the green eyes staring back at him.
On the seventh morning, he placed a warm mug of coffee on the little table beside Cas’s bed.
“Well, I won’t argue there,” he said, breaking free to explore the rest of the room. So far, he hadn’t really seen much more than the books and computer parts they’d been busy packing for Sam. He took in all the band posters, shooting Dean an amused look when he spotted a poster of three bikini clad blondes above the bed.
As they stepped out of the elevator and into the lobby, sandy hair and flannel caught Castiel’s eye. Dean grinned as he approached, holding a paper bag. “Hey, Cas.”
After dinner, Dean planted a kiss on Castiel’s forehead while he collected their plates. Dean took in the drooping eyes and small slow smile that Castiel gave him in return. It was still early evening, but he looked exhausted.
“I, uh—I thought about it last night. I couldn’t sleep. I—I can’t do this anymore,” he kept his eyes on the beer bottle in his hand, ”Not without her. So… I took your advice. I called her. Asked how she’s been. Turns out she’s been pretty miserable too.”
Charlie gave his arm a little squeeze. “That includes you, dude. I don’t think you know the effect you’ve had on Dean.” When Castiel tilted his head in confusion she continued. “He sort of shut down a few years back… like he lost himself or something. He dated Lisa for a long time, but,” she shook her head, “I don’t think it was a good fit. Just kinda seemed—I dunno—convenient, maybe. But before that was even over, he just kinda… vanished. Work and home, and when he had free time, he’d just work
. When he thought back through his memories, Dean was always the source of the green. Even when he couldn’t name the emotion, he knew it was green. Of course, he’d been the source of many moments of blues and purples, and often the yellows and oranges he associated with happiness and friendship, but the green, that bright and bold and pure green, was always connected to Dean. The feeling of home—the color of home—was the exact shade of Dean’s eyes.
“Alright, I think Cas is just about done for the night, hm?” He gave Castiel a quizzical look to which he just nodded. “It’s been fun, but I think we’re gonna get out of here.”
Dean turned around, leaning against the countertop with sadness in his eyes but the slightest hint of a kind smile on his lips. “Let’s eat.”
Dean sighed. Sam was going to tease him about this for the next month. “Nah, I’m good. I’m gonna… finish up.”
Some of the pain subsided. But in the back of his mind, he kept reminding himself that she was just a dog. She couldn’t fix the fact that everyone around him was happy, that they would go on and live normal lives, and he… he would always wonder what could have been. The pain would never really go away.
“Me too,” chimed Anna.
He shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m just gonna tell her I can’t. I’ll be picking Cas up from the hospital after work anyway.”
“No, can’t say it is.” He closed the hood with a slam, staring for a moment. “Dean, I stayed because he wanted me here. I thought—,” he stopped short, shaking his head, “you know what? It doesn’t even matter.”
“So, uh,” he began, speaking toward Castiel’s shoes, “you—you have my number. Feel free to—y'know—use it or whatever.”
The angel just shrugged and took a swig of his beer while Dean scanned the room again.
Charlie mocked a whisper across the table to Dean loud enough for the group to hear, “Don’t worry, I’ll give you all the details.”
“Are you kiddin’?!” she laughed, preparing their coffees as she spoke. “I watched you two miss each other for months, then one morning you shared a table and that was that. Watching you two finally get together that mornin’ was the highlight of my week. And then you started showing up together, and that just made my whole month! I admit I
Bobby took a moment to let the idea settle but didn’t seem bothered. “Smart girl. Those two are trouble,” he said, tilting his head at the brothers. Charlie sighed in relief and Dean smiled, genuinely happy to see his friend more at ease.
He turned his eyes to Castiel, catching those intoxicating blue eyes once again. “Hey, Cas… can I, uh, get your number?” He nervously fiddled with his phone, setting it flat on the table and sliding it toward him. ”Y'know, for next time. We, uh—we should hang out again.”
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “
irresistible.”
he reminded himself as he killed the engine
“Why does that not surprise me?”
? I’m going to
First things first, he headed over to the old radio that sat on a shelf near the door. Unfortunately, a mostly-underground, cement bunker wasn’t the best place to pick up radio stations, so the choices were limited. He skipped the sports-radio and a static-plagued country station, settling on the only remaining clear station which was currently playing a Justin Timberlake song that Dean secretly didn’t hate.
Cas tilted his head in question, setting down his newspaper. “I thought I would make myself useful and try to find us a case. Did you need my assistance with something?”
By the time Castiel put his shoes and belt on and slipped into his jacket, it was time to get on the road. Dean hesitated, inhaling deeply through his nose and releasing a long huff in an attempt to settle his nerves.
He considered ignoring the call, but with everything going on with Dean and Castiel, he ultimately slid his thumb over the screen and answered.
,” Sam said, stressing each word.
“C’mon, Sam,” Dean said more seriously now. “Just ’til things settle down.”
Jo grimaced. “Oh. She’s pretty drunk already, too…” After a moment of thought, she wandered off to prepare another glass of eggnog. She stopped on her way back toward them to add an extra shot to the already-spiked concoction.
“Yes,” Castiel answered gratefully, mercifully cutting off Dean’s babbling. “Dean, that would be great if you don’t mind the imposition.”
There were so many parts of human existence that he’d never experienced before, feelings that he didn’t understand. In the past, when his grace had been drained, he’d still ultimately been an angel at the end of the day, but this time…? No, this time he was human, through and through. His body felt heavy and ached all over. He could feel the chill of the air and the dampness of the early morning dew. But the part that dazed him was the sudden flood of emotions belatedly attaching themselves to his memories. There were so many, so different, he couldn’t pin them down. They flashed through his mind in bright, blinding colors.
“Like hell, you will,” Jo said, prodding at Charlie playfully.
“Jeez, it’s gonna be a long night.”
Dean took in a deep breath, letting it out slowly before speaking. “I think so. I mean, I
Jo squinted, giving Charlie a pointed look. “Make it Italian and you’ve got a date.”
Castiel’s face split into a smile as he considered the fact that Dean wanted to meet his brother someday in the future... that there would
“Fine. But only because it matches my eyes,” Dean grumbled as he pulled it over his head, though he fluttered his lashes dramatically at Castiel once it was on.
. He let out a huff and against his better judgment sat down beside the man.
“Let’s stop for the night,” he finally said, carefully keeping his eyes on the asphalt. “Get some rest, breakfast in the morning and drive the rest tomorrow.”
“Nah, you guys can hang out. I got this. Besides, Dean’s at least half a season behind on
Dean’s head snapped up. “Wait, what?! How did that happen? And why am I the last to know?”
“It’s winter!” Dean protested. “What if you run into an icy patch or something?”
He scribbled a note and left it on the nightstand beside Castiel’s phone, stepped back into his boots, and pulled on his jacket before following Sam down to his car.
Cas, I—I’m gonna—
Dean didn’t understand. What could possibly—
Dean sat up and faced him with dread. “
Two hours later, Castiel and Dean sat on the floor of the upstairs bedroom-turned-office boxing Sam’s many books. The room, Castiel had learned, was originally Dean’s childhood bedroom. There were still posters on the walls and a twin bed that had been pushed into the corner. Sam had added some bookshelves and a desk but had otherwise left the room as it was.
Dean woke up early on Sunday. For the rest of the hunters, Sundays were for sleeping in, for recharging after a week of hunts, but Sundays were Dean’s favorite day of the week, and he didn’t want to waste time lazing around in bed. Sunday mornings were his time to give his favorite machine all the attention she deserved.
“Yeah, okay, you can stop being cute now,” complained Jo whose head was leaning sleepily on Charlie.
Dean, now out of the Impala and on his way to the stairs, knocked on the driver’s side window giving Sam a confused look. Sam held up and pointed to his phone, to which Dean gave a one shouldered shrug and turned to head inside.
Cas stared at him. It felt as though those blue eyes were piercing through him, trying to see Dean’s soul, and he realized that it was quite possible that they were. As an angel, Cas had done just that. Cas had seen Dean’s soul, had made him whole and saved him from hell. He felt a surge of fondness as those eyes stared at him, filled with frustration.
“Same,” she said, resigned. “This has been a long time coming. I don’t know how much you know about John—?”
There was a flicker of a suspicious smile on Dean’s face that Castiel caught when he glanced over. A few minutes later, they pulled into John’s driveway. Sam’s car and Bobby’s truck were already parked. John must have called them over as well, Castiel figured.
“Met Cas yet?” Sam asked, drawing the man’s attention.
Empty.
“And I’m in love with Cas.”
“Well, well. I see we have a visitor,” came Bobby’s voice from the stairs. The man wore a tattered baseball cap and flannel, and though he didn’t wear a smile, his presence was a friendly one. “Hello, darlin’, we haven’t been introduced,” he addressed Charlie. “Bobby Singer. And who might you be?”
When the room was covered in darkness, Dean could feel Cas shifting behind him, sliding under the blankets and arranging his pillow. He thought back to the days when Cas was a full-powered angel, when he didn’t need to eat or sleep and spent his nights watching over the Winchesters—especially Dean. Sure, it was weird back then, but when he thought about it now it almost made him smile. Cas still had days when he could get by without food or rest, but Dean knew him well enough to see that a good meal and a good night’s rest made him feel better.
Gradually, the space between them disappeared and their touches became firmer and needier. Castiel’s fingers found their way beneath the fabric of Dean’s boxers and followed the curve of his ass to slide them down. He moved lower on the bed to mouth at firm pecs, allowing the flat of his tongue to linger over Dean’s nipples. He let out a low groan and arched his back, chasing the warmth of Castiel’s tongue as he traced the shape of Castiel’s shoulders and biceps with his hands.
Dean straightened, licking his lips as he watched Castiel’s nimble fingers work the buttons through the holes of his own shirt. Once it was pushed off his shoulders, they connected once again, flesh against flesh as Castiel’s fingers traced the shape of Dean’s collarbone.
, Gabriel Novak.”
“How do you keep the snow off of her in the winter?”
Dean took a deep breath and looked over at Cas who gave him an encouraging nod. “Okay. Look. There’s been some things—some secrets I’ve been keeping…”
Dean held the door for Castiel as he wheeled his chair into Holy Cannoli on the morning of New Year’s Eve. He’d had an annoyingly early appointment in his own department of the hospital, the first of many physical therapy sessions to come, though he had, at least, been given the clearance to use his crutches for short outings. Castiel thought heading into the bakery would be a good chance to try them out, but Dean objected. Ultimately, it was Dean’s fear that the crutches would slip on an icy patch that lost Castiel the battle.
Castiel’s room was rarely ever empty over the days leading up to Christmas, but on Christmas Day, it had turned into a full-on party. Dean was there, of course; he never left Castiel’s side for more time than was absolutely necessary. Sam and Jess had come bearing gifts—a thick and cozy blue cardigan that Castiel put on immediately with Dean’s help—and they were now laughing loudly with Gabriel who had somehow convinced Meg to wear a headband with red and white tinsel pom-poms that matched his own Santa hat. Charlie and Jo had assumed the responsibility of decorating the room, enlisting Anna to help them adorn the walls with garland and handmade paper snowflakes. Even Bobby and Ellen had come by with Christmas cookies and pie, for which Dean was very happy.
He smiled to himself, knowing what was about to happen. He turned his head to see Castiel sleeping peacefully, sharing Dean’s pillow, before making his first attempt to leave the bed. As expected, the arms around him tightened and Castiel croaked, “Stay with me.”
Dean’s lips twitch into a slight smile
“Ruby. Sammy. So, uh, where’s the rest of this group thing?” Dean asked, just as Jo reached the end of their table with a bucket of ice that held six beers.
Castiel sighed, looking down at their joined hands again. “I don’t know, Dean.”
“Okay, Cas. I trust you. Just… please don’t kill us,” he said apprehensively before climbing on to the black leather seat and sliding the helmet on over his head.
“Spanish, yes,” Cas answered. “This television doesn’t get many channels, and this was the most interesting thing on.”
“Cas…” Dean began, keeping his voice low. “I—”
The room fell into a stunned silence. Castiel glanced at Dean, slumped against the wall with Ellen using her kitchen towel to mop up his bloody nose. He and Sam were still on the floor where they’d landed when Castiel had finally succeeded in pulling Sam off of his father, though he’d already gotten in a few good hits. Bobby stood rooted to the spot, staring daggers through the window of the closed front door as he watched John’s headlights back down the long driveway.
But this… This was good. It was an unusual feeling for Dean—to know that you have everything you want right here. It had seemed so impossible.
“Of course,” she said supportively. “Is something wrong?”
“You know what, Cas? I like the way you think,” he grinned, placing two pies on top of the beer. “Let’s get out of here.”
Castiel turned, sliding his arms around Dean’s waist and pulling him close. “I love you too, Dean.”
It was his own eyes that gave him away. He broke eye contact, looking guiltily down at the floor, but Dean pushed his chin back up and wouldn’t let him look away.
They excused themselves from the table and took a few steps away, back toward the entrance.
family,” Bobby said, followed by several agreements from the others.
Charlie could see the disdain in Dean’s face, and cut him off before he could respond to either of them. “Well, I get to work in a dark room with loud music and no one but my computer to keep me company.
“Yep, she’s mine.” Both men spun around to find Jody, a short-haired brunette wearing blinking reindeer antlers. “It’s good to see you,” she said as she greeted Dean with a hug and gave Castiel a kind smile. She slid into the booth beside Claire. Jody seemed friendly, though she carried the same air about her as Ellen did, giving Castiel the feeling that he wouldn’t want to end up on her bad side.
“Cas, wait—!”
. Donna greeted him cheerfully, as always, scribbling down his coffee order without having to ask for it. He ordered a couple of pastries and found his way to a table nearby, pulling his phone from his pocket, once again staring at the message from Castiel.
, he thought to himself. “So, this Cas? Would I know her?”
“Dean,” he said a bit more firmly, though Dean continued to nuzzle at his ear, “Dean, we—ahh—should we slow down? We don’t need to—I don’t want you to—”
They pulled apart quickly at sound of the voice. When they turned, they found its source in the doorway—John Winchester. He seemed small as he stood there, his eyes averted toward his hand which was still on the doorknob.
to be with you. I
Dean didn’t know if it was the buzz or if he just felt
“Shut up,” Dean said, avoiding Sam’s eyes by making a bee-line to the coffee pot.
When Dean pulled into the driveway of his childhood home, he found Sam under the hood of his pick-up with a smear of grease across his forehead. The sight pained him, just as it always did. Sam shouldn’t even be here. He should be sitting in some lecture hall or having dinner with Jess in a shared apartment, not covered in dirt and oil, miserable.
“Don’t worry… I got you.” And Castiel believed him without a second thought.
Perfect.
Before Eileen could answer, there was a shift in the look on Dean’s face that told her that Castiel had just come through the diner’s door. His attention had quickly gone from mocking his brother to something behind her, and his smirk had instantly transformed into a smile that reached his eyes.
Offended, Dean turned to Sam, who shrugged sheepishly. “She’s not wrong.”
—and of how worth it living
Castiel’s brows raised in shock. “Oh, you don’t—you don’t know yet,” he said, eyes wide.
“I heard rumors,” Lisa said, pausing to take a long drink of her eggnog. By the slur in her voice, Castiel figured it must be spiked and it must not be her first of the night. “But I thought they were just rumors,” she continued. “
he would tell him. He was deep in his own thoughts when he felt the weight of another body sit down beside him. He looked up to find green eyes and a slight smile.
He watched with a sad pride as his youngest son spoke with Gabriel, offering comfort and kindness until the man was finally swept away by Meg. Sam was a good man. Maybe being absent from his adolescence was the kindest thing he could have done for his son.
If Dean hadn’t been driving, he would have covered his face in his laughter. On the plus side, his mind was suddenly flooded with all types of images he couldn’t wait to think more about.
“You guys are moving in together?!” someone squeaked. He wasn’t sure if it was Jo or Jess that had asked so excitedly, but Castiel suddenly realized how quiet the room had gotten and that all eyes were on them. He turned to Dean looking for the right response.
boys the day you stopped being
“Well, well, well. Here to take my baby brother out on your first date, huh? Don’t worry, I’ll spare you the whole big brother lecture.” He snapped a picture of Dean, momentarily blinding him with the flash.
They didn’t have to wait very long to find out what Meg’s reaction would be. She stomped back into the bar with a scowl on her face. “Come on, Ruby, we’re leaving.”
“Castiel!”
Dean let Lisa drag him through the crowd and into the small storeroom beside the kitchen.
“So, I guess we should—” Castiel gestured toward the hallway.
Castiel laughed but it was Dean that answered. “Sex, Sammy. Hot gay sex. That’s the trick.” Dean winked at Castiel suggestively, and the look of horror from Sam was priceless.
Castiel slid closer, leaning his shoulder against Dean’s. “You don’t know how to feel because you’re feeling everything. Grief. Loss. Shock. Relief.” He gave Dean a half smile, “Pride.”
Dean’s voice was shaky as he reached out for him. “Cas! What the hell was that?”
But this time, Sam wouldn’t be there when he came home and passed out in the recliner because he couldn’t make it to his bed. Dean wouldn’t be there to clean up his messes, the way he’d had to his entire life. And it was that feeling of regret—not that his boys wouldn’t be there anymore, but that they’d been subjected to John and his shitty lifestyle for all these years in the first place—that steeled his resolve. He would change. There was no other option. Those boys deserved so much better. Everything they’d suffered was his fault.
“What?” Sam asked with a shy chuckle.
“Is there anything we can do to help?” Castiel asked, sitting up straighter.
“Sorry, Sam,” he said. When Sam looked confused, he added, “For my date ruining yours.”
“I’ve heard you’ve been good for our boy. That true?” Bobby gave Dean a little hit with his elbow and Dean gave him a breath of laughter and an emphatic nod. Castiel turned his eyes shyly to his bottle. “Good. That’s all I needed to know,” Bobby said kindly as he clapped Castiel on the shoulder and headed out of the kitchen.
At the tinkle of the bell attached to the door handle, Donna had nearly leapt over the counter in her hurry to hug him. Castiel froze in surprise and threw Dean a pleading look as he awkwardly patted Donna’s back. Dean just chuckled, watching the commotion with fond amusement.
TW: This chapter's an emotional roller coaster and involves some major family conflict.
They spent the entire week on a cloud of domestic bliss. On Thursday night, they joined Sam and Jess for dinner to break in Sam’s newly furnished apartment. And when they crowded onto the new sofa to watch Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman, Dean didn’t even complain. It was just as Frosty was ending that Dean’s phone buzzed with a new text message.
“Well, hi there, Jo,” Dean greeted with exaggerated cheerfulness. “Something you wanna share with the class?”
“Four!”
Castiel took the time to indulge in another bite before asking, “What’s that?”
“You should talk to him, Dean,” Sam said gently. “Pray to him.”
, Castiel remembered,
“C’mon, Sammy, I’m making you your favorite breakfast.”
Dean rolled his eyes and held back a smile as they grabbed their bags from the trunk.
“Apparently outsiders aren’t welcome in friggin’ Mayberry,” Dean grumbled as they turned onto another tree lined street.
kiss, the kiss between himself and Castiel Novak, the kiss in the parking lot where they’d first laid eyes on one another, the kiss on this cold December night, was the best kiss he’d ever had.
“Yeah, what’s that like?” Sam asked. “I mean, working with kids?”
“Uh, hey. Hey. How’s Cas?”
He jerked his head back up a little too fast, but the sight of Dean sauntering into the room and dropping his bag on the floor before sliding a pastry box onto a rolling table made him forget his pain. He smiled into Dean’s lips as he leaned over the bed rail to carefully kiss him. When he stepped back and settled into the chair beside the bed, Cas let out a sigh.
A deer in headlights, Dean opened his mouth and closed it again, trying desperately to figure out what to say before mustering a “Mornin’” and shuffling off, red-faced, down the hallway.
Dean shook his head and pulled a large metal bowl from a shelf below the stainless-steel island, “You have absolutely no idea what you’re missing out on. I’m about to change your life. Get over here.”
Outside the hotel, Castiel leaned against the passenger side of the Impala, arms folded. Dean made his way around the front of the car. When he stopped in front of Castiel, the angel gave him a half-hearted glare.
Charlie shook her head. “They’ve had to put up with a lot of crap in the past. He made them believe he was the center of their whole damn universe, then he abandoned them… and he did it over and over again. Man, they were
He cringed as he thought through the events of the night.
Charlie lingered for a moment. She’d met Ellen many times over the years, of course, but she hadn’t been dating her daughter then. In fact, she felt as though maybe Ellen knew a little too much about her already. Charlie wasn’t exactly shy about parading her dates through the Roadhouse, and not many of them ever made it farther than one or two dates. But this thing with Jo was different—a slow burn, friends to lovers story that had finally peaked.
“It’s okay,” Cas said preemptively. “I’ll—I’ll keep this between us.”
“That was payback for shoving my hands into raw meat without warning me,
Dean ran his hands roughly through his hair, glancing at John who was again by his side waiting for answers.
“’Sandy,’ huh?” Miracle’s ears twitched.
“Keep going,” Dean breathed. Castiel smiled and nodded as he began sliding his fingers in and out, moving slowly at first but working up to a pleasurable speed. He kept his eyes locked on Dean’s, as he moved, drawing pleasure from the vision of this beautiful man writhing beneath him. As he adjusted his angle, he crooked his fingers. He knew he’d hit his target when Dean let out an, “Ohh!”
Dean smiled sadly at his brother, not sure what to say to the admission.
As the new year crept closer, everyone settled around the fire once more, refilling their mugs of cocoa and taking advantage of the marshmallows that hadn’t been toasted already. John retrieved an old radio that Dean kept in the garage and tuned into a station broadcasting a New Year’s countdown show.
“Dean’ll stay the night,” Gabriel said without hesitation. When Dean pinched his brows in surprise, Gabriel gave him a conciliatory look. “Dad and Anna are driving in tonight, so I’ll need to meet them when they get here. You should stay.”
“Thinking?”
“What? It’s a nest, right?” There still wasn’t a smile on Dean’s face, but there seemed to be understanding beneath his serious gaze.
“I guess I could say the same for you,” Dean grinned, though his face was surely turning red. Meg looked affronted, but didn’t dare reply. Instead, she shifted her coat and lightly pushed away from Gabriel, making her exit.
and he felt the warmth of a blush creeping into his cheeks. “You must’ve been ruffling some feathers up in Heaven.”
Sam shifted in his seat, keeping his eyes on the road as he pulled out of the driveway.
They watched the fireworks together, curled into one another under their blanket until quiet set in once more and two figures emerged from the smoke.
They both reached for the remote at the same time, Cas reaching it first, and Dean’s traitorous hand paused for just a millisecond too long on top of Cas’s. So, while Cas turned off the television, Dean quickly ducked under the covers, turning on his side to hide the redness that was most certainly creeping over his face right now.
reacted to him. He knew, by the way, that you would be the one that rejected him. He was afraid to tell you. He was so happy that the rest of his friends and family accepted him—so happy—but he knew that you wouldn’t.”
. Dean, this is—”
Dean turned to stare at the man he loved, lying broken before him on the narrow hospital bed. “Can I stay with him?”
Dean shook his head. “They’ll love you.” A tiny spark of panic widened his eyes before his voice shifted back to its usual playful cockiness. “I mean—of course they’ll like you. You’re awesome, Cas.” He slipped his hands into the back pockets of Castiel’s jeans and leaned back to look him in the eye. “Now I, uh, don’t know how they’ll feel about
“You’re doing great, Jack,” Castiel encouraged as his favorite patient held himself upright and balanced between two long horizontal handrails. The young man was one of his older patients, having suffered a spinal injury in his youth that had led to a very slow recovery. The surgeons hadn’t been confident that he would walk on his own again, but Jack had a determination about him that made Castiel swell with pride. And now, at 18, Jack was back on his feet with the help of a sturdy set of crutches.
“Date, though? I thought this was just a casual group thing,” Dean added, recounting Sam’s words from earlier in the day.
“Cute, aren’t they?” Jess grinned up at him. “I think they’re in love.”
Dean saw Castiel’s attempt to nod, but the neck brace hindered his movement.
“Home. My—your—
Once he regained movement in his limbs, he found Castiel standing before a mirror in the bathroom attempting to flatten his hair. Dean slid in behind him, lining kisses along the curve of the base of his neck.
The corners of Castiel’s mouth turned up, watching as Dean gaped awkwardly. “Boyfriend?”
Sam kicked the lounge chair where Dean lay shielding his eyes from the sun. Miracle was sprawled out on the matching chair beside him.
“Oh.”
Castiel chuckled, “Go, Dean. Have a good night.”
“Tell you what, sunshine,” he said as he stood up and tucked Castiel back into bed, “you stay here, get some rest, do your grouchy-grouch thing. I’m gonna go home and shower and I’ve gotta go help Sam with Bobby’s old truck today anyway. Once you’re up and at’em, just give me a shout, ‘kay?” When Castiel nodded, he leaned down for a quick kiss before slipping into his jeans and heading out of the bedroom.
So much had been made whole after they defeated Chuck.  But Dean was still incomplete. The one person that
Much to Dean’s relief, they didn’t delve any further into their intentions for whatever was happening between them. It wasn’t that Dean was afraid of heading down this new path, but he felt that he had a few things that needed to be addressed before he set out on the journey.
“And Dean… Dean, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I took your childhood away from you. You deserved to grieve and I—I took that from you too. From both of you. Dean, I’m sorry I wasn’t supportive of—of you. I’m… I’m glad you’ve found your happiness. Let him save you like your mother saved me.” He laughed that sad laugh again. “For what it’s worth, I like him. He gave me an earful too. Made me think of Mary, actually.”
“I have been told I have an irresistible voice. I figured it was worth the try.”
is where I belong. This… this is where I want to be. With you. All of you.”
Jo snorted into her beer, nearly choking. “Gay? Does Meg know?”
Sam knew that Dean wouldn’t have plans, even though it was Friday night. Unlike himself, Dean hadn’t had much of a social life since he and Lisa broke up last year. He knew the split was amicable, but something seemed different about Dean lately. In fact, he and Sam had somehow changed roles, with Sam now being the Winchester more likely to bring home a random waitress than his once infamously womanizing older brother.
Dean smiled, still dazed and nervous and scared, but also ridiculously happy. “I, uh—I tried to let Sam know last night, but I don’t think he understood. It—I couldn’t just—,” he sighed. “I knew it’d be easier with you.”
As he made his way outside, he pulled his jacket tighter around himself. In hindsight, he probably could have had Dean bring him to work as usual and just walked to his own apartment after, but in his own stubbornness he’d jumped at the opportunity to take the Harley out one last time and now he had to get her home.
“Bastard!” Sam yelled, tackling his father and delivering punch after punch. Castiel had momentarily stepped back to tend to Dean but now he pulled at Sam, dragging him backward as he gasped for breath through tears.
The mental image of Sam trying to squeeze his long legs into Charlie’s tiny car was enough to pull a small chuckle out of him.
Castiel rolled his eyes, but Charlie saw a shy smile. She carried one of her bags over to the tv and began unpacking a tangle of wires. “So, how’s he doing with John being back?” she asked. “I heard they hadn’t talked much yet.”
Dean laughed and nudged Castiel hard with his shoulder, embarrassed but happy. “That was pretty mean, dude.”
Sam let out a sigh of relief as he made his way back around to the driveway. Dean was dropping his tools back into the box and wiping his hands on a rag.
“Aw, Cassie, I wouldn’t put your job in jeopardy. You know that.”
“Y’know what? We’re doing this,” Dean said suddenly, though the confidence in his voice didn’t quite extend to his face. Before Castiel could question, Dean was rounding the front of the Impala and opening the passenger door.
Cas’s brows pinched into a line. “Do you mean the dancing?”
“Dean, if we—if this is something that you want, you need to do it for yourself. I won’t say it’s something you have to do, because that isn’t up to me. But until then—”
Bobby stood over John who was now laying on the floor. “Get the fuck away from my family.”
Castiel’s brow furrowed in confusion, but he followed Dean’s lead and stepped through the doorway.
Castiel said in surprise. “Do we finally get to see what it is?”
“You were such a cute baby,” Castiel deadpanned, leaning backward to press against Dean’s chest, laying his own hands over the ones wrapped around him.
As soon as he stepped inside Holy Cannoli, Donna greeted Dean with her usual enthusiasm.
When the room fell quiet again after the last goodbyes, Dean watched Castiel smiling down at the silver angel, running his thumb over the engraving. He’d never felt so sure of anything in his life.
“Pretty as ever,” he answered, moving to lean against the wall beside her. “How’s Gabriel?”
Dean gave him a playfully rough kiss on the side of his head. “Were? Dude. I’m still cute.”
Castiel had to swipe at damp eyes as he let out a joyful, relieved laugh, then pulled Dean in for a long, deep kiss. Neither wanted the kiss to end, so instead they let it turn into smaller, gentler kisses, peppering them alone jawlines and cheekbones. When they did finally separate, Castiel took both of Dean’s hands into his own.
“Mmm, so the whole family is gay, then? Miracle you two made it into the world at all,” she bit back.
“Dean, there’s never been much you’ve been able to hide from me,” Sam continued. “You do a pretty good job of hiding the truth from yourself sometimes, though.”
Castiel had taken to rolling around the place in the loaner wheelchair that Meg and Gabriel had brought over. Dean wondered just how
The next morning, Dean dragged himself out of bed and straight into the shower. He pulled on his favorite Led Zeppelin shirt, layered it under a flannel, and managed to find a pair of jeans not covered in grease stains. He wandered to the kitchen in socked feet until he found himself staring into his mostly empty refrigerator. Deciding that he’d have to venture out if he wanted breakfast, he slipped on his work boots and headed out the door.
, he reminded himself,
“Oh-ho, Dean-o! I guess the date went well!” Gabriel beamed as he stood proudly in a silk robe.
“What’re we doing?” Dean asked to Castiel’s expression of set determination.
Dean couldn’t help but marvel at the group around him, huddled in their coats and blankets by the fireside, laughing, sipping cocoa and cider, and truly enjoying being together. Dean could really go for a beer, he thought, but he, Castiel, and Sam had agreed ahead of time that this would be a sober party in support of John.
“That’s because you
“Do we just not say hello anymore? Just ‘why are you here?’” Gabriel chided.
Dean released him with a grin. “
“Dean?” Castiel tilted his head in concern.
“Hey, boys.”
He dared a glance at Sam whose attention was apparently on assembling his salad. Jo sat opposite Sam with a large knowing smile, and Charlie beamed.
They didn’t get many nights like this. Usually, their evenings consisted of being elbow deep in either blood or books. But thanks to a wild summer storm, they had decided to take the night off tonight and they were spending it holed up in Dean’s Man Cave catching up on movies. Jack claimed the lone chair while Sam and Cas had each taken a corner of the sofa, leaving Dean a snug space between them that he happily plopped down into.
“Bi,” Dean finally said, interrupting Lisa’s tirade.
“Kids these days,” the man responded with a solemn shake of his head, and a flash of a smile as Dean threw his head back in laughter and passed through the door to enter the bar, his mood brightened.
He was pleasantly surprised to see Dean’s cheeks turn pink and he was swept with a wave of fondness and affection—
He spun around quickly to find Chuck and Anna approaching, both wearing pleasant smiles. Dean dropped his bag back onto the chair, momentarily lost for words.
“Lisa, I don’t know what the hell you think this is, but I don’t want to be with you. I don’t want
“Mr. Novak’s a regular like you!” Donna chirped, answering for Castiel. “Dunno how you boys haven’t bumped into one another before.” Castiel shrugged, as Donna wandered off.
“About time,” Dean said with a smirk.
He’d tried the whole apple pie dream life with Lisa, but it never felt right. He felt like a wild animal stuck in a cage, pacing and waiting for his chance to break out and get back to his
Castiel looked apprehensive, hesitating a moment before answering. “I guess you could say that. Actually, I wasn’t given much choice in the matter. Meg works on another floor of the hospital where I work. She cornered me in the cafeteria and told me to meet her here at 8 o’clock because we had a date. I agreed before I even knew what was going on.” He ran his hands through his hair sheepishly, effectively making it stand up even more than it already did. The bedhead look suited him, Dean thought.
“Oh, Dean, I’m so glad,” Jess said as she wrapped Dean in a strangling hug. “We were so worried!”
“So… you, uh, meeting up with Cas later?” he asked as he exited the cab, trying to remain casual.
“Sure thing,” she answered with a bright smile as she started preparing his coffee. “And I’ll get that pie all boxed up and ready for you, too.”
“I love you,” he said. “I love you so much, Cas.”
to pay!” She raised a bottle and a shot glass.
asking you to have drinks at the Roadhouse with me. But Cas?”
get tired of kissing you.”
“I—I, um—I was just thinking about—,” Castiel stumbled, but stopped himself. The look on Jess’s face was sincere and concerned. He decided there was no use in pretending. He let out a long slow breath before continuing. “Can… can I tell you honestly? Without you thinking I’m crazy?”
Sam’s lip twitched up at one corner, but he was careful not to overdo it. He stepped forward toward the bike and gave Dean a supportive squeeze on the shoulder as he passed him. Sometimes handling Dean felt a lot like approaching a deer in the woods.
“What?” Lisa’s face contorted dangerously.
“Hey. Ready to get this show on the road?” Dean asked, though he hadn’t quite seemed to shake last night’s party off yet. Castiel stood silently at Dean’s side, apparently lost in a sleepy daze.
It seemed a shame to wake him, to rip him from his peaceful slumber, but Sam had found them a case and it was time to get moving. He hesitated, watching the slight flutter of lashes for a minute, maybe two, before he finally called his name.
“My type is stubborn. But willing to bend the rules if it’s for the right reasons. Loyal to a fault. Maybe a little dry with the humor,” he added with a smile. “He knows me. Calls me on my shit. He never puts himself first, even though, to me, he’s one of the most important people on Earth—or Heaven. And definitely Hell. That’s where it all started, after all.” He locked onto Castiel’s icy blue eyes looking for understanding. “He’s the kind of person that can make me fall in love with him without even realizing it.”
After finishing nearly a whole pizza on his own, Dean leaned back into the sofa contently, one hand bringing a cold beer to his lips while the other stretched languidly across the back of the sofa. If his thumb occasionally brushed the curve of Cas's neck, it had been completely by accident. The first time it happened Dean could feel Cas tense up, glancing at him with pink cheeks. Dean had to hide a tiny smirk behind his bottle. The blushing was a new thing, a side-effect of Cas’s unfortunate lack of grace, that Dean selfishly enjoyed. The second time Cas had actually tilted his head ever-so-slightly, and Dean wondered if the movement was intentional. And the times after that? Well… they were just for fun.
“Bobby’s fine boy,” he said to Castiel in a rugged but kind voice, “no need for formalities. We’re all family here.”
Bobby grunted in the affirmative. “Your brother seems happy.”
. Everything would be fine.
“Yeah, I think we’ll get to see it today.”
Sam let out a bark of laughter. “No… no, actually, it was because of me. Because I want out of the business.” He sat on the edge of his bed and shoved his fingers through his hair. “Because I’m not letting him hold me down anymore, Jess. I know what I want.”
Sam hesitated, wondering what idea his father could possibly have that he’d want Sam’s help. The curiosity eventually won out and he answered, “Yeah. Yeah, okay. I’ll come by around noon.”
He shook his head. “Not yet. Sammy’s working through some shit right now. He needed some time to vent on the way over.”
, he realized, it was Sunday and he had absolutely nothing to do today. He curled around the warm body beside him, kissing the back of Castiel’s neck as he wrapped his arms tightly around him. They could stay in this bed all day if they wanted to because,
The front door closed with a clunk, and to Sam’s terror, his father headed into the living room with a furrowed brow, looking between him and Bobby. “What’s going on here? Bobby, you got no right to—”
Castiel shrugged. “I can be dangerous.” He pulled Dean hard against him by his belt loops and pressed a hard kiss to his lips. Caught slightly off-guard, Dean swayed on the spot, gasping to catch his breath, though not making any effort to stop their sudden make-out session. Heated kisses gradually made way to softer, sweeter ones and Castiel’s hands wandered over Dean’s shoulders, cupping his face and lacing through his hair. When they finally broke apart, they stood forehead to forehead, Dean’s stare locked on Castiel while his thumbs traced the curve of his neck.
“Please, please, please tell me I’m not interrupting something,” Sam said, wincing.
“Thought you could convince me to tell you about my thing by calling, huh? I’m still not telling you how it went,” Dean said teasingly as he continued putting on his socks.
was a shitshow all its own. That damn bike…
Dean sniffled. “Yeah, well… you were right.” A flicker of a smile found his lips.
Dean froze. He didn’t turn around immediately, but he could already feel his face turning red. He was also very aware that he was now shirtless. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“What’s up, bitches?!” The cheery redhead grinned as she flung herself into the booth beside Sam, who instantly wrapped a long arm around her in greeting.
“Of course!” he said once they pulled apart. “Nothing would make me happier.”
“Noon,” he confirmed. “See you then, Dean. Go be with your family tonight.”
Gabriel sighed longingly, dropping his head back to look at the ceiling again. “She’s amazing.”
This was the hard part. He wasn’t sure how Dean was going to respond, but he had to say it and he had to hope that his brother would understand. Dean looked up, waiting for Sam to continue.
The pair sat side-by-side, close enough that their knees touched. It seemed that since they’d first made contact tonight, neither was willing to be without it for long. “Hey, Jo, how’s it going? How’s Charlie?” Dean gave her a look that begged her to be cool.
a family anymore! You’re always gone! And when you
“Oh!”
Eyeing her hand still on his, Dean shook his head. “No, of course not, Lis.”
adorable.”
going to cancel.” He placed a small kiss on Dean’s neck. “You’re
It was only a few blocks to the hospital, and Castiel was used to the walk, opting to leave his motorcycle parked in the safety of his building’s secure parking lot during work most days, but there was absolutely no chance in hell that Castiel would turn down the offer this morning. They bid goodbye to Donna and climbed into the Impala, Castiel feeling much more awake now than he had when he entered the shop. His brain finally catching up to him, he turned his head, watching as Dean started the engine.
He sat on the dusty floor, alone in the dark for hours. He stretched his wings out behind him, dark singed feathers falling to the floor behind him. The weight of the warding was wearing heavy on him and his body ached.
“Meg Masters,” she drawled.
he wondered
“Do you need any help?” Cas asked, an edge of concern in his voice. Sam shook his head.
Dean grinned as soon as he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket as he made his way out of his front door and down the steel steps. He pulled out his phone and unlocked the screen, and sure enough it was a text from Cas.
Sam didn’t answer immediately, but his face split into a wide, kind smile. His voice softened when he finally said, “I know, Dean.”
“Hey,” Sam greeted. “Wasn’t sure if you were gonna make it today or not,” he teased, “you know, since you didn’t go home last night and everything.”
“Lookin’ good, boys!”
for a change, but there was no hesitation tonight. He
“How come I’ve never seen you here before?” Dean asked Castiel as Donna delivered his coffee and pastries.
Just as quickly as it had happened, they were dropped back into the darkness.
He received another kiss in response. “Dean, you—,” he grinned back at him, “you make me very happy.”
, okay? I don’t—I don’t know how to
Castiel raised one questioning brow. “My type?”
Overhearing his name, Castiel turned to face Dean. “Asked me what?”
“I see his sweet tooth is contagious.”
Ten minutes later, he was walking into his favorite bakery,
The doctor lightly pressed his hands against Castiel’s sides causing him to wince.
“Can’t wait to meet him.” Dean offered him another smile, this time averting his eyes when Castiel caught his gaze.
“Clarence here is an angel,” she said, running a finger across his chest. “We work at the same hospital.”
“What are you doing here?” he asked his brother.
—he would’ve brought Cas back already.”
He set his away message for his email, reminding his patients and co-workers that he’d be out until Wednesday since he’d be taking a 4-day weekend for Christmas, and packed up his bag. He shivered as he remembered the temperature outside and that fact that he’d be riding his Harley to Dean’s place where it would be put safely into hibernation for the rest of the winter in the garage. He pulled his leather jacket on over the fleece pullover with the hospital’s logo, clicked his desk lamp off, and headed toward the elevator.
“Surgery? For what? Is he awake yet?” Dean ran his hand roughly through his hair. He turned when he felt a heavy hand on his back, finding John standing beside him. He was surprised when, instead of shooing Dean away from the nurse he was badgering, he stood at his side waiting for answers.
asking for you to come to dinner with me and I’m
John nodded. “Looked like a Corolla clipped him a few blocks from the hospital.”
“Does it have something to do with the hot guy in the black car that dropped you off in front of our building yesterday? And here today?” He pointed his lollipop to the windows that overlooked the main entrance. Castiel nearly choked on his sandwich, and Gabriel’s grin told him that he’d given himself away. “It does! Cassie, you dog, what did you do?”
Dean scrubbed his hand over his face in exasperation. “Yeah, Cas,
“Hey, we’ll be there too,” Sam offered, “and we’ve got your back, y’know, if things get ugly. We don’t even know if it’s going to be an issue. I mean, he’s not winning Dad of the Year any time soon, but he’s never been—I mean, he’s not—at least not always—,” Sam sighed, dejected and unsure of how to be hopeful when it came to his father.
—coming from somewhere between the doors that opened to Gabriel’s and Castiel’s apartments.
“Alright, we’re just gonna take it slow and steady,” Dean said, a slight strain in his voice. Castiel nodded and Dean began to climb. Halfway up, he started to pick up the pace. Castiel held on tighter.
“Sammy?”
“So good, Dean. You’re doing so good. You’re gorgeous. Amazing.”
“Three!”
He planted a kiss on Castiel’s chest, just over his heart. “Just wishing I didn’t have to leave tonight.”
Castiel made a complaining noise, not yet willing to let go. He peered at Dean through one open eye. “Your bed is better than mine.”
Dr. Hendricks nodded and looked between Dean and Gabriel. “The tests may take a little while. You two should take some time to update your friends and family, get yourselves some dinner, get some rest. You can expect Castiel to remain in ICU overnight, and we’ll probably keep him for observation for a couple of days. One person is permitted to stay with him overnight, but we’ll have staff rotating through all night. I promise you both that he’ll be in good hands.”
Dean stopped arranging the blankets to lock his eyes on Cas.
“Start her up, Sammy,” he said, reaching up to close the hood.
“Dean, you don’t have to explain. Charlie, um, filled in some of the gaps for me.” He worried for a moment that Dean would be angry, but instead he looked somewhat relieved.
John was the next to speak. “Sam’s right, son. And as long as I’m welcome, I promise I’ll be here.”
“BLTs with a twist,” Dean said confidently as he washed his hands.
“I, uh, just wanted to say thank you. This—all of this—it’s because of you, Jess.”
“Yeah,” Dean smiled. “Breakfast. And, uh, maybe we can check out that Rose Festival before we head out.” He looked up tentatively, waiting for Castiel’s reaction.
boys, Bobby!”
“Oh, he’s great, getting big. You know, they grow like weeds. Me? I’m doing okay. Been doing some thinking...”
Castiel's back was tucked into Dean whose arms were wrapped around him, nuzzling into the back of the angel's neck. They were surrounded by pillows and blankets, clothing, and knick-knacks, and at their feet lay a precious faded stuffed giraffe.
, she reminded herself,
When he looked back up to Dean, he found him beaming. With Ellen’s back to them, he reached out to grab Dean’s hand long enough for a quick squeeze. He’d intended on letting go, but Dean pulled him closer, pecking a kiss on his cheek. A blush spread across his face. Castiel felt like a teenager, meeting his crush’s parents before his first date, but then, that really wasn’t so far off, was it?
“Dude, I am NOT going on some blind date just so you can hook up with
The others laughed, shaking their heads. “I wouldn’t say that,” Dean answered, thinking of many, many Sundays past. Though their dinners were routine, they were far from formal.
The Impala’s engine purred as it idled in the garage parking lot. Castiel leaned back in the driver’s seat, soaking up the warm spring sunshine and enjoying the breeze that pushed through the open windows. He didn’t even mind that Dean was running a few minutes late. Again.
Sheepishly, Dean answered, “Uh, yeah. I asked him a few days ago.”
“Your fella—Cas—he’s good for you.”
Charlie was drawn out of the conversation as Jo lifted their joined hands to kiss them. Now that all the drama was settled, Charlie grinned, pecked a kiss on Jo’s lips and went back to plugging in wires. Jo ushered the guys to the couch and handed fresh beer bottles to each.
Castiel quickly shook his head, wrapping his arms around Dean. “No, no, that’s not—I just wanted—I want to make sure this is what you want.”
The swirling of Sam’s thoughts stopped abruptly, and he looked between Dean and Castiel. “I… Are you sure, Dean? I don’t want to, uh, impose.”
“Because they’re not frozen cardboard served by a clown?” He crossed his arm and raised his chin in pride.
“H-Hospital,” Castiel wheezed. “Lawrence.”
With twenty minutes to go, Castiel sat forward and cleared his throat, drawing everyone’s attention.
He melted into the hard, strong body against him, kissing him greedily.
early, and it’d be okay to go ahead and head up. He didn’t mind if he’d have to wait for Cas to finish getting ready, he just couldn’t wait to get this night started.
Dean sighed. “We were missing something, Lis. You felt it too.”
“And he works with kids. How sweet is that?” Charlie teased, nudging Dean with her elbow.
“Didn’t wanna interrupt,” Dean answered, pointing a thumb at the sliding glass door that led into Eileen’s kitchen.
I know a lot of people see John Winchester in a lot of different ways, and that's fine... but for the purposes of THIS story, he's going to be written as he needs to be for the story to grow. Thanks!
, they’d sure felt pretty important to him. He already knew that he liked Dean.
Dean let it all sink in. In a dark warehouse, holding the hands of the man who had just given up an eternity in Heaven for him, it felt surreal. Castiel had made his choice. And now, it was time that Dean made his.
When he turned toward the direction of the stairs, he realized he wasn’t alone in the hallway. He averted his eyes when he spotted Gabriel and Meg kissing in the doorway of Apartment 3B, but it was too late.
With some hesitation, John nodded gratefully and left without another word. He’d managed to keep himself in control since then, even visiting Ellen and Bobby and telling them about the meetings. He owed them more than he could ever repay for helping Sam and Dean become the men that they were today, and if he were going to do it right this time, they needed to know.
There was a moment of silence on Castiel’s end before he said, “I’m happy for you, Dean. Truly. It’s a huge step.”
“Dean…? How are we—?”
“So, you’re moving,” John said, rubbing the back of his neck while looking toward Sam. It wasn’t a question, but Sam nodded all the same. “That… that’s good, Sammy. I, uh—you deserve better than this.” He gestured at the room around them with its dusty furniture and faded wallpaper. There was another minute of silence before John began again.
When he’d gone home nearly a week ago to find Sam moving out, it finally hit him. He was losing his boys.
Dean chuckled, leaning against the hood of the Impala to let the butterflies settle as he typed out his response.
“Castiel, then. Invite him to dinner, ya idjit.” Dean stared.
Castiel slipped his arms through Dean’s to wrap them around his back and rest his head on Dean’s chest. “Your uncle… Ellen... Your
Dean followed Lisa into the crowd, leaving Castiel standing alone. He definitely needed a drink and he could still see Sam’s head peeking above the crowd in the direction of the bar, so he made his way over. He breathed a sigh of relief when he finally reached the bar top. He found Sam and Jess, each wearing thick gold garland around their necks like a scarf, and they were currently laughing with another couple.
He bent his head close to Dean’s ear and whispered soothingly, “You’re okay, Dean. I’ve got you.” The twitch at the corner of Dean’s lips was enough to rekindle Castiel’s hope. “We should get ice on that.”
Another voice drifted in over the racket of the party. “Dean?”
“There’s one,” Cas said after a few more minutes of Dean’s complaints.
With a sigh, Castiel pushed Dean off of himself and he turned back toward his bedroom. Dean followed quietly, but Cas could feel his eyes on his back.
“Dean! Cas!” She bounded over to wrap them both in a single hug. The movement finally caught the attention of Sam and Jo, silver garland draped around her shoulders.
While Dean busied himself under the hood of the truck and John had disappeared into the house, Sam slipped away around the side of the house. He sunk onto an old bench under a shady tree and he pulled out his phone to dial for backup.
On the twentieth morning, Dean woke before dawn. He’d had a nightmare, as he sometimes did, and the images of Hell kept him from falling back asleep. He wandered the halls, the library, the kitchen, the war room… but there was only one place he wanted to be.
Dean let out a hiss when Castiel dipped his head. His tongue circled the head of his cock while featherlight fingertips traced a vein down his shaft.
Dean reached over to squeeze Castiel’s hand. “Shit, I’m sorry, Cas. I didn’t even think about it. I’ll try and see if I can get my hands on it. Maybe—maybe there’s something I can do, y’know? We’ll figure it out.”
The drive went by much faster than Dean would have liked. He parked the Impala behind the old truck Sam had driven, remembering that he’d promised to bring Sam home later. It eased his mind to spot Charlie’s car and he breathed a sigh of relief when he didn’t see his father’s truck. They walked side-by-side to the front door, and Castiel gave a little smile of encouragement before they stepped inside.
Goosebumps spread over Castiel’s body with the praise and he turned to catch Dean’s lips with his own again. Dean had started slowly unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt with a touch so delicate that he hadn’t even realized it was there until he felt cool air on his bare chest. Letting the shirt fall to the floor, Dean laid a line of nips and kisses trailing from the curve of his neck across the top of his shoulder. The growing heat between them was only intensified by the achingly slow pace.
, too,” she grinned. “I got an invite to Sunday night dinner.”
Dean smirked. He’d spent enough time in bars to know the effect that this song had on people, but also because secretly… Dean didn’t hate Magic Mike. In fact, Dean didn’t hate the idea of watching hot men take their clothes off
Dean grinned, throwing his bag on his shoulder once more. “Couldn’t stop me if you tried.” And with that, he hurried to get back to Castiel.
Sam smiled, rolled his eyes, and lifted his newspaper to continue reading, not wanting to watch his brother make out with an angel at the breakfast table…
“The first time I saw him, I was sitting right here—right on this bench. And by the end of the night, he had worked up the courage to exchange numbers with me. That doesn’t sound like much but think about it. Think about the way
he asked, sitting on the opposite side of the bed, one foot still on the floor, the other knee up on the bed so he could face the old tube-style television that sat on an old painted dresser. “Wait, is this in—?”
. He missed the cozy couch, the paneled windows looking out into the trees, and he missed Dean’s bed.
With a mischievous smirk and narrowed eyes, Castiel moved forward, close enough to growl deeply in Dean’s ear while lightly nosing at the hair on his temple. “
“Dean? Are you—is everything okay?” Castiel asked nervously.
Dean grinned, amused. “I dunno, Cas, am I the sexy new boytoy?”
Castiel just smiled. Dean loved his work, breathing new life into old cars. Since Castiel had moved in, Dean spent a lot less time doing side jobs in the garage at home, so when he sometimes got wrapped up in his projects at work and wanted to stay a little later, Castiel didn’t mind. In fact, Dean’s tendency to work a little late each day was the reason that it was Castiel now pulling the Impala out of the parking lot and onto the main road.
Dean didn’t know what to say.
?” Dean asked, turning back to Sam.
“Oh, I was,” Castiel said with a straight face, sipping his coffee. “I anticipated you’d want coffee and baked goods, so I’ve been waiting here for you for about 20 minutes now.”
Dad! I’m trying to do something
A soft gasp brought Dean back to his feet, shoving the feather into his pocket as he retrieved the angel blade. But the blade clattered to the floor when he saw the slumped figure in the corner. He slid to his knees when he reached him, hurrying to gather the angel into his arms, cradling him to his own chest in relief. “Cas!”
“I stopped to make sure, to check on him. They said he had some injuries, but he was unconscious. They took him to the hospital. Dean, I tried calling you—”
“I dunno, Cas. I just… I don’t know how I’m supposed to—to
“Trust me, you’re both better off,” Dean commented matter-of-factly. “Hey, Jo! Can we get another round?”
“An apartment? You’re not going back home?”
Sam laughed and pointed back at the kitchen. The waffle-maker sat on the counter, caked with cookie dough. The sink was still filled with empty bottles and empty pizza boxes were stacked on the counters.
Sam didn’t answer right away. Instead he drove them several blocks out of their way.
After an hour or so of hiding out, Dean found Sam and Cas in the library. Sam had his laptop open on one of the tables while Cas sat reading in one of the plush armchairs. Both glanced his way when he entered the room, and Dean braced himself.
Dean still had a heart, even if it was currently in pieces. He wasn’t going to leave what was maybe that last living creature on the damn planet to fend for itself. So, he put the fleabag in the backseat of the Impala.
Dean took a deep breath, trying to ease the lightheaded feeling that had taken him before he made his way back into the living room. He fell backward onto the sofa, lost in his thoughts. He wasn’t sure how long he sat there, staring at nothing, before there was a knock at the door.
“How’d she take it all?” Dean asked, hoping his brother hadn’t done anything that would come back to bite him in the ass.
out—it’s, uh, new to me, y’know? I might not really know what I’m doing here, but what I can tell you for certain, is that hurting Cas is the last thing I’d ever want to do. He, uh—he’s kinda the reason I’m seeing things clearly for the first time in a long time.”
“I’m sorry, sweetheart, as soon as they know something they’ll come out and talk to you. If you’re a relative, you can go back and see him once the doctors get him settled.”
John considered but shook his head. “No, I’ve got to call my son. We’ll meet him there.”
Cas leaned a bit toward the center of the bed. “Dr. Piccolo and Dr. Sexy are arguing over the ethics of Mrs. Beale’s experimental face transplant.”
He hadn’t intended for it to happen, but he felt a sort of bond with Dean. Of course, there was no point in pining over a straight man, although being crowded against one another all evening had been an unanticipated turn of events. Dean had turned stiff and tense against his side at first.
Dean stared, confused, trying to digest the two little words, but Castiel grabbed those callused hands again to explain before Dean could argue. “I fell. Because broken or not, I know
Dean let out a sigh. “Remember Lisa? My ex from the Christmas party?” Gabriel nodded. “She asked to meet today.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As they lay peacefully together, Dean let his mind wander.
“Well, Marla said we’d be nice and cozy.”
About three years ago, just before Dean and Lisa started dating, the Roadhouse had hired a new chef—a sweet, burly man with a Cajun accent. When Jo introduced Benny to Sam, Dean, and Charlie, Dean had reacted strangely out of character. Charlie hadn’t understood at the time; Benny had been more than friendly but Dean behaved with Benny just as she was seeing him behaving now with Castiel—shy, nervous, and a little flustered. So, she didn't understand when Dean said he didn't like the guy and began avoiding him. She had suspected his attitude might have stemmed from a crush, but a week later Dean and Lisa were dating and Dean’s negative attitude toward Benny dissipated. Charlie attempted to gently approach the subject with Dean, but he was quick to evade that conversation. And though she had been proudly open as a lesbian since her teens, she still knew better than to push a person before they were ready. It hadn't come as a surprise, however, that Dean and Lisa’s relationship struggled.
Sam stepped forward. He understood what Dean meant—he’d gone through the same emotions just a week ago.
“Yeah, I guess so,” she agreed. “Are you—are you gonna tell them?”
was God’s plan.
In the center of the garage, something was covered with a clean white drop cloth. John stood beside it, clearly waiting for them to arrive, while Bobby, Sam, and Gabriel leaned against the workbench.
liked. And if this was all it took to make Cas look at him that way, it was more than worth it. He thought he’d have more qualms about going down on a man, but, then again, he had no idea how much he was going to enjoy having Castiel in his bed.
“Promised Jody I’d help her out locating a vamp nest in her area.” He looked at his watch. “She’s gonna be calling soon.”
. I guess he just wasn’t expecting it to be so easy, so he figured you must have misunderstood what he said. Poor guy.”
Dean turned his eyes to lock back onto Castiel’s. “With all my baggage, I’m surprised you’re even here right now,” he confessed softly.
In response, Dean surged forward, crashing his lips against Castiel’s, his fingers finding their way into the hair at the back of his neck. They pulled apart just enough for Dean to look earnestly at him.
Dean planted a kiss on the sleepy man’s nose before making a break for it. He pulled on an old t-shirt, headed into the bathroom to brush his teeth, and took a deep breath before exiting the room. On the floor outside the door were his flannel and t-shirt and Castiel’s shirt. Seated at the wooden dining table and scrolling through his phone, Sam smirked as Dean scooped them up and tossed them back through the bedroom door.
“Dean—” He didn’t make it any further, as Dean abruptly wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist, burying his face in the man’s chest. Seeing a worried Castiel at his door had kickstarted his brain, and he was suddenly flooded with something that felt very much like grief.
“Wait, what? Meg Masters? Like, Ruby’s sister that went on a date with Cas Meg?”
“Good advice? Telling my boy to turn on me? To just give up the family business so he can go run off to some expensive school and piss away his time?”
Forgoing the homemade enchiladas that Charlie had waiting on her stovetop, the pair sat on the couch with the pie dish and two forks. Dean filled her in on the encounter at the bakery the previous morning, and then shopping for groceries and lunch, and their conversation on the stairs. She stayed quiet, allowing Dean to get through it without interruption. By the time he told her about bumping into him again this morning and driving him to work, she was practically giddy.
“I know you do, Dean. I love you, too.” Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean, melting into the comforting embrace.
He’d heard it enough times already. He and Cas always seemed to gravitate toward one another, and it didn’t go unnoticed. He’d heard it from the angels, heard it from the demons,
Dean watched the smile spread across Castiel’s face, and he stood to let Anna take his place. When she sat, Castiel hugged her tightly.
. He closed his eyes tightly when he saw it:
This time Dean rubbed the back of his neck nervously before answering.
“That’s a shame. I was hoping to at least meet you today.”
It was Castiel that found Dean in the darkness. “Dean!”
Forever didn’t matter anymore. Not if forever meant that he had to sacrifice now. Because this… this was better. This was better than an eternity in Heaven alone.
The Winchesters thought of Jo like family, along with her mother, owner of The Roadhouse, Ellen. Dean couldn’t remember exactly when Ellen had first appeared at their Uncle Bobby’s side, but he’d been a young teen. It seemed like she was an instant fit and she’d been around ever since. She and Jo were two of a kind, sweet but tough, and afraid of nothing.
two whole years of my life, although it definitely would
“Mmmh,” Dean murmured, sucking lightly at a spot behind his ear. Castiel began tilting his head to allow access, before steeling himself to pull away.
Dean nodded, not sure of what else to do. Suddenly his eyes widened as he looked at Meg. “Shit. Gabriel? Does he know?”
The man gave a noncommittal shrug as he slid into the seat beside Dean, smiling briefly at both, “Not officially.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck nervously, casting a look to Sam and Bobby before answering. “Actually, uh…
Castiel
Castiel nodded and squeezed his hand with a slight smile.
“Need a ride?” Meg stared. “C’mon, we’re both doing the walk of shame here, I’m just trying to be nice.”
“Okay. See you soon.”
He wasn’t quite ready to forgive and forget yet, but he had to admit, at least to himself, that John had really been there for him today—from tracking him down, calming his panic, and driving him to the hospital to standing by his side demanding answers and asking the questions that Dean couldn’t manage to ask on his own. Dean was genuinely surprised when he’d exited the ICU and found John still in the waiting room. He’d more than half expected him to have run off to wherever it is he’d been spending his time lately.
Dean typed a quick message and hit send, staying shoulder to shoulder with Castiel.
“It’s okay,” Castiel said, leaning close to speak into his ear. He could feel Lisa staring daggers at them. “Take your time. I’ll go find Gabriel or Sam.”
“Home sweet home,” Dean said as he washed his hands. “So, you’ve really never cooked your own burgers before?”
Dean gave a slight nod as he processed that statement and ducked back into the bathroom, with the excuse of rinsing his mouth at the sink. But when he looked in the mirror, there was a definite little smile across his lips. He left the toothbrush on the edge of the sink, and headed back to the bed. He crawled across the bed planting a minty kiss on Castiel’s lips.
Dean laughed out loud at the message. When Charlie opened the door he was caught grinning at his phone before he could stuff it back into his pocket, but he kissed her cheek and let himself inside before she could mention it.
“So you two take the suite. We’ll just say it’s your honeymoon. I’ll get a separate room,” Sam suggested, hopefully. Not only did having his own room sound like a dream come true, but maybe throwing Dean and Cas into the same room would encourage some progress in their perpetual state of hopelessly pining for one another.
“Awww, I ship you guys,” Jo said sweetly.
“She’s confident. I suppose
“That’s awesome, Clarence,” Dean chimed in, and now it was Castiel’s turn to flush. “Really, though, helping kids, man? That’s great.” Charlie felt herself grinning as she watched them.
Dean, now completely red-faced, just waved a hand. “Keep looking.”
It wasn’t a question, but Castiel nodded. “I am.”
When Cas woke up back on Earth, he had found himself in the middle of nowhere. He wasn’t sure how long it took, but he eventually found a road and managed to find a phone. Now he sat on a bench outside of a diner, waiting. When the Impala skidded to a stop in front of him and there was a fresh wave of emotion.
The room filled with laughter and well wishes, but Castiel’s eyes were still on the keys in his hands. He grabbed the larger key, unsure of what it could go to and held it up in question as he had done before.
Castiel covered his face as he laughed, but he couldn’t hide the shake in his shoulders. Before he could respond, Meg stomped out of the cafeteria.
They toed off their shoes and shed their pants before climbing into the bed. Their pace remained slow as they lay on their sides, indulging in the light drag of fingers over warm skin, their legs tangled together.
When they broke apart, Dean hummed, his heart filled with content. Castiel leaned in again, placing a single peck on the lobe of Dean’s ear, sending shivers down his spine. But that was nothing compared to the gruff whisper that made Dean thankful they’d have their motel room to themselves that night: “Just my type.”
“Well, first of all, it’s almost eleven o’clock,” he responded, sending his text and setting his phone face-down on the table, “but, apparently, I—I, uh, drunk texted Jess last night.” Dean’s eyes widened, but he didn’t speak. “I guess drunk Sam likes to share his feelings.”
Dean rested his head on Castiel’s chest, listening to his heart beat. It was strong and steady, calming him as Castiel’s fingers lazily combed through his hair. He wished he could stay here forever, but he knew he couldn’t stay tonight. Sam would be waiting up for him even though he said he wouldn’t.
about it all. Like, my dad just punched me in the fucking face.” He let out a pitiful laugh. “But then Bobby—the stuff he said… It’s all true. And Sam—
“Let’s go to the Roadhouse! And you should call Dean; I’ve been dying to meet Castiel. We should celebrate. C’monnn…” She gave Sam perfect puppy eyes, and Sam threw his head back and laughed, realizing that he must have picked up the habit from her.
Cas stood abruptly, ignoring the beer that Sam was holding out for him. He pushed through the door of the room and disappeared down the hallway. Dean rolled his eyes, frustrated with himself. He knew this was his own fault.
He could feel Dean smile before he pulled himself upright once again. “You like that, sunshine?”
The first time he’d realized that he felt attracted to a man, he had panicked, diving headlong into his first and only long-term relationship with the first woman he met. Things were going well with Lisa and her young son Ben at first but the chemistry just wasn’t there, and after almost 2 years, Lisa finally called it quits.
“What’s your name, son?”
Castiel’s face flushed happily and he nodded his thanks. Gabriel gave him another quick smile and headed back into the hallway.
“Cas… Heaven? The angels? Is this—are we worth it?”
“No,” she answered, “Why is your house moving?” She ducked back under the blanket beside Jo.
It was nearing midnight. Dean had driven through the night who knows how many times before, but he wasn’t in any hurry tonight. Sam wouldn’t be back for a few days, so there really wasn’t any reason to rush back to the bunker.
he wondered
Happiness. Relief. Calm.
Castiel glared at him. The danger behind that icy stare steered Dean away from the subject.
He leaned in for a deep, slow kiss. Their bodies pressed together and Dean’s hands cupped Castiel’s jaw as their tongues explored one another. There was a heat between them, but no rush in their movement. Small, light kisses trailed along Castiel’s jaw as Dean’s lips found their way to his ear.
“I, uh, think we’re gonna go say hi to Bobby and Ellen, if—if that’s okay with you, Cas?”
Both girls had to tear their wide eyes away from Dean to start gathering their bags. While Bobby collected their coats, Ellen gave Dean and Castiel each a tight hug and a kiss on the cheek. “Goodnight, boys. We love you so much.”
Holding himself just inches above Dean’s naked body, Castiel crawled back up to be face to face with Dean. There was a nervous but hopeful look in Dean’s eyes that lit a fire in Castiel.
, Castiel? Not ‘hi’? Not ‘hello’? Not even a ‘hey, asshole’? I’m really starting to feel unwelcome.”
“She set your bed on fire?” Castiel interrupted, lifting his head to look at his brother. Gabriel waved a dismissive hand.
When they rolled to a stop in the same parking lot that they’d stopped in the first time they’d been here together, Castiel killed the engine and they pulled off their helmets. This time, however, Castiel led Dean toward a short pier that overlooked the lake. Castiel leaned forward, resting his elbows on the railing as he took in the view. The sun was setting, and the sky was a soft pinkish orange. But Dean’s focus wasn’t on the sky.
“You said it looked like someone hit him?” Dean asked, trying to gather his thoughts.
“—but he’s never around anyway,” he finished.
They all settled into their chairs, bowing their heads while Bobby said grace before digging in. Dean piled his plate high with lasagna and garlic bread, even making himself a small salad to appease Ellen.
“What?? No way,” Sam said, brushing it off.
Dean was running late.
“Oh, no. You’re a morning person,” he groaned. “Dean, I don’t think this is going to work out.”
“Okay, bitches. Here are the rules. The game is Drunken Mario Kart. You each have a full beer that you
Dean sat up, admiring the naked body laid out beneath him. A sound of wanting escaped Castiel as he took in the vision of the man above him, becoming absorbed in the hungry look behind those green eyes. Dean crawled back up to kiss him deeply. The weight of his body rested on top of Castiel and he wrapped his arms around him. When their erections lined up, brushing together, the sensation sent a shiver through them both. Castiel placed his hands on Dean’s hips, guiding him as they moved together.
He let go of a deep breath, closing his eyes. When he reopened them, he had his phone in his hand, unlocking the screen to view the very real message from Castiel. He smiled.
Five minutes went by, and Dean still hadn’t said a word. Sam began to wonder if he might be getting the silent treatment before he noticed that Dean really didn’t look upset at all. In fact, he had the slightest smile on his face. And
Sam rolled his eyes.
“Deal,” Sam breathed in relief.
Sam huffed a laugh. “You really like him, don’t you?” Dean just shrugged one-shouldered, eyes fixed on the floor mats. “Dean.” Sam waited until his older brother’s eyes fixed back on him before continuing. “You’re allowed to like him. Stop trying so hard not to.”
“Yep, I’ll make sure,” Sam answered confidently. “Thanks, Charlie. You’re the best.”
“Hello, Dean.”
He let the sentence trail off, tilting his head curiously at her toothy grin. He raised his eyebrows in question.
After a few quiet minutes, Charlie slipped in and waved Castiel toward the dining room. Once they were out of earshot, she asked, “Is he okay?”
It was Castiel’s turn to roll his eyes. “Please at least stay away from the people I work with directly. I like my job and would prefer to keep it.”
By the time the Impala pulled into the parking lot of the Roadhouse, the building was bustling with activity. Partygoers were spilling outside, gathered in huddled groups as they smoked cigarettes and chatted. With each swing of the door, the sound of laughter and music reached the parking lot.
Dean pulled him into a tight embrace. “I thought… I thought I’d lost you!”
“No,” Dean said firmly, stepping forward. “No, we’re not
“Hey, sorry. Lost track of time again.”
he growled as he got to his feet and hurried to find his friend.
“You know, I think it’s getting pretty late,” said John, reaching for his coat.
Nesting was supposed to be a pleasant phase for an angel, making a home for oneself with their mate. Castiel, however, had missed out on a few steps, having never found a mate himself. But if it meant leaving Earth—leaving the Winchesters,
,” Dean answered with distaste. Sam’s latest fling was definitely Dean’s least favorite so far. Sam rolled his eyes in exasperation.
“Morning, Sunshine,” Dean said, reaching over Cas’s shoulder to set a mug of coffee beside the paper he was reading at the library table.
There was a hesitant huff before Bobby spoke again. “Your dad… He does love you boys. And I don’t want you leavin’ here tonight thinkin’ otherwise.”
When Dean finally turned around, he found Castiel standing near the door in a pair of blue sweatpants and a t-shirt. His hair was a wild mess. Dean was still adjusting to seeing Cas out of the trench coat, but he definitely was not complaining about it. Castiel’s eyes were wide and questioning, looking between Dean and the t-shirt that had apparently landed right in his hands.
Dean stood frozen beside the Impala. Sam’s hair flew up as he spun quickly back to face him, searching for words that never made it past his lips. Dean wouldn’t have heard the words anyway. His ears were currently filled with a deafening
Castiel reciprocated by stepping closer still, a sly smirk on his lips. “Dangerous can be a good thing sometimes, you know.”
But before he could answer, Meg approached their table, carrying her lunch in a plastic take-out container. She looked Gabriel up and down before turning to Castiel. “Oh Clarence, when you told me you were into men, I thought you’d at least have had some standards.”
preferred attributes.”
He unlocked his phone screen to start typing out a message, but Castiel reached up stop him.
Dean slid an arm under Castiel’s knees and the other around his back, lifting him in a bridal carry. “Hang on, Cas, we’re going up.”
Castiel reached blindly for the nightstand, producing a small bottle. After a
The last text pulled a laugh from Dean as he recalled an unusually upbeat man they’d encountered on their second lunch date that had used a sock puppet to talk to a stern looking doctor. Dean had joked that he’d been completely right in saying that lunch at the hospital was fun.
There was nothing that Dean could do. He and Cas were both awake, wrapped up in one another’s arms. They simultaneously moved, each retreating to his own side of the bed.
“Dean, we’re never going to make it out the door if—” Castiel was cut short when Dean spun him around, pinning him to the bathroom counter with a heated kiss. Luckily, there wasn’t much argument as Castiel’s lips parted. Dean reached down to hoist the gorgeous man up onto the counter.
—something to do. He wanted to help. He likes Cas. He called me with the idea, so I talked to Gabriel and we were able to get it before it was—before it was destroyed.”
“Look, Lisa, I—I didn’t know what was going on in my head back then, but us? I mean, it was real. I
“Yeah, I guess that’d be okay.”
Bobby sighed deeply and glared back. “John, when Mary died you gave up on these boys. I know you were grieving, but so were they, and you abandoned them. Hell, Dean just about ended up in jail for stealing food so him and Sam could eat. I couldn’t sit by and watch that happen. So, I took them in and raised them myself, and goddamn it, I think I did a pretty damn good job,” Bobby’s voice had a tone of sadness mixed with much anger and resentment. “These boys have grown up into good men. And if you can’t accept these boys,
. Castiel felt the disappointment creeping over him.
He shook his head. “We didn’t.”
Castiel could do nothing but laugh. Gabriel broke into a grin and began to laugh along. Once they settled, they resumed staring at the ceiling side by side.
The Epilogue will be coming soon.
Sam could feel the tension rolling off of his brother in waves—the need to talk, but his own stubbornness keeping him from saying so.
“Charlie Bradbury,” she responded with more nerves than Dean had ever seen Charlie display before.
Dean gripped the headboard, pulling himself partially upright. He rocked his hips back driving Castiel deeper to hit the bundle of nerves that had stars flashing in his eyes. He couldn’t have held back the low moans and pleasured gasps if he’d tried.
“Dean, why—?”
Anna glanced to Ellen who nodded encouragingly. “I was hoping that—since you’re living here now—that maybe you’d let me take over your lease… so I can stay. With my promotion, I’m not tied to the office anymore and I—well, I miss my baby brothers.”
“Oh, baby bro’s mentioned you. You’re the heartless bitch he went out with the other night, right?” Gabriel answered brightly. “Don’t worry, sweetheart, I’ve seen his sexy new boytoy, and, trust me, he’s surpassing all kinds of standards.”
“Cas... Mmmh, God, Cas, you’re amazing…,” Dean groaned. He closed his eyes and bit his lower lip, and that was the image that pushed Castiel over the edge. He pumped them both a little harder and Dean came right behind him. When his body buckled, he found Castiel’s lips, first hard and passionate, but slowing to soft and gentle as their bodies came to rest.
“Dean,” Castiel finally said, his voice low, “you don’t have to do this for me.”
“This is the only thing I have left from my mom,” he said. “It’s the only thing that survived the fire.”
Charlie and Jo carried enough beer bottles for everyone while Sam had his hands full with a large salad bowl and serving utensils, each disappearing one by one into the dining room. Bobby stopped on his way out holding a glass dish filled with the roasted potatoes and vegetables, giving Dean the kind of dull stare that only Bobby could—one that said everything was going to be fine. “C’mon, boy. Let’s eat.”
Cas smiled as he leaned into Dean’s touch, turning slightly to kiss the palm of Dean’s hand before pulling him back down onto his chest. Dean settled in, letting the angel wrap him peacefully in his warm arms where he belonged. Just before he drifted off to sleep, he whispered again. “Hey, Cas?”
“Dean… are you sure that’s what you want?”
“So, what about him?” Dean asked, nodding toward a dark-haired man chatting up four giggling women. The man was gorgeous with perfectly tanned skin and luxurious wavy hair that’d make Sam envious.
“The nest seems pretty small,” she said between sips of her milkshake. “Maybe four of them, newly turned if I had to guess.”
place instead.”
“She’s intelligent. Almost as passionate about her books as you are about your music.” He hesitated a moment before continuing with a tiny smile. “She’s brave.”
It was surprising, even for Dean, how easily he responded, and perhaps even more surprising was that what he said was the truth. "It's a car," Dean breathed. "But you, Cas…”
choice.
“I, uh, just wanted to kiss you before we went in,” Dean said, voice low as he gestured at the bar.
They fell quiet for a while, both doubling up on their alcohol until Sam found his way back to them.
Dean raised a questioning brow. “What’s going on, Sammy?”
“Yeah, well…” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, flustered. “I mean, have you seen you?”
The first morning Dean peeked his head into Castiel’s room, the corner of his lips turned up at the sight. The former angel was sprawled across his bed, one knee peeking out from under his blanket as his chest rises and falls in deep, even breaths. His face seemed soft, and it was only then that Dean realized the stress that Castiel wore every day. He thought about the way Castiel had watched over him as he slept before the angel’s fall, wondering if Cas had studied Dean’s face in the same way.
When his eyes landed on his brother, holding onto Jess the same way that he held onto Castiel, he had a sudden realization.
“Old people are assholes too,” Ruby added. “Lucky for me, retail means no brats, but sometimes we get the old ones bitching about prices, like I have any control over that.”
Dean grinned. “I’m gonna treat
“Let’s go,” John said, doing his best to keep his voice level. Seeing his son panic had set him into action. “We’ll figure the rest out once you’re there. C’mon.”
Castiel could only watch the exchange, trying to piece it all together as Dean rubbed the back of his neck and ducked his head. “Yeah, well, she deserved everything she got. And thanks.”
There was another moment of silence from Castiel, until he said, “I’m kinda into you, too, Dean.”
“I’ll give you all a few minutes. I’ll be back when we’re ready for you, Mr. Novak,” Dr. Hendricks said with a parting nod before disappearing through the curtained doorway.
“Dean,
Forever.
From what he could tell, the Novaks seemed surprisingly close-knit. He knew that things had been tough for their family after the loss of Castiel’s mother, and yet the family had managed to live a normal, functional life. Dean wasn’t really sure how to process that. He felt like he’d grown up in a different world from them. Yeah, he had his own motley crew of a family, but it hadn’t exactly been an apple-pie kinda life growing up.
“Oh, I, uh—sorry, I’m—I mean… nice to meet you,” Dean stammered, getting to his feet to shake Anna’s hand and offer her his chair. “Cas, I’m just gonna—” He pointed vaguely out of the room while he gathered up his bag.
The angel shifted in his arms, holding on to Dean’s shoulder weakly. “I’m—I’m sorry,” he gasped. “I had to, Dean. I couldn’t let them. I can’t go back.”
with my life! Why is that not enough for you?! Most parents would be proud!
“You’re tired,” he said.
are gonna go to school and leave this grease pit life behind because that is what
“Dean… I—I did it.”
“He’s physically attractive, but doesn’t have much substance,” Castiel said snidely, ignoring the disaster beside him. “I believe those are
Gabriel glared but didn’t refuse, so Dean continued on. He explained how he’d gotten her text and he’d been prepared to reject her invitation, but Castiel had suggested he go and find out what it was she wanted to talk to him about.
After about fifteen minutes, Dean finally slipped out of the garage door and turned to lock it behind him. He tossed his bag in the back, leaned over to give a much a welcomed kiss, and smiling that smile that reminded Castiel of just how deeply in love he was each time he saw it.
“Huh,” Dean huffed. “And here I thought you were just here stalking me for fun today.”
“Sammy, I can see it in your face. Stop thinking about it,” Dean said with a protective growl as he set the two plates on the table. Castiel was clearly alarmed by the gigantic pile of pancakes Dean had just given him.
“You’re making pie?” Dean asked excitedly. Castiel didn’t think Dean’s smile could get any brighter.
There was no sense in hiding it, but Dean was definitely not talking details with his little brother. He shrugged as he set down his tools, pulling a socket wrench out and fitting it to one of the bolts. “I guess you could say that,” he admitted sheepishly. “I ran into Meg leaving Cas’s brother Gabe’s apartment on my way out this morning, too.”
? He jumped to his feet and peered out the window that overlooked the driveway. Beside the Impala was a sleek gray Harley—Castiel’s. He wiped his hands over his face and moved to the front door, pulling it open just as Castiel made it to the top of the stairs. There was a knowing look on Castiel’s face, and Dean knew instantly that Sam had somehow gotten in touch with him.
After a momentary lull, Meg spoke. “I like him, Clarence.” And with that, she left the cafeteria.
“I thought it was bad when we were teenagers,” she said dramatically, staring wide-eyed. “But it’s even worse now that he’s not alone in there.”
Castiel knew he had to pump the brakes before they got carried away, though getting carried away was
“I suppose I do have a ‘type,’” Castiel said, more to himself than Dean, though Dean’s stomach was doing somersaults for some reason.
” Castiel could do little more than nod.
“I think I’m gonna go get some air.”
“Yeah, this is—this is great. I mean it. This means a lot to him. To us, I guess. I mean—thanks.”
“Sammy, that’s great,” he said sincerely. “You thinking about Stanford again?”
“No, Cas, that—that’s not—” He reached out to cup Cas’s face, tracing the shape of his cheekbone under his thumb. “Cas, I don’t want any secrets… Not about this. Not about
By the time Cas had translated the remainder of the episode, the two were sitting shoulder to shoulder on the bed. Cas hugged a frilly pillow to his chest while Dean had tucked his feet beneath the floral comforter. Their laughter at Dr. White walking in on Dr. Sexy and Dr. Piccolo in the on-call room (again) died down, leaving them in an awkward silence when the credits finished rolling and the screen switched to an infomercial for some miracle fix-it product. Neither had moved and it felt like tension was radiating from the spot where their arms were pressed together.
“Hey, Charlie,” the brothers chorused with beaming smiles for their friend.
“Yeah,” Dean huffed, letting Cas pull him even tighter.
“Keep your head up. Being here with him will help.”
They dug through a box labelled
Castiel looked at him pensively for a moment, then smiled as he turned back to his burger. “Hoped so.”
Castiel froze, his coffee cup midway to his lips, when he saw the man enter the bakery. He took a moment to appreciate the sharp jawline, the thin but strong frame, and perfectly tousled sandy hair. He couldn’t see them from this distance, but he remembered the green of his eyes as though they were staring into his soul. He scrubbed a hand over his face.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Castiel. He—he was hit, I think, on his motorcycle. I saw him on the stretcher and—”
“There’s so many of us now!” Charlie cheered with a grin and she slid into one side, dragging Jo in behind her. Gabriel and Meg slipped in beside them while Sam, Jess, Dean and Castiel slid into the opposite side.
His hands lifted, finding Castiel’s neck and jaw. The scratch of stubble ignited a new excitement, but it was nothing to the sound of Castiel’s whispered growl in his ear. “Dean…” He felt the electricity in his fingertips and his toes, and the bulge in his jeans suddenly begged for attention.
“He doesn’t bite,” Meg said with a smirk to match Gabriel’s. “I mean, he might if you ask nicely, but—”
That earned him a laugh and Dean pressed himself more fully against his boyfriend’s body. “Yeah, you heard me.”
Castiel let out an unsatisfied sigh. “I have a heavy cover, but I still have to come out here and check on her often. It’s not ideal, but it’s the best option I have.”
She rolled her eyes. “You two are adorable.”
Jess looked imploringly at Sam before he finally spoke up. “I, uh… I found a place. An apartment.”
He was greatly surprised when Dean turned to give him a quick kiss on the lips before mouthing
“So, uh…,” Sam began warily, not really knowing what he wanted to say. “Interesting night, huh?”
Castiel reached over and squeezed Dean’s hand. Dean took the opportunity to thread their fingers together. “Doesn’t matter,” he said. “It’ll be worth it.”
After a chorus of goodbyes, hugs, and handshakes, they finally made it to the Impala. Castiel slumped sideways, resting against Dean’s shoulder again. He smiled when he felt Dean plant a little kiss on the top of his head and turned to peer into his favorite shade of green.
He squeezed Cas’s hand. Cas watched as Dean’s fingers slipped between his own, intertwining. Meanwhile, Dean’s mind was going a mile a minute, working up his courage.
, Dean thought frantically.
“That’s the one,” he answered. “It… didn’t end well.” Gabriel raised a brow in curiosity, but Castiel didn’t elaborate, turning his attention to his sandwich instead.
“So ask me,” he said bluntly. Dean looked at him with confusion. “Ask me on a date.”
“Nope, but now I have some ideas for later,” he chuckled. “Just wanted to let you know I might be late picking you up.”
Dean thought. He took a deep breath and pinched the bridge of his nose, thanking Heaven for not taking Castiel from him.
She seemed amused by his confession, and he was beginning to think that maybe saying this out loud was a mistake. He gave her a shy, guilty smile and a one-armed shrug.
John’s hands were balled into fists now, but he kept his eyes fixed on the ground between his feet.
Castiel smiled back as Dean leaned in to kiss him. It was soft and slow at first—a promise of things to come—then deepening into something more heated.
Gabriel raised his brows in disbelief. “Oh? So, you weren’t planning on waiting right outside the door until they said you can come back in?”
“Saw this at the store. Figured I’d let you decide what to do about it.”
Castiel wasn’t sure how it happened, but in the next moment, Dean’s hands were cradling his face and his lips were pressed firmly on Castiel’s own. Once he recognized that this bliss was Dean kissing him, he relaxed into it, wrapping his arms around the man, effectively slowing the pace. He parted his lips, welcoming his tongue, relishing the feeling of his fingers stroking the sides of his face. When Dean pulled away, both their faces flushed, Castiel wished that he could kiss this man forever.
. She’d been put back together piece by piece, each handled with care, restored and revived as old parts and new came together to become what Dean and John both had dubbed
“Yep.” Castiel nodded, “Now I just have to figure out how to tell her I’m gay.”
“Where is it?” Dean questioned, leaning all his weight against the angel. “You know exactly what I’m talking about, Cas.”
“She, uh, wants to meet for coffee tomorrow,” Dean explained.
“That woman is a demon,” Gabriel said without preamble.
Castiel thought to himself
Sam turned on his seat and waited for Eileen to mirror him before reaching out to shake her hand. “It’s a bet then.”
“Dean, the weather has been great. The sun has been out, there’s no snow on the ground. It’ll probably be the last good opportunity of the year.”
Dean’s mind was a blur. He should have been there. He should never have agreed to meet with Lisa—and
He finally sat in a chair near the door, waiting for news. With his elbows on his knees, he rubbed at his eyes. He’d never expected to be here, in a hospital waiting room, in an awkward silence with Sam, waiting for news about Dean’s
Dean reflexively tensed, and a worried glance told him that Castiel had felt it too. Sam’s smile had also turned to a look of worry.
“I think Charlie’s persistence is finally paying off,” Sam laughed, picking up his bottle and taking a draw, the annoyance from earlier finally melting from his face.
“Wow,” Dean whispered to himself as he finally exhaled. Castiel smiled shyly, and
The nod was slight and the hand that squeezed Dean’s knee was warm. “I’m sure. You should at least see what she wants. Besides, that means I can take the Harley to work.”
“I want you, Cas. All of you.
“C’mon.” Dean stood, patting Castiel’s knee as he did so. “I’ll take you home. I’m gonna go see Sam.”
He pulled Castiel close with the arm already around his shoulder, kissing the top of his head. When Castiel turned to look up at him, Dean could see contentment in those deep blue eyes, flickering in the firelight. He gave a half smile, and Castiel returned it. Dean couldn’t tell if it was the heat of the bonfire or the smile, but his face felt warm and his heart felt full.
With that, he turned and left the room.
“Okay, Dean, if it’ll make you happy, you can bring me to work,” he conceded.
She shrugged again as the doors slid open, and Castiel chuckled but took two before heading out, earning an actual smile from Meg this time.
“Thinking about it,” Sam answered, sounding more like the ambitious brother Dean knew and loved. “One step at a time, though. Gonna take my life back, Dean.” And with Sam’s smile, Dean forgot about all the other reasons that had brought him to see Sam in the first place.
"How about that one?
Dean frowned, deciding that he was going to like this Meg even less than Ruby. Sam had carefully averted his eyes, avoiding the glare that Dean was now burning into his forehead for dragging him out tonight. Dean briefly considered bailing to the parking lot, but decided that once Charlie arrived, he’d be able to ignore Ruby for the rest of the night if he had to.
“Bi,” Dean repeated, this time with more bite. “Bisexual. Not gay. But, uh, yeah. I
A smirk slid across Jo’s face. “Isn’t that cute, babe? They’re so domesticated already.”
In the kitchen, Jess and Castiel were at the table sipping coffee and chatting quietly while Dean piled two plates high with pancakes. Sam leaned against the counter while Dean folded a pancake in half and took a big bite out of it before turning his attention to his brother.
He was starting to get worried, so he crossed the hall to knock on Castiel's door. He knocked twice again, but still no answer. He opened the door a crack and his jaw fell.
Dean let out a heavy breath and turned, silent question in his eyes.
He stopped in the kitchen to grab a slice of cold pizza that he ate quickly on his way to garage. When he opened the door, he gave the Impala a doe-eyed sigh. She had worked hard this week, hauling them through four states on routine salt and burn cases, and the dirt and grime of the highway masked the glossy black shine that Dean knew was hidden underneath.
They exchanged goodbyes and set an appointment for the following week before Castiel headed into his office. He entered his notes about their session, cleared his desk, and checked his phone for the time. In fifteen minutes, Dean would be in the cafeteria to meet him for lunch, so he collected his phone, cash, and keys and headed downstairs.
He returned to the kitchen and peeked out of the window beside the back door. Sure enough, Dean sat alone on the steps, staring ahead with his elbows on his knees. He stepped outside noiselessly, settling beside Dean and mirroring his position. Dean stared out into the darkness, but Castiel studied his profile. He could almost see the wheels turning behind those green eyes and he found himself wondering what thoughts were brewing there.
Castiel continued solemnly, “We’ve shared a meal—two meals now—had a few drinks. I met your brother and your friends. We talked about our jobs and our families. Dean, I think we might have accidentally had a date.”
“Hey,” he returned, staring into that face,
Sorry, guys! Hurricane season threw a wrench into my writing routine recently, but I finally got it done!
In the next moment, Castiel found himself with his back to the couch and Dean lying on top of him. They kissed long and deep before Dean rested his head on his chest. They lay silently, not really watching the television, but instead just enjoying the closeness.
“Hello, Dean.” He smiled broadly, momentarily forgetting that his brother was standing beside him.
“Gabriel and Meg are going to the party,” he said, cutting Dean off. “I’m sure Gabriel won’t mind giving me a ride.” There was a tone of amusement in his voice that told Dean that this had probably been his plan all along, and he was grateful that Cas couldn’t see his reddened face.
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle and smile at his friend. “Alright, then. So, Cas likes a family man.”
He remembered the sudden explosion of pain and the sound of his helmet hitting the asphalt, and then there was nothing. His mind was filled with a swirling fog, thick enough to block his view of reality. Peppered into the silence, he could still hear scraps of the world around him, and that was good. That meant he was alive. There were echoes of sirens. Somewhere nearby was a woman in hysterics. He heard the crackling static of radios—the kind used by the police and paramedics. And then he heard a voice, calling his name.
“Yeah, well, I wouldn’t exactly call lunch hour in the hospital cafeteria ‘sexy time.’ Tonight’s the night for romance, bro. In fact, you’d better spiff this place up, light some candles, get some mood music, do you need extra condoms? I have these glow-in-the-dark—”
“I might’ve,” Castiel said innocently, following closely behind Jack as he took five forward steps. “Excellent, Jack! You’ve been practicing.”
“Walked past pediatrics,” she shrugged, pulling a handful of lollipops from her pocket. “They were just sitting there in a big bowl. Want one?”
“Meg,” Castiel greeted with a growl, “This is my
Sam smiled gratefully.
Dean couldn’t hide his smile.
, he thought.
“Well, Baby here lives
Dean couldn’t help but laugh at himself. What was he hiding from? He hadn’t woken up with some stranger… This was
, then you can get the fuck out of my house and never come back.”
“Nope,” Jo answered, quickly turning on her heel and ducking back behind the bar before she could be interrogated further.
“Sorry, baby bro. I, uh, spoke with someone about it this morning, actually.”
“We’re in, too,” Jo said, nudging Charlie with her shoulder. Charlie nodded and crossed her heart with her fingers.
, Dean thought.
“I wouldn’t have asked you to ride with me if it was unsafe. I promise. And you know how much I hate breaking promises,” he said with a raised brow, hoping to distract Dean from his nerves by reminding him of his morning treat. The fleeting smile that appeared seemed to indicate that it was working.
“Very good, let’s turn around and go back to the other end,” he praised, helping Jack change directions between the rails. “And yes, that’s exactly what happened. The night wasn’t a total waste, though.” He couldn’t hide the smile that crept onto his lips. “I made some new friends.”
“You okay there, Cas?”
Castiel’s face broke into a smile when he noticed it.
“I like any night that ends with you in my bed,” Dean answered, his fingers now combing through the hair on the back of Castiel’s head.
“What? I—uh…” He looked to Charlie who gave him the slightest nod and a smile.
“Yes, Dean?”
Dean stepped up to take control of the wheelchair, guiding it into the bedroom. It was a tight squeeze through the door, but luckily the bones of the old building were accommodating. They went through their checklist—bandages, medication, a pillow under his cast—before Dean finally helped him into bed, tucking him in with careful, gentle touches.
He stroked loosely, drawing throaty groans from Castiel that only amped up Dean’s arousal. He kissed and nibbled his way down the man’s torso, taking his time at the nipples and leaving a pair of small hickeys on his collarbone, before he lifted himself on his arms to see those astonishing blue eyes again. He gave a little smirk and a wink before leaning back down and taking Castiel’s cock into his mouth.
“I can drive you if you don’t want to leave the Impala parked at the hospital overnight,” he offered, not meeting Dean’s eyes as he spoke.
Dean’s lip turned up into an easy half-smile. “I know, Cas.”
Dean nodded and gave Castiel’s hand another squeeze. “Yeah, I—I’m not going anywhere.”
Their morning routine was still Dean's favorite part of the day. They woke and Castiel complained about the existence of mornings. They had coffee and breakfast before heading down to the Impala. Castiel gave Dean a goodbye kiss that left tingles on his lips before they parted to begin their workdays. They texted on their lunch break and Dean promised to have lunch at the hospital tomorrow. And when it was finally time to head home, Dean couldn’t wait to have Castiel back within arms’ reach. They spent the evening relaxing at Castiel’s apartment, Castiel reading a book that he rested against Dean’s legs which were laying across his lap while he watched a tv show about car restoration.
