The man makes a small, soft noise and flops back onto the tarmac in a dead faint. To the side, Steve can see Clint’s shoulders shaking with almost silent laughter, the point of his arrow remaining utterly steady regardless.
He sighs heavily, and the sound of it reverberates around them long after his screen too has gone dark and disappeared. Steve looks around at Tony, who is frowning with his chin in his hands, and then around at the others. He watches Natasha touch the back of Clint’s hand, murmuring until Clint nods at her.
Steve smiles. He walks over to the edge of the stone flooring, where the ground sinks down into a thickly carpeted circle. Water is dripping down his arms and down his ankles, forming a puddle on the floor.
He trails off. Lowering his hand, he frowns up at the screen again. The image is frozen and blurry, but there it is. A shape. A shadow, moving in the stars and the bright, white light.
She stares up at him with her face pale and her eyes wide and anxious, gaze darting back and forth between him and the glimpses of Steve organising the crowd in the background.
He slots the communicator into a space in the console, presses the symbols for Thor and Bruce and flicks his fingers out at the free seats around the island. Beams of light shoot up out of the edges towards the ceiling, spreading into rectangles that hang in the air. They’re fuzzy with static at first. But as Steve watches, the one on the left suddenly snaps into colour, as bright and sharp as any twenty-first century TV screen, and Bruce blinks out at them.
No matter how dark the room, Tony will always be recognisable, even with his head turned away from the door. His shirt is open, half-off and tangled around one arm, and the arc reactor shines out through the gap. It’s a cold kind of light, for something that keeps the heart beating. Tony could be a corpse in a light this blue. He could be cold as ice.
Around the table, Natasha hisses something in Russian and Clint sits up even straighter. Thor’s expression turns grim.
“Of course it’s a competition,” Tony says. “It’s always a competition. Come on, Barton, get your butt back here. Lemme see.”
Steve grabs a handful, throwing a few into his mouth at once, and savouring the salty, oily taste. His mom had always hated popcorn, had always complained that it was tasteless and barely filled you up, but most years it was the only snack they could afford, and she tried to treat him to nice things – she had always tried.
“I’m SHIELD’s kept boy right now. They’d build me a statue of myself out of arrows if they thought it’d keep me occupied.”
“Ah,” Tony says. He sucks in a breath through his teeth, seesawing his hand back and forth. “Actually, I think you’ll find we’re the ones with the Captain. And you’re, Nick, I hate to break it to you, but you’re the one whose lifestyle choices include an eye patch. So if anything I guess we’re... regaining control of your pirate ship. This is an antimutiny.”
“Bigger couch,” he adds, sitting up a little straighter. “Maybe two. There are a lot of us, and Thor and Cap probably weigh more than the rest of the team put together. Item two: press conference. As in, we’ll need to schedule one.”
Bruce nods. He looks off to the side and the picture on the screen goes shaky as he lowers his arm. There’s the rustling of a map before his face reappears. “It’s about an hour to the nearest airport. I’ll need to catch a flight to a bigger city if I want to get a flight to New York, but I’ll probably make it back by tonight.”
“You don’t have you name on the tower,” he says slowly. “You mentioned it earlier... It stuck with me, though I wasn’t sure why. But there’s only the A.”
“If you don’t want me to come...” Steve begins, but Tony waves a hand and makes indignant noises before he can finish. “I’ve got an apartment. Near my old neighbourhood. It’s strange, but I’m not there a whole lot.”
“There you go,” she says. “Now mix us fresh drinks and maybe we’ll tell about all the fun we’ve had while you were gone.”
“Are you kidding me?” Steve laughs. “We were here all along? I thought we were in your super secret lair.”
“But seriously,” Tony adds, a little breathless. “Skip it. Actually, catch up on all the tech advances, because that’s important. Computing, cell phones, the world wide web, et cetera. You might actually understand some of what I say then and that’d benefit all mankind. Watch Back to the Future, you’ll like it. Avoid everything with shoulder pads, okay?”
“That isn’t as comforting as you think it is,” she says. She glances over his shoulder, nods and lifts a hand to his chest, giving him a gentle push away from her. “I think your team needs you.”
“Yes, I’m – I took my call in the lounge, so I could at least watch your conference on the TV, and then suddenly there was this power cut and we all heard
“Well, I know for a fact that’s not true,” Steve says. “If nothing else, you and JARVIS gossip like a pair of old ladies in a grocery store.”
planet to hit the sentient organism jackpot. But aliens smashing up my penthouse and shooting at me with freaky arm lasers... that, I didn’t see coming.”
“This looks like the arc reactor,” Obie says, checking the other’s pulse. “Miniaturised. I never saw Howard come up with anything like this.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Tony run a finger through the frosting stuck to the box and lick it. He forces himself to swallow.
“Great. Give me your hand. Other hand, shield hand. That’s it.” He tugs Steve closer, the chair’s castor wheels rolling obligingly, until Steve’s hand is practically in his lap. He spreads the tape measure from the top of his wrist to the tip of his index fingers, then whistles as he notes down the measurement. “Big hands. You know what they say about
But there’s a doorman jogging down the steps to meet him, talking into an earpiece that probably cost more than the bike Steve’s sitting on.
“Come on, big guy.” Clint pats the Hulk on the head and leaps back down off the railing. “Let’s go get you another ice cream sandwich or two.”
Tony says it flippantly, like most things he says and does, but somehow the fact that he is still there and still listening, when he could have walked away or – heck, it’s
He stands, because he always thinks better, talks better, when he’s moving. Pacing along the edge of the room, he raps his knuckles on the back of each chair he passes. Fury’s gaze follows him.
Tony shakes his head, rubbing a hand across his face. The ground beneath his feet no longer feels solid. The lights of the fireworks are still flashing in his eyes.
Rhodey blows his breath back out again. On the couch, Barton shakes his head and, leisurely turning another page of his magazine, says, “No hablo ingles.”
Steve sighs, coming away from the window at last. Tony holds out the bottle and Steve, with another, softer sigh, holds out his glass. “Yes, Tony, I’ve tried anchovies. But-”
Bruce spreads his map over the coffee table, weighing the edges down with empty glasses and, when nothing else is readily to hand, his borrowed flip-flops, casting a sheepish look and a murmured, “I figure everything we do with these now will only add to their value, right?” at Steve.
“Okay,” Tony echoes, holding up a hand. “Sure. So I’ll keep being a genius, Cap’ll keep modelling my laundry closet, and you’ll keep sneaking into my home to give me nightmares.” He counts them off on his fingers. “Is that the plan?”
After Bruce has gone, Tony claps his hands together and then throws them wide apart, and the schematics explode around him, flying from his fingers to the far reaches of the room. He rests his chin on his hand, twirls a finger and sits back to the watch the lights spin.
He darts to the windows that line the side of the room and peers down at the street below, craning his neck back and forth to take in as much of the view as possible. Everything is normal: traffic moving at a crawl but not immobile; street lights flashing; everyone talking on their cell phones and lights on in the windows across the street.
Steve snorts, earning himself a suspicious glance from a woman passing by. Despite the hands-free device sitting alien in his ear – which Tony had insisted is used by ‘corporate douchebags the world over’ and won’t make him stand out in the crowd – he lifts the communicator up to his ear as well. He stuffs his free hand into his pocket and begins to stroll, keeping an eye on the stars.
The man is choking, coughing out water and clawing at the strange glowing thing in his chest, but as he coughs he rolls over in the wreckage and looks Howard straight in the eye and he croaks, “Dad?”
Steve pads out into the corridor. Up here the place feels almost like a normal home, albeit one with an impossibly thick carpet; but there are pictures on the walls. Not the strange modern art he’s caught glimpses of downstairs, but photographs of what can only be Tony when he was young, standing next to some kind of robotic arm, and of a woman with his dark eyes, and of Ms Potts and Tony standing somewhere tropical, him with shades and her with an open smile.
Tony looks up at Steve over his shoulder, his gaze passing over Steve’s face and following the line of Steve’s arm around and back up to that hole in the wall. He runs his fingers along one of the tiny cracks spidering out from it and he shakes his head.
JARVIS seems to hesitate, while Steve clenches his jaw and holds his breath, and then, “Captain Rogers is present, sir.”
“Is it safe,” Steve murmurs, “having him Hulk out in here? Not that I think he’ll hurt us,” he adds as Tony lifts his head and shoots him a scandalised look. “He saved your life, I know he won’t hurt us anymore. But he could damage the tower, couldn’t he?”
“I’m afraid not, ma’am,” Steve says. She begins to frown and Steve adds, quickly, “But Mr Coulson outside mentioned my name’s on a list. Captain Rogers?”
“I’m not so sure of that.” Steve pulls the hologram apart again, slower this time, just admiring the way that the lines move and the light follows his fingers. Maybe it’s more beautiful
The room is dark, but there’s a pale grey light inching over the horizon, creeping through the gaps between the skyscrapers. It’ll be a while yet before it becomes a real sunrise. Till then, the room is lit with a blueish glow, lighting up the bed, lighting up his shield on the bed. Lighting up the
Updates are probably going to slow down a bit now, I'm afraid. I wrote most of the first two chapters in one go before I started my new job, so now I have a job and I don't have a handy 5000 word backlog! But I'm still completely obsessed with this silly fic so there shouldn't be too much of a delay.
“You’re gonna be alright,” Tony says. “You just have to trust me on this one. You have the choice. It’ll be weird and it’ll hurt, but in the end, you’re going to be alright.”
“The same council as in... ‘hey, let’s fire a nuke at New York’, that council we all know and love?”
He curls his fingers in the ends of her hair. His brain feels slow and foggy with sleep, and there is a headache building somewhere deep behind his eyes, and the final, clinging fragments of a dream of movement scratching somewhere even deeper.
“You want sincere?” Tony spits, a full six feet away now, though Steve never saw him move. “Okay, sure. Dad’s favourite – hell, Dad’s
Laughing, Steve shakes his head. “You aren’t as subtle as you think you are. Sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to...” He schools his features. “What were you saying?”
“What?” Tony says. “What, you never heard of clearing your throat? Sending a passive aggressive email? No?”
As Tony begins moving around the room, lifting sheets of drafting paper and opening cupboard doors, there’s a faint whirring hum from overhead, as if JARVIS were clearing his throat.
“You ever considered the Asgardian tourism potential?” he says, loudly, over Thor. “You’d make millions.  That magical Einstein-Rosen bridge of yours would make Virgin Galactic look the Montgolfier bros. Man, their stock has
watching Pepper, a little girl, running down to the shore of the lake, where the water is still rippling from the almighty splash. The first armour shines in the sunlight even as it sinks beneath the water and disappears, Pepper running as far as hers legs can carry her.
, it truly is, when in the last month or so he’s been able to talk about her and think about her again and sometimes even smile at the memories; and now, in front of Tony Stark of all people, his hands are shaking.
Steve feels – doesn’t hear; even without these ear defenders he wouldn’t be able to hear it over the great rushing movement – Tony tense up and suck in a sharp breath, stepping back until his shoulders hit Steve’s chest and he has to stop, gun still held out high in front of him, shining in the light still shooting out of it.
“No,” he says, eventually. “He wouldn’t have. He might use it to build an evil robot clone, but he’d want to keep it all for himself. He’d want to keep it safe.”
Natasha quirks an eyebrow, her eyes flickering to Tony, but she reaches behind her – without looking; she must have memorised the room’s layout and its contents the second she stepped inside – and snags a dishcloth. Wrapping it around her hand, she pulls the gun towards her and lifts it up for a closer look.
of it. Microfine coating of a titanium-steel alloy,” Tony says, grinning. “Keeping the touchscreen responsive was hell. Took my entire Black Sabbath playlist to fix it.”
“We’re reaching an understanding,” Bruce says. He smiles lopsidedly, if a shade sarcastically. “I’m letting him stretch his legs, he’s getting less angry. It’s as close to win-win as I’m ever going to get.”
“Watch it,” Steve says. “If we can get out, someone else can get in. Keep everyone away from the doors. If one of us hasn’t checked back in in five, scout it out, Tony, see if you can get folks out that way.”
She tugs too hard, tightening the knot and pulling the tie crooked again, and she pauses in her pep talk to curse under her breath.
“I’m just trying to... I thought I’d try something new, but there’s such a lot. Do you have a favourite?”
SHIELD’s New York base is everything the Helicarrier is not, starting with the fact that it can’t fly or turn invisible and working its way down from there.  The place is temporary, thrown together, and smells constantly, faintly of mildew. There are no windows in the conference room.
“Well, all right then,” Steve mutters. He picks up the mic and says, after a moment’s self-conscious pause, “Hello?”
“Your Reed Richards or my Reed Richards?” Tony asks. He’s fiddling with a tiny pair of pliers and an even tinier circuit board. “Hang on – put your finger here.”
Steve sits, and scrubs a hand across his face, and draws in a deep breath. When he looks up again, Tony is still sitting hunched at his desk, back to Steve, holding onto himself. He doesn’t move while Steve is working his way through his regime of push-ups and chin-ups. He doesn’t move while Steve picks his way through a clammy microwave pizza. He doesn’t move while Steve lies down and goes to sleep. He doesn’t move at all.
In his ear, Tony clears his throat. Steve blinks, realises he’s been staring up at the sky in silence and he doesn’t know for how long. His neck doesn’t hurt, because he’s a super soldier, but it feels as if it
Steve pauses, casting around for information. He stares up at the monitors. It must mean something. “Central Park,” he says. “Just keep an eye on Central Park.”
“Would you look at that?” Tony flicks the lights off and on a few times. “Must’ve been Pepper’s idea. She thinks it’s more homely not having to constantly rely on the whims of a sarcastic robot butler.”
“Yes, you! Jesus Christ, Steve.” Tony rounds on him, his arms flung wide. “Running off to play hero to an audience of Mr. O’s finest and his all-seeing neighbourhood watch is stupid enough, but doing all that when you know people want to
“Is this what the twenty-first century is? Always doubting what people say, never being sincere? What the hell
The Hulk snorts, heaving the car up onto his shoulder as easily as if it were a punching bag. It shakes and creaks. Without the Hulk sitting on it, Steve can just about make out bite marks in the bumper.
Tony is four and standing naked at the end of the corridor, shaking, staring at another little boy standing in front of daddy’s study door. When daddy shouts, he runs away, until a hand takes hold of his and a friendly voice says, “Hey, hey, it’s okay now. Come with me, I’ll tell you a story.”
Howard Stark looks about twenty years younger than Tony. Howard Stark’s red car looks more like a spaceship.
“I’d say don’t forget about the ice problem,” the third Tony says, lifting up his faceplate and scratching his nose, “but we all know we’re gonna forget about the ice problem.”
“What?” Tony says. “You look like you just saw a ghost kick a puppy. Am I wearing a white sheet and abusing animals here?”
Steve clenches his fists and draws in a breath, but whatever he’s going to say is drowned out by that first great roll of thunder, that incoming storm.
“It didn’t.” He touches her hand. “Come on, it takes more than that to stop me. I survived an alien invasion. Loki threw me through a window. And then there’s the palladium poisoning, and Hammer, and
“Be careful,” Steve warns as he begins to pick his way through the mess. “Looks like it could all collapse any second. Tony?” He glances back. Tony hasn’t moved from his place in the doorway.
. With his safety goggles and his neat white lab coat and the clipboard in his hands, he looks like a real boy at last.
my point. I’m a futurist, and I have more PR experience in my pinkie finger than the rest of you put together. I can see how this is gonna go. Opinion sours, the shine wears off, and pretty soon all our little Thors and Thorettas will start asking the difficult questions. Things like, oh, I don’t know...”
They reach the bottom of the stairs. Behind them the flight was folding back up, the facade of tarmac slotting into place to leave no trace behind. They’re left in a short expanse of corridor, brickwork at one end and rock face at the other.
“I’ve got a communicator app installed in my suit,” he says, “but I have to check how high altitudes affect the sound quality. Need someone to stand on the ground and listen to me talk.”
Agent Romanoff makes the noise that sounds like laughter again. Unpicking the final knot, Steve grins down at his boot.
“Agent.” Steve nods back. “Good to see you again. How are you? And Natasha? She’d injured her arm last time I saw her.”
“Wait. Tony--” Steve follows him down the stairs into the half-light – the walls are brick but covered in the same glowing nanite fluid as the cave. “This could be dangerous. Get behind me. We don’t know who or what’s still down there.”
The view tilts wildly again, settling on the idle spin of a ceiling fan, and over the speakers they hear the girl’s voice, fading away into the distance as she shouts, “
Thor next to him, still in his cape; Romanoff is sitting neatly on Thor’s other side with Barton next to
“What are you-? Tony!” Steve shouts, running after him. The wind drags him forwards. Papers are blowing in the air, screwdrivers rolling across the floor, the light is twenty feet away and ten feet across – six – three – one foot – an inch –
Tony hums thoughtfully into his ear. “That doesn’t surprise me either,” and then there’s the sound of something exploding in the background and Tony breathes, “Oh, now
The boy looks up. He looks over daddy’s shoulder and right at Tony. His eyes are red and wet, his nose is streaming. He laughs wildly.
When Steve looks back through the elevator doors, Pepper is still standing behind her desk, her arms crossed loosely over her stomach, watching him. Steve hesitates.
“Okay, let’s cut the formalities. Can we do that? I think I’m having an allergic reaction. Call me Mr Stark again and I’ll break out in hives. Nobody wants that. Why are you smiling? No,” he adds, just as quickly, waving his free hand. “Don’t answer. Keep the Captain America mystique.”
“I feel like a babysitter here,” Tony says, shaking his head in disbelief. “You’re giant, muscular children. Here, go nuts, I’ve got another packet. Eat popcorn while you watch popcorn. Who needs the movies, right?”
“Of course, even the fortune of our host pales in comparison to the wealth of fair Asgard, where the streets are paved with gold and mead runs like water. But what he lacks in riches, he makes up for in Midgardian sorcery. Behold!” Beaming magnanimously, Thor presses a button on the microwave and, as the door springs open, pulls out a bag of fresh popcorn. “See how the grains have ‘popped’ and yet the magic box contains no flame!”
Tony looks between them, then looks down at his Avengers communicator. Nothing happens when he thumbs the corner. Cursing, he tugs his cell out of his pocket and stares down at that too; it’s dark and unresponsive, a useless little rectangle of plastic.
Clint shrugs, unconcerned, and Natasha nods. She lowers the gun back down to the worktop and raises her eyebrows, leaning forwards on her forearms.
Tony huffs out a breath of laughter. He pats Steve on the chest – sock still on his hand, masking the feel of his fingers but not the warmth of them – and then he takes a step back, turning away from Steve.
Steve stares down at it. He tugs the paper out of Tony’s hands and lifts it up to his face. The drawing has definitely got four wheels, but that’s about all he can say for certain.
“Hey, where you up to now? In the seven decade catch-up, I mean. You must be in the eighties by now, right?”
wasn’t invited to the alien invasion party either. Consultation only. By pure coincidence the invasion came via my rooftop garden.”
Stepping forwards, Steve cautiously lifts his hands and draws them apart and he can’t suppress his burst of laughter as the lights respond to his motions, the diagram expanding and then – as he quickly claps his hands together again – just as quickly retracting.
Outside, over the sound of the rain still going strong, there’s a metallic thump, followed by a whirring noise.
He listens to Bucky pause and breathe and then leave. He wiggles his fingers, which hurts, but only barely now, lost in the comfortable haze of Mr Barnes’ borrowed whiskey. The bedsprings creak next to him, beneath the weight of another body.
“I’m in the lobby,” she says. She breathes out slowly. Some of the tension eases from around her eyes. “But I’m fine. We’re all fine.”
It startles a laugh out of her. Her shoulders relax, drooping low, and then she bites her lip and turns her head away. She unwinds her hair from his fingers as gently as if she were untying a knot.
The wires crawl up and down his body, attached to sensors, branching out from the arc reactor at the centre of it all. He can feel them tingle against his skin in time with his magnetic pulse. Metal veins for a metal heart.
Tony is thirty-five and standing in the corridor, in the shadows, where he can watch the four-year-old disappear, the empty bathrobe falling suddenly to the ground and all ten of Howard’s fingers curling into fists.
“It still happened though, didn’t it? Stark didn’t say best thing I’ve shot that I was definitely aiming for.”
, and Steve turns around just in time to see Bruce Banner flop down onto the grass by the ice cream stand.
a big metal disc. Throwing as hard as he can is pretty darn hard. Even Tony falls silent to watch it sail through the air and hit the wall. It bounces off and clatters onto the floor, the sound echoing through the workshop.
As an afterthought, he kicks the forgotten tranq gun away. When he turns, the remaining – now slightly singed – soldiers raise their own guns to point at his chest. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve watches Billy and Teddy watching him.
Behind them, there’s a strange sucking noise – like someone trying to drink the very last dregs of their milkshake through a straw – and a few people shout in surprise as the air seems to
“…Hi?” says the same tinny little voice from other night, recognisable now as Peter Parker. Steve grins. “Is that… T?”
“Do you think your brother could be behind this, Thor?” says Clint, voice low. “Couldn’t keep his portal open first try, so he has another go with another device?”
“Iceland,” Tony says, turning his attention back to the ceiling. “You ever been? It’s actually not that icy. Someone should report them. False advertising of an entire island, very illegal. But, uh – good air there. It’s good the lungs, right? So Pep’s literally gone for some breathing space.”
At the sound of Steve’s laughter, Tony swivels around to stare at him incredulously, until he too begins to smirk. It looks a little pained, but it’s there, all the same.
“Good. Great. Tada,” he adds, pinching the base of his paper airplane tight and holding it up between finger and thumb.
“I mean you no offence, Tony. He has wronged you and your planet gravely, and that can never be undone. But Loki... he is young, and Asgard is changing. I too once sought out battle in the stars and thought it glorious, and I was older than he.”
He watches Steve for a moment longer, and then turns back to Romanoff. The corners of her mouth twitch upwards while she watches Bruce regain control of his lungs.
He says it softly, as though he means it. It’s that, probably, that makes Tony open his mouth again, not quite sure what he’s going to say until he’s saying it.
“I should probably let Fury know,” Tony murmurs. “At some point. God knows I’ve got the coolest powers of the lot of you.”
He’s peripherally aware of Steve huffing out a breath – part sigh, part laughter – while Tony turns his attention to the other cuff. Steve takes hold of the wrist Tony shoved under his nose, gently straightens the cuff and twists the cufflink tightly closed. It clicks when it locks, magnetically, into place.
“I copy. We’re not on fire,” Steve responds right away, sounding a little amused. His voice is close and clear despite the hubbub of raised voices in the background. Tony relaxes at the sound of it. He climbs down from their stage, waves his hands at Barton and Bruce and mouths, “it’s Cap.”
Steve picks his shield up again, checking carefully for scratches or scorch marks in the paintwork. He rubs it down with the cuff of his sweatshirt again as he crosses the room, back to Tony at his desk.
Tony obeys, slumping down onto the cot. He’s back out like a light. Steve stares down at him, still feeling that helplessness. Had his Tony Stark ever been this lonely? He doesn’t know. He'd never asked.
“So I lose two years and you think we need introducing?” He snorts, lets himself sink back down onto his bed. Maybe Stark froze him again. Hell, maybe they held Steve’s trial without him and he’s in Stark’s latest prison. “I’d ask if you were out of your mind, but…”
.” Tony jostles Thor out of the way to take a look at the flashing, green digits on the front of the microwave. “Huh, precisely fourteen days ago. You wrote it on your calendar, didn’t you? You went home and counted forwards two weeks and wrote ‘come visit Tony Stark’ on your calendar.”
But Tony takes the magnet from him, slowly, and he closes his fingers around it. With a satisfied nod, Steve rolls over and turns back to his tiger. He colours the background in green, adding giant tropical leaves in every shade of blue, and green, and yellow he can find. He hears, after a little while, the scratch of Tony’s pencil picking up again.
There’s a soft click and then the ground sinks in on itself, the tarmac rattling and clicking as it folds into a flight of stairs, descending under the alley into darkness. With a faint smile, Tony draws his hand out of his pocket to reveal his car keys, his thumb still pressed over one of the buttons on the key chain.
“They come in boxes,” Tony says. “Good with milk, better dry. Traditionally eaten with spoons. I mean, what, what do you want from me here? A research proposal?”
He wonders, briefly, what it feels like to have a body that is strong because you trained it to be strong, that is graceful because you learned grace.  He wonders, briefer, if Natasha learned to dance. He’s startled from his thoughts by sudden movement, as Tony spins around to face him again and grabs the repulsor blast from Steve’s lax hands.
Tony shoots him a startled look. “What? I fit right in. Look at me. I’m practically the twenty-first century personified. Okay, with more robots than most, but-”
“Thor?” Ms Potts suggests. She reaches the bottom of the stairs and drops her armful of towels onto the floor, staring up at Steve with her hands on her hips. “You can’t stay in those wet clothes. I know Captain America isn’t meant to get sick, but I’d rather not test the theory. We’ll need to... do something.”
Ms Potts makes a face that Steve can clearly read, for all he only met her a few hours ago; it spells out, in her raised eyebrows and pursed lips, that whoever picks this mess up it certainly won’t be her. Tony chooses to ignore it.
“Well, T normally only contacts us once or twice a month, so if he’s getting in touch this soon after last time there must be something happening? Something going down? Shit that might even be in the process of getting real?”
He sighs, turning away from Tony, rubbing the back of his neck as he looks around the space they’ve cleared in Tony’s workshop. His feet shift back and forth as if he wants to walk away.
He walks through into the bright, blue light of a fully-body scan. He holds himself still until it’s scanned him from head to toe, and then he swats the lingering beams of light away.
Down on the street below, tourists are starting to look up at the disturbance, pointing and raising their cameras. Steve smiles at them, waving awkwardly.
He motions and Tony leaps forward eagerly, tugging the zipper down, his mouth running a mile a minute while he digs into the bag.
It’s dark, but the cave is glowing once again in the pallid light of the nanite scaffolding and the legion of television screens. Steve rolls over, craning to look up at the surveillance console. He can make out the dark shape of what can only be Tony, slumped over it. There is a crackling noise coming from the radio.
She drops her expression of blank innocence just long enough to smirk across at him over Thor’s bowed head.
Steve has moved his hand and passed the towel before Tony’s words catch up with him. “Wait, what are we doing here--?” he begins, but Tony has already plunged the screwdriver into his forearm.
The shot rings out with a boom like they’re standing in the middle of a thunder cloud, even with the ear defenders in place. There’s a flash of white light that envelops Steve’s vision, forcing his eyes to squeeze shut. The light echoes behind his eyelids and he feels the air ripple with a rush of movement, feels the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Squinting through his eyelashes, he makes out a great ball of energy streaming from the gun barrel, trailing fiery blues and reds in a comet’s tail and expanding, expanding as it rushes across the room.
,” Steve says, and he’s halfway through the sentence when he realises he’s about to cry. It’s absurd. He clenches his jaw tightly, twists his head away from Tony to glare out over the city and stamp on this sudden surge of grief. It’s
He cuts himself off, swallowing quickly, before he adds, “Maybe if she’d just had someone fighting for her.”
“Listen,” he says, speaking quickly, “you’re gonna have to trust me. Him. The other one. I dunno if I’m breaking the rules here or if my you – future you - had this same little chat, but screw it. Let’s be the masters of our temporally fucked universe, just this once. Trust him.”
Tony looks up at him. “Are you? How sure? And are you sure that’s sure enough? Bastards abuse power, and I’m saying that from a takes one to know one viewpoint.”
, she does. Pepper’s a powerhouse - a whirlwind of organisation with an iron fist. She runs the company so hard it’d probably make even my old man weep with joy, and god knows
Steve freezes. Tony is already walking away, back towards the road and then onwards to Steve doesn’t know where. A place where he can disappear. Steve knows he can’t let that happen. He jogs after Tony, catching him by the elbow as Tony weaves through the trees. Streetlights shining through the branches.
“Maybe.” Tony tilts his head slightly, turned so that Steve can see the corner of his eye and of his smile.  “Maybe I should.”
“Wait,” Tony says, his voice muffled in his hands. “I need a sample of your DNA. For the shield. Don’t worry, I’m not going to extract the serum,” he adds. He lifts his head and eyes Steve plaintively. “I’ve learned that particular lesson. This does the opposite. I code the shield so it responds only to you. If it ever falls into Osborne’s hands, all it’d be good for is a paperweight.”
Hands full, Steve jerks his chin towards Iron Man, flying low and visible and better than any street sign.
“I rarely see eye to eye with our esteemed captors, but in this instance I think I can understand their reaction.”
The smile drops from Thor’s face. He sits down on a stool and rests his chin on his hand, cape pooling on the ground around his feet. He looks, for a moment, as grave and as ancient as a statue. After a pause, and a heavy sigh, he says, “Nay, he is not well, he is troubled. There is a darkness to his thoughts and a shadow in his eyes. He has become blind to how his family loves him and that cage, I fear, is stronger even than the prison we must keep him in.”
“Come, let us feast and be merry with your vodka and baked delights. Now is the time to relive our great victories, not dwell in darkness, for Jane has returned to us!”
“-and you don’t want to be,” Natasha continues coolly, cutting Tony off. He snaps his mouth shut. “Neither of you do. But if Fury sent us - the Avengers after every little threat, that’s what you’d become. So we wait.”
“Mom took me to Breezy Point a few months before she passed,” he says. “I could go for another visit.”
“Yessir,” Teddy says. He tugs at Billy’s sleeve until Billy nods and mumbles his thanks. The two of them melt away into the trees. They’re smart kids in any universe. Steve knows they’ll be all right.
“Please do. In fact, let me know in advance. Send me a memo, write it in my calendar, I want to have a camera ready when it happens – Hang on, phone call. Pepper.” Tony frowns, tugging off his shades and closing the faceplate. It’s a strange sight, Iron Man’s eyes blazing blankly out at them while Steve can hear, faintly, the sound of Tony’s voice coming from inside the suit.
“Duck!” Steve shouts to Billy, launching himself forward as the soldier snaps his fingers and throws his hands out with a
Dangling from a girder in the roof of the Miami factory, Tony can feel it when Pepper hits the system overload button. He feels it in a moment of stillness that settles down over his whole body, leaving him gasping for one – split – second –
Tony waves a hand, shrugs. Smiling again, Thor pats him on the back, hard enough to knock him forwards and Tony stumbles. Steve sees in his mind’s eye the sharp, hard edge of the work surface rising up to meet him and he reaches out a hand without thinking, grabbing Tony by the collar of his shirt. Tony jerks to a halt, coughs and glares and rubs his neck and bats Steve’s hand away.
“Jesus, they – I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony is saying, shaking his head, and Steve is leaning forwards and grabbing Tony by the shoulder, a white noise in his head where thoughts used to be. “No, I mean, nothing happened. They aren't anywhere. Nothing happened to the kids,  because Reed and Sue never
“Making something expand when pressure decreases is simple. I’m talking clicky pen simple, here. Even you aren’t impressed by clicky pens, right?”
,” Tony snaps. Then he scrubs a hand across his face and his voice softens. “I was. For, I don’t know, five years, I was Iron Man. But I was drinking too much and trying to lead the Avengers at the same time and I
“Okay, folks,” Steve says. He jumps down off the stage and onto the floor, to help a shaky guy get up. “Move away from the doors now. That’s it, everyone come up front here. Nice and easy. Watch out for the glass.”
“Well, I...” Bruce takes his glasses off and wipes them on the edge of shirt, frowning. “Blue, I guess?”
Steve peers over the edge of the couch. Mechanical things are moving in the darkness through the window, in fluid flashes of arc reactor blue or gold and red when the suit catches the light. It’s like abstract art. He resolves to watch it in daylight one day.
Tony taps his chin in deep, sarcastic thought. “Like, who the hell are these devilishly attractive people anyway? Where did they come from? Who put this team together? Who’s controlling it
“You know these sheets are Egyptian cotton, right? Thousand thread count? They cost more than a,” Tony yawns, stifles the yawn, “a flat screen TV.”
Tony grabs the offered flip flops and tugs the sweatpants out of her open gym bag and he tosses the bundle to Bruce. Bruce raises his eyebrows but, passing his ice cream sandwich back to Clint, he carefully tugs the pants on. There’s a vague cheer from the onlookers when they fit.
It’s only been a few minutes since Steve and Romanoff left to investigate when there’s a buzz and a click and a rushing sensation that makes the hair on Tony’s arms stand on end. He’s sitting on their conference table, looking over a stack of cameras and recording equipment for anything unusual, when every cell phone in the room comes back to life in a cacophony of ringtones and relieved voices. In the split second it takes him to jump to his feet, his own pockets start buzzing: his cell and his communicator, joined in harmony; and then the fire alarm rips through the air and drowns it all out.
“No, no buts. Eat your ice cream, my god, you’re going to miss another seventy years if you keep going at this rate.”
The Hulk grunts, but he tilts his head in what could be a nod and says, “Small man wanna talk to you.”
There’s a crash from somewhere behind Tony. He’s thirty-nine and he’s spent enough of his life around loud noises that he carefully lowers his soldering iron and pulls away from the gauntlet prototype he and Dummy are working on, before he turns around to see.
“Forget it,” Steve says at last. “You don’t have to explain yourself to me. It’s fine. You need to talk to Fury about all this anyway, maybe you should take it up with him instead.”
Up on the screen, a young woman screams.  She claws away from the monster attacking her, her skimpy nightdress catching on shards of glass. Steve can’t remember what the movie is called or what the monster’s purpose is. He watches the light flicker across Tony’s face as the woman runs out of the house and into the trees, passing through shadows and moonlight and shadows. Tony’s pale face.
“I’m – JARVIS, could you clip this from, uh, here to... here.” He drags his finger over the play bar. “Save as a new file. Play.”
“It deployed a sonic pulse that stopped people moving,” Tony says, licking his thumb. “I was an added extra. The prototype was destroyed, anyway, and somehow I never really felt like revisiting it. But that frequency’s a starting point.”
In great trepidation, because who knows what kind of security a guy like Tony Stark has in place, Steve presses his palm against the wall in front of him. Blue light ripples out in cobwebbing lines from under his hand, quickly forming the shape of a number pad.
The hairs on Tony’s arms are standing on end. He straightens up and shoves his hands into his pockets.
Fury turns to her and she adds, with a small shrug, “I think Stark’s right. The Avengers are too public to work well with SHIELD now. Clint and I have been compromised.”
“I don’t want to take it up with Fury,” Tony blurts out. “Christ, are you kidding? Can you imagine me and him having a heart to heart? Someone would lose an eye and, you know, there’s already one too few between us.”
The movie ends in a bloodbath, of course, and the morning is cold and bright and too damn early. They walk home; or to, Steve can’t help but darkly think, whatever is left of home.
“Mr. O. Osborne, Norman Osborne,” he amends at Steve’s sharp look. “He’s had the government in his pocket for years now. He’s the one running this city. He’s the one doing what he wants to get what he wants, and what he wants is superpowers. All of them.”
It’s been five days since their meeting with Fury, which makes it four days since Tony reclaimed and refitted the top floor R&D lab for the team - by playing, just this once, the ‘it’s my tower party and I’ll redistribute facilities if I want to’ card. The lab is still shining like it’s fresh out of the packet and Bruce’s words almost disappear into the wide space. His voice takes a moment to reach Tony’s ears, and then another moment to reach Tony’s brain.
“I suggest you publically establish the team,” she says. “Before anyone can try to stake a claim in you.”
He taps the Iron Man helmet on his communicator as discreetly as possible, hiding the small device easily in his hand, and he murmurs, “Ready.” The crowd flows on around him regardless. He’s just another obstruction to get by. Either people don’t recognise him out of costume or they just don’t care; it’s hard to tell in New York.
Making a thoughtful noise, Tony slowly lowers his hand. He frowns up at Steve. Steve clasps his hands behind his back and stares stonily down at him. Next to them, the machine gun racket from the microwave finishes at last and Thor, still laughing, straightens up and turns around.
Jarvis would never let the mansion get like this, Steve knows. And Jarvis would never let his Master Stark get this tangled up in himself.
“Next Thursday,” the other Tony says, levering himself up with the edge of a desk. He pulls open one of the bottom drawers and digs out a spare pair of jeans and a holey t-shirt. “Watch out for the screwdriver on the floor.”
The cave is vast and cavernous and dim, and the one – thick, steel, reinforced – door stands in the rock face like it’s the very end of the universe. For all Steve knows, it could be.
Tony shakes himself like a dog, still grumbling under his breath as he wipes a hand across his face and scrubs at his wet hair.
“Sorry,” Tony says. He starts to snigger again and Steve’s lips twitch. “Sorry I laughed at six-year-old you.”
As people start to move forward, glass crunching underfoot and chairs scraping as they’re moved aside, Steve leans in closer to Barton.
Still looking at the napkin, Tony says, “You know, the one time in my life I really was in the right place at the right time was because it was the time and place my oldest friend had arranged for terrorists to kill me.”
“Alright, boys and girls,” Tony says, leaning forwards again to prop his elbow up on the worktop. “No need to clutch your pearls too tightly. This is – not great, yeah, but we’ve got a silver lining. Judging by this thing’s general ugliness, HYDRA have got someone else doing their dirty work – and whoever that is? They haven’t got it right either.”
Steve, letting Tony’s voice wash over him, looks back down at the communicator. He tosses it from one hand to the other, weighs it in the palm of his hand, and then reels his arm back and throws it as hard as he can at the opposite wall.
Tony nods. His face is still mostly turned away from Steve, towards the exit, only the dark brown corner of his eye visible through darker lashes. He glances down into his lap, and then sideways into Steve’s lap, and then he reaches out a hand towards him.
“It hangs in the stars,” Thor is saying. “Like a jewel. And there are pine trees in the mountains, and in the summer months, flowers bloom across the city like – like further, smaller jewels.”
He trips over the trashcans and falls backwards with a crash. Steve screws his eyes shut, throwing his hands over his ears until the alley falls silent. He lowers his hands and opens his eyes.
; and of Tony staring fixedly up at his bank of monitors, but never saying a word – for Tony to decide things are safe and they can relax again.
Tony watches her go, then look around as the doors open again and Romanoff slips through. She murmurs something to Barton too low to make out before she makes a beeline for Tony.
Steve knows his mom still has some of his dad’s clothes tucked away somewhere, but he doesn’t know where, so the man’s wearing one of Steve’s old blankets, fiddling with the edges, toying with loose threads.
“God bless the alien rainbow bridge,” Barton says, their voices drifting off down the corridor together.
He went to see a Colonel Pete Jeffries last week, who had been barely eighteen when Steve knew him. Now Pete’s in his eighties and deaf in one ear, with shrapnel in his knee; and Steve’s older than him, technically. He’d told Steve that he’d barely touched a computer in his life. Didn’t understand how his TV worked. Had a grandson, a good kid, who set it all up for him and showed him twice a week how to change the channels. It never stuck. It’s perfectly possible, he’d told Steve, to get by in 2012 without really understanding it and to still be happy. You don’t need to know everything.
“Yeah.” Tony slowly wraps his shirt around his fingers, frowning down at it. “Well, if I wind up stark, hah, naked in the middle of old-time New York and cause a riot, I’m blaming you. Put it on my tombstone. Here lies Tony Stark, Steve Rogers’ fault.”
Steve takes hold of Tony’s wrist and presses it down against the surface of the desk. His wrist is bony, he notes. He can’t remember ever actually seeing Tony eat in the few days he’s been down here.
The discharge of energy hits him. His body slams back down onto the roof and – over the ringing of his ears and the gasping of his lungs – he hears Obadiah shout. He hears Obadiah fall. He pictures the trajectory of that great body in motion, down into the innards of the factory’s heart, and Tony knows a second blast is coming.
Steve tucks the bag of money under his arm and heaves the getaway driver – starting to groan – over his shoulder and he glances at the bank employees, still huddled together nervously but with the beginnings of grins on their faces now.
“I’ll be down in...” Tony glances around the room; the atmosphere has relaxed now Steve is back and the threat has passed and the damn alarm has shut up, and people are beginning to filter out of the main room towards the staff stairs. The pace is slow. “I’ll be down in a few, okay? Gotta get everyone out of here first. Stay where you are and I’ll come find you. I’m sending Sofia down – she’s fine too.”
Steve’s lips flicker with the brief hint of a smile. He claps Tony on the shoulder – his fingers are very warm – and then he turns to Bruce.
Tony shrugs. He turns the paper around in his lap so Steve can get a better look. “I’ve designed a couple.”
She stiffens. She slowly lifts her head to look up at him again, and Tony raps his knuckles against the arc reactor with a grin.
Tony presses his hands over his mouth, trying not to cry himself, because even the ghost wasn’t as scary as this, nothing has ever been as scary as this, and he’s starting to feel dizzy.
“Tony,” Howard says into the camera. “On the day you were born, I saw – you, I believe, with something strange inside your body. Something you had brought with you instead of leaving behind-”
“It’ll take some paperwork,” Fury says to Romanoff and Barton, who nod along with his words. “Someone will forward it to you. I’m assigning an agent to act as liaison. Will that,” he adds, with a glance that sweeps around the table; his gaze settles on Steve, “be all?”
It’s long gone dark, and Pepper is fast asleep, by the time Tony gets back home and crawls into bed beside her. He reaches out across the sheets towards her, but falls asleep with his hand in empty air.
“That the best you can do, freak?” he sniggers, lowering his gun and raising his free hand. “I can do better.”
,” she says, quickly thumbing through the pages. “What are the coordinates for this base? I need to-”
They stare at each other. Tony lifts his chin up, head back, as if he’s an alley cat ready for a scrap, and Steve – well, Steve always got into a lot of fights. He can feel his hackles rise. He looks away.
“Oh, nothing. I’m just thinking of headlines. You know, for when those pictures of you stripping hit the gossip sites.”
Tony stands, yawns, stretching his arms and flexing his fingers. His skin feels itchy on the inside. He walks to the window and, with a swipe of his hand, brushes the scrolling text aside to leave the view clear. The city spreads far out below him. It shines. Four months on, there is still scaffolding all around the blocks closest to the tower, the area worst hit by the attack.
Tucking his cell in against his shoulder, Tony peers around himself. It is late afternoon, with a muggy, golden glow to the air, the sun just on the cusp of setting. The room is silent and empty except for Barton, who’s sprawled on one of the new couches. He’s reading a copy of Guns and Ammo with his combat boots propped on the coffee table. Tony snaps his fingers repeatedly until Barton licks a finger, folds down the corner of the page and looks up at him with a raised eyebrow.
“And flashed the world your six pack.” Tony pats him on the stomach. “God bless America. Wave goodbye to your anonymity.”
feel bad about Loki. Christ, we need some vodka and some – doughnuts, I know I have doughnuts somewhere.”
Lifting his pen up from the paper at last, he swipes his thumb over the wet patch of ink, smearing it. He wipes his thumb on his jeans and smirks up at Steve. Steve stares stonily back at him.
Clint pulls himself up onto the handrail again and sits there, looking pleased with himself. “If every day of my vacation’s like this, it might just be bearable.”
“Imprecise,” Tony says. He rubs his hands through his hair and shakes himself, blinking away the last clinging dregs of sleep as he flops back down onto the bed. He props himself up on his elbows and points at Steve. “And who here is without sin? Mister I watch you while you’re sleeping?”
He shoves his paper and pencils to one side and leans down over the edge of the bed. The top of his head hits the floor. Steve laughs. Reaching under his bed, the blood rushing to his head and dust getting up his nose, he sneezes, then winces and laughs harder. He stretches his fingers as far as they can go, until at last he snags the edge of the wooden box and pulls it out.
“-interesting,” he breathes, lifting the reactor right up to his face with the softest smile. “Ah. This is your masterpiece, Tony. I mean it. Even Howard would have been proud.”
Tony sighs heavily, rolling his eyes and dropping his hand, and says in a sing-song voice, “No, Barton, JARVIS is 100% cake-free. Now, can we continue?”
“Oh,” says Ms Potts from overhead, emerging at the top of the stairs with her arms full of towels. “
“Oh.” Steve pauses. “I didn’t mean to – It’s not HYDRA, it’s just something I’ve been figuring out.”
“Go!” he hisses to some inner part of himself, and he feels his body rising up, or his stomach swooping down. He imagines, for a heartbeat, that he is pure electricity.
“I never really know how safe it is down here,” he murmurs, more to himself than to Steve. “Pretty damn safe, I figure. Unless they’re just toying with me? I don’t know.”
“That’s nothing to do with me. It’s for someone else. She just wants me to watch–” He cuts himself off abruptly, mouth snapping shut, and then he drops his face into his hands. “It’s nothing to do with this. You’ve asked your questions, now go away.”
Then he pulls away and claps his hands together, his grin brittle.  “Now how about a nice stroll through the city, Dave?”
Steve watches the muscles in Tony’s jaw shift as it clenches and unclenches. Tony swallows, frowning, and his gaze drifts away from Steve again, back down to the gun in his hands.
Tony sighs. Bending down, he picks up the clump of wires nearest to his feet and sets about slowly untangling them. He watches his fingers move.
The first thing Steve Rogers ever says to Howard Stark, his voice shaking with uncertainty and pent-up emotion, is “Tony?”
“We’d like to... remain active in the field,” Romanoff translates, arching an eyebrow at him. “And continue to make use of our skill sets. We would still liaise with SHIELD where appropriate.”
Steve drops his piece of metal. He can feel the shield drop from his fingers too, the imaginary weight disappearing, the game over. “You were extracting superpowers? What the hell were you
“This isn’t worry! This? This isn’t me being worried for you. This is me wondering what the hell were you
Steve grins at her, as best he can. His face aches. Everything aches. The last time he felt this satisfyingly exhausted was after they had stopped Loki’s army and he had almost fallen asleep in the sandwich Tony made them all try.
“I understand the date just fine, Stark,” he says. “It’s everything else I’m having trouble with, here.”
“Thursday, screwdriver, got it.” Tony picks the soldering iron back up again. “Get over here and hold this wire steady, would you?”
Rummaging through his treasures, Steve feels Tony shift closer for a better view. In among the collection of feathers, and pebbles, and the yo-yo with the broken string, and the nickel with a hole right through the middle, Steve fishes out a small horseshoe magnet.
“Never mind,” Steve says quickly, holding up a hand. He lowers it and extends it and waits patiently with hand outstretched until Tony, with a put-upon sigh, shakes it. “Tell me next time.”
Steve steps around Tony, into the room. It must be, he’s almost sure of it, bigger than his whole apartment, with the curving wall on the far side of the room another stretch of the floor-to-ceiling windows he’s grown accustomed to seeing in Tony’s home.
Chairs scrape, shoes scuff the floor. Leaning back against the doorframe, Tony crosses his arms and watches everyone file out. Thor pats him on the shoulder as he passes by, making Tony’s knees buckle. Bruce neatly steps over the leg Tony sticks out to trip him, with a smile and a little bow.
Steve is a lot bigger than Tony, he reminds himself. And stronger too, especially in this world without Iron Man. He takes a step back, breathing out slowly. In this world, Tony Stark probably isn’t a threat.
The Hulk sits down heavily on the floor and puts his fingers in his mouth, glaring at them all. After a moment’s pause, he punches the ground with his free hand. The concrete cracks under his fist.
“Only the swords of my slain enemies, to bring them the shame of an improper burial,” Thor says. He catches the bottle of vodka Tony tosses him with barely the blink of an eye. “But now Asgard is a realm of peace and it is
Barton rolls his eyes. Swinging his feet up onto the arm rest, he crosses his legs and props his elbows on his knees, his chin on his knuckles. He looks about one pointy hat and a fishing rod away from becoming a lawn ornament.
” Tony echoes. “That’s all? I mean, no offence, but I thought you’d put up more of a fight. I prepared a
He unbuttons the first few buttons of his shirt and tugs it open. He raps his knuckles on the glass. The other Tony, scooting forwards on his knees, does the same.
“Sorry about all this,” he says. “I don’t know how long this whole thing’s going to take to get straightened out, but you’re welcome to come along if you don’t mind walking.”
“The labs are on floors twenty to thirty,” she says. “But he’s probably down in the basement workshop. When in doubt, ask JARVIS.”
Tony lowers his glass. He fixes Steve with an unreadable look and says, eventually, “Yeah, he always bought the good stuff. Good old dad. Why are you here?”
“Are you wondering if that sonic pulse has paralysed the time-travel as well? ‘Cause I have to tell you, Tony, that’s what I’m wondering right now. So let’s-”
The springs shift back into place again and there’s a pause before Tony clears his throat. “How – how
“I’m trying to get the little bastard flying.” Tony grins up at Steve, who huffs out a disgruntled breath. “But without actually attaching any repulsor tech to it. Ideally we’d want a whole fleet of them, flying independently, so they need to be dispensable.  I start letting teeny, tiny, annoying repulsors fly around in battle, I might as well just turn my workshop into a garage sale. It’d be less messy and at least I’d get a buck or two.”
if I could avoid it, but...” Steve shrugs. “Some of the fellas I knew woulda probably shocked and offended
, so they meet, inexorably, halfway. It’s a clumsy, graceless kiss, with Steve’s mouth closed and Tony’s mouth dry, and Tony begins to laugh, breathlessly, against Steve’s lips.
. It’s twenty-ten. You haven’t been in the ice for two years. Do you understand what I’m saying here?  Two thousand ten. Two-oh-one-oh. Look, I’ll write it down for you.”
Tony is drunk. Thirty three and very drunk, when he finds himself on the floor, bleeding from the chest – no, bleeding from the edges of the thing that’s in his chest.
Tony’s pencil falters. “Nah, I think I’m pretty much tuned to when you are. Where you go, I follow.”
“I don’t believe snacking and avenging have to be mutually exclusive,” Tony says. “It’s a brave new world. Now scram. Get.”
Grabbing hold of Steve’s forearm for support, Tony hops onto one foot and then the other, tugging his socks off again. He pulls them over his hands with a smirk at Steve, saying, “Pays to be cautious. Don’t tell anyone I said that, I’ve got a reputation to maintain. I figure it’s safe with fabrics unless the superduper serum’s rubbed off on your sweatshirt somehow.”
Steve waves, and spots Iron Man halfway through the motion, a hovering trail of light. He waves again. Iron Man loop-the-loops in response.
, who’s sitting a few feet away and staring at him with his mouth. He looks different, somehow, and Steve’s vision is too blurry to make out their surroundings but he knows, is certain, it’s somewhere he’s never been before.
Shoving the portal gun back onto the floor, Tony tugs his gloves off with his teeth, chucks them to the side and takes careful hold of Steve’s hand again. Tony’s fingers are warm and calloused and precise, and he slips them under Steve’s palm.
He watches Tony’s hands toying nervously with the portal gun. The sight of the HYDRA logo, etched clumsily into the side as if it were an afterthought, still makes something lurch sickly in his stomach, as much rage as it is grief; and the wall against his back is cold and hard; and he’s god only knows how deep underground. But he glances sideways at Tony, who is watching Steve out of the corner of his eye, and Steve lets out the breath he’s been holding for upwards of seventy years.
“Hah!” Tony declares, pointing his pen at Steve. It has a glowing tip. “After. Towers come and go, but pizza is forever.”
Thor sits down where Tony’s arm had been, making the couch creak; it’s already a pretty big couch, but Thor is a bigger guy. Tony magnanimously moves to the side, drawing his limbs in tighter as he looks around the room at them all.  Steve is sitting on the floor on the other side of the coffee table, with his legs crossed so he looks more like a schoolboy than a living legend; Bruce, sitting next to Steve, looks completely normal, because he’s the kind of guy who probably sits on floors for fun.
“So if you’re really a time traveller, prove it,” Steve says, swinging his feet where they dangle over the edge of his chair. He’s eight. His feet don’t touch the ground. His mom promises he’ll have a growth spurt in a few years.
“Listen to me,” Tony hisses, grabbing Steve by the elbow and tugging him – Steve jerks his arm out of Tony’s hold, but follows him anyway – deeper into the recesses of the jet.
Tony opens his mouth, pauses, then closes it again, pulling some kind of silent, elaborate, petulant face that Steve takes to mean ‘Do go on, Captain Rogers.’
There’s a soft knock on the door. It opens a crack and Sofia peeks through, looking unruffled. Over her shoulder, the front row of press is barely visible, craning their necks like schoolchildren while they try to catch a glimpse of the team.
“I died up there,” Tony says suddenly, eyes never leaving Steve’s face. “I was actually dead. Crazy, I know. In space. In a whole alien universe. My heart stopped and I was – alone. I was going to die alone, that was it, nothing to be done.”
Tony’s gaze swings across to him and he blinks, frowns, coming back to himself. “Oh, yeah, uh. Minibreak. She’s decided I’m old enough to be left home alone so long as I promise not to answer the door to strangers.”
Steve looks up to see a giant green fist, bigger than his head, with the broken remains of an arrow poking out from between its fingers.
Tony lifts his hand away and lifts his shirt away to let Obie see, and Obie steps fully into the room. He kneels next to Tony, at the other Tony’s side, and he taps a finger over the glowing glass.
“Folks, just sit tight and stay calm,” he says. “We’re going to see what’s happening, but we’ll get you out of here as soon as we can.”
“You-” Steve begins, before he stops himself. He pinches the bridge of his nose, takes a deep breath, and then takes his drink back from Tony. He pulls the straw out and swallows a deep mouthful. It’s still disgusting, but it tastes better than last time; it could grow on him, Steve supposes.
Steve holds out his arm. Tony sits down on the edge of his desk and sets about measuring it: shoulder to wrist, and then breaking down into smaller units. Shoulder to elbow. Elbow to wrist. Circumferences.
Steve is fifteen. He stares down at the backs of his hands where they’re resting on the kitchen table. He never had that growth spurt. The table wobbles on its rickety legs with every small movement of every breath he takes, so he’s trying to hold himself as still as possible. The apartment and its furnishings never were in great condition, but it was cheap and it was home and that was all they had ever needed.
Steve’s face still feels half-frozen, but he summons up a smile of his own as he plucks the box of tissues from her hands. He drips his way into Tony’s private elevator once more, prods the wall – and then, when nothing happens, wipes his hands dry with a couple of tissues and tries again.
“I chop, I stir, I apply fire. I haven’t died of hunger yet.” Tony glances up from the breadbox and seems to read something in Steve’s expression that makes him snort. “Oh, I see. Hey, size matters. Even you know that, right? Look.”
“I imagine... the shrapnel would probably have ripped out of you when you disappeared. I imagine then you would have died.”
“No identity match yet,” Romanoff says promptly. “He’s still out. Cap... Hill reports he started to come round in transit – the radio went haywire, so he was sedated. They were worried something might happen to the copter.”
your most pressing question?” the man groans, climbing out of the trashcans. He grabs a lid and holds it up in front of his legs, peering down at Steve. His nose is bleeding, his chest is glowing, and there are wires coiled all around his body.
“What about military and police?” Steve asks, and then when Romanoff raises an eyebrow at him, he adds, “I don’t want us stepping on anyone’s toes.”
“Pretty much. A pulse at this frequency sent through my body should induce a – what should I call it in the research paper, a temporal incident? Suppress the frequency and, yada yada, in theory it’ll suppress the incident too.”
“Certainly, sir. Ms Potts has completed her final meeting of the day. At current traffic conditions, she will return to the tower within twenty-two minutes, assuming she takes a direct route.”
“T has friends?!” Peter squawks. He sounds amazed. Steve tries not to laugh. Then there’s another voice in the background, whispering something sharp and too fast for Steve to identity, and Peter mutters
As they round the corner, Steve can see that Stark Manor’s front doors are slightly ajar, a slice of darkness gaping through that is visible even from the sidewalk. He stills, tapping Tony on the arm, then nods through the gates towards it.
“Sir, password override zero-zero-one in use,” JARVIS says. “Ms Potts has returned home and is currently in the Penthouse elevator.”
“Rhodey. Rhodes. Jim Beam,” Tony says with a reproachful sigh. He leans back in his chair, resting his feet on the edge of his desk. “Is that a hint of envy I detect?”
Hovering ten feet over the crowd, Steve’s feet are level with the Hulk’s face – the Hulk, who is sitting quite calmly by his standards on the roof of a thoroughly crushed car, twenty and fifty dollar bills spilling out of the busted trunk and getting caught in the breeze. He’s holding a weeping, trembling man by the ankle, swinging him back and forth.
What if, Tony has never said out loud to anyone but thinks about all the damn time. What if one day he travels back in time to the wrong side of an explosion or a bullet or a car crashing through the barriers on a dark, wet night?
. Fire roars out of the soldier's fingertips too fast, blazingly hot, and for a second Steve reels back, dragging the Kaplan kid with him. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see the other soldiers shouting, drawing back as well.
It’s a performance, Steve realises, for the bug Tony’s now spotted; and when Tony’s fingers crook for a second in a beckoning motion, Steve strides forwards, grabbing Tony’s shirt by the collar.
“Move into the tower, you asshole,” Tony says. “You could at least pretend to look surprised. Christ, I take it back, you’re not invited anymore.”
“I’m finding your advice particularly sage today,” Bruce murmurs from the sidelines, but Tony’s eyes barely skate towards him before they’re snapping back to Steve.
