Dean swallowed. He had no words. He felt a tear run down one cheek, and let it fall. It pooled against Castiel’s fingers.
“Just go ahead and ask, Dean.”
“What is that? Frankincense? Myrrh?” he asked, sniffing at Cas’ skin. Dean smiled, his eyes glowing with laughter and affection. Cas could tell that Dean was back, on the other side of that velvety, floaty space that felt so good to him.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, ok. But that doesn’t make up for an orgasm.”
“And I suppose that whole thing about leaving our bodies behind is wrong too?” Dean asked.
“No, Cas. No I’m not. I’m gonna need a minute here.”
Cas hummed, continuing to suck gently on Dean’s cock, sending his grace inside of Dean, rubbing his other hand comfortingly along Dean’s thigh and up onto his stomach, calming him. Helping him to relax and accept the sensation.
Dean laughed out loud at that. An angel calling humans prudish. What even was his life???
Dean opened his eyes, his brow furrowing in confusion. Cas saw it. He saw everything.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel answered.  “I’m glad you don’t feel jealous.”
“You’re beautiful,” Cas said, breaking the silence. “You’re bright and beautiful, and so brave.” Dean finally closed his eyes, unable to keep them open in the face of such inexorable praise. Castiel let him. Dean let his head fall back, his mouth falling open as he pushed his hips up to meet Cas’ touch, uncaring now what he looked like or what he was supposed to do, just chasing the high.
The next post over also sported a piece of rebar, probably used to hang something on he thought, but it was much higher, above his head even. Cas saw him looking.
“Dean, we’ve talked about this. All these hangups about sex and bodies and nudity are completely man-made. God created people to live and be happy. He certainly doesn’t care how people show affection for one another.”
Castiel looked at him fully in the face and held the look for a moment, breathlessly. He cocked an eyebrow up at Dean. Dean felt heat suddenly bubble up, low in his belly. Oh shit. He knew that look. Something was about to happen.
“It was just a few years before his death,” Castiel continued. “His ministry was growing, and he was traveling a lot. He had his followers. The ones that stayed with him… some of them were lovers, and some of them were dear friends.” Dean quirked an eyebrow up at that. “They made up their own little family. He preached love everywhere he went. And he preached grace and generosity. Service one to another.” Castiel ducked his head. “But I digress. We were sitting in a makeshift home he was staying at, talking. He had been working on a piece of wood, a carved figure for one of his friends. I was very taken with his beauty. His soul shone so brightly. He noticed my obvious, uh…. adoration, and he leaned over, his face near my face. I remember I could hardly breathe, even though I don’t really breathe. He smiled so kindly, like it was he who adored me. And then he kissed me. I remember I felt it all the way to my soul. It burned. But in a good way. Much like when I kiss you, Dean.”
Castiel smiled. His face lit up, remembering. The Christmas lights strung over the street flashed over their upturned faces, red, green, and gold.
“Please,” Dean moaned, begging. Cas paused his gentle licks to smile, grinning a bit wickedly.
“Oh little town of Bethlehem,” Dean panted, swallowing hard. “How still we see thee lie.”
“Well, I feel a little jealous. I’m certainly no Jesus.”
“Yes, as in THE Apostle Paul. People forget that Paul was a human, the same as they are. Humans get so caught up in the minutia of that particular book, the Bible, which is really just a collection of very old writings and letters that have been translated and rewritten over and over again. By other humans. The idea that every single thing in the Bible is THE word of God is kinda weird. And pretty convenient for the authors, I think.”
“Paul was wrong,” Cas continued.
“Paul was obsessed with this idea that divine love was only a thing SOME people could have. He thought it would be best if people could somehow abstain from committing to each other or engaging in sexual relations, because, he said, those things distracted humans from God. So his only conception of love and ecstasy, or rapture, was to ACTUALLY fly up into the sky to be with God, AWAY from Earth altogether. As if God isn’t down here with us, in us. In everything. As if we have to ABANDON each other and our physical bodies to experience true love. Sad really, because the opposite is true.”
“OMG, Cas. What do I have to do to make you stop????”
“Hello, Dean.”
They had been lying in bed and listening to Zeppelin, but then the playlist switched up and Debbie Harry’s raspy voice filtered through. Dean’s head was propped up on his pillow, and Cas rested his chin on top of Dean’s shoulder, eyes softly closed and arm wrapped around Dean’s chest. It was late at night and they should probably snuggle on down under the sheets properly, but the music was so mellow and the mood so chill that they lingered awake. Dean’s skin gleamed golden under the light of the bedside lamp. Cas’ thumb stroked against it languidly.
Dean had stopped counting. He was still able to hold on to the spike above his head, but now he could only moan. Castiel gave him one last lick, and then dropped the belt. Dean was still on his feet, able to stand. Blood ran down his back in stripes. His shoulders heaved with his rapid breathing, and his head lolled on his shoulder. Castiel knew that the incriminating voices in his head would leave him alone for a while now. So that Dean could hear the words he needed to hear.
Last line. He could do this.
“Oh look,” Cas said, a note of affection in his voice. “It’s Jesus and his parents. His earthly parents, at least. Oh and I see they have a few angels there as well. I wasn’t there at his birth, sadly. But I met him later. Nice man.”
Dean shrugged, looking a little sheepish. “Yeah, go ahead.”
Cas cocks his head to the side, in that way he does.
“I brought you here on this magical night, much like the night in the barn when we first met, so I could make you be still. So I could show you how much you mean to me. How much you’ve given me. How much I love you. How worthy you are of love and good things.” It was that last part that had Dean shaking and lowering his arms. Cas wasn’t surprised. He knew that Dean did not see himself as worthy of worship, and that it was the last part of his “speech” that Dean would have the hardest time with.  His commander of angels voice rang out like a gunshot, both quiet and solid at the same time.
Dean promptly shut his mouth.
“Hold your arms up straight, Dean” Cas instructed, and yeah, there was his Dom voice. His I am an angel of the Lord and I have no fucks to give voice. Dean obediently raised his arms up straight above his head. Cas walked over, pushing gently against Dean’s chest until Dean’s back was flush against the post, his hands skimming against the piece of pipe sticking above his head. Cas leaned in close, almost conspiratorially, and said clearly and assertively, “What do you say if or when you want to stop or take a break, Dean?”
“That sounds nice,” whispers Cas.
Dean flashed him a relieved look.
Dean leaned back against the headboard, considering. “Huh.”
“I am more than ok, Dean. I am….. ecstatic.”  Cas rolled over so he could look Dean in the eyes. He grabbed his hand and leaned in, kissing him softly on the lips. “You’re the best thing to ever happen to me, Dean Winchster.”
“And do NOT ask me which of you was better.”
“This is what I meant, Dean. I want to worship you, here in this barn on this night. I want to worship you BECAUSE you are a man, and because you taught me how to love. I love the whole world, everyone, because of you. Everything you do, you do for love, Dean. You are the most selfless, loving human being I have ever, or will ever, know.”
Cas rumbled deep in his throat, his tongue sweeping over Dean’s skin and his lips pulling and sucking. Dean thrust into him and Cas took him down into his throat. Dean would probably stop and wonder at that if he was capable of coherent thought right now. Cas reached up and slipped his fingers between Dean’s ass cheeks, running a finger lightly over his hole, over and over. Dean knew he was close.
“Yes, Dean. Still very cool. People are calling it the Bethlehem Star, though I don’t really know if there was a confluence of planets on the night of Christ’s birth or not, since the date of his birth is debated, December 25th being hijacked to coincide with the pagan celebration of Solstice. I suppose I could ask,” he nodded up towards the sky “I could ask around at the ‘office’, as it were.”
“Paul? As in, like, the Apostle Paul?” Dean asked, sitting up straighter.
Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and began walking backwards, pulling him along. “It IS a magical night, Dean. Come on!”  He turned, still clasping Dean’s hand behind him, and started walking in the direction of the barn. Dean tripped along behind him reluctantly.
“Hey Cas. Buddy. You in there? You ok?”
“And it was Judas who kissed him,” Castiel continued, his voice quiet but strong. “In the garden of Gethsemane. “ And Castiel leaned forward and kissed Dean on the mouth, gently and sweetly, leaving his lips there for a moment, and then darting his tongue out to taste him. Dean moaned and opened his mouth, letting him in. They kissed languidly for a while, Dean letting Cas lead, content to feel the push and pull of the angel’s tongue, his angel taking him as he pleased. After a few minutes, Cas pulled back and opened his eyes, waiting for Dean to open his. Keeping the direct eye contact, just inches apart, Cas said loudly and clearly, “You are so beautiful.” Dean did not flinch. He held on to the metal above him, and listened to Castiel.
Cas grinned, his facade again cracking a bit. He also knew that Dean would probably let him do it, if he asked.
Castiel bottomed out, and they both opened their eyes. Their eyes burned blue with grace, together.
“That’s true,” Cas mused. “I just hope…”
“Yeah, that’s for damn sure,” Dean agreed. “So no rapture then, ya think?”
“Yeah. Some people believe you even leave your clothes behind when you’re raptured. Others believe you leave your whole body behind.”
“Look who’s talking!” Cas exclaimed. “I had to read up for a solid week to figure out what you wanted me to do!”
And Dean was quiet. He looked at Castiel with open eyes, and he listened.
“It was Thomas who doubted Jesus,” Cas said quietly. “After Jesus was put to the cross, and then rose again. Thomas didn’t have enough faith. He had to actually touch Jesus to be sure it was him. The palms of Jesus’ hands, and then here at his side, where they had pierced the savior with a spear. Thomas had to put his fingers inside of Jesus to believe.” Cas looked up into Dean’s face. “Or so they say.”
“I think I saw Saturn up there.”
“I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to it,” Cas sighs.
Dean repeated the words they had discussed at length many times.
“Holy for sure.”
“Definitely lust,” Cas answered. He ran his fingers down Dean’s chest, leaning his lips in for another chaste peck. “Also love.”
“So Jesus… he was… gay?”
“Please, Cas. Please.”
“I brought you to this barn tonight, Dean Winchester, on the longest night of the year, while the planets are aligned overhead to create one gleaming star from heaven shining over us, to worship you.”
“Just a little longer, Dean, and then I’ll let you come.”
“WTF, Cas? You’re TEASING me????”
Cas’ eyes flicked to the side, seeming to search the room, and then flicked back to Dean’s face, in that dominating way he had about him. Dean knew without a doubt that Cas knew every board, nail, and splinter of wood in this room. And that he was safe here with Cas.
Dean listened. He listened very hard.
“Good,” Cas answered.
“Well you’re the one who started talking about babies in barns and stuff.”
“Ok,” Cas mumbles, still unmoving.
“Jesus was a man, but I was still in awe of him. The grace he had for people…. it was overwhelming. We were friends, but he kissed me first.”
Dean looked him straight in the eye. He was a hunter after all. And he was Dean fucking Winchester.  “Yes, Castiel. I know what you are asking, and I want it.”
“I’m not squeamish!” Dean argued. “Don’t compare me to the apostles! I’m insulted.”
They walked on, quiet for a moment, hands still grasped between them.
“No, but….” Dean mumbled, his arms continuing to lower. Cas knew that Dean was THINKING. He was dropping out of that space he craved so much, so that he could argue with Castiel about his worthiness. Cas wasn’t having it.
Dean felt a little sheepish at the accuracy of Cas’ observations about him. He also felt a little spied on. But he knew that Castiel didn’t ACTUALLY spy on him. Cas would never peek into his head without permission. Cas just knew him very, very well. Like a best friend would. Like an attentive lover would. Dean nodded.
Cas sat up and looked at Dean, tilting his head. Thinking. Then his face cleared. “Oh, you mean that stuff about the rapture? The reading from Thessalonians?”
Cas ground his hips down onto Dean’s, and Dean groaned without intending to. He couldn’t help it. Cas licked his lips, and then gently took both of Dean’s hands, guiding his arms up above his head. Cas’ chest hovered above Dean’s face as Cas began tying Dean’s wrists together and then to the headboard, but Cas kept his body just out of reach of Dean’s mouth. Dean sighed, both delighted and frustrated. Cas smiled, knowing full well what he was doing. He rolled his hips as he tied the rope, giving them both just enough friction to tease at more. Dean raised his head to try and get at Cas, and then dropped it back again impatiently. Cas cinched the rope tight and Dean groaned, relishing the burn. “Oh hell yeah,” Dean whispered.
They arrived at the barn doors, breathless. Well, Dean was breathless. Castiel was calm, though Dean could feel that vibrational thrumming in his hand that Dean was feeling on his skin, like the air before a lightning strike.
Dean nodded.
Castiel smiled and nodded. “Of course it’s not really a star. It’s a confluence of planets, Jupiter and Saturn.”
“Lift your legs at the knee and put your feet in the air, Dean.”
Dean stretched, grimacing a bit at the pull of the wounds on his back and the tightness of his shoulders.
Cas stood back and took in the sight of Dean’s body slowly, looking him up and down. Dean was still, letting him look as long as he wanted. His breathing was still slowing from the whipping. He was beginning to feel calm, to feel floaty. The warmth of the blood on his back felt comforting. His shoulders were tired, but not overly so. The ache felt good. He felt high.
Castiel sat all the way up on his knees, his eyes flicking down from Dean’s eyes, and he leaned in and nuzzled his face against Dean’s straining cock. Dean whimpered, squirming a bit. Cas reached up and gently took Dean’s balls in one hand, continuing to rub his cheeks and his face against the silkiness of Dean’s cock. He breathed in, savoring the musky, earthy scent of Dean, and then slowly, finally, lapped at the head of his cock. Dean exhaled a punched out breath, arousal spiking all through his body. He felt lit up with pure ecstasy, feeling wave upon wave pulse through him. Castiel continued with kitten licks along the head of his cock, taking his time, opening his eyes to stare up with adoration. Dean started breathing quickly again, panting and squirming under Cas’ careful ministrations.
Dean nodded his head and then bent down, kissing his boyfriend firmly. Dean’s tongue licked into him and Dean held him there, tasting him. Cas sighed and his body melted a bit, relaxing into the heat.
Dean turned on the radio. Cas refrained from admonishing him about the driver getting to pick the music.
Dean chuckled.
“Come on buddy, upsy daisy.” Dean circles an arm around him and underneath his armpits and lifts him mostly to a standing position. Cas isn’t much help. They stumble together back into Cas’ bedroom. Dean tries to lower Cas back down onto the bed gently, but Cas is heavy and ends up dropping down harder than Dean meant for him to.
Dean stops in front of Cas’ door, wondering if he should intrude or leave the man in peace.  His concern for the newly human angel wins out, and he taps lightly.
The words came out in a whisper at first, through panted breaths. He gripped the bar above him so tightly his fingers turned white. His legs shook beneath him. Cas wasn’t holding anything back now. He bobbed up and down over Dean’s length incessantly.
“Please keep count for as long as you can, Dean,” Cas said, again softly and gently. Dean nodded his head. He set his feet apart and rolled his shoulders.
“Oh, I’ve already been there, Dean. I got exactly what I needed from there and I’ve never looked back.” And Dean’s serious, dorky, painfully literal, immortal, confused, badass angel of the Lord had the audacity to glance over and wink flirtatiously at him.
“His loss,” Dean whispered. He reached down and squeezed Cas gently through his slacks, and then reached around and unlocked the door.
“Is that the Christmas star right there? Tonight’s the night it’s supposed to be visible, right? First time in 800 years or some crap?” Dean asked. He nodded his head vaguely at the bright reddish glow that stood out from the rest in the sky.
“Yes, well, good memories.” He waited for Dean to unlock the car.
“Yeah, I remember,” Dean said roughly, trying to keep the emotion out of his voice.
Castiel snickered, and then stood at the end of the bed. Dean thought that he looked like the cat that got the cream, standing there in his boxers, chest glistening in the heat of the room. Without warning, Cas grabbed Dean by the ankles and pulled him down the bed, laying him out flat on his back. Dean grunted in surprise.
“The things you do for love.” His blue eyes sparkled in the starlight, and Dean squeezed his hand affectionately at his words.
Cas chuckled softly. “You can say it or sing it any way you like, Dean. You just have to hold on through one verse.”
“Four,” Dean choked out, his voice still strong. Red welts formed along the curves of his back. He was a strong man, and Castiel knew that Dean wouldn’t buckle until blood was drawn.  He drew back the leather strap, and let it fly. The sharp thud of leather against skin vibrated throughout the room, followed now by small moans. Dean was no longer able to hold them back. Castiel was glad, because that meant that Dean was getting close. Castiel swung again, watching the belt bite against skin, and finally seeing blood rise to the surface and drip down his back. Dean always required a blood penitence.
Cas, ever the responsible friend and lover, untied Dean’s wrists immediately and massaged them. They both winced a bit when Cas pulled out, flopping down next to each other and gasping for air, hearts beating a mile a minute.
“There’s not…. there’s not a baby in that barn, is there? There’s not sheep and a manger and a donkey and shit? Is there?”
“Come on,” Cas said, gently but firmly helping Dean to his feet. “Let’s get you dressed before it gets too cold in here. Now that our ‘amorous fervor’ has worn off.” Dean huffed a laugh out at that. He could practically hear the finger quotes in Cas’ voice. Cas smiled back. Dean was still shaky on his feet, so Cas supported him while Dean climbed into his jeans and put on his boots.
Castiel glanced up at him quickly.
“You want to worship me, Cas? What does that even mean? YOU are the angel, not me.”
“Oh,” says Dean sheepishly. “Oh yeah, right. Sorry, man.”
Cas took a minute to take in the sight of his beloved in front of him. The muscles of Dean’s shoulders and back stretched gloriously. His ass was already blushing pink and looked delicious. Cas loved to look at him, but he didn’t want to draw this out too long, taking care with his lover’s feelings and willing submission, which was a gift. So he began.
“Ah, humans and their ranking of sex partners. I never fail to feel perplexed by that.”
Castiel unbuckled his leather belt, and pulled it through the loops of his dress pants. Dean flinched a bit at the sound of the leather whipping through the cloth. He held on tight.
Cas finally cracked, letting a little smile peek out. “Where do you think babies come from, Dean?”
“Yes, Dean. This is the rapture.”
“Well not like Paul described it. There IS rapture to be sure, but Paul was very confused about the whole thing.”
“Yeah, ok. Fair,” Dean conceded. He knew he still struggled with letting himself be vulnerable, and letting himself be vulnerable with a man. Even a man that was also a supernatural being from Heaven.
“Did the son of God know you like to tie people up?” Dean whispered, quirking up an eyebrow.
“Alright theologian Castiel, please continue.”
“You’re doing so well, my love. You can do it.” He reached out with his wet, pink tongue and sucked at the head of Dean’s cock. Dean bucked into him. “What’s the next line, Dean?” Cas asked quietly and calmly, as if this was just your average weeknight in front of the tv. Dean knew him well enough to hear the strain underneath his voice though. He knew Cas was hard and ready to go too. Dean closed his eyes and concentrated, and Cas closed his mouth around him again, jacking him more roughly now.
“Cas,” he whispered. “Castiel.”
Finally, after spending enough time on Dean’s chest that both nipples were wet and irritated and bite marks stood out against his skin, Cas retrieved his finger from Dean’s mouth and sat up, pulling Dean’s boxers down and off his body. Cas quickly discarded his own boxers as well, and then sat back on his heels for a moment, enjoying the picture laid out before him. Dean was openly panting now, his head tilted back and eyes closed, his arms straining at the ropes. His skin glowed as he writhed on top of the sheets, unable to stay still.
“And if you remember, we first met in a barn, not unlike this one,” Cas finished.
“Dean, I loved the man. That’s why I had sex with him. I wasn’t looking just to ‘tap that’, as you humans say. We shared a moment and enjoyed each other. It was very nice.”
Dean had no idea what Cas was leading up to, but he dutifully looked down the two rows of posts spanning up to the ceiling on either side of them. He glanced back at the post directly behind him. A large spiky piece of rebar jutted out from it at chest height.
Cas leaned down and nuzzled into Dean, rubbing his cheek against the silken skin of Dean’s cock, enjoying the soft slide of it, knowing that his stubble would burn in just the right way. He loved the feel of the hardness of Dean, strong and throbbing, encased in the silky smooth skin that was just starting to slick up.
“You just gonna leave me hanging here, Cas? After that whole damn oration you gave outside? Help me out a little here, man.” He felt his cheeks flush.
“I want you to recite a hymn. Or a Christmas carol. You have to say at least one verse. Once you finish, you can come.”
Dean huffs out a quiet laugh and kneels down next to Cas, gently wiping his face and mouth with the washcloth. Cas tries to wave him away.
“You’re one kinky little fella, you know that, Cas?” Dean asked.
“So,” Dean said, straightening up, his shoulders more relaxed. They were almost to the parking garage. “Who kissed who first?”
“Do you want help following my instructions, Dean?” Cas asked, as he had the times before when this happened.
Castiel squared his shoulders, his eyes darkening, and his voice rang out authoritatively. “Grasp the bar above you with your hands, Dean, and do not let go until I tell you.”
Cas turned around again, still walking. “I promise, you don’t want to miss this!”
Castiel began to walk off, and Dean grabbed his arm and yanked him back. He held him with a vice-like grip in front of the Nativity set.
“Oh, Cas,” Dean sighed. He drifted easily now, sinking into the bed, sinking away. The angelic grace built inside of him, reaching out into his limbs, pulsing softly like a ripple through his whole body. Castiel could feel it, could feel the inside of Dean, the pleasure holding him and releasing within him, like waves on the hot sand. Cas sat up quietly, watching Dean’s face twitch in ecstasy, feeling the thrumming of their connection inside of his own body. Flipping open the bottle of lube, Cas quickly slicked up his own cock and, lining himself up with Dean, pushed in slow and steady, into where his grace had already opened Dean’s body to him. He could feel both the grace connected to Dean’s soul and the connection of their flesh as he continued to push inside of Dean. Dean groaned and panted, completely unselfconsiously, completely lost to anything but the feeling of it all. Both of their eyes were closed in concentration, both lost in sensation, feeling the electricity against their skin, both outside and in.
“Yeah I guess you got me there, Cas. You and I have been resurrected more than a few times now. Who am I to judge freaking zombies flying up into the sky to meet the son of God? Maybe Paul was right.”
“And…” Cas suddenly jumped up onto the bed, crawling up Dean’s body to straddle his hips. “I want to make you FLY, Dean.”  Holy shit. Dean gulped. He was so thoroughly fucked.
Dean exhaled loudly.
“Dean!” says Cas, suddenly dipping his head directly over the trash can. “Do NOT say the word pastrami!”
“Paul was wrong,” Cas continued calmly, as if nothing had happened. “We don’t need to shed our bodies to experience rapture. We only need to shed our fears and our anxieties. Our earthly inhibitions. We only need to love ourselves enough to let us BE ourselves. To allow ourselves to ask for what we want. To let ourselves be loved for who we are. Say yes if you understand, Dean.”
“You trying to get me out of my pants, Dean Winchester?” Cas jokes, smiling but not opening his eyes.
Dean rolled his eyes.
“I’m disgusting, Dean. You don’t have to do that. My mouth tastes like…. “ Unable to think of a worthy comparison, he merely finishes with “vomit”.
“Cas?” Dean asked, now tilting his head to the side quizzically in that way that was usually Castiel’s signature move.
“Come on, Dean. You’re being a ‘grinch’.” Cas gestured finger quotes in the air. “It JUST started. And anyway, it’s pretty,” he said.
“So like…. What was it like? Being with Jesus?”
“Yes,” Dean huffed out, nodding. He licked his lips, eyes going to Cas’ lips. He wanted.
Dean laughed outright at that. Castiel chuckled with him. They both drank some more and relaxed against the car.
“That last case we worked, with that asshole ghost in that church…..”
Cas broke their kiss to let Dean breathe. He thought that even their combined breath was puffing out blue, but maybe he was just seeing blue all around them now. He couldn’t tell and he didn’t really care. They were lost to each other and whatever it was between them. Inside of them. It steadily built up within them, like the low beat of a drum as one approaches. The pulse of the grace and the pulse of their heartbeats grew louder in his ears. He thrust harder, giving in to his growing desire to do so. Dean started breathing more quickly, pulling against the rope, pulling against Cas, asking to be pushed over with his body.
“Don’t make me get out the ball gag,” Cas admonished. Dean smirked and shut his mouth, looking down his body affectionately at his dorky little angel. His dirty talk could use a little work, but Dean knew he could perform miracles with that tongue, so he let him continue.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Yeah, well…” Dean shrugged. After a pause, he continued. “So, speaking of….  How…. How was he? It? I mean, the sex. With Jesus.”
Cas looked at him, and his eyes were shining. The adoration glowing out of the familiar bright blue eyes was almost more than Dean could stand. He fought the urge to look down or away. Castiel held the latch to the barn door in one hand, and then reached up with his other hand and held Dean’s chin firmly. It didn’t hurt, but Dean could feel that Cas wouldn’t let him turn his head. The show of strength was both startling and exhilarating. The energy he was feeling all around them jumped up a notch.
“Last time we were in a barn like this, on the night we met, you stabbed me with a knife.”
“I’m ok to go, Castiel,” Dean answered at once, using Cas’ full name to reassure him of Dean’s seriousness and lucidity.
Dean opened his eyes first. “Holy shit, Cas. Holy shit. That was…. holy shit.”
Dean’s eyes widened into saucers. He almost broke out of the scene in his astonishment. Almost. But he was too good of a sub, too good of a boy, to do that. He swallowed the expletives that bubbled up to his lips, and nodded obediently.
“Dead people? Like zombies? Ewwww.”
Pulling away, he knelt at Dean’s feet again, and looked up into his eyes. Dean had heard Cas call him beautiful it seemed like 20 times tonight, but as he looked down at his angel staring so adoringly back up at him, he couldn’t think of another word to describe him except beautiful. He truly loved him.
Castiel shook his head fondly. “Humans and their obsession with sex being dirty. THAT idea definitely came from man, not God. Nothing we do is dirty, Dean. It is all beautiful. The only things that are truly dirty are born of cruelty and apathy and the non-consensual infliction of pain on another. Hunger, torture, greed…..” He reached up and stroked Dean’s face lightly with his fingers. “Believe me when I say, Dean Winchester, that there is only breathtaking beauty in me fucking you into the floor of this barn.”
“Do you need to take a break, Dean?”
“Hope what?” Dean asked, concerned at Cas’ slight frown. Karen Carpenter crooned mellowly from the radio. A Christmas song, of course. Dean couldn’t remember the name of this one.
Dean’s eyes narrowed at the man next to him.
“I’m going to drop to my knees, and take you in my mouth, and worship you.”
All of the store windows they passed were filled with Christmas decorations… scenes from various stories, ranging from Rudolph to Dr. Seuss to a Torrid store window featuring Krampus. Dean was tired and cold and was feeling increasingly agitated at the obvious and shiny capitalistic desperation adorning all the storefronts. He wanted home and he wanted whiskey. As soon as possible. He squashed the bad word rising up in his throat when Cas stopped at a display they had passed. He rolled his eyes and shifted his feet, barely glancing at the assemblage of figures nestled behind the window of a craft store.
“Yeah well, I didn’t know you yet. You could have been dangerous.”
“No. I’m ok to keep going,” Dean said, and his voice was strong and sure. Cas looked into his eyes, searching for truth, and then nodded his head, satisfied.
“Good boy,” Cas said softly. Dean bit down softly, rapturously, and Cas bit his own lip in response before pulling his thumb from Dean’s mouth.
The angel smiled wide like the cat that had caught the proverbial canary.
“I want to make you feel good, Dean. You deserve to feel good.”
“Some people believe it WILL happen. They believe that Jesus will one day return to Earth, and that the “true” (Cas OF COURSE did the finger quotes) Christians will magically rise up into the air, to meet Jesus in the sky. Or so says Paul in his letter to the Thessalonians. At least in one translation of that letter.”
Castiel knew that Dean saw himself as merely his brother’s caretaker, as he had been programmed to from an early age by his father. And by extension of that role, he saw himself as caretaker of the whole world. He saw his only worth in the saving of others. And since he was a man, and not a divine savior like that other humble man long ago who was also put up upon a plank of wood, Dean was not able to save everyone. This inability, or failure in Dean’s eyes, haunted him. He was unable to BELIEVE that he was a good man worthy of love until that voice in his head grew tired and stopped talking. Sometimes Dean drank to quiet the voice. Other times he went to bars and deliberately picked fights, in a not completely conscious endeavor to get the beating he felt he deserved. Sometimes he was careless on hunts, taking injuries that he could have evaded. But Castiel knew that Dean was stubborn, and resilient, and was doing these things to quiet that voice inside of himself so he could keep going. It was his fucked up way of atonement for the sins he thought he had committed, and his mechanism for release and the blessed relief that the ensuing endorphins brought him.  Castiel would rather Dean find release with him then on the filthy floor of a bar, unsure of how far the beating would go before it finally stopped. Dean asked his angel for absolution to quiet the demons in his head, and his angel obliged. Sometimes, if the voices got quiet enough, Dean COULD believe for a little while, that he was good. That he deserved to be loved. Cas needed him to hear the words and believe them.
Cas walked over and lightly put his hand on Dean’s arm, letting him know he was there. Dean let his arms down and turned around, looking up into the eyes of his angel. Castiel could see some of the fatigue in his eyes from the beating, but he could also see the endorphins zinging along under his skin. He could see the relief in his shoulders and his chest. He could see the lightness in him.
Dean laughs. “Yes, exactly. Just like those guys.”
Cas stood in front of him, looking him up and down. Dean loved this part, when Cas obviously had a whole plan probably marked through and collated and highlighted in his brain, and was just letting Dean stew for a minute, knowing how sweet and exquisitely painful the anticipation was.
They had finally come to the car, and Castiel stopped, realizing he had gotten caught up in the telling of the story. Dean cleared his throat, feeling the heat in his face.
Dean let it roll over him, all the praise and adoration and loving words and feelings of being GOOD. He shouted in pure joy and release, letting everything bubble up and out of him.
“All of these labels and restrictions don’t come from God. I’ve told you that. He created people to be happy and love each other, no matter what that looks like. Jesus wasn’t a word, really. He was just… Jesus. I guess if you HAD to label him, he would have been called ‘pansexual’.” Castiel made finger quotes in the air.  “He loved many people. And had many different lovers.”
“It’s ok. It just sometimes takes a little adjustment still…. my boyfriend being an angel and all that.”
“Yes,” Dean replied, just as seriously.
“Why would you worship a toilet, Dean? Of all the objects to worship, it seems an unlikely choice.”
Dean inhaled, and exhaled slowly. He thought for a moment, Cas letting him, and then he squared his shoulders again. “Yes, Cas. I need help.”
Dean swallowed, his throat bobbing, and nodded. He was listening.
“What do you say if you want me to stop?” Cas asked.
“Are you paying attention now, Dean Winchester?” Cas said almost menacingly, openly smirking. Dean’s eyes grew into saucers, feeling suddenly like prey caught in a spider’s web. But he kept his eyes open and his legs up, though his legs were starting to shake at this point. He nodded.
“Hello, Cas.”
“Don’t forget, Dean. Jesus was a divine being, but he was also a man. That’s what made him so special. People could relate to him, in ways they couldn’t relate to the angels or to God. Whenever angels would come down to speak to people, we ALWAYS had to tell people not to be afraid.  Not that it helped much. The people would always urinate. Or run away. Remember when we met? You stabbed me!”
“I’m glad,” Dean said. “I’m glad you knew him. And that you got to share that with him.”
Their breath made puffs of smoke in the air. The air was cold and quiet and heavy in that way that winter air is. They had parked off of a gravel road curving into a field. The black spears of a rail fence in shadow stood out against the horizon. There was no breeze, which was good  because it would have made the cold air intolerable. Though the temps were below freezing, they were mostly comfortable standing in their layers of flannel and coats, letting the alcohol warm their insides as well. The stars glittered sharp and brilliant against the black of the sky. Dean felt a little high, though he doubted he had consumed enough beers for that to be the reason. There was an electric something he felt buzzing just under the surface, between the breathless air, and the bright expanse of stars jeweled by the one giant shining star, and the rail fence, and the looming darkness of the trees nearby. Everything stood out in stark relief, as if cut from glass. He noticed a barn in the distance and smirked briefly, remembering.
“That’s just the point. Angels ARE dangerous. But Jesus was different. He had all the divine love from God, AND he was also human. He was a carpenter. He understood what it was like to BE human. To feel pain. To suffer. To be sad. To be in love. To be scared. To be excited. People think the special thing about Jesus was that he was this perfect person or pure person or that he was a virgin. Why would God invent sex for people if he didn’t want them to do it? Why would God create love that can be shared between people of the same gender if he didn’t want them to experience that? It makes no sense. Jesus was special because he was a human being, and because he was filled with love for EVERYONE. He was one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.”
“I know you, Dean. I know you get lost in your own head. You question yourself and you question your worthiness and you question if this is ok, and you miss out on the joy that is just the experience of having a human body. The experience of sharing your body with someone who loves you. With someone who desires you.”
Cas laid two fingers against Dean’s forehead and healed his wounds. Dean hummed at the odd sensation of his skin knitting back together so quickly. Cas then helped Dean finish dressing, and they held hands as they exited the barn. The air was bitingly cold after the warmth of the barn and their shared heat. Dean looked up into the sky, and felt dizzy for a minute, grabbing at Cas’ arm to steady himself. He didn’t look down though. The stars were beautiful. They took his breath away. He watched for a moment, and then tilted his head back down, catching Cas gazing at him softly.
“Wait just a minute. You, Castiel, my boyfriend, are telling me that you actually SLEPT with the son of God????”
“Oh god, that mouth, Cas. You feel so good.”
“The hopes and fears,” he gasped out. “Of all the years.” He gasped again, clenching his eyes shut, feeling the rush coming, knowing he couldn’t stop it. “Are met in thee.” He gulped one more breath. “Tonight.”
“Wait… you actually MET Jesus???? You never told me that!”
“Whew,” Dean breathed. “I thought maybe you were just using me for my body.” He grinned impishly.
Dean laughed out loud at that, knocking a shoulder into Cas. They were both still drunk on each other, high on life and love and the sweeping energy of the night.
“You’re doing so well, Dean. You are so beautiful. You are so good. You shine so brightly, brighter than that star outside.”
“Mmmmm?” Dean mumbled, lilting it up at the end into a question. An invitation. “Shall we take this to the back seat?”
“I think I would like that very much,” Castiel answered.
Serious songs. Dean didn’t want to recite anything he remembered his mom singing at Christmas cuz gross, though luckily he didn’t really remember her singing many songs at Christmas in the short time they had had together, so that was a win. A few silly ones came to mind quickly, but he believed Cas when he said he would spank him, and though that was sometimes fun, it would NOT be fun tonight, so he kept to his instructions. What SERIOUS Christmas songs did he know????? His shoulders ached from the constant stretch of his arms, and his cock felt like it was going to go off like a volcano if he didn’t come soon. He needed to do this.
“You sound just like Paul, going all puritan on me, Dean. We’ve used rope before. Why so squeamish all of a sudden?”
“Shhhhh….” Cas whispered, placing his finger against Dean’s mouth. He left it there, waiting until Dean opened up to him. Cas slipped his finger inside, resting it solidly against Dean’s tongue in that way that he knew Dean liked. Dean closed his eyes and his lips, suckling at Cas’ fingertip. Dean sighed in pleasure and his hips began to undulate beneath Cas’ body. Cas wasn’t sure that Dean was even aware he was doing that. He could tell that Dean was starting to slip under, into that space that let his brain be quiet and let him be free. The place where Cas could show him what rapture was really like. Dean’s shoulders raised up off of the bed and he pulled against the rope, feeling that he was held now. Secure. He didn’t have to decide if this was ok or not any longer. He could just submit. He could just float. Cas smiled down at his love adoringly, feeling a bursting sensation in his heart at the sight of the blissed out expression on Dean’s face. This was HIS ecstasy, giving this to Dean. He continued to stroke Dean’s tongue with one finger, and curled his thumb under Dean’s chin, moving his face to the side. He could feel Dean’s cock hardening in response to the manhandling of his face and his body. He leaned down and licked a stripe up Dean’s neck, biting softly at the vein that throbbed just beneath the skin. He shimmied back down Dean’s body, licking and biting down his neck and chest, lifting Dean’s chin up roughly with his thumb to expose more skin. The suction in Dean’s mouth was delicious. Castiel shivered, biting at the taut expanse of Dean’s sides and ribs. Cas licked teasingly at a nipple, just barely wetting it, and Dean lifted up as far as he could to chase the sensation. Cas sucked the nipple into his mouth, biting softly and insistently. Dean bent his knees up into the air, trapping Cas solidly between his thighs. They were both rutting against each other now, all heat and rubbing cloth and slick skin. Cas teased at the other nipple, sucking at it tenderly. Dean moaned and bit down softly at the finger in his mouth.
“It means I only do what I am enthusiastic about doing, and I don’t do anything I don’t want to do. It means I use my words, or other agreed upon means of communication. It means that either of us can change our minds or say stop whenever we want to.”
“You are beautiful, Dean. Glorious. You bring me so much happiness.” Dean panted and groaned above him, beginning to feel that exquisite pain of wanting and not getting. Cas rolled his balls in his hand gently.  “You are kind, and strong, and brave, and smart,” he continued, unhurried. “You are divine. And delicious.” And with that Castiel swallowed Dean down, taking his cock all the way into his mouth until he could feel it at the back of his throat. He moaned, letting Dean feel the vibrations in his throat. Dean tipped his head back and practically yelled, his hands shaking to hold onto the metal above his head. Cas pulled off and licked one long stripe up the underside of Dean’s cock, savoring the feel and taste along his tongue. He swallowed him again, taking his time and licking along the length of him. He caressed the insides of his thighs with his hands, moving up slowly to touch his balls, his ass cheeks, and finally back behind his balls and his hole. He petted him thoroughly and lovingly, all the while his tongue and lips keeping pace on his cock.
“Ok. I can do that,” Dean mumbled roughly. A wave of affection swept through Castiel, and he leaned in and kissed Dean hungrily. He was starting to lose his restraint. It was time to wrap this up.
“Words, please,” Cas said.
“Actually I believe YOU were the first one to mention a baby, Dean. And farm animals.” He clucked his tongue teasingly.
“You know I will,” Cas answered darkly. Dean shivered deliciously. He felt his cock twitching in his jeans in anticipation. He hoped he had the right idea.
“I’m driving though, cuz you’re still kind of shaky.”
“We didn’t have time to discuss kinks and safewords.”
Dean’s whole body was flushed now, pink and golden and beautiful. He could no longer keep still and his muscles rippled under his skin like water.
“Let me show you. What it is to be raptured.”
“I say ‘stop’, Cas,” Dean replied, equally as clearly. They had decided to keep instructions as simple as possible… no need to reinvent the wheel. Cas nodded, and then stood back. Dean knew that whatever happened now would continue as Cas wanted it to, until or unless Dean said to stop. He inhaled a big breath of air and then exhaled softly, feeling his muscles relax. He loved the part where he could stop thinking. Where his responsibility ended and he could just float in the simplicity of doing as instructed. He had no need to feel nervous or self-conscious, because he wasn’t in charge of ANYTHING at this point. He had permission, he had space, he had GRACE, to just experience the feelings in his body. How could he possibly mess up if none of the decisions were his to make? His body melted against the post at the same time as it lit up with anticipation.
They lay quietly for a minute, feeling the heat between them begin to cool, listening to their own breathing and the gradual slowing of their heartbeats.
“Yes?” Cas’ eyes were closed and he was beginning to drift.
Cas noticed. “What?” he asked.
“It IS a nice body,” Cas answered. “I should know.” He languidly unbuttoned the top button of Dean’s shirt, tracing just one finger under the fabric. Dean shivered at the sensation.
Cas cocked his head to the side in confusion.
Dean looked over at him seriously. “You are terrible, Castiel.” Cas started smiling his big, gummy smile. “You are a horrible, awful corndog and you are probably going to Hell for that.”
Cas ran his hands over Dean’s body reverently, as if Dean were a cherished thing. He ran his hands over the slopes of Dean’s face, petting down his cheeks. He leaned in and kissed Dean’s eyelids, his forehead, his mouth again. His hands wandered over Dean’s shoulders and he smoothed the backs of his hands up along the exposed undersides of Dean’s arms. He rubbed his hands lightly over Dean’s chest, relishing the silky slide of his skin there. He fingered his nipples a bit before slipping farther down to caress his stomach and his hips. Dean moaned in pleasure. It was an unrestrained sound, and Castiel felt pleasure upon hearing it. This was what he wanted for Dean.
Castiel suddenly smacked Dean across his ass, two slaps in quick succession on each cheek, leaving red handprints. Dean grunted, but said nothing. He pulled at the ropes and bit his lip, enjoying the heat in his body.
Dean’s teeth clicked back together.
Then without another word, he leaned down and licked into Dean’s hole. A groan punched out of Dean, it was so unexpected. He had never let himself be this vulnerable with anyone before. Cas’ tongue was relentless and firm, claiming him. He licked over his hole unceasingly, giving no pause for Dean to catch his breath. He speared him open on his tongue, fucking into him with it. Dean could feel tears on his cheeks, and he didn’t even care. He began to fly.
“Yeah,” Dean says, sitting all the way down on the floor, “Sometimes I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to it either.”
Castiel only smiled wider. “Well then, I guess I have no choice but to sing White Christmas at the top of my lungs as we walk to the car… a la Bing Crosby. I saw it in a movie the other day.”
Finally, he stood in front of his angel without a stitch of clothes on him. He blushed a bit, unable to help it. Cas smiled softly at him, his eyes full of love. The lust had burned back to coals for a moment. A pause.
“You could have stopped me at any time, Dean,” Cas said, and promptly pulled Dean close and kissed him. People continued to pass them on either side as they blocked the sidewalk with their bodies. Dean felt Cas’ lips curve up into a smile.
“I can understand,” Castiel said somberly. “I hope this hasn’t changed your mind about me. Or about us.”
Dean immediately did as he was told. The piece of rebar wasn’t so far above his head that it was immediately uncomfortable. He had a little give to work with. But it was high enough that his arms stretched all the way up, stretching his shoulders, chest, and stomach beautifully against the post. Dean closed his eyes, and Castiel let him, licking his lips at the sight of his beloved in front of him. He began.
Cas began to pull back onto the road. “You, Dean Winchester? Unable to control your roaming hands???? Why I’ve never heard of such a thing!”
Dean leaves Cas his shirt and underwear, stripping off the tie, and gently moves him around to tuck him in properly, thinking back on the times he did this for Sam when they were young. His dad was never one for sitting with Sam when he was puking or feverish, so Dean had done it, like Dean had done so many things.
Cas drove into him fast and rough now, unable to hold back. Dean pushed back against him to get the right tension and friction. Cas thrust relentlessly, letting the grace hold Dean and keep him safe from damage. He let himself go, pushing against skin and flesh and bone, eyes burning blue, feeling the pulsing of the grace and their heartbeats quicken, hearing the wanton sounds rolling unbidden from their mouths, feeling the coiling inside of them, thinking of the heavy air and heat of Eden, of snakes and trees and sex and love, of stars exploding and things made new, and then they both tipped over together, into a galaxy of pure sensation and pleasure and love. They hung there suspended for a moment, together, caught in the heat. Then they slowly fell back to Earth, like the sparks of blown out lights, twisting through the dark in a barn long ago.
Dean groaned one last time, and then whimpered, his body shaking, and his arms and shoulders finally slumping, about to give. Cas quickly stood up and said “Lower your arms now, Dean,”, and caught Dean as he released them and fell forward into Cas’ arms. Cas helped him gently to the ground where he held him in his lap. Whomever coined orgasm as the “little death” had the right idea, thought Castiel to himself. Dean was a dead weight in his arms. He let him rest, listening to his heartbeat slow and his breathing calm. Dean burrowed his face into Cas’ neck, the skin warm and smelling  vaguely of cinnamon. Cas rubbed Dean’s back and ran his fingers through his hair. Dean’s back was sticky with blood, but Cas knew it would still be a little while until Dean would feel it. He had time. And sometimes Dean would let him heal him afterwards. Sometimes not, and the choice was always Dean’s. He reached over and grabbed Dean’s flannel shirt, discarded on the floor, and draped it over him. Cas could give him a few minutes to float before he would get too cold.
“You know, we’re really not that close to home. Your little field trip here was unexpected, Cas.”
“Come on, let’s get back to the car,” Cas said, pulling him along. “You’re still coming down from the scene and I need to get you rehydrated and get some food into you.”
They lay in bed, both tired and feeling lazy together, but enjoying their togetherness in a way that made them not want to go to sleep yet. This kind of being together was still fairly new, but just old enough now to be comfortable. Or at least, beginning to be comfortable. It came more easily to Castiel, who felt easier in his own skin. Which was all kinds of ironic, since it had been a borrowed skin to begin with. But his big adjustment had been to the inhabiting of a human form. He had never felt any shame or regret about his gender or his sexual or romantic feelings towards other particular genders.  Dean’s struggles with his feelings about desire and affection and masculinity were fresher. It took losing Cas to the Empty for Dean to finally realize that life was indeed too short. It took hearing Castiel’s brave confession for Dean to feel safe enough to allow his own vulnerability to surface. He didn’t have to fear that his feelings wouldn’t be reciprocated. So in essence, he was a coward. But a now more contented coward that was lying here in bed with a man that loved him and whom he loved. And a coward that was at long last working through some of his shit. So he gave himself a little credit for that. If it took Castiel sacrificing himself and then resurrecting out of the Empty to pull Dean off of a nail in a barn where he hung like some kind of fucked up Jesus on a wooden cross, then so be it. With everything else they had gone through in the past few years, that maybe wasn’t even the weirdest thing that had happened to them.
“Kinky,” Dean said, his mouth quirking up in a challenge.
Cas laid his hand against Dean’s thigh, grounding him.
“Dean, I am very sorry. I did not predict this reaction.”
Dean nodded, accepting this. Wanting this. God, he wanted this.
“Yeah?” Cas prompted.
“I want this to be good for you. You deserve good things.”
“Better?” Cas asked, lips still close to Dean’s.
“What uh….. what’s with the rope?” Dean asked nervously.
“No, you’re just another brave man with a big heart that I happen to love deeply. AND you’re incredibly beautiful.”
They ALMOST got all of their Christmas shopping done before the first flakes fell. ALMOST.  Dean groaned when he saw the fat flakes sifting down to the sidewalk through the department store windows.
“The miracle!” Cas yelled back, playfully running ahead and dragging Dean along behind him. Dean bit the inside of his cheek to try to hide his grin at the sight of his serious angel of the Lord FROLICKING through the fields like a kid at recess. He didn’t quite manage it. Any reluctance on his part was now feigned, just to keep up his reputation as a hardened hunter who didn’t have time for any bullshit. He always had time for THIS kind of bullshit. He wondered briefly how cold and sodden it would be inside the barn, but again felt that faint electric something on the surface of his skin, and decided to stop worrying. He was with an angel, HIS angel, and he knew he would be ok, whatever it was he was walking into.
Dean blushed and ducked his head down. He lifted Castiel’s hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles.
“Yes, Dean? What would you like?” Cas asked coyly, pretending not to understand. He wanted Dean like this for as long as possible, pliant and well-behaved. Open and willing. Taking in pleasure and receiving praise. He didn’t want this to end yet.
“Can you still feel this, Dean? Feel my hands here?” he asked, making sure Dean wasn’t losing sensation.
“I love you, too,” Dean answered him, just as solemnly.
Dean lowered his arms all the way, his shoulders slumping.
“I’ll tell you about them later. You can find them in the dictionary under “douchebags”.
Cas pulled away from the kiss, his hand reaching up to Dean’s face, turning his head to the side roughly. He held his face lovingly but firmly, and dipped a finger into Dean’s mouth. Dean sucked it in eagerly, feeling the luscious sensation of fullness it provided. Holding Dean’s head firmly to the side, knowing Dean liked to be manhandled when in this state of subspace, Cas licked down his throat, nipping and biting as he went. He tasted the salt of Dean’s sweat on his chest, and then grazed over his nipples with his teeth, settling to lick and bite at one, and then the other. Dean suckled harder at his fingers, moaning in contentment. Cas turned his teeth and tongue to the other nipple, letting the fingers of his free hand pinch and play at the other, continuing relentlessly until Dean started bucking against him, trying to get friction against his cock. He was losing control again. Cas lapped harder at his nipple, sucking and biting, his fingers rolling and pinching the other, until he thought Dean might come just from that. Then he finally pulled away, his free hand rubbing Dean’s flushed chest down gently. Dean settled a bit, still sucking at Cas’ finger and whimpering quietly.
“Are you going with me, Cas?”
And then Castiel, angel of the Lord, FINALLY pushed open the door. Dean glanced up as they walked in, seeing flashes of light as glass shattered above them. Of course, he thought. He smiled and took a second to wipe the moisture from his face. They walked in solemnly, just as Castiel had all those years before. Except this time, Dean’s hand was clasped tightly in his. The sparks of light from the exploding bulbs above echoed the brilliance of the stars they had left behind outside. Dean’s skin felt heated by the hum of energy all around them, but not uncomfortably so. The lightness of their banter at the car and their run through the field was now gone, but not in a bad way. This felt heavier, like the heaviness of thick silk against the skin, or the richness of a renaissance painting. Dean was just concentrating on keeping up at this point, unable to guess what Castiel had planned next, and still feeling slightly drunk from the words Cas had just spoken.
“I’m right here, Dean. Open your eyes.”
“Are you ok?” Dean asked finally, after he had mostly caught his breath. Cas’ heart broke in affection for this sweet man, a regular human asking if an angel of the Lord was ok, right after he had gotten his mortal world rocked, literally.
“Dean,” he said, his serious voice back, low and scratchy. “What does consent mean?”
“A bunch of naked dudes up in the sky? Really? Sounds kinky.”
“Ewww, gross. Don’t bring your mom into our sexual escapades, Dean. That’s highly inappropriate.”
“Is this what humans do? Human friends, that is?” Cas asks in a whisper. Dean can tell he is close to falling asleep.
Dean easily pushes Cas’ hand down.
“You can pick the song. Or I can pick one for you, if you like. But it must be a serious one. I’m not going to blow you to “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas”, Dean. I warn you, you mouth off to me and you get spanked over my knee and put back in the car and that’s the end of it.”
“I have found that restraining you, which we started just as “kinky fun” as you put it, helps you to relax. Helps you to just feel what is happening. You worry less about where your hands should go or what you’re supposed to do or how your body is responding. Is that correct?”
Dean huffed a little. “Still cool,” he said under his breath.
“Did I tell you to lower your arms, Dean?”
“Oh man, I guess that pastrami WAS too old, wasn’t it? Dammit. I TOLD Sammy to clean out the fridge last week.”
The crooning did indeed commence as they exited the store and began the walk to the car, bags in hand.
For once, in the face of a declaration of love, Dean kept his eyes open and didn’t tell Cas to stop. He was ok. This was ok. This was more than ok.
Cas gives him a pathetic thumbs up.
He took a breath, and began.
“To worship means to adore, and I adore you, Dean. And I want to adore you, as a practice. An action. An act of love. I want you to feel in your body how much I love you, and how much I want you.”
Dean nodded in understanding. They continued walking, dodging other shoppers. Dean looked over at Cas, bit his lip, and looked down.
Dean shook his head no.
“You ok to keep going, Dean?” Cas asked, just to check in once more.
Dean quickly walked over to the other post and gave it a cursory once over before turning back towards Castiel. He was feeling more than eager at this point.
Cas is sitting up, leaning against the cold porcelain of the toilet bowl. He tries to smile when he sees Dean, but can’t quite make it this time.
“Are you asking if I use frankincense deodorant, Dean?” Cas asked, his own mouth curving up into a smile.
“Stop,” Dean replied. They weren’t fancy.
A song came to him. A Christmas carol. Cas had mentioned the star of Bethlehem earlier. Dean remembered the first verse of a song about Bethlehem. He couldn’t remember where he had heard it, but he was pretty sure he could get through it. The first verse at least. Maybe. Hopefully. He rolled his shoulders back to stretch the muscles there a bit. Cas saw the look in his eyes change.
“Oof, sorry Cas. You ok?”
Cas shrugged, smiling. “I guess? Who knows. Humans are kind of obsessed with zombies, aren’t they? Dead people coming back to life. Although of course, I guess we’re ones to talk.”
Cas leaned in kissed him deeply, opening his mouth right away and taking in Dean’s tongue. One of his hands slipped down to Dean’s throat, holding him forcefully in the way he knew that Dean liked. In the way that made Dean feel desired. Dean melted under the touch, moaning softly. Cas fingered his throat gently with his thumb, before tightening his grip again, careful to do it just right. Just hard enough, just long enough, in just the right spot. Dean’s cock twitched against Castiel.
“Ok, angel. Feed me and take me home. But I might not be able to keep my hands to myself all the way there.”
“I thought, back at the car, we might get up to something tonight. Then you started talking about babies and stuff. Doesn’t seem appropriate anymore, does it?”
“Ah yes, like the guys who wear sunglasses indoors.”
Castiel stood up from the bed abruptly and began walking around the room, rummaging around their things. He continued to talk as he rummaged.
