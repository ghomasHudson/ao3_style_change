But hell, he can’t help it. Cas just went and said
He puts his phone to the side after having looked at a few more videos and instead takes his hardening dick in hand, closing his eyes and imagines Dean as he masturbates. It’s a spectacular orgasm and Cas hates to admit it but maybe the girls are onto something?
“At this rate I’ll tell you to speed it up,” Dean grits and Castiel grins to himself, bowing his back to press momentarily even closer.
might actually be the one crushing on the boy. Though it’s fine, he thinks, as long as Dean is in fact not interested back (and he doesn’t seem to be?), they’re
Castiel wants to hug him. And kiss him, and-and maybe explore, and—
He still feels responsible, though, and wonders briefly when that will stop too.
Cas swallows, body lighting up. “Because you brought food and don’t want to be disturbed while eating?”
Dean is entirely too cheerful when Cas opens his door for the boy on Thursday evening. Cas’ heart aches even as he feels his body flush at the prospect of being alone with Dean. Just seeing him in school has been hard enough since he sent the text. Somehow he supposes he had thought it would open Pandora’s box and Dean would start texting him on the regular and he doesn’t know if he’s relieved or disappointed that that hasn’t happened (though it’s probably the latter).
Dad stopped in the hallway outside Dean’s room, looking surprised. Probably because of Dean’s whiny tone, Dean must have been ten the last time he pleaded with his dad like that and then it was because the model airplane he was building wasn’t cooperating.
“So, anything new on your end?”
He was cut off, completely caught off guard, when Cas more or less grabbed his face and claimed his lips in a heated kiss, easily taking advantage of Dean’s surprise to push his tongue inside, licking deep. Owning, claiming.
“I’m a succubus?”
This night is different, though. Because
Dean closed his eyes for a moment, seething with rage. Sammy was of course talking about how Dean had acted earlier after he’d witnessed Cas in the bathroom. He’d not shut up about it once since Dean had snuck away. So what if Dean didn’t want to confront Cas about what he had heard and nearly seen? And that he didn’t want to tell Cas how that had made him react. Maybe he wanted all of that for himself, huh, Sammy?
Dean nodded, expression very somber. “I can see that. I guess it’s okay. For tonight.”
(You should force him)
Dean flashed him that wonderfully cocky grin of his. “Deal.”
Dean dragged a hand down his face. He hated lying to his brother.
And if his mind drifts to thoughts of Dean’s naked body and his own sordid browsing history, then that’s something he will address later, perhaps together with Dean when he’s feeling better, or perhaps not.
“Yes!” Castiel exclaimed, slumping in his seat, almost sagging. He hadn’t even known this was weighing on him until he felt that his feelings were validated. “There’s something to him. An innocence that’s… There’s this sense of childishness to him and that’s not attractive to me, don’t get me wrong. But the innocence, it makes me feel protective and I want to hold him close and…”
“Dean?”
Well of course it’s not as simple as that but still, Dean’s always excited when he sits down to do the start-up procedure for another long flight. And he likes it even more since he started flying the big Boeing 777 because those sleeping compartments are
“I was thinking pie,” he mumbles, even though he’d planned on keeping that a secret.
Gabe just grins at him and dances ahead of Cas’ cart, glancing into it like a rude peacock. “Broccoli?”
Dean had to fight
“You’re…” Dean felt his stomach clench unpleasantly as the demon snarled at her words. “You’re not wrong.”
Castiel squirms, happy. “Okay.”
*****
Dean got in the tub, closing the curtain as he started the shower, only having to wait for a short moment before it got hot enough to wash off the grime of the fight. And while he waited, well he couldn’t help if his mind strayed. Cas had looked badass fighting those assholes, and he’d taken more hits than Dean but had only grunted and kept on fighting.
(Yeah, okay)
“Like when you almost died,” Dean mumbled.
Time stands still.
He says it with such affection that it makes Castiel squirm. He fiddles with Dean’s shirt for a moment, eyes down, fidgeting in his seat.
“And Raphael was one of those?” The name tasted funny rolling off Dean’s tongue.
Else? Castiel can barely think anymore. He’s too close to coming, desperate to feel Dean’s dick against his naked skin, desperate to make the other man come, hopefully on him, and absolutely frantic to release against Dean.
to just
“Precious,” Cas rumbled and sat back on his knees, his cock hard and jutting out in front of him. Dean’s eyes were instantly drawn to it, but he didn’t have much time to look before Cas grabbed him with strong hands and manhandled him to roll over to his stomach.
“Now c’mon, Cas,” he said with a grin when he felt the emotions well up inside, unfamiliar and frightening and absolutely stunning. “Be that guy for me and rock my world before I cream my pants.”
Cas managed to get a hand between them, grabbing them both in one hand and the feeling almost punched the air out of Dean. He stuttered out a groan into the kiss, breaking free to say something but immediately forgetting what. Cas murmured something Dean didn’t comprehend and continued stroking them, leaning in to nip and lick Dean’s shoulder.
If things had been crazy at the bar before the auction it was even worse now. The bartenders were looking haggard and Dean felt sorry for them. Considering his earlier thoughts regarding Cas’ drinking and the ridiculous amount of people around the bar he decided to settle for two sodas and planted himself at one end, prepared to have his patience tested.
Currently he was out in Cas’ backyard, poking around. Cas was at work, which was something humans did that was important and sometimes, like in Cas’ case, something they thought was fun. Cas didn’t go away for work much, mostly he did stuff in his home office and Dean was happy about that. He didn’t understand much about Cas’ work, even though the man answered all of Dean’s questions, but he thought it sounded fun. More fun than doing nothing all day, he supposed at least.
(Yeah she might’ve killed him by now, good going)
Dean immediately squeezed his eyes shut. “Why not?”
“I can’t win against you, can I Dean Winchester?”
Dean’s knee burned where Cas had touched him hours ago. He swallowed hard.
Gabriel nodded, winked once at Dean, and then the two went back to the kitchen with the tray, presumably to get something to eat the pies on, since humans preferred such things as plates and forks.
He snorted and grabbed her hips, pushing up into her as she started rolling with his movements. Just like when she sucked on his cock, this seemed mechanical and practiced. Dean didn’t care, just wanted to get off and her inner walls were warm and wet, squeezed him just right.
Okay, that wasn’t part of any plan to do anything, that was purely self-indulgent. And because Cas seemed to like it when they took flight together. This time was no different and as they soared through the sky, high above the clouds where it was cold enough that Dean needed extra layers, his problems started seeming pretty small. And simple.
“N-no,” Castiel stammered in a way that told Dean he totally wanted to touch Dean’s nipples. Maybe suck on them while he jerked off. Well fuck, there was an image… “No, I shouldn’t—you should leave…” he was turning away, stumbling to get out of the kitchen and fucking
“I…” Cas turned to the horse, slowly stroking Boxer’s mane. “I do, but…”
“Yeah you fucking do,” Dean grunted, taking his own cock in hand and stripping it harshly. “Are you gonna come for me?”
Just remembering the way Cas had tried to communicate with Dean made him shiver unpleasantly.
Dean was at a total loss for words and wit, completely lost as Bart roared with laughter and the woman, whom he assumed was Rachel, only shook her head, looking mortified.
Oh but that’s another thing to worry about: what if Dean doesn’t like spanking? What if it does nothing for him? Will he do it anyway, in a sort of lackluster way, just to be nice to Castiel? Or does he actually abhor it? Will he condemn Castiel for even considering it? Leave him?
“I will never forgive you if Dean ever finds out about the preparations and leaves.”
exaggeration would be a lie. Dean was a sexual creature and most of the time jerking off didn’t quench his inner slut, to so speak. Besides, after craptastic weeks like this one Dean was usually pent up from having had basically no time for self-loving.
Sam arrived with impeccable timing, just when Dean was pulling the meat off the grill, and the smile he offered Dean just about made up for Dean’s anxiety over being away from Cas. Sure, he missed his angel but he’d missed stuff like this too, seeing his family and making them happy with something as simple as a good dinner.
It crept slowly along the ground, belly almost pressed against it and with its ears flat back, mouth open on a low warning growl. That growl filled Dean’s ears, his field of vision narrowing down to the approaching animal.
“Are you saying I wouldn’t like your dick?”
“Dean,” Cas laughed, big and bright and oh so beautiful. “Your kink is about pleasing
“Imagine what havoc someone who looks human, but who doesn’t adhere to a human moral code, could wreak.”
Cas drew a big breath, eyes searching Dean’s, and Dean’s whole being surged for the man. He wanted Cas to kiss him and hold him and tell him everything was alright. He wanted Cas to take him home and to spread him out on their bed and never, ever let him go.
Dean grunted harshly when he bottomed out, dick straining inside Cas as if to reach just a
“Pie.” Sam finishes with amusement.
Or Cas could just as well be right beyond the stretch of the shadows, in a heap, dying from exhaustion.
Sure, on any other day he’d be happy for his dad but not tonight, not when he’d been so obtusely rejected in front of fucking everyone, for a
Dean cries out and arches his back, pushing his chest up against Cas’, hole clenching around Cas’ throbbing cock. And then Dean opens his eyes, looking right at Cas, and Cas is stuck by how beautiful Dean is in his pleasure.
From inside the house, an officer calls for the sergeant and she excuses herself. Sam lets her go with a forced smile and a “thanks for your time” and as soon as she’s gone, Dean kicks into gear.
“Y-yeah,” Dean bites his lower lip, clearly aiming to give Cas’ a heart-attack. “Sorry, I know it was wrong of me to—”
Castiel bows his head, smiling. “It’s understandable that she doesn’t.”
Cas makes a weird noise and closes his eyes against his own emotions when Dean chuckles at him. “You completely overwhelm me.”
“You’re brilliant, Dean,” Cas rumbles. “Intelligent and charming, and so beautiful.”
Cas puts his hands on Dean’s chest and pulls him close just as Dean notices that he’s crying so much that it makes the kiss wet for all the wrong reasons.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, rolling his eyes and grinning at Cas because duh, he understood as much without being told.
time and was still in the same spot when Charlie returned from the break room.
“I suppose, if he really knew the demons were coming for
Castiel slapped the same cheek hard, harder than he normally would have. “Shut up, your pathetic attempts at explaining yourself are turning me off.”
“I’ll come in my pants like this,” Dean moans and though the thought is tantalizing to Cas (Dean coming any which way is tantalizing, to be honest), he knows that’s not what Dean wants right now.
suck him off. His blood felt on fire and he didn’t know when but somewhere along the line he’d lost his hat. It lay discarded on the bed and Dean didn’t even care. Cas’ hair was sweaty, and Dean was gritting his teeth as pleasure pulsed through him.
“That’s it,” she sighed as if this was his first rodeo and he needed instructions, or encouragement.
“Yes,” Cas cradles Dean for a moment, suddenly desperate to protect this boy. Who hurt him? Why? There’s so much blood, Cas’ stomach is churning unpleasantly. “You’re safe now.”
, feels right again. Dean
“Oh no,” he whines and his body jerks hard before a warm wetness spreads between them, coating both their stomachs.
“No, I-I…”
After they’d put away the tools, Castiel stopped momentarily outside the shed to gather some leaves in his hands and press them over the perennial flowers next to the tool shed. He got to his feet when he was done, clapping his hands to get rid of dirt and saw Dean flexing his own hands while looking at them, and the dirt that all but covered them.
Thank you all SO MUCH for the overwhelmingly awesome support! I'm incredibly happy you liked the start to this fic 💖💖💖
Lily turned slowly and Castiel fully expected to see betrayal on her face, considering him switching costume now would mess with her plans just as much as Andrea’s earlier refusal had.
That was the first time Dean said that and Castiel hadn’t known what to say. He honestly still doesn’t, even now. That Dean wouldn’t be good enough is inconceivable to him and he does his best to show the man that he is
“No problem, I can pay for the both of us.”
“A few times a week.”
Sam bobbed his head, still grinning. “Yeah.”
He stood to the side, sipping the last of his whisky, the alcohol getting to his head a little, and listened perhaps a tad bit too eagerly as Cas spoke in the harsh language. It was beautiful, Dean thought, in its own exotic way, and he had to close his legs a little when he imagined Cas speaking sweet nothings in that language, perhaps when they were alone in bed…
Dean apparently took that as an incentive to start kissing Castiel again because he turned his head and connected their lips without hesitation. Castiel pulled in a deep breath and grabbed Dean’s body more greedily, pulling him closer as they both opened up, tongues curling hotly as their bodies grinded together.
Castiel blinked once and then ducked his head a little, covertly looking to the other side to make
Cas’ dick felt hard and unyielding in Dean’s mouth. Hot and heavy and tasting of bitter saltiness. It made Dean moan and he pulled off almost immediately to lick around the head, prodding the slit for more taste, before endeavoring to swallow as much of Cas as he could. He groaned deeply at the feeling of Cas’ dick filling his mouth, cutting off his air.
Cas just laughed soundlessly and put his head down on the ground, body relaxing.
“Hey now,” Dean shushes gently, fingers so incredibly nimble again as he tears into the condom package. “We’re gonna circle back to that too, I suspect it’s got something to do with your Beta family but hey, look at me,” as soon as their eyes meet Dean straightens to sit on his knees over Castiel’s waist, hands going back to grab at Castiel’s rock hard cock. “I want you, Alpha. Can I?”
“Forget the meds, I could use more kisses instead.” Dean grins, wriggling his eyebrows and somehow making it look more seductive than amusing.
“I’m sorry, how foolish of me. I’m Cas, Dean,” his eyes lit up for a moment, the glow too familiar for Dean’s stomach not to knot itself. “Well actually my full name is Castiel, but I prefer Cas. I’m at last strong enough to take on other forms and I took this one so we can finally talk properly.”
Cas jerked and let out a small, pleasurable sigh when Dean bucked lightly against him.
needs to control his inner Alpha.
his phone asks him, and it feels like a cold shower. His left thumb hovers over “Keep editing” but he’s saved from his struggles when his doorbell rings and his right thumb slips on “Ignore” all on its own. Dean’s contact is automatically deleted, and his phone exits the app.
“No,” Dean mumbled, tilting his head to the side as he looked into the bird’s lifeless eyes. “I don’t think Cas…”
That makes Castiel laugh, and he feels elated and loved, cherished in Dean’s presence, and comforted in the knowledge that he makes Dean feel the same.
“On the beach?” he asks, breathless. “You’ve used it to pleasure yourself?”
Well, I gotta say the ending of this fic lined up nicely with the sixth month anniversary of canon!Destiel (yesterday) and my birthday (today) 😄
It’s different with Dean, however, and not only because they’re lovers. Dean expresses himself much more physically than verbally, and Castiel has learned that that extends to others as well. Sam, for one, is also much more hands-on than Castiel is used to. But watching Sam slap Dean jovially on the shoulder doesn’t evoke jealousy in Castiel, not like with Benny.
“Hello,” Castiel almost mumbled, unprepared to actually be addressed.
gives me.”
“Client satisfaction is important,” he said with a laugh. “So thank you.”
Cas’ eyebrows shoot up his forehead. “I don’t know what you mean by that.”
“The best,” Dean groaned, sliding down the couch and resting his head back. He couldn’t help but smirk when he thought about Cas’ face. “He had the most
. With
That made Cas pause with his sandwich halfway to his mouth. “Maybe…” he slowly lowered the sandwich. “Maybe I shouldn’t go out today. We could have a quiet day in.”
He grumbled to himself all the way home. He’d been trying to woo Lisa for a while now and while she didn’t outright refuse him, she also didn’t really encourage him either. Sam said she was playing him to get the best cut of meat, but he’d started giving her the lesser cuts and her attitude hadn’t changed either way. Maybe she just didn’t know good meat from bad, when dressed fancily even a scant rabbit could look fat enough after all.
“You’re too fucking good for me,” Dean grumbles and it seems he’s unwilling to let Castiel go but he does anyway, in favor of their dinner not burning.
Dean’s hands on Castiel’s butt feel divine and he moans wantonly when Dean squeezes extra hard. Pleasure travels up and down his body, making his skin feel prickly and hot, and he’s grabbing onto Dean with abandon, desperate for the man. Dean’s mostly just massaging the meat on his ass, kissing Castiel’s neck and shoulder but it feels
Twice he’d fallen asleep on the couch and Cas had left him there the whole night. Dean had felt a hole in his chest when he woke up alone, but he didn’t say anything to Cas about it.
Castiel’s tongue clicks against the roof of his mouth when he swallows and he presses his head back against Dean’s pillow, senses overwhelmed with the Omega’s scent and body. God, Castiel almost passes out when his thick knot is forced inside the Omega’s willing hole.
“I like cats.”
(Hold it in, just a little more, Deanmon)
“Thanks, Cara,” said the cashier, smiling as the barista walked off. With a little nudge, she pushed the cup closer to Dean. “On the house.”
“Ah, yes,” Cas hissed, hips twitching to meet Dean’s hand and mouth now, foot hard against Dean’s weeping dick. “Fucking
Cas chuckled and went over to a chest of drawers, pulling the top one out and producing a pair of glasses, only they were dark. Dean had seen humans use those countless times to shield their eyes from bright light, like the sun.
“It’s fine. I’m a demon and—”
(Cas knows you’re too weak)
Sammy didn’t say anything, but Dean could feel his approval anyway.
Outside a strong wind met him, immediately biting into his cheeks, and Dean grimaced against it. So far, they’d been blessedly without snowstorms, but they were coming. If the light snowfall this morning and the winds now were anything to go by, they could very well be stuck with dad in their cabin for a few days.
, Dean still hadn’t contacted Cas and hadn’t been to the Gas-N-Sip and Cas hadn’t contacted him either. Dean tried not to take it personally since his reason for not at least texting Cas wasn’t personal in the least but damn it was hard anyway.
“Nothing weird coming over the wire,” he mumbles. “Social media looks clean.”
But now here Dean is at Cas’ doorstep and Cas can honestly say he has hated the thought of never seeing the boy privately again.
of all people, the mom of Dean and Sam’s childhood friend Jo and the owner of the only tavern in the village. When the fuck had that happened? Well, Sam said they’d only been talking and shit, but they’d been sitting close and laughing and Dean couldn’t take it.
Hey guys! Happy Thursday 😆
It was such a non-demon reaction that Castiel wondered (not for the first time) how Dean could have survived for so long without the other demons killing him in cold blood. And not only that, his unique (for a demon) sense of right and wrong was astonishing and more than a little curious.
“My mom was a demon, okay?!” Dean shrieked, showing that he most definitely had some kind of demonhood in him when his voice cut through Castiel’s soul, every word laced with magic intended to hurt.
“You’re hoping he will tell you,” Balthazar said in a kind tone. “Given time he might.”
He comes a moment later, his orgasm goaded on by Dean’s panting, and Castiel forces open his eyes, looking down at Dean as he pumps the condom full inside the man. Dean’s more aware than Castiel was prepared for and the smoldering look he receives makes his orgasm a thousand fold better.
But it goes to sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with Dean, watching Hell’s Kitchen and eating cup ramen. It goes to Dean laughing when Cas doesn't understand the rules of Basketball, it goes to sharing an ice cream because Dean ate his too fast and still wanted more.
A lot of things were Cas’ treat, and though Dean didn’t mind that considering he was rather poor, he also wanted the other man to know that he could provide for himself. Dean was an independent kind of guy, after all.
Dean’s hands skated back, grabbing Cas’ ass, fingers dipping between his cheeks and Dean could feel how heated Cas was even in the cool water.
And those
“I’m a grown woman,” Mrs. Moseley snaps. “I decide when I want to have lunch myself, thank you very much, boy,” there’s a beat of silence in which Dean doubles over trying to silence his laughter and Cas looks incredulously at the intercom. “Between the hours of twelve and one o’clock,” she concludes, and Cas breathes out, grinning and shaking his head fondly. “Good day, Principal.”
“Cas, I’ll come,” Dean whines, the grip on Cas’ hand increasing as the young man’s dick jumps.
“And?”
Sam looked displeased. “You don’t have to snap at me, you make it sound like I just insulted your wife or something.”
“That’s right. And the food both here,” he tapped the fridge. “And in the pantry, are mostly uncooked. Although I suppose as a demon you would have no problem eating raw meat and the like.”
“That was your grace, wasn’t it?” he mumbled, hand trembling as he reached out and touched the angel’s face for the first time. “It
When it was almost fully hard, Dean pulled off, letting it slide out his mouth as he pressed his tongue flat against the underside on the way up. Cas sighed and stirred again but Dean’s attention was on the man’s cock now. It was a dark shade of pink, glistening with Dean’s saliva, and standing to attention just the way Dean liked it.
Cas was on him as soon as he entered their clearing. Not bouncing over like a dog, or padding up like a cat, but full on landed with an ear-crushing
Cas brushes his thumb over Dean’s cheekbone, silencing him. “You’re not expendable, Dean.” He says with conviction. “You’re valuable and loved.”
gold and we can still get a hefty sum from Crowley. But also, what the fuck are we doing? We’re no prospectors.”
, Dean. They all look the same, basically.”
Castiel thought wildly, meeting Dean’s hooded eyes with his own lust-blown ones.
“I think it’s fun,” he said with a wide smile but wanted to say so much more. Wanted to say that he loved it, that it was quirky and awesome and that Cas was his and everyone should know.
“Lay off,” Dean laughed and swathed at Cas’ snout. “That tickles.”
Cas stutters out something unintelligible, cock jumping so hard he has to grab it and Dean can’t help but grin wider, winking as he steps in again, pulling the condom out of the package.
, can I?”
“Th-that’s fine,” Dean hastes over to the bedside table as Cas shucks off the bedspread and pulls one of his pillows to the center of the bed. “What’s that for?”
squeak but it came damn close.
“My ass is sweating,” he squeaked and slumped down in his chair, taking a moment to level his breathing before he started on the arduous task of fixing the report.
Dean swallowed, wishing Cas would just come and join them already. “Well, you know how I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time out here in the forest lately? I didn’t build this cabin just because I was tired of living in the village, you know.”
Michael crosses his arms and tries to look down his nose at Dean. It goes a little so-so considering they’re basically the same height.
spank bank.”
“I mean… if you really need it?”
red-head.”
“Fuck,” Dean whispers. “D’you live far from here?”
Cas’ smile was kind and
happening. This guy who had been in Dean’s room for some goddamn reason was going to fucking fuck Dean, apparently whether Dean wanted it or not.
“Good,” Lisa repeated. She tucked a strand of her long, raven hair behind an ear when he looked up, squirming a little in place, chest out. “It’s just, I haven’t seen you around much.”
The customer scoffs and turns away and Castiel feels marginally bad about the shop losing a potential future customer, or more, but also knows that Nora thinks that homophobes can make their flower purchases somewhere else. He hopes the woman is simply upset that Dean is taken, because he
“Fuck
Dean almost drools when she puts out a huge apple pie in the middle of the table. “You remembered,” he mumbles, turning to Cas and taking his hand.
“Don’t go there,” Dean growls lowly, brushing his lips against Cas’ when the Alpha’s scent turns subdued. “I fucking love what we do in bed,
“Yeah I am,” he stated but it sounded like a question so Castiel nodded for good measure.
“What the hell’s a ‘cheekini’?”
“I love when you squirm for me, Dean,” Cas rumbled then, his voice deeper with his arousal. “You’re absolutely beautiful.”
“Hey, see if they have lip gloss in a matching color.”
“Look at me,” he whispered, and Dean obeyed, just like he always did. So perfect for Castiel alone. “You’re incredible, absolutely stunning.”
(Because he thinks you’re weak)
There was a gravel road going right through it, headed east out of the village and splitting the forest until it gave way for marshes some 60 miles due southwest. Dean had only gone on that road once, when he was younger, and he didn’t care much for it. Mostly, only the traders came and went on that road and Dean was no merchant. Like his father, and his father before him, Dean was a hunter, responsible for bringing wild game and herbs to the village. It was a Winchester tradition of sorts and Dean liked it well enough, liked the many hours spent alone in the forest and liked the appreciation of bringing home fresh berries or juicy hares for roasting.
a drinking establishment,” he mumbles, eyeing the group as Dean Winchester and Jesse Cuevas gather up the balls to clearly start a new game of pool.
Heat travels up and down his spine, one glance over his shoulder reveals that Cas’ arm is moving as well now and Dean feels perverse satisfaction at having managed to break the man’s stoic façade.
“So what do you say,” Cas was grinning, Dean could feel it against his skin. “It’s your turn to decide what we do in bed.”
a fool… “And Mrs. Winchester too, good day.”
That one other time when he had been the assailant he had had to roughly fuck a woman and it had kind of tore at his heart when she had whimpered in pain. He had received good reviews though so he had thought it was fine. Now he was thinking maybe it wasn’t because damn, he would be doing this more often now, wouldn’t he?
“Ah,” Castiel wants to say yes so badly. “No, I-I,” he coughs, hates how he stammers when he’s nervous. “I don’t know what it is.”
“Damn,” he muttered, pursing his lips. “I need practice.”
“What?” he eyes his own office door apprehensively. “What meeting did I forget about now?”
Dean was bodily bigger than Castiel but it was clear to Castiel that the man wanted to submit so he grabbed Dean’s short hair and turned his head as he wanted to. Dean made the most delicious whimpering sound and his hands clenched against Castiel’s sides when the kiss turned dirty and owning.
you want, darling,” he said sweetly before leaning in and capturing Dean’s cupid bow lips in a slow kiss.
Castiel nodded. “Yes, exactly.”
The end! For now at least, it was fun revisiting this AU 💖
“This for me, old man?” Dean murmurs, his tone husky and Cas breathes out shakily.
He grabbed Cas’ arm, more out of instinct than fear, and arched his back as best he could, looking up at Cas with dark eyes, lips parted.
Also the fact that Dean can’t leave the cockpit unattended means he hasn’t been able to even look at the man for a long while and Dean’s kind of starved to be honest. It’s like now that he’s decided to allow himself this, he needs it right the fuck
Now he only wants Dean.
“A mixed breed.”
Cas looks at him with the eyes of a beast and it makes a pleasurable chill run through Dean’s whole body. His dick quivers and Cas obviously notices. He presses his lips together and brushes his hand up Dean’s dick, pressure so teasing it makes Dean kick out a little.
“I always thought humans were frail. That’s…” he looked up, face much more expressive than Castiel suspected Dean knew himself. “That’s what I heard.”
“Relax, papa,” Lily said softly, grabbing his chin and forcing him to look up at her. “It’s the lipstick Aunt Anna gave us. Look, it’s still unused.”
“Dean Winchester, freshman. Do you need my student ID too?”
Too bad that Castiel was also a massive
The basket was as pristine and clean (unused) as it had been when Castiel had brought it out for Dean to carry leaves in and Castiel smiled to himself as Dean all but skipped by his side over to the small tool shed opposite Dean’s apple tree.
He takes Dean’s hand in his, the grip warm and strong without being overbearing, and when he squeezes Dean’s hand well fuck, Dean’s kind of a goner already but that really seals the deal.
But that was about the time where everything went down the drain. Because Tom was apparently the kind of guy who liked to use mirrors during sex and while that in and of itself wasn’t a bad thing for Dean, Tom
Cas’ cock was as big and hard as all the other times Dean had touched it and he moaned shamelessly at the feeling of it pressed between his legs, against his own dick, warm against his stomach as Cas left him there, prone on the ground and the angel on his knees above him. Like this, Dean didn’t see anything else other than Cas’ massive cock and the angel’s furry stomach and feathery chest. It was his pinning fantasy from the other day, only so much more because this time Cas was aroused too and fuck, was he…?
“Yeah,” Sam nodded as they pulled into the motel. Once he put the impala in park, he turned to tell Jack to wait a minute before rushing into their room but found that the kid was already opening the door and rushing out.
Past Jack watched in surprise and slight terror as his future self lowered his hand immediately, his eyes falling back to their normal blue.
“That’s ridiculous,” she shook her head abruptly, “If anything my senses are heightened.”
Cas spun around at that, his mouth wrinkled tightly and his eyes lit with anger as he marched back over to the hunter, “Like I always do? And who is it that always forces me to leave?”
“It’s worth a shot, I guess,” Jack nodded, “If she really was created using Castiel’s grace, then she shouldn’t be as powerful as me.”
Dean drew a sharp breath, then coughed when the pain arose again, “I thought you healed me, why does it still hurt like a bitch?”
“How did you—“
“Okay,” Sam nodded in trusting and dropped his hand, backing away from Jack, “Her name is Joey.”
handle it.”
“Where have you been?”
“Why not?” Dean threw his arms out, “We finally have a chance to get you back to your normal self. What if the longer the curse is in place it becomes more permanent?”
“Dean,” Sam sighed, his eyebrows falling in pity at his hopeful brother, “Dean, he’s gone.”
“Whoa, easy there, slow down,” Dean grabbed both of his shoulders, the thin material slipping between his fingers before he bit his bottom lip to stave the laughter bubbling in his throat. “Um, Cas, don’t you think you might want to change your clothes first?”
“I don’t think our Netflix has The Lion King, Joey,” Sam mumbled as he scrolled, biting his bottom lip with one hand on his hip.
“Cas, Angel, you have to push,” Dean presses the side of his head against Cas’.
“I—“ Sam began, closing his eyes and shaking his head slowly.
“I know,” she replied sheepishly, looking down at her clasped hands. “I just—“
“Shh,” he leaned his head back and kissed the tip of her nose, “I got you, don’t worry.”
Jack chuckled and leaned over, placing a quick kiss on her forehead before she snuggled back into his chest.
“Sorry little buddy,” he muttered, standing and making sure he was fully tucked back into his underwear before throwing on his robe and making his way to the kitchen.
“No, Dean,” Jack shook his head, “You and Castiel are her parents. Once I’m able to penetrate her mind, I can figure out how it happened.”
Jack sighed, shaking his head, “Actually she’s not, earlier when she showed me the memories of her calling me ‘bubba’ I saw her convincing me to feed her cookies for breakfast before the three of you woke up.”
“Were we…” Cas trailed off, shaking his head in disbelief, “Were we getting a divorce?”
“Joey, I need you to listen very carefully, okay?” Cas took a step forward and squatted directly in front of her as she nodded slowly.
“All of the above?” Dean tried his hardest to give Cas a pitiful smile, “I’m sorry, I know this isn’t what you probably imagined when you asked me—“
Dean tried desperately to take a breath, but found himself instead falling to his knees on the floor and scrambling forward towards the bed, his heart beating so loud in his ears he couldn’t think of anything except CasCasCasCasCas.
“A nephilim?” Sam asked loudly, his eyes widening, “Crap. Is there any way to know what dumbass angel knocked up a human this time?”
“What’s the name, Castiel?” Jack looked at his surrogate father with wife eyes.
“Dean, I love you,” Cas replied with a hushed tone, her head falling back onto Dean’s shoulder. “My grace, something is happening.”
“That’s not true,” Sam spoke softly, “It’s just that…their powers make them a little unpredictable.”
“Exactly what I said,” Cas nodded, looking Dean in the eye. “I vowed long ago to never leave you.”
“Butter.”
Cas noticed Joey squirm slightly and bite the inside of her cheek before shaking her head to the side slowly.
“Hello,” he smiled, holding up a hand in typical Jack fashion.
“Jude,” Dean responded, looking up at Sam with a somber smile. “After the song my mom used to sing me.”
“No!”
“I just,” Cas licked her bottom lip, staring straight into Dean’s eyes. He always made Cas feel safe, no matter what she needed to say and this time was no exception. “I don’t know what to expect.”
“Yeah, she is a Winchester after all,” Dean smiled and hesitantly reached out to rest his palm on her head, and found himself surprised with how soft her hair was.
“Hey, no flying away,” Dean held up a finger with one hand and gripped her hip with the other so she couldn’t move.
“Someone better tell me what’s going on right now,” Dean pointed a finger at the ground and tightened his jaw.
Cas shrugged, her eyebrows raised with a smirk on her face, “I just wanted to remind you of who exactly I am.”
“I guess he does, doesn’t he?” Dean slowly reached down to pet Butter’s head, only to have the kitten turn and nip at his hand. Cas laughed out loud as Dean looked down at the cat with an offended face.
“What is it, what’s wrong?” Dean asked quickly as she backed away from him, one hand moving towards her stomach.
Sam had contacted every single human or witch he knew that was well versed in any kind of magic, and no one knew how to change an angel’s vessel back to the male version. They even had called Jack down from heaven to try and fix it, but this magic had been strong enough that even his powers couldn’t change Cas back. It had been two weeks, and they were all currently on a trip across the country to visit a shaman in Maryland who Sam had spoken to on the phone about their predicament.
“Are you ready?” Cas shot Dean a quick smile.
“But what the hell is she?” Sam shook his head, his jaw still dropped in awe when they heard another loud crash coming from the library. Without a second thought they both ran back down the hall, sighing in frustration when they rushed through the door only to find papers falling in the air from a rush of wind.
“Dean?” Sam asked quietly.
“I mean,” Dean shrugged, “I’m all for this look, but Jack and Sam might want you to at least put some boxers on.”
“I think we should call Jack,” Cas held up a hand when Dean opened his mouth to argue, “And see what he thinks.”
“Oh dear god,” he whispered quickly, blinking rapidly. “Okay, um…there’s a…her head is, uh, it’s coming out, I think.”
“Okay okay,” Dean held his hands up in surrender as he slowly walked over to his brother, “Truce.”
you to stay by me.”
“Dean, you—“
“Yeah,” Dean chuckled, “When we realized you were dying, we did the reversal spell to see if it would help you heal faster or something.”
“Maybe,” Dean sniffed loudly, his eyes looking over the angel’s body, “Maybe Jack can do something? Did he try? Can he try? Sammy, go get Jack, maybe he can—“
time’s Bubba and bring him to you so he can take you back and erase your memories, right?”
“The Jimmy vessel?” Dean shouted, spinning around and walking towards the dresser, “You’re trying to turn him back into a guy?”
“Jack wait!” he called out, then cursed as he turned off the car and tried to run after him.
"Jojo," Dean warned, raising an eyebrow. She snapped her gaze over to him and mimicked his facial expression, tilting her head to the side in a challenging pose. They stared each other down for a moment before Dean finally rolled his eyes and shook his head.
“Away from you,” Cas yelled. Dean rushed up and grabbed her wrist, only to have her instantly yank it from his grasp.
“She let go of our hands and ran ahead of us,” Cas began to explain, “Then she disappeared.”
“I just don’t understand,” Dean groaned and dropped his head into his hands, running his fingers through his hair, “It’s not like you even
“I know that, Cas,” Dean replied, running a hand through his hair, “What are we supposed to do, just give up looking?”
“So, finally Cas is able to breathe, and he’s telling me that Missouri, Jack’s old case worker, called and told him that she had a few kids that needed respite placement. I ask Cas what ‘a few’ meant, and he just ignores the question and tells me that he has this gut feeling that we need to say yes. I know none of you actually know Cas, but when he has these gut feelings, there’s nothing in the world that can change his mind.
These words caused the two of them to once again whip around with confused looks on their faces. Although it was already known, to hear it come out of her mouth was an entirely different story.
Dean decided to use this opportunity to be the dominant one for once and reached under Cas’ ass, scooping her up and giving a tight squeeze to make sure she wasn’t going anywhere. Cas wrapped her legs around Dean’s waist and ground down onto his dick, wiggling her hips in circles as he walked them to the bed. When he felt his shins hit against the bed frame he carefully leaned forward, dropping Cas onto the mattress on her back. Dean reached up and peeled his shirt off as quickly as he could, the neck of the new shirt getting stuck around his ears for a brief moment. By the time the material came over his head and he was able to see again Cas had already yanked her own tank top off, and oh man was Dean happy they decided not to worry about buying Cas a bra yet.
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” Dean cocked his eyebrows, reaching over and realizing that those damn sweatpants did come right off.
“Kiss me if I’m wrong, but dinosaurs still exist, right?”
Jack waited until Dean and Cas had walked down the hallway and up the staircase to lower their invisibility, nodding down at Joey.
“She’s just a baby, she—hey wait,
“Alright alright, let’s go,” Dean rolled his eyes and took a deep breath. He closed his eyes and shook his shoulders briefly to try and loosen his nerves. Just as he opened his mouth, he heard Cas beginning next to him.
“I can’t imagine them not wanting her,” Jack whispered so lowly that Sam almost missed it. When he turned to look at the young man, his face was turned down in a sad manner as he looked at Dean and Cas.
“It’ll be easiest if you all just grab a hold of my arm for this,” Jack held out his hand, “That way I can make sure you all get to the right time.”
“What is it, Sam?” Cas asked, crossing her arms.
“Why do you keep leaving, Joey?” Cas bent over at the waist and tilted his head.
“Hey asshole,” he yelled, firing a few bullets into its back. He knew that silver bullets wouldn’t kill the monster, but they did hurt it. Just as the wendigo turned its attention to Dean, another one came up behind him and reached around to his front, sinking its claws into the flesh of Dean’s abdomen, tearing through his multiple layers with ease.
“Fine, I’ll elaborate a
“You put her in the dungeon?” Jack asked with a shocked tone.
“When she was little, she couldn’t say ‘brother’ correctly,” Jack responded, turning to watch the movie as he let his head fall back onto the chair.
“The pregnancy is going fine,” Cas nodded, her hands reaching down to rest over the small swell of her abdomen, “I’m not experiencing nausea anymore, and the fatigue has subsided greatly.”
Not just any Cas, though. Angry Cas.
, don’t be telling Charlie that! Fine! I’ll tell them. Calm down.
“I love you,” she said quickly through her teeth.
“I just have to talk to Bubba by myself for a minute,” she grabbed one of each of her fathers’ hands and gave a quick squeeze, “I promise, I’ll be right back. Ol zir tol vaoan.”
“Things quickly escalated after that, since I had basically come out in one of the biggest ways possible. I walked around every day just bracing for the aftermath, flinching every time my phone rang. I just
“I know,” Dean nodded, taking one quick glance down at her breasts before hesitantly reaching out and touching the taught skin there.
“Dean,” Sam groaned as he closed the trunk, slinging the bag onto his shoulder.
“Yes Dean,” he nodded slowly, “You said you wanted to explore our relationship further, correct?”
Eight weeks.
Cas jerked backwards, her mouth clamping shut.
“Please,” Cas whined, her hips wiggling on their own accord.
“Yes,” Cas sighed.
“It’s going to be okay.”
“You said that last time and then you did it any way,” he murmured as his fingertips began wiggling against her ribcage, pulling a loud laugh bubbling from her throat.
“Joey, you have to—“ Jack was interrupted as his hands shot off of her head, and Joey’s eyes snapped open.
“It shouldn’t...there’s no possible way—“
“Jesus Christ,” Dean groaned, closing his eyes as he shook his head, “I’m not worried about that right now. He…she…we just need clothes that aren’t going to fall off of him. Her. Damn it!”
“There you go, Cas, you’re doing great,” Sam called from the foot of the bed, nodding.
“Don’t be sorry,” Cas interrupted, reaching up with his spare hand and resting it on Dean’s jawline, “I was just surprised, that’s all.”
“Good-bye, Angel,” Cas whispered before carefully letting her back to the ground.
“And?” Dean said loudly, his eyebrows raised.
“Too late, I already said ‘challenge accepted’,” Dean raised his eyebrows with a cocky smile, sliding the flare gun into his jacket pocket.
“Just make sure none of them run out when I open the door,” Cas looked pointedly at Dean, who shrugged, and then over to Sam, who nodded.
Dean huffed a sharp breath out of his nose, “Well when you put it that way.”
think was happening?”
Dean opened his mouth to argue with her, but felt his lungs seize up the moment he felt movement beneath his palm. His jaw dropped open even further as his eyes dropped down to where his hand laid on top of Cas’ stomach. He froze completely still, only having to wait a second before he felt another wave move under the skin. He forced his mouth to close and swallowed down the tightness in his throat as his other hand lifted to press gently alongside of his other one. He bit his bottom lip and closed his eyes when a swift kick pushed against his hand, fighting the smile that was trying to form on his lips.
Joey shook her head adamantly, “You don’t know that.”
“Bubba no,” she shouted, pushing at his hands as he continued trying to keep her at bay, “Don’t hurt him, he’s
“That’s not what I meant,” she shook her head, “I just want—“
“You’re welcome,” Jack smiled, “Pray if you need me.”
“Okay, she’s almost here, it’s—“
“Oh,” he whispered, swallowing as he nodded a few quick times.
“I need you two to stop arguing for five minutes and pay attention,” Sam entered, one hand in the air defensively and the other holding two tattered old books.
“Oh really?” Cas let out a humorless laugh as he stepped forward, his eyebrows raised, “Have you now?”
“Yes ma’am,” Dean murmured and clambered onto the bed, hurrying to wrap himself around her back, his legs resting on either side of her.
“Shut up.”
“He’s the crazy one,” Sam added with a snort as the kitten in Dean’s hand began squirming and trying to bite his knuckles. “Which one is that, Cas?”
“Fine,” Dean grumbled, pursing his lips, “Find us a place.”
“Now, respite placements are supposed to last a couple days,
“Okay,” Dean exhaled deeply, then turned and clapped his hands, “Alright, let’s do this.”
“Did it work?” she asked quietly.
“Yes,” Cas replied slowly, “But this is about your entire life.”
Joey ignored him and walked over to Jack, grabbing a hold of his shirt to help pull herself up onto his lap. He looked down at her with his eyebrows scrunched together as she wiggled around getting comfortable, finally letting out a long breath and resting her head against his chest. Jack looked up at Sam, who was smiling as he watched the interaction, then over to Dean and Cas who were still leaning against each other on the couch.
“Cas?” he yelled, walking into the narrow hallway that led to the garage. Sam followed close behind, his hand resting on the handle of his gun that was ever present tucked into the back of his jeans.
“At first we were kind of...low key...we didn’t want to start up a relationship in case it went south, since Cas was not only involved with ACE, but related to more than half the staff. It was just...it was just fun, you know? We were obviously living together, but kept our separate rooms and mostly stayed in our own space when we weren’t banging like rabbits against the--heh, I knew that’d get him squeaking again. It’s okay, babe, Charlie can edit that out.
“Dean,” Sam grabbed his brother’s shoulder again, this time forcefully turning him around, “One wendigo is enough to try and handle. There could be two here.”
He was interrupted when Joey suddenly reappeared directly in front of Cas, looking up at him with her arms plastered along her sides.
“I’m not leaving you,” Cas gave him a small smile as she lowered her hand and turned around to walk towards the hall, “Especially not now.”
“Of course not,” Cas hissed, his eyes narrowed as he grabbed onto Dean’s shoulder and forced him to turn around directly in front of Jack and Joey. Dean refused to meet his gaze, looking instead down at the ground.
“Yup,” Joey responded as she buried her face into his neck with a smirk.
“Jesus Cas.”
“Is there anything we can do?” Jack asked quietly, flinching when Dean spun around from where he stood at the sink and shot him a glare.
“I mean…I don’t know, but—no.”
“Well excuse me. I haven’t been on an actual date in,” Dean threw his arms to the side and paused, his eyes darting around as he thought, “Seriously, I can’t even think of the last time.”
“Dude, she’s already seen this place at its worst.”
“Cas,” he whispered, his eyes slamming shut, “I can’t.”
“Okay,” Cas nodded, “Do it.”
“Jesus Christ Cas, it’s not because you’re a girl,” Dean rolled his eyes and threw his arms out to the side, “It’s because you’re fucking pregnant.”
“What?” Sam’s jaw dropped, and he let out a huge rush of air. Dean, on the other hand, had merely cocked an eyebrow and was staring past the angel at nothing in particular.
“She’s not a dragon, Dean,” Sam mumbled.
“Can’t he do this without looking?” Dean asked quietly, and Cas whipped her head around to shoot daggers at him.
“You know you’re wrong, you were there when they died,” Dean mumbled, shaking his head slightly. He peeked one eye open and saw that Cas was staring at him with a pitiful look on his face, so he rolled his eyes and leaned over and gave him a quick peck.
“We’re only here for one night,” Dean sighed, moving to initially drop his bag on the bed, then decided otherwise and walked over to the table instead.
Dean’s mouth dropped open and he let out a huff of breath, his eyes widened.
Dean huffed a sharp breath out of his nose, biting the inside of his cheeks, “I’ve survived worse.”
“Are you going to just stay invisible or hide somewhere?” Joey asked as they walked up the staircase together. When she turned back around, she realized that she couldn’t see Jack anymore, so she nodded, “Invisible, got it.”
, he said.
“You need to sleep, Dean,” Sam reached out and switched the radio completely off, “You were up all night last night.”
“Before I tell you,” Cas straightened his shoulders, holding both of his hands out in a defensive manner, “I have to assure you that I have never lain with a human.”
“Wow,” Dean whispered once he backed away, “What was that for?”
“Oh Joey,” Cas responded quietly.
“Dean,” Cas whispered, sliding his hand around Dean’s waist. “She’ll be with Jack. Plus you need to let everyone else know we found her so they can call off the search. I’m sure Sam and Eileen have driven halfway across Montana by now.”
The second they entered the room, they heard the low growl that was associated with a wendigo. However, they heard it echoing in the small cabin from all angles. Dean rushed forward, letting off several silver bullets into the darkness.
“And that’s my cue,” Sam raised his eyebrows once as he pushed his chair from the table, pulling books into his arms as fast as he could.
“And they’re my dads.”
“I don’t want her to leave,” Jack whispered, biting his bottom lip, “I know that we have to send her back to her time, and that future me will get to be with her, but still…”
“I’m aware, Cas,” Dean whispered, then without moving his eyes away from the television reached over and playfully shoved the angel’s face towards the TV.
He climbed back up to the head of the bed, smirking when he saw Cas’ face. Her eyes were mostly closed, and she had a bright smile on her face. Her short dark hair was messed up, and Dean was wondering if she had been running her own hands through it. He began kissing all over her face, and when he finally reached her mouth she responded eagerly to the taste of herself on his tongue.
,” Sam responded loudly, and Dean watched as his brother’s hands disappeared under the blanket that was laying over Cas’ knees.
“Apparently, y’all wanna know about the kids?
of here,” Dean growled loudly, his hands reaching under Cas’ head as tears began pouring from his eyes. He pulled Cas’ face to his chest, running his fingers through the short dark hair. He felt the stubble poking through his t-shirt and choked out a sob, dropping his head to press against the angel’s cool forehead.
“So do I,” Cas let out a shaky breath, “But we both decided—“
“Cas, babe, wake up,” Dean’s voice began to crack as tears welled in his eyes and he furiously tried to blink them away.
“What’s going on?” Dean scooted to the head of the bed, only slightly surprised that Cas was still asleep next to him.
“Psh, no,” Dean scoffed, chuckling weakly for a moment before looking up and meeting Cas’ eyes. “Okay, yes. What if I’m an awful dad? What if I’m just like my dad, but I’ll be even worse because she’s a nephilim and that means parenting her is going to be way harder and what if—“
As they stood there, chests heaving and eyes boring into each other, a sudden knock on the door brought them back to the current reality.
“I…I need to try and read your mind so we can find out where you’re from,” he paused and lowered his voice, remembering what Sam had said, “We just want to help you.”
“I’m Sam, and that’s Dean,” he gestured with his head to where Dean was now leaning against the wall nonchalantly, shooting a sarcastic two finger salute their way. When Sam looked back, the little girl was nodding gingerly. “Can you tell us your name?”
“I—“ Dean began, then sharply cut off and wrinkled his forehead, “Dude, you’re god.”
interrupted?...Ah yes, I started asking around if there was anyone looking for a roommate, but nothing came of it. So then I made the decision to stay with my mom and Sammy, at least for the time being.
Dean visibly startled and looked down at her, forcing a quick smile onto his face before he responded.
“What isn’t?” Cas tilted his head to the side in his signature way, his eyes narrowed, “Going on dates, or bowling?”
Sam walked into the room, his eyebrows raised as he watched Dean begin to pace back and forth near his bed.
“I can’t,” Dean choked out another sob, a hand drifting to the women’s shirt that Cas’ male vessel was still wearing and gripping it in his fist.
“I know,” Cas responded quietly, trying to lean down to catch Dean’s eye. The angel let out a long breath before slowly reaching out and lifting Dean’s chin with his thumb. “Dean.”
“Sam,” Jack reached up and wrapped his hand around Sam’s wrist, looking at him with a soft smile, “I have control of the situation. Nothing bad will happen.”
“She’s still in the bunker,” Jack closed his eyes and nodded, “I can sense her.”
“I’ll admit it, when I first met Cas, I was smitten pretty much immediately. I mean, it’s hard not to fall in love when he’s looking at you with those crazy-blue eyes, and giving you that sideways grin, and--oh look, he’s doing it now! Ha, now I’ve made him blush. That’s what you get, Sunshine!
“Seriously, Dean. Hell. You,” Cas hissed before turning back to Sam, “I’ve witnessed enough births over the years that I should be able to handle it myself, but in the off chance something happens to me I need someone down there to get the baby.”
“Yes.”
“Can Bubba just read my mind?” she sniffled again, pouting her bottom lip out as Dean reached out and rubbed the top of her back, “Please?”
“Cas,” Dean felt the whine that escaped his throat and he tried to stop it, to make his voice sound more manly but if the chuckle from his brother was any hint, it didn’t work, “You know I’m allergic to cats.”
“I say that my mom saved us, but like seriously, Claire would not have made it out of that first year if we didn’t have Mom. Of course we ultimately got the hang of it, but man, being a parent is
“Can it be my turn now?” Jack asked excitedly, walking towards Dean with his arms outstretched.
“Okay, um, you can, uh, keep going,” Dean stuttered, waving a hand towards the angel.
“No, it’s flying,” Dean held up a finger, “I know the sound of wings.”
“Ah,” Jack instantly covered his eyes with his hands but remained in the same spot, “I’m sorry!”
“Love you, Bubba,” she said quietly before moving forward and giving him a long, strong hug. Past Jack squeezed her back before slowly standing and looking at his future self, nodding.
Dean woke up angry. Well, not angry, frustrated.
Sam and Jack both turned to look at each other, their eyes wide. Sam nodded and took a deep breath, then gestured with his head towards the door.
“To wash the impala,” he shouted over his shoulder as he walked down the steps into the war room, “Or do I need adult supervision?”
Sam nodded slowly and turned his head to look through the doorway. The little girl was still pulled into a tight ball, but had stopped rocking for the moment. Her head tilted up just enough for Sam to see her eyes flashing a bright silver light before dulling to a humanly bright blue.
damn it. I told you. I told you not to do this. I can’t…I can’t do this without you.”
“Bubba?” Dean furrowed his brow in confusion, the name causing him to not realize that he and Cas were still in the same compromising position even though Joey had left.
“Well? What did they—we—what happened?” he shook his head.
“I said I’ll try,” Cas corrected, letting out a sharp breath, “I don’t think it’s going to work for multiple reasons.”
“How do I start?” Cas walked over and stood just a little too close to Dean’s back, his head peeked over his shoulder as he watched Dean slide his fingers into the holes of the bowling ball and pick it up.
it,” he yelled, turning and throwing his fists to the sky, “And yeah, Jack, I’m talking to you!”
Dean hated being nervous.
“Go ahead,” Dean gestured with his arms for Cas to continue as he scooted under the blankets and fluffed his pillow.
“Uh, Dean?” Sam raised his eyebrows, “That’s probably not the best plan.”
When he entered the room, he saw Cas standing at the stove and tried to hold back a moan. The angel was wearing a tight t-shirt that accentuated his biceps every time his arms moved to stir whatever he was cooking, and his sweatpants were hanging low on his hips and if Dean just gave one good yank they would—
Joey nodded, her bright blue eyes moving between all of the men standing in front of her.
Cas shrugged, “If we do it in the future, I don’t see a reason we couldn’t do it now.”
,” Cas tried to sit up for the third time in the last thirty seconds, only to be stopped when Dean’s hands pushed down on her shoulders, keeping her in the same position.
“They called it that because all of the owners are related, and they all have the names of angels. Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, some poor sap even got stuck with Lucifer…yeah yeah, I know, I’ll be nice.
“Well yeah, of course, but—“
All four of the men looked over to the little girl who was now standing in the middle of the dungeon, her arms wrapped around herself.
“Wait Jack,” Sam put a hand on the young man’s chest, then looked over to Dean, “Are we sure this is a good idea? We’re about to bring two very powerful beings together.”
“What song is it, Jojo?”
“I can think of a hundred reasons,” Dean leaned over and hissed, his jaw clenched tightly.
The hunter cleared his throat and took a deep breath before nodding and moving forward, his eyes never leaving the small bundle in Cas’ arms.
“Is that…” he trailed off, tilting his head further towards the door to try and hear better. Dean raised his eyebrows and shrugged, trying to decipher what his brother was talking about. The elder Winchester took a few careful steps towards the kitchen, craning his neck and closing his eyes. He straightened his spine suddenly, and matched Sam’s look of confusion.
“You…” Cas trailed off, shaking his head in disbelief, “You had lost a third of your blood volume when I got there, Dean. Tell me, how exactly could you have handled that?”
,” Cas narrowed her eyes, “I would’ve told you that Sam and I looked into the history of nephilim, and found out that there were two previous angels that gave birth in a female vessel, and because they weren’t human, they didn’t perish during the birth.”
“Listen, I’m gonna go on the record right now and say that the only reason I’m doing this is because my husband is forcing me to, and if he wasn’t standing right here I would be—”
“Okay well maybe don’t start with ‘I’m gonna read your mind’,” Dean sarcastically fake whispered from where he had popped up behind Cas.
“What? Wait, right now, like right
“What the hell,” Dean breathed out, his head whipping over to look at Sam.
Sam furrowed his brow before nodding and sliding out of the booth, pushing the people back to clear a path to the door.
“I don’t know of any creatures that resemble a child that have wings, Sam,” Cas sighed loudly, “I need to see her.”
“Oh, do you now?” Dean cocked an eyebrow and tilted his head.
“No, those noises you were making were too hot,” he chuckled, bending down to nuzzle the side of Cas’ neck with his nose, “I wouldn’t last.”
“Okay,” Dean turned off his phone and threw it towards the foot of the bed, “Let’s do this.”
Joey narrowed her eyes as she looked at him, then sighed and pulled her hands away from him, crossing her arms.
“The child,” Cas began quietly, “She’s not an angel.”
“So Joey,” Sam smiled down at her as he walked over to the table and sat across from her, “You know who we all are?”
“Remember why she’s here, Dean,” Jack spoke softly, looking pointedly down at the child gripping onto him.
“We’ve done as much research as we can,” Jack spoke up softly, walking towards the brothers with a small smile, “There’s no reason to believe that Castiel won’t be able to handle this.”
“Yeah yeah, you’re her grace daddy, whatever,” Dean shrugged and waved him off before scratching the last of the angel markings. He turned back to Cas and clapped his hands with a smile. “Okay, how do you feel? Juiced up?”
Joey nodded enthusiastically, scrambling out of his arms and running towards the stairs with her brother close behind. Just as she set one foot onto the bottom step, she stopped and turned around.
“No, I do,” Dean nodded, looking down at the hand on the angel’s chest, “There’s been too many times that I didn’t say it, and this is definitely a time when it needs to be said.”
everyone liked it so much when it had lyrics like ‘
“I’m not gonna,” she whined, trying to wiggle out of his grasp only to have him pull her closer and stuff his face into her neck. She giggled as the stubble along his chin tickled her, shaking her head quickly and pushing against his chest.
“Roughly,” Sam shrugged, “Who knows, she might be different.”
“Joey, okay,” Sam chuckled softly, “That’s a pretty name.”
apocalypse?”
“I just don’t know what to do,” Dean mumbled, “It’s not like we can call the cops and tell them that our half human half angel child flew away and we can’t find her.”
“I know,” Sam whispered, letting out a long breath.
“We have to go. Now,” he said quietly, trying to ignore the crowd of people forming near them from his apparent medical event.
Dean choked out a quick sob before pulling her head back to his shoulder and closing his eyes. Cas leaned forward and placed his forehead against Dean’s, holding the back of his neck as they cried tears of relief together.
“Listen, Cas—“
“Maybe we got lucky and it got out,” Dean mumbled as he followed his brother into the hallway, first grabbing his pistol and sliding it back into the back of his pants.
Jack went up to their door and knocked five times, only waiting a few seconds before holding his hand above the handle and using his powers to unlock it. He ignored Sam calling after him and opened the door, his eyes scanning the room.
“What’s that?” Cas breathed out, her head falling back onto the mattress as Dean blew a small rush of air onto her clit.
“It’s okay,” she mumbled, biting her bottom lip, “I know I can’t stay here forever.”
The main issue that caused the disagreements, however, was not directly related to the sexual organs of a certain angel. If they were being honest with themselves, it allowed them to try some new things in the bedroom that their previous beings wouldn’t have been able to perform.
“Well, maybe you should use your words next time,” Cas pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows.
“I know, we’re taking things slow,” Dean held up a hand and pulled his lips between his teeth, “And I’m totally on board, I swear.”
“Yeah?” he replied, his eyes looking anywhere in the room but Cas as he lifted his beer bottle to his lips and took a long drink.
“Cas,” he breathed out, rushing forward and shaking his shoulders.
“Shut it,” Dean grunted, pointing a finger at Jack.
“He’s not here.”
“Sentences, Cas,” Dean groaned.
Dean took a deep breath before shaking his head roughly and turning around, storming in the opposite direction.
“Should we go with him?” Jack asked worriedly as Dean slowly walked forward, his face as pale as the walls.
The angel rolled his eyes and sighed, “The reason I wanted us to abstain from sex was because of Sam.”
“Ha! Just kidding.
“Take her to your room,” Sam placed a hand on Jack’s shoulder and looked straight into his eyes, “Don’t come out until I come and get you.”
“I was able to get her to calm down,” Sam replied, shrugging slightly, “Then I gave her some water to drink.”
“Dean,” Cas groaned as another contraction began ripping through her body, “If I…ugh—“
“Could’ve been an act,” Dean muttered. He sighed dramatically and set his hands on his hips, shrugging his shoulders. “Dude we could look all day, this place is too big. If it is still here, it’ll probably fly away as soon as we find it again.”
“What was that?” Sam asked quietly from across the room.
,” Dean nodded, crossing his arms as he glared down at her.
“Yeah,” Sam sighed, then gave one last disgusted look at the bed before shaking his head and walking towards his brother, “Based on the local legends and recent missing persons cases, it sounds like the Wendigo is in the woods just down the road from here.”
“So what’s your name idea?” Dean turned back to Cas.
“Hey,” Dean yelled, and Joey just squeezed his waist tighter at the raise in volume.
Cas shrugged slightly, “Because I only healed the life threatening injuries.”
“You promise?” she looked past Sam at Dean, her brows turned down and her eyes shining with the hint of tears forming. Sam sighed and turned around slowly, gesturing with his head to the little girl when Dean shrugged at him, shaking his head. Sam dropped his shoulders dramatically before tilting his head and tightening his lips together, giving his brother one of his signature bitch faces.
“But Dean,” Cas whispered, his voice beginning to waver.
that got me into this mess?”
“Are you still upset with me?” Cas tilted her head to the side, this time with a much more playful tone as she looked up at him through her long eyelashes.
“That’s not what this is about, I just—“
“They’re cute as shit,” Sam chuckled as they all walked down the hall, Cas pulling Dean along behind him.
“Jojo,” Dean said quietly, walking towards Cas and rubbing her back, “Jack showed us what happened.”
it?” Dean hissed as he turned back and wrung out the towel he was wetting.
"Wait, they weren't already together?"
“Joey,” she replied so quietly into her folded arms that only Sam could hear.
“No, Sam,” Dean huffed out a breath before pushing himself to a standing position, pointing down at Cas’ body, “I’m serious, something’s happening.”
“Don’t,” Dean hissed quietly, his head jerking to the side as he glared at his brother. Sam ignored the request and instead took another step forward, bending down and wrapping his other arm around the front of Dean’s chest.
“Um, yeah,” Dean cleared his throat, trying not to look into Cas’ excited blue eyes as he spoke, “Listen, uh…”
“You’re going to have to watch your language now,” Sam chastised from where he was standing a few feet away, his arms crossed.
“She’s kidding,” Sam whispered as Dean and Cas continued to talk to Joey.
Dean’s nose scrunched up in confusion and he took a step back, his eyebrows raised, “I’m sorry, what?”
“A woman,” Cas whispered.
“They seem to be lasting a lot longer too,” Dean nodded as Cas continued breathing through the pain.
“And we obviously might not agree on this name either,” Cas chuckled, shaking his head, “Because I am still not letting you name our daughter after a kind of pie—“
...shush.
Cas held up a finger, “Yes I do. Joanna, because we share grace you are able to read my emotions much easier than reading anyone else’s. Am I lying?”
While they were getting ready for bed that same evening, changing into their usual nighttime attire of boxer briefs and a t shirt, Cas walked up behind Dean and gently wrapped his arms around his waist, tilting his head so his cheek could lie along the top of his back.
“Then what is it?” Cas asked, hands on her hips.
on our side. We’re not worried about one of us getting hurt beyond repair, Jojo. We’re just humans. Well, except Cas, but—never mind, the point is that you’re our daughter, and we don’t want anything bad to ever happen to you.”
“I understand,” Cas responded quietly before turning and walking quickly towards the door.
“What’s the middle name?” Jack asked curiously, tilting his head to the side.
Cas tilted his head to the side, “Looking for the child.”
“I knew that liar liked cats.”
“Are you sure?” Cas bit her lip to hold back a moan as Dean began sucking at the spot just below her ear.
“Because, Dean,” Cas spun around and glared up at him, pointing to her stomach, “
“Since Castiel is my father,” he looked down at the floor sheepishly for a moment before turning his head and peeking up at Sam with one eye, “Doesn’t that mean she’s my little sister?”
“Um, Joey?” Cas stepped forward, wincing when he heard the sound of the cereal crunching under his shoes, “What happened?”
They did it. They finally did it.
“Go,” Sam whispered, gently pushing the young man’s shoulders towards the open doorway. Once Jack and the baby were out of the room, Sam turned back to his brother.
“Dean, it’s two in the morning, I don’t want to talk,” Cas groaned, rolling over to her other side.
“Wait, what did he say?...I can see you two laughing in there...Charlie...Oh Jesus, I did
“Okay,” Dean stood up, feeling his anger inching back to the surface, his jaw clenched tightly between his words, “But you and I both know that this is not a normal baby. It’s a
“But this isn’t the ‘you’ I fell in love with, damn it!” Dean spun around and yelled.
It was Cas’ turn to roll her eyes as she reached up and swatted Dean’s finger away from her nose, “Stop acting like a stereotypical baby daddy.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“It’s true,” the angel agreed.
Dean took a deep breath before letting it out slowly, closing his eyes. He took a small step back before reopening his eyes and looking at the young man, “She’s okay?”
“Joey,” Cas whispered, pressing his lips tightly together.
It was February seventeenth that Cas walked into the library, her fists clenched at her sides. Sam and Dean were sitting at the table surrounded by various books, and the former was the first to notice her.
“What look?” Dean replied, letting his bottom lip pout out just enough to make his face look pathetic.
“Yes,” Past Jack nodded once, “If it’s possible, when you erase my memories, can you plant one of me coming down to check on them? That will explain why I’m here.”
“Come on,” Dean finally spoke, jerking his head in the direction of the stairs. Cas nodded and they walked together down the steps. When they turned the corner for the dungeon, Dean furrowed his brow when he saw Sam walking out of the room, closing the door behind him.
“What the hell is your problem?” Dean took the opportunity to push himself into a sitting position, biting back a groan when a strong stabbing pain ripped through his chest.
“I don’t know,” Sam yelled back, throwing his hands up before looking down at the still terrified little girl.
“She’s, she’s fine,” Dean responded immediately, a small smile on his face, “I think she’s with Jack.”
Cas slowly stood up, then looked down at Joey with his eyebrows raised in question. She nodded enthusiastically, and Cas sighed.
Dean, as always, dropped his head into his hands and ran his fingers through his hair. He shook his head and groaned before turning just enough to look up at the angel with an exasperated sigh.
Sam stood up slowly and groaned, turning to give his brother yet another bitch face. Dean shrugged and mouthed ‘what’ before rolling his eyes.
“Waking up is hard,” Dean shot him a playful glare before he turned and wrapped his arms around Joey’s waist, giving her a tight squeeze, “Right Jojo?”
“This isn’t creepy as hell,” Dean mumbled as they both pulled out their guns and carefully walked up the porch steps to the front door. Sam reached forward and tapped Dean’s arm with the barrel of his gun, gathering his attention. When Dean looked back, Sam pointed to the floor directly in front of the door where there was streaks of blood with what looked like claw marks dug into the wood.
Dean inhaled deeply and closed his eyes, allowing a small smile to grace his face. He turned in Cas’ arms and reached up to place his hands on the angel’s cheeks, rubbing his thumb along the stubble there.
“You, out,” Dean turned and pointed a finger at his brother.
“Seriously Cas? Now?” Dean yelled, his eyebrows raised, “She is
Dean first grabbed Cas’ hands and placed one under her thigh to help hold her up, the other around her waist. The hunter then began rubbing soothingly along her upper back, leaning forward to whisper in her ear.
“Oh yeah, that’s not creepy at all,” Dean mumbled, his gun still outstretched as they listened to the random banging now coming from all over the bunker.
“Sounds great,” she squatted back down below the desk, and Dean turned to look at his brother. Sam had his arms crossed and his eyebrows raised, his lips pressed tightly together. Dean gave him a sarcastic double thumbs up, then turned back to the desk. Just as he leaned forward to make sure the woman was still there, she popped back up with a large keychain, making him fall backwards a few steps.
“Wait,” Sam interjected, holding up a finger, “I remember reading once that normal nephilim age roughly one year per human month.”
, Cas, that was funny!...Yes it was...Fine. Killjoy.
“Listen, Joey,” Sam spoke up softly, sliding his hands into his pockets as he bent over slightly to try and catch her gaze, “I know you think that you did something wrong, but that’s not true.”
“Almost,” Past Jack held up a finger before bending over at the waist in front of Joey, who was sniffling back tears.
“I’m working on something, Dean,” Cas scoffed, shaking his head. “I’ll be done soon.”
“I don’t know,” Jack muttered, “I kind of agree with Dean, I don’t think us mentioning them—you, potentially splitting up is going to convince her to go back.”
“You can make it,” Cas responded calmly, “Only twenty-eight more days to go.”
“You’re afraid.”
The nephilim’s face instantly froze as he thought back to the images Sam had shown him on his laptop.
“Dean,” she walked closer and pressed her body against his back lightly, her voice such a low tone that Dean could feel it in her chest echoing into his back. Cas grabbed his shoulders and forced him to turn to face her, grabbing his beer bottle and setting it loudly onto the table. She looked up at him and licked her bottom lip before pulling it between her teeth, her pupils blown with lust. He swallowed loudly, his hands clenched into fists at his side as he forced himself not to reach out and touch her.
“Fine,” Dean huffed, crossing his arms, “But then how the hell are we going to do this?”
“Yup, just do it, get it over with,” Dean responded, closing his eyes and flinching in an attempt to brace himself for Jack’s powers.
Dean moaned deeply and closed his eyes, shaking his head before turning to make eye contact again.
“Where are you going?” Dean called after him, making the angel stop in his tracks.
“Jesus,” Dean mumbled, dropping back against the headboard with a loud thud, “You moron, it’s not first sight.”
Dean dropped his shoulders and rolled his eyes, then walked over to the door and pulled it open.
“You know I, uh…I love you,” Dean clenched his jaw as he leaned into her touch.
Cas then went back to his computer screen, biting the inside of his cheek to stop from smiling when he saw Dean’s exasperated look out of the corner of his eye.
“You know what my point is, Cas,” Dean narrowed his eyes, “Nephilim are dangerous.”
Dean swallowed loudly as Cas pulled away, and when he turned to look at the angel and lock eyes with those bright blue orbs, he chuckled softly.
“Please no,” Jack whispered, slamming his eyes shut as he was yanked into the room. The bed was turned sideways, so Sam couldn’t immediately see anything when he walked in. Dean walked over to the head of the bed, one hand hesitantly reaching out to run over Castiel’s hair. She instantly slapped his hand away, shooting a glare up and making him shove his hands into his pockets sheepishly.
“But she’s obviously upset about going back,” Dean hissed, throwing an arm in her direction.
“Bubba,” she spoke quietly once they were in the hallway, pointing down the opposite way. Jack turned and looked, automatically moving in front of her when he saw the shadows against the corner of the wall getting bigger.
“I guess we know who she listens to better in the future,” Sam leaned over and whispered to Jack, trying to hold back his laughter as Dean continued glaring at the back of the the little girl’s head.
“Purgatory,” Cas stated simply.
“She was showing me a memory,” Jack smiled fondly, one hand coming up to rub gently along Joey’s back.
“Seriously?” Sam shouted as he spun around, glaring at Dean for a few seconds before he narrowed his eyes and bent over to form his own snowball. Dean smiled widely before scrambling over to a nearby tree, hiding behind it as a snowball flew directly by his head.
The angel rolled his eyes and shook his head before holding a hand out and smiling, “Come on, let’s go meet our daughter.”
“Fine. But I’d like it on the record that I am being
When he wiggled his shoulders and tried to sit up, Cas’ hand shot out and slapped onto his chest, holding him down.
“Cas, we have to talk about this,” he said quietly, his eyes subconsciously flicking down to her stomach.
“Okay.”
Joey frowned and pouted her bottom lip out, leaning back in the chair, “I like future Bubba better. He lets me do whatever I want.”
“Here,” Cas carefully maneuvered her tiny body so he could shift her into Dean’s arms, a grin on his face the entire time.
?…I thought they wanted to know about my past, not—Okay, okay, I get it. I just didn’t know people were that interested in it…Cas, you okay with this?…You know they’re gonna hate us for this someday, right?…Okay, just checking.
Once Jack and Dean were walking down a random hallway alone, Jack began clearing his throat every few seconds. Dean ignored it at first, but finally stopped in his tracks and spun around, putting an open palm on Jack’s chest.
Not really, of course. He loved his stupid baby brother. But when the mop headed Sasquatch introduced Cas to cheesy pick up lines, Dean wanted nothing more than to strangle him. It started out pretty harmless, with Cas using simple ones that were more cute than they were cheesy.
me?” Sam heard Castiel shout between her groans of pain.
The laughter that Sam had been holding back was now being released loudly as he bent over, one hand on Jack’s shoulder. Dean slowly straightened up and turned to glare at his brother. Jack was chuckling softly, nodding his head.
“Yes, Cas,” Dean rolled his eyes, “Are you almost done?”
“What?” Dean’s eyes snapped down, and he looked where Sam was pointing before letting out a long breath.
“I will
Cas let out an exasperated sigh, “Are you not responsible for the offspring? Would you prefer fetus father?”
“Really?” Cas’ head snapped up suddenly, his eyes wide.
It was that month later, and Sam and Dean were tidying up the bunker, preparing for her arrival. Well, Sam was cleaning. Dean was sitting at the library table, his feet propped up on the surface with his fingers linked behind his head while he watched Sam fuss over sweeping the floor.
“Jack, she’s hurtin—“
“What?” Cas leaned back slightly to look back and forth between the cat and Dean.
“Hi,” he whispered after a few silent moments. The little girl barely peeked the top of one eye out from her arms, looking directly at Sam. He gave her a small smile, and wiggled onto his butt, crossing his legs to try and seem less intimidating.
“Is she beautiful?”
“Cas, you literally share a bed with me every night,” Dean dragged a hand down his face, ignoring the snorts and giggles coming out of Sam from the lounge chair across the room.
“What should I say to her?”
“Dean I told you I’m
you is handling this. You’ve only known her a day, the future Dean has known her her
“Damn it you’re right, they are cute,” Dean chuckled and reached out to pet the completely black one currently rubbing under Cas’ neck. It turned towards him and opened its bright blue eyes, and Dean laughed.
“New plan,” Dean nodded as he walked towards the wall with a pocket knife, starting on breaking the regular angel sigils that they had added.
“Let’s go,” Cas replied, leaning forward and placing his lips against Dean’s. They stayed there for a few seconds, and when Jack automatically looked away from the display of affection, he muffled a laugh with his hand when he glanced down and saw Joey making a disgusted face.
“Cas,” Dean closed his eyes, “You are in active labor, I don’t think you need chicken and—“
“We’re just trying to help, Dean,” Sam responded, resting his hands on his hips.
“I’m just so happy,” Past Jack inhaled deeply, pausing before continuing, “I’m just so happy that he’s going to be happy. He deserves that.”
“That’s not all,” Cas tightened his lips together and began shaking his head slightly, looking at the ground.
husband has just informed me that I’m not allowed to talk about masturbation on here, so I guess I apologize...it’s your own fault, dude. You put the thought into my head.
“I don’t know,” Jack shrugged, furrowing his brow, “I’m telling you, there’s no way she could be lying.”
“After everything we’ve been through,” Cas let out a long breath, his eyes still boring into Dean’s, “You still treat me like I’m disposable.”
“Uh,” Dean swallowed loudly, his eyes looking back and forth between Cas and the sleeping infant.
“I agree,” Sam nodded, placing his hands on his hips and looking at his brother with his brow raised, waiting for an argument.
“Yes,” Cas responded, his face hardened as he stared at Sam.
?” Dean asked loudly, his head poking to the side of Cas’ as he looked at his brother with wide eyes.
“Cas wants me to tell you all the full story of that day, because he’s so proud of what he said to me, and yes, my love, it was perfect...no, I don’t need you to remind me, I know it by heart...yes—Castiel, I could never forget that...will you just shush and let me finish? Heh. That’s what he said. Ow!”
Just as Dean tried to rush forward to grab onto her, Jack and Cas disappeared.
“There’s a new nephilim,” Jack spoke, his hands still covering his eyes, “Did Cas not hear the angel radio?”
“What the hell are you—“
That night, the three of them were all watching a movie when Dean let out a big yawn, stretching his arms above his head. Cas leaned over on the couch and looked up at Dean with his big doe eyes, his eyebrows raised in question.
“What are you talking about?” Dean leaned forward, his face directly next to Cas’, “If something happens to you?”
“Oh come on, Cas, let me have a
Dean shook his head, “But mine is different, my parents actually
“What’s wrong?” Sam raised his eyebrows.
“What, what is it?” Dean asked, rubbing his hands on her shoulders, “Is something wrong?”
“Don’t even think about it.”
“I don’t understand,” Cas shook his head and turned to Jack, “How are Dean and I her parents?”
“It’s true,” Joey shouted, her hands balled into fists at her sides.
planning a divorce, and Joey gets upset again?”
“You both remember I have no gender on a normal basis, correct?” Cas called from over the top of the dressing room door.
remind you, Dean Winchester, that I pulled you out of hell,” she hissed, her nose barely an inch from the end of his, “And just because I am currently carrying your child does not mean I won’t throw you right back in.”
Dean nodded and gave her one last lingering kiss before slowly moving down her body, his hands continuing to run up and down her sides lightly. He kissed his way down her stomach, rubbing the stubble of his chin against the delicate skin and forcing another moan out of Cas. Once he reached the waistband of her shorts, he stopped and looked up her body in a silent ask for permission.
“Okay Cas, I’m ready whenever you are,” Sam nodded as he pulled the desk chair towards the end of the bed, his worried eyes trying desperately to avoid looking towards the crowning infant.
The next morning, Dean walked into the kitchen after getting dressed to see Sam and Cas making breakfast. His brother nudged the angel, and when Cas turned around he lifted his eyebrows quickly as he looked Dean up and down.
Dean looked out at the rolling hills, the many kinds of trees all covered in a soft white blanket of snow. The precipitation had finally stopped, and the sun was even trying to peek out through a few gray clouds.
“You know I love you, but,” Dean forced a smile, “Sunshine, we can’t keep them.”
“We were, uh,” Dean chuckled, “Busy.”
“I said
moment hanging right next to it.
See Charlie, he can’t resist it when I bat these long eyelashes...yeah, yeah, shut up, you’re just jealous.
Dean, Cas, and Sam all watched as the interaction took place. At first, it was complete silence without no movement. After a few seconds, the two nephilim both snapped their eyes open, Jack’s glowing gold and Joey’s a bright silver. Their heads were tilted back slightly, their gaze up at the ceiling. After a few moments, Joey began to whimper and close her eyes.
“I’m not changing back until I have the baby, Dean,” Cas raised her eyebrows and spoke slowly as if Dean should have already known what she was about to say.
“Let’s do this.”
“You don’t know that,” Dean sniffed, biting the inside of his cheeks, “Jack’s been trying to find her for hours, what if she accidentally went to another world, Cas, what if she’s in apocalypse world?”
“We just climbed up the hill, now you want to go back down the hill?” Dean moaned.
“That would explain her appearance,” Cas nodded, “She does look like she’s roughly eight years old.”
“Cas, of course, being the big-hearted dodo that he is, says we should adopt them. As in:
that ACE was going to drop me, that my sales would plummet, that every friend I had made in the previous four years would abandon me.
“Sam!”
Just as Joey looked up at her brother, she realized he was looking through the large opening to the library. She slowly turned her head and held her breath when she saw her fathers stood frozen on their feet, their mouths agape and their chests heaving.
“I know,” Dean nodded, dropping his hand and straightening up to throw a casual arm over Cas’ shoulders, “But see? We’re fine. Now let’s go watch that movie.”
“So if you weren’t pregnant, would you be leaving?” Dean furrowed his brow and walked slowly towards her.
“I know that you’re worried about her right now, Dean,” Cas reached out and placed a gentle hand on Dean’s shoulder, “But think about how
“Sorry,” Dean cleared his throat, “You just looked really cute and I couldn’t—“
“Where could she have gone?” Cas asked, an obvious worried tone in his voice. Just as they all moved towards the hallway to look for her, Joey appeared in the doorway with a gummy smile.
“Yeah, sure,” he smiled and reached out, taking Cas’ hand and guiding his fingers. Dean tried to ignore the heat that was radiating from their touch, swallowing as he helped Cas.
“Is it your shirt? Please say it’s your shirt.”
“Jack is god now, Dean,” Cas replied sarcastically, looking down at the back of Dean’s feet as he moved in front of him. “Besides, you know the usual nephilim warding didn’t work on him because of him being the offspring of an archangel.”
When they reached the bottom of the hill, they discovered that Sam’s original thought was correct and there was indeed a small abandoned house. It looked like no one had touched it in years, between the broken glass and the moss growing along the outside walls.
“I know that, Cas, but—“
“It’s fine,” Dean shrugged, waving a hand at Sam as he slid out of the car. Because it was January in Michigan, there was several feet of snow on the ground and even more falling. Dean pulled the collar of his jacket up around his neck and shivered when a cold breeze made its way down the back of his neck.
Dean froze when he heard that word come out of her mouth, his hands immediately pulling away as he sat up, clearing his throat. Joey let out a few more giggles before sighing and looking up at him with a small smile.
“Jack, take her,” Sam hissed, his jaw clenched.
Dean muttered a thanks and turned around, shuffling towards the main room of the bunker. As he approached the doorway, he slowed his pace and peeked his head in first to look for his angel.
Sam didn’t respond, instead watched as Dean’s rough facade crumbled yet again once he realized that Sam was right. Dean closed his eyes and turned to face the bed, opening them and letting out a shaky breath before kneeling down and running a hand through Cas’ hair. He brought the other hand up and rested it along his cheek, his thumb rubbing his cheek.
“What movie are we watching, Joey?” Jack asked as they all walked together into the ‘Dean cave’.
“Cas I was
“No time for—“ Dean choked out, shaking his head before chasing after her, “What do you mean no time for chicken? What does that mean?!”
“For being so goddamn adorable,” Dean replied quietly, then pulled on Cas’ neck to give him a real kiss. Just as their lips met Dean felt a tiny presence on his lap, and when he looked down he was surprised to see Butter carefully walking on his leg, his head tilted to the side.
“It’s called, ‘Family Don’t End in Blood’.”
“Fine,” Cas turned on her heels and marched towards the back hallway, “I’m going to pack.”
“Looks like she wakes up as easily as you do,” Sam scoffed.
“You’re doing great,” Dean whispered, resting his forehead against the back of her scalp, kissing her neck gently.
"Let's go, Bubba," Joey smirked and grabbed Jack's hand, pulling him with her to the hallway as Dean glared after her.
“Nope,” Dean shook his head, “We’re all in this together. Plus if the baby is born and her powers are really strong, we could need to you help us reel her in.”
about, she’ll go along with it.”
“Sammy,” Dean whimpered, looking down at Cas’ still face as he slowly shook his head side to side, “Damn it, Cas. God
Dean’s head snapped back to stare at Cas, “What?”
Fuck witches.
“Dark hair, and blue eyes,” Cas responded, shaking his head, “I couldn’t get any more information.”
The young man shrugged, “The only reason I grew so fast was because I wasn’t in a safe place. She must know already that she’s being cared for, so she doesn’t need to grow up yet.”
“You know none of that shit counts,” Dean waved him off and turned to face the wall, his hand reaching up and rubbing the back of his neck.
“I figured I’d give you a start,” Cas smiled, tilting his chin down to look up at Dean through his eyelashes.
to erase my memories, but the truth is we’ll never really know.”
“Alright. Back to the story.
“I think we need to call Jack,” Cas looked at Sam, then stole a quick glance at the little girl, “Can you stay here with her?”
“Jack,” Sam wrapped an arm around his shoulders, “Do you remember when I showed you how a baby is born?”
Dean cleared his throat before trying to respond, his voice meek and squeaky, “No, but—“
“Umm, where did I leave off…oh yeah. So we moved to Seattle, ACE even set us up in a fancy downtown apartment originally…but I was almost nineteen, and thought I knew everything about everything, so I wanted my own space, away from my mom and kid brother.
“I just meant,” Dean paused, clearing his throat, “It made me…I don’t know, I guess I felt…come on, man, you know I’m bad at shit like this.”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, then without another thought leaned forward and kissed the tip of Cas’ nose. The angel froze, his eyes crossing as he looked at the spot where Dean’s lips had just been.
“Fine, what if we take down most of the nephilim warding?” Dean turned and shrugged, looking at Jack.
Jack took a deep breath and closed his eyes before pressing gently onto her temples. His head jerked backwards initially and his eyes lit up with their familiar golden glow as his brow furrowed.
“I can’t blame her,” Dean muttered, earning him a hard look from Cas and Sam. “What? I…listen, Sammy, I never told you this but right before Mom died she and Dad got into a big fight. He was going to leave. I ended up hiding under my bed for a few hours because I was so scared that they were going to split up. Mom almost had to call the cops because she couldn’t find me.”
Sam nodded in agreement and before Dean could finish his sentence, the familiar sound occurred directly behind them. They both spun around and simultaneously dropped their jaws when they saw a little girl standing in their hallway. She was glancing up and down the hallway rapidly before her eyes landed on Sam and Dean, and she inhaled sharply before disappearing again.
“Okay sissy,” Jack smiled, leaning up and placing a quick kiss on her forehead.
“But Sam—“
“But Cas said—“
“Dean,” Cas’ voice was so high-pitched that Dean almost didn’t recognize it. He turned around and saw the angel rushing towards him with a giant smile on his face. “Did you hear?”
Joey visibly calmed down the moment they began singing, her muscles in her legs calming down and her face relaxing.
“Well,” Dean scoffed with a smile, “I can honestly say I don’t know. But it seems to be common knowledge that it feels better than anal.”
“Joanna,” Cas replied, smiling when Dean’s gaze snapped up to meet his.
“You have your guard down, Cas.”
“Well,” the angel turned his head down and looked at the floor, “I did manage to see one thing.”
“Nope,” Dean shook his head adamantly, pointing again to the door, “I cannot do this with you in here. Hell, I might not be able to do this with you
“I was trying to find your tv,” she shrugged and looked at the ground, running the tip of her shoe along the ground shyly.
“Uh, what do you need?” Sam walked forward, making sure he stayed to the side of the door where he couldn’t look inside.
————————————————
"Shut up," Dean muttered, punching the back of his brother's shoulder before joining him in the hallway.
“There he is,” Cas deadpanned from behind him.
“Help us to understand, baby,” Dean whispered, coughing when he realized how easily the affectionate name slipped out of his mouth.
Finally Sam cleared his throat and turned in his seat to look at Cas, “How are you feeling?”
“What’s so funny, squirt?” he poked her knee.
“Oh,” The angel breathed out before leaning down and placing his hands under her arms, lifting her up. She wrapped her legs around his waist and snuggled her face into his neck, her arms holding tight around his shoulders.
“What if she got stuck somewhere,” Sam yelled over his shoulder as he opened the door to the staircase.
“Do not move,” he growled, slowly pronouncing each word with his eyes narrowed.
“What do you need, angel?” Dean turned his head and whispered into her ear, giving little love bites along her soft jaw line.
“Something’s in the bunker,” Sam interrupted, standing up from the floor and placing his hands on his hips. Cas’ face instantly hardened as he set down the grocery bags on the table and pulled out his angel blade.
“I’m done arguing with you,” Cas shook her head before turning her face to the sky and closing her eyes, taking a deep breath.
“Look at your kids, so cute.”
“It’s my fault that you two were fighting,” she shook her head, “You were fighting about me coming to a hunt, it’s all my fault.”
Castiel didn’t hesitate. He moved in pressing his lips to Dean’s. It started soft, tentative but sweet, Dean’s hand skirting up over Cas’ shoulder to rest on the back of his neck, pulling him in further. Dean’s tongue sought entry into the warm cavern of Cas’ mouth, both of their breaths hitching upon on the dual meeting of their tongues. Cas’ hand slid down to Dean’s thigh, hitching it over his hip so now there was no part of their bodies that wasn’t touching. Dean ached almost painfully with the need to be closer to Cas. He needed this. He wanted this. This, this was a decade in the making.
“Sammy” Dean wheezed  “Sammy....my back. There’s something sticking in my back”
Dean thought for a moment. It wasn’t like him to flake out like this but the fight had gone out of him. The desire to butcher and kill was no longer a flame the burned in him.
“Missed you too, fella” Dean turns to Sam, not acknowledging Castiel at all.
“Shut up, Dean”
“SAM!” He shouts in warning, reaching beneath his pillow for the gun that isn’t there
“What? You’re asking ‘what’?” Dean’s voice struggling to remain levelled. “Why is your answer to everything always to leave? Why do you always leave me, Cas?”
“You and me”
“So uh...I’m sorry to do this but I’ve got us a case. A nest of vamps over in Topeka.” Dean felt air leave his lungs as he shifted to sit on the side of the bed “Eileen and me thought we could deal but it turns out it’s larger than we originally thought. We could use your back up. You in?” Dean’s mouth was dry and he struggled to speak. He felt Cas shift behind him, stroking down his bare back to get his attention. He could sense his tension and he frowned at him in concern.
Next update within the next few days, hopefully. Again, thank you to everyone who is reading/subscribing etc. You’re all awesome.
“I love you, too, Dean”
Since Chuck was no more, things had quieted down substantially, and then the whispers about Waverley began. Experiments. Torture. Imprisonment. Considering the perpetrators were, in fact, hunters, it was a weird situation. A situation that The Winchesters could no longer let pass by.
“I’m thinking” Cas replied quietly
“Uh...something...ok...don’t freak out—“ Dean spots a shadow of movement from behind Sam and a familiar trench coat comes into view. Sam instinctually steps aside, allowing Cas to come into full view.
Cas jerked into his hand, a rough moan escaping his lips. The sound making Dean’s cock twitch in response.
“I said let it go, Sam. It doesn’t matter”
Dean’s head felt asthough it was being split in two, and he would swear that his back was on fire. He tried to move but his body was too heavy, it was too much effort.
Spring had moved into Summer. Cas and Dean had been at Bobby’s Cabin for almost two months. Two months of being alone. Two months of bickering. Two months of making up after the bickering. Two months of getting to know each other’s bodies. Two months of lazy kisses. Teo months of desperate kisses. Two months of togetherness. Two months of pure gratification.
They both stepped from the car and met at the front
“Meet you at the car in 10 minutes?”
“You deserved better, Dean.” Castiel said simply.
DEAN: 🖕🏼🖕🏼
“Dean...” he breathed to himself as his feet instinctively carried him towards the front of the bunker. Miracle excitedly ran ahead, almost skidding to a stop in front of Sam
“And kind” he pressed his lips to his left
“Dadda, we go swim?” Bobbi asked, remembering Cas’ promise if she behaved for Sam and Eileen.
“But Sam I-“
“That’s a heavy load to carry on your own but Dean, Cas’ death wasn’t your fault, you know that right?”
He wouldn’t believe you.
“Ever since I was a kid, I always  wondered what my true happiness could look like. I never found an answer because the one thing I wanted, it was something that I never thought would be on the cards for me. But someone once told me that happiness isn’t in the having, it’s in just being, it’s in saying it. And I’m ready now, Cas. I’m ready to say it”
“I love you” he whispered into Cas’ sweat damp hair
“That rough, huh? We can sort that for you. I’ll get you some pain relief as soon as I’m done here”
Sam’s voice was thick with emotion and concern “Put your arms around me, Dean, let’s get you off of this thing”
“You’re so beautiful,” Cas murmurs, caught in a dizzying spiral of lust and awe. “I always thought so. From the first moment I saw your soul, you were always so, so undeniably beautiful.”
“Not in here” He said, taking his hand and reaching over to switch off the shower.
“Sit with me” Dean said as he pulled Cas to the grass below, they sat cross-legged, mirroring each other.
“I’m just going to check your vitals, hon. How’s your pain on a scale of one to ten?” Tamika asked as she shone a light in to Dean’s eyes
The shadow laughs wryly
“I’ve got you, sunshine” Dean said as he pulled him close, flicking his wrist on the up stroke as he thrust into Cas’s hand “I got you”
“Fuck, you’ve barely touched me and I’m ready to blow” Dean says breathlessly “get these off” He says tugging at Cas’s jeans. They both work out of their own clothes, tossing them aside, their eyes never leaving eachother.
Castiel knew this place. He had awoken here the first time The Empty has ejected him. They came to a stop.
CAS ❤️: Come home
Dean cradled his gun in his hand, it was heavy and familiar against his palm. This feeling he knew. The adrenaline pumped through his veins, riding alongside the anticipation. It was almost exhilarating to feel something other than the crippling numbness of the last 12 months.
Castiel’s heart sank and he pulled back
Sam moves toward Cas
“Leave it, Sammy” Dean looked over at his younger brother. His hair was greasy, he had dark circles under his eyes and dark stubble concealed the bottom half of his face “you look like crap, how long was I out for?”
Cas’ brows knit together in confusion. “Dean? Dean I-“
Dean watched contentedly as the love of his life and their daughter frolicked happily in the lake, the sun shining down on them.
Dean sat opposite Sam at the library table, twisting his near empty coffee cup around in his hands, lost in his own thoughts as was the norm of late. Sam snapped his laptop shut with a sigh.
“Just the one?” Sam cocked a brow and Dean rolled his eyes “Say bye to Uncle Sam”
He pressed his lips to Cas’ again and his forehead fell to his, his arms around Cas’ waist, pulling him flush against him. His voice was barely audible underneath the water.
Cas works Dean’s belt and jeans undone, Cas’s finger tips brushing the solid bulge beneath the material
Dean managed a small smile of reassurance as he watched Sam retreat from the Barn, disappearing into the darkness.
“The doctor will be round shortly to talk with you. Just holla if you need anything.”
Cas sighed.
“You never have to thank me, dumbass, now come back to bed. It’s lonely in there without you”
“...Miracle.” Cas rubs behind Miracle’s ears and smiles as the fluff ball leans hard into his touch
Dean looked over at his baby brother. He was a 37 year old man but to Dean he wound always be the kid he was to protect at all costs, not his damn therapist.
“Cas man, c’mon. Let’s do this later”
“I think I feel...dizzy” Cas replied. Dean let out a small laugh.
Cas nods.
Cas remains silent as the brothers battle back and forth. Sam sighs knowing he isn’t going to win this fight.
“Go away” he groaned as it rang off. Dean sighed and relaxed back into the hard hospital standard mattress. It was meagre seconds before it started again.
Beep. Beep. Beep
“I judge me. I was weak”
Sam and Dean had no idea what they were about to step in to, they had to be prepared for every eventuality.,Waverley Hall was your stereotypical, spooky abandoned building, standing large and ominous in the dark.
“I don’t give a shit”
Dean’s eyes followed the nurse as she approached his bed. Her ID card that swung from her neck read ‘Tamika’
“It really is beautiful here, Dean. You chose well. The windmill is a nice touch”
The drive to Cas and Dean’s was relatively short for a Saturday morning, usually the roads were rammed with people out to make the most of their weekend. Sam indicated left and pulled in to the long drive way, parking behind the Impala, noting Dean sat on the cabin’s porch with his morning coffee. Dean made his way to Sam’s car and opened the side Bobbi was on.
“Of course he will, Cas. It’s Dean. Listen, I won’t betray his confidence but just trust me when I say give him time?”
“Love you, Cas”
“Dean it’ll be fine. I’ll text you as soon as it’s all  wrapped up”
The first thing Castiel feels is immense pain to his forehead. He reaches up, warm blood coating his fingertips.
“Dean? Talk to me, it’s Sam”
“Dean! What are you doing, you shouldn’t be out of bed, go back—“
“Process of elimination”
Dean forced his eyelids open, the light in the big white room temporarily blinding him. He groaned at the razor sharp poker that was being rammed down his throat.
Castiel was irritated. He was too warm. There was a hot, wet prickliness nuzzling into his neck and something was tickling against the bare skin of his chest. He groaned irritably as he was so rudely awoken from his sleep.
Shackled, battered, cut, and vacuous in the the corner of the room was Castiel.
“Oh wow, okay, you are disgusting.”
“I would if I could”
++++++++++++++++
Dean’s smile lit up his face, already flush from their love making. “That’s what I want, Cas., just you and me”
“It’s me, Sam. You may do all the necessary tests but I promise you, I am who I say”
“No” Castiel cut in “If you refuse to send me back to earth, I shall do it myself”  Castiel raised the blade to his throat and in one fluid movement he cut, his Grace spilling out into the ether.
Finally being with Cas the way he’d always wanted.
“Let’s go, Dadda! Let’s go!”
“Miracle! C’mon, let’s go!” He repeats. And he swears he sees Miracle lean further into Cas, who, at least, as the good grace to look very awkward as he side eyes Miracle at his feet. Dean clenches his jaw, huffing as he turns away, mumbling “traitor” underneath his breath and grumbling to himself about cheating dogs as he makes his way to his room.
“You hungry?”
There a beat of silence as Cas and Dean study each other
“Wherever you are, Cas. I hope you can hear me. Man, I hope you can hear me”
“Yes. Yes, I believe I would. With you”
They both slipped on to the bed, facing each other.
“And brave” his lips brush the under side of his chin
“Cas, I’m—“ Dean swallowed thickly before he continued “I’m broken. You deserve more than me but I think...I think I’m too selfish to give you up”
“Are you ok?” He asked quietly, unsure. It was too quiet for his liking.
“Cas...” he breathed against Castiel’s mouth
Sam knew to leave the subject alone for the moment, he didn’t want to pressure Dean right now.
“You’re sorry?”
“Antsy, irritable. The size of a house”
WARNING :: Brief  mention of suicidal thoughts in this chapter,
“I wasn’t wrong”
“Still holding my dog hostage I see” Dean stands in the doorway of Castiel’s room, arms folded as he leans against the frame
“Are you talking about retiring”
“What are you looking at?” Dean asked after a beat, his voice still croaky.
Cas bucked into his hand and Dean couldn’t resist. He placed a hand on Cas’ hip and the other hand over Cas’ and they worked him together
“I’m freakin awesome. You?”
“Sure” Dean hung up and tossed his phone onto the bed.
And there, as the wrens sang their first melody of the day and the sun broke above the skyline,  was a new beginning.
“Cas is an asshole. I’m moving back in” And with that Dean stomped off to his old room leaving a disbelieving Sam in his wake.
Dean was helpless underneath Cas, kissing him back heatedly
“Dean” Cas sounded wrecked
“You are the first person I’ve ever told, not even Sammy knows”
Dean took a step back, giving Cas space.
“Be quiet, Sammy” Dean heard a heavy sigh of relief beside him but it was too much effort to turn his head to confirm that it came from Sam.
Dean reaches  out a hand, hooking his pinky finger around Cas’ index finger
“I’ve embarrassed him”
“I need to get out of here, Sam, I’m signing myself out” Dean says, completely ignoring Cas’ presence just to his right.
Dean tried to take in a steady breath but it was becoming increasingly difficult, his insides were on fire. His blood felt like bubbling lava swimming along the cavity of his chest. He didn’t want Sammy around for this. His baby brother’s lasting memory could not and would not be watching his big brother die, not in this way. Dean swallowed, knowing what he had to do. He took in a last look at his over grown “little” brother. Fuck he was proud of that kid. Dean wasn’t proud of much he’d done in his life but Sam, Sam he was proud of.
You see, it had all been so easy, giving his life for Dean Winchester. The way Castiel saw it, when you knew who mattered most to you, giving things up, even yourself, well, it doesn’t really feel like a sacrifice at all.
Dean’s voice was raw with emotion as he spoke unthinkingly
Dean rolled his eyes, frustrated
There in the meadow that he had said goodbye to Cas in, Dean finally opened his heart to Castiel, the truth of his words hanging heavy in the air around them.
“I love you” he said finally. And he felt the breath leave Cas’s body as he felt a warm tear hit the pad of his thumb
“Jesus Christ” Dean bit out “That’s not why I am angry. Actually I’m not angry, I’m damn well furious!” Dean took a steadying breath as he turned further to better see Castiel
“Someone is half asleep” he said as he poked his head inside the car. He wiggled Bobbi’s little foot
Dean nodded and pulled Cas in, resting his forehead to his
“Pleasure to make your acquaintance...” Castiel slowly turns the dogs licence in his fingers to view his name
The tears dripped from Dean’s face hitting his boot below. His breathing shallowed as his mind and thoughts began to fog.
“DEAN!”
Castiel didn’t answer.
“Want you so bad, Cas. Wanted it for so long”
“Cas....Cas, wherever you are, I hope you can hear me” The words slipped through the cracks of silence like the first rays of sun through the clouds.
“Fuck, Cas. I’m so in love with you, man” Dean’s voice was barely a whisper, filled with emotion. Cas turned to face him “I never knew it could feel like this”
Dean grunts feeling stupidly jealous of his own dog. He shook away the thought.
He felt rather than heard Sam shift further forward, his voice softer as he spoke
Dean studied Cas for a moment.
“Sure will, thanks for last night, man, we’ll owe you one”
Sam said across the table at Dean
“Make love to me, Cas”
“Listen to me, you sick son of a bitch. I don’t know who the fuck you are but I swear, as soon as I’m out of here I will hunt you down and tear you apart, piece by piece do you hear me?”
“Can we take this off?” Dean asked
“I’m so close Cas. Please don’t stop” Deans head dropped to Cas’ chest as he watched their hands working eachother, mirroring each other’s rhythm. The deep growl that left Cas’s mouth coiled Dean’s stomach, he felt his muscles tighten and his balls draw up. He was going to blow his load so damn hard, he couldn’t hold on any longer
Dean scoffed.
“Very fucking funny but you’re wrong, thank you very much”
“He’s just in shock, Cas. You know Dean, he lashes out when his feelings overwhelm him. Give him time”
Dean rolled his eyes “No shit, Captain Obvious!”
“You’re right, I can’t, not if you don’t talk to me”
“I missed you” Dean whispered into Cas’ shoulder. Cas turned in his arms, linking his fingers around Dean’s neck.
“You’re an idiot”
“What the—“ was all Sam could say.
Brief mention of homophobic language
Castiel reached out his hand to cup Dean’s cheek, Dean’s eyes closed briefly as he leaned into the warm touch, relishing in the tingle that ghosted down his spine
Sam heard the bunker door slam shut and the familiar, heavy gait of Dean’s footsteps on the stairs. He watched him over the top of his laptop as he stomped to the fridge, pulled out a beer and slammed it shut again. He pulled the top off his bottle and took a long pull as he leaned against the counter.
An hour later, Dean was helping Cas pack the trunk of the impala. He felt sick and worry coursing through his body.
“I’m sorry Jack but no.” Cas steals a look at Dean. “My life is here now, my home is here. I have every faith that you can be good for heaven, for the world, like I always have. But, Jack, that isn’t my life any longer. It hasn’t been for a long time.” Cas moves closer to Dean and entwines their fingers, smoothing his thumb over Dean’s hand in a soothing gesture. “I won’t leave Dean behind. I want to be here, with him”
“You and me?” Cas asks and Dean nods
“Sammy...what is it, what’s wrong?”
“What?”
“Dean, I’m not incapable!” Cas said, slightly insulted. Dean faced towards him
Dean knew Sam would catch on to that, the kid never missed a trick.
Now it was too late. He loved Castiel. God did he fucking love him. He loved him down to his bare bones. Down to each exposed, raw nerve. But, it will always be this. Dean silently screaming into nothingness “I LOVE YOU COME BACK TO ME PLEASE” and silence would scream back.
Dean’s eyes stung with moisture and he could do nothing but lean in and press a kiss to Castiel’s lips, hoping it would say everything that he couldn’t voice,
Dean feels his cheeks heat slightly “Cas, man. You can’t say shit like that to me”
Both Dean and Cas stepped out of the car and met at the trunk, Dean almost tripping over an overexcited Miracle. Maybe bringing a dog, who he was 99.9% sure had canine ADHD wasn’t the best idea but he loved that dog and he wasn’t about to leave him behind, no way, no how “over bearing mother” snipes from Sammy be damned.
“Oh trust me, I want to” Cas said with an almost comically adamant expression “I know that you have only been with women and this body is...very male”
“That’s the plan” Cas replied pushing his hips against Dean’s, making his arousal obvious. He kissed Dean long and deep, pouring his love into it as he always did and it coursed through Dean’s veins, warming his skin, making his heart thrum against his rib cage
“Fuck sake” Dean moaned as he fingered atop the sheets for his phone. He lifts it to eye level, forcing them open to hit ACCEPT
He bent to catch his eye. His heart clenched as he saw a hint of sadness there.
“Calm your farm, Mary, where’s the fire?” Dean asked
But Dean smiled, brilliant and sated, pressing a kiss to his chest
Dean grumbled unintelligibly.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
“How are you feeling?” Sam’s voice was quiet and laced with exhaustion.
“Yeah sure. Whatever” Dean said.
“I want you to Come on me, baby. lemme see you, show me how hard you can come all over me. Shit, look at you, so fucking gorgeous. Let me hear you, Cas. I want to hear every little noise you’ve got. Give it to me, come on”
“Where else would I go, Dean? I’ve waited my whole existence for you, now that I have you—“ Dean cut him off with a searing kiss.
Dean admitting his feelings
Dean avoids looking at Sam, shifting uncomfortably in his seat
Dean sits up abruptly, wincing in pain.
Dean’s voice was barely audible as he continued
“We shall cross that bridge when we come to it”
Dean felt Cas’ body tense atop him
Castiel opened his eyes, looking at Dean, blue eyes on green
“Dean” Cas breathed “you don’t have to—“
“You will. It’s time we talked, Cas” Dean said as he walked ahead.
Dean threw a look to the clock on the wall, it read 12:22am. Dean moved to the chair infront of Cas, positioning it directly infront of him so he could take his hands in his.
Cas leaned down and kissed Dean long and deep before sitting back up astride his hip and he watched Dean as Dean watched him take himself in hand, the same hand that was covered in Dean
“Yep” Dean replied with a nod, Cas’s eyes narrowing on him. The next thing he knew was his back slamming into the wall, Cas pinning his body. Dean’s breath left him in an audible huff
“Thank you, Dean”
Dean came back to himself immediately, his eyes snapping open
“But you don’t have to Dean. I shall go. That’s my choice. Do you trust me?”
“Like you said, Sammy, this is a big job, we need all hands on deck. I’m good to go. We’ve been after this place for months. I want in. I need this, man”
“Wait, Cas. Sit up for me” Dean breathed harshly, his cock was painfully throbbing against Cas’s palm.
Castiel nodded once, a soft smile playing on his lips as his friend pulled him forward into a tight embrace. Sam leaned away from Cas, his hand remaining on his shoulder
“Dean! DEAN!!!” Dean’s thoughts were cut off by Sam’s voice echoing through the building
“I love you, Dean Winchester”
“So we can watch each other” Dean explained “I wanna see”
“It might be important, Dean” Cas breathed noncommittally
“I never told you about this place” Dean began “After Lucifer...after he...”  Cas understood what Dean was saying “After we burned your ashes, I came here alone and scattered them. I wanted somewhere I thought that you’d like, somewhere peaceful, y’know?”
Who the hell is this?” Cas was awash with relief as he heard Dean’s rich, gruff voice on the other end of the line, even if it was laced with contempt.
“Dean..” Cas cradles Dean’s face in his hands “Dean, I’ll always Choose you. Always”
Dean’s body momentarily freezes before his hunter’s brain kicks in
“I need you to trace a call.” Dean says immediately “Some sick son of a —“
“Are you worried that I’m not attracted to you because you’re a man?”
“Shut up” Dean said as he rolled on top of Cas, rolling his hips into his, his hard length grinding against Cas, sparking his own arousal
“Fuck, man. I’ve missed you” and finally. Finally, he pulled Castiel into his arms.
“Spill. Why are you being a drama queen”
“I’ve taken solace in the emptiness” he says directly
“Dean, no! WE will get them some place safe. You and me together”
Cas groans at the contact
“Surely you don’t think-“
“Look man, seriously. You know I’m ok with this, right? You deserve some happiness, Dean, and if you can find that with Cas then you should” Sam stands from the table collecting his things “Talk to him Dean, you know you want to” Sam leaves the library and Dean with his thoughts.
She said as she placed two fingers against Dean’s wrist, timing his pulse.
Their journey was quiet, neither one of them made an attempt to converse but it wasn’t uncomfortable for the first time. Cas studied the world as it sped by the window, his thoughts calm for the first time in what seemed to be quite a while, but Dean could have that affect on him.
“I know, me too. Now touch me” Castiel did as was instructed, his hand wrapping around Dean as Dean’s hand wrapped around him
Something was telling Sam to believe Castiel but he couldn’t fully commit to this trust, old habits dying hard. He switched arms to reach for the silver pen knife in his pocket. Castiel held out his palm in invitation. Sam flipped the pen knife open and sliced a fluid line across the heel of Castiel’s palm. Sam then reached to the inside of his jacket for the flask of holy water, splashing it across Cas’s wrist. Castiel watched for Sam’s reaction as each test was passed. Sam swiftly stepped back, momentarily away from Cas, trying to compute what was infront of him
“Get out” he spits out darkly
“Cas, Dean is in the hospital, he—“ Sam didn’t get a chance to finish his sentence before Cas interrupted
Cas was covered in mud and blood
“Who the hell are you?” Sam half-shouted, stepping around Miracle and moving towards Castiel, his eyes never leaving his target.
“How did you— when did you—?”
“Dean, you have suffered a huge trauma, you need to recover—“
“Of course, Dean”
Sam pushed his unkempt hair back from his face “Thought you were a goner for sure this time, man. It was a close call”
“I love you, Dean”
“Aren’t you a sweet thing?” Castiel says, encouraging the dog to come forward. His wet nose cautiously nudges at Castiel’s fingers
“Dean, unless you order me away, I will be right here. There’s nowhere I’d rather be” Cas adds, quietly. Dean nods curtly a lump forming in his throat. And there was nowhere else he’d want Cas to be other than here. And if he so happened to want him curled beside him in his bed well that was something no one else needed to know.
Hearing “Cas” and “death” in the same sentence twisted something deep inside Dean’s chest, something bone crushingly painful.
The cabin hadn’t been inhabited in a while, a dank, musty smell hung in the air and the haphazard, uncoordination of the room made Dean’s skin itch as he made a mental note to put things in order while he was here.
“You are everything, Dean” Dean’s eyes filled with moisture which he hoped the spray of the shower wound obscure.
“Cas, wait up, you don’t know where you’re going. This way” Sam directed with a nod of his head, his hair falling over his forehead. Castiel followed as Sam lead them to Dean’s room. Standing outside the door, Cas makes a move to go inside.
It overwhelmed him.
Dean leaned in and kissed him.
Cas crushed his lips to Dean’s, he took his wrists in his hands and pinned them above his head.
“I’m not sure I’m ready to go all the way yet, just...please, Cas. Please touch me. I need you. I need you, Cas”
“You love him back, don’t you?” Sam says gently. Dean just turns away, clamping his jaw tightly. He’d said more than enough on this subject
“Back to reality. Thank you for last night” Cas grinned, pecking Dean’s lips. Dean pulled him close, offering him another kiss, humming against his lips. And another. And another. Until tiny hands were tugging on his jeans
“Cas...” Dean started shyly “Don’t you want to...?”
Sam took a breath and began to explain to Cas about the hunt and the rebar “He was asking for you, Cas, while he was bleeding out, he wanted you there. Do you think that’s when you heard him?”
“I hoped you would like it, it felt very zen, y’know? I’d come here some nights, you know, to feel close to you, when I couldn’t sleep” Dean said quietly, focusing on the blade of grass between his fingers. “I’d come here and I’d beg for you to come back like a needy dumbass” Cas was silent just allowing Dean his moment. “My world falls apart when you’re gone, Cas. Grief is fucked, man. It’s like I lost you piece by piece rather than all at once, y’know?” Dean risks a glance up at Cas who’s eyes are trained directly on his face, listening intently. Dean goes back to focusing on the blade of grass in his hands as he continues “it’s like gradually I accumulated the parts of you that were gone and then a day would come when there was a particular missing part — it could have been seeing your name flash up on my phone or the sound of your voice — that overwhelmed me with the reminder that you were gone” Dean discards the blade of grass, replacing it with the lace of his boot “It sucks that we miss people like that. You think you've accepted that someone is out of your life, that you've grieved and it's over, and then bam. One little thing, and you feel like you've lost that person all over again.”
“Nothing. Just having a conversation,” Dean replied. He could feel Cas' every breath, every shudder, and every heartbeat. “I'm just talking… really close to your… face…"
“Wow, you are
.” He went up to Sam and looked him square in the eyes. “You boys just
…” He looked at the landscape extending into the vanishing point. “It makes me feel like our fight wasn’t for nothing. It makes our lives all worth it.”
Then suddenly everything made sense. The revelation hit Dean with an impact almost physically able to knock him to the ground. He understood.
Cas’ lips were soft and full and sweet. It was a hidden realm that Dean by accident had stumbled upon, but one he would never want to leave ever again. “How about now?” he mumbled, sending vibrations coursing through both of their bodies. This wasn’t a kiss. They were just…
“Uhh, Sam thought that he recognised some of the symbols in the writing, so he's gonna use the Book of the Damned to see if he can't figure out the end,” Dean said, watching Michaels every reaction carefully. “And by that, I mean...
tripped," Cas explained, gesturing with his hands excessively.
Anyone else would’ve been confused, but Dean knew what it meant. It meant ‘I’m happy for the both of you’, and coming from Bobby, he wouldn’t have wanted it to be said in any other way. “We know, Bobby. Thank you.”
"Welcome home," Bobby said and held up his own beer. "To a new beginning."
"You don’t know?” Dean asked, surprised that his words might not have had the same credibility he thought they'd had – in his mind, the intentions had always been clear.
Dean shook his head. “No. Sam never translated your book. What he actually did was to use the Book of the Damned to piece together a spell that would release a shitload of energy. We figured that would draw you attention no matter if Michael had actually given you the heads-up or not.”
“Yeah?”
(See the end of the chapter for
. You don’t understand anything about humanity, and you
"We're fine,” Dean said, giving a tight-lipped smile. “The Empty's gone, Death's dead."
As for the future, I might make a drawing illustrating this last chapter if I have time. If I do, I'll upload it. I might even finish my other spn fanfic and share it with you guys. Who knows?
“Yeah.” Sam sighed in satisfaction. His eyes glittered in the light. “I mean, we’ve lost hope more times than we can remember. I never thought we’d finally make it. Isn’t it amazing that we’re here?”
“Killing your own son? Beating us up? That made you release all sorts of power – power that Jack took care of.”
Dean smiled so much his mouth hurt. He was so happy he could cry. Finally,
. I see." Lucifer looked between Cas and Dean and grimaced. "Oops. Awkward." He spun around to face the others. “My little brother
"Okay, you said there were two reasons I might not like this," Dean said, changing tactics. He closed his eyes briefly and chose not to acknowledge the wetness travelling down his own face. "You'll die, but so will I. So what's the second reason?"
Sam just nodded and forced himself to smile through tears. In a sudden motion, he wrapped his arms around his brother, holding Dean tightly as sobs took over. He didn't make a goodbye speech – he
"Sure," Dean said. He turned to Jack, Cas, and Michael. "You three keep an eye on that one, okay?"
"So… Where does this leave us?" Jack asked quietly.
." He was happy the tears clouded his vision, because he couldn’t look at Cas right now – not with the words he was allowing to leave his mouth.
“What other choice do we have? There’s nothing left, nothing to
Dean peeked inside the box when Sam lifted the lid. Within was a sharp, twisted blade attached to a black handle. “The archangel blade. Not bad.” He carefully picked the weapon up and felt its weight in his hand. It was surprisingly heavy for something so delicate. This was their only advantage over Lucifer, and looking at it triggered an idea to form in his head. “I’ve been thinking about what Jack told us earlier – you know, the whole power-sucking vacuum situation he has going on?”
,” Cas said and looked around.
Shocked, Dean wrapped his arms around Bobby. He couldn’t believe it. Was this his birthday? Christmas? Did he win the lottery? Nothing good ever happened in his life, and now everything happened at once? Bobby had been there his whole life, in a way more than his own parents. He’d been Dean’s second father, and sometimes his
I had planned out for you. You were so disgustingly adamant on saving all these useless humans that you left me no choice but to take them
Dean just stayed quiet and continued driving. Cas slowly turned back to observing the world pass by outside the window.
That statement caught his attention, and Cas was sitting up in no time, almost crashing into Dean. He observed their surroundings with wide eyes, quickly scanning every tree and plant, trying to find clues.
, what the… Jack? Did you do that?”
"I mean, yeah? Maybe there are people he missed too."
. You're a cuck.” Lucifer made a face to annoy his brother.

," he nodded towards Michael, "but you don't want to mess with the Empty, man. Especially since Jack blew up all over her and whatnot. Real classy, just like his dad. Anyhow, I caught wind of the fact that our very own Samuel Winchester recently laid his hands on the Very Important Book, so
“Wait,” Sam protested as Betty turned to leave, but was stopped by her outstretched hand.
Dean couldn’t think of anything else to say, so when Cas stopped speaking, the buffer was gone. The world became quiet again. Suddenly it was just the two of them, intently staring at each other. He awkwardly broke eye contact and put his hands in his pockets. This
Jack’s innocent eyes were full of emotions. At the same time, his gaze bore into Dean’s, holding an intensity rivalling Cas’. "I promise, Dean," he said in that always factual voice of his.
“I’m impressed you found me. Welcome to St. Michael's.”
"I wondered when you would find it," Sam heard a voice say from behind – a voice that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up. Sam didn’t need to turn around, because he instantly knew who they would face. That voice made him nauseous, and the owner of it he resented.
“Do you wish he’d come to you instead?”
Cas awkwardly reenacted what he’d seen Dean do, and Dean couldn’t help but laugh. There was something comical in hearing an Angel of the Lord being called ‘son’ by Bobby.
. How could this possibly help them get out of here? Dean waited for an answer.
“Dean, why won’t you tell me what this is all about?” Sam raised his voice in frustration, drawing the attention of Cas and Jack.
He balled the hand that wasn’t holding the phone into a tight fist.
Michael looked up at the four of them. “I make no promises, but I’ll try my best.”
Early in the morning they had driven out here, and now Dean stood by a lake, helping Sam put together everything they needed to summon God. He looked around in between filling bowls with suspicious-looking items. It was a beautiful place. A vast lake, surrounded by trees, extended before them. Mountains emerged from the morning fog, their number doubled by the placid water. The sunlight shone through the trees, the soft light touching everything in its path. It was hard to imagine what was soon about to go down here. Dean briefly closed his eyes and inhaled the refreshing air, relishing the serenity, allowing himself to relax in the calm before the storm.
?” Dean close to shouted with anger in his voice. He could feel Cas’ intense, soul-piercing gaze boring into him. He could feel the Empty behind him, eager to swipe them both from the face of this Earth. He could feel his mind giving in, almost causing him to blurt out what he’d always wanted to say. But in true Winchester fashion, Dean skillfully bottled his feelings and pushed them away.
"Ouch. Hurtful. I'm a much cooler dad than
Dean slowly came to his senses. He shifted a bit, trying to find a more comfortable position. But even though his body lay on a bed of hard objects, his head was placed on something soft and warm. Curious to find out more, Dean opened his eyes just a crack and squinted, mind groggy like he’d been asleep for an eternity. A familiar tan fabric was there to greet him.
“Hey, Dean. You got her?”
“So this is it?” Dean asked, gesturing at the deserted town surrounding them.
Cas swallowed. “Th-the sound came from that direction,” he offered and gestured with his hand.
“But I’m gonna
“Sammy, listen. It’s not Death. It’s God.”
"Yes."
“What?” Dean hadn’t heard anything, and he didn’t need to. There was nothing more he needed in life.
“Which is hiding in here?”
“Mhmm…” Cas mumbled and stirred in his sleep.
father. Seeing Bobby again after all these years felt surreal, because as far as he knew, Bobby was still being held in lockup. Dean drew the only logical conclusion there was. ”No, Cas, this can't be Heaven.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, relax. I'm not giving him shotgun. Unless you're cool with that." Dean winked at Sam as he squeezed past him.
, we can’t both die.”
“You give up?” Chuck asked condescendingly.
will. You understand? You. Got. It.
Jack shook his head. "I'm not sure."
? When do we ever get to do what we want, Cas?”
"Dean, don't do this,” Cas tried again, his eyes not any drier than Dean’s.
“Well, there isn’t much of an option, is th–” Chuck frowned, confusion in his eyes. Despite half of their bodies being covered in blood and bruises, Sam’s laugh was bright, Dean’s smile mocking, and Cas’ gaze complacent. “You’re not supposed to be happy. Why are you smiling? Stop it.”
Sam shrugged, not sure what to answer. "I- I uhh… It seems like it?"
Dean hugged his brother tightly. He made sure to remember every second of it. Sam’s whole body was shaking, but so was his own. “This isn’t me choosing between you and Cas, you hear that?” Dean whispered into Sam’s ear. He could hear Cas say something in the background, but the words never reached his ears. In that moment, all he heard was his brother stifle the pain, trying to be brave. All he could remember was the look of devastation in Sam’s eyes.
“Seems like I don’t have much of a choice,” Dean muttered.
“Y- yeah?” Sam stared at Dean perplexedly. The fierceness in his brother’s voice took him by surprise. “Why are you saying this now?”
Dean walked into the kitchen. Jack and Cas were sitting at one table, Michael at another. He headed straight for the fridge and pulled out a beer. “How you doing? You okay?” he asked Michael.
Dean narrowed his eyes slightly, studying the man sitting in front of him. Whether he liked it or not, he and Michael had a lot in common. Their whole lives had been about making their fathers proud. A proud father was more important than anything, and they’d lived their lives by it. Dean knew that when your dad dismisses you, you don’t give up. You fight back until you gain his attention again, and that was why hearing Michael belittle Chuck’s actions didn’t sit right with him.
“We weren’t family five minutes ago,” Jack said. “You tried to kill me. You killed your own son. You’ve killed, or tried to kill, every single one of us. You call that family?”
Ignoring the question, Lucifer pushed past Dean and Michael. “Hey, my son,” he said and greeted Jack with open arms. “You’ve grown since last time I saw you.”
"Relax, I'm just ki– kidding…" Dean trailed off, because Cas was staring at him again. He'd come to realise that Cas had a very specific set of expressions reserved only for him, and he was staring at one of them right now. "What?"
.” Dean slowly exhaled and let the last words echo until they faded into nothing. Inside, his pulse was skyrocketing, adrenaline coursing through his veins, but he forced himself to keep up the cold exterior.
“Sorry,” Dean said with a stupid grin on his face. “You got the book?”
Dean shook his head slowly. His expression was of genuine pain. "I'm sorry, Sam. I'm so sor–"
"You kidnapped a
“Oh, I’ve missed you
. I sense no evil. It feels like… Heaven.”
“Yeah, but this one is about God,” Dean sat up straighter in his chair, “and how to kill him.”
“What are you doing here, Bobby?" Dean asked when the awkwardness had stopped.
“I– I did?”
just happened?
"I see it," Dean suddenly exclaimed and sprinted forward. He crouched behind a fallen table and patted his knees. "Hey, come here. Look at you. Come on," he coaxed. "How did Chuck miss you?"
Cas made no move other than to resume his staring. Dean couldn’t for the life of him understand how someone could do that without feeling awkward.
“And then?” Sam asked, looking back at his brother, stomach tightening with unease.
say would change the fact that in a matter of minutes, his life would be over. “Cas. Go. You need to warn Sam and Jack. I can stall Billie. I can buy you enough of time–”
Sooo… This was a weird chapter to write, and I’m not sure how I feel about it. I ended up changing a lot, moving things back and forth, but I hope you kinda get where I’m going with this.
The Empty was lurking by their feet, rocking back and forth as ocean waves, ready to swallow them both into the vast unknown. Dean gripped Cas by the collar and hauled him up on his feet. Putting a hand on his chest, Dean shoved Cas hard against the wall.

And so, I'm finished with s15e19. I tried to make this a fusion of canon and my own ideas, but I'm not sure if the later chapters were boring for you guys to read. I hope not :) But next chapter should be more… interesting (it's already uploaded, so you can read it right now!! :D)
"Surprise."
“I was,” Bobby said. “But the kid brought me here. Jack, I believe was his name.”
“What did you
Michael looked at Sam. “Thanks for the blade.”
“That was Billie. She’s dying. Look, Sammy, in case I don’t get to see you again I just want you to know that…” Dean trailed off as Cas walked up to him.
There was no time for thinking, but frankly there was no need to think. Throughout the better part of his life, Dean had let uncertainty define his being. But in that moment he knew. He couldn’t let Cas be taken into something that was nothing, into a world without consciousness, a world without continuation. Cas had been there when their fight for freedom began, and he should be there when it ended. What had once been a feeling shoved aside by the trials of life was now given a sliver of hope, and Dean knew that he couldn’t let it slip away. He couldn’t fathom his story ending without Cas in the picture, and he’d never been as certain about anything in his life.
,” he said, gesturing at Sam, Cas and Jack.
He punched Cas hard in the face. Hard enough to bruise. Maybe hard enough to break bones. Dean thought he saw shock-infused confusion flitting across Cas’ face. It was hard to tell, because his own eyes were filled with tears, blurring his vision as he towered above the frame lying on the ground. He bit the insides of his cheeks – not out of anger but out of determination – and delivered another punch. And then a third.
"Yeah, I can attest to that. He single-handedly killed Death." Lucifer pointed at Dean. "
Chuck laughed and shook his head. "Humans, huh? I feel sorry for you," he whispered to Cas only to be met with stone cold silence. Rolling his eyes, he turned the attention back to Sam and Dean. "Oh boy, you guys got it all wrong. I mean, I appreciate the white flag, but it's too little, too late. I'm kind of enjoying
“Good.” Dean found himself smiling for real this time. “I’m glad. She’s kind, smart, beautiful,
Dean begged in his mind.
"Okay, that's enough," Dean snarled. Lucifer had
And then Dean Winchester punched Castiel.
Sam frowned and looked at Jack who was frowning even more. He refused to believe that anyone could casually forget a deep cut across their palm. "Dean, what happened to him?"
“As far as we know, only Death can open it. But, umm…” Sam shrugged. “We're hoping maybe you can too.”
“I couldn’t let him go like that, Sammy. I took away his happiness so that the Empty wouldn’t take him.” Dean grabbed Sam by the shoulders with shaking hands, his fingers digging deep into the fabric. “But now we’ve done it. We’ve beaten Chuck, and the w-world is safely in Jack’s hands. So I can’t deny Cas that happiness anymore. I need to– I
Sam failed to understand Dean’s sudden surge of optimism. They were completely alone in existence, with no one left to help them. This was an impossibly ambitious task, even for them. “And how do we do that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I– I don’t know.”
“Okay, what are you doing? You’re scaring me now.” Sam frowned, because Dean’s surge of emotions that made no sense.
“Oh. How’s he doing?”
Alright, so after somehow managing to delete this chapter, I uploaded it again. It should still be exactly the same. Sorry <3
Sam took a step closer. "Jack, what's wrong?"
’.” Dean put his hand on his brother’s neck and studied him closely. He memorised every inch of Sam’s face, because he would never see it again. His little brother had been with him his entire life. But now they parted ways.
Dean didn't offer an explanation. He just brought up a hand to card through Cas’ hair with his fingers – just enough so it wouldn’t point everywhere. This definitely wasn't an excuse for him to touch Cas. Dean also flattened the lapels of the trench coat, smoothing them out with great care. But he left the slightly crooked tie as it was – that's how it had been the first time they met.
Betty held up the book in response. “See you guys later.”
“The Empty is its own being, just like God. It would be… unlikely,” Cas speculated. “But a nephilim has never had such powers before. It’s a possibility.”
As always, thank you for reading :)
Betty sighed and held up the book to prove a point. "Behold. In the end, there is the ending of he who created the beginning–"
Dean only smiled, averting his eyes. He resisted to look at Cas, because he had one more thing to do – one more apology to make, and one more favour to ask. "Jack… Thank you for everything,” he said, focusing his attention on Jack instead. “I haven’t always been good to you–”
Very slowly, Cas opened his eyes and stared at Dean through half-lidded, sleepy eyes. “Wh– What?” he asked in confusion.

?” Chuck squinted at the people towering over him. “Telling Michael, shooting up that light pillar – it was just a trap?"
Dean sighed and leaned back in his chair. So much for that theory. His mind was already numbed at this point, and where disappointment normally resided, there was now nothing.
“Yes. We’re taking a break.”
Because they were in a situation where Chuck had killed everyone, there was no direction to go but forward. They’d dug themselves into a hole so deep that the only solution left was to dig further down until they came out on the other side. One week ago, Dean had been hell-bent on taking down Chuck, but if his mindset back then had been anywhere near where it was today, he would’ve given Chuck the victory. He would’ve pulled the plug and gladly accepted his life as a puppet, because though his actions would be dictated by someone else, at least his mind would be free. At least everyone would still be alive.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Cas turn around at a particularly loud
. But maybe there hadn't been. Maybe there wasn’t. Never in a million years would Sam have thought that God, the epitome of kindness and goodness, wouldn’t think twice about erasing all of his creations. Hadn’t he been so stubborn… "What if we surrender?" he blurted out.
,” Bobby said. “This
“I'm not jealous," Cas protested. The way Dean had held him had vanished all his doubts.

"My dear Dean Winchester," Chuck said, slowly walking towards them. He looked around, as if admiring his most recent work. "Why do you think? Because I'm bored.
Bobby questioningly raised an eyebrow. “I think all three of you suffered severe head traumas.” He put the beer down. “Oh, by the way. That kid of yours left me a message, saying I’d understand it in due time. I assume you two probably have something to do with it.”
"How are you alive?"
“It's always been my destiny to serve you.”
Betty rolled her eyes. "Relax. I'll be back."
Instead of waiting for an answer, Bobby had already turned to look at the man standing beside Dean. “What are
“I’m not. My whole life, I’ve seen through a lens clouded by darkness." At this point Dean’s voice broke again. "But you’ve cleared my sight.”

“And what’s the catch?” Sam asked, dreading the answer, because

Cas frowned. “For… later?”
"Yeah," Dean said. "You bring everyone back –
It had been a long emotional rollercoaster of a day. Far more had happened than Dean’s mind was ready to process. He felt tired to the bone and rested his head in his hands, allowing his consciousness to drift into slumber. Time ticked, well on its way to midnight, and the silence stretched with it. Chuck’s death book was open and Lucifer was dead. The last remaining step was to lure God into their trap. Easy-peasy.
"What did you say?" A smile spread across Chuck's face. "What are those words tickling my ears?"
to humiliate Cas with his filthy, disgusting mouth. A sudden boost of adrenaline sped up his heart rate as he put himself between Cas and Lucifer, staring the latter unwaveringly in the eyes. It was stupidity at its finest to threaten Satan, but when said archangel had repeatedly made your life hell on earth, recklessness could sometimes be excused. "If you don’t tell us
“Cute.” Completely unfazed, Chuck held out his hands and suddenly had his two Winchester boys in firm grips by their shirt collars. “Didn’t you hear me?
“How do you know that?”
"You're…" Sam was puzzled when he looked between Cas’ bloody hand and the handprint on Dean’s jacket. He nodded towards Cas' hand. “What happened to your hand?"
?” Michael asked.
As a beautiful landscape unraveled before their eyes, Dean’s mind finally came to terms with what his heart had accepted years ago. This was it. This was the place to do it, and it couldn’t get more perfect. Dean didn’t believe in destiny – never had – but he believed that this was how his life was supposed to be, and he was ready to embrace it. He slowed down and pulled the car to the side of the road, onto a patch of grass.
With that said, I want to thank everyone who's read and commented on the story so far. I never anticipated such positive reactions! <3
“Has it?” Chuck took a step towards his son with dismay in his voice.
Just as Dean was about to open the Impala, the dog vanished from his arms in an all too familiar fashion. Sam actually felt himself jump in surprise, and he could see Dean’s face fall. There was something truly horrifying – something that screamed pure evil – in seeing life dematerialize and leave behind nothing but air.
,” Bobby cited, doing what Dean could only assume was his best Jack impression. “
"Fine, but if you don't come back with that book I'll kill you," Dean said. "Capiche?"
“Woah, take it easy, Sammy.” Lucifer counteracted the force and pushed himself inside. “Way to treat a pal.”

“I don’t know for how long, but we were definitely in the Empty.”
Bobby huffed. “Sure. Something like that.” He bent down and pulled up two bottles of beer from a cooler. Cas politely declined, but Dean gladly accepted it.
was on the doorstep.
"I have a feeling you won't like it… for either one of two reasons, but…" Cas turned around and walked a couple of steps away from Dean, gaze turning up towards the ceiling as if he could see past the layers of construction and into the freedom beyond. “When Jack was dying, I… I made a deal with the Empty to save him.”
“And you
Thank you for taking your time to read this, and have a nice day :)
That made Dean blush. Everytime Cas said something so innocent and unbearably sweet, it made him fall in love all over again. He wondered if Cas even knew what it did to his brain. "Well, you’ve given me a reason to–”
“Sam, that’s… uhh…” Dean trailed off, not knowing what to say. He glanced sideways at Cas, who was quietly talking to Jack, and wondered how he should break the news. His Eileen stood about five feet from him, clad in a trenchcoat and fully unaware of what was about to go down.
“Are you hiding out from your dad?” Sam asked.
A patch of land stretched before them with a roadhouse placed in the centre. An old, rusty pickup-truck was parked in front of it. As they got closer, something else could be seen poking out from behind the truck. Something shiny and familiar and–
Jack had led them to this church in hopes of finding Michael, but Dean doubted the archangel would show. They’d prayed to him on multiple occasions, asking for him to lend a helping hand. But like father like son. Michael hadn’t shown. Now they were standing at the altar, trying their luck once again.

By this point, Dean had lost hope. He turned around not expecting to see anyone, but to his surprise, a figure familiar to the eye had appeared. It was hard to distinguish outlines in the dimness of the evening, but it was definitely Michael standing at the very end of the church.

Chuck desperately flipped through the pages of the book holding his faith, but nothing but blank pages turned up. He looked up again. “It’s
Suddenly, all the memories came back to Dean – defeating Chuck, his goodbye speech to Sam, his apology to Jack, and finally, his confession to Cas. He’d seen the Empty swallow them, he’d felt himself being swept away. When darkness covered his sight, his consciousness was gone. So why was he awake? In an instant Dean sat up and looked around in confusion, the sleepiness all gone. "What the…
“Dean…” Cas whispered, only making things impossibly worse.

"Did you guys see anyone on your way here?" Sam asked.
always had the brains, bro."
Dean was in shock, and judging by the general lack of reaction in the room, everyone else was too. His mind reacted like Sam had.
It was a feeling so instant and strong that the moment Dean felt it he knew it was right. This was who he was. This was how the world was supposed to be. It all made sense. So as the Empty swallowed Billie and circled Cas, Dean jumped up from the ground and threw himself at the angel, sending them both crashing to the floor.
Cas frowned. Even though he knew Dean loved his car, this was bordering on disturbing behaviour. “Dean, you’re talking to a
? That didn’t sound like God. Dean was confused, but had no time to process anything before Sam opened the front door.
And at last, Dean Winchester whispered into Castiel’s ear.
"Oh, no no no," Sam said. "No way. Over my dead body. Forget it."
Sensing that the Winchesters wouldn’t show empathy, Chuck tried his luck with his son and grandson. “Castiel? Jack? Are you just gonna abandon me here? We’re family,
"You found a
"Cut the crap, you son of a bitch," Dean snapped. Sam could feel him fist his hands. "Why are you doing this?"
Dean's phone call had been ambiguous enough to confuse yet clear enough to worry. Hearing that goodbye call, Sam would've left for the bunker right away hadn't there been people to protect. But what he hadn’t counted on was for people to, shortly after, start disappearing. One after another, they’d all vanished into thin air. The fear in their eyes were still burnt into Sam’s mind, the screams of terror ringing in his ears. God hadn't been out to destroy other worlds - he'd been out to destroy
“Okay,” Dean whispered back, arms remaining tightly wrapped around Cas.
. This time wasn’t going to be any different.
Dean glanced in the mirror again, seeing Cas stare out of the window. “What are your chances of controlling the Empty?” he asked Jack, and saw Cas turn his head around in surprise.
“There has to be another way,” Cas muttered. “There
and feel sorry for yourself, because you have
Sam took out his phone. He answered it, was silent for all of five seconds, then bolted for the door.
“You think she’s the one?” Dean averted the gaze from the breath-taking landscape and looked at his brother. He needed to be sure.
, huh?” Their faces were so close that Dean could feel Cas’ every breath.
They were waiting for Betty to decode the book. The lack of speaking was a well-needed break from the up until now hectic day. Like a child, Lucifer was concentrating on building a tower out of playing cards. The rest of them were deep in thoughts or research. Dean found himself looking at Cas who was stoically staring down at the table. They hadn’t spoken with each other at all, Cas keeping silent for the most part, and only speaking when addressed. The ocean blue eyes, once full of life and energy, were dulled and downcast. The frame beneath the trenchcoat was thin and brittle, about to break any minute. Cas wasn’t happy – that was naturally the only reason why they were both able to sit here right now, but this wasn’t what Dean had pictured. To be fair, Dean hadn’t thought about consequences at all. His actions, although assuring their survival, had brought pain to an unforeseeable extent. Could this really be called living? What came next? They couldn’t stay like this forever. Saving Cas from the clutches of death had initially felt like an act of heroism – in saving a friend, he'd done a selfless deed – but it was in fact the opposite. This was what he'd wanted, not what Cas had asked for. His friend was deeply hurt, and Dean didn’t know how long he could keep up this charade.
“Yeah…” Lucifer sighed in satisfaction as five pairs of wide eyes stared at him. He cradled the book to his chest. “I forgot to mention – this is what pop wanted to get his hands on the whole time. Pop was the one who let me out of the Empty, because I’m,” he shrugged, “kind of the new favourite now. No big deal.”
"Hey, Mikey," Lucifer protested. He turned around and started walking backwards. "Mikey, come on, man. I get the bitterness. After everything you did for the old man, you got no better from him than me – the son voted 'most likely to suck' – and that sucks. I get it. That man had no love to give. But is this tone really necessary? We're all stuck in dad's stupid shit. Don't I at least deserve credit for helping you out?"
, it’s not like that…” Cas whispered, eyes red with tears and cheek taking on a blue hue from being hit.
Dean saw his brother lift his hand to smack the ugly face before him, but the hand hit thin air.
"None of my bu-
Death was behind that door, the Empty was behind his back, and Cas was making the mother of all love confessions mere inches before him. Dean’s mind was now aware of it all, yet he couldn’t process any of it. Everything else stopped matter. All sounds faded away. His surroundings disappeared as all Dean could focus on was Cas’ ocean blue eyes intensely staring him down. He furiously wiped away his own tears with the back of his hand, because he didn’t want to miss a moment of those eyes.
away. They’re not coming back, you can count on that."
“No mission,” Dean said, voice suddenly serious. “We’re here for life – or, well, the opposite of life, I guess.”
“Sorry, it was hard, but I think I was able to piece it together,” Sam answered.
. I’m not finished.” Dean could feel something wet drip onto his hand clenched around the trenchcoat, and he could feel his own tears slowly falling victim to gravity. "Our life isn't about happiness, it isn't about love. It's about
"Wow.
Billie walked into the room behind Cas as the Empty moved closer before him. But none of that seemed to unphase Cas. He steadily locked eyes with Dean, inhaled a deep breath, and steeled himself for the end.
Also, Cettia commented on chapter 4, suggesting that I didn’t make Michael turn on them. Unfortunately I’d already based a lot of my upcoming dialogues around the canon-compliant Michael. Their idea probably would’ve been more interesting – it just never crossed my mind. And this is why I love the spn fandom. Everyone has such great ideas! :)
“You've been Death for an

Sam froze on the spot. "Wait, the

"I mean, she's got the whole Death starter kit going with the Decoder Ring and all, not to mention the trademark scythe. Isn't that awesome?" He waggled his eyebrows as he looked at Michael. "Gotta admit, it's pretty impressive, right? All these years and I
“Alright. Then we’re done here.” Sam nodded once, and as if on cue, they all turned their backs to Chuck and walked away.
“Hey–” Dean protested when Cas determinedly yanked the phone from his hand and hung up. “Wh– Cas what was that for? I need Sam to know that in–”
“Shut up. You don’t get to talk. This isn’t about you finding yourself or whatever. Don’t pull that crap on me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don’t cry,” Dean whispered when something wet touched his face.
For a moment, Sam just stood there and desperately looked at his brother, not knowing what to feel or how to react. But then he felt anger rise within. Dean couldn’t do this. He wasn’t allowed to do this, because this wasn’t who they were. It was selfish of Dean, it was unfair to Sam, it made Sam feel cheated, and it absolutely couldn’t… make more sense.
“B-but y-you…”
“No, of course not.” The answer came almost too quickly.
“Well…” Dean slowly walked towards Cas, closing the distance between them – that eternity started
“Well, that helps…” Dean looked around. “
“It’s my power now.” Jack’s voice was calm and certain.
"Yeah, isn't it
“Yeah?”
Dean froze in the middle of a movement and looked at his brother. “Nothing,” he answered tersely, the light-heartedness all gone. “Let’s go.”
Dean had almost fallen asleep by the point Sam showed up in the kitchen. He jerked awake and, slightly disoriented, squinted at his brother. “You done?”
Jack's eyes narrowed in disgust. "You're not my father."
"No, the smile," Cas clarified.
"Look, either way this guy's coming home with us."
“You’re mine…” The words felt right. Dean smiled and pressed Cas impossibly closer to him. They fit perfectly together, the shapes of their bodies like made for each other. He burrowed his head into the crook of Cas’ neck and breathed in that familiar scent. Despite not knowing exactly where they were, it felt just right. This was where he belonged. This was where
“Save it!” Chuck shouted and extended an arm towards Michael. The archangel’s face started cracking, blinding light seeping out and into Chuck’s hand. Michael screamed in anguish, but his Father didn’t stop. An eternity of obedience, of worship, was now coming to an end, and this was the reward. More and more light left his body, and in the end, Michael’s being exploded and vanished into thin air.
“Heaven is…
"Umm, not so much. I feel
Dean looked up and winked at Cas. “Don’t get jealous. You know Baby and I are just–”
But Cas seemed to be certain of his auditory system. When his arms released their tight grip, Dean reluctantly let go. He suddenly felt cold without the warmth against his body.
“Dean, he’s not acting like himself and you
? Cas, are you alright?"
Dean couldn’t argue with that. “Me too.”
Dean shrugged and sat down. “I don’t know. He’s been at it for a while.”
Chuck quickly spun around. He was faced with Jack who must have recently materialised. Untroubled, he snapped his fingers, expecting his grandson to go away like last time. But Jack remained standing, unaffected by the action and very much alive. Chuck snapped his fingers again, and again, and again. But nothing happened. With panicked eyes, he looked at his fingers that were still snapping. “W-what is happening?” He tripped over his words, panic rising. He tried to back away when Jack walked towards him, but his grandson was quicker. With a dazzling speed, Jack grabbed hold of Chuck’s face. A golden light emanated, surrounding both of them. Chuck’s facial features froze in horror, his body spasming and breath hitching. The power leaving him and entering his grandson was visually an impressive sight. It marked the end of an era.
“Son.” Chuck nodded his head once. “I appreciate the heads-up about all this.”
“Another way?"
. “Please?”
there's something wrong.”
“Dean, I hear something.”
– and Dean just had to make a thoughtless, reckless,
Sam looked at Dean in shock. He didn't know if his brother was just playing along or if he'd also run out of options.
“Apparently, your old man has a sense of humor,” Dean said, shaking his head to get rid of the absurd scenario his mind had painted him. “He thought it would be hilarious to watch us on an empty planet.”
"The car?" In the context of what they'd been talking about, Dean could only assume Cas was talking about the Impala.
“No, uhh…” Dean cleared his throat with a sombre expression on his face. He felt his heartbeat speed up, because this was real. This was happening. He suddenly turned and faced his brother. “I'm so proud of you, Sam. You know that?”
Dean leaned forwards until his lips rested beside Cas’ cheek. He kept it there, knowing that Cas could feel his warmth. He kept it there to rid Cas of any doubt of what they were. He kept it there and let every exhale wash over his angel as the Empty started circling their feet.
belonged. Maybe they were in Heaven, maybe they weren’t – it didn't really matter. Dean could be in Hell for all he cared, as long as he had his angel in his arms.
People always say that the eyes are the windows to the soul, and for a short, ridiculous moment Dean wondered whether his soul matched the colour of Cas’ eyes. Those eyes were mesmerizing, warm and welcoming as a summer day, vast and beautiful like the universe, and within them was Cas’ entire being – everything he felt, everything he stood for, everything that made him
Jack was now technically God. But apparently, eating Chuck’s power wasn’t just like installing a plugin. With the power came the task of acclimatisation. It came with the requirement of skill, and the learning curve was steep. As of now, Jack had estimated about half of the world being back to normal. This half included Eileen, which was why Dean’s right ear was filled with the quiet voice of Sam chatting away with his girl, completely lost in his own little world.
Sam looked at Dean, not the tiniest bit amused. “No,” he said and pulled out a box from one of the shelves. “If he tries to bail on us, we need to be able to stop him.”
“And now? After seeing what Chuck's done? Still proud of your actions?” Jack asked.
“Where… are we then?” Cas asked, and Dean could feel every breath flow along his skin.
considering what they’d just achieved. The initial adrenaline-based triumph had died down, and with it the euphoria. Now, defeating Chuck just felt like another selfless act, done to save humanity. “Any plans for Earth after you’ve fully restored it?” he asked and looked at Jack in the rear-view mirror.
"I'm not sure, but I sense another heart beating."
“I have opened the book,” Betty announced, breaking the silence. Everyone’s heads turned towards her. “All that you want is in here. I know how God ends.”
“So…” Bobby looked between Dean and Cas. “What are you boys gonna do now?”
It was funny what Cas managed to do to his confidence by simply existing. Dean’s felt attraction before – enough times to make him lose count and then some. He’d always been confident in making first moves, yet when it came to Cas, he second-guessed himself in every way possible. Somehow, this was different. What they had was important, and Dean was scared to mess it up. Did Cas remember any of it? Have his feelings changed? They’d undeniably just had a weird moment, but was that just lack of people skills or did they still have something? All those questions were whirling through his mind, but Dean didn’t know how to voice any of them. “You, uhh, you sense anything?” he asked instead.
“So t-this– this was all a…
“You–” But Sam never got the chance to oppose, because Chuck was gone. With no preamble, the world was once again filled with silence as frustration took over his mind. Despite knowing Chuck was wrong, and blatantly so, Sam still felt guilty. He’d failed humanity. “I did this,” he said, staring down at his feet. “We could’ve just given Chuck what he wanted, but I resisted. I thought we could beat this game, do it better. We tried to rewrite him, and the whole world paid the price.”
Michael’s eyes widened at the memories. “I admit, I haven’t always been faithful, but I was mistaken, Father.”
“Dean–”
“Alright,” Dean said, nodding his head, his mind seemingly coming to a resolution. “Then we fix all of it. We bring
Dean was angry with himself. Angry with himself for ever allowing them to fall into another trap. They were so close –
In that moment of happiness, Dean knew exactly what they were going to do. “I think we’re gonna go for a drive.”
Dean stared incredulously at the angel standing in front of him. Leave it to Cas to twice in a row casually annoy the most ancient entity in existence. “What, so the Empty just sent us straight to something that’s ‘maybe Heaven’? Doesn't sound right.”
"No, sorry, I didn't mean–”
"Oh, but I can, Castiel. Oh, but I will,” Chuck said and grinned. “Do you know why? Because I'm God. See, this isn't
Dean shook his head. "No one. Streets were empty. Are we the only people left?"
"Huh?" Dean said and turned his head. He'd been too lost looking at Cas – never had someone managed to rob his senses like this before.
“Never,” Sam spat and rose to his feet, ready to face the next wave of sharp, agonising pain.
“I know.” Dean’s hands went directly from the trench coat to wrapping his arms around Cas. He couldn’t get enough of his very own angel.
loser, don't you think?" Lucifer said as he pointed at Cas. "You don't look too chipper, by the way." He approached his younger brother and tipped his chin up. "What's wrong, baby bro? Earth's not treating you right?"
“No, I don’t.” There was hatred in Michael's voice. In a swift motion, he moved his arm forwards and stabbed Lucifer in the stomach.
. After dancing around the subject, Cas was crashing head-first into it. And if Dean's harsh words had done more damage than his confession had repaired, he promised himself to spend the rest of an eternity making it right.
“That was then. This is now. Tell me what you need me to do.”
“Neither do I – he has something up his sleeve. Was it worth travelling across half the country just to tell me that?”
Thank you so much for reading! <3
reaper, Dean. This is the first reaper to check out since Billie, so… Wait for it."
” Sam dragged himself towards Dean, giving his brother a hand as they tried to stand up.
at him,” Sam said in frustration. “Does that look
“Cas, Death is by the door. This isn’t the best time to get philosophical and chill with the Empty.” Dean went for a cheery tone, but all he could feel was panic as tears creeped into his own eyes. His senses told him that the Empty was advancing behind him. But somehow, that wasn’t as important as what was going on before him.
“Where’s Sam?” Michael asked, changing the subject.
“Sam and I – we don’t get
“The Empty takes Cas once he finds happiness,” Dean said bluntly and bit the insides of his cheeks. “When we were fighting Death, we were losing. She was going to kill us. So Cas confessed to me his true happiness and summoned the Empty. It would take him, and it would take Billie.” He wiped away the first tear that made it down his face.
Cas got on his feet as well, and looked around some more. “This is good. This is someplace
– they managed to pull off this grand scheme of defeating Chuck and saving the Earth, he’d never truly be free or happy. Dean would never be able to tell Cas what he wanted him to hear, because the moment he did, the Empty would reappear. It felt gruesome knowing that life and happiness couldn't parallel, and what was life without happiness? What was the point in living if you couldn't share it with the people you cared about?
The last piece of the puzzle fell into place. The world was now complete, the universe back on track. A whole new dimension unraveled before Dean's mind. Cas had widened his horizon and heightened his senses. He felt his heart beating rapidly. He felt blood coursing through his veins. He felt Cas’ warm breaths tickling his skin, the way their fingers were entwined, and the gentle pressure of their lips resting against each other.
