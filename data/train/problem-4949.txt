BIRCH: Is it a coincidence that all three of them have been or currently are on Stark Industries' payroll?
When Tony was a kid, his dad would take him to the gun range. This was after he'd gone off to boarding school but well before college; he was big enough to shoot a .45 without being knocked on his ass, but not big enough that he'd learned his face was as much a mask as any iron helmet. Howard started him on a .45 because in his father's pantheon small-caliber arms were akin to toys. "Anything below a nine millimeter doesn't have enough stopping power, son," was Howard's refrain, like they were both going to war, like Howard didn't have his own private security, like the only consideration was how much damage a gun could do to a man while remaining cost-effective to produce.
"Nothing," Tony says. "Just couldn't fall back asleep. Thought I might get a little work in now that I'm up." The mark's right there. Tony's never touched it skin-to-skin, but sometimes after a fight she'll clap Cap on the shoulder, safe in the knowledge that her armor maintains the correct distance, that it shores up all of her weak points.
How do you explain addiction to a synthetic being? Maybe she can understand the psychological dependency, but there's no way for her to comprehend the way addiction gnaws at you and swallows you. Listen: Tony's an expert at obsessive thinking. He's a natural. He gets an idea in his head and it's like a worm, burrowing into his brain, eating the gray matter until it grows fat and entire, but addiction, addiction took a natural talent and turned it into a calling, until even when he had a drink in his hand he was worrying about the next drink. That's addiction.
While neither the senator's office nor other channels have made any statements, sources suggest that Boynton's fall is not due to his handling of Registration. Boynton has been a figurehead of that movement, not only as the man to introduce the Act to Congress but also as its champion and, at times, its harshest critic. Where other proponents framed the Act as a social program, Boynton made it clear that Registration was a matter of law enforcement, not aid.
"You look like someone who should be picking up litter on the side of the highway." He didn't come here to needle her, but it's hard to resist—there's always been a touch of what might be termed sibling rivalry between them, even if it's shot through with a dispassionate sexual history that largely amounted to them sleeping together to blow off steam between projects. No, the really damning part is that he
Sometimes it seems like they're destined to understand one another only in fleeting moments. If Steve is an outdated relic, a soldier called upon to sacrifice for his country again and again without any sure promise of a final rest, Tony is a premature reckoning, a builder for whom the
"I can see in the dark now." Tony keeps it as light as she can, tries not to give in to the pride at having reengineered her eyes. Stevie's squeamish about eyeballs.
A secret part of Tony sympathized the most not with Lancelot but with Igraine, violated by a man who stole into her bed under one guise but was revealed for another. It reminded him of Indris, of Kathy, of Tiberius, of...
"Hi, darling, I'm home," Tony says, knowing it'll come across as a joke. He's standing in the eaves of the kitchen doorway, and he's a little surprised Steve noticed him in the shadows, but that's Steve all over—always paying attention, even to the things beneath his notice.
"I am afraid of it," said the King, and this time it was his voice which sounded strange. "I thought, in the night time, that perhaps it was aiming too high. If people reach perfection they vanish, you know. It may mean the end of the Table. Supposing somebody were to find God?"
From his pores he exudes a golden undersheath made of peptide chains and a metallic lattice; it functions despite the interfering layer of his bespoke suit, it functions because it's an extension of Tony's nervous system, it functions as Tony intended it to function. His reflexes, already enhanced to post-human levels, grow sharper; his connection to the armor, already absolute, becomes a true union.
Unfortunately, if you want me to provide more context, I'm afraid I have little to offer. This sort of… bio-engineering, or psycho-neural software development, or whatever you want to call it, is far beyond my ability to understand. I can only note that Mr. Stark's current extra-human abilities were self-inflicted, that he was born a "baseline" human, that he does not possess any kind of latent parahuman genes, and that the Extremis enhancile is not the first time he has experimented on, modified, or performed surgery on himself.
Tony killed seventy-six people in the past week. He might kill another tomorrow. Steve can still surprise him.
"It made you worse," Steve retorts. "You've always put too much stock in technology, but this…" He swears. "It robs what makes you a person. You don't understand—"
"Of course," Tony's mouth says. He'd never really appreciated his feet before this. If Stark Industries isn't already investigating luxury socks, they certainly will be by tomorrow.
"Which is why we feel it's important to keep the lines of communication open," Brickman cuts in. "You're the nexus of all this, Mr. Stark."
And, you know, in the end, maybe it's a good thing he's anchored: the sensory input overwhelms him like a tidal wave, washing over him so hard and fast that the sky is gone before he can take one last look. He can't swim against that wave; all he can do is make himself so open that it rushes through him instead of rushing him away.
Tony sets aside his tools and stretches in place on his stool. His back pops. It's a release. It's nice. "And what did I do to deserve this pleasure?" he says.
"Sure we are," Iron Man says. "The Daily Bugle named me Tool of the Year three years in a row. I still have the plaques."
He and Steve used to talk about this. They'd sit up in the library until midnight making contingency plans—this was after Tony peeled back the helmet and admitted he was Iron Man—they'd sit up making contingency plans. What to do if Kang scattered them through time. What to do if Ultron infiltrated the Pentagon. What to do if Victor von Doom set aside his hubris long enough to actually put the cutting edge of his mind to use.
"Absolutely, Senator," Tony says. "Thank you for your time." Maybe they wanted him to stay longer; he doesn't care. His memory is not a human memory. He remembers with machine precision what it felt like to crush Steve's trachea.
STARK: Not at all. You weren't picked to write the first authorized biography of Tony Stark because you're a soft sell. Pepper knows what she's doing.
That's a lie. This is just one long line of excuses. He builds a symphony of justification. The first movement goes like this:
He shakes his head to clear it. "Your dad wouldn't have wanted this," he tries, but he should know that's going to backfire. It wouldn't have worked on Tony, would it?
Once upon a time, Tony had a secret identity of his own. Now it seems like he was impossibly young: but that Tony wasn't naive, that Tony had taken his knocks, that Tony knew that sometimes it was better to draw a line between what
"If you think I believe in hell," Maya says, "you're only half as smart as they all say you are." He can hear her even with his back turned, even down the hallway: "Are you proud, Tony?" she shouts. "Are you?
"You said it, not me. Anyway, we both know how to multitask." Tony's a couple of miles up, en route from New York City to Washington, D.C. in acceptance of the beckoning hand of his betters. If he's lucky, he might get to take in a show or two while he's there. There is, of course, a sizable stable of agents of SHIELD in the country's capital, which always comes in handy. Tony's used to having his own private army; that he now commands spies and black ops teams instead of gods and super-soldiers affects his plans less than one might expect.
Of course, Mr. Stark's commitment to extreme methodology isn't necessarily indicative of abnormality. He is, after all, a visionary, and visionaries often appear unstable to the eyes of the common man. However, taken as a whole alongside his publicly-admitted alcoholism, his sometimes manic behavior, and possible comorbid conditions like (again, this is nothing more than an informal estimate) anxiety, depression, and what may be a trauma disorder, we begin to see a picture that indicates a casual disregard for his own well-being.
The quality that Maya has and Tony does not is conviction. Maya doesn't waste time building castles in the sky, Maya doesn't let fear guide her hand, Maya doesn't forego sleep because she wakes in the night paralyzed by doubt. Maya embraces who she is. She builds the future.
Rogers refused to compromise, resisted arrest, and has avoided showing his face in public since "Day Zero" of Registration, although NYPD officers say Captain America hasn't abandoned his home city. "We know he's around," says Lydia Matthews, a fifteen-year veteran of the force.
"Great, because I wouldn't touch that with a twelve-foot pole. What I want to talk about is how they're communicating. How they're recruiting. What's their long-term plan. Why they chose physical resistance instead of fighting for different legislation through conventional channels."
"You know one of the arguments people make against gun control?" he says. "They say that a gun's just a tool, like a hammer. That you can use a hammer to kill someone, too. But you have to consider the purpose. A hammer is a tool for construction. A gun? A gun is for killing."
One of Tony's passions is miniaturization. It's a driving problem with the armor—all those bells, all those whistles, and he still has to carry the bulk of it around in a briefcase. He's come up with a dozen alternate methods, of course, and all of them are integrated into the Model 29; he can call the armor to him as either a whole or in modular pieces, he can tell it to assemble itself around him, he can even store a part of it inside the core of his bones, but none of that is really more than a terminal line of upgrade on a device that is already hopelessly out-of-date. He needs to scale it smaller without losing any of the strength or adaptability. He needs to make it more flexible, more responsive to a wider variety of crises. He needs to build himself into it.
And Tony can't not follow, can he? Is anyone here really paying him any attention? (Sure they are; he makes for a good show.) Out in the hall, Boynton is blubbering. Tony steps forward, inserts himself into the scene.
The interior is vast, cavernous, large enough to house every suit of armor Tony has ever built and a couple of collector's pieces besides. Iron Man lines the walls, hangs suspended from cables, lies in scattered pieces across every workstation and beside every machinist's tool, Iron Man is flayed open across every draftsman's screen and holographic blueprint and simple pencil drawing. Iron Man wears this workshop the way Tony wears the Iron Man.
CHABON: Chabon, uh, Jayden Chabon. How exactly does the enhancile work? I mean, it's—what you're talking about, it has to be restructuring the subject from a cellular level…?
don't understand. I understand perfectly. You think Extremis made me worse? You think it's turning me into something less than human?"
Stark had previously spoken against the bill, affirming that it went against "a long tradition of heroes dating back to the Second World War and earlier" and that it would "obstruct the ability of teams such as the Avengers to operate as intended."
It's the best kind of What If: the What's Coming. He's close enough to making it a What Is that he can taste it on his lips, which will soon be replaced with a miniaturized molecular scanner. He's so close. If he could just step inside that hollow golden glow and live there—
The greaves hit him first, impacting his calves, and then the boots, building themselves around his feet as he gains five inches in height. The backplate comes next, the chestplate, the gauntlets, and he can't do anything, he can't access his mental uplink to the armor, he can't move his body, all he can do is stand there and take it—
"We've seen it before in very narrow, specific applications. Super-Soldier Serum, that's one—what else is that but reprogramming the body to be stronger? That's not the only instance, but it's the first one, it's the one everybody wants to recreate, which is in my opinion shortsighted idiocy. Think bigger. Think about having a serum that you can tailor to give you whatever results you want. Make you stronger? Sure, okay. Get rid of asthma? Okay. What
He'd all but begged her for it. Obsolescence was on the horizon: even after a solid month shut in his garage trying to coax faster reaction times out of the Iron Man, Tony had hit what might very well have been a final plateau. Maya had agreed, and while she was out of the room Tony introduced his own changes to the Extremis profile, and then he shot himself up and scabbed over and emerged two days later with all the wireless capabilities of a satellite. He wore the armor in his brain and his bones; they couldn't strip it without his consent. Tony Stark 2.0—not yet perfect, but one step closer to perfect than he'd been the day before.
BOWMAN: It's an interesting intellectual exercise, if nothing else. What is legal and what is ethical don't always align, but in this instance there's a very real and recent ethical foundation for the law. What's so special about my work? Is it really that much more visionary than the work of the other hundred people who are skirting the rules right now?
journals. Pictures. In the end, he left it as it was, without worth, filled with nothing, all hollow on the inside.
Steve turns his head, looks at Tony, raises an eyebrow. Cap's eyelashes are a very fine wheat blond that makes them almost invisible in certain lighting. What Tony feels in that moment is strong enough to choke him.
"Even you can't control everything, boss," Friday says, a blithe dark spirit. She holds all his secrets. He hopes he keeps hers as well as she keeps his. "All those revisions came too quickly from too many different quarters to have been effected after the fact, though. You were plantin' seeds in senators' ears."
"I told you that you'd face detractors. It's true. People out there, the people who don't understand predictive analytics, who don't understand innovation, who don't understand that we have to be ready, those people like to tell me on a daily basis that this enhancile—I call it 'Extremis,' by the way, and it's a baby of collaboration—those people like to tell me that I am ruining myself. That I am an abomination. They're not wrong, although that has nothing to do with Extremis or my armor, right? Go on, Car Guy, it's okay to laugh.
"Maybe I oughta be a smartass more often, that's the kind of treatment I get," Steve adds. His hand is on the side of Tony's neck, his thumb on Tony's jawline; it feels nice, very nice.
He's never been able to decide what he wants to believe about why he fell in love with Steve. Neither of them deserve this. Not that Steve is really involved in this particular problem; this is internal, a closed system, a conclusion reached by Tony without his conscious permission. It's a wildcard. It's awful. It's the worst kind of bad luck.
Whatever happened at the end, no one can deny that Tony Stark loved Steve Rogers as dearly as any man ever loved another. I know; I can hear you cursing at me right now, but I am telling you this as someone who saw them together. Steve once said that Tony Stark gave him a home in a time when he was as lost as he had been in a theater of war; and if Stark gave him a home, then in Steve and the Avengers Tony Stark must have found a family. This was not a battle fought by enemies but by brothers. So Tony Stark was there to pay his respects (and maybe make a bit of spectacle, too). Of course he was. He neither spoke nor showed his face, but that's fine. Maybe he really was ordering drone strikes from inside his helmet, or maybe he just couldn't stand to let us see him grieve.
He lays the groundwork; he reads the public; he makes preparations. He asks about the armor. He doesn't ask about Steve. He asks about the people he killed, the terrorists, the passengers on the plane, the SHIELD agents who tried to stop him. He asks about Yinsen's son, whose death he carries no more and no less lightly than the others. He makes sure the kid gets sent home, to his mother, for the closed-casket funeral the kid's cause of death dictates. And that's the second day.
He rocks back in his seat, takes out his sunglasses, and flicks them open. "Sure," he says. "And now that you've finished with your temper tantrum, are you going to tell me what I want to know?"
SR: Well… It was forty-four. Must've been late in the year, because the president had just won his fourth term, but it was before the counteroffensive. Cold enough to freeze your nose off.
The big problem—not so much for Tony, but he has an idea—is ammunition. Everyone wants to know how War Machine can fire what amounts to four hundred rounds per minute from what is essentially a shoulder-mounted Gatling gun, but that's because they lack any kind of creativity. Tony partially subverted the problem with energy weapons, but Rhodey continues to insist on some kind of physical projectile, and Tony, because he's an obliging kind of guy, obliges.
Tony finds himself thinking of the pencils in the kitchen drawer all those hundreds of feet above their heads. He gives Reed white to play as a concession.
But what about superheroes who come to their powers by other means? Every American over the age of five knows the story of the Fantastic Four—how a family of explorers ventured into space, were struck by cosmic rays, and found themselves forever transformed into what the Yang Hierarchy calls "metahumans"—human beings who through outside forces find themselves capable of feats well beyond the average person. Jan Van Dyne is a metahuman. So is Simon Williams.
After the undersheath come the external suit devices, built from the subatamic particles up, miracles of nano-engineering. Each component has two names: there are the names Tony uses with his peers, and the names he uses with himself. Here comes the cuirass with its integrated RT core, spreading from his breastbone and his perfect heart down over his ribs; here come the pauldrons, curving over his clavicles and down his shoulderblades. Here are the greaves, the poleyns, the cuisse pair; here are the gauntlets, coming online with the repulsor whine that is now a signature rather than an unavoidable byproduct. Here is the helm with the diamond eyepieces. Here, at last, is the face.
For example: it is pure, cloying sentiment that brought his old Avengers ID card to his hand. It is pure, cloying grief that drives him to switch it on. It is pure, stifling despair that leads him to say into the card, "Steve. We need to talk."
Tony goes down, down, down to the great cathedral built beneath his tower. He doesn't come here much these days; there's no coming back from final impenitence, not when the opportunity for contrition is long past, not when he's living a twilight existence that is as close to the afterlife as he'll ever come. Some hours he feels like he's already dead, but his body has yet to catch up.
Here's how it works: you're a kid and then you're not a kid, you were always a kid and never a kid. You wake up one day in a cave, and you think,
"There has to be a common thread," he says, and then pulls a face inside the armor. It's the first time he's been aware of having a face in weeks. "There
The second is make a scheduled talk-show appearance. He goes in full armor, trades quips with the host, shifts the tone in a suitably solemn direction when he talks about the temporary necessity of SHIELD ground patrols.
"I think we owe it to what we were to try," Tony corrects. There's a cracked picture hanging on the wall behind Steve. A grinning Hank McCoy has his arm thrown over Simon's shoulder while Carol mugs for the camera behind them. It's crooked, tilted almost forty-five degrees above level.
He woke up once to save them; there was nothing to say he wouldn't wake again, should need be great and hope spread thin.
Because she's his, he can be honest with her; she'd take his secrets to the grave. "The registration bill," he says. "Pensions. Putting together a landmine disposal organization. Exploiting van der Waals' forces. What the hell Dario Agger is doing to Roxxon. Steve. Improving my operating efficiency. The Negative Zone. How I get a little weak in the knees every time I remember I'm on a team with Doctor Adam Brashear."
not as the Tower but as 890 Fifth Avenue, which now exists as a very expensive property holding that generates no revenue. He could turn it into a museum and charge admission; people would pay plenty to see the Stark Ancestral House, never mind that it's also the place that sheltered the Avengers. The biggest fault in Tony Stark is not that he hasn't yet overwritten sentimentality but that he doesn't
"Inventing jag. I'll be fine in the morning," Tony says, because it's better than saying that he's well on his way to never needing sleep again. Steve would worry. Tony has yet to quantify why Steve would worry, but the evidence is persistent; Steve tends to disapprove of situations that lead to Tony modifying himself, although amending a little code would probably be more favorable than surgery. They each give of themselves according to ability, and this is what Tony is able to do: he can make himself better to make them all better, he can plan for a hundred thousand scenarios, he can watch Cap's back, he can future-proof the Avengers. Eventually, Tony thinks of everything.
"He's got a lot of time to think in that fancy prison cell of his," Tony says. He isn't bothering to speak out loud anymore—his brain can translate thought into a digital signal that Friday reads right out of the armor's transmission. She doesn't have direct access to the armor; in the wake of Yinsen's son, Tony keeps her as separate from the armor and from Tony himself as possible. She monitors him every second of every day, reading only outputs, quietly collecting data and building a real-time forecast. There's a kill file written into her now that will stop Tony's heart in his chest if she detects a pattern of threatening behavior. Eventually, Tony thinks of everything.
Tony breathed in. He breathed out. Slowly, he increased pressure on the trigger. Time went viscous; he squeezed and he squeezed and he squeezed and nothing happened although he knew
At 6:03:33, Tony discovers he can access the electrostatic venting procedure meant to discharge any excess energy he can't absorb and convert with the suit. Steve has both hands wrapped around the armor's wrist; he's clawing at Tony's fingers.
"I built my panacea," Maya says. "The first release is ready to go. It's airborne, deliverable by warhead. In a couple of minutes, nobody on the Eastern seaboard will ever have to worry about dementia again." At his panic, she grins. "Just a little bit behind, aren't you? Then again, you always are."
In another subversion of expectations, Steve doesn't huff, doesn't glance at the TV, doesn't look skyward for the strength to withstand Stark business rituals. He keeps looking at Tony. Tony refrains from squirming, even if there's something terrible about being looked at by Steve, something he can only just barely stand.
Tony can just see Steve's reflection in the glass, his face given a golden glow from the lights shining through the window. New York is always so bright; it's a wonder there's room for shadow. Like this, with Tony in the armor and Steve in his boots, Tony is demonstrably taller than Steve. It's the only time he's able to look down on Cap for anything.
"If he'd just figure out that he doesn't have to do everything alone, maybe we coulda stopped this whole thing before it got out of the gate."
He can't sleep on the plane. He can't even have Friday, at least during liftoff, although once they're in the air he slips his earbud back in his ear and slumps against his armrest. Having a window seat almost makes up for the indignity of being forced to sit in coach.
"You always know," Steve says. "Why do you think I would flay you open like this, over and over again?"
They reloaded the gun together. Tony lifted the revolver, braced it with both hands, squeezed the trigger. He told himself to stay steady, but before the bullet had fired, he shied back.
Senator John Boynton (D-NY) introduced the Superhuman Registration Act to the 109th U.S. Congress. It passed through both the House and Senate with unprecedented speed, and the president signed the bill into law in the early days of summer. Mere hours after it passed, Steve Rogers, in one of his usual iconic displays, announced his decision to resist Registration and go underground. Neither the announcement nor the resistance were peaceful.
"Somethin' like that," Friday agrees. "Has it occurred to you that you're fixating on the cornfield kidnappings to distract yourself from bigger problems?"
"Fortunately, I no longer need legitimacy. I have a network and resources of my own. You might recall what that's like."
"I'm sure," Tony says. "Someone else needs the background here. We've got it, she wants it. Call it a contingency."
soulmate never entered her mark in the registry. Because maybe she's dead. Because maybe she doesn't want me. Tony spent the first twenty years of her life with every
DAEDALUS: Don't condescend. Even you can see we're far behind our projected timeline. We need more people.
BOWMAN: Of course it is, but we aren't really arguing objective value. What we're talking about is perception, that disconnect between the internal state and what the external world assigns as motive. Tony is a textbook case. This Registration bullshit, for example. Do you really believe he's leading the charge because he thinks it's the right thing to do?
—and unlike Steve, who passively gambled on an unknown formula, Tony built this transformation himself. He understands it from the ground up. He sees what's coming. He makes it happen.
"I'm starting to think you're right," she says. "You clearly have no idea what it's doing to him to have to fight you."
The specifics of Dr. Yinsen's death are likewise shrouded in secrecy. "No comment," Stark says when I ask about the rumor that Yinsen sacrificed himself to save his companion. Our interview ends shortly after; Stark claims he has another meeting. One of his personal assistants hurries him out the door. Another leaves me with a gift basket branded with the SI logo. I wonder what Yinsen, notedly outspoken against the greed of capitalism, would have thought of Stark's persistent approach to marketing.
"Just think about it," Pepper says. Her eyes shut. There are tears streaking down her cheeks now, collecting along her eyelashes until the weight becomes too much; it's the first time he's seen her cry since she got the call about Happy. Even now, it's remote. Whatever part of Pepper is engaging with this present reality is hidden somewhere far out of Tony's reach.
With a monstrous expenditure of effort, Tony sits up. He is aware that he only sits up because Maya lets him. He's aware, and she's aware, and aren't they both just so damn smart?
"No," Tony says, "don't answer that." He shoves one dangling earbud in his ear as he hops into his socks. "Not even the stealth suit?"
DAEDALUS: I can't believe how fast this is coming together. Or that we had enough funding to pull this off.
Could be any one of them. Could be a freak accident. Tony's always inclined to believe the former, but his luck is rotten enough that it could easily be the latter. That's eighty of his people trapped in a building with no way out—eighty of his people in his city, and he hasn't visited that plant in over a year, he has no idea if the safety inspections were being performed to his standards—
It's perfect. It's the perfect image, the perfect morning, as refined over the course of a decade by a man skilled at playing What If. He tweaks it sometimes—Steve wakes up grumpy, or Tony does; their bickering has more edge before it softens; instead of talking, Steve rouses him with slow, soft kisses, first on his neck and then, once Tony starts to stir, on his mouth. In that perfect morning, Tony is secure enough in Steve's love to tease him about money. In that perfect morning, Tony's adoration is not a burden. In that perfect morning, constructed and refined after years of fabrication and testing,
Iron Man opens his eyes. Twelve blocks away, in a private hospital room, Happy Hogan's heart monitor flatlines.
that Tony can only fake. Until now. Now he's just a lonely insomniac playing chess with another lonely insomniac in the middle of the night while the world outside sleeps, its sole respite from their planning.
When asked about his change in position, Stark said that recent events made him reconsider his views and cited public opinion and incidents like the hostage situation in Springfield and the Stamford crisis.
Hill's no fool. Tony respects that about her. It doesn't alleviate the frustration of discovering that SHIELD's internal memo on the requisition order reads 'REPORTS BY HARD COPY ONLY.'
This is in some way the crux of the entire fight. It's a thought that's been eating at Iron Man, gnawing on him, that despite his burgeoning ability to regulate his emotions and reprogram his mind just—won't—go—away. It's a thought that makes him desperate, a scar on the perfect surface of what Iron Man is becoming.
CB: Actually, that's an intriguing idea. I have to finish my definitive account of Iron Man first, though.
Steve draws up beside him. Tony can just see him in periphery: his strong, straight nose, his fine eyelashes, the stern line of a mouth made more generous by familiarity. He's wearing the union suit, but his face is bare.
JK: Temporary lockdown only, Tony. Until we're sure you don't pose a danger to yourself. We won't be able to access it, and you get to supervise the whole process.
"Sure, okay, let's go with that argument," Tony says. "What about all the people you dragged with you? Luke and Sue, that's one thing—they both have families, but they'd probably dig in their heels no matter what. Kate Bishop, though? Cloak and Dagger? Firebird? Spider-Man? Actually, scratch that, Peter didn't surprise me. Clint—Clint would jump off a bridge if you asked him."
"If that's what you want," Reed answers. "We have plenty to keep us busy here, anyway." There's a certain purity to devoting yourself to work in times of deep emotional distress—not that Tony should be able to claim that right now, considering he's entirely responsible for the situation—but if he can't hope for benediction, he can at least count on distraction. Or maybe grief and guilt are the real distraction; if Tony had the time to build a better human, he'd do something about that.
"Project 42," Friday corrects. She pauses before continuing. The pause is not for Friday's benefit but for Tony's; she can think at speeds that leave even Tony's post-Extremis brain scrabbling in the dirt for traction.
"Anything for you, Tony," Steve says, and then his big hands touch Tony's leg: one braced just above his ankle, the other around his toes. At least if he's going to die, he gets to die with Steve touching him.
"They won't tell me all of it, but I know they're after the blueprints for the repulsor tech," Pepper says.
"You don't have much time," Steve reminds him. Tony half-expects to see the shield strapped to his back, although of course the shield's in better hands; Steve wanted someone else to have it, and Tony could execute that one last thing for Steve.
So: Cap lost. They stripped him of his shield and his freedom and, handcuffed, marched him up the steps of a courthouse, where he was fatally shot in the head and the chest by an unknown assailant. We all saw it live, on national TV. It's the Kennedy assassination and the Challenger tragedy all rolled into one. How many schoolkids were following Captain America's trial as a current events project in their homerooms?
Lila brightens. She's a thing to behold, making connections at speeds that must leave her classmates in the dust; Tony wonders if she's noticed how lonely it is at the front of the pack. "Yeah? What kind of interests?"
But after a while he stops calling, because Iron Man never called him back. It's the cleanest, the simplest, and by some value the best choice. Cause and effect. They conduct official business through official channels, and Iron Man doesn't have to answer to all the charges he can't face.
To repeat: Stark and Hill are the two most crucial figures in this whole circus. Without the backing of SHIELD, there is virtually no way to enforce the Act, much less detain anyone who resists. SHIELD may have its fingers in not only every pie but every cake out there, but over the past decades their primary specialization has become addressing situations that involve superhumans, no matter where their interests fall. The director of SHIELD exercises a degree of control over the organization that is, if not unilateral, still extraordinary in its scope. Hill's cooperation must be a continuing priority. (Continue to follow protocol concerning Fury—if he is still alive, and if he takes steps to contact Hill, take immediate action.)
Where the Avengers live there is light and shadow. The light spills out of the kitchen; he can hear voices in there, Carol and Jan, Rhodey and Clint, Peter laughing at himself. The old is gone, but there's something special here, too, something new and bright and enduring in this reincarnation. Tougher, maybe, too, more grounded and less heady, but that's the price of experience and the knowledge of grief, because there
The room is cast in dim lighting. There are panels half-lit along the edges of the room, some screens still powered on. One of the workstations has a screensaver that's cycling through different types of pasta. The weirdest fucking people work in places like this; the weirdest, and the most brilliant. Once upon a time Tony cultivated those people, lured them from other companies, scooped them out of academia, gave them a haven when building better bombs got old. Now the only R&D he deals with is the Registration Division, and they stripped him of his armor and authority and left him naked and shivering. How is he supposed to come back from that? He can't even recognize his body anymore. It's as though he's still someone else, some separate thing that lives inside this skin and these bones and pilots it around like all his flesh is just one more suit of armor.
They crack his armor, and Tony doesn't resist; it's not worth the effort, it's not worth the effort to break through the ice of the paralysis that overwhelms him. What happens is that he cracks the armor for them.
They try to have meetings like this at least twice a week; most of the active-duty roster live in Avengers Tower, but tripping over each other in the laundry room doesn't necessarily equate to everyone having the most up-to-date information. The burden of leadership falls primarily to Steve and Tony, who both shoulder the day-to-day operations, although Tony does a little more with communications and funding and Steve comes down harder on field work. Jan pitches in with the organizational side every now and then, but one of her conditions for returning had been not having to chair the team "no matter how much either of you beg."
. Calling it a super-soldier solution wildly obfuscated the power and flexibility of her enhancile, of course; when she mastered it, Extremis could be a cure for cancer, for dementia, it would be a way to make humans durable enough to survive on Mars, it had the potential to level the playing field between
Rogers hesitates, and then he pulls off his glove and offers his hand. Just like that, three hundred top-priority processes in Iron Man's head shut down. It can't be that easy. It's never that easy.
was spotted in the skies over Connecticut by Carol Corps member @warbird77. She appeared to be flying escort for some kind of military transport. No mention of her in the news—too bad Sally Floyd's AWOL.
Tony builds a symphony of justification. The second movement, a theme foreshadowed in the remarks of Trish Tilby, goes like this:
"Happy," he calls. Hap turns around, raises his eyebrows. "If you caught me doing something I shouldn't," Tony says. "Something… terrible. If I lost control. Would you stop me?"
He sees Steve from a distance. His arm's in a sling, but his ear is fine. He looks… tired. Tony remembers being tired, once; now he's not sure he'll sleep ever again. And that's the first day.
"No, Hill is right," Iron Man cuts in. "We have one shot at this. Lay the trap, draw them out, take them into custody. Hill, authorize the transfer of all top-tier resistors to Prison 42. Move Barton last. In fact, drive him straight through the city to the Ryker's Island gate. We're going to stage a breakout—make it look like he got away just long enough to send a message about a back door into the prison to his allies. Rogers won't be able to resist."
"No." Steve drops his shield on the table, plants his hands at the edge. Without realizing it, they've taken up opposite ends. "This isn't about abiding by the law. You may be able to convince the rest of the country that you're toeing the company line, but I know you better than that." This is going to hurt; whatever Steve says next, however he assesses the content of Tony's character, it's going to hurt.
His chest is whole, no bone-punch circle; his fingers are here; his face is fine. The nightstand beside his hospital bed holds an earpiece and a glass of water. When he reaches for the glass of water, his hands are shaking, which is a reaction he thought he'd coded out of himself. Tony Stark 3.0 may be close, but he's not here yet.
Authorities have yet to publicly announce the cause of the collision, but an unnamed American source says the physical evidence points to deliberate sabotage. The same source claims that a high-ranking member of the Ten Rings terrorist organization was traveling on the flight under an assumed identity.
He's out of the weapons game but he's not out of weapons. He's surrounded by a dozen of them, perfect soldiers and women with stars for hearts. He lives in a weapon; he makes his home there, in the armor, and when he couldn't carry it close enough he learned to carry it inside himself.
Piece One and Piece Two trade a flat-faced glance. Pieceless, above such pedestrian matters as hesitation, says, "Thank you, Director." And then, to Boynton: "Senator, you are under arrest."
"Maybe not, but you're givin' it a good effort all the same." It's nice that someone thinks so. "What now?" she asks.
"Tony," Norman Osborn says, "I look forward to working with you. We're going to do some great things together."
The story started like this: Uther Pendragon, king of all England, saw the wife of the Duke of Tintagel and desired her. She turned him away and fled with her husband (there's the faithfulness, not in her rejection but in their trust and devotion to one another). Uther followed and laid siege and his armies broke on the walls of Tintagel (there's the strength, the courage to publicly flip the bird to the king of all England instead of running away with your lover in the night, which is what Tony would've done if his powers of prophecy had been up to scratch). So one of Uther's knights—one of the really rotten ones, Tony always assumed—he goes to Uther, and he tells Uther about this guy called Merlin—
. It wasn't perfect. There was still a lag caused by the translation of thought to physical action by the cybernetic array—less of a lag than the translation of thought to body to armor, but still not the perfect, immediate unity of prediction to armor. And there were, of course, human reflexes to consider—
Maybe dying at Steve's hand isn't such a bad way to go. Maybe, if Steve thinks this is what he deserves, it's even right. He didn't calculate this outcome, not his behavior and not Steve's, because his problem is that he had to be told what Steve was born knowing.
Tony has killed men, he has broken laws, he has assassinated the leaders of alien races, he has lied and betrayed and rotted every relationship that ever mattered, he has puked all down the front of his shirt and not even bothered to clean himself up, he's been such a spineless sack of shit that he sat down in the snow to die rather than taking responsibility; but nothing has ever made him feel ashamed the way this makes him feel ashamed.
He's long gone by the time Tony makes it back into the building. The rest is clean-up, not easy but no longer fuel for nightmares; Carol and Jenn had already guided most of the people present out of the building, and even Tony's armor doesn't carry enough suppression agent to fight a fire of this scale. Time to hand it back over to the professionals. He meets up with the rest of the Avengers on the north side of the building. Jan and Natasha are talking to a fire department official. Danvers is standing to the side, arms crossed while she stares out into the night. She looks pissed.
He doesn't flip back his faceplate. He removes the helmet altogether: by hand, without any flashy foldaway, like a knight taking off his sallet, and he sets it on the dining table, and then he reabsorbs the portion of the undersuit that covers his head, folds its molecular chains back into tidy coils beneath his bones. Steve watches with his jaw set so firmly Tony can see his teeth grinding, can see his masseter muscle flex, can see the tension headache starting to build at the front of his skull.
That he continues to wait is not effected by the act. He was waiting before; he was still waiting. Calling out to Steve was a discrete function unrelated to anticipation. He's waiting for an answer to present itself. There's a state he can reach under certain conditions of deprivation—almost a state of grace. If he can push himself to that state, he'll know the right thing to do.
It takes him a long time to fall asleep, but when he sleeps, he dreams. In the What If of his nightmares, he's at home again, in the foyer; his mother sits on the bottom stair of the grand staircase.
"Right. So you're correct in extrapolating that I want clean energy to be one of our major areas of focus as we move into the next decade, but that's only part of what I'd like to be a complete overhaul. We're a tech company right now. That's what people think when they see the SI logo: technological applications, whether it's a laptop for personal use or a software package for the private sector or a set of body armor for the military." Tony pauses. "What I'd like us to become is not a tech company but an
"I always figured you'd jump at the chance to wake up in the future," Steve says. "You're as much a man out of time as everyone else says I am."
"I made them," Tony says. "That means they're my responsibility." He struggles forward, wraps his fingers around the gauntlet of her wrists and tugs not at flesh but at metal. The red composite is the brightest thing in the room.
When Tony was a kid, his father used to take him to the gun range. Not often, but occasionally, enough that he'd grown used to the weight of the grip, the slam of the recoil. The demonstration of applied physics was always fascinating—he spent a couple of months obsessed with ballistics tables, which eventually shifted to a fixation on ballistics coefficients for satellites—but the most important lesson he'd taken away hadn't been quantifiable at all.
"I think everything through," Tony says. It's soft, a whisper of air within the confines of his helmet. Maybe it doesn't reach past his ears. Maybe he's talking to himself.
"If I can't trust a Rhodes, who can I trust?" Tony levels a finger at Rhodey. "Don't answer that." The elevator drops below the employee-access basements and deep into the secure levels of sub-basements that only a handful of people can access without Tony's express permission. Rhodey's one of those people and always has been, despite their occasional differences in opinion.
Tony has always walked close to the border of transhumanism. There's an argument waiting to be made that he transgressed that border years ago, first as an accident in the pursuit of staying alive, and then later deliberately, as he put control chips and psychotransmitters and artificial hearts inside his body. Extremis blew those doors wide open. What's the next step? What's the step beyond that, and beyond that?
became a scab, became covered in crusted blood and shed skin. Under ideal circumstances, you'd have a fluid drip and someone to monitor you while your wetware overwrote itself. Under other circumstances, you crossed your fingers and hoped you didn't die. The mortality rate even under good circumstances was staggering: a terminal stress-test.
She knows, that's what this bullshit is about; here's Tony trying to make polite conversation, and she
Steve Rogers is not his first love, not his only love. Tony Stark exists outside of Steve Rogers, independent of him; he made value calls before Steve came out of the ice and in Steve's absence he continues to function. That Steve occasionally eats up Tony's whole field of vision is a flaw in Tony himself. Tony is flawed. It's fine. It's a function of being Tony Stark. He'll have a patch for it soon.
and instead he has in himself discovered a depth of fury previously reserved for Justin Hammer and the impartial machinations of the blind gods of the universe.
Director Stark was already carrying a heavy burden thanks to his role in the passage and enforcement of the Registration Act and additionally experienced significant personal loss during the subsequent splintering of the Avengers and the death of Steve Rogers, with whom he was once close friends. Certainly that burden has not been lessened by his assumption of Maria Hill's role, but Tony Stark has always been a man who under duress either fails spectacularly or rises past all conceivable expectations. He is a man of extremes. In my experience, the latter is far more likely than the former.
software, capable of being hacked and upgraded as necessary. I'm in favor, obviously. I've done it to myself. It doesn't have to be that radical, but the possibility is there, and the possibility should be nurtured.
"Is it that much of a surprise? I sold it as a super-soldier enhancile. Those are the magic words—the DOD fell over themselves to break me out and give me money." Her eyes drift to somewhere over his left shoulder. "I wonder what Steve Rogers would think of that."
. Past and future, meeting only in the present, joined only by the illusion of continuity, the idea that what has happened is related to what will happen. They'll only ever have one moment at a time. In the end, if they ever meet at all, they always meet in the middle.
There's really only one bottom line. If he's going to die, he might as well take this last sacrament.
Someone's shouting on the other side of the bulkhead. It probably isn't real. What's real is Georgia Messner, six foot even, laid out on this table like a pharoah. Somebody put a metaphorical needle in her very real vein and shot her full of a substance that lit her up like a Roman candle, that ate her alive from the inside out. Somebody hurt her. Tony can care about that.
Tony knows how this one goes. He's seen Carol with Rhodey, knows that before Steve Rogers got shot in the heart there might have been the potential there for something strong and satisfying and lasting. He'd just never been sure that Carol wouldn't have dropped everything and raced to throw herself at Drew's feet should Drew ever decide to exercise the option. Maybe Carol has a love like an anchor. Maybe she is anchored still. He wonders if she ever hated herself for being unable to cut the chain.
That the situation has escalated to such a vicious, bloody state is apparently no surprise to Tony Stark, though, who tonight remarked that "[he'd] always seen this coming."
He's just so bare. The denotation is that he's open to suffering but the connotation is that someone has grasped his hair and tipped his head back so the bare line of his throat is laid shivering and sensitive before the teeth of the blind universe. Vulnerable is the watchword.
"Dr. Hansen's missiles were successfully diverted. FuturePharm exploded, but not before Colonel Danvers staged a very dashin' rescue. Zero casualties."
Steve's eyes are bluer than the sky. They're a hot blue, gas blue—how could you ever mistake him for cold? This isn't a bad way to go. In a certain sense, this is Iron Man sacrificing himself for Captain America. He can think of worse deaths.
"Business," Tony says. Secrecy. Also by Tony's design. He likes to tell himself there are good reasons for it, but maybe he just doesn't know what to say. SHIELD's at his heels, and the mysterious son of Doctor Ho Yinsen is at theirs, herding them all off the edge of a cliff. Tony shouldn't be here. Tony should be downstairs, in the garage, engineering a solution, or he should be out there, in a holding cell on the helicarrier, removing himself from the equation.
"So all this is revenge? Using Iron Man to take out Ten Rings, and then killing me to get rid of the evidence?"
"You didn't hear what I said to him. Don't know what I was thinking, laying an ultimatum on him—I should know by now that only gets him desperate."
Fair enough. That's fair. Sure. He's been there, he's gone nuts over people stealing his tech, his intellectual property, although when he went nuts it wasn't for
But that was years ago, and he's lost the metaphor, or maybe the real conclusion is that Tony over-identifies with all fictional people and under-identifies with all real ones.
"Yeah, that was really helpful." Every part of him aches. He has sand in his eye sockets, blood smeared on the side of his face. People keep cracking his suits and dragging him out into the bright air.
"I oughta wait it out, but…" Steve shrugs; his massive shoulders imbue the gesture with something more, something monumental and titanic. Or maybe that's just Tony, who has reached the stage of self-actualization where he can admit to a fascination but who will never reach the stage of self-actualization where he can admit to that fascination out loud. 'Fascination' is the wrong term, but language is tricky like that, imprecise. "You off to bed?" Steve says.
He flinches in anticipation of a seventh blow that doesn't come. A deep shudder runs through him, but when Steve retreats from his field of vision, Iron Man discovers a reserve of energy. He considers it, calculates whether his body can still move. A painfully long time later, he stands. Rogers has dropped his shield; he's staring with the thousand-yard vacancy of a man who can't believe what he's seeing.
Tony's heart has been perfect for years. No more bum ticker throbbing away in a jagged tattoo; his heartbeat now is strong, steady, an even drumbeat stretching from the present into the future. Sometimes at night he presses his palm over his ear and listens to the regimented tempo of it. Maybe he isn't as broken as he thought. Maybe he can function not as a great man but as a good man, someone whose selfishness is balanced by moments of grace. Maybe the harm he does will be outweighed by his kindnesses.
"I'm fine," Tony says. "Whoa, calm down, I've done worse to myself in the shop." But she can't stop Stevie from turning her hand over, a frown settling on her brow as she examines the skin for damage, and Tony's fondness cuts through both her alarm and her self-pity. "What's the prognosis, Cap?"
"I changed the message," Iron Man says. "At 9:38 last night Barton purportedly made a secure broadcast containing the route his convoy would be taking between the Senator's hotel and Ryker's Island."
Reducing the struggle over the Registration Act to a conflict between two figureheads may be disingenuous—in this week alone, four national newspapers ran front-page headlines that were all variations on the theme—but there's no denying the very real ways that Stark and Rogers are shaping their respective camps. Anti-Registration voices have adopted Rogers as a symbol of protest, and the most enterprising of them are already capitalizing on it; Bebe Summers, who sells her crafts on Etsy, reports a nine thousand dollar gross in the past week alone thanks to her iconic "I BELIEVE IN CAP" buttons and T-shirts. Those in favor of the SRA have attempted to rally around the slogan "I STAND WITH IRON MAN" with little success.
"The vambraces next," Carstairs had said, and then, "The pauldrons, the cuirass." He'd probably used different words; those were Tony's names for his gleaming full plate. "Now the helmet," Carstairs said, and Tony had popped the seal and bowed his head so they could take it off him.
They're doing really well, the both of them. Tony isn't drinking and Carol isn't drinking and maybe that's part of why Tony doesn't take his helmet off anymore. He'd made repairs, after Steve had tried to cave his face in; the new helmet is reinforced, rebuilt, reborn to be something better. Or at least something less likely to shatter when an opponent drives the edge of a twelve-pound vibranium-alloy disc into his head to crack his shell and drag his soft body out for all the world to see. They're doing really well. Carol isn't drinking, and Tony isn't drinking, and if they're staring at each other with the sort of vacant grief that suggests neither of them have slept in six days, it's fine, because they're doing really well, because they aren't drinking. Tony doesn't need to sleep anymore anyway. Almost doesn't need to sleep. He sleeps very little; he never needs more.
Maya Hansen, sighted more than once on the arm of industrialist playboy and reader-favorite Tony Stark, has been denied an appeal for parole. That's right, ladies—Tony's old flame is now a jailbird! We're betting that arm of his won't stay empty for long.
ROGERS: It occasionally works against us, because the rest of us can't keep up with the way he pulls solutions out of thin air, but when your back's against the wall, it pays to have a conjurer on your side.
"Of prison?" She takes her hand away from his chin. That's good, it was already too much contact, it was already more than Tony can take although he wears this body like armor, within it but separate from it. "I did what you would do, Tony. I cut a deal."
"It's what he'd want," she continues. She's so calm about it. How is she so calm? "There's no reason to drag this out and make him suffer. You can make it an equipment malfunction. Or not; you can fool the monitors. Maybe he just… fades."
"Maybe not," Steve says. "But you hoped for it, didn't you? How abnormal do you have to be, Tony, to think there was even a sliver of a chance that I felt the way about you that you feel about me?"
Presumably there is a long line of Stark men marching back into the paleolithic with rocks glasses and decanters and snifters and tankards and chalices and skins of liquor caught in their hands. Presumably Tony is just one more cog in that grand machine of weakness. He can't say. Howard Stark was an alcoholic, and Tony Stark is an alcoholic, and any children he has might be alcoholics, which is one reason but not the only reason he'll never be a father.
Tony feels like his skin's going to dissolve and leave him naked. No—he feels like the armor's going to dissolve and leave him naked. There's no longer much of a difference. He turns away from Steve because he's always turning away from Steve and focuses instead on the body laid out on the table. Six foot, one ninety-five, possessed of the ability to light herself on fire (an astonishingly common gift) if not with the blistering power of Johnny Storm. She'd gone missing three months ago and had only turned up recently, dying but not dead, in a farm field in Iowa. The hospital had contacted the police, and the police had contacted SHIELD, and by the time Tony got to the hospital the woman was dead. Her lips had been burned off, which should have been an impossibility. And now she's laid out here, on this slab of a table, for Tony to disassemble.
BIRCH: You're right, I don't mean to slight Ms. Van Dyne. You don't seem to get into quite at much trouble with her as you do with Captain Rogers, though.
Tony closes his eyes and absorbs the blow. There's the kid, not yet twenty, sitting on a pier, cracking into Tony's brain with a notebook that looks like it was cobbled together from dumpster parts, doing what men and women with exponentially more resources have been trying and failing to do for years.
Tony was used to being a commodity. He could handle bodily violation. But he wasn't a solely organic being; post-Extremis, the armor was a part of him in ways that were very real and literal. It integrated with him on a level that surpassed the merely cellular. When Ho Yinsen's son had hijacked Tony's body and Tony's brain, he had also hijacked the Iron Man, and the violation of that sanctity was almost more than Tony could bear.
Springfield was… in the grand scheme of a frustratingly disordered universe, it wasn't anything, certainly it wasn't big enough to merit attention from the Avengers, but that hasn't stopped the mass media from pinning the tragedy to his team. Some kids with an agenda had walked into a grocery store in Connecticut and taken the place hostage for six hours. The standoff had ended with three dead, including the one of the shooters.
He's at the edge of exhaustion where even sleep won't help. An hour and a half on his cot in the workshop after Carol left had done nothing but make him wired, jittery, unable to focus or to let go enough to relax. Friday knew better than to let him work when he hit a wall like that, though, and she had insulted and coaxed him by turns until he finally fell into the elevator and retreated to the residential floors.
At the top of the tower where the Avengers lived, there is light and shadow. More shadow now, though: Tony doesn't turn on the lights because he doesn't need the lights. He carries a hollow golden glow within; he can light up his eyes in infrared and ultraviolet. Nobody else lives here, so he can dispense with the pleasantries. Even Friday is off in her own world, although some part of Friday is always waiting, listening, making her own plans and revising her own contingencies.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the subcommittee," he says. "I know you're busy making sure the country keeps on tickin', so I'll keep my remarks brief.
Norriss, 37, started his career as a foreign correspondent in China for Fact Channel News before redefining himself as a writer and director of documentaries. He won the 2014 Ellis Visionaries Award for his film
"Boss," Friday says, low and urgent. He's blind, he's so blind, he's suddenly aware that more than the armor was taken from him: his vision is limited to two soft eyes, his knowledge to merely what he holds in his head. He can't come back from this—
"'Us'?" Steve says. "You're twice as removed as I am." He's around the next corner, crossing in front of the crumbled hole that was once an exit to the southeast conference room. "And worse, you keep calling yourselves Avengers. Like you're not twisting our legacy." The next corner—now he's ten yards from Tony. There's no door on this wall. Nine yards—eight—
At 6:03:18, Iron Man seizes Captain America by the shoulder and flings him into a helicopter. The articulation of movement is transcendent: in his arm alone, a hundred thousand processes go into simply bending Iron Man's elbow, closing his fingers, and compensating for the weight of a well-built man in tactical gear. Iron Man doesn't stagger, because Iron Man's creator long ago mastered directional force, because Iron Man doesn't budge an inch even while firing a high-density muon beam right down Captain America's gullet.
"Cybernetics? Sure. Cybernetics. Advanced prosthetics—Stark Industries has a vested interest in both prosthetics and neural interfaces. Go bigger with it, though. Go radical. Go dangerous. I'm not talking about gene therapy, although let me tell you, if I had a nickel for every time I had to fight some bad guy hopped up on the idea that he can activate his own latent mutant genes, I would have a very tall stack of nickels.
"Small job for the Director of SHIELD," Carol says neutrally. She's right; although Fury, and Hill after him, had paid attention to any number of minor affairs that later had far-reaching consequences, they both know that Tony's here on a hunch. He'd met Griffin Gogol before, but only briefly, and there was nothing about Captain Ultra's powerset that suggested he'd be easy to kidnap. A flying brick disappearing usually meant some greater power working behind the curtain: hypnosis, a doppelganger, mind-control—or a being powerful enough to overcome a superpower. It's the kind of data point that others would take as isolated while Tony built towers around that small, singular particle.
In the process of kicking the shit out of the bad guy, he put all the pieces together. What do you do if you're running out of funding? You either convince your donors of the usefulness of your project, or you push harder to get results. Or, as Tony's mother would have said: why not both?
He's willing to give her the benefit of the doubt on this one; there's something lovely about it, the idea that Happy can hear Pepper's voice despite the lack of cerebral activity, but there's a twin terribleness, too.
Scope is the ratio of anchor rode to water depth. There once was a woman named Maria Carbonell who believed this was more valuable information than any idea put forth in the field of ballistics. With smaller boats you might have a hybrid rode that was made partially of warp to save on weight, but the anchors of larger vessels were made solely of chain. You couldn't wear away at chain, you couldn't worry it until it frayed, you couldn't abrade it until it broke. No matter how much you wanted to cut the chain you were still
He does talk to Carol, who in her own way is just as lost as he would've been before the latest round of upgrades. "Why are we doing this?" she wants to know. "Logan called me today. You can't avoid dragging the mutants into it forever, and if you run him to ground, you know he'll open fire and bring every able-bodied X-Man with him. What about the people who get caught in that crossfire?"
He's unusually quiet, is Reed—not lost in thought, the way he sometimes is, but pensive, maybe. Reserved. No: sad.
He catches the kick on the meat of his forearm, grabs Steve's ankle with his opposite hand, and yanks. Cap overbalances and corrects with the kind of elastic agility that makes Olympic gymnasts look clumsy, but it's enough to prove to Tony that he might have a shot. A year ago, going up against Steve like this would've been suicide, but now, the new Tony—Tony 2.0—he's strong enough to move the mountain.
Sue's eyes are hard and clear; there's something titanic behind them, something that might resemble judgment, something that says,
. And—pay attention, Shellhead—who's to say they're wrong? What you've done, what haven't you done in the dark—
"Long enough," she says. She's backlit by the skyline, because even the kitchen in the Avengers' home had to have the best view around. The shadows render her a different kind of invisible—a black hole rather than a reflection. "I thought if I could get you alone…"
His HUD flares to life. Tony can do nothing to stop it. No matter how hard he beats his will against the confines of his body, the program keeps running.
In the current microcosm, though, he's still a work-in-progress—"art is never finished, only abandoned" is a motto Tony lives by, and if his art is a weapon, at least he's in good company. He'll never make anything else as gorgeous as the Iron Man, and he'll do what he has to do to make sure the flesh and blood inside the suit are able to keep pace. In the meantime, though, he's still a work-in-progress. He still needs to sleep. He slips off while he's thinking of things to tell Steve, between one breath and the next, and for the first time in days, his dreams are safe and untroubled. It might be luck that all's right with the world. Tony prefers to think that it's good engineering.
"What did you think would happen?" Steve asks. "Did you think that someday you'd confess and be forgiven? That I'd been in love with you all along and too cowardly to admit it?"
realization that only hits that hard in a very rich, very powerful man who thought he would continue to be very rich and very powerful until the day he died. That's the realization in Boynton's eyes: that he is powerful but not unassailably powerful, that he can't cheat his way out of everything. Tony has been in rooms with mirrors before. He knows that cast of features.
The singularity of Tony's life is that he can finally make that atonement absolute. The thought isn't one he lets sit on the surface of his consciousness, but it's there and it drives him—that for the sin of being human, Extremis lets him make reparations. Test-pilot for the future. Someday he'll test-pilot them right into a world without sin.
When they met ten years ago, this was not how Tony imagined their working relationship going. He could fathom Captain America's disregard, Captain America's contempt, maybe—if he was very good, and worked very hard—maybe even Captain America's respect; in those early days, he had discovered in Steve a devotion to building something
Tony swings his feet over the side of the bed and flinches when the soles of his feet touch the bare floor. He withdraws, recalculates, and gingerly lowers them again. The strangest part of this is how little he hurts; it's all smoothed over, regrown, not really even worth mentioning. Like it didn't even happen. Like Tony didn't cut part of his foot off. If he weren't so tired, he would be enthralled by the suggestion he could remake himself into something perfect. Pain may be the only currency the universe understands, but everyone knows Tony Stark is richer than god.
"No, but I think you know things about how Rogers and his group operate that you aren't sharing. Maybe it's time someone asked you why the hell you're doing this."
Tony isn't a neurologist, a bio-engineer, he isn't Maya Hansen. He's loathe to admit how little he knows about what Extremis did to him, but the truth is that there isn't any shame in admitting what you don't know. That's what people tell him. Tony can admit when he's wrong, but he can't admit that he's wrong without a thick cloud of shame fogging his head. He doesn't know exactly how Extremis restructured him. He doesn't know how his brain works. He doesn't know how to get out of his own head; so it's a miracle that he manages to aggregate enough information to reach out through a satellite and divert the warheads to disperse their payloads harmlessly into space. The last thing he remembers is being hit by a wall of force. It feels like a star exploding.
"Well." The corner of Steve's mouth quirks; Tony can read the expression just from the tone of Steve's voice, but he glances over anyway. "The assignment might have included some covert intelligence gathering."
"Sir," his aide says. "Captain Rogers was assassinated on the steps of a courthouse ten minutes ago."
This is the exact moment when it all breaks down. This is the instant in which Tony Stark understands there may be nothing left to repair, that he cannot win through aftermath damage control, that he cannot have his way and salvage the wreckage later. This is not salvageable. There's no saving it.
"What's up?" Tony says. He's about eight minutes outside of New York airspace, headed south down the coast to D.C. again. It's dusk: late summer, clear skies. Even New Jersey looks gorgeous.
"You can't blame yourself, Steve. That might be true, but we have no way of knowing, and you know how much I hate saying it, but—maybe he was right. He sees things that other people don't."
"Don't waste our time with platitudes. I already have." Tony recognizes that beatific look she's wearing. She's saving them all from human weakness. Maya Hansen 3.0—unfettered and unchained, cutting a ruthless line from what is to what will be. "And do you want to know the best part, Tony?" She leans a little closer. "All those test subjects? I found them through
Lila darts off to study the blueprints laid across one of his drafting tables; he usually works with CAD now, or his own version of it, the sophisticated holographic modelling that Pepper keeps telling him would make millions on the open market, but the blueprints are for a community center being funded by the Maria Stark Foundation, and they aren't Tony's. The design had come from the architecture firm donating their time to the project. Tony could draft a high-rise if he had to, but occasionally people like to force him to delegate.
They offer him SHIELD again, and he refuses. They offer him a division, and he agrees. He's given the title of deputy director, technically reporting to Hill but able to override her orders in matters pertaining to his jurisdiction. The truce between them is uneasy but fruitful. They both do what needs to be done.
"...Huh," Tony says. He picks it up. It's just an object; about three ounces, four-point-two inch display, the best resolution and hardware on the market for the price. Killer battery life. That's why people buy StarkPhones—the design is sick, sleek, sexy, durable all at once, but what people are really paying for is the battery life. Tony's all about building a better battery.
"My records indicate you were… sleeping," Friday says. "But boss, you're the only one who can override my records."
Tony answers by typing into his phone so he doesn't give someone the right impression that he's crazy. DON'T HAVE ONE.
"Yes," Steve repeats, rolling the sound around in his mouth as he savors his satisfaction. "Yes. That's right. But instead you're here. Is this what you deserve?"
Steve, uncharacteristically, hesitates. Maybe there's too much going on inside his head for him to express, too.
no matter how small or ordinary their contributions seemed. They didn't neglect the practical, but there was a kind of ideological grace behind those discussions that now strikes Tony as impossibly naive.
how to scrub the insides of his skin raw and then pack the bleeding cavity so tightly no one would suspect that he's empty; it's innate. He was born with a pit inside of him. Sometimes the pit makes him hungry. Sometimes it just makes him hollow. Small wonder that he tried to replace all the missing pieces with clockwork replicas.
"It isn't that easy for me." The cutter's heavy in his hand. He tells Steve, "It isn't that easy for me. You're going to have to hold me down."
He faces the window, and Steve comes up beside them; Tony can see him reflected in the glass. Now that they're here, he doesn't know how to begin. There's no way he can explain what's happening without revealing himself as a monster, and that's fine, but he's also a monster with a purpose; locking him up isn't going to solve this problem, not when the armor's unibeam has an explosive yield more than adequate to blast a hole in a supermax prison, and sedating him might only make it easier for Yinsen's son to crack open Tony's head.
. He just wants to close his eyes. "And…" Oh. God, of course. "You want to learn how to replicate their powers."
STARK: Regrettably, that's probably at least a few years away. I might have jumped the gun a little bit. Not something I'm known for, I know. We need more testing before we're sure that it's safe for use on humans, and like I said, the delivery method needs to be tweaked.
He improved the cybernetic link, enhanced the limited onboard AI to a true, full sentience, but when desperation and opportunity had brought him to Extremis, he had discarded the thirdfi-party interface entirely. Extremis wasn't nanites in his blood, it wasn't a cybernetic relay that translated between his brain and machinery; Extremis was an enhancile that hacked his body's repair center to manually restructure his body and brain. He could think faster, move faster, send and receive wireless signals, rewrite his own software when the old code wouldn't do.
He hangs up without offering Tony time enough to compose a rebuttal. Maybe Tony did ask for it; maybe he's been asking for it all along. Steve always said that Tony was awful at looking out for himself.
On a personal note, I can only write in utmost support of Registration, or rather in support of the programs that have been passed alongside it. Had I been allowed to register my identity and received the care and support that are provided to those entered into the registry, countless lives might have been saved. Early detection is crucial, particularly in treatable cases like mine. I have hope that fair enforcement of Registration, and vigilance and compassion on the part of its administrators, will avert a great deal of further suffering.
SR: I follow that far. Doesn't explain why you've been thinking about it, though. I've never known you to waste time unless something big was on your mind.
BOWMAN: I don't see why I shouldn't take advantage of how small their imaginations are. We're going to be criminals anyway. I have no problem fleecing the government out of millions of dollars.
"Did I not just lecture you all about wasting time?" Tony says. "Supervillain break-out, highly-populated area, did everyone miss that?"
"You're running scared," Cap says. "You might think you've got a handle on everything, but it all really comes down to what
"Is that supposed to hurt me?" She settles back on her haunches. "Let me lay it out for you, since apparently you're too impaired to figure it out yourself." She knocks the back of her hand against the gold cuff that sits like a tourniquet around his ankle and says, "I cut a deal with the DOD, and they gave me a lot of money and very little oversight, and I exploited the opportunity with extreme prejudice. And you know what I made, Tony? Do you know what I built with my own two hands?"
"I have a few tricks of my own." He lets the underarmor leach out of his skin; even shutting the armor down can't cut him off from the nano-fluid stored in his bones. It's based on a redesign of some old contracting work he did with Askew-Tronics back when this kid was still in diapers; the original product was susceptible to control by hostile A.I., but Tony's made some upgrades. If it won't stop a projectile—and it should—then the healing factor he wrote into himself with Extremis will take care of any subsequent damage. "And I don't think your program's all that sophisticated," he continues. "Don't get me wrong, you've still managed to outperform most of the global brain trust, but you can do one thing and one thing only. If you were capable of making me dance like a puppet, Gorlovich would already be a smear on the pavement."
