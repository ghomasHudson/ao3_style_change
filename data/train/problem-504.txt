“Is it? That sure is an interesting name. You might want to go to the administration office and let them know they got your name wrong. My files say your name is William.” Mr Watson said and Sherlock sighed, thanks mum. She could have at the very least given them his preferred name rather than his actual first name.
“I’m not spying on you, if that’s what you’re suggesting, I only wanted to check who’s outside.” His mother said and grinned widely at the sight of Janine. “And you brought a friend!” she went on excitedly.
“Right.” Sherlock said and had to smirk, remembering that. That had been somewhat fun.
“Well.. that’s what Janine and I did up here. She gave me her brothers old school jacket, because it’s got longer sleeves and she fitted it for me. She’s a demon with needle and thread.” Sherlock said and smiled, looking down at himself.
“Yesterday, you’ve been way too late and not dressed appropriately and today you’re here before anyone else in full uniform.” Mr Watson said with a smile as he unlocked the door, “Well.. apart from the tie. But I’m going to pretend I didn’t notice that, those things are hideous anyway.”
“How much did you guys drink?”
»Do I know you?« he asked, sucking at his cigarette again and blinking stupidly at the girl when she pulled the cigarette out of his mouth and took a drag herself, smearing her dark red lipstick onto the cork tip and making Sherlock's nose scrunch up in disgust at the prospect of having that on his lips.
Sherlock who was still a little overcharged with the whole situation decided to maybe give this whole studying thing an actual go and looked down at the book as well. It was boring, but at least insects and their use for nature was not all that bad. And just maybe… the same went for Mr Watson.
»Sorry...?« he asked dizzily with a delay and shook his head, literally trying to shake off his thoughts as Mr Watson gave an unnerved sigh and right now, there weren't even gasps, it had become deadly silent.
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes!" Mummy called and Sherlock sighed in annoyance as he heard footsteps on the stairs which were coming too fast too close to his door until Mummy eventually entered the room. "Move your bum out of the bed and get dressed. You don't want to be late on your first day, do you?"
»I had actually hoped ... we'd... go for dinner...« Sherlock replied, his voice a bit shaky and weak. He frowned, was that what it was like to be - heart broken? Well, whatever it was, Sherlock hated to feel like this. And he hated that stupid woman, who'd go out with the blonde tonight. He was jealous. He had been before, slightly. But this was worse.
While Sherlock walked through the doors of his new school, he was already able to tell that this school would be like all those Sherlock had read about only by looking at his dull schoolmates that were flooding the hall. Giggling girls, boys that tried to look cool, leaning casually against the lockers, all grouped in different cliques, but when one looked closely, they were all just the same. Just like the boring teachers which strolled occasionally through the crowd, looking all but motivated. Oh this was going to be torture, days full of dull people saying stupid things and Sherlock was forced to keep his mouth shut.
“That is.. young.” Sherlock agreed and looked back at Mr Watson.
They had exchanged phone numbers too, though they weren’t really texting or calling each other, it was just in case he’d get in some worse trouble with his peers and need some faculty backup ‘coincidentally’ strolling by as the man had phrased it. At some point, Mr Watson had even went as far as allowing him to call him John when they weren’t in class. And slow but steady, they had become genuine friends, which raised his friends count to two.
“Phew.. Thanks Mr Watson.. always knew you’re a catch..” she said and Sherlock bit back a giggle. He really did need to send John a text about pretending he didn’t remember anything about tonight to save her dignity.
“Is it really that bad?” Sherlock asked and nipped at his own glass. “Ew.. yeah.. okay. It is.” he said with a laugh. “Maybe we should order something else.”
to herself as she went back into the kitchen.
Sighing, John flopped back onto the soft covers of his bed and closed his eyes. Mentally repeating his date's name like a mantra. Sarah. She wasn't so sexy after all if he thought about it. Granted, she was pretty, but her mind? She was a strong women, clever, but not really – he sighed again – not as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes.
-look as she watched him absently stirring his cereals.
There we go :D I'm still not super happy with the chapter but it gave me a massive writing block for some reason and I kept editing it and yeah, it's never gonna get better than this, may as well stop trying and move on :D So, I really do hope that the next chapter comes easier (and faster) :)
About an hour (and an interview with his mum about where they were going) later, Sherlock and Janine exited the cab in front of a pub that looked very much like the two of them were majorly overdressed – if the amounts of people going in and out of the building wearing variations of sweatshirts and jeans were anything to go by.
»I'm not a virgin, I'm just gay!«
“Would you stop?”
“I did. And the only reason you’re not yet grounded is that you’ve just found a friend and I’m not about to ground you and keep you from meeting up with her.”
quite cute and certainly nicer to look at than most other teachers.” Janine said and then got back to reading for good.
.« Mr Watson mused, visibly satisfied with himself, but still far from smiling . »Sit then.« the man said and Sherlock obeyed, strolling sheepishly through the class and over to what was seemingly his seat for now. » Oh and Holmes, the next time I see you, you
Shaking his head, he rushed to the next lesson, since at least in class nobody would bother him.
With a sigh, Sherlock lifted his head, scrunching up his nose, "I love you, Mum." he said reluctantly and stood up, grabbing his bag which he had placed next to his chair, watching from the corner of his eye how his Dad put his papers down,
“I’m not even sure if I am..” Sherlock said and shrugged, “Gay, I mean.”
“Take it from a professional, if Irene’s flirt attempts worked on you like a cold shower, but you’re pretty much drooling over Mr Watson and yeah you were, don’t even try to deny, I have eyes, my dear friend.” Janine said and chuckled, “You’re definitely gay.”
Instead of an answer, Sherlock walked into the room, closing the door behind him, blocking out the light from the landing.
His mother chuckled, "You do what?"
Doing as he was – more or less – told, Sherlock sighed, chewing a mouthful of cereals. Girls weren't even his area. Not that he would have had an actual area when it came to this, but he knew for a fact that he was naturally preferring boys. Women just didn't interest him in general, they were just there, while there – he had to admit – have been boys he had considered somewhat good-looking, but that was all. He had never been interested in anyone and that was good.
Carefully entering him from behind, he slung one arm around the lean man's waist, slowly beginning to work his length gently in and out of Sherlock, resting his head against his back and groaning along with the other man as, quickly building up a fast pace, while he stroked Sherlock in the rhythm of his thrusts. He gripped Sherlock's shoulder with his other hand for support, slightly scratching the soft skin as he felt a sensation arising from his loin and spreading across his whole body. He softly kissed Sherlock's neck, his heart almost burning through his chest with love for the man in front of him.
“But you can still quote it..” she teased. “Nerd.” She chuckled again as she picked up her coat and bag. “Anyway, though, I gotta go home. Oh and don’t forget the bet.” She chuckled as they started to walk downstairs and he walked her to the door.
»Oooh, we have a shy one here...« Irene purred, again stepping closer.
“I mean.. kinda, I guess. Compared to the majority of people, I suppose we are somewhat rich.” Sherlock said uncomfortably and wondered if that’d change her opinion of him. He himself didn’t like rich people as they tended to be arseholes 89,75% of the time. He had actually done the statistics based on Mycroft’s posh friends.
I'm back! Gotta stick to my pinky promises even if it takes ... five years.. oh boy. Super sorry for the long hiatus :3 But here is the first update of many more to come :) I'm slow but steady getting back into writing full stories, rather than just rping, which also means that my writing style's gotta adapt to that, I'm really sorry if this isn't detailed enough, but I hope I'll get there again :) and as always please let me know what you think :)
“Yeah, you did and I am still doubting your sanity over that.” Sherlock teased, making Janine giggle.
Oh, and for all you people who dislike Irene, as far as I can tell at the moment she isn't going to play a major part in the story, although I'm making no promises on that as I don't know myself yet where the story will go. Nonetheless, two things are set in stone for me:
»Sherlock?!« Blinking against the light and covering his eyes, John rolled on his side to look into the direction that familiar voice came from. »What for heaven's sake are you doing in here?«
“Don’t be such a spoilsport, it’s going to be fun.” She said and was genuinely excited, so much so that it was a little contagious and Sherlock started to become somewhat giddy as well, despite still feeling the urge to open a window and turning the music down a notch. “So what do you want to drink?“
“I’ll take her to the loo and you call a cab?” Sherlock asked and John nodded.
“Hey, I’m a little out there, but even I wouldn’t share my boyfriends,” Janine said and laughed again. “You know what I mean.”
His friendship with Janine had blossomed as well and they were pretty much spending every afternoon together. Janine had made it her mission – apart from polishing up his social skills – to also educate Sherlock on movies and TV shows, which they had watched in abundance when they hadn’t been busy studying chemistry together (Janine had actually aced their last exam, which had been her first A in chemistry ever), going out shopping or just simply sitting there, discussing guys (the theory that he was gay wasn’t as much of a theory anymore anyway) or the stupidity of the people in school.
2. Happy ends ♥
, I'm gay." he said and his mother just stared at him as Sherlock walked back up the stairs without another word, fleeing that horrendous scene. He couldn’t believe Janine had been right about this or that he had now for the second time in one day unintentionally told someone (
Spitting onto his fingers eventually, John slowly slipped his hand between Sherlock's well formed cheeks, using the mixture of saliva and precum as some sort of substitution for lubricant as he experimentally stroked his fingertips over Sherlock's entrance, hearing the man beneath him gasp fondly, which strengthened his courage. Taking a deep breath, John swallowed and circled the ring of muscles a few times, before pushing one finger in, letting the tight muscle adjust to the intrusion and luxuriating in Sherlock's sounds once again.
“Are you just going to stand there? Or do you want to come in and sit down?” Mr Watson asked, still in that amused manner. “That is unless you were planning to head out for a cigarette before class?” he asked and while Sherlock had been considering to do that, actually (he was impressed Mr Watson had caught that in the first place), he shook his head.
When John awoke in the morning, he had expected to still feel Sherlock's arms comforting around him, just like they had been when they fell asleep that night – but they weren't. Can't have everything, huh? He'd been lucky enough with what happened. Though it was still hard to believe it really
"Ouch." Mr Holmes deadpanned and Sherlock couldn't help but chuckle at his expression.
"Oh, Sher, you don't have to be shy." Mummy said and sat down on the edge of Sherlock's bed, stroking his tousled curls, straightening them a bit.
After a few moments of thrusting and withdrawing with one finger, John added a second, repeating his actions from before – adjusting and thrusting – before he gently scissored his fingers, feeling Sherlock loosen up perceptibly. Just to make sure, he was opened up enough, John added another finger after a moment, figuring Sherlock was ready when three fingers slipped in and out almost without resistance, still he went on, slowly sliding in and out with his fingers.
“Interesting choice. Though, I’d have thought you’d go with a dress,” Sherlock said, noticing that it was definitely too short to be a dress.
“Excuse me, sir?” Anderson complained utterly startled now and the smirk wiped off his face.
“You were really quick to assume Janine and I were making out for someone who thought I was gay.” Sherlock with a raised brow, picking up one of the cookies and nibbling at it.
“You totally are. Okay, for now we’ll just run with the theory that you’re not gay, but most likely gay.” Janine said and Sherlock raised a brow.
»Hell, Sherlock!«, he yelled still drugged with sleep, opening his eyes a little to peek at his alarm clock. 2 AM. Great. It took a few moments, but then the music cut off and he heard the door close downstairs.
“You sure this is the place you meant to go?” Sherlock asked sceptically, looking at Janine, who just grinned.
“Well, honestly, if you had simply told me that making friends would keep me from getting grounded, I’d have done that ages ago.”
"Why do you even still have that thing?" Sherlock asked with a raised brow, obviously giving up on the former subject and pointing with his spoon at the cup.
»Just trust me, John...«
“That is so cool.” Janine said and laughed again, “I mean.. don’t get me wrong, I would have also liked you if you weren’t.. but it’s just that little bit more cool. I’ve never met a rich kid that’s not a douche.”
“Alright, alright.” His mother said and chuckled, “But.. just know that it’s all fine, alright? Your dad and I don’t mind, so whoever you bring home is absolutely fine, dear. And if you don’t bring anyone, that’s fine too, it’s your choice.” She said and Sherlock reluctantly smiled.
Walking through the corridor, Sherlock headed for the backdoor he had found this morning as he was looking for a spot to smoke, passing it and making his way over the back of the gym, where a bunch of large trees were standing, the ground covered in cigarette butts, letting Sherlock know that he wasn't the first one finding this spot useful.
“Well.. it’s a work in progress.” Sherlock said and shrugged, failure in progress was probably a better way to put it, but he didn’t want to worry his mother … or make her reconsider putting him on that school, if he was entirely honest.
“Why at my place?” Sherlock asked, wondering if she thought her parents would disapprove of their friendship – or whatever this was.
»What?« he sighed, his voice dripping with disinterest as he lit up his cigarette, this time making sure to hold it a little away from that Irene woman.
After a few moments, John let the massage fade out and turned Sherlock around so the detective was backing him. He felt the strong urge to feel him closer, to be inside of him, so John got on his knees, pulling Sherlock up with him and hesitating a moment. He as a doctor had had to care about men who did precisely this the wrong way.
“How much did you guys drink?” John asked, looking at Sherlock now.
She smiled, looking at the cup, "Because my very beloved son made it for me and because he's become rather sparingly with expressing such sentiment towards others."
, pleasure to meet you, Holmes. But you know what I'm wondering...« she babbled on and Sherlock pulled another cigarette out, certainly not going for the other one again.
Sherlock laughed again, rolling his eyes, though he did so somewhat fondly this time. “Well.. it’s not the worst theory I guess.. I know that I do prefer males for a fact, but that’s not what I meant when I said I’m not sure. I’m just not sure if I’m interested in the whole dating scheme in the first place.”
“The same one?” Sherlock asked jokingly and smirked as she rolled her eyes.
on point.” He said and handed them their drinks and directing his smile to Sherlock mostly.
"You're nervous, I take it?" Mummy asked with a knowing smile and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
♥ as her John from our RP is very, very likely going to influence mine :)
"Have a nice day, dear!" he heard his Mum call right before he closed the door and started to walk, the school was only five minutes away. His flat at Baker Street was half an hour away by foot, which meant that he whether had to cycle to school or he'd take a cab every morning – of course he could as well get up earlier, but he didn't want to. So cab it was, then.
John:
“You’re the best friend ever, by the way, did I already tell you that?” Janine asked with a grin and instantly grabbed the menu from the table.
“I’m not carrying my passport around with me.” She complained and Sherlock smiled, pulling out his phone, where he had photos of both his and Janine’s ID (from when they had been discussing whose picture looked worse). He had figured back then those might come in handy eventually.
Okay so personally, I'm not the biggest fan of this chapter, but whatever I tried, the awkwardness just wouldn't go away soo.. yeah :D Maybe it's just naturally there talking to a teacher when you're a student :D
“Well.. thanks, I guess..” John said, still holding her arm to make sure she wouldn’t fall over.
“Oh boy.” Janine said and chuckled, “Yeah, we need to do something about that. My big brother used to go here, you know.. pretty sure he’s still got his uniform.. I mean.. he’s like.. erm.. not that he’s fat.. but.. he’s .. a little bit fat. Don’t tell him I said that.”
Irene giggled lowly, »Oh, don't be like that. I know you were enjoying it... and well, there's a much better show I could put on for you...« she murmured, walking a step closer to Sherlock and placing her hand on his upper arm.
On the whole, Sherlock looked ridiculous, wearing it, even if Mummy thought it was
Sentiment just wasn't something he was too eager to deal with, let alone with sexuality, yet if he had to make a guess, he'd say, he was asexual.
What he knew, though was that from now on, he'd need another place to go for a smoke, preferably far, far away from this whole bloody building and everybody it contained.
“Not what I mean..” Janine said and reached for some toilet paper to wipe her mouth, “Did I say to Mr Watson that he’s a catch?” she asked and Sherlock snorted.
“You’re such a nerd, I love it.”
"I wouldn't mind to hear that more often as well." she said on purpose loud enough for Sherlock to hear and chuckled which Sherlock only answered with a roll of his eyes.
my first name. Sherlock Holmes.”
“You can leave that here.” Sherlock said and his mother smirked.
“I actually had that suspicion about you for a while.”
“You think everyone heard that, or should we go back home and print some flyers to hand out to the crowd?”
When they entered the pub a wave of sensory overload rolled over them, the music (if you could call it that) blasted out of the speakers, people were shouting over it to understand each other – which honestly could have been solved so easily, if they’d just think, but apparently shouting was the generally approved solution. Adding to that was the cocktail of smells that hit them in the face, which seemed to be a mixture of stale air, sweat, alcohol and various deodorants.
Later that evening, when the birthday proceedings (which in his family meant cake and a bunch of calls from relatives which Sherlock had to reluctantly answer) were over, Sherlock and Janine went upstairs, where she instantly began the evening preparations, unloading the contents of her bag on his bed.
John's eyes narrowed at the response, but he smiled nonetheless. Behind them, Mycroft called for Sherlock, signaling that it was time to leave.
John dropped to his knees behind Sherlock, mouthing along his thighs. He reached around to grip Sherlock's cock, giving it a few long, slow pulls.
“Not yet. Need you inside me,” Sherlock said as he shook his head and reached down, gripping the base of his cock. “I’m ready.”
John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead as he pulled his hips back. His cock nearly slipped out of Sherlock’s arse before he pushed back in, letting out a shaky breath.
Sherlock followed, but stood in front of John rather than leaving. “I didn't actually come here for a volunteer position,” he said, stepping into the Father’s space.
“No, ‘s perfect,” Sherlock replied, softly smiling up at John.
John nodded and leaned in, pressing a light kiss to Sherlock’s temple. “Just rest for now.”
He watched as John followed, and soon he was looming over Sherlock, kissing the spot just beneath his jaw, and down to his collarbone. He moved further, swirling his tongue around one of Sherlock's nipples, then the other. Sherlock moaned, threading his fingers through John's hair. Soon, John's teeth were nipping gently at Sherlock's belly, then his hipbones which jutted out just above his waistband.
“I Probably should have texted you. I wanted to wait until everyone was asleep to leave. Sorry about that,” Sherlock apologized as John shut the door behind them.
“I think you’ll need something a bit bigger,” John added, joining in Sherlock's laughter. After he took a moment to catch his breath, he rose from the bed.
Sherlock hissed through his teeth, a small drop of precome falling from his cock onto John’s lap. His hips rocked forward, seeking any sort of friction. He peered down, seeing the line of John's hardened cock through his trousers. Reaching down, he rubbed it with his palm, and John hummed.
Sherlock tipped his head back, whimpering at the sensations. “Please, Father.”
John nodded stiffly, rubbing the back of his neck. “We always have something or another. I didn't know you were interested,” he said, looking to Sherlock.
“Can I suck it?” Sherlock asked, licking his lips.
Pulling the pillow out from beneath his hips, Sherlock collapsed onto the mattress. After returning to his senses, he frowned at the stained pillow cover before stripping it off and pushing it beneath the bed.
John's tongue circled Sherlock's hole a few times before gently prodding against it. “Relax a bit,” he instructed.
Sherlock moaned, rolling his hips forward. His wrist bumped something hung on the wall, and he heard it clatter on the ground. John pulled away from his neck, and Sherlock looked down, realizing he'd accidentally knocked a wooden cross off John's wall. He opened his mouth to apologize, but John leaned back in, mouthing over his neck.
He wondered what it would feel like to have Father John's hand slide down from his shoulder to his arse. How firm would he grip it? Would he pull Sherlock in and kiss his neck, or bite at it just to leave a mark?
Sherlock winced as John's cock spurted into his mouth. The taste was bitter and overwhelmingly salty, but he swallowed every drop nevertheless. His hand sped up around his own cock, and before long he was thrown over the edge as well, coming into his fist.
John sent another text with his address, and suddenly whatever it was between them felt more concrete. Any hope he had of gaining the self control to turn Sherlock away dissipated.
,” Sherlock begged.
“This wasn't a mistake,” Sherlock assured as he scooped his clothes off the floor and began redressing.
John rubbed circles over Sherlock's hole with his thumb, massaging the tight muscle.

“Perfect,” Sherlock answered.
“The body of Christ,” John said, offering a thin wafer.
John nodded. “I'll go slow, yeah?”
Sherlock wiggled in his seat for the millionth time that morning. His suit felt stiff; he refused to understand why it was necessary. Mycroft discreetly nudged him with his elbow, and Sherlock rolled his eyes. He could think of nothing more mind-numbing than sitting through an hour of the exact same worship routine he had to endure on a weekly basis.
minute late, which Sherlock suspected his mother blamed him for. In reality, it was her that had spent an eternity nitpicking his outfit before they left the house. She insisted that he wear his finest suit in order to look 'presentable' for church.
John nodded and licked his lips. “Well, you seem much more interested in the Word lately.”
fine,” he answered, feigning an innocent smile.
is what a clerical shirt looks like.
That night, Sherlock stared down at a blank document on his laptop, cursing himself for being distracted. All he had to do was complete a lab write-up. Yet every time he tried to focus on it- or anything, really- Father John would reappear in his mind. The memory of his warm palm on Sherlock's shoulder, the way he seemed to always lick his lips, and God the black and white collar he wore around his neck. He fantasized about pulling it off and sucking on the skin beneath.
After they both caught their breath, Sherlock stood. He grabbed a tissue from John's desk and wiped the come off his hand.
As Sherlock approached, he straightened his posture and ran his fingers through his hair.
He felt John’s hand sliding to the base of his cock, before his warm, wet tongue circled the glans. Sherlock inhaled sharply, his hands fitting in the bed sheets.
“I’m gonna come,” Sherlock cried, biting his lip.
Sherlock's hand twisted up as he leaned forward, flicking his tongue against the glans of John's cock. The Father groaned, and his hands gripped the chair's arms tight enough to turn his knuckles white.
caring about a religion. “I thought I could ask Father John what jobs are open.”
“It's alright- I did,” Sherlock informed as he pulled the bottle of lube and condom from his pocket.
“I mean,” Sherlock began, smoothing his hand down John's side, “I want to go all the way.”
Sherlock obeyed without a word, more than ready to let John take charge. Pushing the chair he'd been sitting in aside, he unfastened his trousers, letting them and his pants pool around his ankles before he leaned over the desk, resting on his elbows.
Soon, John was easing Sherlock backward until his back met with the wall, and their kiss became more heated. John took Sherlock's wrists in his hand, pressing them against the wall above Sherlock's head as he trailed his kisses down Sherlock's neck.
Sherlock peered behind himself, and noticed John palming his cock through his trousers. “Please,” he whimpered, pushing his arse back into John's hand.
For Sherlock, the only bright side of Sunday mornings was getting to watch the priest, Father John. From nearly the moment Sherlock reached the age of 18, he hadn't been able to turn his mind away from him. Perhaps it was his dominant yet kind demeanor that attracted Sherlock initially, or perhaps it was the fact that he was unattainable. John, like any other priest, was required to abstain from any sexual or romantic relationships in order to concentrate on his priestly duties. It frustrated Sherlock to no end.
As Sherlock walked away, John was certain he'd seen Sherlock’s brother shooting them an odd glance.
Sherlock collapsed, limp against the mattress as John continued thrusting his hips. Soon, he was pulling out of Sherlock’s hole and stripping the condom off. He gripped his cock firmly and began stroking it quickly. A loud groan filled the room as his come splattered over Sherlock’s abdomen. Much of it landed on the come that already pooled on his stomach, and some went as high as Sherlock’s chest. He stayed above Sherlock for a minute as his body worked through the aftershocks of his orgasm, then he collapsed on the mattress by Sherlock’s side, panting heavily.
Before he knew it, the Father was placing a hand on Sherlock's waist, pulling him forward into a kiss. It was rough and quick, and Sherlock moaned into it, relaxing against him. John pulled Sherlock's lower lip between his teeth as his free hand gripped his arse firmly.
Sherlock devises a plan to seduce Father John.
With a twist of John’s hand, Sherlock’s fingers dug into John’s back, letting out a sob as his orgasm washed over him. He could feel it everywhere in his body at once while his come spurted across his stomach, some of it landing on John’s sheets.
Just for a reference,
John obliged, his hand circling around the base of Sherlock’s cock.
John cleared his throat. “Right.”
When John’s cock was fully seated inside, he stilled his hips and pulled his head back to look at Sherlock. “Are you hurting at all?” he asked, an acute look of concern written across his features. His hand moved up to Sherlock’s head, brushing his damp curls away from his forehead.
Sherlock's mom placed a hand on her chest, a warm smile on her lips, and she thanked him. “We were wondering if you had any volunteer jobs open that Sherlock could take.”
John frowned at the response. “Maybe you should come back at a better time.”
“Hm, yes,” Sherlock agreed, his eyes still focusing on John's form.
“Well, I'll be here in my office tomorrow from three to eight. If you want to stop in, we can go over the available jobs.”
“Yes, brother mine. You could ruin a good man’s career and hurt yourself in the process.”
“That's good, so good. Touch yourself,” John instructed.
John pulled away, then stilled, and Sherlock could see his pupils dilate. “Are you sure?” he asked. “I mean- I didn't come prepared.”
“I should go,” Sherlock said, once he looked presentable enough to leave.
Small warning for John being a bit reluctant because of his religion. However, everything that happens is consensual.
“If you're going to say he isn't interested, you should really work on your deductions. Goodnight, Sherlock.”
Then, at the thought of John’s cock slowly sliding into him, he came on his pillow with a muffled cry.
“Oh, Sherlock, I didn't think you would make it this morning, you weren't here before Mass," John noted, as Sherlock's family typically arrived early to mingle with the other members of the church.
“You have my number.”
let go. It has been eleven years since John was last with someone sexually. He couldn't forget what a massive relief it had been, and he didn't know how he could return to living a chaste life.
John licked his lips, nodding. “Right. If you're sure.”
John blinked rapidly, quickly scanning the area to make sure no one was close enough to hear.
Sherlock paused, shaking his head. “Not before today.”
John received a reply almost immediately.
They continued kissing for a long moment before one of Father John's knees slotted between Sherlock's thighs, allowing Sherlock to grind down against his leg. John pulled away from Sherlock's mouth, kissing a line down his jaw and his neck, where he nipped and sucked on the sensitive skin of Sherlock's throat.
. “I should be off,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck.
John groaned, recapturing Sherlock's lips with more desire and passion than before.
With his free hand, John went back to work on Sherlock's cock, stroking it steadily. The dual sensations caused his thighs to tremble, his soft moans filling the room.
He should have known not to look to Sherlock or his family during Mass, and he decided to refrain from doing so again. However, Sherlock took part in the Eucharist as always, and when it was his turn, he winked as John placed the thin wafer on his tongue, and kept his eyes on him as he drank from the wine cup. It made it nearly impossible to focus for the rest of the service.
“Mmh- yes,” Sherlock answered, feeling breathless. “But only two fingers.”
He didn't care what Mycroft thought, nor would he take his advice. Getting ‘involved’ is exactly what he would do.
,” John swore, his eyes glued to Sherlock’s pulsing cock.
“Yes,
John's head dipped down, kissing along Sherlock's thighs and down to his arse, where he licked a broad stripe over Sherlock's hole. It was much more pleasant than the first time, considering the fact that he wasn't bent over a hard desk. Throwing an arm over his eyes, Sherlock moaned, his hips rising off the mattress.
John's tongue drew a path down Sherlock's cock. His hands pulled up on the backs of Sherlock's knees. Sherlock took the hint, setting his feet flat on the bed.
Even through his guilt, John found that his mind often wandered back to Sherlock and to how good it felt to
Taking a deep breath, he knocked on the door. He could hear the Father calling, “Come in.”
“Er, did you want something to dr-” John began, but Sherlock cut him off as he moved forward and placed a hand on John's jaw to pull him in and gently press their lips together. It wasn't long until John responded, taking control of the kiss. They moved together easily, Sherlock's plump lower lip sliding between John's thin lips.
Taking in a breath, he greeted the congregation and began the Penitential Rite as routine.
When Mass came to a conclusion, Sherlock's mother turned to him. “Why don't we go talk to Father John about that volunteer job?” she asked before rising from the pew and leading Sherlock to the front of the room where John stood.
John returned shortly, a damp cloth in hand. He knelt on the bed by Sherlock’s side, dragging the cloth, which Sherlock found to be pleasantly warm, across the mess of come. After John finished cleaning up, he fetched a clean duvet and draped it over Sherlock. He rejoined him on the bed, relaxing by his side. “You can stay the night,” he offered, running his fingers through Sherlock’s curls.
It wasn't until Thursday night that Sherlock received a text:
John tensed, letting out a shaky breath. He lifted his head, his eyes flicking between Sherlock's chest and lips.
The complement caught Sherlock off guard, distracted by the warmth of John's palm. A small, “Oh?” was all he could manage in the moment.
John shifted in his seat. “Right.. the jobs, then.” He opened a drawer on his desk and pulled out a large folder likely filled with openings and applications.
For days after becoming intimate with Sherlock, the guilt John felt was nearly unbearable. His regret distracted him from his prayers, and the fear of being exposed kept him up at night. He could lose everything he worked for because of one mistake. The church would shame him, and Sherlock would likely feel the repercussions as well. He wished he could take it back, or forget about it and move on.
want this,” he said, sliding his hand down the front of John's trousers, palming over John's erection.
Sherlock nodded eagerly. Feeling a third finger press into him was a relief even though there was a slight burn resulting from the stretch. John’s fingers curled upward, gently rubbing against the Sherlock’s walls. Soon, John’s fingertips brushed against his prostate, and he gasped, his head lifting off the mattress.
Sherlock felt John's hands sliding down his sides and to his arse, pulling their hips closer together. Sherlock placed a hand on John's chest, pressing back until he was flat on the bed. He rolled his hips down, grinding against John's cock.
“Sorry, is something wrong?” John asked when he looked back to Sherlock.
,” Sherlock moaned as John’s hand pumped his cock in time with his thrusts. His moans echoed throughout the room as John began to speed up, his thrusts becoming more erratic.
John paused. Maybe he was being too paranoid.
Sherlock did his best to loosen up, and could feel John's tongue slowly working its way into his arse. The combined feeling of John’s slick tongue and his fingers pressing into Sherlock’s arse cheeks, holding them apart, made Sherlock tremble.
John's jaw clenched, and he looked down to the ground, his hand gripping the door tightly. “I know, and you need to leave.”
“Mrs Holmes, it's always a pleasure to have to your family here,” John greeted, his usual smile appearing tight and uncomfortable to the careful observer.
Sherlock noticed John's phone, which sat on one corner of the desk. He picked it up and added his number to John's contacts.
“Not yet,” John said, rising, and Sherlock whimpered at the loss.
John pulled his cock out, and Sherlock gaped at it. He'd always assumed it would be larger than average, but he'd never anticipated the girth. It was wider than he'd expected, but Christ it was gorgeous. He reached out, circling his hand around it.
Sherlock’s eyebrows raised, his eyes moving to the door that lead to John’s office. “I wouldn’t say meeting here is ‘careful’.”
Sherlock moaned, resting his forehead against the cool wood of the desk. “F-father,” he choked out. The sensation was completely foreign to Sherlock; it was unlike anything he’d felt before.
?” Sherlock pressed.
“Just need you,” Sherlock moaned. He knew John didn’t want to hurt him, and he wasn’t blind to the fact that John’s girth was quite substantial. Yet, the desire to feel him fully was overwhelming.
“I'll fix it later,” John murmured between kisses. Sherlock could feel John beginning to introduce his tongue to his neck, before he began lightly nipping the smooth skin.
interested.”
They stood in front of the door for a moment in silence as if neither knew what to do next, before John turned his head toward toward the kitchen.
“Yeah..” John agreed, equally as breathless. He sat up and pulled his jumper off, then Sherlock's shirt. Sherlock stared for a moment, admiring John's strong shoulders and bare chest.
John nodded, wishing him well before sending him back to Mycroft.
With that, John let go of Sherlock’s cock, using both hands to part Sherlock's arse cheeks. He leaned forward, running his tongue up from Sherlock's perineum to the top of his arse, and back down to circle around his hole.
By the time Mass finished, John was more than ready to escape. Yet, as always, Sherlock approached to speak with him.
His mother beamed. “Oh, darling, we're so proud of you.”
is what a chasuble is, and
.” Sherlock took the wine cup from Father John, taking a sip. He let a small drop slide down his chin, which he collected with his thumb and sucked off while staring into Father John's eyes. As he passed the cup back, he licked his lips, making sure the Father saw when his eyes traveled down his body. He could see John's throat bobbing as he swallowed, and noticed his hand twitch at his side. It wasn't much of a reaction, but it was all Sherlock needed to know his intention had been noted.
As soon as John rejoined Sherlock on the bed, he placed a hand on Sherlock’s cheek, capturing his lips in a passionate kiss. He stood up on his knees, lubing his cock thoroughly before he laid back down, supporting himself with a hand on either side of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock spread his legs wide as John reached down and gripped his cock, running it over Sherlock’s hole.
to go out past dark, but Mycroft had been keeping an eye out since the day he advised him to stay away from the Father. As skilled as he was in his deductions, he probably had some inclination as to what happened with him and John.
“Sherlock, we can’t talk about this here.”
"Father," Sherlock greeted with a smile.
A wide stream of light shone down from a skylight built the chapel's high ceiling, illuminating the front of the room where Father John Watson stood. He'd been droning on about something- most likely directions on how to live a proper Catholic lifestyle. It must have been particularly important, considering the enraptured expression plastered on every listener's face.
“What do you need?”
Sherlock crossed his arms. “I don't know what you mean.”
John beamed, grateful for Sherlock’s enthusiasm. “It's my pleasure, as always. You've grown into a fine young man,” he commented, patting Sherlock on the shoulder. The Holmes family had been deeply involved in the church for Sherlock's entire life.
After Sherlock had loosened considerably, John slid another finger in alongside the first. With his free hand, he poured more lube over the spot where his fingers entered Sherlock’s hole.
John didn't reply, just tucked his cock back into his trousers and nodded.
Sherlock clung to John’s shoulders, burying his head in John’s neck. His thighs began to tremble again, his eyes screwing shut as John’s thrusts sped up.
When Sherlock arrived at the church the following day, he looked around the empty main room before going to John's office. He was used to seeing the building filled with light and churchgoers. Today, the room was dim, the front illuminated by three rows of candles where John had likely been praying.
In a pew located at the back of the room sat Sherlock Holmes and his family. They'd entered the Mass an
“Do you think you’re ready for another?”
“Oh, I just thought I should inform you that mummy and daddy are thinking of sending you to volunteer at the church.” A smirk spread across his lips. “They think you're..
“Oh, my God,” John muttered, running his hand over his forehead
“Need more,” Sherlock whimpered, panting heavily as his hips rocked forward.
Sherlock could feel sleep tempting him, and he gazed up at John through his tired eyes. “I’ll have to leave early,” he mumbled. “No one knows I’m gone.”
“Right,” Sherlock answered, simultaneously relieved and frustrated that John had mistaken his interest.
“Sh-shit,” he murmured, screwing his eyes shut.
Sherlock's breath hitched, his cock beginning to feel trapped in his jeans. “Mm, John,” he moaned, running his fingers through John's hair. “Want you.”
“Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous,” John commented as he sat back, and Sherlock flushed at the praise. His hand circled around Sherlock's cock, languidly stroking upward. Sherlock choked back a moan, his head pressing back into the pillow below him.
“Touch me, please,” Sherlock gasped, panting heavily against John’s neck.
,” John warned. “I could lose everything. It’s a mortal sin.”
Sherlock nodded eagerly, and John lead the way down the hall. When they reached the bedroom,  Sherlock could hardly believe where he was. Just two weeks earlier John seemed completely untouchable. He never thought his attraction would be reciprocated.
“So, what did you like about the Mass today?” John questioned, finally removing his hand from Sherlock's shoulder.
As soon as John closed the door behind them, Sherlock surged forward, recapturing John's lips.
“Involved?” Sherlock pretended to be ignorant to Mycroft’s meaning.
“We missed you at dinner,” Mycroft said, as if he actually cared.
Sherlock rested his cheek on his desk, willing the distraction away, as a knock sounded on his door. Lifting his head, he frowned, calling, “What?”
“Let us acknowledge our sins,” he began, “and so prepare ours-” He paused, caught off guard as Sherlock shot a sly smile toward him and discreetly pulled his lower lip between his teeth. He and his family sat in the front row, something John assumed was Sherlock's doing. Many members of the congregation appeared confused at John’s pause, so he cleared his throat and finished the rest of the Rite.
Thanks to everyone that enjoyed the first chapter, I hope you like this one even more.
Mycroft invited himself in anyway, and closed the door behind him. “Oh, don't mind me,” he said, making himself comfortable in one of Sherlock’s chairs.
John stepped back, guiding Sherlock backward as they kissed. Soon, he pulled away, sitting down on the end of his bed. Sherlock followed, climbing into John's lap with a knee on either side of his hips.
Sherlock obeyed and took a seat. His eyes flicked between John's lips and throat, where his collar rested.
John only had himself to blame; it was his weakness that caused him to cave in. Of course he suspected prior to their meeting that Sherlock’s interest in him stepped beyond appropriate limits. Yet, when he and his mother had approached John and asked about volunteer opportunities, it wasn't as if he could say ‘Sorry, no, I think your son has inappropriate sexual feelings for me’. In his defense, he never imagined Sherlock would act on such feelings. Still, he should have had the strength to say no. He could have guided Sherlock onto the right path, but his own temptations were too great.
And Sherlock did.
John inserted the tip of his finger slowly, easing it in wish twists and shallow thrusts. Sherlock gasped softly. It didn't feel quite the same as when he'd done it to himself; John's fingers were wider than his own, was the angle was much different.
“Yes! Yes of course, s-sorry.” The words tumbling out a bit more rapidly than John wanted them to.
The shuddering SCP felt his bones turn to pure acid as the next charge raced through his rigid body. A scream caught in his throat, trapped behind paralysed muscles which would force nothing past his throat. Pure agony gripped him as his heart raced erratically in his chest. Every painful beat a little faster than the last, until it stuttered to a halt. The pain was gone in an instant...and so was the world. It was all snuffed out with the suddenness of a candle being blown out.
“I’m not..”
“That’s actually not a bad metaphor for what I’m trying to sa-“
.” She said dryly, giving Sherlock a look.
“Just saying!” Janine replied and laughed, which made the barkeeper who had looked a little taken aback for a moment laugh as well. “Figured he might want to know, as I said before, my gaydar is on point. Am I wrong?” she asked, turning to the barkeeper.
“Am not.”
Massive credit goes to
»Seriously, you put on that whole show, just to ask me for my first name?« he asked and raised his brows again, »What happened to the good old, 'what's your name'?«
»...we clear on that?« Mr Watson finished, his hands placed over his beige, slightly grey-ish woolen jumper on his hips as he was speaking and Sherlock needed another minute to unbend, before he frowned at the just slightly taller man (Sherlock gave it three months and he'd be taller than Mr Watson).
"You know what I mean."
“Yeah.. that is totally what happened.” Sherlock deadpanned and Janine nudged his side with her elbow, though she had go giggle a bit.
(and those possible friends were probably more than happy if they'd never have so much of bad luck to meet Sherlock Holmes). But Mummy thought that was exactly what Sherlock needed.
“Uh.. the fact that you totally kicked Mr Stamford’s arse in chemistry when you let him know he was talking bullcrap and that he had to
“Jesus, mother.”
Dropping the half smoked cigarette – the second one that was wasted – he quickly left, ignoring the still on laughter and in particular muting out a clique that found it apparently even funnier to call him names – very explicit names.
“Hello, Mrs Holmes, I’m Janine.” Janine said and walked over to them with a smile, holding out her hand to shake his mother’s.
“See, I told you we’d become friends with Mr Watson, jush-lik-dat!” Janine said and tried to snap her fingers, although she failed miserably and just a couple of seconds later became pale as a sheet. “I think I..” she began, but Sherlock cut her off, he was dizzy as hell, but he was still able to tell that Janine was about to throw up.
Sherlock wasn’t really in the mood to get to know anyone, but he played along for Janine’s sake and looked around the room and…
“Sure.. just as long as I don’t have to carry you home.” He said and leaned over to look into the menu as well. “How about starting off with a classic and try sex on the beach.”
He eyed his phone closely as he waited for a reply, for which he didn’t have to wait long.
“He’s gay, you know. And single.” Janine clarified for the barkeeper as he handed the phone back and Sherlock looked at her with a frown.
Huh. He hadn’t really expected a text from John and even if he had, it was still surprising to receive it this early in the morning. Must have been the first thing John had done after waking up. And if Sherlock hadn’t had a goofy smile on his face already, it would have formed now, thinking about how he was the first thing John had thought about in the morning. It gave him that same giddy feeling he had whenever John smiled at him or was impressed with him. He did hesitate a moment, considering if he should text back, but 30 seconds later, he was already typing away.
Sherlock just stared blankly at the man. It felt like he was talking to a whole different person than the one that had been giving him hell yesterday morning. More similar to the one from biology class, but still miles away from.. this. He was
Sherlock wasn't exactly sure, but his heart seemed to have stopped for a second at John's words. He still wanted to go on that date? After all? Sherlock bit his lip, at the unpleasant and unknown feel inside in chest. It hurt. Not physically – not really, but almost.
After an awkward pause, Sherlock stood up, “On second thought.. I might still get some fresh air, before class starts.” He said and Mr Watson nodded.
“Well, I’m sure it’s going to go great, dear.” His mother said and got back up to grab her coffee, sitting down again, just when Sherlock stood up and grabbed his bag from the floor. “Where are you going?” she asked, looking at the clock at the wall with a frown, “You still have half an hour before you need to leave and even then you’d still be early.”
Somehow she had actually managed to make it look good. The way she had cut it, even the colour looked better.
“Okay..” his mother said sceptically and sat down at the table while she waited for the coffee to brew. “So… we didn’t get to talk about it last night, but what are you thinking of school on the whole then?” she asked and Sherlock scrunched up his nose a little bit.
"Let's take Redbeard for example, he wasn't
It could have been the face of a boy and at the same time it would suit an old man. Sherlock was frozen in place, utterly fascinated of those deep blue eyes, that looked ever changing like the sea in a storm and still strong and clear like a diamond. It took Sherlock a long moment to even realise the man – Mr Watson – was still talking to him.
Sherlock just nodded, still being utterly startled and even a little intimidated by the other man as Mr Watson pointed over to a free seat in the back of the class.
“That doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.”
asexual with a very slight tendency towards males, but not enough to ever be seriously interested in someone. He was glad he didn't have to bother with hormones or emotions or – perish the thought – the common symptoms of puberty. There had been a time – shortly after puberty started – where Sherlock was bothered by morning erections, but he had never done anything about it. And after a month or two of ignoring them – well, they stopped. Since then, nothing.
"What proof do you have for those ridiculous theories?" Sherlock grumbled, rolling his eyes and keeping his back turned to her.
“Sorry, Mr Watson.” Janine said, before looking down at the book. “He’s stern, but he’s actually a good guy, I think. Super fair.”
“Mr Watson!” The girl said and chuckled quietly, “Totally knew he was going to give Anderson shit. I’m Janine, by the way.”
John awoke to the sound of a violin, an unknown melody. Composing. Sherlock was composing. In the middle of the bloody night!
“Yeah, because I wanted to surprise you, sleepyhead.” Janine said and hugged him again, “You’re 18! Whooo! We can do so much stuff now, like..” she paused, glancing at Sherlock’s mother, “Erm...  like acting really responsible and going to the library.” she said, which was followed by a short, awkward pause before all three of them cracked up laughing.
The next three hours, they did in fact spend ordering and tasting most of the drinks they had on the menu in this place and even made a spreadsheet on a napkin of the pros and cons of each and every one they tried. And it didn’t take long for the spreadsheet to become very incoherent and them to become really very tipsy. Or well, Sherlock was tipsy, while Janine seemed to be a bit more of a lightweight when it came to alcohol as she was properly drunk.
Little disclaimer here, I'm so sorry if the formatting doesn't show up correctly for you and gets all jumbled for you if you're on mobile (which is likely... xD) just for this chapter maybe check it out on your computer/laptop so it shows up properly or you can just click 'hide creator's style' at the top, that'll remove the html formatting and you can at least read it in order :) until I've figured out how to fix the issues with html script :3
He froze as he felt Sherlock wrapping his arms around his middle, the sound of the man's purr still in his ears and shivers running down his spine. What was Sherlock doing? His heart was in his mouth and it took his whole strength to keep his lower half calm.
But even more embarrassing than the form was the fact that Sherlock had painted several bees on it which were shaping a heart and in the middle he had written in his premature handwriting 'Best Mormy Ever' - he had even spelled Mummy wrong. It was humiliating.
“You’ve met her, you know what she’s like.” Sherlock mumbled and Violet snickered.
"Are we?" Sherlock asked once more.
»You remember I'm out tonight, right? My date with Sarah...«
« the approximately ten years older man said, emphasising his words, » ...that you are granted a very short period of grace as it's your first day on a public school, or in fact any type of school , but from tomorrow on, I expect you to not only be
Janine snorted at that, “You’re a potterhead?”
– at least unless there’s a pipe about to explode from too much pressure.”
“If you want to spend the extra time doing homework, be my guest, I’m gonna turn a blind eye, since school hasn’t officially started yet.” Mr Watson said and chuckled a little as he started to unpack his things, “I need to prepare a few papers, I didn’t get to yesterday either.”
Today would be his first day on an actual public school. Lucky Mycroft who had already graduated before mummy had the brilliant (absolutely
Sherlock frowned at the silent, barely audible gasps, coming from his new classmates, only now registering that there were no giggles, or 'oooh's', which he had expected to come. It was almost so quiet that you could hear a pin drop and considering he was among a bunch of teenagers that meant something was wrong.
»Sh... Sherlock... what the f...« he began weakly, but Sherlock silenced him by capturing John's lips with his own. His eyes widened for a second, yet then they fluttered shut and he melted into the other man's arms. Instinctively, he rolled onto his side and snaked his arms around Sherlock's neck, pulling him even closer and burying his hands into his glorious ebony curls, tugging softly as he rolled them fully around, placing himself on top of Sherlock, being used to take the dominant part when it came to actions like this. He didn't know what was going on here, but he definitely liked it. He liked it a lot.
“There’s no middle way approach with you, is there?” he heard an amused and familiar voice say behind him as he arrived at the classroom, making him spin around to face out of all people – Mr Watson.
When Mr Watson did stand up, Sherlock slouched a bit in his seat, not really wanting to get his attention. If he by some miracle hadn’t noticed him, all the better. No need to tempt fate.
." his Mum said sternly and sat down at the table, nipping at her coffee, still using that embarrassing cup Sherlock had made when he was five and his dad had tried to teach him to do pottery, which was his Dad's favourite hobby. It wasn't even a real cup. It looked more like a battered brown bowl with a gnarled handle.
Okay so this is a bit of a short one :3 I'm dead set on writing one chapter a day and yeah sometimes it flows easier and sometimes it doesn't :3 not sure if I'm going to continue to pump them out daily or try to make the chapters longer and take more time between uploads (although if it makes it feel too forced, I'll probably keep them like they are at the moment :) ) I will probably upload whenever I've finished a chapter and read it over 5-10 times because otherwise I'll get stuck  in that read, edit, read, edit, read, edit, read loop xD If it's up I can call it a day and go on with the story :D
“Sounds good.” The man said, handing Janine over to Sherlock who made sure (as much as he could right now) that she wasn’t going to fall over on the way to the ladies’ bathroom.
Sherlock smiled a little at that, the longer they weren’t discussing his sexua-
“I second that.” John said and Janine swirled around to look at the new voice and would have crashed into the table next to theirs in the process if it hadn’t been for John catching her.
“Are you blushing?” Janine asked and giggled.
"I did. Not my fault if you aren't listening." Sherlock replied from the sitting room and John rolled his eyes, "I thought we had talked about the talking to me when I'm not there thing, Sherlock!" John grumbled, huffing and placing his cup on the counter, running his hands over his face.
"Sherlock, I told you I have a bloody date!" John said and reached for his cup again, drinking slow and steady gulps. It was really not Sherlock's fault that John was on the edge today. It was his own stupid head that was messing with him.
“Well…” he began, looking at the table that was covered in a lot of half empty glasses. “Half of that.. roughly.” he said and chuckled, although he himself didn’t quite know why.
For a moment, John was grateful for the darkness, allowing him to hide the way his face flushed deep red, which was good. Hell, he just hoped the blood would continue shooting up his face. It would be embarrassing if it would flow into the opposite direction.
"I admitted that I love Mummy." Sherlock corrected and stuck out his tongue.
“Can you not?” Sherlock asked and chuckled again as he sat down, putting their glasses on the table. “I just don’t like his attitude, okay?”
“Okay, we totally have to go to a bar tonight now that you’re finally not a baby anymore,” Janine said immediately. “I mean, not saying we should get wasted or anything, but like we need to celebrate!”
You're welcome :D
He couldn't even tell what had happened just now. Sherlock had never been lost for words or unable to gave a snarky reply. It was a mystery to him that the man's whole appearance had thrown him off the track like that.
There was that smile again. That was it, wasn’t it? He hadn’t seen a full on, relaxed smile from him all day yesterday. There had been hints of them, but this was.. new. And the way he smiled did ..
“Hardly. We’ve barely said hi before you dragged her up to your room to..
“A pair of black skinny jeans should do. The main highlight is the shirt anyway.” she said as she got out her dress, which was your typical strapless black, short dress and a pair of heels matching the colour of his shirt before the two of them went about getting changed and doing their hair. Janine did in fact manage to tame his hair and he had to admit that it was looking really good like this. So good that he was considering to spend that extra half an hour in the morning to actually do his hair, rather than just brushing it and calling it a day.
“I mean, yeah, it would be kinda weird, but also kind of awesome.. like who knows if we like actually become friends with him, we’d have major back up in school, if anyone gives us shit, we just let him know and he deals with them!” Janine said excitedly and Sherlock shook his head.
“Shut up and go order them.” He said and watched Janine go to the bar, still laughing to herself.
“I think we should go home. You’re way too drunk.” Sherlock said and stood up, but clutching the table for support as he suddenly got super dizzy.  He was probably much more drunk than he had thought. Yeah.. it was definitely time to go home.
“Well, she’s not that kind of mother, she’s actually highly gifted and goes by facts, rather than assumptions and clichés.” Sherlock said and smiled at the way Janine made herself right at home.
“Hey, are you doing anything this afternoon?” Janine asked when she followed him to his locker, leaning back against the one next to it and looking up at Sherlock.
, if you ever be late to my classes from this moment on and/or smoke on school ground, you'll suffer the consequences. Any breach of the school's rules will entail a disciplinary warning letter that is supposed to be picked up by either your parents or legal guardian. Three of those and you'll get a fourth letter along with it, as that'll be your invitation to your expulsion hearing. Understood, Holmes?« the man finished in a stern manner, now crossing his arms in front of his chest and Sherlock found his attitude would rather suit a military officer than a highschool teacher.
Edit: Okay so just because I love to have a face in mind for every chara (except for Sher and John since we all have our own headcanons of them :3)  I've put in a link to my head canon of teen Irene (ooh that rhymes). If you aren't interested, just ignore it, it isn't really important for the story ^.^
, I’ll be sure to remember that when we talk in private, but I fear, I’ll have to stick to calling you Mr Holmes in class.”
“Well.. yeah.” Sherlock said and pulled his keys out of his pocket, while Janine still marvelled at the place, walking up to the side to look past the fence into the garden, which reminded Sherlock of the dead frog in the fridge – and also that he should get to dissecting it soon, before his mother would get the idea to look into the plastic container on the bottom shelf.
this stuff and then admitted you’re right?”
“Well.. I mean.. it’s not exactly hell.. though it’s not that far away, either.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Didn’t you say you’d come by later today?” Sherlock asked and chuckled a little as he first let his mum hug him before Janine went to hug him as well.
“What are you doing here?” his mother asked in astonishment, walking over to the counter to make some coffee.
"Oh, stop it now, Sherlock, you won't get beaten up. Look, if it's really that bad, you can call me anytime and I'll pick you up, but that doesn't mean that you can call me only because you consider the people on the school idiots. You will either way, even if it's just because you want to prove me wrong. So you can call me if they actually harm you, but if not, you'll graduate on this school.
“What? No, she doesn’t.” Sherlock said and sat down next to her on the bed, which was just about the only surface they could sit on, given that even on the sofa in his room, he had stored stacks of paper.
It was a Saturday, so he was understandably annoyed when his phone buzzed next to him on the nightstand, waking him up at 6 am on the weekend. He was about 99% sure it was a text from Janine, wanting to wish him a happy birthday – she had almost been more excited about his 18th than he had been, which seemed nearly impossible. When he checked his phone, though, he had to blink a couple of times, just to make sure he wasn’t seeing things.
»John...« he heard the deep familiar rumble, but there was something different about that voice. It was almost … a purr?
Sherlock tried to shake her hand off, "I'm not shy! It's illogical to send a person like me to a public school. That's why you and Dad decided to hire private teachers for me and Mycroft in the first place, remember? The chance I'll be bullied is rather high. Kids are cruel. I'll be insulted and probably beaten! Is that what you want? Is that some sort of punishment for the kitchen? I told you I didn't blow up the fridge on purpose. I only calculated it the chemicals wrong because Redbeard was sick and I was distracted!" he rambled and turned his back to his Mum, crossing his arms.
gay, you’d be aware of it yourself. And let’s face it, the vast majority of our society is still indoctrinated that boys will end up with girls. So I figured you’d go with the most likely theory to start things of and let off steam with a girl first.” She said and Sherlock shuddered.
“Thanks.” Sherlock said, taking the glasses, before turning away and looking for a place to sit down.
"Did my ears betray me? Did you just admit you love your parents?" his father said with a playfully raised brow, chuckling deeply.
“Well you’re interested in Mr Watson, that much we know.” Janine said and Sherlock snorted.
"I don't want to, leave me alone!" Sherlock called back, burritoring himself in his sheet and pouting. He really didn't want to go there. People disliked him. That was a fact. There was no magic fairy dust that would rain on him the moment he entered the building and would make him more likeable. He would be hated by everyone, that was for sure.
“Well.. no. That
“See you tomorrow, Lock.” Janine said, before she walked out of the house and Sherlock just smiled a bit. Though that died down as soon as the door was closed and his mother stepped out of the living room, grinning at him.
“You’re supposed to read, not chitchat.” Watson said and actually smiled as he looked at Sherlock and Janine, seeming genuinely pleased he and that Janine girl were talking, despite his words.
, I mean.” He said and gave Sherlock a bit of a smile, though it was more of a contemplating one, rather than the easy and light one from before.
“I don’t know.. just woke up early.” Sherlock played it off, while actually, he had set his alarm this early because he was planning on being on time for Mr Watson’s class – in fact, he was planning to be not five, but ten minutes early. Partly to see the look on the man’s face, but also because Mr Watson seemed like a good person to have on his side. After all, Mr Watson really didn’t have the best first impression of him and still he had gone and pulled that whole show with Anderson about his class bullying Sherlock. So yeah, he felt like he was a force to be reckoned with and he’d prefer to have that force on his side, rather than against him.
The darkness began to spin around John and the room heated up in a matter of seconds when Sherlock moved his mouth down John's loin, stroking him softly with his tongue, little movements which could only be described as tasting, before he started to suck gently.
He was very aware that yesterday morning, he’d have jumped at every chance, as slim as it may be, that she’d reconsider. But he was curious now where all of this would go. And it was just a year anyway. At the very least it was a valuable experience, right?
“You’re talking to someone who’s used to dissecting dead things, trust me, I’ve seen worse.” Sherlock said and chuckled a little.
“Janine, no. First of all.. he doesn’t seem like the type to give anyone special treatment in school and second.. It would just be too weird, okay?” he said and looked back at John, who was already looking at them as well, giving Sherlock a small smile as their gazes locked for a moment and Sherlock’s stomach seemed to do a backflip. Then, before Janine had the chance to notice that John had acknowledged their presence, he had already looked away, continuing to chat with his friends.
brilliant) idea to send her children to a school to make friends, instead of being taught by private teachers. What mummy didn't understand though, was that Sherlock was perfectly happy without
He had no idea, why he chose that night in particular, but he was glad he had done it. It was a bold move, he had to admit, but even in the dark Sherlock was able to deduce John. The increased heart rate he had felt on John's neck when he had touched it in the beginning, the sound of his voice - every reaction had made Sherlock more confident, though he hadn't even planned to go this far. But it was the most intense experience Sherlock had ever made and he wouldn't want to miss it, not even for the most complex and trickiest murder that could possibly happen.
So, I'm sorry if that annoys anyone, but that's just how my writing developed and I feel like forcing myself to go back to the way I did things five years ago would just take the fun out of writing and I'll eventually just procrastinate writing in the first place and eventually stop again and that whole shabang, so I basically just wanted to let you guys know what to expect from the story to take away what mostly stopped me from continuing this earlier :3
“Alright, alright, I get it, parental supervision not appreciated.” his mother said with a snicker, “Well, I’ll go serve the cake then,” she said and walked into the kitchen, still chuckling to herself.
John had often imagined Sherlock seducing him. In many, many ways. But he never believed it would feel that good let alone that it would ever happen. It was all so surreal. So amazingly perfect. So intense and passionate. It was better than anything John had ever done with a woman and at this point he was perfectly positive he would make a call in the morning, cancelling his date with – what was her name again?
His first day on this school wasn't even over and he was already made fun of. For something that was even only more or less true as he had no idea what he really was, having not found the right term yet. He liked to call it asexual, but that was only an unverified supposition.
, he thought as he moved to his seat, though best not mention that he couldn’t have been arsed to even look at any other books.
“I think he’s just that bit more stern because he’s super young, he’s like 26 I think. It’s only his second year of teaching. You know he doesn’t want the students to think he’s a pushover. I kinda get it.”
Before the family left, Sherlock's mother approached him. “Now, I'm sure Mycroft told you already that we thought the church would be extremely lucky to have you as a volunteer. We noticed interested in the church you've been lately.”
Sherlock offered a reassuring smile. “I'm sure. I
” Sherlock whimpered. “Need your cock…”
Sherlock reached across John, gently closing the door. For a moment, they just stared at each other, neither knowing how to proceed. It was clear that John was battling with himself; battling with something he had been running from for a long time. John's lips pursed, and Sherlock could see the years of sexual frustration bubbling within him.
Sherlock grabbed a pillow and pushed it beneath his head. He peered down at the mess across his belly and dragged a finger through the spots of come, mixing them together. His eyes were half-lidded, and when John turned on his side, facing him, a smile spread across his lips. “I think I need a tissue,” he commented, chuckling at the obscene amount of come on his stomach.
Each day that passed without word from John felt like a punch to the gut to Sherlock. He'd been checking his phone constantly ever since they parted. After three days, Sherlock gave up hope, assuming the Father didn't want to ever see him again.
. John hadn’t asked that before, he’d always accepted the compliment and moved on. It wasn't as if there was anything new or exciting about any of it. “All of it, really,” he answered.
“I'd much rather stay,” Sherlock answered, his tongue flicking out to run over his lower lip.
Sherlock whimpered, running his hand up John’s side. Their eyes met, and Sherlock could see a multitude of thoughts running through his mind.
“I really don't think this is a good time, Sherlock, John answered as he rose from his seat. He crossed the room, holding the door open for Sherlock. “You should go.”
He stopped before John's door, hoping he looked decent. He'd worn a flattering pair of trousers and a white button up shirt that clung tightly to his form.
Sherlock missed their close proximity immediately, and he watched as John stepped over to the bedside table. He tore the foil condom packet open with his teeth and tossed the wrapper aside. Sherlock stared, mesmerized, as John rolled the condom down over his cock.
Sherlock stepped out of his pants and trousers, following the Father. It was a little awkward at first, but he managed to climb into John's lap. John's hands circled Sherlock's waist pushing up his shirt.
John’s lips pursed, and he nodded, shifting where he stood. “I’ll text you about it later, you should go back to your family.”
Father John sagged in his seat, breathing heavily. Sherlock rested his head against John's thigh, and John’s fingers combed through Sherlock's hair as he worked through the aftershocks of his orgasm.
Sherlock smirked. “Don’t worry, no one can hear us.”
On Sunday morning, Sherlock dressed in his finest suit, making sure the trousers hugged and shaped his arse.
When Mass began on Sunday, John felt odd to be standing before a congregation that looked to him for spiritual guidance; it was like he was putting on an act. Like he was lying to them in a way they would never expect.
“Don't be,” John assured with a warm smile.
“Let's get you out of this, hm?” he suggested, and Sherlock obeyed immediately, undoing each button until he could slip his arms out.
,” John choked out, his fingers tightening in Sherlock's hair as his orgasm crashed through him.
“You're tempted,” Sherlock deduced.
“You have no shame, do you?” John remarked, running his palm over the bare curve of Sherlock's arse.
“So good, so good for me,” John murmured, thrusting his hips at a steady pace.
“Have you done this at home?” John asked, massaging the lubed finger over Sherlock's pucker.
Sherlock flushed, feeling utterly exposed as he never had before- completely on display for John’s eyes.
Sherlock decided sneaking out of the house would be the best option. Sure, he was
“God, yes,” John allowed, beginning to unbutton his trousers as Sherlock climbed off his lap and kneeled before him.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock murmured, surging up to kiss John.
Sherlock shook his head. “I want to taste it,” he said. He redoubled his effort, taking as much of John's cock into his mouth as he could without gagging.
Sherlock could feel a blush forming on his cheeks at the idea of John noticing his absence. “Just ran a bit late,” he said, his eyes flicking down to the ground. “Anyway, I wanted to thank you for Mass.”
Sherlock reached out to the Father, running his hand along his waist. “No one will know.”
know that.” His smirk spread as he folded his hands in his lap. “They've noticed how much you enjoy talking to Father John, so naturally they mistook your interest. They're being quite dense. Really, it's painfully obvious why you've been seizing every opportunity to speak with him.”
