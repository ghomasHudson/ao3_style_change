gonna be some crappy Christmas movie, I can tell you
He hopes the burgers are good, and judging by the empty plates sitting on the table in front of everyone, he’s assuming the answer is that they’re good. He
Castiel looks at Sam over Dean’s shoulder, signalling him that he can go and do what he needs to while he keeps Dean busy. He’ll have to apologize to Sam for his strategy to distract Dean, but it seems to work, as Sam practically bolts down the hall.

Castiel looks to Sam, before back to Dean. "Is bacon a common flavor for those?"
They've never had the chance to celebrate Christmas before as they've had bigger things to worry about, but Jack is fairly certain that pasta isn't really a dish that you'd normally have during Christmas. At least, in all the TV shows and movies he's watched that either are Christmas themed or have a Christmas episode they never have pasta.
Dean nods, stepping out of the doorway to let Castiel in, shutting the door behind them.
Just, depending on who the werewolves are that these cobiescu vampires choose to go after. They can go after whatever werewolves they want to, just as long as they don't go anywhere near Garth and his family.
As Jack looks through the bags the decorations were in, he finds that Mary is right. There's not many left in any of the bags. But it's likely that Sam and Eileen will buy more decorations while they're out getting the tree, because what they have already is certainly not enough.
As Sam and Eileen leave, Castiel is once again left by himself in the kitchen. He doesn’t plan on staying in the kitchen by himself for much longer though, he’ll go see Dean soon and bring him some food.
He’s not positive why they’d need a tree. He would’ve thought the decorations would be enough. Of course, he doesn’t entirely understand the whole concept of Christmas. It’s just never been something that’s ever been on his radar.
He stares at the screen of his phone for a few seconds after hanging up. Dean has just filled him in about the case he and Castiel are on, and from the sounds of things, it's not just any normal case....
"What's not happening?" He asks.
better at understanding them now than he ever was when they first met.

side (Dean's still unsure how he feels about that), but simply because he misses his bed. And he has been driving for a few hours to get home.
"We got the tree and some more decorations." Sam says, as he and Eileen set down a couple bags of food and drink on the bench.
He doesn't understand why Dean seems against decorating the bunker. From his understanding, decorating everything for Christmas is supposed to be a good thing and a way to celebrate the holiday, not a bad thing. So why is Dean against it?
Maybe he can at least tolerate it for his mother and Jack's sake. But he doesn't have to like it.
so you don’t have to cook.”
decorating any other part of the bunker!"
Castiel nods, growing quiet as he takes in what Sam is suggesting they do.
"Getting something to eat first sounds like a good idea." Mary says. "We can always put the tree up tomorrow."
That could be the case, but if it was hunters that killed these werewolves, why would they drain them of all their blood? There is however the possibility that Eileen is right in suggesting that this thing isn't a vampire. What it could possibly be though, Sam is entirely lost.
This time, it's Dean's turn to stare as Castiel gets dressed into a pair of jeans, an old Led Zeppelin shirt of his and a faded blue plaid flannel - also of Dean's much like the shirt - instead of his normal attire. And something about Castiel wearing his clothes makes Dean's heart flutter.
“That was me. I was showing Sam and Eileen my wings. Sam got curious as to their state.” Castiel says, leaning into Dean. “And I came out to get you food.”
Dean has never even heard of this vampire before, and he's about ninety nine point nine percent sure that there's no mention of them in dad's journal. He's never seen them mentioned in there before anyway, and he's read dad's journal front to back many times over the years. He'd know if he's seen any mention of them in there.
"I think I may have found something!" He says, setting the book and files form in the table, before flicking through the book to find what he's looking for. "I was just about ready to give up until I found these hidden away."
“Come on then, Dean.” Castiel says. “I want you.” He pulls Dean down onto him more, and crashes their lips together in a heated kiss.

more cooked than the other, so he flips them over, being extra careful so they don’t fall onto the floor. Though he suspects that even if they did fall on the floor, Dean may still eat them….
They can already guess what this case is going to be, just a standard vampire killing, but they've decided to check out the bodies of the victims just in case it's not what they think. But from what the police reports say, it sounds like they're dealing with a vampire. And if this is just a vampire, then this case will be a piece of cake, and they'll be back in the bunker in no time.
Dean looks towards him, noticing that he seems a little nervous. Which, he must admit, is a
Ignoring the knowing look that everyone gives them, Dean and Castiel get back to work helping prepare everything, and put the pies they made earlier on to bake. They had chosen not to put them on straight after making them because who knows how long they would’ve taken to return after their activities? They didn’t want the pies to burn, so they just put everything together, and let them chill in the fridge until they came back out to bake them. Of course, they could’ve got one of the others to check on them, but everyone else is busy with their own tasks, and Dean and Castiel were tasked with making the apple pies.
, Dean. An odd one, but still a warrior, whether to God or not. As you are. You speak about this as if I have ever expressed the desire for marriage or children or any semblance of that thing you call an 'apple-pie life.' All of these human things you think you cannot give me - who says that I could ever give them to you either? I do not imagine a future with these things. These are human customs, and they are lovely in their place, but I do not anticipate that they are a part of our story."
"I like her," Dean says when Sam comes back from walking Eileen out, gentleman that he is. "She seems good for you."
"Goodbye, Cas."
“Codpiece, Cas. Codpiece.” Dean has never actually used their “safe word” before. Cas insisted that they have one after the first time Dean asked him to pin him down, and Dean had picked it as a joke that Cas never got.
Sam's silence is answer enough. Dean swallows, closes his eyes.
"Hi there. Dean Boon, got a 12:00 with Dr. Leonard?"
Dean catches Rhonda's eye and rolls his own, but he just pats Cas' hand.
to talk about, but he's getting better at it.
This could be anything. The only other sensory trigger is the smell, which Dean doesn't notice at first because it is more absence than presence. There is a conspicuous lack of stale smoke, mildew, or industrial-strength cleaning agents. They must be in a house - a real house that somebody lives in and keeps up with. It smells like freshly vacuumed carpet and clean sheets.
like he would never lay a hand on either of them, like Sam hadn't grown up asking about Dean's bruises. Like Bobby hadn't finally cut ties with John for good after the time Dean had been at his place and broken something - something valuable, an artifact they've all long since forgotten - and flinched away from Bobby, arms already up to cover his face, already saying
Dean mock-groans. "This is the hardest choice I've ever made."
Charlie sighs again, and she looks kinda sad. The complicated sadness that seems to live and breathe in 2020.

"And hand over a copy of you to him? Really?"
Sam is quiet again for a moment. Dean can practically hear him thinking.
It is, without a doubt, the weirdest kiss Dean has ever been a part of. And he’s made out with both angels and demons. This is borderline taboo, even for him, but he makes no move to stop it. Actually, he kisses his younger self back, fingertips brushing his face, and it’s fairly gratifying to know that this, at least, is good.
Dean steals Sam's spare keys to Baby, sneaks her out of the garage, and drives. He drives until he can hear the music again, drives until the road is no longer blurry in his eyes, drives until it puts him back on solid ground.
"You mean exorcised, right?" Younger Dean slathers butter and jam on his toast when it pops up, cramming it into his mouth like he doesn't know when his next meal will be.
Dean turns back around in the driver's seat, shoulders squared. He touches two fingers to his swollen lip.
Honestly, Dean doesn't know if he's attracted to the guy or not. All that eye contact is intense, and he's not sure if he likes it, even if the attention feels kind of nice. It isn't the hungry kind of look Dean is used to from older men - even if Cas fits the usual demographic of Dean's past clientele. Those looks always made Dean feel like he was being undressed and objectified. That hunger was about his body being on display.
"What should I do?" Sam asks.
How patient Cas still is, Dean thinks as he checks reflexively for any cars following him in the dark onto the road that leads up to the garage entrance.
They do this sometimes. Dean is pretty okay at dancing, it turns out. Cas, despite millenia of knowledge and all that grace of movement when he fought, is abysmal. He never seems to get better, either, but Dean is pretty sure this is because he’s not trying at all. Cas just likes the parts where they stand close together and sway, and, honestly, that’s fine with Dean.
“Aw, Sam,” Dean says, plopping back down onto the hood with him and tearing off a side of the cinnamon roll when Sam uses the bag as a plate and puts it between them. “You could have led with this.”
“Mm. This story’s not boring enough, Cas. You’re trying to lull me to sleep.”
Did I lean into the anthropomorphizing metaphors about trees? Yes. But hit me up in a hundred years when we actually have any long term studies.

"I mean, obviously Sam's alive again now," Dean offers unhelpfully. He swirls the last sip of his third glass of whiskey, watching the light catch in the amber liquid.
“Yeah, alright, alright,” Dean tells the dog. "You're right, I'm fine. I'm fine." He pushes the dog aside and wipes off his own face on his sleeve.
“It’s very common for parents to experience a lot of emotional turmoil when their child reaches the age they were at the time of a traumatic event,” Hank says. “It must be difficult to reconcile what you went through at that age with your need to protect your nephew.”

Dean doesn't let go.
“Okay, fine, great, we’re all getting something. Let’s ring up and hit the road.”
Dean slid his arms from Cas' shoulders to his waist, pulling him into the line of his own body, matching them up.
Dean is never going to love another car like he loves baby, but Christ, this car is cool.
Dean made a little grumbling noise and pulled him tighter into his chest again.
Dean had pulled himself off just enough to shoot a glare up at him. "Cas, what about this makes you think that I don't
"You didn't take your medication this morning," Cas says. "You should have it with breakfast."
Constantine smiles at him. Like all hunters, he looks older than his age, but he's still handsome, still clinging to a bit of youth. "Thanks," he says. "The only problem is the winters. You can get snowed in up here and if you don't prepare you could starve before anyone clears the roads. Last winter I was trapped up here nearly three weeks. I was living off of whiskey and pickles by the end." He laughs and takes a sip of his drink now. "Word to the wise, don't put the two together."
"Wait," Dean says. He lowers his gun slightly, although his heart is still hammering. "What?"
More than that, though, is the look John's hiding beneath his simmering rage. Dean knows his dad. He knows that John is bracing for a loss, and Dean can't… he just can't let his dad down.
Dean scowls and flicks his untouched smoothie at his brother.
Younger Dean is still smiling faintly, eyes closed, and even with the blood on his mouth he looks at rest.
"But you know that I-"
Dean smiles and runs his hand up Cas’ arm. The weight and warmth of it feels like an anchor, like protection.
Sam has never really talked to Dean about it. And that’s okay, Sam can cope with it, he doesn’t really feel the need to talk about it. But it’s also… Sam doesn’t bring it up with his brother because he knows that it would hurt Dean, maybe even trigger his own trauma, Hell or otherwise.. And hurting Dean would hurt Sam. And round and round they go.
Even then, Dean had learned to sleep fully-clothed on top of the covers, ready to leap up at a moment's notice. He doesn't move when Andy touches him.
Sam is making them all call college libraries, trying to get a lead on a copy, when the phone younger Dean has been using starts buzzing in his hand.
. He's our little Deanlette Isaiah Winchester, aren't you?"
Dean huffed a little disbelieving sound, but kept himself from telling Cas to shut up the way he normally did whenever Cas complimented him. Cas' chest constricted, painful and near-human.
"You're bleeding," Sam says flatly. He looks frankly murderous. The Dean sitting next to the memory of his ten-year-old brother in the backseat can't help but feel a surge of affection for him.
Sam, overcoming Lucifer to save Dean, Cas overcoming the full wrath of Heaven to save him.
"Stay?" Dean finally gets out. It's a whisper and more of a plea than Cas was expecting.
Additional content warnings in end notes.
"Um," Dean says. "Probably, huh?"
"Too soon," Charlie quips, giving him a grin and a wet hug.
Dean Winchester is dying.
The poem on the next page is short, just five lines and a little sketch of a cantaloupe, but it is too visceral. Dean can't get any farther.
They kissed for a long time, slow and unending, Cas’ hands moving to cup Dean’s face or thread through his hair. Dean rocked his hips up against Cas and Cas met him with a slow downward thrust against his thigh, but he was unhurried about it. Cas was so sated with the feel and taste of Dean, with the relief of finally having spoken a dozen of the hundred of thoughts that Dean brought out in him.
Cas, who has taken a small amount of kugel to be polite, or probably just because older Dean made it, nods, mouth full of potato. “The student wrote it as “shield of the gods”, which is understandable in the context of the passage, but the literal translation is…” Cas hesitates and swallows his food. “It’s sort of… I’d read it as “tree of life,” if it were Hebrew. But in Greek, maybe “wood of the divine”?”
"What the hell is wrong with me?" Dean manages. "Future me? Am I always like this? Is this what I become?"
“You were great at school,” Dean points out. He’s not bitter about it, he’s always been deeply proud of his genius little brother, even in those estranged years when Sam was at Stanford. “And you had all of that going on.”
Fourteen-year-old Dean meets his gaze for a minute before dropping his eyes to the carpet.
Sam, angry, defiant, the sheer raw energy of being eighteen angled in the tensed lines of his body, still looks like he's been slapped.
“Hey, you don’t want to read the play yourself, you get to wait for the presentation. Go cook something.”
None of it is easy.
The first room is a waiting area with soft, calming music piped in from an unseen speaker. It puts Dean's teeth on edge, the way soft jazz always does. There are six chairs and three little side tables with magazines, just like a doctor's waiting room. Everything is soft-white and the lights are slightly dimmed.
“You can only do what is before you to do,” Hank told him in a recent session.
They're both quiet for a minute, Miracle breathing loudly into the silence.
together. They’d be… what? Boyfriends? Husbands?
Did I write this entire chapter just to be able to talk about a hot topic in fish taxonomy? ...Maybe.
“You are, frankly, very hot,” Levi said matter-of-factly.
It’s their covenant: to choose, to allow themselves to be chosen.
"I'm no scientist, Cas, but…" Dean doesn't finish the sentence. Or he does, but by pressing his mouth to Cas' lips.
Cas makes a frustrated little noise in the back of his throat and turns around to glare at Dean. It’s a bright day in late summer and all of the foliage around them is in its deepest greens. The last of the wildflowers dot the unweeded brush beyond the narrow dirt path with flares of yellow, orange, and a hazy purple-blue.
"Jesus fucking christ, Dean."
Dean is silent for a minute, thinking about this. “Do you think He hates us? For all the shit we do, everything we ruin.”
Dean's looking at him, and Cas doesn't know how much Dean can see in the dark, but it seems like he's searching Cas' face.
“Gonna need a little more than that, Charlie,” Sam says, more testy than he means to be.
“It’s okay, Dean. You can go now.”
Dean squints at the largest of the trees. It’s hard to imagine building a Trojan horse out of them.
His brunet mop swayed to the left spotting his brother passing a bookshelf at the far end of the room.  “As I recall we were already looking for one.”
“I can see how it would look that way.  My judgment isn’t compromised,” he responded with all the resolve he could scrape off the bottom of a shoe.
He sighed as he extracted himself fully from the exhausted man.  He gathered a spare blanket from the hallway linen closet and a couple of pillows from his bed and tossed together mock bedding around his fading friend.  He guided his head onto the pillow and his legs to stretch out on the couch.  Then he covered him up with the thick blanket and leaned over his lax frame, adoring his vulnerable tiredness.  “Fuck, you’re cute when you’re sleepy,” he smiled and brushed his meandering bangs away from his face.
“You believe you’ll get me on your bed on the first date?” he challenged with his forearms woven over his chest.
, he smiled and pivoted towards the kitchen.  Dean caught his wrist and pulled him in for a chaste kiss that mooshed their noses for a brief moment.  Cas hummed, a shower warmed palm finding Dean’s neck to pull him in to share a deeper caress.  The agent gave in quickly.  Opening his mouth to his aggressive progression didn’t send an urgent need for more than just that.  He begged his mind to fixate on the sensations around them; to savor the feeling of the hot tongue sliding on his instead of why neither one of them felt a driving need for hands to tug and explore sun neglected expanses of soft skin.  Cozy heat flooded from Cas to Dean making him feel as though he was the one who just spent a few minutes under near scalding jets of his high pressure showerhead.  Cas pulled away first, seemingly oblivious to Dean’s struggles.
“Okay, you clearly need some shuteye; because that’s some delusional rambling you just did there.  Get out of here and I’ll see you back here after midnight,” he shooed him away with swatting hands.
“No,” he sighed and rearranged his thoughts.  “I mean to say, that’s my day job.  I’m an author.  There’s a reason I’ve never told you what I do.  Before we go any further in negotiation, I thought you should know about any… complicating factors.”
“Where would you like me to start?”  He adjusted his hold on the stem of his glass.
“Agent Winchester.  No relation,” he gave a knowing smirk.  “What was the patient’s condition when he first came in?”
“Wait here,” he commanded and darted down into pitch darkness.  The boisterous banging of his boots below echoed around a much larger room than his anticipated.
He released his hands quickly and rolled over to face the broody faced angel.  “Please don’t mention my brother when we’re naked in bed.”  He gave him a peck on the corner of his lips and smiled.  “It’s just bad form.”
They flinched in response and hastily moved towards the empty blacker void across the room Sam guessed was the doorway.  Sam lifted his knees higher to maneuver over the broken shelves and busted boxes cut into jagged confetti under the Impala’s brusque impact.  As he turned into the hallway, he started to make out the secondary storage room across the hallway.  All of the lights were blown out like campfire candles in a windstorm.  The unfamiliar stillness of the bunker unnerved Sam in a way that compelled him to reach out for any tangible surface.  With his finger pads almost on against a tile wall, Cas caught his hand and muttered, “Don’t. There’s a broken bulb there.”
Specks of crusted blood flaked from the corners of Davies mouth as he continued on.  “Ketch killed a fellow agent in cold blood with the help of a psychotic terrorist.  Dead men tell no tales, but that didn’t keep Pileggi from having him chase his own tail trying to find the new head of the operation.”
Sam halted his brother from leaving with a half-raised hand.  Dean plopped back into his chair overdramatically in response.  “What is it, Sammy?”
“Or both,” he concluded with a muted disgust.
The agent eyed his pistol on the side table before looking through the fish-eyed hole in the front door.  Snippets of their earlier thinly veiled phone call rushed back to him and he opened the door.  The other Winchester ducked into the house obviously looking for something.
A fissure formed as Castiel kissed him out of the door fifteen minutes after he normally slammed the door and speed off towards simple mortal peril.  Against that same door, he gripped his mouth shut and slumped to the tile entrance floor.  His fingers didn’t gather up the moisture welling from his eyes.  It’s nakedly fall then subsequent splat echoed loudly into their empty home.  As cumbersome as his melancholy became to hide in their tether as they made love in the minutes before, it was never so clear.  This freshly baked apple pie halcyon suburban house was not his home.
“Oh, so that was two days later,” he reasoned.  He sounded like piecing the information together led to an unfortunate conclusion, but gestured for him to proceed with tender finger strokes.
The adamant shake of his head halted into a pensive gaze.  “Not like this, but there are other strange symbols, like pentagram-type stuff in some rooms down the hall.  Hell, one room down there with a reinforced door even looks like it could hold the devil himself.  Nothing like this though.”
---------------
On the shuffle back to his room, Dean turned off the lights in each room plunging the dim bunker into absolute darkness as he went.  In the library he started from the back of row of table lamps and worked his way to the front letting his eyes linger on the small shelf of books especially curated for Claire.  He heart skipped a beat as the section to the left was noticeably denser, a handful of slim unfamiliar hardcover titles piled up on the top calling out to be noticed and straightened.  Yet again Cas didn’t let an opportunity to care for Claire’s wellbeing go to waste even when she was elsewhere.  Once all the artificial light in their home was snuffed out, he weighed his options for releasing the boiling flood of manic energy he spent the entire day tempering into light simmer.  If he had the same predilections as Sam, we would have sprinted around the property until the chaotic mass nestled in his stomach filtered out through his feet.  Even with Claire safe and sound, drinking the bundle of fear and affection and exhaustion and hesitation into a manageable size wasn’t an option either.  Instead of hazarding bodily harm but stumbling around further in the absolute inky black of the bunker hallways for another option, he made his way back to his room.
He pushed up to look timorously at his deep forest irises.
“Like the fire alarm was pulled but there was no fire,” he mused.  The creeping feeling he first felt when Dean abandoned him at the top of the stairs wasn’t diminished despite the impending awe, so he stayed within grabbing range.  Once beside him, he caught a wondrous sight in the next room.  “Son of a bitch.”  Slack jawed he climbed up the steps into a beautifully arranged library.  Shelf after shelf, row after row of hand bound books stood sentry to the decades absent human touch.  Mahogany long tables and matching chairs were lined up through the center of the room like work benches for scholarly determination.  He snorted in disbelief.
He let his head fall back onto the mass of pillows.  So chock-full he could scream, he gave up on pinning Cas in with his feet.  The slick slide of his cock pulling and pushing at his rim sent joyful pleasure radiating out.  All the while each calculated thrust slammed him closer and closer to orgasmic inevitability.  Between them his erection reveled in the sweaty sensation of Cas’s skin.  He should have been overstimulated after so long without such attentive intimacy, but every movement felt perfect.  Soon every pummeling thrust majestically propelling him skyward into a blissful cosmos.  Faintly he could feel the spatter of his own musky scent smear all over their stomachs.  Articulate notions failed Cas as he slammed into him far more urgently, uncontrolled jerks battered his tender rim, but he couldn’t find it in himself to slow amongst the bestial outbursts buoying off of the headboard.  A handful of concerted thrusts later, he joined him in toe clenching euphoria.
The stranger gave his a severely doubting face in reply, as if he just grew two noses.
“You both had to have made some headway, though.  Don’t think I didn’t see you two this morning,” he snickered, enjoying his brother’s embarrassment just enough to not warrant a violent retaliation.
Every fiber in his core bristled even as his heart pounded, sweating out refusal.  But this was the truth he asked for, right?
“Water’s fine,” he answered weakly as his eyes landed on cluttered sliver of wall to the left of the front door hinges.  Perfectly spaced in a triad from shoulder to hip height down a pistol, taser, and medium length blade with a shallow circular guard were nestled in chapped holsters. Sure, John taught Sam and him to shoot and Bobby taught them how to use a hunting knife, but neither one was really meant for personal defense.
She pulled out her laptop from the bag on the floor and reentered credentials on a screen Sam recognized as a remote access point for her work computer.  She spun the screen around half way so they could both see it and showed the other Agent video footage of a standard lower level meeting room where a handful of agents had just ended a brain storming session.  Several laptops and notepads still littered the long table after most of the agents filed out.  This must have been at lunch or some other break period.  Charlie pressed play on the video feed and he saw three agents in the room, himself, Dean, and Mick.  The footage played at half speed, but he still couldn’t place this particular meeting.  There were only a handful of noteworthy ones over the course of the Krycek case and this certainly wasn’t one of them.  Dean gesticulated wildly about something and stepped out to take a phone call.  The feed showed the length of the table except the end closest to the camera, cutting off any movement of the person sitting at the very tip – Dean’s seat.  Mick and Sam followed shortly after Dean to exit the room, but Charlie kept the video running long after all movement ceased.  His eyes met hers for a scrutinizing stare but his attention pulled back to the screen when Mick reentered the room and sat at Dean’s seat.  His laptop was pulled almost all the way out of frame, but no one else other than Mick could have been the one to move it.  His dark head of hair bobbed to the side as if looking for something beside the computer and a flurry of keystrokes followed.  If Sam had to guess, it looked like a several windows being opened and shuffled like a deck of cards then a USB stick was plugged into a port on the side.  Within 50 seconds, the USB was removed, the laptop put back, and Mick headed back out of the room presumably to join Sam for a few minutes of eye fucking across the breakroom.
“I mean, it’s worth a shot, right?” he asked smugly.
Cas closed the notepad and rested his arms over each other.  “The bunker lights,” he admitted.   His eyes met Sam’s as they both recalled their conversation in the hallway a week before.  “The voltage in them fluctuated erratically throughout several rooms in the bunker.  I first noticed it in the second storage room, then the document room, then outside the bathroom.”
“Yes, sir?” he stood taller, feeling as if his tired slouch could be heard over the phone.
“Yeah yeah,” he waved him off and returned back to the dark room.  The plastic chair scooted closer to the bed with a hollow scraping noise which garnered the immediate attention of the silent stranger.  He waited for Dean to say something with a beaming inquisitive expression.  Having this vision of a man’s uncontested attention forced Dean to squish his own off topic questions down the abstract thought hole in favor of more pertinent ones.  His ever present leather bound notepad flipped open in his left hand.  “The doctor says you can hear and speak just fine but are blocked from conversing somehow.  Can you understand what I am saying now?”
“Is that right?” he lifted one eyebrow menacingly and pulled their torsos impossibly close once more.
He forced himself to blink a handful of times and gazed about the field but contributed nothing.  The contemplative state felt empty and safe, but Jody’s next words would render it disappointingly temporary.
His attention skittered from his brother’s face to his checker socked feet in equal measure.
As always keep up with my m/m manga reviews on Twitter and Instagram @OssuYaoiReview.
The first door on the left “A7” housed what looked like hundreds of boxes made of thin pale wood, like large untreated cigar boxes.  Not wanting to leave any fingerprints, he pushed on one of the bottom shelf boxes with a gloved open hand, guessing its contents by how much the box resisted.  They were weighty and filled to brim, full of paper maybe.  Stories of this place littered his childhood memories, so the unquenchable urge to snoop played his id like a harp.  Again he checked his watch, vigilant in his desire not to end up in jail for trespassing – or worse locked up in a tomb of his own making.
“Sounds lovely,” he fawned from his chair.
“It is if you let it be,” he offered then pivoted to comparatively lighter territory.  “If what Cas said was true about Naomi, I still don’t know how Zachariah could have been aware of the Men of Letters’ attempt to infiltrate their compound but she didn’t even believe they existed.”
At least he was making light of such a depressing dream.  “Look, I’m really sorry you fell into my world, but I’m glad I happened to be there to break your fall.  It sounds like this time what happened after your landing was more pleasant, relatively speaking.”

“Might I use your restroom?” his eyes flicked down the hall to the closed bedroom door.
The angel nodded vigorously fighting the all-consuming urge to fuck upward.
“A version of you, one who I constantly compared to you in hundreds of ways.  But I could never have dreamt up the impossibility of him.  You, him, identical but vastly different all at once.  He was your mirror image from far away.  The closer we became, the more he splintered off from you,” his voice lost its irate edge.  “In the beginning, I thought he was you if the world hadn’t crashed around your ears so young.  As the days passed by, I learned how open and yielding he was in his affection for his closest allies.  All of his facets made me reflect on you, our world, our family through a different lens.  So unguarded, secure, and erudite… so softly he opened himself to me, gave me everything…”
“That and if anyone can tell us where Cas is, it’s Chuck’s chosen few.  Three out of the four divine-ish contacts told us Cas was nowhere on Earth, right?  So that bellybutton of danger down there zapped him into another one of his universes.  Who are the singular beings divine enough to peer into all of Chuck’s playgrounds and point our angel out?”
Dean can't seem to feel much of anything these days.
" Sam says, in a way that manages to scold both of them at once.
The boys never had much of their mother, every memory and story like this was safeguarded. Dean knows that it means something bigger than he can really understand that his older self would make this gesture. He and Cas aren't just hooking up, which would be one thing.
"C'mon, Sammy. Spit it out. Are you pissed I didn't tell you about Cas? Or you are upset that your brother
"Uh, Cas," Sam says as Castiel moves around to sit on the other side of the bed, where there is more space. "What are you doing?"
Memory-Dean gets up from the floor, an unconvincing smile pasted on his face. "Sammy, you little nerd, congratulations. That's great, man."
Cas’ hand finds Dean’s arm, and with a rustle of the blankets, Cas rearranges himself so that he’s curled around Dean, pulling him into the warmth of his body. Dean goes willingly - oh so willingly - and after a brief confusion of tangling limbs, he finds himself wrapped up in Cas’ arms with his face sort of nuzzled into the crook of Cas’ neck.
Veronica was sarcastic, funny, and talked about a mile a minute. Dean though, distantly, that Sam would have loved her. Her friends were cool too, a laid back collection of boys and girls who didn’t really fit any one cliche Dean could think of - they were just people.
Which. Okay. Dean can focus on that a lot more easily than Sam's words about dad. Being responsible for the people around him, that's something he knows.
"That's something, Dean. That's real." The hand on Dean's shoulder pats him a few times.
"Hi Cas," he says once again. "I, uh, I told Sam about us. I guess maybe I lied about it, made it sound like we were a couple. I don't know, maybe that's crazy and you'd think I'm absolutely insane, but you're not here, man. How do I tell people who you were to me? 'Oh Cas? He was the great love of my life and I was his, but no, we never touched each other like that, and also I didn't know he loved me until he died and he died thinking I could never love him.' So can't I just say I'm a widower? I never got to… never got to be your husband, so…"
Supposedly-Sam hastily steps between them.
Cas' expression is one of gentle understanding, so Dean looks away, stares blankly at door number two.
“Yeah. It took an extra reading of
A couple of times a year now, Cas shows up and spends a few hours with him. Usually they have at least once dance, and Dean's getting pretty good. Cas… tries. Dean jokes that it's because Cas gave him all his grace, which Cas does not think is amusing. Dean doesn't really mind that they mostly end up in a basic two-step slow-dance. All that matters is that they've found rhythm with each other.
Abruptly, Sam stands up from the couch and puts his book into the duffel bag sitting next to him. He clears his throat.
There is another long, long silence. Dean feels like he could slip off the hood of the car and fall through the ground at any moment, and wouldn't that be a blessed relief?
Also, there's just, like, a
When Sam gets out of his post-run shower he finds Cas sitting at the breakfast nook in the kitchen, hands clenched tight around a mug, a pot of coffee in the percolator.
"I would have done it," Cas says, his voice the deep gravel of surety. "To give you just one more day. It isn't about the amount of time, Dean, it's what you did with it. The world needed you. If I had to do it over again, I would make the same exact choice. I would always choose to save you."
Dean nods. Sam and Eileen have been talking with the caseworker for a pair of two-year-old twins for several months. “You gonna keep their names?”
"Hell," Dean says shortly. Cas nods and fixes the uncanny blue of his eyes back on Dean.
John looks at Sam for a minute and then, worse than yelling, he says in his icy voice "Then I don't have any use for you here. You might as well leave now."
"You've gone behind my back and done worse shit before, Dean! Need I remind you about Gadreel?" He says. "Or the time you made a deal with a demon in order to bring me back?" He recalls. He prefers not to bring those up, but he's trying to make a point here. "Eileen and I going out to buy Christmas decorations behind your back isn't even close to being as big a deal to anything else we've done behind each other's backs."
Honestly, I was wanting to add more to this chapter, but this will have to do. It's nothing perfect, but at least it's an ending? Maybe not the best ending ever, but it's something, and it'll have to do until I decide to come back to it and fix it up and make it less choppy.
Getting up, Castiel looks to Dean. "Dean, just drop it." He says, grabbing onto Dean's arm. He's had enough of this.... "Come on, or else I'm not making you food."
down for it. He's not going to let on exactly
Sam nods. "Well, that's fair enough." He says. "Though, why
he'll do if Sam's doing exactly that while they're gone, but he'll do
"H-he's gone." Dean mumbles. "And I never got the chance to say it back to him."
So for the next fifteen or so minutes, Castiel chooses to sit at the table in the kitchen with a mug of hot coffee. He doesn’t need to eat or drink, but he’s developed an odd liking to coffee among other things. There isn’t
As soon as Dean and Castiel return to the bunker, all Dean really wants to do is sleep. Not so much cause he's exhausted from the case, which was rather uneventful, aside from the fact they've discovered a new breed of vampire that's on
"Jack?" Sam asks, reluctantly moving away from Dean, and over to Jack.
As if on cue, Jack comes running into the library carrying an old book and what appears to be a couple old case files.
"Dean, what is it?" He asks. "Talk to me."
He remembers watching episodes of the show years ago while stuck in motel rooms with Sam while their father was out on a hunt. Though he can't remember much of what happened in it, but he has always thought that Buffy was kinda hot.
better if we went all the way though.”
"I didn't get the chance..." Dean says, his voice shaking. "I… I loved him."
What Sam is saying is right.
"Deal." Dean says, giving Castiel a quick kiss. He would've liked to do more, but that's good enough for him. For now at least….
"Nothing." Dean sighs, leaning back on his chair. "Maybe it's just some vampire that's found an alternate food source instead of humans."
wearing pants.” He says, correcting Dean’s mistake. “Dean however is not.”
"Well it's one of the few things we can cook." Dean says. "And it's cheap to make and well within our budget."
But what he is definitely
“Dean, I’d rather we have a shower before we start cooking.” He says.
Casting one last glance over at Dean once he’s dressed and standing by the door, Castiel makes sure his hunter is still asleep, before he’s quietly making his way out of their room and through the bunker in search of Sam.
Though Dean has said he's down for having a big feast for Christmas, much like he had suspected that he would The guy can never turn down food. So at least he's on board with that. But he's not on board with decorating the bunker, unlike everyone else.
"Son of a bitch..." He mutters, turning to leave the library. "I'm gonna kill him..."
"We have returned with food!" Is the first thing that Dean Winchester shouts out as he and the angel Castiel walk into the bunker and down the stairs. The pair of them carrying two bags each filled to the brim with food and beer for everyone in the bunker.
He turns towards his brother, folding his arms across his chest. He knows that Sam and Eileen had gone out to buy Christmas decorations even though he said not to, and they’ve hidden them somewhere in the bunker. It’s the whole reason Castiel had initiated sex with him earlier, to distract him while Sam and Eileen went off to hide the decorations.
, but it’d be much better if Dean was on board with decorating too.
“I’m drinking, Cas.” Dean says, holding up his beer. “And you’re not supposed to drink and cook at the same time.”
"H-he did what?" Sam asks, his tears already starting to fall. Castiel is gone, and it's permanent this time. He never got the chance to say goodbye, or try to prevent it.
"We're home!" Dean calls out, announcing his and Castiel's arrival home. Not that he
As Castiel looks over the other body, as Dean checks the other in case they may have missed something, he stops as something doesn't feel quite right. Some of the features on the body don't quite appear human.
Sam turns around and picks up his duffel off the couch, swings it over his shoulder.
That's for the best, probably.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, I see," Hank says. There's no hint of surprise or judgement on his face and Dean lets himself relax a miniscule bit in his chair. "And how long have you two been together?"
"I'm not gay," Dean says, and even he can hear the defensive anger in his voice.
Dean pulls himself together enough to say "Order a burger like a man," at the same time as older Dean. They look at each other, and Dean thinks his other self's mouth quirks just the tiniest bit upward.
John walked over to the window that looked out on the motel parking lot. The sickly yellow light illuminating the walkway made the scratch on his face look black.
There’s a lump in Dean’s throat.
we were his children, and he cared more about revenge for mom than about making sure we were safe."
Dean made a surprised noise and then laughed into the pillow where he landed as Cas pinned him down between his thighs again, settling over him.
Dean sits up, rubs at his face, and places one hand in the patch of upturned dirt where he's made one last symbolic burial of his angel.
And Dean definitely hadn't counted on waking up bleary eyed and still wrapped up in Cas' arms with the certain knowledge that Cas had spent the whole night watching Dean sleep. And he hadn't counted on that loose feeling not just in his limbs but in the warmth in his chest, a feeling that he'd eventually identified as
Cas looked away, swallowing around the feeling of a heaviness in his throat. He wasn't sure he knew the answer, other than
It’s all Sam’s fault, anyway. Sam brought a friend from CSU up several years back to meet Cas and see his garden and greenhouse, and the guy’s eyes had just about bugged out of his head.
It’s been two weeks, give or take, since their world ended and started again. They are the original members of Team Free Will, the club paired down to the bone. Dean can survive with just Sammi. He knows he can. He knows that at some point, Sam is likely to drag that pain out of his chest and make him
"Dude, I get it, I'm on board. I'm sorry about what I said about the shirt, okay? Please stop talking about this in the Goodwill."
“This is… Dean, this is senseless.” Cas isn’t crying, but only because he seems too pissed off on top of the pain. “You said we should talk. Let’s
Dean blinks a little. He's listening, he's just also thinking distantly that maybe it's nice that Sam can sort of cry
Dean is still shaking, shame and rage and something that he doesn't have the words for coursing through his body, threatening to spill out in a wordless scream.
That's all there is.
"Imbibing outside of communion is generally frowned upon," Cas says, nevertheless sipping from his glass. He takes it with a straight face, no reaction to the sting at all. "But it takes much more than a bottle of whiskey to have much of an effect on me. Besides which, I have an impressive list of infractions against me already, so no reason not to drink."
Dean glances at the clipboard. "Did you read my form?"
Dean had brought two ziplock bags of dry cereal for snacks - because that was what they’d been eating for the past three days anyway - and he’d actually found a five dollar bill just sitting on the pavement outside the entrance to the reptile habitats. He hadn’t even thought about saving it for later - instead he and Sam had split a hotdog, ice cream, and coke. It put Sam into such a sugar rush high that they would have had to stay there all day anyway before he could sit still for the bus ride back.
"Listen, Dean, I just about raised you boys myself and maybe I should have done more, I don't know. Maybe I should have made your daddy leave you with me for good the first time you stayed over. I saw what the life was doing to you. First time your dad left you with me you couldn't have been more than eight, but you were already taking care of your little brother like you were the father. I remember, I tried to get you to go play with a couple of neighborhood kids, but you were too anxious looking after Sammi. You wouldn't even trust me to put him to bed right." Bobby chuckles. "Sam was such a bright little kid, always wanted to be told a story, had the sweetest smile you've ever seen. But you, though… the minute I met you, Dean, I could see you were already thinking like a hunter. No kid should have to know the things you did. And no kid should have to carry what your old man put on your shoulders. You were holding that family of yours together at eight years old, and god help me, I knew how wrong that was. I knew, and I didn't stop it."
Sam nods. "Yeah, I know. But we don't have much choice."
Sam closes his eyes again. Hearing it in Dean's voice, even if it is Dean's voice pre-hell, before Dean had come back out of the earth sounding like he'd spent forty years screaming, is almost like absolution.
“It’s just, uh.” Sam hesitates. “We all kind of… knew?”
Dean nodded, swallowed, then dragged his eyes back up to meet Cas'. "I do, you know." He cleared his throat. "Trust you, I mean."
*A note on Eileen's Judaism: Listen, okay, I know there are lots of reasons Eileen would not normally be the one to perform the Final Kindness for Dean, but we don't know that she *isn't* part of a
It's a bad plan. Well, to be fair to Sam, it's a decent plan given what they have to go off of, but it's based on too much speculation with no time for correction if they get something wrong in the moment. Dean is starting to feel jittery about the whole thing.
Younger Dean and Jack size each other up warily. Younger Dean glances at Sam before finally sticking out his hand, and Jack glances at Dean before shaking it.
He sends the photo to Sammy, then clicks the phone to sleep and shoves it back in his pocket. Cas and Jack emerge a moment later, Jack practically beaming now and chattering away about lizards.
"I've got a case," Sam says. "Possible vamp nest, within driving distance. We could be in and out."
"Good. I'll see you in Springfield."
“C’mon, Sammy,” Dean said, nudging his brother with his elbow. “When’s the last time you got stoned?”
“You wanted me to live. I get that. Like, I know, Cas, I do. So I’m gonna try, man. I swear I’m gonna try, but I don’t want to do this without you. I don’t want…”
There's a half beat of silence.
"Yeah. Whatever."
Fourteen-year-old Dean is almost obscenely pretty. Now-Dean gets it in a way that he hates, a way that turns his stomach to think about. He remembers something else he hasn't thought about in years, the grown man with liquor on his breath who'd stopped Dean outside a bar where he was working his pool hustle, stopped with a hand on his shoulder, crowding his space, and said "Look at you, sweetheart, you shouldn't be
Cas is there. That's it, that's enough. Cas is there, in front of him, hands on him, so Dean wraps his arms around his neck, presses his body as hard as he can against him, and kisses him on the mouth.
"Dean, I have no idea what you're talking about right now."
Sam. "He's not the only one. What happened to him? To me? Actually, no, scratch that. Where are we? And why the fuck am I here?"
"Well, maybe, but your 'brood' is being slaughtered downstairs while you've been up here snacking. Good to know your priorities."
If Dean had paused at all to think about what he expected, which he emphatically did not do, he kind of…
Cas thought for another minute, and then he said “I was in the Middle East for a while, around 400 AD, and there was a raid on a temple in Persia. I wasn’t supposed to do anything, I was only there to observe. But there was a child, a little girl who was supposed to die. She was so small and innocent. She made flower chains on her way to worship and laid them at the steps of the temple. And I thought
Cas shrugs, the folds of his ridiculous trench coat rustling in the stillness of the room. Dean has already figured out that the walls seem at least partially sound-proof.
Sam looks startled, all his emotions playing out on his face in a way Dean's never had trouble reading. "Dean, no, that's not… Were you listening to me at all? Yeah, I think you learned how to bury some of your emotions like dad did, and obviously the drinking, but you're not a mean drunk. The thing with Cas, I didn't mean… I just want you to see what you're doing. But it doesn't mean I think you're like dad. Not in the bad ways. I think dad haunts you. Both of us. But…"
Dean and Cas go hiking when there's not too much snow in the mountains. They take the dogs on trails where they're allowed, but they visit a lot of the state parks on their own. Cas makes a good hiking partner because he gets quiet and contemplative in the same way Dean does, neither of them needing to talk.
and he's never been comfortable with
Sam’s lips perse, hiding his smile. “We’re roughly forty, Dean. We cannot have a prank war.”
"An alpaca sanctuary," Dean repeats as the waitress boxes up their pie. He drinks his coffee to keep from salivating all over again.
Sam closes his eyes, feels the burn of the tea against his chapped lips, the comforting, searing warmth of the ceramic on his palms. "Enough of them."
"She lost someone," Cas says, his raspy voice low and full of emotion. "A… a best friend, I think. A life partner, although not a mate. Just… someone she loved deeply. She's gone now, and they didn't let her keep the bones. She doesn't know where her body went. And that's important to them."
Dean scowls, mostly to cover his own nerves. There it is. Confirmation more solid than Sam's speculation or a picture on a phone.
Sam rolls his eyes. "Just don't do anything stupid."
Dean is pretty sure Cas would burn the whole forest down to save him - at the very least, to save his future self. He's pretty sure, actually, that Cas would burn the whole world before he let older Dean die. Again.
(See the end of the chapter for
And this isn’t the first time Dean’s remembered things wrong, he’s doing it again, that thing he did with Cas and Purgatory, and how the hell is he supposed to trust anything if he can’t trust his own brain? It’s like Chuck all over, except it’s inside him. How is he supposed to know if anything is real?
“I am uncertain,” he answered.  He filled his porous response in with the uncertain moroseness gracing his fine features.
“What could I possibly need to keep you grounded about?  You get another book deal or something?”
Dean scooted past a deep voiced bartender with a hand towel draped over her shoulder to check that the knee level mini fridges were full before he loaded the hand truck back in the van.  The skinny blonde took up her spot beside her mother and filled drink orders as a sandy mulletted man dashed to and from the kitchen with stacked plated down his arms.
“Being over six thousand meteorites hit earth every year, and I doubt any of them glow, it might have been wasted time.”
“The why for what?”  Low simmering anxious energy rose to light boil in his gut.  The deliberate tonal change sent his heart pounding against his ribcage like a caged bird aiming for the clouds.
He nodded quickly and swung the curtain back around his head to stand in the undoubtedly hot stream.
.  Clearly my invitation at in the parking lot wasn’t opaque enough.”  He dodged Dean’s stare in favor of tracing the stitching of his pocket with his eyes.
“Of me?” he asked cringing, the admission stinging like an arrow.
Intermittent napping on the soft, amply stuffed couch began to bore him by mid-afternoon.  The plush blanket wrapped around him smelled of Dean in several spots, reminding him that his version back at the bunker most likely going out of his gourd with worry.  Not that their other worldly escapades occurred often, but it wouldn’t be the first or last time any one of them would be flung into the ether for an unknown chunk of time.  Who knows, maybe time worked differently here.  Hopefully when he returned it would be mere seconds from when he shrunk into sub compact existence in front of his eyes.  Cas snuggled into the soft folds again and breathed in deeply.  All he could do was hope.  If there was no Grace, then there was most likely no proactive God to pray to either here.  Muscle aches mingled with spiritual displeasure in his abdomen.  Reaching up to Heaven or listening for Angel radio felt as useless as his irritatingly frequent urinations.  Most parts of the human experience he could have done without; that being his least favorite.  Bottling up that ache forced him from the dark couch to investigate the other rooms in the suburban home.  His mission to prove useful could very well start with something in one of those rooms.
The tender caresses slowed along his hand and a throat cleared very close to him.  When he whipped his head around Dean irises ponged from his face to their united hands.  “Where’d you go there?”
“I mean it. You did me a real solid.   Won’t forget it.”  He bagged up the items and handed them off.  “But you gotta tell me: was any of that true?”
“What are the ramifications of justice based on a lie?  What are the consequences of truth without justice?”
“Fine, well seeing as more than half of the cult books I found were memoirs or novels, I tried to focus in on books with a domestic focus.  You had mentioned US based cults, so I assumed your subjects were all American.  All three authors I found wrote after 1990, aren’t pronounced deceased, don’t write any other genre of book in their portfolio, and claim to be male.”
“What do I have to do to convince you this is real, then?” he squirmed up to straddle his hips.
“What like, a chance to dart from the room?” he puffed a bit chapped at the request.  If any of Sam’s enlightening introjections strengthened the self-reflective part of his mind over the years, he was glad for it in that moment.  “Trust me, I wish I had one of those myself.”
With a sideways grin, he flipped the photo over to show an area code then flipped it back to the front.  “You answer one question to my satisfaction, I give you one digit.  With our initial hoorah being such a success, I was feeling generous and gave you the first three.  You ready, Dean?”
The dark brunet agent sat across from him at his own well-manicured desk and interlaced his fingers on his workplace.  “Nothing like being home again,” he mused.  “Just now I scheduled a five hour debriefing for tomorrow morning.  Hopefully I will be back to riding the desk for a few days neck deep in final reports.  You know I love a meticulously detailed summation of casework.”
In all the time he had known the other Winchester, there were few mornings he could have called him bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, or any variation of a morning person.  On the rare mornings he forgets his coffee thermos, he could be found in the canteen bowing before the instant coffee maker with those insufferable single use pods as if they contained the invigorating reduction of first day agent enthusiasm. Only after draining the former or pounding the later was he any approximation of personable.  This morning however, Sam’s game of I-spy couldn’t identify the source of squirrely geniality rising from Dean like cheap offensive cologne.  The laser focus on his conversations before eight o’clock, the immediate snappy responses, the wide gesticulation; it all pointed to one thing: amphetamines.  Whether it was University students cramming for a final or a multi-day long surveillance shift for an overworked agent, chemical assistance was always an option.  Dean just never seemed like the type.  The stench of his easy excitability fogged up the corridor all the way to the shooting range.  Chatty and playfully argumentative, his mouth ran laps around Sam as they discussed their first meeting concerning a new case.  Dean’s partner was still on the bench, so Sam was picking up the slack.
Dean nods, scrolling through the selection of horror movies. “Horror it is then…”

Castiel watches as Dean dries off after their shower. He
“Hey.” Mary says, making her way in and looking through the bags of decorations. “This going to be enough?”
"Alright, Dean. That sounds good." Sam says. "Probably the best thing to do."
He's gone. Cas is….
room too.” Dean reminds him, for what’s quite possibly for the millionth time. “You don’t need to ask.”
Sam sits up, leaning over to get a good look at the page of the book Jack has open in front of him. His interest immediately caught as he reads through the first paragraph.
So he goes around to everyone, and asks which flavours they'd prefer. Which helps narrow it down a lot, thankfully, and he gets right back to making each of them.
“What you got there, Sammy?” Dean asks, leaning against the door frame.
At the sound of Cas's name, Dean is certain that if he still has any years left to shed, he would be. Instead, he lets out a shaky breath, nodding his head.
Frowning, Castiel shakes his head in disappointment. “It just tastes like molecules.” He says. “Sorry, Dean.”
drink and cook at the same time!” He says. “Don’t tell me you’re going to start being careful now
“Alright, I talked with mom and Eileen.” Sam says, walking into Dean and Castiel’s room with a list of things for them to buy from the store. “We figured out a few easy things we can make.”
"Morgue first, then talk with the victim's families." Dean says around a mouthful of burger. "But if it's just a couple of vamps, then this case will be a piece of cake, and we can get back home in no time." He says. "But I swear to god if Sam's put up any decorations while we're gone..."
Nodding, Castiel realizes that makes

Castiel tilts his head to the side. “I know, Dean.” He says, knowing exactly what Dean is referring to. They’ve used it for more than just sleeping before. “But it

“Right.” He says, making his way back to Castiel. But he stops, noticing Sam and Eileen sitting at the table watching them still.
down he is for it though, not really anyway.
He shakes his head, moving to the bed to look through the food Castiel brought in. And as he sees the pie, he let's out a sound in success.
He looks over at Dean, who's still in the exact same spot. He knows Dean needs Castiel back, that much is obvious. So, so painfully obvious.
“Hey, what matters is that you tried, Cas. That’s all we can ask for.” Dean says, patting Castiel on the back, before he’s off to fix himself up a burger.
. And hopefully he’s not lying about them going all the way later tonight….
But I'm trying to get this completed asap!
Mary nods. "Alright." She says, knowing that Jack's likely right that Sam and Eileen will get more decorations. "Let's get this all finished, and then I'll make us some coffee."
Having the bunker all decorated is something that he does
Either way, Sam doesn’t bother to call out to Dean. better not to anyway, or he’ll have a fit if he sees the amount of Christmas decorations they’ve bought. Although that’s not to say he won’t see it all soon enough and complain.
Of course, this is all if she
As soon as he finally goes off towards Dean’s room with a bag of potato chips, pie, and a couple bottles of beer, he’s greeted by Dean’s closed door, and Led Zeppelin blasting from inside.
He thinks it looks okay, and he thinks he's done it right. But he'd like to hear Mary's opinion of his work before he does anything else to it or starts decorating something else.
Sam looks down at Dean, only catching what he said. He didn't get the chance to say what?

"Cas! You're supposed to be on
how much Dean loves pie. "Yes he does...."
As Castiel looks to the others for assurance that they were okay and it’s not just Dean saying they’re okay, he smiles as the others nod their heads in agreement with Dean, and Eileen gives him a thumbs up..
