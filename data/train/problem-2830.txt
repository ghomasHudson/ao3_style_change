Applause followed the speech, applause Sam joined in on beside him and a warmth flowed through him as Claire took his hand and squeezed it.
Cas smiled and nodded. "I definitely see the benefit now." He looked down at the tie he still held in his hand. "And now I won't have to learn to tie this infernal thing." He commented, throwing it over his shoulder to land on the bed as he leaned forwards to capture Dean's lips once more.
But as he held onto the weeping hunter, he couldn't help but feel that it had all been worth it, just to be able to lie here with Dean in his arms and comfort him through his grief.
Ellen and Jo showed up not long after and soon the house was filled with conversation and the smell of turkey roasting.
He did not cry when George Bailey jumped into the freezing river to save his brother, he did not cry when the alcoholic pharmacist hit George so hard is ear bled, he did not cry when George was standing in the snow and the cold on the bridge an inch away from throwing himself into the icy depths below, and he certainly did not cry when at the end, the cute as a button Zuzu proclaimed loudly, "Every time a bell rings an angel get's his wings!"
Dean's expression told Sam that his big brother had hoped Sam hadn't heard what he'd just said. But both brothers knew the cat was out of the bag and there was no way Sam was letting this go. Not until he'd gotten the truth. Dean let out a bone-weary sigh and moved back towards the car, turning when he reached it and settling in the dirt, leaning back against it. Sam followed and sat next to his brother; close enough to give support but not so close that Dean would feel smothered.
A throat clearing brought them back to the present. They turned, still entwined in each other’s arms.
Crowley looked down at the water dripping from his face onto the dark slacks of his vessel. His body.
Once dinner was over and Dean had plied Jody with dozens of complements on the pie, she found herself cleaning up in the kitchen with the former king of hell.
“Thanks Castiel.” Sam answered, feeling like he would never be able to stop grinning like and idiot, “Listen,” he said, changing topics, “I just wanted to say, I’m glad Dean has you.”
And then Sam broke away from Dean's embrace and launched all six foot four inches of himself at Cas, pulling him into a bone-crunching hug.
The sheriff called with an update on the case once Dean was back on the road after dropping Cas off. The first victim's husband's DNA had not been present in the sample sent to the lab and he and Dean were currently pouring through the guy's case file down at the station.
Cas looked down at his daughter and a pang of longing burst through his chest at the thought of how much time he had lost watching her grow. Guiding her, teaching her, keeping her safe. Not for the first time, unkind thoughts toward Amelia surfaced in his mind, rants fuelled by righteous fury on the absence of her right to keep this all important part of himself from him.
Crowley emerged from the shadows, eyebrows raised as he sauntered forward slowly, hands in pockets, taking all the time in the world.
Castiel entered the kitchen to find Dean standing with his back to the entrance, mixing pancake batter. He paused in the doorway for a moment to observe the man. He was dressed as Castiel was in a thin t-shirt and sweatpants, socks coving his feet to ward off the cold floors of the underground bunker. Castiel watched, fascinated, as the muscles in his back flexed a worked as he whipped the batter, visible though the thin cotton of the shirt he wore.
"Let's have a look at how you're healing." He said, grabbing the hem of Cas' t-shirt and helping the ex-angel pull it up and off. Dean checked the other man's ribs, making sure nothing had been punctured and that there was no internal bleeding. Satisfied that everything was healing as it should, Dean looked up to find blue eyes watching him intently.
Dean’s stomach clenched again. He didn’t like the thought of leaving Meg to look after Cas and not just because she was a demon. He didn’t like the way she looked at him and flirted with him and the way Cas had pushed her up against the wall and kissed her when they had been storming Crowley’s complex. He didn’t like the thought of leaving her alone with him. Especially with him in such a vulnerable state.
Looking at the easy smile that graced his brother's face, Sam hoped to God he was wrong. But if his life had taught him anything, it was that good things didn't tend to happen to the Winchesters.
But now…now everything was different. Sam had never had the blind faith in his father that Dean had, the unwavering belief that John Winchester knew everything, that John Winchester was invincible. Where Dean had seen their dad's strengths, Sam had seen his weaknesses: his obsession, his temper, and his drinking.
The room was silent as they ruminated on the unknown fate of Chuck before Charlie once again broke the uncomfortable mood.
"Cas and I are together." He said, still not quite able to believe it himself despite having said it out loud.
He sniffed, wiping away a few tears that were escaping at a rapid pace. Dean shifted to Cas' crate and he tugged gently, allowing Castiel's head to fall forward, resting against Dean's shoulder and wrapping his arms around the distraught man.
"I'm warded, and my Grace is gone, and I was hoping that I would seem like just another desperate human that the... the militants couldn't care less about."
Sam fell to the floor, panting and coughing, the ground in front of his mouth growing red with flecks of blood. With shaking hands he lifted the paper with final chant written on it, whispering the words between deep, hacking coughs. His arms lit up with pure celestial light, spreading through his body until he was glowing out of every pore. And then he turned onto his back and screamed, light shooting out of him until it filled the entire abandoned church with blinding luminescence.
Castiel had been so bolstered by his discussion with Sam that he had come to Dean with every intention of telling the hunter how he felt, but now, sitting here with him in such close proximity, the fallen angel was beginning to lose his nerve.
"And Sam is freaking out and wants you to find out if there's anything on that tablet that can help him? And let me guess – he has unrealistic expectations as to how long that's going to take?"
Dean stared at it now, stared at the hateful reminder of his former happiness. It was as though the loving faces in that picture were mocking him and he felt his anger rise again.
"You okay?" Dean asked, his mothering instincts towards Sam coming out despite the way he had chosen to wake his brother.
Cas did not reply but instead pulled back and smiled. He tugged Dean's soft, cotton, stones t-shirt up and began kissing a path down Dean's chest, stopping in places when Dean's involuntary moans told him he had lit on a particularly sensitive spot.
Jolts of electricity spread through Cas' body, similar to, but much more powerful than, the ones he had experienced when kissing Meg. Castiel's hands came up to cup Dean's face and he turned his body to face Dean's before pulling away, his hands remaining on Dean's cheek.
To anyone who is following The Things We Hide, I apologize for the lack of update last week, in the last two months I have changed jobs and moved three times (once across the country) suffice it to say, I am a little overwhelmed and mentally exhausted and I know how I want it to end, I'm just having a little trouble getting there so bear with me!
Dean nodded and Castiel took the coat, unfurling it and letting it hang. Slowly, almost reverently, Cas slipped it on.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and covered them with his fingers, resting his elbow on his bent knee and letting out a self-deprecating, humourless laugh.
He smiled at her before departing the convenience store. She watched him go with a bemused look on her face.
"No, no. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, wake up, buddy." Sam babbled as he pushed Dean away, holding him upright and shaking him, willing him to open his eyes, to breath, to live. "Hey. Dean." There was no response. "Dean!"
He sighed, exhaustion creeping into his bones. He may as well tell. At least then everything would be out in the open.
"Lightweight." he said endearingly. He had so far never let Cas have more than one beer at a time ever since discovering that the newly-human angel had not retained his alcohol tolerance when he'd fallen.
Once they had eaten breakfast and Cas was looking marginally better despite the dark circles and bags that still sat under his tired, dull eyes, Sam left to grab his laptop and Dean and Cas sat down to discuss how best to proceed.
"Yeah I remember and I was an ass to say that because you're not useless. Yeah you may not have your mojo anymore but you've still got all that knowledge floating around in your noggin, that's gotta be worth something and besides you have no idea how much you've helped me just by being here. You are not your grace or your strength or your healing powers. You are you, and that's all you need to be. That's all I want you to be." He sighed, taking the coat from Castiel, "Look, I'm sorry for buying this all right? I'll take it back tomorrow."
"No, Dean, I—" Castiel began when a call from Sam and heavy footsteps alerted them and they stood to see Gadreel entering the bunker, hands up.
"What the fuck?" Dean breathed as Castiel continued to wail, his body folding in on itself, and Dean pulled him in, wrapping his arms around the devastated man as he looked up at Gabriel.
"You felt it though; the forest and the life within it. How can you doubt now its capacity to sense? Just because it doesn't have a central nervous system does not mean it lacks an ability to feel."
"It's okay." Bobby said emphatically. Slowly the breathing evened out and the fear in his eyes faded, replaced by embarrassment and shame.
"But doesn't it, though?" she questioned. "And the Cas you know, would he raise an army of angels without telling you? 'Cause this Cas did. I'll tell you a secret. There's more out there like me. So many more."
I want to thank everyone who has read and followed and favourited and reviewed, thank you for giving me so much love!
Castiel had lowered his head to rest against Dean’s shoulder, trying to curtail the sensations running rampant through his body.
Dean nodded, eyes scanning over the angel before pulling him in for a heated kiss and a crushing hug.
He helped the sloshed man up and into the room, settling him on the bed where he fell backwards, splayed out.
The plan was for Sam and his girlfriend Sarah to fly in and stay over at Dean and Cas' before driving up to Sioux Falls to spend Thanksgiving with Bobby and Jo and Ellen. Cas was worried that he would be intruding but Dean insisted.
The room flooded with light and Castiel had to blink at the sudden change but when he could see again, Dean was staring down at him with a look of awe and disbelief.
Maybe he really was worthless. Maybe everything Alistaire had told him had been the truth. Maybe Cas was starting to realize that.
They spread out, filling the space with their span, and Dean wanted to reach out, to run his hands along the few feathers that still clung to the skeletal frame, but another wave of pleasure washed through him and he clutched at the bed sheets instead as Cas moved above and in him.
Castiel's frown deepened and his head tilted in that particular way it tended to when he was trying to figure something out. Then his eyes went wide and locked onto Dean's.
He sighed. "I hadn't planned on staying another day in the motel so I hadn't paid for it. Luckily the manager was a tight-fisted bastard and when he came over to collect the money, he found me unconscious in a pool of my own vomit." He smirked. "Kinda like a rockstar, I guess. Anyway, he called an ambulance."
"Hang on." Dean said before turning off the speaker and holding the phone to his chest. "Why the hell do you want to talk to her?"
"Yes." He breathed, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Dean's lips before pulling back and looking down at the ball of fur sitting contentedly in the palm of Castiel's hand.
Afterwards Dean and Castiel sat out in the warm late September evening on the hood of the Impala, sharing an order of fries and winding down from the hectic atmosphere of the busy bar.
"I'm sorry, Dean." Sam said, his voice genuine. "I shouldn't have just assumed you wouldn't want to keep in touch. I was just…I was free. Finally. And I was
A jolt of uncertainly shot through him, warring with the pleasure that was singing in his blood, and a memory came, unbidden, into his mind.
Dean's head snapped up in a way that Sam was sure had hurt, but he just stared at Sam, fear clouding his green eyes.
Cas, definitely Cas. So why didn’t he know what a demon was when he saw one? Dean opened his mouth but no words came out. What was he supposed to say?
In the meantime, I have begun a new story (it's mostly written so it won't interfere with this one). It's a Destiel AU and I will be updating it every Tuesday and it's called Let me See You Smile if you felt like checking it out :)
"So, Cas, what are you going to name your new pet?" Kevin, who had been helping to take care of the guinea pig before Christmas, asked.
For a moment, just a moment, Castiel forgot about everything else. Everything that had happened, the loss, the grief, all of it just faded away and he felt…not exactly happy, but secure. Like maybe he would be okay. And that was a hell of a lot better than he had felt in a very long time.
"Actually you could have. That's mostly where I was expecting to wake up when I walked into your bar last night. If I woke up at all that was." The last portion of his statement was said so softly that Dean nearly didn't catch it and figured it wasn't something the other guy had planned to say out loud much less for Dean to hear.
The bunker was still and silent, the lights dim. The minute hand of the clock on the wall finished its hourly revolution, and the hour hand slid from two to three.
Dean's expression was dubious but he smiled and nodded, leaning over to place a soft kiss on Cas' mouth. He shut his eyes and relaxed into the arms of the angel who held him. It was all still there, the pain of his father's betrayal and the shame of his own weakness. It was a constant presence, a part of him that he knew would never fully leave. But here, in Castiel's arms, it felt...distant. Here he was safe. Here he was loved. Here his nightmares couldn't touch him. Not so long as he had his angel to watch over him.
Sam looked over at his brother; who was still concerned with his safety, despite everything he was going through. He smiled and nodded.
"Look man, I don't even know how you managed to keep that secret for as long as you did and I can't even begin to understand how hard it was for you to tell me and Bobby about it, but you have got tell Cas, man. Aside from the fact that he deserves to know what he's getting into, I really think it'll help you."
He wrapped the pen in the paper and threw it to the witch who caught it deftly, scrawled something on it, and threw it back.
Something in the bowels of the car pinged and rattled and the speed gradually decreased until the vehicle sputtered and lurched and finally came to a stop.
He felt hands on him. Not Metatron's sweaty palms but his brother's strong hands as he pulled him upright, his voice a buzz in Dean's ears as he moaned from the pain the movement caused.
“I love you too Dean.” He answered, tilting his head back and leaning up to press a soft kiss against the other man’s lips.
This was all her fault. She was the one that wanted to tell Cas in the first place, the one who had blurted out that he was an angel.
Dean was humming as he re-stocked the bar fridge, soft tones mingling with the clinking of glass as he lined up the beer bottles, swiveling them so all the labels were facing the same way, the way Ellen liked them.
"Only because you didn't have a choice." Sam pulled back and grabbed hold of Dean's shoulders, staring him plain in the eye. "You're too good and selfless a person to let your little brother go cold and hungry. You have sacrificed so much for me, even when I wasn't even asking you to. You're a good person and you deserve all the love you can get and don't you let anyone, including yourself, tell you otherwise."
Sam shook his head and went back to his research, pouring over every book the bunker had on angels in an attempt to gain any information that might help Castiel.
The man behind the desk stayed stoic, only a shake of the head dismissing his guesses. Cas dropped his head into his hands, elbows resting on the counter as he searched for something, anything, divine intervention even, that might lead him to the right name.
Unfortunately, there was still Constantine to find and she wasn't talking so they hauled ass back to the bunker where the locals weren't too pleased with Dean's idea of using torture to find the wayward Constantine and any other possible walking bombs. He'd been forced to surrender his angel blade at the door on the basis that his own initiative might have a negative effect on the locals. Apparently angels weren't trusted with free will. In fact, Hannah had insisted on sitting in on the interrogation, until she went off on the reaper for implying Cas didn't feel he could trust her and thought her weak and really, this whole Castiel worshiping business was really starting to bug the crap out of Dean.
"You're... noticing this now?" he asked, he glanced over at Muriel and…Dean, anger rising as he realized Theo was looking out for no one but himself. "You were more than willing to do his dirty work." The last words were spat out with venom.
He paused, his demeanour serious and he licked his lips before taking in a breath and saying, "I myself have struggled to come to terms with my own sexuality and my choice to hide it for as long as did I think ended up doing more harm than good. I hid it because I was afraid of what people would think; not just the general public, but my friends and family. I didn't grow up in a particularly accepting home, my father was about as tolerant as you would expect an ex Vietnam vet and marine to be and there was really only one way a man could be in his eyes and I guess I carried that with me even after he died." He cleared his throat again and began fiddling with the hem of his shirt as he continued, "I realized I was bisexual quite early on I think but it was never something I acknowledged, even to myself. And that ended up hurting a lot of people. People I cared for, people I loved. And it ended up hurting me too so I think the best way is just to accept it. Accept yourself and love yourself and if the people around you can't or won't do the same, you have to decide how important they are to you in your life. And if those people are your parents...it's tough, I know. I never had a chance to come out to my dad. And I'm not sure what would have happened if I had. But you know, my dad had this friend. And we used to stay at his house all the time when my dad didn't have enough money to feed us or afford a motel or when he was so drunk he couldn't take care of himself. And about a month ago I told him I was bi and you know what he said? He said 'that's great boy, now get back to work 'cause that corn won't shuck itself.'"
. What claim did she have to him just because they’d shared an admittedly heated kiss once that Dean had still never managed to wipe from his brain?
Dean's anger continued to grow as Cas rattled on about bees and Meg's beauty and cat penises and some dude called Metatron until Dean and Meg began yelling at one another and he decided to go on a little trip to the dayroom, breaking the tablet in the process.
Cas shook his head as Dean rubbed calming circles on his back, clearly prepared for a panic attack, which Castiel had had on occasion.
Also, I'm trying to flesh out some chapters between now and the end so if anyone has any Destiel scenes that they'd like to see, drop me a line or a review and let me know and I'll see if I can incorporate any of them. I'm thinking of doing christmas and maybe Dean's birthday.
Yes, he was angry. Furious. The fear of Castiel leaving had been haunting him since this whole relationship started. But why did he have to yell like that? And at Cas! As his rage began to dissipate, a horrible, nauseous, creeping sensation began to make its way up his spine and into his belly. What had he done? He eyed the staircase. Should he go after him? Apologize? Beg for forgiveness?
"Good." He said before moving out and searching for the hunters to inform them of the witch's quest.
"Yeah." he answered concisely, clearing his throat at the awkwardness of the conversation. He stood and stalked out of the room.
"Because Sam's in no state to go hunting." he explained, sending an apologetic glance Sam's way. He pulled up a chair and sat down facing the former angel who was studiously avoiding Dean's gaze. "But you already knew that." He sighed, "What's going on Cas?"
“Because of me!” Dean started at the anger and pain in the angel’s voice, “Everything, all these people. I shouldn’t be here.”
Once Dean was clean and he and Cas were seated around the table, he bit into his burger asking, "How was your day?"
Still, a part of Dean didn't want the man to go walk out of his life. There was just something about him. Something that intrigued Dean, infused his ordinary mundane life with some much-needed colour and light.
The door to the motel room burst open and Dean came barging in, angel blade at the ready but Ephram sent him careening into the wall with an idle gesture where he crumpled and lay still.
Dorothy sighed and her face told Cas she could likely get in real trouble for this but before he could protest, her expression hardened into a look of determination and she nodded, a small, mischievous smile curling the corners of her mouth.
Dimly, he registered a bright blast of light in a far off corner of the warehouse accompanied by a rush of wind and then Castiel was standing there, hearing Sam cry heart wrenching sobs while cradling his brother's bloody body.
"I dunno. I guess." Dean felt a blush creep up his neck to heat his face. He'd never thought of his sexuality in those terms, preferring instead to ignore any urges towards his own gender in favour of those towards the opposite. He and Sam had never had to define their sexualities; at least not to each other. But now, with the cat out of the bag, it felt oddly…satisfying to label it, it made the whole subject seem less intimidating somehow.
"Then there was this girl…Robin. She was nice, pretty, interesting. She kissed me and at first I was so scared and confused. But it was nice and I enjoyed it and I figured hey, if I like guys and girls then maybe I could just focus on the girls and everything would be fine you know? Girls are…safe. And I could prove to dad that I wasn't…that it was just a phase and everything would be fine."
"I've explained in detail. I don't know how Metatron's spell worked. Therefore, I can't assist in reversing it. I was an unwitting accomplice."
"But he was also your carer," Cas contested, "burdened with the task of protecting you. Think about how young he was when he first started looking after you all on his own. Eight? Nine? It is something Dean has been doing almost his entire life and it has become an integral part of who he is. I have seen his thoughts and feelings towards you in times of great danger and distress and they are comparable to that of a parent and their child. It is not a habit to be broken, Sam. It is instinct."
"Hi Dean," the speaker was a girl, young by the sound of her voice, and obviously nervous to be speaking, "I'm gay and it hasn't been an easy thing for me to deal with, I'm just wondering what sort of advice you would give to your fans who are maybe struggling with their sexual identity and having a hard time coming to terms with that."
He looked over to see Bobby sitting stock still on the coffee table, his expression mirroring the anger Sam was feeling.
“No.” Dean answered, keeping his eyes on the road and refusing to look at his brother and the pitying expression he knew he would see in those eyes, “It never came up.”
"Then I will come." He turned to Sam and Jody. "I know you may not like it, but I would suggest calling Crowley. He is much more familiar with the pagans than I."
The hunter scoffed and crossed his arms, clearly indicating the myriad of problems he had with this plan.
Dean looked between his partner's exuberant expression and Sam who was desperately trying to contain his mirth.
"Hey." Sam answered back, concern for his brother shining through his own off-hand tones. "The meeting finished pretty quick after you left. Do you want to do a little digging? Or do you want to go back to the motel?"
His voice was thick with sleep and he looked to Sam like an overgrown child waking their parents up after a nightmare.
"Definitely took more than one or two killers to pull this off." he agreed, taking in the scorched wing marks; much smaller than those of other angels he'd seen, a sign of their low ranking as Cas had explained.
"Dean, without my powers, I'm no use to you." he said softly, his eyes fixed on the table as he traced the patterns in the linoleum.
"Yes." Cas hissed as Dean began prodding his ribcage, making sure none of them were cracked or broken, "It was fortunate that I found some change on the ground with which to make a phone call."
"But it was your job, right?" the younger Winchester threw back. "To protect the garden? To protect God's finest creation? Nice going."
Nausea rose as his stomach churned and he fought not to look round at the angel, to assess his reaction. As it was, he was having a hard enough time not prodding the connection for more information as Metatron continued in his whiney, annoying speech.
“I don’t know. Sometimes he gets this look in his eyes, like he’s remembering something. And when he does he looks so…sad. And it kills me because no matter how much I want to, I have no idea how to help him. So all I can do is love him and wait until he’s ready to tell me. And if he’s never ready…I guess loving him will have to be enough.”
Castiel exchanged pleasantries with Kevin and his mother and even Crowley, despite the awkwardness of it. Then again, everyone had been a little awkward around Crowley since he'd been cured. The former demon kept mostly to himself, holed up in his room. Occasionally he would emerge for food or a book but even then he was subdued.
Dean pulled away and lifted his hand to Cas' cheek, trying to ignore the pallid cast of his skin as he fixed him with his gaze.
From the corner of his eyes, Cas saw movement, a glint of silver, and Dean slid the angel blade across the linoleum. Quick as a flash Cas caught it in his good hand and then he was driving it into Ephram's belly. The Rit Zien screamed, light pouring out of his eyes and mouth as he died.
"'M pois'n." he slurred, placing a hand on Sam's other shoulder to keep himself upright. "Don' need me. Mush 'appier withou' me."
"Just in case you end up coming with us on hunts." Dean said by way of explanation, then added with a smirk, "Maybe this time we'll actually get a suit that fits you."
"'M drunk?" he asked, stumbling over the front stoop of the bar. Dean reached out a hand to catch his fall.
Dean nodded. He knew there was nothing else to do. There was no way to contact Cas and he couldn't keep driving around with Sam in the state he was. He started the car and pulled out onto the road, heading for Lebanon, Kansas and hoping that wherever he was, Castiel was doing the same.
Dean looked back at him and smiled, nodding, relaxing at the sight of one of the few people he trusted the most hovering above him with concern shining in his deep blue eyes.
Dean huffed out an annoyed breath and crossed his arms, looking away, his forehead creased as he pierced the wall with a mighty frown.
"Yeah, well, I guess that's what happens when you fall in love with an angel. Not really surprising though, given our lives."
Eventually, after a few minutes, Sam, fishing for a new conversation topic asked, "So, how's the angel situation, Cas?"
"For not reaching you sooner. And for sending you in to torture Alastair and do our dirty work, I can't believe now that I was ever that cold and unfeeling." He stroked a thumb over the scruff on Dean's cheeks and shook his head, "And I'm sorry for leaving. I promised you that I would spend the rest of my life proving to you that you are worthy of love. And I broke that promise. I know how little you think of yourself, and I also know that it is not your fault. I didn't just come back because you begged and apologized. I came because I realized I made a mistake when I left. I came back because I choose to be with you. Because I want to. Because I love you. And because you are worth it. I am sorry because I should not have walked out. I should not have taken your words to heart. Yes, they hurt terribly, but deep down I always knew they were untrue."
Dean hesitated, as though he wanted to continue arguing, but eventually he too nodded and glanced down at the sandwich and back up at Cas.
“Why not.” It wasn’t impossible. It couldn’t be. They were the Winchesters. They pointed and laughed at the impossible.
He wasn't sure why he had volunteered the information, nor why that particular fact about himself should be the one that sprung to mind first. He felt a familiar sense of mild anxiety fill him as he thought about the fact that he had blabbed about his past, the past that he had determined to keep buried. For a moment he toyed with the idea of perhaps telling Dean everything…immediately panic began to rise as his heart rate sped up and his breathing began to quicken. He scrapped the idea. He just wasn't ready. Perhaps one day he would be.
Dean grabbed his hands, which were dancing agitatedly over his cheeks and through his hair, and smiled through the tears.
"Before, when I became human, I always had the hope that I might one day restore my grace. It wasn't a great hope, and for the most part I was content to live out my life as a human, especially since Dean and I..." He sighed and rubbed tiredly at his eyes. "But there was a chance, there was still hope that my grace was still out there."
"What? Dad goes off hunting on his own the minute you leave for Stanford and you go and change your number and don't call for years? What the hell was I supposed to think?" His voice had risen as he spoke, and it cracked embarrassingly. His face coloured at the unwarranted emotional outburst and he fought to keep his face blank.
Dean shot Sam a look and Cas frowned in the younger Winchester's direction as Bonny practically vibrated with excitement at the prospect of new recruits and left to get the paperwork.
"Okay, you got a former demon and a former angel living with you guys and from the looks of it you," she pointed at Dean, "are in love with one of them." She frowned, "There's a sitcom in there somewhere…"
Dean stood once the song faded out and pressed pause on the machine before turning to Cas with a tentative look.
"Okay." He finally conceded, and Dean smiled and pecked him on the lips in response, clapping him on the back as he stood.
Cas looked up into Dean's eyes, he saw fear and concern and love radiating from them and his head swam as another dizzy spell overtook him.
Sam took in a deep breath and relaxed back against the bed, letting his gaze wander up to the plain white ceiling.
"Cas? No, no Cas!" The angel didn't respond and the presence in his mind began to grow fainter and fainter. Dean looked upwards, shouting at the roof of the dilapidated warehouse, "You listen to me you sons of bitches! Cas just saved all of you! He gave you your home back! And you're just going to sit back while he dies? Is that it? Come on! Goddamn it! Come on!"
"No, you shouldn't." she said softly. "You shouldn't have had to do any of that. Just like Dean shouldn't have had to hide it or gone through it at all. All of this is on your father. None of it is on either of you."
"Cas? What's wrong?" he asked, concern colouring his tones as he laid his hand on the other man's shoulder.
"I'll – I'll need a moment to make contact." he said, rubbing his abused wrists while Theo unchained his ankles and stood back. "And you have something that I'll need."
He looked down, sliding back, away from Dean and towards the other end of the sofa, wrapping his arms around his knees and curling himself up into a ball.
"Oh, you didn't know? A host of angels died when they fell – Azrael, Sophia, Ezekiel, 'died' doesn't even describe it. Devastation. Wings shredded, unspeakable agony at your hands. So, I think you would want to provide any information you have, considering..."
But he'd told Sam, told him about how he 'felt'. He had said enough to placate his brother, like he always did, so why were those words still rolling around in his head?
"I have been ready since I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition." he said in his low, gruff voice. He was looking down on Dean with an intensity in his eyes, his hair mussed from Dean running his fingers through it, and he looked so much like he did that first night in that barn that Dean half expected a flash of light to cast the monstrous shadows of his wings on the walls behind them. But there was no flash of light, only Cas, lowering his face down for one last sweet kiss before kneeling back and uncapping the small bottle.
They were in some kind of warehouse, dank and damp. They had been there for hours now, longer, depending on how long they had been out for, and the sounds of screams and whips could be heard echoing through the stone and metal walls. It reminded Dean uncomfortably of Hell.
That was why he was leaving Cas behind. Because it was too hard, too painful to see the shell of the angel who had been his friend, his saviour, literally, reduced to an unresponsive empty vessel.
Castiel hadn't succeeded, just as Dean hadn't succeeded in preventing Sam from completing the final trial. Cas hadn't stopped Metatron.
The voice was horse and gruff and so utterly familiar that it took Dean a moment to register what it signified. As it was, the sound of it shocked him so much he ceased crying and, with his heart pumping and blood rushing in his ears, he sat up, his eyes skimming the bed and desk and floor until they came to rest on a pair of booted feet. His eyes traveled upward, taking in the dark slacks and tan coat and white shirt that still lacked a tie until he was staring up at Castiel standing in the doorway to their room, his manner calm and collected as it always was.
He turned, opening the door and allowing Castiel back into the room, leaving Crowley to ponder his words.
"Come on." he said encouragingly, guiding the nearly unconscious man to the bed. Cas moaned something unintelligible and Dean settled him under the covers, slipping in beside him.
"He's looking at you being all cuddly with your boyfriend." Came a gruff, accented voice from the kitchen door. Dean turned to see Crowley making his way over to the coffee machine, "About damn time too."
"Are you sure you can trust her? I mean if it was your grace that cast them out, don't you think some of them'll be pretty pissed at you?"
"Nah, I'll get it." Cas insisted, hopping off his stool and chugging the last of his beer, nearly overbalancing as he turned and set the empty bottle on the table, "You know, I've never done this." he said with excitement in his eyes.
"So Kevin translated the tablet into cuneiform?" Cas asked as Dean pulled out of the gas station, having been updated on the goings on at the bunker.
Dean stood for a moment frozen while his brain attempted to sort through the sensory overload when one thing pushed its way to the forefront of his mind.
"That w's nice of you, Dean." he said, his words beginning to slur together. "You're a nice brother. And a nice b'yfrien'."
Crowley frowned up at him, more surprise at the gruff hunter speaking to him at all than confusion at what he was saying.
"Hello?" Dean called as they made their way into the main room from the garage, "Kevin? Mrs. Tran? Crowley?"
Sam felt his heart break for his brother and then swell with pride at the thought of how strong he was to have survived it.
“What if no one is listening? What if all your praying is in vain? What if there’s actually nothing?”
"He'll live." Dean said tiredly, dropping onto the bed beside Castiel, who had already changed into his pyjamas and was sitting propped against the headboard staring at his hands in silence.
Castiel stood stock still as one by one the angels who had followed him faithfully for the past countless months filed out of the room, leaving himself and the two Winchesters alone in the once bustling room.
Then breathing became too hard and holding himself up became too much as more and more blood spilled from the gaping hole in his chest and he felt his body tip sideways, crashing to the ground as his senses began to fade.
As Dean entered the kitchen, he caught sight of his brother conked out at the table, head resting on one outstretched arm, Crowley sitting at the other end. Dean held a finger to his lips to shush them and then grabbed a bowl and a cup of coffee, moving silently toward the table before plunking the bowl down loudly beside Sam's head. Sam jumped in his seat and Dean snickered as he sat down.
"You cannot abide others giving their lives for you and yet you are willing to sacrifice yourself at the drop of a hat."
"God Jimmy, where have you been? We were so worried about you, how could you just up and leave like that? After everything that happened?"
"It is something Sam explained to me. He said that there are widely accepted rules of society and then there are 'Rules-'"
"MIA." Dean tried to cover the tremor in his voice with a cough but Sam could tell his brother was worried about the angel. "Last I saw him he was going to confront Metatron. Looks like it didn't go well."
Soon the guy was buckled in the front seat and they were on the road back to Dean's place, the stranger passed out against the passenger side window.
Castiel stared at Dean for another long second before nodding and disappearing in a ruffle of invisible wings.
"Sort of." Dean answered and Sam raised his eyebrows in an unspoken invitation for Dean to elaborate. The older Winchester sighed and sat back in his chair, tapping his hand on his legs and averting his eyes.
"I was an angel when I said that Dean. Life meant something very different to me then. As did death."
Sam could see fondness in his brother's eyes as he talked about Mike, his lips twitched as though he wanted to smile.
The feed shut off and Castiel turned to find every angel in the compound staring at him. Waiting for him to reassure them. Or give them a reason to leave.
"You will never get away with this." Castiel's voice trembled as he strained against the cuffs, desperate to get this over with so he could find Dean and reassure himself that the hunter was okay.
“Yeah, I do. It’s strange, I mean, you know me, I don’t trust anyone who isn’t here now and yet, this…stranger walks into my life and I just…couldn’t let him walk out.” Dean sighed. “I love him.”
Dean trailed off, his breathing quickening as memories assaulted him and his voice died in his throat. He shut his eyes, squeezing as though that would banish them. He jumped when he felt a hand on his shoulder and his eyes snapped up. Castiel's concerned gaze was staring back at him.
Cas felt Dean's breathing slow as he drifted into sleep and he tightened his hold. It terrified him sometimes, the depths of his feelings for the man he held in his arms. That had been his downfall after all, that he had begun to love Dean over all else, over loyalty, over duty, over the greater good.
A thought occurred to Castiel as he ruminated on what he knew of Dean's life. No parents, a brother away at school, he really only had Ellen and Jo and Ash to talk to and interact with on a daily basis. Dean had said himself that he didn't do well on his own and that being with Cas made him feel less isolated. Perhaps Dean needed Castiel as much as Castiel needed Dean. Perhaps this was the answer: two broken halves coming together to make some semblance of a whole. A new life, a new start. A chance to wipe the slate clean and start over; to move on from the past without forgetting what he was leaving behind.
"Don't get the door for me or anything." she teased as she moved to leave. "Oh, and Dean." she said, turning in the doorframe, "You won't forget…"
As Sam continued to glare at him with his patented bitch face, Dean felt the weight of the past few, well, decades settle on his shoulders and weigh him down. He felt exhausted. Not only physically, but mentally. This is why he didn't confront his demons, they were so many and not the type that were easily taken care of with a simple exorcism or an introduction to Ruby's knife. These were the types of demons Dean was really, truly afraid of. The ones he couldn't fight.
The words were sappy but, spoken in Castiel's candid manner, cut right through the layers of bullshit that Dean had wrapped around his heart and he couldn't help leaning down and kissing the fallen angel. It wasn't a heated kiss, full of want and desire; it was soft, tender, loving.
He turned back to Theo. "Well, it's, um, it's true. Metatron and I do have a working relationship." he said carefully. It wouldn't take much to deceive Theo, but his voice was shaking nonetheless – he was the only chance Dean had now and the more time that passed…
“You saw the demon’s true face.” Daphne was saying before turning to Dean, “Emmanuel has very special gifts.”
There was a round of applause and a few suggestive looks thrown his way that made Dean want to growl and show the girls his claim on the blue-eyed man, but he restrained himself.
"Sheriff Mills." He greeted. Crowley glanced up from his meal, an intense look in his eyes. "Hold on, Sam's here too."
Dean hummed in agreement with the former angel and then moaned in displeasure when he stood, ridding Dean of his head rest.
"The truth is…" he started and hesitated as his heart began to pound and his palms began to sweat and was he actually going to do this? He glanced over at Cas who was starting at him with open adoration and love expressed in his serene expression and Dean knew that no matter what he did, whether he talked or not, Cas and Sam would be there for him. He shifted in the cheap plastic chair and cleared his throat. "The truth is, when I was a teenager, I was…raped."
"Take care, Dean." She glanced over at Cas. "And hang on to this one. Angel or not, he's good for you."
"Everything all right?" he asked, moving to the bookshelf and replacing the book he held in his hand, perusing the shelves for another one. Kevin glared but the look lacked the heat that was usually there. He sat back and threw down his pen, leaning against the back of his chair.
Dean and Castiel were lounging; waiting for Sam to return with Charlie. Cas was seated at the head of the table on Dean's left, engrossed in a book on fifteenth century alchemy. Dean looked up from the computer, watching him, taking in his eyes as they followed the line of text, the furrow between his eyebrows as he poured all his concentration into the task, his nimble fingers as they moved up to his full, plump lips, a pink tongue darting out to wet them before lowering, sliding the milky page over and then shifting as he resettled in his seat.
Dean pulled the chair from the desk that sat in the corner of the room over and settled on it backwards, facing the bed.
Dean sat behind the wheel staring out at nothing and contemplating the amount of crap that life continued to throw at him.
Once Purah finished drawing the spell in the sandbox, it kicked up a maelstrom of heavenly light into which Cas and Gadreel stepped. Castiel held his breath as he was enveloped by the light, and he couldn't help the anticipation that kickstarted his heart pounding. He was going back to heaven. He was going home.
"Hey!" Dean's tone was sharp and, coupled with the anger that suddenly flared up, it had Cas raising his eyebrows at the hunter.
"But you two have had an entire lifetime to get accustomed to your humanity. I have not. You said so yourself, 'baby in a trench coat' remember?" he said angrily, brandishing the coat that looked so much like his last one.
Sam cut off, swallowing against the catch that had developed in his throat. He stood, a sudden burst of nervous energy catapulting him from the sofa and sending him pacing around the small cabin room.
"Eh, it'll do." he said, not willing to admit what he was actually thinking in front of his brother.
"So what about the whole 'I like frisky women' thing? Was that real? Or were you just so far inside the closet you were fighting the white witch with Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy?"
"You had one too many Daiquiris last night." he answered, grabbing the bottle of aspirin he'd retrieved and shaking out a few. "Here. Sit up."
Sam's statement wasn't quite true but Dean wasn't about to bring up the Christmas he'd spent with Lisa and Ben, aka the Christmas where he'd let them do their own thing, gone out, gotten wasted, and kicked down every angel in every nativity scene he'd come across on his long, unsteady way home. But now Sam was staring him with those eyes and he could feel his will crumbling.
And with that he stood, placed the dishes in the sink and walked out of the kitchen, leaving Dean holding the phone and contemplating his brother's words.
Dean looked up with tears welling in his eyes. He opened his mouth a few times but shut it again, his brow furrowing and his breathing still heavy.
"I am grateful for my life, I am. I am grateful for Dean, and you, and this bunker. But I still feel the loss, I still..." he trailed off, his shoulders drooping as he cupped the mug of steadily cooling milk.
Castiel looked up at her words and saw, behind her placid expression and kind eyes, soul deep pain that he recognized from seeing it staring back at him in the mirror every morning.
Cas shook head and stood, slipping his hand into Dean’s and followed him out onto the dance floor, moving in close and resting one hand on his shoulder, the other clasped in Dean’s as the horn section started off
"Cas, I was okay with it. Hell, I was more than okay with it, are you kidding?" he stopped speaking and stared into Castiel's earnest eyes, "I should be the one apologizing. If I weren't such an emotional mess—"
It was one of the memories he usually kept under lock and key in the very back of his mind, buried beneath layers of repressed emotion and borderline alcoholism. But now it surfaced and he tried to hold it back, tried to push it down to where it belonged, lost and forgotten. But it was no use.
Castiel's low voice pierced through the groggy veil of shallow sleep that Dean was drifting in, and he murmured an involuntary answer, brain bypassing his conscious mind, which was still very much asleep.
His brow furrowed and he worried his bottom lip with his teeth as he floundered in his mind for any inspiration from his pathetic knowledge (or lack thereof) of popular culture.
"When they say my name," he gasped, "perhaps I won't just be the one who let the serpent in. Perhaps I will be known as one of the many…"
"Yeah?" Crowley shot back, "Well you want him, you'll have to go through me. Now, I ask you again. Who the hell are you?"
The drive up to Bobby’s was largely uneventful, Castiel asked Sarah about her life, what had driven her to study art and later pursue a Masters in curatorship. She in turn told him about her mother and how she had been a fabulous painter and antique dealer.
"It's okay, Dean." he assured. "I know that you are still healing from what your father did to you. Just know that I am here, regardless of whether or not you feel comfortable pursuing a sexual relationship."
"That's bullshit! You know that! Mom would never be ashamed of you, of either of us, for something like that! Dad was just an asshole. A giant, worthless asshole who ruined our lives by dragging us along on his personal vendetta against the monster who killed his wife, all the while ignoring the only things he had left of her, us!"
"No, the motel I was staying in evicted me when I couldn't pay another night's rent. So I wandered until I got to the Roadhouse."
"For a human perhaps." He went back to staring sadly at the grey, concrete wall, "But I am not human. Not anymore. And yet I am no longer an angel either. But if I am to defeat Metatron, I feel I must think more like him and less like, well…you."
"Oh, I'm sorry!" she apologized, moving over and ringing everything up, "My date cancelled on me because I couldn't get a sitter," she sighed, "probably not worth the makeup anyway."
"Don't you ever go disappearing on me like that again," he said into the tan cloth of the angel's coat.
"Anyway. It took a great deal of effort to heal Dean, in both body and soul and when I finished a trace amount of my grace was left in him. Through it, he and I are connected, irrevocably. Even with mine gone, I can still feel the remnants in him."
An excited high-pitched squeal sounded from across the room and Dean pulled back to stare at Charlie who had her hand over her mouth to hide a beaming smile.
Castiel watched as Dean poured cream into his coffee and then picked it up, stirring it with a wooden swizzle stick as he blew on the hot beverage, and mimicked his every move. Dean lifted the stick out of his coffee and drew it across his tongue to divest it of any excess liquid in a move that entranced Castiel and sent strange shoots of heat through his body. Then Dean turned to the trashcan and aimed, tossing it and watching it sail through the air before it landed silently in the receptacle.
"Hello Castiel." he said in his calm, soothing manner, a trademark of the medics; calm in the face of all suffering.
He could hear Dean's shuddering breaths as he fought to get himself under control. Cas lowered himself to the ground a few feet away, trying not to crowd the panicking man and trying to figure out where he had gone wrong.
"Hey." He said, sitting forward in his chair and rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, "How're you feeling?"
"Jesus," Crowley said, running a hand over his face and through the beard that had grown on his cheeks in his inattention, "You need some serious lessons in pop culture, you know that?"
He looked up at Dean and felt, for the first time in nearly a year, his mouth relaxing into a smile. It was small and tempered by the sadness still present in his eyes, but it was something.
"Hey Dean?" Sam's words stopped him and he glanced back at his younger brother. "I'm really proud of you. That took a lot of guts and…I just— I'm proud of you."
"You're an angel." Cas commented, feeling a jolt of bittersweet elation at seeing one of his brethren after all these months. He gestured for Dean to stand down.
Dean could feel the truth of the words flowing through the connection with the angel and he found himself unable to answer as his throat closed up with emotion. Instead he merely nodded and laid his head back down on Cas' chest, allowing himself to drift as strong hands carded tenderly through his hair and Cas' heart beat out vibrations that shuddered through him.
Jody came for Christmas dinner bearing sweaters for everyone and an apple pie for which Dean gave her a kiss on the cheek. Introductions were made between her and the Trans, and then Cas had to proudly bring out his new pet, grinning like an idiot down at the small furry creature, which in turn also caused Dean to grin like an idiot. In fact, Sam and Dean had been grinning like idiots all day after Cas' not so little gift that morning.
Eventually, the small, furry animal fell asleep beneath Castiel's tender ministrations and the angel dropped him gently back into his cage before turning to Dean.
The voices were getting dimmer, silenced by the rush of emotion and he opened himself up to it. Tears were spilling from his eyes but he didn't care.
be coming back." And with that he turned and strode to the staircase, ascending it without looking back. "And don't bother praying!" he added. "No one will be listening!"
A moan from the bed interrupted their quiet discussion and all three glanced over just as Dean began whimpering and thrashing around in his sleep, clearly in the throes of some nightmare.
"At the time I thought I did. I did not question it. Now…" He shrugged looking more lost and confused than ever, "I am not sure what I believe. I have been resurrected time and again and I have come to believe it is a punishment, to be denied relief from the guilt of the things I have done, the mistakes I have made, the people I have hurt, killed." He turned his gaze on Sam, "But I would like to believe that my father has not truly abandoned us; that your second chance is a blessing and that despite all that has happened, he still with us, watching. I know that he would never have allowed Issac to die. And I would like to believe that despite everything, he still knows what is best. I would like to believe that but…"
"Hey." Cas answered, already a little tipsy from the one beer he was still working on, "You once told me that you don't choose what you do. It chooses you." He winked and Dean had to duck his head to keep from laughing out loud at his adorably tipsy boyfriend. "I'm a part of this." he said, clinking his bottle with Dean's. "Like it or not."
"No it's…good. Calming. It's nice to feel useful and needed. To have a purpose." His gaze drifted, "And the routine of it. It keeps my mind focused and not preoccupied with…other thoughts." He refocused his gaze on Dean, "Besides, yesterday I had nothing except the clothes on my back. Now I have a job, a place to live, a friend." His lips twitched as though they wanted to smile though his eyes remained sad, "I am truly and forever indebted to you Dean Winchester."
His grace was fading. He could feel it ebbing away bit by bit every time he expended any sort of power and he knew it wouldn't be long before it faded out completely and took him with it. It was one thing to extract an angel's grace the way Metatron had Castiel and Castiel had Theo, taking it all at once. So long as the initial wound was healed, the angel could live, his consciousness taking over the vessel he inhabited. But the way Cas had taken his, forcing another angel's grace into his fallen vessel, if he did not remove it, it would burn out and destroy him.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Sam interrupted, holding up a hand, "Spoilers. I haven't read all the books yet."
And then he was surrounded by warmth, two strong arms encircling him. Sam's long hair tickled his cheek as his brother pulled him in tight.
For a long time Castiel had been baffled by the behavior. After all, why would one want to misdirect one's own emotions? Why did humans never say what they felt? But after over a week of being human, Castiel had come to see that emotions were perplexing and intense and, more often than not, upsetting and, though humans had a lifetime to learn how to interpret and deal with them, perhaps not all succeeded. Perhaps Dean had never learned to deal with the deeper more complex ones.
"Just that, maybe if you actually talked about what’s going on instead of ignoring it, you might end up feeling better for once."
He could still hear them, the words rattling around in his head as though Ellen herself had spoken them and not the creepy tour guide who had grabbed Dean's arm without his say so. No man grabbed Dean without his permission. Except Sam and Bobby and, until recently, Cas.
Sam closed his eyes and let out a frustrated sigh. Of course Dean hadn't talked to Cas and of course Cas would blame himself for not knowing what to do. It was a wonder the two of them had made it this long.
When Castiel had come out to his family, Charlie had been the first he'd told and the first to stand by him, so it was only natural that a year later she'd confided in him her own emerging sexual identity and how afraid she was to tell anyone else. Castiel had assured her he would stand by her no matter what and though she had ended up telling Gabriel, Anna and Inias, he didn't actually know if she had ever come out to her oldest brothers. Judging by the shocked look on Michael's face, she hadn't.
Dean turned, hefting his overnight bag, and made it about two steps before he collapsed to the ground.
“Yes.” He confirmed, “Just so long as I’m not around for it.” He turned his head to stare out the window at the passing scenery, ending the conversation.
Dean's phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket, glancing at the caller ID but didn't recognize the number. He answered.
Castiel regarded the swing set from his seat in the car with trepidation, unsure whether or not his new ally was entirely reliable. Or sane for that matter.
"Hey, how's it going in here?" Sam asked, entering the room with Castiel right behind him bearing a tray piled with sandwiches.
"Cas." Dean breathed as he threw down the file and tore out of the station seeing clearly in his head the same truck parked right beside his baby in the parking lot of the motel where he'd left Cas. Alone.
Dean looked over, sadness shining in his emerald eyes. His sigh was bone weary and he blinked, his eyelids heavy with exhaustion.
Once Castiel was finished explaining that they were dealing with a Rit Zien and what exactly that was and what he was, in all likelihood, doing here, Dean sat back in the leather seat, trying to digest the information.
“Nah, gonna sit out here for a bit longer. Maybe see if I can find where Cas went off to, make sure he’s all right.”
"It was getting so cold and you were so hungry and I…I tried hustling some pool. Anywhere they'd let me in with my crappy fake ID, but there still wasn't enough for rent and food so I went to the motel manager. Ugly overweight guy who smelled like cheese and BO, and I begged him to let us say. Threw every sob story I could think of at him. But he wouldn't bite. So finally I…I said I'd do anything. Anything. And he got this look in his eyes, this self-satisfied smirk, like he'd got me. Like he was better than me and he knew it. And then he sat back and undid his pants. He gave us a whole month rent-free, and every night I went to bed feeling dirty and sick to my stomach. And I knew I had no one to blame but myself."
"You did not deserve what that bastard did. You are not responsible for the fact that he was an abusive jackass, and you are not any weaker because of it."
The man lifted his head slowly, his eyes barely open and his hair sticking up where it had been resting on his arms. He moaned, swaying in his seat. Dean had seen enough drunks in his time to know that there was no way this guy was getting home on his own.
"All right, well, then, in that case, we have to figure out, uh, who are we up against, what do they want, and how do we stop them." Sam commented, taking a pull from his bottle of beer
Dean sighed, the uncertainty in his eyes that was usually so well hidden making him look much younger and more vulnerable than usual.
After the events of that morning, Dean had been rather subdued, lounging around and watching Die Hard with Cas until the angel had announced that he was making dinner and that maybe it would do Dean some good to go out and get some fresh air. Some fucking freezing fresh air.
"No, no, Dean." Cas said, scooting down so he was lying facing the other man, reaching out to run his fingers along Dean's cheek, "It's my fault. I should have been paying more attention to you."
"Jesus, those guys really did a number on you huh." He asked, prompting Cas to lie back against the pillows as he checked for injuries.
Dean nodded and grabbed the angel's toothbrush, smearing some toothpaste on it and wetting it before handing it to Cas.
"Uhhh, may have gone a little overboard." He explained, scratching the back of his head as Cas frowned down at the object, "But, well, I hope you like it."
"Uh, hard to say, exactly." Dean hedged, "Yeah. Sex has always felt, I don't know, good, you know? I mean, really, really good." Sam glared and Dean remembered who he was talking to, "Uh...But, uh... Sometimes, it just makes you feel bad, you know? You're drunk. You shack up. Then, it's the whole morning thing. You know, 'Hey, that was fun'. And then, 'adios,' you know? Always the 'adios'. But, you know, when you get down to it, what's the big deal, right? I mean, sure, there's the touching and the feeling all of each other, my hands everywhere, tracing every inch of her body, the two of us moving together, pressing and pulling... Grinding. Then you hit that sweet spot, and everything just builds and builds and builds until it all just..." Dean trailed off.
"Saving the world, right? It's what we do. It's what we always do. I always knew I'd go out like this. Why not now?"
Crowley showed no signs of attempted suicide as the days passed and eventually he was left to his own devices once more, albeit with a markedly improved number of visitors and invitations to join in the various gatherings about the bunker, if only so they could keep a better eye on him.
He remembered that moment when he'd looked out of the window and caught sight of Sam hanging out of the of the Impala, playing with the plastic plane that Dean had gotten for him out of the charity present box last Christmas (he didn't consider it stealing, after all the presents were for children who needed them and Sammy had definitely needed, no, deserved a present).
"You know, Cas, are you sure you're ready to jump back into all this? I mean, I know I've been dragging you along on cases but, this is angels, man." Dean didn't want to admit it, but he had been more than a little shaken by the violence of the crime scene they had just visited. These were the same angels who had been tracking Cas, who were out for his blood, who wanted to punish him for destroying heaven and use him to find a way to restore their home. Despite the Enochian warding, Dean was nervous bringing Cas so close to the fray. If anything happened to him…
"Yeah, more or less. It was a farm, and the guy who ran it, Sonny, he uh, you know, looked after me."
They lay in silence for a while after that, Dean dozing in and out of consciousness, Castiel ruminating over Dean's promise.
"Can you save Cas?" Dean's voice was trembling and his eyes were intense as he stared at the resurrected angel.
Dean immediately regretted his outburst when Cas bowed his head, looking like a kicked puppy whose favourite teddy bear had just been stolen, but he couldn't let go of his anger.
Without a word, Dean retrieved the bottle of painkillers from his bedside table along with his glass of water.
A noise alerted him to a nearby phone booth that stood defaced and decrepit on the curbside and when Dean got there he saw Castiel, bruised and bleeding, slumped in the corner.
“By the way, this is my way of saying I love you.” Dean said softly into his ear as they danced cheek to cheek. He felt something wet against his face and knew that Cas was crying.
"Good." Dean said, standing and clapping his new employee and roommate on the shoulder before clearing the table.
"Cas I-" I love you. The words caught in his throat. He knew they were true but he just wasn't ready to say them out loud. The only person he'd ever said them out loud to before had been his mom. He cleared his throat to cover up the pause and said instead, "Thanks." It was lame and a cop out but Castiel smiled up at him anyway.
"It's taking virgins who break their chastity vow." He looked over at Cas and Dean. "So dragons are off the list."
"Moose." he said softly, and without his usual grit, "What brings you to my neck of the art deco bunker?"
Dean was proud of the fact that he managed to not wet himself once that particular speech was done. He had been privy to his share of macho posturing but that, that was real.
"The witch, I clipped her with a poppy bullet but she has the key." He said, guilt and shame colouring his voice, "I think she's gone."
“Wait.” He pleaded, fishing the keys out of his pocket. He opened the trunk of the black Dodge Charger and pulled out the folded trench coat.
Yes, Dean was an actor. Yes it was his job to play parts and imitate emotion. But Castiel had gotten more than one glimpse behind the wall Dean erected to protect himself and in this moment, everything inside Castiel screamed that this was real. He felt a release of the anger and resentment he had been holding inside for the past three months and once it was gone, all that was left was longing and love.
"It's been a bad couple of days," he responded, his eye twitching involuntarily, "I haven't slept or eaten." The reached the bottom of the staircase and began moving towards Sam's room. "I'm pretty backed up."
He continued on, turned a corner, and came face to face with the one and only Wicked Witch of the West.
"This is a bonus, Castiel. We were tracking Muriel, cowardly holdout that she is," he glanced over at the beaten and bloody angel who was tied to a metal post along with Dean, "and wonder of wonders, she led us to you and your little pet."
Cas leaned against him, heads touching as he wrapped an arm around the other man. Dean smiled at the contact and brought his own arm up to rest over Cas' upper back, pulling him in closer as they continued to listen to the song.
"Cas' praying plan backfired. Got snatched by the dude leading one of the factions. Dick called Malachi. We were tortured."
"When Metatron had me he…downloaded his collected knowledge of human literature into my brain. I suppose he too was tired of me not understanding his references."
Raising his fist, he pounded on the door jam, yelling, hoping someone would be near enough to the entrance that they would hear and let him in.
He traced it idly with one finger, brushing over the five-pointed star before circling outwards over the sun that surrounded it.
"Now isn't the time!" Crowley interrupted, wiping the excess water from his face, "You have a wicked witch running around your precious bunker looking for a key!"
Cas straightened his position, raising his face up until his lips brushed Dean's. He smiled at the spark that shot through him as it always did when they kissed, and he allowed himself to be swept away by the wave of pleasure that flowed through him, opening himself up to the hunter and pushing in, hands tangling in hair as Dean's arms snaked around him, fisting the material of his overcoat and clutching possessively at him.
"Still weak, still gotta use this thing most of the time," He indicated the wheelchair, "but good. I seem to be healing on my own; I feel a little better each day."
Castiel stood in the centre of the department store taking in the massive selection of menswear and feeling hugely overwhelmed as he did so. There was so much choice, too much choice. His experience of humanity up until now had largely consisted of scrounging for the bare minimum and now here he was, rested and fed and preparing to pick out whatever clothes he wanted, and he suddenly had no idea what to do. He looked over at Dean who was watching him.
Dean shifted around to check the time. Seven thirty am. They had gone to sleep around eleven thirty the previous night which mean he had slept for eight hours. Eight hours of straight uninterrupted sleep. That had not happened in longer than Dean cared to remember. He was lucky if he could get through four hours without being woken by Sam or some catastrophe or a nightmare.
But he let Dean pick him out a suit anyway and while Dean was trying to decide between blue and black, Castiel fingered the tan overcoat on the mannequin he stood beside. It was similar to his old one but nicer, more fitted. Also it wasn't covered in blood, which was a plus. He missed his overcoat; missed what it had come to symbolize and the memories he had come to associate it with. He remembered when Dean had pulled it out of the trunk of his car after Castiel regained his memories. The way it had been washed and folded, taken care of, the last vestiges of Castiel Dean had to hold onto. He remembered the way Dean would sometimes straighten it when it had become disheveled because sometimes Castiel forgot about the cloths, they were just and extension of his vessel after all and a new concept to him. He remembered how it had felt like a safety blanket after he had taken on Sam's burden, when his mind was unstable, his thoughts elusive, forever flying away from him. He remembered using it to protect himself, arm himself as though, if he could wrap himself up in the old Castiel's coat, he could become that angel again, but better: more compassionate, more astute, less foolhardy.
As he scrawled his signature on the line beneath the pledge, he couldn't help but feel a little piece of the knot that was the secret of his father's violation, breaking off and leaving him feeling marginally lighter and perhaps one step closer to letting it all go.
Castiel glanced at Dean, enjoying the way his green eyes lit up with joy at the sight of his brother, before looking where Dean was waving to see a brunette head, towering over everyone else with a beautiful woman, also brunette, at his side.
The witness, 'Slim', yielded no definite answers, and so they decided to head over to the Good Faith Church to do some digging.
He took a deep, sated breath in and cast his gaze to the two massive wings that he could still see protruding from the angel's back. He still couldn't quite believe they were there. Dean knew Cas had wings of course, he'd seen the evidence that first night in the barn in Cas' display of his heavenly origin and again every time he popped in and out of his life without a word. But seeing them here, now, so real and vivid and close enough to touch…
"S-so…you wouldn't…you wouldn't care if I was…if I were g…gay?" the last word came out so softly that Bobby nearly didn't catch them. Dean turned his head and his eyes held such fear and pain. There was only one person who could instill this much fear in Dean.
"Lebanon." The answer came, still in that breathy hitched tone. Dean knew that tone. It was the tone of someone in pain, someone attempting to speak through waves of agony.
been easy. It had been the easiest decision he'd ever made. But at the same time it had been the most painful; tearing himself out of the life that had been given to him. Away from Sonny, away from Robin, away from his good grades at school and the stupid wrestling trophy which he left sitting on his bedside table. It had hurt so damn much.
He stumbled back, the stolen Grace merging with him, healing his injuries as it filled every inch of him, fusing with him, before pouring out in a blinding explosion of light. It dimmed and his eyes flashed blue and then Castiel, once more filled with the familiar thrum of divine power, looked up at the coward who had killed Dean and Muriel to protect his own hide, the coward who was gasping and bleeding against the wall. Castiel felt a righteous anger well up inside him, and without a moment's hesitation, he reached forward, clamped a hand to his forehead, and burned the life from him.
Castiel looked at him. He owed everything to this man who had taken him in and given without asking for anything in return. Who had respected his need for privacy and allowed Castiel to keep buried what he needed to keep buried.
"Then I'll protect you." he said with conviction. "I'm not gonna let anything hurt you. Besides, you helped us gank that ghost in New York last week."
He’d seen two of the defendants bump fists under the table when the sentence was passed. It made him sick and angry and so, so tired.
"No. You're in no condition to drive. And besides," he glanced down at the lock, "You're going to scratch her paint job."
The hunter glanced at his brother and Sam gestured leaving to which Dean nodded. Once they were alone, Dean pulled his chair around so he was sitting facing the angel, and rested a comforting hand on his shoulder.
"All right, come here, big brother." he hoisted Dean up and pulled his arm up and over his shoulder, bending down and grabbing Dean behind the knees and lifting him up into a fireman's carry.
His hands shook where they clutched the steering wheel. He could feel his brother's gaze on him like a spotlight. He could hear that guy's voice in his head, although it was starting to sound more like Ellen now. He could hear Bobby telling him he was being an idjit for not dealing with his crap. He could see Cas’ eyes lit with the holy fire that surrounded him staring at Dean as though Dean had been the betrayer. He remembered his dad yelling, hitting, tearing him open…
Once again, the cruel hand of fate had forced them apart but Castiel held firm to the faith he had in them. There would come a day soon when Castiel would come back with no intention of ever leaving. Of that he was certain.
As he stroked his fingers and thumb lightly up Dean's arm, he could feel the heat of the body pressed up against him. He could feel the life-giving breath as it rushed in and out of his lungs. The arms that he had wrapped around Dean tightened on their own accord and his oft-repeated promise to Dean came back to him.
"Your father was homophobic?" Cas asked softly and Dean looked up to find blue eyes staring at him as though he was the only thing in the universe. He sighed and nodded.
"Let's say you are telling the truth," she said distrustfully, "and Metatron tricked you. I should still turn you in."
The lights in the room were dim. Since the bunker had no natural light, all the lighting was on a timer to simulate the day/night cycle.
But when they reached the truck stop Cas had described for him, the former angel was nowhere to be seen.
"You know, we raced all the way here and now, I dunno. I can't say I'm fired up to see what's left of the guy."
"If this person you were speaking so eloquently about before were here now, telling you he was sorry too, that he loves you too, that he wants to spend the rest of his life with you," He answered, eyes locked with Dean's, "what would you do?"
Dean sighed impatiently and leaned back against the wall, tapping his head lightly against the concrete and screwing his eyes shut.
The angel moved to Sam’s bedside, sitting down and rolling up his sleeves. He glanced back at Dean and said cryptically, “It’s better this way.” He turned back to Sam, “I’ll be fine.”
"Hello?" he answered, hoping it would be some good news. He was not disappointed when his brother's voice sounded down the line.
He breathed as he spoke and took Dean's hand, gently bringing it up to his chest so he could feel Castiel's slow and steady breathing pattern. Occasional whimpers still escaped Dan's mouth but his breathing slowed eventually to match Castiel's, who continued to speak, directing his breath.
As a way to kill time while waiting for Charlie's program to decrypt the files, Dean, Cas, Charlie, Sam, and Kevin had all piled into Sam's room to marathon the first few episodes of Game of Thrones. Dean, Cas, and Charlie ended up on the bad, Castiel sandwiched in between the hunter and the nerd but soon found himself pulled into Dean's side, head resting on his shoulder and snuggled in close to his side with Charlie throwing them the same look she got every time she saw an adorable cat video. Cas didn't seem to notice and Dean pretended not to see.
Sam's bottom lip trembled and his face screwed up as a sob fell from his throat and Dean pulled him into a tight hug as a torrent of tears began to fall from his brother.
Sam glanced around and his eye caught on a small metal garbage can, which he managed to grab and shove in front of him before Dean retched. Sam took a seat beside his brother, rubbing his back as the booze Dean had been putting back all night made its reappearance. Dean had likely been drinking on an empty stomach since Sam had noticed a significant drop in his brother's eating habits lately. This was getting ridiculous, this forced separation, and Sam rubbed tiredly at his eyes as Dean continued to vomit. That was it, tomorrow he was going to sit his brother's stubborn ass down and force him to call Castiel. None of this 'I'm not worthy' bullshit.
Dean drained the last sip from his bottle and glanced over where Cas was getting their round, grinning as he watched him lean against the bar and wave politely to someone, a goofy smile on his face. He turned back, setting the bottle down and playing with the label as he avoided his brother's eyes.
Dean shied away from the touch, breaths turning to gasps as his body shook. He whimpered out a litany of, "No, no, no, please, no."
Besides, what was he waiting for? For Castiel to come waltzing back through the door, saying everything was fine, Metatron was taken care of, Heaven was restored, the angels were home and he was Dean's until their dying day?
“If you heard what I just said to Sam then you heard me saying that I don’t care. I mean sure, I’d love to know about you, I want to know everything about you. But I also know that you’re not ready and that’s okay.”
Once the paper had fallen clean of the box, he stared at the gift, eyes wide and mouth open as honour and disbelief wafted through the connection.
The brakes squealed as Dean pulled the car onto the empty shoulder of the road and rushed out, slamming the door behind him as he stalked off towards the woods that lined the empty highway, feeling as though if he stayed any longer he would explode. Vaguely, he registered the sound of a car door slamming and heavy footfalls following him.
Dean scoffed and pressed a quick kiss to his hair before helping him stand and turning to his brother.
"I want to apologize." he said in a soft voice. "I know I can never make up for what I did, what I've done. And I don't expect you to forgive me. I just need you to know that I truly regret everything."
Their father had been a mean drunk. Never violent, at least not to Sam, but angry. When he drank, he raved and broke things. One time he had even gotten a hold of one of his guns and let off a shot before Dean had managed to disarm him. Sam had no illusions that his father had been a saint, but he'd at least buried the man believing he had been a good person who loved his sons in his own way.
Dean smiled at Castiel's formal way of speaking, and covered the hand that sat on his knee with his own before leaning in and pressing his lips to Cas'.
"Yeah, you know, the basics. I also picked up season one Game of Thrones figure we're due for a break after everything that happened, I thought we might order some takeout…"
It wasn't until they were back on the main road that Dean became aware enough of his surroundings to ask, "Where are we going?"
"No!" Kevin shouted, railing against the man. "Let me go! I need to protect them! I am the prophet!"
"All righty." She said, sitting back down and handing out three clipboards, "Just sign there and your purification can begin."
They ate in silence, Sam digging into the food and Dean picking at it as he drained three cups of the black liquid until he was sitting up straighter and looking marginally better. Sam cleared his throat and wiped his mouth, setting the napkin down and fixing Dean with a meaningful look.
And with that, Dean's brief flame of hope died. This was not Castiel. Not his Castiel. He fought the urge to sob and then break something because, of course. When did the universe ever do something nice for the Winchesters?
Sam stood in the empty library contemplating what he'd just learned. Why had his father lied to him? And if Dean had been in one place the whole two months, how come it had taken John Winchester that long to find him? He may have been an awful father but he had been a damn good hunter, surely it wouldn't take too much investigating to find his son - especially if the authorities had been involved. In fact, if Dean as a minor had been caught shoplifting, John would have been notified immediately. So why had it taken so long?
There seemed to be a certain poetic justice in asking for help fixing Sam from the very person who had broken him in the first place. Emmanuel was looking up at him again and Dean couldn’t help the well of emotion that swelled as he stared into those vivid blue eyes. Eyes that stared back with no recognition whatsoever.
No word came from Castiel and Dean was beginning to grow restless. He had had to practically dragged Sam to investigate the miraculous healing they had witnessed and managed to track down the girl Metatron had healed, speaking with her long enough to glean what he had whispered to her in the video - his next location - before she left, and then he and Sam had fought about what their next step would be. Dean wanted to investigate further, take the fight to Metatron but Sam had to go and be all reasonable, pointing out that Cas and Gadreel had a plan and that Sam and Dean were hideously outmatched now that Metatron was basically a demigod and it would be better all round for them to just go back to the bunker and wait it out.
Dean drove silently while Cas moved in close, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder and crying softly. Dean stretched his arm around the man, resting over the back of the bench seat, Cas always cried when he listened to the Beatles, having found the music to be cathartic.
It took Dean a few seconds to get his brain back online but when it did a jolt of guilt and embarrassment shot through him.
"Yes you are Dean." He spoke with such conviction that for a moment, Dean's heart skipped a beat. Castiel glanced away, looking like he was contemplating something, before turning back, "I have three older brothers." He whispered.
"So, since Castiel is going to be sticking around indefinitely are you going to tell him how you really feel about him so that you two can finally stop dancing around each other and save everyone having to watch you two eye-fucking every time you're together?"
Dean gave them a wave and smirked, turning back to Cas who had his face propped up on his hand, and his arm and most of his upper torso resting on the table.
His first instinct was to fight it. It felt wrong, somehow, to accept it and let it in. It was so pure and good and right, and he was so…sullied. But no matter how hard he tried to rail against it, it kept coming; a steady stream of unyielding adoration that was slowly filling him to the brim. He could hear his father yelling at him as he swung his fists drunkenly, uncaring about how much force he was putting into the blows. He saw Alistair's face, smiling smugly as Dean cut into his first victim, revelling silently in his small but vital victory.
He waited with bated breath, wondering who he would see shining out of those brilliant blue eyes: Emmanuel or Castiel.
"I didn't mean in a bad way. I just meant that I had no basis of comparison. I had no idea what the sensation meant only that I wanted to feel it again and again. So I asked that I be the one to approach you. And every time an opportunity came up to meet with you, I took it. I convinced my superiors that I was the best choice because you were distrustful of angels and I was familiar to you – and that was true – but mostly I just wanted to be near you. So I could continue to experience that sensation I felt whenever I was around you."
The archangel sighed, his shoulders slumping. If Castiel had still been able to see his wings, he was sure they too would be sagging under the weight of the task ahead. His gaze averted, studying the floor.
"I will miss your PB&Js Dean." he said with such conviction and love that Dean had to pause for a moment. He cleared his throat to rid himself of the lump that was forming there because he was not going to go and get all sentimental over a fucking sandwich.
Once their teeth were brushed and mouths rinsed, Dean smiled and turned to Cas. He brought his hand up to the other man's newly shaven cheeks, running his thumb over the smooth skin and leaning down to press their lips together. They kissed for a few minutes, tongues exploring each other's mouths before Dean trailed off, kissing a line down Cas' jaw and neck to a spot just under Castiel's ear where Dean stopped because Cas fucking
Sam was at the end of his rope. Both Dean and Cas' phones had been left behind in the motel room, and, when he'd come back with dinner to find the door knocked off its hinges, his brother and the former angel were nowhere to be found. The motel manager had raged at him when he'd found Sam packing up their stuff, threatening to sue for damages before Sam had told him to charge everything to the card on file and left without another word. Kevin had stopped picking up a few hours back and the sun was now beginning to rise and Sam had no information, no leads, and no idea what had happened to Dean and Cas. He was beginning to wonder whether or not he should head back to the bunker when his phone rang from an unknown number.
The thoughts flew out of his head as Dean's tongue entered his mouth and an explosion of pleasurable sensation rushed through Castiel's body, sending blood rushing southwards. Cas let his hand slip down to where Dean's shirt ended, lifting the thin cotton and brushing the hot skin underneath. Perhaps tonight was the night. Perhaps Dean had just been 'taking things slow' as they often said in movies, 'waiting for the right time'. Maybe now was the right time.
And then he was there again, in that house, with a different name and a different life but the same face that haunted Dean’s every waking moment.
Tears began streaming down his face and he wiped them away with a shaking hand. Dean had gone numb, his stomach cold and queasy. He didn't know what to say. There was nothing to say. So instead he reached out a hand and rested it on Cas' shoulder, a comforting weight. Cas's hand came up to rest on top of Dean's, accepting the show of support.
The concierge looked up from his computer and Castiel said in a breathless voice, "Dean Winchester's room please."
"This was much quicker and easier when I had wings." he commented as he stood on the branch and began climbing up the tree, using the flashlight Dean had pulled from the trunk of the Impala to find a suitable branch for their purpose.
Sam hoped this would work. He hoped Dean and Cas could keep this going, that Dean wouldn't sabotage it, unconsciously or not. He knew Dean had many issues to work through and that he would need to talk to Cas about them if they had any hope of lasting.
"You want to sneak onto the Death Star, take out the emperor?" Sam's tone suggested he didn't think that was a terribly well thought out plan to which Dean shrugged.
Dean finished wrapping the wrist in silence, taping off the bandages and gathering the supplies back into the bag before he looked up to find tears trickling silently down Castiel's cheeks.
"No fair, Dean, you got me wasted on rum, which I still can't drink by the way. All Cas had last night was beer and fruity girly drinks."
He didn’t know why he had kept it. It was stupid and sentimental and so not his style but Dean hadn’t had the heart to give it up, as though that would mean he was giving up Cas. He looked down at the bundle of tan fabric. He hadn’t been able to get the bloodstains out no matter how many times he’d washed it but it was a link to the old Cas. The one who had rescued him from hell, had rebelled against heaven for him, had let Dean drag him to a brothel and saved him from Zachariah and always, always,
"Well why not you son of a bitch!" his hands were shaking where they held his brother's lifeless body.
They spent a long time just kissing, hands roaming and feet intertwined, items of clothing coming off slowly as they got in the way. Hands brushed over naked skin, petting and scraping, as their desire grew stronger and more insistent, more impatient. Pretty soon Dean was prepped and Cas was hovering above him, looking down with a mix of lust and adoration in his eyes, while Dean looked back with trust and love in his own.
"I am aware that many humans are…uncomfortable with exploring alternative sexualities. I did not wish to 'frighten you away'." Castiel brought his hands up to cast inverted commas around the last words and Dean smirked at the angel's attempt at nuance. It still needed some work.
"Maybe good things do happen to Winchesters." he murmured to himself as he drained the last of his milk.
"Trust me Dean he does. Look," Sam wheeled around the table and over to Dean, "This isn't about whether or not Cas has feelings for you."
"Dean, that wasn't a 'few too many'. I know how high your tolerance is. That was you drinking like there was no tomorrow."
"As in the Angel of the Lord Castiel? Trench coat wearing, sarcasm impaired, 'I am the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition' Castiel?"
Dean started. That was it? Really? He looked at Cas, who was now nursing a long island iced tea and would probably not make it though another.
Dean closed his eyes at the warmth that enveloped him. With Sam, their hugs tended to be quick, a short squeeze and a manly clap on the back. With Cas, there was always so much more going on, burning and building beneath the surface.
Dean felt hot tears burning, threatening to overflow but he was damned if he was going to cry like a girl. He swallowed and cleared his throat not daring to look at his brother, not daring to let him see this weakness.
“Come on Jimmy.” He said softly, his words barely penetrating the cloud of grief and disbelief that surrounded him.
Dean, Cas and Charlie were in Dean's room rooting around through the paraphernalia he'd managed to accumulate, looking for the key.
Castiel stormed out of the bunker, anger coursing through him, controlling him. He was an angel again. He could feel Theo's stolen grace burning in him, filling him with comfortably familiar power. But it was doing nothing at the moment to quell the rage that fuelled his exit. He strode out onto the street and stopped, staring out at the road that stretched before him.
He started down the road. Despite the fact that he knew every step was one step closer to Dean, he could not help feeling like he was attempting to drain the Pacific Ocean one teaspoon at a time.
Cas insisted on getting the tree himself. He also said he wanted to do it alone but Dean was having none of that; after the long weeks spent apart, there was no way he was letting the angel out of his sight.
The former demon glared at Dean once the hunter had pulled him from the trunk and ripped the duct tape off his mouth, eliciting a yell of pain.
"The demon who tried to kill me with magic?" Jody asked, remembering well the blind date gone very, very wrong.
“Yes, Dean look, I’m sorry, I know it must be difficult to be in a relationship with someone you know so little about and honestly sometimes I want to tell you…everything but I just can’t I-”
Dean swallowed, getting slowly to his feet, his arms snaking around his torso in a protective gesture that was so different from his usual brash bravado. He nodded.
"Okay. Stay on the line. I'm coming to get you." He held the phone to his chest and turned to Sam. "Cas is in town. He got mugged so I'm going to go get him."
He moved back, taking in the sight of Castiel's sleepy eyes blinking open, a silly grin on his face.
"I miss your prayers." he said softly, closing his eyes. "Okay. No one may be listening but…I need help."
The look of utter incomprehension on the face of the man who had once faced down the king of hell and the leader of the archangels, the face of the man who had once been his friend, best friend, finally drove the nail home.
And he did. He could see the evidence of tears on Dean's face and he remembered how he himself had grabbed a hold of Dean when he and Bobby had shown up four months after they'd buried his brother.
"Yeah, well, try telling him that." Dean muttered, shifting and dragging a hand down his tired face. "Anyway, he got really pissed. Started yelling and calling me names. Then he left to go drinking and when he got back…"
"If angels are slaughtering one another I have to do what I can to help, Dean." he said emphatically. "I can't just sit idly by no matter how scared I may be. This is partly my fault and it's a risk I should be willing to take to help my brothers."
"You shut up." Dean ordered curtly, before rounding on the angel in his arms who was fading fast, "And you, don't you dare die on me."
"They were the work of the prophet who came before you." Castiel explained, "He received visions and was compelled to write them down as narratives. They are referred to as the Winchester Gospels."
Dean started. This man was afraid, afraid of the demon, afraid of seeing Dean killing it. But Castiel was an angel, a soldier of God who had seen battle, death, hell he had smote thousands during his stint as God. So why was he now so skittish at the sight of one more dead monster.
Cas leaned his head back against the metal wall he was chained against, tired and pained and fully knowing that reasoning with the psychotic angel was no use.
"Well, I have spoken with him and he has made it clear the he doesn't want to have anything to do with me and I honestly can't fault him for that."
The kiss ended and Charlie stepped back, turning to the rest of her siblings, eyes focused on Michael, "So this is Dorothy." She introduced and proceeded to stare him down.
"Just so you know, I'm not in the habit of bringing drunk strangers into my home it's just… well…I couldn't leave you on the street."
There was another pause and Cas felt righteous indignation rise up. It had been three months and he was only just saying this?
Guilt gnawed at him, the image of a sick and injured Cas alone, thinking Dean hated him, blooming in his mind's eye.
“Oh, okay. Not that you look pregnant.” He floundered, “You look gorgeous. Not that you can’t look gorgeous when you’re pregnant, I hear there’s a glow…”
"Why, Dean?" Cas said, temper on the verge of flaring again. "To prove that you can? To prove yourself to your father?"
But Dean was not here now. Dean did not care. And though he no longer had to sleep, he still saw those faces, flashes of memories that touched on the part of him that was still very much human.
"Don't know. One minute Luci's stabbing me in the chest, next I'm alive and safely stowed away in a far corner of heaven where I had every intention to stay before the eviction notice kicked me in the ass. Good job by the way." he added, sarcasm dripping from his tone.
After Sam left to fetch Charlie, who was luckily still in Topeka, Cas and Dean gathered the masses of bags from their shopping spree and Cas started for the room Dean had designated his the night before.
"Now," Dean said with a deep inhale and a smile that was only partially fake, "how about I go make some more popcorn, hmm?"
"Umm, so, when I was a teenager, my Dad caught me making out with this…guy. And he wasn't too happy about it."
"Well, I mean…all the women you've been with. Was that just…overcompensating or are you actually attracted to women and men?"
“Hate to interrupt your little make out session,” Jo teased, “but dinner’s almost ready so you should probably come inside and
"Anyway," He shrugged, wrapping up whatever story he'd been telling, "it was pretty embarrassing, and now you guys all know that, so...that's great."
Cas shared a look with Dean who stood, brandishing the angel blade and moving to the wall beside the door, gesturing for Cas to open it.
"How could I forget?" Dean commented as he settled his head against Cas' chest, the angel sitting against the headboard. "You barely flinched at the rock salt rounds Bobby and I shot at you. You made the lights go haywire. You were the least human thing I'd ever seen."
Dean stood and began moving towards Metatron but with a casual gesture, Dean was once again flying back into the wall and crashing to the ground, pain blooming. Metatron approached slowly as Dean fought to regain the use of his lungs, gasping helplessly as the the wannabe god knocked the blade out of his hand and kicked him in the face before stomping down hard on his wrist.
Sam moved over to see what Charlie was doing and the two struck up a conversation as Castiel moved over to Dean, sitting down beside him and holding out the food with a proud smile on his face.
He moved to shut the door and Cas turned to look at Dean's lifeless, bloodstained body. This was his fault, his doing. He should not have prayed. He should not have put Dean in danger. Theo moved back into his line of sight, brandishing a drill.
But would he like it? What if he didn't like it? Was it too much? Over the top? It was probably over the top. Or what if Dean bought it and then Cas didn't come for Christmas? What would he do then? He supposed he could always give it to Kevin. But still, was it even worth getting it? Cas probably wasn't even going to come. He'd be too busy or he'd think it was stupid or he'd be offended. And even if he
Castiel looked over at Michael who had still not said anything, pride and love blooming in his chest for the person his daughter was growing into. He squeezed her shoulder, tears pricking at the corner of his eyes, lump growing uncomfortable in his throat. His eldest brother looked from Charlie to Claire to Castiel, his face holding an expression of apology. He said nothing, but nodded his head. The room let out a collective sigh of relief and Charlie turned back to Dorothy.
Cas didn't look entirely convinced so Dean pulled him forward into a hug and began stroking his fingers through the soft down of his wing. Cas buried his face in the crook of Dean's neck, marvelling at the comfort such contact provoked.
Dean looked from the stereo to Cas's tearstained face before deciding that this probably had something to do with the past that Cas had yet to tell him about so he simply leaned back against the bar beside him and listened to the song, finding himself tearing up himself whenever the words
"Can you blame me? This is the guy who's kept Dean monogamous for over a month. Guy's gotta be some kind of angel."
Cas was so socially awkward that it was often difficult to tell when he was doing something because he meant to, and when he hit on something accidentally. Dean figured regardless of how he got there, the result was fucking hot as hell.
"Dean." It was done. Metatron was captured. The angels had been returned to heaven. Dean was meant to be waiting for him. Not dead. Not dead. "Dean."
"Not really, I mean, I remember feeling…at rest, peaceful, like everything had fallen the way it should and I could just…let go of everything. And then I was alive again and I knew I had been dead."
Which lead to this moment of standing frozen in the middle of some random mall in Lebanon, Kansas and realizing he had
"Hello, Sam." Castiel greeted from where he was kneeling between Dean's legs, lips swollen and hair wild.
He raised himself up to glance down at the angel who had an intense look of concentration on his face as he ministered to Dean. Worshiped him, in a way.
Sam was sitting reading in the library when his phone buzzed. He picked it up, frowning at the caller I.D., and answered.
The man moved around the other side of the bar, following the line of high-legged chairs down until he was face to face with Dean.
The warehouse had been a bust. Actually it had been a trap, a series of literary and filmaticly referenced quests culminating in a false heaven that Sam said he would give anything to un-see. Cas had to admit Metatron had gone a little over the top what with balloons and dolphins and cupids, although he couldn't say he didn't appreciate all the pictures of naked Dean strewn about the place. It had been the burnt remains of Josiah slumped in the corner that had really been the icing on the cake, still alive despite the holy fire that had ravished his vessel and grace. He had even refused Castiel's attempt to heal him, saying he didn't want to owe his life to Castiel.
"I want to live." Castiel ground out in between the lances of pain that were shooting outwards from his wrist.
Castiel was sitting on the bed, fidgeting as he waited for Dean. He wasn't sure what was going on and, though he trusted the other hunter implicitly, he was still wary.
He tugged Dean free of the constricting undergarment and licked a line from the base to the tip, swirling his tongue like he had been taught to do by the internet before taking Dean whole, bearing down and surrounding him with warmth.
"I use t' be able t' feel it. Th' earth m've, orb'ting th' sun. Now I can' feel it anymore. Can' feel 'lot 'f thingssss." His head fell forward onto Dean's shoulder as Dean worked his shoes off. "Can' see 'lot 'f things either."
Sam sat panting, trying to get his bearings. He looked around until he locked eyes with his brother.
"About your grace. About the fact that you're losing it. About the fact that Metatron implied it was going to kill you when it was gone."
But he was not an angel and John Winchester was long dead. All he could do now was offer what little comfort he could give to the weeping man in his arms. So he wrapped his arms tighter around Dean, pulling the both of them down so they lay on the cheap motel bed sheets. Dean moved in closer, seeking comfort and protection and Castiel looked down at him.
"Dean, we need a strong branch of Oak to defeat the Roman Goddess who is capturing and burying people alive."
"Wait, hold up. Are you two…" she trailed off, punctuating the unspoken words with a suggestive eyebrow raise.
"Good." He said jovially, producing a lollipop of all things from his inside pocket and divested it of its clear plastic wrapper before popping it into his mouth and turning to exit the roadhouse.
"Dean, wake up, it's all right." he said softly as he reached out his hand to rest on Dean's shoulder.
"What are you doing?" Castiel questioned as he moved, fearing for the intensity he heard in Gadreel's voice.
"Yeah." Jody agreed, "It was a little strange. I can't imagine what it's been like to live with the guy." Dean shrugged. "But in a way, it was nice."
Silence fell as the two men stood panting from their screaming match, Castiel's anger dying as horror took over at Dean's words.
"Wow." She breathed, "And here I was still trying to get used to the fact that you're not a secretary."
"I walked out of that courtroom and I couldn't go back. I couldn't be Jimmy Novak anymore. I couldn't be Claire's father or Amelia's widower. I couldn't face the looks, the pity and the sympathy that I got everywhere I went. So I got on a bus and I just…left. I wasn't going anywhere, I was just leaving. And I drifted, aimless and hopeless. And then, when I'd nearly run out of money, I walked into the closest bar I could find with no plans apart from forgetting and maybe, if I was very lucky, I might not have to wake up and go through it all again."
"He was right. This says there is no counter spell. It also suggests that my Grace is likely gone for good."
"I am fine." he said in a soft tone that he knew would make the stubborn hunter calm down and listen. Sure enough, Dean closed his mouth and looked at Cas. "Thank you for your concern, but I am fine. I do not need, nor do I wish, to eat."
Dean smiled and took it. It was small and light. It sparked a memory but before he could figure out what it reminded him of, he had already opened it. A leather cord curled in large loops around a heavy gold object. With reverence, Dean grasped the cord and held it up until the pendant hung, swinging and glinting in the dim light of the bunker. He looked away from the amulet he had last seen sitting at the bottom of a trashcan four years ago and over at his brother who was looking back in trepidation.
Cas stared out at the road that lay before him. The road that held so much promise and potential but which had ended up leading him to nothing but loneliness and defeat as he continued warring against his brothers and sisters in a fight that he felt obligated to participate in, but which was slowly tearing him apart on the inside.
"Then what happened?" Castiel asked, fully engrossed in the story and enjoying the way Dean's eyes lit up when he spoke about his brother.
"I've already lived and died Castiel and I didn't do a terribly good job as a human the first time around. How can I expect to do a better job this time? Especially with so much to make up for."
Cas paused and then turned, moving back, his face set in a mask of barely controlled rage. He stalked forward, grabbed Dean by the scruff of his neck, and pushed him back into a column, using his renewed strength to pin him there as he crowded in and spoke in a dangerously calm voice
He slung the guy's arm around his shoulder and hoisted him off the barstool, grabbing him around the torso as he failed to find footing.
While Cas was gone, Dean started to help Sam tidy up the mounds of books that littered the table, having sent Kevin and his mom off to get some sleep. He was in the middle of setting books back on the shelves when Castiel's panicked shout sounded through the Bunker.
He'd brought a guy who had passed out drunk in his bar back to his apartment and given him his spare bed. Dean had friends he wouldn't do that much for and yet here he was staring down at the snoring stranger with the too-blue eyes and dark messy hair and the unexpectedly gruff voice that was probably a result of the whiskey he'd been throwing back all night.
"I got something I need to tell you, Cas. I should have told you this sooner, but…It's not easy for me to talk about. I…" He cut himself off. He knew he was rambling, and Cas was looking utterly confused from his position on the bed.
A collective gasp sounded from the group of women and whispers broke out. Dean could feel his hands shake and his face heat from the confession. He glanced out of the corner of his eyes and saw Sam staring at him in open astonishment and, looking to his other side, Cas with concern colouring his features.
"Hey Dean?" Sam asked, turning around. Dean stopped and looked at him. "Why didn't you just tell me you went to a boy's home?"
When he had finished interviewing the moody teenaged girl, he looked around for Cas who was nowhere in sight. When he found him hunched over the Impala, Dean's stomach lurched and he rushed over, excusing himself hastily to the sheriff.
"They were so confused. Scared. Lost. And there was nothing I could do. I helped bring it about and yet I was powerless to fix it." He closed his eyes again in shame. "I tuned it out because I couldn't listen to their cries anymore."
"Come on Dean." He pleaded, his puppy dog eyes coming out the way they always did when he sensed he was close to winning Dean over. "We haven't celebrated it since before either of us went to Hell. Don't you think that it's about time?"
The words echoed in his mind, drowning out the last of the visions of hell and his father. He couldn't even remember who he was really. Only that he was Dean Winchester and he was loved.
"Anyway, after he graduated high school, Sam wanted to go to college. He's a smart kid, got into Stanford on a full scholarship but dad said that family comes first and he had a duty to 'the family business' and that if he left he should stay gone. So Sam left and dad started to go off hunting on his own and I suddenly found myself alone for the first time in my entire life. At first it nice you know? Freedom and all that? But after a while…" Dean trailed off, shaking his head as if trying to sake away the painful memories, "Anyway, about four years after Sam left, dad disappeared and Sammy and I went on the road to try and find him. Eventually we caught up with him and turns out he'd found the SOB who'd killed our mom. Dad finally took him down. Unfortunately, dad went down with him."
