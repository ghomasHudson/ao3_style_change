He jumped off the sink and pulled Benny into a stall. He buttoned his shirt and zipped his pants before opening the door to Crowley, the former captain of the football team, a senior.
“I don’ think so.” Dean sounded like a little kid even to himself, like he was thinking about everything that he could have done wrong. Aside from getting a hard-on for his teacher in the middle of class and fantasizing about his teacher in inappropriate ways, he was pretty sure he was in the clear. Unless Cas could read minds.
“I’m s-sorry what was the question?” Dean was thankful that there was a desk covering his lower half because he could have been in big trouble with the whole class looking at him again
"Oh, damn.” Sam said, stripping his sweatshirt for her. She happily accepted and put the hood to the right side.
“Maybe we could hang out sometime? Grab a coffee?” Dean asked, moving over towards the cupboard full of mugs.
“Uhh, well a few tables just came in, I’ve been working the bar, Ash and Jo are on the floor. Why don’t you grab section one the new tables sat over there.”
In the car Dean pulled out his phone to call Sam. He did not pick up at first, but after the third try he finally answered. “Hey!” Sam answered cheerfully. “What’s up?” Dean could hear him chewing on something, probably a pancake, those were his little brother’s favorites.
“Thank you very much, I really need a coffee to survive the rest of this day.” Dean said gratefully pulling a chair up to the desk.
“It’s times like these I wish I was straight” She moped, coming around the large wooden table to hug her best friend. He laughed and grabbed his phone to order.
“Oh, well, uh, Gabe, I grew up in bars, and not in a good way, so I picked things up and I’ve been here for years.”
She leaned forward again kissing him lightly. “Friends then?” She asked sadly, knowing he was not going to budge on this issue.
This one is pretty good. It does have a SEXY scene so beware if you don't want that. Dean goes to work and get's a surprise visitor and then he goes to a party and has more fun than expected.
Just like that they were gone. Dean settled in for the night. He grabbed a bunch of napkins and silverware. He sent Ash on his way home for the night. Jo was manning the bar with a few people around at tables and bar stools. Dean was handling all the side work. He filled everything in the fridge and took out the trash before returning to the bar to roll silverware for tomorrow. The clock read 1 before he knew it, closing time.
Dean’s day was going fine and his shift was almost over. He had to get to the roadhouse by 8 to cover part of Jo’s shift. He kept checking the clock, because he forgot his watch back at the house. No way was he going back there with Sam and his GIRLFRIEND.
"Hey at least I don't have any secret tattoos" Dean referenced what he saw earlier after a minute, he mostly wanted to get a rise out of the older man, he was also curious.
“Hey guys, sorry I’m late, I was trying to get the heat turned down in my room. I guess it does not vary by room.” The teacher frowned, walking around to lean on his desk. “I know it’s hot, but let’s try to focus. I’ll open these windows to circulate the air in here. It’s only fifty degrees, it's NOT cold!” He forgot he was speaking to a class and lost his temper. “Sorry about that.”
It didn't matter anymore, what had happened. We wouldn’t have to deal with her again anyways, or at least that’s what we thought.
“Okay, are we going to be in the room during? That’s going to be awkward,” Sam noted, eyeballing Gabe like a kid looks at a piece of candy.
“Hey,” I spoke up catching her attention, “can I head over to the restroom or am I strictly stuck on this bed?”
"Don't even ask how he managed that. I think he added some honey or something because it was sticky as hell," Balthy interjected.
“Cas!?” Dean exclaimed, running over and picking me up. He looked into my eyes and I felt guilty for all the concern and worry that clouded his gaze.
I laid back on my bed as my head filled with so many questions and so little answers. So, now this boy can’t be mine?
“Hey, I’m in the hospital. It’s a long story. You should come over. I’ll text you my location,” I said.
The phone let out a loud ring and the receptionist at the table answered it. She looked around with sympathetic looks flooding her face. She kept letting out mhmm and grunts. Once the call ended, she turned to some of the staff and spoke with them urgently. One of them stood up and began to speak.
"Get some underwear on first! We have a lady in this home!" Dean squealed as I ran out of his room chasing Gabe. I stopped in my tracks as I looked right up at Lisa's amused face. I turned around and caught the underwear Sam threw at me. I ran after Gabe, throwing them on in the process. I tackled him and grabbed the perfume out of his hands as I sprayed it viscously on him. I ran back into Dean's room and threw on my clothes.
I ran down the green field squealing when I saw Gabe get closer. I almost got to the finish line when I saw him trip and fall. He looked like he was going to cry and I ran over. I bent down to make sure he was okay but the second my knees hit the floor he jumped up and placed his lips on mine. He then laughed and ran to the finish line.
“Yes?” He looked at Sammy and me as if he were looking for support but then sighed and looked Meg in the eyes.
I walked into my room and gasped as I looked into the mirror. I saw all the bruises and cuts that I have accumulated and realized that Dean might've seen. Yesterday, I had been wearing makeup just in case. Once I took the shower it must've all washed off. I groaned hoping that he was too caught up in his fit of laughter to realize.
I wheezed under the sudden pressure and impact. I could feel the soft yet cold carpet as it brushed against my face. I closed my eyes and imagined that it was Dean's skin brushing up against me. I smiled and wondered if that was how Lisa felt when Dean was lovey-dovey towards her. Suddenly, I realized that although I was alone in my thoughts, Dean and Lisa were still there and soon it didn't feel like the carpet was brushing up against me anymore. The time that had slowed suddenly began to speed up and I felt myself being dragged on the carpet. The bristles scraping up against my face. I wondered what I had done wrong now and before I could remember that I wasn't at school and that it most likely wasn't Crowley and his gang, I was being thrown at a wall. I caught my balance just in time to see Dean push Naomi away. I could hear her yelling insults and words that I had moved away just for the sole purpose of never hearing again.
“Look, I’m sorry, I know its not preferable but I didn’t want to go all the way home and deal with John before coming here. I’m exhausted, please cut me some slack Sammy.” Dean sighed looking defeated.
“At least he doesn’t smoke in the house anymore” Bobby repeated bitterly. Dean couldn’t tell if he was mad at him or his father… or both. Either way he didn’t want Bobby mad.
After unbuttoning his shirt the drunk boy kissed down Deans freckled chest to his hardening member. Dean bit back a moan and there was a deafening knock on the door interrupting their moment.
“Yeah, I just have to check in with Sam first.” He hitched his breath as though he had revealed something that he didn’t want to. As quickly as he inhaled he exhaled his breath, he had nothing to hide from Lisa.
They carried on their conversation for a little while in-between taking care of customers. Dean found out that he actually kind of liked this Dorothy girl. He was excited to tell someone about her, a new friend that no one else knew! He asked her questions, found out that her father was a writer and her mother absolutely loved the story of “The Wizard of Oz” hence her name. They also discussed LARPing because Dean would never admit that he loved it when Charlie dragged him along, that would be the end of his popularity. Casual conversation that made the time pass.
Page one and two flew by for Dean, but there was an open ended question that took him a few minutes to get past. The final quadratic equations were easy enough to do with the calculator. The test was very similar to the study guide and he had been over most of the materials last year in Algebra 2.
“Yeah, yeah I know the drill Dee, I’ll be in touch.” Sam said before he abruptly ended the phone call, without saying goodbye. Dean texted him anyway.
“Uh, Art I think, it’s an easy stress reliever, then probably History.” Dean answered smoothly. “What’s your least favorite?” He countered.
Two people landed on the ground but Dean did not see who it was until he blinked open his eyes. When he opened his eyes the sight he drank in was all too familiar. The student reached his hand out instinctively to check if the other man was all right. Dean’s hand cupped his stubbled cheek and ran a thumb over his porcelain cheekbones. It was merely seconds until blue eyes sprang open. Suddenly Dean was yanking away his hand — that was now on fire — and scurrying to get back up and away.
“I’m not lying.” He said calmly. Before he had time to process John took a swing at him. The fist hit Dean right in the jaw, John had a right hook that hurt like a bitch.
“Destiel and Sabriel,” Charlie whispered, acting as if those words were the most important words in history.
"Wanna come join me?" Dean smiled up eagerly at me and I couldn't help the words that came out of my mouth.
Anyone who knew told me I was helpless, I was so lost in the fact that I loved him that in the beginning I didn’t realize just how much I was hurting myself. Each and every time I would see him with someone else hurt me a billion times over. It felt like a thousand tiny knives were stabbing into my heart, needles twisting and turning in my body, my stomach ached, my head hurt, and I simply didn’t know what to do. The love of my life was suddenly gone with other girls. I don’t know if I should feel happy about this or sad about this. I mean, Dean was happy after all but whenever I see myself in the future I see myself with no one other than the one and only, Dean.
"Hey ! Look Who's talking Mister Leather-Jacket-and-1967-Chevy-Impala. You have no room to judge.” Castiel huffed back.
One more left turn when he was there, he slowed down to really take in the moment. He felt free. A smile spread across his face in the cold night air. He checked his watch for the third time that night and he pulled out back to park with the rest of his co-workers. I hope Ash is on tonight, Dean thought to himself. He took a deep breath before hopping off his bike, thanking whatever God there was that the Impala wasn’t there, but there was a funny looking pimpmobile in the parking lot out front.
“We got this in the bag.” Charlie smiled leading Dean into the class with their laced hands. They put their bags down and pulled out their huge calculators that cost way too much money — god they were nerds.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, but to their surprise they just fell asleep. Dean was so tired, and apparently Benny was too.
Science wasn’t so bad that day, but he dreaded the end of class because that meant only 45 more minutes until he had to confront Mr. Novak again. Thank whatever holy thing there was above that he had art with Charlie last period every day. The last ten minutes of Ms. MacLeod’s class were spent flirting with Benny and getting payback from the beginning of class, once Benny let out a slight moan Dean shot up and walked to the door and the bell rang. He bolted down the stairs before they got too crowded and made the way to Ms. Master’s art classroom.
The pleasant feeling of a wet surrounding, tightening around his hard member was amazing. “C-Benny F-faster please! I-I want you t-to go fahh-!" Dean was unable to finish his sentence as Benny pulled Dean up on top of him. Gravity did its job and pushed the tight asshole against around this big cock. Benny let out a blissful laugh and paused as he bottomed out.
Dean reached into the backseat and pulled out the pizza he brought for Sam, who happily took it. Dean laughed as Sam shoved his face with pizza. His brother looked at him and asked “What?” with a mouthful of cheese pizza. This only made Dean laugh harder.
I shoved the credit card into the sloth of the machine and pressed the number nine. It asked me questions like what type of gas I wanted and how many gallons and all that crap. I just clicked the buttons and it printed out a receipt. I tried pulling the card out but no matter how hard I tried the damn thing wouldn’t budge. I went to Baby and popped the trunk open allowing myself to have a perfect view of her storage unit. I grabbed the key and shoved it in the slot so I could grab a knife. As paranoid as I am, I kept looking over at the machine to make sure no one was nearby to steal my - not so-  hard earned credit card.
As I began to look around at my surroundings I realized that I was at home. Not home home with Cas. I was home, with dad, with memories, and at the moment, nothing but the floor to keep me company. I looked at the counter remembering the time with Hester.
“Alright, what’s the project for? Some history thing. Said he wanted us to work together. I was wondering if I could drop by your house, work on it with you. If that’s alright with you, your highness.” Castiel bowed, his hair flopping down like a mop before he raised his head to look Dean in the eyes, a mischievous look in his eyes. Dean found himself admiring the ocean blue eyes, waves of lighter blue crashing in, rays of light making the hues of blue gleam. Castiel cleared his throat, snapping Dean out of his trance. Dean reminded himself not to get close to the competition, much less his enemy.
“Can you believe that Castiel Novak sits next to me during class now? First people ruin cars, then pizza, and now this! What’s next, are we going to elect an orange as president?! Or are we going to go from buying phones to hoarding toilet paper? Are murderous bees going to come into my home and threaten my very existence?! Are humans going to fucking form a mob and break into a goverment facility? Lord, Charlie, tell me what’s next!” Dean cried out, waving the comb at Charlie.
“Alright, what i’m getting from this is that she’s kind of mean but crappy to you boys,” Meg pointed at Cas and Sam, “that right?”
I heard the door squeak open and turned to find a nurse walk in. Her focus was centered on a paper attached to a clipboard, she viciously clicked her pen as she read through it all. Her gaze slowly drifted up and to me, her mouth dropped open for just a moment before collecting herself. She seemed shocked and surprised to find that I had awoken. Soon, I saw that look wiped right off her face. She ushered Dean out with his stuff and whispered something in his ear that made him stop in his tracks. His eyes quickly darted my direction before he was pushed out the door. I didn't notice it at first, but now that Dean was gone I could hear it loud and clear, the monitor line was shaky and it sounded awfully close to going flat.
I woke up to the wonderful smell of freshly baked pancakes. I wandered into the kitchen after my shower while I clumsily threw my clothes on. I sat down at the table admiring Dean from afar. Once he turned around my eyes flickered to the pan in his hand. I laughed as I thought about Gabe.
“Drop me off here,” Sam said once they approached the entrance. Dean began to slow the car in order  to allow Sam out. Sam bent down to grab his bag and Dean hit the breaks, Sam shooting forward. Sam huffed, having fallen for the daily prank again. Sam put his lunch into an empty pocket in his backpack. He zipped up his bag and grabbed onto the strap at the top.
I was shocked to see that although I did look decent, I looked slightly pale and ill. I brushed off the thought and blamed it on the light that Dean had apparently replaced earlier that day. Halfway through getting dressed, I heard a loud thud and rushed out of the restroom. Instead of finding a burglar or a fallen table, I found Lisa pushed up against a wall with Dean brushing against her. His lips neared her and they fell into a lust-filled makeout session. I shuddered and ran back into the bathroom. I closed my eyes wanting that image to get out of my head as I quickly threw the rest of my clothes on. Once I had, I rushed out of the bathroom door and made a beeline straight towards the door. I could hear Dean yelling for me but before I could make my way out of the door, I felt something slam into me.
“Of course I do, my love,” I smiled up at him and fought through the pain as I got up and walked over to his bed. Once I got to him, I brushed the loose strands of hair back and kissed him. It was warm, passionate, soft, and filled with love. I dreamt of this and it was everything and more. I pulled away to look at him and his beautiful rosy cheeks.
"GET YOUR SUGAR LOVING ASS BACK OVER HERE!" Luc's yells woke everyone up and before I knew it, I was being chased down the stairs.
Suddenly, Dean was far more interested in the lesson being taught today. Sam would never stop teasing him if he knew, but Dean loved learning, he relished it.
I sat down on the couch and a sudden realization hit me. We are paying for rent at some not so crummy - but still - apartment when we could be at my dad’s. I almost forgot that place still existed.
“Guys don’t just ‘get cozy’ it’s gross and wrong. It doesn’t matter if they are friends or not,” Lisa said.
“You’re adorable. Would it kill you to watch a movie? Read a book?” Meg sighed. I could hear her clank tiny bottles together, most likely like the fluids on my tray. An audible pop was heard and then a groan. I could hear her undo something, sounded an awful lot like bandages and tape but I kept my mouth shut and listened. I wonder if Meg and the man are together, perhaps married? No, there wasn’t a ring. Maybe they’re just a couple. Suddenly, I got very uncomfortable, wondering if I was interrupting something.
I looked down at the food next to my bed and tried reaching for it, in the process, my grip on the bed slipped and went tumbling off my bed. I groaned as my body hit the floor and I bit my lip harder than I ever thought I could trying to hold back a scream. I could feel the sticky liquid ooze into my mouth and the sound of someone swinging open the curtains.
My voice trailed off and I sat in my thoughts. This was all my fault. Why did my heart deserve to go on and my eyes deserve to see but he wasn't able to. How come I was allowed to continue on with my life but he wasn't. Maybe, I'm the reason he can't come back. Maybe, I'm keeping him from waking up. Maybe, he's scared to wake up. Because. Of. Me.
The bathroom has smooth white walls and a soft blue materialed floor. It seemed to have padding to it but also had a grip so you wouldn’t slip, like shower mats. It hadn’t been until now that I realized I was barefoot. There were three toilets: a low toilet, a changing toilet, and a high toilet. Now, I’ll tell you why I called it a changing toilet. The toilet was short but seemed to be adjustable in height.
The next day went by slowly, Charlie was constantly reminding him to remember his date after today and Castiel continued to be a pain in Dean’s everloving ass. Dean watched the time tick away, it went by slower and slower every time. Charlie’s day seemed to go by quickly, apparently if this date ended well and the girl’s friend spoke nicely of Dean, Charlie would get the date. Charlie had mentioned something about it being a way to judge morals and what kind of person she was. Dean didn’t care much, Charlie seemed to be going through a hell of a lot of work to try and get this girl but what could he do?
“Yep, I think someone tackled me. Anyways, Cas don’t forget to call Chuck. He was worried about you and wanted to talk. Anyways, I’m going to head out! Bye,” Gadreel finished and hung up before anyone could reply.
I sat down in the waiting room, I knew the nurse would come out any minute but it was all taking so long. After I was pushed out of the room, all my mind could do was think of the worst outcomes. What if he doesn't get better? I never got a chance to make him mine. I never got a chance to tell him how much I truly cared. I always just pushed him away and refused to believe for a second that he could ever love me. Face it, no one could ever love me, I'm a good for nothing boy toy. I just wanted Cas to be happy and find someone he could truly love. Hell, maybe he would make a family and finish college or whatever. I just wanted the best for him and now it might just be the worst. Sam and Gabe came over and as much as I wanted them to be okay, I don't know how to help them. I wanted to help, I truly did but now... I'm not even sure how they can be okay if I'm not okay... Whenever I look at myself in the mirror, I don't like what I see anymore... I- I'm a monster. I'm crashing down and I don't know what to do. I think I'm losing my mind and I don't know how to pull myself back up. My mind is racing but my body is slowing. My will to go on is decreasing every second I spend waiting. I know it hasn't been long but I will wait my whole life for him.
“We just moved in from our old home, it wasn’t like we weren’t in the area, we just never really hung out. It’s sad to think our parents got along before we did,” I sigh.
The woman was very polite. I looked her up and down. She had dark brown hair and beautiful eyes. It felt blissful while I was near her and like everything was going to be okay. I smiled up at her and kindly accepted. I don’t know if it’s because Cas being gone broke me or what happened. Next thing I know, we are outside and walking to the car. Everything seemed so calm and still.
I quickly used the restroom and realized that the toilets had two options. One of the options being that you could pick up a remote (that seemed to have a wrapping around it that got disposed of and replaced after each use by the nurses) and a push of a button would help clean you instead of using toilet paper. There were many different buttons and options and things I would most likely never understand. From what I could tell in the remote, it used water instead of toilet paper. No thank you. Not trying that today.
“Yea. I never knew what it meant, no kid my age would,” I took in a deep breath and let it out with a chuckle, “I didn’t know what death meant. I knew mom was gone, I knew she wasn;t going to be back, and I knew it would be a long time before I’d see her again. Heck, I was pretty much alone. Sam was nothing but a baby, not even grown enough to be called a child yet. Dad changed after that, he snapped. I knew he loved mom and I knew he missed her but no matter how much I told myself it wasn’t my fault, I felt like it was. I couldn’t get into that room fast enough, I couldn’t hear it when the man came in, I couldn’t- I… I just couldn’t. I wanted Dad to be better, I used to beg him. That was when it seemed like he cared, one day he just changed. It’s all my fault, at least I think it is. People said I was delusional but I could’ve sworn that when I went into that room, I saw my mom float up. She flew up to that ceiling like she was trying to get to the stars. That’s how I think of it, mom was so pure and so bright. I swear the heavens wanted her so bad, they tried to take her up. I’d rather not think of it like I do in my nightmares. I always dream that a demon did it, locking her in place, burning out the bright light of her beautiful soul with the fires of hell. If mom was in hell… I would want a one-way ticket there when it's my time. The thought of her soul getting lost and trapped here, doomed to walk this earth as nothing but a ghost pains me more. Her soul wandering this earth, watching just how much I continue to mess up, how I continue to let her down. I wish I could live up to her. I wish I could’ve gotten to know her better. I remember her, she was a gorgeous person, kind, bright, peppy, vivid, everything good you could imagine and then some. I remember how she used to sing this one hymn to me, especially when I needed assurance. I remember the melody, the hymn, the lyrics, all of it like a drunk remembers the taste of beer. Do you think mom liked beer, Cas?”
“A movie no, but a book with the proper spells could theoretically kill me,” the man joked. His voice sounded all too familiar but I’m too out of it to try and figure out why.
I used the other senses in me to see what I could make out of this room. I heard an unsteady heart monitor to the left of myself that was accompanied with a raspy and uneven breath. To the right I heard a decently steady heart monitor, the person seemed to be sound asleep. From the sound of it, they were pretty banged up and in pain.
I pulled out my phone and turned it on, allowing it to blow up with all the missed calls and texts from Lisa and school friends. I opened up Lisa’s contact and dialed her number. While it rang, I looked through the texts she had sent me.
Charlie looked at me with bug eyes. “Dean hit you on the head with a rock and ran over his brother!? John beat Dean again? Dean broke up with Lisa? You were with Meg?” Charlie asked, enraged with some of the questions and merely surprised with others.
I hopped up on the counter and tried to dive off as an escape but she was swift as a cheetah and was on top of me before I could say Castiel. She grinded her body up against mine and after a while she forgot to keep her grip on me. I took that moment to push her off and send her out the door. I threw her over my shoulder and grabbed her purse making sure to scan her for any keys before leaving her outside. I locked the door and fell to the ground crying.
"Wow. That bad." Dean sighed and I could almost hear the disappointment in his voice. I looked back up at him, ashamed of myself for letting my feelings get in the way of our friendship.
“You’re right, sorry,” Dean apologized though he clearly didn’t mean it, only wanting to see Sam happy.
Once school ended, I dropped off Sam and Gabe at their house. They whispered silently in the back and the only words I could make out was Cas and bad. It worried me that maybe they knew something I didn't but I brushed it off and went on with my day. I drove by Lisa's place right after and picked her up so I could take her over to my place.
“Also, don’t forget that blind date you’re going on tomorrow, you wouldn’t want to forget that. We get off at twelve thirty tomorrow, don’t forget that because the second you get out of class you need to make a run to your home, into the closet--which I’m sure you’ve made yourself very familiar with--and pick out a decent outfit. You need to look nice, remember your manners, offer to pay before being asked to pay!” Charlie looked at Dean with a look that let him know she had much more to say, he didn’t bother questioning her though.
“Alright,” Dean said, his phone buzzed and he paused to fish his phone out of his pocket. It was a message from Charlie letting him know that she wasn’t going to be going with them. “Charlie isn’t coming and Sam can find his way back.”
So, here I am with the two people I love most, Sam, and Cas. I know other people will judge. I’m not saying that I expect it to be all fun and games. I’m not expecting it to be sunshine and rainbows. I know there’s going to be ups and downs. I know there’s going to be good times and bad times. I know there’s gonna be all this hard effort and hard work. I know there’s gonna be crying and scratching and running and crying. I want all of that and more with him now, I want to work it out with him. I want to be able to spend the good times and the bad times with him. Trust me, there will be a lot of good times.
“Cool it, Clarence. I already knew,” Meg said casually,  “I was hoping to talk to Dean about it privately but as you can see that blew up in my face.”
I looked at Sam and raised my eyebrow, wondering if I was doing the right thing in inviting her over. I opened up the texts once more and type in my location along with the room number. I looked at Sam and I looked at Cas, we all had the same looks on our faces. We were ready for this day and have been ready for quite the while. Now, all that was left, was doing the action.
“You do?” Cas gasped and dropped the blanket. He looked at me like I was the most extraordinary thing in the entire world. His hand brushed through his soft and messy dark hair.
When I got home, I found Dean and Lisa sitting close together on the couch. I took off my trench coat and hung it. I walked to my room and gave them their privacy. I dropped my keys into my bed and opened up my books to study.
Once we stopped in front of school, we ran out of the car and to class. The day went by like any other and I had plenty of kids screaming at me. Their bright blue, green, pink, red, and yellow faces were making it impossible for me to take them seriously. Some kids got stuck to their chairs and others found fake cockroaches in their bags. The day was wonderful and I laughed more and more while people fell into my traps. Luc and Balthy teased me for bringing 8 bars of chocolate and other candy but I didn't care much because they had no idea what they're missing out on.
"Hey," I placed my finger under his chin and used it to make him look at me, "you don't ever have to be sorry with me. I love you no matter what. Don't you ever go saying sorry to me."
“Or… you could head to the principal's office and ask him for her parent's number because you have a project together that needs working on but you haven’t had the chance to get contact information from her. Then, you can just call her parents and ask them for her number because you really need to talk to her about something school related, I’m sure you could make something up.”
I could hear some leaves rustling but I brushed it off and assumed that it was just the animals running through the trees. I sat down on the blanket by the side of the water. I burst out crying wondering why I was such a disappointment that I couldn't even keep my best friend from successfully finishing myself off. I was about to pick up a PB&J sandwich when I heard a voice.
“Dean!” Charlie squealed, skipping towards Dean. She pulled Dean into a tight hug, squeezing Dean, before letting him go. She looked him up and down and frowned, adjusting the samulet around Dean’s neck before flattening out his flannel. She chuckled at Dean’s messy hair, mumbling something about how he looked like he had sex hair. She pulled out her phone and shoved it in Dean’s face, her red hair bouncing with her every word. Dean smiled at the way her green eyes glimmered in the light as she talked to Dean like he was the older brother she never had. He smiled at her fandom shirt underneath the flannel she wore, she had picked up a fashion sense or two from the Winchester brothers.
He awoke to a loud thump on his table, his head shooting up as he grabbed the nearest person by the collar and pinned them down on his table. He awoke from his daze and looked around at his surroundings, realizing that he had Castiel pinned down to the table and his books on the desk next to him. Castiel tried getting out of Dean’s grip but ultimately failed considering he couldn’t exactly figure out what position he was in. Dean let go of Novak and sneered at him, upset that he was disturbed from his beauty sleep, heaven knows he wanted it. Castiel hit Dean across the back of the head and sat down on the chair belonging to the desk next to Dean, organizing his books and pulling out his notebook. Dean decided to follow suit and do the same, grabbing his books, notebook, pencils, pens, highlighters, and eraser. He wondered what Castiel Novak was doing sitting next to him but decided not to question it knowing that the boy was filled with mystery.
“What?” Lisa looked at us with a disgusted face, “I guess, good for you. I’ve got to go, have a nice life.”
I looked at him confused and astonished. Just Lisa? I thought Lisa mattered to him more than I do. I wondered if maybe, just maybe, there was a possibility Dean did have feelings for me. My thoughts rushed back to when he was younger and how he thought- or so he claims- that he was bi. Maybe he truly is but the sad truth is consuming him and terrifying him because of his father. I looked back up at him and at this moment, that's when I knew, I loved Dean Winchester. There was no doubt about it, most people in the books fall in love right away but this... no this wasn't right away, this took time. We started as friends and the feelings and longings soon evolved to more. I just wonder if Dean feels the same, if he has that same longing, that same attraction, that pull that I have. Dean walked over to his spot on the chair and pulled out a box from underneath. Inside I could smell the gracious smell of food. He opened it up to reveal a delicious steak. I knew I wanted to eat it and I knew how much it would hurt but right now I just wanted to sit down and eat with Dean dammit! I just want to know he cares, just a little bit...
That left all three of us sitting in our thoughts as we planned the perfect break up of Dean and Lisa.
I looked at Cas and I could tell he seemed just as confused and tired as I did. We both looked at Sam as he happily talked to the rest of the family. I loved seeing Sam happy and now life couldn’t get any better. I have everyone I need and everyone I love right with me. It wasn’t long until Sam hung up and turned to talk to us.
“Can you believe it? The hottest girl sits next to me. I should ask her what her name is. Ugh. Stupid Mr. Fitz, I was about to go up to her and give her my number or whatever and then he pulls me off to the side to lecture me about some stupid class assignment. I’m pretty sure he should’ve figured it out by now that I’m hacking into the system and changing my grades. Anyways, I think I’m just going to have to check the system for her parent’s information and then I can trace it back to their IP and then once I have that I can go ahead and find out where she lives. Once I have found out where she’s located I’m sure I can make up some lame excuse,” Charlie huffed, giving Dean the usual annoyed look she had when the teacher interfered with her love life or just life in general.
I could tell Gabe was scanning Cas to make sure he was okay. My eyes followed him and trailed slightly down to his arm. I noticed that although his sleeve was rugged down, there was still a flap that had opened up a tad to reveal what was under. Gabe and I looked at each other wide-eyed once we realized Cas was at it again.
“Hey, bitches!” Charlie said as she bounded through the doors. She stopped in her tracks once she saw the sight of Dean and I along with Sam and Gabe. Meg and her exchanged looks, Charlie’s face softening for a split second before turning her attention back to us.
When it was time to wash my hands, I almost settled on going for the hand sanitizer that was on both doors- one on the left and one on the right. The doors automatically sensed when there was motion inside and locked as well as the lights turning on up until the door opened and closed again and they didn’t sense motion, then they would turn off. As long as the door didn’t open again from when I walked inside and the motion was sensed inside at the beginning for at least 15 seconds, the door would stay locked and the lights would stay on. In case anyone did not trust this, there were light switches and a button to lock the door. The door has a little square on the side of it that would allow the door to open with motion if it sensed enough. For example, if you waved your hand in front of it for 5 seconds, it would open up automatically. There was also a button next to it that you could press for it to open automatically as well. If you didn’t like any of these options, you could just open and close the door with the handles.
“Oh nice, that's what I do for Sammy. The only reason I know about cars is because it was the one thing all three of us could agree on when Sam got old enough.” Dean responded honestly. “Anyway, I would set up an appointment with Bobby inside for sometime this week. If you are dead set on me working on your car I'll be here Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday from after practice until close, at nine. It should take an hour or two to replace the unit. It'll be about $500, is that okay with you?” Dean thought over any other information that he could have missed, but could not find any. He headed back inside to set an appointment for his teacher’s muffler.
At around 6 in the morning the early birds started rolling in. They had a special from 6-8: four pancakes with three strips of bacon, two scrambled eggs, and one piece of toast with any drink, all for the low price of $12.
At home Dean was thinking about the whole night. Castiel understood what it was like to be Sam of all people which he never thought anyone would come close to. This made Dean’s heart beat a little bit faster when he thought about his teacher.
“Are you okay?” The voice was very concerned and Dean could not wait for there to be a person attached to it.
Alrighty Cas let’s take a look at your muffler." Dean said before crouching down at the back of the car. "This thing is rusted from the inside out. The rain this summer probably didn't help." The younger boy gave his judgement of the car. "You don't know much about cars then?"
“Well, like I said I was cooking pancakes and bacon for dinner the other night and some grease splashed on me out of the pan” Dean responded, sounding more confident than earlier, giving more detail to his lie.
Dean liked cooking classes because it meant that he got to learn new recipes to test out on Sammy. Because they made stir fry last class, today they would be making something sweet to balance it out. By the end of class Dean was still thinking about the number in his phone, but now he had warm cookies in his hands.
His loud moans and pants blended in with the music pounding just down stairs. He knew exactly where Dean enjoyed being touched and how to give him a bigger wave of pleasure. “M-mm! Y-you can fuck me now!” Dean’s face was completely red. His eyes were half-lidded with drool coming out if his strawberry lips.
“I’m sorry Cas, I mean, Mr. Novak, I have to go. Charlie and I are studying for a test we have next week. I’ll see you next Friday?” Dean was whirring around the room toward the door with his backpack over his shoulder in a flash. He said a final goodbye and left. Castiel barely had time to react to the situation before Dean was gone, he mumbled a ‘bye’ to the closed door of his classroom and went back to whatever he was doing before Dean walked in. He did have to admit, he liked the sound of Meg’s nickname hanging off Dean’s lips, even if it was just a slip up.
The line backer’s member was teasingly pushed against the clenching hole until he rammed himself in without any warning. Dean screamed for anyone listening close enough to hear that he was being fucked dry by his teammate. "I love the way your body reacts to my dick. When you arch your back and call out my name, I love it." Benny huffed and moaned as he repeatedly slammed himself over and over again into this juicy ass.
“Ugh! Fine, well you wanna watch a movie? I think there's something on," Sam replied, moving on from the embarrassment
Sam was waiting for him at home. Dean saw a strange car out front with a man sitting in it. He knocked on the window to ask who he was. The man rolled down the window cautiously.
to us.” Sam said through laughs, in an attempt to calm down. Dean mulled over the words for a few seconds before bursting out into laughter himself.
“Ah, and what are we not jealous of over there miss Bradbury?” He questioned, eyeing Dean as she nervously looked around the room.
Dean set his alarm for the morning to get up and run before he turned over and went to sleep, exhausted from the day.
Dean shuddered with the sudden feeling of hot breath in his ear and buried his face in Benny’s chest. The larger blonde boy smiled and carried Dean bridal style to the large bed. Dean lay there on his back as Benny took in every inch of him. He immediately pinned his hands above his head and started to attack the vulnerable boy with kisses and hickies. Dean’s face was flushed and bit his lip, only to have muffled moans to escape. Benny smirked and traced his hands over the well-built body and hovered over a particular tent.
Starting with a slow pace was something Dean always liked to do to tease himself, he knew what he liked. The slick, lubed fingers were brushing his hole, before sliding two in with a small hum of pleasure. Dean fell back into his fantasy, but when he closed his eyes it was no longer Benny bending him over. He found himself imagining his teacher bending him over his desk. Although Dean was surprised, he ran with it —
"Are you hard, baby?” He teasingly tapped the tip and watched as the pre-cum left a stain on the boxer-briefs. Dean’s breath hitched and he thrusted his hips upwards for more contact. Benny snickered at his partner’s attempts to gain any kind of friction.
He doodled on the pages for about 10 minutes until an acceptable amount of kids had passed their tests in. He got up behind this kid named Karen Giles and followed her paper into the basket.
“This is so embarrassing” he hissed under his breath. Luckily his voice was drowned out by the engine revving. They took off down the road and back towards their house.
“All right, lemme grab a jacket real quick.” He said walking towards the coat closet. Where are we going anyway?”
“Well, we were very intoxicated, and you are my student, and you have my phone number now which is highly inappropriate. I would like to apologize for being belligerent and anything my brother or I might have said to you that was disturbing or vulgar.” The older man responded quickly.
He ate the brownies greedily and the entire time I couldn't stop slipping in glances of him. I missed him and all the time we spent together but I have a girlfriend and I'm most definitely not headed down that path, at least not today.
Once school ended, I waited for Cas and Gabe out of the school doors. Gabe was first out and we had to wait a bit for Cas to show up. Once Cas got out, I could see the look in his eyes that told me he wasn't okay. Although Cas might not be my brother- yet- I still think of him as one. He's always been there for me and I've always been there for him. That's how it's always been.
As soon as he got home, Charlie sent him the details of the date and let him know where to go. He was looking for a well-dressed man, he would be presenting in a black suit, a blue tie, and he had black hair. Charlie told Dean that they would be meeting at a steakhouse and that the man he would be meeting would have a bee plushie on the table. Dean was satisfied with hearing that, he liked steak and where there was steak there were burgers. Dean thought the bee plushie was rather peculiar but Charlie let him know that her friend let her know it was his favorite being.
I went over to the pan with eggs and made sure to check up on them. I turned around to find Cas standing in the kitchen.
“Yes, it is,” Sam stated blankly before continuing for Cas, “Lisa is pretty. Although she's not looking for something permanent, she’s all right in school. She has many friends and is the typical popular girl. She can be nice to those who are of some use to her but you know the gist of it.”
"What's that!" I asked through sneezes. "It's giving me a headache!!! Why does it smell like artificial strawberries?"
There was a small trash can with two sides to it, one said recycling and had a list of what you could throw in and another had the same except with the garbage. Above the trash can, there was a medium sized box with a lid to it labeled Hazardous along with a list of things that you had to put in there instead of the trash can. The trash can seemed to be motion activated although it did have little pedals to push on so you could open it up. The hazardous box, however, did not have a motion activated sensor. Instead, you had to do it manually, pulling down a lever on its side.
Dean lost his patience and picked up Castiel, grabbing his bag and sending him out the door, dropping him on the porch. He stormed inside and began to do his homework, rushing to get it all done before it was too late. He was just about done when he heard Sam sneaking in. Dean grinned to himself, rushing to get the rest done before rushing out to see him.
"Let's go!" I said as I ran back out, throwing a pancake into my mouth in the process. We all ran to the impala and jumped in as we raced to school. We got there just a few minutes before the bell rang, barely getting into our classes.
“Well, you are most definitely worth it. You’re worth so much more than I could ever provide. You are worth more than I could share with you and all that I could offer. You’re worth more than I can provide and hell, even if I can’t give you all that you deserve, I’ll definitely try to make up for everything I can’t provide,” I blew him a kiss and stared at him, admiring all his perfectly perfect imperfections.
My head whipped around to try and see who was calling out, scared that it was Crowley. I relaxed once I realized it was Dean, until I realized he could see my crying and all my bruises and cuts and everything in between. I  quickly whipped my tears and hid my face.
“ well, I don’t know about that…” Cas looked at me with a look that said ‘you’re not going to do that’.
Once it was over, I ran to a bridge near the edge of town. I went to a nearby store and bought some stuff to have a picnic. I sat down at the edge and thought about my life and what it's really worth. I picked myself off the ground and lunged off the edge. I could feel the impact against my body and I knew that I had broken a few ribs but it didn't do anything so I picked myself up and walked back to the dry shore. I grabbed the blanket frustrated and began to tie it on the tree so that I could be done with life once and for all. I got up and hung myself but the knot undid itself and I just landed hard on the floor. I screamed frustrated about how much of a failure I am, I couldn't even finish the job correctly. I laid down the blanket and placed everything back on it. I angrily thudded my fists against the ground and could feel the sharp pain from the beating, the lunge, and the failed hanging. It all felt so horrible. I was horrible.
"What?!" I hit him with a pillow wondering what had him so amused. "Don't we have school to get ready for? Are we late? Oh, please don't let me be late."
The rest of the day went by smoothly, there wasn’t much to complain about, it was an easy day. I walked towards the steps of the school and plopped down, waiting for Charlie and Sam. They always liked to take their precious time. I pulled out my phone and began looking at football scores. Football always seemed to interest Dean, regardless of how fit he was. Once he got a quick glance at how it was all going, he sighed and put his phone away. He wondered what was taking Sam so long, Charlie he understood. Dean whipped around and noticed Sam running off with a dark haired girl that he recognized. Allen? Salieen? Saileen? Alieen? Eileen! Dean lowered his gaze to Sam’s hand and noticed his fingers were intertwined with hers. They seemed to be happy, laughing in the background.
"She's great. She's pretty and kind and caring. She has a wonderful personality and seems to really love you." I blurted out. I didn't mean most of what I had said but I said it anyway. I wanted to make Dean happy even if that meant putting myself down.
Before he could answer, I looked over to Crowley signing threats at him and that answered my question. I threw a fist at Crowley and gave Cas a little kiss and my headphones with classic rock playing before I threw another fist at Crowley. I grabbed the lamp and went to throw it at his face and that's when I woke up.
Sam is very smart, he studies a lot, plays video games when he has the time, has plenty of A's, and I'm positive he's going to get a scholarship. He has some great friends and he's thinking about joining the football team. When he first started off at school, a kid - sort of heavy but not much taller - bullied Sammy, but once Sammy put him in his place no one has messed with him since.
"I love you and you know that. You have been an amazing friend to me and I care about you deeply. You are an amazing and outgoing person and I am so lucky to have you in my life," I took a deep breath before continuing, "but I do need some time for myself and I know you could probably use some time alone too. At least some time away from me anyways. You could have this place to yourself and I know Lisa has been coming over a lot. You could probably give her my room is y'all aren't ready and/or devoted to sleeping in the bed every single night. You could probably give the room to Sammy and Adam as an alternative. I know you love your brothers and probably want to spend time with them. You could get them a bunk bed or just steal one from my house-"
When Dean got home he was more worried about Lisa than anything else. He left her with the bill and no explanation . The sound of his fathers voice shook him on the phone, he came home so quickly he thought he was going to get pulled over. The front door slammed open and Dean looked up from his thoughts to an angry looking John. Yet he still could not figure out why his father was calling him at nearly seven in the morning.
It was a blessing to have John gone for a week or two. They did not have to work to avoid him. Sam and Dean got into a routine when John took these trips — though he had not been on one in a while. School to practice, to home, to work. Sam’s school got out at 2:30 as opposed to Dean’s 2:00; however this worked out for the practice-slash-pick-up situation. Since today was Monday both of the boys had practice after school.
“Not as long as I’m alive.” He held out his hand to help her out of the car, keeping the joke going a little longer. She stepped out of the car and linked her arm through his elbow and smiled at him.
When Cas opened his eyes Dean did not take his hand away. Cas leaned forward to kiss him and Dean loved the feel of their lips moving in tandem. The older man reached out to touch Dean’s neck and it made him smile into the intimate moment.
“Everything I put you through?” Dean smiled sadly at her. Their break up had been rough on the both of them especially because neither of them had really wanted it. He regretted cheating every single day, but he couldn’t take it back. Dean could picture everything that happened that night and all the weeks that followed. He never wanted to lie to her so he didn’t. She said they could make it work but he wanted to find himself first, as cliche as it was. He ended up finding Benny in all of the chaos. Although his southern boy-toy was nice, he wasn’t Lisa.
On Saturday the brothers received a phone call from John saying that he would not be home until the end of the month and that they better keep the house in shape. This also meant that they would be home alone for Thanksgiving, he would have to ask Charlie or Ellen if they could handle two more bodies for dinner.
“Yes, I know that, I’m sorry, I was just tired and I didn’t want to think, I didn’t drink the rest of the day though, I’m so sorry Mr. Novak.” Dean’s voice was shaking and he spoke so quickly it was nearly inaudible.
“Oh well, I, uh, kinda have a thing with one of them and he came onto me in the bathroom, but I pushed him off because he smelled like…” Dean looked around and lowered his voice “alcohol. Anyway he ended up yuking it out in one of the stalls, but this guy that used to be captain has beef with me because I ’stole his position’ or something, anyway he was annoyed that the door was locked.” Dean found himself being completely honest with her.
Charlie shivered out from under his arm at the mention of two men — Benny nonetheless— having intercourse.
The process was slow, but worth it, Benny really tore into him last night and he did not want a repeat of that. He let out a deep breath, being as quiet as possible when he bottomed out. The button for it to turn on was on the bottom, the setting was a low vibrating so it sent waves of pleasure through him without even moving. He had to stop himself from letting out a moan loud enough to Sam up, what came out was a muffled moan and his hips jerked up into his hand.
“Maybe I’ll go try it sometime, a drive to the city doesn’t sound too bad.” Dean said with a light laugh and smiled naturally.
Next they went bowling. After Dean lost the first round, which he insisted was a fluke — even though he was definitely giving it his all — they played a second game. Sam would deny purposely losing the second round until his grave. The look on Dean’s face when he won was more than enough reason to make Sam throw every game. As much as Dean thought he loved Sam more, the feeling was mutual.
He knocked on the door to his history classroom and walked in. He scratched the back of his neck as he awkwardly stood in front of his teacher as he was grading papers. Mr. Novak coughed to clear his throat and took off his glasses to look up at Dean’s green eyes.
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice rang in his head, but what started out as a moan in his fantasy became real. Charlie nudged him, hard.
“No it is not the power trip. I love history and I want to share it with as many people as possible, I figured that teaching was the best way to do that.”
Also a little bit of sexie times so beware of that. I'm bad at summaries, but this day is finally over
“Dean, this is my brother Gabriel.” Castiel said rolling his eyes. He wondered why the teacher was doing this.
“Sammy, don’t you worry about me, It’s the weekend, I’ll go out and be normal tomorrow night, I have off.” He rolled his eyes at his overprotective younger brother.
Charlie’s heart broke for him, “Dean, it’s okay I’m here with you always, you’ll make it one more year, I’ll even pretend to be your girlfriend” she placed her hand on his forearm and stopped him from shaking.
“Doesn’t seem like it,” Dean said as Benny started to vomit into the toilet. He laughed and then got back to work.
On the way to Cooking class Dean was staring at a number on his phone screen. His history teacher's number to be specific. Ghosting his finger over the number debating between texting him or not. Charlie noticed this conflict within him, but did not say anything outright about it. She did not recognize the name or the number he was so worried over.
I threw off my shoes and plopped into bed. It was warm today so I pulled off my clothes and stayed in my boxers. I sighed relieved to be out of my clothes and getting some breeze. I closed my eyes ready for another day in hell.
I woke up early the next morning and did the usual, I walked into the bathroom, turned on the water, grabbed a towel and some clothes, and hopped in. I sighed once I felt the ice-cold water hit my bare back, the feeling although stung a bit, felt good. I grabbed the shampoo and worked it into my hair, letting it foam up before I rinsed it off and began to work my way through my hair with the conditioner. I almost considered skipping the body wash, but once I got a whiff of my underarms, I decided against that idea. I slathered it on my body and rinsed it off, allowing the conditioner some time to do its job. Once I finished, I brushed my hands through my hair a few times before deciding to rinse off. I hopped out of the shower and momentarily forgot where I had placed my towel. My body trembled vigorously thanks to the freezing cold air conditioning that was now, for some reason, on. Once I found my towel behind the small and empty trash can in the restroom, I wrapped myself in it, thankful for the warmth it provided. I started getting dressed and looked at myself in the mirror as I did so.
“OMG! Mine too!! He’s a freak and I think I’ve seen him look at my ass, which is weird for how strict he is.” She laughed cringing.
“I don’t know, I am usually ahead on work, he kind of knows the home situation…” Dean said in a hushed voice as they moved to their designated stovetop. “So he has been giving me more work to finish so I have less work to worry about next week, kind of. I dunno if that makes sense, but I just keep daydreaming about the same history class.”
“Okay, well Friday after you left Gilda came over to watch a movie and talk about D n’ D. Then, as she was leaving we TOTALLY kissed on the front porch.” Charlie said excitedly. “All day Saturday I had to work at the Video Store, someone called out sick so I had to double. Uh, then obvi I had D n’ D at night. It was super duper fun and I got to see Gilda again. Except she was a fairy and I was a warrior, but we ended up working together. Sunday a nurse came for a check-up with my mom. I made breakfast in bed for the two of us. Nothing really special happened after that, I worked at The Store again and went home.” Charlie finished her recap out of breath from talking so quickly.
