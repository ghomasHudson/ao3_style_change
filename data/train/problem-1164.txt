"And the last victim," he continued as though nothing had just happened, "has a daughter training to be an intern with the palace gardener."
Sherlock had to physically stop himself from rising and darting down the shaft to find this monster and kill him right then. But that wouldn’t do either of them any good. He had no choice. He just had to play the game. Get through it. Get John help.
of Dr. Azarian, who had prevented him from being barred from the hospital entirely after he had found the nurse who had grabbed John's arm and berated her so thoroughly that she was in hysterical tears in the middle of the hallway. But after fifteen minutes of brisk pacing and "fresh air," he was no less angry than he had been.
Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath as John simply stared, eyes wide and mouth slightly ajar.
The thing, instead, was quite solid and just slightly taller than John. It's skin looked decayed and diseased, with a greenish tint and several areas that looked eaten away. It's teeth were jagged and sharp, like broken glass, and it's eyes were entirely black. But the most striking thing about he creature to John was its stench. In the war, John had encountered his share of death and he knew the smell well. This thing, however, smelled more pungent than John anything he had ever encountered.
Slowly, John pushed himself off the floor and limped to the new door. When he reached it, he put his right hand on the door, hesitated a moment, and then pushed. Sherlock couldn’t see what John could see, but whatever it was had clearly startled him.
Sherlock stared at the man in front of him in utter disbelief. He was still staring down at John's chart as though reading a script. After a pregnant pause, he looked up to find Sherlock glaring angrily at him. He raised a lazy eyebrow.
John squinted at the stranger, who was now glancing around them furtively, as though trying to read his secrets on his person.
As they crossed the street, a careless driver screeched to a stop inches from hitting Sherlock. John, used to Sherlock’s near misses by now, continued running while Sherlock cursed at the driver and followed, now meters behind.
"Yes," he said, his voice sounding strained to his own ears, "but you've come to the same conclusion I have, haven't you?"
"Mr. Holmes," Dr. Azarian stood and walked around the table toward the door, "I have been a doctor for many years. In those years I have seen thousands of patients whose illnesses and recoveries have followed exactly as the textbooks describe. And then there have been those who should have died, but didn't. And those who shouldn't have, but did."
The carriage moved along for quite some time, during which John gradually became accustomed to the strange machine and relaxed enough to look outside the window.
Sherlock thanked an entity he didn’t even believe in and let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
"Alright," Sherlock said, turning toward John, "we are looking for anybody who could have framed Amelia. Somebody who could have found her after hundreds of years in hiding."
"He does this when he's upset," Mrs. Hudson replied, flickering back as the slime made its way into the fireplace.
Sherlock was shaking now. He was overwhelmed by anger and worry. Things were already bad for John and were clearly only going to get worse. And this game was clearly targeting John again.
The reaction was immediate. John let out a scream, though he seemed to cut if off through sheer force of will. Sherlock cursed the dull knife as he was forced to apply more pressure and then, unimaginably, start sawing at the flesh. Sherlock could feel John’s body tense up beneath him as he made the incision through the wound. Blood pooled around his hands as he worked, staining them so red that (irrationally) he was afraid the color would never wash off.
His progress had been quite slow, punctuated by the need to rest several times before he had even reached the moors just outside of the village. He cursed himself for selling his last cane and not restocking, but he was too far from the village to go back and get a new one now.
"Sherlock, please," Lestrade looked rather desperate. "The king won't get off my back. We've hit nothing but dead ends and there is a war looming on the horizon if we don't figure this out soon. You're the only one left after Suliman died."
"I..." John faltered as he again heard his voice and realized that the unfamiliar sound would probably now be permanent. He cleared his throat, though he knew it would do no good. "I'll need to see an someone."
“Good job it’s not your choice then,” John said firmly. “I’m a grown adult, Sherlock, not a child in need of coddling and protection.”
The sight, though he had been expecting exactly what he saw, shocked him. He stopped short in the doorway, his heart thudding painfully.
He was right, of course. But Sherlock felt his blood boil. If it were the last thing he did, he would make this man pay for what he’d done to John.
John and Sherlock both tensed, looking around the room, but not seeing anything. Before they could say another word though, both felt a small stab in their necks. Sherlock raised a hand to find a small dart protruding from his neck.
What he saw was not the letter his sister left for him. Instead, it was what John now recognized as a curse.
"Dust," Sherlock replied, whipping at a patch of dust on a nearby stack of folders for emphasis. "Dust is elegant. Can't be replaced. There were tracks in the dust, almost lost due to the king's incompetent investigators, but enough was left to show the marks of a body being dragged."
He had never seen Sherlock look particularly guilty, though he had frequently had opportunities in which he should have done. In that moment, however, Sherlock looked wretched.
“John,” Sherlock says slowly, “I let Sebastian shoot you. He could have killed you right there. I only made that decision because of my own weakness. I couldn’t… I couldn’t watch…”
But it is immediately clear Sherlock has chosen the correct syringes. John’s breathing, which had become laboured, evens out, he stops twitching, and his face looks less green and pale.
"How do you like your room, love?" Mrs. Hudson was cheerily blazing in her fireplace, smiling at him as he came down the stairs.
“I don’t know how that’s going to happen,” John rasped. “There’s no way I can move. But you can. Get out of here. Get help. I’ll be fine.”
John is silent again for a long moment. Sherlock begins to worry John has lost consciousness, but then he stirs again.
John cleared his throat, looking at the ground, his cheeks flushed just enough to return some of the color he had lost. He closed his eyes, clearly in more psychological pain than he had been in physical pain this whole night.
“Welcome to room number two,” Moriarty said into the microphone. “You did a very good job in the first room John. I’m actually a little impressed. And as a reward, I want to give you something to help care for all those unfortunate wounds you’ve received.”
Sherlock was opening his mouth to respond when the door to the waiting room opened and Dr. Azarian entered. Sherlock was on his feet before Molly had time to register that someone had entered the room.
Without another word, Moriarty leaves the room and Sherlock is alone, staring at the screen in front of him. At the same time, Sebastian leaves John’s room, smiling at the camera the entire time he walked out. In the next moment, two burly men enter the room and quickly untie Sherlock, pointing a gun at his head to discourage any unwise movement. They leave just as quickly as they appeared.
“Was Sherlock also injured in your recent…adventure?” Colonel Hayter asked, concerned. “He seems to be behaving quite oddly.”
For reasons beyond Sherlock’s understanding, the theatre was crowded. Why would so many people want to endure… watch this?
“Then I suppose this would interest you,” Colonel Hayter said. “Quite an odd case, actually. Or cases. Nobody’s at all certain they are connected. But we have so little crime here, it just seems outrageous that two such crimes would be committed so close to one another in both space and time.
"We would just like to examine the body," John said, trying to diffuse the situation. "What can it hurt to have another set of eyes on the case."
“Then how do you propose you get up them?” Sherlock asked. “Because your current method will not work.”
He took a deep breath, closing his eyes and allowing his senses to reset. When he opened them again, he could see more clearly. They had been walking for just over two hours and still had at least an hour to go before they reached their destination.
And then there was the nagging uneasy feeling of regret and guilt that he couldn't seem to shake. A feeling to which he was quite unused.
John tried to move his head again. He clearly wanted to say something, but there was no way with the respirator.
"No," Sherlock answered the question he knew Dr. Azarian was asking. "I had to move his leg. If it were nerve damage in only one area, he still would have reacted to the entire leg moving. He didn't react. Not at all."
Sherlock felt his heart beating faster, his breathing becoming more irregular, and his mind becoming clouded.
“Something about land,” Hayter explained. “The Cunningham’s are convinced that part of the Acton estate actually belongs to them. I don’t know much about it, but they’ve been at each other’s throats for years.”
“Don’t worry John,” Sherlock lifted his other hand to John’s cheek. “Neither of us will ever be alone again. I promise.”
"Yes," Sherlock said, glancing at him. "Somebody gave her legs. I'm guessing in exchange for blood. If you drink the blood of a human every seventy two hours, you can remain human, correct?"
"Yes," Amelia looked up at him, her eyes bright. "This is my home. It's where we lived together. I could never leave that."
He felt John’s tongue slide across his open lips and shuddered involuntarily. Then John’s tongue was in his mouth, gently moving along Sherlock’s own tongue. The feeling was… it was amazing. Sherlock had never… His whole body was reacting.
"This is for trying to take what is mine," she whispered before leaning forward and placing kiss on his forehead.
A young man had come to the door and was standing, waiting politely for Dimmock's attention. John tilted his head at him.
As soon as Sebastian was visible to him, John visibly stiffened and took a sharp intake of breath. Sherlock realized John had not seen the man since what happened in the military. Sherlock nearly growled. He wanted so badly to kill this man.
After a long moment, during which John began nodding off, he felt Sherlock's hand on his shoulder. He looked up and saw Sherlock staring at Mrs. Hudson, mumbling something. He thought he felt a cold tingle run through his arm, but he was asleep before he could be certain.
“I need information,” Sherlock said by way of greeting. “Everything you can get on Sebastian Moran. He served with John in Afghanistan.”
“Fine,” the doctor said. “I’ll start working on your discharge orders now. But Dr. Watson, you will need to be vigilant. You are by no means out of the woods with that leg and shoulder. Should anything change, come back immediately.”
Once he had regained some control, he glanced out of the window of his small room, trying to control his breathing as flashes of the nightmare played in his head. It was still dark outside, but he knew he would never get back to sleep. Sighing, he pushed himself up and moved to his small desk, where his notes on healing remedies were spread across the small surface. Sitting down at the small space, he resigned himself to the tedium of working on the remedies until his father's clinic opened.
They sat that way for a long while, in a silence far more comfortable than the silence that had been festering between them for so much of the recent past. Then, finally, Sherlock pushed himself up off the bed...
"I thought I told you to get some air," Dr. Azarian began rubbing his temples the moment he saw Sherlock, who was waiting for him outside John's door.
"That's not his name," Sherlock looked more annoyed than John had ever seen him, "and he isn't dead. He doesn't have the decency to die."
John paused, lowering his eyes, before taking a beath and raising them again to meet Sherlock’s gaze.
John moved to the side as Sherlock grunted and pushed himself up. The man corrected himself almost instantly and moved toward them. John rolled to the side as the syringe came down toward them and Sherlock kicked out, landing a hit just on the man's chest.
"Oh," Harry looked delighted. "Small world, isn't it? Irene, dear, I'm so happy you could come by today. This is my brother!"
He was astounded to see that the star had a face. In fact, it looked vaguely like a very small person made of fire. He reached out to catch it, but it swerved to the side.
Sherlock seemed to relax a bit, apparently convinced that he wasn't about to induce another panic attack. He moved to the side of the bed and turned so that John could more clearly see his mouth.
At her mention of John's name, Sherlock's focus finally centered squarely on Molly, who looked startled at the force of his gaze.
He had found that, since the explosion, he became agitated and anxious anytime John was out of his sight for more than a few minutes together, even for doctor exams or scans. It was
And between John and this door was a maze of barbed wire filling the entire room. Sherlock could feel bile rising up in his throat.
“Oh,” he said, turning back to John and Sherlock, “keep a bit of an ear out tonight. We’ve unfortunately had a string of rather odd crimes in the area lately. Just be mindful.”
"Well, it isn't about him anyway," Lestrade said impatiently. "I've got a case for you and its urgent."
By the time Sherlock returned, he had managed the task and was blinking up at the industrially bare wall of a hospital room.
Sherlock’s chest felt tight. Didn’t John realize that he was Sherlock’s constant too? That without him, he had no idea where he would be. Nowhere good.
John felt a hand clasp his and, once again, tingles run down his back. He tried not to flinch. Sherlock pulled at their clasped hands and John moved forward.
John nodded and turned the nob to blue, stepping out to find himself surrounded by the smell of sea and salt in the air. He glanced around and found a well maintained, but modest port town, with a dock just visible in the distance. Seagulls circled above in the sky and the sound of ships’ horns filled the air. He stood for a moment, simply taking in the sight, before pulling the trash outside and depositing it in the appropriate place.
“You can sign yourself out AMA,” the doctor said, “but it would be better for you to just stay a few more days and…”
Instead of summoning anonymous men to the room to cart Sherlock off, however, Moriarty simply steps to the laptop and presses a button. The camera adjusts to show the entire room John has found himself in now. John is lying near the back door. Again, there is another door on the other side of the room. This time, however, the room is not filled with anything seemingly dangerous. Rather, it is filled with an odd assortment of items placed on various tables around the walls. Sherlock sees everything from small, wooden boxes, to nesting dolls, to metal boxes, to coffee tumblers. The room is also, strangely, decorated, with various paintings adorning each of the walls.
He knew he would just be in the way. John had been uncomfortable with the entire process and Sherlock knew he would rather be alone for this. Particularly when Sherlock couldn't seem to stop himself from making snide remarks that angered the audiologist and her assistant. She annoyed him. Particularly when she refused to listen to John and insisted on treating him as though he were some petulant child.
“Family of John Watson?” the man who entered the room was holding a chart, which he was looking down at. He looked weary and his shoulders sloped as though he had been working hard for several hours nonstop.
"Do you remember where you are?" Sherlock asked, and this time John heard the words that accompanied the movement of Sherlock's mouth, though he spoke very softly.
Sherlock stared at the screen, refusing to look away. He owed John that, as much as the scene before him made him sick. He knew he would see this scene in his dreams for years to come. He felt like he was betraying John’s trust and faith in him with his decision. When it came down to it, however, Sherlock made the only decision he could bear to make. The only one he could stand. In the end, he wasn’t protecting John—he was protecting himself.
What were those paintings doing on the walls? There was no reason for them to be there. No reason for Moriarty to decorate his torture chamber with random artwork. They had to mean something. He looked at each one carefully.
“Oh?” Sherlock was almost 2/3 the way down the ladder now. “And how do you expect to get back to London to do that?”
"Wait, how did you know about Zanzib?" he asked, pushing himself off the wall to face the strange man.
The inside of the building was as nondescript as the outside. To John, it looked like nothing more than an almost empty room, with nothing more than a few scraps of carpet and some boxes. Sherlock, however, appeared to see something different.
John frowned. How could he have done? He had only just realized and Sherlock hadn't moved since, so when had he told the doctor?
“Sherlock,” John said, his voice tight, “you don’t have much of a choice. It’ll have to come out anyway. I can help you.”
Sherlock, of course, had ignored this, though he had given John more space, hovering on the periphery until his nerves became too frayed.
John stared at him. He wasn't making any sense. Why would he want to be here. John didn't want to be here. Nobody wanted to be stuck in a hospital with a someone who couldn't even get out of bed and, now, would never be able to walk again.
John tried simply saying the spell aloud. Nothing happened, except that Mrs. Hudson told him it was lovely and asked him where he had gotten it.
Did that mean…? Had John actually enjoyed that kiss? Had he wanted it? And was that why John didn’t seem to actually care about any of his girlfriends? Was that why he stuck around, even when Sherlock would have driven anyone else away? Even when he was a total ass? Was that why John always came back?
They had moved into a large area filled with tall trees now and John was having trouble seeing in the relative dark under the thick canopy. Sherlock, on the other hand, seemed to have no trouble discerning his way. He moved confidently through the trees as John stumbled after him, trying not to get his cane caught on any roots or branches.
It was dark by the time they reached the flat and John was bone tired. He no longer needed Sherlock’s help getting up the stairs (thank god), but tonight he was actually afraid he might collapse halfway up. When they reached the halfway point, however, it was Sherlock who stopped short.
Sherlock looked at Moriarty in confusion. Was he really going to give John a first aid kit? Was it really going to be that simple?
John looked beside the door to find a small wheel with four colors on it and an arrow pointing at the green side.
John rolled his eyes, but Sherlock missed it, still tending to Mrs. Hudson. John returned to studying the spell, deciding to ignore Sherlock.
"No, Sherlock," Molly's voice was quiet and she placed a hand on his knee as she interrupted him. "I mean, did you tell him
"There are several components to a powerful magical spell," Sherlock began, falling into a didactic mode that made John grin. "Simpler spells are simply a combination of everyday ingredients in the right order and proportion, much like your healing remedies."
"So, let me get this straight," Sherlock began. "You saw a scarecrow and got so scared that you made my fire demon move the castle so far she almost went out?"
Sherlock felt himself pale as the blood rushed from his head. He stared down at John’s leg—a mangled mass of tissue and bone. If he stood on that, it would cause John agony. It would further damage the leg, which was already damaged enough to cause permanent complications. He couldn’t.
"I mean," she said, pity now entirely evident in her expression, "why it matters that the risks outweigh the benefits. Why you care so much whether or not he goes through with the surgery. Why you've been at his side since he got hurt.
Sherlock wanted to stop him. He didn’t want to hear this. He was certain of it. He didn’t want John to have to tell him whatever secret he had managed to keep for so many years. He would much rather have taken the shot. But John was never going to allow that to happen.
"We lived together," Amelia smiled at her lap. "We spent our time building this place, so that we could have access to the city when we needed it. And then, eventually, she died. Humans do that.
It was the last round. All John had to do was answer a question and they were free. And after that last question, what could John possibly say that would hurt either of them.
It seemed to take an eternity for him to reach the third level. At the top of the landing, several doors stood in a semi circle, only one of which was open. Inside, Sherlock was crouched over the figure of a woman leaning against the far wall.
Sherlock was staring intently at the ground around the hedge where the intruder had fled. John could not see what he was apparently seeing, but he didn’t say a word, so John left it alone.
John’s lips weren’t soft but weren’t rough either. His breath was warm against Sherlock’s own lips. There was tension in them, but they seemed to relax just a bit when Sherlock’s lips finally met his. Alarmingly, John’s lips were cool to the touch—not a good sign. But then John parted his lips and Sherlock forgot all about that.
The ordeal of removing John from the rubble, placing him on a stretcher, and pulling him to the surface had taken an excruciatingly long time. Sherlock had watched from the edge of the hole as the rescue workers painstakingly removed heavy beams from John's body, careful not to dislodge debris or move his body and cause more damage.
“I can’t predict exactly,” the doctor looked steadily at Sherlock, “but I suspect the leg will not function fully. And it will likely be painful for the rest of his life.”
"But, then how am I supposed to break it?" John was getting annoyed. Would anything in his life be simple again?
John looked wretched. Sherlock wanted to tell him to stop, but he knew that wouldn’t help. He wanted to find this monster and tear out his vocal cords. But that wasn’t going to happen. So he was going to do all that he could do. Bear witness.
As expected, John had been in a bad state when he had arrived. Sherlock had been given little information, but what he had gotten was not promising. He was taken into surgery as soon he was stabilized and Sherlock waited.
But, though John reaction certainly worried him, it was not what was distressing him most--causing him to replay the incident over and over in his mind.
"I don't murder anybody," Amelia said crossly. "I feed on animals and blood from clinics -- never people."
But he was having trouble feeling too upset at the moment. John hadn’t told him off or told him to leave. John had smiled. He had laughed. Maybe they could make it out of this. Maybe things would be okay. Would go back to normal after all.
Even though his pain, John could feel Sherlock’s fit, though thin form against his own torso. The sun hadn’t come up yet and it was freezing, but Sherlock’s bare chest was warm. He could feel his heart beating, steady and strong. It was comforting. It was nice. It was… intimate.
Sherlock was completely absorbed in his work. Every now and again he would ask for an evidence bag, container, or tool of some sort, but otherwise he remained completely silent. Lestrade followed behind him, careful not to get in his way, helping however he could.
"Colleague?" Sally asked, looking incredulous. "How does the freak get a colleague. Did he follow you home?" She directed the last question at John, who raised an eyebrow at her.
"John has suffered a crush injury to his right leg resulting in widespread damage to the extremity," Dr. Azarian turned in his chair and clicked a small remote to display a digital x-ray of John's leg.
In amongst the monitors and equipment were a couple of cards, a fluffy teddy bear, and a few flowers. He smiled.
As illogical as it was, he felt as though telling Dr. Azarian were just as bad as signing the consent to amputate John's leg.
"I don't know, mate," Lestrade glanced over at the kitchen, from which soft bangs were now emanating. "I've got a feeling he might just listen to you."
Sherlock was staring at John. He had his eyes closed and his head leaned back against the wall, but he appeared to be conscious. He was surprised. He had been sure that standing on that leg would make anybody pass out. But apparently not John Watson.
“Yes,” the voice laughed. “That’s exactly what I wanted to hear. And how does that make you feel John?”
The battery of tests he had been forced to undergo had not improved his mood. After each John grew more impatient and more distant. It hadn't taken long for him to insist that Sherlock leave.
Then the lock clicked and the door to the safe opened, revealing a key sitting inside. Sherlock let out his breath.
Sherlock nodded. He knew this. But he was certain the voice would want details and he had been avoiding those for some time now. He certainly did not want to hear than from John’s mouth.
He pushed himself to his feet and began pacing the small, nondescript room, hoping the frantic movement would ease his frantic thoughts. As he walked, he focused on breathing steadily and
“10, 9, 8,” the voice was filled with glee. Sherlock kept his eyes trained on John, going through the plan in his head again and again.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock looked startled as well, having backed a few stepped from the bed and raised his hands.
"It is wonderful, Mrs. Hudson," he said, making his way to his chair and setting his cane against the fireplace.
"No," Sherlock turned to leave again. "Come back when you have an actual case. I don't work for the king."
“No,” Dr. Khatri said. “I’m not taking it out with you in here. You’ll be in the way. Plus, it’s protocol. If you won’t leave, I’ll have you removed.”
When John rose to consciousness again, the first thing he noticed was that whatever pain medication his doctors had given him, they had given him significantly less of it.
"What good does it do?" he shot at Sherlock, "Just sitting there in that chair doing nothing? What use is it? Just go!"
“As for walking,” the doctor continued, “it is difficult to tell this early on how the nerves will heal and how the bone will heal, but yes, he should be able to walk. He may have some pain though.”
Then he glanced over at John and saw his crutch leaning against the chair. He couldn’t ask John to run around the village for a case. It would be painful and difficult and…
He let his head fall back against his pillow and his eyes fall close. He tried to breathe deeply, which hurt enough to distract him from his anger and anxiety.
“Slowly,” he screamed at Sebastian through the laptop. “I’m going to kill you slowly. You’ll beg me for death. I’ll make you suffer ten times as much as you’ve made John suffer.”
"I..." John looked down at himself, trying to determine if he was, in fact, okay. "I'm fine. But the Witch of the Wastes was here. She's seducing my sister!"
"John!" Sherlock tugged the man up as quickly as he could, leaving him lying near the edge of the dock, and dived in after John.
"You are alone and have no place to go, or you wouldn't be here," Sherlock continued. "So no extended family. Brother it is then. He gave it to you, so he clearly wants you to stay in touch, but you didn't go to him. That means you've got problems with him. Likely because he is an alcoholic."
Just as John was truly beginning to believe he was going to die on that ground, so close to the body he had examined only that morning, the creature disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. Panting, John raised his head to find Sherlock crouching over the circle, the chalk lying nearby, his hands in the air in mid gesture.
“There you are!” said Sherlock, smiling. “The robbery was a dangerous, reckless attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having found nothing, they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.”
John knitted his brows as he prepared himself for the shock of opening his eyes. He cracked the lids slowly, but the light that entered nonetheless felt as though it were slamming his brain with a physical force.
"Cases," Sherlock murmured, moving over to the fire and settling in the black chair across from John's.
On the screen, Sherlock watched paralyzed as Sebastian unbuttoned John’s jeans and, with one fluid, practiced motion, ripped them down as far as his spread legs would allow. John began flailing, trying to get out of his restraints. Sherlock could see a trickle of blood from where he was pulling on his shackles.
The suspect rushed out of the alley and around a corner, but John was right on his heels. He rounded the corner only seconds after, spotting the suspect as he darted into a set of abandoned flats. With a burst of extra speed, John pushed after him, determined not to let the murderer get away.
Sherlock growled. "Ignore it! It's Lestrade and I am in no mood to argue over that foolish princess again," he said, moving to his own chair.
John felt the heavy drag of sedation as he swam again to consciousness. It annoyed him. He despised being sedated. It made him feel dim and sluggish.
"All the vampires have been gone for hundreds of years," he said. "There is no way one could have remained without being noticed for so long."
He needed to do something! He needed to solve a case. Catch a murderer. Dash through the streets of London with John.
“Sherlock,” John said, his voice breathy, “I don’t have many people in my life that I care deeply about. I can’t even keep my girlfriends straight. But you. You are like a lighthouse in a stormy sea. I… I need you. I can’t see my life without you. I…”
"John has sustained many serious injuries that have required immediate attention," Dr. Azarian said, tension knotting in his eyebrows as he looked up at Sherlock from across the table, "but one in particular is proving quite... well, difficult."
“Simple,” Moriarty said. “We’re going to solve a few little puzzles, that’s all. Each puzzle is a test. You and John will take turns. If either of you fail, there will be… consequences. However, should you succeed, you will be one step closer to freedom.”
He growled and unfolded himself to pace around the room again, much to the annoyance of everybody who occupied the room.
"Huh? Pursued? Wait..." but the stranger had taken his hand and set off, all but dragging him behind.
“Would have been easier with a guide?” John’s voice suggested amusement, which picked at his nerves.
John hesitated. For some reason he couldn't fathom, he was reticent to have Sherlock so close to him, touching his naked side. But, he had little
There was blood though. And he couldn't tell where it was coming from with all that damned debris in the way! All he could see through the piles of wood and metal was John's head and right shoulder. But, what was visible from his vantage point didn't look bad, considering.
He entered the castle and made his way directly to the fire, collapsing into a red armchair nearby and taking several deep breaths. He hadn't realized how exhausted he had become. He spend several long minutes with his eyes closed, relishing the soft chair and the warmth of the fire.
“Well,” he said, “Dr. Watson is in sepsis. He has very severe infections in his lung, leg, and shoulder that have traveled to his blood system.”
“We saw him,” Alec said, nodding at his father. “Didn’t we dad? Dad saw him from the bedroom window, and I saw him from the back passage. Dad had just gone to bed, and I was smoking a pipe in my dressing-gown. We heard poor William call for help and I ran down to see what had happened. The back door was open when I came to the foot of the stairs and I saw two men wresting together outside. The intruder fired a shot, William dropped, and the burglar rushed across the garden and over the hedge. Dad saw him as he reached the road, but then lost sight of him. Of course, I went straight to William to help him, so I didn’t pursue the man.”
When the door to the cell opened and Sherlock Holmes stepped in, Sebastian was not surprised in the least. In fact, he was rather looking forward to the meeting. He had been disappointed that Sherlock had chosen not to take Moriarty up on his little offer during the game. Perhaps he would make up for it now. A little good old-fashioned revenge.
John tensed as she came closer and closer. Then, just as she had reached the area covered by the net, Sherlock pulled out the mirror. The woman hissed, covering her face with her arms and Sherlock shouted, "now!"
Dr. Azarian cleared his throat, interrupting what was quickly escalating into fight and reminding both Sherlock and John that somebody else was in the room with them.
That left his leg. Sherlock had watched John hit the floor. He had hit it feet first. That had protected his head from more damage, but it meant that his leg had taken all the impact.
The voice went silent and Sherlock could hear footsteps retreating down the tunnel. He stood facing the darkness, John behind him. He didn’t want to turn around. To see John’s expression. To face him.
“In the army,” he said finally, “there were always a few guys who just couldn’t help but make trouble. They were obedient to their commanders, but other than that, they were just… chaos. They would be deployed and would do things that… Well, the military didn’t much like that kind of thing to get out, so they were often discharged without explanation. No record. No justice for the victims. Nothing.”
Sherlock’s eyes shoot open. Five minutes? How could he possibly deduce the combination that quickly?
Sherlock waited. He wasn’t afraid. John knew everything about him. He had nothing to hide. There was no way this truth could rattle him.
"I..." she hesitated. "Yes. I will. But only if I can remain undiscovered. I refuse to be driven out of this country."
It had been several weeks now since they had decided to lure Moriarty out and they were steadily and publicly working their way through Moriarty’s associates. It had been difficult and dangerous work. These were not petty criminals. One had been a quite high-ranking government official, and several were trained assassins. But they had managed to expose eight people so far. The blog posts had been John’s idea. And a good one too. Nothing more humiliating that being the subject of John’s blog.
“If you were going through a hard time,” he said, “if you were going through something really difficult, what would make you feel better? What would you want your boyfriend to do for you?”
Molly's eyebrow's raised a bit higher, but, to her credit, she didn't flinch. Instead, she gave Sherlock a rather piercing look before glancing over at an empty corner of the room.
John stirs slightly in response to Sherlock’s voice, but he doesn’t answer, and his eyes are still shut tight.
“But it isn’t John’s turn,” Moriarty says. “I’m sure you’ll figure it out, my dear. Oh and John, if you hesitate at all when he tells you which syringe to use, I’ll shoot Sherlock.”
“Only way,” Sherlock said impatiently. “If I can get Moriarty’s attention, we’ll be able to use him to get to Sebastian Moran.”
"Working on the assumption that Dr. Watson is suffering from a compression injury, we would relieve the pressure on the injured section of spinal cord and stabilize the discs in the region."
“I need you to believe me,” John said. “I need you to know it was true. How I feel… What I want… I need you to…”
Sherlock was relieved. He had expected his brother to catch on without Sherlock having to divulge anything indiscrete. Sometimes his brother’s intelligence was useful.
“We’re going to walk now,” Sherlock began guiding John through the row, careful to shield John from others while not at all minding if he trampled anyone in their way.
When the rescue workers had finally secured John and pulled him out of the hole, Sherlock had pushed his way through the medics and placed a hand on his arm. Logically he had known that John couldn't feel it--that he wouldn't know and it wouldn't help. But Sherlock needed the reassurance that John was real. That he was there and physical and solid and alive and
Sherlock was indeed surprised. It would be difficult and would hurt, but John could likely do that without further injuring himself. He turned to help John up.
“It’s so good to see you Dr. Watson,” he said, stepping back to examine John. “Looks like you’ve been in a spot of bother.”
As the days wore on, John began entertaining himself by making extra notes in his healer's journal. When making remedies for certain patients, he began adding notes, such as "Mr. Anderson's remedy to dry up the sinuses. However, as it is to be given to Mr. Anderson, it might as well provide a bit of wit. The man's a blubbering idiot" or "Mrs. Turner's herbal soothers, which must also work to keep her from gossiping or I'll never get any work done. Perhaps she needs some nice lodgers to keep her busy, though I certainly feel sorry for their ears!"
Then he felt a sudden, sharp, burning pain in his shoulder. He looked down in surprise, seeing blood beginning to soak through his shirt.
The emotional part wanted to rage--scream or fight. The irrational part wanted to bargain. The doctor in him told him that he needed medical attention--needed to asses the level of damage and ensure no further damage.
When he was not tending to these duties, however, John continued attempting to decipher the spell. He had made pages of notes, most of which he had almost immediately discarded, and had even attempted creating a potion based on his interpretation of the ingredients. It had produced nothing but a strangely smelling muck, which John had immediately thrown out.
“You two are going to get yourselves killed one day,” Angelo said passively. “Let me get a candle for your table. More romantic.”
Wizard Holmes rolled his eyes and took a step closer, moving into John's personal space and examining him.
"What did you..." but before he could finish, a sharp pain in his shoulder and leg took all thought of the witch from his mind.
As he handed the plastic cup back to Sherlock, he finally registered his surroundings. Hospital. That would explain the fog in his head as well. Pain killers.
"Er... right," the young man continued twisting his hat in his hands. "Well, I'm Bryan and I'm here about my uncle. He was murdered and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. We weren't terribly close, but I just can't let it go. He didn't deserve that and he does deserve to have justice now."
“John,” he said. “I’ve narrowed it down to two containers, but I can’t tell between the two. I’m going to have to guess. The wrong one will electrocute you. I’m so sorry John.”
“Well, it all started at the Acton estate, just down the road. Few nights ago, they had a robbery. Not common around here, but the weirdest thing was what was taken. They took all kinds of things—a random book, two plated candlesticks, an ivory paperweight, and a ball of twine—but absolutely nothing of any value. Authorities are dumbfounded.”
"Nothing," she continued smiling at him. "I just want to spend time with your lovely sister. Do you have some kind of problem with that?"
He stopped and took stock of his surroundings. His senses were overwhelmed by the various stimuli of the forest. He was used to the city. London had its own flora—one that Sherlock knew as his second nature. This forest, however, with its smells and noises and shadows and never-ending damn foliage was distracting.
“Sherlock, if that’s really how you feel,” John said, keeping his gaze, “then that’s nothing to be sorry about. It’s good. Sherlock, I was afraid you weren’t actually capable of loving anyone. I had no idea you felt that way. I’m… I’m honored. The great Sherlock Holmes only loves one person and it’s me? I… How in the world did I deserve that?”
Sherlock simply smiled and swept out the door, leaving John and Molly to stare at one another in shock.
"There are very old legends," Sherlock said, "that mermaids could be turned human by sorcerers if they were either able to find true love in seventy two hours or drink the blood of their lover."
She draped her arms around Sherlock before he could stop her, but he delicately stopped her from hugging John, afraid she might knock him over.
"Where does Sherlock go all the time," he asked one day as he sat by the fire, working fruitlessly on the spell Sherlock had left him, yet again.
His head was pounding.  His left shoulder ached pitifully. His chest screamed in protest with every breath. His entire body felt bruised, as though he had taken a tumble in a cement mixer.
And then, as he gazed at the bedside table, he realized something that made his breath catch. As was standard with any hospitalization, he was hooked up to an impressive array of medical equipment, all of which was turned on, fully functioning, and, he assumed, making
The door shut firmly behind John, who stood at the edge of the field of glass. Suddenly, John flinched, though Sherlock could not see what had caused it.
“Then, of course, there was the paper found on the body,” Sherlock continued. “It was clear that it formed part of a very remarkable document. I have given the original to the inspector, but here is a picture of it. Do you see anything suggestive about it?”
John was hunched up in the far corner of his bed, prevented from falling only by the guard rail, which had been slightly raised near the head of the bed. The sheets were a tangled mess, his injured arm was cradled protectively near his body, and his injured leg was splayed out at an odd angle in front of him. His face was deathly pale and he was not breathing.
The fluorescent lights beat down in the antiseptic room, throwing uncomfortable chairs, cheap linens, and various machinery into stark relief. The antiseptic smell of excessive use of cleaner permeated the room… hall… building. In the corner, one of the machines beeped a regular, soothing rhythm. Behind the door, people could be heard shuffling about, giving reports, and barking orders.
The silence stretched out between them. John stared at Sherlock, trying to reign in his rising frustration and anger. Sherlock stared back, his face unreadable.
Sherlock too was restless. He needed to be back on the streets. He needed to be locating Sebastian Moran. He needed revenge. But he couldn’t bring himself to leave John’s side.
Rather than the moorland where he had entered the castle, John found himself looking out on a completely unfamiliar port town, bustling with morning activity. He moved to the door and opened it, sticking his head out. He was looking at the moorlands, a few kilometers north of where he had entered the castle. He shut the door and moved back to the window. The port town bustled with activity, birds landing and taking off from docked ships and children playing in the streets as their parents tried to round them up.
The camera cut to the new room and Sherlock saw what had made John pause. The new room was long and narrow. Just like the others, it had one door at each end. At the far end, dangling in front of the exit were three syringes on strings. That didn’t bode well. But between John and the syringes, the floor was covered in broken glass. John had no shoes.
Sherlock prepares himself to be blindfolded and taken somewhere as well. He hopes he’ll be taken to John, but of course that would be too much to hope for. Still, maybe when he is untied, he can do something to get them out of this. In his current position, he wasn’t much help to either of them.
John reached out, trying to stop him, but Sherlock kept moving forward. There was nothing he could do. He was going to lose everything.
The result was immediate. Air rushed out through the small tube in a rush. Sherlock sighed in relief, but didn’t allow himself to relax yet. Although he had now treated the pneumothorax, John was still not breathing.
“The damage to the nerves is extensive,” the doctor repeated. “However, I expect the damage to the nerves controlling Dr. Watson’s bladder and rectum to heal over time. He will have to use a catheter for some time, but he should regain function. Thankfully the bullet missed his spine, so he should have full control over his limbs.”
It wasn’t. Sherlock had, in the very depths of his mind, wanted to kiss this man for so long. Wanted to hold him and be held by him. Wanted to press his lips against John’s—to feel his strong body against his own. This, however, was not how he had imagined that happening. Far from it.
John had glanced to the side and found he was no longer surrounded by a teaming crowd in the middle of the main street, but was alone with the mysterious man in a small alley he had never noticed in all his years in the village.
Sherlock was confused. He already knew he was John’s best friend. John’s words were touching. He had never thought of himself in that way before, but why was John so embarrassed?
He raised his hands hesitantly, threading them gently into John’s short hair. Surprisingly, John leaned slightly back into them, almost as though he enjoyed it. Sherlock was afraid it was an involuntary action and that John would feel bad about it later, but then he noticed John’s hands. They had at some point risen to Sherlock’s sides, where they were now pulling him closer.
John walked back into the clinic he had left, it seemed, a lifetime ago for the first time since the Witch had cursed him. He immediately felt claustrophobic and weak, wondering why he had wondered back here, of all places. He realized then that he simply had nowhere else to go.
The memories came flooding back. A shot, loud and reverberating. Sherlock on the ladder. Another shot. He had to stop him. Had to save Sherlock. Had to…
"...John," a soft, familiar voice broke through John's panicked fog, though it was distant and muffled. His mind felt weighted and he fought hard against the darkness that threatened to pull him back down. He wanted to find the source of that voice.
"Oh, that's because the real house is in Porthaven," Mrs. Hudson explained. "The other locations are portals."
They slowly examined room after room of the house, Sherlock barely saying a word. John followed as best he could, his leg slowing him and causing him obvious pain. Finally, they reached the elder Mr. Cunningham’s room.
Sherlock stopped suddenly, almost causing John to run into his back. He pointed and John looked over his shoulder to find a patch of trees wound round with thick vines.
He was in the middle of spinning around to pace back across the room when his progress was halted, rather abruptly, by a petite figure in a lab coat and a pony tail.
"Yep, that's the one," Mike said cheerfully. "Though you might be in just as much danger with him as you would be with the witch."
Six weeks pass. Sherlock ensured that he and John have a steady stream of cases, most rather simple, but some with a bit of legwork after John’s impressive performance at Reigate. John got better, little by little. He is too distracted to mope, he is eating again, he is so exhausted at the end of the day after a case that he actually sleeps, and even the nightmares have subsided.
Sherlock did nothing to hide his delight as he moved over to his chair while John settled the client into another chair.
Would you be interested in a sequel? It would go through the aftermath of the ordeal, John's recovery, and the hunt for Sebastian. Let me know with a comment if you're interested.
"Other members, however," Dr. Azarian continued, "believe you may be suffering instead from a compression injury."
And Sherlock tugged John's free arm and John followed him, stumbling slightly, into their flat as Sherlock expounded on their next case and how he needed John to rest because they were going to the crime scene in a few hours. Sherlock tugged him directly to his chair and John allowed himself to fall into it.
The utter anguish he had felt when he didn't know if John was alive or dead. The anxiety he experienced any time John had been out of his sight since his injury. His panicked need to prevent John from agreeing to this surgery--to prevent him from any possible further injury or trauma.
“You’re first option, Sherlock,” Moriarty explained, “is to let Sebastian shoot John wherever he sees fit. It may be a non-fatal shot to an extremity—painful but not likely to cause lasting damage. Or he might shoot John in the head. Up to him. And you, of course.”
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the doctor announced that he was taking John off the respirator. Sherlock nearly cried from relief.
Sherlock didn’t bother responding. He rushed into the room to find John awake, staring at the ceiling. He was clearly in pain and Sherlock cursed that damned doctor, whose bedside manner was about as good as Sherlock’s.
He had scooted himself back to give John some space, but he still couldn’t stand to meet his eyes. However, he needed John to know the plan. He needed John to remain safe until the end of the game and the best way to do that was for Sherlock to take the last dare and for John to take the last two truths.
Sherlock examines the bed. Nothing special about it, except how unspectacular it is. It appears to be the kind of bed that would be used in an institution of some sort—cheap and simple. For example, it could easily have been utilized by…
"After you were stabilized, Dr. Azarian discovered a small pulmonary contusion in your left lung, which prevented full gas exchange and caused your respiratory distress. It was small enough to avoid detection before your surgery, but big enough to cause problems once the lung collapsed again. You've been in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator for three days while your lungs and heart recovered."
“Sherlock,” John continued, “I still trust you. I know you’ll get us out of this. Trust yourself too.”
John’s entire body was shaking and his breaths were shallow and pained. He had stopped screaming, but was now moaning.
"Oh," Sherlock mouthed before bouncing out of sight and back into sight a moment later with a glass of water and a straw and mouthing, "Here."
He attempted shifting his position slightly, trying to find some comfort, but succeeded only in increasing his discomfort. When he was particularly distressed, Sherlock had once told him that his body was betraying. Now John's body was doing much the same--refusing to obey his orders and, worse still, distracting him from even the simplest coherent thought.
“Nothing,” Sherlock repeated. “I’m not going to do a damn thing to you. I won’t touch you. Neither will Mycroft’s people.”
“No,” Sherlock said. “Well, yes. Aside from everything that just happened, something happened a while ago and…”
“Further,” Sherlock continued, “This was a shot in the dark, but a good one. The handwritings belong to men who are blood-relatives. It may be most obvious to you in the Greek e's, but to me there are many small points which indicate the same thing. I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing. I am only, of course, giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper. There were twenty-three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you. They all tended to deepen the impression upon my mind that the Cunningham’s, father and son, had written this letter.”
Plus, he hated Sherlock seeing him like this--useless and weak. Each time he was taken for a test he came back feeling more dehumanized and humiliated, like a lab rat being tortured. He knew his doctors were doing their best for him, but that didn't make it feel any nicer and he didn't want Sherlock to see it.
Sherlock remained silent and moved to the right side of his bed. His face was a mask of neutrality, but John could read the tension in his body. John wanted to apologize for what he'd said, or how it had come out, but he didn't know what to say.
"I got that," John said, watching Sherlock begin to untangle what he now recognized as a net. "I meant, why did the murderer do this in the first place? A vampire would make sense, but if this isn't a vampire, then why drain people of blood and keep it in buckets?"
The rumours were there, of course. Two bachelors living together and spending all their time together. Of course there were rumours. But to think there was any merit to them… Sherlock didn’t have those sorts of feelings for anybody. Did he?
“Get your head together, dear,” Moriarty said seriously to Sherlock. “You’ve still got one decision to make.”
John glanced out the window again, surprised to find the sun had risen. He looked down at his notes and realized he hadn't actually done any work. Frowning, he pushed the notes into a pile and made his way into the clinic to face another day of the same thing he had done the day before.
“Or,” Scarecrow’s voice turned dark instantly, “I could just shoot John in the head and have it over with.”
He felt a hand on his arm and tried weakly to tug it away, but it remained tightly grasped. Then there was a hand on his other arm and a blurry figure in front of him.
John had gone quiet. Clearly the reemergence of someone from such a traumatic time in John’s past was affecting him. Sherlock couldn’t imagine. He didn’t know what to say. What to do. He kept hold of John’s hand.
“Yes, brother,” Mycroft said patiently. “No one man alone could avoid our attentions for long. Colonel Moran has help.”
"JOHN!" Sherlock's yell was somehow both angry and sad, and it surprised John so much that he stopped talking and just stared, wide-eyed, at Sherlock. "Shut up! I know I'm not obligated to be here. Don't you see that I want to be here?"
Once they were finally in their seats, Sherlock let go of the breath he had been holding. John, unfortunately, seemed still to be holding his.
"Let me," Sherlock was crouching beside him, looking at the cuts with an expression John couldn't place.
Sherlock moaned again and John glanced over and found, much to his shock, that he had begun emitting some sort of green slime.
He has also started the blog again, writing his romanticized little stories about their cases. It seems to bring him joy, though without the use of his left arm, he is even slower at typing. Sherlock notices, however, that he has not written a blog about what happened at Grimes Graves.
"You have a dog?" John stared at the thing as it wagged its tail in her lap. "I thought you hated dogs!"
"Did you see Dr. Azarian out there?" John asked, pulling his hand away from his ear and shoving it under the sheets.
Sherlock was happy to let her believe that it was only the events at the Graves that were causing John’s problems. He nodded.
“Before going into this I would draw your attention to the fact that if Alec Cunningham's narrative were correct, and if the assailant after shooting William Kirwan had instantly fled, then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the dead man's hand. But if it was not he, it must have been Alec Cunningham himself, for by the time the old man had descended several servants were upon the scene. The point is a simple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these men had had nothing to do with the matter. Now, I make a point of never having any prejudices and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so in the very first stage of the investigation I found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by Mr. Alec Cunningham.”
As one of Market Chipping's only doctors, John's father made a fairly decent living. However, after their mother's death, their father turned to alcohol, becoming worse as the years went by, and eventually becoming unpredictable and violent. As the eldest, John was left to protect and tend to his sister and help keep the clinic running when his father was indisposed. As the years went on, John became more and more responsible for the clinic as his father's alcoholism became worse. He resigned himself to a life of tending the clinic and trying to care for his sister, who became more rebellious and difficult as time went by.
Several minutes later, after convincing security not to escort Sherlock off grounds, Dr. Azarian had then insisted he spend the next hour "getting some fresh air" while he took John for scans to determine if he'd done any damage to his leg. Sherlock had protested, but had been told that it was either that or he would be barred for good.
“There are several positions I could place you in that would allow me to bear your weight quite easily,” Sherlock said, nonchalant.
He spent the rest of the day trying to control himself and decided, instead, to simply close up early and work on his remedies. Just as he was closing the clinic door, however, a woman dressed in an extravagant silk gown pushed her way in.
They had been practically begging for a break all this time and he wanted to give them one now, just after Sherlock had dropped that bomb on John.
John raised an eyebrow, but didn't argue. He certainly knew less about ghosts than Sherlock apparently did. And he certainly wasn't going to argue with a wizard about a spell.
"Er, yeah?" John had no idea why Sherlock was reiterating what they had already discussed, but he thought that, if he just didn't interrupt, he would probably get to the point eventually.
Beside him, Sherlock had sunk into the chair. John glanced over and saw that he was frowning. He couldn't fathom why though. John felt truly hopeful for the first time since he had awoken.
Sherlock closed his eyes and pursed his lips. He had no choice. He opened his eyes. Propped John’s head against his left hand, and with his right, slapped him across the face as hard as he could.
She stared at him a long, silent moment and John thought he might as well give up. Then, she blinked and stopped baring her teeth.
When the castle was close enough for John to see it clearly, he stopped and stared. The building looked as though it were held together by magic and will power alone. It was incredibly large and vaguely oval shaped, with large turrets pouring smoke out of the top. It appeared to be constructed of an amalgam of bits and pieces of other structures -- what looked like a cottage room here, a sleek metal room there, a large panel between. Beneath the structure were large, bird-like legs that appeared to be made of some sort of metal and were slowly moving along the ground.
Sherlock watched all this feeling helpless. He had no idea how to help John. Everything he did seemed to make things worse. He tried to talk to John, but John shut down the conversation. He could no longer even touch John without causing him to flinch. He even tried cooking for John, though he couldn’t blame him for rejecting that effort. Sherlock was no cook.
"I'm going to catch a falling star," John replied, lugging the boots to the door and turning the nob to Chipping Valley.
“This is your chance, Sherlock,” he says. “Sebastian probably won’t even hurt John. And then he’s all yours.”
“Round one,” Scarecrow said loudly, as though announcing to an invisible audience. “Truth or dare Sherlock?”
There had been significant muscle and tissue damage to his outer calf, though the doctor noted that he was hopeful the muscles would still be functional if the nerve damage were repaired. He thought back to his anatomy courses. Nerves were strange creatures. Delicate and yet resilient. They could be so easily damaged and could be gone beyond repair. But they could just as easily survive extreme trauma and grow back good as new. Nerve damage was incredibly difficult to predict.
Sherlock leaned down quickly and planted his lips on John’s, stopping his stammering. John opened his mouth immediately and Sherlock invaded with the eagerness of an American army. He cupped John’s face in his hands. Before he was ready (when would he ever be ready?) he pulled away again.
After a moment of collecting himself, he glanced up to find Sherlock looking somehow even more stricken. Sherlock's hand had wrapped more tightly around his own.
Sherlock reached the entrance of Grimes Graves more quickly than he thought possible. Before he started climbing, he glanced at the floor where John’s blood had pooled. It looked like so many crime scenes he had seen before, but this was different. He knew that blood. It sent a chill down his spine.
Sherlock paced up and down the small room, restless and manic. He was running his hands through his already wild hair, making it stand on end.
“He’s out of surgery, by the way,” Mycroft added. “His doctors would like to talk to you. Bad area to take a gunshot wound, I would think. Could be complications. Best get back there, I think.”
“It was a puff of something gaseous,” John said flatly. “If I were to guess, I would say nerve gas.”
When he arrived at the indicated location (a rather disturbingly difficult task) and caught sight of John, his heart stopped and he collapsed to his knees amongst the rubble.
Now that he’d established that John was alive and likely to stay that way for at least a while, he sat back on his heels to examine the rest of his body for injuries.
John looked at Sherlock with concern evident on his face. A mistake like this was not at all common for Sherlock. But Sherlock simply smiled at Mr. Cunningham.
"Language, language," Irene tutted. "I'm afraid that's not your choice. Harry seems quite happy to spend time with me."
with the name Sherlock Holmes printed neatly on the cover. He picked it up and began reading. After only a few moments, however, he sat it back down with a scoff and moved away.
He paused, and this time John was certain of the hesitation. Sherlock licked his lips and took a breath before continuing and, had John not been quite so medicated, he would have been much more worried by this.
He settled into what he had come to think of as his chair, though it was hard and uncomfortable and certainly not anything he would have chosen for himself under any other circumstances.
Sherlock, Dr. Azarian, and two other doctors sat around a bare table in one of the hospital's small conference rooms. They sat in tense silence for several long minutes, Dr. Azarian refusing to divulge any information until a nurse returned with confirmation that Sherlock was indeed listed as John's next-of-kin.
Sherlock sighed and moved back to John, helping him to a sitting position. He was looking better now that he could breath properly.
Since John had woken and realized the extent of his injuries, he had been distant and agitated. Sherlock didn't know how to face him. He didn't know what to say. What to do to make him feel better or more at ease. He had no skill for these kinds of situations, which seemed to require some kind of delicate tact that he simply did not possess.
He stood and walked around the bed and left the room. He didn't say a word. There was nothing he could say that would make the situation better. Better to stay silent.
"No," Sherlock dismissed him offhand, pushing his hand away and shoving himself unsteadily to his feet. "John. I need to..."
"Do you believe her?" John and Sherlock were back in a carriage, making their way to the last crime scene.
John turned, but didn’t seem to understand. He was already inside the building, framed in the doorway, the ghostly light from the alley making him look ethereal.
John watched him warily, feeling his body shaking beneath him and his thoughts becoming more and more distant, until they smelled of dirt and sun and sounded like distant gunfire and explosions and reverberated with heat and noise.
"She didn't hurt me," John lied, thinking it better than the truth given that he seemed have have sustained no lasting injury from whatever she had done.
John's eye's widened and flew down to his leg. Sherlock's hand was resting, palm down and fingers splayed wide to cover as large an area as possible, on his right thigh. He felt the blood drain from his face. He looked silently back up at Sherlock.
"Yes," he said before John looked down, "I suppose you have been rather occupied. But you are a doctor, so I see no reason why you shouldn't look at over the information yourself, particularly considering you had so little say in the decisions we had to make to this point."
John’s lips were warm—a striking difference from the last time Sherlock had felt them. It comforted him. It meant John was well—physically at least. Mostly.
Sherlock's eyes widened and he looked over at the human mermaid, who was now smiling menacingly at them.
The man, whose name was Cedric, lived in a large house on the edge of Porthaven. When they arrived, they found the house closed off by the detectives, but Sherlock ignored the warnings and moved inside, John close after him.
"Well, that's quite a curse," he said after a moment. "But you've scared John and nearly made Mrs. Hudson go out, so you'll have to go."
He glanced quickly over the information he already knew: pneumothorax repaired surgically with tube insertion; broken ribs, dislocated shoulder and associated sprain; concussion; multiple minor lacerations and contusions.
Grimacing, he looked around the room. The fire was burning contentedly in the grate, its face turned toward the door. John glanced over his shoulder at the room. In the daylight, the piles of papers and boxes and items looked dusty and chaotic, with the exception of a small desk on which sets of strange items sat.
Sherlock led John through each of his sense. Five things he could see, four he could feel, three he could hear, two he could smell, and one he could taste (you, John said, making Sherlock smile a little).
“But Sherlock,” John said, sounding less than optimistic, “there are trails everywhere. Somebody’s been all over the room.”
John took a deep breath, examining the chart in front of him carefully. His hand was clenched tightly on the pliers. Letting out the breath in a long, slow exhale, he opened his mouth and inserted the pliers.
"Well," Dr. Azarian gave him a sheepish look, "I'm afraid their results were inconclusive. Some of your team believe you are suffering from Brown-Sequard syndrome, which is an incomplete spinal cord lesion causing contralateral paralysis. This would be permanent and untreatable."
He looked down at his right leg then. It was still a jumbled mess of metal and gauze peeking from beneath the blanket. When he looked back up, he was certain the look on Sherlock's face was one of guilt.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but John stared at him, resolute. He closed it again, frowning and looking petulant. They stared at one another for a long moment before Sherlock let out a sigh, turned on his heels, and stalked out of the room.
Then he closed his eyes, berating himself for asking such a stupid question. His brain clearly wasn’t working properly.
Regardless of his father's shortcomings, John admired and loved him. He was incredibly adept at creating remedies and discovering his patient's ills. He taught John a great deal and John used this knowledge to help his sister and father when they were ill. Although he wished for something greater, John found that he enjoyed healing. It gave him a sense of purpose.
He examined the items on the only vaguely clean table in the room. There were several clear containers of various shapes and sizes, some of which contained liquids or powders. There was also some kind of machine that looked like a very small telescope, but pointed downward.
Sherlock glanced back at John. Maybe this would be easy. He would simply choose truth. He had nothing to hide and if he avoided choosing dare, he couldn’t be made to do anything reckless.
"Yes," Sherlock murmured, throwing down one folder and picking up the next. "Yes! Yes!" he said, getting louder with each folder. "That's it, John. Come on!"
John took a shallow breath, then leaned forward and began to untie the shirt holding his leg to the plank. Although he did it silently, Sherlock could tell he was already in pain and struggling to breath bent over like he was.
“I will find you,” Sherlock said. “I will find you and I will make you feel everything you’ve made John feel.”
Sherlock let out a breath he had been holding, steadied his slippery hands, and began sawing in the muscles of John’s shoulder.
“Well, come in! Come in!” Colonel Hayter said enthusiastically. “Let’s get inside. I’ve got your room all set up.”
“I would willingly give five hundred,” said the older Mr. Cunningham. He examined the paper. “This is not quite correct, however.”
John arrived back at the castle to find Sherlock pacing up and down by the fireplace. John could immediately tell that he was agitated, but had no idea why. Mrs. Hudson was burning rather low, which John thought was a bad sign.
John raised an eyebrow, wondering why Sherlock would ask such an obvious question. But he was so worked up that John didn't question. Instead, he moved carefully around Sherlock to the fireplace and picked up the spell from amongst his notes. He had hardly touched it when Sherlock snatched it from his hands. His brow furrowed as he read.
“Rules,” Moriarty exclaimed. “They key to the next door is in the safe in front of you. The combination of the safe is four numbers. I’ll give you each of the numbers. All you have to do is pull one tooth for one number.”
“Sherlock Holmes,” the voice said. “I can tell from here that the bullet didn’t go all the way through John’s shoulder. Be a dear and get that bullet out of our Dr. Watson.”
His attention was torn away from those thoughts and back to John, who was still not breathing on his own.
He stared up at the ceiling, cocooned in his muffled silence, unsure where to begin untangling himself and hoping that when he did he wouldn't simply fall apart completely.
Sherlock stared at him. What else could have happened. What else had he missed? What else had he not deducted?
And when they stopped laughing, they just a breath's length away from one another, staring into each other's eyes. And the air felt heavier and the room seemed quieter. And Sherlock whispered, "may I?" and John nodded.
The shot rang out so quickly that Sherlock didn’t have a chance to even think about putting himself between the bullet and John. He watched as John’s body jerked and he let out a moan.
John had never used seven league boots before. In fact, he had never seen them in person before he met Sherlock. He found the experience incredibly unsettling--rushing through space as though he were some kind of star himself. But, to his delight, he reached the moors in no time at all and was just in time to see the stars in their full glory.
“No!” Sherlock gave John an apologetic look and reached gently into his pocket to retrieve the gun. John grunted but did not protest.
Sherlock felt his wrists begin to bruise and lacerate as he tried futilely to get to Moriarty and Moran, but the effort was wasted. It simply caused Moriarty to laugh again. John, on the other hand, sat stoically. He allowed no expression to cross his face.
He turned to find John on the ground, covered in his own blood, moaning in a low, weak voice. Sherlock was at his side in a moment. He picked up John’s hand. It was limp. He squeezed it, trying to get John to respond. John didn’t.
"I said no," he repeated, his fury building until he felt as though it were radiating visibly from him.
. The compounds from the curare plant--toxiferines--cause neuromuscular paralysis, but the human body converts succinylcholine to potassium. The victims would have been paralyzed and died of a heart attack, but the only sign would be a slight elevation in potassium."
"Slightly elevated potassium levels where the only anomaly," Molly said, frowning. "Everything else was completely normal. No poison."
“John!” Sherlock put his hands gently on either side of John’s face and began tapping his face—not hard enough to be called a slap, but hard enough to get his attention.
Sherlock pause his pacing and tried to relax his fists, which had become so clenched that his nails were digging into his palms. He glanced over his shoulder at John's door, which was still frustratingly closed. He resumed pacing.
"The... the herb shop," John said, glancing over his shoulder and spotting a long, strangely dense shadow moving quickly along the alley.
“No,” John said honestly. He knew what they were about to do would hurt. A lot. It would probably cause more damage to his already damaged leg. And his lungs burned with every breath. But they had no choice. The killer could come back at any moment and finish the job. He may even target Sherlock next. That couldn’t happen. It couldn’t. He wouldn’t let it.
“Maybe simple to you, Mr. Holmes,” he chuckled, “but an idiot like myself must require some explanation, I’m afraid.”
He felt his consciousness slipping from him -- his lungs no longer hurt and he was beginning to feel peaceful -- when he felt something soft against his mouth, prying it open. Then, suddenly, he felt air rush into his lungs.
The paramedic smiled and led him to the second ambulance. On his way, he heard the other paramedics shouting at one another.
He gently placed his fingers on John’s wrist, where he felt a soft thudding. A pulse—a bit slow, but there.
"I tried everything," Sherlock sighed. "Reasoning with him. Getting the doctor to speak with him on my behalf. Presenting him with data. I even tried interceding to halt the surgery and provide more time for persuasion. Nothing worked."
"Yes, yes. Do keep up," the man rolled his eyes, but somehow managed to maintain John's gaze. "There was a murder. Quite a nasty one, in fact. I narrowed it down to one suspect, but he had an alibi for the time of the murder. He was spotted by several people at the local inn from midnight until well after five in the morning the day the murder was committed, at around 3:30 am . Now of course you know the rest."
Sherlock took a deep breath and began pulling. John held onto him as hard as he could. His bad leg was stretched out behind Sherlock, dragging with every step. He was trying his best to use his good leg to limp along, but he was walking backwards and was having to lean heavily on Sherlock.
"Hey," Lestrade said suddenly, shooting John a rather intense look, "I don't suppose you would try to convince him?"
Almost as soon as he said it, he saw a flash in the sky. Moving quickly and without thinking, he stepped forward in one boot in the direction of the star. He landed just short of the star and, pulling his foot out of the boot, began running as quickly as he could manage. In just a few steps, he was within reach of the star.
"Oh, just give him time," Mrs. Hudson said softly. "He's just in a mood. He gets like that sometimes."
"I wish you would get me before you do these kinds of things," Lestrade grumbled as he approached the scene.
“Perhaps you’re right,” he says. “I do love a good toy, but I have no idea what you see in these ordinary people.”
"Oh no, deary," Mrs. Hudson laughed. "I don't want money. No. I want you to help break my contract with Sherlock."
"So the king has lost more of his family members," Sherlock growled. "Perhaps he needs better security."
"Interesting fact about mermaids," Sherlock said. "They are quite vain and a bit magical, so they project a beautiful appearance. But mirrors reveal their true form."
In fact, John likely had infection in his chest where the pen had been inserted as well. That was a lot of infection. And with his loss of blood and shock, he didn’t have much reserve to fight off infections. He might have already gone septic. Which would cause septic shock. Which, on top of two other causes of shock…
The cab had parked directly in front of the flat, making the journey from the vehicle to the door only a few short steps. Nonetheless, it took John a couple of minutes, leaning heavily on his newly re-acquired cane, to get inside.
“And here’s your choice,” the man said. “One of you is going to be shot. Not fatally, of course. Not yet anyway. You choose which one of you I shoot.”
But John was waiting on him. John was alone in a dark tunnel (called a grave, no less) with life-threatening injuries, fighting for his life.
“Yeah,” she said, “a distraction, you know. Get me out of the house. Spend some quality time together. A date.”
Finally, he looked up at Sherlock, who was still standing at the side of his bed, but was now staring off into the distance.
“Nothing,” Sherlock said. “Lestrade, I need you to go back to the hospital. John should be out of surgery soon. Somebody needs to check on him.”
Sherlock's world focused to a point as he remembered the events leading up to his current confusion.
With amazing quickness, Sherlock moved so that he was standing in front of John. He grabbed John’s good arm, pulling it firmly forward so that John lost his balance. He caught John with his shoulder and in one fluid movement, stood. John was now perched on Sherlock’s shoulder. With a bit of maneuvering, Sherlock had John in a classic fireman’s carry.
Sherlock had pulled out a small instrument and was examining the body closely. John moved over to stand next to him, looking over his shoulder and trying to find anything on the body that might indicate cause of death. The body looked completely normal -- no obvious marks or injuries and no signs of asphyxiation. John was disappointed -- he had wanted to be useful, but he was clearly out of his depth.
An then the nurse had caught his attention and he had barked at her to get John oxygen and to call for the doctor to check him for further damage.
Sherlock sighed. He hadn’t realized that he did, in fact, have secrets he didn’t want to discuss. How could he have forgotten about this?
One night, after a particularly interesting and challenging case, Sherlock and John are lying in bed together, laughing about the hijinks they had gotten up to during the case. The mood is light and they are both refreshed.
John and Sherlock were sitting next to one another in the window booth of Angelo’s restaurant. The scene was very familiar. It had been the first place they had ever gone to eat together on their first case. Sherlock had taken him there to “cure” his bad leg. That wouldn’t be happening this time.
He was still too weak to properly swim, so Sherlock grabbed him around the chest from behind and began kicking hard toward the dim light of the surface. Glancing below, John could see the mermaids recovering from whatever Sherlock had done to them and starting to swim after them.
"Defense," Sherlock said, leaning the mirror against the wood and checking the trip wire, which he had tied to a plank of wood. "When I say now, pull this wire."
“All you have to do,” Moriarty continued, “is let Sebastian have five minutes with John to do whatever he pleases. As a parting gift.”
John obeyed, finding the task more difficult than it should rightfully have been. Sherlock was looking over his shoulder, saying something that John couldn't make out.
He paused, clearly enjoying himself. Sherlock glanced back at John. He looked like a ghost. He couldn’t afford to lose any more blood. And he needed medical attention urgently. He would have to catch Scarecrow in a mistake quickly.
"Well then," Sherlock said, "I suppose we'll have to begin by looking for anyone or anything that could have found out about you."
"She and I..." Sherlock looked uncomfortable. "We worked together once. She thought we were something more than we were."
Nothing happened. Sherlock let out the breath he had been holding. John reached into the container and pulled out a small first aid kit.
John was quiet for most of the car ride. He had been quiet most of the time for the last few weeks. Sherlock missed hearing his voice. He was just glad John wasn’t alone, even if he didn’t seem to be helping much.
John raised an eyebrow, wondering how in the world they would catch the murderer if she were a vampire.
“What would you want,” Sherlock asked, “If you were feeling that way? What would you want your… your friend to do for you?”
When he entered the dusty room, he was confronted with a set of steep stairs ascending to the next floor. Sherlock was already halfway up and moving quickly. John sighed and began making his slow progress up. Each step sent of shock of pain up his leg and he had to make an effort not to groan aloud. Lestrade and several other people brushed past him as he make his slow progress and John felt humiliation burn in his stomach.
"I don't believe in God," Dr. Azarian said, turning to go. "But you don't have to believe in God to believe in one man."
“I had heard of your genius, Mr. Holmes,” Colonel Hayter said astonished, “but to see it in person is quite extraordinary.”
"Yes, I am fully aware," John mumbled as he began stirring the oats and pulled out his watch to keep track of the time.
Sherlock absolutely hated leaving John alone, especially right now, but he had no signal on his phone and he had to get them help as soon as possible. There was no other way. There was always the chance that the monster would come back, but Sherlock was fairly certain he had left them for good that night. He seemed to like playing games and he played by the rules.
Night was beginning to fall and the wind was becoming bitter. John gripped his new cane tighter and forced himself to continue forward. At the rate he was going, he would never reach shelter before nightfall. And with the curse, he would be vulnerable to any creature or evil that might happen upon him in the dark. He needed to find shelter and soon.
John took a deep breath and looked at the camera. His pupils were already pinpoint and his muscles had started twitching.
Sherlock stared at his hand, still holding John’s. Then, slowly, he looked up to John’s face. John’s eyes were blinking slowly.
His patients had begun discussing the Witch of the Wastes, who had apparently reappeared after fifty years of dormancy. According to the rumors, the Witch had threatened the king's daughter, who then disappeared. The king sent his royal wizard, Wizard Sulliman, after her, but not only did he fail to retrieve her, he had apparently gotten himself killed.
"You don't have to stay," he whispered quickly, trying to pull his hand back, but Sherlock just held it tighter. Why was Sherlock holding it? Out of pity? Was he so pitiful now that Sherlock thought he needed his hand to be held like a child's?
The next painting he sees is Arachne by Gustave Dore. This must indicate that the container near it contains a venomous spider. The next is The Death of Socrates, which must indicate some sort of poison in the three containers near it.
John followed as quickly as he could, trying to ignore the pain in his leg as he listened to Sherlock's manic speech.
Beside him, John had let his head fall into his hand. He was no longer hyperventilating but was still shaking.
Sebastian stopped stroking John and moved his hand to the top of his pants, sliding it inside and starting to move down. John was barely breathing.
Glancing to his right, however, he saw Sherlock, who was sitting in the chair beside his bed, watching him closely. John noticed that his hands were resting on his thighs where John could clearly see them and he was not moving at all. He resisted the urge to sigh.
“What’s your big plan then?” Sherlock asked. If he could get him talking. Find out where he was. Maybe get him to approach. They would have a chance.
The next morning, John found he had little tolerance for the annoyances of his usual day to day. Or rather, he appeared to have lost his filter. When Anderson came into the clinic complaining that he did not pass his detective's exam, John responded, "well, that's because your using it. It would take a magic spell to give you brains. Next time try asking somebody with half a brain to take it for you." Anderson had left in a huff and John had tried to feel bad about his words, but failed.
The thing in the center of the circle was nothing like what John had expected of a ghost. He had thought they were transparent and ethereal. This was neither.
He has also gone back to therapy, as promised, though he had actually done reasonably well even without it. He still struggles with nightmares and sometimes has trouble taking care of himself (eating in particular), but not nearly as bad as after Grimes Graves. Sherlock attributes this to resiliency and will power.
He looked around at the swarming bodies and, to his shock, saw soldiers in amongst the townsfolk. They were in full uniform, just as he remember, and were running and ducking. He heard their shouts and the sound of explosions.
The inspector, Colonel, and John all leapt into action. Moving more quickly than he thought possible with his injuries, John led the group toward the cry.
Taking several deep breaths to steady himself, he glanced around the sky, looking for any sign of a shooting star.
“Oh good,” Moriarty stepped out of the shadows, moving until he was directly across from Sherlock, standing beside John, “you’re awake. It was really quite boring watching you sleep.”
"No," Sherlock growled, trying very hard to restrain himself from launching across the table at the smug doctor.
Sherlock stopped trying to step around him and looked up at his face. He was stern and matter of fact, but not being mean. He was being honest.
"Oh, he went out," the fire replied. "He said something about giving Lestrade his report. Seemed annoyed, but you know how he is."
John was entirely lost. How was this a curse? But, when he looked at Sherlock, he found that he looked as though he were upset, but trying not to show it, his face a mask of perfect neutrality.
So sorry for the long delay in posting this. There was a bit of a family emergency. But it is finally here. Thank you so much to everyone who read, and to those who left kudos, and most especially to those who left comments. You are all so wonderful!
The creature lunged again, this time for John. Without even thinking, John pulled the trigger. The bullet hit the thing square in the chest and it slowed slightly, but did not stop.
“No,” Sherlock said, “but you know John. And you understand emotions better than I do. I need to know what to do to help him.”
John was surprised at how normal her voice sounded. He wasn't entirely certain what he expected a vampire to sound like, but it wasn't like a regular woman.
“Each of the victims discovered the plant, which caused them to become targets,” Sherlock said. "He was clearly targeting somebody specific and each of the victims got in the way."
John was looking apprehensive. Sherlock couldn’t blame him. After the disaster at the theatre, he wasn’t sure he trusted himself either. But, after a bit of persuading, John had agreed to come along on the holiday anyway. Apparently, he still trusted Sherlock some.
Alone in the room, John stared at his leg, a tangled mess of metal and gauze lying useless before him. He knew it was a long shot--that it would probably come to nothing and might make things so much worse. But, as he thought back to the bedsit and the cane and his life after Afghanistan and before Sherlock Holmes, he knew he really had no choice at all.
"Yes dear," the fire replied. "I'm bound to this house because of that contract. I want you to break it."
Sherlock thought hard, bringing up a map of the Grimes Graves in his mind. He had memorized the map before they set out on their faithful trip. He’d only been able to find one map—a simple one without much detail. And having never been in the mine himself, his understanding of the layout was… uncertain. He hadn’t expected to find himself in this situation, or anything like it. Where should he start? He needed to think, but his mind was buzzing.
"Fine," it said bending down hesitantly as John put the pan on top of it, "but I'm still not your housekeeper."
"Then follow me sir," he said, gesturing down a hallway with a tired expression. "I'm afraid you have a difficult decision to make and very little time in which to make it."
"And why in the world would I have done that?" Dimmock shot back. "I don't know anything about you. You come waltzing in here acting as though you have a right to official evidence..."
Sherlock blanched. He already knew some of what John could tell him, but he had honestly been avoiding the information from his own brain. There had been nothing he could do about it and, therefore, no reason to worry about it yet. But now…
Sherlock felt like the walls were closing in. His vision blurred and he realized with some surprise that he was crying.
"Of course," Sherlock said, smiling at him. "How could she have killed Cedric if she couldn't even enter his house."
"Yes sir," she said, leaning her hip against the table. "For Dr. Watson's treatment. The surgeons would like to get started right away sir, so if you wouldn't mind..."
“Yes,” John said finally, resisting the urge to lean his cheek into Sherlock’s. An urge that surprised him thoroughly.
Sherlock put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed gently. He swallowed painfully and tried to take a deep breath, but found that he still couldn't manage breathing.
Sherlock silently thought that it wasn’t luck at all. Sebastian was an expert shot. He knew exactly what he was doing.
John grinned back, despite himself, and glanced back down at the file, reading quickly though the information provided.
John was running, pulled down by the familiar weight of his army gear, dirt in his eyes, mouth, and throat, and shouts all around him. The Afghan sun beat down on top of him like a physical force and, no matter how long he had been there, he never seemed to grow accustomed to it.
John thought he must have still been half asleep because he saw Sherlock's mouth move, but no words came out. He frowned up at Sherlock, confused. He thought he saw a troubled expression cross Sherlock's face, but then it was gone. Sherlock moved closer.
“John,” he said gently. “you’re having a flashback. I need you to breathe. Breathe with me. Inhale, 1 2 3 4, hold 1 2 3 4, exhale 1 2 3 4, hold 1 2 3 4. Good. Again…”
“No,” Sherlock said bluntly. “None of that. I’m getting you out of here. You will survive. I promise.”
"Come on John," Sherlock said impatiently as John pushed his aching body slowly up from the chair. "We've got an appointment with a ghost."
John felt cool air on his arm and opened his eyes. He found himself a few steps behind Sherlock in a strange city with houses and buildings unlike any John had ever seen.
“No,” the voice said slowly, “that’s what you would say at a speech about John. I want to hear how you
"Yes, of course," he shot back, "I just said I tried reasoning with him. I told him that the risks outweighed the..."
“Someone like you would never understand someone like John Watson,” Sherlock says bitterly. “Toys. That’s all you’ve got. Toys. Things to play with. You wouldn’t understand a human relationship if your life depended on it.”
“I had hardly got the paper, however, when the two Cunningham's were on me, and would, I believe, have murdered me then and there but for your John’s quick and incredible intervention.”
He stepped forward slowly, as though any sudden movement might wake him. Cautiously, Sherlock placed his hand on John’s good hand. He was clammy, but warm to the touch. He held the hand gently, staring at his… friend? Partner? What were they now?  It didn’t really matter, he supposed. Especially if John didn’t…
“Oh, that was fun,” the voice gloated. “Shall I do it again? See how many shots I can fit in one shoulder?”
“First though,” Sherlock said, “I wanted to confirm my suspicions about the handwriting. I endeavoured to create circumstances that should prompt Mr. Cunningham to write the word ‘twelve’ on a piece of paper.”
"Standing up to the Witch of the Wastes?" the woman had turned to him and was now smiling in a way that did nothing to put John at ease. "That's certainly brave."
"Harry and I don't get on," John murmured, turning back to the food. "We haven't seen one another in years. Harry is a drinker."
Like its predecessor, the next room, room five, is mostly bare. Inside, John finds a single bed in the center of the room, chains attached to each of the four legs. The bed is simple—little more than a cot really.
John, Sherlock, and Colonel Hayter sat comfortably around a roaring fire in well-stuffed armchairs, each cradling a cup of tea.
"Out!" Sherlock growled, not turning away from John. He heard the nurse push the cart out of the door a moment later.
"We have the means of death," Sherlock said, pacing up and down the small room. "Now we just need the murderer."
Sherlock sat confined in the same ugly, uncomfortable, plastic chair he had sat in after the explosion, doing the exact same thing he had been doing then--waiting. It wasn't literally the same chair (he was in a different waiting room in a different part of the hospital), but it may as well have been. It certainly felt the same.
“It’s Sherlock. John’s in trouble. I need your help. Now!” Sherlock fought to keep his voice under control.
John and Sherlock both gasped for air. Sherlock, arm still wound tightly around John's chest, sent several more blasts down into the water before pulling John toward the ladder to the dock. When they got there, he had to all but pull John up the ladder because John was still having trouble even moving his own legs.
Then there was the most important detail. In front of him, tied to an identical chair, sat John Watson, still unconscious.
He turned back to the spell, reading over it for what seemed like the thousandth time. After almost a week and a half of fruitless effort, John was growing more and more frustrated. Sherlock had said the spell was simple, and yet he could make nothing of it. For a simple spell, it seemed rather complex.
“Carry me up the stairs?” his tone was almost humorous. “Sherlock, there is no way you would be able to lift me and carry me up this flight of stairs. I may be short, but I’m not that small.”
