on his way to certain death anyway. Might as well have some fun. Better life through chemistry and all that rot.
“But I would have to convince Dimmock to let me have access to the scene before tonight; rain is forecasted, and it will wash away any evidence that could still be collected. And he’s being particularly
Molly bursts into the room. “Bill had spare tyres for his car and was able to jump-start the ignition. He’s making sure the coast is clear. We’re okay to go.”
‘I know,’ had been the solitary answer, and that was that. Mycroft had left later in the evening, in time for supper in London, and Sherlock stayed behind in his small cottage with his doubts and memories.
“Of those? As I told you, what you have in your hands is all from this last week. About two hundred.”
Sherlock stares at the offending item a beat longer, then leaves the kitchen to tend to his beehives.
. Molly’s boyfriend is Moriarty? John’s head is swimming, reeling with the effects of whatever drug he had been sedated with and this new information.
“They collected evidence and whatnot but the threats haven’t stopped. Whoever is doing this is not afraid.” Greg takes a deep breath to steady himself. “Look, John, all I’m asking is for you to meet him, at least. It’s five thousand quid a week, man.”
Sherlock turns around in his chair to get a better look at John. “Do we really have to do this again?”
Sherlock glares at his violin case and the window. He’s still furious: obviously, blending fruit to oblivion had not helped to release pent-up energy, and he’s considering drawing postmodernist screeches from the violin that would put Penderecki to shame.
how the easy camaraderie of yesteryear has turned into this insuperable distance. They’re half a metre apart but it could be kilometres or eons for what it’s worth. And in the end, it was John who tried to bridge the gap by showing up on Sherlock’s doorstep with no baggage other than the weight of regret and sorrow.
“I hope it’s okay to do it on a stretcher. I’d rather not have foreign objects on other surfaces. Sorry. Oh, it-it’s completely clean, I promise!” She giggled nervously.
He stares at the closed door, ponders how to proceed. Reminds himself that Sherlock is an adult and prickly when it comes to make decisions about his own well-being. And, well. He does have a live-in doctor.
It is Sherlock who breaks the silence and drags a chair out of the table. “Please, do sit down. I take this is not a social visit.”
“Hey, Sherlock.” He sounds surprised but pleased. In the background, Rosie makes splashing sounds. Ah, bath time.
, he reminds himself. “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. I am concerned about you, and want you to feel better soon, that’s all. I imagine it’s not all that fun to have pain all the time.” He pauses, but there’s still no reply. The silence is dense, a barrier stronger than the flimsy door. “Just… please, just let me know if you need anything, alright? We can monitor you at home. Maybe the stone will pass soon.”
“Oh please,” Mycroft scoffs. “You enjoy it all: the limelight, the adulation. Needs must – the show appearances and dull interviews are all part of making sure you are not just a passing fad.”
“NO!” John’s bellow startles Sherlock as it penetrates him, icy and sharp. It strikes Sherlock what the cold sweat running down his spine means: he’s afraid.
. Everything is absurd and pointless. He wants to curl up under a blanket and never crawl out again. He desperately wishes he was back home in London, surrounded by quiet solitude, interrupted only by sweet sounds coaxed from his violin.
Sometimes, he feels a hundred years old, as if the life he once lived weighed on his shoulders, left only with bittersweet memories and a shrinking future enshrouded in greyness. Yet, an undefined longing for more of the things he resolutely refuses himself intrudes his thoughts every so often: shared touches, laughs, tears. Companionship. Love.
Is ‘lover’ even the correct word? John is so much more than a warm body in his bed. John is his best friend, his steadfast companion, his sounding board, his conductor of light. Even now, the early morning rays of sun that peek between the curtains seem to find John, caress his skin, make it glow warm and golden and smooth.
John walks back to his flat, the events of the night twirling like a merry-go-round in his head, garish colours and too-loud noises and vicious cycles all coalescing into one big ball of anxiety. He locks the door behind him and makes a bee-line to the kettle.
Ellie looks around in awe. She has stepped in what is obviously the living-room, large windows facing the darkening Baker Street, a few snowflakes still lingering on the window panes, framed by heavy curtains. The old-fashioned damask wallpaper would give the room an oppressive atmosphere but whoever decorated the flat used different colours and patterns on all walls, giving it a modern touch. Then, there’s the décor: eclectic, heavy bookshelves sighing with the weight of old tomes in contrast with glass display cabinets.
“Sherlock, I…I don’t want to get confused about what I am doing here.” He chances a side glance to Sherlock, who is sitting up on the bed, sheets tangled around his waist, a bony knee jutting out from a fold, and a perplexed look on his face. “You pay me to be your bodyguard. My job is to keep you safe. That is what I do.” He spots one shoe.
John is still here. He stirs awake with a groan. Sherlock feels a twinge of regret over making John sleep on the sofa – his shoulder will probably give him hell. They are not young men any longer. John flutters his eyes open and meets Sherlock’s. “Morning.” He sits up, legs still tangled in a sheet. He had stripped down to vest and boxers for the night but hurriedly reached for the rest of his clothes. “I’ll just— refresh myself and be on my way, then.”
“Ah, I’m terribly sorry, Molly, it was my mistake to bring up that model; it is indeed more adequate for male users. I’ll, um. I’ll just pack this up and leave, eh? Sorry for wasting your time.” John put down the purple dildo he’d been holding all this time, pointy side up; it was a model with a suction cup, and it now bobbed happily at them from the stretcher.
thing. Tedious. It would only make John concerned, and he would pity Sherlock. Best to leave John be in peace and quiet with his betrothed.
John knows for sure their lives are forever entangled, and that this is simply their next adventure. The affirmation of a love so deep, a connection so strong, a promise so unbreakable, worth so much more than the five thousand quid resting on his hands.
If someone told him years ago he would be retiring in his early forties to the countryside, tending beehives, a small flowery garden, and a vegetable patch, he would have rolled his eyes and snorted in disbelief. Sherlock Holmes, leaving London and becoming
Sherlock had been ready to dismiss this new person as simply background noise. And yet…something about John Watson’s presence captured Sherlock’s attention. There was the obvious, of course: ex-military with a history in security services, probably at MI5 – that would be where Greg had initially met him. Irritating that he missed the medical training long enough for Mycroft to point it out to the room, but it’s of no consequence. Except…it is of consequence, isn’t it? Ah, yes, obvious: John had enlisted in his capacity as an army surgeon. Hands that kill, hands that heal.
He stares at the cracked paint on the ceiling above his bed. He does not want to go downstairs for a while. It is too much. For all that he claims to be a sociopath, Sherlock is not unmoved by Irene’s death – asking for her phone is proof enough of that. And John cannot face him and his grief.
With the moment gone, Sherlock quickly excuses himself to his bedroom, leaving John to deal with the broken pieces.
Alarm bells ring in John’s mind, the push-pull of contradiction tearing at his guts. A memory of hopeful, then grieving, clear blue eyes, not that long ago but in what now feels like another lifetime.
“Oh, that’s just great,” John explodes. “Your own brother, and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac! Damn it, Mycroft!”
John smiles. The late hour is settling a blanket of fatigue on the two men, but they walk downstairs. John runs ahead of Sherlock, making a beeline to the bathroom and turning on the cold and hot water taps until the mixture falling in the bathtub is just a hair below scalding. He hesitates for a moment, then walks into Sherlock’s bedroom, picks up fresh pyjamas and takes them back to the bathroom, laying them neatly on a stool. He glances nervously over his shoulder and notices Sherlock has caught up and is hovering undecided between the bathroom and the bedroom doors.
“Yes, I have it here,” Irene replies and turns to fiddle with something off-screen – a laptop, John assumes. A few moments later, the file plays:
John grumbles an inaudible reply against Sherlock’s chest. He was having quite the lovely lazy morning in his lover’s arms, all soft-sleepy, waking up slowly to find himself comfortably nestled against Sherlock’s naked form.
When Monday comes, Sherlock is as prepared as he can be and more unprepared than ever. He wakes up while the dawn still stretches pale and pink; he inspects the beehives, despite having done so just yesterday; he verifies – twice – the child-proof locks he installed on the lower kitchen cabinets. He’s polishing the stovetop (again) when he hears the same car sounds that haunted his driveway just a few weeks ago. He battles his eagerness in welcoming John and Rosie and waits instead until John knocks on the door.
Two days later, a stuffed duffel bag unopened at his feet, John sits on the narrow bed in his small flat. Shoulders slumped, his elbows on his knees, John cradles a small crucifix in his hands. As he absentmindedly rubs the black stone with a tired thumb, he goes over a conversation which had happened just a few hours earlier but might as well have happened in another lifetime:
The hand at Sherlock’s nape slides down to the top button of Sherlock’s shirt. Deft fingers pop the button open, and brush gently across the exposed breastbone. Sherlock shivers under the gentleness of this caress and breaks the kiss for a moment, allowing John to drop his lips to Sherlock’s jaw and pepper it with feather-light kisses. Sherlock lolls his head to give John better access and can’t help a low moan when John roams down his neck with an occasional flick of a tongue.
“—and as you must realise, the chief superintendent wants to use this as a positive reinforcement of the Met’s image to the general public. Such a high-profile case being solved so swiftly, with those kids being rescued before they could be harmed, it’s really stellar.”
Victor releases a forced laugh and finally turns to John, giving him a perfunctory, derisive look. “Would you like something to drink?”
Molly reappears, panting with the effort from running. “The car’s not working,” she gasps, “tyres slashed and the ignition’s dead.” And before anyone can ask, “Bill’s too.”
“It’s not–” John shakes his head and chuckles, despite his simmering anger. “It’s fitted with a radio transmitter. If you press hard enough on the stone, it will send a signal. If you find yourself in trouble and I’m not there, you just–just press it and I’ll find you.”
Outside, it snows, large, fluffy flakes silently falling to the ground; indoors, the group settles by the large fireplace in the living-room after dinner. Mycroft sits quietly in an armchair, engrossed in his mobile. Molly and Sherlock chat amicably, drinks in their hands, sitting cross-legged on the sofa. Bill and John half-follow their conversation, half-lose themselves in memories they dig out of each other. The time flows slowly, and John finds himself relaxing for the first time in weeks. They are safe here, cocooned in the middle of nowhere, silence and stunning nature as their only neighbours for many miles.
something he is not being told, something big that scared Greg into hiring John Watson. He had deduced it early enough, but their reactions in the kitchen allowed Sherlock to read them like an open book.
How arrogant he had been. These days, he can’t even imagine returning. Mrs Hudson was teary but understanding, claiming she would not rent out the flat
“How??” Sherlock sounds alarmed. He has caught John’s expression and is now visibly bracing himself.
There is something about the possessive hand on Sherlock that is making John’s stomach turn but when he decides to do something about the two men’s far too intimate proximity, Richard whispers something in Sherlock’s ear and they navigate through the crowd to reach a side door in the room. John knows the room is unlocked but able to be locked from the inside, as he prepared it to be a safe room if needed. He uses Mary’s momentary distraction as she replaces her empty glass of champagne with a full one on a passing tray and follows the two men as fast as he can without tramping over guests and calling unnecessary attention to himself.
A small content warning for description of the early stages of a panic attack. If this could be triggering for you, stop reading at "There’s limits for everything" and continue at the next section break.
Fortunately, John takes the lead and changes the subject before things get even more awkward. “There’s no harm done, Mycroft, nothing to apologise for. Not about what happened last night. But there’s something more, isn’t there?” He tries to gentle his tone for his next question. “What have you done?”
After some time, Sherlock excuses himself to go to sleep. John follows him up the stairs and cannot help noticing how Mycroft watches them go with an unreadable look on his face. John and Sherlock walk into Sherlock’s room, and while John checks the latch on the window, Sherlock teases him: “Will you also look under the bed for monsters?”
He almost lost John’s friendship. In fact, Sherlock is not quite sure if John has forgiven him. Panic edges into his thoughts – what if John thinks this was the final drop?
“Donovan?” Greg catches her eye and nods towards the exit. She gives a few final instructions to a constable and follows Greg out of the posh Fitzrovia house and into the cold night, a question mark on her face.
To this, John attempts to (patiently) explain that these preparations are needed, everything is almost done, and the banging and clanging will soon go away and if he could
. It’s no longer a descriptor for a physical place, four walls enclosing material belongings and personal effects.
Grudgingly, Sherlock acquiesces. “Very well. Although the Grammys are the last thing I want to have on my mind. Insufferable bonfire of vanities.” He throws himself on the chair next to Mycroft’s bed.
Sherlock’s heart is thudding so hard he is sure he sees John’s hand pulsate in tandem with the systole-diastole twin beat. His throat constricts and thickens. He aims for nonchalance. “The bullet scar is there, obviously, but there’s very little residual pain from the wound.” He fails miserably.
. It’s not obvious to the casual viewer — one has to stand as close as Sally is to notice eyes filling and spilling, the slight shaking on his frame, the ragged breaths.
sounds from the flat above. Mrs Hudson flinches but recovers quickly. “I suppose you could call it that, an experiment of sorts.” She smiles unconvincingly and sips her tea.
John glances at the man, who’s standing closer to Sherlock than he was just a minute ago. He’s all smiles and light touches on Sherlock’s arm. Jealousy grows heavy and dark in John’s stomach but it’s not his place to control who Sherlock wants to talk to.
. “We need to get you out of here.” He retrieves the mobile from his back pocket to call Molly but the network signal is iffy. He turns to the house and shouts instead, “Molly! Molly!”
“That I’m walking away now.” John shakes his head to prove his point. “It’s not happening. I’m all in. I’ll be here in whatever capacity I’m allowed to.”
“The Southampton guy?” Sherlock says. He’s confused as to the relevance of Mycroft’s past relationship to what’s happening now but he lets his brother finish talking.
The relentless passing of time, each day ticking farther away from the day Sherlock threw himself from the top of Barts?
“Sherlock? Sherlock!” John collapses on his knees, drops his gun on the floor and reaches for Sherlock, who is coughing and red-faced but seems otherwise unharmed. “Are you hurt?”
Mycroft Holmes is as tall as his younger brother, and shares the same intelligent, blue-eyed gaze. He is stronger built than Sherlock, but always impeccably elegant under layers of pristine shirts and tailored three-piece suits. John has rarely spoken to Mycroft in all the time he’s been working here but has come to think of him as a highly organised person, quiet and maybe a bit mysterious, almost withdrawn. He sees him every day, of course; Mycroft is Sherlock’s personal assistant, after all, and is constantly catering to his whims, smoothing his way out in the world, and soothing hurt egos when Sherlock is in one of his acidic moods.
There is an awkward short interlude where neither of them knows how to react to this. John’s unhelpful mind decides to quickly think
a cop: they wouldn’t do a damn thing. The letters are clean from prints or any other clues; so long it’s just threats, there’s not much to do.” Greg pauses and scratches his stubble. “Sherlock, he is, well. He’s a special character. Not much scares him, to be honest. But he
John raises an eyebrow. “His life?” John does not wait for an answer: he walks down to get closer to Sherlock, and arrives just in time to hold back an overeager fan trying to climb up to the stage.
. Inside, the place is small and dimly lit; the wood-heavy decor contrasts with bright chequered tablecloths, tables adorned with small flower vases and candles. Country music plays from tired speakers, joining the soft clinking of cutlery against plates and muffled conversations. The smell of greasy food permeates the stale air. For a Tuesday evening, the restaurant is surprisingly full; John had called ahead and reserved a small table in a corner. Sherlock surveys the room in amusement while removing his blue cashmere scarf and grey coat, which John takes and hangs on a nearby peg. They sit down and accept menus from a distracted waiter.
“No!” John shakes his head, dismissing Sherlock’s reassurances. “I have been thinking and thinking and thinking about this, and all I could think was ‘You should have seen it. You should have seen it, John Watson.’ That she wasn’t what she said she was, that she had a past, that it was too much of a good coincidence when she showed up in my life, that, that, oh
Sherlock purses his lips and the ice breaks. His eyes soften and the torrent of emotions he’s been holding in a precarious dam flows over his face. “I… I do, John.”
“Anderson? He’s my assistant choreographer.” Sherlock’s eyes flit between John and Greg as he speaks. “I really do not need another bodyguard. Irene has handled the few small incidents that have occurred. Mostly overeager fans wanting to touch me and take selfies.”
“I do hate to repeat myself but in deference to your sleep-deprived lower intellect, I restate: you are a hypocrite.” As she stares in shock at him, Sherlock continues. “After all, you manipulated your colleagues, in particular DI Lestrade, into thinking I was a fake, just because you despise me. And after being so thoroughly debunked, you begrudge me.” He takes a step closer to Sally, eyes never leaving her face. “I would rather be a sociopath than a well of resentment.”
Sherlock holds Mycroft’s gaze and the realisation of what he is saying swirls inside him. It is not like Mycroft to show his hand so easily – perhaps his defences are down due to injury and medication.
“I meant it when I said your loss would break my heart,” says Mycroft, reminiscing their words just before the world came crashing down.
. He hates to admit it, but his treatment at the hands of his captors in Serbia have left their marks, physical and (damn it all) emotional. Nightmares populate his head, a miscellanea of what happened in Serbia and on the rooftop of Barts and the pool and Moriarty. John’s blood in his hands. Those are the worst ones.
Not that he does it on purpose, he ponders while brewing a double espresso with his second-best beans for an exhausted biology student (obvious, look at her backpack and the mismatched earrings). While Sherlock enjoys his job due to its experimental nature and the unlimited amounts of caffeine, how is he to pass the time if not by trying to deduce his clients lives and habits? Making coffee is hardly an intellectual activity.
Sherlock is a stealthy walker, but John has his military training, and Sherlock’s gait is unmistakeable in the wet grass behind him. He feels Sherlock slow down to a stop. Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s shoulders and nuzzles his temple.
Sherlock’s still wearing his clothes from yesterday, barely able to distinguish between ‘yesterday’ and ‘today’ – time seems to have stopped the moment he saw blood sputtering out of Mycroft.
Sherlock’s own flat is an extension perched at the back of the main building, two-storeys high. The ground floor is accessible from both inside the house (near the studio where he spent most of his day today) and outside (towards the patio) but hosts little more than a hallway and some storage, mostly outfits and other personal effects. To the casual passerby, this would look little more than a wardrobe. The first floor hosts the flat proper, with a large living-room where Sherlock stands now, a small kitchen and his bedroom and en-suite. There is also a door accessing the main house on this floor, leading to the rooms where his closer staff lives.
I swallow sharp shards. Ice fills my stomach, my morning tea threatening to make its way up. “Hypothetically speaking, if I were to accept these conditions, what would you want in return?”
Sherlock stops dead in his tracks and arches a questioning eyebrow at John. “Um. Now that you mention it. You are thinking UTI. Not consistent with back pain, though.”
Mycroft chews on his bottom lip for a moment, and Sherlock spurs him to say out loud what he’s still brooding over. “I’ve tried to understand why he wants this information,” Mycroft says with an edge of irritation, “but all I get as an answer is that he is your biggest fan.” He finishes with a weary sigh. “I hate not knowing.”
Greg clears his throat again. “Sherlock, this is John Watson. John, Sherlock. We don’t really do titles here, first names are the norm.”
Outside, the storm quiets down as the evening settles. Indoors, the atmosphere is thick and stifled, and not even the open windows help in airing the house. The treacly mood sticks to the walls, settles itself as a layer of syrup over everything. They should just call it a day, go to sleep or at least pretend they will, but the newfound routine sees them settling in the sitting room, with a torch and a few flickering candles.
To say John is surprised might be a rather large understatement. He finds himself with a lapful of Sherlock Holmes, clear eyes gazing thoughtfully at him.
“Thanks, Irene, good idea.” Despite their mutual dislike, John and Irene have come to a sort of silent agreement where both acknowledge each other’s competence and try to keep it civil and professional.
Mycroft expects Sherlock to clam up and avoid the subject altogether in his usual haughty fashion. However, Sherlock instead does something he hasn’t done for a long time with Mycroft: he opens up. He lowers his eyes to the fluffy carpet that runs the length of the library, opens and closes his mouth in a few false starts to a conversation and finally lets go: “He’s not my Dr Watson any longer.” His voice is small and tired, and it breaks Mycroft’s otherwise well-sealed heart.
Sherlock imbues the final note with an extra vibrato and opens his eyes. “Ellie Miller. Welcome; what do we owe the pleasure?” He sets down the violin and releases the bow.
“Um, no, oh god, I mean, yes, it is, but it’s all a misunderstanding, so it’s fine, you see, I wanted a big hose, oh god not that kind of hose, I mean, it’s not what you think–”
“That wasn’t a very impressive deduction, Sherlock.” Her chuckle could have been teasing, but there is a definite steel to it underneath it all. “Anyway, yes, you are correct.” She leans forward conspiratorially and announces barely above a whisper: “We have three people in our marriage, and it’s taking its toll. John is in love with someone else.”
“I’ll be fine with the air mattress out here, Sherlock.” John smiles one of those fond and slightly exasperated smiles that have not illuminated his face like this for so very long.
Greg shifts uncomfortably on the sofa; he sets down his mug and rubs his palms on jeans-clad thighs. “John…if you’re half as good as you were when we worked together, you’re the man we need. Please, will you at least hear me out? As an old friend? I’m really worried.”
“Of course it’s about Sherlock, everything’s about Sherlock,” John spits out, but casts his eyes down to the black-and-white tiled floor, not quite able to face Mycroft.
A familiar voice barking orders registers itself in the back of his rapidly dissolving awareness, and before he knows it, two strong hands heave him from the floor. When had he dropped to his knees? He lifts his head and meets John’s eyes. There’s panic there, but also fierce determination, and Sherlock can finally breathe. John wraps a protective arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and navigates them through the crowd to an emergency exit. The two doors he’s yanked through barely register in his half-conscious state; he feels as if he was drunk, reality fragmented around him and the world tilting off its axis. He’s unceremoniously thrown into a car – soft leather, recognises the smell,
I am trying to formulate an appropriate rebuttal when Mary continues: “I am ready to make an agreement.”
More? In the heat of the moment, Sherlock had not reacted to this. As he reflects on the context of John’s admission, he becomes aware that there’s more than a request for forgiveness in the missive. There’s urgency prickling at Sherlock’s senses to go and tear open the envelope, find out what it is, but at this point it feels like a betrayal to his own principles and to John. Clearly, it is something that John thinks prudent to hold back until the right moment comes.
So, John was a bit testy, and his interruption might have sounded snappier than intended. He knew that because Sherlock stopped abruptly, and after a moment’s hesitation started to tidy up the mess of microscope slides and notes and soil samples scattered on the table. “I’m… sorry, John, I’ll just—”
As a third and a fourth week pass, John wonders aloud when Sherlock’s appointment with a urologist had been. How had he missed this?
The next day dawns cloudy and heavy, but the snow livens up the landscape. The group spends the day entertained with various activities: Sherlock composes with the help of his violin, Molly helps Bill with chopping wood for the fireplace and cooking lunch, Mycroft alternates between thumbing through his mobile and reading a book and, John thinks, pointedly avoiding him, and John himself hovers near Sherlock most of the time. He is his bodyguard, after all, which is as good an excuse as any to listen to the melodies Sherlock coaxes out of the violin.
“I worry about him. Constantly.” Mycroft tilts his head and bores his eyes into John’s. “But I also know he tires quickly of his new toys. And thus, I find myself worrying about you, instead.”
Sherlock is not happy about all the commotion. On a good day, he huffs in disgust at the noise and buries his curly head into a pair of noise-cancelling headphones; on a bad one, he shouts at everybody, John included, to keep quiet.
Sherlock locks eyes with John, who seems to be gaining courage to say something important rather than pausing for dramatic effect.
“Yeah, I agree with you,” Greg says. “He’s not the type to hire bombers and assassins, I don’t think.”
Sherlock gives him a glare glacial enough to think the winter is coming back. John pushes onward, “It’s mostly anecdotal evidence but there’s a couple of publications. I researched two, um, unorthodox methods that
His eyes stray over the diverse flower arrangements as he combs his curls with his fingertips. He has to admit to some unease about their presence in the room, and is relieved John had taken a more than cursory look with that metal detector. He needs to change into his costume soon enough, and is about to get up from his chair when his eyes rest on a simple bouquet of soft pink rhododendrons lying on a stool. An unusual choice for this time of the year, as it is too soon for most of the common species to bloom, and not the sort of flower one would import from warmer climates, like most of the vapid roses and tulips covering almost every surface in the room. As he reaches for the bouquet, Sherlock notices a small shimmery purple envelope tucked between two of the larger flowers. Curiously enough, the envelope seems to hold something bulky instead of the expected card. Sherlock plucks the envelope out of the arrangement, opens it, and slides out a silver USB flash drive. He turns the small item in his fingers – there is nothing remarkable about this drive except the way it was delivered.
He almost accepts a bullet in his head instead of complying with Moriarty’s ‘request’ to wear the vest; but it’s no choice at all anyway, as like this he at least has a chance to somehow warn Sherlock, make him run for his life, bid his time. He has to hope they can manage out of this situation, or that at least Sherlock can.
Having finished his phone call, Victor intervenes again. “That won’t be a problem, darling. I’m sure John here will see to it that we have something better for the gate and install whichever alarm systems he wants, isn’t that right, John?”
“Hmm, not as such, no.” Sherlock snatches the book from John’s hands. John is about protest but the prospect of going out with Sherlock is more appealing than the insipid novel he was trudging through.
“But it’s not me you want.” Mycroft drops his hands, and to John’s continued surprise, his face loses the softness of the kiss and becomes angry. “I’m surprised, John. An efficient man like you. Why stop at one brother when you can fuck both? Or is it just the boss who is interesting enough for you?” Mycroft tries to turn away but John stops him with a firm hold on his arm.
“Irene? Irene!” John looks around. The small lobby has only three doors: the one to the lift, the one to the suite and the emergency stairwell, so it’s useless of John to shout after her. He does it anyway, opening the door to the stairwell to make sure she’s not hiding out there for some mysterious reason. Finding the place empty as far as he can see and hearing no reply back, he strides to the door of the suite and tries to open it. Locked. Not unoccupied, though – he hears noise from inside.
It’s slightly voyeuristic behaviour, yes. He’s gradually becoming more and more fascinated by his new bodyguard. Watson acts cold but is genuinely interested in protecting Sherlock; he will make Sherlock’s life miserable because he is so convinced it’s the right thing to do. During the day, he stands in a military pose in watchful vigil or barks orders; but at night, he watches Sherlock’s YouTube channel. The man is a mixture of contradictions, a dance of dualities, and Sherlock is confused.
Mycroft has to be forcibly dragged in. The door closes behind them just in time for an explosion to shatter the boathouse and rock the building with the loud blast.
John looks between the three of them and the computer for a moment before he decides to hit the play button. A distorted voice sing-songs:
Mycroft looks at him again. He’s trembling, very slightly so, but Sherlock does not miss this. Nor does he miss the frightened look on Mycroft’s face. “You, Sherlock. He…” Mycroft tries to pull himself together, “he asks for bits of your daily life, like what you eat…your favourite flowers…the colour of your pants…what you are doing at a given moment. And so…”
John turns abruptly with a disappointed frown. “You must remember I told you there were things I didn’t say then. You,” he points an accusatory finger at Sherlock, “of all people, don’t forget a bloody thing.”
John’s hair smells a bit minty, a bit sweaty, a bit sexy. Sherlock still can’t believe his luck, that he gets to have this now, John in his arms, the assurance that yes, his feelings are returned. It had all started with an awkward conversation late in the evening that evolved into confessions and apologies and promises. And kisses, and more kisses, and hunger, and ecstasy, and intimacy, and so, so much love.
The tattered carpet rasps against John’s naked toes as he sits in his chair and stares into oblivion.
Sherlock uproots a handful of dandelions and tries to forget. He had been getting better, he really had, but that damned letter showed up and took hold of Sherlock’s thoughts. Even unopened and largely ignored, it burns bright underneath the pile of newspapers.
Late-afternoon tea in his hand, Sherlock loses himself in his thoughts. The small back garden is quiet, the setting sun paints the lilac bushes in gold and old rose, and the buzzing of myriad insects quiets down. He wonders, not for the first time, why he has two chairs round the small mosaic-clad table – a wrought iron ensemble with swirly art nouveau patterns, bought second-hand in Worthing. Not antique, but obviously used and well-loved for many years.
“Please, come in. Thank you for coming here, I know this is not a very standard meeting place for this sort of things.”
John lifts an eyebrow, clearly not expecting ‘the road’ to be any sort of sensical answer to his speech. “Pardon?”
“And a good evening to you too, Dr Watson.” If John’s sharp tone upset Mycroft, he is certainly not letting it show. “Do make yourself comfortable. I’d like a word; we’ll drop you on Baker Street soon enough.”
She looks around and sees the usual scene: Greg Lestrade listening intently, a mix of awe and incredulity on his face while Sherlock rattles on, machine gun-like; constables and SOCOs doing their work, following
“You absolute loon, why would you think that? We have a table booked at Angelo’s tonight, remember?” He must see something in my face as I open my eyes to look at him again. Oh
And this is why her colder than usual demeanour and her presence in my flat without John raise my hackles.
“Oh, darling, don’t worry about that. I’m sure we can pass the time in some other way.” The grin on his face turns predatory, and for the first time, interest wars with discomfort in Sherlock as Richard takes a step closer.
send you an explosive device. Miss Hooper took the brunt of the damage that time. What will happen next time?”
The drive to Sherlock’s house takes a little over half hour, the cityscape shifting from the gentrified Stratford around Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park through the urban sleekness of Canary Wharf, over the Thames, and finally into the quiet neighbourhood of East Dulwich. Rows of pretty townhouses give way to hip shops and green parks. John glances at his sat nav again: this is not a usual route for him, and if he could avoid driving, he would, but the Tube doesn’t run down here, and it would have taken him twice as long with all the transfers anyway. And so, John sits behind the wheel of his silver Audi A4, trying to find the address of Sherlock Holmes.
And the next thing John remembers is Lestrade striding into the cell with an unnecessarily loud “Wakey, wakey!”
John can’t blame him. He wonders where exactly things went wrong. At the same time, he knows the blame is to be put on a system with overworked personnel, understaffed facilities, budget problems. An otherwise healthy young adult with an uncomplicated renal calculus is not going to be ranked important when there are cancer patients having their potentially life-saving surgeries cancelled or postponed. Sherlock’s history with substance abuse will always make caretakers ill at ease with pain management, even if that attitude is unfair and unjustified.
“Victor has no jurisdiction on my staff. You stay.” Sherlock gives him a small nod and walks off, decisive and all business. John stares at his back, wishing he’d find the words to say anything of importance.
“These are not just nutters on social media, Victor!” Greg says with exasperation, but Victor is not paying attention to him any longer.
“Oh, hello, you must be Dr Watson.” A young, smart looking lady stood in front of him. She was petite, with long brown hair in a ponytail, and she wore an immaculate lab coat, a name tag and a kind smile.
With the first step on the stage, Sherlock pushes away his anger. The clamour of the crowd spurs him forward.
He pries the flowers from my hands and deposits them ever so gently on the coffee table. He could have teased me for my uncharacteristic emotional upheaval; he could have been exasperated at my forgetting our dinner date; he could have been offended at my suggestion
Sherlock takes a deep breath. He’s given this same question enough thought. “What makes you think he was trying to kill Mycroft?”
“I’m sure I’d think of something else.” John watches Sherlock’s pupils dilate and his Adam’s apple bob up and down with a dry gulp. He encircles Sherlock’s wrist with his left hand, letting his fingers brush the inside of his wrist. Sherlock’s grip on the Sig slackens and his eyes glaze over; John removes the gun with his right hand, tucking it behind his back in one swift movement, his left hand sensing a strong, fast pulse. The movement brings them closer, and Sherlock releases a shuddering breath.
Sitting at the dressing table, Sherlock takes a deep breath. The appearance at the Mayan is a bit of a last minute arrangement, a surprise show to hype up his latest video and hopefully catch the eyes (and ears) of the incoming award season. It had been Victor’s idea, probably relishing how much he would piss off Watson with an unannounced outing.
, thinks Sally. But as Sherlock stuffs his hands in his coat’s pockets, slumps his shoulders as if the weight of a thousand years rests on them and continues to be silent at the floor, Sally feels her anger dissipating and turning into the only thing she never wants to feel for this man:
When enough time has passed for Sherlock’s bath water to have cooled and John’s tea consumed, Sherlock comes out of the bathroom dressed in the pyjamas John had left him. A fresh cup of tea is gratefully accepted, and the two men sit across the kitchen table, the lamp from the cabinets their only source of light. It’s quiet, the warmth from the bath emanating from both the door left ajar and Sherlock’s body, and John tries to not inhale too deeply. Instead, he asks quietly, “Better?”
Sherlock looked back and forth between John and Molly and the objects in their hands. And the quite spectacular array of colourful
Sherlock splays his hands over John’s shoulder blades and roams down his muscular back, slowing when he reaches the hem of John’s jeans. He hesitates a second, then continues his travel down John’s body and grabs his arse – firm, delectable, just the right size for Sherlock’s hands,
Sherlock is floating, adrift in pure sensation, higher cognitive functions disappearing fast. It should alarm him but somehow it doesn’t. John tastes like safety and home, his grip on Sherlock’s wrist firm and grounding.
“Unfortunately, someone found out about this and has threatened to expose me. I do not care much about my own reputation, but I am afraid this would reflect poorly on yours, brother mine.” Mycroft drops his gaze again to the floor.
“John, let me present you to some people,” Greg intervenes. “This is Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s brother and PA.”
John’s left hand curls around Sherlock’s waist. “That,” the heat of the touch penetrates layers and layers of clothes, epidermis, dermis, fatty tissue, muscle, through arteries and veins, down to the bones, “is the biggest lie you’ve ever told me. And yourself.”
Greg intervenes, “He prefers to retreat to his living quarters in the back of the house; it’s quieter there.”
“That I expect a different answer this time around, John.” Mycroft holds John’s gaze steady, his initial disquiet tucked away behind his usual cold façade. “You left Mary, moved back to 221B—”
John didn’t finish his sentence. He had stood up again and was about to organise his products on the stretcher for a proper display when he took in Molly’s horrified expression. “Um, Dr Hooper? Molly, you alright?”
“What the hell!” He’s choleric as John has rarely seen him, pacing the room to spend pent-up energy. “Is this some sort of twisted joke? Why on earth do I have to go through this torture again?”
The heavy metal door is bolted behind him. John scrunches his eyes shut for a moment against a spell of dizziness – yes, he’s still quite drunk, but the worst of it is lifting like a late morning fog.
She barks a dark chuckle, her pretty teeth flashing white at me. “That you two break whatever little conspiracy you are weaving against me. Oh, don’t look at me like that — you are good, but John is transparent. True, it took me some time to figure it out, but…” She stands suddenly; I am pinned to my armchair. Her eyes don’t leave mine. My head spins, thoughts in a whirlwind. John, in love with me? It might be true. This I cannot deduce — but Mary, who is excellent at reading people as I am reading a crime scene, has picked up something between us, something unacknowledged yet very present.
“No, I mean she’s not down there. Nowhere to be seen.” Sherlock looks up and around, perhaps hoping to see a dangling ninja on the roof.
obscure or, more likely, lying. He would not have got into this party otherwise, and Sherlock knows almost everyone on the guest list.
. Rosie grizzles but is quickly distracted by a bunny plushie John magicked out of a pocket. John turns back expectantly to Sherlock. Ah, yes, he was waiting for Sherlock’s reply.
“Don’t ‘Sherlock’ me, Miss Adler!” he booms back. “And you!” He turns a vicious finger towards Victor. “Were you ever going to tell me?”
, John.” There is a begging tone in Sherlock’s request that John cannot ignore; he therefore sits back without a single word.
“What’s that? I thought you had something against ‘brainless screeching masses’, if I may quote you directly,” he replies without heat.
with Irene Adler! She texts stupid little dinner invitations and crass innuendos just to get a rouse out of me, and quite possibly out of you!”
“What I don’t understand,” John says, pocketing his mobile, “is what Brook has to do with whoever is singing that twisted lullaby.”
John’s mood also fluctuates, between the exhaustion of a toddler’s tantrums and the quiet evenings of comfortable shared silence. Except ‘comfortable’ doesn’t quite seem to describe those moments they find themselves in when Rosie is sleeping. There’s a conversation waiting to be started and both are too afraid to ignite it.
“Yes, him. You probably don’t know the reason I ended the liaison, though.” Mycroft braces himself for what he has to say. “I found out he was underaged. Barely but still…not legal, and certainly not ethical.”
Sherlock steeples his hands below his chin and turns slowly away. “Interesting,” he mutters. “It takes some technical skill to perform this sort of interception.” He swirls abruptly back to John and Irene. “We need to trace where the interception happened. From where the message was
“Oh, I don’t know. It wasn’t all that bad, I suppose.” Sherlock observes the remaining spring roll on his plate as if it is the most interesting object in the universe, avoiding John’s gaze altogether.
“I will never leave you again.” A small kiss behind his ear. “Never,” a kiss on the temple, “ever,” another on the cheek, “ever again,” and another on his jaw. Sherlock hugs John tighter as if to lock his promise in place.
“–and the letters with graphic details about how he wants to kill Sherlock didn’t cue you in? Amazing.” John is obviously still furious at Mycroft, and his prattle is starting to distract Sherlock. Or no, not quite distract–
Sherlock narrows his eyes in mock annoyance at John’s quip, then rolls them suddenly over until he’s lying on top. John laughs; he is always delighted when Sherlock lets his playful mood come forth.
Which John translates, with the help of his mental Sherlockian-English dictionary, to ‘not fine at all’. “Can you slow down? What was in the bag?”
Sherlock softly pried the vibrator from her hand with a serious look on his face. “You have no use for this one.”
Unable to catch his breath for a proper reply, Sherlock shakes his head. John releases a shaky breath and helps Sherlock up from the floor.
To the outside observer, nothing is amiss with Sherlock. Dressed in white shirt and well-fitting trousers, he looks as polished and professional as ever, perhaps a touch on the casual side, what with the rolled-up sleeves.
The following day, Sherlock is a nervous wreck. He spends the day huffing around the house, desperately trying to think of chores that will not require him booting up his laptop. When the shadows start getting longer, he distracts himself with watering his backyard, but this is a short-term relief. He’s too wired up to gain any appetite for an early dinner. Finally, he gives up, starts the computer, and opens his e-mail.
Sherlock slumps into the opposite chair. Mycroft’s library is compact and intimate, its walls covered in overfilled bookshelves, just enough space for the armchairs and a coffee table in front of the hearth. It’s the smallest room of Mycroft’s otherwise spacious townhouse but also his favourite, the place he retreats to when he wants a quiet evening in having a book (or some hundreds) for company. Rarely, he has someone sitting opposite to him; often, that person is Sherlock, and he almost never visits.
The click of the door shutting out his team sends a wave of relief through Sherlock. Finally, some peace and quiet. Well, relative quiet, as the rather obnoxious electropop now blares from the dance floor and permeates the walls. Irene lets in a couple more flower deliveries but then everything quietens.
Sherlock hums a noncommittal sound, acknowledging Ellie’s pseudo-explanation. She sees how he knows there’s more to it, but nobody in the room wishes to continue this conversation.
“You’re right, I don’t know what you are feeling. I do know that I, well. I made a mess of things. Before. I keep on disappointing and failing you.”
The traffic into Belgravia is blessedly less heavy, and Molly is able to snake her way around slower cars to put distance between them and their pursuer. As she focuses on navigating the streets of London towards Mayfair, John looks around for the black car.
“I bet you’ve been testing soil samples from all around this place,” John teases gently, that damned soft smile back on his face again.
It had all been a blur after that. The shot fragmented his memory: someone was screaming (probably him; mortifying but unavoidable when watching life seep out of your own brother), a body slammed him into the ground (and his left knee has a bruise to prove it) and sometime later they were in a car and even later he was being pushed down on a chair in a waiting room and told in no uncertain terms that he could not follow his brother into the operating theatre.
His feet take him almost unconsciously to the intended destination, and suddenly there it is: still shiny black, fine, polished granite with two engraved words:
John is no masochist, but the way Sherlock looks at him now makes this wound, a thousand wounds worth their while. He reads naked fear in Sherlock’s eyes. And because he knows words are simultaneously superfluous and insufficient, John takes a step forward and wraps his arms clumsily around his friend’s shoulders.
Free, technically, yes; but the fact that he let himself be drugged and have his laptop almost used as an exchange coin for a blackmailer sits badly on his otherwise impeccable reputation.
Sherlock stomps to his music stand and goes through the ritual of preparing to play violin: the bow is tightened, rosin is applied, the violin tuned.
John shuffles up and takes them both in his left hand after slicking himself, his right hand smoothing over Sherlock’s ribs and resting on his waist. Sherlock gasps at the silky contact of their erections, his own hands stroking John’s hips in rhythm with his small thrusts. It’s slow and sensual, the way John rocks back and forth, his hand stroking them from base to tip. John leans in with a hint of tongue and teeth grazing Sherlock’s jaw, down his long neck, kissing his pulse point. He buries his nose under Sherlock’s chin, and Sherlock cradles his head, fingers combing suede-soft blond and grey hair strands, releasing wafts of shampoo promising a summer breeze and foamy ocean waves. John’s tongue flicks over Sherlock’s jugular notch and he resumes kissing up his neck until their lips meet again. Their position allows John to give longer thrusts, his breath puffing warm on Sherlock’s lips; he licks Sherlock’s cupid bow and sucks gently on the upper lip, then the lower. The kiss is achingly tender as John’s movements turn erratic and he babbles disjointed
Sherlock’s bedroom’s door is closed, and muffled voices float from within. Quite distinctively John’s and Sherlock’s.
He’s lucid enough to know where he is, and what happened. Clueing for looks. Got arrested. A prison cell. On his stag night. Great. Not.
. Is tonight a consequence of them being cooped up in close quarters for too long? Sherlock had admitted he wanted to go out with John because he could not do so with anyone else. Is this all that there is to it, then?
“Keep your money, Trevor, and stay the fuck out of my way. I have work to do. If Sherlock wants me out of here, he’d better say it to my face. Until then, it’s business as usual.” He spins on his heel without waiting for an answer and storms out of the office.
, and I don’t know how to tell him how sorry I am because. Because. I don’t know!” Sally explodes, her anger no longer contained, raised voice turning some heads in their direction.
Sherlock stops dead on his tracks and John stops abruptly lest he barrels into him. “What makes you think,” Sherlock articulates every word with deadly precision, “I will stay in this pit of meaningless entertainment constructed for the feeble-minded masses a minute longer than necessary?”
Ellie shifts to face Sherlock, straightens her back and wipes a tear of mirth. “Well, let’s see what next summer has to offer on the Jurassic Coast, hey?” As their giggles die off, John brings out the tea tray, goes back to the kitchen to get a plate of biscuits, and returns to start serving tea. He passes a cup to Ellie and another to Sherlock with a soft squeeze on his forearm. Sherlock accepts the cup with a fond look at John and a soft ‘thank you’.
“I received a text message from John.” She picks up her mobile, thumbs the lock code and opens her messages. She turns the screen to both men. “See?”
“Er. Well.” he stammered but kept his cool. This was a bit of an odd reaction, but some clients were a bit shier than others; as long as he kept a professional tone, he could defuse any potential embarrassment. “This one here is ultra-soft, perfect for beginners, if this is the, um, case. Not too big, and very realistic. They come in a wide range of natural skin colours. Ah, this here is our best-seller in its category–”
“I will wear something more appropriate.” Sherlock flashes him another grin and, without another word, turns around and jogs up to his flat, leaving a bewildered John rooted in place and wondering what the hell he’s doing.
“Mycroft suggested it, Bill acquiesced, I…thought it interesting.” Sherlock tilts his head, pensive. “Someone knows we’re here and listened in on our conversation. The place is bugged.”
. It makes John think more of Ella Fitzgerald’s version than Frank Sinatra’s, velvet and vibrancy floating through the room. An enthralled audience watches and moves with the rhythm, eyes locked on the small stage. John can’t really look away either, and the lyrics wash over him. He wonders if Sherlock chose this song on purpose just to annoy him, and decides he’s being egotistical.
Button by button, clothes are shed, and reverent hands slide over naked skin. Teeth graze jaws and cheekbones, tongues taste sweat and salt and each other, heat builds between pressing torsos.
It’s been four days since the Watsons arrived and nothing is the same and everything is business as usual. John and Sherlock exist; days are planned around Rosie’s needs for activity in the mornings, naps in the afternoons, early dinners and bedtime routines. Sherlock is fine with this.
But she can’t avoid observing how John stoically avoids a flinch at the mention of Mary Morstan. It’s in the way he clenches and unclenches a fist, how he swallows dry and avoids looking at any of them. Not for the first time, Ellie thinks of the whole thing as an onion, layers upon layers. Some of them rotten.
That tone. That lost, uncertain, hesitant tone that leaves Sherlock’s lips, one that should not ever be uttered by this beautiful, larger-than-life, confident man, is what finally breaks John’s heart.
The meal is a veritable feast for the senses, but the food is the less important piece. Across from him sits John, happily tucking away in other offerings from the steaming baskets. He sends Sherlock the occasional smile, a beautiful thing that reaches his eyes.
Ten metres. That is all the distance that separates the Holmes brothers. It would be a short distance, one easy to cross, if it wasn’t for the fact that Sherlock is surrounded by four solid walls making up a solitary prison cell, while Mycroft paces a room as a free man.
“Hi, John! Hope I’m not intruding.” Ellie flashes him a sincere, toothy grin and steps in. John closes the door on the cold grey afternoon outside.
Mycroft understands that there is a point of no return for Sherlock and this is it. The point where Sherlock decides he will take his broken heart and disappear as a hero in the eyes of the one person he has ever loved, instead of fading away in a prison cell, locked with his own demons. It is not a sacrifice; it is liberation.
His voice trembles ever so slightly and his heart races as he speaks. “Come here for a few days. With Rosie. There’s lots of space for her to play. Short drive down to the beach.”
“He will not perform on that stage tonight. It’s too risky. This maniac could be out there. I can’t protect him here.” John crosses his arms and raises a defiant chin at Victor.
“Should we not follow the Land Rover and get the bastard?” Irene sounds annoyed as she also looks around, more alert than usual.
“Alright, and you call me John. I’m not practicing any longer, so. Ah, do you have a clean surface where I could place some of our samples?” John looked around him. The morgue was a large room, with standard stainless-steel counters along two walls, refrigerated drawers on a third wall, and a couple of stretchers, also in stainless-steel, standing in the middle of the room.
The attacker turned out to be the disgruntled father of one of the young recruits killed under Sholto’s last mission in Afghanistan. Usually, the weapons were verbal – bitter words, threatening letters, ranting blog posts from various family members and friends weighed down by anger and grief, wanting an outlet to place blame and seek closure. This, though – this had been the act of a desperate man. One who had nothing left to lose when all that he considered precious in life had already been lost in a pool of blood and gore in a country far, far away.
Sherlock pretends to be engrossed in his phone, scrolling through whichever news site he distractedly thumbs on. It gives him the ideal cover to sneak glances up to John, who is sitting in his chair, quietly reading the newspaper. Or rather, staring at a fixed point on a random page – not reading.
The fifth day dawns bright and promising, flows easily in an apology for yesterday’s dark moods. The trip to Brighton goes without hiccups: Rosie chases seagulls, they eat ice-cream while strolling the pier, and Sherlock and John walk side by side a few inches closer than usual. The salty sea breeze ruffles Sherlock’s curls; more than once, John tucks an errant curl behind an ear or away from Sherlock’s eyes, his own soft and filled with affection. Even if they often need to wade and squeeze through tourists, spirits are high. Hands brush, then tentatively hold each other. It finally feels the air is cleared, and that the conversation was had, even if not all words were said.
Before settling in, John decides to have a last check of the ground-floor. He’s done the kitchen and main door but not the living-room, and when he steps in, he finds Mycroft banking the fire.
“Yes, yes, I just,” Sherlock takes a deep breath, “I just wanted to thank you. I admit I was not expecting to have such a pleasant time in an amusement park, but. But I am enjoying this visit.” He wears a small smile, uncharacteristically hesitant. “I do feel some pain as usual but for a few hours I almost forgot it. It’s been such a constant presence that I’ve accepted it as something I must live with.”
Even Sherlock eyes John in disbelief as Ellie turns around to glare at him. John cringes, staring at the teapot as if it could save him. “Sorry, that’s… that wasn’t why we went to Broadchurch. I mean, it was, but not for the holiday part, I…” he clears his throat and chances a glance towards the living-room. Ellie feels a corner of her mouth betray her, tugging itself into a smile; chuckles rumble from Sherlock, and that seals it: they are now both laughing, a flummoxed John finally giving in and joining the collective laughter.
“What I mean is,” Sherlock clarifies, “we didn’t talk.” If he doesn’t say this now, it might never be said. “You appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the day, came to my house unannounced and uninvited to offer some generic apology—"
John vacillates at the doorstep but gives in and crosses the room, sitting down with as much dignity as he can muster. He takes a good look at Victor: the man is well-built, athletic, with sandy blond hair and sapphire blue eyes. ‘Handsome’ doesn’t even begin to describe him, and John can see what a striking pair these two would have made.
With a wince, Sherlock gets up from his chair and pads gingerly to the bathroom for the umpteenth time that day.
One particular poster catches his attention. It features a drawn picture of Mycroft sitting at a grand piano, body twisted as if to face the audience. The poster is in a tasteful, modernised art nouveau style – and there is no Sherlock in sight. Indeed, it features only Mycroft’s name, a date, and a venue John recognises as a small, exclusive club in London. An ad for a solo performance, then. Despite being a drawing, Mycroft is easily recognisable, a shy smile softening his usually severe features. The date on the poster is from almost a decade ago.
As they drive through Westminster, something catches John’s attention. A black Land Rover, not unlike the one he saw near Sherlock’s manor, switches lanes swiftly after Molly does the same; she learnt to do this at random times to check whether they’re being followed.
irritating to be so dependent on John’s care for now, he wouldn’t exchange these few stolen moments of closeness for anything in the world. He is slightly ashamed of himself for this, as he knows the feeling can never be reciprocated; but he cannot help it.
John gets up from his chair to sit next to him. To Sherlock’s surprise, he takes his hand and lifts it to kiss his knuckles.
Sitting at the kitchen island with a mug of steaming tea, John stiffens at the sound of his front door slamming open against the wall, but waits as he recognises Irene’s steps stalking her way and stopping right behind him just before he slides off his stool. He avoids her fist and sweeps a foot under her legs, making her fall flat on the floor with an ‘oof.’ But Irene is agile and enraged, so she is back on her feet before John can hold her down, and slaps him. John blocks a second slap with a ferocious grip on her right wrist, then on her left as she tries to hit him with her free hand. They have a stand-off for a few brief moments, eyes locked; Irene’s are burning in anger.
Irene huffs but doesn’t reply; Sherlock frowns, puzzled, but keeps quiet, and after exchanging a long look with John he returns to thumb at his mobile.
“Because the logistics looked like a nightmare. Not because of you.” John chances a look at Sherlock and is rewarded by a soft expression, eyes round and a genuine smile.
John sighs and thwacks down the newspaper he was trying to read on his side table. Sherlock had been sitting in his armchair for hours now in complete silence, hands steepled under his chin, eyes closed. John assumed he had retreated into his Mind Palace, as he usually does after a case, filing away little bits and bobs that may prove useful in the future.
Sherlock starts reading, an impatient skimming first, eyes delayed at a few keywords. He lingers on a particular sentence in the end. His breath hitches. He goes back to the start, reads slower.
“Shut up, both of you!” Sherlock shouts, “I need to think.” He jumps up and starts pacing the floor. “Mycroft fed him information thinking this was some pervert wanting some wanking material. Oh, don’t look at me like that, it’s obvious – the colour of my pants, really?” He rolls his eyes. “It is irrelevant, as such pseudo-stalkers are a dime a dozen, and if even Victor tosses off on that pretentious showroom bed, why would other people not do so in the privacy of their homes?”
Sherlock hears John’s steps up the stairs and gets up from his armchair – it sounds like John is carrying something heavy.
John jolts awake, right hand flying to his holster and finding his Sig. He does a double-take when he realises the voice calling his name was not a dream but rather a disconcertingly alert Sherlock standing in front of his armchair and shaking John’s shoulder.
Sherlock exhales an exhausted sigh, but gratefully receives a glass of water and two pills from John’s hands a minute later.
That’s lovely, but I really am very tired. How about I get something on the way home? We can go to Angelo’s some other day. My treat.
“I… yeah, no.” The thought of a young Mycroft sharing a teacup ride with an even younger Sherlock almost sends him into hysterics. “Alright, I’ll organise an outing for us, how does that sound?”
“It matters to me.” Something unfurls in John’s chest, something frightening and wonderful. He is tired, so tired of running in this Möbius strip where he always ends up where he started. Tired of trying to let this wonderful man go, of pushing him away.
Sherlock knows, however, he brought this on himself. Despite his best attempts at convincing the world around him that he is not an addict, he had fallen badly this time. Culverton Smith had been such a bad excuse to hide his real reasons to turn back to the lull of a certain seven percent solution.
The man looks perfectly ordinary. Sherlock had been peripherally aware that an extra bodyguard would show up today, had known he would have to do his usual routine of pointedly ignoring yet another new person (and oh, how he is against new people), excusing himself with the Work. He doesn’t need this baby-sitting, not really; yes, he’s aware there've been some sort of threats, but so what? He can defend himself perfectly well, and Irene keeps an eye on the crowds when he’s out and about, too distracted to notice potential dangers. What had happened to Ms Hooper’s hand had been, of course, unfortunate. Still, Sherlock thinks Greg is overreacting, culminating in this absurd decision to hire yet another bodyguard in the guise of a
“I can hear you thinking.” John’s sleepy mumbling against Sherlock’s chest startles him into hugging John closer. John looks up, bleary-eyed and soft. Are his eyes bluer this morning? “Hello there, gorgeous.”
Somehow, he cannot shake Sherlock off. Maybe the absolute filth John wrote him will put him off for good.
“Here,” John catches his attention. “Some ice for your neck.” Without really asking or waiting for permission, John lifts Sherlock’s chin with a light touch and presses the flannel-wrapped ice to his throat. Sherlock represses a flinch at the cool touch and relaxes, closing his eyes.
“Brother mine, I often say – and I do detest to repeat myself – that caring is not an advantage, that sentiment distorts reason and dulls the mind. But I find myself questioning this view these days.” Sherlock looks surprised at him, but Mycroft is not deterred. “Obviously, in your case, caring gave you the strength to endure two and a half years of misery. And caring will continue to provide you with that same strength. If I would give you one advice, it would be this: go forward; do not stray. Do not abandon that path you’ve been taking for so long now, because it is the path that makes you human.”
“Euclidian geometry as a metaphor? How positively ordinary, Mycroft.” Despite the snark, there is no bite in Sherlock’s reply. He’s looking at the table, suddenly interested in a stain that he keeps probing with a finger pad.
“To you, you berk,” John huffs with an eye-roll, trying for levity. But he is wary, waves of uncertainty wafting from his tense posture, that little pinched wrinkle on his forehead that tells Sherlock tales of unslept nights and worry-filled days. “For the thing. In the morgue. For the…” He gestures towards Sherlock’s head. “The beating.”
a study that links riding a rollercoaster with expelling stones a short time after but even the authors were cautious about their conclusions, with lots of caveats and an admittedly small population sample to work with.
“Sherlock,” John cocoons Sherlock’s hand between his two warm ones, “you are not unlovable. You are not unwanted. You have tried to convince me for far too long you are not who I want.” He shifts closer, so close Sherlock feels wafts of tea-scented exhales on his cheek. “I heard enough; this ends now.”
A cold, sunny morning finds John walking around the mansion. He’s been sleeping badly, the events of the evening at the Mayan running through his head like an old film. It’s been a few days. Sherlock has kept to his flat, and all but the essential staff are trickling out for the Christmas break. The mansion is eerily silent most of the time.
“You can set the table.” Sherlock grabs a handful of coarsely chopped basil leaves and throws them into the tomato sauce, giving it a good stir. He watches as the water for the pasta boils, uses this as an excuse to keep his back turned to John and his irritatingly familiar sounds of pulling cutlery out of a drawer, clinking plates on the wooden table, opening the fridge – probably to search for something to drink.
John takes a deep breath to calm his own nerves. It’s been a long night, and seeing this otherwise confident man broken and defeated is stirring something in his chest. He decides to help Sherlock out of his tattered outfit. First, he peels away the shiny top, which is eased by the fact that one shoulder had been completely ripped off. John tries to not delay the process by lingering on Sherlock’s firm, pale chest, on his well-defined pectorals; instead, he reaches for a set of blue silk pyjamas and dresses Sherlock’s torso with quick efficiency. The next part is more delicate, as Sherlock is wearing an unbelievably tight pair of shorts. There’s nothing for it: John crouches in front of Sherlock and places two soft hands on his knees.
This would be perfect for Sherlock’s purposes. He wanted to take the opportunity to show John around the village, introduce him to the (few) local shops, take him for fish and chips in the (only) pub. Maybe a walk later by the cliffs, toes burying in warm sand, the salty-scented sea breeze kissing their skin. A homemade dinner; perhaps he could convince John to do the thing with the peas. He would laugh fondly at Sherlock, and comply, and they would have a glass of crispy white wine with the meal and talk nonsense throughout the evening, watching the sunset—
Mycroft ignores Sherlock’s response, seeing it for what it is: a defence mechanism, a way to shield himself and avoid outwardly demonstrations of emotion. “I have two proposals to lay on the table, and you will take one of them. In fact, you have been graciously granted the privilege to choose what will become of you. I, of course, have a personal preference, but—”
“It wasn’t like she was a client and got killed under your protection, no?” Sherlock throws him a sarcastic look and takes a swig from his wine glass with a snort.
John turns and punches his pillow in frustration. Great friend he is, abandoning Sherlock to his sorrow. He sits up and forces himself to untangle the emotions that have balled up inside him, separate them into threads and identify them one by one.
“That’s quite alright, Dr Hooper. In my branch, we see a lot of interesting places. Also, the restricted access gives us some privacy, yeah?” John used his natural charm to make her at ease. He knew some prospective clients could get nervous about the nature of his products, and he had a natural talent to not come across as creepy.
Sherlock closes his eyes against the last rays of sunshine. He doesn’t expect John to contact him. Not after…
Sherlock pinches his eyes shut as a new set of spasms rocks him – John feels how his posture stiffens further. He gives Sherlock a friendly squeeze before releasing his wrist. “I’m going to get you more painkillers. Sit down on the bed.”
The kiss is tentative, a brief press of lips, undemanding and chaste. And, in John’s opinion, over too soon. He chases Sherlock’s mouth as Sherlock starts to draw back, and pours passion and desire into the kiss. Sherlock responds with equal enthusiasm, the initial hesitancy all but gone, the heat rising between them–
The same Sherlock sits before John, defeated, not by a kidney stone, but by ignorance and prejudice.

As she quickly cries these words at a very confused Sherlock, John comes out of Sherlock’s bedroom with a box in his hands. “Hello, Mrs Hudson; everything alright?”
They eye each other for a moment that stretches for an eternity. John’s pulse is loud in his own ears, drowns the clatter of forks on plates and the sizzle of food in woks, mutes the shrill voices of the restaurant guests next table, erases the muffled traffic noises that seep through the front door.
“It’s common to wake up thrashing about. It’s a known side effect of anaesthesia,” John comments, his voice nearer now. Sherlock knows this, but lets John reassure him anyway.
John blinks as if waking up from a dream and smiles sadly at him. “Yeah, no. Well…” He clears his throat, looking around the room, then again at Sherlock. He’s about to say something, Sherlock can sense it, but somehow the words don’t seem to come easily.
John wiggles on the sofa’s cushions, willing himself to break the silence with some innocuous subject. Instead, it is Sherlock who speaks first.
To his surprise, Sherlock does not continue on one of his tirades. Instead, he stares at John, mouth agape, with a look of bewildered surprise on his face. As if John had suddenly materialised in front of him, as if Sherlock wasn’t expecting to see him there at all. Before John can say or do anything else, Sherlock gets up from his armchair and swiftly climbs on his lap, straddling his thighs.
John doesn’t know either. Obviously, he can’t help with the second method but the first holds some appeal. Not that the second method isn’t appealing but… Anyway. “Just a thought, that’s all.”
Oh, he must have said that out loud because John chuckles, Mycroft rolls his eyes and Mary does a complicated thing with her face that Sherlock cannot really discern. Not in this state, at least.
that makes John stop. He takes a deep breath. Even if it has been years since they worked together, John remembers Greg as a stalwart and confident colleague. His tone now is anything but; John detects fear that does not belong to the Greg he knows.
They walk over the grass to Mycroft’s flat. Mycroft offers John a tight smile as he lets him in first, clicking the door shut softly after them. “John. Thank you for coming.” They stand in the hallway, the winter sunlight streaming in through French doors, casting sharp edges over them.
An uncharacteristically thick blanket of snow covers London and muffles the few sounds that seep through the windows of 221b, down to a dull white background noise.
Mary’s death sent everything to hell, himself included. There had been one letter already, delivered by Molly’s trembling hand. There had been a tumbling cascade of events since.
“Oh? And what then?” John is filled with sadness. So much to win, so much to lose. “Is this when we lay the cards on the table and find out we are playing different games?”
John hurries to jump in the car from the opposite side; he sits across from Sherlock, who glances at him with disinterest and out of the window as Molly starts the motor. Irene and Sally sit in the next row.
“What the hell?” he says, incredulous. He sees Sherlock paying attention to some detail on the windowsill.
He feels John’s gentle hand on his arm. “Hey, Sherlock? How’re you feeling? This is a lot to process.”
and Sherlock had nodded even knowing he would never set foot back in 221B, ever again. He’d felt bad for leaving her all by herself, despite her assurances on her having Mrs Taylor and Mr Chatterjee (they’re on friendly terms again despite that thing about him having
“The nurse said he woke up agitated from the surgery, but he’s asleep now.” Sherlock’s voice sounds distant in his own ears.
“Good evening, gentlemen, and gentlemen! The Mayan has a real treat for you tonight – please welcome the one and only…
Sherlock embraces him, gentle but firm, a hand cupping John’s head. Turning it gently so they face each other.
Ellie takes this as a good opportunity to say her final goodbyes, making the men promise a visit to Broadchurch for a less murder-filled holiday sometime. John steps out of the flat to accompany her downstairs; Ellie notices then the staircase to the upper floor. “Oh, a proper townhouse, is it? What’s up there?”
Sherlock’s mournful whimper stops John in his tracks, just-boiled kettle in one hand and two tea bags in the other. John had been preparing their evening tea while Sherlock browsed his phone for news, e-mails, posts on his blog and the like, searching for a new case or anything to learn for future ones.
Sherlock loses himself in the relentless rhythm, his breath shattering as the onset of an orgasm uncoils from within, and just when he feels he will let go completely, John slows down and stops. He is panting, dilated pupils competing with the indigo blue of his irises, a warm flush reddening his face and neck.
is acting today, and a false step makes her kick a kitchen chair, sending it skipping and clattering over the floor.
“Why did you never tell me?” John asks softly, so softly. He doesn’t want to scare Sherlock away from having this conversation. Because now, John needs to know more, so much more.
“Stop it!” John tears himself away from Sherlock’s manhandling. “It’s in London, why would I have it on me?”
“As you have undoubtedly deduced, Victor is my ex… My ex.” His cheeks redden slightly. “He is correct when he claims I was the one cutting all ties. I did it to allow him to thrive, instead of being stuck with someone like me.”
“Good evening, Mayan.” His sultry voice quietens the crowd down. “I thought I’d pop in to show you my latest video. Would you like that?”
“Next Monday.” Four days more. John frowns at this. There was no evidence of early stages of kidney damage, but surely this was classified as a subacute event?
“Well,” Sherlock swallows… nervously? John is now very alert, and his heart starts thrumming faster in his chest as Sherlock continues, “you make sure I am well-fed and rested, you protect me, even shot a man dead when you thought me in danger…” Sherlock trails off and continues to avoid John’s eyes, instead being suddenly very interested in some completely uninteresting point on the mantle.
Sherlock gives a small nod and lets himself enjoy John’s steady and warm proximity. He allows it when John tentatively reaches for his hand and holds it between his own, a solid presence tethering Sherlock to the here and now.
Moriarty grins, malignant and delighted. “You are so transparent, Johnny boy. If we all play our cards well, nobody dies here tonight.” He gets close to John, lips almost brushing over his ear. “I will burn the heart out of him. And you will help me,” he murmurs. Moriarty leans back, still grinning. “Oh, this is gonna be
No, this will not do. He does not wish to worry John with this childish feebleness – and an idea pops into his mind, a thought that had been in fact creeping in slowly over the past few days. “I just wanted to…”

“A couple of weeks ago…someone broke in and, uh,” Greg rubs the back of his neck, a red tinge of embarrassment on his cheekbones, “tossed off on the bed.”
The petulant tone makes John grin wider. It’s a good sign if Sherlock is more like himself instead of the pale, subdued version from the last weeks. John makes a half gesture suggesting they take the conversation back to the sitting-room, to which Sherlock acquiesces.
“At least let me show you something before you leave? Some of the things Sherlock’s been receiving.”
His eyes land on Sherlock, who is now mingling with the crowd after his performance. He’s chatting with a man John does not recognise but that hardly means anything – despite the presence of many familiar faces belonging to high-ranked politicians and socialites, there are at least as many who John has never seen before.
The man – Brook – has round brown eyes and laugh lines, dark slicked back hair, and is dressed in an impeccable suit.
before the more conscious part shakes such thoughts away. Sherlock seems confused at his own words. On the other hand, his face has gone through so many different grimaces in the last hour John can’t really read him any longer.
John opens his eyes slowly against the flickering light of a humming fluorescent lamp and sits up. As he regains sight, he finds two human-shaped shadows looming over him, one in some sort of ridiculous ninja-like outfit, and the other in an expensive-looking suit. Ninja-man is holding a gun level at John’s head and is impossible to recognize as he is wearing a balaclava.
Molly comes in the lab, carrying two mugs of steaming tea and trots up to Sherlock. “So? What d’you got?”
John is not having it. He knows he isn’t dealing with the situation well, but it is what it is and he can’t turn back the clock. “Christ, Sherlock! I’m trying to explain to you! I can’t protect you like this!” Stepping into his shoes, he turns to the door, his back to the bed, and takes a deep breath as he grips the door handle.
“Oh, uh, yes, yes, sorry dear, I was on my way out, never mind me. Was just going to do some dusting, thought you boys were out.” She feels herself fluster and stumble over words, but better not to lie – Sherlock will see right through her.
As if in a dream, Sherlock feels his hands wrapping around John’s shoulders and pulling their bodies closer. He bridges the small distance between them and presses his lips to John’s.
“Yesterday afternoon. Well, the day before, now,” Greg answers with a yawn. “Bit of a dweeb. Started crying when Irene gave him one of her signature glares,” he chuckles.
A lively and not easily rattled woman, Dr Afzal patiently explains to Sherlock that he seems to have a light UTI. It is not severe enough though to explain the level of pain, and so she refers him to St Mary’s for a CT scan. Sherlock bursts into John’s office after he’s done with Dr Afzal, demands John take the day off, and disappears in a huff when John stubbornly refuses.
They stare at each other, the air filled with unspoken things. The moment is there and gone as Mr Hardy returns.
Sherlock lifts his head from the phone and gazes at John with such a lost, frightened look that John all but throws the kettle and the tea bags onto the counter and strides into the living-room. Sherlock follows him with his eyes, and when John reaches his chair he can see Sherlock’s lower lip
Sherlock is not bored. He has a problem to turn in his head, that of what to do about John and Mary and the baby and the threats and Magnussen. His being shot had been shoved aside in his mind as an irrelevant detail by now — let bygones be bygones, and all that. Mary will not try to shoot him again, as it is not in her best interests.
Greg’s initial poise is slowly crumbling and John sees the genuine worry behind his words. “I still think you need to involve law enforcement here. Jesus, a booby-trapped
Sherlock and John give an account of the proceedings; as soon as they’re done, Molly throws a ‘I’ll get the car’ without even being prompted and runs off, Bill goes in the house with a ‘I’ll get my gun,’ and Mycroft blanches and freezes on the spot.
It had not been the first attempt on Major James Sholto’s life. But this one had rattled John to the core.
Mycroft looks sadly at his little brother. He who played pirates as a little boy; he who learned how to do deductions with Mycroft’s help; he who studied Chemistry and abused less innocent chemicals; he who made himself a reputation and a unique job title.
He’s so distracted by his internal musings he almost misses John getting up from the table and rinsing their mugs and plates. He disappears briefly into the bathroom, and when he’s out again, Sherlock takes in the dark bags under his eyes, a jacket folded over one arm, and car keys jingling in his left hand. “Well, I’m off, then. Thank you for the…” He makes a vague gesture that could mean ‘tea’, ‘stay’ or whatever, really.
Sherlock considers his next step. Should he reply immediately, thus reassuring John? Should he let him stew a bit longer waiting for Sherlock’s reply? He quickly decides against this; he’s not cruel.
“Yes, just fine, must be this weather, it does things to my hip, you know. More tea?” Greg’s cup is half-full still, but she’ll do anything to change subject.
Sherlock closes the door behind him and flicks the light switch. He releases a long exhale of relief as the warm glow from the uplight chandelier floods his flat. It’s a purge of accumulated tension and, to his surprise, of a layer of bewilderment that is clinging to his skin.
“Why!” John’s frustrated cry shakes Sherlock to his core. “Why should I forgive her! She saw me mourning your death, Sherlock! She knew what it would do to me to watch you bleed to death!
There is a feral glint in Sherlock’s eyes when he replies a very assertive ‘No’ and trots down the stairs.
It is just the two of them, sitting in their respective armchairs, enjoying the peace and a tumbler of expensive whisky. John has a forgotten book on his lap, and Sherlock has set aside his mobile. They focus on the here and the now, on the slow burn of the alcohol down their throats, on the spreading warmth from the fireplace and from within, on each other’s relaxed gazes, locked eyes scrutinising each other’s innermost thoughts.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and settles back on the armchair. Yes, there is a more immediate issue at hand, a practical one, something that is immediately fixable and devoid of sentiment. “The path is very likely flooded seven hundred metres from my doorstep, and for at least two hundred metres further down the road. Uneven terrain. It is improbable that it will become traversable until at least half a day after this rain stops. Your car is not capable of passing the flooded area; it will drown the motor.” He gets suddenly up from his seat – the additional height over John turns his confidence up a few notches. “There’s pasta with tomato and basil sauce for dinner in half an hour, the loo is at the end of the hallway, and you can have the sofa.” John is visibly stunned by Sherlock’s outburst, then is shaken out of his frozen state by Sherlock’s fast realisation of something else missing.
John wants, he wants so much, and he can’t help but to try push the door open. He grabs Sherlock’s hand ever so gently between his own and repeats, “It matters to me.”
One warm July evening, Sherlock throws himself on the sofa and plops the laptop on his knees. He tries not to think too much on that the first thing he does, the first thing he’s been doing now for a fortnight in the evenings, is to check his mail. Preemptively, he tries to not be disappointed by the absence of John’s contact.
“Oh, I see. You…want to go on a date. Discreetly. I do have to accompany you anyway, you must understand–”
The doors of the lift fling open and the first thing John registers is the absence of Irene Adler from her post.
Sherlock’s voice is small and he avoids looking John directly in the eye as they both stroll around the mansion. Good thing too – John is immediately uncomfortable with whatever might be following these words. Has Sherlock been acting soft and compliant to make John lower his defences and allow greater leeway in Sherlock’s movements? Nothing he hasn’t seen before in manipulative clients.
John dry-swallows. Warmth rises from underneath his own shirt collar; he’s started  sweating, perspiration pearling on his forehead.
Which is why the letter on the kitchen table now mocks him with a return address from John H. Watson.
“She climbed up to the roof,” he declares, standing to full height. “The weather has been mild enough to deposit a layer of dust and fine sand on the windowsill. Here and here, though,” he points to two different spots, “there are marks of shoes. Dust is eloquent.”
that hadn’t lasted long – they were on different units, and Mary had disappeared from the radar after a few…trysts. The word around was that she’d been invited to return to England after a series of unexplained deaths in her unit.
“Then what?!” Sherlock explodes, and John is taken aback with the rawness of his fury, so different from his usual sharp, controlled bouts of acerbity.
are the one who must be joking. How many more death threats must there be until you take your client’s safety seriously?”
And Sherlock isn’t blind either. He has noticed how Mycroft has been following John with more interest than a mere professional one. It’s only the fact he almost lost Mycroft to a bullet that stops him from letting the ugly blackness of jealousy take over completely.
There’s still a lot of activity in the studio, with dancers stretching tired muscles, people negotiating this and that on mobiles, and others doing god knows what, just hovering about and chatting, going in and out of the room. But the cacophony fades into white noise as John slips away from his constant hyper-aware state.
He is aware that he’s been silent for a beat too long, but John should be used to him getting lost in his head and not replying until he feels ready to do so. Only, Sherlock is anything but lost in his head right now. He is, instead, calculating a myriad of different variables to predict possible outcomes. There is something about the rain outside though that is distracting him, something…
Worst of all, he doesn’t understand why he can’t just say to hell with the job and walk out. Greg is an old acquaintance, but it’s not like John and Greg were close mates back in the day, and even less so now. He is a good professional and would understand if John backed away from the job. It’s not a sense of duty to Greg that keeps John here. Why is he staying, then? He glances at Molly’s bandaged hand, a consequence of the explosion that was meant to hurt Sherlock; images of the threatening letters materialise in his mind. Sherlock who, despite all the commotion, is willing to push through it all because the work is all that matters to him.
It should not irritate Sherlock this much when John enforces domesticity on their shared presence. The sharp-fanged, ugly darkness looms in the background though, and extends its tendrils slowly, slowly. The precession wobbles and wavers.
. For once, they had simply enjoyed a relaxing day in each other’s company. They had enjoyed each other’s company, simply put. Sherlock’s token objection at the whole endeavour had been quickly brushed aside and they just… had fun. Shared candy floss, stole food from each other’s plates, giggled after rides, strolled along the lakeside under the shade of blossoming trees…
Sherlock feels very tired all of a sudden, bone-weary and listless. He could swear he wouldn’t even have the energy to lift the now empty mug of tea from the mosaic-clad table. He watches as the colourful pattern acquires a golden hue from the sunset, rubs a finger on a stain. It doesn’t come off. It’s part of the pattern now, there forever until the table is no more. He lifts his hand to examine his nails and cuticles, dry and dirty and damaged from his daily chores.
