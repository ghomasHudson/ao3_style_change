“One! Thank you. Please, may it have some more?” John laughed loudly.
Now he had a slave who obeyed like no other before. Who was able to bring him to orgasm like an artist. And his slave was speaking several languages and had even studied. He could be of great assistance for his businesses, mainly the one with the government. And he knew the Detective Inspector from before. It was almost too good to be true.
“Nothing too bad. It's over.” He shrugged and moved out of his grip. Ian looked at Sherlock who sat only after John had pulled out a chair for him. And he kept staring down. He didn't touch the food or anything without being told to.
“Here you go. I hope you like it.” John smelled the fantastic whisky. He slowly sipped it and kept it in his mouth and on his tongue for several seconds.
“Read for yourself.” He held up the documents Greg had brought. John took them and read. Then he read them again.
“Yes, that’s a good idea.” Sherlock looked very pleased. Then he yawned.
Days and weeks passed in which John tightened his grip on Sherlock. More and more he ruled over him, his life, and his soul. And Sherlock was helpless. He did what John wanted. He was his dom and he had the right to do what he did.
Sherlock wondered though why his brother hadn't found out.
“Dr Kim will return in a few to have another look at you.” Mycroft said taking the last coffee and earning a glare from Greg. Sherlock saw it and at once stood.
Greg stupidly beamed at his mobile and typed a reply.
“Yes, except for that.” Sherlock just looked at him clearly not understanding what Greg meant.
“The Diogenes. My brother’s club. It has a basement, playrooms and subs if you can pay for them.”
He didn't have to wait long until John started to box him. Hard. Sherlock suppressed the noises as long as he could but then just had to groan into the fabric stuffed inside his mouth.
The only positive thing was that John hadn’t dated for quite some time. Instead, he had stayed at home. With Sherlock.
“Sherlock? What are you doing?” Sherlock came out of his bedroom carrying dress trousers and his pyjama.
Sherlock also felt rather attracted to him. He was a bit tanned and had a broad chest and muscular thighs. One night he had drugged his tea and examined him when he was unconscious on his bed. He had liked what he found under the blanket.
“I have but I didn't feel like cooking only for myself. This is so much easier.” He looked at the meal and shrugged.
“No! And isn’t that great?” Sherlock exclaimed.
“I wanted to make it better.” Sherlock suddenly said looking over John’s head. John had grabbed the black jumper and moved it over his arms feeling the fabric on his skin.
John had also started to reward Sherlock. If he behaved well enough, he baked cookies or cooked a fine dinner. If he misbehaved, John ignored him completely.
“Are you accusing me of killing that poor sod?” Sherlock nodded.
John approached him and hugged him. Sherlock sighed and clung to him for a while. No words were needed.
At last, they brought a cooler with both champagne and white wine. In addition, red wine was brought.
Finally, he would be close to John. But if his body kept behaving like this, he wouldn’t be able to enjoy it. Normally, he ruled over his body. It was just transport, wasn’t it?
Anyway, during breakfast, both men received texts from Sherlock and John. They looked at each other.
“How do you know?” John asked.
“Well, your business might include hiring me for your legwork.” Sherlock suggested.
John quickly renewed the connection and it was like a button had been pressed. His movements stopped at once.
Instead, he pulled John all the way up again and held him against his chest. His fingers came around the base of his prick and prevented him from orgasm. John almost cried in his arms.
“I thought about my bedroom. We were having sex in there anyway and it is the most comfortable room.”
A few minutes later Mycroft appeared. He padded into the kitchen following the noises Greg produced. He looked over his shoulder and his eyes roamed over Mycroft. The trackpants were too short and the t-shirt was too wide. It didn’t matter. He looked good. Great. Like a very different man.
“Please…” He rasped out the single word without any intention to do it. His lips stood partly open and he stared at John’s mouth.
“We can’t stay here forever. I have a job. I love 221B.” John said.
One day he was caught by John staring longingly out of the window when someone rode a horse over the lawn. He sneaked up close to him and suddenly grabbed his plush arse. Sherlock almost jumped on the spot.
When all of their minions had finally given up and puked all over the place, Sebastian took James home. He was high like a kite and Sebastian had to carry him along for almost the whole way.
“I will kill him myself. Pleased, now?” He almost hissed out the words leaning towards Greg.
“Yes, I am. It is for your, for our, safety. Please change, Sherlock. We don't know if there are any bugs in our clothes. Please?” He quietly begged his friend. Sherlock sighed and undressed. The new jeans were a bit too short and the shirt was very wide.
“I can see you like it. I am enjoying this, too. I really do.” Ian topped up their wine again.
He waited for a few hours but John didn’t come home. Sherlock donned his dressing gown, took his cigarettes, and walked up on the roof.
He gently placed him back and left the bed. He covered him with the blanket and dressed into the scrubs. He wasn’t able to sleep. He needed the tablet from his car. The nurse had also provided espadrilles for him and he left the building.
“I have never said the words because I never felt it. But now, after having analysed and listened to you, I believe I can. I love you, John. Very much.”
“This gets boring, slut. I need some more action.” He took the wrist cuffs off the humbler and then got the humbler, too. Sherlock groaned but didn't forget to thank him.
Ian decided to let Sherlock do as he liked but he smiled. Sherlock relaxed; it was obvious. And he reached out for him, held out his hand.
“No. Stay.” He trembled and tried to stay but he kept moving.
“Are you cold? Would you like the heating on?” Sherlock slowly looked up. His face was blotchy, snot had dried on his chin, and his eyes were still wet.
Sherlock returned with their bags and properly dressed. His hair was back and braided and he just stood there waiting. Ian looked at John and stood.
“We need more negotiating. My safeword will be
“I am fine in here. I am well taken care of. You can’t do anything here but you can do a lot with Greg.” Of course, Sherlock knew that.
“No, he is probably talking to Mycroft.” Sherlock sighed. “He won’t let him go for a while.” Sherlock was holding several plastic bags meant for evidence in his hands.
“Are you getting soft, Sherlock? You have just apologised and I appreciate it. We are good. I am here now and I will cope. Plus, it’s starting to become really interesting!” He broadly smiled and walked outside after having given back the magnifying glass.
“What?” John asked.
“Good morning!” Sherlock said looking over his shoulder.
Sherlock’s eyes roamed through the room. The computer and such were all the newest and most expensive. Sherlock envied this man. If he could have worked with these things, he wouldn’t have ended up using drugs. He would have been busy. He quietly snorted. If only his family would have given him more money. Now he was a slave, a pet, a thing, people could rent and use as a fuck-toy.
Finally, his hands were free and they shot up. Sherlock tried to peel off the tape with his ice-cold frozen hands. John’s hands clung to him and his legs were moving. Bubbles were already coming out of his mouth and Sherlock pushed up with all his strength left. They broke through the water and he held him tight.
„Let's go!“ He clapped his hands and grabbed the cool-bag. It left John with the rest and he picked them all up. He also checked the flat if everything was off and closed and also locked the door. When he arrived on the curb, Sherlock already sat on the passenger seat typing on his mobile. John threw everything into the trunk and saw that he had buckled the cool-bag on the back-seat. He sat behind the wheel and adjusted everything. Sherlock smirked.
. But I could also hear other movements from above but they were almost impossible to filter. The one who did this was very, very quiet. He must know his way around the premises because the moment the light came back on and we saw the body swinging, it was empty upstairs. No steps and no one was up there.” DCI Grant hummed thoughtfully.
“Be with me…” He whispered and it put a smile on Greg’s face. He knelt between his thighs and shoved them up. He reached for the lube that sat in his nightstand and lathered his fingers.
He felt it coming. He could sense Sherlock’s orgasm before his balls pulled up. He pressed down on his perineum and tightened the grip around his thighs.
John only sipped twice and Sherlock downed the rest of his drink.
“See you tomorrow at 7.”
During the next days, Sherlock became rather frustrated. John didn’t want him to see his cock but told him it was all good again.
“I surely noticed you kicking my boot and interrupting my conversation.” John emptied his glass and Sherlock at once topped it up.
“OK, thanks a lot, Dr Turner. Could you arrange the bed and a wash-bag for me and my friends, too?” He nodded.
At last, John had to pull back to breathe. He smiled.
He cleared his throat and looked over to his dom. Then he carefully approached him after having thought of removing the apron.
“I think he is ready. I don't know what he thinks though. I will need to ask.” Greg covered his hand.
“And I am extremely grateful for that. You are my friend, Lestrade. You always were and always will be. You saved my life.”
“Yes, John?” His eyes were focused on a point above John’s head.
“So?” Sherlock just held out his two bowls but John shook his head.
“Hush, love, it's all good now. Blow your nose and have your snack.” He handed him his napkin and Sherlock just took it. But he kept holding it in his hands doing nothing.
“John, listen to me. You need to stay with me in case these people call you. We can trace them. Always keep your mobile with you, do you understand?” Greg insisted.
“Show some discipline, Sherlock. We don’t want Mrs H to call the police, do we?” He asked.
“You deserve bedder …” He held up his finger and moved it through the air.
“I’ll make you pancakes for breakfast!” John exclaimed and kissed him hard on the mouth pressing his head against his own. Sherlock’s arms flailed around and when John abruptly let go, he fell forward.
He closed his eyes and tilted his head back against John’s good shoulder.
“There is no reason to be sorry for. Admittedly, I was surprised when waking up but very positively. It showed, deep down, you trust me. You came to me and it made me happy. I woke a happy man this morning.”
John closed his eyes for a second and closed the door. He turned around to find Sherlock coming closer.
“Master! Quick, please! I need your help! Please!” He called out. A few seconds later his dom dashed inside.
“I am so happy for you, Sherlock. It’s great news.” The same minute John came into the room wearing a pair of old and faded jeans combined with a ratty tee showing off his muscular body. His hair was still a bit wild. He stood beside Sherlock and looked at Greg holding out his hand.
“No, something to dress.” Sherlock looked at him.
Suddenly both of his hands came down on his head and clawed into his hair. John somehow knew what to expect. And he was right, Sherlock started to fuck his mouth. At first, very slowly to let him adjust but then he sped up. Tears were running down John’s face and mixed with spit and cum that kept dribbling over his lips. But he knew about discipline, so he managed not to cough or gag around Sherlock.
“I want them to do it this way. It's harder to fake.” Sherlock snorted and then tensed at once. He cast his eyes and felt the urge to fall down on his knees.
“That you are gay, of course!” Accusingly she pointed her finger at him. John’s eyes became large.
John grinned and looked again at his, their, tree. He was very pleased with it.
“You are leaving me behind already?” Sherlock pouted but at the same time slung his long arms around John’s broad frame.
“Dips.” Sherlock replied nodding.
“One time, I was in severe bondage and gagged. I cramped after a while and felt sick to the bones. I tried to signal him to stop but couldn’t use my fingers. Since I also couldn’t speak, he didn’t stop. He didn’t take my noises seriously and started to beat me. I almost choked on my own vomit. Only, when my eyes rolled back, he set me free. And he told me I was the guilty party for not having signalled properly. The second time was the same but with another man. I was with him at the time and found out too late that he was a real sadist. He didn’t accept my safeword every time I used it. I was needy back then and didn’t want him to leave. So I stayed and endured everything he did to me.” Sherlock wouldn’t look at John anymore. He feared that John would loathe him for being so weak.
“And then?”
“Don’t dream away.” His flat hand landed on the back of his head and he hunched and fell from there into a perfect kowtow.
“Hey, Sherlock. I wondered where you were. I also couldn’t find John.” Sherlock ushered him in and closed the door.
The first hit came out of the blue. Sherlock screamed after the third strong blow. His behind felt like being on fire. His skin was hot and burning. His behind was dark red.
“Oi!” He called out but grinned. After one last drink, Mycroft picked up his bag and left.
Slowly John lowered his head and stared down.
“Dr Watson, good evening.” He quickly moved over and offered his hand. John took it at once and hopefully looked up.
“Hush, love. I am fine. Just a big bump on my head. Please, don’t cry.” John said pulling at his arm. Sherlock let out a heart-wrenching sob but got closer. John placed his hand on his neck and moved his fingers through his hair. Sherlock buried his head between head and shoulder and cried into the bedding.
Carefully, Sherlock got off the bed and covered him with a blanket. He washed his hands and sat in an armchair. He didn't read but only watched his Master. John. And he forgot all about breakfast.
They locked eyes again.
“Where did they go?” Greg asked.
“Could you please not call me Johnny-boy, Jimmy? And where did you go to? What kept your interest?” John really wanted to know. He wanted Sherlock. Badly.
“He has scars, Greg. He has scars all over his back. Old and new. That's all I am going to tell you. You have to trust me.”
“So?” He finally asked. John cleared his throat.
“Don't fall asleep while I am making the bed.” Sherlock sat up straight.
„I want to use his behind now.“ Sherlock suddenly said.
“I really don't want to have look after both of you and Sherlock when we get to him.” Greg was very worried.
“So, let's go get surprised then.” He grinned and Sherlock very much liked this. John put their pots off the stove and saved their food. They left their flat and Sherlock hailed a cab.
“Show me.” He was pulled over to the sofa and Sherlock presented everything. John stared at the very fashionable and rather tight jeans and the beautiful shirts. Also, the boxers cost more than he would have paid for the jumper.
Sherlock stood in the guest-room Ian had given John and him. He didn't know what to do while John showered before bed. He had already unpacked their bags and now waited for his dom to return. To state his wishes. He assumed he wanted some sex before he left tomorrow.
“Very nicely deduced, John. So?” His voice sounded just a bit sarcastic.
“Sorry, mate…”
John showered for quite a long time and dressed in his sweatpants and tee. Barefoot he sat in his armchair and poured a drink. He started to think about the things that had happened.
Several days had passed and Mycroft had come back from Baskerville. He hadn't told anything to anyone yet and no one asked. Sherlock knew better and Greg did, too.
“You want dinner before you come into my bed? That’s acceptable. I can provide dinner right away?” Mycroft offered looking at him.
He knew how much in control of his body Sherlock normally was. Mind over matter and such. But this was extremely difficult to achieve. If he moved too much, he would hurt himself.
“Could you provide pyjamas and socks?” Ian quietly laughed and nodded. They walked into the bedroom and Ian handed him the things.
“Just do it. It won’t get any better. And I like to feel you. Properly, I mean. You won’t hurt me.” Mycroft ensured him.
He sighed and cleaned up their glasses and wiped once through the kitchen. He sorted his few things into a cupboard he found empty.
“I am sorry.” Sherlock said placing the napkin back on his lap.
“Call an ambulance. Get your brother to send a helicopter. Do something!” Greg suddenly yelled at him and Sherlock woke.
Greg grinned.
“Dinner?” Greg hopefully asked and Mycroft shrugged.
He scribbled his results into his notebook. Mycroft had given him several new ones and he filled it with his neat handwriting.
“Whatever makes you feel good, Sherlock. I'll get you a blanket and a pillow though, OK?” Sherlock nodded and stood by the sofa waiting for him. He placed everything down and had a bad feeling.
He decided to call Mycroft tomorrow and arrange a meeting. He needed to tell him about what happened to Sherlock and how to cope with his past.
“Thank you, Master.” John swallowed. He needed to establish the rules. And he did it right away.
“Let’s have a look.” They walked to the back and opened the door onto the terrace. They saw a bunch of police officers gathered, forensics was carefully moving over the lawn and some employees were watching. Amongst them was their host from yesterday evening.
“I am quite likable.” Greg grinned putting his feet into his boots.
Mycroft’s eyes fell on the fries Greg held. His fingers were oily already.
“So, Sherlock told you…” Lestrade said thoughtfully.
A while later, Mycroft texted his men and they went downstairs for breakfast. Greg chose a full English while Mycroft simply had a few tomatoes, cucumbers, and scrambled eggs.
“Yes, well.” Greg shook his head. Mycroft picked up his laptop.
Afterwards, he pushed him off.
Ian had thrown himself into his work. He had taken several clients himself. Clients who were special. Clients who especially needed rough treatment.
“Don’t.” He said but kept looking. John stopped moving. He felt the heat from his hand. It burnt on his skin. Strong fingers on his hips. Holding him. Holding him in place.
“Crime scenes.” John looked at him rather clueless.
“You don’t have to worry about the money anymore.” He blushed a bit.
Greg broadly smiled and stood.
“I am not my brother, Gregory.” He replied but after a second, he added something.
“You are simply fantastic, Mycroft…” He roughly whispered and cupped his face with a trembling hand. Mycroft blushed and cast his eyes.
“No, you don't have to clean up. You did so much already. Come on, get up and we will help you to bed.” Greg stood and took his arm. Sherlock stood again and swayed on the spot. Mycroft wondered if this was serious and if he needed Dr Kim.
The blindfold followed. Bleary eyes looked up at him and he was clearly dizzy and had zoned out. John removed the gag as well and pulled the mask off. He gently palmed his face.
In the meantime, he took Greg’s gun and undid the safety. He felt much better at once. He licked over his lips and stood motionless listening into the dark. The only thing he did was moving away from the window.
“What would you like?” John had seen the bar by the window.
“Well, I don't want her in my home again. I am coming over to yours. Wait there. I will call my security off but they will come in when I am present.”
“Yes, Sherlock?”
Sherlock even didn’t urge Greg to hurry. Instead, he calmly waited for him to finish. The moment though Greg pushed his plate back, he stood and pulled him along.
“There we are. I can't wait to properly look at your improved face, slut.” John still sounded pleased and Sherlock thought that was a good sign. He wasn't angry and if perhaps he behaved good enough, he would feed him soon.
“There you are. Now you may decide. Which gag do you want?” John held up a bit-gag and a ball-gag. Sherlock’s eyes shot from left to right and back and finally settled for the ball-gag. John saw his decision but wanted him to say it.
“I got shot at. You must have seen the scar.”
“Oh, my God! John, what have you done?” Ian stood and he was beyond angry. And he did another thing he hoped he would never have to do. He had it installed though for his own safety. Just in case. And he pressed the button to activate the drugs streaming out of the tiny holes in the wall by the bed.
“I have to go. See you in two days’ time.” Sherlock quickly stood and awkwardly hugged him. Greg walked him to the door.
“No, not at all.” John covered Sherlock’s hands over his heart and grinned back.
“You will make me proud again, won't you, pet?” Another question.
Sherlock made sure he didn't fall by always staying behind him, keeping him safe. He didn't dare to touch him though. On entering their living room John made a bee-line to the sofa but got stopped.
“Toybox?” His voice was pitched high.
“So?” Sherlock asked with a raised brow.
“So, Greg, John will be going to the pub with you.” John just closed his eyes and shook his head.
Now he tried to push Sherlock towards John. He needn’t push much though. It was John who needed to be pushed. Sherlock already knew what he wanted. He wanted John. But since John always stated how very not gay he was, Sherlock had to be creative.
“Are we expecting guests?” Sherlock asked looking at the different things John had prepared and laid out. It was obvious to him that two guests were coming over.
“I felt left behind.” John suddenly blurted out.
“It can’t ever be enough, John.” He turned his head and looked serious. John smiled.
“You will be angry with me, I am afraid.” Mycroft said. Greg raised a brow. Then he looked to the window and saw it was later than usual already. He looked back.
“As you wish.” He tore off the tape and dropped it on the ground. The Russian knew better and didn’t even beg for mercy. Sebastian started to slice through his skin. Blood splashed on the ground.
“Why did you call if you don’t talk to me?” Greg asked after almost half a minute of breathing. Mycroft cleared his throat.
“Now pet, come here and sit on this chair.” Sherlock instantly obeyed and John closed several pairs of medical restraints over his ankles, thighs, arms, waist, and chest. He was immobile except for his head but that changed, as well, when a metal contraption was pulled up and two stainless-steel plates held his head tight.
“You are the perfect slut, my personal cock-slut. But I haven't enjoyed you properly for a long time now. I think I have to up the ante a bit again. You have been pampered a lot during the last few days and I think a good reminder is due. Just know, you haven't done anything wrong. I simply want to remind you of what you are.”
“No, you fool! I would love to join you! It is just so unexpected, so kind…” He looked at him again and they were still hugging.
“You do everything for him, don't you? You crave his love or whatever he gives you.”
He pricked him, waited for a few minutes, and then felt his pulse again. It had slowed down already.
“But you like it?” John smiled up at him.
“I bet he didn't tell you what is going to happen here? Only that it would hurt?” He smirked and barked the order for the hypodermic needle. He was handed a stainless-steel tray. Sherlock could see all this because the seat was halfway up and both the doctor and his nurse were moving through his field of vision.
„It itches. You always say that's a good thing, so I am fine.“ Sherlock quietly replied. John smiled just a little bit.
Sherlock had told John about it. Well, he would make him watch them being tortured and he would take care of it himself. He had done so in the past with both Victor Trevor and Sebastian Wilkes. He would do it again. Sherlock needed to behave and he would make him.
He couldn't be with him, he just couldn't.
John grinned. He liked her. Finally, he sat down at the table and Greg followed him. Then he simply stated what he liked. Greg did the same and she wrote everything down.
He slowly sipped his whiskey while watching it all end. It was quick. They used poison on him and had him stripped down. He must have been drugged already because he didn't fight or even struggle.
They parted and John sighed picking up his work bag. Their eyes met and John finally left.
He slowly sipped his drink and leant back enjoying the taste. He slumped and tried to listen to what Sherlock said but somehow, he felt so tired and even dizzy.
He was utterly shocked because by now his prick was coming to life. He had just felt it twitch. He very carefully and slowly lowered the newspaper to cover his groin.
“Sure, what else would I...” Only now Dr Kim understood. He swallowed and emptied his cup.
Then John eyed a black jumper in a small and very posh shop. He tried not to look too interested but Sherlock had seen his eyes rest on it and pulled him inside at once. He put the bag down and pulled the jumper out. He held it up and eyed John.
“Gregory, I … I am not sure what is appropriate.” Greg looked at him.
On his way back he met Sherlock who walked over the aisle only clad in his sheet. Sebastian raised a brow. Sherlock looked hellish.
John had felt it grow more and more and now he could feel it twitch. Also, a remarkable amount of precum had oozed out of it. Mixed up with his saliva, he had swallowed it. He was curious how Sherlock tasted. He couldn’t even name the things he tasted. He could only think about how perfect everything was.
He stood. He actually was hungry now and wanted to see his brother.
“Now go ahead and text him. Afterwards, you can reward me.” Sherlock sat back in the car. Greg hesitantly pulled the mobile from his pocket and stared at the display. Then he stared at Sherlock.
John closed his eyes for a moment because he still was rather exhausted. Sherlock watched him through the rear mirror and looked worried. Greg reached out for him and placed his hand on his shoulder. Sherlock weakly smiled.
“If you touch the rings, I will hurt you more than you can imagine.” John threatened and once strongly pulled his hair.
“So beautiful…” John smiled and once walked around him. Sherlock closed his eyes. This felt so good. He couldn’t remember if he ever had felt this good while doing these things. Probably not.
He quietly sighed and went through his bathroom routine. He checked the time and decided to call Mycroft from his office at the hospital. He could perhaps meet him after work. But should he tell Sherlock? Why shouldn’t he? If he kept it a secret, Sherlock would be full of doubts again in case he found out. No, he needed to tell him.
He once moved around him and stopped in front of him. He shoved his left foot forward and Sherlock fell on hands and knees lowering his head. He slowly and languidly licked it clean. The right foot followed right after. He fell back into position when John flipped his fingers again.
Sherlock looked into his mirror and realised he was glad that Ian was with him, that he took care of him. And he did it without expecting payback. His eyes roamed over his image in the mirror and found he looked a bit better. But still he wasn't able to see what Ian obviously saw.
The moment it left the bath behind it walked faster. John didn't mind. He wanted to go to bed, too.
“I hope they are the way you like them.” He sat down again and ate another croissant, this time with honey. Sherlock devoured the eggs and licked his lips.
“Quite well actually.” He told her about his new room and the plans for his hair. She smiled.
His back hurt where his flesh touched the wooden cross behind him. His hair had been pulled up again to another hook behind him.
“But you will surely grant me a scene?” He asked and John nodded.
“Inflamed? Why? Where? Did you get in contact with something poisonous?” Sherlock asked coming closer and looking him over.
In the bath he found a new toothbrush, lotion, shampoo, and everything he would need. He just used the loo and brushed his teeth. In the kitchen he got a glass of water which he wanted to bring upstairs.
Sherlock wallowed inside the darkness and his helplessness. He wasn’t aroused per se but he felt amazingly well. He was relaxed and his thought processes that meandered through his brain were slow and not plentiful.
“Would you listen to me instead?”
“We should clean up, Gregory.” Mycroft wanted to move but Greg held him down.
“Oh …” He sipped some wine.
“I am not. I like it.” Greg smiled and the pout vanished.
In the meantime, John had a visit by James Moriarty in the hospital. He actually knocked and entered his office. John was fairly surprised to see him and stood walking around his desk. He expected Sebastian to follow but he wasn't there.
“Dinner will be ready in a few minutes. Where should I set up the table?” He quietly asked.
“No. And yes, I am worried after what happened here yesterday and last night.” Both men had their mobiles out to use it as a torch. Suddenly Sherlock stopped.
In the meantime, there was a fire burning and John wondered how he had done it so quickly. Now he was arranging John's food on plates and into bowls. This time he had ordered Indian.
Sherlock had rolled into a ball hidden completely under the duvet. His sobbing was getting louder and John closed the door. Sherlock needed to think this through and he needed to find a conclusion all by himself. In the meantime, John would cook something nice to feed not only his body but also his soul.
“I exaggerated again. I understand why you must be so tired. It was all a bit too much in these few days.”
“It’s not your fault, John. I needed this. It was a calculated risk.” He moved back close to him and took his hand.
John again was ready and freed his cock. He stepped up close and Sherlock eagerly started to lick the head and suck it inside.
“This is so Sherlock. You did nothing wrong, Ian. You have witnessed the beginning of an epic temper tantrum.”
“Do you know who was behind it?” Slowly he nodded.
“Since this is your home, you should do just so.” Mycroft said and Greg wondered if he still liked the idea of living with him when he saw what Greg would bring into the mix.
“Sounds good. What about dinner now? It’s late already and you didn’t look like you had anything today.” Mycroft mumbled a reply and snatched the tablet back.
“This is insane. Africa? What are we supposed to do there? I just have to go back and try to convince Mycroft not to kill you.” Greg looked at him.
“You need to recover and therefore rest, Sherlock. Please, be responsible.” Sherlock pulled his hand back.
“Do it.” The soldier handed a torch over to Greg who gave him the much-needed light. He put on special glasses and Mycroft shielded his brother’s face. Sherlock closed his eyes and buried his head against his leg.
“Not yet anyway!” The brothers stared at each other but Sherlock finally told his big brother what had happened. Starting from the corpse in the morgue, Lestrade leaving him behind and the things John had done to him. While talking both men had been leaning towards each other in the armchairs. Mycroft cleared his throat.
He saw his muscles tense but he relaxed soon enough. He also made a surprised sound and his cock had twitched, too.
He had nightmares about his balls and cock being roasted inside the metal cage and over-long nipples for the rest of his life. He started to cry again.
“Let’s check out that place. I’ll send part of my team right away, so they can have a closer look. Until they text me back, we could go back upstairs and talk about tonight?” Mycroft suggested.
“Us two?” John asked.
“We should try to find DCI Barnes. He might be outside.” John suggested.
“I checked your browser history. I never would have thought, John.”
Then he started to hit his fists onto the headrest making it crack. Sherlock was rather impressed by his strength and fucked only harder. He also stroked and pumped his penis making him keen and groan again. His other hand teased his nipples, pulled, and tweaked them. When he felt John clench around him again and his testicles pulled up for the second time, he came again and so did John who just collapsed on the bed. He wasn’t able to hold himself up anymore.
He wanted to lift both arms but couldn't. Finally, he used one hand to rub over his pale face.
“I trust you, Anthea. Both with my life and with Sherlock's. I will arrange a non-limit card for you. Go and register at once.” He sounded excited and alert.
“Help me come down then.”
“Sorry, that place is already taken!” Greg sighed and shook his head. Then he just grabbed his coat and they left together.
“What are you going to do tomorrow? Or today?” John asked looking out of the window where the sun just showed over the horizon.
“Your CCTV? Please!”
Sherlock walked over the path and between the trees closely followed by Lestrade.
“John! You are home early. What happened?” He asked wide-eyed.
They reached a large manor in the countryside. It stood alone and was surrounded by a large park. There were heavily armed guards everywhere.
“You don't mention more pain dished out by a riding-crop or an electric prod. Does it mean you don't want to experience to the fullest?” Only then Mycroft locked eyes with him and was for once brutally honest.
„You know you can't use a condom.“ John looked at him.
His mobile dinged again and he checked it. There was another e-mail.
“Perhaps you could borrow some clothes from the local police or the hotel? And didn’t want Mycroft send clothes?” John suggested and asked the question.
“I am very happy to hear that. You will always have a home here.” They smiled at each other and even though Sherlock's smile was rather tired it was good to see it.
“I wondered about dinner.” Her eyes widened.
“Have I changed?” Mycroft asked but smiled. Sherlock stepped up.
“I declare this session open. Get up and undress. Place your clothes neatly on the small table over there. Come back to me and fold your hands on your nape.” Mycroft stood and swallowed. He slowly walked over to the table and started to undress. He folded his pullover followed by his t-shirt. He toed off his shoes and socks and they went under the table with his socks inside his shoes. He opened his belt and climbed out of his jeans.
Mycroft took his arm and led him over to the bed.
“What?“ Greg asked.
“I had no idea.” Sherlock sadly smiled.
“Even though they arrested your suspect?”
“You will wash up and disinfect right now and I will have a closer look. Go!”
Mycroft happily took his hand and moved up close.
Once and again he slapped him somewhere or poked on his clamped nipples. Sherlock was convinced that if John wasn’t gagged, he would scream the place down.
He tried to speak. He wanted to drink. He was thirsty and his throat was raw. He rasped out a word and his fingers twitched.
He snapped to attention when he saw Sherlock standing in the middle of the room. They stared at each other and none of them spoke.
“Gregory!” Mycroft got to his legs and yelled his name. Sherlock twitched curled up in his chair. By now he had managed to pull up his legs and placed his head between his thin thighs.
“Sherlock, shut your stupid mouth! You were perfect! It was the best thing ever happening to me and I have said so, haven’t I? Only because I am changing the routine, my routine, doesn’t mean this is over. If you want it to be over, you have to tell me. But I don’t think you want to stop, do you?” He asked.
“What do you need?” Mycroft asked and Greg looked back at him.
And Sherlock hated being ignored. He needed the audience and his most wanted audience was John.
“Not at all.” He bit his lip.
“Yes, Greg.” They looked at each other for a few seconds and Greg knew he had to simply leave the room to get Sherlock going. He disappeared into the bath and left Sherlock behind.
“Don't know ...” His breathing pattern wasn't right, his heart was beating in an unsteady rhythm. Mycroft picked him up and carried him over to the bed. He undressed him and covered him with the blanket. Then he got his mobile and called his brother.
“Whenever you need me, I will be here for you. Whatever you need, I will provide it.” The words slowly sipped into Sherlock's brain and he stopped sobbing.
“Let’s get back then, shall we? I am thinking about a relaxing bubble bath.” Greg happily nodded and carefully turned his horse around. Mycroft stayed by his side but Greg just shook his head.
Sometime later he all but swayed into the bath and had a shower. Then he dressed in a pair of jeans and a jumper. He put his shoes on and donned his jacket. In a blur, Sherlock blocked the exit.
“This is from your
“Shut up, Sherlock!” John said and shot him a look. Sherlock pouted.
“Yes?” The door was opened and Irene Adler came inside. She quickly walked over to him and closely looked. He let her scrutiny wash over him.
He listened but no one else approached. Quickly, he poured the water from the bar over Greg’s face and it helped a bit. He stirred a little and blinked. Sherlock kept using his mobile as a torch and gently nudged Greg into the side using his foot.
“And that means, young man, it will go away again soon again because only you can keep him busy and make him forget.” She boxed his arm and the smile on Sherlock’s face was back up.
“He never was interested enough in somebody. His body is just transport.” John laughed.
“You have seen the last time he texted me. Us. He needs to sleep.” John said.
John shed his jacket on the way and stepped out of his shoes. He heard Greg call out behind him and simply dropped his not very legal gun on top of his bunch of clothes. Then he jumped headfirst into the dirty and cold depth.
“Thank you so much.” They all downed their drinks and the mood became better. Sherlock's plate was empty soon and he sat back with his hands folded on his lap. Mycroft knew he had to do something about it and calculated the number of calories and the time in the gym. Suddenly he caught Gregory's eyes and simply stopped doing it.
He left the tent and John simply followed. It was the usual thing to do.
“Down there, too.” Sherlock used the oil on his prick and stroked him slowly.
“You could do it on the beach?”
“Stupid man…” John muttered and stored his med-kit away. On his way back, his mobile dinged.
“No, I don’t mind. Stay, please.” He said and John stayed. He wondered if they would glue together if he stayed too long.
“I can’t deny you anything…” John said with a smile and handed over the bag. Sherlock beamed at him.
“Don’t be ridiculous!” He almost looked shocked.
Sherlock blew his hair off his face and raised a brow.
Sherlock read it while stroking John’s penis. Now he clenched his fingers around it making John twist in his restraints and shout. He uncurled his fingers murmuring a
“This all sounds very good to me, Sherlock. MP Bradley always behaved like a shadowy subject.”
“Sit, John. We need to talk about what happened.” Greg said and John sat.
“Sherlock told me you had an office at
“You are not allowed to come, John. Hold it. Keep it.” John groaned.
“Everything. I felt his pain. His skin was burnt where you would tie someone up. His wrists and his mouth. His backside is sore. He has been raped.” John looked at Mycroft and shook his head.
“Fuck, Sherlock!” He just grinned and disappeared into the bathroom. John collected the dishes and stored them into the dishwasher. He didn’t follow him because he knew what would happen then. He just waited for him to come out again.
After a while Sherlock returned with still damp hair. He hadn't used a brush and it looked wild. Ian swallowed and quickly looked away. He had also chosen a pair of jeans with upturned hems and a long-sleeved t-shirt. He had also taken socks, two pairs, because he had found no slippers.
“Listen to me, Sherlock. John Watson is gone. You will never see him again. You are a free man from now on.” Sherlock's eyes widened in shock and his free hand took hold of the silver chain around his neck.
“We can't help him. We have no weapons. We don't know where they are taking him. We have to keep our heads down.” John whispered back and Sherlock pressed his face into the earth. He cried.
He chose a bottle from his purchase and straddled him again. Now he sat half on his arse and rubbed the oil into his back. John further relaxed. It smelled wonderful and felt a bit tingly on his skin.
“I never saw him eat sweets…” John quietly said.
“You have to understand though that what you did was overstepping my boundaries. You invaded my privacy and my home. You can’t do that without talking to me.” Greg calmly said.
“You haven't listened to anything I have said to you yesterday, am I correct?” John asked. Sherlock didn't reply. Again, he was extremely confused. John was altering the facts and it made him dizzy.
The moment Ian took it made it all better. Sherlock's eyes watered and he wiped over them with his free hand.
“This should make you pliable, slut. You may call me
“Are you up for some work tonight or are you too tired?” Sherlock shook his head.
They found their way back into the kitchen and now there was a police officer in front of the door. Lestrade opened it and they walked into the freezing cold.
“Yes, I do. I won’t. I promise.” He almost stuttered.
“Myc won't let you in.”
“See, Anderson, what I have been talking about?” Sherlock’s face changed colours from red to white and back. But he wasn’t able to get up. Instead, John stood in front of him and shielded him.
“Don't you worry, I'll take care of everything. You won't even notice being taken.” Mycroft looked smug.
“I am trying to reach subspace. I never made it there. Mycroft and I have only ever heard about it. Perhaps, it is even a myth.” John quietly laughed.
“Two hours and not a second longer. Have no fun so far.” John grinned and left. He walked the few minutes to the pub and entered the dimmed room. He stepped up to the bar where he could already see Greg ordering two pints of lager.
“No!” And Sherlock snatched one of his wrists and pulled his arm on his back. John completely stilled.
“Why?”
“You probably could, you know? You said so yourself, at least part-time?”
“Please, Master, I need you to touch my prostate again, please, please?” Sherlock pressed down on it. Now John yelled. He was very sensitive by now, and his bound prick didn’t make it any better. Sherlock fucked him some more and pressed his own cock against his bare back searching for the friction, too.
“You are a vampire.” He only whispered this.
“I think we could call ourselves a coven by now, right?” Mycroft tilted his head.
“I am sorry if your concert was spoiled. I was selfish because I wanted you here because I needed you.” He said. It made Greg smile.
Sherlock held John’s cock to stop him from coming early but who stopped him?
“Very well. Get up and stand over there.” Sherlock jumped out of bed and stood in the middle of the bedroom. John followed and shook out the harness. He held it to his body and here and there he adjusted some straps.
Mycroft finished his blood and set the mug on the table. Then he stood.
John pressed him on the sofa and bit into his jaw. He moved his palm over his chest and beneath the dress. He also rubbed over his groin. Then he huskily whispered:
John had listened to Greg and was shocked. Sherlock had been kidnapped. He also knew that this case had been about human trafficking and he paled thinking about the consequences.
“OK, listen to me. You will go and take a shower. You are disgustingly smelly. Go into a guest-room. I will take care of good old Johnny-boy.”
“Yes.” They walked downstairs and Sherlock sat behind the wheel of a fancy SUV.
“Ow!” Sherlock exclaimed and John held up a finger. Sherlock clamped his mouth shut.
Sherlock listened and heard John laugh. Then the woman laughed, too. Sherlock’s lips were pressed together and only for a second, he thought about just leaving again.
Ian prepared tea and scones in the afternoon and settled in the library. He left the door open so Sherlock could find him.
He moaned and fell. Sherlock caught him and took both blindfold and gag off. His eyes were closed but his head lolled over the pillow.
“Greg, I am sorry. I didn't see you.”
“Aren’t you coming?” He asked wondering if he had done anything wrong.
Upstairs, John had taken his time to get ready for dinner. He took yet another bath, which he quite enjoyed. He knew Sherlock wanted to talk to his brother. He also knew he would use the opportunity to smoke. It was all fine. He needed his freedom to do such things. John loved him anyway.
But in a good way.
“This whole thing is getting absolutely strange. I really don’t understand any of it.” Greg thoughtfully said.
“Why not? What could happen?” Greg asked. The doctor slowly exhaled.
“Isn't it a bit late?” John smiled a nice smile and stepped up.
John had left his shaggy place early not to be late. He was excited to meet this guy Sherlock again. They had been introduced by his former friend Mike from university at Bart’s hospital earlier today because both of them were looking for a flat-share. He had seemed a bit odd but somehow John didn’t care. He had liked him instantly and he also was a very interesting, charming, and beautiful man.
“Sure. I heard him limp through the flat but everything seems to be OK. It's just as it was at the beginning with you two, isn't it?” Sherlock sadly smiled.
“You should go home and enjoy each other's presence.”
“Dr Turner offered us guest-rooms. But we could also look for a hotel if you want?” Sherlock shook his head.
“I want to help. I really want to help. But before, I couldn't manage. I simply couldn't. I have been weak and I hated myself while hiding. I had read the report from my team who searched Baker Street. I didn't understand what half of it meant, what all the things were for.” He slowly shook his head.
John let him wait for a bit until he used the loo and entered the bedroom. His own private brothel. He already was hard and erect when he stood in front of his submissive.
He was getting hard and aroused very quickly and he moved his huge cock several times deep into Sherlock’s mouth without actually fucking it.
“Five minutes, Lestrade.” Sherlock hissed and turned around. Greg looked at John but he was half-naked, too. He swallowed and just turned around.
“I know, I know. But I also never had wild sex while being on a case!” Sherlock disappeared into the bath and left a smiling John behind.
“What are you thinking of?” John was curious.
“Do not anger Greg, Sherlock.” John chided him while disinfecting his palm. Sherlock hissed in pain.
“Who else is going to join us?” He asked and Greg quietly laughed.
Sherlock donned his coat and took both his wallet and mobile. Outside, he hailed a cab and rode over to Scotland Yard. He actually wondered why there wasn’t any message from his brother who normally was very curious and also concerned about him.
“Unfortunately, no. Tomorrow is my first appointment at the hospital. I need to stay a few hours after my laser treatment. They will get rid of my scars. It will need several treatments but they said my skin would be as good as new.”
John didn’t mind him acting. The important thing was to not cause a riot.
“I will do it. Please, sit down, Greg. You have done so much for me already.” Greg looked at him for about a few seconds and finally nodded.
“Looking good, love…” John said with a smile. Sherlock just looked at him out of hooded eyes.
“No, there are people for that. Come along, John.” He wanted to pull him away but John was stubborn.
“I should call my driver now.” Mycroft placed his glass on the table and stood straightening his suit.
John loosened the cuffs and took off the fabric over his eyes. Sherlock blearily blinked and a stupid smile was on his face.
“Don’t worry, Mycroft. We are good here.” John said.
“There you go, my little slut. Why don't you try and fuck back?” Mycroft stopped pushing and waited for Greg to act. He just needed a few seconds to adjust and then started to fuck back. He was being pulled all the way up and pressed against Mycroft who used his free hand to tease his nipples.
“I should hope so, Captain Watson!” Sherlock smiled. Suddenly he looked up and behind John.
“Well, as far as I know, he is very interested in you. He won't harm you. He probably is as scared of the whole situation as you are, Greg. Just offer him some blood, that will calm him down.”
“Sherlock?” John said and nudged him but Sherlock didn't react.
They heard footsteps and a door being opened and closed again. They quickly disappeared from the aisle and were gone when John Watson left the room. He walked towards the stairs and Mycroft lifted his rifle. He exhaled and pulled the trigger. There was no question about it. He hit him right in the middle and the bullet's force pushed him forward and down the stairs.
“You know, he says the same about you.”
Sherlock really looked forward to it. He probably would have to tell John how he liked it in bed, namely rough, and that John couldn’t be afraid of hurting him. John probably needed to talk about it but Sherlock planned to just snog him senseless and tear his jumper off of him.
“I want to see John.” The same second Molly entered the room.
John sighed and pressed his hand.
“I have everything else already, Lestrade. So?” Sherlock asked and Greg just shrugged and started the car. He rode back to Scotland Yard.
“So was I. And I am sorry for this messy place.” Sherlock moved closer on his knees and John leant forward.
“There is a second bedroom upstairs if you be needing two.” Then she looked over the place and then at Sherlock.
“I don’t. I never have.” John shrugged.
“It might be for you. It is not for me. I insist on a separate room or I will find myself another place to crash in.”
On one of their first nights out they were running after a suspect who fled the crime scene, Sherlock naturally was faster than John. But he got closer and reached him when he had been pushed down on the concrete. Sherlock only saw a flying shadow with an outstretched leg. The next thing he saw was their suspect groaning and holding his side on the aforementioned concrete. He slowly sat up and looked at John.
“Greg?” He tried again and earned a light grumble.
“You did a splendid job so far but your act isn’t needed anymore since we are having a real corpse. Get up and go away!” With a quick turn of his wrist, he gestured for him to leave.
“Witness reports of his death. It was in the papers. He died in a restaurant and several people witnessed his sudden death. Also, look at his eyes.” John carefully pulled open the lid. His eyes were blood-shed and he hummed.
John sort of liked that. Power games were very much his favourite games. He believed though that Sherlock had no idea of what was going on. He wondered how far he could go with him.
“Why?”
“Had worse…” It was everything Sherlock said and he just slept on. John sighed and lifted him up. Normally, Sherlock would protest instantly because he didn’t like to be touched.
Sherlock looked forward to it and relaxed again.
“Don't be angry with him, please? He loves you very much.” Sherlock looked at him.
Sherlock had lowered his head over the body. His left hand was on the stomach and his right held a scalpel ready to cut through the skin. Gently John laid his hand on his right.
“I am sorry, Mistress. Thank you, Mistress.” She really did clean his face and it felt wonderful. She massaged his temple with her fingers and it felt divine.
Meanwhile, Sherlock had moved into Ian's workplace. He occupied his rooms there and was introduced as the new manager. Everyone simply accepted this and asked no question.
Sherlock smirked.
“Why didn't you call me? I could have helped...” Sherlock said not knowing what he could have done actually.
Sherlock dared to look up at him but then he licked his lips.
“Excuse me?” John raised a brow and Sherlock realised he had said something
“Come down, please. I am here because I love you. Yes, you treated me like shit and I didn't like it. But I still love you, nothing changes that. Nothing, do you hear me? You will come home with me and we will talk. I have to feed you up. I will take care of you. But only if you want me to.” Sherlock had listened and couldn't believe what he had heard.
And to remind Sherlock of his place, he had collared him again. It was a soft collar though that didn't restrict his breathing. But it was there, he could feel it.
And Sherlock wanted it to work. He loved John. He wanted John. He already missed John.
“Very much so, Captain.” Sherlock answered.
“For me. Exactly. Please do so.” Mycroft said and Greg stood leaving the table. Sherlock looked at his brother.
“He is a wonderful man.” Greg smiled dreamily.
“She always hurts me by calling me names. Why? It’s mean.” John carded through his hair.
“Greg said you allow me to stay here with you. I would like that.” Sherlock quietly said.
“What they did to him wasn’t right either. So what? If I could have done so I would have skinned them alive after …” He swallowed and stopped talking.
“I can do something about it?” Dr Kim smiled.
“Are you really feeling better? Do you need anything? Will you be eating something?” He asked.
“OK.” Silence.
“Look at me!” Slowly Sherlock opened his eyes and there was real pain in them. John raised a brow.
John gaped at Sherlock. He had granted him one wish, hadn’t he? He swallowed. He had never bottomed. He licked his lips and looked into Sherlock’s eyes.
His suckles slowed and his breathing calmed. At first, he didn’t even notice the soft pulses coming from the plug. They left him with constant arousal and small waves of pleasure.
“May I ask if...” Then he stopped again and shook his head. John looked up again.
“No, not at all.”
“I dare anyone to approach me.” Sherlock said seriously. Greg knew what he was capable of and hurried to fetch the keys.
“God, I am so sorry. You must think me bloody boring.” He shook his head.
John found everything he needed in the first pharmacy. These people knew him and didn’t ask questions. He hurried back home. His leg hurt and his hand shook. He swore quietly climbing upstairs. He opened the door and found him asleep in the armchair. He was quietly snoring and drooling on the blanket. John almost cried when seeing him like this.
“Ian told me to cook a vegetable soup for you. I will do that now. Please, do not get up. Just please? I will leave the door open, so I can hear you if you call me.” Now John turned his head.
Perhaps he should leave the country and open a club himself? He had enough money; he had earned it. Well, actually Sherlock had earned it for him but who cared? There also was Sherlock's money he had full access to.
“Please, let me. I am a doctor.” Jonathan moved to the side taking care of Mycroft now who was paler than ever. John felt Greg's pulse. It was hammering fast. He was pale, clammy, and cold. He saw the fading bite-marks on his neck and wondered if this was an allergic reaction. He had something for it in his bag. Well, for normal allergies like bee-stings, medicine or whatnot. But vampire saliva? He just had to try.
“Apology, DI Lestrade.” Mycroft said and made a careful step back. Sherlock looked between them.
“What else would help?” John asked. Sherlock tilted his head. Then he smirked. The expression on his face made John swallow.
“Yes, I do, Gregory.” Mycroft gave him a smile and Greg relaxed.
He checked the time and informed security about him leaving. They were trustworthy, very much so. Even though, he wanted to drive himself. They would follow in another car and wait outside. There had been a discussion about him going alone into her place but he made himself abundantly clear.
“You are kidding me!” But John shook his head.
“I surely could need him back on my crime-scenes.” Greg said and his smile was quite a bit lopsided.
Finally, Mycroft’s orgasm tore through him and the contractions around his cock did it for Greg. He threw his head back, pushed for the last time really hard, and came into Mycroft.
“Get up and out of the bed. Crawl into the living room and stay on the rug in front of the fire-place.” John ordered and Sherlock simply obeyed. He hurt so much and the heavy dildo still sat in his behind. He feared it would stay there for a long time.
They reached a torture chamber and he threw him on a wooden table. He loosened the bonds around his legs first only to shackle them to the table. The same happened to his bound wrists. These went over his head. He turned a wheel until Sherlock's body was completely stretched and his bones cracked. A metal device was screwed to his head so he couldn't move it. Only then he took the bit-gag off. Sherlock moved his jaw and it cracked.
John kept pressing and his finger disappeared inside Sherlock's hole. He quickly looked up and saw his eyes widen but he didn’t seem to be in pain. He kept going and looked for his prostate. And since he was a doctor, he found it very quickly. He rubbed over it and pressed down until Sherlock shouted and kicked his legs.
“He is a friend. He saved my life, Myc. Don’t destroy him.”
“I am not going to invade your brain unless it's absolutely necessary.” Sherlock just nodded. And then Toby returned with a cool-pack.
“Yes, let's.” He showed Ian the bedroom and bath and got a blanket for the sofa. Both men used the bath and parted for the night.
“Yes, it is. You know, I like him. He is a fighter and I hated to have to hurt him. But Jim can be very convincing. And I need him.”
“Yes, Sir ...” Sherlock whimpered and his body shook when John let go.
“Come on, the water is getting cold. I’ll give you a massage after you have eaten a bit. I made something for you. Please eat it.”
“Me neither. Anyway, here is my card. Come along tomorrow if you like?” John took it between his fingers and turned it several times.
“I wasn’t yet done, pet.” Sherlock lowered his head.
“Don't mention it. Please, I need your credit card for the refund.” But she shook her head.
“No, Gregory. Not tonight. Tomorrow morning.” He held his hand.
“Can't...” His head was turned away and his eyes were closed. Well, Sherlock remembered for sure how he had been forced to urinate. Mostly into his clothes or on other slaves for the joy of others who were watching. He pressed on John's bladder and made him piss into the bottle.
Ian got a first-aid kit and tended to Sherlock. Luckily, he didn't wake. But Ian's anger had grown over the minutes. He had to find out about the clean-up. He still had connections from his past and he would contact them.
John approached him after having done some tedious chores. Sherlock watched him. They stood close together.
“I see. I wonder if I could reach that place…” He slowly shook his head.
“How is he doing?” Sherlock suddenly asked.
“The price for it is acceptable. Please prepare him as I have stated before.”
He sighed. He would have to join the masses of Christmas shoppers and he pulled a face. But he would do it for John. He wanted to make him happy. He couldn’t make his sister stop drinking or repair his shoulder. But he could give him the watch.
John knew he had to take over and he concentrated and closed his eyes for a second. Then he straightened up and looked directly into Sherlock’s eyes.
“You don’t have to excuse yourself for your job. It’s all fine. You came. You were here. You spent time with me. We had wonderful sex. Everything is simply perfect.” Greg smiled.
“Something small is enough. We will start with a healthy breakfast tomorrow.” Mycroft pulled him up.
John knew the difference between subspace and unconsciousness. And he smiled carding through his hair.
“I was worried after Greg told me what happened in the morgue and at Dr Watson’s flat.”
“No, I haven’t. Do you think something has happened?” He reached into his pocket for his mobile.
“Of course, I will.”
Sherlock woke completely and carefully looked. The moment he realised where he was and what he had done in his sleep he pushed himself up and off Ian's body.
“You like this …” He sounded surprised. Mycroft tilted his head.
“It's perfect. You look great. The look suits you.” Sherlock believed him and was very pleased.
He hurried and was back before John woke. Right when he had put the coffee on the table, John appeared inside the door rubbing his eyes.
Sherlock would plant these thoughts into his brain. He knew it worked. He had done such things before.
After dinner, John stood and looked at Sherlock.
“Everything I do to you turns out shit...” Sherlock turned away and wanted to leave the bedroom.
Mycroft opened his mouth but didn’t utter a single word. Carefully, Greg reached out and stroked over his cheekbone.
“Kneel and ride my cock.” Sherlock pulled his cock until it was hard again and lowered himself down. His behind was sore and hurt but he forced his body down. He needed to please him no matter what the costs were. He rode him for a while and when he was close, John stopped him.
The car with their protection detail kept following them steadily. Once and again, Greg checked the rear mirror but they were still there.
“I will mix some. It's no problem.” Mycroft thought about Sherlock's experiments with chemistry in his younger years and swallowed. Sherlock thought about his dom's cooking lessons and swallowed too. But at least now they came in handy. Plus, they were memories that didn't cause him any pain or made his brain melt remembering them.
He thought with a smile.
Sherlock reached the motorway rather quickly and obviously had fun driving the car. He had never even told John that he could drive. But was there really anything he couldn’t do?
“I think you need a proper haircut. And I know John approves because we sort of talked about it.”
“Good boy! Good boys deserve a reward, don’t they?” He cut off the rope between his wrists and the bed. Sherlock’s arms fell down and he bit into the sheets sobbing once. John massaged his arms while the beads kept working him up again. He also took away the make-shift blindfold.
“You are welcome.” Mycroft just swirled his brolly once and left. Sherlock finished his blood and licked over his lips. He felt all lazy and sated which was a rather unknown and alien feeling. As if he ever could be exhausted. But it felt also good. It was good to know that John was sleeping in his bedroom.
“Yes, of course, I will. But afterwards you will need to listen to me too.” Mycroft said.
“Yes, I am. And you are?” Sherlock asked back sneering. John stood a bit closer to him to calm him down. He didn’t want to be thrown out. He still hoped for another bath in the whirlpool. Not alone.
“Your reaction clearly shows I made a mistake. Several mistakes. I want to explain myself. I want to make it better. I don’t want to lose you.” Mycroft just said what came into his mind.
John's tight grip lessened and he let go of him after a few minutes. He pulled his hair back and kissed his neck.
He was fast. Sherlock followed his moves, in fact, he followed him and stood close to him. He was scared and he needed to be close.
“You want me to throw these darts and then take their money?” Greg nodded.
He clung to the man's muscular arm and widened his stance.
He sat there for hours until it was dark. John moved around over his head and returned sometime later to sit in his armchair. Sherlock didn’t move from the floor where he sat on his heels. He kept staring at the back of John’s armchair.
John grinned. Hopefully it had hurt. Unfortunately, he hadn’t broken his neck. His eyes slanted. He was a doctor, for God’s sake. He needed to help. Slowly he got up and his limp was bad, the pain was beyond bearable. But he grabbed his med-kit and left his room.
“Are you telling me that Sherlock is actually a brat?” Greg grinned.
“Go ahead.” He pushed his hips forward and Greg moved. He opened his belt and fly. He reached inside and gently took hold of his cock. It was indeed huge and massive. He had been leaking and the head was dark red. Veins run over the length of it and it looked very strong.
“I feel much better. He shall have it. I like the idea. Perhaps he is going to frame it.” He giggled.
“Would you like a drink, Master?” John nodded and Sherlock quickly cleared the table and returned with a whiskey on a silver tray. He placed it in front of his dom.
“Sherlock, wake up! Dinner is ready. You must be hungry. Come on and join me!” He talked a bit louder. Sherlock grunted and stirred. Suddenly he shot up and stared at John.
When John put his nipple between the metal, he wildly twitched and shook his head.
At first, he cried for a while. He didn’t bother to get up and blow his nose. He didn’t bother to eat or drink. A while later, he fell asleep and hung there with his legs over the armrest while evening became night and the room became dark.
“Please?” John pecked a buttery kiss on his lips and stood. He poured him coffee.
“Now turn on your front!” John did that and Sherlock untied his wrists only to turn him around and restrain his hands to the headrest. Then he pulled him down and tied his ankles to the posts. He let his eyes roam over his body. His bound genitals were an angry red and they must hurt. Sherlock smiled.
“But I really don't want to yell at him. It will force him to...” Ian shook his head.
“Any idea who?” She asked.
“You are such an actor, Sherlock! Just tell me, what do you want?” He once shook his head by his hair making him hiss.
“There we go. Colonel Sebastian Moran, an ex-soldier, too. No parents, but there is a sister in a hospital and he pays for her. She is sick, blood cancer.”
Their eyes met again and Sherlock looked somewhat expectantly at him.
“I am nothing of the sort!” He sounded indignant.
“Very well.” Greg turned his head back and simply pulled a blindfold out of the bag. He returned to Mycroft’s side and covered his eyes. It was a leather blindfold and had a buckle at the side so you wouldn’t rest on it.
“I know what to expect then. Thanks for the pep talk, John. See you tomorrow.” John ended the call and looked at his mate.
“I am very pleased so far. I will be back tomorrow to have another look at you, Sherlock. I will leave some ointment for your chest and groin.”
“Thank you.” He murmured not looking at him.
“Where was that exactly?” Sebastian asked and Sherlock showed him on his mobile.
“Yes. I am going to see my brother and Greg after having seen my brother's doctor for another tedious examination.”
John’s fingers found Sherlock’s shirt and clawed into the fabric. Sherlock moved closer and held him close to his body. He roughly whispered into his ear.
“Where is the promised item?” Mycroft imperiously asked from down below stretching his long body rather languidly all over the bed.
“I am used to it, John. Don’t worry.”
“So, I see.” Then Sherlock looked at Sebastian by his side and it occurred to him that John might find this a bit weird because he was still only clad in the sheet.
“Are you alright, Sherlock?” John asked.
“I sure hope so.” Sherlock replied.
They were interrupted by a soft knock and Mycroft instantly pulled back.
“Come closer, please?” Sherlock said and John happily obliged. He leant against Sherlock who embraced him. Both men sipped their drinks and it was good. And when Sherlock’s tumbler fell from his fingers because he had fallen asleep with his head on John’s shoulder, John just placed him on his back and huddled close to him.
He was convinced now that his submissive would behave perfectly tomorrow and he dished out a reward.
“I know. But this is Greg with my brother. I want them to have a good time. I want them to be happy.” Sherlock quietly said. John smiled.
“What are you up to?” Greg asked curiously and looked around. Mycroft straightened his slim body and faced Greg.
John slowly woke. He was poked in his side and it was such a disturbing feeling. He tried to move his hands up but found he couldn’t. He suddenly realised that his hands were tied on his lower back. This made him wake up rather quickly. He opened his eyes and looked directly into very dark-brown ones. Actually, they were almost black.
“We should do something nice today.”
Greg woke with a start when the bullet hit. He stared at the living-room of 221B and exhaled. He also shook his head and sat up. He ruffled his hair and rubbed over his face.
“How is Sherlock?” Ian asked looking at Mycroft.
on a stage, Detective Inspector.” Greg didn’t react.
Sherlock returned to kiss him and John opened up all by himself. Sherlock’s free hand palmed his crotch and slowly rubbed over it. John almost toppled over but was held. This had shot right into his brain making him dizzy. Sherlock kept rubbing and kissing and John didn’t resist. Instead, he was making very wanton noises. He felt close. This was embarrassing, wasn’t it? He felt hot. And then he pressed up and against Sherlock who at once intensified both his kisses and groping.
He suddenly remembered how his dom had taken everything away from him. He wasn't allowed on crime-scenes anymore. At first it had only happened once in a while but not long after he stayed at home all the time. Naked and collared.
John stretched and his bones cracked. He looked at Sherlock and tenderly smiled. This was his life now. He had a life with Sherlock bloody Holmes and it was amazing. Even though there were still some problems to solve, it didn’t matter. He was the happiest and luckiest man on earth.
