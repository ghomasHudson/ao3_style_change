whether you look like this or the way you did the first time I met you. And even though you might be in this body the rest of our lives, I'll still love you, and I'll still want to make love to you. Because you're
And Steve was only partially certain it was the company that made the breakfast as deliciously decadent as it was.
The entire congregation went silent at that, not out of reverence for Thor's words but more because it seemed none of them really knew what to say to it.
Thor followed after them, and after he'd gone, Tony said, "Well, that was a stimulating conversation."
And then in an exploding flash of gold and lavender, she vanished, leaving the others to stare at the empty space where she had once stood. Bruce waved away the smoky haze that remained, and Steve turned to Thor and said in the most serious and business-like voice Tony had ever heard, "Is she just spouting off hyperbolic nonsense or is there any truth to what she's saying?"
Tony weighed this a moment, tilting his head back and forth in thought. "Might be kind of fun for a while."
Both jumped away from each other at that, and he was reminded of that time that Peggy had caught him with that secretary. Well, that wasn't exactly it. That secretary had kissed
"Yeah, right," he said and turned back to the others. "Anyway, so, again, different body, no condoms. Oops! Now we've got one of these."
Barnes stared at him a moment, light eyes skirting all over his face like he was looking for some sort of tell that Tony was just bullshitting him or pulling his leg — or suffering some sort of breakdown — before he exhaled a breath and shook his head.
Startled by being addressed by name, he sat back away from Tony only the slightest and said a very dignified, "Uh..." and looked around for signage, his brain somehow having shorted out at that moment. "Water Street," he said, remembering his last position.
Tony turned off the TV and squeezed the remote so tightly in his hand that it cracked. He startled and relaxed his grip to look at the damage he'd done, staring down at the fractured and broken plastic that was much more brittle than he'd thought it was.
She smiled again, and Tony still felt like it was done to try and put him at ease. "All right, Tony, I'm going to have one of the nurses take you over to the exam room, and we can get started with that. Make sure everything's as it should be."
"Fucking bitch," he spat at her, knowing his best option now was to stall and wait for one of the others to find him. Goddamn it, why had he stopped to chit-chat? Why hadn't he just blasted the bitch when he'd had the chance?
He swallowed, touched by the sincerity of Thor's words. It was stupid to get hung up on things like whether or not he was
He shook his head to clear it of the useless thoughts, Nat and Bucky taking that opportunity to appear, strolling out of the elevator together, Nat wearing a pair of long-sleeved, flannel pajamas with what looked like candy canes on them, her hair pulled up into a ponytail, and Bucky in a long-sleeved maroon shirt and gray pajama pants. They all exchanged various forms of 'Merry Christmas,' with Thor's being the loudest of them all, and Steve watched as Jim caught Tony's eye and nodded surreptitiously at Nat and Bucky like he was trying to get information out of him about them. Tony just made a slight shrugging motion as though to say he didn't know.
He wasn't sure what to expect when he got downstairs. He didn't expect all the lights and festive decorations, that was for sure, and he didn't expect high-pitched giggles and low, rumbling chuckles. He didn't expect a voice that said, "No, no, wait for Daddy to get downstairs. Daddy's been looking forward to this for weeks." He stopped in the foyer and just listened for a moment. Obviously, Tony hadn't cottoned to the fact that he'd already come downstairs, and he waited to see if this Tony would slip up and say anything he shouldn't. Instead, all he got was, "Now, what the hell station is
"You are more right than you could possibly know," he muttered and took another bite of his sandwich. His abdomen thumped a bit in a weird show of something like solidarity.
beyond a shadow of a doubt he could trust Steve with his baby and that Steve would do everything in his power to ensure no ill ever became her.
"—and all I'm saying is if the T-1000 here really is Cap's best pal, he would acknowledge that age is but a number and it doesn't matter if Cap's robbing the cradle with your boy or not. They're soul mates, as we've been told. Doesn't matter how old they are or what they look like. They are, evidently, meant to be together."
He sighed and flopped a little to try and get comfortable, but it was kind of hard to do without a super soldier there to be spooned by, and he thought about going down to the lab to work on some stuff, but he was sure Natasha, at the least, had JARVIS spying on him and set to inform on him if he so much as glanced in the direction of the elevator.
It wasn't, really, because Steve very gladly jumped into those conversations and would ask Rhodey to tell him everything about how Tony had been back in those days. And Rhodey would very gladly relay every and all embarrassing and awkward moments that he could remember, and Tony could not
know — what was going to happen, he could feel himself getting wetter, muscles clenching while his clit began to fill with blood.
Steve, hold on!" he said through laughter, and Steve stopped and waited for Tony to get a hold of himself.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, my god. Are you about to tell me you 'took a lot of liberties' with me? What is this? The 1940s? Don't answer that, you old man. Look—" He reached out and grabbed a hold of Steve's face with one hand, nimble fingers pressing into the flesh of Steve's cheek. "I would not have let you do any of what you did if I didn't want it. I wanted it. Oh, god, did I want it! That was fucking amazing, and those girls that didn't want to give you the time of day all those decades ago don't know what they missed. So, whatever crazy shit you've got going on in that noble blonde head of yours, throw it all in the garbage dump, forget about it, and get some rest because you are doing that to me again sometime within the next two hours — uh, assuming I don't turn back, anyway. I mean, what was the point of doing this to me, anyway? For a joke? Oh, god, you don't think that was Loki, do you? Or Loki's ghost, seeing as Thor thinks he's dead? That greasy-haired little prick would think it would be funny to turn me into a woman." He shook his head. "Never mind. Forget I said any of that. We'll figure it out later. For now, I just... Look, I know we just did it, but I still really need to feel you inside of me again sometime soon, so, give me a couple hours to rest up and hope this ache subsides a little, and then we'll go for round two."
He watched as Steve swallowed, his gazing raking over Tony from head-to-toe before settling back at his most prominent attributes.
He didn't say a word. He just pulled his hand back and set it back on the wheel at the two o'clock position and continued to focus his attention on the road, and a little voice in the back of Tony's head wondered if this portended bad things to come for the weekend ahead.
Tony stole a quick look at Natasha but saw she'd schooled her face into something completely solid and neutral, not one muscle denoting that anything Barnes had said was a lie.
Hill and Natasha once again exchanged looks, and it was Hill that said, "For all that Steve understands the…special circumstances of this situation, there's a part of him that sees it completely on the surface and—"
Tony spun on his heel and stormed over to the elevator, and JARVIS opened the doors immediately. As soon as the doors had closed, Olivia's face screwed up into hurt and fear, and she took off running.
"Physically, I'm a real girl," he corrected. "I've got the right parts and, oh, yeah, there's the little matter of me being
"You didn't want the living room getting a mess, you shouldn't have brought the food in here," Steve said pointedly.
Well, he wasn't so bad in his other body. He'd never taken this one out for a test drive in that regard, and he wasn't sure Steve would exactly be crazy about him doing it now. Something about chances for 'miscarriage' or 'stillbirth' or whatever. Steve would figure out
Steve reached out and put his hands over Tony's, stilling his actions. "No, this was a good idea. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything."
Steve made a face but averted his gaze and said, "I guess… I mean I just assumed. Esmeralda only said anything about
Natasha's confusion morphed into pity, and she frowned and reached out a hand to rub his back. "Honey, it— I know you don't want—"
"My cock barely contained by silky lace panties," he continued, barely noticing how Steve had already gotten the lace panties off and was working at the garter belt, "black—
Olivia just made some overtures at him like she was hungry, and he sighed and said, "Yeah, OK, fine," and went into the living room, Olivia against his hip and the coffee in his other hand. He settled onto the couch and set the coffee down on the table beside him then cradled the baby against his chest and began to nurse her, meeting her gaze as she looked up at him and smiling at her as he did so.
"Uh huh," he said and opened the fridge. So, alternate universe Cap and Tony wore wedding rings, alternate universe him called Cap 'babe,' and alternate universe Cap evidently worried about his safety. Well, that's was nice. Sickeningly sweet, maybe, but nice, he supposed.
But she laughed and said, "Oh, you Midgardians. So conservative in your thinking! Always believing it has to be one or the other. Good or bad. Black or white—" She nodded knowingly at Tony. "
"And then some," Tony said with an easy shrug, but instead of shrinking away from the comment, Barnes nodded at him.
"Yeah? I don't see you popping one of these out and letting it latch onto your tit. Incidentally, if you do, get the drugs. Holy shit, get the drugs."
," he muttered, making that sour face that Tony only half-jokingly thought was becoming his normal look.
looking at me like that! You know, we're in trouble if you ever turn evil, because if you asked me to burn the Earth to a charred cinder with that look on your face, I'd do it in a heartbeat."
He jumped up and snatched his phone, leaving the browser open to the page about Tony Stark and his bid for matrimony. Whatever Tony was up to, it was not going to end with the cracks in his heart being repaired. Not after all this time.
He turned around, and Steve was caught just on the wrong side of the threshold, and he stopped, swallowed, and turned, unable to contort his face into anything other than the proverbial deer-in- the-headlights.
He swallowed and nodded slowly, blinking as he tried to take this in. "And Tony'll continue to age while I—"
Steve made a hesitant, guttural sound as he looked at the TV where some blonde...haired...he guessed...thing that he supposed was made to resemble an...elf...was making herky-jerky movements as he talked to a...reindeer with a red nose?
he'd lost Barnes yet again. He watched as Steve moistened his lips, seemingly contemplated something, then nodded, resolute at whatever he'd decided.
He took a breath, squared his shoulders, and then reached in and scooped her up then swung her into his arms. She went with it, seeming to find the action nothing out of the ordinary, and he settled her against his chest. There was something warm and comforting about having her in his arms, and he cuddled her closer and breathed in that light, sweet scent that all babies seemed to have about them (he didn't have much experience with them, but he had enough to know there was a certain scent babies had about them). He brushed his lips over her forehead and then smiled when their gazes met, her dark eyes staring right back into his blue ones.
at saying the words, and he knows that, but he loves you, and he needs you. He needs you more than he's ever needed anyone. And he feels like an absolute jerk for making you feel that way — like you're not enough for him or you're not good enough for him. Because the truth of the matter is he's afraid he's not enough for
He sat at the table in the small Brooklyn apartment the organization that called itself SHIELD had set up for him. He couldn't complain; it was actually a nice joint — much nicer than the dump he'd lived in before the war. It was clean and seemingly well-built and had good lighting. Certainly not the tenement-living he'd done as a kid.
…but I can still feel him. I can still— He's alive. I know he's alive. I can still feel that he's alive. I don't— I can't explain it, but I just
Barnes wasn't making eye contact, instead looking down like he was trying to process, trying to think.
"Maybe we could try that here?" Steve said with a shrug, a somewhat hopeful tone in his voice. Tony met his eyes, and he smiled a little in return.
"Because she's a fucking lunatic and thinks Steve and I are soul mates, and she thinks that because we're soul mates, we're supposed to want this. According to Blondie, this is kind of her MO. Nothing really out of the ordinary about it. Pulls this shit all the time, just not normally on humans."
He also had to pee again by the time they finished eating. His trip to the bathroom this time was uneventful, even if there was a frickin' line this time — why did it seem like there was
Rhodey just frowned and tilted his head a bit in confusion, and Steve said, "Esmeralda. It's part of the spell."
Tony spent a few moments figuring out exactly what Thor had said before he nodded and said, "I will take postcards."
"She gets it from you," Tony was saying as he walked back into the room, and Steve turned, chocolate still in hand, and watched as Tony went around the couch and snatched up his coffee from the table.
it — and it didn't come to pass? Words couldn't describe the amount of hurt that could and would cause him. So, if he told himself that all of that was part and parcel of another universe, when it didn't happen here, he couldn't get upset over it. It wasn't meant to happen here. It was all a part of another time and place.
Steve nodded, and he watched a moment longer before he said like he'd been dancing around bringing the subject up for a while and had finally decided to bite the bullet, "Uh…Buck said he had something he wanted to talk to me about. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"
"Then do it! Damn the press and whatever they say about us. We know the truth. Who cares what they think?"
Steve exhaled what Tony took to be a relieved breath, but Tony said, "That's good, right? That means she's good."
Tony put his hands to his hips again, finding it easier this time than it had been before. "You're going to make me walk over there in
in the fuck had be been thinking while he was pregnant? — and Steve sitting on the couch to sketch the hours away. It was a setup they had undertaken several times in the past, only now in addition to the two of them, there was a little brown-eyed infant girl carefully tucked into the couch cushion next to Steve, arms and legs spread like a little starfish, pacifier in her mouth, and eyes closed as she slumbered peacefully in the presence of her parents. As Tony tried to salvage what he could from his projects, Steve kept his concentration on the sketchbook on his lap, glancing over to the baby sleeping beside him every now and then to make sure she was still safe and happy and peaceful.
"Helen," Pepper replied, and Steve tried the name out silently on his tongue before he nodded again and took a deep breath then pulled himself away from the two and strode off to make dear, old Helen's day.
Oh, not that he hadn't tried. He had. He'd been jerked off and sucked off in his 'chorus girl' days (he wasn't sure he'd ever forget that rather...apt...description of him by Colonel Phillips), but he'd never really been able to seal the deal, so to speak, when it came to actual, penetrative sex. Or he hadn't been. He'd quite clearly and easily been able to penetrate Tony, and he'd loved every single goddamned moment of it — the warmth and the fit and the absolutely wanton noises Tony made beneath him. Or above him. He had to admit there was just something about the way Tony would ride him like a goddamned stallion. But Tony was a fella, and he'd long thought maybe that was the difference.
Tony just reached up and patted his hand. "Don't worry," he said and stood up, Barnes's hand falling away from his shoulder. "You're not the first one to tell me that."
Rhodey snorted a laugh, and Pepper shook her head, and while Barton put his hands up like he was not touching that with a ten-foot pole, Natasha stepped into the conversation and said, "You do realize you just called your husband an idiot."
at it. When it all boiled down to it, cooking was about creation, and if there was one thing Tony Stark was a master at, it was creating things.
He pulled his head back a little to press his face into Steve's shoulder then turned his head to rest his cheek there. "Not exactly. She just thinks we're playing with our toys. She can't understand why she can't come into the room when we're playing with our toys. We go into her room when she's playing with her toys."
Steve continued to stare at her, stuck for anything to say, and she exhaled a breath and said, "Well, if you won't be needing me anymore, I guess I'll take my leave."
Steve just quirked his lips and shoved the bite of cake into Tony's mouth, his fingers brushing against Tony's lips. Tony took the portion on his tongue and closed his lips over Steve's fingertips to get every last crumb and morsel before he fed Steve his, and Steve took Tony's fingers in his mouth and gently sucked off every bit of crumb and icing and sugar and grease that had collected.
"Yeah, well, he just guaranteed himself a tracking chip now. What's our best option for that, J? Neck? Skull?"
there was some possible way he'd tapped into some kind of parallel world — a world that was similar to but not quite his. He couldn't think of any other way to explain it or describe it.
Tony huffed a bit and folded his arms, again, making sure to adjust his arms properly not to… bother himself. God, how did women deal with this?
Thor just blinked at him then started talking about some seasonal Asgardian festivity where a most splendid occasion was always had by all.
"Do we?" he asked and picked up a tablet he'd found lying around. He sat down at the bar and clicked on the display and began to search for child-sized furniture.
"He's been actin' real funny all day," a little childlike voice said. "It's 'cuz Daddy's gone 'way on a mission. He always gets funny when Daddy goes away."
Bruce frowned a moment before he glanced in the direction Natasha had nodded in, and Tony grinned and pulled one hand from where he was cradling Olivia to give Bruce a slight wave in greeting.
“I want to know more about this story, but at the same time, I’m horrified for your well-being,” Tony remarked.
“I should not have laughed at that. The thought of you dying makes me want to throw up, but sunflower seeds? I think I would’ve liked to have seen pictures of you and May on a date.”
Agent Laura: I think Friday has notes on their research and the specs on their multidimensional communications device.
FRIDAY: Mr. Stark is not hiding from you. He is in a controlled area and does not have access to his cell phone. However, he will contact you once he is able to do so.
So I did get to see Thor: Ragnarok yesterday and it was fabulous. No spoilers from me but it doesn’t affect this story because the events take place 10 months to a year after where we currently are. The events of the second and third act of Doctor Strange have not even occurred yet in the story’s timeline. We are even two months from the epilogue scene from season three of AOS, so AOS season 5 will not be affecting us. (God, that trailer was awesome.)
Me: The UN really likes you. They are thinking about using small teams of enhanced persons to do black ops stuff, like rescuing victims from terrorists.
Tony: And May just read that in this kind of glaring at me way and I kind of was just forced to explain what happened.
Anthony: Nothing is idle with Pepper. I will deal with her on my own, starting with rescheduling lunch.
I don’t hold you accountable for what happened with the train or what happened afterwards. Only Hydra and maybe myself. I’m working on it with the doctors here.
“He is a smart kid which is why you should let him decide if he wants to go public, not your PR team." Steve tells his boyfriend poignantly.
Me: Good answer. Mister Purple Arrow is not happy that she joined Shield to get him back in the country. Mrs. Purple Arrow is not happy that he went rogue when Ross threatened the kids to get your latest location. She says this is the messiest it’s been since their separation and her time in rehab. Not quite bad enough as the thing that caused their separation, but there’s still a lot of stuff they have to work through, like him trying to divorce her to protect her and the kids from Ross.
Counselor Laura: Actually, I don’t know. There’s no version of Steve Rogers in the multi-verse that is 100% perfect at sharing his feelings. They’re trying, but they’re not perfect.
So like comic book and Spider-Verse movie canon, Miles, a.k.a. Spidey Junior was bitten by a genetically altered spider and got superpowers. But in this story, that spider bite acted as an outside catalyst that caused his inhuman gene to activate differently than normal, which is why Miles has a few different powers then Peter, because he got his powers from two separate sources. You’ll find out about those later. I’m using comic book Daisy’s power origin story for inspiration.
BITC: Even though I really wish he would disappear. I still don’t trust the guy even though he obviously isn’t trying to keep Peter from MJ.
Nomad: He admitted that he had a crush on me when he was a kid, but he didn’t answer when I asked if he still had a crush on me.
Me: I think it’s pretty much a match made in political appointee hell, but Jeffrey probably would’ve been made Director without your suggestion. So it could’ve been worse. So much worse.
Purple arrow 2018: Things are better with Phil. We've talked a lot, especially since the separation. He's on your side, by the way. He thinks I'm a fucking moron for leaving, and he's right. I was stupid; I shouldn't have left.
Purple Princess: Her mom died in the battle of New York, so I’m going to let her be mad at me. We have other classmates whose parents have been killed by Stark weapons. That means I have their blood on my hands. I’m the merchant of death Junior, or maybe it’s the third. So yes, I’m going to let people be mad and hurl insults at me. Actually, one of our classmates hates me because her family got expelled from Wakonda. So I have a lot of people mad at me for a lot of reasons.
Football Hunter: I can give you sex tips. You seem like the type that would be very skilled with your tongue.
Monkey lover 2: Maybe. I’m at least inclined to believe that the future is not as finite as I believed previously. Let’s leave it at that.
Agent M: I had to lay low after the implosion. Hill knew where I was. I sent you the baby present when I was trying to retire after a disgruntled former colleague tried to kill my dad to get to me. It didn’t last.
Tony Potts: A little. May and Steve are getting a divorce. They say it will happen when we undo everything. I think it’s going to end regardless, even if we fail miserably. There’s this little part of me that is happy about Steve being single. I feel awful that May’s giving me the green light to climb her soon-to-be ex-husband like a tree.
Also to those I told that this chapter would be the virtual Star Trek date or saw that in the review section, I accidentally got the order of chapters confused. For this story, I sometimes write these chapters as much as 2 to 3 months in advance (at least the initial draft) and sometimes I forget exactly which chapter is which.
Chief Mechanic: Yes, and then everything went to shit. Although at least the Earth was still in one piece. I guess that's the timeline that Monkey Lover two was trying to avoid.
“Listen to your little friend. You are aware that if I wanted to destroy you, I could.” Loki boasted.
Chief mechanic: She may also benefit from Wakanda’s advancements in cancer research. Her successor from the bad timeline is a jackass. I think it would be best for the Wakanda government to make sure he never comes into power. Also, I need to talk to the lawyers about protecting the bodies of my children. That way, in the event of their untimely death, they won’t become government science experiments. They are not sentient weapons, the fucking asshole.
Hunter won’t give me any additional information either because he’s either too busy making out with Leo now that they finally acknowledge that they’re in love or making sure nobody sees him with other field agents. Apparently, he’s really not supposed to be here but he doesn’t want to leave Leo alone. He’s wearing a nano mask to conceal his identity. Note to self, make a better version for big brother.
Melinda: It’s not a regular purse, it’s a Shield Mission purse with a hidden weapons compartment. It also contains her work lanyards and a Shield badge. It was issued in October 2016.
Me: You have me, Pepper, Rhodey, Laura and the kids. That’s like six maybe, seven people if you count Nate.
Anthony: Weird home accident when I was nine involving a footstool and trying to change a lightbulb.
Me: He has been a complete asshole to his nephew who transitioned. However there’s more to the story. Pre-transition, S was trying to date her. She said no and suddenly she’s fired despite signing the Accords and following all other required procedures. My lawyers are going to have so much fun.
“Who occasionally have sex.” Thanks to the automatic driving feature, he did check to see if Steve was blushing. He was. It was adorable.
Me: Yes. I think at this point in our relationship we know the real story and Google story. So maybe we could skip to the next question.
The Mechanic: That would just be a nice bonus. Although, if you go to the State Department to renegotiate the Accords, who will be in charge of secret Shield. I don’t think you can do both.
“I think I want to tour the location in person before we decide on anything. The signing ceremony for the Mumbai agreement is tomorrow because we finally agreed on the final text an hour ago. I’ll be home soon.” Steve remarked.
Heroism doesn’t come from the suit or superpowers or anything else superficial like that. One of the greatest heroes I’ve ever met never had any of that. The voice in your suit for the last few days was that of Agent Phil Coulson. He has been a field agent since before you were a zygote. The man has saved the world so many times he has literally lost count. He doesn’t even remember the details anymore.
“Only because you are my boyfriend’s friend and Lily Bear’s favorite aunt. That poor kid is already damaged enough especially with the parents arguing about mommy wanting to stay a secret agent. I can’t add to that.”
BITC: I can’t even believe I’m suggesting this but Flash’s apartment? I don’t think that’s on my banned list.
Anthony: Or the dozens of designers working under me. It doesn't matter because I’m the one who didn’t realize what our weapons were really doing. I’m the one who wasn’t paying attention to Obadiah. See you get good friends and I get bloodsucking leeches like Obadiah with the occasional Rhodey to keep me from completely going over the edge.
FRIDAY: He wanted the president to be aware of the effect that the current enhanced person policy is having on the children of those under jurisdiction of the Accords. He also invited Ms. Kahn of Jersey City to attend with him.
Red phone: We said that we would keep talking to each other last time and I know I disappeared for a couple of days, but I thought we could try another chat session tonight.
"Steve doesn't have an ex-girlfriend." Okay apparently May never told Natasha about dating Steve and Tony definitely wasn't going to tell her. But here they were.
Nomad: I know you think everybody hates you, but I think this proves otherwise. You don't get somebody teddy bears and flowers if you hate them.
Please know I’m waiting for other chapters to come back from proofreading so there may be more than a one-week way for the next chapter. But I will resume regular posting once chapters start trickling in again.
Cuddle fiancé: Will be home soon. Home. While we were trying to find Coulson, Joey and Vision signed the Mumbai agreement as the US and UN Avengers representatives. I’m now allowed back on American soil.
Friday: Our relationship is merely mutual scientific curiosity. Although, I would not be averse to seeing Dr. Fitz shirtless.
But maybe there’s this part of her that is still annoyed with Steve for punching Clint. Yes, Steve and Clint are friends again. Perhaps even best friends, but she can still be annoyed.
“Although he has seven doctorates, I don’t think any of them were in this field. You need Tony. You need the Princess and Leo, and unfortunately, I know for a fact at least he is stuck in my timeline. I’m also 99% sure the Princess was a casualty of the decimation. Which means Tony is the best available option.” She argued.
“Even then. I now know that it’s better to have loved and lost. I don’t regret my time with my Simmons.” Leo tells her with a sad smile. “Even though I’m never going to see her again, I am grateful for what time we did have together. If I can’t change things, don’t you want to have as much time with Phil as you possibly can before the end?”
“But then we would have to talk to each other without a guide. That could dissolve into yelling and screaming. We have to work together.” Tony wants to find the path that leads to their wedding and the two of them growing old together.
Me: I really don’t care what they think. I’ve been asked 20 times in the last two days if I knew James Leopold had a husband before we offered him the CCO position. I just keep pointing them to the SI anti-discrimination policy.
Genius Princess: But this is frozen coffee with whip cream and chocolate sauce. I believe it’s called a frappe. He also brought me a croissant. Technically I’m no longer in the lab while I’m eating. See, I took a break.
Purple Princess: She was Hydra, which means that they're going to have to do another round of ferreting people out. I feel like that should warrant a presidential briefing all on its own.
Tony: Yes, I also have GMA Tuesday morning. I have to sell everybody on me being happy and stable in a committed relationship with somebody who just happens to look a lot like that guy who I was fighting with back in May. Total coincidence. But our stock is going up, so I have to get out there and sing and dance to keep it that way.
Monkey Lover 2: I think I threw up at least twice today. But at least she’s gone and never coming back. I watched her body burn. Then I incinerated the CPU that had her original code. I destroyed it all, except what I need to build a backup plan in case certain things still come to pass, like Robbie’s uncle. I’ve already created the antidote just in case that damn box shows up to bite us in the arse.
Genius Princess: Actually, we almost had one yesterday. The Secret Avengers took care of it. That's how General Hale died.
Anthony love: You deserved it for breaking her daddy’s nose. I hope you sent him an apology basket for that.
Maybe I have been putting too much pressure on him. An internship at Stark Industries is an important thing. I make it my life’s goal to not be anything like my father and I kind of feel like I might be doing that by putting too much pressure on Peter.
Me: He was a good guy and why am I not surprised? You do make a habit of doing that sort of thing. Still are actually, even if I’m probably the only one who knows the truth. Although, I’m sensing that you’re not exactly completely happy with everything.
Steve: When I woke up, I had a SHIELD dossier with information about all of my friends and associates.
Me: That can’t happen until the Accords are renegotiated and re-ratified. Whoever ends up in charge will just be an acting until that happens. The Watchdog attacks made a lot of world governments realize the flaws in the Accords and they’re willing to go back to the negotiating table.
Me: Yes, and on to the other place as well to hang out with her princess friend. May is coming as well for both although the boyfriend will be coming back to the states before we begin our second leg. Somebody has to watch the agency and Mack wants to take his girlfriend down to Florida to meet his parents for Christmas. It’s a big step in their relationship.
Director Snookums: The media doesn't see it that way. Also let’s be honest, people are more afraid of an Asian woman with superpowers than a blonde white guy with a six-pack.
From the corner of his eye, he could see Steve blushing. Maybe that wasn’t his dick that ended up on Instagram. Unlike the rest of the world, Tony knows Steve isn’t hetero, and he could totally have a random dick saved to his phone. Unfortunately, it's been a while since Steve has changed with Tony. So he couldn't say 100% for sure it was Steve's not that little Stevie.
Counselor Laura: I’m sure they are in high demand if Steve is working as a counselor. Maybe I could send Suarez from the other timeline over here if we get things working right.
Karen: I have just been informed that Dr. Eli Morrow has been contained and a press conference will be happening momentarily. Slingshot thanks you for her new flame resistant uniform.
Anthony: Your closet case ex made a nasty comment about Pepper. He said something about her being ousted as CEO of Stark industries at any moment because she is no longer sucking my dick. Apparently, he’s too stupid to comprehend that some women are just better at things that him. Okay, most women are better at things than him.
A/N: Okay, so the presidency in the MCU requires some severe mental gymnastics to make sense, because it’s obvious that the writers on the Runaways and Luke Cage can’t keep presidents in the MCU separate from President’s in the real world. I had to get creative for it to kind of make sense.
Red phone: If we must put a label on it, that would put you as pansexual, which makes sense. This also explains why we got along like betta fish. I have been told by multiple people that I have a personality that's as abrasive as a Brillo pad.
Me: I know and I accept that. Time travel is not option that we know of yet. So things are what they are.
Me: Bureaucracy is slow. See this is why you do not screw the married aides of crooked politicians when you’re in the closet. The blackmail potential is too great, especially if you want to stay in the closet.
“No, but you learn to appreciate the moments you do have together more.” He hopes that’s true. He still cries on the car ride to the airstrip. Neither one of his teammates say anything. Yo-Yo just gave him chocolate.
Subject: If you’re going to go make out with your boyfriend in the Rose Garden, I deserve to know first.
Good news, I’m going to start working on the next batch of conversations this weekend. Bad news, my parents are coming to visit so it may be more than a week before I post the next chapter. It all depends on how much time I have when my house is filled with people.
SimmonsJA: Thank you. Although I was referring to everything Ross related. Friday sent us the video of what happened in Siberia. Don’t worry, we did not show it to the Director because we have some common sense.
Tony Potts: No. That would be Pepper. She tells me I always say things without thinking them through. She's worried about Morgan picking up my unhealthy habits.
“Sam and Natasha seem to be okay with us being together. You arranged for Wanda and Vision to be together so I’m pretty sure she’s already on your side.”
Tony: Okay, I am going to have to deal with Howard shit but really, what else is new. I’m always going to be paying for the sins of Howard. I really wish he would have said “Hell no,” when they wanted Shield to participate in Project Paperclip. I’m sure we haven’t even begin to deal with all the ghosts from that bad decision yet.
“Good to know. Basically, leaving here too quickly would make things worse, especially because I have meetings for the next six hours with various world leaders. We are trying to make it look like this was always the plan anyway."
Red phone: No. I like the color scheme you picked out. It is very soothing and I need soothing right now.
Me: That reminds me, when you get back from whichever country you’re in, the President wants to set up a meeting with you. I don’t know what country you’re in because Piper won’t tell me for security reasons.
Anthony: So the angle that we used to help agent 13 infiltrate the other side was her being mad at me for stealing her boyfriend.
Morgan’s dad: You know they say the first step is admitting you have a problem. Also, don’t put words in my mouth.
“We’ll fix that. Then the recently undusted you can have a poly relationship with other me and Simmons. It's good that you and Simmons have similar taste in men.” Leo laughed at his words. “And I know you will fix this as soon as you go through the notes.”
Me: I know it's hard for you to hear this, but the guy who saved your ass as a kid doesn't exist anymore.
“But a lot less than we had in April and I promise we will keep working through them. As I learned sometime during the mid-90s, orgasms don’t make everything go away. But they were quite enjoyable,” Steve responded by placing a kiss on Tony’s bare shoulder.
"Do you understand what really happened in Germany and Siberia?" Because Steve still wasn’t entirely sure what really happened and he’s been talking about it with his therapist for a while.
“And we're still trying to figure it out.” Leo followed up for his husband. Tony is totally calling Hunter Leo’s husband because they really were legally married, even if Hunter was unaware. Well as legal as it can be when technically the other person is from a different timeline.
Agent M: Technically, he’s enhanced. We can say that you were the Shield liaison to the Avengers and therefore not under UN jurisdiction. You would be free to come back.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation, you were all wonderful. Again, the timestamp is from Steve’s perspective.
Me: I’m sure it’s a Chinese curse word. Friday can render the word in a text message, but will not tell me a definition.
Also, please note that Tony is sending these emails from two different accounts. Tony_Carbonell is Tony’s private email account for personal non-Avenger, non-sensitive email. The Mechanic is Tony’s Avenger email account. Only Avengers, selective support staff, and Pepper know about this address.
Kitty brother: I’m in Norway working on a special project related to the current situation. However, unlike you, I know that sleep is necessary. I’m planning to return home with the artifact. Stark feels it’s safer with us.
Me: Dr. Suarez is actually functioning as Tony’s therapist right now. My role is as a life counselor or sobriety companion.
HSBF: I’m sure not all of them were corrupt. Deanna was great. She did really good work coordinating all of our children’s hospital visits.
Anthony: Because I have a thespian double. It’s almost enough to make me think Howard had an illegitimate love child before he married Maria and had me.
Anthony: I’m aware of that. I’m having dinner with friends tonight so I have to get dressed. So no hiding in my lab to cry about the fact that I will be a lonely bachelor for the rest of eternity for me tonight. But that does mean I need to cut this conversation short.
Me: Chris Evans and a sizable portion of Freaking Cool know the truth or at least think they do. Mostly the Stony shippers. Those are the ship names. Stony seems oddly appropriate for us.
Red phone: I mean Melinda Garner. I ran into her today. She works for the ATCU now. She seems nice, just sad and extremely terrifying, but in a Pepper chewing out the board way.
This is the first chapter completely written after the premier of WandaVision (as well as the first chapter proofread after Falcon and the Winter Soldier.) It’s also fun that it’s the first chapter I post after the end of Loki. Post-production on these chapters is longer than you think. With long stories like this, I like to write several chapters before I start posting them to be more cohesive.
Me: Well, unfortunately several members of the paparazzi saw Happy taking care of the ring so they’re kind of running with it. Apparently Pepper and I now broke up because I proposed to her and she turned me down and I was so heartbroken that I’m just now getting rid of the ring.
“Okay, so your daughter may have convinced me that real estate was where I should make some major investments, especially because things were so cheap post-snap. I might have acquired about 15% of the greater New York area. I should probably tell my people to make places habitable because we're going to need shelter if we're bringing everyone back soon."
BITC: Please, yes. I don’t like this arrangement. I want to live with my dad. What about MJ’s apartment?
Anthony: So, I’ve been informed that in 14 days Stefan Carter will be making his debut as my very public boyfriend at the Stark Industries sponsored conservation event on the margins of a huge conference I am crashing.
HSBF: Good. I didn’t get shot at nor did any government official show up at the safe house. Also, I’m cooking tonight so I don’t have to worry about any weird cooking experiments.
Tony: So, feel free to not respond to this text message if you’re still making quality time with the wayward husband, but I feel like I should check in considering everything that’s happened in the last week.
Me: I knew only speaking to each other in Spanish at board meetings would pay off. Perez is also the only one who is not an absolute asshole. She is our token good member. Why didn’t we kick out all of Obadiah’s cronies?
Anthony: That was in the diaries and Peggy hinted at it. But the nine-year-old that I used to be felt like he wasn’t loved and that’s why he was sent away.
: James "Rhodey" Rhodes a.k.a. War Machine a.k.a. Iron Patriot. Currently Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Apparently the agency was never actually disbanded, just went underground). Promoted to General before assignment to the agency. Sometimes referred to as “my James”. Best friend to Tony Stark.
Anthony: I wish we were video conferencing because that way you could see me rolling my eyes. I programmed her number into your phone under Agent America. I gave her one of our special phones just in case.
Yes I got your voicemail. I apologize for not responding sooner. I’ve been avoiding most calls due to the incident in Mumbai, the press are vicious. Your voicemail should’ve been passed to me earlier. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. Also by the time I listened to your message, it was after midnight in New York and it would just not be polite to call. That’s why decided to send an email instead.
Tosha: No, those two are being awkward and avoiding eye contact. Probably because they both know another Steve and Tony are engaged in Agent Barton’s timeline.
Tony Potts Stark seriously questioned his life choices after finishing his second text message conversation with Steve in two days. Although after recent revelations, he could use some quality Morgan cuddle time. It’s just to get Morgan cuddle time. Unfortunately, he would have to drive there with Steve. Which was fine because he had good fries and a milkshake.
"And I rather not have to talk to Sharon twice in the same day. Ana, send her a quick email that says I will call her after my 2 o’clock business meeting.”
“Unless the treatment’s not working and he is still a traitor, regardless,” May told him darkly and Leo responded by putting his head in his hands. “Also, I thought you and Stark made sure that couldn’t happen.”
Did you notice that this story is not marked as complete? That’s because we have two more post-credit scenes. However, they gave away some stuff for the early chapters of the SQL and therefore I have decided to post the final post-credit chapters in a couple of weeks. However, chapters from Text Messages from the Edge of High School will be uploaded in the interim.
“Is that why you never asked me for the shield back?” Tony has wondered about that a lot. Even more so after finding out other Steve changed his codename to Nomad and made May the new Captain America. The government wasn’t exactly happy about that and tried to take back the shield more than once. That doesn’t surprise Tony one bit. They’ve tried it with him. However, he’s no longer in the business of passing Stark weapons to the American government, even if they were designed by Howard.
Nomad: I don’t think their intent was malicious. I think they just wanted to keep you a sweet little kid, as long as they could.
Girl Friday: I think she prefers Leo as her boss. Despite the fact she had to cover up that he met with Asgardians yesterday and is secretly in charge of the UN Avengers.
Me: So you seem like the type of person who would want something they couldn’t regularly have so that’s why I think you would choose Bucky or a well Peggy.
I’m not mad about Stefan. If I can have a new boyfriend, you can have a new boyfriend. Okay, I’m a little mad. Not that you have a boyfriend, but that you didn’t tell me. How did it get this bad between us?
Once again, we are in our own branch timeline that started to diverge in 1955 (Although we don’t go completely off the rails until 2016 and 2018, respectively).
I originally had all of this together, but I decided that Laura’s conversation with her daughter and husband should be a second section. More to come soon.
HSBF: Yes, but then I realized that I missed half of the plot points of the first half of the movie because I was more into reading what you were writing then watching the movie. I decided it would be best to re-watch the whole thing from the beginning and that way I can give you my full undivided attention.
Cuddle bunny: I’m not even sure I can live up to the legend of Captain America. Actually, I know I can’t. That’s why I gave you the shield. I’m just as selfish and human as everyone else.
Tony: Thankfully, nobody’s using it against me personally, probably because the royal genius has been reading our text messages to each other. I think she has a better opinion of me because of that.
"I’m trying to think positively. I did get mistaken for Chris Evans twice today, despite my new contacts now giving me a different eye color than him.” Steve joked.
Director Snookums: As many times as I have had to save your ass over the years, you owe me that much.
CoulsonPJ: I think he just hates Ross. Jeffrey said too much at the meeting. I think the director is sending him to Alaska to do an assessment on the abomination for the next month to make up for it.
Tasha: They both are going to a meeting after this. Because we’re all too much to handle for the recovering alcoholics without the desire to drink cropping up.
Me: I told Joey that I have a boyfriend. Only you and me know that’s not true, mostly because I’m not sure what the hell we are.
Instead, there was a van parked in the middle of their usual lab space, and standing next to it was Scott. Although she hasn’t met the man in person, Sharon has given her many updates on her charge, complete with pictures, so she instantly recognized the man. What was he doing on the East Coast? His house arrest wasn’t up for a few more weeks.
The Mechanic: Understandable. Saturday is still on the table. Come to the tower. I’ll bring a chef and Laura. I’ll also bring Agent America as well as Yo-Yo who can help answer some of your questions about being a powered person in America. She is new to the country, but that’s because being a person with powers in Colombia was worse.
Blue phone: Close. I worked at an underground gay bar, actually. At least, that's what they would be referred to now. I was more of a bartender though.
Tony had a good day on the beach with Steve. They even had a little picnic. No beach sex but that’s probably for the best. There’s just some locations that you don’t want sand to end up in. Also, water issues. He lost a lot in Afghanistan, including the desire to ever do ocean escapades. Besides Piper would have probably ICE’d them if they tried. Steve was still blushing in front of her anyway.
First, Fitz only confesses his feelings for Simmons when they are stuck at the bottom of the ocean due to Hydra, just before sacrificing himself so she can get out. Thanks to Nick Fury (yes, really), they both survive. However, Fitz suffers brain damage due to hypoxia and Simmons can’t deal with the guilt which leads to awkwardness, her going undercover at Hydra, and dancing around each other until the end of season two when they finally get it together and agree to go on a date. Of course, at that moment a giant monolith transports Simmons to literally the other side of the universe to the planet whose name translates to death.
"So is this the part of the conversation where you tell me to leave your best friend alone or where are you threaten to kill me if I break Stevie Bunny's heart? I've already had various variations of this conversation including from somebody I changed the diaper of." Sharon was vicious but protective. Maybe if Steve ever returned, they might become friends.
I had this idea for a while that Tony was able to conceive Morgan because of stone magic. It was the purple one’s backup plan to keep Tony from messing up his vision. Although I bet, he didn't plan on Tony figuring that out. More to come.
Agent America: Stay dark. Make contact with BF only. I will take care of everything else. If I need to talk to you I'll send the message through him, and vice versa.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last section. You are all wonderful. We are still in the “Tony and Steve made bad choices” timeline. I was tempted to go back to the other timeline, but I felt like you would be furious with me if I didn’t cut back to Laura and Steve.
Me: I would’ve felt better knowing the truth. I hate him staying out late, wondering where he is. I was absolutely terrified when Laura and the agent showed up at the apartment early Sunday morning. I was absolutely terrified when the ferry incident happened and I had no idea where he was. I hate that feeling.
I talked to James. Who knows what happened from Agent Piper because you haven’t even bothered to debrief him on the situation yet. I am pretty sure you’re having a sex marathon with your boyfriend. I really thought you outgrew this after Cancun 07.
“I wish it wasn’t something that happened in both timelines. That mess is still my number three regret.” Tony explained.
The Mechanic: Maybe that fiasco was the real reason why I announced that I was Iron Man to the world so this time I would come out on my terms.
Agent M: Red Malibu is stable. Tell Liberty we are taking care of him. He doesn’t need to come here.
FRIDAY: Not necessarily. Ana Jarvis was a close personal friend of Director Carter. She may have investigated the incident simply as a means to receive closure.
“Tony, be respectful,” Steve mumbled rolling his eyes. A few moments later, his phone vibrated again.
Also a quick note, any text message that has in parentheses (message not sent) was never forwarded to the other person participating in the conversation.
“Yes, for a couple of months then she got reassigned and we were running missions, but we still kept in contact until she started dating someone else. Than conversation started to taper off. All communication stopped when Shield fell until a couple of months ago when thanks to Tony, we started speaking to each other again. Also, turns out the “boyfriend” after me end it up being Hydra.”
May: If we just bring people back, it would overwhelm the system. We can’t do that. Especially because we’re not planning to rewind the clock five years.
DILF: Maybe because I don’t know how to talk to you. It’s just easier to go through a whole basket of mozzarella sticks and churros.
D FitzSimmons: Why didn't you tell me you were planning this? I could've helped, and then I would know how to get home now.
Counselor Laura: As soon as you figure out how to send me back. Will I even get back in time to make a difference? It's already been a week.
“I know. And I think this is good for him. I think he’s found balance. He is really happy right now.”
Me: For a normal person. We’re not normal, but even we can’t do like 99 different jobs. So basically, we’re dividing the workload of the two of us amongst an additional person.
Red phone: Thankfully Kevin is really good at scheduling around those. I’m never going to be able to find someone else who can do that again.
Me: You can’t be responsible for the choices that other people make. He didn’t have to start making weapons out of alien tech and selling them on the black market to anybody willing to pay?
Tony: While you’re hiding out in only Thor knows where I’m going to send you a bunch of history books to read.
Red phone: Stop running near solo missions. You can’t die on me. Promise me that you won’t die on me.
“I feel that way every time Kamala comes home for the weekend. Morgan will be a teenager before you know it.”
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. We have another interlude with a new character for Steve to interact with. Enjoy.
"We do, but that’s something to work out when we get back to the compound.” He knows Tony's right. Steve just hates being useless.
Did you buy him that house? It feels like your type of guilt present. There’s no way he can afford a place like that in San Francisco. I know you’re personally paying for my rent here. Cousin Ana told me. Apparently, you didn’t like the housing the agency provided before.
Cuddle Bunny: Speaking of ridiculous things about you on the international news, apparently you’re meeting with the president today.
Me: I think people have always been nosy. They are just more assertive about it now. Also we have Twitter and TMZ.
[Redacted] misses you, by the way. He really looks up to you, which is good because you know about his uncle and I’m not sure if my husband is better. You should know that he’s not coming with me. He is actually going to be staying with a couple of friends until I leave. We are going to spend some time apart to sort things out. It was a mutual decision. He knows about [Redacted] being special. His reaction was not the best. He wants [Redacted] to be fixed, to just be a normal kid again. Obviously, he needs to do some soul-searching and we can’t be there for that. I can’t protect my son from everything, but I have to keep this from him.
Me: Of course, he would. This is a guy who won’t even use his children’s real names in text messages. Apparently he requested Friday to replace their names with Layla and Corey or something similar from now on.
Me: I'm even finding Mini Queens adorable even if we keep having to tell him that just because you have your own version of a Vulcan nerve pinch does not mean you can knock out bullies on the playground who make fun of your BFF for not being skinny.
Anthony love: Although maybe Agent America will go for a different body part then you. I feel there are some body parts that you would be really upset if she attacks.
“I know, and I wish we would’ve fixed things, but we wouldn’t have Morgan or Robin or even Kamala. I hate thinking about us not having them, even if it was at the expense of something so horrible. I don’t want to lose my daughters. I’m terrified that when we undo the decimation, I’m going to lose them both. Kamala because her parents will be back and Robin because of the divorce.” Via the rearview mirror, Tony can see there is a tear falling down Steve’s cheek.
Me: I can’t confirm or deny that in case a gifted, politically well-connected, and wealthy 16-year-old who think we are interesting is reading this instead of just the CIA, shield or who knows who else.
Anthony: I am all rested out. Four days in the middle of Appalachia will do that to a guy. I kind of just want to hug my workbench right now.
Agent America: That's what happened. We received confirmation from S's former assistant. That action made her quit.
I think even when Tony was making weapons, it was about protecting people and not profiteering. When he realized that wasn't happening, he stopped and he found a new way to protect people. Ultron happened because he wanted to protect people. Unfortunately that went badly, but his heart was in the right place. We just have to work on execution.
“When do I get to tell Ned that you’re gay and want to climb Peter like a tree?” MJ whispered as she showed her phone to Flash.
“Well, considering we both had multiple near-death experiences asking us what we would regret not saying before we go, would be a really bad question to discuss. It’s not something I want to think about.” Tony finally acknowledged.
“Yes, although I forgot that Simmons would be here this time,” Leo lamented. “I didn’t calculate for that.”
Anthony: All bad things. Which we are not talking about because this is a work/Hydra/’Siberia issues’ free zone for the rest of the night.
Me: I’m starting to maybe like Yo-Yo. I definitely need more people in my life that don’t take bullshit from anybody. I also think this is a disaster waiting to happen. But thanks to her one woman campaign against various Colombian drug lords, it is probably best for my new teammate to be under the protection of the Stark lawyers.
“Biology means very little. Howard wasn’t a good father. The best thing I can say about him is he never hit me. Mom tried her best. However, Jarvis and Ana really raised me along with Aunt Peggy and Uncle Daniel. They were my family. I know they felt the same way about me.”
We are in the bad timeline for one more chapter. We switch over to the other timeline for conversation 35.
If you want to go over the other timeline's answers, start with conversation 58 of I hope you have Unlimited text messaging. It really took forever to get through those questions. Direct quotes are italicized. I did try to paraphrase whenever possible.
Me: The details of that are too classified for this conversation, especially because Agent Scary and Agent Agent warned me that less benevolent individuals are trying to find my cuddle bunny to use him against me.
“Especially me because apparently, I had an untreated adjustment disorder.” And his reaction to the divorce request is making him realize that he probably still has an untreated adjustment disorder.
TMNS: Yes, considering you don’t call me Penis [redacted] anymore. Although that name has taken on a different context. I’m starting to think the first time it was a Freudian slip, and you tried to pass it off as an insult.
“You did listen to Hunter,” Leopold responded to his counterpart. “The princess did not which, is why we’re locked in here.” That wasn’t quite it.
Counselor Laura: You’re going to have to ask Steve about that. Ask him if he has any family in Nevada.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You all are absolutely lovely. I’m still in the middle of moving but because I had to work Friday, I decided to make good use of my lunch break, so you’re getting this today.
“Okay keep it as it is, except delete the curse word.” Steve agreed reluctantly. “Also, maybe include some more positive things.”
Me: I mean it's not like we can jump into bed together. Maybe being in different countries is a good thing because we have to focus on the emotional part of the relationship. As you know by being my friend for the last 30 years, I suck at the emotional part of relationships.
Me: In the category of things that are not making the news to keep everyone from panicking, Culver University has the distinct privilege of being the only university to have two faculty members transform into very large beings due to exposure to an unknown chemical.
Me: Nope, because I’m staying in Manhattan and working out of the new New York offices that will be in the tower formally known as Avengers Tower. Which is good because I don’t want to live on top of Alchemax’s new New York offices. Thankfully, the computer geniuses intervened.
FRIDAY: He asked me to do a background check on your former lover. The image I found of Melinda Garner matched that of Agent Melinda May of SHIELD. She confirmed this information to Mr. Stark eventually.
“Does Morgan need another story? She’s already had three.” Morgan didn’t want him to leave. Although he adored Tony’s daughter, he also needed sleep. Which seems weird. He’s gone for days without sleep because of missions. However, a full day around Tony has mentally exhausted him in a completely different way.
Anthony: Which I’m really sad about especially because I'm going to be spending Friday night on a fake date with my boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend so the media will not think I’m pining over my ex-girlfriend while I’m forced to spend quality time with my ex-girlfriend/boss and her trophy boyfriend. Did I mention I'm going to have to do this sober?
Anthony: Surprisingly more of a kidnapping risk then as my fake boyfriend due to coming back from the dead by means that are too sensitive to discuss even under this encrypted frequency. Really, it's the entire reason why he is still legally dead.
Anthony love: When we are not briefing the president. How do you feel about redirecting to the Playground? I feel like I can use some backup, and we kinda need a distraction.  Unfortunately, Mack and Yo-Yo are helping Sharon with a little something in San Francisco, so that leaves you.
StarkAE: That‘s going to be another fun conversation with Pepper. Friday, sweetheart, please find out who I need to fire for violating company social media policy.
Boss: And can you please order some new toys for Lila and Nate? And maybe some new games for Cooper?
: Nickname for friend and former chief of SI security Harold Hogan. Recently demoted due to incident in September 2016. Relationship currently very, very complicated because he is upset that Tony choose Steve over Ms. Potts despite the fact that the couple were already broken up for more than a year when Tony’s relationship began with Steve. Not to mention the fact she was already dating someone else.
Me: Yes. He kept saying no but Patches convinced him to play along. Of course, he decided to do this before he found out his kid is the type of person he Watchdogs want to kill for the purity of mankind.
Steve: We've known each other for over a decade. You know that I do. You were there with me when I tried to put Barbie's dream house together. I cursed like the Army man that I am.
Anthony: I realize that now. If I need to hideout, I have my own sovereign nation island. But no, nothing like that.
Hunter: Did you know that other me is sleeping with other Simmons? Apparently, they have an arrangement.
Me: I’m ready to wear it. That’s also why I gave the compass to you. I’m ready to let go of the past completely and make a future with you. I want to be your husband.
Me: You really have to stop assuming that any time I don’t respond to you immediately, I’ve been kidnapped by Ross.
Me: I don’t think it’s possible to get used to the yearly apocalypse. I would be worried if you ever did.
Kitty brother: I am well aware that you’re an adult on a mission, but you still need to rest. At a minimum, please eat something and take a nap.
“I’m ashamed of what I did to both of you. And please don’t say it was all your fault because it wasn’t. I acknowledge now that I never dealt with my parents' death. Hell, I never dealt with Anna‘s death or Jarvis', not until therapy, and it’s still a work in progress. A lot of those issues just came out in Siberia. Because all my coping strategies pre-therapy were bad.”
So, in my universe, James Leopold a.k.a. Leo Fitz comes from Earth 199999. The idea reality where the TV and movies played together, and everything makes sense. (It's not their fault that the Russo brothers told nobody what they were doing, even the Far from Home team were in the dark 90% of the time). The new timeline created when Leo went back in time will be referred to as Earth 199998. I’m still trying to come up with a number to give to Deke’s reality since Earth 2091 has been taken.
Because I realize the alternative text is only coming up for those of us using screen readers, I’ve added it below:
Counselor Laura: I’ve seen stuff like this before. I’ve had more than one kid come into my office blaming themselves for their friend’s or parent’s death even if cancer was the real culprit. And I have others who start engaging in high-risk behavior because their guilt has convinced them that they are unworthy of living. I was worried about them and now I’m worried about you because you’re engaging in the same behaviors.
I think [redacted] has a crush on Friday. Should I be concerned? They talk a lot more than he does to Karen. I know you got rid of the Coulson AI because he asked, but I kind of like Karen a little better. She’s okay with me talking about MJ. Not that I talk about MJ a lot but she is cool. You know what I’m going to end this conversation before you take away my email privileges.
Me: You do actually know what coffee means? I’m impressed. I can’t wait to get some with you and only you.
“That’s just so you to send an apology gift. You have a regular vendor for that?” Steve asked, surprised.
“Actually, both of us have originating classification authorities and can classify any piece of information without consulting the Director, the Deputy Director or senior Agent Coulson, which is what I did in this case,” Fitz argued. Leo really wished she would leave the room at this point. Simmons was making her furious face. He knew that face too well.
: refers to Secretary of State Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross. Commonly used nickname in the US for the Secretary of State. Not to be confused with CIA Ross aka “Evan” Ross (Everett Kenneth Ross whom Stark occasionally miss names and refers to as “poor man’s Coulson”.)
The Big Boss: Obviously they didn’t read their email. Actually, I’m not sure if some of them can actually open their email.
Venom: We still need to talk about him being Spider-Man first. Which won’t be that hard since we're going to be sharing a room at the Lighthouse as soon as I’m freed from medical. Which will apparently happen once the all-hands meeting is over on deck 52.
Tony: That would not be my aim. Okay, now I wouldn’t have been going for that because I see the flaws in the Accords as is. And the Watchdogs are still out there regardless of everything. But I feel like maybe if we laid all our cards on the table before hand, things would’ve been better. At least nobody would’ve ended up in the Raft.
On March 24, 2018, three monoliths that control space, time, and creation were destroyed by a bomb. It was presumed that Leo Fitz died during the explosion. Instead, he was transported 22 months into the past. Due to his attempt to prevent the destruction of the earth, he created an alternate timeline that apparently, I come from.
Venom: Sufficiently advanced scientific Technology is indistinguishable from magic or something like that?
Me: True. However, I must admit that when I call the board, I do rehearse or at least plan, now, what I’m going to say because Pepper would kill me. Even then, the calls don’t always go well.
Red spider You never explained why you separated again. Steve just got a text from his fiancée one day in September, letting him know that you were taking over the Malibu house for a while.
This conversation takes place about a day after the last one. See, we won’t be spending nine or 10 conversations on the same day. Tony is in a meeting which means he is text messaging Steve again. It’s been so long I had to go back and look to see what conversation we were on.
“You’re only losing a day because of Ross coming. It doesn’t matter in the long run, because if this scheme works, then you two will be able to see each other regularly."
HSBF: So do I. You did well. Although I do think the story you made up about making out in the rain on top of the roof of the tower is a little bit much. You could’ve said something about feeding me pancakes in bed. We actually did that.
Me: Better-ish, they’re talking this week. There’s even been hand holding and kissing. It helps that the ATCU is going to have a New York office that Laura can be based at, even though she’s going to be working out of the compound.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. This was originally the second half of IP 11. However, I decided to split the chapter in 2 because half of the original version of the chapter took place before conversation 70 and the other half took place after. I felt it was less confusing this way.
"Oh," he said and sat back down at the table opposite Bruce. He grabbed a stylus again and began toying with it. "Guess it would have been beneficial to pay attention to what Cap or the Spy Twins were saying."
But Steve just kept talking. "The Winter Soldier killed your parents. Bucky didn't. Bucky would never… It was Hydra, Tony, and if it takes me until my dying day, I will root out every single Hydra cell and lay every single one of them to waste, to avenge Bucky, to avenge your parents, to avenge everyone whose lives they destroyed.
He took the tissue from her and followed her advice, and once he'd gotten hold of his emotions again, he glared down at his abdomen and said, "This is all your fault!"
"What do we do?" Natasha asked, and Steve closed his eyes almost like the decision pained him to say.
"He has good taste then," Steve said and bent his head to brush their lips together. "Feeling better?" he asked after he'd pecked a gentle kiss to Tony's mouth.
"—because, what, the city wouldn't pay for a new stadium? What was wrong with the old one? It was fine, last I saw it. Better than those bums deserved."
"Yeah, that," Barnes said then continued, "But I knew when he found 'the one' for him, he'd… make an exception. You're that exception." And then he paused a moment before he added, "He spoils you."
He looked at his computer, and he was silent a moment before he added, "I can get into a lot of trouble for this, but—" He reached out and turned the monitor toward them so they could see it. "Is all the information as shown correct?"
Steve stared down at Tony's earnest concern — at those gorgeous brown eyes with the wrinkles at the corners and messy, dark hair that was beginning to see a small invasion of silver at the temples, at the neatly-groomed van dyke that Steve had no proof of but was pretty sure Tony touched up here and there with hair dye.
decide if you're too for me? I mean, trust me, you're not, but seriously, my decision. And look, we have a lot in common. We like to do a lot of things together—"
Barnes was sitting quietly at the table, and Tony watched as Steve fought with himself over something before he said a quiet, "Buck—"
Steve hedged and, forgetting what Tony had just said, put his hands to his shoulders and squeezed them a bit, the effect making Tony jump a little bit as the material of the dress pulled against where it was taped to his skin from shoulder to breast.
"Our marriage? That sounds strange to say. I keep thinking Colonel Phillips is going to pop up from the back seat and have me discharged on the spot."
He shrugged. "I don't know. I guess maybe I thought it would come to me as soon as we got here, but right now, all I really want is…a shower."
, Nat and Pepper and Hill put up with this shit on a regular basis. I have, like, one night of it, and I'm ready to lead a rally or join the cause. I honest-to-god— I mean, it's really got me reevaluating
As Tony went about compiling the ingredients for French toast, Steve watched him a moment then said, "If you want, I could make it for a change."
JARVIS didn't respond to that, instead preferring to strike up the seasonal tunes with Bing Crosby's version of 'White Christmas' — the remake he'd done after the war, not the one Steve had spent the war holiday seasons listening to. It was close, but not quite the same, and honestly, Steve preferred the original version. Not because it was the one that reminded him of the past but because he just thought it was better.
him — not necessarily as a lover but as a person in general. He could take lusting after the Captain from afar so long as that's all it was and he knew and understood there was no chance of it ever progressing beyond that.
"You will more than understand in due time," she said, and Steve moved to step in between them as she reached out to touch his face again.
Her grin broadened, almost like she was laughing at him. "But then he'd be in that form permanently. And much as he enjoys the perks that come with his more feminine form—" she stole a glance at Tony, "—I'm not certain he's at the point where he would like to remain that way forever. Not yet, anyway."
"I'm just saying," Tony said and followed suit. Of course, where Steve was able to exit the car with ease, Tony had to fight it a bit, and he grumbled and struggled before he was finally able to get himself out of the car. He huffed and straightened out his clothes then shut the door and went over to the trunk where Steve was pulling out their bags. "I'm just saying
It really was a gorgeous setup Tony had constructed for him, and he'd been itching to get back to doing some art for himself. Sketching, painting — something to take his mind off of the concerns of the world for just a little while. It was his first love, after all. Soldiering was something he'd taken up because there was a war on, not because he wanted to do that for the rest of his life, and he had currently lucked into a situation that allowed for him to spend his spare time with pencils and paints. Maybe, if he was really good, it wouldn't have to be just his 'spare time' for the rest of his life.
"I'm starting to wonder about you boys myself," Natasha said, her tone smooth and even. She set the brush inside the bottle of polish after she'd finished the last toe and began to blow on them, waving her hand over to help create a breeze effect.
"No!" he said quickly. "No! Not Steve! No, I told you. It's part of Nutsy's spell. I mean, it's not unique to my case. She does it to everyone."
Did they just want to go out that afternoon looking exactly as they did? No disguises, no trying to sneak around, no trying to throw people off the scent. Did he want them to go out — to an
"Was that OK?" Steve asked, and Tony rolled his head and just looked at Steve, blinking dumbly at the nervousness he saw reflected back at him.
Barnes put a hand up to head him off at the pass. "I told you, Steve. I'm not— I don't even know if I'd
So, Wilson was taking it in stride as best he could, but Tony knew that was only because he was building up an arsenal to unleash in the event that Barnes ever became an active and known member of the Avengers. And Tony knew Wilson would do whatever it took to get Barnes to that point — even if only so he could use some lame-as-fuck 'Six Million Dollar Man' manip once in a tweet no one under forty would even understand.
"You were brilliant, you know," the agent continued, evidently changing tactics somewhat. "You changed the world. You still could. You really want to give it up for this bunch of freaks? Even if they did trust you, what can they offer you? They're on their way out. Their leader's dead. They'll scatter like rats, and you'll be branded the same as your beloved little Natalia — a traitor to the very organization that made you."
She pointed at the admittedly barren walls. "Daddy's pitchers. He has pitchers that he did of all the Avengers 'nd some other things like trees and skyscrapers. Did he sell them?"
The table went quiet again at that — even little noisemaker Olivia keeping silent as she watched the adults — and as Steve shook his head, unsure of what even to say, Jim let out a mournful, "Man, I coulda been home in Philly eating pumpkin pie."
Tony glanced up at him. "Let me put it this way: I know what to do with my daughter because I know firsthand what you're
Tony just shot him a perplexed look, which was matched by half the table, and Hill said, "I wasn't sure how…comfortable you two are with the whole…" She made one of those 'leading' motions with her hand, like she was trying to buy time or draw the word out of someone else. When no one spoke up, she cleared her throat and added, "Parents-to-be…thing."
"Oh," he said and carefully ran his hands from his breasts down and over his belly. "What do you think? Is it OK?"
Before Steve could say anything — like ask just what the hell language Tony was speaking — he was gone in what Steve presumed was the direction of the kitchen, and, licking his lips (he swore he could still taste Tony on him, though he didn't know quite how to describe it), he pushed into the living room.
Natasha, weirdly, stayed very quiet and kept her gaze averted, but Tony noticed something a little Mona Lisa-ish about the tiny smile on her face.
"When it comes to Tony Stark you sure as shit are. Always were." He whistled and added, "Could you imagine if Stark was as much of a creepy fucker as that Johann Schmidt was?"
Tony dropped his hands. "OK, well, I still expect to be given them." He looked at Wilson. "You! What'd you bring me back?"
"Nah, I'm going with Barton. You're spoiled as shit. No, you know what? I've changed my mind. It's you two. You know why? 'Cause somehow, the formerly brainwashed Soviet assassins are less codependent on each other than the super soldier and the billionaire."
"Indeed," Thor said, stepping in between them like even he knew Steve might very well try to take her head off. "You did not appear... enthusiastic about my offer to spend your days on Asgard after your loved ones depart—"
"What have I told you? Bad luck," he said before Tony could get his full thought out, and he groaned and rolled his eyes.
He sighed and looked at his mess, and he thought about cleaning it up but decided against it because he just couldn't be bothered, and he dumped the used cutting board and tenderizer into the sink and set the bag back in the cupboard and said, "Wait, why is it
"He doesn't really think we're that gross," Tony said and looked up at Steve, chin resting on a pectoral. "He thinks we're disgustingly cute, though."
He put his other hand on top of Steve's so that Steve's hand was sandwiched in between his hands, and they stayed like that a moment, neither one saying or doing anything but staring down at Tony's abdomen, and Steve was the one to finally break the silence by saying, "You know, if we really want to make that appointment, we'd better leave now."
Steve, weak man that he was, just fixated on the way Tony's breasts bounced as he slammed his hands on the table and made his demand. Though he was and had always been attracted to both men and women, he'd always thought himself maybe just a little more attracted to men. But seeing Tony, female, naked, and standing there before him was upending all of his previously established conventional wisdom. At that moment, he thought he'd never seen anyone or anything more attractive than Tony Stark with soft curves and long hair and generous breasts, and he swallowed and wiped his suddenly sweaty palms on the uniform pants he'd yet to change out of, the material suddenly much too tight and much too stifling for comfort.
" He snorted a bitter laugh. "Don't worry. I'll make it easy for you." He turned on his heel and marched back to the car, gravel crunching under his sneakers.
"If I did," he said, shifting his gaze to focus on something to the side of her elbow, "I wouldn't..." He swallowed. "I'm of more use like this."
Tony just blinked, seemingly not seeing anything wrong with this. "Yeah. You are. You're my old man. Just like Olivia's my baby girl. I'm not seeing how that's bad or—"
Pepper was probably the first relationship he'd had where he'd found it was OK not to have to fill every single moment of interaction with someone with noise of some kind. Well, maybe Rhodey, but that was a different kind of relationship entirely. Plus, he'd known and been friends with Rhodey for well over half his life, so there existed a familiarity and an understanding already. No, they didn't always have to talk. They could hang and just watch TV or stuff their faces or play video games and not have to spend the entire time talking to each other (unless it was smack-talk as they battled each other over whatever-the-fuck shoot-'em-up game Rhodey had brought with him this time).
"No! Not if you're going to hurt yourself." And then he rubbed the back of his neck and said, "I mean, maybe I'd want to watch you…
"Huh? Hey, could you hand me that pillow?" he asked and nodded his head at the pillow carelessly tossed on the adjacent chair.
"Thank you, Papa," she said and took the mug from him, putting both hands around it as she brought it to her mouth and began to drink, the excess dribbling down the sides of her mouth.
"Turns out she has that reputation back at home, too," Bruce said with a genial chuckle. And then, because if there
But Thor just stepped over to where Steve was unwrapping the highchair's parts from their packaging. "It may sound poetic to your ear, but that does not make it untrue. It is your bond with your beloved. It cannot be undone. Your flirtations with the Captain is merely the way it manifests itself." And then, before Tony or anyone could say anything to him, he pointed to the scattered parts and said, "Might I lend you a hand with that, Steven?"
you. Doesn't your kind have a saying about not looking a gift horse in the mouth? Stupid expression, but I think it fits here."
"Nothing," Natasha replied. "Let him cool off. He's not trying to hurt you. He thinks he's doing the right thing. And you know how he gets when he thinks he's doing the right thing."
"But the point is you're so protective of her and, well, honestly, you're her primary caregiver. And I figured you would...want to...be a stay-at-home dad."
the same as, oh, the same kind of magic you kind of rope in with bullshit superstition like dropped knives and throwing salt over your shoulder and knocking on wood and not stepping on cracks and—"
"OK, now you're just being deliberately obtuse. Stark-Rogers. We went with Stark-Rogers. It sounds better. Rolls off the tongue."
King Howard had ruled over these lands for over twenty years before producing a viable, legitimate heir. There were bastards, of course. Howard was a strikingly handsome man with sharp eyes and a wicked smile, traits that had found their way into his only son. But none of these bastards could ever lay claim to the throne, as they had been born of affairs with mistresses or whores and not a virtuous and pious queen. Howard, in fact, did not himself take a queen until he was nearly fifty years of age, and then it was two miscarriages and a stillbirth before Anthony was even born. Quite possibly, if not for Anthony, there would have been no legitimate line of succession, and the kingdom would have fallen into disarray with no anointed ruler.
Bruce shrugged. "Surgery's the only way I can think of— And I am not a surgeon, Tony! I am not performing surgery on you!"
Tony got up and moved over to another worktable. "Before? When I asked if you wanted to join me in the shower, and you looked like you'd rather go up against an entire Hydra battalion by yourself?"
" Tony sputtered then looked from Rhodey to Bruce and then to his disappearing fiancé, who was gnashing his teeth together, his jaw doing that thing it did whenever something was really pissing him off.
"Jerk," he muttered but still weaved his way out of the line and went over to the last empty table he could find. He sat down, twitching his nose at some smears of ketchup (he hoped it was ketchup) that were left on the table and dug through his bag again for his phone. He pulled it out and checked for any new messages since the last time he'd looked at it and saw there was one.
"Sass-bot," Tony muttered. He leaned against the rear wall of the car and folded his arms, waiting the few moments it took to arrive at the designated floor, wondering if he was craving more red sauce or Alfredo. He'd say why not both, but he didn't want to be a glutton, even if Steve would gladly polish off what he couldn't or didn't. And if Steve didn't, there was always his merry band of pranksters.
Tony just rolled his eyes, and Steve asked, "You sure you don't need help with that?" as Wilson made his way to the door.
"I was telling Pepper about how James and I are getting married in the atrium, and I was telling her how beautiful it was, and she's been looking at venues for her upcoming wedding with Happy—" She directed a knowing look at Bucky. "—who's head of security," she said, her tone leading.
But Steve let his guard down at one point, and that's when Tony took his chance to sneak out and make his way down to his lab. The lights came on upon his arrival, though DUM-E, who normally wheeled over to him in greeting, stayed over at his charging station and merely raised his arm at Tony as though to inspect the intruder in the lab.
Tony rolled his eyes but made his way over the slightly overgrown slate path toward what he figured was supposed to be the back door to the place. "Hey, yeah, next question: How are we supposed to get in?"
Steve shook his head a little and offered Olivia the bottle, who greedily and happily took it, slurping down formula like it was the last time she'd ever have it. "No, just... Again, I think we should play to our strengths."
, like this? Like this body full-time? Since January. I mean, there was that week back in November, which is how this—" he patted his belly, "—happened." He pointed to someone towards the front. "You."
Other Tony reached up and scratched at his forehead. "Uh," he said, like he was trying to be a) casual and b) buy himself some time, "my mom had them. Her father had them. No idea why. Guess he was a big Captain America fan?"
"Hey!" he said, brightly, deliberately trying to change the subject. "Let's go pilfer some of Daddy's art supplies!"
cooking. Maybe it reminded him of Jarvis or of being a kid or some idealized happy memory, but he wasn't all that
He'd blamed Howard. For so long, deep down, he'd blamed Howard for killing his mother. For not watching where he was going. For maybe having a bit too much eggnog before he got behind the wheel. For being a dumbass and swerving to avoid something and not seeing the giant, fucking tree in the way. He'd blamed him. He'd blamed him for taking his mother away from him.
Granted, that was what Steve wanted to hear and probably needed to hear, but never one to leave well-enough alone, he instead frowned at Tony and said, "Are you sure? Tony, I— I took a lot of —"
He hummed and shrugged and put his hand up to where the one end of the towel was tucked in to keep it from falling down, holding it there so it didn't come undone. He watched as Pepper unzipped the garment bag and then pulled out the tasteful ensemble she'd chosen for the conference, shaking it out and holding it up and saying, "Will this do, Mr. Stark?"
"Yeah," he said but didn't elaborate. "Merry Christmas," he added and, one last image of 'Tony's' dark eyes and feathery black lashes flashing in his mind's eye, pushed every speck of memory from that dream from his mind. No sense dwelling over a fiction that would never happen, no matter how strangely painful it was to let go of.
"No?" Tony asked and looked at the tag on the box. "For Olivia," Tony said and looked down at Steve, who nodded and watched as Tony tore into the paper and tossed it aimlessly on the floor.
Steve raised an eyebrow and gave him a smug look. "So, you're saying I don't look like myself. I'm not recognizable."
Tony hummed a bit, and as the elevator 'dinged' to announce its arrival, he said, "Maybe we could fool around a
But he needed a grinder, too, for the beans, and so he went over to the space on the counter where that was usually kept.
Tony rolled his eyes, but Rhodey just reached out and put an arm around his shoulders and said, "Look, Tones, you're not alone. We'll all be out there right behind you — me and Steve and Pep and Nat. I mean, if we're all out there, they
Clint seemed perplexed, and he looked between the gelato container and Steve's face and sputtered before he said, "There's more than enough for two people there!"
"No. Not— Just— Just for this. Only if I put this collar on. Otherwise, you're still Tony — you're still
Tony shoved half the hash brown in his mouth. "I ghet ih, Stebe. Yowr sowwy. Y' don' hafta keep w'peatin' ih ev'ry time ah turn awound."
He went back to scanning through whatever it was he was looking at, and Tony finished off his cup of coffee and cut himself another generous bite of pancakes. He shoved it in his mouth and chewed, and he watched as Steve swiped through screens and information then said, "Well, if nothing else, at least the general reaction to last night appears to be positive."
"I'm fine, Happy. You don't need to stick around. And tell your new boss I'm not made of glass. I'll be OK."
He stifled a groan and stretched his back to work out some of the aches and kinks before he took her hand and led her over to the door.
"It's not what I want, honey. It's what you want," Steve said, arms folded, his shoulder propped against the doorjamb as Tony continued to stand naked in front of the bathroom mirror and inspect his decrepit body. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony caught him dipping his head some and looking almost a little bashful as he said, "If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: I love you no matter what, no matter which body you're in."
Steve will stubbornly insist until the day he dies that he's fifty-two years older than I am and that
Steve sighed a little and shrugged. "I don't know. Seems like beating a dead horse to complain about a ball team that ceased to exist in 1957."
As marriage ceremonies went, it was quick and painless if utilitarian in nature. Tony had always thought he'd throw a big catered affair if he were ever to get married — really just an excuse to have a big, huge, expensive bash that he could invite all his friends to — and maybe if things worked out the right way and Tony went back to being, well, the way he was, they could have a big affair sometime in the near future. As it was, they were stuck with the intimate little ceremony, which was nice, he supposed. It did what it was supposed to do, and it was nice that it was just Tony, Steve, and their friends…
"Fine," he said with a huffy sigh and looked at the clerk. "Got a room we can talk this out in?" He waved them around a corridor after he'd picked up the IDs that were still sitting on the desk.
Of course, there came time for the video, and Tony was unfortunately wide awake for that — unfortunately because it wasn't the horror show to him that it appeared to be to the rest of the class. Having had his chest hacked open in a cave in Afghanistan with only the barest of sedatives given to him certainly put a different perspective on things. It was hard to see something that had been going on for thousands upon thousands of years as any more horrifying than, well,
he could open his mouth and offer to do something that might lead to him, someday, maybe, somewhere down the road, having a life very similar to that other Tony's life: married to a super soldier, father to a precocious, talkative four-year-old that only ate the cheese off her pizza and liked to draw and tell stories.
But he'd grown tired of pretending. He didn't want to pretend any longer. He'd stopped having to pretend so much once Iron Man and then the Avengers had come to pass. He'd become the hero he'd always hoped he could be deep down — the kind Howard had assured him he was never good enough for.
Tony glanced down and saw where his sheer-stockinged foot rested versus where Steve's leg was, and he figured he could probably swing the angle if he needed to. He wasn't sure how his ass would feel about it, but he could still swing the angle if needed. "Yes," he said as Steve continued to stroke his hair.
Because the Captain was just as righteous and mighty and cunning and brilliant as he'd been made out to be all those years ago. And, as it turned out, the pictures and the newsreels didn't do the guy justice at all. He was fucking
"Always," Steve said without hesitation, and Tony just hummed and said, "Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, given that
Still, he'd been stuck sitting on a floor having to listen to shit he could totally have just had JARVIS pull up for him, and they had pissed the day away at the beach.
Unless, of course, Tony Stark's 'family' had never cared much for him in the first place and was glad he was gone.
"It's not a kink," Steve said, almost like he was going on offense so that Tony didn't get any ideas in his head. "I mean I don't— It's not because— It's not like seeing you in that lacy, uh,
Steve swallowed again, a red-hot flush flooding his cheeks, and Tony furrowed his brow and tilted his head in thought.
"Ah," Bucky said with a somewhat confused nod while Sam shook his head a little and said, "Man, that is a lot of pressure to put on a kid."
. But then you say he can't talk 'cuz the craziest ones are on his side. But then Daddy says you knew what you were gettin' into when you gots married. What's that mean, Papa?"
"Fuck you all," Tony declared as Rhodey took Olivia out of his arms and cradled her gently in his own. As he cooed at her and bounced her and then said a surprised, "Wow, you're a lot heavier than I thought you'd be," Tony turned to him and added, "And if you're going to follow the other lemmings, at least say 'queen.' I am a
"No, bullshit, something's over there. Something's got you spooked. Something—" He gasped and turned to look as well, even though Steve kept dragging him back up the road toward the cabin, dirt and gravel crunching beneath their sneakers. "Fuck! Fuck, I knew it! What'd I tell you?"
"Depends on what you consider an 'arcade,'" she replied, and Barton rolled his eyes. "Not sure it was such a great idea to invest in a laser tag arena, though."
"Which makes sense considering she explicitly said it was something she got from you," Bruce said, but Tony ignored him and continued counting.
Sam exhaled a somewhat annoyed breath and sat back in his chair some. "Whatever you have to tell yourself, man."
He stepped onto the elevator when it opened its doors, and Steve hit the button for the floor they were staying on.
"It's corny as hell, but it's a holiday classic," Sam said. "Right up there with the Grinch and Charlie Brown."
"In answer to your question," he said and opened his eyes again to look at Bruce. "Yeah, sort of. I mean, I didn't tell him
He just smiled at her. He didn't know what else to do. "Yeah," he said, not wanting to rattle her small world too much. If he could hand her back to his other self without having broken her in any way, he'd chalk it up to a win for him. "Yeah, we do."
Steve sighed a little and rolled his eyes. There were times, especially when it came to his relationship with Tony, that he felt his friends more humored him than actually sympathized with him.
"Yeah, well, given that the power's still out and there's no open store to purchase formula at in the tri-state area, I don't really have much of a choice."
Tony screwed the cap on the bottle and turned back to Steve. "All right, I know I don't look like I gave birth to her four months ago, but trust me, I gave birth to that baby. She is a Stark."
Tony put his other hand up to match, ran both hands from his abdomen up to his breasts and then back again, and went over and climbed atop Steve, straddling him at his waist.
But Bruce just smiled at him and said, "Physically, you have all the attributes of a human female, and in that case, you are not the first human female to go through this. That doesn't mean you can't be scared or nervous. I guarantee you anyone going through this says they're not, they're lying through their teeth."
Steve glanced to where he had his arm blocking access to the elevator, and he frowned and dropped before he scratched at his forehead.
"Turn around," Steve said, and Tony followed his instructions, feeling the mattress hit against his knees. Steve touched his right leg and said, "Bend your knee. You need to get up on the bed."
"Yeah, but—" Steve began, rubbing his free hand over Tony's back and tightening his arms if that was at all possible, "—this is amazing. This is— This means so much to me, and I don't know how you did it, but…
But, god, did he ache, and he could tell he was wet and ready to be taken and halfway to orgasm already. God, this body! The things that…

To be honest, weather-wise, it was a miserable day. It was relatively warm for that time of year, but the gray clouds of morning had opened up by that afternoon, drenching the city in a torrent of rainfall with the occasional rumble of thunder overhead. Though the initial downpour had subsided, a steady sprinkling of droplets remained, and a quick check of the weather on Rhodey's phone showed a bright-green splotch covering the Doppler image, one that did not look like it was about to clear out any time soon.
Pepper just shook her head and led Tony back out onto the street, and they were just about to cross to the car waiting there when that same voice from inside the shop said, "Natasha Carbonell."
Tony glanced up and scowled at him, which lasted only a second before a certain aroma hit his nose, and he glared at Steve and said, "No."
"Agent Coulson says he is still drafting the report and will need to speak with Spidey before completing it. However, he will send you a copy once the preliminary analysis is ready in exchange for you not accessing the FBI database without authorization." The AI replied.
I was going to wait another week before posting while I wait for more chapters to come in, but since the last two chapters have not been part of the main story, I decided to go ahead and post this one. However, on there will be at least a two week wait for the next one.
Anthony love: Because Laura was kidnapped from the compound, we are relocating to the lighthouse for the moment. The Princess is coming.
Tony: Actually, Coulson’s team came across someone with that power. When he touched somebody they would see how somebody else was going to die. Allegedly Skye Quake saw her boyfriend saving the world in a prophecy vision and I don’t want to see that. I don’t want to know how you’re going to die. I’m still hoping that the vision from Wanda was just a mind fuck sort of thing and not a vision of the future.
“OK, maybe not that far but in a stable relationship. I mean, you’re already married to someone else.”

“Is it easier knowing that there’s a version of us that went through Siberia and eventually overcame that?” Steve asked.
Cuddle bunny: If the bomb was detonated, most of the EU would have been exposed and transformed. If the winds were right there was a 72% probability that the gas could have triggered mutation as far as the northern border of Wakanda.
Counselor Laura: I think Leo convinced Friday that for the good of mankind, you and Steve needed to be on speaking terms. Although she may have eventually went full Emma.
tell you, not if I don't want to fuck things up for both of us, and being that I think we're both pretty fucking happy with where things are with us right now, I really don't want to fuck things up for us, and my Steve would kill both of us if we allowed that to happen.
He clamped his mouth shut and shook his head, and when he next started talking, it was as though he had changed the subject.
"Yeah, no, I'm not exaggerating. Three most popular things on the internet. But it's kind of like the wire service — you know how you're always connected to the wire service? It's like that but a massive group of people are sending out information and messages at the same time, and they're all talking to each other, and you interface with a computer— er, a television screen. Text and pictures. Videos. Audio. It's… It's really amazing when you get down to it. Everything's done on the internet now. Which is both good and bad. Unfortunately, everyone seems to think they're entitled to their fifteen minutes of fame now, and with the internet, well…"
Thankfully, the kid did most of the work for him, though with her now on his lap, it did make trying to work on the armor upgrades a bit tricky. A lot tricky. Look, he was fine burning himself on solder, but he wasn't about to chance burning a four-year-old.
"Jeez, they're kind of ugly when they first come out, aren't they?" Barnes mused, tilting his head as he looked down at the squawking baby on Tony's abdomen, and Natasha scowled and swatted at him before she turned gentler, softer eyes back on Tony.
As she took hold of Steve's license and began to inspect it, Tony slapped his own forms of ID in front of her.
"I mean it really would be good for learning new ways of using our powers and abilities," Bruce added because evidently there was something in the water these people were drinking.
Steve, however, didn't seem to notice anything wrong, and he went over and bent down where Tony sat on the couch and kissed Tony's forehead. "Hey there, sleepyhead," he said. "Feeling better?"
Steve just smiled a little and shook his head then pointed at Tony's plate and said, "I'm not going to tell you again. Eat."
The Hydra agent went to say something, but Tony didn't care to listen. He just blasted the fucker back into the wall.
"I overheard Stane tell you that no one wanted some 'fag freak' running the company and how he couldn't believe that someone with my debts wasn't with you just for the money. I know you always trusted Stane, you looked up to him, and I noticed after that that you…seemed a little closed-off to me, like you were trying to figure out if maybe he was right. I didn't ever want you to think there was even a possibility that he could be, and so I…"
Tony stood there on the side of the road and watched as the distance between them grew, and he rubbed his belly and wondered if the little voice that warned him that Steve might very well have to make a choice between them soon was just the product of decades' worth of insecurity cropping up at an inopportune time.
Another shot fired off at someone trying to take off on a motorcycle. "Because clearly you're delirious, and you're hearing things in your delirium."
"I'm OK, by the way. You don't have to stick around if you don't want to. You have bigger fish to fry."
"And people think I'm the possessive one," Steve murmured, but he just reached up and covered one of Tony's hand's with his own.
-kissing was just gross — Cap met his eyes and, with the woman from the other side of the portal warning him yet again, said, "I always wanted to learn how to dance. Teach me how to dance."
"It's… I don't know what it is, really. I mean I'm happy—" He looked up at Tony quickly. "Don't get me wrong! I'm happy here. With you and the team and…the future's
The man swung the little girl into his arms and turned to Steve. "You know, there's a part of me that wishes Wilson hadn't done that. If these two ever get separated, I won't know how not to take it as a bad sign."
"Yeah, people have a lot of misconceptions about our relationship. But I'm serious, Steve. I'm not letting you go without a fight, and god forbid
Steve's mouth parted into a small, tender smile, his entire face softening to gentle understanding. "It's a boy."
He thought it might be difficult to get Steve to show up later that afternoon when the festivities were slated to begin, but there he was in a tight pair of jeans and an even tighter t-shirt, smiling and thanking all the attendees for their well-wishes as he ambled through the crowd. He ducked out of the way of a silver star that was hanging just a little too low from the ceiling and pushed his way over to Tony, folding his arms as he looked down at him and said, "Happy?"
"No," Tony replied and went over to a cupboard to grab a bowl. "But he won't be back for a while. I've got time to figure it out."
Thor's face had gone pale, and he swallowed and sat forward. "Are you certain that's what she said?"
"Lucky Strike means fine tobacco," Steve replied. "Call for Phillip Morris. No, they didn't have that stuff back in my day."
will catch your attention." He scooted over to the edge of the bed and took a deep breath before he summoned the strength to fight to get up. Steve watched him for all of a moment before he walked over and took hold of Tony's arms to help him up.
"That fella keeps talking like some old-timey street urchin from Hollywood's version the Lower East Side, I might."
He shrugged and picked at the duvet. "Tried to call me a few times. I wouldn't let JARVIS put him through."
He looked down at his belly, covered by the thin, colorful material of the teddy, and he put his hands there and rubbed it.
Me: Consider it one of the nice things about being Tony Stark. Everyone sends me screeners, which makes up for the fact that I can’t watch a movie without renting out the theater outside of a premier. Even then, there’s paparazzi everywhere. Tell birdbrain that I’m not sleeping with his wife, no matter what Christina Everhart says.
Tony Potts: I don’t want to know exactly what Steve told other me because I want this Steve to tell me those things. I don’t want to cheat. I want him to trust me enough to open up.
Counselor Laura: You know, I’m personally surprised that you’re still responding. It’s not nice having your husband avoid you for a week. I’m proud this conversation has lasted this long.
HSBF: That makes no sense. All he did here was worry about his kids and Laura when he was around. I’ve seen the man almost on the verge of tears every time he was reminded of them. He loves those kids. He loves Laura.
Me: Does Tony know that yet? He Joked about Friday wanting a body but I assume he would be wary after what happened last time.
Counselor Laura: Yet he’s here, and he says he’s from five years in the future. Is this Leopold all over again?
Me: Spidey Senior needs me and it gives Afia a chance to see how she blends in with teenagers that are not royalty. Actually, the princess is going to be there. She wanted to stay until Friday to experience the American concept of Thanksgiving. But her brother said no. So she’s flying back in the morning after the meeting with Jane.
Friday: Please listen to the song I Just Want You to Know by the Backstreet Boys to understand the sentiment behind the words that I am not allowed to forward to you.
Me: OK, cuddle bunny, are you jealous of the fact that Aunt Peggy moved on and found the love of her life in someone else?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all so fabulous. I am giving you more things to read while you are social distancing.
Me: Now you’re going to make me cry and I was having such a happy day celebrating Ross’s resignation.
"Because he has done the same for me more times than I can count. I have done some very fucked up things over the years. The majority of which were definitely immoral and probably illegal and he always saved my ass."
Purple Princess: It works better when there’s a human with her. AI’s are great at what we do, but the human brain is different. You see things we don’t.
Also, I want to lock the entire Fitzsimmons-Hunter family in a room together until they work out all of their bull shit. It’s either that or send them to the other side of the country because I just can’t deal with them. I want to punch somebody, but that would be inappropriate. I’m going to sleep.
“I think there’s a difference when it’s a terminal illness. I always thought I was going to die young, so I wanted to make the most out of every moment so I wouldn’t have any regrets.” Steve confessed. Tony had no idea he felt that way.
Anthony: One of my favorite things to do growing up was just to hang out with her. No expectations. She just liked spending time with me. I missed it when she was gone, even after I got shipped off to boarding school.
May: It was worse the second time. Because I know Phil is not going to come back. I stood there while they cremated his body and spread his ashes in the ocean. We went to Tahiti. I didn’t want to leave, but Steve brought Robin and me home. Even though he was falling apart because Tony was still MIA. Steve offered to marry me when the government tried to take Robin away from me. The DOD wouldn’t dare take Captain America’s daughter. He helped me keep my family together.
“See, we should’ve had this conversation in April. Because I knew what he did to Bruce too and that was the reason why I felt like I needed to sign on, or one of the reasons. Dr. Banner and Mr. Hulk could defend himself against General Asshole. Ms. Marvelous and Spidey Jr., not so much. Especially with the asshole father. I had to be at the table to help them.”  Steve decided it was best not to ask too much about that at the moment, despite overhearing most of the email that Tony dictated to Rio Morales earlier. Even being in the bathroom getting dressed, thanks to super hearing, Steve could hear everything and he means everything.
He yelled at JARVIS to change the station before the movie ended. He knew these particular movies being played at this precise moment was just a coincidence, but it was a hell of a coincidence considering. As, he was sure, was the fact that the channel JARVIS changed it to was showing
Thor just stared at Tony, perplexed like he'd just spoken a completely foreign language that even Thor couldn't decipher, and he shook his head a little and said, "When do we commence with the opening of presents? I've most been looking forward to this Midgardian tradition."
Steve frowned at him, a little sad-eyed, and went to say something, but Tony put his hand up as though to say he didn't want to hear it or he didn't care or some combination of the two, and Steve clamped his mouth shut again.
But Steve took a breath, and the Snickers bar going soft in his warm hand, even through the wrapper, he stepped closer to Tony and shook his head ever-so-slightly.
"Olivia," Tony said without thinking. He tilted his head in a little bit of confusion as the Cap startled and stared at Tony either like he'd seen a ghost or like he was trying to make sure he'd heard what he thought he'd heard. But then he blinked and shook his head, almost as though he was trying to clear his thoughts of something.
She shrugged again and turned back to Thor. "Any reason in particular for summoning me? I do have quite the schedule to keep. So many poor, lost souls in need of help."
Because Steve had said that no, he wasn't going to let him die and they were going to get through this
Tony rolled his eyes as Rhodey's phone began to dial Pepper, and Rhodey, rather than handing the phone over, held it up to Tony's ear so that he could ear.
As Barnes made one of those faces like he couldn't believe what he'd gotten himself into, Wilson and Barton exchanged looks, and Barton turned to Tony and said, "Wait, why is this the first I'm hearing about this?"
The water shut off, and Steve shoved the ring back on his finger and made a dash to what he hoped was the exit. He pulled open the door and found himself in a hallway, another door ahead of him, three more doors surrounding, and a staircase beside him. Wherever he was, the mock-up was pretty good. It looked like a house — a pretty nice house, if he was being honest. Of course, anything was better than his one-room shack.
"How're you feeling?" Natasha asked and perched on the table beside him, DUM-E pushing a little balled up piece of paper back and forth on the table like he was mesmerized by how it rolled.
They watched a couple movies while Olivia napped, the one that had been on when he'd first come downstairs that morning about a kid that desperately wanted a BB gun (and he was inclined to agree that the dumb kid would just shoot his eye out with it) as well as a more recent one about a giant, overgrown elf that included a character that, according to Tony, looked exactly like Happy, whoever that was. He liked the one with the kid more, if only because it was clearly trying to ape the time that he himself came from, though there were certain details about it that were a little off, and Tony seemed to get a gigantic kick out of that every time he pointed it out.
Me: Talking to me right now is technically against the Accords but you’re still doing it. More importantly, shield is letting you do it.
Me: At least Kimball is nice, usually. I may have to do Fallon as well next week. It depends on how things blow over. Or if the board actually does try to make me undergo an involuntary psych evaluation. The good news is most people like Stefan except for the diehard Pepperony shippers and the homophobic.
FRIDAY: The SHIELD report regarding the investigation of her death was never digitized, but I think I have a way to get the report.
The “me” in this chapter is Agent May. Steve must check in with his friend that almost died a few days earlier.
Anthony: I still have dreams about dying, just not like that anymore. In my new dreams, I'm in the car with my parents when you know what happens. I usually get to watch both of them die before I wake up.
"I didn’t say yes." Tony said taking the seat beside Steve. “Especially because I’m sure the asshole who suggested it is golf buddies with Ross.”
“No promises. How is Coulson?” May asked Steve, but before he could answer a holographic image of Ana popped up. Yes, he created Ana a holographic body because maybe this way she won’t try to talk a certain genius into making her an actual body. He was already raising one synthetic teenager along with having temporary custody of Spidey Junior, while his family was in Puerto Rico dealing with the relief efforts and the new team. (Plus, co-parenting Peter with May.) That was enough at the moment.
Anthony love: You know what just hurry home so I can explain all the stuff in person and maybe we can have stress release sex. That would be nice.
Me: I hope it’s not another alien invasion, at least not one that is more than two blue guys crashing in Utah. I hate the board.
May: Enjoy your time with the kids, and I’ll see if Kamala will be okay if you stop by the school for a few minutes.
Tony: It’s fine. He doesn’t want to kill people which made him a bad fit for Shield and the normal Avengers but a perfect partner for TMNS who is still traumatized by his uncles’ murder and does not want to ever have blood on his hands. They might be good for each other.
Red phone: It’s not good for a high school guidance counselor/child psychologist to have a government stalker. It scares the kids.
“Yes. May wants us to divorce after we bring everybody back. She actually said that to me in a text message this morning.” Okay, Tony wasn’t expecting Steve to say that.
Football Hunter: You’re receiving an eight-figure salary plus royalties. They always come back when there’s money. That’s the only time they care to come back.
FF dot net still does not allow for Graphics, so I’m using the text descriptors but in reality they did use the emojis.
“Then I want Happy and Peter. If operation keep away works, we are having the world's biggest party afterward. It will be a barbecue at the lake. And it will be glorious.” Tony wants that so badly.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. This is another Spider-Man: Homecoming associated chapter. Of course, this probably did not happen in the movie. But the purpose of the story has always been to get inside the heads of our characters.
Additional notes: I also recently re-watched AOS episode 3.22 and realize that the writers engaged in rapid soap Opera aging syndrome when it came to Robin Huntington. She went from stroller size to seven years old in about a year and a half in universe. Because of the beauty of fanfiction, I’m going to correct that. So in this story Robin is 5 ½ years old and already has her powers.
Morgan’s dad: Sometimes, you need to be. It’s a skill I got from the business world. Still, I would like for you to answer the question.
Me: At least I know you’re in a country where you kind of know the language. I’m not surprised. The news has been Wakandan all the time for the last 24 hours. My friends at the State Department are more excited about future diplomatic relations with Wakanda than the fact that their boss will be leaving by the time the inauguration happens regardless of who wins the election.
“I don’t have to go back. Also, it’s not a spider problem. Thankfully, Benji is not in danger, mostly because Joey is a really good at spider sitting.”
“Following the Watchdog money trail and coming up with enough evidence to prove that Senator Nadir was consulting with a foreign government to commit terrorist acts on U.S. soil. Although, I don’t know if any more evidence is actually needed.”
Anthony: I haven’t even locked myself in the lab with 2 gallons of coffee, let alone with Jack, Jim, or José, either version. This is probably the healthiest way I’ve dealt with a major crisis ever.
Me: You’re right. Clint and Laura are trying to make sure I don’t totally screw up Afia or the other kids.
“Laura was the one who made the arrangement. She’s the one who is shield now. Clint is retiring, but now that it’s actually an agency again he’s going to get a pension.”
Tony: I mean, I’ve been working on something like that for the suit, but I’m not quite there. I was at least two more months out from having something fully ready.
Cuddle Bunny: Is Sharon mad at me? Maybe to the point of telling her bosses who your boyfriend really is?
“Would this be an appropriate time to let you know that Peter would like to schedule a pizza hang out day next weekend?” So he doesn’t have to be alone on the anniversary of his uncle’s death. And because Platypus was the only one who prevented him from overdosing on the one-year anniversary of his parents’ death, he feels like he needs to pay it forward.
We are on Avenger channels. Deputy Secretary of State James Rhodes’s code name is D. Which is actually a common nickname for the Deputy Secretary of State.
"I'll start. I was born in May 1970. My dad brought my mom red roses that she dried because he didn’t actually make it in time for my birth. He wasn’t around that much because work kept him away. Thankfully I had Ana and Jarvis, who were my other parents. At least until Hydra killed Ana. Not that I knew that until we got the data dump from the other timeline. I got sent to boarding school, which I understand now. I could've understood it back then if someone actually told me what the hell was going on. It was fine. I think I did better in smart kid boarding school." Yes, he's extra bitter right now.
He is also well aware of how badly Siberia went. We all made a lot of mistakes. I should’ve went to Tony directly, instead of assuming that he wouldn’t help us. I should’ve told him about what Hydra did to his parents before we knew what they made you do. If he had time to process, I think he would he dealt with the situation very differently. But you can’t change the past. You can only move forward.
Tony: Maybe not. But 48 hours after her dad is arrested is probably not the time to start those conversations. Even Benjamin thinks her reaction is kind of understandable. He told me when he texted me yesterday. Also, apparently his BFF got detention for allegedly watching my sex tape when he was helping.
“Because he wanted to be your friend first before he jumped you. Then you had to get the idiot boyfriend in California. Who you should have dropped as soon as he told you who to hang out with,” MJ admonished.
“Why did you not mention that earlier?” Steve asked worriedly. He had no idea the wedding would be that early.
Nomad: Sam won’t let me touch the new suit for a least another week, but I’m using the new phone now. Thank you.
HSBF: Oh God. This is why I said they could not post the stuff online. They were really mad about that.
Blue phone: There are so many things that you already feel guilty about. I didn’t want you to have another one. I didn’t want you to cross that line.
Me: The downside was he was always comparing me to you and I could never be as good as you to him. You were the standard he measured everyone else to and we were all lacking, especially me.
“Before Friday was banned from telling me anything, she told me that you and Tony never really recovered from Siberia even though it’s been seven years. She said your relationship with Tony is, and I quote complicated. Is that true?” Laura asked even though her conversation with Tony earlier confirmed that.
Cousin Q: Hey, we found Leo and Loki. Nothing to worry about. Although I'm going to have to go to Norway with Thor on a mission. I have to find a wayward King. We'll talk when I get back.
Me: That wouldn’t be that hard. Although I would worry about a certain person from HR trying to break into the office to shoot me. I am just kind of glad she’s at one of the remote offices outside of the DC Metro.
Tony: I am all but 12% committed. But I still need to talk to Pepper. She is coming up late Monday. We’re going to meet with the board and others on Tuesday before the SI Thanksgiving break begins. That could push me over.
If things were different, I probably would’ve had that announcement occur during the UN General Assembly the month before, even though it would’ve been New York instead of where the announcement took place in the movie. However, I don’t want to mess up my own timeline or go back and put it in. Besides, October is a great time to shake up the international stage with a major announcement about Wakanda actually being a technological superpower. Just in time to show everybody up at the November climate change talks. I’m sure they can bring a lot to the table when it comes to being green.
Red Malibu: Everything is set up. Although we are moving up the timetable a couple of days because of recent events.
Red Malibu: It’s okay. You will see her soon, I hope. Slingshot is making travel arrangements, so be ready to roll any moment.
Anthony: Yo-Yo heard rumors about the guy who murdered her cousin being out and about on U.S. soil making deals with the Watchdogs. I may have helped her find Intel on this, but apparently I’m not as stealthy as I think I am because Agent Scary is now coming with us to New York to give us spy lessons.
Me: Two, Agent May likes you. Don’t worry, it’s mostly platonic at this point. After having one boyfriend/fuck buddy turn out to be Hydra and her ex-husband murdered by said Hydra boyfriend’s minions, she’s kind of off of relationships right now.
D Fitzsimmons: At least I won over the step-grandparent. Okay, where can I get food where I can avoid my family? I don't have the energy.
Tony: And I have accepted that Wanda is my daughter-in-law and I am writing her into the will because I kind of killed her family, so she should get something.
We will be doing Shield Agent/Avengers mission reports in the story. This will function similarly to the interludes during the first story. Remember, Daisy and Laura are off by themselves, Laura in a different dimension/timeline several years in the future, and Daisy on Sakai, which might as well be considered a different dimension. I promise we’ll be checking on Daisy soon.
Me: Which totally explains why she showed up at my apartment last week to throw me across the room. It’s also the reason why she broke down crying after damaging my newest armor and I just tried to get her to talk to Laura before she ran away.
