"Oh, Vanessa usually sleeps past noon. I guess it's a siren thing since her brother and her mom's side of the family does it too," Daniel says, "I tried to get her out of that habit, but all I did was make it to where she wakes up earlier when she has guests."
Hello beautiful people, I'm back with another chapter! This one will be a bit short and somewhat of a filler chapter, but the next one will be quite interesting! Enjoy <3
"I don't have a 'best behavior' Dean," Tim grumbles back, his low voice makes Dean shiver. "I just fell out of the sky."
"I'm sure there will be more bee questions," Tim waves his hand at Dean, which makes him chuckle.
"I forgot to introduce myself, I am Sarah's grandma, Maggie. So tell me, why are two feds looking for her?" Maggie says, taking a seat on the black couch.
"That. Was. Amazing Vanessa, "Castiel says out of breath. With a snap of his fingers, the mess they made disappears, and his belt and pants are perfectly on him.
Dean quickly licks his kips before they connect with the angels. Dean can't help but melt into Castiel's touch. They break apart for a quick breath and get right back at it.
"Cas," She whispers, not wanting to wake anyone up, but she forgets that she is outside. Vanessa scans her yard, and thank the seas that all the alcohol burned off when she shifted, otherwise she'd have a monster headache.
"H-hi," Vanessa says breathlessly, she can't help but stare at his breathtaking eyes.
"Okay, walk to the living room, calmly," Vanessa says firmly, to her dragons. She and two large winged beasts walk slowly towards the living room. The larger of the two tries to nip the smaller one, which they're met with a low growl. Both dragons lift their heads and sniff the air, blue eyes and pale yellow eyes stare at the boys, both of their lips curl back and both of their scaly wings spread out. "Knock it off you two, their our guests" Vanessa hisses.
Dean sets the bag on the beat-up coffee table, he looks down to find one of the two dragons sniffing him. "Hello umm, Malachite?" He bends down to pet her, "did not miss you too much."
"Thanks, Dean." She says before kissing him on the forehead.
Vanessa plants a kiss on Castiel's still confined cock and his wings start fluffing. Vanessa slowly pulls off his boxer and his cock springs free, she licks her hand to get it wet and wraps it around the base of his mostly hard cock.
"I love how you say that as you're eating it," Vanessa hums as she takes a bite of her toast. Dean shrugs and says "I would never turn down a free meal, even if it was a bland salad."
Speechless from what he'd just seen, Sam just nods and pushes the body out of the way. Vanessa struts her new, tall, form through the door. The dead body is now gone and three of the five vamps still linger in the room, sitting on the couches that face the door. "Dave, I thought you went to check in the prisoner, " a short blonde haired vampire says, she walks towards Dave/Vanessa with a flirtatious look in her cold blue eyes.
Dean knew it was a good idea to come early, barely anyone is here! This is perfect, less shoving from impatient people and the animals are usually awake.
Castiel's messy black hair is sticking up in all directions, his blue eyes crinkle as the grin on his face grows bigger. "A surprise?" Dean groans, Castiel walks around the bed and pushes Dean toward the door.
Vanessa looks at Sam with a large grin, "oh Sam, I never choke" she picks up her burger as Dean mirrors it and they start their little race. As Vanessa and Dean scarf down their food, Bobby takes the time to steal some of their fries
Vanessa smiles, knowing the reason why he is asking.
Vanessa walks to the window and where her suitcase is, she bends down to open it and pulls out a plain t-shirt and a pair of soft leggings as well as a plain black bra. The sound of wings flapping tells Vanessa that she is in clear to get dressed.
She puts the feather on the bedside table then turns back to him, she slowly unbuttons his trench coat from the top down.
"Did you wanna get back at it? Or did you want dinner?"
Vanessa makes a noise in the back of her throat and spits in the water, she then plucks a strand of her pink hair and throws it into the water. The pot makes a weird gurgling noise and it turns into a dark yellow almost brown color.
But he doesn't fully believe himself.
"I watch over everyone's dreams to make sure they don't have any nightmares, Dean has them the most, you get second place, and I have yet to see Sam have any, which I find peculiar," Castiel says, still messing with her hair.
Dean gets on his knees and hovers over the man, he places to fingers on his neck to check for a pulse when the guy snaps his eyes open and grabs his arm.
"I'm an angel remember?" he explains as he stretches out his wings more. He rolls his shoulders and keeps them that way, almost like a dominance display that birds do.
She looks up, past the coffee table and her sword, to the digital clock on her TV stand. In big bold letters, it read
"Morning love," his husky voice sends a shiver down Vanessa's spine. He plants another small kiss before Vanessa turns in his arms.
"Vanessa" Bobby stands up and grabs her free hand and pulls her away from the tall giant, making her let go of his wrist. He rubs his wrist, letting out a low whimper. "Crazy bitch" he mutters. At that moment all Dean saw red, stood up, and punched him right in the face, making the giant guy stumble a few steps back and into a table.
Dean pulls Baby into the driveway instead of under the small birch tree, next to Vanessa's purple 1967 Pontiac GTO, it's as gorgeous as he remembers.
"Yes, how did...never mind...he's injured too" Sam groans. Vanessa watches as Castiel clutches his side and limps toward the chair next to the couch.
He lets out a loud groan as Vanessa rubs the tip of his throbbing cock. "I-I don't think I will last m-much longer," Castiel gasps.
"No. Thank you for turning it into a first date," Dean says before he turns the engine on and heads for the highway. "Also, when we get back to the motel, Imma kill Sam nice and slow."
"You know Lir, he'll probably call tomorrow not knowing that he is a day late, as always," Vanessa smiles. 'Lir?' Dean mouths and smirks, Vanessa rolls her eyes and smiles, knowing that he finds the name kind of stupid.
"Va-anessa," he moans bucking his hip into her hand, "this feels—shit—sooo good."
"Let me take those," Sam attempts to take the bags from Dean, but Dean takes a step back. "I've got this," Dean growls and tries to move past Sam.
"Really?" Dean asks.
He sighs, "yup you win Vanessa." Dean takes the shells from her, not noticing what's in her other hand.
"You know I'm technically stronger than you," Vanessa says before taking a swig of the cold beer, she shivers as it goes down her throat.
"Fuck yes."
"Okay, now, hand me the salmon scales and the wooden spoon, " Vanessa says as she throws an herb into a tall pot that's on the stove.
No matter how hard she tries to forget it, it will always come back to haunt her.
"But we can worry about that when we get home," Dean grumbles. "And after we get him settled, and some clothes of his own, and a nap."
"Let's just hope that he hasn't drank any blood" Vanessa mutters as she tosses the empty vial into the trash.
After about an hour of walking and seeing the animals in the Africa area and swinging by the moose exhibit to take a picture, they're finally at their destination, the Shores and Aquarium.
"Well thanks, I'll have to reward you" Dean smirks.
"By zhe Beetles, nice, it's one of my favorizes," Vanessa says before she starts humming the song.
"Good morning and happy birthday," Daniel says, "do you want eggs or no?"
Dean watches as her cheeks turn pink, she hides some of it with her mug and she takes a sip. "It's, uh, I mean you'll find out eventually. Since it came today I'll show you later I guess."
At the sound of wings beats they slowly pull apart, Dean watches Vanessa lick her lips before he turns away to face Castiel.
"I'll stay with you," Cas says as he watches Vanessa leave the room, she quickly walks down the stairs in silence and into the living room and takes a seat next to Sam.
"This is much better than yesterday's breakfast," Tim says between bites.
"Same," Dean says before he pauses, realizing what he said but Vanessa just ignores it and takes a swig for her beer. Its lukewarm temperature makes her shiver when she swallows it. Vanessa frowns, wishing she hadn't worn leggings, she should have put on shorts or a skirt.
"Well blue happens to be my favorite color," Dean says as he grins at her.
"We're stopping at a gas station on the way home," Dean quickly says, putting the keys into the ignition and back out of the small parking lot and back onto the main road.
Vanesa opens her eyes with a gasp, the aching in her chest from the dream is still there. While she knows it's probably around midnight, her bedroom looks as clear as day thanks to one of her sirens abilities.
"Was it?" The man looks around too. "I don't recall falling. Mmm, well, I recall the feeling."
Dean leans over to Vanessa. "What's the gift?" He asks curiously.
"We'll be fine, " Sam says.
Once she's done, Vanessa pulls away from his neck and stands on her tiptoes to plant a kiss on his mouth. Dean hums, rubbing his thumbs in a calming circle on her hips.
"Enjoy," Sam sits back in his seat and slides Castiel and Dean an opened beer.
"I do know that Dean, and I am all yours right now," Vanessa shivers as another small wave crashes over her tail.
Vanessa grabs Malachite's tail and starts pulling her closer to her. "Give. Me. The. Shirt," she grabs the shirt that's still in her jaws.
Enjoy <3
He swings his legs off the bed and stands, quietly stretching put his back and wincing when it pops loudly. He takes one step towards the door before he feels his whole body freeze unnaturally.
"It'll be nice for me to read, I don't know anything about y'all, " Vanessa says, grabbing another book. Cas looks at Vanessa then back at Dean, almost as if he can sense what they did earlier, he glares at Dean and his wings spread out a bit.
He knows he should be up there with Sam researching, but doing that for hours on end makes his head hurt, unlike yelling random facts out at his glorious mounted TV.
Dean's eye twitches in anger. His cheeks are getting even redder as this goes on. "You know what? I was going to yell at you, but fuck you, fuck Sam, and fuck this, you're flying your ass home." Dean pushes past him and stomps into the crowd. Almost as clear as day he can hear wings flapping and the sound of someone gasping.
"Well, what does their natural habitat look like? It's yellow and brown, their spots help them blend in," Castiel chuckles. "I can explain it more if you'd like."
"None. He made butterflies, actually," Castiel smiles as he watches a turtle dive into the water.
"Well I would hate to rush your snake watching, but it is noon so we can check out the aquarium after this then probably leave, and then bring Sammy some lunch." Dean pats Castiel on his shoulder. "What do you say?"
x," she says with a flirtatious smile.
"And I have the rest of the ingredients at home, as well as a pack of beer" Vanessa sighs as she rests her head against the passenger window.
"Why not today or tomorrow? Plus where we're headed, it's a bit of a drive."
She sighs, placing the long two-handed sword that she's been trying to distract herself with by polishing onto the round coffee table in front of her. She looks at her phone thats playing the music and grabs it, she leans on the armrest it was sitting on and turns off the song. She opens the messaging app her phone came with and scroll through her contacts. She stops scrolling when she almost reaches the bottom, she stares at the name.
"Dean," Castiel says, putting more pressure on each stroke.
"Why not? You're as pretty as one" he says as he lifts his large hand to touch her, but Vanessa swiftly grabs his large hairy wrist with one hand and starts squeezing.
"Lift your arms," Dean commands, she slowly lifts them and Dean quickly pulls her shirt, ignoring the fact that she doesn't have a bra on, both Dean and Castiel ignores the sound of his feathers fluffing and rustling against his trench coat excitedly.
date, like a movie. Not that this isn't normal, I just would like to go to a nice restaurant next!"
"Well, I saw a sign back there saying in fifteen miles we'll be at a, uh, gas station," Sam mumbles and pulls out his phone.
Dean leads the way, too afraid to talk to the strange man. Instead, he focuses on not falling back down the crater. His legs burn as they finally reach the top, where Sam is freaking out on the phone. Sam pauses as he watches his brother help the man out of the hole.
e, he thinks as he sets his drink in the cupholder.
"Sorry that took so long, it took me some time to find the last book, " Castiel says.
"No, like the ones with scales and wings," Vanessa says as she puts her nearly empty bottle on the coffee table and stands up. "How'd you think that got torn off?" She points to the corner of the coffee table that's propped up with books.
"That's because it's a hotel," Vanessa explains before taking a huge bite of the muffin. "I don't mind being in a motel, but if I could, I would spend the extra dollars to stay at someplace with free breakfast."
"You son of a bitch" Dean tries to turn his head to look at Vanessa, but he can't because if the spell that the old witch put on them.
Vanessa pushes herself up and rolls off the bed, she digs around underneath the bed to find luggage, she pulls out a large black suitcase that will last her the trip and she throws it on the bed. She packs everything she needs, bounties typically take a month at max for her so she packs accordingly.
Vanessa nibbles a delicate part of his neck, drawing out another moan, and sinks her free hand into the soft feathers that are wrapped around her entire body. Castiel's long feathers brush against her thighs and some even manage to make their way past the waistband of her pajama shorts and they don't go any further
"Sit back, relax, and if you touch my gills, I will leave you here alone, " Vanessa glares at him, she pulls down his borrowed pajama pants to the floor, and starts rubbing his rock hard cock through his boxers with her palm. She carefully pulls off the boxers, exposing him to the cold air, and she wraps her hand around his length and starts to slowly go up and down, careful not to scratch him with her long nails.
She buries her face into the crook of his neck and sighs. "I'vee misseed yoou," Vanessa murmurs into his neck.
Dean pulls the keys out of the ignition, slumping forward, resting his hands and head on the steering wheel. He and Sam had just gotten back from a hard case, they didn't get a chance to save the girls and the monsters had run before Dean had even gotten out of his restraints. The one girl that did make it to the hospital got killed by the monsters in the end.
"Where did you find these?" Sam asks before taking the last bite of his sandwich, pulling Castiel's attention back to the conversation.
Castiel is a moaning mess as Vanessa doesn't stop stroking his softening cock. Once the last white rope shoots out, Vanessa removes her hand to pull his boxer back over him.
"Plus you were in third, I was the one losing miserably," Vanessa says as she crawls next to Dean, laying her head next to his. "But I think my dad seems to like you, which is good, it's hard to tell if he, umm, likes anyone."
"Was it a good one?"
Vanessa stands up and tiredly walks to and up the stairs, she flicks her wrist and the guest bedroom door starts repairing itself. She opens her bedroom door and walks towards her bed. Plans of rescuing Dean and how hot Cas is flows through her mind like a constant stream. She buries herself in the thick blankets and quickly falls asleep.
So I think this will update every two weeks, but if anything happens, you can find me on Tumblr at blueberryrock!
Look what I finally figured out how to do! blueberryrock.tumblr.com bam! That right there is my Tumblr! Hopefully, the link works and I didn't mess it up.
He nods, his wings drooping even more. "I got bored of watching over Sam, so I came to watch you instead" he replies.
"You guys suck at being secretive" Vanessa says with a smile.
"Well, you better not ruin my seats, get in," Dean grumbles as he slides into the Impala. He glances at the rearview mirror, Tim's borrowed shirt is soaked along with Sam's sweat pants, he notices that he is shivering slightly and Dean turns up the heat from him as Sam slides in next to him.
"What'd I miss?" Dean asks as he steps past Tim, whose eyes are glued to the screen, and slides into his recliner and takes a sip of his new beer.
Vanessa fidgets with her badge, opening it then closing it a few times, then turning it around in her hands, it's only when one of Castiel's wings extend to touch her arm. So, she starts fiddling with one of his flight feathers, twirling it around in her fingers then running her thumb over the rachis of the feather.
"What the fuck was that?" Sam blurts out.
"Cas is right, Dean will probably attack us both, plus Cas can put Dean to sleep and put him in the car as we deal with the rest." Sam sighs, rubbing the back of his neck with his hand.
"I am glad to hear that Cas, " she grins. "Just tell me when and if you're close."
"No. Well, yes. I guess I do, it's just that this car is starting to feel cramped," Tim mindlessly glances out the window.
"What did you find Bobby?" Dean answers, putting Bobby on speaker and setting the phone down.
"I won!" She excitedly swims to Dean, who hasn't floated very far. "And I think I found a tooth stuck in a rock." She grins as she holds up the rock, showing off her needle-thin fangs.
"One down," Vanessa hands back Dean's pole and grabs a couple of worms to stick on her pole. "I think five more to go."
"I don't wanna hear any suggestions except if it's another round of beer," Bobby says before Vanessa can say anything exciting.
Vanessa sits next to him and shrugs. "Well after lunch is when we have, well, lunch, then dessert, and then presents."
So it's been a while, I know, and I apologize for it, but a lot of things have happened since the last chapter which is why it's coming to you now and not last month or so.
"If they desperately need my help, which I doubt they will since it's just a salt and burn, I will go," Castiel says before adding. "But since I don't think they will need my help, I will be right here, driving those nightmares away."
"Well you can go ahead and go downstairs, I to wanna change, " Vanessa says, she grabs her phone that's charging on the nightstand. It has been about a week since she has taken this bounty and spoken to Dean in person, but they text each other daily and say goodnight to each other.
"I have some on werewolves, one or two on shapeshifters, but I mostly hunt witches and sometimes sirens so I have a lot of books on them," Vanessa explains with a smile, some of her human friends find it weird that she has so many books about supernatural creatures, but she doesn't really care, she only hopes that they don't find out the truth.
Tim nods, he takes the spoon back and holds it as Dean showed him, he scoops up beans and then shoves them into his mouth. "Ahh!" He says with his mouthful. "It burns."
Dean glances over at the empty seat next to him. Maybe he should call Castiel back here and talk to him and apologize. Would he even come? Is he mad too? Does he actually understand what a date is? He did say that Sam explained it to him.
"Yeah?" Dean asks, Sam gestured for Dean to hand him the keys, reluctantly he hands them over and sits back down. Sam walks out of the house and to the car.
"Which is fine, I have a pool out back, and I made a potion which makes me safe to be around under the full moon," Vanessa says happily. She's always been with her family through it but almost never anyone other than them. Rarely her potential mates would come and hang out with her, but no one has done that in years.
After hours of laughing, storytelling, and plenty of drinks, Vanessa writes down on a piece of paper all the addresses of her safe houses and the passwords to them. They drive her home and Dean politely walks her up to her doorstep as Bobby says goodbye and hops in his car and Sam patiently waits in the car.
"Wasn't she the one that ate a three-pound sandwich?" Daniel asks.
It looks like whatever fell was the size of the moon! Veins of blue light weave their way down to the bottom where the blue slowly turns white with burnt trees and their limbs are scattered in the crater. And in the middle of the crater lays a figure next to ashy marks that resemble incredibly large wings.
"Salmon is pretty high up there with shrimp close behind it and mint chocolate chip ice cream," Vanessa grins, she licks her lips and ignores the muted rumble from her stomach. It probably won't the best idea to ignore breakfast than eat a lot of fish, but Vanessa doesn't care at this point.
"Noo, I always seeem too speeak likee this afteer I speeak in meermadik," Vanessa explains. "I gueess yoou coould call it an acceent. It will goo away eeveentually." Vanessa pulls him into a tight hug and hums.
"Well, Bobby said to check him over for any marks or symbols on him. I told him that you found wings burned into the ground," Sam says. The second Sam mentions the wings, Tim immediately looks away from his beans to Sam.
"Cas?" Dean turns to look at the angel as he feels invisible warm feathers brush against him.
"What's your favorite...food?"
"Sounds good to me," Castiel nods as they head into the zoo.
"Yes. It's all about the temperature, and I've figured out how to get either-or," Vanessa nods.
Dean sighs, he opens the door and slides out of his baby, walking around to grab the groceries in the trunk, Dean shuffles through the bunker door and starts down the stairs.
"Me neither" Dean turns the impala on and smiles at the rumble of the engine.
"Do what?" Sam asks without looking at his brother.
"You don't?" Vanessa asks.
Dean walks to the door and opens it to find that it's just a bathroom, he turns right and to find a slight curve and two doors. He opens the closest one to find what is a guest room.
Bobby says.
"Yeah, it's a flat cake with crumbs on it, so,
Vanessa snuggles into the soft blankets, which smell just like Dean, Vanessa's smile grows bigger as she remembers that she scented Dean! Claiming him as hers, too bad he can't do it to her like any other supernatural creature, the best he can do is leave a mark.
Dean shrugs. "I dunno, Walmart maybe?"
She places it on the island before she tears into the bag. She pulls out a small box, curious Dean steps closer and watches her open it. Inside is a pair of dangling earrings that are shaped like a bee in a honeycomb. "Aww," she squeals.
Hey guys I'm back with another chapter! I hope you guys enjoy this series, I definitely enjoy writing it. Feel free to leave any comments and I'll reply!
"Oh yes," Castiel nods in confirmation. "His original design made their wingspan as big as a pillow and their body half the size with large stingers, but almost everyone vetoed the stingers and size. Which is why he made bees, then wasps."
Today, the first text Vanessa has gotten from Dean was a cute little message about how much he misses her and about how much of a nerd Sam is. She types back a similar message then turns her phone off.
He had called ahead to announce that he is coming and to ask where she will be, Vanessa manages to move across the country more than Sam and Dean! But that's only because she owns like a billion houses and apartments, which he and Sam have used, sometimes it gets a little weird stumbling upon some of the houses, but it sure beats staying at a motel.
"Woah, did Tim have a bad accident?" Dean shoves his phone into the back pocket and crosses his arms over his chest.
Dean whimpers when the man finally lets go of his arm. He rubs where the man's fingers squeezed his arm. "C-checking for a pulse," Dean says nervously. "I-it seems like you have one."
But not before Dean grabs the shark tooth.
"About the date? I'm down to go," Vanessa says, smiling when she sees Dean's whole face light up.
"To show off, it's fun to do it, anyway, now I am going to make some delicious and perfectly safe crumb cake!" Vanessa says, turning her spatula into a whisk.
"No, you can have it after the rest of the food is done," Dean declares, turning his attention to a small bowl. Vanessa groans as she stares at the fish, getting hungrier by the second, but she does wait like a good little shrimp.
"How did you–nevermind" Dean mumbles, he takes a nice long sip of his beer and sighs, he slightly frowns as he notices that Vanessa is staring at him, but as soon as he catches her, she quickly looks away with a feeble hint of blush on her light tan cheeks.
"Thank you, but the food is here, you need to wake up," they say and shake her harder.
still echoing in his mind.
Dean sighs, his mind going blank. "I dont really know, start tomorrow or next fucking week," Dean grunts, then his attention gets pulled away when he hears something from the pool. He glances past the fire to the pool where Castiel is crouched down talking to Vanessa. Dean watches as she hoists herself onto the tile and rests only her stomach down is in the pool.
"And Bobby is meeting us there?" Sam asks as he looks out the passenger side window, watching large buildings zoom by.
"I wish," Castiel shakes his head. The eagle stops grooming its feathers and stares at Castiel. "But Michael made most of the birds, modeled their wings after ours and one bird's coloring to everyone's wings."
"Dean. It's like three in the morning, can't your mystery comet wait?" Sam whines.
Tim shakes his head. "No," he says, trying to put the magazine back but it flops with the ground. "I am fine." Tim forcefully shoves the magazine into the rack, his blue eyes gazing up and down, wanting to pull another one-off. His eyes immediately lock onto one at the top, reaching and grabbing it before Dean can see it. "Can I get this one?"
"Technically he's only beating the shit out of you two," Sam smirks, watching Dean's entire face go red.
"Yes, when I had asked him why he only shrugged and told me to get out of the kitchen," Castiel says taking chunks of scales mixed with the skin that they are attached to. After some time, Vanessa can finally feel her legs shifting back, she starts moving them as much as she can.
"O-okay, " Dean replies but he's met with the sound of the freezing water splashing onto the tiles and his bare feet.
"No."
Sam takes the last bite of his breakfast as Cas walks into the kitchen with his wings spread out wide. "You have a nice house," he says as he takes the seat next to Vanessa.
"Oh yeah. They have the best green apple pie in the state!" Vanessa replies happily.
"We probably should," Dean nods his head, but no one moves. Instead, they both slowly fall asleep together. Not peacefully for Vanessa.
Anger bubbles in Dean's stomach at what Vanessa said, is she being serious? She can't be...she did come in here basically unarmed, except for her little knife. Why would Bobby trust her enough for him to suggest them to seek her out?
Fat grey blobs with adorable snouts bob calmly in the water, swimming around lazily, not caring that tons of people with their kids are watching them. Which oddly enough, Dean feels the same way, not fat or a blob swimming, but he feels everyone is staring at him and Castiel. He doesn't know why he's feeling that way, now he wishes he brought Sam with him or just went by himself, not having to worry about if this would be considered a date or if people are silently judging him.
"Why were you doing it?"
They, meaning Castiel, decide to skip ahead to the reptiles, which Dean doesn't mind one bit. Joy fills his chest when he sees the angel's face when they reach the reptile building.
"Vanessa," Castiel begins, grabbing both of her hands, "the full moon is rising, you need to get in the water."
"You are just like a platypus," Sam blurts out. Everyone at the table looks at him hoping for an explanation.
Dean shakes his head and turns back to the snake, which has slithered off into a log. Castiel softly grabs Dean's arm and pulls him to the next exhibit. Which he drones on about how the New Caledonian giant gecko (or a Leach's giant gecko) is the world's largest living gecko and many fun facts about geckos in general.
Hearing the rustles of scales, Dean turns his head to find Pluto staring at him. "You think she'll like this?" Dean snorts, to his slight dismay, Pluto crawls over to him and sniffs the shirt. Seeing the little dragon on it, he curls his lips up, showing his steak-knife-like teeth, but luckily he walks away.
"I don't know, a holding room? Whatever, secondly, it isn't the worst idea, but I don't think he's a demon," Sam huffs. "He didn't react to holy water or silver."
"Yeah, I'll take two, scrambled please," Dean replies. "So where's Sam?"
and she repeats it over and over again, her arms burning until she pulls a large fat trout out of the water.
"Even if Sam and Dean need you?"
"Ugh, I need a nap" he groans.
"Move you dumb-"
"I didn' cazch zhat."
"Put your seatbelt on and we'll be off," Dean says, he leans in the back to show him how to do it.
"Thanks," Vanessa mutters as she gets her legs out, she looks down at her destroyed tail in disgust, it's a gross smelly husk that has turned a very ugly brown. With a snap of her fingers, it disappears and Vanessa wraps one of the towels around her and grabs the others.
"Well, she did help rescue me and she's letting us stay here," Dean says crossing his arms as ideas of what he could make pop into his head.
"I'm glad I'm one of those people," Dean says, "i-if you wanna do that scenting thing or whatever, I don't care."
"Wow, nice catch," Dean pats Vanessa's shoulder. Vanessa quickly unhooks the thrashing trout and examines it hungrily, the wet scales glinting in the sunlight and the lake water starts to burn her fingertips, causing her long talons to grow.
"I don't think he likes you," Dean smirks and nudges Castiel with his shoulder. "It would be funny if he could see your big ass wings."
Dean has heard that speech many times, but after that, they are usually friendly to him. Except for that one guy who just kept threatening him so much that Dean just up and left.
"Tell me about it, right now you smell like you're supposed to be a couple of weeks dead, " Vanessa says with a smile.
"More like she'll rip you limb from limb and whoever you were cheating with and eat them, her mother told me how she has done that twice," Daniel smirks. "She's a nice person, but she can be scary sometimes. Oh, and if she gives you a rock or if you find one in your car or something, you better keep that."
"I'd advise against it," Daniel smiles, leaning back into the couch. He watches with joy as Vanessa tears into the gift to reveal a large egg.
"Is it...is it true?" Dean asks.
Clenching his jaw, Dean just takes another quick sip before turning back to the TV, with "
"I thought you were sleeping," Dean leans on the headboard, watching Vanessa lovingly.
"So I've gotta ask," Dean says as they start to make their circle. "Why spots? Like how does that even help them?"
"I was looking around then got distracted by these," Castiel turns to the stand, grabbing one of the necklaces from its branch. "It's a cobra, a king cobra perhaps." Castiel hands it to Dean to examine.
"But I dont know what to make!"
"Did you make these?" Dean asks as they lean on the railing once more, watching the eagle groom themself on a large tree branch. Their elegant brown body feathers reflect the sunlight beautifully.
"Now, let's get you outside" Dean turns Vanessa around and grips her shoulder, trying not to accidentally brush against her neck.
Dean opens his mouth to answer but closes it instead. "I don't know, I was kinda hoping you could decide?"
"Sounds good, " he cups her face with his free hand and pulls her in for a kiss. Her blazing lips crash on his and she lets go of his hand to wrap her warm arms around his neck. After a few seconds, they pull away and Vanessa leads Dean up the stairs and into her bedroom.
"Delicious that's what it is," Dean grumbles. "Trust me, you'll love it," Dean gives Tim a reassuring smile. Tim nods and looks boredly around the diner.
Vanessa groans, a few air bubbles float to the top. She takes a deep breath in through her gills and opens her eyes to find that the sun has barely risen. She rubs her tired eyes, making sure she doesn't accidentally poke herself in the eye with her long nails again.
"Thanks, Sammy, really, for everything.,
"Thanks for the help, what time is it?" Vanessa asks as she rubs almost all of the scales on her chest, she puts the wet slimy towel around her breasts and starts to try and wiggle out of her heavy tail.
"I am really good at it, last time we played Dean got so mad he threw it in the trash," Sam chuckles.
The girl that's running the booth boredly looks up, she tells them the price and takes Dean's card.
"It was something bigger than a damn bird, I thought it was a comet at first, but when it got closer to the ground, it sounded like it was screaming," Dean shakes Sam again. "Can we just check it out?"
"With camouflage," Castiel says making it sound like he wants to add 'duh Dean, isn't obvious?'
"Not even a little bit, I should've taken Cas' offer of putting me to sleep then having him wake me up" Dean sighs, "I did however read all about how sirens shift to their fish forms and the, uhh, great war of sirens and how each tribe fought over the entire Atlantic ocean!"
"Now if you excuse me, I'm going to try and sleep extra early tonight, Dean you can take my room if wanted, " Vanessa says when she slips back into the water, she pushes away from the pool wall and swims deeper into the water, trying not to splash them with water.
With a smirk on his face, Dean happily walks away, towards the kitchen. He walks past the dining table to the stairs, he pauses at the little black baby gate, not knowing how to open it, he fiddles with the handle and it swings open.
He sighs and rolls the dice, "come on three, come on three," he chants as he watches the dice roll. It lands on a four and Dean loses it. "Fuck this game, he is all my god damn money Cas," Dean grabs the money and throws it in the direction of the angel, and storms off. "Fuck all of this, I'm going to bed."
Uh, so, I don't actually know what else to put here besides I hope y'all enjoy the chapter....
"Just one clean cut and I could fix your bed head problem" Dean grumbles, watching his brother break apart a large knot.
"I'll take your word for it," Dean says with a grin.
"Because she's a friend, a very powerful friend, and I can tell she likes you, so don't go makin' her mad. Okay?" Bobby says as he pushes away Pluto.
"Like turtles," Sam mutters.
"Gross, " Dean mutters as his nose wrinkles from the smell of the ocean and boiling fish that's coming from the pot...and maybe Vanessa.
"I'm so glad your here, getting out of the pool with a tail is a bitch," Vanessa says as he pulls her tail out of the water, it lands on the cold tile with a wet smack and then Castiel gently lowers the rest of her.
"Vanessa, language," Daniel scolds but Vanessa's smile doesn't falter, but she does mutter a sorry.
"You know, I've never seen a witches veins light up pink," Sam says as he closes the passenger's side door.
Vanessa seems to say a full sentence, full of jumbled up sounds, tongue clicks, and the tiniest hint of screeching.
"Not much," Tim shrugs, his eyes finally breaking away from the screen. A soft smile forms on his lips as his eyes land on Dean. "Except for an excellent question about bees." He says, turning his head quickly back to the screen before adding, "and cars."
And that is the day before Vanessa's birthday!
Dean opens his mouth to say no, but Vanessa does it for him. "Noo, we just finisheed. What's with the bag?" She asks, moving around Dean towards the angel.
But that's one reason why she loves the southern states, the summers get so hot that you can cook an egg on the sidewalk and she has reasons to stay home most of the time. Weeks after her sister's brutal death, Vanessa refused to stay anywhere remotely cold, which is why she had a house built in the south that still stands today.
(See the end of the chapter for
"First off, it's not a dungeon. Secondly–"
"Coming with us, on hunts and stuff."
"Wanna bet?"
"Your welcome, here you go Sammy," Dean places Sam's plate next to his laptop, then takes his seat across from Vanessa.
"Did you drink a lot last night? Damn, if you did I should have driven earlier to join you," Dean jokes making Vanessa smile.
They sneak forward and slowly open the door to find all six vampires in the same room. The head vamp is currently pacing back and forth in front of a headless vampire and the others that are standing with their head hung lowly. "Now, I am going to check on our new guest and shove some blood down his throat" he grumbles the last part.
Vanessa feels the bed dip beside her but she doesn't take her eyes off the TV until one of Castiel's large wings wiggle their way underneath her, and yes she may have let him do that but it is only to keep that side warm!
"Can we stop by the gift shop? Just to look around?" Dean stops Castiel and turns to look at him.
The second she gets her steak knife teeth on a sleeve, she takes running with it in her mouth. "Malachite no," Vanessa yells, she climbs over Sam and starts chasing after her. "Get back here you lil shit."
"I didn't catch that last part."
"Shit. I dunno, Wednesday? Thursday sounds more reasonable..." Dean trails off.
That makes the angel pause for a second, he strokes his chin and grumbles to himself. "He isn't here, but I want to wait for later."
Dean walks over to the table to watch her in hunger, she starts humming to the song that Dean recognizes as Kashmir. "I didn't know you like Led Zeppelin, " Dean yawns, Vanessa walks over to him with a mug in hand.
"You guys would love her, she's funny and nice, well, she is until you get her to play games," Vanessa shivers. "She's ruthless when it comes to monopoly."
"As you should be," Daniel mutters, turning his focus on the eggs.
"Your tail, it's gorgeous!" Dean exclaims as Vanessa lifts her torso onto the tiles, she cringes when her scales rub against the tiles.
"You're welcome, " she says rubbing her face on his neck and tracing an unknown pattern on his chest, his shirt wet with sweat.
"I can always make you a birthday pie or I could be persuaded to make you a birthday cake," Dean wiggles his eyebrows at Vanessa making her smile.
Vanessa takes a second to look up at the surface, hopefully, Dean won't be too disappointed when Vanessa kicks his ass, she can see his legs kicking to keep him afloat, maybe she'll take over dinner tonight and give his legs a break.
Dean quickly gulps it down, he coughs as the taste still lingers in his mouth. He rubs his sore gums and hands the mug back to Vanessa.
"Come on, Sam, this case is going nowhere. It's just for a day!" Dean pleads.
Dean groans, knowing exactly what he should do, he unzips the tent and crawls inside. "Sam!" He shakes his brother awake. "Wake up it's urgent."
She dashes out of the room and down the stairs, skipping a few steps at a time as she tries to get her stuck fingers out of her bun. Vanessa trips on her own foot and yelps, with her free hand she tries to grab for the railing but she misses and lands on someone. "Sorry" Vanessa apologizes, her face heating up as they help her to her feet, she rips her fingers out of the bun, ruining it.
"I'm feeling fine now," he says as he takes a big bite of the apple.
"So what? You wanna lock him in the dungeon?"
"And?"
Vanessa thinks to herself as she remembers how many layers Castiel and Sam wear.
She spies the dragon egg that her dad gifted her, the sun shimmering across the scaley outside. "I've forgotten all about you," she murmurs and picks up the egg, frowning when she feels the ice-cold surface. "I'm so sorry, I promise I'll put you into incubation today."
Voices are coming from another room that connects to the first room. They slowly walk towards the voices to find an archway that leads into the kitchen where the whole coven is located. Five witches surround a small bowl on a table, they're chanting something but one of them gets up to grab a cup of what Dean assumes to be the cow blood and one of the victim's hearts.
"Then I'll get it for you," he says. Dean places everything in his hands and slides it over to the cashier that's been watching them the entire time.
As he waits for the two pans to warm up, Dean quickly cleans up any leftover mess and pulls out a pack of bacon. He hums a tune as the pans finally get hot enough and he lays the first strip of bacon down, his stomach growling as he hears the sizzle.
"Well, I'm going to go and shower," Sam cuts in and runs up the stairs. The dragons at his heels until Vanessa stops them.
"Well tell him that you are grateful that he called you and that you wouldn't care if he was a week late," Daniel crosses his arms.
"I figured you'd shower first while I can get us something to eat," Sam says.
"You're going to pay, I told Dave not to turn him or even keep him here" the vampire's voice cracks "your little boy toy killed my girl, then you two came in and everyone."
"Dammit Vanessa, I said no more," Dean semi-yells. Vanessa ignores him and pours as much as she can into the already full glass and chugs it as fast as she can. She shivers as she swallows the potion-whiskey mixture and grins at him, Vanessa does hand the bottle over to Dean.
"Of course."
"Right, I will do that," Castiel says his wings slowly unwrap themselves from her. Vanessa sits up and stretches her back, she swings her legs over the side of the bed and stands up, she groans when her knees pop, man she feels old.
"Cases? Oh right, I forgot all about that," Vanessa mutters as she sadly chews her slice of toast.
Their drinks arrive along with their food. Dean happily bites into his bacon burger as Sam drizzles a small container of ranch onto his salad.
I was originally gonna put Happy Halloween here, but instead, I'll put Happy Fall!
"Tomorrow."
"Really? Which animals did you make?" Dean's gaze gets torn away from the wolves to Castiel. The angel has a small smile on his face and his eyes are still gazing at the animals.
Dean sneaks glances in the rearview mirror, watching Tim as he nods his head to the beat of the songs and gazes out the window with a fascinated expression on his face.
But uh, thank you for reading, and feel free to leave kudos and comments, I try to respond as quick as I can! And if y'all wanna find me anywhere else, my Tumblr is blueberryrock.
Castiel is at a counter next to another entrance/exit, looking at a metal tree that has necklaces and bracelets dangling from each branch.
They step into the cool building, a lot closer than Dean realized, their shoulders are brushing against each other as well as their hands. While Castiel seems to not be noticing, Dean can't help but mainly focus on that. Every part of him yearns to just grab his hand, but he chickens out when the angel excitedly says that "They have manatees!" and pulls him to the tank.
"Well I didn't wanna teach him how to eat in front of people," Dean points to Tim, who is happily eating his beans.
"Helping you, you said that I turned you on by touching your wings, sooo I don't wanna leave you hanging when it's your first time having someone else touchin' your wings," Vanessa pauses unbuttoning. "Unless you don't want me to of course."
"Put him upstairs and in the guest room closest to the bathroom," Vanessa tells Cas as he walks up the stairs, carrying an unconscious Dean bridal style.
"It is my fault, if I hadn't been as cocky as i was, I would have gotten her and we would be bringing her in as we speak."
Dean takes this time to push in the first cassette tape he can reach and turns it up. They still have about twenty more minutes to go, and Dean sure as hell isn't gonna spend it thinking about Castiel.
"I am an angel that understands that you could not change anything, she still would have bolted."
"You boys can take one of my untouched cards, I wouldn't mind," Vanessa murmurs.
They finish their lunch in silence except for Tim's faint humming as he enjoys his lunch. "Anybody need to go to the bathroom before we leave?" Dean asks as he pulls out his wallet and tosses a couple of tens onto the table. "Cause we'll only stop at a gas station for snacks."
The three look at each other and nod, they walk into the light, and Sam and Dean shoot two of the five witches in the head while Vanessa throws a knife in another one.
"I'm sorry, Dean, I don't have much control over them as one might think," Castiel mumbles. "And they do not like this bird."
"Sorry, I said that witches I've met can't do that, normal witches at least" he mumbles the last part as he shoves more food in his mouth.
Not wasting any time, Dean discards his empty beer bottle and grabs a new one, opening it quickly, he dashes back to the entrance to his "Dean Cave". He told himself he would think of a better name for it, but never mind that now. With his hand on the doorknob, he bites his lip for a second before swinging it open and closing it somewhat loudly, announcing his arrival.
"I love them," Vanessa says, pulling them out of the box to put them on. She goes to move her hair out of the way but realizes that her ears are fins. "Hold on," she mutters.
"What if she isn't home," Sam says. Dean shrugs and parks the Impala, or Baby, underneath the birch tree and turns her off. "Then we'll just wait," Dean says as he exits the Impala and groans at the heat.
"Don't speak with your mouth full, you'll choke" Vanessa says before taking a small forkful and shoveling it in her mouth.
"Do you like it?" Castiel asks, he slides into the seat next to him and studies his face. "I know you would rather have a pie, but we tried our best."
"What is chocolate milk?" Tim asks, his ocean blue eyes narrow on Dean.
"Badges first," the old woman croaks.
"From what I remember, the parents eat shrimp and then barf it into the baby's mouth and that's how they get their color! I think."
The man fell from the sky, god knows what would be after him. Thankfully the bunker can ward off quite a couple of creatures and keep him hidden from most. Not to mention that they'll be surrounded by books on creatures that Dean didn't even know existed, and hopefully, it will have something about people falling out of the sky next to burnt-looking wings.
"Hey back off you two, " an unfamiliar voice says behind the door, they unlock it and swing it open.
Panic courses through Dean's veins, part of him wants to go looking for where the person (if it is one at all) landed, and the other part of him wants to wait till morning.
"Are you sure? You had a pretty bad nightmare last night." Castiel says, still not loosening his grip on her.
Seashells adorn the outside walls of the building, and a large sign reads Colombus Aquarium outlined in seashells.
Vanessa closes the car door, looking down at her outfit, she found the least ugly pantsuit she could find, she would much rather wear a dress with cute leggings and heels, but oh well.
He shuffles down the stairs and walks into the living room to find Sam with his nose in a book. "Vanessa's making sandwiches, you want one?" Dean asks.
"Where'd you find this one? It's awesome," Sam asks as he takes the t-shirt from Vanessa.
"No hard feelings, plus I don't need sleep, " Cas says as he sits up straight, slightly stretching his wings.
"T-that would be nice" Dean replies, making her chuckle.
"Still, you have a killer voice," Dean grins at her.
"Well, we met her sometime in June, but then a friend of ours had passed away and he was the one that sent us her way, so we didn't talk at all after the funeral until a few months ago," Dean explains, his gaze shifts from Daniel towards the kitchen as he hears large nails scrape across the tile, which ment Vanessa's other dragon Pluto was coming.
Why did he get so mad? That was what he wanted...right? To go on a date with Castiel was one of his dreams, but he screwed it up by getting mad. Why did he get mad?
She looks back at the bed, the blankets are kicked to the side that Castiel is on, the hotel pillow looks damp in most spots, probably from tears, or sweat, or both. There are a few feathers on the mattress, Vanessa assumes that Castiel will want to dispose of those in private, which she understands from having scales, she has had friends ask her for them and one has even tried to steal some.
"Sounds good, let me go change then we can go," Vanessa says as she walks out of the living room at up the large wooden stairs. As she opens her bedroom door she starts taking her soft t-shirt and pajama pants. She closes the door and throws on a black sports bra, an old AC/DC shirt, and a new pair of leggings that make her legs look great. She quickly grabs a ponytail from her nightstand and starts putting her bright pink hair up in a messy bun.
Dean holds his breath for most of it, they're so close that their hands brush together as they walk. Luckily it's somewhat early that barely any other guests are here to watch them almost hold hands.
"Yes. They are very aggressive, but they are a vital pollinator. Now let's see the next one," Castiel grabs Dean's hand this time making him blush, but thankfully nobody can see from the dim lights.
"I am gonna go and put my things away," Sam stands up and stretches. "Thanks for picking up our lunch."
"Don't call me that," Vanessa mumbles tiredly. "And it's none of your damn business."
"Then Friday would be great, the wait will suck because I don't have any plans," Vanessa mumbles, her eyes quickly glance up at Dean's.
"Hell yeah," Vanessa stands from her dusty stool. "Let's do some human fishin'!" She exclaims as she wipes dust off her butt.
Dean wipes a stray tear on her cheek with his thumb. "I get it, we
"Sorry princess" the tall man straightens up and towers over Vanessa.
am, she sighs as memories of what happened earlier come flooding back. She scrolls through her notifications, only now is she getting the distress message from Sam. Vanessa yanks off the blankets and stands up, stretching out her back and sighing as it pops her legs slightly itching but she ignores them.
Tim nods and slides into the back, Dean makes sure not to close the door on his feet.
"Well, I was gonna drive us up to a lake house just outside of Dallas, so it's an eight hour to and from so we'll probably stay the night," Dean grabs a steaming of what smells like coffee and brings it up to his lips.
"It was her favorite, which is why she sang it to me."
"Alright, I'm ready. Bobby, you don't have to come, we both know that I'll be more than enough." Vanessa says as she walks around the corner into her dining room. She's brushing her now slightly poofy pink hair, trying to put it in a bun. Dean quickly looks her up and down then looks away and slightly blushes. She's wearing a colorful tie-dye tank top with a black sports bra underneath, her leggings are a pretty shade of dark blue almost black that hits her legs nicely, and she's wearing plain black tennis shoes.
He quickly glances at Bobby as Vanessa walks to the bar to get their orders and asks "are the burgers really that good?"
"Vanessa" Bobby calls out as he climbs out of his car, "you better not be closing your door on my boys," he says as he walks into her view.
"What do you think? Getting out of the pool dammit."
"Sorry," Castiel shuffles to make his wings fit and not touch Dean at the same time. Dean rolls his eyes and purposely brushes his arms against the raven black feathers.
She wasn't reading it the other night, instead, she was fighting down an anxiety attack after she awoke from another nightmare. The book was from the Castiel and it is about angel wings, but it's not in German, it's in Russian. Vanessa can't even get an accent from reading, she just threw it on in a panic.
"Okay walk through the, no, through the door," Dean says as he tries to lead Vanessa through it, she stumbles out the door and starts sings 'Sweet Caroline'
"Anyway, we found where the small coven is and we prefer some extra firepower." Dean finishes. He fumbles with the sticker on his bottle as Vanessa takes in the information.
Dean focuses on finishing his sandwich and trying not to smile. "Well, thanks Cas, I'm sure these will be wonderful to read."
"Makes sense," Castiel shrugs, his right-wing slowly extends to wrap around Vanessa.
"You have fangs" Dean croaks, almost as if he hasn't used his voice a lot.
"Does this happen every time you blow your load?" Vanessa asks as she dumps the shards of glass onto the table. Her screen is as cracked as the TV is, but luckily she can use her magic to repair it.
"Next time" Dean mumbles as he cups her face
Hours after the failed capturing and with a belly full of sushi, Vanessa sinks into the very soft hotel bed and turns on the TV to some movie about snakes.
"Hunters" the other two hiss. One with a large nose and her hair in a long braid grabs the knife from the forehead of one of the witches and stands up.
"I think he's staring at you," Dean smiles, the eagle's eyes narrow on Castiel, almost as if he's mad.
"Really?" Castiel looks Dean in the eyes. His gorgeous blue eyes watch his every move with precision.
"Wings?" He asks.
"I dunno, aren't fossils hard to find? And underground?"
Vanessa saunters her way through the kitchen, her dad had left during the first round of drinks while her dragons are outside (masked as dogs) doing their business. Vanessa slowly crawls up the stairs to find Dean at the top, laying down.
"You can see my wings?" Cas says, making his wings spread out even more in surprise.
Dean sighs and wanders to his room, not really sure what to do with himself. Dean saunters into his room, throwing himself onto his bed and toes his shoes and socks off, not caring that he is still in his jeans.
"What? I don't wanna die or be stuck to the wall forever" Vanessa argues.
"Bobby!" Vanessa pulls her door all the way open, pushes her way past Sam and Dean, and runs to hug Bobby. She wraps her arms around him and gleefully says "it's been so long." They pull away from each other and walk back to her house "You look great!"
The other person on the phone sounds very upset, Dean watches in horror as Vanessa's eyes become watery, almost as if she's about to cry. "I'm sorry sir," she says, turning around to attend to the bacon. "Wait. She is dead? Then why are you yelling at me?" Vanessa pauses, "sorry, oh, it just came up? Well then, I can take another job instead."
"Hey, it's fine Cas, I really don't mind," She says truthfully.
The room is as long as it's wide, the large bed is in the middle of the back wall it has small tables with lamps on it. The room has tons of stuff in it, next to the door is a large bookshelf that almost touches the ceiling and on the other side of the door is a TV.
Dean shivers as Vanessa drags her tongue across the hem. "Nessie," he moans, Vanessa starts to tug his shorts down when Dean tries to flip them, but nobody is willing to admit that Vanessa did most of the work.
"He's right, you could stay," she says, tugging lightly on his shirt.
I apologize for this chapter being so late, it was my cousin's birthday recently so of course, we spent like 4+ hours on Thursday and Friday talking and playing games!
"He looks more like a Jim or a Jimmy to me," Sam hands over a can of warm beans that he just cooked on a campfire.
They finally pull away after what felt like eons (probably five seconds). Vanessa returns to Dean's side as Castiel leans on the island, his wings drooping as he relaxes. "How did you sleep?" He looks Vanessa up and down.
"Ah shit. I've gotta make breakfast," Vanessa slaps a hand on her face but doesn't move out of bed. "And dad left yesterday."
"By walking, plus, they could be hurt!"
"I've wanted to kiss the moment I laid eyes on you," Vanessa says as she quickly kisses him on the lips.
Slowly, Dean's eyes shift from the book on the table to the man in front of him. Tim's unnerving gaze meets Dean's.
Dean searches for his keys for only a minute, when he finds them he immediately heads for the front door and then towards his baby.
"Good morning" The gravelly voice of Castiel makes her jump back into her bedside table.
Thanking the cashier, they both head out to the car, Dean handing over the cereal before sliding into the driver's seat. Setting the keys into the ignition, a smile crawls onto Dean's face when he hears his baby's engine purr. "Alright," Dean says, his soda hisses as he twists it open. "We have only an hour left, so no more stops until home."
"It's beautiful dad." She cradles it in her lap.
"It's a gift Dean," Vanessa smiles. "Not the most traditional rock ever, but it's unique."
"That's good," Dean says, Vanessa moves her head and meets Dean's gaze. She gives him a sad look and shrugs. "I guess."
Vanessa walks over to the table and gently sets the egg down on the wood. Not feeling hungry, she declines Dean's offer of cereal and runs her finger over the cool surface of the egg.
"Dammit, Castiel!" She calls out a little bit louder, "I need your help again!"
Vanessa nods and bites her bottom lip. "I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner, " she says starting to try and sit up, "I understand if you dont wanna do this anymore."
"Describe them" Sam glares at the two.
"Oh, has your brother called yet? He should have by now," Daniel says, pulling out his phone to check the time.
The warm feeling of feathers doesn't vanish as they walk, rather, the sensation gets stronger as they continue on their path. They take a few minutes to look at the other animals (thankfully no more birds), the big cats are out lounging in the sun as they pass through.
"Is a kiss," Castiel grins, although Dean can't tell if it's mischievously or some other emotion he doesn't want to consider.
"Alright then," Dean says as he backs up onto the dirt road.
"Ah well," Sam smiles, he brings a hand up to his long hair and runs through it. "After you two left, Cas had gotten us more drink, found the strong stuff and I think he won, but it's just a blur."
"It's turkey bacon," Vanessa explains as she gets up from her seat to put bread in the toaster.
Vanessa lays the clothes on her bed to look at them, Castiel has chosen a soft t-shirt with a large fat bee on it (her aunt got her that as well as matching pajama pants) as well as light blue pajama shorts that she sleeps in regularly. Vanessa sighs and takes off the towel, wishing that she had a full-length mirror in this house she conjures one out of thin air.
"Sure, were-witches. Nasty son's a bitches too, they kept pelting me with rocks and all kinds of hex bags, made me see rainbows the next day" she says as she smiles at the memory.
y, he reminds himself,
"I didn't know there was chocolate with the same name," Castiel pushes his chair back. "But this is only if you want one."
Sam nods and sighs, "when we left it seemed like all he could think about was you. He wanted to call, he really did, but the first week we got swamped, same with the next couple of weeks. Then Bobby passed, and you showed up, but he wasn't talking to anyone, not even to me for the first few days."
With that Castiel walks off to find something to do as everyone else finishes their food. "Since Cas is back I think I'm ready," Vanessa says, taking everyone's plate.
put you to sleep."
"Alright, y'all will tell me who turned pretty boy Dean, and I'll think about giving you two fast deaths," Vanessa says, one with long black hair opens her mouth but all that comes out is a pitiful cry.
Dean caresses her cheek and presses a kiss on her lips, Vanessa sighs as Dean moves to hover over her. Dean breaks the kiss and leaves a trail of sloppy ones from her lips all the way down to her neck, going for the sweet spot. He licks just below her ear, drawing out her gills.
"Yeah, c'mon," Dean walks up to the first big habitat, which the sign above the glass says is a Burmese python.
"How festive," Vanessa smirks as she pulls the first one into her lap. She tears it open at lightning speed before Dean can even remember what it could be.
"It's nothing," Vanessa clears her throat and shoots Dean a small smile.
They quickly eat their breakfast and leave Tim on his log stool while they pack up the camp. "We need to bring him to the bunker," Dean whispers as he stuffs the folded tent into the trunk.
"I know you would have like a pie, but when I tried to make the filling it started to explode," Castiel looks down at his plate and picks at the chocolate frosting.
"That sounds about right, the chick is pretty cute," Castiel smiles, after a few moments they move on, grabbing a map from someone handing them out, Dean navigates them to the next big area—the North American area.
By the time they reach the Africa area, they notice that there are a lot more families here, most of them with little kids in strollers.
Castiel walks over to the table and sets down the books in front of everyone, curious, Dean sets down his almost finished sandwich and grabs the top book. He wipes off any remaining dust that's on the cover and reads the title.
Dean only wants to find a cool magnet or another kind of nic nack in case if they don't come back. He lets go of the angel's warm hand and tells him to go and see if ge can find something nice.
And that was the last straw. "F-fuck!" Dean cries loudly, knowing that Sam probably heard that. He shoots cum straight down her throat, but she doesn't spill a single drop. Vanessa pulls his boxer back on as well as his pajama pants and wipes her mouth.
"I wouldn't recommend it, " Bobby says "you'd have to feed 'em about two whole cows each a week. Not to mention the fact that they live for at least a couple hundred years"
"Dragons? Like the humanoid ones that kill virgins?" Dean asks alarmed, part of him wants to see them and the other half agrees.
"No need to apologize. Wanna watch a movie or something? I have Netflix on the TV," Vanessa pats the empty side of the bed invitingly. "But no shoes on the bed."
Byeeeeeeeeeeeee <3
"I'm going to go and get breakfast supplies," Dean stands up, his back popping as he stretches "you want anything?"
"Whatever, as long as it's good i dont care what you make."
Vanessa lets out a small sigh once it's off, Dean grabs one of her large breasts, barely fitting in his entire hand. "You're so beautiful, " he says, planting a kiss in between her boobs, he pinches one of her nipples as he licks and nibbles on the other one.
He pulls out the first goodie, which is a t-shirt that says mother of dragons and it has baby Drogon from Game of Thrones with his eggshell on his head. Dean picked out this one while Sam thought that it was a little lame to get it, but of course, Dean does not give a shit.
"Do you have lotion for them?" Dean asks, with a frown. Vanessa grumbles something too low for him to hear, even with his messed up vampire hearing.
"Yeah, a friend of mine makes swords and shit as a hobby so I got to use his set up" Vanessa explains, she lets out a loud yawn and rubs her eyes. "I'm going back to bed, Cas, I have books and shit, and Sam? Please stay on the couch, if you don't I'll tie you down to it, "
"Can you stop mentioning him," Dean whispers.
"Sounds good to me, I'll finally be able to drink one" she grumbles the last part as she stands up and heads to the bar. Dean watches lovingly as she leans on the bar to order the round of drinks.
"Dean, you want a cup? Dad also made coffee, I can get you some of that," Vanessa opens one of the cupboards and pulls out two mugs.
"Snap your fingers and poof! Things are in front of you." Sam says as he shoves a forkful of French toast. "Wi'hes I've met can' doo 'hat," he says with his mouth filled to the brim.
"Nessa?" Dean mumbles, he rubs his face as Vanessa opens the book to a random page.
Daniel slides a styrofoam box to Vanessa and a wrapped burger to Dean while sliding a container to Sam. "So who's this," Daniel gestures to Castiel as he unwraps his burger.
"Jesus fuck," Dean gasps as he sees Castiel suddenly appears next to him on the couch. "Cas, buddy, warning next time."
Vanessa sings happily, she uses her fist like a microphone as she sings.
All she does is smile as she continues at a slow and steady pace. With her free hand, that's not wrapped around the rest of Dean's cock, she softly runs her long nail across his balls and cups them, making him shiver. Vanessa starts humming an unrecognizable cheerful tune as Dean grabs her hair and bucks his hips up into her mouth.
"Yes, it's in the pot," Daniel motions at the kettle.
"How long will you two be gone?" Sam slurps up more of his oatmeal.
"I did not know it would happen, nobody has touched my wings like that," Castiel says lowly.
"I believe you humans have dubbed it an
The dragons run towards the kitchen but no one else moves. Sam, Dean, and Daniel have been chatting about how they spend the day together since Vanessa and her mom's side of the family doesn't celebrate birthdays, but that was up until Daniel went to pick up lunch Vanessa's requested birthday buffet.
At that Dean laughs. Vanessa whips around with three plates in her hands and a grin on her face. "Sam, sandwiches are done." Vanessa moves past Dean and sets the plates on the table.
With a silent comedic pop, they turn back to her regular ears and Vanessa doesn't waste a second putting the earrings in.
"You do know that she and her family are rich, right?" Bobby asks.
Before joining Castiel at the bar, she quickly grabs a plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, and a chocolate muffin along with a dainty cup of unsweetened tea.
"Great, now, why are you awake?" Dean grumbles.
"Where does she get the cows and how does she get the money?" Dean asks.
The third time Vanessa wakes up is from Dean giving her a small kiss on her neck, just below where her ear lobe would be. "Good morning Dean," Vanessa hums, keeping her eyes shut from the morning sun pouring in.
"Of course you can," Dean replies, humming as Vanessa rubs her warm cheek across his neck humming a faint tune as she goes.
I didn't get to visit my family up north for Christmas but we had a good one at our house, but hopefully, the next chapter will be out quicker.
"It's the least we can do. When we get home Dean will have to make you his amazing cheeseburgers," Sam buckles his seatbelt and leans into the seat.
"Well, I'm going to clean all this up, I hope you had a wonderful birthday today," Daniel leans over and kisses his daughter on her head and she hums in response. "I've got work tomorrow so I have to cut my visit short."
He turns to the other one and slowly opens it, he peeks inside to find that the room is completely dark and someone is sleeping in the bed.
"Hatch day?" Sam crosses his arms.
"Vanessa?" Dean's muffled voice calls from behind the door, Vanessa freezes, she knows what he's going to ask if she lets him in, but if she doesn't, he'll probably just come in anyways.
"I like all of them, but if I'd have to narrow it down, I'd say yellow." Vanessa shrugs. "Like a nice easter yellow or a yellow daylily color."
"Eww no, not during monopoly," Sam crosses his arms and watches Castiel land on 'go to jail'.
"Yes," Dean squeaks. "I-I want one." Castiel grins once more and moves to sit on his lap, his lips an inch from Dean's, the angel pins Dean in the chair as Dean cups Castiel's face.
Vanessa pauses to listen to the guy on the phone, Dean watches as she slowly frowns. "I'm working on it, she'll be de-" she gets cut off.
Vanessa squints at him again, her fin ears twitch as she clears her throat. "Soorry, goood moorning Deean," she slurs.
"You sleep well last night?" Dean asks before he returns to eating his delicious breakfast.
"Why is Sam not having any nightmares peculiar? I would think that's a good thing," Vanessa asks.
"We can put those back," Vanessa takes the shells back and tosses them farther out into the lake.
Once she fills them with different drinks, she takes a sip from her mug as she hands Dean his drink. He takes a breath in and the smell of coffee fills his lungs as he takes a long sip of the hot drink.
Vanessa kneels in front of Sam, moving his shirt out of the way and peeling off the bandage to find his cut nearly healed. "I never expected it to heal this fast" Sam says as he watches her hover her glowing hand of his wound and mutter words.
Or if Dean just had manned up and asked the angel out instead, it would have been fine too. Dean rubs his face tiredly, if he hadn't overreacted this would have worked out just fine.
A small groan escapes Dean as he scans over the isles, his eyes locking onto Tim's messy hair barely poking over a magazine rack. Chuckling to himself, Dean strides over to Tim, finding him with a small magazine in his hands and open on a page with flowers. "Find any snacks you'd like?" Dean asks, watching Tim flinch and nearly drop the magazine. "Didn't mean to scare you bud."
"No. It's a fucked up ostrich," Vanessa grins at the egg, turning it gently in her lap.
"Yes, but, I'll probably just do that tomorrow, I'm pretty tired," Vanessa says, turning her gaze from Cas to Dean "even if it's barely seven, saving your ass took a lot out of me, I could pass out right now!"
"F-fuck Dean, " she whimpers. Dean grins and continues to lick and suck as gently as he can on her gills, ignoring his now painful erection.
"Couldn't tell you, most of them were fossiled shells, I bet I could even find some right now," Vanessa shifts off of her back to look down into the murky depths.
"Can I touch them?" Dean asks not thinking before saying.
Dean scans over the bottom of the exhibit to find a massive snake coiled under a light. "Wow," Dean whistles when he lays his eyes on the snake. "That's fucking huge."
"That's nice," Sam mutters. Sam quickly looks around before asking, "so where is Vanessa?"
Dean sighs, turning the engine on and the radio. He heads for the exit debating on if he should call Castiel back or not. But he knows for sure that he should get on the road and that this mess is Sam's fault somehow.
"You ready?" Dean calls to Sam, who is now up and out of the tent.
"I've gotta pack for my bounty Dean, but when I come back...we'll have to do something," Vanessa grins as she moves to get up.
Castiel's wings shuffle as he stands straight up. "That
"Crumb cake, " Vanessa hums.
Once done, she drags it off the bed and rolls it to the door, thinking that she'll wake up, eat breakfast, say goodbye to everyone, and then head out. A perfect plan! Just got to hope Dean doesn't offer to drive Vanessa there.
Dean drums his fingers on the armrest of the couch as he watches the minutes slowly go by. It was currently five in the morning, almost six, but no one was awake beside him and Castiel. Castiel had decided he had things he needs to attend to so he left, but that was hours ago, Dean had spent all night not being able to sleep from almost being a vampire and reading at least a quarter of the books Vanessa owns.
"I don't see why not. Sam will be in there for a while, while freaking out over a couple of bubbles I accidentally made it explode and got it on the ceiling," Castiel giggles.
Her legs are red from shifting while her chest looks just as red with a clear outline of where the scales start, her larger fins that would be on her legs and arms have disappeared and all that is left are her gills, her ugly yellow eyes, and her fin-like ears.
"Don't. You. Start."
Dean closes the gap between them and grabs her hips. "Good afternoon technically."
"I said first to the water," she says before putting her hand on his chest and pushing him in, Vanessa dives right after him headfirst. The lake isn't that shallow nor is it clear, Vanessa lets out a muffled cry as her legs break and fuse.
"There's a bar near my house that serves the best burgers and beer in this entire city, so I say we go back to my and change because I have blood on my leggings and Sam you are drenched," Vanessa says as she buckles her seat belt and fiddle with her knife.
Dean lets out another deep moan as Vanessa goes as deep as she can, with his free hand he snakes his way down to her breasts and starts groping one of them. Pinching her nipple and then switching to the other one. Going back on what he said, Dean lightly drags his fingers across her top gill, Vanessa lets out a quiet moan and focuses on her slow pace.
"You never told me to do that," he argues, his ocean blue eyes turn dark as he continues to glare at him.
Vanessa freezes and looks at him, "he does?"
"Thanks for the help Dean," Sam grumbles as he pushes his legs off the coffee table and sits next to him.
He manages to grab the handle and open it a crack before he loses his grip on the handle and it slams close. "Dean," Vanessa says making him turn around. "I would like to share my bed, you just didn't let me finish. Hell, you didn't let me start."
"God fucking dammit, " Vanessa yells once she is free she then curses at herself for saying that, Vanessa grabs Castiel's coat and pulls him out the door.
"I've been in love with you Dean ever since I saw your soul in hell, you have one of the most gorgeous souls I have ever laid eyes on," Castiel says, a smile tugs at his lips.
"So whatta we gonna do today?" Dean asks, he takes another long sip.
"Well, you should've let it cool down," Dean tries not to laugh. Tim glares at him as he fans his mouth.
"Wow Nessa, this looks awesome," Dean holds up the fossilized tooth up to the sun. "I think this is a shark tooth," Dean holds out the rock for Vanessa to takes back, to which she pushes his hand back towards him.
"But with the way we play it, no one can cheat, you get zapped if you try," Vanessa leans back into the couch and watches her dad walk off towards the kitchen. "You know what? We should play, Cas have you ever played?" They turn their attention to the forgotten angel.
Vanessa nods, "Yup, I would speak it, but trust me y'all don't want to hear it, "
It was the next day and they thankfully haven't been murdered in their sleep, mainly because Dean made the man sleep in the Impala and he locked the doors. Now after the unexpected rescue mission, Dean has not only taught someone to put on pants but now it's a shirt too.
Sam pours the contents of the bowl into a coffee mug that has a llama on it and says, "it looked like he hasn't, but we'd have to ask him."
The angel shrugs and puts his book down. "Sure, but what's a zoo?" he asks as he slides off the bed.
"Nice to meet you to sir," Castiel nods his head.
"Alrighty then, I'll pack some weapons then we can go," Vanessa says as she shoves Malachite's tail off of her lap.
"Wake up Sammy, we're here," Dean says as he slaps his brother's leg, making him jolt awake.
Lir sings before getting hung upon.
"Alright then, you have any good books?" Bobby asks as he props his feet on the coffee table.
"Why are you awake," he squints at her. Right, humans don't have night vision. Vanessa chews on the inside of her lip as she listens to Dean's mumbling.
"Now for the best part, " she rubs her hands together as Sam shoots her a confused look. With a snap of her fingers, the door opens and she kicks the head into the room. In a blink of an eye, she changes back to her normal form as the other two vampires scream.
When she is done, she combs through that spot again to find that she had accidentally pulled out a feather. Vanessa holds it in the fingers, it's as long as her forearm but not long enough to be one of Castiel's primary feathers. Vanessa turns to look at him in horror, but his entire face is beet red, and he seems to be squinting at the TV.
The sun blinds Vanessa for a couple of seconds as she follows Dean down to the docks. "You're not gonna push me into the water, are you?" Vanessa asks as she scans the lake. It's a very large lake, a few houses are scattered around it, but they are so far away that Vanessa isn't worried. Thank the seas that this dock has a roof, they'll be swimming in about twenty minutes if it didn't have one.
Daniel turns to him, watching him pull out all the ingredients except for anything cold. "Do you have pie tins?" Dean asks as he turns on the oven.
Vanessa turns off her phone and looks around for something to do, she should probably tell Cas and Dean about the full moon situation, but upstairs is way too far. She sighs, she'll just tell them when food gets here, for now, Vanessa deserves a nap.
As the day slowly moves on from early in the morning to the afternoon, Sam and Dean help Vanessa get prepared for the full moon by helping her make a special potion.
Vanessa sighs, instead of dropping the weeping vampire, she raises her hand and slowly tears off his head. The largest vampire tackles Vanessa as the smaller ones run towards Sam. Vanessa uses her magic to push him off of her, gripping the knife in her hand she gets in a fighting position as the vampire gets to his feet. "I'm going to kill you...you...you dumb bitch" he growls.
"Oh, I meant literal rocks," Vanessa giggles. "They had huge amethyst geodes and other quartzes."
"Got it. Got it," Vanessa nods and glances out the window as they back out. "Would it be okay if I perhaps play music from my phone on the way there, then we can listen to whatever you want?" Vanessa asks and gives him her best puppy eyes.
She side-eyes him, "what?" She mixes in the scales with the wooden spoon as she opens the cabinet above the stove and pulls out a small plastic container.
"We should move to the bedroom," Vanessa moves her hair out of the way and licks her chapped lips.
"It's rude to watch, " is all he says.
She opens her mouth enough for his tongue to slip in. Castiel tastes sweet on her tongue, like fresh honey. They both groan when they hear Vanessa's phone vibrate, indicating that someone had texted her.
Vanessa closes her eyes, preparing to use her magic by wiggling her arms, from her fingertips all the way up to her shoulders, all of her veins light up pink. Sam gasps as he watches Vanessa turn into the dead vamp on the floor, her once beautiful brown eyes turn into dark, cold, blue ones. Her bright pink hair morphs into long messy brown hair, and Vanessa's tan skin turns pale white.
Vanessa smiles warmly at them. "No, but whenever someone mentions fish I get excited, but...um...just to let you know, I like salmon."
"Where am I?" The man sits up and Dean scrambles to his feet.
"Well, what's today?"
Alex Trebek's voice fills the small room, masking the sounds of the door opening and closing. The only way Dean knew that someone had entered was when one of the contestants blurted out eucalyptus and scared the shit out of Dean when they laughed at the wrong answer.
"Don't touch me, I might just breaking your fucking wrist right here right now" Vanessa growls as she slowly adds more and more pressure.
Dean chews on his lip and quickly looks back at the road, humming the song anxiously. This is going to be a long drive.
"So when I burn the map, the spell will save the piece where our target is located," Vanessa says, pouring the spell ingredients onto a map of the city.
"They are better than Vanessa says they are" Bobby replies with a slight grin. After a few minutes, Vanessa comes back with four bottles in her hand and two plates with large bacon cheeseburgers.
Vanessa gracefully flips herself onto her stomach, she pushes off the bottom of the pool with her hands and glides through the water to the surface. Once she breaks the surface she takes a deep breath of the cool air, smiling to herself as she slowly heads for the edge of the pool.
"I would like it, but you don't have to get it for me," Castiel says, reaching to take the necklace from Dean's hand. Dean recoils and turns to the counter.
"June 3, I expect to see you both there and bring Cas too," she boops him on the nose.
"Then what? If you are not sick then what is wrong?" Vanessa asks, she may not be a certified doctor, but she has had some "medical" training from her dad (which is just healing spells) and some mainly from her aunt who is a doctor.
"You've been kicked out before?" Dean snorts and smiles at the thought.
"What are we doing outside?" Dean asks.
"You'll understand when we get there. Now come on, I wanna get there before it gets too packed," Dean says, pushing the angel out the door.
"The smell? I had assumed since you've been somewhat turned you'd have sharper senses, " Vanessa matters to herself as she hops off the stool and walks over to the cabinet by the over the stove cabinet. She pulls out glass cups with kids and walks back to the pot.
"Australia?"
"I-It's fine, it happens when you do that," he replies softly.
"You made those?" Dean gasps as he watches the cobra lift his head and glance over at the squealing children to their right.
They pull apart slowly, not really wanting to but knowing that it could be important.
"No. More." Dean asserts, ripping the bottle out of her hand, instead, he replaces it with the potion she made yesterday, he next to him on the kitchen table. Vanessa glares at him while she tries and fails to take the cork out. When she finally does, she tosses it on the floor and snaps her fingers, the bottle flies out of his hand and into hers.
Castiel sucks in a gasp as his wings fluff wildly. "I. I think I'm gonna–" he cuts himself off with a moan and Vanessa moves her hand quickly.
"Yes, they are venomous, males have a barb on their feet filled with toxins," Vanessa confirms. "I am not venomous. Which I am glad I'm not, venom would just get in the way."
"Tomorrow?"
"Okay then, vamonos!" Vanessa unlocks the glass door and opens it, a cold gust of wind hits everyone, and Dean shivers. Vanessa is the first one out, skipping gleefully out the door. Sam is next, pretending that the cold isn't bothering him. And Castiel places a hand on Dean's shoulder and wraps a wing around his arm, forgetting that Dean can see it.
"Drop it-" the biggest one growls, pulling out a large knife and pointing it at Sam "-and him."
"Mmm," Tim says in response. Dean sneaks yet another glance at him, his eyes are watching the trees zip by as they drive.
"That is why you came here! To hide!" Maggie leaps to her feet making everyone else stand, "why didn't you go?"
"Shut up," Dean grumbles. He groans and rubs his entire face, he checks his phone, it's only a quarter past seven, but it's still early into the year that it's pretty dark outside and the full moon has risen.
Castiel sighs. "Of course."
Dean glances up at his brother, chewing his lip before glancing down at his phone. "Lay it on us," Sam says.
Vanessa slips out of bed, casting a ball of energy that could send someone to the moon if she threw it hard enough at them. Her veins and the ball of energy both light up a bright pink and blue, lighting her way to the door. She slowly and quietly opens the door and walks into the hallway to find someone in a large coat with large black appendages sticking out lean on the wall and limp towards her bathroom. She screams and shoots the blue ball at the large person, sending them flying way past the bathroom, the guest room next to the bathroom, and through the door of the other guest room directly across the hall from her room.
"Are you sure? I can help" Bobby says as he pats Malachite's side for her to get up.
"Hopefully she will, then she can meet these three," Daniel motions to everyone but him and Vanessa.
He nods. "What zong?" Vanessa asks.
Dean groggily opens his eyes, finding that he actually feels refreshed, that was probably the best sleep he has ever gotten...he should thank Vanessa for that. Speaking of Vanessa... Dean turns to his side to see Vanessa peacefully sleeping and hogging all the blankets. She made a little cocoon again, Dean leans down and plants a small kiss on her forehead before he turns to sit up.
"He said he'll be gone for a few days, he has to meet with our allies" Hadiya replies as she moves her own dark brown braid over her shoulder and on her back.
"I am Castiel," he says puffing out his chest slightly. "Angel of the lord."
"The fact that you used I–never mind," Sam pinches the bridge of his nose. "What are we supposed to do with him!"
"Dean wait," Sam follows after him. Dean weaves his way through the dense forest, over fallen logs and rocks, and in between trees.
"See, when you said that I thought of a concert type thing, but that sounds cool," Dean says dryly.
A couple of days passed when Sam and Dean bring their new "guest" home. The first day was rough, Dean had to explain a lot to Tim, one of them being how to work a shower, which went surprisingly well. But with no news from Bobby, Sam had taken it upon himself to scour the internet for any small piece of information.
"Well, I am thankful that you woke up before me to make it, instead of sleeping in and letting me be a good host," Vanessa lies, not wanting to tell him the whole truth and weird him out.
"Sure, " Sam says without looking away from the book. Dean pauses to see if Sam will complain about the noise when he doesn't Dean nods and heads to the kitchen.
"Cross my heart and hope to die," Vanessa shoots Dean a grin.
Speaking of Dean, he was the one keeping her trapped in his warm strong arms. Vanessa quickly looks down at her hands to see if they're still a bloody mess, which thankfully they aren't.
Dean watches her, not caring if Sam or Castiel will judge him, but once she bends down to take her pants off he gets a face full of inky black feathers. "Cas!" Dean cries as he tries to keep the soft feathers out of his mouth, "what the hell are you doing! Ack!" He spits out a feather.
"I dont know, fish? Wait, would that be cannibalism?"
"Sure...It's not that weird, is it?" Vanessa murmurs, sliding forward to rest her chin on the table.
After a few minutes, Vanessa's crying turns to hiccups. "I-I'm sorry Dean, I never...n-never ment to," she pauses to move so she can look Dean in the eyes, "I didn't mean to f-freak out earlier." She sniffs, "I just...it just...when someone mentions..."
Dean angrily fishes his keys out of his pocket as he exits the zoo. Now he wishes he had parked a little closer, but he is too angry to truly care.
"What kind of animals?" Castiel tilts his head and turns to Dean.
"Vanessa," Dean groans and shifts in the bed. Vanessa peels open her eyes and looks where the noise is coming from.
"It is currently eight-thirty and forty seconds, forty-one, forty-two, forty-" Vanessa cuts Castiel off. "Okay wise guy, I get it," Vanessa chuckles making Castiel grin, his feathers puff up around.
"Okay off please" Dean lifts his hands from Pluto's head. Pluto lifts his head up to look at him and pout, he slides off the couch and walks towards Bobby for more attention.
"It's not that bad, " Vanessa smiles "it's just that I lived in this house the longest, I don't like that cold, and I'm more accustomed to it, besides it has a pool and you know how important that is to me"
"Cas, look, there's a little baby." Dean leans on the railing separating them and the fence, and points to a small gray chick. His fluffy feathers make him look adorable in Dean's eyes.
The hours go by in a blur, they take a quick break to refill on gas and snacks, then it's back to joking around and singing every song that comes on; Dean even sings some pop songs with Vanessa.
Dean has never heard of a demon not reacting to holy water, but maybe one has learned to become immune.
"It's wonderful Cas, you guys did a great job," Dean grins as he blows out the candles. Sam sets plates in front of everyone along with a fork, pulling the candles out Sam cuts a piece of came for everyone.
"I hope he comes back soon," Vanessa says, then a sound echoes through the room, like someone trying to open a door with their hands full.
"Can I have it now?" Vanessa asks, licking her lips hungrily, knowing that her eyes are probably yellow.
"You want mustard or something?" Vanessa asks over her shoulder.
The first thing that they had done to Tim upon arrival at their camp was testing him with holy water and silver, which didn't work.
Dean gently shakes his head and grips the steering wheel hard. Trying to keep his mind focused on the road, he counts each pothole he drives over until one makes him bounce in his seat and he looks in the rearview mirror to find a pair of dazzling blue eyes staring back at him. Feeling the heat rise to his cheeks, Dean quickly looks back at the road and clears his throat.
She sighs when she hears the sound of wing beats. "With what?" Castiel asks, appearing right in front of her. His large black wings are spread out, but he slowly reels them back towards him.
Sam notices but doesn't say anything, not wanting to embarrass him in front of Bobby or Vanessa, instead he just smirks at him. Dean rolls his eyes and drums his finger on the table. She comes back with four in her hand and places them in front of everyone and sits down. "To a successful hunt!" She says before taking a long sip. Everyone else follows, Sam and Bobby still drinking from their first beers.
"You're on."
"This is a game show called Jeopardy, the dude in the suit will give the contestants a clue aka a question," Dean explains, his gaze turning back to the TV mounted on the wall. "And they have to answer it correctly to get money aka points."
, I'm not very proud of it, but you humans do seem to like it," Castiel sighs.
"Are yoou sure?" Vanessa asks, Castiel nods then Vanessa snaps her fingers, and the bag appears in her hand.
"Deanie, it's justa game Deanie," Vanessa hums as she brushes his sweaty hair out of his face.
Dean falls on his butt from the blinding light, he rubs his eyes and opens them. He looks up at the sky in confusion, he sees a comet in the sky. A huge comet...a blindingly bright comet...that sounds like it's screaming...Dean watches in awe as the comet comes closer and closer to the campsite until he realizes that it's not a comet. It's a person.
"Yes, unless you know you're name," Dean pauses to watch Tim shake his head no. "Then your name is Tim."
"Hey! He hasn't made a move last night," Dean grins.
"Over bacon?"
"Dean will probably want to stay with you while change," Cas says shifting nervously, almost as if he wants to add something.
"There is a cure for vampires we just have to hope that Dean hasn't drank any blood, " Sam says as he puts his blood-stained shirt on.
"One down" he calls out, the other had moved to the other rooms, but the sound of another gun makes him somewhat cheerful. He still doesn't understand why Vanessa only came in with a knife.
She groans and slowly sits up, with her eyes still closed. "What?" She mumbles, resting her face on her hand.
Vanessa nods as she starts scooping some of the gross smelling potion into the bottle. "It's not that they smell bad it's just that...that...they...all I can say about it is that they smell like heaven. Not like whatever our favorite scent is, no, literal heaven. Upstairs. Umm, the palace in the sky or whatever you wanna call it."
As I said before, feel free to leave kudos and comments! I try to respond to them as quickly as I can!
"It's barely nine-thirty Nessa, let it be ten before you start bugging me," Dean crosses his arms.
