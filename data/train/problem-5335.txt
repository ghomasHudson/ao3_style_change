"Of course, Dean." Castiel turns so Dean can’t see the reluctant relief on his face. "Let me get you something to wipe your hand off with before you go."
“Head on the pillows, on your stomach,” Cas commanded, watching expectantly. Dean scrambled to comply, shoving his jeans the rest of the way off before readjusting and flopping down face first into the pillows.
Cas meets an old friend of Deans
“Dean, this is serious, I’m not a good person. You shouldn’t want anything to do with me; you should be running for the hills as fast as you can,” Cas said, staring back at Dean incredulously.
Cas parries a thrust from what is
Dean stilled, not saying anything, Cas smirked and released his hand.
"Got tired of being somewhere that required, uh...pants, huh?" Dean asks with a wry twist to his smile. His hands are buried in the fur behind Taylor's ear now, not even noticing that she's smeared peanut butter on the leg of his own pants. Castiel can't stop his own answering smile at the two of them, comfortable in his living room.
Cas was immediately out of his chair and pacing the floor while Gabriel stood motionless watching his brother. After a few minutes, Cas collapsed onto the couch and looked up at his brother, tears in his eyes.
"Don’t doubt me, bitch," Dean grits out between clenched teeth. "I was selfish before, wanting my whole angel, and I’ll be selfish again and take what I can get."
Cas climbed up on the bed in one quick and fluid motion and had Dean’s chin in his grip just as quickly and unexpectedly.
Outside the windows he sees a rocky landscape, boulders of various sizes cluster amid scrub bushes and a handful of towering pines. About a hundred yards away, the ground abruptly falls away as a cliff face of an indeterminate height reveals a shimmering body of water. Terror freezes Dean as he realizes what's coming next.
"Here. As in…?"
Castiel, clutching at his throat and still trying to regain his breath, looks up at the angry words. The sight his eyes land on makes him choke all over again.
? With a man who looks eerily like Cole Trenton. Immediately after comes some random villain number four. Dean drops his cog and rushes into the fray.
"Don’t hurt my feelings, Cas," Dean lures. "Come on, you never even borrow a cup of sugar. What kind of neighbors are we?"
“Nothing would make me happier Mr. Winchester,” Cas manages to croak out as he stares back down at his hand. “Let’s do it soon,” Cas blurts out then looks up questioningly at Dean.
“What the hell are you watching?” Gabe asked, glancing over at Dean questioningly. Dean shrugged and tossed the remote on the couch between them, attention still on his phone.
“Dean, if you really want to stay in we can, that’s fine, but I’m not letting you mope in your bedroom alone all weekend okay? I will however allow you to mope in the living room, while watching movies and playing video games with me, deal?” she asked, to which Dean nodded silently, a small, thankful grin on his face.
Throughout the day they cleaned the bunker and then went off to do their own thing, after being stuck in a car together for nine hours the day before they were both looking for a little space. Sam found himself once again settled in an oversized armchair with his laptop, scrolling through more ‘Angel of Thursday’ posts. There was close to a year's worth of longing and pining and want which Sam lost himself in, not really thinking, just reading and scrolling, reading and scrolling.
A quick, hard, stinging slap landed on the thigh of his good leg.
“Because Dean, you’re different. I can already tell. You’ve been here more than once, longer than just a few hours. You’re not some oversized steroid loving asshat who thinks they’re above everyone else. Sure, you have an attitude and I can easily see how you’d be infuriating from time to time, but you’re sweet. You obviously care deeply about people; you have a kind of softness to you that doesn’t detract from your sharper edges. You’re a lot like the person Cas had before...the one who I think could have made him believe that he was worthy of love,” Gabriel’s gaze dropped to the floor as he let out a shaky sigh before looking back up at Dean, his eyes focused and intense, but brimming with unshed tears.
If you don't want to read the smut, just stop after Cas has seen all of Dean's tattoos :)
That last thought sends a surge of courage through Castiel. Dean wants him. Cursed or not, Dean wants him.
“That’s okay, Dean, I know we are still learning each other and I didn’t make it clear if this was a scene or not. Do you want it to be?” Cas asked, voice husky. Dean thought about it, then nodded hesitantly. A wicked grin spread across Cas’s face, that glint in his eye that caused Dean to forget exactly how to breathe.
“No,” Cas answered quickly.
"I can think of a lot of things to be sorry for, Cas." Dean closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. "Most of all, for everything it took for us to get here."
“Oh do you?”
“I’m glad you’re okay, Dean,” Cas said, his eyes flitting back up to Dean’s then quickly down again. Cas let out a sigh and started pacing the floor, hand coming up to the back of his neck, clearly anxious and uncomfortable.
“That’s not true Cas, you know it,” Dean said quietly and placed a kiss on Cas's neck before snuggling back in and focusing on the movie. Cas stayed quiet, staring at the ceiling, mind reeling with the plan he’d been working on and what the next few weeks may look like. Maybe if he came out the other side he would do as Dean suggested. Maybe he could fix one of the biggest regrets he had.
“I was young, Adam. Don’t you think I was fucking terrified?! I was fourteen when I watched my brother be murdered in front of me. I was sixteen when I started taking out those who killed him. I was seventeen when I found out one of them was someone both Michael and I had considered a close friend, hell, family even. I was twenty when I finally finished the job, when I finally killed the last man who had gone against my family. Two years later I walked away, placed a target on my back and just left, and do you want to know why Adam? Because I didn’t care if I lived or died anymore. I have so much blood on my hands; I’ve killed so many people and all before I was even legally considered an adult. I’ve done so much fucked up shit to people who didn’t deserve it. I never thought I would care about my own life again, how could I, after all I’ve done?” Cas was practically yelling now, the anger he had buried boiling over and flowing out of him freely with every word.
Dean just raises an eyebrow again, the blatant look of disbelief escaping neither of their notices.
“Sure, sounds good!” Dean agreed. Then he looked down and appraised his own attire. “I should probably go get dressed, huh?”
CW/TW
“Good, if you need me to stop, or need to safeword tap my leg three times okay?”
During the times the bunker was quiet and no phones rang Cas tended to binge shows on Netflix or wander around the internet, reading articles, watching YouTube or whatever seemed to grab his attention at any given time. That’s how he first discovered social media and the multiple platforms available. None of which he had ever felt compelled to make an account for.
Please don’t lose faith in me
Dean recovers first. "I was thinking, maybe we should hang ou—"
Only two steps away from their fenced yard Taylor immediately flops over on the road verge to roll in the tree’s fallen white petals. Castiel smiles as Dean rolls his eyes and starts talking to the contented pup. Probably saying something like, "Really? We haven’t even made it past the block."
Of course—Anna had fallen from heaven because she had wanted to know what it would be like to be human, to settle her roots somewhere and grow. It was natural that her grace would reflect her desires. Would plant itself into the ground and sprout into a magnificent tree.
Hannah clears her throat, and Charlie realizes she’s just been standing there, grinning like an idiot. Whoops. "Well, Castiel, I believe you said your translations are located at your home?"
Dean and Cas have a discussion
Dean watched on incredulously, anger simmering at being so blatantly ignored. “You’re not the boss of me, I don’t even fucking know you. Let me out, I’ll go get my own god damn drink,” Dean said, scooting closer to Castiel, who glanced at Dean out of the corner of his eye. He slowly grabbed his drink, brought it to his lips and took a sip savoring the burn it left in its wake, taking absolutely no notice of Dean or the fact he was trying to leave the booth.
"Uh, shit, sorry…zoned out a bit." Cas chuckles awkwardly. "What did you say?"
-light teasing via text message
He hadn’t noticed the figure still lingering in the doorway and almost misses Cas nearly whisper “please believe me when I tell you I would heal you if I could,”
"Yeah, the market. That must be it," Dean says, standing with a smile, fake and forced this time. The words leave Castiel feeling hollow even though this is what he wanted, Dean to still be safely in the clear. "I should probably get back to it." Dean brushes his hands off on his pants, cringing slightly when his fingers find the peanut butter Taylor smeared on the fabric.
“Come on Cas, you can look at my ink later, I want you now,” Dean all but whined. He leaned back in toward Cas but was stopped by a hand in his hair again, yanking him away which caused him to huff in annoyance.
“Really? That’s it?” Dean scoffed.
"Yeah, that’s probably not a terrible idea," Cas says, eyes following Charlie’s stare before shaking his head and leading Hannah into his own home. Charlie trudges over to Dean’s house and lets herself in, not bothering with knocking.
"…You’re right," Castiel nods after a long quiet pause. "It’s just… difficult to accept at times."
“Wait…did Cas and Alfie date?” Dean squawked as he sat up in the chair and looked over at Gabriel, mouth hanging open. He just couldn’t see it. Alfie was around Dean’s age as far as he could tell, he seemed plenty smart and responsible, but he was quiet. He wasn’t someone who seemed to argue or ruffle feathers. Cas would have gotten bored with the boy quickly, or maybe Dean was just too difficult and Cas really preferred the quiet and obedient guys. Thankfully, before that line of thinking could descend into a full fledged anxiety spiral, Gabriel’s loud laughter cut through the night air, pulling Dean out of his head and directing his focus back on the man next to him.
As his pace began to become erratic and irregular, Dean clung to the carpet beneath him, his lungs burning with the lack of oxygen and his face a mess, not to mention his dick smashed against the metal bars, wanting nothing more than to fill and find release. When Cas’s hips stuttered, and he slammed back into Dean's abused mouth one last time, Dean swallowed down every possible bit of release that spurted down the back of his throat.

Cas had actually stumbled upon some of Bobby’s books covering PTSD and trauma responses over the last few weeks when rifling through the shelves trying to find something to something to pass the time as Dean laid in bed, unconscious, and Cas unable to heal him, going out of his mind with worry. He knows that’s most likely what this was, Deans head trying to handle the events of the past few weeks, past few years really, and Dean is stubborn, most likely trying to fight against the feelings being dredged back up, trying to lash out with anger (which explained the broken figurine shattered on the floor), not listening to his limits and trying to push through them (probably how he ended up on the floor), this stubborn beautiful man would be the end of Cas, he was sure of it. Without thinking much about it, so as not to talk himself out of it, Cas reaches over and gently touches Dean’s face, and much to his surprise Dean leans into it, eyes slowly refocusing and then gently closing, seeming to soak it in, like he is worried it will be taken away from him any second. Cas smiles slightly, relaxes back into the mattress and tentatively removes his hand from Deans face, slinging it around his shoulders instead, not pulling Dean closer, but allowing him to wiggle his way across the few inches between them, pressing his body against Cas’ side, throwing an arm over his chest and laying his head on his shoulder. Cas tightens his grip around Dean's back, not too binding, allowing Dean to scoot away if he decides to, but secure enough that Dean knows he is protected, that Cas won’t allow anything to happen as he sleeps. Dean lets out a contented sigh, and for perhaps the first time since Cas had met him, looks at peace, or at the very least relaxed.
When he really looked at Cas’s brother, the man looked exhausted. There were deep, dark circles under his sunken eyes and his body language was nothing like the self-assured swagger he had had over a week ago when he interrupted Dean and Cas.
Closing his eyes, he turns to the east. The late spring morning still holds a chill, but the rising sun that blazes red behind his eyelids also warms his face, the dichotomy bearing witness to his renewed humanity. The crisp, sweet air rushing into his lungs in the brief moment of calm settles him. In a moment, the birds will burst into song, and the rest of the world will come alive along with him.
Blindly he made his way across the waiting area, past the nurses station, and shoved his way into the doorway of what he knew was Dean's room. The man laid on a stretcher, chaos surrounding him, nurses and doctors rushing around for bandages, saline, pain meds and anything else they needed. Just as a pair of nurses noticed him and began to shove him out of the room, Dean's eyes flicked open and glanced his way, recognition sparking. Cas yelled over the nurses that he was there, that he would be there when Dean woke up, that he would be okay and that he wasn’t going to leave him alone before he lost sight of those glazed green eyes.
“Dean…” Cas says, tone firm and scolding, clearly eager to get an actual answer out of this insanely frustrating man.
Cas let out a huff that sounded more like a chuckle, he couldn’t help it, he was happy, elated, for maybe the first time ever, at least for the first time without ramifications. “Dean, I already bared my soul to you, I already laid myself bare to you and said all I could possibly say on the matter, but I suppose that wasn’t enough. Dean Winchester, you are the most important person to me, the reason I am who I am. You’ve taught me about true strength and hope and most importantly compassion and love. I love you and would very much like to, what do the kids call it, ‘go steady’ with you.”
The Empty lets out a dark chuckle, trying to hide the panic as Castiel slowly but surely shoves it away and puts distance between them. "No? Tell me, Castiel. When have you ever been wanted for anything other than your special angel powers?" the Empty asks, gaining confidence once again when Cas falters slightly. The dark entity quickly continues, stalking languidly across the floor.
He opens the door to Dean's room and is met with the man laying on the bed, a smile plastered on his face and suddenly Cas realizes that this man brings him a level of happiness that he had never before experienced. The thought that maybe they could both finally get what they had been missing for so long, that they never thought was an option for them and that they could do so together brings a smile to Cas’s face. He walks across the room and gives Dean a kiss that he hopes speaks for him and expresses everything he can’t put into words.
Cas makes sure Dean is taken care of
-Past character death
"It has to be," Sam says grimly.
Something clicks in Cas’s brain. He nods at Charlie before addressing Hannah. "Even if I were to just let the police handle this, Hannah, it’s Dean. I’m going to worry sick and not be able to focus on work." Cas closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. "I need you to leave, Hannah. I’ll work on translating once my brain is back in a better place."
“Ye...yes, Castiel,” Dean stammered out as he reached for the door handle. Cas reached out and grabbed his hand that had been feeling along the door for the lever.
Before Dean could miss the feel of Cas’s stubble on his face he felt the man’s hand on his thigh slowly start trailing fingers up and down, inching closer and closer to where Dean really wanted them with each slow pass they made. After a few dozen lazy grazes that set every nerve on high alert, Cas removed his hand and Dean audibly whined and looked over at him.
As they hoisted it off him, the pain knocked the breath out of Dean. Suddenly he could feel every single break and tear in his bone and muscle. He fell back and let out a guttural scream, not giving a flying fuck about any crap the guys would give him for being a baby about it. He was pretty sure every single nerve ending in his leg was on fire.
“Cas?” Dean croaked out, voice hoarse and gravelly. He wasn’t sure if he was really seeing the man he knew. Cas’s usually brilliant blue eyes were dim and underlined by dark, deep circles. His clothes were rumpled and it was clear he had been in them for days; he looked small and scared.
“What the...how...why?” Dean sputtered out.
Cas's brother shows up with some concerning news
This wasn’t the same. Dean had had an accident, no one was after him. He would get patched up, be sent home, and be fine. So, why was Cas so angry? Why was he seething and scrubbing his hands again, like he had done eighteen years ago?
“Thank you dear boy, you are as well,” Cas said as he placed a kiss on Dean's forehead as he nestled into his pillow “Happy New Year Dean.”
“You still are not yet allowed to come, but soon, I promise,” Cas said, voice all but wrecked now that he was inside Dean. Slowly he began rocking his hips, pulling out just a bit then rocking back into Dean, hitting his prostate every few thrusts.
The Garrison had a reputation that a lot of the local trouble makers weren’t very fond of; it’s why they were now after Cas. They knew his history too, and some of them had very valid vendettas against him and were now in powerful positions. Cas's name was no doubt at the top of some of their lists, hell, the entire family probably was.
In the end, he settles for just watching her go.
This neighbors-in-suburbia scenario was supposed to have been like a vacation, to give them whatever time they needed to get back to normal. Sam encouraged it.
“Just hold me...pl-please,” Cas stuttered out, eyes brimming with tears when he looked over his shoulder at Dean.
Looking around the empty house and then back to Gabriel, he smiles at his brother before closing his eyes and focusing.
He’s completely useless. He’s failed. A failure.
“What’s wrong Cas?” Dean asked, while taking in the mounds of food Cas set in front of him: pancakes, bacon, waffles, sausage, fresh fruit, and multiple different types of syrup.
really were.
Cas chuckled again. “Dean, you don’t scare me, you don’t intimidate me, I’ve gone toe-to-toe with individuals much scarier than a 20-something with a bad attitude and a lack of self control.” His tone was almost passive, uncaring as he glanced toward the bar just as a waitress was making her way over to them. Setting both of the drinks down, Cas grabbed the water and slid it over in front of Dean who glanced down at it and shoved it away.
“Right, yeah, I’m ready Castiel,” Dean said, readying himself again, his dick somehow still painfully hard and leaking onto the bedspread beneath him.
They are both determined to hang on no matter what life throws their way. They both know that over the last decade this thing between them was often the only real thing in their lives, the only safe haven in a sea of turmoil, fear and pain. That this is the one thing they can always rely on, always come back to, and tomorrow that will finally be made even more tangible, it will finally be indisputable that he loves Dean and that Dean loves him.
Castiel’s hand rises to his throat, where his grace should be. When did he lose it? Not taken from him, not this time. His eyes lock with Dean’s. He knows that look. Self-blame. Beautiful Dean Winchester, who always puts himself on the altar of sacrifice, always racing his brother and Castiel himself to be the one to lay himself down under the knife.
“Whoa...this is….wow,” Dean said, totally playing it cool, obviously. Cas had made his way into the kitchen and grabbed a couple water bottles out of the refrigerator, throwing one over to Dean while he nodded his head toward the large sofa. Dean set the water on the floor and yanked off his old work boots before he grabbed the bottle again and took off down the couple steps into the living room. He made his way over to the couch where he unceremoniously flopped down and sunk into one of the most comfortable couches he had ever sat on.
will be the time that he sees Dean, confirms with his own two eyes that the man isn't too rattled from Castiel's violence and abrupt departure. Dean's '67 Impala stays parked in the driveway, and there seems to be no sign of movement from within the house.
"It’s not going to work, Dean." Not-Meg smirks as she walks around Dean. "You see, Castiel made a deal. And I’m not happy when deals are broken."
Dean didn’t have to be told twice and grabbed Cas’s arm as they were spit back out of the black goo, deposited in the same room where Cas had said goodbye. Sam had quite quickly hugged Cas and welcomed him home as did Jack before making a very hasty exit, closing the door behind them. Before Cas had even been able to turn around Dean was on him, a large hand pulling at his shoulder to spin him around and then enveloping him in a full bodied hug, pulling Cas into him rough and desperate.
"Cas… I… you… you came back to me," Dean stammers, still not quite believing his eyes.
“Uh, yes, fuck, yes please Castiel,” Dean practically begged, and he didn’t care one bit about just how needy he sounded. Cas chuckled as he slowly got up and out of his chair and stalked his way over to Dean.
For now, he allows it to surround him as he slips out of consciousness and into a dreamless sleep.
Cas carried Dean into his room and dropped him onto his king sized bed, following right behind him and trapping him on the bed, trailing kisses down his neck, down his chest and stomach, stopping at the waistband of Dean’s jeans, glancing up for permission. He was met with Dean eagerly nodding. Chuckling, Cas popped the button on Dean’s jeans, pulled down the zipper and shimmied them off as Dean lifted his hips to help. Cas mouthed at Dean through his black boxer briefs, a wet spot already starting to spread on the front of them. Dean threw his head back and canted his hips up earning him a smack to his inner thigh.
“Yes, Castiel,” Dean responded, breathless.
“Alfie? I was down there last night Gabriel, the kid is confused,” Cas said, still trying to catch up to the current conversation.
Dean pops the caps off of two of the beer bottles. "
"Delinquent," Dean says after catching up to his dog and calming her down. She sits by his side, happily wagging her tail.
"Send me back!" Dean slams his hands on Sam’s table and points back to Cas’s still form. "He’s still there. He needs me.
The next time he wakes up feels a bit more normal, no gasping for breath, no dazed comprehension, just eyes slowly flicking open, the lingering pain of injuries seeping into his awareness and for the first time he notices his stomach grumbling. How long has it been since he ate or drank anything? He assumes Cas wouldn’t have let him go longer than a few days, but he didn’t eat, so maybe he forgot Dean needed to. He groans as he slowly rolls onto his back, he is sore and achy, his wounds pull and some send off shooting pain in protest to being disturbed, by the time he is on his back he is panting, trying to breath through the pain radiating from his right shoulder, back. left thigh and hip. He closes his eyes, finds whatever resolve he has and forces himself to sit upright, head swimming a bit at the sudden change, Dean gives himself a minute to acclimate and steady his breathing once again. This was for the birds, he just wanted to get out of bed and go to the bathroom and find something to eat, this should not take him an hour to accomplish, why did he still hurt? He realizes he never had gotten a full rundown of his injuries from Cas, remembering their last conversation made Dean pause his seemingly futile attempts of leaving the bed, instead remembering the weary look on Cas’ face, the exhausted body language, how he had snapped at Dean when he had just tried thanking him for his valiant rescue, what the hell was that about? Dean had been trying to say thank you, had been trying to make sure Cas knew he was grateful and appreciated him, and Cas had interrupted and told him to fucking stop? Dean knew in the back of his mind that he shouldn’t be angry at Cas, that he obviously had stuff of his own he was dealing with, but Dean is angry, at Cas, at Alastair, at his damn body that doesn’t seem to want to heal or work correctly even after what seemed like weeks of unconsciousness.
Dean takes a deep breath, trying to regulate his breathing back to somewhat normal again.
“We should get our own place,” Cas suddenly breaks the silence. He isn’t sure where all these bold ideas are coming from, but so far they’ve been working in his favor. He continues staring up at the ceiling, Deans fingers mindlessly fiddling with the ring on Cas's hand laying between them on the bed.
Cas gently ran his thumb along Dean’s lower lip and hooked it over his teeth, tugging Dean’s jaw open and slowly inching his way inside. Dean immediately started working his tongue over Cas’s silky length as he worked toward the back of Dean’s throat.
“Like what?” Dean asked softly, eyes studying the drops of water running down his window.
Come yell at me on
“Charlie…” Dean tried again. She huffed, threw her hands up, and spun around to look at Dean.
Dean settles in a bit
brief mention of past relationship in which one person was underage (15 & 20)
It’s the face that is there when he closes his eyes, the face that prevents him from getting anything resembling restful sleep, the face that had been the one constant during his time in hell, the one who taught him how to hurt, how to maim and how to terrify. Alastair had shown Dean who he really was, how twisted and truly sinister he could be when given the chance. Now he once again had Dean at his mercy, and Dean knew what he was capable of. He wasn’t sure if it was better or worse having first hand experience being on the receiving end of Alastair’s torment. On one hand he could steel himself; he didn’t have to guess how bad it would get, didn’t have to wonder if he would make it out alive. He knows how this always goes, and he finds himself paralyzed with panic as memories come screaming back to the surface, putting him right back on the rack with that same face sneering down at him.
Dean does his best to hold him together
“They got to me Cas; they’ve been watching you for months. Adam’s side. I don’t know about the others. He came to me and told me about him and Michael, and threatened some of my kids. I couldn't let them get their fangs into them, they’re good kids.” Gabe hurriedly explained, not looking at Cas.
“Oh Cas, are you okay? Can I do anything to make it better?” Dean asked helplessly, inching closer.
"I should have asked you to stay," Dean says, and his voice is full of the purest pain. "But I couldn’t." He isn’t talking to Castiel.
CW/TW
“Okay, so where did you go after Michael was killed? You ran and you didn’t come back for years. Why weren’t you here helping me?” Cas asked, a flare of anger sparking within him. Adam let out a sigh and hung his head.
"Um, no, of course not, I just— well, I forgot that I've already shifted my porn collection to the bedroom, as it should be. You know, the porn. And the things."
-withdrawal
Sam lets out a sharp breath. "Listen, we’ll figure something out when Cas wakes up. We’ll get some grace… last time he used the grace from some other angel... or we’ll do a spell, or—"
All too soon Cas got up, gently pulling out of Dean and placing a kiss on each dimple on Dean’s lower back, humming contentedly as he did. After tying off and disposing of the condom, Cas made quick work of the rope attached to Dean's arms, kissing the inside of each wrist after undoing the rope, checking them over for any injuries and seeing none. He looked down at Dean, a warm smile spreading across his face as the younger man cracked open an eye and glanced up at him, a pleased and content smile plastered on his face.
“It’s a kraken. I thought it looked badass,” Dean explained, not meeting Cas’s eyes. Cas placed a finger under Dean's chin, lifting it so he was forced to make eye contact. Cas simply stared at him, eyebrow raised, knowing that was not the extent of this lovely piece of work. Dean sighed heavily and rolled his eyes.
“Honey, I’m home,” Dean calls as he turns the corner to the hallway that leads to their room before he stills, taking in what’s in front of him.
It’s Dean.
Cas learns what Zachariah wants from him
“Wait, wh...I uh, I don’t…” Dean sputtered, his brain not able to land on any one fully formed response. Gabriel closed the refrigerator door and turned toward Dean, clearly entertained by his inability to form words.
Dean comes to some unsettling conclusions
Dammit, couldn’t he just have one nice night with Castiel for once?
“Yeah, because that sounds like me,” Dean rolled his eyes and impatiently checked his phone. After a few minutes, in which Dean absolutely did not check his phone every few seconds, it vibrated next to him with a less than stellar response.
"You tell me, Dean. One moment I’m working and the next, Charlie comes barging into my house to tell me you’ve been kidnapped!  We ran back to your place and Taylor was in the yard, barking like she’d lost her mind. She led me this way while Charlie ran to go find the police!"
“Cas,” Dean said, tone full of admiration, finally turning toward the other man, “I trust you…you’re not…you’re not him, I…you could do anything to me, I wouldn’t be afraid. I know you would never really hurt me…and I know if I used a safe word you would stop, immediately.”
"No one looks to you for anything, anymore. No one cares. You’re nothing. You’re as empty as your name suggests," Castiel spits out, frustration turning to spiteful anger.
Dean shrugs. "Go for it."
“Okay, but what…” Dean stopped yelling when Charlie walked back in his room, joint in hand. Taking it, he continued. “But what if he says he doesn’t want to see me again, I don’t know if I can deal with that,” Dean said wistfully as he exhaled a large cloud of smoke, muscles relaxing already.
“Yes, Castiel. I’m sorry.”
“I didn’t want to mess up what we had, I couldn’t lose you,” Cas responds just as quietly. His arms wrapped around Dean’s waist, unwilling to let him go. “You know, you could have said something too.”
When he glances up he is met with Alastair's piercing eyes, staring intently at him, as if he knows the places Dean's brain had been, enjoying the varied emotions playing out across his face, the fear, the near hysteria, the overwhelming crushing depression and sadness, the anger and ultimately the resignation of the current situation. Dean focuses on accepting the impending pain, knowing there's no way out, knowing what this demon is capable of, remembering what he experienced thousands of times in hell. But this was different; they were now topside and he knows that means physical injuries won’t be erased for a clean slate the next day, he knows he won’t be given the chance to opt out of his own pain, he knows Alastair can hold one hell of a grudge and, if he lives long enough, he knows this will be drawn out for days, maybe even weeks.
Dean plans a date
“Gods no, gah, I can’t even…I don’t want to...no Dean, they have not ever been together,” Gabriel said shaking his head, Dean assumed trying to erase the mental images his question had conjured.
I’m not sure Dean. I don’t know what my schedule looks like yet. I’ll let you know.
Dean isn’t sure why he’s longing for something he never really had anyway, he’s always been the strong one, always been the one protecting Sammy, the one assuring Bobby he was okay and would handle whatever present threat they were dealing with, always the shoulder to cry on for his friends, patting backs and wrapping his strong arms around others. He was always the one silently breaking down in the dark of a dirty cheap motel room while Sam went out for a run, crying alone in the Impala on some desolate country road after a hunt where he just couldn’t save everyone despite what he thought were his best efforts, falling to his knees on an empty dirt road shouting out into the lonely night engulfing him asking the stars above why he is the one who has to save everyone, why this pressure is on him, why he can’t have a regular simple life. Not even asking for a happy one, just a simple blue collar American life, not this hell scape he had been forced into.
"Cas, please give me a chance to say it back to you, every day for the rest of my life. Happiness… happiness doesn’t have to just be in the being, Cas, it can be in the having too."
Castiel swallows and nods before turning back around.
"Yeah, she's adorable, alright. Though, don't go saying that to her; she has a reputation to maintain, after all." Dean smirks while taking a sip of his beer. Castiel has always loved their playful banter and this just proves how precious they are to him, including their talks and the time they spend together. He wouldn't trade this for the world.
Both Dean and Gabriel were exhausted, not only physically--worrying about an actively detoxing man whom you care deeply about is not the most conducive to getting anything resembling sound sleep--but mentally and emotionally as well. Cas had started yelling, ranting and raving often for no real reason, only to be crumpled on the floor crying a minute or two later; trying to keep up was draining to say the least.
In the end, Dean settles for rubbing the ropes against each other. Fortunately, the knots are loose enough so he can shimmy his wrists around. It doesn't give him enough slack to completely free himself, but it does give him some freedom of movement, lets him stand up and do a strange sort of hop around to assess the situation.

Dean spirals
Continuing his mental self-assessment, he knows his face is fucked. Split lip, one eye almost totally swollen shut, most likely broken bones, including his nose which was proving difficult to breathe through. He licks over his dry, blood-crusted lips and hesitantly feels around inside his mouth, tracing each tooth with his tongue. Thankfully it seems they’re all accounted for, and Dean considers that a small win. As he continues the number and severity of his injuries becomes increasingly clear. Pain rips through his torso and he finds it difficult to separate the different sources of pain because they’re all blending together. He’s pretty sure a blade had pierced his abdomen at least once or twice, hopefully missing anything vital. He can tell at least a handful of his ribs are definitely broken. His back is on fire, and it feels as though the skin has been flayed off. He can feel the rawness of countless open wounds and he remembers the whip, knows his back is a mess of angry criss-crossed gashes. The whip had broken skin almost immediately, with Alastair not holding back, working up to swinging with his full strength after only one or two passes. He recalls hearing the loud crack snapping through the air and almost instantaneously he feels the first hit land in the center of his back, causing white spots to dot his vision, biting his lip and trying his best not to cry out at the sharp intense pain, not wanting to give Alastair that satisfaction that easily.
“I swear to whatever forsaken deity you call God if any harm comes to him...” Cas threatened before being cut off.
Castiel relaxes, but only minutely.
Thankful Dean can’t see his giveaway expression from the kitchen, Castiel forces another lie in answer. "I, uh, just needed a change of pace." He cringes at himself. Hopefully Dean can't see right through his transparent attempt to remember the cover story he devised. He hadn't expected to be faced with the man up close so soon. However, Dean appears not to notice.

“You boys were always so dramatic.”
“Come back here, ya creep,” Dean huffed, words slurring together slightly as he closed his eyes again and burrowed into the pillows.
"Uh, oh, hey Dean, what’s uh, what’s going on?” He stutters out, his chair scraping against the floor as he quickly stands and exits the room.
After he finally came to the last--well, technically the account's first--post he simply stared at the wall across from him. There was something nagging in the back corners of his mind, he sat and thought, trying to figure out what it was. When he made the connection the laptop just about slipped off his lap, but he caught it just before it crashed to the floor. He hastily set it on the library table and walked off a bit bewildered, going to call Eileen and tell her of his discovery. He had known it for years, but to actually see it spelled out in front of him made it much more real and he hoped his brother would get his head out of his ass and figure it out soon too.
Yeah, he could allow himself to be happy for tonight; his problems would keep until morning.
“Yeah, yeah, that’s probably a good idea,” he agreed, his voice small, barely audible.
“I’m going to get you a damn bell one of these days,” Dean grumbled as he clutched his chest.
The boys settle in at home
his mind whispers. Which… is odd… What is there for time to run out of? Did they put a pie in the oven? Was he supposed to remind Dean to take some medication? Was
Neither the book nor movie show how Westley survives his fall. The goal is to get Cas
"Nothing really happens here, Dean," Cas says. "As a homeowner, you should consider joining."
Dean had been banging and stomping around the garage for a good week now. He was short and snippy with the other guys, polite but not overly warm or welcoming to the customers, and continually dropped things, hitting his head, or catching himself on parts resulting in an increase of scrapes and bruises. His hands were even more of a mess than they usually were; he was being careless.
“Geesh Cas, you really know how to win a guy over ya know that?”
“I’m giving you a ten minute head start. You get up to the apartment and into the bedroom, strip, and wait for me on the bed. If you’re not ready when I get there, there will be consequences. Understood?”
“I know you didn’t; it’s not something I usually talk about. She left because I got into the same shit Michael had, and then I just let her go and never went after her. She could be dead and I would have no idea,” Cas lamented, beating himself up over his actions of over a decade ago.
“Please stay,” Cas pleaded, reaching out toward Dean. A small smile creeped over the younger man's face as he rolled closer to Cas. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Yes, Castiel,” Dean responded.
“Okay, shit, the ship is meant to represent everyone’s bullshit they’ve thrown at me my entire life and the kraken is my strength. A kind of reminder to not let the self-doubt and self-loathing get to me or whatever,” Dean explained hurriedly as he squirmed, uncomfortable.
“Gah, I’m warm, it’s at least 800 degrees in here,” Dean complained as he shoved the heavy blanket off of them, allowing it to land on the floor.
Cas gapes. "Gabriel? How are you here? I thought— I thought you died!"
Other warnings apply from past chapters (illegal drug use, panic/anxiety etc.) but nothing else new :)
“Whoa, dude; what’s eating you?” she asked, plopping herself down on Dean’s bed. “Boy troubles?”
"No, yeah, that’d be great," Dean smiles back. During the short walk to the front door, Castiel can’t help but think of how domestic and nice this feels. He chuckles a bit to himself, just thinking that if his past self thought that just
The warm light of the setting sun softens the neighborhood before Dean finally steps out to walk Taylor.
I have a busy weekend, and I would hate to leave you beautiful people with nothing to do...so here, have another chapter. The "idiots in love" tag really comes into play here.
“Oh, so I’ve not made anything of myself? Just because I have a shitty past I’m nothing now? Really Gabe? I did it for you, I did it for Anna, so you both could have a life and not be in this shit. Clearly that worked out really fucking well didn’t it!?”
“Dean whatever-your-middle-name-is Winchester, if you don’t answer my very important question I swear I will smite you right here. I swear on my father,” Cas exclaims, unable to hide the frustration and impatience in his tone. Sure of what Dean's answer is going to be, but still needing to hear it.
They figure out a plan together
“Hey Gabe, what do you do? Are you like a therapist or something?” Dean asked while snuggling deeper into the overstuffed couch cushions. Gabe chuckled.
Castiel tilts his head—well, he would if he could—trying to understand what’s going on in front of him.
The bartender handed him his drinks and he practically ran back to the safety of his dark, secluded table. Bela, of course, noticed the near-frenzied state Dean was suddenly in when he handed her drink over and sat down. She started looking out over the room, trying to piece together who may have sent her tablemate into a panic; then her eyes landed on him and a wicked grin spread over her face.
When Dean gets close enough Cas grabs his hands, intertwining their fingers as he leans in for a gentle kiss. “Welcome home darling,” he says softly, suddenly hit with the sheer magnitude of what he’s about to do. “Oh, and happy anniversary.”
Dean settled in on the comfortable couch, but stared intently down the hallway. All the worst case scenarios played through his head of what could be wrong. Did Cas have someone else in his bedroom with him? Of course he did; why would Dean think he was special? God, he was so fucking dumb; he never should have come. He had walked by this stupid building every day on his way home from Bobby’s garage where he worked and today he just couldn’t help himself. Cas hadn’t answered his texts or calls in almost two weeks and he should have taken the hint: he obviously wasn’t wanted.
"Is that what we're calling Cas now?"
"Hello, Cas."
Dean's eyes snap to Cas’s mouth opening to protest, but Cas continues speaking, forcing Dean to listen.
“I mean, not exactly, but a rough version, yeah,” Dean answered quietly. Then Cas’s lips were crashing into his unexpectedly, his hands on either side of Dean's face. He pulled back and rested his forehead on Dean’s.
Dean could tell Cas was distracted, lost in his own head the rest of the night. Not only had he come back with a drink, which he had told Dean was a rare thing, but he had sat down and just stared blankly at the tv. After a few minutes of silence, Dean slid closer, and tucked himself into Cas’s side. Cas threw his arm over Dean’s shoulders and pulled him closer. Dean could feel Cas relax against him, as he buried his face in Cas’s neck, trying to get as close as possible. Eventually they ordered food for dinner and ate on the couch, watching some nature documentary Cas had picked out.
“This conversation is not over,” he said sternly and then spun back around to go check on Cas.
Cas snuggles up to Deans side, “I’m glad you liked that idea,” he grins, proud of himself for his forethought. The images are of various friends, their family, Charlie, Jody, Donna and the girls, Bobby, Garth and his family. In each one individuals or various groupings are holding large poster board with one word scrawled on each, together they form the sentence, ‘turn around and say yes!’ in every single one their loved one are sporting huge, giddy grins. Jody is giving a thumbs up, Claire trying her best to look unamused, but the corner of her mouth is slightly turned up in a soft smile. Bobby with an uncharacteristic grin on his face, toasting the camera with his whisky glass. Garth's twins--now about two--hold their word high above their heads excitedly while Garth and Bess looked on lovingly.
IN honor of finishing writing this story have a smut filled chapter! It is shorter but I'll probably post chapter four soon, because I've given up on sticking to a posting schedule.
Cole Trenton. This is getting super weird. Dean has just tossed the nameless wonder out the doors, and starts to stalk after him, hoping Cas can redirect his own fight out of the building where corners and machinery could get him pinned. Their bond seems as strong as ever, thankfully, and he sees Castiel force Cole to twist, and they begin to head in the opposite direction.
Gabriel scrunches his face. "Yeah, well. About that. I
Castiel all but prays it isn’t Dean who knocked and curses when he opens the door and comes face to face with the man.
Cas gives a noncommittal huff “you should get some more rest, I ’ll come check on you a little later,” he says quickly and  moves to stand but before he can Dean grabs at his arm, willing him to stay, Cas glancing back at those forest green eyes that always give him pause, this time filled with worry. Cas sighs and gives in, sitting back down, somehow even closer to Dean, who is still grasping the angel's wrist, not quite ready to trust that if he lets go Cas won’t bolt.
“Mmmhmm,” Gabriel hummed in response while raising the bottle to his lips and taking a sizable swig. He held out the bottle to Dean without looking over, Dean readily accepted it and wasted no time swallowing down a few swigs before handing it back. He could already feel the lazy, slow warmth spread throughout his body from where it bloomed in his chest. He hummed contently without realizing it until Gabriel chuckled next to him.
"I, um. I wouldn't mind."
It’s not until Cas feels something warm that he looks down to find Dean’s hand on top of his. He’s about to apologize when Dean speaks up.
In the weeks following his brother's death he would learn that because Michael was standing in front of him when the bullets started flying, he had acted like a shield for Cas, protecting him from getting hit with anything more than a graze here and there. He had also learned that the “pick-up” had indeed been a set up: Chuck had been worried Michael was earning a following, was worried he would be taken out as leader of their gang and didn’t want to give up that power.
“What? Why didn’t you stop him? You’re a giant and you couldn’t stop him?” Cas spits out, not meaning to sound unkind, but he knew it came out snippy. Luckily Sam seems to understand.
“Gabriel said you helped people: those that want out, the ones who don’t have anyone else. Is that true?” Dean cut through the silence after a few minutes, startling Cas.
“Fine, I’m on your side; what do I need to do?” he asked.
Taylor lifts her head and pants happily at Dean. He smiles back at her until she jerks her head to the right and lets out a low growl. Dean’s eyes snap over to where Taylor is focused, searching the dense trees for movement or any indication of why the hell his dog is suddenly on high alert. Seeing nothing, he grabs her leash and redirects her attention back toward the house, their pace a bit quicker and more purposeful.
She pulls a chair closer to the beds and sits. Neither Cas nor Dean look peaceful in their sleep. She thinks about the setting of Cas's fake world. She had hoped to find two of her favorite people playing house. It could be worse, sure, but she had hoped to see an obvious reason for what is keeping Cas there and that neutral world isn’t it.
over and over again in his mind.
Before he slipped out the door, he pulled on his old black biker boots and laced them up. He then took one slow look around the apartment, walked out the door, made sure it was locked, and walked away from the life he had built over the last few years. He dropped his key with Alfie, reminding him Gabriel would stop by to pick it up: he had agreed to stop in now and again to check up on the place while Cas was holing up in some rat infested shit hole on the other side of town. He didn’t want to, he would have loved to come back to his basic comforts he had grown accustomed to, but he couldn’t risk drawing any additional risks to his staff, friends or family, so he would stay as far away as possible for the time being.

Besides, of all the clubs, Stella’s was by far his favorite. The atmosphere was laid back, they had old school arcade games lining the back hallway and the music all centered in the late 90s and early 00s, meaning the crowd was typically missing those obnoxious early 20 somethings who were only out to get completely shit faced and always seemed to be screaming for no discernible reason. He groaned and sat up, knowing he would end up with the rest of the group at the bar by the end of the night.
“I was thinking you could go get us both one,” she said, batting her eyelashes. Dean groaned as he got up.
Dean slowly worked his way toward consciousness. He stretched, groaned, and cracked his eyes open only to notice he was alone in bed. Frowning, he laid back and allowed the previous night to play through his head. Whatever news Gabriel had told Cas clearly fucked with him; he had been lost in his head the rest of the night, that was, until he got Dean's shirt off and quickly became captivated with the tattoos scattered across his skin. The thought brought a smile to Dean’s face: the memory of Cas being so enamored and interested in all of Dean’s ink, the art he had so carefully curated to cover his body and tell his story.
him instead. Looking one last time for the lie.
Dean groaned, because yes, that sounded so fucking amazing and he was ready for it. Just Cas’s words shot a jolt of excitement directly to Deans dick, and he had hardly even touched him yet. Suddenly a sharp smack landed on his ass. “Ah, what?”
"I’m aware, Dean." Castiel rests his hand on Dean’s cheek, sending a calming warmth through Dean. "You did what you needed to do to save me. I’m only sorry that I won’t be useful to you any more."
Well shit, she quite literally just succinctly and nonchalantly laid out what had always been one of his biggest fears and subsequent regrets of his high school career, hell...still to this day if he was honest, like it was nothing. Who the hell was she to assume she knew so much about him?
Dean.
“Wait, how did no one know?” Cas asked.
******
He could hear Cas walking through the apartment, pausing at the door, no doubt fixing Dean’s tossed shoes, then padding down the hallway, stopping every so often, probably collecting his discarded clothing. As Cas appeared in the doorway Dean finally got his pants and boxers off, threw them across the room, and flung himself to the middle of the bed, still bouncing slightly when Cas stepped across the threshold. Dean grinned proudly at himself as he laid on the bed, trying to catch his breath and slow his heartbeat.
“I love you too Castiel,” Dean responds before Cas has time to question it. He falls into Dean, both men giddy and giggly, smiles essentially permanent fixtures on their faces as they lay nose to nose.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean said quietly while he shuffled over to the couch and nestled in under a few blankets. He laid down and turned so he was facing the back of the couch, his back toward the room, trying to hide the few tears that made their way down his face silently before he drifted off to sleep.
-past minor character death
"The end of the first chapter," she says slowly. "I just said that."
"Really not like I had a choice in the matter!" Castiel grunts as he dodges an attack from his opponent. A flurry of golden fur charges towards Dean and he only has a matter of seconds to brace himself as the dog leaps into his arms. She lets out whines of happiness as she licks his face over and over. Dean makes noises of disgust but honestly he missed his sweet girl too.
His shoulders still ache, but that’s the least of his worries at this point. He feels as though he’s been suspended and toyed with for days, although realistically he knows it couldn’t have been longer than a couple hours at most. Cas should be back soon to check in on his progress in getting information out of Alastair. What a surprise he’s be in for, seeing Dean struggling to stay awake, blood covering his body, trickling to the floor, his shirt long gone, shredded beneath him. It had been torn and ripped by one of the whips Alastair had found and decided he was quite fond of.
Dean refuses to play the part of the mouse again, refuses to beg, refuses to let this monster get the best of him for a second time.
Cas’s tremors and mood swings peaked on day four.
They continue to build a life together
“What’s your color Dean?”
“Cas, what the hell happened man?” he asks, proud of how sure and confident he sounds, because he feels anything but, all he wants to do is sink into Cas and sleep, cuddled into his arms, protected and safe.
A loud howling bark echoes through the quiet street, followed by Dean’s "Taylor! Hush!" Crap… he probably should have gone in with Charlie to not scare the Winchester household. A few more barks and a couple of the neighbors’ lights click on. Castiel looks at his wristwatch and frowns. 11:33 PM.
Dean’s voice sounds louder now.
Dean beamed at Cas, proud of his joke and at making Cas laugh like that. Damn, he wanted to see more of that. The way Cas’s nose scrunched up, how he showed all his teeth with a grin splitting his face, how he had tipped back in his chair, feet coming up off the floor, completely lost in laughter. If Dean could make him look like that, he would do it every chance he got.
After a minute or two of deep breaths Dean responded with “Green, Castiel,” steeling himself for the overwhelming sensations to begin again. Instead Cas once again laid over him and started kissing his cheek, eyelid and the corner of his mouth, gently and calmly.
Dean walked back to the living room in a daze, sure that this was just the withdrawal talking, but still taken aback by Cas’s intensity. When he turned the corner to the living room, Gabriel was there wrapping Dean in his arms. Dean initially stilled and then relaxed, wrapping his arms back around the shorter man, trying to hold back the tears that were threatening to fall.
“How’s your ph--Dean, what the fuck man? I thought you got rid of that!” Charlie bolted upright, staring at the box. It was simple, nondescript, dark green and made of tin. Inside was Dean's stash, paraphilia, a few different substances to choose from. While weed was definitely his preference overall, he had a taste for pretty much anything if the mood called for it. Uppers, downers, hallucinogens: he was game for whatever.
Dean threw a look at Cas, challenging him, itching for that dark tone from the man beneath him. “Hmmm, I like this look on you Cas; I think you shouldn’t ever wear a shirt,” he said as his hands started to trail down the other man's scarred torso, stilling over his hip. Cas’s sweatpants were slung low, his tattoo clearly visible, and Dean’s hand traced over the symbols.
That night, the night before the rest of their lives, they fall asleep tangled together, hands lazily roaming, trading sleepy and comfortable kisses in the quiet moments between planning their life together.
“Thank you Dean. Now, hands back on the floor please; hold still and don’t be afraid to let me know if you need a break. I’m not going to go easy on you okay?” Cas asked, unzipping his pants and popping open his button. He worked his pants down to his knees and then slowly lowered his boxers, allowing his hard cock to spring free, almost hitting Dean in the face.
“I uh, I never said that,” Dean croaked out, lips suddenly forgetting how to form words without a tremendous amount of effort.
That’s why he had started drinking more that first day, just to calm his nerves, to maybe help him sleep a bit, to quiet his anxiety. That’s what he told himself anyway. It’s why he had contacted some old “friends'' and obtained something stronger to help him sleep the third day, and eventually something to help keep him awake the day after that, since he couldn’t sleep anyway. He knew this was a slippery slope, he knew he was in dangerous territory contacting people from his old life again, and he knew it made him an easier target, but it would help in the long run, at least that was what he told himself.
Sam runs a hand through his hair and nods in agreement. "I’m not sure what happened in there, but both your vitals spiked. I thought we were going to lose you both."
As if hearing his thoughts calling her, the dog breaks from Dean’s side and bounds toward Castiel.
"Sorry, but, uh, have we met before?" Dean asks, the red in his cheeks making his freckles stand out.
When Cas’s phone started ringing, he debated about ignoring it. He was currently in the middle of a meeting with a potential vendor for the club that he had been trying to meet with for months. He thought better of it and, when he politely excused himself and slipped his phone out of his pocket, his breath hitched at Dean’s name on the screen. They hadn’t interacted in about a week, and he couldn’t believe Dean had forgiven him enough to call him just to chat in the middle of the work day. At that thought, his anxiety ramped up and he had to grab a hold of the wall for support, his knees threatening to give out on him.
“I mean, I’ve known you and Dean have been dancing around each other for over a decade, I have eyes. But Cas, whoa, dude, you…”
Dean hasn’t even realized his hands are grasping the front of Cas’ white button up, tangled in the fabric, his face pressing into Cas’ shoulder, unconsciously seeking out his warmth and comfort. As Cas gently lays Dean back on the bed, tears are now coming a bit slower, breath hitching only every few breaths, the shaking subsiding to a more manageable level, Dean can’t bring himself to let go of Cas’ shirt, and doesn't want to be left alone again.
"Oh, yeah? Maybe I will," Dean playfully challenges him, his dog still looking very much at home sitting there, pressed up closely against Dean's leg.
-typical cannon-level violence
Dean's frantic struggles make no difference to Alastair. He doesn’t even register the nails clawing at his arm, causing jagged lines of blood to bead to the surface. He doesn’t notice the kicks that land to his legs and abdomen as he attaches cold, metal cuffs to Deans wrists. He may notice the anxiety and dread in Dean's eyes as those same cuffs that should still be attached to Alastair click shut instead, attaching Dean to the same contraption Alastair has been attached to maybe five minutes previously. The demon may notice the tears pooling in Dean's eyes, his ragged breath only becoming more irregular by the second, or the way his hands shake as he is once again helplessly bound by a sadistic monster. If he does, he doesn’t mention it.
He gritted his teeth against the jostling and maneuvering it took to situate him on the stretcher and get him into the back of an ambulance. He made the mistake of looking at his leg as they placed some sort of splint to keep it protected, and he definitely should not have done that. It was twisted in the wrong direction, his knee now turned to the right, farther than it should have been able to. While that would have been concerning on its own, his foot was definitely facing the opposite direction from what he could tell. He puked all over the shop floor after that.
“Pssht, I can take any of them, easy,” Dean said, that bravado returning as he sat up a bit straighter, lifting himself slightly off the seat with his arms braced on the table and seat back, eyes roving around the bar, looking for something, or someone to direct his ever present aggression toward.
“It’s Dean, sir,” the woman whom Cas had all but forgotten about offered.
He didn’t understand the point of Facebook, he had no ‘old friends’ to keep in contact with. Instagram didn’t appeal to him, he wasn’t one for photography nor Twitter, he wasn’t nearly angry enough at seemingly nothing, or everything. Then he came across Tumblr, that day also happened to be a day Dean was being extra adorable and Cas just wanted to scream at someone that he absolutely loved this man, but he couldn’t do so to anyone in the bunker. So, on a whim he had made an account.
“Respect is something you tend to have a problem with, my boy, isn’t it? Should I be sure to remind you just how to be respectful?” Cas asked, tone dark but his eyes held a glimmer that Dean had come to learn meant wonderful things were in store for him.
"Ah, don't remind me. Long-ass time no see, Winchester. What's going on in your crappy life these days?" Charlie smirks mischievously, sounding like the epitome of
Cas slowly woke up, tentatively stretching, taking stock of himself. He was absolutely still sore, still felt like complete shit, but the shaking had subsided. He had slept a bit and his stomach wasn’t threatening to purge anything at the moment, and he considered that all a very big win. As he laid there, he tried piecing together the last few days. He wasn’t sure exactly what day it was, nor what time, but it was dark in his room and his phone wasn’t in its usual spot on his bedside table. Gabriel probably took it from him, which was for the best. Then he remembered Dean had been there, he had seen him like that, he knew, fuck. He groaned as he rolled on his back, blinking up at the ceiling and trying to come up with some type of plan for how to handle this when the bedroom door creaked open slowly and Dean creeped in.
Dean steeled himself, crossing his arms again, “Fine.”
Charlie bolts awake and looks over at the bodies of Dean and Castiel laying nearby. She knows that they won’t wake up. Cas due to being stuck in the dream world, and Dean from being too damn stubborn to leave Cas stuck in that hellhole by himself.
Besides, even though Dean would never admit it, he's always dreamed about living the apple pie life.
“Stop fucking protecting me! I’m a grown man, I can protect myself! Do you really think I’ve never had to!? What about the times you weren’t home and someone came calling for mom, or after you got kicked out? What? You think mom stopped with those guys!? Fuck no, I protected Anna from their sleazy glares and wandering hands, Cas! So stop using me as your excuse! Admit you’re fucking scared and not of this,” Gabe gestured around the small apartment, “you’re fucking terrified of being happy, of having Dean, of having someone that’s good for you because of how it ended with Ini--” Cas cut him off.
“I can take you anywhere, any time dude,” she said as she settled in and turned her attention back to the TV.
"What the fu—" Dean trails off when he rounds the corner and sees Charlie standing in front of him. He keeps up his surprised expression, just in case Cas is watching; he knows he’s not supposed to know Charlie is alive. At least, as far as Cas is concerned.
"Well, now you've done it," Dean teases. "She's gonna want to stop here every time we go for a walk."
Sunday night he sat on the lumpy, musty couch watching some sporting event that kind of came in on his shitty, small tv, stripes of static interfering every now and then, when there was a knock on his door. His heart rate skyrocketed as he grabbed his gun sitting on the coffee table and stuffed it in the back of his pants, under his baggy shirt, and headed to the door.
“I did, I’m sorry Castiel,” his head dropped back to the pillow that smelled like Cas.
Almost a year has passed since they defeated God. Almost a year since Cas had confessed his undying love for his best friend, which had ultimately led to then being taken by the empty. He had known what it was that would finally summon the dark entity, the one thing that would bring him true happiness: finally admitting his undying love for Dean Winchester. He had known for almost a decade that he loved the other man, but had never really let himself feel it, never allowed himself to think about it too deeply.
“Dean Winchester, you feel more deeply than anyone else I know. You’re just not great at the naming your feelings thing. There’s a difference,” Cas says as he leans back and holds Dean's gaze. He then gently places his lips on Deans.
“Thanks Cas, what’s going on here?” Dean asks, eyes flicking around them taking in the lights.
-tattoos and everything that goes with them (mentions of needles etc.)
This morning while scrolling through a random tag that had caught his attention he found  a page of someone who called themselves “the angel of Thursday”. Every post of theirs seemed to be a text post, and after a few, Sam could tell they were all about the author's friend. It was obvious though that this person had more than strictly platonic feelings for this friend. Many of the posts talked about the friends brilliant green eyes;
Here is a second chapter in as many days! I'm leaving for vacation this next week, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post once I leave. I'll probably be able to share one more Tuesday, but after that I'm not positive. It's only a long weekend though, so at the very least I'll be back a week from Tuesday :)
The fact that this man had read him like a book both terrified and excited Dean. Here Cas had collected almost all of what others had referred to as his “problem behaviors” for most of his life into a nice little pile and tucked them in a neat little box essentially labeled “desperately wants love and attention but is too chicken shit to ever ask for it” and had done so in really only one evening. A few measly hours and he understood Dean better than anyone else in his life ever even cared to.
-drug relapse
Good God this feels nice… Dean kicks himself for the hundredth time for not moving things forward with Castiel sooner. So much time wasted on beating around the bush because Dean thought angels could never feel that way, and apparently Castiel thought Dean could never be his. Honestly, the doubt still creeps into his mind and regret likes to barge in like an unwelcome houseguest. Like at this very moment…
They lasted a total of just over five years before she called him out on his shit, packed her stuff, and left him. He was honestly surprised it had lasted that long. He knew he had been a shitty boyfriend, he drank too much, spent too much time in seedy bars--using his fake ID before he was of age--and had no real plan for his future. He danced around her questions of marriage and kids, never really giving an actual answer, simply avoiding and redirecting, never being able to picture himself with any real type of family. He had been young, dumb, and in the closet with no direction and no purpose in life and, honestly, not much had really changed.
"No…" he breathes out, the words barely audible.
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose and huffs out in frustration. "I’m trying, Red. I really am. Cut me some slack. I’m terrified of everything that can go wrong. And everything
Dean pulled back, his face flushed and eyes dark, he rested his forehead on Cas’s and closed his eyes, “Cas, you really are dumb sometimes you know that?” Dean chuckled and shook his head.
“I can’t Sam, I can’t mess up what we have, I can’t push him even further away. I can’t lose him as a friend,” Cas mumbles out, head now resting on his arms propped on the table in front of him. Resigned to his fate, simply waiting for Dean to come storming out of his room and scream at him to get out. Sure Dean would never want to see Cas again. The scenario playing out in his head is interrupted by Sam's nervous stammering.
"Yes," Castiel says seriously.
Cas spirals
There has to be some kind of door, some kind of portal that can wake him up. He just has to find it.
Dean blinks. "Your pants?"
“You shouldn’t, but I think you know that. You may have been gone for a while, but you were in the life long enough, and did well for yourself while here; you know not to trust anyone,” Adam continued, “but I think you should know. I loved Michael.”
Well, if he hadn’t felt like an idiot before, he certainly does now.
Cas remains at the table, unmoving, as he hears Dean pull the recently vacated chair closer and carefully sit down. Cas can see his stocking feet angled toward him, obviously waiting for Cas to acknowledge his presence, waiting for a conversation Cas is fairly certain he doesn’t want to have. Taking a breath and steadying his emotions, he turns his head and glances at Dean and is met with an unexpectedly soft smile as Dean quickly drops his eyes and starts picking at the edge of the table nervously.
"Cas?" Dean's voice sounds worried, and that's when Castiel realizes he had been sitting there staring at Dean unblinking, unmoving.
Cas can’t help the giddy smile that has transfixed itself on his face as he watches Dean scan over the photos. Pictures of all the people that love them unconditionally, the family they found along the way. There's one of Sam and Dean, heads thrown back laughing, Cas standing close to Dean with an incredulous look on his face directed at the two laughing men. Another of Dean and Cas cuddled up on the couch, Dean's head resting in Cas’s lap, asleep, Cas staring down at the other man's face, his expression soft and full of amazement. One picture shows Dean and Claire conspiring, matching mischievous grins on their faces, both looking over to where Cas and Kaia were sitting on the couch, clueless about what was to come.
Dean openly ogles Castiel.
“A few hours, I think; I don’t really remember. What time is it?” he asked, though he still sounded a million miles away.
“Good boy,” Cas said as he unceremoniously flicked up the vibrations again, causing Dean to shout, muscles rigid pulling against his restraints, panting and squirming. Cas landed a hard smack to the inside of Dean's upper thigh causing him to still immediately and begin to babble nonsensical words. Cas simply grinned a wicked grin and upped the vibrations again. He began playing with the plug, twisting it, pulling out slightly then allowing Dean’s hole to pull it back in all while his other hand traveled lower and began to fondle Dean’s balls, pulling gently, trailing a finger up to the sensitive spot and pressing his knuckle against it. Dean’s hips tried valiantly to stay still, but the younger man couldn’t help the involuntary twitching and jerking of his muscles as sweat covered his skin and a litany of porn worthy groans, whines, and strings of unconnected words flew out of his mouth.
He opened his eyes to meet Cas’s once again and Cas had been damn near knocked over by the total sincerity and adoration reflected back at him in Dean’s eyes, shining with unshed tears. “I love you too, like,
The dark comfort is short lived as Dean’s eyes follow Alastair’s, looking over the makeshift table strewn with holy water, salt, and countless metal instruments, glinting in what little light is given off by the handful of buzzing lightbulbs overhead. It's such a ‘torture chamber’ stereotype Dean could almost laugh at the sheer absurdity of the scene. He can’t pull his eyes away from the table; he knows what’s there, had studied over it before starting in on Alastair. He wonders if Cas had picked out each tool purposefully, thinking of what harm Dean could inflict with each one and what information he would be able to pull out of Alastair between screams and moans of pain. Little did Castiel know he put his faith in someone who only seemed to let people down, who messed up once again, and who was now the one who would be writhing and screaming and paying for his sins. He almost hopes he does die here in this room, because he doesn’t know if he can face Cas, if he can stand seeing the disappointment and contempt as the angel realizes Dean isn’t who Cas thought he was.
After breakfast and cleaning up Dean assumed Cas would order him to the bedroom, or maybe bend him over the couch and take him right there. He tried throwing out all the hints he possibly could that he would be very, very okay with either of those scenarios. Instead, after eating, Cas hurried Dean to get dressed and then practically shoved him out the front door, left him with a chaste peck and closed the door behind him.
When Cas sauntered back out of his large closet and climbed back on the bed he hadn’t lost any articles of clothing, and Dean huffed in annoyance at the realization.
“Of course Gabe, night,” Dean said before passing out curled up on Cas’s couch.
“Cas…” Dean says, not quite questioningly. His tone full of adoration but laced with disbelief. He slowly makes his way closer to Cas.
“What did you mean when you said you were expecting toxic masculinity and attitude?” Dean suddenly asked, breaking the silence. Gabe looked over at him and titled his head as he processed the question. The small, simple mannerism caused Dean's heart to constrict painfully in his chest, it reminded him of Cas, but not the Cas that was currently inside. Gabe sighed and dragged his hand down his face after gently settling the nearly empty bottle on the ground.
Dean starts at the tips of his fingers and mentally works his way down, realizing he could no longer feel any part of his hands (probably not a great sign), his wrists burned and he is sure they are completely shredded from the unforgiving metal biting into the skin. This is exacerbated by the fact he’s still dangling, all his weight being supported by his injured wrists. His arms ached but he is pretty sure there aren’t any more significant injuries until he makes it to his right shoulder; his arm isn’t at quite the same angle as his left and there’s a sharp pain radiating from the joint. Hopefully it’s only dislocated, but it’s quite possibly broken.
Dean walks back towards his home with a lot less pep in his step than when he’d left. He pauses to let Taylor piddle beside a tree before resuming their short journey down the street, his hands crammed in his pockets and his shoulders hunched. He’d really hoped Cas would take the opportunity he’d given him. That he’d break the charade and at least acknowledge what they used to have—or, what Dean thought they had.
Suddenly Dean was being flung across the bed, startled awake as he tried making sense of what Cas was saying while he stomped to the bathroom and slammed the door. He was still sitting there stunned when Cas stomped back to the bed.
. Is this an interrogation?"
