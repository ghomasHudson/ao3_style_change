"Dogs are literally the purest creatures on this earth. I don't see why one wouldn't be able to wield the hammer."
Peter tilted his head, "I'm really confused about this one," he put the textbook on the table and pointed at the problem in question. Tony leaned forward, peering around Peter at the Avenger on the other side of him. Steve showed no signs of being able to see their guest.
"I have a feeling their next move will be a big one..." Natasha added, remembering Peter's voicemail, warning his friends to get out of Queens.
Another blast of red energy hit Spider-man upside the head. He rolled his shoulders and looked down at Tony with a renewed anger. But...he let go. Tony sprawled back onto what was left of his armor.
"NO! Not again!" Wanda threw her hands up, "you people are disgusting and I will not be cleaning up after you
"I doubt he'll bring it up at the meeting. Go get dressed. There's a new suit waiting for you in your room." Tony tucked the tablet under his arm and went into the conference room.
Spider-man landed on a rooftop with a grunt. His body was tired after only a few hours of web slinging. Peter had been Spider-man for over thirty years, and his body was getting old. He wouldn't be able to keep web slinging for much longer. But he was still the leader of the Avengers and was determined to ride it out until the bitter end. If that meant going out guns blazing in a bitter battle, then so be it.
"Don't sass the person who's saving your life," Tony aimed his repulsor at the dragon's head, his other hand on the back of the gauntlet, holding it steady. The repulsor whirred as the blue light in his palm increased in brightness. "GAAAAAHHHH!!!!" Tony screamed, firing the weapon with everything he had, temporarily blinding all three beings.
Thankfully, no one brought up the topic of romance for the rest of the night. Steve ended up enjoying himself, despite not being able to drink with his friends. Half them were still sober anyway, so he didn't feel too left out. At some point, Bucky decided to tell everyone about Steve's time as a showgirl for the army, and Steve about died of embarrassment. Clint walked away from the conversation with more blackmail than any one man should ever possess.
That night, dinner was interrupted by a loud clap of thunder. Which was odd, considering they hadn't had a single drop of rain all day. Everyone exchanged looks before hurrying over to the closest window. And low and behold, there stood everyone's favorite god of thunder.
"Call Rhodey," Iron Man was begging at this point, his remaining hand grabbing at Steve's shirt. "Jarvis won't answer me. You gotta call him."
"Tony..." Steve put a hand on his arm. He vaguely remembered the file from the time he and Nat hacked Tony's computer, but he couldn't for the life of him remember what had been inside. "What was on that file?"
Spider-man held his phone between his shoulder and ear, freeing his hands so he could mess with his left boot. "I'll consider it. Anyway, I guess I should give you my actual report for the day."
"You're right, Stark. This has gone on long enough. I got rid of that bug already," Osborn motioned vaguely behind him. The color drained from Tony's face. He must have misheard Osborn. Peter was fine. He was wearing the Iron Spider. He was just fine. Right? Osborn continued, "now it's your turn." He held the shrapnel out, about to slice open Tony's throat.
"You seriously think you can bring a living thing into this building without me knowing about it?" Tony said, raising an eyebrow.
The Avengers headed into the living room, where they had last left their remaining team members. Thor and Clint lounged on the couch watching TV. Peter was nowhere in sight.
"We're seriously going to let a teenage lead us into battle?" Sam gawked at Steve. "Why are we even going to Queens? Is something about to happen there?"
"You should let me borrow Iron Man again sometimes," Clint's wife spoke up from her chair on the porch. She was working on her laptop but politely closed it so she could talk to Steve. "I could use the break every once in a while."
May hugged the stuffed spider in her lap. The poor thing was little more than rags, with two of its eight legs missing. She was just as energetic and reckless as her father, and the toy had paid the price for it.
"I-I guess?" Peter sunk into his seat, having not expected to have this conversation. His life since the spider bite had been so hectic he hadn't really thought about this particular aspect of it.
Iron Man switched off the screen and looked up at his teammates, "we start by contacting SHIELD." Fury still owed the team a favor after wrongfully arresting them two years ago. Now seemed like the best time to cash in on that.
"I don't need a minute," Tony let go of his shirt and stood up. "Let's go. I've had enough of water for today." He glared at the storm clouds.
"You look different," Bucky combed a hand through his hair, which had blown into his face when the robot landed.
Spider-man glared up at his captors from his place on the floor. His hands and feet had been bound by the same glowing red substance as before. He guessed that it was a rope Wanda had enchanted and that the witch had something to do with the previous two times he had been held still by glowing red restraints.
"I'd rather not be in a relationship with anyone right now," Steve admitted. "I'm still...look, I'm still getting my barrings on this new century, and I'd rather just focus on rebuilding my life. And on the team." Next week would mark Steve's second year living in the twenty-first century. A fact that Steve had mixed feelings about.
I decided to go ahead and reveal the traitor. Also, I like writing little snippets of Peter and Tony bonding so you can expect to see a lot more of that in the future.
Peter punched him square in the jaw, "Thanks, but I'm already in a relationship." The symbiote stumbled back and Peter jumped up.
Peter retreated to one of the couches after dinner, pulling up the video Harry had sent him on his phone. He stuffed his earbuds in and tucked his legs under him. Then he pressed play.
Fury grunted. The Avengers were shifting around, moving in front of Tony in order to hide him from view. Tony frowned at his teammates, not sure what they were trying to accomplish by doing that. Oh wait. They didn't know that Fury knew about him. They were trying to hide him from the director.
"C'mon kid, don't make this harder than it needs to be." Tony wrapped his arms around Peter's middle, trapping the web slinger's arms against his sides.
"What the hell is this?" Steve slammed a print out of the 'Research and Experimentation" document onto Bruce's Desk. He had burst into the doctor's lab just moments earlier, promptly telling everyone else within the room to leave. The scientists working for Doctor Banner quickly shuffled out of the room.
"But..." If he didn't find the extra reactor soon...Tony shook his head, not wanting to think about it. The light was dim, but it was still working. He had time. Not much time, but time none the less. "I kinda need-"
"BARNES!" Repulsors shot out from the bottom of Tony's feet and he blasted across the room like a rocket. His flight was a bit clumsy without the use of his hands, but he still managed to block the exit from Bucky. Bucky skidded to a halt, fumbling a bit before running back in the direction he had come.
He went back to flipping through the sketchbook, freezing when he came across an actual photograph. The image was taped in, Steve had been planning to use it as a reference for a drawing he never got around to starting.
"I don't know what you're playing at. But we ain't going anywhere until you tell us the truth!" Bucky pushed past Steve and grabbed Tony by the collar.
"They're not going to yell at him. They're all worried sick. That's why they came back to the compound." Bucky said. Tony scoffed at that. "Well, believe it or not, they are!"
"Took the last poptart. Listen," Clint leaned forward, pulling a sheet of paper out of his pocket. He's really thought this one through. "We're gonna need some toiler paper, and Thor's hammer. Thor likes poptarts, so it shouldn't be too hard to get him on our side. Anyway, we also need some-"
"That's the point," Rhodey rolled his eyes. "This place used to be Tony's. He left it to me when he died. But I don't have much use for a mansion." He explained. The cabin wasn't quite as big as the Stark residence in Malibu, but it was still larger than life, with a fully functioning workshop underground. The home obviously hadn't been used in a long time. A thick layer of dust covered the surfaces, tarps protected the furniture, and the windows were absolutely filthy. "Pepper is on her way. She's going to bring food and the tools to fix Iron Man. Tony hasn't been here since the 90's, so the workshop is a bit out of date." He announced. "How you hanging in, buddy?"
"Sorry. Is that all you wanted to ask?" Peter accidentally shot a web while he was fiddling with the shooter. He ducked when the web ball ricocheted back at him.
"Not really. Hang on," Spider-man crawled over to a fire escape and pulled out his phone. It had been buzzing in his pocket all night, but he had been too busy fighting crime to check it. "Shit." The group chat had literally exploded, everyone wanting to know where Peter was. Peter had over a hundred missed calls and at least thirty voicemails. Peter resisted the urge to slap himself. There had been a team meeting today. The second one he had missed in a row. No one had cared when he missed the first time. What was so special about this one? Peter's phone buzzed with an incoming call, the name 'Iron Dad' flashing across the screen. Peter denied the call.
"No," Fury shut him down with a cold look. "I suggest you watch yourself, Iron Man. Because I'm about five seconds away from arresting you for murder." That definitely got a response out of the Avengers, who erupted into frantic questions.
"I tell you what. You be a good criminal and answer all our questions honestly, and I'll give you five minutes with Peter." Fury collected the laptop and left before Stark could agree to the deal. A minute later a SHIELD agent Tony had never seen before stepped into the room. Another agent followed close behind with lie detector equipment. Tony remained still as the second agent hooked him up to the machine.
The trees opened up into a small clearing. A cabin was in the center of it. It looked as if no one had used it for awhile, with the vines snaking up the sides of it, and the weeds that had overtaken the lawn. One of the windows was smashed, the drapes now fluttering outside the house.
Tony cleared a spot on the table and kicked a stool over to Steve. "What's our next move, oh captain, my captain?"
"I think it's physically impossible for me to stay out of a fight." Spider-man jumped back onto the fence and shot volleys of webs at the Vulture, who quickly dodged.
Iron Man landed with a thud, kicking up dirt. He slowly rose from his crouched position, armor barely making a sound.
Steve turned his attention back to the forest before him. His motorcycle kicked up mud as he sped through the trees. The rain wasn't coming down as heavy as it had been when they first raided the Hydra facility, but it was still coming down fairly hard. Steve kept his head low, allowing the water to easily roll of his cowl. In the distance, he could hear the Hulk roaring. The Hydra agents had put up more of a fight than expected, so the Avengers had to break out the big guns.
"We're going after people who almost killed you. They were able to cut through the fabric on your suit. They shouldn't have been able to do that. Some overkill might be exactly what we need." He poked Peter again with the screwdriver. Peter snatched the offending object and chucked it across the room.
Bucky shook his head and leaned against the window sill. Steve was talking to Pepper in the driveway. He didn't look happy. And neither did she. Bucky wasn't sure how he was going to keep hiding Iron Man from him. Luckily, it seemed as though he didn't have to. Pepper had him trade in his shield for an ax and sent him to go chop up some firewood. Bucky waited until he heard the shower running before leaving the room, making sure to lock the door behind him.
"WOHOOOO!!!!" Spider-man cried out in glee, letting himself free fall from a skyscraper. He caught himself on a web line at the last minute and flung himself back into the sky. He did a flip and continued the process of free falling and web slinging. It was a Saturday morning and not much was happening in Queens. Which Spidey was perfectly okay with. It'd been awhile since he'd been able to just web sling. He did another flip and landed gracefully on the sidewalk in front of Harry Osborn.
Bruce held up his hand, "it's okay. He's under a lot of stress. We should all leave and let him get some rest." The team murmured in agreement and started to leave.
"Whoa..." Clint looked around the workshop wide-eyed. The Avengers had followed Iron Man into his shop, despite his protesting. Steve and Bucky had tried to herd them out, knowing Iron Man didn't like people intruding on his personal space. But there were just too many people to keep track of and they kept sneaking back in. Iron Man was too busy with the bot to do much about it. He made a mental note to upgrade his security later.
"I don't like this plan..." Clint shook his head, thinking of all the ways it could go wrong. "I don't doubt that we could take Osborn down. But if what he's saying is true, and he really does have Spider-man...the there must be someone on his side powerful enough to take down Spidey. Or many someones. We really don't know what we're up against."
"No," Tony glared at the mug in his hands. "He's in love with Iron Man, who is indeed a robot. But Tony Stark, the fucked up cyborg hiding inside him? No. He could never love that person."
"J-just trying to...lighten...the...m-mood...do you like icecream...Doc?" Spider-man gasped out, clawing at the metal limb that was quickly tightening around his throat.
That was until Thor showed up and flung himself at the group, knocking everyone over. Steve's laughter was music to Tony's ears.
"yes, I'm paying attention," Spidey cut Steve off. He was sitting between Clint and Tony, doodling something in a notebook. Steve opened his mouth to say something else, but Peter beat him to it, "Are we done?" Clint leaned over to see what he was drawing, only for Spider-man to cover the page with his arms.
Also, how do you guys feel about Peter having a love interest in this story? I was thinking Ned or Michelle. Usually I write spideypool, but Spidey is a minor in this, so I'd rather not do that.
"They're attacking Midtown High!" Spider-man yelled back. "All my friends are there!" He was a few blocks away and could already see the damage to the building. Thick black smoke pumped out of what was left of the windows. His mind flashed back to the pile of corpses from his dream. "No, no, no, no!" Spider-man had never web slung so fast in his life. The building rumbled, and the roof shifted, threatening to give way at any moment. The students had been in the middle of evacuating when the bomb went off. Their once orderly lines were long gone, with the screaming teens running in all different directions. Spider-man landed on top of the fence, calling to the nearest teacher, "is anyone still inside?!"
Tony stepped over Bruce's Chihuahua and plopped down beside Steve on the couch. The Chihuahua was the first four-legged addition to the Avengers team. The small creature had a temper to rival the Hulk's and was always trembling with rage. Bruce had named her "Sunday", after the AI Friday. Sunday only let Bruce pet her, and she kept Bruce from Hulking out in stressful situations. Tony heard a hiss from under the couch. The fattest cat Tony had seen in his entire life squeezed its way out from under the furniture. The cat's name was Cheesecake. He belonged to Wanda. Tony had given her the cat as a birthday gift as a way to help her cope with her PTSD. The cat lumbered over to its owner, who was currently going through a stack of DVDs with Clint.
The humming from the repulsor fizzled out. Tony lowered his arm. Steve watched as the plates slid back into their passive state, reforming the shape of his arm.
"Sorry, I'm out too." Sam raised his hands then let them drop against his thighs. "I don't know what's going on in Stark's head. But it ain't right. I don't trust that guy."
Tony's mind screamed at him. He was in panic mode. Complete and utter panic. What was he supposed to do? Where was he supposed to go? He blasted his way through another wall, ignoring the screams of the people on the other side. Agents were hard on his heels, unloading round after round of bullets. Normal bullets did little against the armor, and Tony continued to surge forward. The look Steve had given him made his heart twist. Made it hard to breathe. Steve thought he was a murderer now. The whole team did. The people who he considered family were after his head now. They were going to strip him of his armor, and then they would hate him even more than they already did. Everything was crumbling and Tony didn't know what to do. He broke through the ceiling, flying up onto the top deck of the Hellicarrier. Rain splattered against him. The alarms were still blaring.
Tony made eye contact Bucky. He tilted his head, asking a silent question. Bucky shook his head and left the room.
"Yeah, hasn't really been any major world ending threats to take care of recently. Which I suppose is a good thing. Although I feel kinda cheated. I was hoping I could punch an alien or two if I joined the Avengers." Peter grinned even though the older man couldn't see it.
"When I first saw Peter it was at his parents funeral. I told myself back then that I would never get involved in his life. I wasn't able to keep that promise. I should've just let him be. Then none of this would have happened." Tony's voice cracked on the last word.
"I took it out because I don't like big brother watching me," Iron Man flicked the offending object across the table. The world security council had agreed to let Iron Man roam freely on the condition that a tracker be placed in him. That had been back when they first found him seven years ago and didn't know if they could trust him. Tony had made sure it was put in his prosthetic arm to ensure his identity be kept a secret. He hated the tracker from day one, as it made him feel more trapped than he already did. Tony ended up tearing it out when he was flying over the ocean last week. He had meant to go back for it, but had forgotten to do so. "I figured by now that I'd proven myself to you people. And that I could go without it for awhile."
"Don't worry about it," Tony clinked his metal hand against Bucky's shoulder. "Are we still going out for lunch today?"
"It's probably gone. Besides, we shouldn't split up. We don't know this area. Could be dangerous. And you don't have your armor," Steve argued.
"Obadiah Stane," the bot chuckled. Tony stilled. "And who do you think you are? After all these years, still prancing around like a glorified robot."
"Like hell you are," Rhodey shook his head in disbelief. "Shoulda called me sooner." He slipped an arm under Iron Man's shoulders and pulled the bot close to his chest. Iron Man remained limp, allowing War Machine to move him as he pleased. "Jesus..." He tilted Iron Man's head back, inspecting the damage done to his neck. The metal plating was charred to hell, with motor oil and other liquids seeping out of the deep cuts.
"YOU KNEW?!" Tony roared so loudly that the speakers crackled. Everyone jumped back except for Bruce, who held his ground. Tony approached the shorter man, fists balled at his sides. He hadn't so much as uttered the word "AIM" to Rhodey and Pepper. How the hell did Bruce know about it? "You
Hawkeye scoffed, "why do aliens always attack in literally the worst time possible? Can't they wait till spring? When we're not all freezing our balls off?"
"Anytime, Pete. Stick around for awhile. Steve should be back soon, and he'll be upset if he doesn't get to say goodbye to May." Tony said, a soft smile on his lips.
Spider-man punched Iron Man in the jaw, denting the faceplate. Iron Man retaliated by ramming Peter's head into a metal table. The table bent under the force, and Peter went limp. Tony stepped back and lifted his face plate. "Oops."
"No, Cap. There's nothing to reconsider. I've made up my mind," Bruce followed Clint's lead, although he didn't slam the door like the former. He paused when he was just outside the doorway, giving Thor a questioning look.
"Are they all like that?" Spider-man sat up and looked around. The remaining students didn't look like they were under Wanda's spell. And Michelle wasn't attacking him.
"How are you alive?" Steve asked. He knew that Iron Man would be overjoyed. The bot always got so depressed when his creator was brought up. But he did have his suspicions about Stark. Where had he been for the past seven years? And what the hell had happened to his body? Steve could see the metal hand clearly. The same metal plating traveled up the side of his neck, with cables acting as tendons. The facial prosthetic was probably hiding even more machinery. Steve fell into step beside the shorter man, trying to get a better look at the glowing orb that occupied the spot where his eye should have been.
The person behind the camera had cornered Natasha in a convenience store. There didn't appear to be anyone around them.
"And I don't think it's physically possible for Vision to be mean to people," Peter's smile widened. "My family is a bunch of fuck-ups, and I'm going to beat Clint's ass in particular as soon as this is all over. But they're still my family, and I forgive them."
"Friend Anthony!" Thor raised his stein in a toast. The other Avengers clinked their glasses against his, all of them murmuring words of encouragement. Except for Rhodes, who was staring at Tony like he had grown a second head.
Before Tony could respond, Bucky swooped in and grabbed the blanket bundle. He darted across the room, an evil smile on his face.
"So you'll let us help you?" Natasha pressed. Peter nodded slowly. Natasha smiled brightly, "good. Come along, little spider," she motioned for him to come over to the team.
"A tarantula...? As a pet...? Boy, times have changed. Back in my day we just killed spiders and moved on with our lives. No offense!" He said quickly, after seeing the look of horror on Peter's face.
"Yeah, that seems to be a common problem with me. Always in the wrong, eh?" Tony turned his cold gaze to his ex. "Shouldn't be out in the field. Shouldn't be trying to help. Trying to fix things with my teammates. I should
Steve sat cross-legged in the grass, a large sketchbook open in his lap. It was a warm spring day and the Avengers decided to have lunch outside. Steve had been trying to draw the group as a whole, lounging in the grass with their paper plates and half eaten sandwiches. But Bruce was the only one who sat still. Thor and Clint were wrestling and kept knocking into people.
"You attacked my friend. I had no choice." Natasha knelt down to inspect the bullet wound in his shoulder.
Spider-man shot a web at a branch and used it to launch himself into the air. He flipped around and landed a kick right between Doc Ock's shoulder blades. As he jumped back he did another flip. He was vaguely aware of landing in a mud puddle. His suit was so dirty at this point he was convinced that there was more mud than fabric. Peter had figured out early on that Doc Ock's extra limbs were made from some sort of Chitauri tech. They reminded him of the Vulture's wings. Maybe Doc Ock got his arms from the same people? Either way, there was no breaking the tentacles without some Chitauri tech of his own to do so. Peter would have to break the man connected to them in order to win.
"These things are making me look bad," Tony growled, ripping apart the head of a bot with his hands.
"Good choice," Deadpool nodded once. "But that still doesn't really answer my question. You're like twelve-"
"Understandable," Bruce hummed. He was the only one who hadn't tried to set Steve up with someone. Yet. He turned his glass of water around in his hands, fingers tracing patterns into the condensation. "Speaking of which, I have a new list of songs to give you. Remind me when we get back to the compound."
Hulk had begun to shrink in size, becoming exhausted from fighting the Avengers for an extended period of time. Peter made MJ stay back and slowly approached the raging giant. By the time he reached the fray, Bruce had reverted back to his original form. He wore the stretchy purple shorts Tony had made for him almost a decade ago. Bruce spat a bloodied tooth on the ground. The Avengers swarmed around him, all aiming their various weapons at his head.
"It's going to hurt isn't it?" Peter asked again. Tony opened his mouth to respond but closed it again. He didn't know the answer to that question.
"Ah! Man of Iron! Glad you could join us for dinner!" Thor clapped him on the back, a big friendly grin plastered on his face.
"I TRUSTED YOU!!" Peter grabbed Bruce by the throat and flung him down the hall. The older man hit the wall with enough force to leave a Steve shaped dent.
The man put the bottle back under his robes and motioned for the Avengers to follow him back down the mountain. A wagon being pulled by a few horses waited for them. The elf like man hopped onto the front of the wagon and held out his arm, inviting the Avengers to climb aboard. The wagon was full of soft looking hay.
"I'm not pushing myself," Iron Man snapped. He wished Rhodey would stop calling him Tony. That name didn't belong to him anymore. The scientists at AIM had taken it from him. Left him a shell of a cyborg. He wanted Rhodey to know that, but he also didn't want Rhodey to think he was any weaker than he already did.
"Steve, please, you're all I have, don't leave me!" Tony begged, hands making a grab for Steve shirt only for the super soldier to slap them. "I'm sorry! I'll do anything, please-"
"Not to worry," they reached out and cupped Peter's face, causing him to flinch. "In time you will see things my way. Together we will build a new team. A stronger one."
Steve glared at him. "I'm beyond furious with you right now, Tony. But part of me still loves you. And I could never forgive myself if I raised a hand against you. So please, just go."
"The Goblin is dead! I don't know what you're playing at but you're an awful liar, Stark!" Spider-man's finger's twitched as if he couldn't decide whether to use his webs or fists. "How do I know you weren't controlling my spider sense from the start? This whole adoption thing is just so you can have more control over me, isn't it?!"
"He pumped a bunch of drugs into my system so that Fury couldn't interrogate me. He didn't do jack shit to actually help me." Peter growled. Tony clenched his fists, angry at himself for not noticing Peter had been drugged when he first saw him shaking in his cell. It explained why he wasn't able to walk properly. "I did what I could to fix up my chest. It hurts like hell, so I'm gonna go lay down. Who wants to drive?"
"He's emotionally and physically exhausted. I can't allow him to pilot his armor like this," Steve put his hands on his hips.
"Someone get Steve!" Clint said, and Bucky quickly hurried out of the room. He returned a few minutes later with a very worn out Captain America at his side. The man had deep bags under his eyes and hadn't shaved in a few days. His hair was a mess, and his usually pristine clothing was wrinkled. The moment his eyes fell on Iron Man, his entire face lit up.
"Any word from the tin man?" Sam leaned out of the Quinjet. His goggles were pushed up to his hairline, his mechanical wings folded neatly behind him. The battle had ended, but Iron Man was still underground, investigating an elaborate system of caves. He had found a few Hydra agents down there, as well as some suspicious tech. He managed to report his findings to the team right before his comm cut out.
Spider-man came out of nowhere and threw his entire body against Osborn, forcing him off from Tony. He had put a bit too much force in the shove, which ultimately led to Osborn falling off the edge of the parking garage. "NO!" Spider-man shot a web at the goblin. He hated Osborn with his guts, but he didn't want the man to die. Peter didn't want anyone to d-
"Sorry, couldn't sneak the War Machine on here very easily. And Iron Man was in pieces," the Agent closed the ramp and jumped into the pilot's chair. "A quick stop by Avenger's facility, then off to Queens...uh oh." He had just spotted a swarm of SHIELD agents running towards them. "Click it or ticket!" The rogue yelled as he started the engines. Everyone grabbed onto something right as they took off.
"No! Stay back!!" Natasha hollered. Michelle ignored her, continuing to walk towards Spider-man. The arachnid was stuck to the wall. He pressed himself low against the surface, a growl rumbling in the back of his throat. Peter wasn't in control of his body, but he could hear what was happening. In some dark corner of his mind, he could hear the desperate pleas of his family. He didn't want to keep fighting his them. He had done it far too many times already and he didn't think his heart could take much more. Peter sobbed, even though no one could hear it.
Steve and his small pro-Tony Stark team never stopped searching. Unfortunately, other Avengers-related business had gotten in the way of them conducting a full on search and rescue mission. Their most recent trip to South America hadn't helped either. Pepper was getting increasingly upset with the team, especially those who chose not to partake in the search. Bruce claimed that Iron Man was just fine, and was probably hiding out in a small town somewhere, leading an all new life. Other members of the team shared similar thoughts. There was no proof that Tony was in danger. He was just...gone. Steve knew something was wrong, though. He had a feeling in his gut that something terrible, something truly awful had happened to Tony. And that he needed their help. They
"Jarvis, how close in the Mark 43?" Tony asked as he landed the jet. Steve's comm had brought him to a battle damaged Helicarrier, left to rot in a shipyard. Tony had put the jet into stealth mode in order to land on the top deck.
Peter pushed Tony's arm down, taking a few steps towards Bruce, despite Tony's pleas for him to stay back. "No, you're not. Friends don't cut each other open."
"We just saw each other last week, you moron. And I swear to god, if you get yourself blown up one more time, I'll put you back together just so I can blow you up myself!" War Machine's voice was deeper than Iron Man's.
"I was upset. I don't think that way anymore," Clint said. "I'm sorry. For yelling at you. You didn't deserve-"
Sorry for the short chapter! I'm in the middle of moving half way across the country, so things are a bit hectic, but I still wanted to get something out. The next chapter will be extra long to make up for it.
Tony repeated the phrase. "Something my father used to tell me. I don't think he meant for me to take it literally. But here I am." He held out his arms, head cocked to the side.
"Is...are the others okay?" Tony asked softly, afraid of the answer. Thor nodded and continued smiling as he moved over to where the rest of the team was gathered. Tony followed, his heart dropping into his pit when he noticed Clint's unmoving form on the ground.
"What footage?" Harry asked. The two Avengers looked back to see all the screens had gone to static.
"Huh?!" Tony started. He hadn't moved from his chair and still held his food in both hands. There was no corpse at his feet. He dropped his sandwich and hid his face in his hands, "it happened again...I killed him. Again."
"Okay. But seriously. Who set the lawn on fire?" Rhodey frowned. Clint ran. "You son of a bitch!!" Rhodey darted after him.
Peter thrashed around in Iron Man's arms, kicking his legs and slamming his head against the chest plate. The glass cover on the arc reactor cracked. Whirring noises came from the suit as it struggled to hold Spider-man.
"Can I talk to him?" Steve pleaded. He needed to hear Tony's voice. He had just heard it, but he needed to hear it again. He needed solid proof that Tony was alive.
Peter shrugged. "My old webs lasted an hour. I don't know about this stuff," he looked down at his wrists. "Four hours? Maybe more?"
Steve darted after him, grabbing him by the arm before he could leave the porch. "What are you doing?"
Peter spun to face Clint, eyes wide. He opened his mouth to say something, but the words didn't come out.
His black hair was a mess, and he looked like he hadn't slept in awhile. But that didn't make him any less attractive in Steve's eyes. Steve's eyes traveled down Tony's body, taking in his slim figure. He was in just a tank top and sweatpants. The tank top was rather tight fitting, showing off his muscular torso. Damn. Steve swallowed hard. His eyes continued to travel down Tony's body, and he found that both his feet were prosthetic. He wondered just how much of Tony's body was robotic. The cyborg curled up in the corner of the couch, pulling a blanket around his shoulders, hiding his body from Steve's gaze. Steve frowned, questioning if Tony knew he was watching and had done that on purpose.
"Hey, Pete. Looks like you could use some help," Steve smiled back. "Eyes on me, big guy," he spoke to the Hulk. The beast roared and slammed his fists on the ground. He then proceeded to charge at Steve. Steve raised his shield over his head, taking on the full force of the Hulk's fists. The soldier's arms quaked, and the ground cracked under his feet, but he otherwise held steady.
Fury answered him, "you won't be going home with Stark. Or any of the Avengers. You will remain in SHIELD custody until you turn eighteen. After that, what you do with your life is up to you."
"I killed him. I killed Osborn. It was an accident, it...I...he..." Peter's lower lip trembled, and he felt tears pricking his eyes. "He was gonna kill Tony, I wasn't thinking...it was an accident..."
." Steve spat the last word. Tony felt like he had been slapped in the face. He looked up and found the super soldier standing directly in front of him.
"I know right?" Clint threw an arm around Bucky's shoulders. "Those two are practically joined at the hip! Steve, you are one kinky son of a bitch!"
Iron Man suddenly crashed through a wall, tumbling a short distance before using his repulsors to flip himself upright. He shot back into the room without hesitation.
Steve was still mad at Tony. Not quite the level of fury he had felt when Tony had first declared "I am Iron Man" in the stairwell of the Helicarrier. No, his rage had simmered down. Because at the end of the day, Iron Man-Tony-still meant the world to him. He was the thing that kept Steve moving forward in this strange new era. Iron Man had been there for Steve when he needed him most. He found himself torn between his love for the other man and the deep pain left by his betrayal. He needed to sit Tony down and properly talk to him about it. That's what he should've done two weeks ago. Tony had tried to talk to him, and Steve regretted shutting him down. The soldier stopped outside the workshop door, hand hovering over the control pad on the wall. He prayed that Tony was inside. That the cyborg would want to talk to him. He would understand if Tony didn't want to see him, but Steve had to try. There was no such thing as a perfect couple. Couples always had their squabbles. And they worked through them. Because that's what lovers do. They talk things over. Work through disputes. Make amends. Move on. Steve honestly wasn't sure he was ready to have this conversation. It had to be done, though. He pressed his hand to the control panel and the doors slid open with a gasp of air.
"Of course. He comes to Wanda and me for advice all the time. This isn't his first relationship, ya know. But he really does want this one to work out."
Peter groaned as he slowly regained consciousness. His eyes burned and his head throbbed. At least he wasn't twitching anymore or slobbering everywhere. He had been in and out of consciousness all morning. He became aware of the ache in his shoulders. Most likely caused by the way his arms were chained above his head. He knelt on the concrete floor, the cold making his knees go numb.
"He doesn't need to know anything," Tony's eye flashed, the little shapes spinning around erratically. "I don't know what you think you see in Steve, but I can assure you that he doesn't give two shits about me."
Clint and Thor ended up rolling down the hill. It was a rather rough tumble that resulted in them calling quits on the wrestling. Or rather, Clint was the one who called it quits. The god was more than willing to keep wrestling. Clint was only on his feet for a few moments before a flash of red and a gust of wind knocked him over.
"Wow, this is amazing, May," he kissed her forehead, causing her to giggle. He set both May and the dog back down after a minute. He smiled as she chased the robot around the lab.
"Helmet?" Steve looked over at Tony. Stark jumped to his feet, knowing exactly what Peter was talking about. He darted to the other side of the lab, knocking a chair over and startling Dum-E in the process.
"Stop looking at those." Steve ripped Tony's phone out of his hands. Every half hour, Osborn sent a new photo of Peter. Each time he had a new injury. Below each photo was a reminder of how much time remained. Tony was visibly crumbling more and more with each new text. The phone pinged with a new one. Steve willed himself not to look but did anyway. It wasn't a photo this time, it was a video.
"You people should have alerted me of the situation much sooner," Fury continued. "The moment Peter told you what happened, you should have contacted me. All this bullshit could have been resolved by now."
"No. It's not. You're seventeen, Peter. You need to stop carrying the world on your shoulders." Natasha sighed.
The assistant looked around nervously. "Sorry, Doctor Banner has been at large for years. The Avengers, SHIELD, the FBI, no one has been able to find him-"
"I don't need input from either of you." Fury snapped. "If you're so worried, doctor Banner, then, by all means, follow along."
"H-Harry, please..." Peter stammered, his spider sense was screaming at him. His hand ghosted over the panic button in his pocket. No. He had to fix this himself. He held up both hands in surrender. "I don't want to fight you. Please put the gun down."
Toomes nodded slowly. "Don't stay out here too long, you'll catch a cold." He pat Peter on the head, then got to his feet and stretched. "We need to get you some actual clothes. You can't wear that costume forever. That's a project for another day, though. Goodnight, Pete." Adrian waved before walking back inside.
Tony wasn't sure how long he lay in the snow. Hours? Days? Weeks? Who knows. It was still dark out when he regained consciousness. It was still unbearably cold, too. He almost panicked when he couldn't feel his toes, but then remembered he didn't have any. Snow had piled up on him while he was out. He jerked his head to the side to knock the flakes out of his eyes. The snow was coming down at a slow, steady pace, the tiny flakes fluttering in the breeze. Little flecks of white against the black shadows of the surrounding trees. The snow sucked all of the noise out of the air. The only sound was Tony's ragged breathing. The silence made Tony shiver even more than he already was. He tried to sit up, but the armor was completely dead and he didn't have the strength to move several hundred pounds of frozen metal.
Steve watched the robot climb into the air, sparks shooting out of the tears in his body. "Natasha, please tell me you have that Quinjet ready," Steve said into his comm.
"Heading home for the holidays, Hawkeye?" Steve nodded at the suitcase propped up on the couch. Next to it was a trash bag full of Christmas gifts.
"What kind of nonsense?" Tony's heart ached. He wanted nothing more than to hold Peter in his arms and promise him that everything would be alright. Now he was stuck in a cell somewhere he didn't recognize, with his torturer tending to his wounds. The kid must be terrified.
Steve was silent for a moment. "During the war, I saw many good men experience shell shock. I know that we hardly know each other and that you don't really see me as a friend, but I'm here if you want to talk about it."
"Well? What are we waiting for? Call Osborn back and let him know we have it," Steve handed over Tony's phone.
Kraven was about to say something else but he was cut off by the doorbell. "Don't go anywhere." Kraven checked the chains one last time before heading up the rickety staircase.
"Then stop gawking at Steve." Natasha raised her fists. Tony's eyes flicked over to the super soldier, who was using a punching bag on the other side of the gym. Tony flipped up the hood of his jacket, blocking his view of the other man. "Please take this seriously."
Tony nodded before slipping his helmet on. "Spider-man's old suit, the one that had an AI, recorded everything he saw. I remember seeing this place back when the vulture was causing problems. If Spidey's going after the same people as before, then this would've been his first stop." Tony lead the team across the street. Natasha and Clint stuck to the bushes, planning to lay low until Steve called them in for back up. Steve fell in to step with Tony, shield at the ready. War Machine and the Falcon weren't far behind.
Iron Man suddenly blasted ahead of the two super soldiers, crashing through the treetops and scattering branches and leaves everywhere. "I'm picking up some weird signatures. I'm going to check them out."
"It's quiet," Natasha commented. Pale gray light filtered in through the large windows. The only real light in the room came from the flashing red and green bulbs of the Christmas tree. "It wasn't this quite last year."
"I need to know what the wound is this time," Natasha reminded him. She had been keeping a list so that they would be prepared when they rescued their favorite wall crawler. Steve glanced over at Tony, who nodded. Steve took a deep breath and pressed play. The footage showed Peter, still chained to the wall. Crimson soaking various parts of his body.
"Hey," Peter said shyly, eyes dancing around her dress taking in every detail. "You look...amazing." The smile she gave him had Peter's heart melting. He was so hopelessly in love. And happy. He realized right then and there that he was, for the first time in a very long time, one hundred percent happy.
"I changed my mind. I'm going to just make my robot into one giant leg," Tony pointed the screwdriver at Peter. "It's sole purpose in life will be to hop around and kick everyone in the shins." Peter burst out laughing at the image of a tiny robotic leg bouncing around the compound.
"I won't!" Tony tightened his grip on the child. Steve pushed a chair behind him, and Tony was more than grateful to be able to sit down.
"I don't want to fight you, Steve!" Tony took a defensive stance but refused to activate any of his weapons.
"You sure?" Thor asked, his hand ghosting over Bruce's back. The god didn't seem at all bothered by the cold, or the snowflakes fluttering in the breeze.
"Hence the Captain America get up," Iron Man nodded once. "I'm fine, Steve. I just needed to prove something to myself."
"Oh," Clint shifted around a bit awkwardly, his shoes squeaking on the floor. "But you two spend so much time together."
"So instead of explaining the situation, and making sure he would know exactly how to fight back, you put him under house arrest. Makes sense." Steve leaned against Peter's desk, giving his boyfriend a disapproving look.
It was still early in the morning. By the time everyone woke Peter would be long gone. He opened the window and was met with a cold breeze. Spider-man shivered and decided to put on his jacket. He sat on the windowsill for another minute, looking out over the facility. The sun hadn't quite risen, the sky a pale gray. A light dusting of frost covered the ground.
Other the next several weeks, Henry the tarantula went wherever Peter went. Except on patrol, of course. Henry would follow Peter or sit on his shoulder. The whole ordeal was quite odd to Stark, but no one else seemed to question it, so Tony didn't. At one point Tony found Peter asleep on the couch. The tarantula sat on his chest as if guarding the unconscious man. Tony went over to Peter, planning to pull a blanket over him, but the spider sprang up, it's first four arms raised in warning.
Fury gave a rushed apology before directing everyone's attention back to the robot on the table. "Should I be concerned about this thing waking up?"
Natasha stared at Bruce in a mix of shock and pain. "Tell me it's not true...tell me you would never hurt Peter."
Iron Man put their foreheads together. "God, Steve. You're such a fucking sap. But I love you. And I do want to be with you. I just don't know how this is going to work."
"Can we trust each other?" Vision asked, "you all have been hiding various secrets from one another. I think it would be difficult for us all to stay a team after recent events."
"What's-oh...OH." Bruce's eyes nearly bulged out of his head. "I had no idea...this...this explains a lot."
"Oh, just fine, thank you for asking." Norman Osborn answered. "Mr. Parker is not available at the moment. Can I take a message?"
"Y-yeah, just peachy," he grunted when he landed on the wall. After hours of searching empty hideouts, they had finally found what they were looking for. Adrian's former workers had been putting up quite a fight so far. But they were all too focused on taking down Spidey, leaving them vulnerable to attacks from the rest of the Avengers. The Shocker was the only one fully capable of holding his own. The warehouse they fought in was about to cave in, it's walls and roof torn apart by various repulsor blasts and other energy beams fired by the Vulture's former workers. Spidey did his best to web up any failing supports, not wanting to end up trapped under a building. Again.
Tony's eyes flitted around the room. He was in a lab of some kind. Complete with test tubes filled with strange liquids and trays lined with pointy objects. Fun.
The box he was currently going through didn't contain anything he needed. It was mostly personal items that had been marked "trash". Like clothes and what not. And apparently a few of Steve's drawings. These drawings would've been tacked up on the wall by the sink, but Tony had torn them all down and stuffed them in the box without a second thought.
"Sir, I'm detecting an unusually high level of intelligence from the arachnid on the table," Friday spoke up suddenly.
Peter smiled softly, watching his son vanish into the distance. Anthony hadn't had much of an interest in being Iron Man, much to Tony's disappointment. That job fell to May, who was already on the Mark 4 of the Iron Woman armor.
"Here," Steve tapped Iron Man's helmet with a water bottle. The Avenger sat on the curb, taking a short break now that the chaos had died down.
"As Hulk and Spider-man, yes. We could have. Then you had to go and..." Peter made a noise of disgust.
"Sir, you've only gotten three hours of sleep in the past two days. I would advise against using the suit." Jarvis' voice was unwavering.
Peter continued talking. "It'll be fun, though. The three of us could go on patrol together afterward-"
As he worked on rewriting his own code, he thought about who his first target should be. Hawkeye? Weakest human among them. Seems like the logical choice.
Sneaking into the station wasn't difficult. Getting through the trap door in the back room was. It was made of metal and had a heavy duty locking system. After several tries, Peter gave up and ripped the door off its hinges. A long ladder led down into a dark pit. Faint voices made their way up to the Wallcrawler. A soft blue light shone from the very bottom. Silently, Spider-man slid down the ladder until the pit opened up into a large room. From there, Spidey moved onto the ceiling.
"Harry...I'm sorry, it was an accident, I didn't..." Harry took a step towards Peter, causing the shorter man to step back. The expression on Harry's face was dark. Cold. Angry. Peter had never seen him like this. "It was an accident. He was gonna kill my dad, I didn't-"
Michelle didn't like that idea. "Natasha and Clint have been teaching me to fight, and I have a gun-"
"Good. Pepper, stay here. I'm going to get our team back." He started up the beach, now clad in nothing but his black under armor.
"You bastards are too late. They got him." The man next to Natasha sneered. "Spider-man's done for."
"You could've talked to him. Before it got to that point. Hell, you're Captain America! If anyone has a chance of fighting against Iron Man and winning, it's you!"
Tony’s eyes lit up. Spending time with Bucky had been one of the things he fantasized about when he had been held captive. Bucky was still his best friend, and he had missed him dearly. “Yeah! Give me a sec!” Tony fluttered around the workshop, looking for his shoes and coat.
"Thor, you barely know him. Yes, he's a good fighter, but he's reckless and cares about other people way too much for his own good. Now is definitely not the time for him to be off on his own."
"Morning," Iron Man's voice startled Steve, causing him to fall out of the bed. Steve poked his head up and found that Iron Man's eyes had flicked back on. "Sleep alright?"
Spider-man tensed. Someone in the Avengers...someone in his family...had hired Doc Ock to kidnap him?
Peter glanced back at Steve, who refused to meet Peter's gaze. Tony was deathly silent, staring at Steve in disbelief. Natasha fidgetted, eyes downcast. They hadn't known the extent of what Bruce had been doing until it was too late. They both regretted not telling anyone when they first found out.
"What did they say about me, exactly?" Spider-man opened one of his lenses wider than the other. Clint was giggling in the corner. "Nevermind, I don't want to know."
"It's already messing with my head!" At this point, Peter was in panic mode. "Is it gonna take away my memories?!" He didn't want to forget. Not again. Peter tugged at his mask, but the black goo wouldn't budge.
"He needs medical help!" He webbed up the man's mangled legs, trying to stop the bleeding. Wanda yanked Peter to his feet by the back of his shirt. She took the gun out of the holster on his leg and slapped it against his chest.
Steve closed his sketchbook and looked over at the robot once more. He had told Clint that he didn't. But in all honesty, he wasn't sure. He reminded himself that no matter how human Iron Man acted, he was still just a robot.
"I understand," Osborn held out his hand for Bruce to shake. "I'll get him for you, you have my word."
In a flash, Spider-man had drawn the gun and pointed it at Tony. "One more step and I will do it." He warned, clicking off the safety.
At first, Steve thought he was talking to him and Thor, but then Iron Man and War Machine stepped out of the shadows.
The light vanished, and Peter fell to the ground in a heap. He clawed at his chest as he gulped down oxygen. Scarlet Witch had also collapsed. Blood spilling from the hole in the back of her skull, pooling around her head in a dark crimson that looked so much like her own magic.
The Avengers were wandering around the small building, snooping around the various cabinets. Natasha had found a first aid kit and was now properly tending to Clint's broken ankle.
Tony groaned as he slowly sat up, running both hands over his face and through his tangled hair. "Ugh...sleeping on the floor...bad idea. Ow." He stretched, popping his back. "so...radio tower. That was the plan right?"
"I'm going to be back you guys," Peter groaned at the way everyone was treating his move out as such a final thing. "I'm not quitting the team."
"Obadiah is building an army. What are we going to do when he decides to unleash it?" Iron Man's tone was dark.
"Of course," Steve gave him a warm smile. Natasha helped Peter up and led him out of the room. Steve nodded at Wanda and Clint, signaling for them to go with Peter and Nat. Just in case.
"MJ, please, we just want to help," Natasha shoved her way in front of everyone. "We won't hurt him-"
"NO!" Tony panicked, shoving the director back. Out of the corner of his eye he saw both Steve and Bucky jump to their feet. He spun around, pushing the agents away. "DON'T TOUCH ME." Iron Man backed into the wall, repulsors raised.
Bruce rolled his eyes. There was no reason for Tony to be working on his arm in the middle of the living room right before movie night. They had all watched him disconnect the appendage, drop it on the coffee table and walk away. Which had freaked them out. Especially Steve. Tony returned a few minutes later, with a toolbox in his remaining hand.
"You can't control everything. I trust you, Steve. I trust you to bring my body back here and help me get patched up if something does happen." Iron Man looked up at him, faceplate as unreadable as ever.
"Give me a minute. FRI, did this file get moved already?" Tony typed the name in again and it still came up blank.
"No...you're not...you've...you..." Bucky went over to Iron Man, hands shaking as he removed the helmet. Tony let him take it off. "You're not a bot...?"
The Wall Crawler and the Goblin clashed without mercy. Iron Man hung back at first, simply watching as the two men battled above the city. He didn't get involved until they crashed into the top level of a parking garage. The duo quickly recovered from the initial shock of hitting the pavement and flipped back onto their feet. Green Goblin darted forward, while Spider-man took an offensive stance, knelt down with one fist behind him and one wrist bared and ready to fire a web. Iron Man swooped in and knocked the Goblin to the ground. Osborn's glider restarted itself and tried to impale Iron Man in the back. The glider pierced the outer layer of the armor but didn't get much further. Tony merely grunted and tossed the offending object to the side. Meanwhile, Osborn was taking a pumpkin bomb out of his satchel. Spider-man webbed it to his hand before he could throw it.
"Absolutely. You can put one on if you want. I'm sure Clint would enjoy the change in music. You know where the record player is," Iron Man said with a wave of his hand.
"Actually, Rhodey and Sam haven't done a damn thing wrong," Peter smiled. "Well, Sam doesn't share his cookies with me, but that's okay."
"You still love animals. The zoo has a new exhibit on creepy crawlies. You'll fit right in." Tony reached over and poked his cheek. Peter made an offended noise, causing Tony to chuckle, "okay, bug boy. No zoo. What about the movies?"
The sound came from directly behind Steve, and he knew the blast had been aimed at him. Surprisingly, Steve felt no pain. No searing burns from pure energy striking his flesh. Instead, he heard a cry of pain and felt someone fall against him. The moment he looked over his shoulder, his blood turned to ice. Tony had just taken the hit for him. The shorter man fell to the floor, hands clutching his chest. The armor that had shot him lunged for Steve. Thankfully, Thor came to the soldier's aid, using his hammer to destroy it before it got. Thor gave Steve a short nod before flying off.
Peter smiled at the photo, absent mindedly scratching the scar on his left arm. He looked down at his forearms when he realized what he was doing. A thin scar ran from the palm of his hand all the way up to the inside of his elbow. One on each arm. He had talked to Tony about possibly removing the web spinners, but Tony was afraid they could badly damage his arms in the process. So Peter had learned to live with it. He rarely used the organic webs, opting for his classic web shooters. The organic webs were only used as an absolute last resort.
Steve held his gaze, "I'm sorry to hear that, Doctor Banner. Maybe if you listen to this recording you'll reconsider-"
. I admire your determination, but I refuse to let you get involved. Stay here." He slammed the door in her face before she could protest.
Rhodey groaned loudly. Steve barreled across the burned down building, practically tackling his teammate. "Is he okay?! I need to see him! Where is he now?!" Bucky handed the phone over, and Steve repeated his frantic questions.
Tony frowned at the tank. Henry had definitely grabbed Tony's interest. He wanted to find out more about the spider. Maybe run some tests. Would Peter allow him to do that, though? He could study the spider while Peter was asleep. But what if the spider told Peter? Tony resisted the urge to slap himself.
"Nice to meet you, Peter. I wish I could say that I've heard a lot about you, but unfortunately," Steve glanced at Tony. Tony just shrugged.
"I ain't telling you shit until I see him." Tony looked up at Fury. He sounded angry, but he didn't look it. He just looked...sad.
"Please just drop it. Okay?" Tony got up and went outside. He sat on the porch, looking up at the sky. The storm had passed, and the stars twinkled down at them. Steve took a seat next to him, not saying a word. He raised his head when he heard Tony mumble something about the moon. "Hm?"
Iron Man slammed down behind Osborn, cracking the concrete. He slowly rose from the crouch he landed in, blue eyes blazing. "Stop playing with your food, Spider-man. Let's finish this-the hell?" Tony had started to pull back his arm for a punch, but the armor clamped up. Osborn raised an eyebrow at the now frozen Iron Man. He turned his attention back to Peter, who was already back on his feet. The HUD in Iron Man's helmet suddenly went dark. It started up again a moment later. The soft blues of the various readings had been replaced with red. "No, no, no, not again. Don't do this, Bruce!"
Tony slowly closed the fridge and turned to face Clint. He expected to see a look of hatred. Betrayal. Cold eyes that clearly said they were not friends. Strangely enough, he didn't see any of that on the other man's face. In fact, Clint looked fairly relaxed. He was leaning against the island, arms crossed over his chest, a neutral expression on his face. "I'm just getting breakfast, I'll be out of your way soon."
. The buck glanced at each of them as it moved around them, stepping up onto the bank. Its pupil-less eyes fell onto Tony, who was standing at the tree line. It grunted and lowered its massive head. Then, it charged. Right at Tony.
"Okay. First, rude," Tony took a deep breath. "Second, Peter is almost 18. Sometimes he lives here, sometimes he lives at the tower, sometimes he stays with Ned, a buddy of his. Peter does his own thing. He'll show up somewhere eventually."
The Avengers followed Peter back to his apartment. Peter wasn't really trying to hide where he had gone. He went straight there. No doubling back or taking odd turns to confuse his family. He didn't really care if they followed, he just wanted to go home. And now the Avengers stood outside his door. Michelle being the only thing that kept them from barging in. Michelle opened the door just enough to glare at them. "No."
"Merry Christmas, Nat." Steve's voice broke through her thoughts. Natasha looked up to see the Captain standing next to the couch, holding a mug out to her with a fond smile.
Steve jolted, not realizing that he had like the anger show. "Sorry, Pete, I was zoning out. I think I'll leave the robotics to you guys. Not really my thing."
"Guess I'll face him head on. Again," Tony said, calling extra pieces to his armor. "FRIDAY, ready every single one of my suits. This one isn't going to last long."
"They might adore Iron Man. But they hate Tony Stark," Bucky picked up his bowl. "I'm going to break into the workshop. Make sure he's eating."
Bucky lept back to his feet. In the meantime, the intruder had landed and was glaring at Bucky. He took in the man's appearance. Black hair, goatee, facial prosthetic. He looked familiar, but Bucky was pretty sure he would remember someone with a glowing eye. The man made no move to attack so the Winter Soldier figured he might as well try to talk to him. "How did you get in here?"
The disappointment was clear on Steve's face as he watched one of his closest friends walk out. "Play the recording, Buck."
"You're right. The world does need Spider-man. Not Peter Parker, though. Someone else should take a turn web slinging. I'm done." Peter turned on heel and left the lab. Steve walked in right as Peter left, the two nodded at each other but said nothing.
Iron Man looked away, knowing that Bruce was right. "The AI I'm designing for it just needs more work. I'll be able to control it, just give me more time-"
"You know someone stole my schematics," Iron Man reminded Fury. "They already built one working bot. Who's to say they couldn't do it again? Don't you see that I've been framed?!"
All of a sudden, he stopped feeling light headed. His wounds closed on their own, the extreme blood loss he had been experiencing some how no longer an issue. Was the symbiote...helping him? Peter gathered his new found strength and broke his chains. Kraven stumbled back. Black tendrils shot out, impaling Kraven against the wall. They missed his vital organs, a mistake that the symbiote wouldn't make a second time.
"I don't know, but you need to stop using that thing or you'll drain your reactor!" Tony advised. He had only used his once during the entire fight and was now using his lasers and other small projectiles to take down the bots.
"That bastard," Steve spat. Iron Man flinched. "Sorry, I don't mean to disrespect your creator. But just because he made you with only one purpose in mind, doesn't mean you can't go beyond that. You didn't stick with the look he gave you, so why do you have to stick with any of his other plans? Heck, you already have a family that loves you. Why won't you let yourself be with someone special?" Steve shifted closer to him.
"If you can feel pain, then I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to get depressed." Steve frowned. "It's okay if you are. Everyone on the team is dealing with their own demons."
"You kept a pretty big secret for two years. Especially after Siberia. When we all agreed to not keep secrets," Steve pointed out.
"I don't know how much help I would be. I still can't figure out my email. But I'll do what I can, Shellhead." Steve tapped his knuckles on Iron Man's helmet in an affectionate way.
"Let's all just take a breathing, alright?" Sam held up his hands. The two men on the floor spat one last insult at one another before gathering up the machinery. Bucky set everything on the coffee table. Tony eyes his teammates, not sure if he should stay or not. Sam rolled his eyes, "sit down. We're cool, I guess."
"What?!" Tony bolted to his feet, eyes snapping to the window. Sure enough, there was something flying right at the tower. He acted on instinct, calling his armor to him and yelling at Jarvis to warn the Avengers. Jarvis set off the alarm just seconds before the missile crashed through the window.
"Something came loose and it kept shocking me!" Tony said. "Do you know how weird it is to have something constantly zapping your armpit? It's very weird! So I'm fixing the problem." He used a pair of pliers to fiddle with a wire. Sparks shot out of said wire and bit at Tony's hand. He frowned but otherwise didn't react.
"Really? We barely got you put back together last time!" Rhodes looked furious. Steve wondered what 'last time' Rhodes was talking about. Iron Man hadn't sustained any injuries in the past few months. And he definitely hadn't been in any explosions. It must have been before the Avengers assembled.
There was absolutely no hesitation in the way he responded with "of course not." Tony would let the world burn a million times over if it meant being able to see his son one last time. "We both mean business, Osborn. Neither of us is leaving here without what we came for." He raised his repulsor.
"Or else what?" Steve smirked. The repulsor in the robot's palm whirred to life. He pointed it at Steve's temple. Steve squinted at the light. "We both know that's an empty threat, Shellhead." Iron Man didn't move for a moment, but the light did eventually fade. His hands dropped on either side of Steve's head. Steve shifted around, not comfortable with almost four hundred pounds of metal sitting directly on his hips. "Get off of me."
"Good suggestion. I'll take it into consideration." Tony glanced over his shoulder at his son, "you good, kiddo?"
"This is actually about Spider-man. He's not exactly in the position to text anyone at the moment," Steve explained.
"Bruce is leaning towards leaving, too. And if he goes, then so will Thor," Rhodey sat back in his chair, drumming his fingers on the table.
"You do have a pretty wild imagination," Bucky ruffled his friend's hair. Steve swatted his hand away. He combed his fingers through his hair to fix the mess Bucky had caused.
"Rude!" Tony glared at his HUD. Steve had been trying to contact him for the past hour. The Captain's picture disappeared when Tony rejected his call for a tenth time. A picture immediately appeared again, but this time it was Bruce's. Tony took a deep breath and answered, "hey, big green!"
he told himself. Iron Man quickly turned his attention back to the screen in front of him. Having Steve at his side would have to be enough.
"Hey! Put him down!" Rhodey pushed his way into the crowd. Clint let go of Tony but didn't step away. "Give him room, Jesus!" Tony found himself pinned between the wall and Rhodey, who was acting as a human shield. Natasha was still directly to his left, practically breathing down his neck. Tony shivered. "He has his reasons. Back off and he'll explain."
"Figures..." Peter put his head in his hands. "I miss you guys. So, so, much. You should be here right now. Not me. All of your deaths are my fault. All of them. I'm so sorry." Tears pricked his eyes, but Peter refused to let them fall. Something silver caught his eye. A long thread that wove its way through the grass. Spider-man carefully picked it up and found it was connected to other threads, almost like a spider web. "A net?"
"Let's pay the Avengers a visit," Bruce decided, a slight smile on his face. "I wonder how much the compound has changed in the past two years."
Peter sat on the rooftop a bit longer before heading home. He slipped in through the back door, stepping carefully so he wouldn't wake anyone.
Iron Man recognized that voice. There was no mistaking the man that he had once seen as a father figure. Or maybe there was? His mind must be playing tricks on him. It had to be. Iron Man took a seat on what was left of the metal steps, putting his head in his hands and giving a heavy sigh. He was fairly certain that someone had been controlling that bot, whether it had been Obediah or not. But why hadn't they made a move to attack again? Tony's head pounded from the lack of sleep and alcohol. He really didn't want to deal with all of this right now.
"NO. HE CAME HOME. And I shot him at point blank range! I shot him right in the fucking face!!" Tony was in a tank top and gym shorts. No gun in sight. Or repulsor. There was also no Peter.
"Yeah, Pepper knows how to cook. But we both already knew that." Rhodey chuckled. He smiled as he watched Tony finish off the soup in a matter of minutes. A bit of life had returned to that dark brown eye, and that put part of Rhodey's mind at ease, gave him hope that Tony was going to be alright. When Rhodey had found him, lying in the middle of a road, half buried in the snow, he was sure that his friend was dead. When he had torn the faceplate off, and seen how much blood was on Tony's actual face...He thought for sure that it was all over. Thought that if Tony's face looked like that then there was no hope for the rest of his body. Once he got him cleaned up everything was surprisingly okay. He had sustained a head wound when he crashed, resulting in a lot of blood. And he had a lot of fresh scars on his body. Lots of recently healed cuts. His cybernetic parts could use a bit of tuning, but otherwise, he was okay.
It wasn't long before the entire team knew there was a tarantula on the loose. Everyone was determined to find it, although for different reasons. Steve, Wanda, and Bruce just wanted to find it for Peter's sake. Clint and Sam were afraid it would hurt someone. Natasha and Peter were afraid someone might hurt it. That someone being Tony. Vision floated through the tower, scanning for life forms. The Avengers seemed to have developed an ant problem, slowing down the android.
"I'm not." War Machine's faceplate flipped up, revealing a very human looking man. "One hundred percent human. This is just a suit of armor Iron Man made for me."
"You were missing for two days." Iron Man whispered. "Scared the shit out of me. God, Steve, I don't know what I'd do if you...if you had..." He tightened his grip on Steve's hands. "If you died, I would've kicked your ass."
"What do you mean, everything? What is there to know other than him being Spider-man?" Bruce slipped the document into his desk drawer, planning to burn it after the Captain left.
"I'm not in the mood for anything," Tony reminded him. Steve had rarely left his side this past week, wanting to make sure Tony was taking care of himself. And also to be there in case Tony had another hallucination. The constant babying annoyed Tony to no end, yet he was also somewhat grateful. He wouldn't have eaten or slept at all if it weren't for his teammate.
"Hey, Dad. Mom. Uncle Ben. Aunt May. How's it going?" Spider-man stood in front of a row of headstones. "Sorry, I haven't been by in awhile. Been a bit busy, with...well, everything." He sat cross legged, absentmindedly picking at the grass. He hadn't visited these particular graves since Aunt May's funeral. He remembered every detail about the event. How the skies had rained down as if the very earth was weeping for her loss. There was only a handful of people who showed up, but those who did truly cared about May and Peter, and had offered the boy a place to live. He remembered how heavy the casket had felt when Peter helped carry it. How Mr. Stark hadn't left his side the entire time, holding an umbrella up for both of them, because Peter forgot his. Both Happy and Tony allowed Peter to hug them and cry into their shoulders. He had gone back to the Avengers facility that night, not knowing that he would never set foot in Aunt May's apartment ever again. Not because he couldn't. Hell, Tony had driven him past the building more times than he could count, offering to help his box everything up and move it into storage, or into the compound. But Peter couldn't bring himself to do it. Happy had gathered Peter's belonging and a few of May's, and that had been the end of it. "Are you guys watching over me? Is that a real thing dead people do? Steve thinks so. Tony says it's bullshit. I don't know what to think anymore." He looked around the graveyard and had his suit scan for any signs of human life. None. He was all alone. He slipped his mask off and tucked it into his belt. "Tony is the one who adopted me by the way. I don't know if you guys already knew that or not. Having Iron Man as your dad is pretty cool...but I miss you guys. A lot."
Just then Pepper, donning the mark three, crashed through the far wall. With at least a dozen mark 43's on her tail. "TONY!!"
"Who cares? The Avengers shouldn't be picking fights in a cemetery. It's disrespectful," a masculine voice answered.
"So you found him. Thank god, I was so worried. I saw him take on those guys but he ran off, oh my gosh there was so much blood...is he going to be okay?" Ned's voice shook.
"Good, because we have our hands full as it is," Steve glanced over at Peter. Thor followed his gaze and looped an arm around the youngest Avenger. "You have grown into a fine young man, Peter Parker! I remember you being much shorter! And you finally have some muscles on those bones!"
Spider-man nodded slowly, remembering how his spider sense had painfully spiked when the black van rolled up beside him.
Spider-man mustered up all his strength and pushed past Steve, running straight for the intruder. Or intruders? He was still seeing double. He wasn't even aware that one of the tentacles had grabbed him until it yanked him off his feet and flung him outside. Spider-man tumbled through the mud and skidded to a halt. The intruder was making his way right for him.
"On it," Natasha was already retrieving the first aid kit by the emergency exit. "Let's get you fixed up, little spider."
Tony aggressively smacked the sun visor up. About a week after Bucky found out his secret, Tony had found a tuna fish sandwich on his workbench. From there, Bucky kept leaving him more and more food. If the Avengers ever went out to eat, Bucky would bring his leftovers back to Tony. If they had a party, Bucky would sneak out a plate of food and put it in Tony's fridge for later. Which kind of irked the cyborg. He had his own food and didn't need Bucky watching over him like a lost puppy. He appreciated the gesture, but it was still annoying. Luckily, Tony only felt that way in the beginning. After a month of Bucky shoving food in his face, Tony stopped putting up a fight. And now the cyborg expected his share of food every time the Avengers went out for dinner. None of the Avengers questioned why Bucky took home leftovers from every event, he was, after all, a super soldier and needed the extra calories. The hard part was keeping Clint from stealing them on the way home.
Steve jumped out of a window, and darted across the patio, on his way to help Clint. Right as he flung his shield at the bots, one of his questions was answered. Obadiah plucked him off the ground and lifted him into the sky. Steve let out a surprised shout. He kicked his arms and legs, desperately fighting against his captor. He stopped struggling when they reached a height where a fall would have differently killed him, despite being a super soldier.
The enemy bot clawed at the hole in Iron Man's faceplate, screaming, "SHOW ME YOUR FACE, YOU COWARD!"
Wanda and Bruce were completely oblivious to what was going on behind them. Peter pressed the button again, trying to switch it off. The button kept flashing no matter what he did.
"Think the big one is the mom?" Clint asked, looking back at the smaller dragon still perched on the log.
"What is that thing doing on the table?" Tony pointed his fork at Henry. The tarantula was hiding behind the butter dish, munching away on a piece of watermelon.
"FRIDAY wasn't kidding about the rain...that's one hell of a storm," Natasha commented as she sipped her wine. "Are we sure Thor isn't visiting the compound?"
I started writing this chapter at 10pm and now it is 2am. I said I wasn't going to write this until next week, but then I got a bunch of ideas so...ya know.
One of the bots came up behind Tony and grabbed him. Tony shot into the air, crashing through the ceiling and climbing into the sky.
"It's a pain in the ass, but I can." Tony shrugged. "Can you get me my coffee mug? It's on the workbench." Bucky did as he asked while Tony continued talking. "My arm never causes me this much trouble." Bucky handed Tony the mug, earning a small "thank you" from the cyborg. "And it's hard to walk with them."
Henry chirped and ran off. He returned a few minutes later with Spider-man's mask, dragging it behind him with his two hind legs.
"Does anyone know? About me?" Peter asked. He knew he had still been in costume when Tony brought him to the med bay. He didn't know who was present when that happened.
"We have three minutes left. Hurry." The agent let go of Tony and continued running down the hall. Tony took a deep breath to steady himself and followed the mysterious agent. The agent led the group up a maintenance stairwell and onto the top deck.
Tony pulled a pile of napkins out his pillowcase. They contained more pictures of Ultron, along with some notes about how he could improve the design for Ultron's AI.
Steve took a deep breath and pulled a stool over to sit next to Tony. "Because Spider-man is a part of Peter. He can't just walk away from it, no matter how much he wants to. Peter won't be able to turn a blind eye to all the bad things in this world. He cares too much. Has to strong of a need to help those less fortunate. We'll have to give him some time, but he will come around."
"Very well, Spider. Fight me all you like. You will be coming with me when this is all over, either way."
"You were in control of the suit at the time. Not him," Peter's hand ghosted over his chest, but he quickly pulled away from it. "You've caused all my scars."
"If you got involved then you would've gotten hurt too, dummy." Tony huffed. "You can always put me back together. But I can't do the same with you."
Steve picked up the notebook he found under all the papers and flipped through it. It was all designs for the first Spider-man suit Tony made. A photograph slipped out of the pages and into Steve's lap. At first glance, Steve thought it was just a picture of Tony and his son. But the man next to Tony looked too old to be Peter, and Tony looked a lot younger than Steve had ever seen him. The two men were in the middle of laughing, with the Peter look alike pointing to something unseen.
Tony moved over to sit on the edge of the bed. "Peter, listen...I'm sorry. This is my fault. I should have never created that monster. I'm so, so sorry." He gave Peter the most sincere look he could muster. "And I'm sorry I wasn't able to separate you from it."
"Sam and I can go look for him," Rhodey offered. "You guys can go. We can just fly back home if we don't find him."
"What the hell is going on?" Natasha yelled over the explosions. The explosions were only big enough to destroy the suits themselves, not doing much harm to the area around them. The smoldering debris they left in their wake did more damage than the actual explosions. Ultron howled in rage before his collective consciousness retreated from the suits, vanishing back into the depths of the internet.
Spider-man reached under his mask and ripped the communicator out of his ear. Lightning flashed right as Spider-man lunged for Doc Ock.
Tony nodded in agreement. "I kinda hope Strange didn't return all his memories. He's suffered a lot these past few months. I don't want him developing PTSD before he even graduates high school."
"Spider-man! Spider-man, answer me damnit!" Steve yelled over the comms. The quinjet was quickly approaching their location. "We saw the explosion. What's going on down there?"
The doors flung open. A single SHIELD agent stepped into the room. He stood there a minute, looking around at all the cells. A blacked out gas mask hid his face. The walkie talkie on his shoulder crackled. He held it close to his chin as he spoke. "We're all good here. Everyone's accounted for. No need to send backup." As soon as he got an 'Okay' from the person on the other end, he typed something into the control panel. All the energy fields lifted. "We have five minutes until all the security feeds are back online."
"STEVE!!" Iron Man shrieked, diving for him. He wasn't going fast enough. There was too much distance between them.
"What is Venom?!" Peter asked again, a bit more forcefully this time. "What the hell did you create?" He glared at his father.
"N-no. I think I would remember if we had," Peter shifted around awkwardly, leaning on his uninjured leg. He had taken a bad fall and cut his thigh on the side of a dumpster. The entire ordeal could have been completely avoided if he wasn't showing off for Ned and Michelle. Not his most heroic injury.
Meanwhile, Tony was dragging himself to the stairwell that led to his workshop. The arc reactor was scraping along the floor, its light flickering wildly. He could feel the shrapnel in his chest start to move. His body felt heavy. It was getting a little difficult to breathe. Tony grabbed the railing and pulled himself to his feet. Not too much further. He can make it. One foot in front of the other. God, his chest felt like it was on fire. Breath. In. Out. Breath. Tony's knees gave out. With a shout, he tumbled down the steps, hitting the bottom with a loud thud. The light in his chest went out.
"I'm not going to hurt you like that," Tony tightened his grip on his son. "We'll get you back to how you were before. It'll be okay."
"That's not something I want to hear. Last thing this world needs is another screw up like me," Tony stabbed his rice with a plastic fork.
"Please tell me you're here to free us. The food sucks ass," Sam leaned against the force field, arms crossed.
"Sneak out," Michelle said. She and Ned had called him over skype early the next morning before training started. They both looked extremely relieved to see him alive.
Tony stood in the doorway of Peter's old room, hands shoved in his pockets. Peter sat on the bed, his back to Tony. The room had been turned into a guest bedroom, with plain white sheets on the bed, and matching curtains for the window. The hole in the wall had also been repaired. It was as if Peter had never lived there in the first place. "I'm sorr-"
"Yeah," Steve took a deep breath to compose himself. "Iron Man was being careless and messed up his arm. It just took awhile to put back together, is all."
"I think so...really tired..." Peter closed his eyes again. Seventeen years of living had literally flashed before his eyes. That was a lot to take in. 'God, I need to get my shit together,' Peter thought. "Goodnight."
"My name is Iron Man, you ignorant swine," Iron Man chose that moment to make his presence known. His metal feet clinking on the floor as he stormed over to the archer. Most of the team had gathered in the kitchen for dinner. Tony hadn't been planning to stick around, but then he heard his name and decided otherwise.
"You seriously thought I was going to kill him? Don't be stupid. I'm going to use him to kill Stark." Wanda glared at the Captain. "I want Stark to know true pain. The agony of losing a family member. I want to watch him be torn apart, mentally and physically by the person he cares about most. I want to see the look of torment in his eyes as his own son rips out his heart."
"These people have been feeding you lies for years," Bruce went on. "Steve and Natasha knew what I'd done from the start. They found out about my experiments right after Tony introduced us to you. But they kept their mouths shut."
Tony stood up, "we're not going anywhere until we have answers. What's up with this?" He motioned at the screen, having paused right when Norman was dragging Spidey into the room.
"Not yet. It's only Monday, though. Everyone misses you at decathlon practice. Flash is still spreading rumors about you. The latest one is that you're hiding out in the woods, living as a cannibal." Michelle smirked.
"I told you. I wasn't in control of the armor. Nick, please, you know Peter means the world to me. I would do anything for him. Anything. Please let me see him. He's probably having a panic attack right now and I'm the only one who can help him through it."
Tony laid awake in that bed, thinking about his life, weighing his options, and wallowing in self-pity. He had come to the cabin to sleep before his final mission. But he didn't get one ounce of rest that night.
Tony tightened his grip on the tablet. The red dot had broken away from the area but only made it a few blocks before it stopped. It bounced between two building for a brief moment before stopping altogether.
Tony clenched his fists. If the dragon had hurt Steve...there would be hell to pay. Tony didn't dare think of the possibility that Steve could already be dead. He couldn't afford to think like that right now. The thought of Steve being dead caused a lump to form in his throat. He didn't know what he'd do if he lost Steve. Or what he would do if he lost anyone on the team. He had only known them for a month, but it felt like much longer. In a way, they had become a dysfunctional family. Speaking of, there was still no sign of the other Avengers. Tony wasn't too excited about the probability of facing the dragon alone, but neither he nor Steve had the luxury of waiting for back up.
The phone buzzed again, this time with a call from 'American Dad'. Peter answered this time, "hello?"
Venom bucked, throwing Steve off of him. He flipped onto all fours, hissing again before going for Steve's jugular.
Bruce took off his jacket and threw it at Spider-man. "Let's try not to be too suspicious. Okay?" Peter nodded in agreement and quickly zipped the black jacket up over his brightly colored spandex. Wanda slapped a helmet over his face.
"What's wrong with me, Buck?" Steve put his head in his hands. Bucky had been sparring with Steve, but the soldier couldn't seem to focus, so they decided to take a break.
Peter hesitated before aiming his left wrist at the ceiling and pressing his palm with two fingers. Sure enough, a strand of web shot out and latched onto the ceiling. "whoa..." Peter held the end of the strand in his hands, examining the countless tiny fibers twisted together.
"No, no, no, no, no-" Tony was chanting over and over. Tears fell freely from his face, shaky hands held over an empty spot on the floor.
"You know about Peter? And you have his number?" Sam glared at Tony. "You trust bug boy with this and not us?"
Tony shifted, a pained whine escaping his throat. Steve looked at him worriedly. It must have been around midnight, and the Avengers were sprawled out around the living room. Steve sat by the door, keeping watch while his teammates slept. "Stark?" The man in question rolled onto his back, hands clutching the reactor hidden under his shirt. Tony muttered something in his sleep, something that sounded like "stop". Tony had made himself a blanket nest on the floor but he had been moving so much in his sleep that he now lay on the bare floor, one of the blankets tangled around his leg. Steve moved closer to him, hand hovering over his shoulder.
"Maybe I like having it there?" Tony tossed the tray onto his cot. It bounced off and clattered on the floor.
"We were hoping you knew," Clint frowned. "I think you were the last to see him. Stane didn't bring him along with you?"
Steve rose to his feet. He rolled his shoulders and took a deep breath. "We leave in five." His tone was firm. Demanding. No room for arguing. Bucky, Bruce, and Natasha scrambled out of the room.
Peter was allowed to join the team for dinner for the first time that week. He sat in between Natasha and Clint, dragging his potatoes around his plate with a spoon.
"He was. But he's gone now." Natasha said. "Should we check the surrounding towns? I think the closest one is five miles north of here"
Steve glanced over at Tony, whispering, "how does he know that? I thought you disabled the security cameras and-"
"Mind your business," Peter snapped. "It's just stuff for Henry." The wall crawler was visibly shaking, looking like he might fall from the ceiling at any moment. "You scared the shit outta me." Everything was starting to become hazy. His spider sense pounding in the back of his head. Pure fear suddenly gripped his heart and he felt his entire body go numb.
"I really don't want to get trapped under another building, Wanda." Peter lunged at her again, fists raised.
"I do get out. Quite often, actually." Tony flipped down the sun visor in order to check his appearance in the mirror. He had the hood of his sweatshirt pulled up, and a pair of dark sunglasses hiding the glow of his robotic eye. It was August, and much too hot for the man to be in all black, but Tony was too stubborn to wear anything but.
"So, this is the murder bot?" Clint poked at the robot's head. It was completely drained of power, Natasha having found it discarded in a ditch not far from Hammer's home.
