"John?" queries anohter. "You alright, mate?"
Sherlock cleared a few spaces, knowing where everything was amongst this disaster of a lounge. John did not wish to impose by trying to help him, for he felt it would not be appreciated. So when Sherlock froze mid-motion and darted towards the window, leaping over stacks of books with a maniacal grin on his face, John's heart thudded in excitement.
“Doctor Watson wishes to know if your brother has mentioned a William, sir.”
Sherlock can’t block out the words like “malnutrition”, “abuse”, and “rape kit”. Gentle hands guide him to lie down on the bed. More doctors come in and they examine him, checking him over like he’s something to be poked at under the microscope. He loses all sense of time and stares blankly at the ceiling, simply answering ‘yes’ to all their questions, no matter what they’re asking for. Eventually, most of them leave. A nurse passes him a fresh pair of underpants and helps him slip them on. He glances over her shoulder and catches his reflection in the mirror. It’s a good thing Jack had been asleep before. He looks awful. There are ugly bruises all over his body, his sickly pale complexion making them stand out all the more. He’s far too skinny, his skin stretched over his bones. How is he ever going to overcome this? He runs his hands over his shaved head, his hair slightly shorter than John’s and all he can see is Them. They’ve left their mark on him. He’ll put on weight, his hair will grow back and the bruises will fade but this image will be burned forever in his memory. No matter how hard he tries, he knows this is something he’ll never be able to delete.
“Of course, missus,” said James, contritely. “This is a very fine house. Not as grand and elegant as Sherringford, but very fine for London, I’m sure.”
“Doctor Watson,” said Mycroft Holmes, the saturnine presence otherwise known – or rather mainly unknown – as the Eighth Earl of Sherringford. “How are you?”
“Lord, Holmes,” I said. “You sound like a perfect socialist! I admit bees appear admirable creatures, but do they create great works of art? Compose beautiful music? Write uplifting literature?”
Charles winced, but nodded. I helped him sit up straighter. “You may trust Mr. Holmes. The words you speak will not pass from this room.”
“Yes,” I said. “I still believe.”
“Of course not,” I replied.
The dog answered with a rude noise – which did not issue from his mouth.
“A Jesuit school. In Yorkshire.”
“My files,” he explained. “For my cases. I also have a few simple items for some experiments I’ve been working on. I hope you don’t mind the occasional puff of smoke?”
“And if you don’t, Major,” said Holmes, more gently. “It could mean the death of your son. So which will it be?”
“We have no business at all,” I said, steadying myself. “When I left you it was forever, as you well know. You let me go and that was the end of it. Except it is you who keep coming back to me. It is not the other way around.”
“On the contrary, there is much to say.” Holmes began pacing back and forth, puffing smoke like a freight train. “Blackmail, suicide attempts – these things do not occur out of thin air!”
“What about a towel?” I suggested.
“Don’t be coy, John!” she chastised. “Have you not taken money from Lord Brigham and that loathsome Arthur Spencer? Do you not know they are the most notorious pair who have ever been banished from England and forced to take refuge in Italy, where buggery is not simply tolerated, but practically a requirement?”
“Can’t you guess?” he said, his voice very faint. “He... seduced me. No, seduce is too kind a word. He forced me. He had been plying me with affection all summer, petting me and telling me that we were perfect companions. Soul-mates, he called it. That together we would perform great deeds and build an empire.”
Mick frowned. “Just about everybody, Guv’nor. Bill owed money to every bookmaker in town, as well as being in arrears at a score of pubs that was stupid enough to advance him credit. That’s why he was so hard on Charlie Griffith – Bill knew there was lots of money there. But even with the other gents we put the finger on, Bill always took the lion’s share, while me and Dilly got the leavings.”
“A Vital Alteration”
“No, thank you, Mrs. Hudson. I’m not very hungry this morning.”
What was to be done? Mick Wiggins and his frail compatriot were in very deep difficulty. But Holmes would find a way to clear them. He had to find a way! The alternative for them was unthinkable.
It was my bad shoulder, but I tried not to flinch.
And so we travelled. I revisited the great cities – Paris, Florence, Venice, Rome – but this time seeing them from grand carriages and opulent villas instead of the small pensiones and café s of only a few years before. In France and Italy a wealthy man with a kept boy was nothing unusual. Perhaps they gossiped about us behind our backs, but we were always welcomed, even fawned over. That is what money and power can do – even more so than extreme beauty, it will open any door.
Sherlock smirks at John’s language, but doesn’t reprimand him. Instead he pulls off his gloves and coat and hangs them up on the rack. Then he turns back to John and holds out his hands, shy and vulnerable. John grasps them in his own. They’re slightly clammy to the touch.
“Yes, we discussed family and it was the logical conclusion.”
John doesn't know how to approach the William Problem, but he convinces himself to let it be. Mycroft took note but hasn't mentionned it, only asking for Sherlock's precise actions as he ran across that field. Then he called Lestrade and left.
I run back to her bathroom where she is clearing up. I hug her tighter than ever. “I love you, Grandma.”
If only She had known that Jack looked nothing like her. Seeing him only would have made her realise what a failure She was.
She wipes her eyes with a tissue. “Let’s do it now shall we? I used to cut my husband’s hair, before your Pa got him executed. Wonderful man. And when you go back upstairs you can surprise John! He will be shocked. Let’s go to my bathroom.”
“Mrs. Hudson, it's very kind of you, but you really shouldn't have gone out of your way...”
“Of course! Besides, I’m the government. He knows better than to break his promise.”
Sherlock stammers helplessly. “I don’t… He said the truth.”
Mycroft Holmes returns to his office an hour later. He sits behind his desk and his eyes fall to the photograph of a 9 year old Sherlock in the pirate's outfit he intends to see Jack wear one day. He wonders if he's getting sentimental as he considers putting a photo of his nephew next to the one of his brother.
. John is slightly concerned that the British government will snap and get a headache, but Mycroft patiently answers all the questions fired at him. Glancing at Sherlock, he smiles when he realizes he has fallen asleep.
The baby sits next to the bed, a soft ball between his legs. William’s ball. The only toy Sherlock had been able to keep after They had taken all his belongings away.
Tell me what you think! ;)
This baby is terrified of him. He’s turning into a monster. Was this her plan? To turn him into a cruel being like Her? He starts to shake. He just wanted the mind games to stop, and he’s neglected a child. Hell, shouting at a baby probably qualifies as child abuse. A baby who is now screaming at him like he was the devil himself. Sherlock falls to his knees. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
I'm so sorry guys, this is very difficult to update because I am writing a thesis, but I love you all and this story is in NO WAY forgotten. Enjoy!
"It's a joke, John."
“Yes, you said Chain was your punishment for trying to leave Room, before I was born.”
he is gorgeous.
“Pa, why are we the same on inside, but not on outside?” asks Jack, curious.
The man’s face has been wiped of all rage, leaving nothing but the shell that had welcomed Jack when he had come back upstairs from Mrs. Hudson’s. “I didn’t mean…”
“Why?” I ask, because that hurt. Did he think I couldn’t do it?
His breathing slows and he bravely attempts to face reality by opening his eyes. John's face smiles back.
"I know John. I just thought you might think badly of me."
Jack’s shouts still ring in his ears, as Sherlock stares immobile at the spot where his son had been standing. A chill that has nothing to do with the temperature of Room seeps deep into his bones. A numbness floods him and he makes his way with difficulty over to Table. He sits on the edge, his feet dangling off the floor. The only noise is Chain jingling and clanking, a reminder of the truth that Sherlock has failed to make Sherlock understand. He listens for signs of life, but Jack is very quiet in Wardrobe.
“Your Stradivarius, yes.”
“Oh, I know you’ve never either,” laughs the man, “but from what I’ve heard, it’s like learning to ride a bicycle. You spend weeks with injuries from falling off and the rest of your life enjoying the ride. Now. Take. Off. Your. Clothes.”
“Fine. Healthy.”
he writes. Sherlock beams.
Then he looks at it.
The man straightens. "Doctor Watson. In spite of the fact that you have incapacitated my brother and held my fiancé at gunpoint, I have complete faith in you."
“Okay. You grab the eggs and I’ll get the oven ready. We need to do this right.”
Sherlock drifts.
"Missing anyone?" he asks "I've killed a lot of your brothers in arms. I don't remember a lot of them. I doubt I'll remember killing you either."
John sits up and smiles. "Don't tell anyone okay? Not until they're ready. It's not polite."
Until Jack asks for a present for his fifth birthday.
He gasps, reality filtering back in. Mycroft stares at him, alarmed. He remains where he was. John sits next to Sherlock. "Breathe. Remember what I started teaching you this morning, just breathe. you're fine, you're in Baker Street..."
"Sherlock, I'm so sorry. I understand you want to forget, but if we can get Them for murder, there won't even be a jury. We'll nail them before their lawyers can cover them."
John wonders how blind people dream. How Sherlock dreams. Can he imagine what his beloved streets of London look like? What does he look like to Sherlock? How can he possibly imagine…?
Sherlock strokes his face. “I’ll be alright.”
Next morning, Jack stares at the bruises on his neck and arms. “Clumsy Old Pa,” he says. They laugh.
John squares his shoulders. “Right. Now that I've been appointed your doctor, I'm going to make a change to a few things, starting with your antibiotics. You, Sherlock Holmes, are not going to lose your leg. Not on my watch.”
"THAT'S IT! JUST LIKE ANDERSON!"
"He doesn't like his brother very much." explains John, hoping the man will just forget he ever saw the one and only Consulting Detective behave this way. Then Sherlock manages to open the door and tumbles out of the cab, landing flat on his face with a loud squawk.
This isn't the first time Sherlock has tried to go. The first time he had been sixteen. The Witch had just told him he was going to be a father. She forces him to touch the baby bump, her eyes wide and insane. She lays on top of him, Her head on his chest like an enamoured lover, whispering about how the baby is going to look like him. When She leaves, he wraps the chain around his own neck. But he believes Mycroft will come. Mycroft will come and make it all go away. So he puts it down and waits. And waits.
“Brilliant,” Sherlock watches Jack with a look of pride on his face. They share a smile, “Let’s get learning.”
“NO!”
"How many times was she pregnant, Sherlock?"
"Please, Sherlock, hold on, for me, and- and- for Jack, I don't care if you hate me, please,
Let me know what you think!
“What choice did we have?” she snaps, but falls silent under her husband’s stern gaze.
Some of the tension leaves Sherlock's face. "What happened?" his gaze lingers on John's shoulder.
John nods and says nothing more. Stamford eventually leaves after Sherlock has taken his pills and the two of them sleep through the night, side by side on the couch. Jack and Mrs. Hudson find them wrapped around each other the next morning.
A pang of emotion shreds John’s heart. “I know Sherlock. I wish…”
Sherlock lets out a breath as he pulls out a blue scarf. Jack strokes it. “Thank you,” he whispers emotional. “Are you going to thank Mrs. Hudson for your present, Jack?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What happens if they don’t make it in time? When will I see you again?”
Mycroft's roar is what causes Sherlock to finally slump in his boyfriend's arms. John is left feeling very alone next to a picture of the Royal family.
“PA! Pa, look what I found! Flowers are real, Pa! PA!
“Your father and you have been locked…”
Hope I haven't just ruined your summer...
“It’s John Watson. I’m calling about your boyfriend. Get over here now before he starts a nuclear war.”
Alarm bells start to ring. Sherlock can feel his Mind Palace go into overdrive. “But I’ve never…”
“I have photos. And yesterday I went to the morgue and beat their corpses with a whip. Miss Hooper keeps them fresh for me, in exchange for her rent being paid for the next six months. Father joins in sometimes. He helped me dig them up after we buried them alive.”
Approaching John Watson, he pulls the man to one side. “Doctor, what can you tell me about my brother’s condition?”
He can just make out his brother’s reflection in the window where he stands behind him. The older Holmes speaks quietly. “Jack cut his hair because he wants you to know he is doing well. Your son is fine and coping as well as possible. He wanted you to have this, so that you stop worrying about him and focus solely on getting better.”
“Bring in the stretcher.”
"The ambulance is here, you need to let him go John, they need to work on him. You need to let him go."
"Nope."
The call Anthea made in the morgue pays off 12 hours later. With more calls from Mycroft, bribing, threats, forged signatures and more calls, Mycroft, his assistant and his parents find themselves in a clearing nearly two hundred miles from where Sherlock is, eighteen hours later. It doesn't take long for a van to drive up across the bumpy dirt path. The driver and his passenger, more of Mycroft's men, jump out and open the back doors. A few yards away, another man is operating a digger, rapidly making a deep hole in the ground. The engine switches off when the van doors open.
“Jack, please! PLEASE, Jack! I’ve taught you to deduce, to read people, to read me. So tell me, do I look like I’m lying?”
Mycroft fists his trousers and glares at the floor. No.
An image of Jack with a chain around his leg much like his own, burns itself into his mind and Sherlock can’t shake it loose. He can imagine their future in Room easily: Himself and Jack, chained up and starved, beaten regularly until the weakest dies. That would be him. He would give Jack all their food and take the brunt of all the beatings if it meant protecting Jack from physical or sexual abuse. But then what? Jack would be all alone and terrified. And Sherlock would have failed everything he’s worked so hard for. He would have failed Jack.
"I must say," says Mycroft, feeling his heart soar at the sheer power he has in his grasp. The power to save his brother. "I must say that I have come up with 457 different ways to kill you. Both. But then you made it easy." He leans into
Their trousers follow quickly and John sits up to rip away Sherlock’s underwear (Payback’s a bitch). He lays there in his naked glory, a small mole inside his left thigh, his cock long and elegantly curved. Without thinking, he bends down and licks a long path up it.
“I DON’T WANT TO! I don’t believe you!” They both stand, fists clenched as they try desperately to make the other see sense.
A man a few years older than him struggles to climb out of a car and hold Jack at the same time.
His breath hitches, his heart picks up. He’s more scared than he’s been since he was shot. His voice wobbles. “I meant it. Every word. If ever and whenever you’re ready.”
Sherlock left him on read and slipped on the pair of lacy black panties with a small bow in front. They were designed for men so that everything was held in for the most part. They were see-through and that always excited John. He loved seeing Sherlock through his underwear. John would usually make him cum in them because of how much he enjoyed seeing the pretty panties ruined by such a dirty deed. He pulled the socks up to his thighs. The socks were white with a black stripe across the top of them. Sherlock then looked at himself again in the mirror almost whimpering at the sight. He looked so ready to be fucked by John it wasn't even funny. His cock began to harden as he thought of John shoving him down and fucking his face. He absolutely adored when John made a mess of him. Sherlock tried his best to keep himself under control until John got home.
"Getting along without me, I see." He smirked and shook his head as he walked over to Sherlock who had already removed his fingers. "Such a greedy little slut you are. Couldn't even wait five minutes to be fucked." John stood behind Sherlock since he hadn't bothered to change his position. They were both naked now (other than Sherlock's socks). "Such a bad boy. You deserve a punishment." Sherlock whined at the words John had just spoken. Usually, a punishment meant that he was going to get the crop or have to walk on hands and knees for the rest of the night but this time, it was much different.
"Yes, sir." Sherlock said before heading to their room. The bed was neatly made, not a thing out of place. (Not for long) He thought that he would speed things along and lube himself up so that John didn't have to. So as he waited for John he grabbed the bottle of lube from the dresser and squirted a fair amount onto his fingers. He leaned against the bed, his feet still on the floor and spread his legs wide. Sherlock took his panties off and set them on the bed. He gently massaged his ass before pressing a finger into his hole. "Fuckin' hell." He groaned as he added another, moving them in and out at a steady pace. It wasn't long before John entered the room and closed the door behind him.
"Fuck-" Sherlock moaned as his hands stopped at his cock. John palmed his cock through the fabric and kissed Sherlock's neck.
The text was delivered and there was no reply for ten minutes. Sherlock huffed at his phone and bit his lip as he walked over to his closet. He closely inspecting his clothes before bending down to pick up an old shoebox full of his most precious items.
"John- Please! I need to cum." Sherlock kept begging but John didn't listen. He kept edging him until he was a whimpering mess. His curls stuck to his forehead, sweat pooled on his chest, his cheeks were dark red. His cock was aching, red, and pulsating. John's thrusts became weaker with every minute that went by. Assuming John was close to his orgasm, Sherlock let himself relax a little hoping that John would cum.
"On your knees," John spoke firmly but Sherlock was so wrapped up in kissing John that he didn't even hear the command. John grabbed Sherlock by his collar and made Sherlock look at him. "I said,
"I need you." Sherlock closed his eyes and pressed himself against John's body. He could feel Sherlock's erection through the fabric and he gave Sherlock a smirk.
He opened the box, picking up a lacy pair of panties and a pair of thigh-high socks. He set them on the bed and quickly closed the box putting it back in its place. He stripped of his clothes, leaving the pile beside the bed. He phone vibrated, it was a reply from John.
John had been out for most of the evening shopping for new clothes for both Sherlock and himself. He had gone to most of the shops in town except for one, which he was about to walk into. The clothes looked so fancy and chic but the prices were actually affordable for them both. Meanwhile, Sherlock was left at home. He had told John that he didn't feel like going out at the moment so he decided to stay home and wait for him to get back. Which- as it turns out; was a big mistake. Sherlock began to feel lonely (and not to mention horny.) He had slipped into subspace the moment he was going through this clothes to change into something for bed. He saw his black leather collar and instantly wanted John to be home. He changed his mind about changing for the moment being and put the collar around his neck carefully making sure it was secured properly. He took a deep breath and looked himself over in the mirror. Pleased with what he saw. The black collar in high contrast to his pale skin. He looked like pure sin. He was becoming impatient so he decided to send a text to John.
"Fuck- get on the floor. On your knees," John panted as he pulled out of Sherlock and stepped away from the bed, turning to the right. Sherlock got up, every movement hurt. His body was pushed to its sexual limit tonight. He had never been edged like this before. He sunk down to his knees and looked up at John through his lashes. John wanked himself off quickly above Sherlock. "You can touch yourself now, Baby" He groaned getting closer to his climax. "I want to cum on that handsome face of yours." John's was panting, sweat dripping from his face. Sherlock was so relieved to be able to touch himself finally.
"God yes- I love your cock, John. It's so fucking big. I love choking on it, Sir." Sherlock's head was spinning. He was so fucking horny that nothing else mattered but John and his cock. He loved serving John. It made him feel useful. "I love when you fuck me, Sir. It feels so good-" Sherlock continued to call him Sir because he knew that was John's secret weakness. He had deduced that a few months ago when they first started getting into the whole dom/sub thing. Sherlock took John's cock as far as it would go before he gagged around it. His throat muscles constricting around John. "I love being your little cockslut, Sir," Sherlock added, his eyes red and his chin completely soaked with spit.
"I hope this lesson teaches you not to do it again. You don't touch yourself unless I give you permission. Understood?" John said as helped Sherlock onto the bed and on his back.
"I love you too, John." Sherlock smiled.
"Make a mess of me, John." Sherlock spoke softly as John grabbed him by the back of the head and shoving his face against his clothed crotch. His erection was stiff and aching. Sherlock groaned against his crotch, his cheek pressed against John's cock. He was at John's whim and he couldn't be happier about it. He loved being bossed around by him. He loved not being in control in these moments. It was a release of stress for Sherlock and John both. John unbuttoned his pants and let them pool around his ankles, then shoved Sherlock's face back to his (still) clothed cock.
“Mick’s innocent,” James asserted. “You know it and Mr. Holmes knows it. Mick says the Guv – that’s what he calls Mr. Sherlock – will set them free. Mick says he’s solved many crimes and always gets the true criminal.”
The weeks went by and I heard nothing from Holmes. I wrote to him expecting no answer, which was what I received. Still, I used the letters as a confessional of sorts, pouring out my experiences at the clinic, my fears and hopes, and also my loneliness. I had anticipated many things after my release, but not the intensity of my solitude, which was one reason I spent so much time at work. But when I did return to my cheerless room, I was acutely aware of how alone I was in that vast city. I remembered the solace of the drugs, which had numbed my senses and put me into a languorous daze, but I found, to my relief, that the physical craving was gone. And I had no desire to go back.
“We’d like to see Mr. Wiggins now.”
“The French are tolerant in that way,” I returned.
“That is my domain,” said Holmes. “Never fear, Watson! I will get to the bottom of it.”
Charles shrank from Holmes and turned to me in dismay. “I was in love, Doctor! I poured out my soul in them! I wrote that I didn’t care that Dilly was... what she was. And I wrote her poetry, too.” He looked up at Holmes, tearfully. “It was quite good poetry, if I do say so myself.”
“I think you’ll survive,” I replied. “Now we must get the cat into the box. Perhaps if we wrap her up first? Otherwise she’ll claw the deuce out of the both of us.”
When I arose I found it was still early. I knew Holmes would be at breakfast, perhaps perusing the morning papers for news of the capture of two suspected murderers in a low lodging house in Soho.
Holmes and I stood, gaping, at the sight of Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard and one of his lackeys, Constable Clark, standing next to a bloody figure lying supine on the filthy floor.
Little did Holmes suspect how close to the truth was his conjecture.
And Gladstone, hearing his name, wagged his tail happily.
“What?” I felt myself being shaken awake. “I say! Is something the matter?”
“We were just leaving, Major,” said Holmes. “Come, Watson. I think we have what we need.” And he sauntered out of the room.
“Good Lord, Watson,” Holmes said afterwards. “I’m strangely fatigued.”
Yes, I thought, once the Irishman and I have left England, it will be safe for him to come home. He will be safe in all of London, all of England.
“Thank you, sir,” he said, his voice dry and faded. “You are ever so kind. But I feel so poorly.”
There it was.
“Doctor?” James said gently. “Do you want any breakfast? Mrs. Hudson has a rasher of bacon cooked up, if you please.
I went back to my room. Holmes was already in bed, pretending to be asleep.
I heard the report of the pistol. Felt the shock of the bullet’s impact. And a burning pain.
“Don’t say that!” Mick cried. “You and me have been together since we was pups. I’ve always looked after you and I’ll keep looking after you. I swear I will!” Mick turned and saw Holmes and I standing there. “Here’s Dr. Watson! He’ll make you better! I know he will!”
I stared at it – and my heart stopped.
And, in fact, I was being honest, being truthful, when I begged off Stamford’s party. Holmes was ill. Acutely ill. Gravely ill.
“And you test my patience,” Holmes said through gritted teeth. “Here comes the lad. Let us go and find a cab. The night is yet young and our next stop is Cleveland Street.”
“Yes, I’m ready.” I stood while the Russian drenched me with cool water and then energetically washed me with his soap and brushes. As usual, I felt quite invigorated by his treatment. Then I lay prone upon the slab, a rolled towel under my chin, as Ivan worked his sorcery on my shoulders, back, and legs. He knew me well and was careful of my left shoulder; although my wound had long since healed, he knew I was still mindful of it and sensitive to any touch.
“Don’t forget, Doctor,” said Mick, tugging at my sleeve. “My cat, Moggy. You promised you’d look after her.”
“He’s trying to be of use,” I said.
“Quite,” Holmes sniffed. “Which brings me to the proposition I mentioned earlier this morning before our... encounter. I’ve taken a flat and I find there are two bedrooms. I believe it would be beneficial if I had a roommate of good character and stable habits to share it with me and help me with the rent.”
Love. That is what I, in my pathetically romantic way, coveted. Hungered for. Love.
“Nonsense, Watson!” he replied, taking off his ulster and handing it to a young footman. “What are they here for if not to make us comfortable? Mycroft retains this dismal domain year after year mainly to keep these people in gainful employment. Lord knows he hates the country and so-called country pleasures, so he has little other use for it. I imagine our coming is the most exciting thing that has happened at Sherringford since the floor of the turret room collapsed back in ’76. Isn’t that right, Lovell?”
The man nodded. “We might have something in that line upstairs. But it’ll cost you. Five bob each for the show. If you make an arrangement afterwards, it’s your own affair.”
But James sprang to his feet. “I’ll do it, Doctor! Let me get some hot water and I’ll fix you up right as rain.”
“Me?” That was a surprise. “Thinking that you should call me to bind up your wound? Then why didn’t you summon me earlier?”
Of course, the bubbly went directly to my head. It always does.
“No buts, John. No regrets. ‘If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended, That you have but slumber’d here, While these visions did appear, And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding than a dream.’”
“No,” I swallowed. But I was. Afraid and thrilled.
Chapter 5
“Really, Watson, I’ve rarely known you to be so out of temper,” said Holmes, rapping on the front of the carriage. The coachman opened the slot. “We will need a few moments of respite, Webb. If you would be so good as to pull to the side of the road?”
But my romantic situation became extremely sticky as we three – the attaché remaining in Alexandria to finish his business – arrived and then tarried on the Rock. But the weather in summer on the Spanish coast was beastly, the heat the most oppressive I had ever experienced. I found myself longing for cooler climes even as I also found many reasons to work up a sweat with the wife. But I needed to seek a safer situation, since the attaché would very soon be joining our ménage.
“Holmes,” I hissed. “I think we had better leave this place!”
“Hopkins?”
“Obviously,” I said shortly. My face burned, as if he knew. As if he could tell where I had been and what I had been doing. And, being Sherlock Holmes, he did. He knew all. Knew at a single glance.
“Holmes... I....” I set down my paper. “If you would put aside these drugs, perhaps visit your brother’s estate in the country. Or even take a trip. To Italy. Or Germany.”
“I don’t know, Doctor. Mr. Sherlock suddenly took against his tutor. They must have had a falling out over some little thing or other. You know how boys are – they take things to heart. Mr. Sherlock refused to study mathematics anymore. He told the old Earl that if he couldn’t be the best, then he’d rather be nothing. That put the Earl into a fury! Then the lad said he wouldn’t be in the same house with his tutor and demanded he be sent away. The poor man needed the money, I think, which was why he was teaching the boy in the first place. Scholars are not rich gentlemen as rule, are they, Doctor?”
“Are you -” he cleared his throat “Are you serious?” He sounded utterly perplexed. Another very unlike Sherlock Holmes thing. John’s face scrunched up.
John went into panic mode. The silence stretched. He was still sitting on Sherlock, who was as pale as the snow he was lying on. And not saying anything. At all. Just staring.
“Going to the park”
Reluctantly John pulled back once more as he noticed a certain lower region reacting to the situation. Best not take things too far too soon. He wasn’t all that experienced himself and he knew for a fact that Sherlock wasn’t so he didn’t wanna rush anything. There was no need, was there? Apparently Sherlock wanted this. Wanted him? How was this even possible? It seemed to good to be true.
“M'not. It’s just- just look at him.”
“You want this?” He couldn’t help but ask. To be sure. To know.
“While the human senses generally aren’t the most reliable source of information I think it is safe to say that by using them and the ability to logically analyse things we can safely deduce that the situation at hand is indeed happening and real, so you needn’t worry that-”
He hadn’t been sure if the fact that Sherlock actually bothered to look up from his book and give him an intense stare was a good or bad thing.
“I’m saying that-” he stopped frowning.
“That’s not what I meant” he sounded a bit frustrated but John couldn’t bring himself to care at that moment. There was so much pent up frustration in him too, so much suppressed desire and want. And now he was here, sitting on the stomach of his best friend, anger surging up in him because god he was so stupid, such a fool for wanting something Sherlock was obviously not ready to offer. Hell, he didn’t even want him on his cases so how did he ever think he could possibly want him as…more.
“Perfect” he couldn’t resist leaning down for another kiss (a chaste and soft one this time) then, albeit a bit regretfully, he got off of Sherlock, stood up and offered his hand to him.
His anger from before was nothing compared to this. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.
“All these people just standing around, talking about nonsense, wasting their time and more importantly mine.”
The excited blabber of younger students almost drowned out Mike Stamford’s voice.
“What if something went wrong?” Sherlock had turned serious.
“Oh come on Sherlock, you must’ve some nice memories of snow. Building a snowman, having snowball fights, making snow angels… Kids love that stuff” John remembered his own childhood. It wasn’t always bright and good even back then, but it was better. They’d go to the park, him and Harry packed in big snowsuits, scarf around their neck, giant beanie on their head. One time they even managed to build something like an igloo. It was only big enough to fit a squirrel, yeah but they’d build it, their father helping with the tricky parts, their mom taking a picture of their proud grinning faces. He swallowed. Things were different now. But snow was still snow wasn’t it?
“You can’t even beat me at a snow fight” he snapped getting a bit angry “and you think you can make it on the battlefield but I can’t?”
“As you are the medical professional, might I ask what your suggestions are?”
The mere mention of his military career had John standing and drawing himself to full height, mainly out of nervousness and self-defense.
He clasps one of Their legs and gets a kick in the stomach. He curls onto his side, groaning.
“WILLIAM!” he screams. “WILLIAM!”
He smiles. He’s done his part. The rest is up to Jack.
“As real as John and uncle Mycroft. And Mrs. Hudson of course.”
John quirks an eyebrow. "What makes you say that?" he cocks his head.
Sherlock sighs. "Yes, John, please don't be an idiot, you know Mycroft is the British government." He reaches past a flabbergasted John and fumbles with the handle. "Pay the driver, John, and do hurry up. Don't make me climb over you."
Then Sherlock's body slowly slides until his head disappears underwater and reality hits. Mycroft can hear himself screaming for help, for an ambulance, for John, anything. He runs forward and plunges his arms into cold, bloody water and brings Sherlock back to the surface. He wraps his arms around Sherlock's torso, cradles his head in his hands.
John blinks. "Afghanistan, sir." He frowns. Prince Charles flickers briefly to reveal a younger man before returning.
They hold hands all the way back to Baker street and the cabbie’s driving is as bad as Hope’s. John always remembers their first case fondly, but right now all he can think about is Sherlock’s rapid breathing and the way his eyes are shining as they stare dead ahead of him. He’s beautiful in the light of the street lamps and John falls in love with him all over again. Sherlock turns his head towards him and his eyes rest on John’s chest. He cups Sherlock’s chin and raises his face until their eyes almost meet. He’s made Sherlock feel, but now he almost wishes he could make Sherlock see him. He recalls how Sherlock touched his face the first time they met, his fingers tracing the stubble on John’s cheeks and he realises that perhaps Sherlock has already seen him.
Mycroft knocks at the bathroom door. "Sherlock, everything okay in there? I do apologise if what I said at the funeral hurt you, but I only have your best interests in mind brother, and..." He pushes the door open.
“Will you live with me and uncle Mycroft?”
John snorts, still trying to keep his voice low. “So what, you’re just going to choose everything for him from now on? Decide who treats him, who he sees, what time and when he’s allowed out? That’s almost as bad as what those monsters did to him! Locking him up for his own safety?”
"Sherlock?" John's voice called from the front door. He set down the bags from shopping onto the couch and waited for a response. Sherlock slowly made his way around the corner without saying a word. John looked him over and raised an eyebrow at the sight before him. "Why are you wearing your robe?" John asked stepping closer to Sherlock. They made eye contact and John made sure to hold it for a few seconds. He knew Sherlock would give in sooner or later. "Sherlock... What's with the robe?" He asked again, this time receiving a physical response instead of a verbal one. Sherlock untied the knot in the front and showed only his neck, where the collar was.
"What's got you so worked up? You like when I touch you like this?" John's voice became deeper, more dominant. Sherlock moaned a quiet "
as John squeezed his cock through the fabric. Their height difference made it perfect for John to worship Sherlock's body in this position. He kissed his collarbones, his chest, his stomach. "Look at you, Sherlock. So perfect." John cooed at him. The words made him melt into John's touch.
"Fuck, Sherlock-" John moaned, running his fingers through Sherlock's curls. He held them out of his face to get a better look at him. "Look at you," he said as he pulled on Sherlock's hair, forcing him to look up at him. Spit dripped from his chin, his eyes were watering, and his cheeks were bright red. "You're such a cock slut, aren't you? You just adore sucking my cock and making a goddamn mess of yourself." John then let his hair go, leaving Sherlock to continue but he waited. He held John's cock in his hand and stroked him quicker than before.
"You were so good for me, Sherlock. I love you." He said kissing his cheek. Sherlock was so drained that he could barely reply. John knew that what they both needed was a shower and a good night's rest.
"You look so fucking good like this, all spread out for me. So pretty, Sherlock with your collar on too," John kept praising him. He held onto Sherlock's hips as he thrusted harshly into him. Sherlock let out a cry, a mix of pain and pleasure. "Keep it down, you want someone to hear?" John said as he kept the hard and steady pace going. Sherlock whined, his cock dripping pre-cum onto his own stomach. The tip was swollen and red, begging for contact. John reached down and stroked Sherlock's dick until his hips bucked forward. He let go and smirked. "This is your punishment. You're not allowed to cum until I do." He grunted through grit teeth as he pounded into Sherlock.
“Is it about Room? Does Detective Lestrade have more information?”
Sherlock tenses, his hands curled into tight fists. His mother nods. “We’ll find a home for the boy, somewhere out of the public eye. We don’t want any embarrassment and the quicker he goes, the faster you’ll heal.”
“Let’s put it this way. What do people put in vaults? Secrets. And where do people hide their deepest, darkest vault full of secrets? In the recesses of their minds. That’s where we are. We’re in Old Magnussen’s Mind Palace. That’s what he calls this place, to taunt me. We need to prepare ourselves. We need to get out of here.”
Sherlock's eyes roll in his head as he fights unconsciousness.
“Why don’t you have a seat?” says Sherlock, trying to sound polite.
They haven't ventured out again, the media still trying to snap a photo by any means necessary. It's been two weeks now since they arrived at Baker Street, but John cannot help but feel like he's waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“Ticklish, are we?” Asks John, cheekily.
Running his hands down Sherlock’s neck, then his chest, enjoying the silken texture of Sherlock’s favourite purple shirt. Leaning in and smelling his cucumber shampoo, ash, sweat and something so uniquely Sherlock that he’s addicted instantly. He swipes out his tongue and licks a path along Sherlock’s neck before sucking on his Adam’s apple. Sherlock’s breath is hot on his forehead and John loves that he can so easily pull apart the smartest man in London. That he’s the only one who can do this. Sherlock grasps his elbows to steady himself.
“What? How...”
He screams and calls Her every foul and filthy word he can think of. He hopes to enrage her enough that she’ll beat him to death. She does beat him, but Magnussen makes sure to avoid giving Sherlock the sweet release of death.
Stammering, only the man’s name can leave his throat. “
Throwing open cupboards, he tries to think of something when he sees Jack's cereals and pulls them out, grabbing the bowl of fruit off the counter and turns back to the table. And nearly has a heart attack when he realizes that he, the former soldier, has been snuck up on by a child.
“Are you sure?”
His suspicions were confirmed, when the man in question picked up a box containing syringes and brushed his fingers over the braille for confirmation.
She charges at him before he’s had the chance to realise she’s moved. Her comrade isn’t far behind her and They wrestle him onto his stomach. He fights back just enough to hold their attention, yet not enough for Them to threaten Jack. He has to get the balance right. He has to keep Them occupied.
Sherlock stares at him sadly. “I have to, Jack. Let’s just say Chain knows if I haven’t and he’ll get tighter. But that’s not the problem.”
Something warm tries to fill Sherlock's lungs. Sherlock floats.
I gasp. “That’s me?”
Hearing it makes it seem less real. “Are you sure? You… you’re certain? They… they weren’t ever going to just vanish… you can’t be sure…”
He looks up at me and stops typing. “No, it just gave me something to think about. However, the person we were talking about is on the move. I will have to go to my office. I don’t want any activity to be traced back here.”
"She raped my baby." hisses his mother. "She drugged him and forced herself..."
“Your son is outside waiting for you. The paramedics are coming. I’m right here, okay? We’ve just got to get rid of the chain and then we can get you out of here. Squeeze my hand if you understand.”
Lestrade sighs, but maintains eye contact with the younger. "I said there was one grave. Two bodies."
“We’re going to pull the curtain in case your son wakes up. John will be right there with him, is that ok?”
He doesn’t remember taking his clothes off. He’s suddenly on his back on Bed. He grunts in surprise as someone flips him over, his face pressed against the pillow. He forgets his promise and panics.
"This is where your brother lives?" astounded, he turns to Sherlock in need of confirmation.
Rapping at the door. "Sherlock, everything okay in thereI do apologize if what I said at the funeral hurt you..."
“Jack! Wow, you look so different!” John picks up the small boy and hugs him tight. “Oh you look amazing! I’m so proud! Did Mrs. Hudson cut it for you?”
Mycroft nods. “Yes. I lashed out. My emotions got the better of me. I blamed myself for you being here, I missed Gregory terribly, I didn’t know how to talk to Jack and I ended up hunting down a petty criminal and riddling him with so many bullets I’m sure they had to use tweezers to put him in the body bag. My emotions got the better of me, and I hurt one of my nephew’s favourite people. I have failed the few people I can truly consider to be family.”
She eyes him critically and he remembers that she had Sherlock get her husband executed. "Well, dear, it's not polite to wake up the neighbourhood like that. Now, what did you do to yourself?" She potters over and tuts. "Now sit down and I'll make tea. Just this once mind. Not your housekeeper."
John shakes. He doesn’t want to hang up just yet.
She gasps and holds me tight. Her voice is wet. “I love you too, Jack.”
After a terrible night’s sleep, John is making tea. Sherlock finally ventures out of his room at the sound of John stirring milk into the beverage. He pads into the kitchen and turns his head towards John’s general direction.
For five days after the interview, Mycroft takes more hours off work and watches his brother like a hawk. He doesn't like what he sees.
Everything goes blurry. The chair disappears from underneath him. Strong arms wrap around him.
All of Sherlock’s thoughts come crashing to a halt. “I’m sorry?” he stammers, eyes flicking from one to the other. They sigh.
Sherlock pales considerably. “Don’t you ever ask me that again.” He grits out, infuriated.
"Pa! I'm a pirate!"
An office. A desk. Wailing. "Mycroft fucked you." blurts John and he feels relief at the words.
The older man smirks. “No, but thank you for saying it.” And They turn to leave. Sherlock is after Them like a hare. He grabs the Witch’s sleeve and receives a punch to the jaw for his efforts. “Please, PLEASE! I’ll do whatever you want, you can do whatever you want with me, anything, I don’t care anymore, I’m begging you,
It takes him a moment to remember the conversation. “Your brother has been distant. Not aware of his surroundings. Distracted.”
"That's not what you said last night."
"Okay?" John doesn't want to have to ask what he has to do with plan.
The eyes disappear and John stares at the top of Jack's head, waiting. Then the eyes reappear, assessing him. Then a small hand places a large silver object on the table before retreating and Jack runs to hide behing the sliding doors. He peers at John, eyes both curious and excited.
“Yes, because you’ll be in my head.”
Sherlock picks up his hand and links their fingers, his eyes set on the ceiling. “I saw you,” he replies, “and the stars.” He rolls towards John and buries his face in his neck.
John grimaced. "That won't be easy. We barely pulled it off last time."
“Yep!”
“Hello Uncle Mycroft,” I say, hoping to see him stop. But he just hums and nods his head at me without even looking.
He almost misses the six beeps and then the door opens. They stop in Their tracks as They take in the scene in front of Them.
"I can give them both a proper burial. A place where they can rest peacefully. Tell me when you know where you want them buried." He leaves.
Two small headstones next to each other and two caskets being lowered into the ground.
I don’t know what that means. He tries to explain. “He’s staying away from us for a while.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shut your mouth, if you know what’s good for you. I swear that if you’re lying…”
“Yes!”
"Should I?" his voice is hard; there will be no kindness from him today.
“I heard what you said, John. To me. Before the ambulance took me away.”
Jack breaks Mycroft and wonders about his family.
Sherlock seemingly ignores this and makes his way over to his chair before plopping down unceremoniously. John recovers and brings his cup over to him. As usual, Sherlock reaches out with both hands so that he can cradle the mug. Not as usual, John grasps Sherlock’s right hand in his left and guides it to the handle of the mug and allows his fingers to linger on Sherlock’s wrist before pulling away, trying not to express any emotion that Sherlock might hear, leaving the poor man to blink his blind eyes owlishly at John’s armchair. John snickers inwardly at Sherlock’s reaction and waits to see what happens. The smile that graces Sherlock’s lips only lasts a second before the man regains control of himself. John mentally punches the air and goes back to his newspaper in the hopes that Sherlock doesn’t realise he was staring. Brilliant. Ten points to Gryffindor. Everything is going smoothly.
Sherlock and Jack have to face the consequences of their demands.
Eight months after the birth, Sherlock is cleaning the floor. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the child crawling across the floor, heading for the bed. He ignores it and continues his chores until he hears the baby make happy sounds, a noise Sherlock isn’t used to hearing from this child. He spins around.
"You two need something?" enquires Lestrade with a hiss, shifting his hips a little. Mycroft, desperately trying to hold himself still, gasps and closes his eyes.
Mycroft blinks. "Anthea?"
In the end, Jack simply picks out the same meal for Sherlock. Jack carries his own plate back, beaming with pride and seemingly no longer noticing the crowds of people who have finally lost interest and gone back to their own lives. “Look Pa! We brought you a meal.”
Sherlock shakes his right arm loose and succeeds in elbowing her in the stomach. “Jack!” he screams, “Monsters! MONSTERS!”
It’s not as short as Pa’s. Just a little wavy and I can tuck some bits behind my ears. I am surprised by how different I look. I think I look more grown up and important, like uncle Mycroft. Except I have more hair than him.
The insurgent Lestrade splutters. "Fiancé? What the actual fuck, Myc?"
“But, Pa, I don’t want to,” says Jack, fidgeting.
They sit in silence for a long time. "I want them to pay." His mother hisses. Sigar grips her hand.
The man greeted them with a deep baritone voice. “Mike.”
As I walk into the living room and I find uncle Mycroft sat in Pa’s chair. He has his ‘laptop’ on his knees and he is frowning his War Face at the screen.
“Yes.”
"I know." Sherlock licks his lips, wondering how to explain his dilemma and not upset Mycroft. "It's just the suit."
“Watch out, everyone, Freak’s petting the guide dog!”
He towers over the child, fists clenched. The baby screams again and suddenly reality slaps Sherlock in the face.
"John, I know this is all very confusing for you, but I need you to check Sherlock's vitals." The world trembles. John doesn't flinch.
“Jack,” he gasps, “oh, Jack, I love you, I love you so much, I’m so proud of you.” He runs towards him and there’s no chain on his leg. Jack meets him halfway and they embrace. Then they look at his freed leg.
"Never! I will beat you mister government!" And he throws himself at his uncle. Mycroft lunges.
Mycroft grips his shoulders. "Say it."
. What has the world come to?”
“Outside.” Says Sherlock. “I want to get some fresh air.”
Jack asks for the impossible, but Sherlock provides anyway.
“Sherlock, you’ve never known what love is, even when we showered you with it, you can’t say things like that, especially about some monster’s spawn…”
Mycroft says nothing and Sherlock soon understands that he is expected to get himself back under control and quickly. He takes a deep breath and leans away from him, mumbling “sorry” under his breath. Mycroft clears his throat and pulls back the top of Sherlock’s gown to get a better look at his injuries. Sherlock tries not to flinch. Then he remembers.
John doesn't think. He grabs the rock at his side and hurls it at his opponents face.As it hits, John leaps forward and slams his palms on either side of his face and cuts off the other man's cries with a sharp punch to the throat. Silent, his enemy crumples and John whips out his gun, aiming it at the next closest man, freezing him in his tracks.
“Like Pa? Is he sick too?”
“He is. Forgive me, I am simply distracted. It’s almost three o’clock, if you want to call Sherlock, now would be the best time to do it. Do you have the number?”
Oh god,
Jack frowns harder, frustrated. "Making circles with his thumbs and tapping fingers like for a dog." he blurts and sits back on his heels, daring him to argue with his 'deductions'
John struggles to reach his own pocket with Sherlock climbing all over his lap and eventually manages to obtain his wallet. Looking at the cabbie, the man is watching Sherlock with a look of high amusement on his face and smirks at John when they make eye contact. John flushes.
Mycroft stands and picks up his umbrella before returning to kneel in front of his little brother. "Oh, Brother mine. I would walk around Bucking Palace in a sheet for you." A pause. "Get your mind out of the gutter, Gregory." The man runs out of the room, giving John a small wave.
John glanced at the phone nervously. “Can't believe I sent a text to a serial killer.”
“I told him to park the pick-up in the driveway, while he’s clearing the garden for the next week. I kept the keys.”
He pauses, the idea of a bit of pain and excitement thrilling him. Just to remind him he's alive. But alive hurts, it hurts so much, and his head swivels until he's staring at the bath.
Three others glance up and John freezes, his heart pounding. The remaining three lead his men away. No, please no.
Mycroft whips out his clean handkerchief and wipes his brother's face. "Brother mine, I'm so sorry. I cannot begin to imagine what you went through. You're safe. You'll always be safe now. They'll never get out, no matter what happens, I swear. They'll have to fight me before they get even within a continent to you."
"And that I must engage in combat with any pirate I encounter?"
Jack reflects on the differences between himself and his Pa and his growing desire to learn.
Mycroft tilts his head to one side. "It doesn't really matter. I've spent five weeks imagining what I could do to them, but now I know it doesn't matter. Why should it? I have my brother back. I'm the British Government; I'm constantly at war. But I didn't need that in my own family. Seeing my brother at peace will be all I need from this awful period of my life."
Sherlock pulled on his coat, picked up the riding crop lying on the table. “Thank you for getting this Molly.” he said, speaking to the only woman in the room. “Are you coming John?”
“Don’t think I haven’t been watching you. You could jeopardize his recovery.”
“Truck. Wriggle out. Jump. Deduce. Somebody. You need to remember those five things, Jack. They will help you escape. The Witch mentioned the other night that Their gardener was leaving his pick-up here and They have the keys. They won’t bury you on the Appledore grounds, because Their gardener will be suspicious. They can’t put you in the back of Their car, because again, suspicions. So that leaves the pick-up which They will use to drive somewhere far away enough to avoid curious people. We’re on the outskirts of London, which means They will pass housing estates and neighbours. So once you’re in the truck, you will do the second thing: Wriggle out of Rug. Then you will jump when the truck slows down and get away quickly. As you go, you’re going to have to deduce the people you see make sure they are clever and safe enough to save you. You’ve had a lot of practice with the people on TV so don’t you worry. And that’s when you do the final thing: Somebody. Pick a real person and stay with them. Tell them you need the police. You have to tell them everything, okay?
At their first meeting, John politely informed the British Government to sod off. Three weeks ago, after his and Sherlock's first time together, Mycroft had glanced at the pair of them, smirked and had marched away cursing the apparent benefits of
and all I could think was that I hadn’t
Sherlock stares horrified as he pulls off his belt. “But you’ve never…”
John, still stuck to the fridge he’d backed up against and remembering Mycroft’s threats, looks dismayed. “I’m your friend, Sherlock. This is not how friends thank each other. This is a bit not good.”
I climb off the stool and hug her leg. “Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.”
John wonders how Sherlock can possibly be thinking about experiments at a time like this, but then he decides that, hey this is Sherlock, he’ll just have to learn to live with the quirks in and out of the bedroom.
(See the end of the chapter for
The doctor leaps back. “Whoa! Sherlock, what are you doing?”
"Let me through, please, he's my friend."
“Body is three feet in front of you,” he says, “Feet at nine o’clock, body twisted so that head is at two o’clock. Here,” he runs his fingers across Sherlock’s palm, “is the victim, knife about a foot away, here at eleven o’clock. Serrated blade, black handle, plastic, something you’d find in a hardware store.” He pauses to glance over at the police car. “Two witnesses, can’t see much from here. Where do you want to start?”
Sherlock is still struggling to breathe as he does as he is told. He listens to the usual six beeps and the door opens and closes. For the first time in five years, he’s alone. Fear takes possession of every limb and he runs as close as he can to the door and presses his palms against it. He gasps for breath for several minutes until he can calm down. Then he walks back over to Bed and pulls out Soft Ball that had rolled out of Rug, the same one that he’s used to fake a lack of pulse in Jack’s arm.
He licks his lips, still thinking. “Well…”
The man with the evil umbrella arrives.
I sit on her armchair whilst she makes it for me. I open up my book and look for the photos of children I want to show her. I stop on a page about families. There’s a picture of a child with a mum and dad and grandparents. It’s what lots families look like. Lots of pieces to make a puzzle. But I don’t have a mum. And my grandparents don’t love me. What happens when you have missing pieces and other pieces that don’t love you?
. Pretending is beneath Mycroft, so Sherlock knows the pain he sees is real.
He looks at no one as they’re bundled into the car. The soldier gets in with them. Without a word, he puts Sherlock’s foot on his lap and the paramedics pass him some bandages and then they’re gone. Sherlock is vaguely aware that he may be going into shock.
The sound of a sheet of paper sliding across the table makes him want to run away. Beside him, John tenses and grits his teeth.
John's hand trembles. Prince Charles has chickened out and abandonned him. The world swirls; the man before him raises both hands as if to tame a ferociuos predator. He suddenly has grey hair and kind eyes. Then it disappears again.
"John."
John is pretty sure he never actually woke up this morning. He wanders over to Lestrade and notices how he has the same expression on his face.
Instead he chokes out, “Are you real?”
"I'm in our flat with you. I was asleep."
John recalls standing behind a hospital bed, watching a small boy sleep and Sherlock sat in front of a mirror with his back to him. His full nudity revealed horrific injuries and abuse and John had wanted him to know he's not alone. "Would you like to see?"
“I thought he… tolerated me. More than my parents at least.”
“No, no, he’ll be back, he just needs a couple of weeks to collect himself.”
Sherlock can hear his own blood rushing. Mycroft looks outraged. That keeps Sherlock grounded. “Jack is my son. He’s my responsibility and he’s staying with me.”
"If anyone finds out about this, I will have to go on the run."
Jack pouts, “I want another story.”
I don't let go.
John struggles to reach his own pocket with Sherlock climbing all over his lap and eventually manages to obtain his wallet. Looking at the cabbie, the man is watching Sherlock with a look of high amusement on his face and smirks at John when they make eye contact. John flushes.
“Never mind. Tell the police about Room, okay? And Chain, you must mention Chain and Old Magnussen. But the most important thing is Appledore, do you understand? Because the police can’t find me unless you tell them where to find Room. So you must tell them that Room is in Appledore. It’s absolutely imperative, Jack.”
“Sherlock.”
He doesn't realise he never locked the door.
“John? Do you think I can make my own decisions?”
"Sherlock? No, please, Sherlock, I'm sorry... oh God, please, little brother, Sherlock, breathe, breathe for me, please. SHERLOCK? SHERLOCK! Please don't do this to me! PLEASE! SHERLOCK!"
Mycroft opens his mouth, but his mother cuts him off. "I'm a good cook. I'm an excellent mathematician. But I am a terrible mother. When you called to tell me Sherlock had been found, I thought everything could go back to normal. But when you said there was a child... and signs of sexual abuse, I panicked. I should have been there to hold my child when he cried and welcome my grandson, but instead, your father and I convinced ourselves that Sherlock would be the same; the same arrogant teenager, always doing his own thing. When he was missing we never imagined a scenario like this, so we kept up the pretence. We thought he'd never want to keep a child, because
“You said you wanted to be a pirate,” interrupts Jack.
Afghanistan flickers to London and back.
“Don’t be ridiculous. How can we possibly explain his presence to everyone?”
The younger Holmes is pale, eyes red and dazed, big bags under them from lack of sleep. His appearance is akin to having been in a fight and lost.
John walks into the kitchen and places his hands on his hips. He knows he must look like a twat to any sane person and refrains from laughing at himself and giving up the game. "Now where did I see that yummy?"
Sherlock pondered the case and John pouted. It was a few minutes before the detective spoke up again. “Yes.”
"He doesn't like his brother very much." explains John, hoping the man will just forget he ever saw the one and only Consulting Detective behave this way. Then Sherlock manages to open the door and tumbles out of the cab, landing flat on his face with a loud squawk.
"Petting?" sweaks John, not entirely sure he wants to know.
“What? Of course not, it was me, all me.” John discovered that Sherlock isn't a brilliant liar. Especially when it concerns his ego. So he smiled to himself, satisfied and glad no one could see it.
“You made the right choice,” says his father. “A child created that way doesn’t deserve the traditional family name.”
John, still wiping tears away is unable to answer, so he just nods. Mycroft gets up.
Mycroft sighs patiently. “No, Sherlock, this is somewhat a surprise. She heard about you on the news and contacted us immediately.” He walks to the door and opens it. “Surely you remember Mrs. Hudson.”
didn't want to replace her first daughter."
“YOU’RE A MONSTER! YOU’RE JUST LIKE THEM! YOU’RE THE REASON PA’S NOT SAFE IN THE REAL WORLD!”
John remembers that first day when he met Sherlock. It took less than six hours for the man to tip his life upside down. For the better he might add. Then with ringing phones and swivelling cameras, he'd met Anthea, and then Mycroft in the warehouse. The man hadn't needed much encouragement to look smug and stare down his nose at Captain Watson. He knew that Mycroft cared about his little brother, put up with his antics and happily participated in all of the staring matches they often got into. Sherlock never saw the despair etched on the elder Holmes' face during those; Mycroft would end him if Sherlock ever found out that his brother had trouble looking into his sightless eyes.
"I can't stop this." he tells Charles. Mycroft.
“I love you. I’m doing this for you.”
“I mean” Sherlock struggled with his words “If you want to kiss me and…and I-I want to-to kiss you…then friendship isn’t the appropriate type of relationship for us, is it?”
“You asked for it” touche he thought idly. And that’s when their battle began in earnest. He picked up two more hands full of snow, forming them into perfect balls. Sherlock was already backing away, seeking shelter behind a tree. Giddiness bubbled up in his chest. He’d actually gotten Sherlock to do this with him.
