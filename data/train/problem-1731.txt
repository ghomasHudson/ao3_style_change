Sherlock grasped him by his shoulders and gave him one, hard shake.
John choked a bit, swallowing his own sticky, thick saliva before answering the man, “Um, no. No I haven’t.” His voice sounded weak and uneasy to his own ears - surely the man would notice as well?
He watched as the circular loading icon swung round a few times, and then a black and white audio/video feed of the morgue filled the screen, skewed ever just so by the angle of the camera. He ran his finger along the touchpad, moving the slider bar backwards, rewinding the recording until he saw his own tall figure leave through the double doors. Then he allowed the feed to play.
All three boys formed a line in front of John now, Ed moving forward with every step John took back.
Her wide, velveteen eyes looked quite serious, but the twist of her lips held more than little bit of mirth.
to be going on. He was having trouble sleeping, feeling hot and then cold, emotions going haywire, low grade fever…
He dismissed their hissing whispers for now, focusing on every reflection of the puddles and every twist and crack of the pavement surface, knowing each clue would take him closer to figuring out what the hell had happened here.
“No,” the Omega clutched the small parcel at his side, a clean change of clothes, and “I’ll just wait for him, if you don’t mind.”
“So, you’re saying that they’re harvesting these organs to create this recombinant DNA? I agree that that is not standard practice for Formation, but this
Throughout all this John actually said nothing, only wiping his face whilst his tears faded to blood-shot eyes and pathetic hiccups.
John gazed upwards at the man as if spellbound. He took in the taller man’s visage, every errant curl, every gleam of his mercurial eyes, saving each and every visual memory like a Polaroid one could easily place in their back pocket for safekeeping. He did this because he didn’t want to lose this moment, although he knew, even as he wished desperately for the opposite, that it could not last.
Sherlock grunted and moved past Mycroft, opening the door to the landing as an outright invitation to
John closed the cabinet door as quickly and quietly as possible, taking his seat as he heard the tell-tale jingle of keys. In less than a minute, the young nurse was poking her head through the widening crack in the door.
“I’m sorry,” the Alpha murmured, low and atonal, he didn’t offer any reason for being in John’s room. But honestly, he didn’t have to. Their relationship was already strained almost to the breaking point; John certainly wasn’t going to kick him out.
John did so, and shifted about on the cushions till his grouchy hip stopped its grumbling and quieted down. The Omega heard Sherlock shuffling about in the kitchen, opening and closing various doors and tins, but he didn’t turn to look behind him, instead he focused on the plethora of scientific books and journals strewn across the dusty surface of the coffee table.  Sherlock was a very learned man; that much was apparent in the way he held himself and in his public school accent, but John didn’t realize he was such an academic. The blond sifted through a few of the publications, before Sherlock appeared by his side, offering a cup of delicious smelling Earl Grey tea that was just milky enough to be satisfactory. He didn’t bother to think how Sherlock knew how he liked his tea, he supposed the man deduced it from the way he wore his jumper or put on his socks or something.
Biting, stinging, fumes barraging every sense – he could taste it, thick and caustic on his tongue, the density of it in the air muffled his hearing and stung his eyes.
John didn’t actually
It was time for John to take his leave as well. He had to get back to the bungalow and inform everyone he was still alive. John worked his stiffening body out of the well-worn chair, looking about the room for his coat.
The Beta brightened suddenly, clenching his soiled gloves tightly in his hands. After a silent moment, he stuffed them in the pocket of his lab coat and slapped John loudly on the back, as if he hadn’t just completely abused his trust and position as a healthcare provider.
“He’s not her husband!” Julia’s eyes flashed, before she swallowed heavily and looked down at the ground apologetically, “I’m sorry I – we don’t even like to think about him.”
John panted, his blue and white checked cotton shirt clinging to his armpits and the small of his back. He could feel his sweat gather in small, glistening pools around the edges of his collarbone; he could feel the moisture tickling at the hidden entrance between his swollen buttocks, which felt unusually plump and aching, begging to touched, groped, or squeezed in brutal and viciously lovely ways.
John placed a palm on his forehead, closing his eyes tightly and breathing in to calm his nerves and his stomach. The paracetamol had finally kicked in, and the overwhelming aches and pain he’d lived with the past few days were subsiding, but only just.  He caught a brief flash of his own reflection as he hobbled his way to the lift bay, and he had to admit it, good god he looked

“Of course! Of course!” He took her hand in his, wincing at the touch. He wasn’t exactly big on the physicality of the commoners, of how much they needed to touch and pet and soothe. He would rather a moment’s peace and a hot, hard hit of heroin than any soppy, forced display of humanity others were so fond of. But he would allow this, just for a moment, if only to continue this charade.
Location: New Scotland Yard, London
The line moved slowly, and just as slowly, everyone departed through the church doors and moved through the cemetery. When only the priest was left, he moved towards John, hands clasped over a worn copy of the Bible.
“The video – it ah…mentioned they used attenuated flu virus as the carrier, right?” The Omega looked back and forth between the two men, mouth dry and head aching, “do you think they still do?”
"You'll have to be more specific, Sherlock. I try to keep my wanking sessions quiet. I don't want to offend your apex sensibilities after all." He quipped, trying to diffuse the situation with a joke, poorly timed though it may be.
The blond lifted their clasped hands and brought his lips to the back of James’ hand. He kept them there, soft, soothing, merely brushing his back and forth in a whisper of a kiss.
The truth of the matter was, he found being in the company of Sherlock Holmes to be disturbing in so many ways, he couldn’t even begin to categorize how he felt about the man. And that
“Truth is…we don’t know where he is Sherlock. He wasn’t here when we arrived. The girls…” he motioned to the sniffling young women at the steps of the bungalow, “…haven’t seen him, and well – he’s not going to tell us much.” His exhausted brown eyes moved from the women to the unmoving tableau of Marcus’ corpse.
Well, to be fair, I was finishing up the War (yay!), and then NaNoWriMo hit me so hard I am still reeling. But here it is! Updated should be much more regular now. Beta'd by the incomparable Philalethia, who writes the most amazing stories. Many thanks to her for actually taking the time to edit this over the Thanksgiving holiday.
“Sherlock, are you…do you think I’m going to leave?”
He cracked a sardonic smile, “I don’t know, why don’t you ask me in a few days.”
, John,
. Look at them! Only a few minutes ago they were calm. Sad, yes, but calm.
A sharp knock at the door interrupted John’s stunned exclamation. Dr. Wilkes immediately removed his offending digit and tore off his gloves, clearing his throat in a vaguely guilty and off-putting manner.
She prattled on, gathering tubes, needles, and other supplies while John only half-listened. He wasn’t interested in learning more about that monster, and he fully planned on pressing charges once the case was over. It wouldn’t be surprising to him at all if he wasn’t the first Omega Dr. Wilkes had done this to; but if John could help it, he would certainly be one of the last. Even if he had nothing to do with the deaths (which was doubtful), John would see him prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Of course, this was nothing compared to the sudden fresh wave of burning, cramping agony that now assaulted his abdomen. When he tried to curl into the pain, his core muscles involuntarily flexing (a simple reflex it was, the foetal position), he was prevented from bending at the knees by the feel of rough fabric pulling at both his ankles.
“He’ll be your protection Sherlock, and I don’t want to hear another word about it.”
“You haven’t been answering my texts,” the Alpha challenged, moving further into the bungalow, taking in its dilapidated condition; mould, water stains, et al.
. Instead he remained lifeless, mouth slack, and as sallow as the dead themselves.
John didn’t take the phone, he only stared at the object for a bit, reached into his pyjama bottoms and extracted the folded piece of paper Mycroft had given him a scant few hours before. He had not read it, or even glanced at it yet.
“No idea, my only guess is he had some kind of reaction to the implant, though for the life of me I can’t imagine why. All the tests showed at least a 75% compatibility between his genome and the donor.”
“Ha!” Sherlock spun away, collecting and stacking his various slides into their holders, probably with a little more force than he should have, “don’t fool yourself John Watson, I don’t  have
“It’s…fine then but,” he was outright shaking now, voice broken, “but promise me never again…I…couldn’t bear to be used, deceived again. N-not by you. I love you Sherlock, and if you want to bond with me then…th-then okay, we can do this…w-we can figure this out -”
“If you were to go to most of these establishments documented here, you’d probably find their delivery area quite limited, or that they do not deliver at all. For London, this is normal, not unusual at all, but for our investigation, it’s quite telling. But what exactly does it
Julia exhaled a forced, gusty breath, turning away to stare out the window nervously. She looked as if, at any moment, some kind of beast would break through the door and make corpses of them all.
The young nurse who just let herself through an expertly camouflaged door immediately pressed an emergency button on the wall before lunging herself at his person and gripping both his wrists.
“Good. I just need to go over a few things first. Simple really, just some background information.”
UPDATE:  There were some glaring omissions in this chapter that I can't believe ya'll let me get away with!! So I have only edited it slightly.
Regaining consciousness was a laborious, and exquisitely painful, process. If it weren’t for the pulsing, pounding pain currently taking residence in the occipital region of his skull, he’d be certain he was already dead. When he did finally manage to open a puffy eye, he was met only with smoky darkness and shadows shifting and coalescing into a space he was wholly unfamiliar with.
, yes I’m fine, Sherlock.” He clutched at his chest a moment, only to catch his breath, and frowned at his torn jacket and split jumper. He just couldn’t seem to catch a break. Marcus, a motionless figure at his feet, moaned quietly, a pinky finger twitched in the dirt. He had taken a nasty hit to the head, but he was still alive.
“I…I’m moving you off of the mobile medic unit.”
“Well, she was beautiful for one - coppery hair, lovely dark eyes, always smiling. We couldn’t resist. We didn’t give a damn about her gender status, of course, and it took us several years, but when she was finally ours, I like to think we were all happy.”
He fought against the scent, though it was difficult. It bled into his brain, filling it with melancholy and hopelessness. Sherlock lurched towards the church and threw the doors open.
The aide cried, horror clearly written on his young face.
even, but he moved on quickly and rarely spared a thought towards the man nowadays.
Sherlock furrowed his brow, finally wrenching his changeable gaze from the laptop to settle on the small Omega leaning against the opposite table. Mycroft closed the media player and went through the motions of removing the thumb drive. When it was done, he wordlessly closed the computer with a snap.
to participate in our treatment program. I – I assure you, Mr. Holmes, no one is kept at the Serenity Cottage against their will.”
John had long since recognized the signs (he was a newly formed Omega, not stupid), even before their lovely Christmas party. It was difficult to explain, but it began innocently enough, with a low grade fever. He was too warm at night, eschewing his flannel jim-jams and opting for a more breathable jersey blend, which would still leave him fidgety and sweaty in the mornings. Even his eyeballs felt hot, and for a brief moment he entertained the idea that he had somehow got ‘flu.
The Omega reached over with his own right hand and laced his fingers through James’, gripping his hand tight, willing to give comfort to this man who was obviously sharing some difficult information about his past. He remained quiet.
John was only able to nod his head once, sharply, in agreement. He ripped his eyes away from their obvious point of interest; Major Sholto’s pleasantly flushed lips, and met his ludicrously close gaze. This was observed, of course, by Major Sholto himself who, without any kind of admonishment whatsoever, gave John a small secretive smile.
Well,
“Jimmy Price, you have his identification already, I know. Homeless, latent Omega and participating in that study I told you about three weeks ago. Do you remember?” Sherlock raised his eyebrows in a condescending fashion, knowing full well the DI probably had much on his plate and might not remember a stray comment from the apex Alpha that he only begrudgingly allowed on his crime scenes.
“Do-do you think so?” Sherlock questioned, looking for once like he wasn’t entirely sure what to think. The man’s haughty countenance wavered, replaced with an endearing but hesitant innocence that seemed equally as happy with John’s statement as he was to find a lolly in his pocket.
(See the end of the chapter for
OTHER: We need you to relay everything you’ve learned about being a vertex Omega.
John closed his eyes suddenly, wincing and forcing down a familiar, intrusive flash of limpid brown eyes in his mind. The vision stung like ice, burning along his spine, a feeling he’d only assigned to dreams and flashbacks of a cruel smile but warm, damp hands.
to be homeless?”
“W-well, something like that stays with a person, of course.”
praise.
“But what…what about my heats? My scent? Irene says it’s almost irresistible but…my experience has been quite different.”
“Got…to go-” again John tried to stand, but this time he found himself held in place by Sherlock’s large hand on his uninjured shoulder. It was firm but gentle; the expression on the Alpha’s face resigned and unyielding.
That had been almost fun. That had been
Sherlock drove deeper and deeper into John, grunting and groaning in a way that made John’s heart sing. The Omega was awash in carnal sensation, the movement, the friction, the spot that Sherlock managed to tease when he was deep, deep inside John that made him cry out in ecstasy. How could there be anything more than this? More than two bodies connecting in an ancient way to bring pleasure and life unto this world. This is what they were made for, right? This is what life was all about.
“Did he?” the younger Holmes sniped, looking upwards, watching his reflection in the dull metal of the lift ceiling. “He does tend to be a bit dramatic. He also tends to poke his fat nose into things which aren’t his business.”
She twittered and retired to her own flat, closing the door softly. John made his way up the (seventeen?) steps to 221B and called out for Sherlock. There was no answer.
,” James moaned out behind him, grunting and frowning in turns (funny how facial expressions of pleasure can be so close to pain), grasping John’s slick skin with burning palms, pulling him flush against his body, “fuck…
“Yes,” the stunted reply was rather terse.
John said nothing, and the distinct
“Just, um, don’t go anywhere…I mean – not as if you could, you know…because you’re…well,” she sighed, shaking her head in annoyance, one messy braid flopping off her shoulder, “I’ll just shut up now and get Sherlock.”
Sherlock barely heard the Guide, so enrapt was he in the startling stink of chlorine in his Mind Palace, of all places. It was unwelcome, foreign, and it wasn’t until his surrounding began to fade that he was brought back to the attention by his Guide.
about other people.
“No...no, I can’t - I...” was the last thing the Omega managed to force from his lips before he collapsed, boneless, slouching backwards into the chair. His head slumped downwards towards his chest, face slackened and jaw slightly open, the stress and hardships of the day gone, his wrinkles smoothed away by slumber (forced though it was).
“Oi, freak, what are
Then the light flickered off, a simple click of a button to show that this ‘John’ person found what he was looking for. It hadn’t taken very long, and the all-encompassing darkness engulfed settled back around him. Sherlock was less concerned this time. He felt inexplicably safe.
, at least, he could handle.
Sherlock lowered them gently, sweetly, and devoutly unto the sheets, though he was still trapped behind his Omega because of his knot. Every once in a while he would grunt and groan, another orgasm shooting a sizeable load of semen into John’s passage, little good though it would do.
. Logic was his boon, his safety blanket, his protection from feelings and emotions of lesser beings. Logic protected him.
POLICE: We have been briefed on your kind and our medical services felt that masks were necessary.
John barely managed not to roll his eyes - only Sherlock Holmes could propose a lifetime of shared love and commitment and make it sound like a business transaction.
“Of course you are free to go as you wish, Dr. Watson.” Mycroft stated in his uniquely clipped tone. The obsequious delivery grated on John’s nerves, and he found he didn’t have many to spare at the moment. The older Alpha turned his torso slightly to the left, reached into his inside coat pocket and pulled out a twice folded piece of paper. It slotted between his index and pointer fingers as he held it outwards towards the good doctor.
Sherlock made to take a sip from his coffee before the scent of the liquid soured and became offensive. He growled and threw the mug across the room, watching as it shattered in an explosion of ceramic dust and shards.
Trudi came back within five minutes, embarrassment resolved, and gripping a small multi-dose vial of clear liquid. It was only the work of a moment to receive the jab, and afterwards she squeezed his hand, green eyes full of warmth and caring.
John leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs; he was currently dressed in a worn pair of jeans (rather baggy on his thin frame now), and one of his least threadbare jumpers. He tried to wear his cleaner, nicer clothing on consultation days, if he could. He had sent the pyjama bottoms and striped jumper back to Sherlock’s residence by way of Raz, the same little punk that managed to get John’s face punched in. That was two weeks ago, and he hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the enigmatic detective since. It was just as well, John was beginning to feel rather strangely around the apex Alpha. It was very much like how he felt with Major Sholto (James), and John was more than certain he did
Dr. Barrymore veritably jumped from his chair, stammering more nonsensical apologies and upsetting a rather large stack of folders on his desk. They tilted, tipped, and then quickly fell to the ground in a fantastic display of gravity and air resistance, the papers flipping and sliding on air currents down to the floor. Dr. Barrymore’s face turned maroon, a quite alarming colour for a fully grown man, and he hastily gathered up the guts of each folder before dashing out the door for the requested coffee.
The Alpha continued his prolonged eye-contact, and John stared back in kind. He couldn’t pull his eyes away from this enigmatic man if his life depended on it.
“Let’s just say I know what they like,” she winked at him slowly, as if they shared some private joke – a joke John knew absolutely nothing about, but wouldn’t be averse to finding out. He had nothing on after all…at least nothing he couldn’t heartlessly abandon.
, John thought wryly as he wriggled his way out of his trousers, leaving them sopping and in a heap in front of Sherlock’s bedroom door.
“Is…something the matter?” John crossed the threshold from the hallway into the sitting room, his eyebrows drawn in concern. When he decided to leave the loo, he was a little more content with his appearance. His blonde hair, now graying more than it should at the temples, was clipped all around in a familiar military style; and he was clean shaven for the first time in weeks. He felt clean, really truly clean, and it felt wonderful.  Though he appeared a bit gaunt, the cleft of his chin and his cheekbones sticking out a bit too far, he didn’t look like he was going to fly away with the next stiff breeze.
“It will be completed soon,” she assured, laying a gentling touch against the starched knit of his lab coat, “I will know it and he will know it. They will be able to smell it, all of the others.”
“Right, as if being invalided out of the military and losing my bonded Sentinel wasn’t enough, now
And so the scene was set, each macabre player perfectly positioned, appearing sallow and tired under the intensely glaring lights.
“Alright, it’s time. I have to get going, yeah? Here’s a few quid. I want you to get something to eat, something for myself as well…and I mean
“Yes. Yes, alright.” She turned away from the two men and sat down next to the confused Alpha in the gravel. She touched at his head with gentle, loving hands, making soft noises to placate the previously quite distraught man.
He made sure to avoid the nose and teeth, he didn’t want to do any lasting damage after all, but he knew his aim was true when Sherlock’s head cracked viciously over his right shoulder and he stumbled backwards, only managing not to fall by grabbing the sides of the worn green kitchen table. Sherlock was dazed, stung, his knees bent and his face a battlefield of emotions: hurt, surprise, anger, dismay, all of which vied for dominance.
John’s laughter died down and he huffed at the rectangular menace, digging deep into his brain matter, thinking there must be something in there that could help him operate this shiny piece of technology.
His previous experiences were never like this - gentle, unhurried, reverential. Sherlock languished next to the doctor, thumbs spinning slow, unconscious circles into the Omega's skin, hips pressed against his lower belly. If John didn't know any better, he'd mistake this behaviour for something normally found in a mated pair.
open to new experiences.”
“Oh, of course, make yourself comfortable.”
“I’m not done! You asked me to join this study, I did. You also keep asking me to move in with you, which, by the way, is ridiculous and completely inappropriate as I barely know anything about you. Now, I just found out I might have accidentally signed my own death certificate, so for once, Sherlock, I want simple answers from you and I want the truth.”
“I’m not a
The scene set before him was like something out of a crime novel, or an incredibly realistic police series. There were several panda cars parked near an alleyway and John could feel the heavy dampness of the air around him. He surmised they must be somewhere closer to the Thames, though quite a bit further east than his current haunt near the bridge. People milled about, some talking on their mobiles, others filling out paperwork against metal clipboards. The black Coroner’s van was situated quite a ways down the alley, and there was no sign of Sherlock.
Dr. Frankland tightened the restraints on her wrists and shouted to the two other men on the scene.
“You might change your mind. I can be very
be. What exactly are trying to say here?”
“Okay John.” The larger man’s tenor answered amiably, following behind like him like John was the comet and Marcus his tail.
Julia snorted, rolling her eyes.
“Jesus bloody Christ Sherlock?!” Lestrade’s gruff voice perfectly illustrated how not tolerant he was feeling at the moment, “only I’ve been trying to get your attention the entire time you’ve been here.”
It was difficult, at first, but he healed - and with healing, he became aware, slowly, and without much fanfare, that he was no longer the same as he was before.
IMA: Do you? Well, then you don’t need my help after all.

.” The diminutive nurse next to him was about two seconds away from a panic attack, meanwhile the scrub tech readied to continue compressions after John let off in about thirty seconds.
John stepped through the doors, relishing the warm gust of air that caressed his face as he did so. It was a right bit more comforting that he really thought it should be, considering he wasn’t entirely sure he would even be leaving this building alive.
“When is the procedure scheduled?” he asked abruptly, thumbing his mobile in his woollen coat, avoiding the urge to scratch randomly at his wrists. She regarded him with a wry, knowing smile.
“Not sure, hard to be disappointed in someone I’ve never met, though I am
“I don’t even know how to explain it. I have the utmost faith in our procedure. We’ve done this dozens of times and nothing like this has ever happened – at least not to my knowledge.” He unfolded the clump of papers on the desk, smoothing out the wrinkles with a practised hand. “We have had other complications of course, but nothing quite like this. I’m…at a loss.”
John blinked; he blinked
“Why don’t I show you to your room?”
His mouth dropped open, coffee forgotten.
Sherlock snorted unbecomingly, his nose wrinkling in a petulant fashion, “Oh please, you
How the
It didn’t matter – John shot into action. He quickly pulled out his mobile and began taking picture after picture, the flash illuminating the room in uneven bursts of light.
IMA: Are you going to tell me what you want from me, or am I supposed to just sit here and look pretty?
“I felt it too. Please, try to calm down. I don’t know how you’re projecting like this but try to make every effort to stop, right now.”
justsuperblue.tumblr.com
“No,” he exhaled, speaking softly to no one in particular, “guess I’ll have to wait it out.”
Marcus dropped the paper bag he held at his side, uncaring as it plopped to the ground and fell to its side, spilling its contents onto the cold, wet cement.
, he really didn’t have to fake it, he felt
However, the only logical course of action, at this point, was to continue to play along. Sherlock was a consummate actor, and convincing a few simple Apprentice Guides (besides Sally) and Journeyman Sentinels that he was just a victim of his exceptional gifts was no difficult task.
“What does that have to do with anything,
That was when Sherlock planted a heavy hand on Marcus’ shoulder, twisting his own head in a sharp, abortive motion that clearly indicated the larger man should not continue with his current goal. Marcus rolled his eyes back to Sherlock, fear clearly glinting in the reflective whites of his eyes as he audibly swallowed, and stayed sat in the dirt like a very unhappy but obedient dog.
“What do I want? What do
John winced as his Alpha raised his voice, his Adam’s apple spasming and chest heaving. But no, he would be strong and see this through.
Sherlock's mind palace spun in on itself, whirling like some kind of twisted carousel of John's skin, John's hair, John's scars, John's nipples, John's lips, John's ears, John's neck,
So sorry this chappie is a bit late. I kinda struggled with it, not gonna lie. In any case, here it is!
“Oh, bless…” She moved inside, fluttering one hand behind her to close the door and juggling the myriad of supplies in her grasp, “I’m so sorry, I really am. You must think us so unprofessional,” Trudi twittered nervously, laying everything she needed out on the table.
With a start, John leant over the dingy desk, its Formica surface peeling and lifting at the edges. He grasped the worn and wrinkled folder, throwing it open to reveal the leaflet Sherlock had asked for.
A military man, perhaps?
But no, really, it wasn’t.
That’s exactly how he found her, moving with a frantic energy and hunched over some ungodly loud, whirring machine.
Officer Murray remained silent throughout the entire exchange, eyes moving back and forth from the consulting detective and DI like he was watching a particularly engaging tennis match.
Mycroft was more than happy to leave. Dr. Barrymore was probably the least affable man he’d ever met, and as the unofficial leader of the United Kingdom, he’d met with a great deal of boorish characters in his time.
“Marcus!” John exhaled loudly in relief. He really didn’t have the energy for another unexpected encounter today, and was already sporting enough bruises and injuries to last a lifetime. He glanced down to the container held in the man’s hands, Chinese food that was probably hours old and quite cold by now. “Was that lunch? For me?”
Molly slung her oversized bag over her left shoulder, a bit of her long scarf getting caught up under the straps.
“Moriarty.”
OTHER: As you know, we’ve already interviewed REDACTED and REDACTED, but they can’t really give use the kind of information we desire.
“So, John, tell me about yourself. I have a bit of your history here but…you know how impersonal paperwork can be.”
Note 9/28/15: Really Blue? Obelisk???? LOLOLOL. That should teach me not to write my chappies after I've had some wine. *snort*
Regardless of what they wanted to do in this appointment, he would make it short. They could draw blood, sure, but then he was leaving. He might beg off, saying he’d had a reaction to the flu shot (not uncommon, or completely untrue), and the question of whether or not they believed him was entirely moot at this point.
, he thought with mild amusement.
“No…no, it’s alright. Things happen, I understand.”
John sighed, exasperated, and let himself inside, unceremoniously plunking himself down and taking in the remarkably posh interior. It was positively cavernous, and John wondered if there wasn’t some kind of extra-dimensional TARDIS-like effect going on that he wasn’t aware of.
In the end, it was only a distance of three short city blocks until Soo Lin pointed at the seemingly abandoned and condemned warehouse. On the outside, there was no indication that it had been occupied or even used in any capacity in years. This was on the outside though, and as the old adage says, it’s always what’s on the
a voice - soft, quiet,
“I can hear you thinking all the way from the bedroom,” Sherlock stepped into the kitchen, fiddling with his cufflinks and frowning at the small silver menaces. “You’re worried.”
Visit me on the Tumbles.
The long buttery shadows cast by the sodium streetlamps made the street look empty, haunted. It was a quiet, lonely kind of atmosphere that lent itself to long insightful moments and dispirited musings. He took a long look down both sides of the lane before opening the battered, creaky door and entering the dark living space they had successfully cleared only a week or so before.
“Not at first,
“John…I…” he looked uncertain; an expression ill-fitted on his aristocratic face, “I apologize for my manners, well, lack thereof and would be pleased if you would join me in a cup of tea? It will be my treat, of course.”
bad...but we have performed dozens of procedures since then and there have been no indications of this type of thing happening again. I can only hope it was a one off, a-an aberration.”
He realized his hand – his
Even though their relationship had been strained as of late, John still gazed at the quiet man with open, but wary affection. They’d never talked about what had happened that night when Marcus had lost control and gone feral…and John sensed the larger man didn’t want to. It had taken quite a bit of soul-searching on John’s part to figure out whether he wanted to forgive the simple Alpha or not. Sherlock had mentioned with surety that if he had not intervened when he had, then things would have gotten…well, John didn’t want to think about that. The important thing was that
But they persevered, as lovers who are inexperienced but eager always do, and the sharp pain and muscular clench of outright penetration finally gave way to a warm and growing sense of pleasure John felt somewhere, deep down in his muscles. Sherlock whispered dangerous things, promises and affirmations that were absurdly romantic considering he was fucking John’s brains out and on the precipice of merging their lives in one glorious teeth-ripping moment of pain and brutality.
Scent,
Another wave of scent pushed through the air as the man inhaled deeply and John finally rolled over to regard him with a heavily lidded gaze.
“I’m…I’m a…a colleague,” John offered by way of explanation, now that he had found his voice.
“There are order forms you can fill out, we have some pre-approved items which you may make use of. Your personal handler, Mrs. Hudson, should be around by dinnertime to show you the rest of Serenity Cottage.”
Without warning, he swung his long legs outwards, and practically erupted from his chair, energy crackling along his frame as he began to pace. It was quite obvious that this next topic of conversation was very exciting, for him at least. John had the good fortune to realize he was staring early on, and closed his mouth as to not appear like a codfish.
“Go on,” the older man breathed.
Sherlock looked up at him, his vivid eyes shining, then leant forward and enveloped John in a warm, and quite wonderful, hug. He nosed at John’s neck, inhaling his scent with abandon, and John did the same, relishing the unique and delicious mix of pheromones exclusive to his Alpha.
The flat was more or less how he remembered it though:  the couch on the north wall, the steel and leather chair, the hideously upholstered maroon recliner that John sat in last time, and so on and so forth. The entire space was awash with the scent of the apex Alpha, the spicy notes of wood smoke and pipe tobacco meandered through the air, unseen but felt like wintry drafts in an old Victorian mansion.  John allowed himself a moment to breathe it all in, and wondered what it would be like to be wrapped in that scent always. What it would be like to wake up with it slithering all around him, pervading his senses, all encompassing. Almost like a lifetime promise of love and protection.
He allowed himself to be ushered unceremoniously out of the room, then out of the small building in exactly the same way he came in. The air outside was fresh and clean, stirring about his person with a touch a lavender. He took a few steps out towards the packed dirt driveway, peering in the distance at the main building of Serenity Cottage proper and shook his head.
All at once the smell almost knocked Sherlock back into the horrid plastic ficus situated just behind the serving queue. He wasn’t entirely sure this was food, it couldn’t be food, could it? Sherlock could smell all manner of chemicals that certainly did not belong in a traditional curry and inwardly cursed his Sentinel senses – they’d put him off cheap take-out and lesser quality food since puberty.
Mrs. Hudson nodded in that matronly way of hers. He wasn’t sure, but the older Omega seemed to be gunning for some kind of relationship between himself and Sherlock. He could save her the energy and tell her right out that that was impossible, but he just couldn’t keep himself from uttering the actual words.
But Marcus would not be calmed, he thundered towards John, kicking up dirt and rocks beneath his feet as he reached the Omega and grabbed him by the lapels, lifting him up like a ragdoll.

“As I was saying before, there were some unusual results in his lab tests, but first…the autopsy.” She placed the folder on an adjacent table and pulled the heavy white sheet away from the body, revealing his mangled face and the large ‘Y’ incision indicative of all autopsies. Further down, the large gash in his lower abdomen had been cleaned and carefully stitched together. It was clear there wasn’t much they could do for the poor boy’s face.
She approached him with her arm outstretched; holding a silver blister pack of medication identical to the one Jimmy Price had shown him only days ago. On the smooth foiled back, a sticker was attached with John’s full name, birthdate, and some kind of serial number.
He actively stifled his cries, the sobs that broke above the stoic surface as they often did when he dreamed of the Army, of Afghanistan. But there wasn't anything to do, there wasn't anything to be
His breath hitched, pausing in its exhalation to stick painfully in the brunet’s throat.
“Why can’t I tell anyone about you –” His last word ended in a strangled cough, gouts of flames speared down his throat, leaving agony in their wake.
but this came on fast.
It was as if John actually
The Omega closed his eyes and succumbed to the motion of the kiss, if one could call it simply a kiss. It seemed more like the meeting of two souls connected only by breath and the touch of one fervent mouth to another. His lover sensed his distraction, and wasted no time in using it to his advantage. He broke off the kiss, and spent a long moment hovering over John’s face. They were nose to nose but John still could not see. He sensed the Alpha’s radiating warmth and felt his sweet, steaming hot breath caress his bottom lip. The spittle quickly evaporated around John’s mouth, and he circled upwards with his hips once, bumping their groins together and reminding the other man of his need.
Dr. Wilkes and Dr. Adler could not be more different. Dr Wilkes was a grotesque, bumbling excuse for a man, and Dr. Adler was a creature of the silver screen. How could these two have
, lovemaking could ever feel like this.
“Yesssss…” The Alpha hissed, gripping his impressive and imposingly turgid shaft in his right hand, lining up with John’s entrance, feeling the blood-hot kiss of tension as he first makes contact with his Omega’s passage.
“Sherlock,” it was a warning, short, but a warning nonetheless. Lestrade levelled a glare at him that would have cowed a lesser man…but Sherlock Holmes was no
SO HARD!!! The set-up has to be just right. So here you have, the perfect set-up. Next chappie will be it.
When he spoke again, John sounded relieved beyond all measure. “Thank you. I have another appointment for the study in two days, I’ll ring you then.”
him and cover his back in painful impact bruises - and
At this point, John had managed to stuff down his life-changing revelation into a little red ball in the pit of his stomach. He would deal with all this later, no need to complicate things now.
What the hell
“I said; this is an official crime scene. We don’t allow civilians or whoever you are to hang about and gawk. Now tell me who you are or
John cried out, “
Slowly, he shimmied out from under his duvet wrap and inhaled, opening his abilities to the world around him. He expanded his senses no further than his own room, having already been through the pain of overreaching a few days ago.
John jerked, muscles painfully pulling in his injured thigh. This…this was unacceptable, this was
just say that?
Her hair was perfectly coifed and held back in a clasp that had clearly seen better days, once brassy but dulled with time and one too many liberal coats of hairspray. It was naturally curly, distinctive, but frizzed along the ends, so it had been quite a while since her last haircut. Her makeup was sparse, calling upon her natural comeliness rather than manufactured beauty, but her mascara caked and scaled along the eye-line, sending flakes below her eyes like tiny, dirty flecks of soot. The blouse was new, as evidenced by the sheen on the buttons, but her pants frayed at the hems. Her shoes were ill-fitting, veritably bursting at the sides as the narrow fit did a wide foot no favours. All in all she was a working Guide, no Tower favourite here and…oh yes, absently fingering a small-chained gold-plated bracelet worth hardly anything at all.
“Those uh, stairs…” John motioned to the seventeen steps up to 221B, “might need a little help.”
“Yes, alright, go get your things.” He nodded towards the stairs, while Marcus smiled his biggest gapped tooth smile and bounded up to the second story.
It would be an easy thing, he thought, to slant his head just so...bend it to the side in a silent act of willing but unspoken submission.
It didn’t bother him in the least, of course. If he really
Both John and Trudi passed by several security guards on the way out. The blond gave them a wide berth, not wishing to cause attention to himself, but they seemed more interested in getting a bit of the story from Jeremy before heading into the fray themselves. Things had quieted down noticeably since his arrival, but John knew that didn’t necessarily mean anything. He entertained a fleeting fantasy of Dr. Wilkes groaning in pain, nose bloodied…it would serve the bastard right.
Hello again everyone! Another update, I added some extra stuff to the tags to cover what's in this chapter. I tried to be descriptive without getting too icky with it. In any case, if you have been following, then you should know there is a dead body described in this chapter.
He smiled to himself, although that smile wavered with the first crash of Sherlock’s shoulder flung against the door. The hinges groaned at the ill-treatment, and John was thankful that Mrs. Hudson was away at her sister’s for a marathon bridge tournament, lest she be subjected to their lustful and not-so-quiet, and possibly quiet violent, lovemaking. John’s heels skidded against the floor before he managed to secure it once more, inching off his soaking pants as he did so.
“John, I didn’t mean –”
a study. It doesn’t seem too unusual that genetic therapy would be a new viable option for Formation.”
John packed what little belongings he had into his large, rather oblong, army duffle bag. He had become quite adept at neatly folding his dirty clothes, artfully placing them in elegantly vertical piles, one on top of each other, till magically the bag managed to carry all the clothing he owned (among other things). Lastly, he folded his bedroll, encompassing a collection of flannels and one threadbare blanket within, and latched it to the faded green bag using a snap on the side. He slung the entire mass over his right shoulder with a grimace, trying not to be too aware of the fact that this bundle of cloth symbolized all the things he had in this world.
It was true that over the past week or so he had garnered much more attention than he ever would have as a latent Omega. Strangers were overly friendly, children flocked to him, and he’d been witness to more than one display of so-called Alpha bravado to win his favour (the most amusing, recently, being a pack of sixth-formers who’d puffed out their chests like a pack of crowing roosters). The thought that the population of England, as a whole, now considered John to be prime mate and bonding material left him more amused than anything else.
She ground her thumb on the button frantically, hoping against hope that the team would come swiftly and she wouldn’t have to explain to Dr. Mortimer how her charge had managed to cock everything up and
This had to be him, the man; the man that Brandy mentioned in the squalid bungalow. This had to be the apex Alpha, for never was there a person that so embodied genetic perfection than the tall, curly haired specimen impatiently glowering before him. Currently, the perfect specimen was actually standing
I'm fun, I promise!
Mrs. Whitney frowned, obviously not approving of his attitude. “She will not be your housekeeper, Mr. Holmes!”
John froze in his chair, a wash of cool adrenaline forcing its way through his system before he willfully forced his heart to calm its frantic beating. He swallowed his mouthful of unsweetened tea and placed the cup down gently, unable to make eye contact with his Alpha.
"A shoulder to cry on?" John finally looked at Sherlock, who appeared equally as uncomfortable as John felt. The man was hunched over his violin, clutching the poor instrument as a child does to its mother's skirts. "You got that from a book."
How did he end up here? Here of all places – with this man? How did the comedies and fractal iterations of life land
“They need me. It’s my
John set his jaw and grabbed his clothes, anxiously making himself presentable.  James moved off the bed hurriedly, wrapping the blanket around his lower half and not bothering with his pants.

…it’s been
tell the man.
“John, please just call me John.”
The younger gentleman looked very much like Marcus, and Sherlock could only assume it was brother, close in age, probably younger. He lived alone, worked long hours, and was renting the ill-fitting suit that was entirely too snug around his shoulders. He was surely a Beta, and it was easy to see that –
"Yes. Thank you Gustav, it wasn't that difficult, really."
” John fisted his hands, pulling his left up to his temple and pressing hard, needlessly so. His headache was growing worse by the minute and he wasn’t sure he could stand the smell of the morgue much longer. His stomach turned, gurgling in his abdomen. He needed to leave and he needed to leave soon.
He didn’t look behind him as he limped out of the flat, slowing down as he hit the stairs.
“Forget the coffee; I think…well, I might be on to something.”
“I don’t plan to be.” He laughed, he outright snickered at the thunderous look on his mate’s face, until he realized Sherlock would make quick work of the belt loops and come at him with every devious thought ever borne from that wickedly exceptional brain.
With a twist of his hand he closed off the valves and the clear running stream trickled away and died, taking John’s unanticipated warm feelings with it. Now came the most difficult and daunting task of all…his head; his hairy, hairy head.
Sherlock cocked his head to the side then, eyes looking out into the misty London scenery, “although looking back now, I guess I should have expected it. You do have a temper and quite a tendency for violence.”
"If you had intended a joke along these circumstances, I would hope that -"
“Yeah? Says who?” Mycroft or no Mycroft, he didn’t like being ordered around. This warranted an explanation, and John would go nowhere until he had one.
“Erm, it was…fine. Just an exam and interview process, nothing too difficult.” John was reluctant to share any more information with this new Omega, in fact, knowing what he knew now; he didn’t want him to go in at all.
responsible for your injuries, but he
Finally, Sherlock spoke, voice uncertain and thick with emotion. John noticed as the brunet angled his face a fraction towards John, that his eyelids were blinking quickly and unevenly, a flutter of movement that was both disconcerting and endearing all the same.
It would take a little more research and a few phone calls, but it could work, and while it danced dangerously near actual brain surgery, it would be no more invasive than what they’d originally attempted.
But she was having none of it, apparently, and it seemed it would take more than a few sulky grumblings to put off one Martha Hudson.
After they’d arrived at 221B Baker Street, the Alpha regained his energy and flitted about the flat with the comfort and ease of one who knew exactly where the needle was in the haystack; John himself could sense no discernible rhyme or reason to the haphazard placement of Sherlock’s belongings, including books, papers, clothing, and one viciously stabbed-to-the-wall Cluedo playing board. The blond raised his eyebrows in unfeigned curiosity,
That morphed into an intense pleasure that rivaled the orgasm that just left him flailing and stupid as he took his lover’s knot. His cock, obviously flaccid after spending itself so thoroughly after that fantastic (and first time knotting) orgasm, rose impossibly to attention once more, twitching itself into a dry orgasm that was somehow even more intense than the one previous.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, flashing John a look of unsteadiness not often seen on his handsome face. The people milling about the concrete courtyard of the Centre began to take notice of the two, probably wondering what on Earth these two men could possibly be arguing about (and why they couldn’t take it somewhere
Kudos and comments appreciated like rubies, emeralds, and bags of glitter!
“Please, please, John don’t worry. There’s no danger for you here any longer. Mycroft and the government will find her and put it all to rights. This is a safe place for you, I promise.”
were over – and the knowledge of it would be clear in the final dilation of his pupils as he pulled in his last cursed breath.
, he mouthed, before his face contorted completely, a noiseless sob robbing him of his control.
John stripped off his coat, letting it lay next to his bedroll, which also smelt of dirt and sweat. He reminded himself he needed include this ratty excuse for a bed when next he did the washing, which would hopefully be in a day or two, when (and if) he felt better. He always seemed to forget about it, focussing more on washing his clothes and body then flannels and bedrolls. Surprisingly enough, it was Marcus that reminded him more often than not.
In one ridiculously graceful motion, Sherlock easily ignored John’s question, straightened his knees and took in both of the Omegas, focusing sharply on Sarah, who looked almost as tongue-tied and star-struck as Marcus did right now. John watched as her expression changed from curious, to amazed, and then openly appreciative of the male Alpha before her. A burst of Omega pheromones hurtled through the autumn air, subconscious probably, and Sarah slowly smiled at Sherlock, tucking an errant lock of hair behind her ear. It was almost like watching a child lay eyes on their first Christmas tree, lit up with fairy lights and heavy with presents. Sarah appeared so enrapt, that John fidgeted nervously and elbowed her in the ribs as he cleared his throat.
“This entire situation, oh it’s so terrible John, really.” Martha Hudson veritably gushed, running her small hands down his arms in open adoration. “And Sherlock, he’s been such a mess, you wouldn’t believe –”
“Um…Hamish.”
, an apex Alpha, hanging around. I will be careful, of course.”
“Mary’s not available to go out tonight, or any night thereafter. Do not come by again.” The man rudely flipped John’s ID card away with his fingers, letting it flit and fall, clattering to the ground. John watched it land with his heart in his throat, and only glanced up when he hear the door slam shut.
“We need to find his family, they deserve to know.” John worked on his breathing again, feeling the rush of emotion ebb ever so slightly with the familiar cadence of respirations.
“If something like this happens again, I want to be informed immediately.”
positively dreadful as well.
reason you’ve solved even a fraction of your cases!”
And He surely didn’t know how this was supposed to all be accomplished during a mere two-week stay…and Sherlock didn’t like not knowing.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched, then he rifled through the papers, spreading then all out one by one, till each glinting surface of the brushed metal table was covered.
He couldn’t say why Dr. Watson favoured the man with such a look, only that his time was valuable and he’d already wasted an entire afternoon in this place. He was assured Sherlock was fine, and was due to make a full recovery, with the added bonus of an alternative treatment, and really, that was all he cared about. The power play between these two lesser men was beneath him.
Captain John Watson lost his words, suddenly. He lost his thoughts, and by God his very faith in this world as he saw the vehicle in front of him lurch suddenly and then jack-knife, tail end up in a burst of hellish flames. The Land Rover ahead of them flipped end over end before landing with a sickening crunch in a spray of rocks and flaming debris.
It seemed they had used the badly timed interruption of Marcus’ appearance to get the upper hand after all.
She hummed a noise of assent, twisting the straight needle into the vacutainer, readying for the blood draw. The alcohol wipe was cold against the inner crook of John’s elbow.

The towel brushed against his head and he dried his hair as much as possible, which was easy, considering it was only an inch or so longer than the last time he was here. John pulled back his lips and inspected his teeth, they were a little fuzzier than he liked.  John didn’t have a toothbrush on hand, so he smoothed his finger over his teeth and sucked on the surface a bit. Oh well, he would get dressed and figure everything else later.
It seemed like a lifetime, in fact one hour and forty-five minutes, before John gazed upon the familiar under arches of the bridge again. At this point his hip burned, an agonizing pain John had not felt since his time at physiotherapy. It had been months since he had exercised his body to this extreme, but it wasn’t like he had a choice in the matter. He needed to get back to the bridge and he certainly couldn’t stay with the Holmes’; that kind of torture should only be reserved for terrorists and people convicted of animal cruelty.
chair now, after all), as Sherlock perched across from him, legs folded up to his chest in his own leather monstrosity. John was out of breath, sweating, and feeling entirely cranky and useless. It would just…take time, he realized. On the coffee table in front of him lay a dirty tea tray, presumably Mrs. Hudson’s, and one thin manila folder.
“You said ‘is’”
“Yes,
Sherlock sighed impatiently, grasping his hands behind his back in an effort to keep from touching the body himself. He pursed his lips, trying his very best to remain indulgent while Molly insisted on being overly poetic and emotional about the dead body in front of her.
Three days of Mycroft and Lestrade with their platitudes and reassurances (hollow though they were) – three days of Molly Hooper regarding him with the saddest brown eyes imaginable. Three days of everyone at Scotland Yard (no thanks to Anderson and his propensity towards gossip) greeting him with the sorriest expression they could muster. It was…
A few familiar characters come into play, and we learn a little bit more about this mysterious "procedure." Sherlock continues to be a brat.
appeals to you,” Sherlock quipped, turning around to lean against the cold metal edge of the table, well within view of the laptop’s high definition screen.
In a rare show of consideration (and almost kindness), Sherlock’s expression softened, as if to say:
With every painful step, John began to regret his hasty decision. It wasn’t like him to consciously reject a plea for help, nor did he make it a habit to openly lose his temper. Of course, he was rather blindsided by the two Alphas, and the insistent but soft pounding at the base of skull certainly didn’t help his patience.
Marcus looked down at the box for a moment; then quite suddenly heaved the container against a nearby stone wall. John flinched and watched in horror as it splattered against the uneven surface in an explosion of rice and some kind of chicken with sauce. The good doctor turned his wide-eyed gaze back towards the Alpha, unsure of what to expect next.
never imagine that someone like Sherlock Holmes would consider him beloved above all else.
“They won’t want charity, Sherlock. They are proud and strong, I…don’t mind if you help them a little but just, let them make their own decision about what they want to do, okay?”
John, face pale and wan, took a step back and bumped into the metal table behind him. His eyes were still glued to the static on the screen. It wasn’t that the video was terribly frightening; he had seen and lived through much worse (he was an army doctor after all), it was the fact that when all was said and done, he had somehow managed to recognize the young woman on the video.
She nodded, suddenly meek and pliable. Her entire manner seemed to deflate and she clasped her long fingers together, holding them in front of her like an ineffectual barrier.
“Well, because of your
John took both items and pocketed them in his worn jeans and placed his phone in the opposite pocket. He then stood, expecting to be dismissed.
. The showers in the day centre couldn’t hold a candle to this. John felt a welcome swell of contentment curl up in his chest…until he realized, all too quickly, that this was someone else’s flat, someone else’s water, and only temporary.
John felt a certain heaviness settle in his chest, a type of breathless, squeezing pressure clasping about his lungs so that inhaling became more than just difficult, but a distant memory. He felt this often now, when he thought about the Alpha and how they were both so different. They both came from such vastly opposite worlds that it still mystified John as to how he managed to become caught in the taller man’s orbit. The only problem was that the trajectory of said orbit (his more than Sherlock’s) seemed to be circling ever and ever closer, till he could only imagine the two of them colliding and neither of them being the better for it. Of the two of them, only one would survive such an impact, and John was certain it would not be an ex-army doctor with a bum hip and disfigured shoulder.
Lestrade nodded, his expression closed off now, and as equally severe. The older Detective moved away then, barking orders at his team to finish up and get moving - play time was over. Donovan and Anderson stood at a distance, flinging surreptitious glances at the apex Alpha, but remaining silent.
John. He was the only person Sherlock had ever felt for, the only one who’d stared at him with true awe and appreciation that wasn’t tainted by Sherlock’s own enticing mix of pheromones; and he was in danger, in danger of possibly

of metal hitting the ceramic floor. He slammed the man face first into the white wall, practically crushing his ribcage, sneering as he did so.
She smiled and dabbed at her eyes once more. “This is my husband Robert, and my youngest son, Theo. We’re all so grateful you came. After Marcus disappeared, we thought we’d never –”
“I’ll have my assistant make it her first priority.” The man paused, and for a moment John almost expected him to end the conversation without so much as a goodbye, but he continued, “Before I let you go Dr. Watson, what can you tell me about a man named James Moriarty?”
“Jesus,
So fast.
“Tell me where,” he said, commanding and forceful. He did not feel guilty when she stared back up at him, eyes widening, small glossy pink mouth open in awe. The apex Alpha knew then that she would do anything he asked, answer any questions - show him anything he wanted. He knew this familiar push and pull of pheromones and sex, and he always knew how to be the dominant partner. A lesser person might have thought this kind of power unethical, but Sherlock, this was part of who he was, after all…and this was all for a
John leant down into a crouch, his movements slow and controlled as he crawled towards the door. The body of the younger Alpha remained blissfully still by the cot, and John surmised it would probably be a bit longer before he woke up.

Molly blinked at that, but, strangely, she couldn’t find it in herself to be insulted.
He realized this all while sitting in his chair that Tuesday evening, his collar brushing irritatingly against his sensitive neck (really he wanted to just pull the damn thing off and…and…light it on fire or something) and reading the most recent copy of the Independent.
she arrived at all.
He didn’t stop to think what kind of sight he made: a scruffy, too skinny, and underfed Omega, furtively darting around the room with the seat of his pants soiled by his own secretions. At this point, it didn’t really matter; his mind had assessed his situation, stamped down on any non-essential bodily functions, and formed a plan of attack. While he knew nothing of the layout of the place, he knew how to fight, he knew how to damage sensitive soft tissue, and he knew how to do it quickly and silently. The gun was only a last resort.
“Guests?” Sherlock paused, raising one dark eyebrow and bearing down on the chatty woman. “Is that what you call us, Guests? As if we’re here of our own accord. Laughable. Really.”
Perhaps the smile had been too much. He was never very good at interacting with other people. That had always been Mycroft’s area.

The Omega looked up as he reached the last stair, only to find the large figure of Marcus coming through the front door, face awash with joy and smears of, chocolate?
“Okay, now I’m confused. He’s
It was always John now, the small man with the blond hair mixed with grey like shimmery, silver threading in a tapestry. He kept Sherlock right - and he would continue to do so when Sherlock found him. They’d stop their tiresome little mating dance and finally
“Okay, the pamphlet.” John pulled it back out from his pyjama pocket and finally unfolded the ruined paper. The edges were soft and stains littered the surface, but the printing was still quite clear.
John sighed and clenched his hands before giving his neck a roll and straightening his shoulders. Lately, he'd been sleeping poorly, plagued by massive headaches, and short-tempered with just about everyone who had the misfortune to step into his path. All of this, compounded with an increased workload, made him shite for company; and since the procedure on the younger Mr. Holmes his health had taken a turn for the worse.
Sherlock brought both his hands in front of his face abruptly, fingers twitching, “wait – wait a moment. Stop talking. Just stop talking full stop!”
Still, he thought it might be more interesting to feign a bit of ignorance.
I know. I KNOW I said only one more chappie. But then...then, background and characters...and story...

In any case, it's a little longer than my normal chappie, so I hope ya'll enjoy!
Marcus said nothing; only looking downwards towards the scuffed and filthy floor wearing a hang-dog expression John found quite heart-wrenching.
So together they made their way up to John’s new home, a thought so new and perplexing to his mind that it had taken the entirety of his two weeks in hospital to get used to the idea.
“I know what he means to you, brother. But I also know that these are ruthless people that have killed many, and I will not put my own blood in danger unless I know for sure we are headed in the right direction,” his voice raised in pitch, ever so slightly, “shout at me all you want, Sherlock, but rest assured that when the time is right, we will strike. You will get your John.”
“You’ve got this
“I’m sorry, John. I’ll say it as many times as you like, in as many ways as you like. I’m…sorry for everything, for all of this. For so much…”
A short chappie, but I hope you like it!!!!
“I really wouldn’t know Brandy, they’re rare; rarer than my gender, after all. Even as a doctor, even in the military I never met one. They keep to their own. It’s true most of them are members of royalty or aristocracy, old families that are bred specifically to pass on the apex Alpha line. Genetic perfection, they say.” John shrugged his shoulders listlessly. He never liked discussing gender, any gender.
And then he saw it - he saw it bobbing gently, looking so nondescript and innocuous that he was certain it was far from being so.
“Believe me, sir; no one wants this to succeed more than myself.”
John laughed out loud, long and hard. He didn’t know why, but he found this entire situation to very, very amusing. No, John had not let the mobile die, but he hadn’t had it turned on much since he had it either. He didn’t really see the point, as he hadn’t made up his mind to help the apex Alpha in his investigation or not. But, considering the information that had just come to light, John figured he

Mycroft waited, ever so patiently, the blunt tip of his umbrella resting on the wooden floor. This supposed “Doctor” Watson was to come through the door of Dr. Barrymore’s office any moment now, and if he was a God-fearing man, he’d arrive with a damn good reason why his baby brother’s initial implantation failed.
“Okay John.” Marcus lifted his head and nosed the air a bit, questioningly.  Then, he silently came to some kind of decision and shambled away, slowly putting one foot in front of another, plodding towards their next meal; whatever it happened to be. John found he rather like playing the ‘What’s Marcus going to bring us to eat?’ game, and even though that one time was a disaster, the quiet man was practical more often than not. He was sure that at this point, both of them would be ridiculously unattractive animate skeletons if not for his administrations. Although he had to admit that while they both towed the line, they weren’t quite emaciated yet.
help you.”
Sherlock whipped his head around, his coat and long legs turning just as quickly afterwards. If his calculations were correct (and they almost always were), the shooter would’ve had to have been standing right…
The quality was poor, the colour washed out and grainy, but the audio seemed to be perfectly intact.
“Please John…”
POLICE: Vertex Omegas.
…for heaven’s sake…we need you.” The brunette didn’t elaborate, but John knew that it wasn’t the royal ‘we’ to which he was referring. Apparently, if he made his bed with Sherlock Holmes, he better make sure the duvet was warm enough for Mycroft Holmes as well. God, what a thought!
Her voice had an edge to it now, something too sweet and cheery to be sincere. Sherlock made some kind of noise, a noncommittal grunt or something, as if he would rather be doing anything else but nothing else came to mind. He found this attitude of laziness and noncompliance to be particularly maddening to those who sought to control him (Mycroft especially) – most of the time they had no idea what was
“Actually, I don’t believe I’ve had the pleasure.”
“We…Sophie and I, we didn’t handle it well. We thought she was okay, we had taken her to therapists, she seemed better after that and happy to be graduating and going to Uni to be a Gender Rights Barrister. We just – we didn’t –”
“Get into the car, John,” the taller man with the strangely high voice offered, waving his hand towards the black saloon, “make this easier on all of us now, there’s a good lad.”
“You’re staying here John. I’ll not have you sleeping in that
So, he was to be humiliated again was he? Well, it wasn’t like he didn’t know it was coming…and honestly, better Mycroft then Sherlock.
“I-I didn’t think you’d be here, I wanted to tell you - it’s just for a little while. I’m sorry.”
John Watson was free, and now he was armed.
He decided to explore the eighth floor anyway, cane tapping a sad little tattoo on the floor as he entered the lift. No one else seemed to notice. John waited as the elevator slowly filled with various couriers, business persons, and building personnel he supposed frequented the high-rise.  There were 20 or so floors, and the row of shiny buttons inside the lift lit up like glassy fairy lights.

Sherlock stepped behind the chair, placing both hands on John’s shoulder and squeezed gently. A wash of calming Alpha pheromones accompanied the gesture, and John closed his eyes, inhaling deeply. It was love, it was support, and it was exactly what he needed. He smiled and forgot about his tea for moment, choosing instead to tilt his head upwards and smile ever so slightly.
John lightly rested his hands in his pockets; doing his best to appear to be nothing more than a rather stinky mild-mannered bearded man in his mid-thirties, and walked briskly into the alleyway. The adrenaline simmering below the surface on his skin began to peak in waves, coursing through his body, lessening the stimulus of pain and fear. His limp wasn’t nearly so bad now, but he hardly noticed.
Mycroft interjects, astonishment taking over his narrow, waspish face.  “I am not the one who has chased away possibly the best chance we have at catching these…these cretins, with your misguided attempts at recruitment!” He took a few steps forward, eyes narrowed dangerously. “Tell me Sherlock, what exactly is John going to think when he finds out about what that
Sherlock gripped John’s hand, offering comfort and understanding freely, and John was struck by how much Sherlock had changed, how much his entire world had changed.
blooms in his abdomen, and he feels badly that he cannot help. He helps so many already, and really what could he possibly do? Yes, he may be ex-military and a physician, but he doesn’t hold a candle to an apex Alpha detective and his brother, the British government (allegedly).
With a flip of his hand, he booted up his laptop and clicked on the icon marked SB-M.
So, can I just say, wow??? When I first started this fic, I thought for sure a few people would like it and then that would be it! But the response has been AMAZING!!! I LOVE YOU ALL!
Sherlock studied John’s rather expressive face as it ran through the gamut of emotional reactions to the photos.
She pursed her thin lips, re-straightening her mussy braid over her shoulder and plopping down several wrinkled sheets of paper down in front of the rumpled and stroppy apex Alpha.
Sherlock opened his eyes, only just now aware they’d been closed. The scents around him muted, dulled, drifted away and settled into a comfortable miasma of the unimportant. John did that for him now. John reminded him of his boundaries and reeled him in when he was wont to push himself too far.
POLICE: I remind you to be clear in your statements, this way there can be little to no confusion or misunderstandings.
It was more difficult to wake up this morning, but then again, it was difficult to do most things nowadays. The chill of the frozen dirt beneath his makeshift bed seeped through his threadbare clothing to settle deeply into his bones. He had only slept fitfully the night before, the ache in his shoulder becoming more and more uncomfortable as the temperature dropped. Finally, he gave it up as a lost cause and simply rolled over onto his right side (much to the dismay of his hip), and watched the foggy London night play out its nightly dramas and heartbreak. He wished, just once, that he could manage a good night’s sleep. He had served his Queen and country dammit, for all the good it did him, didn’t he deserve one blessed dreamless bit of respite?

to contact Sherlock now. He still wasn’t sure if he was willing to become a human sacrifice in the name of science and the British government, but if he could help the investigation he would.
“As you can see there,” The man nodded, one errant curl dislodged and flirting with the edge of a piercingly vivid eye, “…the name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have a proposition for you Doctor Watson.”
John had only been scented a few times in his life (not counting his rather unfortunate run in with an overprotective and hormonally crazed Marcus), and it was usually a highly volatile, lust or rage-filled affair that found John barely able to speak or move in his own defence. Scenting wasn’t always about sex, sometimes it was about obedience, domination, or possession. The only Alphas that had ever been close to John had muscled their way into his personal space, unknowing or uncaring of how genuinely terrifying it was to be held down and drooled on like a slab of meat amongst a pack of starving wolves. For this reason, John had never been with an Alpha, only Betas, and Betas did not scent.
John himself was little more than worse for wear. Both men lay groaning on the ground, coughing and retching into the slimy paving stones that lined most alleyways in this part of the city.
All of this aside, the most gruesome feature of the body (as if the body alone wasn’t disturbing enough) was the large, deep, clotted hole in between his eyes. It had its own strange shine to it, like the Omega’s head was full of rare uncut rubies instead of brain matter and viscera.
“It could be.” A clear, smug voice rang out in the morgue, followed by the tell-tale
“But only a bit,” Sherlock really couldn’t leave it alone, much to John’s continuing amusement.
“Mr. Holmes?” John finally broke the silence before the growing tension became overwhelmingly uncomfortable.

Deep to his eyes, in the infinitesimal gaps between his neurons, ions and cations made the kamikaze jump between his synapses and shaped those electrical impulses into thoughts and sensory input.

It was a revelation, a force of nature, and only tempered by the rough pressure-sting of a savage bite that forcefully distracted John from his devastating orgasm and onto the back of John’s neck, wherein Sherlock had latched himself with dominant assurance, finally able to demonstrate and claim this Omega as his own.

He frowned heavily, a set of fine wrinkles appearing above his eyebrows. He certainly didn’t remember Jeremy locking the door. He thought he would have least heard a louder clicking noise, or the turn of tumblers, perhaps a key sliding in the keyhole – but, no, he didn’t remember hearing anything of that sort. His frown stayed, fixed onto his face as though settling in for the long winter.

“No, no…but, I think we need to find a new Guide donor. “
The man on other side brightened audibly. “Of course! I just need to take a few bits of information and schedule an initial consultation and we’ll be all set. Your full name, please?”
“Goodbye, Molly,” he ended the conversation as abruptly as it began, sliding into the darkened cab interior and simultaneously bringing up the text window on his mobile.
The door squeaked open behind him, heralding the appearance of another Beta male, probably in his late 30’s. He had mousy brown hair, weathered skin, and a smarmy sort of smile that set John’s teeth on edge.
He flattened his large tongue then, letting his pulse against John’s hole, which quivered and contracted with the attention, revealing long rivulets of fluid Sherlock knew was only for him. And Sherlock growled again, burying his face between John’s two generous cheeks, licking and sucking and

The paper shredder sat inconspicuously under her cheap pressed-wood desk, and she was glad she’d had the forethought to buy the expensive type that cut the paper into little dainty diamonds. It swiftly reduced the mounds of folders and records into delicate little bits, like snowflakes, that slowly drifted into the collection container. It’d take positively
John shook his head as forcefully as the pain at his temples would allow.

She opened the door wide, letting him through with a wide smile on her lips.
A very pregnant pause, then, “I told him you didn’t belong to him.”
“Good. You are one of the newest members of my company, and as such I would hate to have you disciplined more than is necessary.” Sholto walked around behind the desk and placed both hands down on its cluttered surface. Then he leaned forward slightly, taking in John’s presence in a quiet but thorough manner.
When he allowed the overwhelming emotional impact of Marcus’ death to finally wash over his psyche, it was paralyzing. The Alpha had never been perfect (permanently injured as he was), he had never tried to
When Mycroft Holmes called his personal mobile early in the morning, John was annoyed, but willing to let it pass. When said civil servant appeared, uninvited, that afternoon at the Serenity Cottage annex where John kept his offices, he couldn't find it within himself to be gracious.
”Well, thanks for that.” John folded the paper back into its squares with a huff, shoving it into Sherlock’s chest firmly. “Since we’re all idiots I guess you manage on your own then, yeah?”
He turned the brassy doorknob and let himself inside. The space was dark and cool, with plush carpeting that he had yet to see in any other room on this floor. Heavy brocade curtains blocked the light, and in the corner sat an elegant woman behind yet another large desk.
“It’s not a trick, which you’d realize if you’d for once open your eyes and observe the world around you. Look,” Sherlock ran his gaze back over the body, stepping towards the lifeless man, “look at how he fell, legs twisted and arm out to the side. That alone should give you a clue as to how he died. Look at the bag and how
“I thought so,” the officer sat down slowly in his chair, flattening the vinyl cushion slightly, causing it to squeak in a most unserious manner, “the others aren’t saying much, trying to protect their own I’d say. Do

“Why don’t you enlighten me?”
“Well, that’s done then. Tomorrow at two o’clock, anything else?” He raised a questioning glance to the brothers, who managed to look both relieved and ridiculously uptight at the same time.
In truth, he had grown quite tired of all this unnecessary emotional upheaval and drama. He tired of fielding frantic phone calls from Mummy, who managed to sound grievously distressed, victimized, and horridly condescending all at the same time. It was more than clear why Sherlock never seemed to take any familial sentiment at face value, since every other comment from their mother served two purposes - insult
Another sip of coffee, and another grimace at its shallow depths – something was definitely off about the flavour this time.
Then the man’s hand began to pump, up and down, slowly at first, using John’s own slick to ease the way. Again, John could not help but thrust his hips helplessly forward and back, even while his mouth remained locked in devotion to his mysterious companion. It wasn’t going to take long. John had never been assaulted like this, on every front, robbed of his sight but so very aware of every other sense. He was powerless and unable to fight the growing bubble of bright pleasure that bobbed inside his core. Just another few pulls, another few thrusts…and he would have his release. He would have this.
The camera wobbled a bit as the man speaking, Dr. Frankland apparently, took it into hand and the film panned across a sterile white room. The picture dimmed in and out for a quick moment, but finally focussed on a young woman strapped down to a slim cot. She had her face turned away from the camera, and only her long dark hair was visible. She was thin, extremely so, and seemed to tremble slightly, her soft blue scrub-like clothing sticking to her body in dark, sweaty splotches. Soft foam and velcro restraints fastened her wrists and ankles, making it quite certain she could not move from her cot. Intermittent moans wavered in and out from her general direction.
