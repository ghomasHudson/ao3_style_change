On their way home, John did a bit of what he was allowed to do: He drove them back to the flat, and Rosie was so excited to see him without the sling, she almost pitched a fit when they tried to leave her behind to do some food shopping.
“I think you might have forgotten the part where I did something insanely reckless and you were injured to the point that you had to suture yourself. I can see how that could be so easily forgotten.” Sherlock was suddenly angry. John was intrigued.
They fell asleep that way; Sherlock in John’s arms. When they awoke, their positions had shifted during the night. John was pressed to Sherlock’s back, his left arm across Sherlock’s belly. Their hands found each other even in sleep, their fingers weaved together.
. And he would be trapped in it for the majority of the next six to eight weeks. Sherlock managed to wrangle John and his newest appendage into a cab and back to their home. As Sherlock fiddled with the lock at the front door, John sighed.
“Apologies, John. I’ll keep my melancholic thoughts to myself and let myself ruminate on them while you’re having your surgery.” He actually harrumphed.
Sherlock stood, peeled off his gloves and pulled his phone from his pocket. He tapped at it for a few seconds and waited. John looked at him, completely perplexed. A few seconds later, he heard Rosie’s voice accompanied by Lestrade's. As the duo approached, a few members of Lestrade’s team moved in around the woman across the street and brought her to a panda car to be questioned.
“You need to ask yourself something: What has recently happened that would make John have such an about-face about something that hadn’t been an issue before today?”
“Molly! What a wonderful surprise! You didn’t have to bring anything!” John pushed himself off of his chair to meet Molly halfway across the room. He pressed a kiss to a cheek. Molly stepped back after pressing one to one of his in return.
“If we can’t work anymore after this… I’ll be sad about that. But not as sad as I would’ve been if I’d lost you tonight. That almost happened.”
“Hello, John!” Her eyes fell upon the sling: “You’re looking, oh my! That thing is rather cumbersome, isn’t it?”
to help celebrate their special day. As always, Sherlock had outdone himself. And John was going to thank him properly for all of his hard work.
“Do me a favour from here on, yeah? Do not be ashamed for saying what you want. Don’t cut into yourself like that. I can’t bear to see you do that anymore.”
With that, Sherlock reached underneath John’s pillow, retrieved their bottle of lubricant and then the aforementioned pillow. He sat up, reached for John’s hand and thrust the lube into John’s palm and then laid back and shoved the pillow under his hips and ass. He spread his legs, giving John a tremendous view of the shiny, glass dildo.
“You now. Off. Those trousers need to go. I’ve been wanting to see those legs of yours for so long. Lemme see them, Sherlock.” John stepped back to give Sherlock a bit of space. And plenty of time to change his mind.
John kissed his nose and stepped out of Sherlock’s embrace. “I’ll be out in a few ticks, okay?” And with that, he turned and headed for the loo.
“I need to see your face for a second, come here, love.” Sherlock did as he was beckoned. As John’s face swam into view, Sherlock could see that things were worse than he’d thought.
Sherlock began tapping at his phone. John glanced back and forth between them, praying Sherlock had another option to avoid a full-on wobbly. After a few seconds, and before she could fall head-first into a complete snit, Sherlock bellowed as he slid the pamphlet for the zoo into her immediate view:
“That, right there, is how I know you’ve been great. Because you’re you. And we’re us.” Sherlock collapsed on John then, giving in to finally being on the other side of the pressure he’d placed upon himself. The situation had turned a corner. A positive one.
“Oookaay!” she sing-songed her way up the stairs to hers and John’s bedroom. John’s outburst already forgotten.
“How is it that good all the time? Isn’t there supposed to be a drop-off in quality or something?” John laughed and kissed Sherlock's jugular notch, right between two of the leather straps.
“Bloody buggering fuck!!!” His right hand was curled in a tight fist, his knuckles turning white. But they weren’t nearly as pale as his face.
Sherlock tried to sit up, always trying to follow John wherever he went, but his body hadn’t quite caught up to his brain. As usual.
“Oh, John. That display back at the flat? That was a man who was trying to keep secret the fact that he’s bloody terrified. And he was absolutely horrid in his attempt.”
miraculous, Sherlock. We have been this whole time but weren't ready. But we are now. This? Us? It’s going to be tough, but we’ve proven to be tougher than just about everything that’s ever been thrown at us. We’ve got this.”
“I should hope so. I told him several years ago when I asked him to be best man at my wedding to Mary.”
John leant forward to let her do just that. During her short journey to Sherlock’s face, she decided she wanted to be held by her papa. Once the transfer was complete, she settled against Sherlock’s chest, her little arms around the back of his neck as she plastered a sloppy kiss to his mouth. He kissed her forehead and finally gave up the fight and let his tears go. Rosie was confused by the tears. She didn’t understand they were there because of bliss. John stood and watched his daughter’s godmother and his partner cry. Time to lighten the mood:
“I’ll never tire of you saying that word to me when using it to describe something I’ve done. My first choice for a word to describe what just transpired would be miraculous, but to each their own.”
“Johhhhnnnn! Oh my god! John!!!” John felt Sherlock's release against his stomach. He slowed his strokes inside Sherlock, guiding him through the white light of his vision to the other side. The clench of Sherlock around him and the sounds Sherlock were making post-ecstasy were pushing him over as well.
“Of course, family! Of course, us. You and me. You and Rosie and me. We’re a team, the three of us. A blogging doctor, a mad genius detective and a three-year-old that manages to repeat every bad word she hears.”
“Oh, Sherlock!” John pulled Sherlock to his chest and put his right arm around him. He gently swayed them back and forth for a few minutes as Sherlock tried to breathe.
“It’s all right, John. I wanted to check on you and see if you wanted something to eat.” He shuffled his feet as John blinked up at him.
He returned to the flat two hours later, which was earlier than I’d expected. I didn’t hear Rosamund’s lighter footsteps or her laughter. I was lying on my back across the length of our sofa, my right arm across my eyes and the fingertips of my left hand scratching across the carpet. I’d been deleting and reorganising my Mind Palace while I waited for John to return home. If John decided to grant me my last wish, I’d need all the available space I could locate in my Mind Palace.
So much for shy. Once he hit a certain level of arousal, most of his skittishness evaporated and was replaced by desire.
“Already are. Here.” Sherlock helped situate John onto his back and tucked a pillow to his shoulder to hold the cold pack in place. “There. You can fall asleep all you like. That pillow will hold it in place for you.”
Despite his nausea, he lunged for the treats and grimaced in spite of his enthusiasm. A large bite: “Oh! She is an absolute angel! We have to get something marvellous for Mrs. H to thank her for these and for watching Rosie! We don’t deserve her!” A few crumbs landed on his new brace.
Greg laughed at the absurdity of the picture their story painted. He gripped Rosie's hand and led her away from the scene so his consulting detectives could get to work. He was sure the version of events she was about to tell him would vary greatly from her parents’.
Sherlock swallowed hard enough that John heard it. “I’m waiting.” he sing-songed. That made Sherlock laugh. He poured a bit more lube onto his finger, rubbed his finger in three more circles and slowly pushed inside. John’s breath caught in his chest. “Holy. Holy shit. Oh. Sherlock. That feels so good. Keep going. There’s plenty of lube on your finger. Get me nice and wet for you, love.” Sherlock pushed forward and dragged his finger inside John’s snug heat. John writhed as Sherlock watched, making sure John didn’t strain his shoulder and that he himself wasn’t hurting him. After a few moments, John managed to speak:
Sherlock clamped his fingers around John’s wrist but took a few seconds to take John’s pulse as they stood there. Elevated. A bit more sweat shone on John’s forehead. A weariness to his face. His right shoulder pressed back, approximately twenty degrees behind his spine. Unconsciously trying to back away. It’s a good thing they’re in the bathroom, then.
“Yes. All right. Let me go into the kitchen and find something to put in the micro while we’re taking care of you. I’ll meet you back there in a few minutes.”
Sherlock stalked forward and pressed their chests together. His hands drifted down John’s back, then to his sides and then his hips. He lowered his head as his fingers slid between hot skin and elastic. “I love you, too,” he sighed into John’s ear. John’s hand made its way to the small of Sherlock’s back and it slipped inside at the top of Sherlock’s pants. He kissed Sherlock’s left pectoral muscle. And it was interpreted as the question it was made to be:
“Let me see if you’re ready for me. Gotta make this nice and smooth and slick for my husband. Don’t wanna do anything to hurt his beautiful body.”
“Correcting my grammar after I gave you that shag? You ungrateful nutter! Get over here, you sod! Sherlock launched himself into John’s embrace.
“I won’t be able to help with those buttons but I can watch you.” John’s tongue poked between his lips and he bit the lower one in anticipation, an incisor pulling and holding it between his teeth.
I felt like my face was giving the game away, but she’d taken me by such surprise, I couldn’t rebuff her in the slightest.
A spinal fracture. Caused by the impact and the seat belt. Thoracic vertebra T12 and Lumbar vertebrae L1 and L2. Swelling and impact trauma caused a temporary loss of bladder control. The numbness in John’s legs was caused by both the instability of John’s spine and the sciatic nerves in both sides of John’s body being compressed.
“You’re astonishing. Thank you for all of this. Thank you for not letting me wallow. Sometimes, I just want to be angry about this. There will be times when you won’t be able to pull me from the bottom of this. But tonight, the pep talk, the therapy, the offer to talk about how to handle Rosie when she asks about her mother: You keep me right, too, you know. You always have, but I never told you that before. Going forward, I won't make that mistake anymore."
“It’s okay, Sherlock! Shhhhh now. We’re okay.” John kissed the top of Sherlock’s head and inhaled the smell of his hair.
“It should feel weird, this. But it doesn’t. It feels new, but not weird. This should be awkward, shouldn’t it? Me and you, sitting here like this? It just feels like we’ve been doing this for ten years instead of three weeks.”
“There’s so much wrong. But us? We’ve always felt right. Even when we wanted to throttle each other.” He raised an eyebrow at me. Evidently, John didn’t know that I occasionally wanted to strangle him.
Since John was feeling a bit better, he and Sherlock discussed and then decided to go on a family outing; one where John would be able to take a break and sit if he got tired. He was taking fewer naps these days, but the fatigue of his recovery often caught up with him at odd times. Usually in Tesco when he and Sherlock were halfway (or less) finished with their shopping.
It was John’s turn to blink. When Sherlock then decided to lick his sauce covered thumb, John shook his head like trying to clear an Etch A Sketch.
“Please stop ruminating, John. You’re being tedious.” Sherlock tried to maintain a bit of haughtiness, but his brain was still floating along with the oxytocin flowing through his veins. John exhaled the breath he’d drawn during the replay of the new memory. “The fact that someone I love was hurt tonight and I’m upset about it? That’s tedious?” John could feel Sherlock’s eyelashes tickling his breast.
John kept his left arm close to his side, and Sherlock gently tugged until he was left holding John’s coat.
!!!!!!” Sherlock immediately dropped John’s wrist and John tipped forward, his forehead against Sherlock’s belly.
“Since we’re both up right now and have nothing on for the rest of the evening, would you still like to take a shower tonight?” John turned to face Sherlock at the bottom of the stairs. Although Sherlock couldn’t look John in the eyes, the right side of his mouth and face quirked up into a smirk, clearly giving himself away. John was delighted.
“Just give me a sec, ‘k?” John stretched under the covers. Sherlock (again) tumbled to the fact that John was lying in his bed.
“You’ve been wonderful tonight. For me and for Rosie. If you have something else you’d rather be doing, I can take care of that on my own. Maybe watch a little telly before going to bed properly.”
“God, I love you.” John kissed Sherlock’s chin and got his right arm around his back and hugged him close. “You know, while the commercial was still playing, I glanced around the flat looking for you.”
He scrambled from his seat next to Rosie as John walked towards her. “My little sweetheart, you get up here with me and have a little dance, yeah?”
“I made an atheist yell out for god. I haven’t lost my stuff yet. Not bad for a fifty-two-year-old.” John managed between breaths.
“You’re being very nice right now. I could get used to it.” An extremely soft smile passed over John’s face, and it stayed there for the surprising response.
Their romantic coupling began as many in their life had thought it would: There was a case, a cornered suspect, and a poor decision was made when her liberty was threatened. When the suspect brandished and fired a pistol at the pair, Sherlock did as he has always done when John’s safety was in jeopardy: He stepped in danger’s line of sight. As he pushed John from the path of the weapon’s bullet, he was grazed by it, causing a small sliver of skin to be torn from his right earlobe. At the sight of it, John’s face immediately paled as his hands grazed all over Sherlock’s face and neck. He removed his own scarf and put it to Sherlock’s bleeding ear.
“I know you think I’m mad about The Work. But I’m not. I couldn’t care less about us not being able to do that anymore. I’m angry that these things keep happening to us. What did either of us do to deserve the rubbish life’s thrown at us?”
“Don’t let anyone tell you you’re not perfect, John. Especially that brain of yours. I’ve told you before that you’re an idiot. I’m the genius of the two of us. Listen to me and tell your inner voice to shut the hell up.”
Sherlock smiled at the compliment and rubbed his hand, with a bit of pressure, along John’s shoulder blade. He’s been making great strides with his therapy. According to his therapists, he’s meeting or exceeding all the normal expectations of his surgical recovery. Sherlock’s went to as many of John’s sessions as he’d been able. He watched the therapists and asked questions. They even showed him a few at home that he could help John with. This was John’s favourite:
“Our landlady? Mrs Hudson? The evening I met Sherlock at the flat to see it for the first time? She insinuated that we might not realise there was an additional bedroom upstairs.”
“Why would I want to do that? If Rosamund sees me, she’ll forget I wasn’t in the room with her all along and drag me to the couch to watch the rest of her film.”
“It’s Lestrade. He’s got something for us.” He looked at John with apprehension, but hope. They haven’t been to a live scene in over nine weeks.
“Keep Rosie in the bathroom! I need you in here for a minute!” The hairs on the back of John’s neck stood on end.
“You go, I go.” John settled against Sherlock’s sweaty back, not caring about the mess they’d just made of the bedding.
“A shame, that. You have wonderful hands, Sherlock. You have a very soft touch, when you want to.” John sighed as he finished off the last of that set of exercises.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Would it be all right if I took a bit to review and analyze some data that’s just flickered to life in my Mind Palace?”
John pressed his face against Sherlock’s chest, and Sherlock pushed his nose into John’s hair. After an exaggerated inhale from them both:
“You did everything quite right for me. I hope when I did that to you, it felt that way for you as well.”
John began to slide his thumb across and back on the nape of Sherlock’s neck; to soothe him, to relax him. It appeared they were about to have ‘a talk’.
“If you keep your hand on my shoulder blade, I can. The heat from your hand is helping.” John is at home, lying on his belly, his left arm hanging off the side of the bed. Sherlock is kneeling on the floor, his right hand supporting John’s left shoulder blade.
“If you move from inside of me right now, I’ll never forgive you. What I need, is a kiss. Get down here this instant. Let me get my legs around you. If you can, get your arms under me and we can hold each other while we do this, yeah?”
“I will never hesitate to protect you. Why are you surprised?” His tone was very matter-of-fact with a touch of annoyance.
Nine hours later, John awoke lying on his back with most of Sherlock draped across him, his back resting against the right side of John’s chest and between his right arm and side. He was snoring. The sun was beginning its morning ascent and John could see the room turning pink and orange. A song came to him then, and as he held Sherlock, and watched the sunrise over the pale walls of their bedroom, he smiled and hummed himself back to sleep.
“I’m sure Molly put the specimens in an appropriate container, John.” He had the nerve to be condescending.
Sherlock moved a bit and caught John’s eyes. “Can we change positions a bit? I need more of you inside me. Please? “
"You spooned me every night and let me lie against you, you holding me in place so I could lie as close to being on my left side as that bloody sling would allow. You did that for six weeks, Sherlock. You held me still for six weeks so I wouldn’t hurt myself and so I could sleep better."
“As soon as I said I want to be the man she thought I was, she told me to get the hell on with it, and then she vanished. And then you know the rest. Big, sloppy tears and a bit of snot. Sorry about your shirt, by the way.”
“You stay, I stay.” Sherlock managed to verbalise his thought before falling asleep in John’s arms. As always, John was right behind him.
“John? Are you all right?” If anyone was more worried about John’s outburst, it was Sherlock Holmes. He was right behind John and almost stepped on his heels due to John’s sudden and unexpected stop at their front door. Rosie stood in front of her father and godfather in confusion; her head moving side to side waiting for someone to clear up the situation for her before she began to get upset.
“You smell nice because you’re you. You smell like John.” Sherlock kissed his hair. John pressed himself in closer, tightening his arms around Sherlock as well as his shoulder would allow.
“Are you ready to go home, Watson?” Sherlock asked as he took the hand Greg had been holding in his.
“I think it’s because we love each other so much. It’s like this when we switch. I love you inside me. No better feeling in the world, if I’m honest. The only thing close is when we’re like this. As long as we’re together, this, this is always going to be great.”
“John. Hello. Oh. Ew.” John felt Sherlock’s large hand drag across his hair. “Apologies. I appear to have unintentionally sprayed nasal mucus into your hair.”
“She was. Until he came back. Everything seemed so great. I had Mary, I’d gotten Sherlock back. I found out I was going to be a father. I should’ve known better.’
For the following three days of his recovery, he laid about on the sofa, watched telly, and became frustrated with his situation. It seemed to him, that every task he tried to attempt was more laborious than the one previous. There were even more things that he and Sherlock didn’t think of that were to prove themselves difficult or impossible. John was able to perform a few of the easier tasks around the flat when he realised he was able to slide his arm forward in the sling to free his fingers to help him hold onto things. Mainly Rosie.
“I would love that.” We sat in silence for close to ten minutes; my arm around John’s shoulder, and his hair against my neck. John pushed his face against my bicep and nuzzled me before he spoke again.
“Christ. I can’t believe anyone who’s met you believes that bollocks of you being a sociopath.” John clambered to his knees and put his arms around Sherlock’s back; his soft hair back under his jaw. Sherlock let himself be held and lost a bit of his bluster at the sudden contact of their naked bodies.
“Of all the places I’ve been, all the beauty this planet has on offer, you are still the loveliest thing my eyes have ever seen.”
I thought maybe it was time to talk. “John, did you see me while I was away? Like you’re seeing Mary?”
“This happened!” John held his hand in the air above his head and frantically shook it about. “I’m an idiot. I’m busy telling you to get out of here, and I’m so stupid, I start picking at the glass instead of just getting the broom as I’d said. Shit! That’s in there pretty good!” He brought his hand back down to chest level and winced as he watched the blood ooze around the protrusion and begin to drip onto his wrist.
John flipped to his back, his feet by his pillows, as he waited for Sherlock to spin the lid off of the vitamin E cream. Sherlock helped him work his arm out of his sweatshirt to expose his shoulder. It was time to moisturise and loosen the scar tissue. Sherlock dabbed his finger in the jar and rubbed the cream into all six of John’s incisions. John tried, but failed, to contain the moans that escaped his mouth. Sherlock’s warm, strong hand, massaged the lotion into John’s still traumatised surgical area. Sherlock paid particular attention to the three scars at the front of John’s shoulder and the pectoral/deltoid area. During his procedure, John’s surgeon had to spend extra time repairing his completely torn labrum. The muscular damage from the procedure to that area was rather extensive. The scar tissue and continued inflammation there could still be felt by his therapists eight weeks post-surgery.
Sherlock woke first. He’s been unconscious for only a few minutes. A bump on the head and a cut to his brow. An icepack and a plaster. John, on the other hand, caught the worst of their accident. The bus was lying on his side of the vehicle and had severely pushed in the driver’s side of the car.
He was able to manoeuvre John into the flat and guided him to, and down onto, the sofa. Tea would help. That’s tea’s main job. He busied himself in the kitchen, filling and starting the kettle, and rummaging around for the scones Mrs. Hudson made for John’s return from the hospital.
They just stared into the other’s eyes. “You can kiss me, you know. No need for shyness. Your dick is pressing into my belly. I think we’re past all that.”
“I think you’re ready, John. There’s little to no danger involved. You don’t have to worry about a chase or a scuffle. Just you and me and what we do best.”
Sherlock leapt from his chair and stumbled into the sitting room as his chair tumbled over to the floor behind him. He was skidding on his knees as he slid to John’s side.
They’ve not yet passed ‘second base’ in that time, but that’s further than Sherlock’s ever been in his life. John had wanted to keep things slow. Still does. But despite wanting to wait for ‘the good stuff’ to happen when he was feeling up for it, it was becoming more difficult with every second he was around his genius. His. What a lofty thing.
“That was the first time you told the man you loved him? In the same sentence when you were asking him to help you get married?”
I nearly choked on my sandwich. I patted my chest with gusto to try to dislodge the chunk of sandwich from my windpipe. “He doesn’t hate you.” I spluttered.
John felt the head of Sherlock’s cock press against him. He inhaled a long breath, and Sherlock deduced what he was doing. Of course he did. Sherlock pushed inside as John exhaled and he whined. It was a lovely sound.
“I’m gonna get yoooouuuu!” John cooed, as he chased Rosie around the sitting room on his knees. As she toddled around, she giggled and shouted, “Daddy silly!”
Sherlock stayed in the loo for fifteen minutes until he felt comfortable enough to go into the bedroom. True to his word, John was already in bed. He glanced over to the night table to John’s right, and saw a bottle of lubricant, a package of Rosie’s nappy wipes, and a box of tissues. Sherlock stood and stared at the items while draped in his burgundy dressing gown.
At that moment, their suspect, Madeline Tennant, sped from an alley and t-boned their car’s passenger side.
John craned his neck to see as much of Sherlock as he could. “I’m in your arms, naked, in our shower. This has already been fantastic. Anything else that happens is ice cream on top of a brownie. Enough small talk, let’s get to it then. I’m recovering from surgery and I need to be comforted by my partner.”
“I would enjoy having you anytime you would like to be had.” Sherlock pushed his bum against John’s crotch, emphasising a point of his own.
“I think I’ve always wanted that with you. But you’ve always tried to say you weren’t like that; you didn’t do things like that. You putting me off didn’t really work, you know. Just because you turned the extinguisher on me doesn’t mean you got all the fire, Sherlock. I’ve been smouldering for you for a very long time. I’ve been interested in you, in that way, since I first saw you. I admit, I didn’t make my feelings for you very clear. In fact, I made them quite the opposite of what I’m trying to do right now.”
“No. Don’t do that. Look at me, please.” John sat back a bit to look at Sherlock’s face. John lifted Sherlock’s chin and waited until their gaze connected.
Sherlock reached tentatively for John’s wrist, his long fingers wrapping loosely around the knobby bones there. John returned the gesture but had a tighter grip around Sherlock’s right wrist. “You need to really have a good hold of me here, Sherlock. This isn’t a halfway type of thing.”
“I’ve never had this before I met you. The way your eyebrow raises when I’ve said something that surprises you. The smile and eye roll when I say just what you’ve expected. I’ve never been known, cared enough about, to incite a reaction. You’ve never been indifferent, always perceptive and aware of me. Like no one has ever been before or since I met you.
“I am reliably informed that you are part of my family, and I’ll not have you talking of me in that way. You may, however, speak as ill of Mycroft as you please.”
While Rosie ate, and managed to actually get most of her food in her mouth, Sherlock helped himself to a slice of lasagne and a few covertly obtained forkfuls of her applesauce. He did the washing up and then arranged a plate for John and reheated a bit of leftover mixed vegetables for him.
I released him from my embrace and raised my cheek from his hair. He lifted his head from my chest. “This,” I nodded and then waved my hands around ourselves, “was a wonderful start.” I smiled at him as best as I could. We were both a bit wobbly.
“All tied up like a gift for me. Oh, sweetheart. You’ve got yourself all ready for me, too. You look lovely.”
I inhaled a fortifying breath: “We are both guilty of doing some pretty abhorrent things to one another. I made you watch me step off of a building and die in front of your eyes. If anyone in this room deserves to never be forgiven for their transgressions, it would certainly be me.”
“Mrs. Hudson has things under control downstairs. She's going to bring her up here to see us around six tonight. We can all have dinner, I can bathe her and get her to bed. That way, she’s here with us for a bit in the evening, can sleep here and have breakfast with us in the morning before we take her downstairs around ten. Everyone wins. I get to take care of you without having her underfoot, and you can sleep whenever the urge overtakes you.”
“I know that. You’re the one arguing the point. I offered to assist you. Instead of having your self-worth debate internally, you’ve chosen to voice it out loud.”
As usual, Sherlock basked in John’s words of praise. Not only was John able to worship him verbally, but his body was also now able to as well.  Sherlock laid there, and put his left arm behind his neck, fluffed his sweaty hair and struck a pose. John laughed at the spectacle.
As it turns out, I didn’t even have to say anything. There was a reason why she reminded me so much of him.
They made their way to their bedrooms. Sherlock and John had a peek at Rosie before retiring. They brushed their teeth side-by-side and changed into pyjamas and crawled into bed and laid together, face-to-face, under the bedclothes.
John’s hand froze, Sherlock’s nape curl winding halfway around John’s thumb, much like his legs had done around John’s hips a short time ago.
“Yes, John. I am. I bumped my head and I think I might be bleeding a bit. Something feels sticky on my forehead. Otherwise, I’m fine.”
“I wish I’d have thought of it myself.” They settled together after that, a decision reached. The silvery-gold moon painted the room in peace.
“You have a child!” Thankfully, Rosie was still downstairs with Mrs Hudson, as they returned from their case very late in the evening and didn’t want to disturb her or their landlady.
Rosie clung to one of Molly's legs and squeezed. “Ma-whee! Come pway!” Sherlock came back into the room and collected the pastries bag and set it on the kitchen table and then rejoined everyone in the sitting room.
“There, now. How’s that feel?” John breathed the words into his ear and then kissed his left shoulder as he pressed further inside Sherlock.
John looked confused. “I don’t think I do. I’m not really sure.” It was then that John gagged. He dropped his chopsticks on the table and brought his right hand to his mouth and pressed against it. Sherlock let go of John’s left hand as John raced to the bathroom. Sherlock was right behind him as John fell to his knees in front of the toilet and forcefully vomited up his dinner. Sherlock placed a hand on John’s back, slowly rubbing in comforting circles.
“I was such a bastard. Practically yelling to anyone who could hear me. ‘I’m not his date!’ I did that twice. I am so sorry for that.” Regret suffused every word.
“I think detecting might be the second best thing we do together. You have been present for all of our sexual encounters, have you not?” Sherlock could only laugh at that, thankful that Rosie wouldn’t be able to understand what they were talking about. At least for another year or so.
“I have the bite marks under my jaw and across my chest to prove you were there. I can’t wait for someone to see them.”
Sherlock snapped his neck towards John’s voice and tilted it as he turned. He reached for John’s injured hand and slapped John’s left hand away and undid John’s wrapping job so he could see the injury with his own eyes.
“Don’t be obvious, but would you mind looking across the street? A young woman, light hair, jeans, tight jumper, open coat. She’s been here since we arrived. Hasn’t moved from the spot."
“You sleep a bit now and I’ll wake you in a few hours, see how you’re doing.” He held the bag with his left hand, his right hand in John’s hair. It was so soft. John’s hair was a comfort to Sherlock all of the time, but especially right now. Caring for someone else has not been Sherlock's forte for most of his life. He was trying to be better.
John and Sherlock received the news a short time after John regained consciousness. They stabilised him, got him into a room, and Sherlock was there waiting to see him while the nursing staffed fussed with his IV and got his pain medications sorted.
John was given his surgeon’s first surgery of the day, at 07:30. Despite the early hour, he’d already been admitted and was lying on a narrow (and not very comfortable) hospital bed; an IV cannula was inserted and taped down on the top of his right hand. A pulse oximeter was clipped to his right index finger. The patient information, and allergy bracelets hung loosely around John’s right wrist. About thirty minutes ago, a nurse hooked him up to all the necessary machines, which included getting him wired up to a heart monitor. They attached compression pump stockings to his calves and ankles and also put a soft pair of yellow anti-skid socks over the stockings. If someone walked in the room not knowing any better, it would appear to be a serious situation facing the room’s occupants. But Sherlock didn’t seem to realise that the situation wasn’t nearly as severe as his emotions were leading him to believe.
“Just lean back against me. I’ve got you.” Sherlock’s hand continued its downward journey until he reached John’s half-hard cock. After a few delicate sweeps of his palm, Sherlock got to work. He let his fingertips dance across John’s belly, then back down to John’s prick. John’s right arm twisted itself until he was able to get his hand back on Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock nipped and licked and kissed John’s neck as his hand continued to wrap and squeeze around John’s cock.
Sherlock’s demeanour immediately softened at the sight. He reached for John’s hands and took them in his own.
“She’d flip-flopped on her opinion of him for decades. Every day, it could be something different. For the better part of my life, she rarely had anything nice to say to me about him. Most of it was telling me how he treated her abominably. She wouldn’t leave. No matter how bad it got. No matter how many times I told her she didn’t deserve to be treated the way he treated her. All I ever wanted was for her to have a happy, peaceful life.”
John spent the first thirty-six hours waiting for the nerve block to wear off. He waited and stared at his arm as it lagged in its sling, useless and droopy. He willed his fingers to wiggle, but it was no use. Medical science was a marvel. Until it wasn’t. The burning and painful tingling receded over the course of a few hours, but then the pain from his six incisions roared to the forefront. Sherlock set a timer on his phone and gave John his Co-Dydramol every four hours. Sherlock was never further away than the kitchen. At a few points, John wanted to be left alone, to suffer in silence, and not worry Sherlock. Knowing Sherlock the way he did, John should’ve known better. Sherlock just spent the hours they were apart listening with a keen ear for a moment when he could sense John would need him. He was right every time.
“If you need anything, Rosamund, I’ll be down the hallway looking in on your father.” She nodded but didn’t seem to really hear what he said. He figured he had about fifteen minutes before she was seeking him out. She usually wanted company while she watched telly.
“Sweet Christ, you feel good against me, Sherlock.” Sherlock’s length was pressed against the small of his back. He reached his right arm back towards Sherlock and settled his hand at the place where arse meets thigh. John turned his head a bit and placed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. “Let me look at you for a moment, all right? I want to see you, properly.” Sherlock nodded his head against John’s shoulder and John slipped out from under him and spun around. He stepped back further under the spray and gave Sherlock a gentle push and he took the hint and stepped back.
“More than.” Sherlock pushed his neck back a bit and looked down at John’s face. Half of his mouth was curved into a smile.
Sherlock did as John said. After a few chaste presses of lips, John traced Sherlock’s bottom lip with his tongue. Sherlock bucked against him. John’s left hand went to Sherlock’s lower back and slid back and forth, helping him to further relax. John continued the kiss, but began to nip and his lips. The flood of sensations were very new to Sherlock, and he began to rut against John’s stomach. By this point, John was already hard, but he wanted to make sure Sherlock was loosened up enough to proceed.
“If you were surprised I was still here when you woke up, you better get used to it. I’ll be here every night and every morning that you’ll have me.” Another kiss was placed on Sherlock’s neck, but this time, there was a nip added to punctuate his point.
He reemerged to the sitting room twelve minutes later to find John, glassy eyed, holding chopsticks in his hand with no noodles attached.
“I don’t need you to feed me, Sherlock.” John’s lips became a straight line. Sort of like the emoji he sends to Sherlock when he disapproves of one of Sherlock’s life choices.
to naked, save for his crooked pants, which rested on his bony left hip. Legs for a mile. What a lucky bastard he was.
“I am definitely okay with waiting until later.” His breathing was laboured and was escaping him in forceful puffs.
John got back to his side and settled the tip of his cock against Sherlock’s hole, the heat of his body becoming irresistible.
“Do do do do. Hm hm hm hm hm hm. It’s all right.” In between the words he was singing and humming, Sherlock could also here John puttering about; getting the mugs down from the cupboard. The utensil drawer opened, a jostling of metal. A spoon for Sherlock’s sugar. The drawer was closed more gently than it was used to. He tried to place the song John was crooning. After several seconds of replaying the sounds he’d heard John make, he had his ‘Aha!’ moment.
John’s surprise pushed him further back against the raised bed. "Sometimes, we're chalk and cheese; most times, we're tea and biscuits. But I mean it. You mean too much to me to have an argument about something that two months from now will be moot. ‘We’ mean to much to me. Things are going to be tense enough, without me having a tantrum. Just tell me to pipe down and leave you to it. Whatever ‘it’ may turn out to be.”
“You both are. Is it okay if I call Sherlock that once in a while, Rose? I love him very much. Just like I love you.”
Sherlock opened his eyes, and took a big, shaky breath through his nose and exhaled it through his mouth. “That’s great. Keep doing that.” John continued the slide of his hand along Sherlock’s right thigh, occasionally scratching his nails softly against Sherlock’s soft skin, as Sherlock continued to do his breathing. Once Sherlock calmed enough to speak, John asked:
“Just a bump. Lemme get the ice on it here and you keep an eye on me for concussion symptoms, okay?” He turned to face his daughter.
“Christ, what does all of that even mean?” Sherlock was next to John on the bed. (Thank you, Mycroft, for the single occupant room.) John was combing his right hand through Sherlock’s hair. He pushed his forehead against John’s neck. John moved his hand from Sherlock’s hair and moved his arm around him instead.
She should be a detective. She can practically read my mind. “No worries. I can bring Rosie to my house and she and Hamish can hang out a bit. Maybe a sleepover if things go well with you and Sherlock.”
“She almost took him from both of you and Mycroft and Eurus. She almost took him from me! I wanted you both to know that it was her before I ask you a question. I want Sherlock to be her father. I want him to stand beside me and raise her. I would be honoured if you’d consider being her grandparents.”
John took two steps back from me. “Sherlock are you all right?” Even through his anguish, his doctorly instincts managed to surface.
“Don’t make me have someone pass you a note with ‘Do You Like Me’ and underneath, a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to circle and have it passed back to me.”
“Hello, Sherlock.” John felt so much love for him at that moment, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to conceal it.
“I’m a bit concerned at the amount of swelling I’m seeing here, John. Especially since we’ve iced the injury twice since it occurred. I think you might have underestimated the severity of your injury.”
Sherlock looked like he was going to levitate from their bed. John applied some more lube to his fingers and gently probed Sherlock’s loosened hole. John was just doing this to tease him a bit. The plug did a wonderful job of opening him up. Should he remove the straps? He looked down at Sherlock and decided from the look on his face, and the blush flushing his ivory skin, that he probably shouldn’t make him wait any longer.
“Daddy?” Rosie questioned, raising her head to search her father’s face. Her lower lip then protruded; worry crossing her three-year-old brow.
“SHIT!” she exclaimed with spite. John was helpless to stifle the laugh that roared it’s way past his mouth.
“I suppose.” Sherlock watched John as he pulled the plate of food to his lap. He looked back and forth at the plate, and the fork he held in his right hand. He sighed.
“You can learn a lot by watching porn on the internet. I hope I’m able to apply some of what I learned for you tonight.”
“I know! That’s why I do the things I do! Why I did the things I’ve done! I want you to be here! I want you to live!” Sherlock scrambled to sit as he wailed.
“I’m not CLUMSY, John.” The “How dare you?” was implied by the tone of Sherlock’s voice. That made John laugh.
Forty-five minutes later, Sherlock returned to the kitchen to find John sitting on his stool and watched him tie off the last stitch. He dragged another stool to his workspace and sat next to John.
“I should hope so. I wouldn’t want to say for sure since you’re not always the most observant person I’ve ever met.”
Rosie was too busy splashing in the bathtub to hear the panic in Sherlock’s voice. “Sure, Da! I’m not a baby. I’m eight-years-old!”
“I’ll talk you through it, but we should probably start dinner before we head back there, okay?” John’s beseeching tone was unmistakable.
“‘wacomb, Daddy!” She patted her palms against his cheeks and tugged at the hair hanging over his ears. Daddy. Daddy? Sherlock was dumbfounded. He looked over at John who’d seemingly forgotten about the flower.
Sherlock began to snap his hips as John’s cock began to weep from its tip. Sherlock was panting against John’s shoulder, no longer able to coordinate his mouth to kiss at John’s body.
Cara inhaled a long breath through her nose, appearing to be deciding on something. She exhaled it quickly through her mouth. “If I remind you so much of Sherlock, and you’re straight, why don’t you fancy me?”
“No, it’s not so bad. Just a bit sore. I'll just eat like an American for a bit and put my fork back in my left hand after using a knife until it feels better." John gave him an obvious wink. Sherlock’s mouth curved into a smile, despite the worry wrinkling his forehead and the sadness crinkling the soft spot between his eyebrows. John watched him flutter about the kitchen and attempted to guess what he thought had happened and what might yet be happening. There was a reason why Sherlock was the detective and John was his Boswell.
“I’m going to take the less pessimistic route for one of the few times in my life and say that I am happy that this ever happened at all.” Sherlock sat back and kissed John’s forehead. John leaned back, his eyes looking a bit dazed. Fatigue was beginning to settle in his bones.
John unseated himself, Sherlock’s cock slipping from his heat. Sherlock was on his back, John astride his hips. Sherlock continued to thrust up, searching for the friction he’d had a moment ago. John put his hands on Sherlock’s thighs, tried to ground him enough to speak to him. He finally became aware of the different feelings his body was having.
“Rosamund’s bath was a success. Little to no damage to the area. I put her to bed. She even brushed her teeth without putting up much of a fuss.”
Sherlock nodded and pushed himself towards John who opened his arms. “Oh. That’s the stuff. Let me hold onto you for a little while okay?” John’s right hand went up and down Sherlock’s back as his left found its way to Sherlock’s hair. The hand on Sherlock’s backstopped on its trail, feeling the raised lines of Sherlock's scars. Luckily, Sherlock couldn’t see his face. That was something they definitely need to talk about. But not right now. This was not the time for what was sure to be a gut-wrenching conversation. They laid that way for a short time, John sensing Sherlock’s apprehension as soon as he’d stepped into the bedroom. Sherlock relaxed in his arms as he kissed John’s neck and cheek. John kissed his forehead and scratched tenderly across Sherlock’s scalp. They went on that way for a bit until John could feel Sherlock’s erection poking his belly.
The jury called them up about fifteen minutes later. Sherlock was standing close to the backstage, so he couldn't see the other half of the audience much. The jury was looking at them in silence for a long time, then one of them stood up and talked.
"I can't believe they really thought Mrs. Hudson was my grandma." Sherlock also laughed and shrugged his shoulders. "Well, there was no other way because you're sixteen," he reminded the blonde boy and John just laughed again. ,,Hopefully you won't get sick until you're eighteen, or they'll think we're related at the hospital." Sherlock shook his head with an annoyed expression. "I never get sick," he declared and John snorted.
Sherlock sang too for a little while and his boyfriend looked finally happy. They watched eachother, both ignoring others and just focusing on the song and the other one. The song really seemed to help the other couples do the same and the teachers looked satisfied too. In the end, it was a pretty good campfire.
Mrs. Hudson had to leave shortly after  scolding Sherlock for the fifth time and the room was quiet again. Then Sherlock spoke.
John slowly helped the weakened boy up the stairs and right in his bed. He brought some cold towel and gently covered Sherlock's forehead. "I'll make you some tea, ok?" The sick boy didn't even answer him, he was already asleep.
He didn't see Molly, Greg or those two idiots Donovan and Anderson for a long time. He didn't care. The only person he truly needed was Sherlock. He finally knew what he has to do. What could be more effective to lure that curious detective, whom he was still blindly in love with. John Watson wasn't stupid. Some poeple could even think he was just a bit less smart than Sherlock Holmes himself. Even though he didn't know the science of deduction and was always the heart from the two of them, he was intelligent. Also the deep desire of seeing those beautiful blue and green eyes, sharp cheekbones and curly dark hair, the desire of hearing his barytone voice again, propeled his mind forward.
As for Mr. Denver, he knew both of them and how it is better to let them do their own thing, instead of some stupid 'couple therapy'.
"Exactly, Mr. Watson. Your shouting isn't going to help Mr. Holmes either though," she said and seem satisified with John immediately calming down and looking towards the woods. "So, now, you other children please go back to your tents. Me, Mr. Walker, Mrs. Roberts and these three boys here are going to search for Mr. Holmes."
That was that. Sherlock was watching the game, while cheering silently in his own way, meanwhile the students on their seats were just screaming, mostly. John seemed to have the most attention, people loved him. Sherlock was the complete opposite of that. After all, who would love him?
Sherlock was nervous, since he was already dressed, while his boyfriend was nowhere to be seen. After half an hour of deciding, he opened the door to their bedroom and there he saw the blonde boy reading a book, still in his pyjamas.
The dark-haired detective's blank eyes were staring at the ceiling. Next to him, there lied a serial killer, which he would just yesterday refer to as his friend. Now Sherlock was terrified. For the first time in his life, he feared another person. ,,You begged, Sherlock," smiled John, cupping Sherlock's cheek. ,,You must've liked it, you begged me to continue." He petted Sherlock's hair and grinned.
It was the day of the rugby tournament and Sherlock felt quite uneasy. John would let him sit on the time-out bench, which was also part of the problem, but he didn't want to talk about it, as he promised his friend to cheer him on. He was happy to cheer for him, that's the only reason he wanted to watch the game, really, but John's rugby friends bothered him. He didn't interact with them for a long time, which was the worst thing. He felt like they were waiting for something big.
"You should be glad you have a bodyguard," sneered Tony after John left. "Yeah, John is way too good. How could he even like you?" joined Robert with his friend. Sherlock chuckled sarcastically. "What, do you have a crush on him or something?" It was probably effective because Tony laughed and punched his friend's shoulder and that was the end of that conversation.
That simple unsaid sentence is what put Sherlock back in the mood for competition. That and John smiling at him from his seat. The dark-haired boy apologized for panicking, introduced himself and then...danced.
,,Hands up!" the detective raised his voice and waited for the man to do something. He didn't move a muscle. Instead, he heard a loud laugh and Sherlock freezed. He knew that laugh too well. The man in front of him threw his flashlight against the wall and the whole tunnel lighted up thanks to that. Shocked Sherlock was standing face to face with his best friend. John Watson was standing there with bloody knife and a pile of bodies. John Watson was now looking at him with pure amusement and delight. It was like he just achieved something.
John's peaceful sleep was interrupted by a loud noise coming from the kitchen. He gave out a tired sound and stretched out his hand to search for Sherlock next to him. Of course, he was nowhere to be found. That woke him up completely, the blonde boy quickly sat up on the bed, looking around and trying to get used to the darkness.
John came before the ambulance and almost crashed five times on the way there. The weird thing was, that Sherlock's brother did stop him from going, but also gave him a spare key for the door and Sherlock's flat. The Holmes family really is weird.
They announced the third and second place, it wasn't him of course. He would lie if he said he wasn't dissapointed, but it was expected. Then, the jury said: "And the first place - truly a beautiful performance and by a young man, it was a very sweet surprise - Sherlock Holmes!"
"Sherlock, are you-" He wanted to ask if his boyfriend was alright, but upon checking he most certainly was and instead his rugby trophy wasn't, he let go of the taller boy's sleeve and just stared for a long time.
"John!" the blonde boy immidiately heard his friend's voice, when he entered their flat. Sherlock clinged to him, resting his forehead into John's shoulder. John huffed and laughed. "Damn, you are incredibly clingy today. What is it?" he ruffled Sherlock's hair and tried to walk, dragging the curly-haired boy with him.
,,John, you're not my mother," when he said that, John frowned and wanted to say something, but Sherlock stopped him. ,,I need to go. Please. I want to practise for the competition. It's this month," the curly-haired boy used his puppy eyes, knowing how much of a weapon they are.
,,I love you," John whispered in his ear and Sherlock shivered. A single tear streamed down his cheek.
"I'm really sorry, dude," Robert was not looking at John, but at Sherlock. "I didn't mean that. You are so annoying sometimes-" "Yes, I know. I have been told that many times," Sherlock sighed and looked over at John, who was now watching them in silence.
He sat like a ball of sadness in front of the detective's grave and again and again read the little words, that were carved into the cold stone; You were the best thing in my life. Love, John Watson. He was devastated. He should've said this to Sherlock himself, it wasn't supposed to be here. He repeated the words again and again in his head, tears slowly dripping from his eyes. How could this be true?
Sherlock almost got bored while watching the play, but when John got the ball, suddenly he couldn't keep his eyes from him. He looked really happy. Happier than when he was with him. He scored  of course. Sherlock turned his gaze back to the ground and gripped at John's sweatshirt next to him. He must be so boring for John, their personalities don't match at all.
When John's friends and team players finally let him to the ground, he ran to only person he really needed to display his happiness to.
The rest of the school trip was  fun and all the students actually enjoyed eachother in the end, coming back home in a good mood.
John took Sherlock's hand on the way and squeezed it. "Come on, you should try to put my shoes on at least," he said to him with a worried look. Sherlock shook his head in disagreement. "I'm going to get ill either way, but both of us ill would be annoying."  "At least we could sleep in the same bed," stated John and the taller boy laughed. "Shut up," he frowned slightly, but gently brushed over John's back of the hand. The blonde boy gave him a sweet smile and their conversation was over.
The tents occupants sat up and looked at their interrupters with confused faces. "What's...wrong?" John completely woke up first and now watched them with a worried expression. Did his boyfriend throw them out or something? Robert didn't wait another minute, grabbed John's arm and pulled. "Come out, John," Tony said instead of his friend. Their rugby captain sighed, shook his friend's hand away and silently got out of the tent, leaving the other two boys confusingly watching them.
When Sherlock Holmes faked his own death, he didn't expect the drastic impact it'll have on John. Of course he had expected some kind of a deeper reaction, he did seen his friend fall dead to the ground and Sherlock could even feel how John checked his pulse and didn't find him, thanks to the little white ball, hidden under his sleeve. For two whole years, the detective was tortured on a russian island called Sachalin, from where he almost couldn't escape. After two years, he was returning to London, where he recovered for a while.
"You look just the cutest," John pulled his friend onto his chest quickly, then went running again, because the break was over. After this, the other kids on the bench went completely quiet, just looking at Sherlock in amazement. You do not borrow 'the hoodie' to just anyone. Every rugby player knew that.
John was calling Sherlock and hanging up like ten times, they were all running around like idiots, joined by the teachers now, but they still had no luck. And in the worst timing possible, John's phone blacked out. He almosted smashed it against a tree, then quickly decided not to and put it in his pocket. He gave out and exasperated sigh and slided down the tree, lowering his head in defeat. He almost wished for Sherlock to show up and tell him this was just another one of his experiments. Robert and Tony and the teachers were watching him in silence.
He was used to his classmatess spurting out things like this, but this was just way too much for him. And the worst thing was the thought that John must've told them that. Why? Just why would he do that?
Except for music, there was complete silence in the audience and even if there wasn't, Sherlock wouldn't hear a thing, because he was concentrating that hard, that he could only hear the slow music and his ballet shoes, stomping on the ground.
,,Oh no. You will beg me to punish you more. Don't you worry about that, sweetie," and with those words he took the dark-haired man's hand and they walked out of the tunnel together. Sherlock didn't even fight back, he just stared at the man, that was holding his hand and wondered about him being real. Isn't he hallucinating, didn't he slid a needle in his arm without him knowing? No, this was real. And it was his own fault.
,,Look who's here. He finally came to check on me," the doctor laughed loudly again. He avoided the bodies and started walking closer to Sherlock. Even though the detective was the one with a gun, he slowly began to walk backwards. His hands were shaking. His body could no longer aim at John Watson. Sherlock dropped the gun. It fell down into a pool of blood, there was a loud splash.
"There's  this saying that idiots don't catch colds," he mumbled quietly and quickly got up from the sofa before Sherlock managed to kick him.
And that's where he got the idea for John's trophy. This trophy wasn't his, alone. It was also John's, because without him, he wouldn't even be here. Sherlock never really created anything, so the rugby ball he made was looking a bit weird. Hopefully John wouldn't care much.
“Johhhhhhhn. Please.” He didn’t have to say what he wanted; to John’s body, it sounded like; ‘Thank you. I love you. Come for me, please, John.’ John’s body already knew.
“Of course. I cooked it, fed you and your daughter. That serviette did nothing to reap such a reward.”
Sherlock reached across John and brought the lube between them, opened the cap and poured a bit onto his forefinger. John planted his feet and spread his legs for Sherlock. “Take one of those beautiful fingers of yours, and massage me a bit and then press inside when you think the muscle is relaxed enough, okay?”
Sherlock frowned and stepped into the tunnel. He didn't have anything to lose anymore. If this man kills him right here right now, he will at least know who's behind all these murders. He grabbed the gun from his coat pocket and pointed it directly at the man's back. Sherlock finally spoke.
Is their relationship really still so fragile? Does Sherlock think he's not the most important thing in the world to him right now? John slowly realized, how truly insecure his friend is.
"There's  nothing dangerous in these woods tho, is there?" asked Robert silently. John turned to him. "Shut up, just shut the hell up already, Rob! I'm never telling you two anything again! I thought you were my friends, not some sad bullies!" That  seemed to work. Both of the boys quieted down and just silently followed their friend after that.
"Sadly I know what you've told him, but why?! Why the hell would you tell him such lies! Your therapist now thinks I'm some adrenaline-junkie alcoholic! Why would you do that, Sherlock, why?!" he didn't even realise he was now shouting and the whole street was now watching them. That didn't bother John at all, as he was truly angry with his friend.
Sherlock finished, bowed down and without waiting for people's reaction, ran from the stage. The incredibly loud applause however, could be probably heard from anywhere near the building. Some people were teary-eyed, some where incredibly happy, two of them were mainly really proud. John wanted to get to Sherlock, his landlady stopped him though, pointing to the jury and saying they've almost decided the winner, so there's no time for now.
"You're Sherlock, aren't you? I'm John," said the blonde boy and Sherlock's eybrow shot up in surprise. "I know who you are. Did you come to punch me in the face?" he asked John in a exhausted way and the other boy frowned. "Of course not. What do you mean? I need you to help me with my homework. Come with me."
"Shut up. You're way too thin and I'm your friend, so I care about your health. I'll consult Mrs. Hudson about this."
The shorter boy sighed and shook his head. "You could try, you know. I'll try too," he looked really unwilling to try, but didn't notice how much of an open book he was. Sherlock laughed sarcastically. He would never try. He just has to either survive, or find a way out. That's how he always did it. He also never told John about the physical bullying, so he would never understand how he feels right now. If he told him now, he'd probably just think he wants to get out of it.
"I'm home," called the curly-haired boy from the door and went to search for his best friend. John was still sitting on the sofa with a cup of tea in his hands, but he was fully dressed now. He smiled at Sherlock and greeted him. The taller boy put away his bag and sat next to John.
Once he could see at least a little, he got up and almost ran to the kitchen, quickly putting on at least underwear on the way there. The light was on, so he covered his eyes first and proceed to continue by intuition. He grabbed Sherlock's sleeve, then finally put his arm down from his face.
"You're stuck with me forever, you know?" mumbled John into his boyfriend's shirt. The taller boy huffed.
The result was the most beautiful thing that most of the people've seen that day and because of that, they were watching the dancing boy in a complete silence. John's face was suprisingly one of the most amazed ones. He's seen Sherlock dance quite a few times already, but this was a completely different level of ballet. If Sherlock doesn't win, the winner has to be a complete dancing genius.
"John, I'm going to school with you today. And tomorrow. And basically I'm going back to school," said Sherlock, while sitting at the dining table with his friend, their feet just slightly touching.
John put the flowers next to Sherlock's prizes and hugged the boy so tightly it was almost difficult to breathe, then quickly picked him up like he weighted nothing and spun him around. Sherlock was laughing through the whole thing and wrapped his arms around John's neck.
In the afternoon, they worked with their assigned groups. It was a strength test and Sherlock felt that kind of malicious happiness when he saw that  John's group wasn't doing well. "Holmes, if you mess this up, you're sleeping outside," stated Tony and Sherlock rolled his eyes. As if he wanted to sleep.
." He became aware that his eyes were starting to burn, but then John shoved violently into that sweet spot and everything vacated his brain.
You reach for your mobile and type out a message, hitting Send before you're ready and tap out another one.
Sherlock moved so quickly, John had to jolt back to avoid a face full of the consulting detective. He positioned the cushions beneath the lithe body and eased Sherlock back down.
We break into the girl's apartment, and Sherlock immediately begins searching the place. I poke around a bit, but mostly just keep an ear listening for the police. I turn to watch the detective as I hear the fluttering of papers. He had found the victim's receipts—many,
Sherlock slips his hands up the expanse of John's chest, realizing he hasn't been granted with nearly as much skin to explore as John has. "You're wearing too many clothes," he complains.
I move carefully and gently until he has completely adjusted to the single digit before beginning to add a second. This time, he lets out a little muffled noise as I press in, but his hips move towards it instead of shying away. I scissor them slightly and his entire body shudders, a soft gasp escaping from the detective's usually slicing mouth. It's the first noise he's truly let out, all others cut off. When he reaches a fist towards his mouth, I stop him.
He's staring at me, both hands slightly moving against my thighs. Those eyes are heavy-lidded and dark, and he studies my face. Hair, forehead, brows, eyes, nose, down to the chin, back up to my mouth.
You're trembling from head to toe but it doesn't stop you from saying "Now you" and allowing him to teach you how to bring him release. He chants your name reverently until a final yell of
I roll out of bed and pad my way into the kitchen, putting the kettle on before making a trip to the bathroom. My stomach is still slightly sticky from the night before, so I grab a cloth and clean up the best I can before going back to the bedroom.
It hurt. It hurt so badly. But then it didn't, and it wasn't enough. He bucked his hips against John.
Languages meld together as words fall endlessly from his lips in quiet tones. French, Italian, and perhaps German, all the while my name—
The detective's eyes got impossibly wider, pupils slightly dilated. He looked...innocent. And completely out of his comfort zone. John had no idea what to do with that information.
He turns his face to me, and I can feel his eyelashes against my temple. Bracing myself on my hands, I push up and look down into the ghostly face. Something in my chest loosens to see clear eyes blinking back at me. Gone is the smothering shadow that had haunted them the day before.
So, yes, there are good ways and bad ways of waking up in the morning, results of which show throughout the day. Rolling out on the wrong side of the bed, out of tea, broken down car, lost house key.
The detective gasps as their cocks rub harshly together through their pants and pulls at John's jumper until the shorter man lifts his arms and allows himself to be defrocked.
I'm careful not to wake up the exhausted detective, but only a few minutes pass before I feel the fingers on my stomach lightly flex into my skin.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So danger was what brought them together in the first place. Fine. That doesn't mean it has to be the thing that
Then there was the day when he walked around London holding the skull (which we finally found in the bathroom cupboard, of all places) under his arm.
"There's a bit of a chill. Would you build a fire, Sherlock?" I call into the other room. I don't expect him to, but it's worth asking.
I slam my lips against his and push him back to the bed as I come, releasing into him, and my mouth muffles Sherlock's scream as he comes too, hard and messy between us. My knees are bent, straddling his hips again and I hold him as his body shudders and comes down from its high. He comes so hard that he lets out several more little cries and a few whimpers before its done and he rests there, exhausted and boneless.
"It has come to my attention that my brother has not been entirely himself lately," he states bluntly, gaze unwavering. "Have you any ideas as to the reason for this?"
gorgeous neck, and I brush my lips up to his ear before pressing hot, open-mouthed kisses along the perfect expanse of his throat. His hands flutter up my sides, fingers trembling and trying to find something to hold onto. I grab his good hand and push it against the wall beside his head, earning a grunt from the detective.
The sound twitched through his body to his nearly painful erection. He knew Sherlock (or himself for that matter) wouldn't last much longer.
I narrow my eyes at him. He's avoiding eye contact and his hands are fluttering about him like two birds trying to escape a cage.
" he says, voice nearly a soft whisper as he pulls me into his lap and crushes our mouths together again.
He starts whispering in the quiet room. He's apologizing, murmuring "I'm sorry" into my skin over and over again.
He blinks and the feral look is gone. Dropping my hand, he climbs out of my lap and retreats to his room with a silent
And then it's as if a curtain drops and John's expression shifts. Pain? Worry? Desperation? ...Longing?
I sit in my armchair, reading the day's paper while Sherlock lies on the couch, palms pressed together beneath his chin.
Minutes after Sherlock fled the scene, Lestrade arrived with an ambulance and I had been forced to endure the rest of the evening in A&E. It had been exhausting, and Sherlock hadn't even bothered to come with me. Despite some light pain medication, I hadn't been able to sleep well that night.
A little more determination leaked into Sherlock's face. His hand moved a little further up John's thigh, creeping slowly to dangerous territory. "I need to know what it's like with
Trembling lips have stopped words as they crush against mine in a bruising, desperate kiss. It's shocking.
I'm not embarrassed by it. Men who believe crying is a sign of weakness don't know how much of a release it is. I truly don't believe England will fall simply because my eyes leak a bit.
He wouldn't move first, though. No, this was John and he would take care of him. John always took care of him.
Pale, enigmatic eyes meet mine. He doesn't say anything immediately, but his face isn't closed off and I can read more than he verbalizes. It's like he's letting me read him before he even says a word. Something is bothering him. Obviously. It's not quite fear, more like extreme bewilderment. Like a puzzle he can't quite solve. Nothing dangerous, or I would (hopefully) know about it.
Putting my hands on his hips, I tug firmly until they press against mine. I push my leg between both of his and he lets out a strangled noise that twists through my body until I'm already half hard.
There is another long pause after that as I mull thoughts over in my head. "Are you afraid I'll leave?" I finally ask quietly.
A few minutes later, we're both propped up on pillows, sipping tea as the sunlight crawls further into the room. It climbs over our feet and up the bed until the room is flooded in all its golden beauty.
I let out an unimpressed chuckle and begin slowly putting pressure on each of his ribs, noting Sherlock's reaction to each.
John hands Sherlock the towel and the detective wraps himself the way a child would, not really doing anything to cover more...sensitive...areas, but keeping his shoulders and back warm.
I turn and study his profile. He lets me, continuing to make progress on his tea as I take in the slope of his nose, his highlighted cheekbones. He's unhurried, almost unconcerned whether there is a case or not. I know it won't last, and that's perfectly fine. I need a case just as much as he does, most times. It's what had brought us together in the first place, the work. I won't complain. (Much.)
let me know where you're going, Sherlock! You could just text!" John is still somehow retaining the ability to keep his voice minimally controlled.
Supporting Sherlock with one arm, John gently cleans them both before turning off the faucet and grabbing a couple of towels. He takes great pleasure in ruffling Sherlock's headful of curls until the dripping water is soaked into the cloth. That
"You have to relax," I sooth, rubbing my other hand against the outside of his thigh briefly. "Take a deep breath and let it out slowly."
brilliant." He smiles slightly, pushing a hand through your hair and lifting the fringe off your forehead. "And you know what? You were beautiful."
"I wish you wouldn't do that," he pants, tugging your hand away. "Mrs. Hudson isn't a prude." Because, sometimes, Doctor John Watson
—helps to fuel me with the strength to continue on the way I am. He's like a giant conductor of electricity, or a brightly burning star, and the people around him are the wilting flowers bursting back to life under his, however unintentional, care.
John is unbuttoning your trousers amidst the chuckles and you forget to be anxious. Instead, you wrap your arms around his shoulders and cling to him as you let your nervousness manifest itself in the laughter spilling from you. John is still smiling when he pushes down the fabric from your hips, taking the pants underneath along with the trousers. Your giggles are abruptly caught off with a quick intake of breath as his hand rests against your heated skin, curling his fingers until he's holding you in the palm of his hand. Your cock jumps and quivers beneath his touch as he slowly, slowly strokes you. The amount of heavy breathing you're doing is sure to make you hyperventilate at some point, but you can't stop.
he's writing on paper). His other hand rests on his knee, fingers tapping the rhythm to a tune only the detective can hear. I briefly wonder if he's composing subconsciously.
A cloth is shoved in front of my face before I can protest. Sherlock's cut off exclamation of my name is the last thing I hear before complete darkness sweeps me away.
I wonder briefly if he's fallen asleep like this, but his eyes are open, staring at the floor between his feet. And then he speaks.
Angelo refills our wine glasses, even though Sherlock hasn't touched his and I've only taken a sip of mine.
I kiss his clavicle through his t-shirt. Memories from the morning he woke up after sleeping against me by the fire are running through my mind. I made his brain slow once, and I hope to God I can again.
The grip he has on my arms sends jolts of shocking pain through my drugged brain as if it had sensitized every nerve ending. He hasn't even bothered binding me. Considering the fact that I feel as if I couldn't toss a noodle, that probably wasn't too big of an oversight.
School was tiring for both Sherlock and John. Of course, immidiately after Sherlock stepped inside the building, everyone's gaze was on him everytime he walked by them. John, on the other hand, was busy turning down every question on Sherlock skipping school. Everyone was suddenly interested in him.
He felt the gazes of the other contestants around him, but he didn't have the courage to look. That is why he didn't notice how many of them were looks of admiration and amazement. Nobody wanted to really approuch him, though, since he seemed closed inside is own little world. Well, that was mostly the truth.
,,Sherlock!" the blonde boy shouted at his friend and the room quieted. Sherlock noticed him and immidiately smiled with triumph. ,,John!" he ran to him and happily took his hands. ,,Please, kindly tell her that I already have an annoying friend named John and don't  need a therapist," his voice was a bit calmer. John just stared at him. Is he serious?
in some ways, always expecting John to take back the kindness he gave to him without even conscious thought. It was… it was truly terrible, and the army doctor wished he could just make the Dragon
Colonel Wilkes sharpened his stare, coming closer so that he stood in front of Bill, a few feet away from John and Sherlock. John noted how his friend stared perfectly straight ahead, slightly down so as to not challenge the higher ranking officer, spine stick-stiff and hands at his side. The perfect model of a soldier. Wilkes' voice held in it surprise, as well as a touch of something else that made John swallow and feel a small flash of unease.
