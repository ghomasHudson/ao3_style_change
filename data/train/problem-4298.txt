“Cas is right,” Dean said, grateful for the change of subject. He snatched another donut and fished out the map, laying it out on the bed while he held the donut in his teeth. After taking a bite, he held it with one hand while smoothing out the paper with the other. “Let’s figure out how to get home.”
Cas canted his head to the side and appraised him. “Why would you do that?”
request?” Crowley said. “Clearly you need me, not the other way around.”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean panted between kisses. “I think I have since…since that time in Bobby’s kitchen when you threatened to throw me back in Hell.” He broke away from Castiel’s lips, mouthing down his chin, his throat, sucking a bruise there. “Every time I wanted to say something, I couldn’t get it out.” Dean pulled back, looking as though he was searching Castiel’s eyes. “I don’t know why nothing’s stopping me now, but I’m damn glad of it.”
DVD was enough information to put him away for good. Incidentally, how
Dean shrugged at his glass and took another sip. “It’s five o’clock somewhere.” He chanced a look at the other man as the coffee was served. Long, graceful fingers wrapped around the mug, bringing it up to a face framed by an unruly mop of dark brown hair, a hint of stubble over his strong jawline, and laugh lines. Before Dean could think to turn back to his drink, the stranger looked at him with eyes so blue and deep, Dean had momentary vertigo.
“You’re telling me you have to go through
is all too real, and for big-name authors, that can spill over into how their private lives affect their brand—same as with celebrities in other forms of media. This can come up big-time at a con, when hundreds or thousands of people are watching what their favorite authors say and do. One drunken insult or blowing off a fan’s request can haunt them for months, if not years, and can absolutely have an effect on book sales. While authors both veteran and new will get social media coaching from their publicist (if they have one), I am not aware of any editors or publicists requiring advance approval of an author’s social media posts. That was all Bela.
He tried focusing on the expanse of skin in front of him, looking for any matching freckles on Cas’ back, and began tracing patterns along the muscles of his shoulder blades. “Did you know your muscles, the indentations between them, they kind of look like wings?”
Sam wrinkled his nose. “You wanna hear it now, or should I wait? You two looked like you were in the middle of something.”
“You’ve said before that we are family,” Castiel continued.
The drive from Northwood, zigzagging southwest toward the Iowa/Missouri/Nebraska borders, was peaceful…outside the car. Flat, fallow farmland covered in snow, and straight roads not well-plowed gave the impression of driving on a landscape devoid of anything but
“I promise you, Dean, if you spend fifteen minutes in the hot tub, the air will feel fantastic when you get out.”
Shrugging the hands off, Dean twisted in his chair. “Bela. Do we need to talk here at the table?”
“Not exactly. The African Oxpecker is often seen riding on the hide of a giraffe. The Oxpecker eats the ticks that are feeding on the giraffe, as it also does with other mammals in Africa. I pulled some photos together, put a saddle on the giraffe, added a cowboy hat and spurs to the enlarged Oxpecker sitting in the saddle, and tweeted it without a caption.”
A quick search on Google Maps showed that there was a diner and no fewer than three home improvement stores all along the same main street due south across the Mississippi River from downtown Saint Paul, and since Dean didn’t want to be driving around with a winged angel more than he had to, this seemed the most efficient use of their time.
“Right now, I want you to think you’re dreaming. I know it feels real.”
Dean watched, mesmerized, as Castiel stood and removed the scarf and fleece jacket, setting them aside over the back of the desk chair, then slowed the vibrations down again until they were visible. The wings lifted and spread slightly, then shook, the feathers rustling loudly, and folded neatly back into place.
“No!” Dean breathed out. “Want…you… Fuck me, Cas.”
Dean froze next to Castiel. “Sam…”
Dean cut his eyes to Cas before answering. “We haven’t gotten that far yet. We’re still trying to figure out how to get to him in the first place.”
Gabriel pulled his wings up and back a bit, and sat forward, looking excited for the first time since he’d arrived at the bunker. “That’s right, I haven’t shared this with you yet. Dean, yes, but… Well, I’ll give you the better version than I gave him. So, this is advanced level angelology. We’ll start with symbolism.”
“I don’t know.” Sam shrugged. “Anyone.”
Gabriel didn’t respond from where he sat cross-legged at the foot of the bed, hands folded in his lap, his wings hanging limply to either side.
“Still too much on the cryptic,” Gabriel said, holding his head in his hands. “Stop making puzzles for us to solve.”
“Bullshit.”
“Hey, Gabe, are you able to, you know, vibrate your wings back into the etheric plane?”
“That why this doesn’t bother you?” Dean asked, raising where his and Cas’ hands were joined together.
“No.” Dean stood up and got a bottle of water out of the mini-fridge. He gestured to everyone else to see if they wanted one, but had no takers. “Cas was thinkin’ that too, for a while. That he was just a tool to be used, a hammer. Without his grace, he was useless.” He took a few swallows of water. “And that’s bullshit. For him and for you. Yeah, you can do some crazy things with your power, but that’s not who you are.”
“What we need to teach him is that he doesn’t have to make decisions alone,” Cas continued. “This is where I made my mistakes. I thought I needed to fix things myself. That involving you would put you in harm’s way. Or that it was yet another thing for you to handle, when you already had so much.”
Sam could actually see Dean’s decision-making process.
“Sam.”
Those he would have to work up to. He needed more support from Dean, more backup, as it were. The Dean who thought they were married might be in enough denial that it would take a lot to convince him otherwise. But the Dean who professed his love…that Dean might be able to help.
“Yes…” Castiel said, unsure how much to tell her. “There was an attempt. It was unsuccessful. Obviously. But we have met this person before and if they try again, we’ll be prepared.”
“Have you seen the office downstairs?”
it works, just that it
his skin. And the soreness in his neck was already fading. “Cas?”
“So, an archangel,” Sam said. “That’s basically what you’re saying.”
“Okay,” Dean broke in, annoyed. “If I wanted a science lesson, I would have paid attention in school.”
“He blamed himself for Mom dying,” Lover Dean said. “You had to have seen that. All the drinking, the obsession.”
“Wait,” Dean said, “you want to go to Waterville?”
“You leave that filthy animal alone!” the mother reprimanded. “Get over here. You stay far away from them. They’re not nice.”
Gabriel smiled sadly. “An apology.”
Castiel aimed, took in a long breath and let it out slowly, feeling his heartbeat, and at the end of the exhale, he fired.
Gabriel smiled and bowed his head once, while Castiel spoke. “Please. Do as you must.”
“Uh… Okay. I’ll just…yeah.” Backing out of the room, Sam stopped by his room to grab two pairs of black sweat shorts, then headed for a closet where he knew they kept bathroom supplies, trying desperately not to think about Gabriel naked in the shower.
“Well, you’re not getting out of that circle anytime soon, so good luck with that.”
“Dean…I—”
Castiel trimmed and rolled the brass mesh to create a long wire that would just fit into the larger of the holes. “Ready?” he asked.
“Pick a wrist,” he said, opening the kit and unpacking a pair of sterile, nitrile gloves. The largest size available was still a little small, and when the rubber accidentally snapped as he struggled with getting it on his right hand, he saw Gabriel flinch. “Is this… Am I triggering you?”
“Yeah, well crazy-you was kinda sweet. Innocent.”
wanted him to know you were in here with me.”
The minivan turned out to be unlocked—small town, older van, broken window; it was a good bet—and had a small toolkit in the back. Within five minutes, Dean had switched the van’s license plates with those of the SUV, intending to switch them again once they were out of town. If the van got reported stolen, it’d take the cops a while to track down all the plate switches, especially if they included a few out-of-state plates. He ripped the plastic sheeting off the window and stuffed it under one of the seats. The breeze would be nice, and they could always dump the van in Indiana.
“I don’t know,” Castiel said softly. “I was going to look online, but I didn’t want to see…”
His left wing didn’t look right, as if it wouldn’t fold correctly, and without thinking, Dean put his hand to the feathers, feeling something warm and sticky as well as cool and nebulous. Withdrawing his hand, he saw blood and thin tendrils of grace.
“No, it’s—” Dean tried again. “It’s not that. And this isn’t easy to talk about, for me. Can you at least listen to me, and then…I don’t know. Go from there?”
Sucking in a breath, Dean closed his eyes and shuddered. But before he could say that maybe he’d changed his mind and now was good too, his stomach gurgled. He felt Cas’ lips on his, brief but insistent, and then a sudden chill as Cas stood up.
“Alliterative,” Cas said, “but…I like it. What do you think, Dean?”
“I don’t know, Dean. I don’t— But I have to go.”
“No, you’re right.”
“Yeah, well Cas managed to get himself shot in the wing with angel-blade bullets. But you got me. And maybe Gabe can help.”
“And you matter too, Cas.”
“Look, maybe you haven’t noticed, but Dean’s been in love with you since…I don’t know. Years. A long time. It’s
Castiel frowned. Dean was fond of using nicknames, usually as a sign of affection. But this was not an affectation. This had a coldness to it, as if to underscore the fact that Castiel was not human and therefore did not belong.
“I’ve got smelling salts. Hang on.” Sam ran down the hall to their pharmacy, initially stocked through selective pilfering, then later by careful hacks from Charlie, who had taught Sam before she was killed. Charlie—and Jody— were perhaps the only allies who never caused Sam to worry about their trustworthiness. Everyone else who’d ever helped had either turned on them or threatened to bail. Even Kevin, who was dragged into the whole tablet mess against his will, would probably have taken off for school or at least someplace without demons if he’d had the chance. And if he had, he’d probably still be alive.
“So you’re here…like
Dean laughed. “I like the way you think. That would definitely be something my characters would be smack in the middle of. And then the stakes are even higher than in my previous books, because how the hell are they going to fight an angel?”
This brought Castiel up short. “Why?”
“How about you get these cuffs off me?” Gabe retorted.
“Yeah. I did. I went to a panel on marketing. Someone I met there was on it, and I went to be supportive, but I wound up learning enough to know that writing another book a year was going to be less work than trying to market myself.”
.” Cas gave him a death glare.
Castiel met Dean’s eyes with a glare, irritated that his tone had been parental, as if Castiel was a child. “I am not—”
Shrinking away from him, Cas’ eyes stared blankly, widened, and then he crumpled just as Dean caught him.
“I can take care of myself. We need to go.”
“It’s the part that can’t forgive himself,” Cas offered.
“Again?” Cas asked, clearly having heard this many times before.
“Well, as annoying as it would be to have Gabriel as a brother-in-law, mostly I just want Sam to be happy. Y’know? He deserves that. And if that winds up being Gabriel…” Dean shrugged.
Castiel tried to twist around, to see the speaker.
Nodding a second time, Dean added, “I fear never having you in my life again.”
“A…fish?”
“I know he’s still grieving the loss of Mary. As, I’m sure, are you. I haven’t spoken to him since her funeral. I want him to know—”
“I like it. Go on.”
“You’re so beautiful, Cas. I don’t know what I did to deserve you.”
“It’s worth a try. Finding and communicating with that helping part seems to be the key.”
“Sam?” she asked.
“I’ll try and keep the connection open as long as I can,” Gabriel said. “But please hurry.”
“Well, now he thinks he’s useless,” Sam said, feeling his frustration build. “Is that what you showed him? Because if that’s what you see, then your world’s even more messed up than ours.”
“Yeah, I’ll get Sammy on the research as soon as he wakes up.” Dean took another bite of his meal and felt It practically melt in his mouth. “Damn, that’s good. These little diners in the Midwest? They know their meat.” He chewed some more and swallowed. “Maybe if we get a newspaper. See if anything might attract a hunter. Could give us a better idea of what sort of monsters exist here and how we can network with any hunters. Me and Sam, every time we’ve been to another world, the supernatural finds us first. We don’t have to go looking for it.”
believe as a result of today?”
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “Okay, a little remedial lesson in Gabriel 101 for those who can’t keep up in class. One: Lucifer only
“What are you going to try? Castiel?”

“How come she’s a she?” four-year-old Dean asked.
Castiel sat down on a green couch, allowing Sam to tug his coats off the injured arm. He managed to unbutton his shirt with one hand, slipping it off his shoulder to expose the wound. It wasn’t bad, as wounds go. He’d had far worse. The pain was a sharp ache on the edge of his consciousness; if he’d still had all his grace, he wouldn’t have felt any of it.
“You’re Dean too?” Tween Dean asked, appraising.
Dean looked at Bobby expectantly. “Yeah? What’s that?”
“Um… Thanks. But don’t you have to…work? Or whatever?”
“Producers, directors, and writers are all behind the camera,” Castiel said, “yet have a considerable influence on how a character is portrayed. One could say that the actor is the body of the character but the writer is the soul.”
Lover Dean glanced at Castiel, then back at Demon Dean and smiled. “I love you, Dean.”
“You know we’re gonna need to keep an eye on him, more than before,” Dean said, after Jack retreated to his room in the bunker. He thought about the snake for a moment. “And no pets.”
“Him again,” Dean muttered. “I’m not going with coincidence this time. He’s following us.”
“Headin’ up from Texas to see family in Wisconsin,” Dean said, adding a grin. “Go Packers.” He filled out the registration form, then pulled out his wallet and gave her his credit card.
“Yeah. They’re… Wow. Awesome.”
Meg glanced at the papers in front of her before she looked back at Cas. “Most authors or their publishers send out advance reading copies or ARCs a few months before a book comes out. They try to get reviews and endorsements from other authors or well-known public figures. They play up the release on social media. But then they follow it up with giveaways and readings and signings and appearances, if not a book tour. Tell us, CJ, what goes into a marketing plan for one of your books?”
“Then no one is telling you the truth.”
“Would you rather eat dressed as you are?” Cas raised an eyebrow at Dean’s boxers, which had Dean feeling seen in ways that were both uncomfortable and intriguing.
“You don’t think it could claim your soul? Take you anyway, because of the deal?” Dean sat down on the side of his bed and patted the space next to him, inviting Cas to join him.
Michael shook his head. “I did nothing to Castiel, other than show him the truth of who he is.”
“You know,” Dean said to Cas, “the only ones who’ve created problems in Heaven are angels. It’s not the souls.”
“Okay. Just notice.”
“Find me?” Chuck asked. He wore jeans and a red sport coat over a light blue button-down shirt. And dark-rimmed glasses. “You’re persistent, I’ll give you that, Castiel.”
“Well, I don’t need both of you staring at me while I sleep. Okay? That’s not on the table.”
“Jack? Lucifer’s love child?”
us, you go off half-cocked, looking for Lucifer. So tell me,
“Uh-huh.”
“Yeah, of course.” Dean stepped to the side and Castiel entered a nearly-exact replica of Dean’s room in the bunker. The only difference he could spot, having recently put Dean’s real bedroom back together, is that this one had nightstands on both sides of the bed, and enough pillows on the bed for two people to share it.
“Cas!” he cried out, another orgasm announcing its impending arrival.
“We’re all made for certain purposes; those are our strengths. Singing is…not one of mine. I sang for a baby once. I don’t think the baby liked it either.”
Dean shook his head. “For all we know, the president himself isn’t human.”
“So you value life and independence,” Gabe said.
Sam ran his hands through his hair. “Thanks, Cas. For helping. I don’t think I could deal with this alone.”
“I realize I have earned your distrust, Dean.”
In the end, they decided not to knock. While it might provoke a more aggressive response from Demon Dean, they all agreed that knocking would give him the opportunity to shut them out. Lover Dean verified that the door was locked, and although he still had the skeleton key for his own door with him, he urged Castiel to see if being their helper gave him unlocking privileges.
“How can they steal demons away?” Sam asked.
“What the hell, Gabriel? You said you’d restrict what you did to healing me.”
Very well, Sam. Take care of yourself until we get there. Gabriel says hi and he will stay out of your way.
. Without that cleansing, it was up to humans to repent and pray for forgiveness. Many didn’t. Really, that’s when Hell was born.”
“No…” Castiel struggled harder. “Please…”
“My BFF here invited me, moose,” Crowley said. “And I’d be a terrible friend if I didn’t come in his time of need.”
Cas seemed tense when Dean brought the laptop back into his room and sat down, much like he’d been the night before. This time, Dean paid attention. “Kick your shoes off and get comfy. You look like I’m about to do a white-glove inspection of your weapon, soldier.”
“I’ll tell you now, Michael is not always right.”
“Would you come down there with me now?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted from in front of the table. “Will you join us for dinner?”
“How does this manifesting thing work?” Sam continued, trying to keep the topic fairly light. “If you were to hide your wings again, would they still be covered with all this stuff?”
“For turning them in.”
. He cursed his guilty conscience and made a decision. “Cas, wait. I’ll go with you. Sam, why don’t you go to Colorado. You’ve got a handle on this, and you’re way better with kids than I am. If this is just a salt-and-burn, you’ll be done by tomorrow night and we can meet you back here.”
. The Cas I know. And not as a tool or anything. I just…I need you in my life. I can’t—”
Castiel rested his hands on his thighs, let out a long breath, and waited for Sam to begin.
“I don’t know. I’ve never come across something like this before. Let’s try to wake him.”
“What do you want it to be?” Gabriel asked softly. “Because I can never speak of it again if that’s what you want.”
“But Dad says it’s okay to hurt angels,” Stephen said, dropping half a dozen black feathers onto the pavement. “They don’t really feel anything anyway.”
Sam nodded. “They launched the American Council on Angel Affairs, which sounds neutral but was really a government-funded task force to find ways to control or manipulate angels for their own means. Then last year, in the presidential election, the current president ran on an anti-immigrant, anti-angel platform. He stirred up a lot of American anger over lost jobs and rising costs and he blamed it all on the angels.”
Naomi sighed. “One good apple doesn’t restore a bushel of rotten ones. It eventually rots too.”
“Gabe!” Dean shouted.
“I’m not asking you to marry me, Dean. Besides, I don’t even know if you’re interested. You could have a hot girlfriend waiting at home for you.”
“Not your fault, Cas. Don’t go there. ‘Sides, me speaking up might have made it worse. This one time, I remember Dad left me and Sam in a motel for a couple weeks. Ran out of food. Some folks left their cooler in the back seat of their car. I broke in and got us some sandwich fixings. Someone saw me, though, and gave Dad hell when he eventually got back. Told him he was raising irresponsible hooligans. Not a word you hear often. Anyway, Dad looked properly chastised in the parking lot while this woman tore him a new one, but then he took it out on me after he got back in the room. And told me I’d better keep quiet or I’d get worse.”
Dean graced him with one of his adorable half-smiles. “You can kiss me again.”
“The beer can wait,” Castiel said, coming closer.
“Rowena was successful before in banishing Lucifer,” Cas offered. “Perhaps she could do the same with Michael.”
Dean shrugged, feeling uncomfortable, a mix of unidentifiable emotions battling in his body.
“I did. And you being next to me in bed meant several hours of fulfilling rest. No flashbacks.”
“Sam has a point,” Castiel said, breaking into the conversation for the first time. “It would actually be quite the strategic move. It’s something I will need to look into when Gabriel is safe.”
Gabriel scoffed. “Brat.”
“How’s he doing, Gabe?” Dean asked, not able to see much in the mirror. Cas appeared to be unconscious.
“Oh, buddy,” Dean shook his head and chuckled. “I think you should lose control like this more often.” He drove his fingers deeper into one spot and Castiel could feel his wings trembling again. “Like that,” Dean said triumphantly.
“Hold up!” Dean shouted, raising his hands toward the crowd.
Dean nodded, chewing and swallowing a bite. “So, what’s the plan, then? We know what we’re doing next?”
“Maybe. If I keep my contract and continue to be published.”
Sam thought toward him.
“Gotta be the angel mojo,” Dean said. “I can’t believe you’re a real angel. Like, mind: blown.” He mimed an explosion around his head.
“Think, Castiel,” Michael said, not unkindly. “You know this. I exist outside of space and time. Physical weapons—including fire, no matter what kind of oil fuels it—cannot harm me.” He came close to Cas, who continued to stand his ground, then held his hand out, palm up. “Take my hand, Castiel. You may keep your sword if you wish.”
“I’ll talk; you eat,” Cas said. “You look hungrier than I feel.” He took one more bite, then licked his fingers clean before wiping them on a napkin. “I’ve been thinking a lot about what led me to this point. So much of it is about hiding from my family. In a lot of ways, I’m free. Free to write the books I want, free from overbearing contracts and editors, free to be creative instead of always playing to the publisher’s bottom line. I don’t have a lot of roots or ties to people or places. Until now.”
“Yeah, I hear you.” Dean swore under his breath. “You know what? We’re at a mall. I’ve got a credit card that’s almost maxed out, so we can use it and I’ll cut it up before we leave. Let’s go find you some wing-friendly clothes. Deal?”
Dean was in front of him again, holding his hand, their skin hot where their palms touched. “You with us, Cas?” Dean asked.
“Because I’m not a damn puppet,” Dean shot back. “And it would have cost a lot of lives.”
. Just like it’s okay if you want to pursue something with Cas. He knows the life, he’s come back every time he died, and Dean,” Sam paused, “he loves you. And not like a brother. Not the way he loves me.”
“Why would the angels stay here?” Dean mused, looking at Castiel. “I mean, hell, all it takes is one uncomfortable conversation or one question you guys don’t want to answer and you’re out of here. Why stay and have to go through the whole identification process?”
“You’re asking for my consent?” Dean asked. “’Cause you got it. Hundred and ten percent.”
Immediately, Cas was in front of them, his stance protective.
“Twenty-twenty hindsight,” Sam said, returning his attention to Jack. “It all makes sense now. So you see, whoever’s blood or DNA or grace or whatever you have in you? It doesn’t matter. What matters is what you choose to do with it.” With a nod toward Michael, Sam added, “I’m thankful that Michael helped me see that.
Dean paused in the bathroom doorway. “Yeah, but you’re not gonna fit in a diner booth like that.”
“We’ve all screwed up,” Sam said. “Sometimes little things, sometimes not.” He chuckled. “Usually not. But we’re more than just what we’ve done. More than what we’ve experienced. You can make mistakes, Cas, even big ones, and still be loyal, still be pure. Still be divine.”
Castiel blinked, surprised. He hadn’t even considered the possibility. What if he had to flirt his way through this? He was physically incapable of flirting. An absolute hopeless case, as any of his friends could confirm. There was a reason his last date had been ages ago. He really didn’t want to think about how long it had been.
“Hey, I know you’re still waiting but maybe you want to order something to drink while you’re waiting for your date?”
Now that they were outside, Castiel felt confident enough to ask the question he’d been hesitant to ask all evening. “Why did you sit down at my table? How did you know? You were just coming in.”
Surprised, Castiel tried to take a look at the watch from his periphery, not daring to break eye contact with Robert. He hadn’t even noticed how much time had passed. It hadn’t felt like two hours.
On their way out, Dean put one hand lightly on Castiel’s back to guide him outside Castiel felt, for the first time since he thought Dean might be a criminal, trying to find cover, a flutter of nervousness in his stomach – this time pleasant and exciting. As soon as they were out the door, Castiel took a deep breath, letting the evening’s cool air tickle his lungs and escape his lips in white puffs. It had cooled down considerable in the last few hours.
“Uhm…” Castiel tried to think of something he’d done today but his head was still trying to adapt to the situation and to Dean, who seemed to have a very intense gaze. “I, uh, I had a very normal day at the university.” He noticed Dean might think he was an older college student, so he added: “I did everything I usually do as a professor of Ancient Languages.”
On his way back to his car, Dean turned around one last time, smiling. Castiel watched him drive away before unlocking his door and walking up to his flat. A heat had settled in Castiel, both comforting and exciting.
“You’re not drunk.”
“How did they manage to set us up?”
“Alright then,” he said, “call me.” Then he turned around and started walking into the direction of his colleagues.
“I’m Robert. Robert Nicholson.” He held his hand out, which Castiel shook right away.
Robert put one hand over his heart and raised the other into the air.
That was when Hannah hushed him. Castiel was glad. As much as their presence calmed him, having Gabriel chattering into his ear at all times was more distracting than helpful.
"That's more like it," Dean chuckled, now how can I help you."
"It's all my fault Cas, I've been so selfish! Everyday Sammy wakes up in a motel bed or the seat of the car, and everyday I see him get up and I know that he shouldn't be here. He should being living it up with a wife and a fancy house, but I ruined that for him. I robbed him of his life Cas! And everyday I wake up and I know I shouldn't be here. My father died for me, and for what? So I could fuck up the lives of everyone I have ever loved? Thousands have died because of me and the mistakes I have made. I started the fucking Apocalypse and let the only family I ever knew die just because I couldn't clean up my own messes."
Goodbye Castiel.
"It's a deal. Now who is the guy anyway?"
Nevermind.
Panic shot through Cas. Dean never called him that. What was happening? Dean was in trouble, he could feel it.
"Dean Winchester, I have a job for you. I have a man who needs to be taken care of immediately. This is a sensitive case and should be handled with complete discretion. I will pay handsomely. I cannot go into anymore detail on the phone, but if you are interested meet me in front of the Metropolitan Museum at 11:30 am, I will be wearing a blue hoodie."
"And how much money are we talking."
Castiel's screen lit up with an incoming text message. He had not quite gotten a handle on the strange machine, but just like everything else on Earth, he was beginning to get used to it. He even found himself feeling more at home among humans than he did in Heaven. He glanced down at his phone, the message was a single word.
"Dean Winchester?"
Put Me Back Together Again
"He says that if I don't confess by the end of the month then he will show the world the truth. He thinks he is being noble, but really he is just standing in the way of my dream. I won't let the future of my business hinge on one man's actions. He needs to be disposed of, discreetly and quietly."
--------------
"Which is what?" Dean was getting interested.
"You are to me." Dean began to protest but he was cut short by the impact of warm lips on his own. Everything melted away, the fact that he was kissing his best friend did not even cross his mind. Their lips began to meld together as the kiss grew deeper. Green eyes met blue, a thousands words expressed in a single glance. Dean was still a broken man, but for every moment that the kiss lasted Cas began to put him back together again.
Dean drove back to his apartment, and popped open a beer as he sat down at his kitchen table to look over the file. Flipping it open Dean looked at the name spelled across the top of the page in black letters; Castiel Novak.
"But goddammit Cas that's the point, I'm not worth saving!"
"May name is Marv."
"All the information you will need is in this file." A vanillin file was slipped onto Dean's lap by the hoodied man. "And remember, if you fail you'll die too."
Forget about it.
Within seconds Cas vanished, reappearing in a dark motel room. Dean sat on the motel bed, his green eyes flooded with tears. But Cas' eyes did not linger on those of the other man, his glance flew to the object in Dean's hand. The moonlight glinted of the cold metal of a hand gun, a gun that was shakily pressed to the temple of its holder. The green eyed man looked up, surprised by the appearance of the cloaked angel. "I am so sorry Cas..."
"For everything." Dean choked, not bothering to shake Cas away.
"Well Cas," Dean said with a coy smile, "let's have some fun."
Dean, what's wrong?
"Dean, no." Cas whispered, wrapping his arms around the shaking man. "Never have I regretted pulling you from Hell. I might have had the orders to do so, but I didn't do it because you were Michael's vessel. I did it because I knew that the world needed you. That Sam needed you. That I needed you. Listen to me when I say this Dean Winchester. You are a man of greatness, and you are not alone. I am here for you Dean and I always will be. You are worth every tear and every drop of blood. Dean I would do anything for you and I know you would do the same for me. I am here Dean, let me help you."
Yes Dean. Cas replied.
While he didn't like to admit it, Dean liked the way is leather jacket tightened around his shoulders when he pulled his gun on his target, he liked the power that spilling blood gave him, he enjoyed the kill. Dean had known death since an early age when his mom died; death followed him after that, peaking around each corner and taking away the ones Dean most cared about. He tried to fight it, push back the inevitable, but one day it become to much and something deep inside him snapped. If he couldn't beat death he would join him. That was the day Dean become judge, jury, and executioner for those wealthy enough to afford it.
"Failure isn't in my vocabulary." Dean smiled, he looked over at the man but he was already shuffling away.
An empty shot class was slammed down onto the counter and two fingers rose in the air signaling for another. Dean Winchester was tired, tired of the bullshit in his life, tired of his job, and tired of having to drinking alone in some filthy bar. However, he couldn't escape it, bullshit was everywhere, his job paid the bills, and drinking was the only way to drown the screams in his head. Dean Winchester was a hired gun.
“I would hope so,” he agreed, still smiling.
. Dean had seen that Castiel had been stood up. Dean was pretending to be his date, so Castiel wouldn’t suffer further embarrassment. Dean was here to help. Castiel relaxed.
“I’ll go inside where I will find the target subject at the bar. I will sit down next to him and start complaining about my work to give him a reason to talk to me. Then I will start involving him in a conversation and invite him in for a drink. I will keep on paying for his drinks until he’s drunk while I will pretend to be intoxicated as well. The barkeeper is informed and will only serve me the non-alcoholic options we have provided for him. As soon as the target subject is compromised, I will try to gather information that might be useful concerning the
Dean didn’t let him talk by himself all the time either, but offered up information about himself too, whenever it fit. He told Castiel about his little brother Sam, who apparently wasn’t as little as he used to be anymore, towering over most grown man by several inches. He talked about how he grew up in Kansas, that he was a car mechanic and that his boss Bobby was practically family. And he talked about his love for Cowboys, for cars, and for food, especially pie.
“Why don’t you?”
“Although,” Dean granted, “I did have a pretty good time tonight. Not that often that going undercover is as much fun as it was tonight.”
“Best you start at the beginning,” Dean prompted.
“I supposed you’re right,” he responded, attempting a smile of his own. “What do you do?”
Castiel tilted his head, confused. “Sorry?”
“Yeah, I suppose he’ll take a little longer.” He reached for the menu and ordered the first thing that caught his eye: a coke.
“I was wondering the same,” Dean agreed. “Maybe we should get our heads together and compare notes?”
“Even more boring than Sales Provider, huh?” Robert laughed, unsurprisingly not offended.
“I don’t think you will have any trouble to do so, Dean,” Castiel responded truthfully, and got out of the car. The cold evening air, momentarily forgotten in the heated car, hit him again and he shivered.
He could see the policeman’s smile widen, although he averted his gaze, rubbing his neck like Castiel had seen other people do when nervous. The gesture was boyish and unexpected but Castiel thought it charming.
It took him a while to remember that Robert had asked him a question. Just because he hadn’t gotten his intel, that didn’t mean he could blow his cover. He laughed softly.
“Well, it doesn’t sound like a very attractive name. It’s just not very… cool.” Even Castiel knew that his attempt at sounding a little more casual had failed, the last word sounding foreign from his lips.
“Great, it’s a date then,” Dean announced, sporting another one of his cheeky grins. “Maybe this time without cover names and false alcohol?”
For a long time nothing happened, except for them looking at each other, neither of them daring to make a move.
“Coming from a guy called ‘Castiel’,” Gabriel chastised him. “The lead singer of Led Zeppelin was called Robert!” Gabriel seemed to take this a lot more personal than Castiel had expected but after a second, he got back on track: “Wait, does that mean he’s hot?”
When he showed up.
Castiel couldn’t help the smile tugging on the corners of his lips. He’d been especially proud of that one.
,” Castiel admitted.
Castiel decided now was not the time for ‘I asked you first’ games. He flashed his badge. “FBI. We received a tip that someone called Robert Nicholson had information about a case that we’ve been looking into.”
When Dean spoke, his voice was raspy, cracking a little in the beginning before he cleared his throat. “I, uh, I wanted to ask if maybe you’d like to… to go out with me sometime. More in the planned date sorta way.”
Dean looked up. “Sorry?”
Unlike anticipated though, the waitress didn’t walk to the bar to pass on his order but moved to the front door, taking her phone out of her back pocket. Castiel didn’t mind – it wasn’t like he was in a rush – but he hoped her boss wouldn’t spot her sneaking out the door. He didn’t have to worry though because she was back two minutes later, this time walking up to the bar.
Again, he could hear Gabriel intercepting through his earpiece. “Well look at that, now two hours ago our little Cassie almost had a panic attack, thinking about having to flirt and now he’s hitting on our target subject like there’s no tomorrow.”
There it was, Castiel’s unasked question answered, his doubts and fears making place for anticipation.
The drive was spent discussing which Disney movies were the best, even though Castiel had to admit that he hadn’t seen many (much to Dean’s horror). Interrupted was their topic only when Castiel gave Dean directions as to where he should drive. Secretly, Castiel wished he’d chosen a restaurant further away from his home, but of course he hadn’t known that this would be how the evening would go.
“Wow. That is…“ Castiel tried to feint interest, but maybe because he knew that it was a lie, he failed to make it sound sincere.
“While wearing the batman costume?” Castiel wheezed.
Castiel smiled as Dean jokingly downgraded himself in their imaginary relationship to pry something out of him. “What would you like to know?”
“Man, I’m telling you, nothing beats
Dean walked him the last few steps to his front door, where Castiel fidgeted with his keys a little. “Thank you,” he said. “For everything. I really enjoyed tonight.”
the credit it deserves, but who didn’t cry when Mufasa died? I mean, come on! that was cinematic history right there!”
Not having much else to do, Castiel wondered what she’d been doing outside. Calling her boyfriend to pick her up as soon as her shift was done? Maybe there was a family emergency and she was checking in? He hoped not. And what kind of family emergency could that be? Maybe someone was sick? Or maybe she had a child waiting at home. She seemed a little young but there were younger girls to have become mothers. He sighed. He should stop imagining the personal life of his waitress out of boredom.
“Name?”
Castiel was stunned. “And you just came over at that?”
Castiel blinked, still confused. Was this man a secret agent who’d been forced to go undercover quickly? Or maybe a criminal, trying to avoid the cops? He could feel his hands getting sweaty, while Dean shrugged out of his well-worn leather jacket and reached for the menu. Out of the corner of his eye, he tried to see if some of the other patrons were looking. Maybe he could send a message. But all the other customers were now focused on their food, their conversations, their dates, some noticed his gaze and smiled, apparently happy that his ‘date’ had finally arrived. His eyes ultimately settled on Dean, who looked up from the menu to smile softly at him. That was when the final gear in Castiel’s head turned and it made
Castiel smiled when he saw Dean laugh but he couldn’t help the strong pang of disappointment in his chest. As long as he hadn’t known why Dean had sat down in front of him, he’d been able to pretend as though maybe he’d been interested in Castiel. Now, however, he knew it had been just because he’d looked so pitiful, even the waitress had felt responsible to step in. He didn’t blame her, he was even grateful, knowing his night would have gone a lot differently, but it still hurt.
“Don’t even start with me.”
in different languages, as if flipping through cards.
“Cas, wait!” Dean called, but Castiel was faster, moving up the stairs and out through the thick steel door. He took the steps to the road and turned right, away from Lebanon, though he knew he wouldn’t walk too far. A swirl of sensations—
“That okay?”
“Even so.” Castiel took the final steps to four-year-old Dean’s door and knocked.
Sam shook his head. “Let’s just stick to what I said before lunch. By contract, we can’t talk about the show or take photos. The fans seem to really love the show. No need to make trouble for anyone.”
“Oh, come on, Cas. Nude beaches. Gay pride.”
“Well, that’s good to hear.” Cas leaned up on one arm. “And what are the judgments, the thoughts that keep you from accepting this as ‘all kinds of awesome’?”
“We’re in kind of a bind here,” Sam explained. “And I think maybe EMDR can help. But I don’t know enough about it.”
His memories turned more domestic. After hunts, when they’d celebrated back in the bunker, Cas joining him in a beer, even nibbling on a pizza. Laughter. Hugs. What if it was…more? Would he want more?
“What did you notice?”
“How?” The man seemed genuinely upset.
Dean shook his head, still not making any eye contact. “Because I’m dead. Shoulda stayed that way.”
“Wait!
“Um…” Dean peered in every direction, taking his time. “Looks like one of those huge entryways to a really old, big house. Like a creepy, haunted house. Why?”
“It would appear so,” Castiel said, sitting down on the bed. “Does Kansas allow the death penalty?”
“Your phone, Dean. Give it to me.”
“Of course, Dean. Twelve and a half. Almost a teenager.” He caught Sam’s shocked look and tried to convey some reassurance.
“Oh, you would be surprised,” Crowley said.
“This is my fault,” Jack muttered, near tears. “I keep getting people hurt. I keep hurting Castiel. I’m trying
“You’ve lost too much already,” Chuck said.
“Oh.” Dean wondered how he had such a gift for sticking his foot in his mouth. He heard Castiel shift uncomfortably in the back seat and figured they had about five more cars to go before they reached whatever was up ahead. “What did you sing?”
“Hey, Cas. Can I come in?”
“Yeah, that sounds like a plan,” Dean said. “I don’t know what else we can do now.” He started back toward the van, Cas beside him, with the rest of them trailing behind. The moment he saw movement around the van, he stopped abruptly and raised his hand to stop the others. “Who’s there?” he called out.
“Of course not,” Rowena continued. “As if I would do anything for that ungrateful excuse for a son.”
“Mall food? Really, Sam?”
“Not named after. Angel of. There’s a difference.”
Dean pursed his lips and shook his head. “Not like it’d be the first time. It’s probably better not to bring any more nephilim into the world, but nah, not a problem.”
“Well, Jack can obviously do it,” Dean said, “but, uh, he needs a little work on the accuracy, right?”
Blinking himself back into rational thinking, Dean returned the handshake. “Dean.”
“Jack?” Sam said aloud. “I’m really concerned about you. I want to make sure you’re safe. And…we know more now too. At least come back so we can talk.”
“Dean!” Sam snapped.
“I am so sorry, Dean.”
Reaching out to stroke along the upper joint and the alulas, Dean hummed. “You just relax and let me take care of you for once.”
He turned, noting the discolored circle in front of the door again, and stepped out into the gray. Running his hand along the hallway, he found another room with a closed door, then another. Going the length of the hallway on one side, then back along the other, he found a total of eight rooms, all but that of the youngest Dean’s with the doors closed. Each door had the same discolored circle in front of it, which was giving Castiel an idea.
“No, I mean what kind of power would it take to do all that?” Sam clarified.
,” Cas answered, lowering his head.
“Kate,” Sam began again, “Who exactly do you think we are?”
Dean wanted to yell, to haul off and smack the kid, to tell the adults that
“I met with the mom. No EMF anywhere. This family doesn’t have a lot, but the mom definitely cares for her kids. I’m gonna see if I can provoke tonight, maybe get some EVPs and figure out whose grave I get to dig up. I’m meeting with the historian in the morning. How’s things on your end?”
“May I come in?”
“Vets aren’t the only ones who use it, Dean. Cops do too.” He tapped twice on his phone and raised it to his ear. After a few moments of silence, he raised his eyebrows. “Hi Jody. It’s Sam.”
“Let’s find out!”
Cas gave him a tiny smile. “Thank you, but no.”
“No, Dean. I
“So, what do we need to do?” Sam asked. “How do we find Jack?”
“Means we’ve got no idea,” Gabriel said. “He’s gun-shy about moving between dimensions, so he probably hasn’t left this one. But he could be having high tea in the Pleiades for all we know.”
“Yeah, I—”
“Cas,” Cas said, clearly confused. “I’m Castiel.”
Castiel shrugged, a motion he knew he’d picked up from Sam and Dean at some point. It seemed to speak the words he didn’t have.
“You are.”
“It was… I remembered creation. And the words that led to a fish beaching itself so it could walk on land and eventually, through eons of evolution, become
Castiel nodded toward the front corner of the store. “I believe the bakery is over there.” He followed Dean and the cart, noticing a distinct change when a song came over the speakers.
“Okay. Cas. Hey, I’d like to—”
Dean took the opportunity to find the room service menu, and after choking on the prices, decided their burger didn’t sound too bad. And bonus: they offered apple pie a la mode.
. On a scale of one to seven, how believable is that thought?”
He knocked, expecting anything from a gun in his face to an angel blade at his throat.
“Oh yeah?” Dean asked, returning to preparing his breakfast. “Other than it always being Naomi who hurts you?”
“The grayness outside your door?” Castiel began. “We think that it’s hiding some other bedrooms. They’re not in your house with your mom and dad. At least we don’t think so. We think it’s kind of like…”
“What would you have me do, then? I am open to suggestions.”
“Another hour?” Gabriel asked.
Castiel held his hand out and after a hesitation, Dean took it. “We’re not going far,” Castiel said.
Dean shrugged. “Oh, you know me.”
that love. It has no place here.”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel replied, not wishing to be rude. “I don’t know why I’m here.” He looked around, yet there were no other customers. Sunlight streamed in through the front windows and glass door, revealing a wide tree-lined sidewalk adorned with empty bistro tables and chairs. A street edged with parked cars lay beyond the sidewalk, yet there were no people in sight. The clock next to the hanging menu announced that it was noon. Precisely. The second hand didn’t move.
“Or both,” Castiel added. “Those parts you don’t remember, they’re your learning, Dean. Who you are. Who you’re not. How far you’re willing to go. And how far is too far.”
Metatron smiled but didn’t answer.
“Oh?”
“No, Castiel. We cannot allow rotten fruit.” She raised her drill and aimed it without mercy while Castiel screamed.
“Not your bed,” Castiel managed to say through the pain.
With a stern look, Cas said, “Only the female cottonwoods produce seeds.”
“Maybe. And anger. Disgust.”
As Sam’s hand lowered, Castiel felt a calmness that he hadn’t felt in ages. A surety that he would find a way through this, even if he still lacked direction. He breathed in slowly, easily, imagining he was again inhaling those colorful wisps, reclaiming the parts of him that had been taken, whether by violence or misguided attempts to help. As he exhaled, he let go of the ties to Naomi. It didn’t matter that she was still alive, keeping Heaven running. Where it mattered, he’d won. She couldn’t hurt him anymore.
“Ruby,” Dean supplied, crunching on a piece of bacon.
“It will, Sam. Try and sleep some more. I’ll be back in another hour.”
One by one, each of the other Deans stepped forward, echoing, “I love you, Dean.”
“Great. Because as I figure it, we have less than seventy-two hours to pull it off or we may never have another chance.”
Bela picked up a handful of documents. “I’m going to need you to sign these, honey.”
Dean allowed himself to relax into that presence, and when he closed his eyes, he saw Cas instead of the usual catalog of people he hadn’t been able to save, people who’d died because Dean Winchester couldn’t possibly be as righteous as Cas claimed he was. He gave himself a brief moment to wonder what it would be like to feel deserving of Cas’ praise and adoration, and felt himself physically drawn closer to Cas, lying next to him. Here in the dark, in the privacy of his mind, he could pretend that he was worth something
“Doesn’t make it right,” Dean grumbled.
“It’s safe, Dean,” Castiel reassured him. “I just need to know what you see.”
“Maybe we should take a break,” Dean suggested. He could see Cas slowing down in both speech and mannerisms, his already stiff gestures becoming exaggerated and intentional.
Dean made a face at Cas’ back. “You think we need to be concerned about Farmer Guy?” he asked Gabriel.
“I don’t know, Sam. I mean, I’m sure Cas and I can take care of Gabe. I just don’t know what to do here.”
“It’s…” Sam seemed farther away than last time. “You could actually be a bit closer.”
Dean raised the phone to his ear again.
“Well, then what happened?” Husband Dean asked again.
prepay the room for two weeks.”
Jack tilted his head in question. “Oh?”
And then Sam was lowering his hand.
“Okay, but we find the bunker first,” Dean said. “Or find out if it’s there. Or if there are other hunters. We know Cas can heal in this world, but we don’t really know the extent of the supernatural here, right? So I’ll drive, Sam, you research, and the God Squad can figure out how two depowered angels, a halfling, and a bunch of humans can kill an archangel who’s already got an army and control over most of the planet.”
“These aren’t your true form,” Sam said, nodding. “Of course. I wouldn’t be able to see them otherwise. But these are going to need to be cleaned before I can treat the wounds.”
“Oh, do not tell me you zapped us to Lebanon the country,” Dean muttered, trying to figure out how to tell Sam about their mom.
“Okay. I’ll pass all this along to Cas when he gets here tomorrow night.” Dean could hear high-pitched talking in the background.
?” Dean growled, waiting for the caffeine to kick in any time now.
“Nah, I wasn’t fishing for compliments.”
Cas shook his head. “I don’t know. If I can, I don’t know how long I can stay.”
Using the pile for leverage, he managed to get to his feet and stand without falling. He had some movement with his right arm, but his left arm was severely weakened, the pain in his back centered more on the left side than the right. Grabbing the duffel and half-carrying, half-dragging it, he made it back to the SUV, pushed the duffel into the backseat, and fell into the front seat. It took a few more precious minutes to start the SUV, then he pulled out of the shooting range’s lot, drove around while looking for anyone who might have spotted him, doubled back a few times, and finally parked in the back of the motel lot.
else—before lowering his face into his hand. “I don’t want to know any more.”
“The real question, though,” Sam said slowly, not really wanting to bring this back up, “is whether he can help us get back to our own world. If he’s as powerful as you say, maybe he actually can.”
After brushing his teeth, Sam took a detour on the way back to his room. The room he’d found Gabriel in earlier wasn’t made up for sleeping; it was a bare mattress in a dusty, unused room. It didn’t sit right with him to leave Gabe with such paltry accommodations.
“Yeah, I knew that.”
He was headed down the hall toward the library when Cas stormed past him without a word.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Anything you want to share with the class?”
The last of the dishes done, Dean drained the sink. “Hey, Sammy, not to be a dick or anything, but me and Cas are gonna head out in a few. You’ll probably wanna get home, yeah?”
“No, Dean. Not at all.” Cas stretched his wing out farther, the flight feathers lightly stroking Dean’s shoulder and arm. As he suspected, his wings could sense what his vessel could not: Dean was a child of about four. A very normal, happy child.
“I am so sorry, Dean. I promised to heal him when we returned, and then…”
“What? Mom, no. We came here to
Sam sighed loudly. “His time in Hell.”
“You gonna tell me what happened? Maybe start with where you went.”
“Yeah. Gabriel helped me, um, get the bullets out and stitch you up. He said you could start healing yourself once they were out.”
“I… Yes.”
“Really?” Dean looked up, a hopeful expression on his face.
“Make it three.”
The room was nothing like what Castiel expected. He’d thought maybe another replica of the bunker bedroom, or perhaps a cold, dark, empty room like Suicidal Dean’s. He was not expecting a replica of Dean’s rack in Hell. His wings flared at the sight, bringing up his own memories, how much it hurt to see such a brilliant soul broken down and twisted into a vehicle for endless misery.
“No. I need to hear you say it. I need to feel you
“When in Rome?” Gabe suggested with a leer and an eyebrow waggle.
“Yeah, but Cas, you’re not Jewish,” Dean pointed out.
“Sight
“Go back to Hell, Dean,” Gabriel said over his shoulder. “You fit right in.”
“Nice,” Gabriel said with a nod. “Kudos to the kid.”
An hour and a half later, Dean’s hand was sore from what he figured had to have been a couple hundred autographs. Many people had bought multiple titles and asked that he sign them all, which he was happy to do. A few of the women and two of the men left cell phone numbers,
“This is what is in your way. It is not for you to bring them back together. What is in your way
Dean’s face flushed a little and he looked down at the space between them. “Yes.”
“So…what did you notice?” Sam asked, sounding a little unsure.
“Ooh, now that was a really good guess. I like that one. Still not correct, but you actually tried that time.”
“Your work will get into readers’ hands. I’m certain of that.”
“Your world sounds a little woo-woo compared to ours,” Gabriel said.
Dean squared his shoulders. “All right. Well, give me the one you know I won’t like.”
“Cas is better,” Dean said. “At least he’s awake and pissing me off. He won’t talk about what happened.”
“Not explicitly, no. We were teaching him right from wrong, but not how to weigh other perspectives and then make an informed choice. How to trust himself.”
“Well, it’d be a start,” Dean said. “We really need to find…um…a good story to cover.”
Sam chewed, swallowed, and nodded. “Let me know when you’re ready for help.”
“A demon,” Castiel said.
fated to change the world?”
. And I thought that,” he pointed to the door, “was the motel office. But it didn’t look like a house.” He eyed Castiel suspiciously. “This more angel mojo?”
, the
Castiel nodded affirmatively at Sam, then looked back at Dean. “What’s outside of your bedroom? When you don’t have to hide anymore?”
The more he listened, the more overwhelmed he felt. Cas had brought handouts—author swag, okay, but
“That’s not creepy at all.” At Cas’ laugh, Dean grinned. “Dude, you gotta tell me something.”
“Yeah? Something wrong?”
him. You said there are others?”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Teenagers.”
“The word fan
“I kill, Dean. I fight and I kill. Complete fulfillment of orders without question is what worship looks like to a soldier.”
The face nodded once and the door shut for a moment, then opened fully to reveal a young woman who couldn’t have been older than twenty-five but fear and exhaustion made her look like she was approaching middle age. Her dirty blond hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail and she wore charcoal sweatpants and a light gray hoodie with stains on the front. “I’m Barb. Barbara Elston. Come in. I’m sorry the house is a mess.”
“All right. I’m sure we can get brass mesh at a local home improvement store. We can look online to make sure. Maybe pick that up right after breakfast tomorrow.”
“I’m telling you, Cas, you haven’t lived until you’ve tried my Mom’s apple pie.” Dean had adapted this new nickname pretty quickly and Castiel didn’t mind. It made sense, and if Castiel was being honest, he liked it. It made a lot more sense to him than ‘Cassie’, which is what Balthazar had used to call him.
Dean parked impeccably, almost right in front of Castiel’s front door and pulled the hand break. As soon as they were standing, he was already out of the car, before Castiel had even had the chance to undo his seat belt. Dean walked around the car to open Castiel’s door for him.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
“Good night,” Castiel echoed.
Dean chuckled, shaking his head. He smiled one last time, not his half-lipped smirk but a wide smile that showed a perfect row of straight, white teeth and made his eyes crinkle at the corners.
Robert had put one hand on Castiel’s back and closed the other one around his upper arm and was now looking down on him with worry in his eyes. He was so close, Castiel could count the freckles on his face.
This time he heard another, deeper voice respond in his place. “Man, relax, Hannah. Our kiddo here can probably recite the whole thing in his sleep already, considering how often you’ve let him repeat it.”
The room was filled with ambient chatter and clinging glasses, underlined by soft music that trickled from the speakers that were hanging on the walls. Castiel let his eyes roam the bar. It didn’t take him long to find his target. There were only two men sitting at the bar and only one of them fit the description. He had to admit that the prospect of flirting suddenly appeared both more terrifying and appealing. Criminal or not, the man was undoubtedly attractive with muscular arms and a jawline that could cut through glass.
“Talking about Batman…” he prompted.
This was no pity. Castiel eyed the man in front of him with warmth. Dean might not be a Disney prince but in this moment, he seemed like one to Castiel.
“The pleasure is all mine, Dean.”
“How do I know if he is attracted to men?”
Castiel smiled. Yes, the wait had been worth it.
Castiel nodded, slowly. “Yes, one could say it like that. I suppose, I should have quit years ago.”
“Wow that is…”
Dean laughed out loud at that, relief draining the tension from his posture. “Not exactly, no. Just easily persuadable by my friends.”
That seemed to take Dean aback a little, but he brushed it off quickly. “Nah, you’re just being too humble.”
“And let me guess: Your boss is a huge a-hole.”
Almost, he said his actual name. “James Miller. Just call me Jimmy.”
“Why?”
“How come you guys are interested in the
It had been the second time already that he’d dismissed her, and the other customers were already starting to throw him pitiful glances. Uneasy, he shifted in his seat and took another look at his phone. Still no message from Balthazar. It was so typical for him to stand Castiel up. It wasn’t the first time this had happened and one of many reasons why Castiel had broken up with him. But for some reason he had once again decided to believe Balthazar’s lies about having changed and it never happening again if he only gave him another chance. Castiel had agreed to one date only, mostly because he had never been able to say no to Balthazar about anything. Balthazar knew that, which was probably why he wasn’t here right now, dressed to the nines and begging Castiel for forgiveness.
“Can you imagine his face?” Robert’s face was flush from the heat and the alcohol, his eyes alight with glee.
Although, it had only been fifteen minutes so far. Fifteen minutes was practically nothing. Fifteen minutes could be stuck in traffic with no battery left to contact his ex-boyfriend. Maybe he was helping an elderly woman across the street this instant.
It was Dean’s voice that broke the silence first: “I, uh, I should probably head home now.”
With one last gulp he emptied his coke, before reaching for his trench coat that was draped around the back of his chair.
“Alright, kiddo, but keep in mind: casual. So you better loosen up because else it’s gonna take some impressive yoga skills for you to pull that stick out of your own a-“
case.
“Well, now that I’ve got the reputation of a Disney prince, I gotta work to keep that up, right?” Dean joked.
“Seems like we played each other.”
He made a point of taking a long sip from his beer. It was the right one.
“Robert Nicholson.”
Castiel noticed he drank his Coke in the smallest sips possible, trying to postpone the moment when he’d hit the bottom of the glass. He didn’t even know why. He’d meant it when he’d broken up with Balthazar. He didn’t love him, he was sick of being put on second, third, or fourth place on his list of priorities. But a small part of him had just wanted to have company for the evening, have a nice dinner, good conversation. And Balthazar had always been good company.
Dean gestured back to the restaurant. “The waitress. Short, red-headed nerd? She called me and said there was a sweet guy with a handsome face who’d been stood up by some asshole and who could use someone to share a nice dinner with.”
He didn’t have time to answer anyway. He’d reached the bar, choosing a seat on the right of his target subject that would leave one bar stools between them empty, afraid that if he chose the one right next to him it might seem too obvious. With a loud sigh he let himself drop onto the stool, rubbed his eyes and ran both his hands through his hair, like he usually did when he’d had a long day at work, before he waved over the barman, a scrawny, blonde male, sporting mullet
“You can say that.” Castiel had talked a little too quietly, the words getting lost on their way out, but the other man seemed to have heard him anyway.
“If he’s really into men, he’ll come onto you one hundred percent. After all, you’re a pretty good catch with all that dark sex hair, those baby blue Bambi-eyes and that raspy voice. He won’t know what hit him, kiddo.”
Castiel frowned. “I don’t understand. I thought the family was supposed to make me more approachable and sympathetic?”
“Okay.” Slowly, Dean separated himself from Castiel, taking a small step back so he had the space to reach into his pockets. Castiel almost closed the space instinctually but caught himself at the last second.
“See? That’s what I’m talking about. Just, take things a bit more… casual.”
“Enough now,” Hannah intercepted. Castiel was glad he didn’t have to sit in the van that was parked a few meters down the street. Soon the air in that vehicle would be filled with hostility and the greasy smell of Chinese food, thick enough to choke on it.
“What do you work as?”
“Man, I was wondering who was behind that…”
The waitress dotted everything down, smiled, and then went on to place their order.
“Charlie?”
The tension between them right now was very different from the one there had been before. Every muscle in Castiel’s body was tense and he could see the green in the other man’s eyes harden and his teeth clench.
“We were set up.” The realization hit him like a bucket of icy water. Not-Robert was still laughing.
Robert’s eyes widened. He helped Castiel straighten himself again. “Apparently, neither are you.”
Castiel paused for a bit, still looking at Dean like he was an especially tricky jigsaw puzzle. “Are you perhaps a Disney prince in disguise?”
“Maybe it’s time you try out something new as well?” Castiel echoed what the other man had said before.
When he excused himself to use the toilet, he passed a table with three girls, who had been one of the ones throwing Castiel pitiful glances. He could hear one them whisper to her friends: “For someone like that I would have waited half an hour as well.”
Robert shot him a wink, leaving Castiel blushing without really knowing why. Robert was surprisingly curious and seemed to be eager to talk, which was Castiel’s luck. Only, something about the conversation still left a nervous flutter in his stomach. He wasn’t afraid the mission would fail, everything was going smoothly. He was… afraid he might embarrass himself in front of Robert by saying something stupid. Which was stupid. Robert was his target and Castiel was putting on a false persona. He forced the tension from his neck and shoulders. Robert was easy to talk to as it seemed. He should enjoy a conversation without awkward silences and focus on the mission.
“Kiddo, if that guy happens to wanna tap your cute little butt, you won’t get far with your wife and daughter.”
Now it was Dean’s turn to blush. It was just a tinge of pink on his throat, barely noticeable, while he stoically stared onto the street. Castiel was surprised to see him fumbling like that, after he’d paid his last compliment with so much confidence. But he supposed it was one thing to tell someone you find them attractive and another thing to admit that they look like your fictional childhood crush.
“Sorry, Hannah, but he speaks like a fucking robot. No offense.”
of March 1976, which makes me 32 years old. I moved to New York when I met my wife Amelia and I live with her and my daughter, Chrissi.”
“Well,” Dean shrugged, obviously trying to find an excuse, “I live near by and I was free tonight, so it wasn’t really a bother.”
“Castiel,” Dean echoed, trying out the strange name. He wasn’t the first to be confused upon hearing it for the first time, seeing as it wasn’t a very common name. “Even though we’ve known each other for… all this time now, Cas, I get the feeling that I don’t even really know you. Now, I don’t know if that’s because of my constant chattering, which doesn't leave the time to say a single word between to breaths of mine, but since I’m trying to change, I thought, why not lean back and you tell me a little something about yourself.”
Somewhere inbetween, they ordered their food and Castiel found out that Dean wasn’t just a good listener, he also had a healthy appetite, which he was obviously trying to mask. It was almost endearing to watch him try to slow down his eating.
Cas sat up quickly, pulling his hand from Dean’s. “Gabriel, you could start a mutiny.”
“No,” Castiel said slowly. “No, not at all. What happened when you came out of your room? Did you see or hear anyone? Or any other rooms?”
“Yeah. Lemme give you a quick tour. Living room,” Dean said, pointing to the sofa and TV, “office,” pointing to the desk beyond the sofa, “bathroom through that door, kitchen straight ahead, and bedroom,” he pointed to the queen-sized bed on the other side of the room. “Cozy, right?”
“What?”
“Sam can be immobile and patient better than you can, yes. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have other strengths, other ways to contribute.”
“You’re right. I wanted you to see something and I went about it the wrong way. So… You going to let me help now?”
“So where’d he go
“I was thinking maybe another archangel. There’s this one, the angel of solitude and tears…”
He felt Cas pull away just a bit, then grasp both their cocks in one hand. One very slick, slightly cool hand. The extra lube intensified every sensation, and as Dean lost himself to them, he felt a cool, wet finger trace down his crack and rub small circles at his hole. He tensed for a moment. He’d done this for a few women he’d been with, and they seemed to like it, but he never once expected to be on the receiving end. The waves of
Dean pictured a scenario without Cas. Of having the guy show up at his door that night, and turning him out onto the street. Of giving up the co-writing. Of how he felt when he was with Cas. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m up for it.”
Sam stilled, his hand on a bag of spinach leaves. “Yeah? What was it?”
“But it’d be you, Cas,” Dean said. “Just this-world-you, not you-you.”
“Gabe!” Dean shouted above his singing, which was at least in tune.
“It used to be imprisonment until they got registered,” Sam said. “But with the new law—”
“It’s more efficient. Go. Now.”
“Handy,” Dean observed. “You gonna eat with me?”
His thoughts were interrupted when Castiel awkwardly climbed over the seatback and landed in a very unangelic heap in the footwell. After several grunts and some more thrashing around, Dean’s vision was suddenly blocked by enormous black feathers.
“Hey, check this out,” Dean said, holding the rectangular strip of metal. He turned it around to show it off.
“Honest answers. Promise.”
Castiel turned away from where the adults and kids were talking to see Suicidal Dean standing next to him. “About what?”
Castiel nodded. “Yes.” He considered what he’d been told so far. “But how would they know? I don’t have papers. How would they even know I’m an angel? Maybe others haven’t been identified either.”
“Whoa-whoa-whoa… There are seven
Dean looked down and ran his hand over the back of his neck.
As Dean laughed softly in response, the fourth author stomped across the dais, ignoring them. He was an older man with glasses and salt-and-pepper hair, who sat down, then glared at them before examining the name card that Hester set in front of him. Dean caught the guy’s name on the card: Frank something.
“When do you find time to work on cars?” Mary asked. “In between hu—?
Castiel smiled at him, feeling a rush of compassion and love and sadness. This innocent child, who was so generous with his love, was shortly to suffer unimaginable losses and be asked to give up everything to save the world.
“Have you ever explored downstairs?”
“I’m…not really very good at the whole talking about feelings bit. Sorry I freaked out on you.” Dean shifted to make more space between himself and Cas.
“Aren’t we to love them? Help them? Cain was…familiar to me. As was his brother. I only wanted to help.”
“That it was stupid. And you should have talked to me first.”
love with someone?”
“Yeah. Sure.”
“Fine. I’ll be honest on one condition.”
One of the publishing executives stood at the head of the large rectangular table and made a few comments about how the well the company was doing, how proud he was to be bringing new books to the masses, and how pleased they all should feel to be part of the entire thing. Dean interpreted that to mean the publisher made a boatload of money that the authors would never see. Par for the course.
“I’m kind of a cake guy, myself,” Gabriel said, waggling his eyebrows at Sam. “Fancy a little angel food cake?”
Sam huffed a short laugh. “Well, that’s what I was going to ask you. What’s the best way to clean these things? They’ve got some sort of sticky stuff on them.”
Dean accepted his hand and stood, following him out of the room and wondering why he was holding Cas’ hand when he didn’t need to.
you back to your universe. That would do a disservice to you all, and I can see where there are ways I can help beyond offering you a way to return to your universe. It’s all about choices, remember?”
Sam peeked around the corner and saw Gabriel with his back to the doorway, his wings covering more skin than his clothes did. Sam handed him the shorts without a word and turned away, giving Gabriel the chance to put them on. He felt a tap on his shoulder and spun back around. The shorts hung down to Gabriel’s knees, and rested low on his hip bones. Gabriel’s bare torso revealed a lot more muscle than Sam was expecting, especially considering the angel’s penchant for candy. The brass mesh covering the implant looked like some sort of tribal jewelry against his skin.
“What is this, the 1950s?” Dean asked, sounding annoyed. “I don’t care who he loves, as long as he’s happy and safe. Emphasis on the happy and safe part.”
“I know you can, Dean. You’ll also probably put jalapeño peppers in it.”
“Do not call me that. And I’m not asking about… Why would you think I’m asking about you dating him? I’m asking what you have planned, why you’re being uncharacteristically pleasant to him.” A thought occurred to him and he allowed his suspicions to show on his face. “Are you trying to gain his trust so you can destroy it? I won’t let you do that. I won’t let—”
“I could,” Crowley said with a frown, considering the question. “But if she’s working with the Brits, then there’s greater risk to me, is there not? I’d require sufficient compensation.”
“Right.” Sam nodded once. “So that was the last thing
“What does that mean?”
Dean stomped his feet several times and stuck his gloved hands in his armpits. “Dude, it’s below freezing out here. Can we talk about this inside?”
“Dean, it’s…complicated. There are things about me you don’t know.”
Cas nodded solemnly, then leaned forward, his mouth brushing against Dean’s ear. “I want to feel you
“No.”
Following orders, Castiel sat in the chair, pushing down a rising panic that he didn’t understand.
“Three degrees?” Dean asked. “You realize I don’t have a compass?”
the way. Like, how do we move into it or through it?”
much pain?
“I don’t think we have a choice, Dean. I’m certain that the feather-breaking was to see if I’d react. An angel without an implant would be more likely to retaliate. We can count ourselves lucky that they aren’t yet scanning every angel for implants.”
“When we came here…” Jack continued, “the rift… I chose. I chose not to have anything to do with Lucifer. He’s
“No,” Cas said adamantly. “No, I will not participate in that. It’s…an exceedingly bad idea. It could get you killed.”
“I would love nothing more than to play with you,” Castiel said, “but I have some things I need to do as well. I need to find a helper who lives here.”
“My business in Heaven is a matter of duty,” Cas said, “not of preference. The same way you will leave to go on a hunt when you must. When no one else can do what you can do. And given what is happening now, I have no more reasons to return. There is nothing more I can do unless I burn out my grace trying to keep Heaven open. I may be ordered to do that, but I will not.”
Sam pushed himself off the wall. “Let’s do it. You want me to find a key, or—?”
“All of Cas’ books have some nod to the angel they’re about,” Dean added. “
After watching her leave, Dean turned back to Cas. “You want to stay and talk?”
“No…” Dean looked at him, confused. The more Castiel studied his face, the more he could see the child Dean. “This isn’t my room. I mean my room at home. With Mom and Dad. And there’s an angel on the shelf. My mom put it there. But it’s not real. And it has white wings, not like yours.” Dean ran his hand down the flight feathers again, then stopped near the tips. “Yours are almost black, ‘cept when you move, I can see all the colors of the rainbow in them. And down here,” he gently pet the tips with one finger, “this blue is the same color as your eyes.”
“Yes. I opened the jar and took all those parts back into me. Like tiny pieces of my grace. They’re not,” he added quickly, with a glance to Dean. “I’m no more powered now than before, but I feel different.”
Dean sat down at his desk. “What? What happened?”
“Okay.” Dean sniffled and wiped his nose on his sleeve. “You promise?”
“It’s not,” Dean said quickly. “I can tell you, it’s not true.”
“Jibril,” Castiel said, the name now feeling long-forgotten. “Gabriel. Of course. He’s…uh…dead now.”
“So we get him back to the bunker.”
Finding Bela was harder than Dean thought, considering her love for schmoozing with the publishing elite. She wasn’t at the bar, where it seemed all the important meetings took place, nor was she in the hospitality room. He finally called her mobile phone, asking to meet her in the hotel lobby near a large planter.
“No, not Ghostfacers. This was a legit investigation. I already talked to them. Texted last night and talked on the phone this morning. I ran down the history of the house, which didn’t turn up anything, ‘cause it was built in the 1980s. But get this: there was another house on the same site back in the early 1900s where a woman and infant died. House went from owner to owner, no one staying more than a year or two, until it finally was left vacant for a decade before it was razed and the new house built.”
“It takes a lot of people to create something like this, Dean. It’s not just a bunch of actors and a camera.”
“I want the pretty one!” another man shouted.
“What?”
,” Cas called out as he made his way toward the back. “
“Yeah, a little,” Sam said, still watching the credits. “You guys go ahead. I’ll join you when this is done.”
“Little louder for the human here, Cas.”
does date back to the samurai.”
Dean sat up a bit, looking at the clock on the nightstand. “Almost seven.”
“Yeah, that’s true. Even Isaac Asimov had some stories that were rejected and never even published. If he could have self-published, I’d be all over those stories.”
“Dean,” Cas said softly, squeezing Dean’s hand in his. “This is why we need to talk about when I was gone. It’s not Jack’s fault. It’s as much mine as anyone’s. And I’m back. I’m
Then they were gone, a couple of inches too far away. Cas licked his lips with the tip of his tongue and Dean’s thoughts immediately began to question whether Cas’ tongue might be as soft as a rose petal, or maybe softer because it was wet and hot and… Dean lunged forward, closing his eyes and pressing his lips to Cas’ again, moving them and feeling their softness, and then they were open a little and Dean licked into the space, feeling heat and an unidentifiable tingle.
“Aww, I only call you that because I love you. And right now, you need all the love you can get.”
“It worked?”
“Castiel. Sit.”
“I think I know what happened to your brother, Sam. I think the spell that was supposed to separate me from my vessel separated Dean’s mind. It’s fractured.”
seen you grieve someone like you did him. Not Dad. Not Bobby. Not even Mom, now.”
were the one with the problem… No, not a problem. Maybe more of a realization that was similar to what Dean saw as a problem. Sam stopped and exhaled sharply. A realization that, the more Sam thought about it, was true.
“Then we’ll…I don’t know…take it easy for a few days. I could probably use the rest too. I’ve pretty much exhausted the research angle. That’s why I originally came in here. I thought maybe you could see what you were capable of now that the cuffs are off. But that can wait a bit. Maybe we can just…talk.”
“I’m not very hungry.”
“So, one thing the US government never took into consideration when designing those implants?” Gabriel waggled his eyebrows. “The surge of grace in an archangel’s truly epic orgasm. Or…well…two of them, actually.
“Oh, thank God,” Sam said, overwhelming relief leaving him fatigued.
“Still. I think I would feel better if I kept a small amount. Enough to remind me of who and what I am.”
“We haven’t exactly talked to him yet,” Dean said, glaring at Sam. “But he’s been having some really bad flashbacks. Sam thinks maybe this will help.”
No steam. No hissing. No pain. Not a demon.
Dean swallowed so loudly, Castiel could hear it. “What if… What if I want more than friendship?”
Dean caught Gabriel watching the exchange thoughtfully, but let it go. It wasn’t any of Gabriel’s business. Instead, he took another slice of bread and lost himself in the taste of butter and garlic.
“Of course.” Castiel returned to the chair and pulled out his phone, tapping away.
“Dude. I
“You knocked,” Sam said, stating the obvious while stepping aside to let Michael in.
Castiel looked up to see Dean standing in his doorway. “Dean?”
“Good. That’s good.” Gabriel came closer and sat awkwardly, one hip on the edge of Sam’s bed. He watched quietly for a few moments. “What’s going on? You’ve got a bunch of questions you’re not letting yourself ask.”
Cas rolled his shoulders. “I didn’t. Life imitates art?”
“Oh, I’m not surprised by that.”
“Yep. I was super lucky that Julian started accepting new clients again. He started that agency back in the late 70s, then brought Luke on in the mid-80s, and the new guy about ten years ago.”
“What’s the last thing you remember, Dean?” Castiel asked.
“Cas!” Dean called out, clutching Castiel’s arms with his hands. His body tightened and he groaned as he began to shake, and then Castiel felt an eruption of heat and energy from Dean as his euphoria overtook him.
“Yes,” Mary agreed after swallowing a bite of waffle. “I’d definitely like to know.”
“Dean’s feeling under attack from the somewhat anti-legacy-publishing group,” Cas explained.
“Still wanna use ‘em,” Dean said with a half-smile.
Cas snuggled closer then, his nearly human body warm against Dean’s chest, and that…whatever it was, whether Cas’ grace or some part of his essence, snuggled up in the pie-thing in his head, radiating love and happiness. And peace.
A knock on his door interrupted his reverie. He went to the door and opened it, already knowing who was on the other side. “Hello, Dean.”
“You’re gonna be fine, Cas. He just wants to meet you. What happened to not caring what other people thought of you?”
“Sam’s right,” Dean added. “Last thing we need is you going all
“No, not Jack. Just you, Castiel. Come here.”
know that feeling. Me, Dean, Cas.”
“Well, I choose to go the hell back,” Dean said.
“It’s not—” Cas shook his head. “Angels don’t have foreplay.”
“No, I kinda knew somethin’ was off, after you weren’t the pizza guy. I can’t remember when I ordered pizza last. I can’t remember eating anything other than those Hot Pockets. I don’t know what day it is, or how long Dad’s been gone. And you an’ I’ve been talking all this time and Sammy hasn’t woken up. He’s not even really here, is he?”
“Yeah, I’ll color with you,” Tween Dean said to his younger counterpart. “Lemme tell you about X-Men.”
“But still…that was…”
“What is it, Dean?” Cas asked.
Dean grinned as he hung up. He washed his face and double-checked his hair, then consulted his watch again. He was fairly certain he’d seen a fax machine in the business office, which he’d pass on the way to the ballrooms. Maybe he could get these documents off to Sam before his panel. And then he had to go be a cheerleader for the Big Five New York publishing houses, right when he felt the worst about them. A sudden thought had him hurrying toward the door. Cas had said he’d be on that panel too.
“This. A lot more of this.”
Dean started to argue. The very fact that Gabriel was in jail, mostly helpless—the whole reason they were on this trip in the first place—was due to forces beyond their control, forces that could overpower Cas if they didn’t stay vigilant.
“He asked. Kinda anxious, actually. Like he thought I was gonna say no. I did tell him I wasn’t dragging his nightstand back in if this was a one-off.”
Dean winced. “We gotta get you versed in some slang. But later. No condom.”
“No, Dean. The cereal was for you. Sam is making something for you to drink, but it doesn’t taste very good, I’m told.”
“I am not. But we got things to do. People to save. All that.”
“Like…I did what I could to heal you.”
The warmth disappeared in an instant and Dean heard the bunker door open. “You can come back in, Dean.” As he returned inside, Cas added, “Remember what you smelled.”
“Still out. I keep asking Gabe to check on him, but he says Cas is fine. It’s just takin’ a long-ass time. Hey, when you’re better, I need you to do your research magic and figure out how to open those cuffs Gabe’s got. And Cas wants to figure out how to disengage the implant, somehow get word to all the angels.”
Castiel pondered this. “If the door was locked, how did you know it was an office?”
“Jack,” Sam said, relieved. “You’re safe.”
“Dude, you don’t know what X-Men is?”
The sensations ceased abruptly when Dean folded his wing back in. “This one’s all good to go,” Dean announced, dragging the chair back over to the other side of the bed before he started in on the other wing.
“Can you help us get home?” Jack asked.
Cas grinned. “What the readers don’t know yet—but we do—is that it’s the archangel Raphael, whose name means ‘healing of God,’ who is healing and rescuing people who would otherwise die in order to gain their pledge of loyalty for a war he plans to wage on earth.”
“You were raised to be a hammer, right? A dutiful soldier? So, it makes sense that you’d think that’s what makes you worthy. And yeah, at first, that was what I thought. That you’d be a great asset to have on our side. But you gotta know, man, that’s not what I think anymore.” Dean raised his hand to Cas’ cheek, his thumb stroking gently. “Whatever we need to do, to keep you safe.” He smiled, then lowered his hand.
“Road trip!” Lover Dean joked. “And when it’s time to deal with the demon part, I’m helping.”
“Which one?” Sam asked.
“She could have been a lot more polite.”
Dean reached one hand out cautiously, then lightly pet the long flight feathers. His confidence seemed to grow with each stroke along Castiel’s wing, and he moved his way up the wing toward the upper arch.
ROYALTIES: CAN CAS ACTUALLY EARN TWICE AS MUCH AS DEAN?
“Nonsense,” the cosmic entity retorted. “He can’t even sleep correctly. Has to be up and yapping his mouth, the ingrate.”
“My room?” Dean asked, as if he hadn’t heard Castiel correctly.
“I remember that one,” Cas said. “Turned out a serial killer was the organ donor, and you used cell memory science to show that the need to kill survived the transplant. That was really well-written.”
“What does self-discipline have to do with this?” Sam asked.
Castiel settled back into the side-to-side movement, wondering what would come up this time. The symbol referred to as a
“No, Sam. All the trauma started with Azazel. You are not to blame.”
bunker, but it doesn’t always work. And these,” he gestured to the angel blade in his lap and the rows of guns and knives hanging on his wall, “aren’t real either.”
“I’m already regretting it,” Dean said softly.
“Dude.” He pulled Cas around to look at the table. “Do not tell me I just hallucinated Farmer Guy.”
Dean watched through the rearview mirror as all three shrugged. “Get some rest, Sammy. I’ll get us a couple rooms and you can have your beauty sleep.”
Letting out a long exhale, Dean made his way across the road toward where Sam was.
Castiel had been to Hell and back—more than once—seen and experienced torture, killed numerous humans and fellow angels, even allowed Lucifer to use his vessel, but only now did he fully understand the word
“I need to introduce you to some of the other parts.”
“I know.” Cas gave him a lopsided grin. The guy was dressed casually in a linen sport coat over a graphic t-shirt and worn jeans. “I’m a big fan of your Beast Hunters series. The one with the leviathan,
“Now’s not a good time, Cas.”
“…lied…” Cas mumbled, starting to thrash about.
The weird sniffing behavior went on for another two weeks, except for the few days when Dean and Sam had left to deal with a small vampire nest in Missouri, until one morning when Cas didn’t immediately return inside. When he finally did, he skipped down the steps with a lightness that Dean hadn’t seen in…well, a long time. He came straight for Dean, again taking him by the elbow and tugging him toward the door.
“Why not? It’s never bothered you before.”
“I can live with that. But I can only hold this open for about two weeks. If it looks like you’re stalling, or you’re not going to sign, we might have to exercise our at-will clause.” Bela looked at him level. “I want to be clear about this, Dean.”
At first Dean thought he was still seeing shadows as something darker materialized within the flickering, but as the flickering continued to slow down, it became more solid.
“But I’m just making everything worse.”
“Angels are all about strategy,” Gabriel corrected. “It’s the end game that counts. Choice was never a problem. Picking a different end game is another story. Do you know how much it sucks to have an end game picked out for you and no other game options?”
“You learn that in samurai-sword-training?”
“Or,” Sam said with a shrug, hoping he wasn’t insulting Cas’ father or something, “whomever there is to thank.”
“Then how can I help?”
“I’ll check. And…” Sam flung his hands out to the sides. “Jack took off. I don’t know where he is. But he’s convinced he’s going to hurt us all, so he’s staying away to…I don’t know, to protect us, I guess. He thinks he’s evil just because of who his birth father is.”
