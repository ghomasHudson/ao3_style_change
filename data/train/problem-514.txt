Sherlock flushed, looking chagrined and caught out in equal measure. His fingers flapped uselessly behind him while he stepped away and began to pace, adding to the line of faded threads already present in one straight swathe on the rug.
Meanwhile, the halls echoed with sound, merging with the percussive blasts and deafening outbursts of their enemy. The ground and doors vibrated with the strength of the explosions and the wailings of the dead and dying.
Is that it?” He glanced from one Alpha to the next, neither of them meeting his eyes. Sherlock especially seemed completely engrossed in studying the faded pattern on the rug beneath his large feet. “That
to know? How – how do I live my life without a basic, core understanding of myself?” John sounded desperate, even to himself.
“Lestrade, I believe this murder and the murder of several other young, male, latent Omegas over the last several months are linked. I believe they all participated in the same fertility study, and I believe those that conduct this study prey on the homeless to stay undetected and, until now, practically invisible.”
The battle begins.
“John H. Watson,” a surprising tenor for a man of such size. “Please get in the car.”
“You’ve been injured since your change, John, there’s no telling what effect that might have on your new biology.”
“I don’t tolerate intruders in my mind, nor do I tolerate imbeciles. State your purpose or
“Hello Molly, I’m John, er, Dr. John Watson.” His smile was genuine as he took her hand, giving it a gentle shake. Her skin was soft; her bones fine and bird-like and John instantly wondered if she had a bloke.
“Something funny?” Major Sholto’s firm voice pierced through John’s self-satisfied reflections.
“Naww, d’you really fink they’d ‘elp the like’s o’ me? Is sum’ new study I saw on sum’ piece o’ paper.”
,” he whispered absently, closing his eyes and remembering the video from what seemed like so long ago. Of course they had known all of this beforehand, but they had no clue as to the results, as to what
Affecting a tremulous smile, he followed all of their ridiculous orders, including sticking out his tongue, sitting upright, and reacting to every command given during his neurological tests. For someone of his intelligence, it was no great feat to fudge a few of the results and watch with glee as the medics furrowed their brows and spoke lowly amongst each other. Sally Donovan was included in the hushed conversations, absently rubbing the side of her temple as if fighting off a massive headache.
The first thing that registered in the blond’s hormone addled mind was Sherlock’s heated, humid breath against his right thigh. Then his tongue, oh
She passed the specimen to Sherlock, who handled it with unusual care. It was fascinating. The tawny-coloured clump of tissue bobbed and swayed, suspended in the liquid as the brunet turned the container to and fro.
…completely within reason, knowing where he was and why he was there.
“I found it inside…th-the alarm was going off, making a right racket. I didn’t want the police to have it. I know you gave it to him. I helped him with it you know, at the beginning.”

Now that John was free to wander around the flat as he wished, he finally managed to get a good look at the kitchen.
“Explain this to me first.”
She was effortlessly beautiful; the kind of person one saw not in modern-day magazines, but in black and white celluloids from the thirties, ethereal and poised, the line of her lipstick so perfectly blood red one would swear it could cut glass.
“I need you to answer me, Private.” Sholto raised a large roughened hand, gently grasping John’s chin between his thumb and the padding on the side of his thick index finger. John felt rooted to the spot, dazed, unable to reconcile the fluttering in his abdomen, let alone something as complicated as language.
“Oh! John!” the brunette straightened, her voice brighter and sounding less tired and more animated with John’s increased stirring, “you’re awake! Everyone will be so pleased.” She closed the booklet from which she was reading, but not before John could glean the title. Somehow it didn’t surprise him that Molly would choose to read passages from the Journal of Clinical Pathology to him whilst he was unconscious. The thought made him smile, though his lips were dry and cracked, she was eternally charming, this Miss Hooper.
Marcus had given John companionship, safety, and even love, during a time when John could count on nothing but his own skills and street smarts. John couldn’t help feel that he deserved
sure it matches the others?” The Alpha swept his gaze over John’s small body, taking in his clothing and demeanour, and probably reading all of his inner most secrets at the same time. He turned on one heel and sauntered into the kitchen in that uncomplicated way of his, as if he were untouchable, above it all. John followed.
Well, since this day was just chock-full of new experiences and revelations, he supposed a visit to his mind palace wouldn’t be out of order. He climbed back atop his bed, gingerly (no use in flopping anymore, not unless he wanted to break a bone), resting on his back and closing his eyes. There were a great many things that needed to be categorised and stored, not the least of which was how he would ever get back at his brother for forcing him into this horrid, stone-aged excuse for a retreat.
No. Something was amiss, and John Watson’s scent was beginning to change.
He would have stood in that hallway forever; he would have gripped John’s smaller shoulders with each large hand and
John didn’t blame her. After meeting Sherlock, he knew the power inherent in an apex. This was one of nature’s cruel tricks…one of the many evolutionary pitfalls that kept the Omega’s subservient and bred, popping out babies and leaving them doe-eyed and compliant in the face of reproductive slavery, essentially. Of course, John had never personally experienced true Omega social bias, but as a latent, his less than stellar treatment was more subtle. It was more insinuation and prejudice, comments under the breath and long, cold stares. It didn’t help that apex Alpha’s themselves were a world unto their own. They were almost always rich or royal, coming from old bloodlines with old money and expected all the worshipful treatment that came with that social status. For all that Omega’s were the life-givers of the world; they didn’t have much in the way of autonomy or political rights. It was bloody unfair, the army doctor thought bitterly.

“Sherlock! Listen, this is important!”
“Car accident,” Mr. Chandler offered, “Marcus was hit by a drunk driver on Christmas Eve about two years ago. His job required he live in the city, so he was on his way to Hertfordshire to visit us.”
Disclaimer: Same as it always is!
“Am I, though?”
A sharp jolt of nerves sung down the Alpha's spinal cord as he moved his head to connect foreheads with his Omega (well, not his exactly, but soon…
“Stop it, Molly. Stop…” he waved one long-fingered hand dramatically near her face, “stop mooning about.” Sherlock’s rumbling baritone admonished, grabbing her attention and ridding her almost instantly of impure (and horribly inappropriate) daydreams, “and please do your job. Need I remind you what’s at stake here?”
It was different when he came back from Afghanistan; though he was battered and scarred, he still had a bit of hope. He thought maybe he could find a modest place and practice medicine again…and even though that would never fill the constant hollowness in his heart, he figured he could make it work. He wasn’t very old (if you count 35 very old); he was a bit too skinny now but still in good health.
The apex Alpha nodded briskly, lips blanching as he pressed them into a thin white line.
“Come again?”
Mycroft listened to her words with only half concentration (though for any normal person that would be enough), the other half absorbing the steady bleating of Sherlock’s heart through the monitor, pumping despite all efforts to the contrary.
begun working together?
John sighed, worrying, glancing towards the fireplace and wishing for all the world that there was a fire.
Silence. John patted him again. Sherlock glared and John jerked his head towards molly again. “What else?”
Sherlock let out a steadier chuckle this time, so John felt safe asking him if he could get the cloth and aloe from the fridge where he’d left them to chill.
The other man finished dressing and nodded at the two of them on his way out.
Mycroft put his cup down and twirled his umbrella. He looked at no one. “Thanks to Sherlock’s unprecedented maturity…” Sherlock snorted, and they ignored him, “we have been given the opportunity to avert disaster. You are unaware of the danger of your well-intentioned offer, John. Those of us who have preceded you in the endeavour to keep Sherlock clean, stand in admiration of your skill. We were never as successful as you have been in such a short period of time. However, in part due to our repeated failures, we did learn certain lessons the hard way, which we may now pass on to you. The most important of these is that the consequences for Sherlock’s behavior must be determined in advance and must be carried out at all costs, no matter what subsequent conditions may evolve. Sherlock, may I illustrate, with your assistance?”
“And what will I do?”
More nodding. John put the paddle down and laid his hand gently on the heated skin.
Sherlock: Good evening, Wilder. Brother?
Sherlock pushed back against the tickling wetness, trying to draw John further inside of him. John hummed and Sherlock’s hips started to move in no discernible pattern, making it difficult for John to focus his lingual attentions, so he resorted to broad, flat swipes, which Sherlock had no objections to. When John’s tongue wore out, he pulled away and Sherlock whined in complaint. John gave him a swat and said, “Patience, you greedy thing.” In response, Sherlock waggled his arse as alluringly as he knew how, which was unnecessary, because anything he did with his arse sent John’s blood coursing southward.
“What’s happened?” no formal greeting being necessary.
He laughed.
After 8 chapters of having his ass whupped, poor Sherlock wants to top because anything else is gonna hurt. Also, John is happy to switch because he's exhausted, so skip this chapter if it's not your thing. Sherlock will be back on the bottom next time.
“Yeah,” said John, “bloody hell.”
Sherlock shut up.
“You don’t like feeling like that.”
I promised.-- JW
John read to himself.
John kissed him lightly on his shoulder blade. “You might be holding on a little too tightly to your dignity, darling. You’re going to have to lighten up a bit if you’re going to get through this.”
John smiled and turned away to put his jacket on. The wet spots triggered another wince. “This is disgusting.”
John lifted his eyebrows and said, “If you can’t think of anything, I can just keep on—” and he stuck out his tongue like he was trying to catch a falling snowflake.
“Yes, sir.”
Sherlock was trying to ease himself onto the cushion to see if his bum could tolerate it, and he looked at him in disbelief.
He scooped up some of the ointment and began to work it into Sherlock’s rear. When he tensed up at the first touch, John put his hand on the small of his back, trying to soothe him a bit. It helped and Sherlock breathed deeply and started to relax. He let out a couple of groans but John couldn’t tell if they indicated pain or pleasure. He steadily moved his fingers in circular patterns moving from right to left and shifting as necessary to cover all the colored areas. He spent extra time on his sit spots, which were, to be honest, leaning more towards red than pink. He made a mental note to avoid them during the next go-round. “Do you think you could tolerate a cold pack?” he asked. There was no answer and John heard the even breathing that meant that Sherlock had fallen back to sleep again. John kissed him in the dip between his back and hip and left him to pass the time free of pain. The more time he was sleeping during this period, the easier it would be for both of them.
I will be there in 13 minutes. JW is not to proceed until that time. Are you growing up, Little Brother ? MH
“Ow! What was that for?”
She didn’t take any guff. “It’s not your bum, I’d worry about if I were you, young man. It’s your ego. Now go behave yourself properly and I’ll see you Monday.”
Sherlock shook his head and pointed downwards toward his feet with his finger, careful not to pull on the thread. John twisted around and saw Sherlock’s cock standing at half-mast and swelling quickly. He looked back at Sherlock, breathing rather heavily himself, and gave him a fierce kiss, sweeping his tongue deep into his mouth and then tugging on his lower lip with his teeth. He growled at him. “God, you’re perfect. I can’t be this lucky.” He bit the side of his neck, sucking hard enough to bring a whimper from Sherlock, then then kissed him again. He went back to work. He fixed Sherlock’s left arm to match the right and let him wiggle around testing his range of motion.
John said, “Say it. Tell me if this is ok or not.”
Sherlock looked slightly nervous. “I, uh, didn’t want to wake you to ask if you would consider this an experiment, but I’m trying to write some music without actually hearing it. A melody came to me and I didn’t want to lose it, but…grounded, no violin, oh, you know…. It won’t be the same, but I was curious to see if I could capture it without actually hearing it. Is that…I mean, it’s not actually a real scientific…more of a musical exercise, if you think about it…”
“Obviously whatever’s faster.” He gave an epic eyeroll. “Honestly John, do I have to think of everything?” He was back to his arrogant self, despite the lingering soreness in his arse.
John made shushing noises.
He answered, “Later, I think. I’ll be having more trouble focusing then. And I’d like to get Mycroft’s letter done. Not sure I’ll be able to come up with 500 apologetic words, honestly.”
He pulled Sherlock up by the shoulder and put his arms around him. Sherlock latched on with one arm, running his fingers carefully over the welts rising up on his bottom with the other. John let him cry into the side of his neck for a few minutes.
“What’s the trouble tonight, Featherweight?”
Where the hell are you? –JW
“It’s Friday, the evening of Mycroft’s which is least likely to be taken up with the minutiae of a diminished empire. And where do you suppose he would spend such an evening?” he asked in his insufferably superior, ‘why are you all so vacant’ tone.
One thing at a time. He reached for his wallet, but the cabby held up a fistful of notes and jerked his head towards the car, which had followed them. “The lovely lady has already taken care of it, mate. I’d be happy to hang around a bit, in case you need me again,” he added hopefully.
“And when he couldn’t find you this afternoon, what was he thinking?”
And to Tiaoconnell, send much internet love for continuing to serve as an overly generous, and expert beta, and all around good buddy.
Kasseem was a decent looking chap, but Raul was beyond fit. He had straight brown hair, parted on the side, revealing a wide forehead. A few stray locks peeked out from behind his neck and over his ears, giving the impression that he was probably overdue a couple of weeks for a haircut. It provoked the impulse to tuck them away. His winged eyebrows gave him a soft, open expression. Under his straight narrow nose, he had the shadow of a mustache and beard, which failed to disguise his youthful appearance. He was positively lush.
The next time there was a dearth of cases, John could tell by week three, that Sherlock would be heading for the gym. At odd moments he would shift from side to side or bounce on his toes, tells he didn’t even know he had. That morning in bed, John whispered in his ear, “Do you think you’ll want some takeaway after the gym tonight, or should I eat without you?” with a smile, which he half-heartedly tried to hide. It pushed buttons for Sherlock, to hear John make deductions, which, of course, John knew. Sherlock’s eyes opened wide and he rolled over on top of him and snogged him with vigor unusual for early morning. John indulged him smugly. When he was allowed to come up for breath, he rolled Sherlock back over, underneath him and said, “You think you’re the only one who can make deductions, brilliant boy?” Nibble on the lower lip. “All secret and mysterious you think you are.” Suck on the neck under the corner of his jaw. “I can read you like a book.” Squeeze of his nipple.
“Ow, alright I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.” His eyebrows furrowed and his already somewhat creaky morning voice lowered in pitch and volume. “It’s just that you’ve kept me clean for 46 days now and,” he took a deep breath, “I’m afraid.”
“Better be the only one too.” When he finished, he returned the supplies to the medicine chest and returned to find Sherlock resting on his side, on the floor by the side of the bed, with his dressing gown thrown artfully over his hip.
She gave them a very cheeky smile and looked back and forth between them. “Oh never mind,” she said knowingly, “I see.”
“Do you want me to pee in a glass?”  Sherlock asked stoically.
“Oh, hush. I’ll warm you up in a second.” When he finished, John tossed it into the loo and crawled in beside him. He was wrapped up in Sherlock’s limbs in a moment and they fell asleep.
“And then he blames me when he has to activate his divisions and lackeys and equipment to rescue me.” He rolled his eyes at the last bit. “I don’t need rescuing. I didn’t ask him to rescue me. Why should I be grateful for something I didn’t want in the first place? And to have to apologize? He should have minded his own business and I wouldn’t have to apologize! If it’s such a horrible imposition or waste of his, or should I say, the Empire’s resources to clear up after what he considers to be my messes, he’s more than welcome to sod off permanently. He’s pried and butted in from the beginning and I don’t need him trying to save my life every—“
Sherlock said, “It’s time, isn’t it.” It wasn’t actually a question. John scratched his fingernails against his scalp a little bit.
“Say it again. What do you have to do?”
“And what did Mrs. Hudson do?”
Even before they were what they became, Sherlock had hardly been a modest man. Whether he had been unaware or intentionally provocative, covering up had never been a priority. Sheets, dressing gowns, bits flashing, they were all of no concern. This was completely different. The way John was staring at him, Sherlock was sure that if he held up his magnifying lens, John’s gaze would set him on fire.
“I’m glad I came too. Sorry if I was short with you.”
He tilted his head and nodded again slowly. “What if she tries to hug me, or kiss my cheek?”
While Sherlock was in the loo, John made sure the bedroom was ready. He changed the sheets, made sure they had all the supplies they might need for aftercare and the activities afterwards. He set his book by the chair for the period when he’d have to keep his eye on Sherlock during his corner time. Sherlock was out and wrapped in his blue silk robe with a towel around his neck, by the time he finished. John took the towel and made a couple of more swipes at his hair.
“Before you put anything on, let me see your arse. Maybe I can put on some analgesic ointment. Numb the pain while we’re out.”
Sherlock dutifully modeled and John imitated. Or attempted to.
“I’m in charge, remember?”
Sherlock lifted his eyelids up a bit and in his little voice, said, “Can I have the ugly oatmeal one?”
Right. He bent to his work, properly motivated. After 30 minutes or so, Sherlock said, “Just about done.” John had been working on the preparations but took his time, dawdling over the celery and onions, wanting to reward Sherlock’s diligence with the chicken’s remains and it was worthwhile. When he finally finished with a flourish he joined John and peppered him with questions about the anatomical analogies of domesticated fowl relative to Homo Sapiens and the proper Latin names for every structure he neatly isolated with the carving knife. John livened up the discussion by trying to recall who he’d been shagging during that particular section of the medical school curriculum: Diana, adorable little blonde during neurology, Janie, cardiovascular, Marilyn the entire two semesters of renal and musculoskeletal systems, etc.
At minute 18, he started shifting his weight from one foot to another and John said, “Hold still. That’s twice now. If you fidget again, I’m going to add time on.” At 19 minutes, 30 seconds John watched him carefully. Sure enough, at the stroke of 20 minutes, 4 seconds, he saw a minuscule tilt of Sherlock’s head, and John knew he had been keeping time, expecting a repeat of his last 20-minute session.
Sherlock arranged himself, pulling up his dressing gown, prepared for inspection. John noted with satisfaction that the redness and bruising was much reduced. The satisfaction dissipated as he tightened his grip on the handle of the cane.
John hummed and tilted his hips a little bit higher and Sherlock pushed in gently, then further, then deeply. He twisted around a bit, but John looked down at him, flinching a little and said, “Careful there. No need to worry about finding the spot. I’m played out. You go on and enjoy yourself.”
No verbal response was forthcoming, just a vague sort of glance in his direction, so John took back the tissues and did his best to wipe away the evidence of the celebration left smeared all over Sherlock’s arse. He did his best, but tissues were not going to do the job. He weighed the relative value of searching Sherlock’s gym bag for a towel, but he was a bit wobbly and John didn’t want to leave him standing by himself.
John just held him just like that for a while, until his shoulder went numb and he worried that Sherlock might actually fall asleep in that position. He repeated, “You’re alright now. You’re going to be fine. Come have a lie down on the bed, and I’ll take care of you.” Sherlock lifted his head and looked blearily at John, then turned so he could put his feet on the floor. John stood up after him and tugged him toward the head of the bed. He gave him a slight push onto the mattress and Sherlock went to his hands and knees and collapsed, sprawled diagonally. John grabbed the flannel and wrung it out in a bowl of water. “I’m going to try to cool you off a little bit.” He laid it gently across his bum and Sherlock startled off the bed, hissing at the sting. “Sorry, it will feel better in a moment.” Sherlock settled again and John rubbed circles into Sherlock’s lower back until he felt that the coolness had gone out of the flannel and he repeated the procedure until Sherlock was tolerating the contact. On this night, John used aloe gel to cool the sting, less concerned about bruising.
John: Sit early. Asthma Goodbye.
Billy had a new throwaway phone apparently. Damn, damn, damn. Maybe it was a good sign. Brixton was the closest spot to find a dealer. Maybe that wasn’t where he was headed. He texted Lestrade to let him know that Crosley was still a possibility and seconds later Mrs. Hudson reported that he wasn’t at home.
Finally showing the dawning realization that he was in fairly serious trouble, Sherlock quailed, then recovered himself to launch into a rapid-fire explanation. “Y-y-you have to understand, John, it had been quiet all day and then those barbaric, hulking proto-humans started clattering and thumping and crashing into the room with radios crackling and shrieking static and I couldn’t think anymore and the wardrobe was within three strides and it was almost time for you to come and I didn’t think I would get lost in the dark in there and then I fell asleep and…”
It was a quiet day, Sherlock still cheerful and riding the wave of endorphins that the successful closing of a case brought him. John wrote up a first draft for the blog, asking Sherlock for details and prolonging the serenity by stroking his ego. The praise and admiration was well deserved. Sherlock tried to disguise his delight, but John knew the tells: a slight dipping of his head, the smile downturned at the corners, and an embarrassed little shrug of his shoulders. John cherished every one of them. It was so rare to see him enjoy himself like an ordinary person. He played his violin, stole John’s laptop when he could, and puttered around his microscope, sneaking petri dishes into the fridge when he thought John wasn’t looking. They watched the usual crap telly and went to bed.
Sherlock reached around behind him and felt his arse gingerly, flinching at the heat and sting.
Tuesday Night
When John’s eyes flew open at his regular time, Sherlock was still latched on, though he was on his side now. John detached himself, brushed his teeth and went to boil the kettle. He’d need something to keep up his strength till Sherlock was ready for a formal meal. He didn’t want to let him sleep too long. It would interfere with the early bedtime that was on the schedule. He munched on one of the scones that was left from the day before and rummaged in the fridge. Milk and eggs. Thank God. He didn’t want to run to the shop and have Sherlock wake up alone. He was going to be very fragile and dependent until this was all over and John didn’t want to leave without letting him know. He chopped up some leftover bits of onion and tomato, cutting out the brown spots, and mixed the egg and milk for an omelet. He took a quick look at the blog, then went to wake Sherlock. John massaged his shoulders and neck until he stirred.
“We made a mess, you know,” he said as he lifted up a bit, but Sherlock pulled him back down.
WARNING AND SPOILER:
“Stop stalling. What is the plan for delivering Mycroft’s letter?”
Do you have a visual?—MH
They had worked out a protocol for these session based on both of their experiences in formal settings, John in the Army and Sherlock at public school and after conferring with Ella. Her single most helpful clarification was that relationships were not meant to be fair, they’re meant to work. So far things were working. John had discovered that the stoicism and mental control that enabled Sherlock to survive the far too many bouts of actual physical torture he’d suffered were counterproductive to effective domestic discipline. Sherlock could detach himself from extreme physical pain and the first few attempts to bring him to a place of remorse failed miserably. A purely physical punishment did not affect his thinking or his heart and he considered it a victory to withstand John’s best efforts. They ended with both of them feeling more frustrated than when they started, with no resolution and no purpose served.
He searched for John, hopping from side-to-side and clapping his gloves together. When he found his eyes, he grinned with an open smile and John headed towards him, schooling his face, determined not to spoil this moment of joy for him. He stepped close, intending to hug him, but Sherlock held him at arm’s length. “You don’t want to embrace me, now, John. I’m dripping sweat.”
And then, “I see.”
Sherlock’s shoulders relaxed almost imperceptibly but he muttered, “Sentiment,” in disgust. “Honestly, Geoff, haven’t I told you countless times I despise physical contact? Come along John, no time to waste.”
Can you explain to him that we want him to be a good man for us? That it doesn’t matter if he disappoints us? We’re all human, we all wind up disappointing each other. What matters is that he doesn’t
As John started on his panna cotta, Sherlock stood to pick up the plates and John asked him, “No dessert for you?” Sherlock said, “I’ll have something later. You finish eating.” He cleared the dishes from the table and John stood to join him for the washing up, but Sherlock stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. He said, “Stay there. I’m still hungry.” He proved his point by leaning over him with a ravenous look. He kissed him, sliding his tongue right into John’s mouth. It was the kiss of a starving man and it sucked the breath out of both of them. Once John was gasping, Sherlock pushed the chair away from the table with John’s help. He slipped gracefully to his knees in front of him and laid his hands on the top of John’s thighs. He stroked them up and down, looking up from under his lashes and scraping his lower lip with his teeth.
“Ow! What was that for?”
"Tomorrow”
“This is the last bit, love. Do you want them spaced out or all at once?” John wasn’t sure he would be able to answer. “Do you want me to decide?”
John had to admit it was spectacularly colored and while he was sympathetic, this was a man who wore the scars of Serbian brutality on his back, who had been stabbed, shot, and knocked unconscious countless times. He rolled his eyes just a little and said, in a singsong whisper, just loud enough to be heard, “Drama queen.”
“Well. You could just let her cry. Just stand there and be with her while she cries. So she knows that you know that she’s…whatever she is. She might cry because she’s happy that you’re safe, or because your letter makes her sad, or she might just feel like crying. Sometimes you don’t know why. Just be brave enough to be with her if she cries.”
Sherlock squirmed and fidgeted, but John let it pass. Greg hmmphed, choked back a laugh, glared at Sherlock at one point and finished the letter. He placed it on the desk and flipped to a new page in the notepad lying there and scribbled something. Sliding his finger down the letter, he paused then wrote something else on the pad. He folded it thoughtfully and returned it to the envelope. He stood for a moment then turned to his filing cabinet. He shuffled through the drawer and pulled a bulging folder out partway, then slipped the envelope inside. He looked at Sherlock and said, “Right then.” He looked at John next and they nodded at one another.
The lull was interrupted by Mrs. Hudson’s singing, “Ooh-hoo,” as she came up the stairs. John checked his watch. It was lunchtime. He put the papers aside and met her at the door, to relieve her of whatever nourishment she had brought; sandwich makings from a leftover roast. John’s mouth watered. Sherlock emerged from the bedroom, his hair deliciously tousled and his sheet wrapped around him. He yawned. “Must you be so cheery, Mrs. Hudson?” he asked disgustedly.
Sherlock stared at him and nodded. John tickled over his ribs, and whispered in his ear, “Rule number two.”
"Did Mycroft ever blame you for one of his scrapes? No, ‘cause of course he was Mycroft. He never had any. If I had to bet, your mum would tell us how many times he tried to take the blame for yours, right?” Sherlock lowered his eyes and stayed quiet. “He saved your arse at school too, didn’t he? Did he talk them out of caning you? Expelling you? How many times did they want to kick you out?”
“For not trusting me. I told you, once the punishment is over, it’s over. I’m not leaving you to suffer alone. I’m not going to tolerate anything that will undermine your grounding, but I’ll cuddle you and snuggle you as much as you like.”
John continued reading:
John hoped he would crack open soon. He didn’t want to bruise him on the first night.
John had slumped into a kitchen chair and was staring off at nothing. “You were in the wardrobe. Asleep. While we were terrified that you were filling your veins with poison.”
Sherlock was reaching round behind him trying to ease the sting and color was rising on his cheeks.
“Jack, this is John, Sherlock’s husband. Finally came round for a visit.”
Sherlock turned away smiling but refused to make eye contact. “Promise?” He opened his locker and took out his clothes. “Will you go out to the machine and get me a bottle of water, anyway? Because you love me?” He turned towards him with a mockingly sad smile. John looked down with a rueful grin. He pointed at him and left him to get dressed.
Sherlock smirked in a dazed kind of way at him. “You can borrow mine.”
John sat back with his arms crossed, thoroughly pleased with himself. “Just give up, Sherlock. Not even you will be able to figure it out.”
“I’m afraid I’ve smeared…fluids all over the pillows. And you.” He attempted a chuckle that ended with a few shaky breaths.
“No. You won’t be upset.”
He opened the blinds first, then rustled around making soft noises. It was always best to ease him into morning as tenderly as possible. This morning it would be more important. He slipped into the bed, not too gently, hoping the dip and vibration would assist in the waking process. Scratching of the scalp, butterfly kisses all over the face and some nuzzling of the neck, formed his plan of attack. Soon, the great lump began to shift, then squirm over to extract John’s body heat from him.
It was so good to see him enjoy himself with silly little games, the intimate games lovers play. “Ok, ready? What’s this now?” John leaned closer and scratched the fabric of his shirt as he undid the buttons, clicking his fingernails against each one.
“Oi. What have I told you about sarcasm with a sore arse?” He would have given said arse a pinch, but when he drew back the sheet, he winced and thought better of it. It was an overall red shade, more startling against the background of his otherwise creamy skin. There was purple bruising and some areas were mottled and blotchy where hand had overlapped paddle had overlapped cane. The welts were still raised.
“Jo-ohn!” Sherlock whined. “That’s not fa—“ He sucked in his lips in an attempt to keep the word from escaping. At least John had succeeded in making him aware of the juvenile aspect of that particular complaint. Left without a comeback, he scowled.
Lestrade gave John a wink and John nodded. He checked his watch again. “Right. That’s sorted then,” and walked around behind the chair. Sherlock had taken the first file from the stack and was flipping through the pages. A couple of words jumped out from the page as John looked over his shoulder: 70-year-old woman, assault, ligature marks. He shook his head to clear it and then grabbed Sherlock’s chin, tilting his head up so he could kiss his forehead. Sherlock’s eyes stayed fixed on the page in front of him until John tightened his grip around his throat and said, “Oi.” Sherlock frowned and lifted his eyes. “Behave. Or else.” Sherlock grunted. John planted another kiss and then left for the easy part of his day.
“Worried?” A flurry of solid blows on the curved bottom of his cheeks, John’s favorite spots for nibbling. He raised his voice. “Worried? Is that the most accurate word?” Sherlock grabbed the sheets and twisted them.
“Right, then. Why are you being punished?” John gave him five light smacks with his hand across the center of his bottom and heard Sherlock suck in a quick breath.
“I’ve gone through the list, Greg, there is no one else and I’m not giving up this shift. I will deliver him and it will only be for 6 hours. I won’t take lunch and I won’t take any breaks and I won’t take any patients after 3, I swear.”
“I thought you hated repetition.” John rubbed his lower back and said, “Give it a minute. Explain about the conflating bit.”
Sherlock called casually, “Wait outside, then, I won’t be long.”
Sherlock didn’t quite shout at him, “Aren’t you going to bring it up? Drag it out of me? Make me talk?”
John snorted. “You’ve been an intentional embarrassment to him a hundred times at least, since I’ve known you.”
On cue, brakes shrieked outside and the door downstairs crashed open. Mrs. Hudson opened her door. “Have a scone, Detective Inspector?” she asked hopefully.
“Mm-hmm.”
John growled, “To hell with the palace, I’m putting it on your skin, all over you, so you can see it everywhere you look, so everyone can see it, so you’ll know what will happen to you if you forget.” He punctuated every phrase with a bite or a scrape of his teeth or a harsh suck that would leave Sherlock looking like the survivor of some long vanquished plague, John thought. Smallpox? Scurvy? He continued the ravishment all the way down to the hair surrounding Sherlock’s erection and then gently rubbing his cheeks along Sherlock’s pulsing cock and freezing him into stone. He tickled up one side with his stubble, swirled his tongue around the leaking head and ran his cheek down the other side. He scooped up his balls in one hand and rolled them softly around in his palm before licking them, making obscene slurping noises until they were covered in saliva.
John said, “Knock ‘im dead, Molly Hooper.” She walked out with a positive bounce in her step.
Sherlock’s head was bent and he tried to meet John’s eyes, but he had no courage himself at the moment and he stared at the table instead.
John hurried back into the office, mouthing “Sorry,” to Mrs. Winslow and shrugging into his jacket. “You’ll have to catch the little ba-,” remembering the genteel lady watching him, he amended, “rascal before I do then.” He hung up.
My temperature is runnin' high
Can't you see we're wastin' time, yeah?
“YES, John! I promise if it hurts more than it should, I will ask you to stop!” He was almost shouting now, but Sherlock had gotten what he wanted: John, just irritated enough to get over his qualms about not being gentle. He muttered under his breath as he slicked himself up. He couldn’t keep from sliding his two fingers in again for one final scissoring, widening Sherlock roughly, but then he lined his weeping cock up with Sherlock’s fluttering arsehole. Just as Sherlock inhaled to keep whinging, John forced his way in, bollocks deep and bottoming out, in one sharp thrust. Sherlock’s incoming breath shuddered to a halt as the burn of John’s penetration overwhelmed him.
Watching him, John recalled a dog from his childhood who would paw at you if he felt he wasn’t getting enough attention. He laughed, eliciting narrowed eyes from his current pet. He traced his cheekbone with the tip of his finger and stroked him back into contentment. He didn’t want to leave things until too late, so checked his watch and didn’t exactly ask him, “Why don’t we get ready?”
John nodded wearily. “I promise you he’ll suffer.”
“I know, love, but we have to cool off your skin.”
“Oh, John. You can’t. Doesn’t matter what he’s told you or how he’s behaved, whatever you told him you were going to do, you’ve got to do. You have to finish it out to the bitter end. He knows it too, that’s why he sent the text. We’ve all been through this together, a dozen times and it just doesn’t work otherwise. Ask Mycroft.”
Sherlock continued the motion, spreading his fingers gently as they withdrew. The deeper breathing he heard let him know it was working to loosen him. He could feel John letting go. Four more strokes, five, in, out and John shivered his approval. A third finger followed and John tightened up momentarily. Sherlock paused and let the muscles of the rim relax around him. He ran his hand up the John’s leg, helping to soothe him further. When he saw him settle back softly on to the mattress, he started again and after a few moments, John ordered him, “Now. I’m ready.”
He shouted over the wail of the sirens. “Did you find him?”
As you no doubt already know, I have been ordered to write you a letter of apology. It has proven to be quite difficult as you can imagine.
“Try harder. Why did he do that, deploy his resources?”
John snapped the cane across the backs of Sherlock’ thighs just hard enough to sting.
John gave him his death grin and said, “Never felt the need. Always been able to handle trouble without any fancy technique.”
“Such a charmer, you are,” he muttered before shoving Sherlock off him. He grabbed a piece of toast. “Open.”
“I can’t believe after all this time you continue to ask questions to which the answer is obvious. I’m right where you left me. Although most everyone else seems to have gone,” he said in a voice that sounded the slightest bit intrigued.
There were only 9 furious stomps on the stairs. He took them two at a time.
In frustration, he knocked John’s book off the table. He looked quickly at John, and picked it up immediately, walking around in circles, licking his lips. With another stab at sorting things, he walked back to John. “Forget this letter. I’ll write a new one. I’ll start over. Please, let me take it back.” Sherlock was panicking and he approached him as if to take the letter from his hands and that shook the seemingly dazed man from his apparent trance. He frowned at Sherlock and pulled the letter back.
John looked up to see if Sherlock’s head was out in the open yet. No, not quite. Let’s see what we can do about that, he thought. He brought his mouth down and slid the foreskin back gently with his lips. He swirled the tip of his tongue around and around the head, tasting the precome that was beginning to leak from the slit. A moan from the mound under the pillow indicated that the plan was working. Sherlock’s hands found their way to John’s hair and he grabbed on tight.
“No, not worse. But definitely going to be uncomfortable. Let me get the ointment. And an icepack. Even a few minutes will help.”
“Exactly my point! You know nothing about one of my dearest pastimes, you don’t know any of the people I have--some type of social interaction with, not even what they look like.” He glanced back at John disapprovingly.
“What did Mycroft do when he found out you were missing?”
John whispered in his ear. “That’s enough for tonight love. You’ve had your catharsis. Leave it to Molly to figure out how to do it without a single blow. Come to bed.”
She told Sherlock to be brave, it would all be over soon, and he rolled his eyes and indulged her, pleased despite his best attempts to mock her sentiment. “Mrs. Hudson, surely, you don’t think a little corporal punishment is going to do me damage.”
“Obviously. Yes. Well. February fourteenth. The holiday?”
“He’s clean. He’s totally clean. He never left the floor.”
“No! No, no, I’m sorry, no it wasn’t worth it. I…I couldn’t help it.”
John decidedly did
“And now?”
“Hmm. I suppose that’s added incentive.”
And just a reminder, comments keep writers writing...
“No games, Sherlock. I’m going to call everyone off, so if you’re not there when we get back, so help me…”
Sherlock said, “Yes, sir.”
He laid the last as low as he could and Sherlock cried out, now stamping both feet alternately and crying into the pillow. He nodded his head and John slid the cane under the bed.
Mycroft hesitantly, “I could compensate you for the lost wages if you can’t--”
He whirled around, trying to see where he’d gone wrong. “I only meant you’re a fool because I’m not good enough for you and you should find someone who deserves you because I don’t.” With more certainty, he said, “You should put me on another day of punishment. A whole week, ok? All right?” Continued silence. “Please, say something. John?”
Each wet suck, each wet pull had John’s jaw clenching, his neck spasming. He finally clutched Sherlock’s head, each hand with a palmful of the man’s spidersilk hair, until he let go and ruthlessly fucked into Sherlock’s mouth. It wasn’t pretty, it wasn’t gentle as John effortlessly heaved his dick into his Alpha’s waiting and pliant orifice, grunting impossible endearments as he did so. Sherlock sputtered at first, unused to the pounding and driving force, but once he realized this was
Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure he was comfortable with a scientist who was prepared to implant something into his
Okay. Maybe John really
John wiped a hand down his face, feeling suddenly exhausted. Any moment, any single minute now he expected to see him, Jim. When his defences were down, when it was difficult to put up a proper fight, that was usually when John saw him, sitting there, watching him. Jim would smile, suggestive but adoring, and John no longer cared whether it was an hallucination or some kind of otherworldly psychic projection bent on making his last days on Earth as difficult as possible.
She giggled a bit, unduly pleased with herself and absolutely unconcerned with possibly facing a belligerent Sherlock. John stopped her just as she turned to go, raising his left hand as much as he could.
John managed a slow exhale, “Right.”
It hurt John to even say the words. All of this, all of their planning and work had just spectacularly imploded. The blond could still feel the remnants of adrenaline and the almost crippling emotional pain from his encounter with Sherlock only 15 minutes ago.  He tried not to think about the brunet’s cruel words…just as he tried not to think about his own mortality, ticking down like an overlarge clock face in his mind’s eye (too loud, and entirely too fast).
Sherlock more than felt the rush of deep, deep sorrow that seeped from inside the church and settled into his bones, he
Now Mycroft finally spared the papers a dubious glance.
“Ah yes. I see. You have…we haven’t…been properly introduced.” John couldn’t quite be sure, but the man almost seemed…flustered? “Understandable, of course; someone like…you.”
And that seemed to be all the consent Sherlock needed, he rushed John in two long strides simultaneously managing to take off his shirt completely and kick his Italian leather shoes off his large feet. His face was murderous, and normally that would have given John some pause, but he knew the truth behind the screwed up features and snarled lips…it was rut and passion and the itch to dominate and didn’t they
John waited by the door, anxiously peering out of the grimy window. He hoped against hope that he wouldn’t be caught here, or see a tall, impossibly gorgeous Alpha turn round the corner towards the bungalow, the wind whipping his woollen coat behind his back.
That last sarcastic remark was punctuated by a fair bit of crackling over Lestrade’s radio that quickly gave way to the voice of one Mycroft Holmes, issuing the command to begin operations.
“Have you read this?”
“Oh Christ…
ill young man, unless you want to make a case for terminal stroppiness!" She pinched at his flank and he bucked immediately, looking out over his shoulder with a pointed glare.
John, however…well, he generally smelled of the sweetest perfume that someone put on several days ago and never quite washed off. His scent was so faint, his glands so immature, that he could almost pass for a Beta; that is, a genetically neutral Beta human. There were times, however, when he was under great stress (or distress for that matter), that his scent became stronger…but it happened rarely nowadays, and he was just fine with that.
to see him naked, and he’d be damned if he’d let
. Pheromones and hormones aside, John needed his righteous anger to see him through this confrontation, otherwise he’d find himself backing down and letting the Alpha get away with whatever he wanted. While that was certainly the path of least resistance, and tempting, it did nothing to avenge the emotional trauma the apex had knowingly heaped upon his friend.
“He works too hard, that one. I’ve tried telling him to go on holiday but he doesn’t listen to me.”
“N-no!” He managed in a surprising outburst of self-control, “th-they said you would be hard to resist. But I – I can’t.” He clapped both his hands over his nose and mouth, backing away a few steps.
John oscillated nervously, lightly jumping up and down the first two steps of Mary Morstan’s front porch, eagerly awaiting the appearance of his date. He had known Mary only about a year, but it didn’t take long for him to fall for her bright eyes and dazzling smile. She was a Beta as well (with Omega tendencies, which John found he quite liked), and that made things easier all around as John worried less about gender issues; and Mary didn’t really seem to care.
Sherlock kneeled next to the unconscious Omega and lifted his chin ever so slightly, gently, as if handling a freshly picked honeycomb that could fall apart at the slightest of touches. He allowed himself a moment to just inhale the scent of the constantly wearied man, nestling his nose at the crook of his soft and musky neck. Sherlock knew that John thought his unwashed status was off-putting, but Sherlock found it concentrated his own natural pheromones, making him smell of cloves, salty caramel, and ironically, honey. He could make a home there, he thought, as he ran his thumb across the Omega’s delicately curved upper lip.
John’s injuries had healed fairly quickly, and he counted himself lucky that even though he was a bit malnourished, he was otherwise healthy for a man his age. There was only a faint green and yellowish reminder of the bruises around his neck, jaw, and cheekbone; and those would also soon fade.
“Shh, Mr. Holmes, it’s alright.” The nurse crooned, gently wiping away the sweaty hair from his forehead. Her accent was strong, possibly Mancunian, and Sherlock couldn’t quite understand why that would be important right now.
John lurched over the downed and bleeding security guard, clenching his left fist as the remaining guard scrambled backwards in terror. The Omega then struck a hammering blow straight to his mid-section, harshly gripping the man’s gun arm as he doubled over. With a move borne of years of intense training and practice (really, it was just like riding a bicycle), he swung the man around roughly, lifting the Alpha’s arm behind his back so forcefully, he could see the sharp jut of his scapula through his cheap suit as the man’s bones twisted and shifted to accommodate the unnatural position.
Molly chewed her lower lip, feeling a stray bit of chapped skin catch between her teeth. She was trying to be helpful, she was - quite desperately so - but it was disheartening to find herself hopelessly stymied at every turn. She wondered momentarily if this is what Sherlock must also feel like right now…except, maybe a hundred times worse.
He knew the reason for the lack of creature comforts; it didn’t take any great leap of logic to understand why there was only a bed, side table, desk, and one bookcase. Most Sentinels who came to this place were woefully undisciplined and prone to zoning, this much he easily deduced. A room such as this would be a like a safe place within the Cottage, an area of neutrality that wouldn’t tax their already overloaded nervous systems.
either.”
James groaned, his grip on the globes of John’s arse fierce and worshipful as he pulled the man underneath him against his body once more, practically forcing John up and off the cheap cot. With his rough tongue lapping and nipping the back of his neck in turn, James tensed and thrust once more, moaning and crying out as he quivered, and released himself inside the smaller man. Riding the wave of his orgasm, Sholto’s jaw clenched around the supple skin at the base of John’s neck, biting and leaving vicious red teeth marks in its wake.
He took one good look at both women and sighed, he didn’t really want to do this. He pulled a neatly folded wad of pound notes from his back pocket (courtesy of his pension) and handed it to Julia. She accepted this without a word, as it was a relatively common transaction between the two. John was certain Julia was squirreling most of it away for the baby. For Brandy, he pulled out a taupe coloured business card from his wallet; it was thick, with a respectable linen finish. He passed it to the heavily pregnant Omega.
The same blonde haired nurse returned, breathing frantically, so much so that Mycroft thought she might pass out.  But she finally caught her breath, face tense with bad news. “Dr. Barrymore, It’s Mr. Holmes in room three, Dr. Watson is attending.”
He turned to Murray, prismatic eyes dark and direct, “Follow my lead, and do not hesitate to shoot if you feel threatened. Do you understand?”
“Please, have a seat. My brother will be here shortly and we will begin.” The Alpha said the word ‘brother’ with a hitch and a sneer, there was definitely something going on there, John thought, but he certainly wasn’t going to pry into some stranger’s relationship with his family.
I have pictures of CATS!
John turned his attention away from them and back onto Sherlock, who had stepped away from Sarah and Marcus to settle himself at John’s side with untoward familiarity. John moved away a half-meter or so, not quite comfortable with being so close to the brunette.
Oh god.
You went through this study?”
“John, you know I dislike repeating myself.”
St. Bart’s was largely unchanged from his time in medical school. Of course, there were updates, some new renovations, new hallways, new rooms and equipment – but essentially the layout was the same. So it took no great effort to find his way to the morgue, probably his least favourite area of them all, even as a doctor who was quite used to seeing dead bodies.
Moriarty was in his face, breathing, but there was no breath, only gunpowder and chlorine.
The blond ruminated a bit longer. He remembered being embarrassed enough to want to flee the flat, but Sherlock asked him to stay and offered a bit of tea. John, like any good Englishman, couldn’t pass up a cuppa, so he decided to stay and enjoy a nice treat of Earl Grey…
, John would certainly need a little extra bit from the taps for this. He anxiously depressed the button for the machine and swallowed, though his mouth remained dry.
When the fever finally broke, John was huddled into himself, curled into a foetal position and facing the far wall. It had come in barely comprehensible waves, his consciousness, each push and pull of his mind growing stronger until he opened his eyes to the bright glare of unnatural lighting.
He couldn’t be serious though. Mycroft couldn’t actually think John had somehow sabotaged the recording?
“John – John, wait…let me explain, please!”
Honestly, Sherlock wasn’t trying to hurt her. He just wanted her to
“Dr. John Watson,” he smiled, though it was forced and didn’t quite reach his dark blue eyes.
“Just listen John; it’s a very simple request, really.” The man angled the computer away from him and towards the blond, supposedly so he could hear better, but John already knew what was on the recording.
“What an
“Excellent…so lovely to meet you,” in one graceful motion, she stood, making her way noiselessly across the room. She swept one arm towards an overstuffed fainting couch nestled near the far wall, “Please, have a seat. We have so much to discuss, you and I.”
“Okay…boyfriend then? Which is fine -”
“Thank you,” John took the note from the woman and turned towards Amy once more, “keep him sedated for now, Fentanyl and Midaz. In the meantime I need to talk to John and find out what the hell he wants to do. We don’t have a lot of options. The cauda equina will be entirely too bruised and inflamed after this, we’ll have to wait until he heals or try again somewhere else.”
The two tonne vehicle toppled like a cheap plastic army toy, just like the flaming mass ahead of it. However, this one landed on the driver's side, relatively intact with nothing but the groans of men and unsecured supplies strewn about the inside.
John wasn’t exactly sure how to describe Sherlock to Sarah. He could say he was an Alpha, but that would be like trying to explain Buckingham Palace by saying it was a large, fancy, old building; accurate but not entirely the whole picture. John decided he would just keep his mouth shut and let her meet Sherlock and draw her own conclusions, whatever those would be.
He frowned immediately, peering down the lane through the mist and clinging wetness of the post-storm atmosphere. Just around the corner, the fierce glow of police lights blinked on and off against the brick houses, a familiar strobe-like tattoo he had long become comfortable with. He gripped the thin paper bag, hands clenching as a moment of raw panic tensed the muscles and wrinkled the sticky white paper.
The man’s breath whooshed out in a laughable yelp of surprise just as John raised his hips at a perfect angle to buck him off onto the ground.
around his Omega dick) would be enough to push him over the edge. Instead he breathed, moist and supple into the air of the flat he breathed, Sherlock groaning and grunting as he pleasured John selflessly.
“Capsules taken by Jimmy before he died. He’d given me a sample, but Sherlock found them to just be sugar pills really. No actual medication at all. So…explain to me again about this experimenting? And what is that you’re looking at exactly?” The line of tawny blob filled slides had only increased since John had entered the morgue, and he was more than a bit curious as to what they actually contained.
The assurance meant nothing; both men knew inevitability was the victor here. Whatever was to happen, there was little they could do to stop it now.
The walls were an unobtrusive beige (brown teepee? Well-bred brown?), and the incessant beeping near his head could only mean he was, in fact, still alive.
were wildly inappropriate for public places. They screamed of curled toes, writhing torsos, sweaty arched backs, hot shining skin, and a pair of limpid blue eyes he couldn't delete even if he wanted to.
The young woman nodded in understanding. “We can’t always explain it either, every mind is different, but if you’ll please come with me, sir.” There was something forceful in her tone, as if she was a person used to getting her way, or used to being followed.
John didn’t want to do this. He didn’t want to go back down this road, this dangerous path full of memories and desire, fear and paralyzing guilt. But Mycroft Holmes was an intelligent man, a gambling man, and seemed to know exactly which of John’s pressure points would yield the most efficacious result.
James stayed inside him for several moments, caressing and squeezing John’s softening and overly sensitive cock. The Omega laughed low in his throat, realizing it was all his fault that they couldn’t relax and lay down on the cot now, or enjoy the afterglow without laying in a rapidly cooling puddle of his own semen.
John stumbled through the threshold, letting his sweaty palm linger on the peeling metal handle of the front door. The bungalow was blessedly silent, the only noise coming from the early evening wind as it slipped through the second story eaves. He knew, vaguely in the back of his mind, that Marcus was probably home, as well as some of the girls. Honestly, he hoped they wouldn’t bother him too much; he had his heart set on a quick kip before Sherlock arrived - just a little mental preparation and reinforcement before they had ‘the talk.’
certain?”
It was probably because of this that neither of them noticed a man detach himself from an adjoining alleyway, and noiselessly follow their trail with ease.  He cut an elegant figure in the light, and stuffed his gloved hands into the pocket of his long woolen coat that billowed behind him dramatically with every step. Only a moment later, he popped his collar, the lined fabric whispering against his jawline, offering no camouflage but definitely giving the man an aura of effortless allure.
…and so on, and so forth.
What do you want? Has my imprisonment in this torturous facility not a punishment enough? Now I am expected to - to
Cool hands placed themselves on Sherlock’s forehead, his cheeks, the sides of his neck; they ran down his upper body like waves of cool, slow-moving water.
Never to be hurt.”
woman had managed to sidestep such a basic human urge was the biggest question of them all. But he couldn’t just come at her like that. He had to be subversive, and a little less keen.
“As you can see, this area is much more sense-neutral than the lower level, and the floors above this are quite the same. We strive to make your stay here as comfortable as possible. The lower levels, that’s really for show and the guests’ families. You can avoid the lobby altogether by using the lift just round the corner.”
“Make the travel arrangements, if you would, Anthea.” His grip on his umbrella handle tightened momentarily, worried fingers squeezing the polished cherry wood handle. “This may be our last chance to save him.”
– we need to get out of here, this is all
He breathed in to a count of five, and then exhaled to the same.
Sherlock continued to lick long and hard and thorough against the bond mark, infusing his saliva and marking John as his own.
Mrs. Hudson ignored the outburst, searching instead through the Sentinel's modest closet for an appropriately clean get up. "Oh stop your whinging, drama queen."
“I just, I need a minute, please.” He couldn’t hide the small break in his voice.
“Sherlock…”
She sat on the vinyl stool and motioned for John’s arm, wrapping a bright orange tourniquet around his bicep when it was offered. John didn’t have much in the way of fat (or muscle for that matter) right now, and his veins popped up instantly under the pressure. Lurid bluish streaks lined his arms, looking bizarre and strangely inhuman under the fluorescent light.
He attacked the door with gusto, after trying the bell several times, banging his left fist upon the lacquered surface, uncaring as to who answered the door. This all seemed like a fine plan, until the kind and worn face of Mrs. Hudson peeked through the crack of the door. John stopped his pounding immediately.
“There’s quite a variety here: Chinese, Thai, Indian, Fish and Chips…but if you look at the autopsy reports and what remained in their stomachs,” a bit more paper shuffling and gathering, “look, Indian, Thai…”
It was a show. Of course it was a show. It was an ancient mating dance, Sherlock was clearly showing John how strong he was, how worthy, how he was good enough to be his mate, and no one else’s.
it, it was given to me - quite a shock that your team managed to miss such an important piece of evidence,” the Alpha favoured Lestrade with a rather scathing look.
"I heard you last night." Sherlock stated, out of the blue, his large hands caressing the smoothly glowing surface of his violin.
“Excuse me, young man? Sherlock?” She stomped (as well as an elderly woman could with a hip) over to his bed and loomed over his wan face. He appeared extremely settled in and hadn’t moved a single muscle since she’d knocked, and knocked, and waited, and knocked again, and then just let herself into his room with a ‘hoo hoo!’, a tea-tray, and an excited smile.
Sherlock, who had not moved or spoken during the entire time the Omega was on his mobile, now twitched and stood with John, confusion apparent on his face.
The blond stared at the taller man, absolutely dumbfounded. Here he sat, his right thigh a dull ache in comparison to the maelstrom of thoughts in his head. It wasn’t that he was unsure of the depth of Sherlock’s feelings for him, it was simply that he had no idea that under those Byronic curls and effortlessly sculpted cheekbones, Sherlock could hide such devastatingly deep insecurities. And then John had to wonder, was Sherlock loved enough as a child? Was he happy before he met John?
Energy pulsed between them, and for a long moment, John wasn’t sure Sherlock would come back to himself. He did though, balling his hands into fists and stepping away so abruptly that he must have taken the air with him, for John couldn’t breathe through the vacuum that suddenly descended upon the hallway.
when all the Alpha wanted to do was welcome his Omega home in privacy.
“You really want me to move in with you?” There was a hopeful note to John’s voice that he couldn’t suppress, not even if he tried.
“Sh-sherlock…” John stuttered, clutching the arms of the chair, swallowing convulsively as the Alpha breathed one hot breath after another onto the spongy, sensitive head of his cock. Sherlock waited for any indication that John was not up to this, that he couldn’t handle this amount of physical exertion, but none came. John laid his head back against the back of his chair and breathed, both hands clutching Sherlock’s shoulders lightly.
“I have my ways. Rest assured they are entirely legal and entirely permanent. Better this than losing your license, yes?”
Dr. John Barrymore was a tall man, almost on level with Mycroft himself, but carried with him a breadth of bearing that hinted at a quiet, quiescent power. As Mycroft made his way down the myriad hallways, each echoing step reminding him of the years he spent working in the august presence of Her Majesty, he took in the clean, sterile atmosphere.
If Dr. Stapleton found his smile to be unnerving, she didn’t show it. She only sniffed daintily as she squirted two puffs of medicine into each nostril, then replaced the small bottle from whence it came.
The footsteps stopped completely as they hit the middle landing, pausing for a long thoughtful moment before continuing, slower now and more deliberate, until Sherlock reached the second story and turned to find John standing at attention. The Alpha’s nostrils flared, then his mouth dropped open and he dragged in deeper breaths, drawing in great big gulps of scent and air as if he could simply taste John from the pheromones awash in the thickened atmosphere. He reminded John of a savannah cat - a predator - an animal that could at once tear him apart so much as knock him to  the ground and clench his teeth at John’s throat, showing complete and utter dominance.
brilliant,” Taser man replied, sounding quite put out. “Get back to the car, they wanted him as undamaged as possible, you wanker!”
Pictures of Sherlock! Pictures of Sherlock being sassy!
“That’s what was in my coffee – chlorine. It’s here now, can you smell it?” Sherlock wrinkled his nose, turning his face to the side in an effort to nose out where exactly the stench was coming from. It was getting stronger every moment.
Visit me:
After the second shock showed sinus tachycardia (something manageable, thank God), and the ensuing successful intubation, they all allowed themselves a moment of blessed relief. Amy checked and rechecked the settings on the vent, before turning to John, her curly blonde hair falling into her eyes.
“The Universe is rarely so lazy.” The other man interjected. He was an Alpha, John was sure of it now. Over Sherlock’s signature scent, John could smell the rich undertones of leather cream, scotch, and wood soap. However, he lacked a certainly quality of presence that Sherlock exuded. It seemed Sherlock was an apex, but his brother was not. It was not unusual for this to be so; the apex gene was exceedingly rare. Again, John felt like a plastic Tesco brand drinking glass sat next to two tumblers made of Waterford crystal.
John was exhilarating, he was exciting, he was
Reaching into the same front pocket that held his mobile, John pulled out the tiny capsule he had procured from Jimmy, the uncultured but ultimately well-meaning Omega, “I’ve just had a client who says he’s part of that study you were looking into a few weeks ago. I managed to convince him to part with a sample of the experimental fertility drugs they’re giving them.”
“Oi, Sherlock!” John tried to take each and every thing Sherlock was handing to him, but he was dangerously close to losing his towel, and was certain that that was a humiliation he would never

their heart break. Guess he was wrong about that too.
For the first time since the meeting began, she smiled genuinely. It was like the sun splitting through the feathery linings of a cloud. John couldn’t help but stare at her incredulously.
“Nope, don’t care. It was lovely.”
"Do you know where you are? Do you know what happened?" John clipped, using his jacket to fan away the intrusive, stinking smoke. He was only vaguely aware of the ever increasing amounts of shouting and gunfire behind him.
authority did you make this decision?”
He shrugged the duffel over his right shoulder, grimacing in pain. At this point, his whole body hurt.
It had been hours. Hours and hours of toner receipts, syringe recalls, carpet cleanings, and insipid transcripts of customer service representatives arguing over whether or not their phone messaging system was to blame for automated menu malfunctions or if the servers were on the fritz.
It took Mycroft less than 48 hours to gather everything the British Government had on Sebastian Moran. During this time, Sherlock accosted the restauranteurs listed in the receipts from the study. One by one he visited their establishments, questioning, seeking answers from the owners.
The Alpha turned his head, blinking slowly; he nodded once in the affirmative.
grown up in England after all).
And with that, she was gone.
His arms twitched as he moved to close them over his gaunt chest, over his gunshot wound, keenly aware of the sharp jut of each rib and the concavity of his abdomen.
It was standard fare, private, and he supposed he could thank the Holmes’ for that small mercy. The monitor beeped cheerfully (quite different from the last one he’d been attached to), and a collection of tubing wound in and around each other, all leading into an IV in his right antecubital vein. Another IV, nestled securely in his left arm, attached to a morphine pump, the handle and button of which rested near his left hand.
Marcus was laid out for him in eye-searing detail: the turn of his head, his shaggy hair drifting lazily in a shallow puddle, the angle of the bullet holes, and how his left hand stretched out away from his body, as if grasping (reaching) for something far, far away.
Dr. Barrymore paused for moment, his face pompous and knowing, before turning a corner into another whitewashed hallway. “I don’t think that would be wise. The procedure is delicate and even one slight misstep could cause irreparable damage to his nervous system.”
the original procedure would be a success as well.”
Finally the man turned and flicked a pale, elegant hand in John’s direction, nodding towards a faded maroon patterned armchair. He cleared his throat, making even that guttural noise sound distinctive and posh.
Sherlock continued to watch John with large, softly shining eyes, even as the man turned and limped through the automatic glass doors and into the Centre.
.” The tech continued compressions as Amy, the anaesthesiologist, ventilated manually, squeezing the sickly green bag every thirty compressions. John sniffed, his face settling into a mask of anger and determination, he’d be
After all, this could change
It felt like such a long time ago…sometimes it felt like just yesterday. He was haunted, he realized (not for the first time) by the remnants of that day two years ago, of the remains of that
He really,
“What do you think this means, Sherlock?” Molly’s soft voice sounded from behind the Alpha, a hint of sadness colouring her tone.
He twirled on Molly, now running his hands through his hair for about the fifteenth time that hour.
“You’ll have to think of something else,” John shrugged, waving a hand towards the posh Alpha across from him. Mycroft was sat in Sherlock’s well-worn leather and metal chair, looking more uncomfortable by the moment. He was ill-suited to cheap furniture, it seemed. John had visions of rich mahogany desks and sumptuously upholstered divans; this seemed more Mycroft’s style.
he was doing here, and how quickly he could get
But John didn’t care, he rocked back into Sherlock, taking more and more of his impressive size in, his body accommodating the massive girth and length of his Alpha as if he’d been born to it.
. Gone was the furious bravado that prompted him to clock an apex Alpha in his face, gone was the bravery that had him step into an alleyway to protect a fifteen year old kid against two men twice his size. Here was John Watson as he was just after he came back to London, scared, unsure, struggling with life, purpose, and just enough PTSD to keep himself miserably awake at night.
Regardless, it was comfort, though not nearly as soft and cushiony as he would like. At this point, he’d sleep on top of a boulder so long as it didn’t try to get up and run away from him. A quick punch to his dingy pillow, and the Omega nestled in, praying sleep would come quickly. Just before he closed his eyes, he remembered to set an alarm on his iPhone for 6:50pm. That way, he could be awake and ready when the apex Alpha, Sherlock, decided to make his grand appearance and (hopefully) change his future for the better.
“Well, we had some problems with the surveillance. After you…” John paused, and it suddenly became clear to him that this was the first time he’d seen the Alpha since the incident in the hallway. He wasn’t quite sure what to say now. Should he mention it? Should be ignore it and pretend it never happened? He shifted his stance abruptly, thrown by his emotions, memories and sensations forcing themselves unheeded into his mind’s eye.
anything with Marcus, but perhaps if he had known before, he wouldn’t have been so submissive and cavalier about the Alpha’s behavior.
John took in a long, almost bracing, breath before rubbing one hand along his jaw. He looked exhausted suddenly, and resigned, almost as if Mycroft's query was somehow expected.
of character). It wasn’t for want of trying, however.
Regardless of the earlier teasing and rough play, Sherlock was in no mood to argue. He knew from his research that it was much easier to bond when the Omega was on all fours, or on their stomach, and so John would remain. The access to his Omega’s bonding glands was ideal, and though he worried he might get carried away, he knew John was strong and could probably handle anything Sherlock threw his way.
. You and I can…we can…we can get whatever we want, whomever we want. You could - you could have your Sherlock, if you would just join me.”
“I phoned the Cottage as requested.” Anthea’s smooth, slightly raspy voice sounded from behind his left shoulder. “We’re lucky - they have a room available.”
recover from. “I appreciate the thought, alright. Just leave them by the door and I’ll get them in a moment.”
John’s breath froze in his throat, shocked rage leaving a tight, bolus sensation that made it almost impossible to swallow.
“Q-Quiet…they’ll hear,” the Omega panted, feeling the sweat dampened sheets wrinkle and flex beneath his clenched hands. He was close, it never did take him very long, he once learned in gender studies that Omega’s (even those Unformed) were obscenely sensitive, after all. But he hadn’t any prior penetrative experience to compare up until a few weeks ago; Major Sholto had been his first.
Not for the first time, he closed his eyes and pleaded -
Upon recalling the last several days, the last two weeks actually, John realized he’d been blessedly free of his own personal Jacob Marley.
He scoffed, letting the server plop yet another unknown bit of mystery vittles on his plate (he had no plans to really eat any of this slop, but appearances must).
Sherlock took the mobile with a quick swipe of his hand, making sure no one saw the small electronic device make its way into his Belstaff.
It was Mycroft himself who spoke first, his thin lips pursed in about as unhappy a grimace as the normally expressionless man could muster. “Explain please, Dr. Watson.”
Without moving his fluidly iridescent gaze from the cylindrical eyepieces, he merely shrugged, fiddling with the dials on the base of the microscope until the slide was in focus to his satisfaction. He lazily scrawled a few notes on a piece of crumpled paper sat next to his equipment and huffed ever so lightly.
The Omega looked away, tears threatening again, knowing the sheen of his eyes was too bright and too glaring.
As the shock began to set in, he heard a distant screech of anger, then voided his bladder and retched, tenacious globs of bilious mucous glopping wetly onto the floor.
John cried out immediately, repeating the name of each and every man in the transport. To his infinite relief, they all responded with varying degrees of grunts and curses, some more colourful than others. Then the Omega Captain unlatched himself from his seat and, thankful he was on the passenger's side, climbed out of the vehicle, rapidly assessed the situation around him.
Lestrade looked dubious at best. Sherlock looked shocked (something John rarely ever saw on his handsome face); which John thought was slightly hilarious, since it was Sherlock and Mycroft themselves that had come up with the idea. Had Sherlock changed his mind? Now that he knew more about John, did he not think him steady or strong enough to pull this off? Granted, John had hardly been at his best lately, but let it not be said the John H. Watson couldn’t rise to the occasion if he needed to.
John would come to him if he wished, and if not…well, that was an unpleasant thought appropriately left for dark and dreary days filled with tortured violins and dying fires.
A young man’s life depended on it, and Doctor John Watson was nothing if not dependable.
But this man, Sherlock Holmes, this man could
John stopped completely, all mental processes coming to an abrupt halt.
He cleared his throat.
Sherlock nodded and moved away to speak with the funeral director, motioning his hands towards the double doors and discussing the next step of the service.
“Sarah, I need you to take a look at Marcus and make sure he’s alright. I know you’ve had some medical training in the past, like me, and I know he’ll do what you tell him.” John ignored Sherlock’s querying expression and took a moment to rummage around in one of the smaller pockets on his large duffel. It was stuffed to the gills with first aid supplies: gauze, cotton balls, antibiotic ointment, and the like. He pulled out a choice few things and placed them in her small hands. It took her a minute to realize John spoke to her again, and she had to pull her eyes away from Sherlock with obvious effort. John realized, in the back of his mind, that he was glad for his latent Omega genetic status, if being a Formed Omega meant one would drool and moon about an apex Alpha like puberty stricken schoolgirl. Yes, Sherlock obviously smelled amazing, but Sarah really needed to get ahold of herself before she said or did something wholly embarrassing.
But, they hadn’t talked about it at all. John knew Sherlock wasn’t the type for flowery explanations and, let’s face it, normal human communication. Regardless, they needed to get this out in the open because, frankly, it was just
“Yes, hello, um…my name is John and I was looking, um…” he fidgeted unconsciously, clearing his throat, “I was interested in the fertility study? I um, saw it on a flyer, can you help me?”
A fresh-faced young woman poked her head in, opening the door just a crack, seemingly trying to keep everyone’s privacy intact. She seemed unaware of the oppressive tension between the two men.
.” And John felt himself obey. His whole body went taut and he cried out in blinding pleasure.
“Is that-“ John gasped in alarm.
Sherlock paused momentarily, but quickly recovered. “That depends.”
“It was Victor all over again.” Sherlock croaked out so quietly John almost didn’t hear him.
Less than two minutes later what seemed to be the entirety of the French police force arrived. Sherlock barked at them in an annoyed tone of voice and gestured sharply to the girl who was still clinging to John, and to the alleyway they had just exited. The paramedics began trying to extract the girl from John, but she held tighter, her babbling rising in octaves. John shushed her again and began gently prying her off himself, pushing her gratefully into the arms of the paramedics. As Sherlock grabbed him by the shoulders and yanked him away, John couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.
“I mean it. She went right to you, asked for you and everything.” Sherlock was silent for a moment, analyzing him.
.” Sherlock said, hesitant, looking at John, face drawn, almost pleading.
for!” Sherlock said fiercely, when he looked at John, though, the fight drained out of him. John was crying, his face drawn and tight. Sherlock shook his head, running his hand through his own hair. “It tells me you love me.” Sherlock amended. There was silence for a long moment.
“You’d be better than your own father.” Sherlock pointed out gently. John rolled his eyes.
reason. Sherlock steeled himself, repeating the lies over and over in his head. With a heart locked behind plexiglass, Sherlock stood from where he’d been brooding in his chair. He walked into his room, and before he could argue with himself, he gathered John’s few possessions that had found their way there and walked up the stairs dumping them on the soldier’s bed.
“What if that’s what I want?”
. People argue, people do stupid things, they hurt each other and love each other and hurt each other all over.”
Sherlock buried his face in his hands.
“Oh, you arse!” he cried.
there, and the people that matter, yea?” John finished shyly, toying with his mug.
When John began to walk down the street towards his friend’s house, he stopped dead in his tracks, about 10ft away from Sherlock and the front of the door. Sherlock stopped his pacing and nervous muttering, falling still. John’s face had gone blank, though his hands tucked in his coat were curled into fists and his jaw was clenched. Sherlock approached slowly, one step at a time, hesitant and sheepish.
. These I’d leave. I love these, I’m
. Weird.
Last night had been the final straw. He had dreamt of another two-lane road, just like
How did all of this mystery manage to make John fall even more in love with this strange, complex,
“Don’t you think
As John was readying to open his mouth and beg Sherlock to “
They fell asleep wrapped in each other, the lights of Paris glowing gently outside their curtains. The world temporarily held at bay, this single moment protected and honored.
“Friends, family,” he said, nodding to each section in turn. Some nodded back or raised their glasses in acknowledgment. “I know I speak for both John and myself when I say we want to thank each of you for coming today. As many of you know, the original plan was to have a large wedding full of distant relations and friends of friends of friends in attendance. But eventually, John and I decided we’d rather only have those that matter present. So, a few words for the few of you who were chosen.”
“We deserve this.” He said, in the same tone John had said “
After a long few moments John removed the now warm flannel, wiping the rest of his face. Sherlock was sipping on his tea, still watching John with his unblinking gaze.
“Still,” Sherlock shrugged.
“Shh,” Sherlock hushed him, his sticky sweet mouth kissing down the length of Johns' neck, “it’s ok, love. Trust me, I know what you want.”
The wedding ceremony was short and sweet, they removed their engagement rings, then replaced them back on their respective fingers. Their vows were simple, softly spoken so that they barely carried over the wind. For these words of promise and adoration and loyalty existed for none but them.
“She was a girl.” He huffed in annoyance. John raised one eyebrow, waiting for Sherlock to expand. “You like girls...” Sherlock grumbled, not meeting Johns' eye. John smiled in fond exasperation at the man.
“I believe so, yes,” Sherlock confirmed, going back to cleaning his violin with vigor.
“Why you’re crying?” Rosie asked, pulling back, little hands on his pock marked face.
“Oh-“ John said, blinking in surprise as he looked to Mike (
“No, you don’t.” he murmured. John relaxed in margins, toes uncurling, thighs unclenching, finally, his hands going lax in Sherlock's grip, allowing the younger man to gently pin him to the bed.
“Is this…” he started, listening for another moment. “Did you compose this for us?” he finally finished. Sherlock looked pleasantly surprised for a moment before a slow pleased grin grew on his face.
“What?! What the hell are we supposed to do with an abused child, John?” he argued, John could almost see the panic attack setting in, so he stood and rubbed a hand down his husband's back.
“Sherlock and I are very happy we got to bring you home.” He explained, Sherlock sliding over so she could see him too. She reached out and placed a palm on Sherlock’s face as well, little fingers at the corner of his eyes where the tears clung on.
“Sherl, you can’t make this kind of call after one night of putting a child to bed.”
) within the Watson house. And there had
Instead of a wedding date set more than six months ahead of time, they resent invitations with a date set for less than a month away. They spoke to Angelo, and he was more than ecstatic to close down his restaurant for a small reception after the actual ceremony. There would be no best men, no speeches, just friends enjoying a lovely meal. Angelo had, naturally, refused to allow John and Sherlock to pay him for closing down the restaurant for an entire night. In fact, Angelo had gone so far as to gather a few members of his wait staff to play a little music.
The first day of classes at Bart’s, John entered the lecture hall hesitantly. None of his friends had chosen Bart’s, all deciding on hospitals closer to the edges of the city, slower, calmer. But nope, none of that for John. His life was, after all, one shite show after another.
) too much, too caught up in the overwhelming joy and flowing conversation. (
Rosie didn’t speak until three months after her initial rescue. She was sat in John’s lap while Sherlock recounted their adventure in Baskerville, censored for little ears, when she looked up at him.
“Go,” he said finally, his voice gentle, “take a walk. I think Garrett-“
“Sherlock, love, talk to me? I can’t help you if you don’t talk to me, remember?” John said as he reached up and wrapped his free arm around Sherlock, pulling the taller man in close.
“I know.” Sherlock cut him off, giving John a gentle smile before leaning over his leg, twisting it so that the light from the lamp on the floor next to them shown on it brightly. John huffed a small laugh and relaxed back.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asked as he uncoiled and stood, taking one step over the coffee table and leaning over the back of John’s chair with the next.
“Where you would still have had to obey your superiors.” Sherlock snapped. They stared each other down until something in Sherlock’s face softened. “I thought you didn’t want Moriarty to have a place in our bed?” he whispered, eyes a little heartbroken.
It took John a moment to realize what had woken him, with a sleepy inhale he weakly lifted his head. His arm stretched out, meeting nothing but blanket and bed. It was lukewarm, Sherlock hadn’t been gone long enough for the bed to have gone properly cold. John debated getting up, perhaps Sherlock had merely been unable to sleep and gone to experiment? This whole situation was so new that John wasn’t sure where their boundaries were. What was ok? What wasn’t? Would intruding on Sherlock's four AM experiments cross the line from concerned to clingy?
“John,” Sherlock said, his face breaking into a large grin, tears in his eyes. His hands slipped under Johns robe, grabbing the man’s arse and kissing him breathless. John moaned in approval and slipped his fingers into Sherlock's hair, pulling him tight. After a moment, Sherlock hungrily broke away, kissing to Johns' ear and tugging on the lobe in the way that always made John go cross-eyed in pleasure.
Finally, the boy sighed, sitting up fully and running a hand through his hair. He almost looked exhausted.
And more than that, what did it say about John Watson that his perfect match would be drawn to such a violence driven man? Was John doomed to walk the same line as his father, as his sister? Was John doomed to find himself tied to someone just as horrid? So yes, god help him, John found himself
“I understand,” Sherlock whispered, no judgment because he did understand. Totally, completely. He
been normal?”
Two months later the kid was back. Still high as a fucking kite, still wearing the same clothes as last time. This time he was snarking off to three police constables. One boy, probably about the same age as the strange junkie in the cell, was crying. His companions were fluttering about, trying to comfort the lad. Curious, Greg made his way over.
“She needs help, Sherlock, and we need to shut down the trafficking ring before they leave London again. She’ll be safe with us, and it’ll buy us time. They’ll probably look for her for, what? Another day or two?”
Graduation came quickly. He felt, he must admit, an overwhelming pride at himself. He couldn’t wait to start working, trauma surgery suited him like nothing else. He wondered, almost giddily as he strolled the London streets, if perhaps this job was his tied. Who needed a person when he could have this, all day, everyday until his eyesight faded into nothing and his hands went stiff from age? John
Four months later, just after New Year’s, Sherlock came home from a day of watching Harvey. Mycroft and Gavin (
They arrived at the hotel shortly after, a large, grand structure in the heart of the city. The moment their hotel room door was closed Sherlock crowded John against the entryway wall and kissed him breathless. John gasped helplessly as he succumbed to rough hands tugging at his hair and gripping his shoulder in a bruising grip.
After another moment John gave another small sob and lurched to his feet, steadying himself against the wall. He allowed himself a weak moment to whimper at the overwhelming turmoil within him, before squaring his shoulders.
“Honestly…? I don’t know. She’s still young enough, I guess, but we don’t even know the full extent of what she’s been through. God knows what’s happening in that head of hers, most adoptive parents don’t want to deal with that.” Greg shrugged. “I’m sorry mate, I wish I could tell you she’s got a happy ever after waiting, but I don’t know.”
John found himself drifting along behind his school mates after lunch, head down, eyes trained on the ground and not on the two small booths on either side of the hallway leading to his class. Until suddenly, he lurched to a stop, gasping and clutching his chest. His friends stopped as well, looking at him strangely, until recognition flashed in one of their eyes.
a window. And walls. It all felt wrong. John sobbed again, the room felt tight, small, but also impossibly big. And he was but a minuscule man, watching the door from a thousand miles away.
“I love you too.” John breathed, tearing up a little, clenching his left hand. “Get him off my skin, love. Make it yours. Just like the rest of me.” Sherlock clenched his jaw, blinking back tears quickly before nodding resolutely.
Every inch of John Watson was perfection, from his veined feet to the blonde hair on his calves, to his middle. Soft and firm, no longer defined but still trim. The scars dotting his chest a testament to the fact that his unique kind of amazing wasn’t just skin deep. His pecs just that side of uneven, nipples that side of too symmetrical, the starburst of a gunshot on his shoulder. His face, golden, tanned by a life spent outside, and pock marked by years of HRT induced acne. His hair. God help him, Sherlock could write sonnets to that hair. Golden, shot through with silver, proclaiming to the world what a treasure John Watson truly was. Worth far more than his weight in gold.
Well fuck fate very much.
a great asset to the Work,” Sherlock gave a wry chuckle before closing his eyes and shaking his head, “I only said that to hurt you.” He said quietly.
“And you got everything back like that?” John asked in wonder.
“What do we do?” John hissed lowly as the poked their head around the corner once more.
“Why would I do that?” John asked, he sounded fragile.
“I did.” John blinked quickly, smiling fondly before abruptly spinning Sherlock about the room quickly as the tempo picked up. Sherlock let out a quiet, gleeful, giggle. Like a schoolboy with his first crush.
“Every moment,” Sherlock answered somberly. “Some of it is removed, the pain is worn around the edges, no longer so sharp to touch. But the…” Sherlock froze here, before squeezing John and taking a shuddering breath, “the sexual assault I was subjected to… No matter how I try, it just seems to stitch itself back together, a tapestry of pain and humiliation I can't force away.”
“What’d you dream about?” John asked quietly, enveloping Sherlock. Sherlock gave a sob again.
“Yea…” John looked on as a little girl and boy, perhaps 10 and 6 respectively, shivered as they huddled under a scratchy shock blanket. They eyed the female officer in front of them warily as she pulled a bar of chocolate from her coat and broke off a piece, presenting it to each child. The kids eyed each other before taking a bite, their face lighting up at the sweetness, grinning at each other in surprise. John swallowed past the lump in his throat, “Yea… I know.”
“It’s ok” John whispered, “It’s ok Sherl, I’m here. I’m right here.” He tried soothing his (
“I love you.” John breathed against his cheek, coffee and morning breath, grown out hair tickling Sherlocks temple.
“Oh?” he said, challengingly.
Sherlock… was enjoying this. Something that really shocked John, though if he thought closely, he didn’t know why. Sherlock was a vain git, he could spend hours just looking at himself in the mirror, not that John would blame him. John would spend all day looking at that marvelous face too if he could.
“Well?” He asked in that excited puppy dog way of his, looking to John for approval.
“I- ah… I don’t know how?”

“Yes, well that’s different, isn’t it.” Sherlock sneers, “You expect two men to take a strange little girl to their home for the night? And just how do you think that will be perceived?”
“That’s not an answer” John huffed, a small smile tugging on his lips.
“Moriarty hurt him,” Sherlock said in a dead voice, “I
” in amazement and sitting with weakened knees. He was still sitting there gaping at the pile when John came out in his bathrobe. Sherlock was momentarily distracted by John’s strong calves with a fine smattering of golden hair, not yet gone silver.
“Why not?” John asked with fake nonchalance. They kissed chastely, then separated and grinned at each other.
“I love you,” John whispered, lifting his face to lay a gentle kiss on Sherlock's lips. When he broke away Sherlock was looking at him with fond amazement. Still baffled in the face of John’s affection and loyalty, even after all these years. Still looking at John as if he was something glorious and treasured.
that?” John’s voice had risen in pitch, anger, confusion, heart ache.
The first scar was on his lower calf. Sherlock was methodical and gentle. The needle barely pinched as it slipped into Johns skin. A moment later John heard the packaging on one of the sterilized scalpels opening. Soft fingers prodded at numbed skin.
Two days later John found a proper sketchbook and a set of drawing pencils laid out on his bed.
And more silence.
John found himself smiling like a fool as Sherlock showered in the next room. As he took the two chocolates he had purchased that morning from his coat pocket and situated them on a small tea saucer, John found himself humming one of the songs they had danced to.
The group was buying children through the dark web from others, independent contractors, who had in turn bought the children from desperate, or just plain evil parents or family members. Older children, the teens, claimed they’d been obstinate at home, or sold to cover debts. They were beaten and bowed, trembling. Only one girl was abducted rather than sold by her family, a sixteen-year-old American girl who had been visiting family in Ukraine over the summer and gotten snatched at a festival after being separated from her cousins. The network had been using the docks to smuggle people into the UK through containers, where they would deliver them to buyers, before again moving the operation to another country. It was sheer luck they caught the group before they moved once more.
“I dunno, just… the colors and the flowers and everything else. Do we need it all? I mean Jesus Sherlock, we’re both so introverted. I don’t see why we can’t do something smaller,
“You wouldn’t be you without it, would you? Wouldn’t be happy or comfortable in your own skin. You’d be sad, I’d still love you, of course, but I don’t think you’d love yourself. I don’t want that. I want you to love your skin, I want you to love it as much as I love it. I want you to see what I see when you look in the mirror.” Sherlock pushed lightly on Johns' shoulder, so he was half on his back, then Sherlock laid a kiss upon the scars. John gasped, shocked, dazed, still processing. Sherlock had never paid much attention to John’s surgery scars. Occasionally he’d tug and teeth at John’s reconstructed nipples, though there wasn’t much sensation in them. But John never complained of course, as it brought Sherlock pleasure to lay love bites upon his husband.
The third blow landed across the center of his arse and John noted dispassionately that the welts now stood out against a field of rising pink. Sherlock’s respiration rate was rising and his voice already sounded desperate. “Three!”
Sherlock shook his head quickly. “No…no…fast…fast as you can…I want it to be over. Quickly… please.”
The two of them were worn out and although John slept late, Sherlock slept later. Morning was approaching afternoon when he went to poke the bear.
“I might subconsciously try to influence your future decisions and you won’t be able to tell if I’m being sincere or not! No, you
Sherlock stood up at that, pointing at the door and shouting, “OUT! Out now!”
“I hid in the wardrobe when I was supposed to stay at the desk.”
“Right, but, I’m not starting till you promise…”
Sherlock watched him just as intently, sighing in pleasure as his bottoms revealed him to be just as hard as he was. He catalogued his John: compact figure, well-defined muscles of his thighs, gold and silver hair on his chest…
This was a far more elaborate set of consequences than he’d ever had to impose before. Of course, it was a more serious breach of trust and the potential repercussions of the failure of the dissuasive aspect of the punishment were unbearable to contemplate. But would it destroy the delicate balance they had built between themselves as lovers? Sherlock needed John’s firm presence and stability. He held him safely at anchor and transfused his self-control into Sherlock’s bloodstream as needed. Would Sherlock resent him for serving as an external boundary on his internal demons? He was childish, but he was not a child. Did he need a parent regardless? John had taken on aspects of the role. Mycroft, certainly. Father Greg had thought he needed it at one time. John had never asked if their relationship had crossed categories. He’d suspected so, based on the level of trust Sherlock placed in Lestrade. It hadn’t broken their bond, just changed its nature. John liked what they had established between themselves. Could it bear up?
“I’m going to make the eggs and toast, so go brush your teeth. It will be ready in a minute.”
John asked, “More tea?” but Sherlock shook his head.
John checked in with him again. “You alright? I can stop right here. Or we can try your legs as well. Or try them later or not at all. Whatever you want.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Somewhere between gunshot wound and Serbian torture chamber.” John turned to look at him, but Sherlock was grinning wickedly at him. “Stop worrying, Doctor. My prognosis is excellent.” John punched his shoulder gently. “Berk.”
“Why are you being punished?”
John tilted his head at him and waited. Sherlock swallowed and continued, “before the spanking?” He flushed a bright red. John nodded in approval and said, “Good boy. I am not going to read your letter beforehand because I’m afraid it will weaken my resolve. I can’t afford to feel any sympathy before I have to give you a spanking.” John repeated the word intentionally and Sherlock winced and dropped his head to look at his bare feet in embarrassment. “Go on.”
Operations continue pending visual confirmation—MH
"Brother Mine:
“Very funny. Just hurry up and finish. I’m quite impressed, actually. You’ve been so very focused with a chore that wasn’t your choice. Why is that?”
When they reached the restaurant, Angelo was as ebullient as ever and tried once again to convince them to stay for the meal, but Sherlock reiterated John’s assertion. “I’m not at my best, Angelo. We’ll make it up to you, weekend after next?” He looked at John, who confirmed. “You can put yourself out as much as you like then.”
John laughed and kissed him, full on the mouth this time. He redid the thread on his right hand and when he started on the left, Sherlock’s breathing got heavier. He said, “John.”
“Very good.” He kissed his pulse again. “Shall I keep going?”
John sighed and pulled his head down for a kiss on the forehead. “She’s not going to cry, Sherlock. She’s tougher than that. She might get a little teary. But what if she
John stiffened and turned to look daggers at Sherlock who was suddenly regretting his insistence. John gripped the front edge of the bench. Time to give up the game. Sherlock leaned over and gripped the back of John’s head. With his other hand, he tugged up his shirt in back, then slid it down into his trousers. He gave him a kiss which left no doubt where his priorities were. After a lovely few seconds, he whispered in John’s ear, “Jealous yet?” He pulled away and looked at John with a wicked grin.
And thanks for saving him for us.
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Wilder and Sherlock looked at each other and shook their heads.
“Is that a stethoscope in your pocket, doctor, or are you just happy to see me?”
He was having trouble getting the words out now, trying to keep still and failing. “Ow, I… I’ll…call you.”
Mycroft barked out a laugh and stood up, grinning widely in what might have passed for genuine amusement, if not for the unpleasant undertone of schadenfreude at Sherlock’s inevitable comeuppance. He grabbed his umbrella and headed for the door. “As much as I’d love to witness your sentencing and execution, Sherlock, duty calls. Doctor, I would only caution you to remember that justice is a dish best served cold and in the absence of sentiment and that the purpose of punishment is deterrence. Although satisfaction for the aggrieved is an entirely permissible corollary.”
Up and down, he gave himself a single stroke, but having John in his mouth made him harder than ever, and he was afraid he would come before he even started. He let go with a shiver. John watched him, propping himself up on his elbows. His tongue poked out of the side of his mouth and slid over his lower lip. On the premise that there is no such thing as too much lube, Sherlock opened the tube and squirted some more onto his fingers. He moved closer and let one skim up and over John’s entrance, still widened from his earlier attentions.
He searched his contacts looking for Billy and idly wondered about gps chip technology. He knew they could track pets that way. Was anyone implanting them in humans yet?
Instead, he spanked him on the arse and Sherlock jerked with a gasp. “This is what you wanted, isn’t it?” He gave him another and said, “You were working to get me angry enough to bend you over in an alley and spank you, weren’t you?” Sherlock wriggled at the words, burning and whimpering with the delicious shame of it. John spanked him again, the sound shockingly loud, bouncing around the walls they were surrounded by. “You were gonna misbehave until I got angry enough to punish you, right out on the street.”
Mycroft remained silent for a moment and then stood. “Indeed. Thank you for the tea, John,” he said, having tasted no more than his first sip. “And congratulations, Little Brother.” They both looked at him curiously and he clarified, “Day 50, is it not?” He left.
John considered. “I’d rather you get your fresh air during the day, Sherlock. The sunlight might help you adjust to an earlier bedtime. Melatonin, you know.”
When John looked up from the laptop, Sherlock’s head was down again and John had to tilt his chin up. When he did, he saw red eyes and tears running down getting caught on those ridiculous cheekbones. He felt his own eyes fill. He took Sherlock’s jaw in his hands and swiped his thumbs up and across his cheeks. He reached for his hands and pulled him up onto his lap. Sherlock turned his face into John’s shoulder and John felt him crying in earnest. He ran one hand up and down his back and the other cradled his head until he had finished.
“Ow, ow, ow, John, not fa—I’m trying.”
Sherlock lowered his chin and looked at him with dilated pupils, from under his eyelashes. “Or your mouth, as the case may be.”
John smiled softly. “Really, Father Greg?”
John looked positively gleeful. “You see, Sherlock? You’re always complaining about Mycroft’s interference. He can be quite helpful on occasion.”
John recognized this strategy as well. Sherlock had an atomic clock in his head and was fully capable of judging when his time would be up within five seconds, keeping his mind occupied with anything other than the fact that he was standing in a corner with a naked, red bum like a naughty child. John wanted him focused on the reason he was standing there. “Not your concern. I want you thinking about the last four days and what you’ll do differently in the future.”
“No, no, no, sorry, she was frightened, sorry, ow, ow, she was afraid.”
“I was, you git. It’s time for lunch.”
In the interim Sherlock buzzed around the library like an over-caffeinated hummingbird. He zipped from place to place, freezing at each new location for a second, then resuming his quivering. He would hover over a book on a shelf for a few seconds, then thrum his way to a lectern and flip a few pages, vibrate over to draw back a curtain and look out the window, but his eyes never left Mycroft for more than a few seconds. The longer Mycroft took, the twitchier Sherlock got. John longed to comfort him, but Sherlock had to walk that lonesome valley by himself. John poured himself a cup of tea, just to have something to do.
“Thank you.”
“Better?”
John was baffled. “I’m in charge of decisions about punishment, remember? I say we’re through. How could you possibly want to continue, you git? You’re not enjoying it, I can tell the difference.”
“Yes, thank you.” He walked to Sherlock’s chair and pointed at it with his umbrella. “I assume you won’t be using this,” he said, as he sat down.
“Mycroft will be aware of all of it whether we like it or not and he’ll be sure to let you know. That will be satisfaction enough for him.”
John had been eating, but gradually, as Sherlock kept on, he put down his sandwich. He arranged his napkin, plate and fork in a straight line, his lips tightening. He sat up straighter in his chair; several deep breaths did nothing to calm him down. He tried sipping his tea, but when Sherlock mentioned Mycroft trying to save life, it was more than he could stand. He slammed his mug down on the table and shouted, “Enough! That is enough, Sherlock!”
“Yes, I know, but you promised me a conversation at four o'clock and now it’s five.”
“I’m not allowed to do anything! There’s nothing to do.”
John let his fingers wander through the curls.
“Sherlock again, is it dear? No apology necessary. I had a naughty one myself. Run along, I’ll see you next month.”
Eventually the gel dried and Sherlock whispered “Thank you.” He was breathing calmly and John knew that his work was done. And a good thing too, because he was wrecked, and wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed himself. He nudged Sherlock over and laid down flat on his back. Sherlock immediately flung his arm and leg over him. John worked one arm under Sherlock’s neck and took his hand with the other. He held it up against his chest and they were asleep in seconds.
Kissing his forehead before he slid out of the bed, John stripped his shirt off and tossed it into the corner. He hurried to the kitchen and returned to the bedroom within two minutes, but Sherlock had already fallen asleep. John rubbed his shoulders and dug his thumbs into the tight muscles around his scapulae to rouse him. He absolutely had to cool his arse off, but shocking him out of a doze would be counterproductive.
“I’m supposed to apologize now, right? Even if I don’t feel sorry?” Pouting again. John kissed his irresistible pouty lips and gave them a swipe with his tongue.
He drew back from the brink with closed eyes and a deep breath. He sat precisely and placed the letter in his lap, opening his eyes and smiling his reptilian diplomatic smile, the one that didn’t reach the rest of his face. He looked at John and gestured to the teapot, not because he expected him to want any, but to reestablish the proper British order of things. He took a sip from his own cup, then another and replaced it on the table. Stiffening his upper lip, he opened the envelope. He read it, expressionlessly, then again. From time to time, he stared out the window and read again, looking at Sherlock occasionally from the corners of his eyes. He poured himself another cup of tea, sipped it, and then read the letter again for a third time. He tapped his fingers on the arm of the chair. He folded the letter and replaced it in the envelope. Unlike Sherlock’s straightened steeple, Mycroft joined his fingers in a soft arch, and held them in front of his mouth. He stared at nothing for a good long while.
John raised his eyebrows. “Would you rather have me crabby? Or go alone?”
He intertwined his fingers with Sherlock’s and Sherlock was twitching and trembling, like a piece of paper curling up in a flame. John ground himself down on top of him, trying to put out the fire, trying to drive down through him to the other side, just in case it was possible. Sherlock was doing his best pushing up against him on the other side. The friction between them finally drove John to pull away. “I can’t… I don’t want to finish yet, Sherlock. I wanna see you.”
John was now quite concerned that Sherlock’s metaphysical introspection would completely derail the orgasm train they had been waiting for, so he rolled over quickly, letting Sherlock slide out. Sherlock moaned in disappointment, but John just giggled at him. He pulled Sherlock down into a fierce, open-mouthed kiss, partly because he was desperately starved for his mouth, and partly to shut him up. When he was certain that Sherlock had regained his focus, he let go of the tongue he was sucking and said, “In fact, now that I’m here…” He looked down at his cock, waving proudly and dripping onto his belly, “why don’t you take care of me first, then you can take all the time you like.”
Molly responded first.
Sherlock cut him off, leaning forward, with a spark of hope in his eyes.
Peeping from behind the door, he said, “You’re always in the mood. And even if you’re not, I’ll put you in it.” Sherlock sighed just happily enough to disturb his sulk. John was right, of course.
“I hope this is urgent. I was working, John.”
When they got home, John puttered in the kitchen, cutting up the chicken and making some tea. Sherlock was lying face down on the sofa. John brought the meal to him and put it on a folding tray. “Kneel up and lean on the back of the sofa. It won’t be the same as sitting, but at least you won’t be standing.” The arrangement worked well enough, but Sherlock ate only enough to satisfy John’s quota. He said, “Fancy a nap? You slept late, but I’m knackered,” but Sherlock shook his head. “Time for Mrs. Hudson’s letter. He went to the desk, retrieved the note pad and pen and returned to the sofa to write, lying on his belly. John waited for a while to make sure he was settled, then said, “I’ll go for a lie down then, if you’ll be alright.”
“Ugh. It’s agonizing. That’s an excruciating torture.”
Molly said, “You're going to find somebody, though right? He’s doing so well, you’re not going to leave him alone?”
When the spasms had mostly passed he allowed the head to pop out of his mouth and sat back on his heels to attend to his own pressing need. He slicked up his hand with the slippery mix left behind. At Sherlock’s hiss of oversensitivity, he released him and said, “Open your eyes. Look what you do to me, how hard you make me.”
“He overreacted.”
“No.”
After a few minutes on the heavy bag, Sherlock beckoned John over to the locker room. As they went through the heavy grey door, John felt like he had entered one of the shaky, amateur, gay porn videos he had been forced, totally against his will of course, to watch at uni. The locker room was as barebones as the rest of the building, harshly lit, grey, bare, and steamy. Standard layout, with 5 showerheads on one side, a sink and some toilet stalls, a wall of lockers and benches, two massage tables, and some cabinets holding towels on the other. One man was finishing up in the shower. John could tell this because the showers were open, as in without stalls or curtains, meaning that anyone taking a shower, and was naked, which Sherlock was about to be, was completely visible to anyone else in the room, including his Sherlock. Whose arse was about to be visible. And his other bits. Naked.
Right or wrong don't it turn you on
When he finished, John took the robe off him and gave him a gentle shove towards the corner. “Hands at your sides.” Sherlock took a deep breath and sighed it out. It was much harder for him to keep still when he didn’t have anything specific to do with his hands. John would have to watch for fidgeting. He’d caught him before, practicing violin fingering with his left hand and shuffling things in his mind palace on occasion. Sherlock turned around and asked, “Will you read my letter to you before…”
“And I’m NOT complaining, I’m describing. Are you sure you wouldn’t rather deprive me of sleep? The Serbians—“
Sherlock tensed in anticipation despite himself, breathing shallowly, and John swung. The noise itself was painful, a sharp crack. Sherlock gasped with the pain of it and jerked his head up off the pillow. Once the sting set in, he began to twist the pillowcase in his fist. The stroke itself left a line that was white for a second then sharpened to a bright red on top of the pink left from the previous days’ blows. John tightened his lips.
In a sulk, Sherlock said, “Hurts too much. You do it.”
When they arrived at the nondescript corner building, Sherlock said, “It’s not much to look at…” It was a barebones gym, but the men inside were raucously cheerful. John was surprised and pleased to see how warmly Sherlock was welcomed, almost as if the men were friends of his, imagine that. He was momentarily sad that he’d neglected this part of Sherlock’s life, before his shoulders were being clasped, hand being shaken, and he was generally being introduced all around. Mickey gave them both hearty bear hugs. Sherlock actually looked bashful as he ducked into the locker room and John was delighted that his posh boy was popular with the regular kids.
“No, John, you are singular.” He rubbed his face on his pyjamas.
John may have allowed his personal emotions to influence his decision about the punishment but he was through allowing Sherlock to dance around the obvious. With hardly a beat, he gave Sherlock his fifth stroke directly under the last. “Enough, Sherlock. Use the words. Say it.”
“Why was Lestrade watching you?”
John reached up for his other hand, turned it over and kissed his palm. “Things don’t always have to be even, Sherlock. Sometimes I want you to be the center of attention. I want you to lay back and just feel. Think about that today when you’re so desperately bored, about how everyone is taking care of you. How everyone is so focused on making sure you’re all right. And try to behave because that’s a way of saying you appreciate it. You’re not very good at saying thank you, but you can say it without using the words.”
They sat in tense silence until they reached the familiar door, John noting that the knocker was set straight. ‘Oh God,’ he thought, ‘not now.’ The last thing they needed was to try and process the last two hours (had it really only been two hours?) with Mycroft’s looming gravity added to the mix.
All of Sherlock’s bravado left him and he stuttered, “Could we…” He looked away. “I’d like to…if it’s ok…I was kind of looking forward…maybe, you know if it’s all right…to… ”
Sherlock had his head turned around and caught the look. He said, “That bad?”
“No! Not really. Perhaps if he had been here…”
The grasp brought them physically closer than John had ever seen them. After an endless 15 seconds, they broke apart at some invisible agreement. Sherlock fled from the room as quickly as he could without flat out running. John started to follow him, but Mycroft stepped in front of him and stuck out his hand. John tilted his head and took it, the closest physically that they had ever been. After a significantly shorter 3 seconds, Mycroft released him and sat back in his chair.
Sherlock moaned wordlessly, “Nnngh. Aaah. Aah.” He panted and gasped and his hands reached up to grab at John but couldn’t find him. His fingers scrabbled at the surface of the table, finding nothing to hold him down to earth and he drifted on the waves of pleasure that were being driven through him by John’s relentless intrusions. When John finally, at a glacial pace, pulled back, he slammed back in and spent a few moments twisting and rotating his hips, and pushing back gently on the backs of Sherlock’s knees until he heard him let out a stuttering whine that let him know he had found the spot he was seeking. And then he gave up his careful searching and drove into and out of him with a blind passion. He reached for Sherlock’s shaft, which was dripping pearly fluid onto the tautly drawn muscles of his stomach. He stroked up and down at the same pace of his thrusts and after a very few codas, they came together in a harmonic of shout and groan….
Sherlock spoke very briefly and handed her the letter. Her eyes flitted between him and the letter. John looked away when she caught him watching. He looked back and saw the flickering changes in her face: concern, confusion, surprise, affection, sympathy, amusement. Then John saw the quivering bottom lip and muttered, “Shit,” under his breath. Sherlock turned to look at him with panic, but John drew himself up and nodded at him with tight lips and a stern look. Sherlock nodded and took a deep breath. He looked back at her and braced himself. She looked up at him and said something. He gave a tiny nod and she approached him as if she were walking a tightrope. She stuck out her arms and he lifted his. She grabbed him gently around the waist and he managed to place one arm around her shoulders. They held their positions for a few seconds, then stepped away from each other and avoided eye contact. Then Molly opened the door and John heard Sherlock saying, “…never speak of this again.”
What would fortify his will? Some reminder of success—the chocolate factory? The museum?
“John. Someone’s life may be at risk.”
When he could reach it, John held his head and smeared his lips across Sherlock’s face. Heaving and winded, he put up no resistance. John raided his mouth while he came back to himself. When the last of the tremors passed through him and he had softened enough to slip out of John, Sherlock lifted himself up on his hands and looked at him in awe. “That was almost worth waiting for.”
He cleared his throat, and firmly, said, “I want you to count this time. Then I’ll ask you a question and you’ll answer it. Are you ready?”
“I spoke to him. He says he’s still at the office.” Lestrade tried to interrupt, but John held up his hand as if Lestrade could see him, and continued. “I know, I know, but he’s got to be there. I dialed him at your desk. He couldn’t have faked that.”
It’s getting loud.--SH
Sherlock sat back in his chair, steepled his fingers and looked pointedly at John. “Well?”
“—but Raul has worked out a few kinks in my thighs, that I’m sure—“
Sherlock groaned in frustration and arching his back, he moaned, “Touch me. I need you to touch me.”
Sherlock led the way to the dining room. When Mycroft saw them, he was surprised and placed his napkin on the table. He stood and beckoned toward his private office, where they could speak freely, but Sherlock shook his head and pointed to the library; there would be fewer people there at dinnertime but silence was still mandatory. Mycroft’s surprise turned to suspicion.
Sherlock opened the paper and removed the center few sheets, handing the rest of it to John. He spread them on the floor of the cab and knelt down on them giving him a knowing smile.
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “Oh. Right. Of course. Of course. I’ve learned my lesson. But maybe we should take photos anyway, just to remind me,” he said innocently. Sherlock found the idea of his sore arse very erotic. Not at the time of the actual soreness of the arse, but later it could be quite intriguing: remembering the sexual tension surrounding the event, knowing it was John who’d made it sore, that no one else would see this part of him, of them, that it didn’t always have to hurt quite so much... He locked eyes with John for a few fraught seconds.
John said, “Tights. Don’t forget tights.”
Sherlock whined.
“I’d rather just get on with the sentencing.”
John hadn’t said a word and he thought Greg would just keep on, but the monologue was interrupted by a text from the devil himself.
Sherlock lifted only his eyes from a gelatinous, black mess. John thought the arachnid phase had ended with the Brazilian Wandering Spider.
Exasperated with him now, John gave him another and asked, “Any more clever remarks?” Sherlock shook his head with gritted teeth, sniffling and whimpering.
Sherlock tilted his hips in hope of directing John’s fingers, but his surgeon’s hands were confident and precise. They continued back down, trailing along the calves and smoothing along the arches of those long thin feet. Sherlock wriggled his toes and sat himself back on his heels, squeezing his thighs together in search of more stimulation, but John pushed him back up onto all fours and continued stroking almost everywhere he could reach, everywhere except for where Sherlock wanted it most. John could see him starting to clench all the muscles he’d been working so hard to relax. He was rocking back and forth a little now.
John walked towards him and grabbed his hand, trying to keep him moving. “The penny drops. Now tell me where the discomfort and embarrassment comes from, my savant idiot.”
Sherlock began to tremble, clutching at the concrete and trying to control his frantic desire to… “Move, please, John, move. Fuck me.”
John shook his head. More childish thinking.
Sherlock groaned again. It would be excruciating.
John ducked his head down to hide his smile and tucked into his eggs.
“I am, currently, sitting at the desk where you left me.”
Sherlock turned around and John desperately tried to think of something to say, to keep Kasseem’s eyes off his bloody… “So how long have you been hanging round the gym?”
“Why was she crying this time?”
“It’s not your fault John! You’ve done everything you possibly can!”
He felt the beginning of his orgasm like an ember glowing at his center and the flame grew with every lift and plunge. He ratcheted up the pace and drove forward, knowing how close he was and revelling in it. Distantly he heard John’s encouragement, “That’s it, yes, come now, I’ve got you,” and it loosened a knot of hesitancy (shame?) secreted away somewhere inside him. When it flared up, he was consumed from the inside out. He called out, “John! My John. Mine.” The truth of the words sent the pleasure radiating to the ends of every nerve. He trembled with the strength of it. John nursed him through, clenching around him and wringing more spasms out of him. He reached for his shoulders. The motion drew another ripple of sensation out of Sherlock and he shuddered as if he’d had a chill. With the irrational urge to keep him warm, John pulled him close.
You’ve done so well. We’re all so proud of you.--JW
And so it continued, John interspersing questions with spanks from the paddle that noisily punctuated his words. He worked Sherlock through a timeline of the events again, this time highlighting his choices, their results, and the alternate paths he might have taken. When he began to review Sherlock’s history with Lestrade, the defenses began to come down. His bum had gone past pink and was red by now. Sherlock had begun to grunt and squirm after each swat. John steadied him with a palm on his back.
John narrowed his eyes at him and took a step forward.
Abruptly, John’s characteristic authority returned. “You know, I think you’re right. I think I will come with you tonight. I’d like to know what’s going on in this,” he clenched his jaw, “gym…of yours.”
“Mmm, I don’t know, maybe companionship, friendship. Contentment? Affection. Love, maybe?”
The ache and sting were beginning to sink in and John knew Sherlock would break quickly.
He froze, then turned toward John with a puzzled look on his face.
Sherlock finally met John’s gaze. He somehow looked very small. A fist gripped John’s heart but he tried not to let it show. “You know no one is trying to debase you. That’s exactly what Molly was afraid of. So listen.”
Sherlock’s jaw eased slightly, then the corner of his mouth lifted in a sly smile. “Yes, Captain.”
It proved to be even more difficult than either of them had feared. Sherlock paced, juggled pens and pencils, did some virtual composing, but by the time John’s stomach growled for lunch he had nothing but scratched out, crumpled up pages. When John called him to the table, he turned from where he was staring out the window and shouted in frustration. “This is impossible! I’m never going to be able to think of anything. Nothing sincere, certainly.”
“Oh, GOD, John! We have a CASE! Get up! Go take your shower!”
John added just a touch of severity to his voice. “Not the way it works, Sherlock. I decide when the comforting is over. Up you get and to the bed.” He held on to his upper arm as he helped him up. Sometimes Sherlock was unsteady on his feet after a spanking, whether it was from the soreness or his wobbly frame of mind, wasn’t easy to tell. Whatever it was, he’d come close to falling once, and John wasn’t taking any chances. Sure enough, he swayed a bit and John stepped behind him and grabbed both arms. He didn’t point out that, in fact, Sherlock was
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN? JW
“I say stop.”
“No, you just said ‘sit early’. Your thumb has to--perhaps you should leave it to me.”
Mickey looked slightly impressed that John seemed to know a little jargon. He pointed toward a man in the center ring, kneeling in front of a short stool. “Jack’s on. Doug’s got a date. Might be getting serious.”
IRENE MARIE ADLER
“Well then, shall we?” Mycroft began, moving out towards the landing and onto the steps, the accompanying tap of the umbrella alerting the small group in the foyer of his imminent arrival.
“Reasonable.” Sherlock murmured by way of an answer. He leaned down and pulled at Marcus’ meaty shoulder to flop him over onto his back. The ungraceful motion elicited a highly inappropriate curse from Marcus himself, whose bleary eyes slowly opened around the dirt mashed into his face.
that gorgeous, clever tongue, lapping and licking up every trail of slick that had weaved its way between the Omega’s sparse and downy blond hairs that grew upon his strong and lean thighs.
It was full of hanging files, each one marked on top with a date scrawled on a small rectangular piece of paper hastily shoved inside a tiny plastic label holder. There were dozens in this one drawer alone, and John had no idea what they meant, if they were important, or useful at all to the case.
He didn’t think John would mind if he was a little bit late (
“John?” He asked gently, more gently that he would usually.
, what are you doing?
Sherlock inhaled, seemingly to gather his thoughts a moment before he began.
“Do make it quick Mycroft, some of us have actual legwork to do, and we both know how much
The Alpha’s mouth twitched in an unconscious grin as he deftly unbuckled John’s belt and pulled it, sinuously, in one swift motion out from the loops and tossed it away, unconcerned as it landed in a serpentine heap across the room by the printer.
John buried his face in the mattress and his back shook, but Sherlock couldn’t tell if he was groaning or laughing. He was nervous for a moment, afraid he’d gone too far. Until John turned around, trying to suppress his smile, saying, “Look, I don’t think you’re trying to get me off, I think you’re trying to get revenge, and that’s not on. So if you’re going to fuck me, fuck me already. I’m getting boooooorred.” He couldn’t quite pull off Sherlock’s baritone.
John widened his eyes. “I believe it might be a corollary of all the other things you weren’t feeling before I came along.”
“Actually you might. You won’t enjoy it, though.”
It was John’s turn to roll his eyes. “Do you think I’ve lost track?”
The noises were as arousing as the physical contact, the sound of tasting and licking and sucking. John slid his hand down Sherlock’s neck, around his shoulder and over his ribs, touching each one the way Sherlock fingered the strings of his violin. He dipped into the indentation between his belly and the curve of his hip and replaced Sherlock’s hand with his own. The skin on his bollocks was silky soft contrasting with the wiry curls he could tangle with his thumb. He did the same tangling in the hair on his head, scratching his scalp, softly enough that Sherlock trapped John’s hand up against the wall, turning from side to side, trying to increase the pressure.
John gave him a predatory smile and said, “Almost eight o’clock.”
“No, Sherlock, Christmas is in December, no, February fourteenth, Valentine’s Day! Hearts, chocolates, flowers? Day for lovers?”
John would trap the coveralls between them in front, sliding up and down against Sherlock a little and driving up his own respiration rate. He would let go of the coveralls then, and use his hands to spread over Sherlock’s arse and cup the curves of him so that they filled his broad hands. He would spend a minute or two, grinding and groping, maybe even dipping between the cheeks for a visit, just long enough to draw out some lovely whimpering sounds that he could catch directly from Sherlock’s mouth. Then he would help Sherlock find the sleeves of the garment so he could slide his arms into them. He would draw it up to cover his back. In his mind, John slid his hands from Sherlock’s shoulders, dipping his thumbs into the valleys adjacent to his collarbones. He envisioned himself brushing over his nipples then returning, with a little more pressure, then giving them something between a squeeze and a pinch. Sherlock would suck in air and jerk his head down to look in surprise at his own body’s response and the sounds he made. In the shower, John echoed the whoosh of Sherlock’s imaginary breath, and his cock jerked at the image: Sherlock, staring down in shocked confusion and admiration at how John played his body the way he, himself, played his violin. John thought, ‘I do that to him. He didn’t know what his body could do, what was possible, because I’m the only one who can do it for him.’ He stroked himself faster, trying to keep his grunting as quiet as he could.
“What about in this particular case?” John asked as he walked toward the bed. He adjusted his pyjama bottoms to accommodate his rapidly swelling cock.
As soon as the door closed behind them, John took hold of Sherlock, dragged him around the corner of the building and pushed him up against the wall. He had a dangerous smile on his face. “What were you playing at, Sherlock? Trying to fire me up. Letting everybody put their hands on you, flashing your bits for them? Letting them touch you?”
John let the tone go unremarked. He bustled about and brought two tablets, a glass of water, a cool, wet flannel, and the jar of ointment to the bedside. He sat on the edge.
Sherlock was indignant. “John, you can trust me. You don’t need to—”
“I apologize. It’s a lovely breakfast.” He snogged him and Sherlock relented. He held the kiss, licking into John’s mouth, and nipping his lower lip. “Ow. Do we have time for a little something?”
Sherlock tilted his chin back and John nuzzled his face, then rubbed his cheek and nose on the skin of his throat. He breathed deep the smell of him, revelling in the slight tang of sleepy sweat. It notched up his desire and tempted him to taste and he lapped up the saltiness with the flat of his tongue. He left a trail right up the line of his pulse to the soft hollow behind his ear, between jaw and skull. It was a fail-proof trigger point, and Sherlock inhaled sharply, making a whistling sound that was John’s cue. He licked and sucked, knowing that Sherlock would squirm in embarrassment and arousal at the sloppy, wet sounds. It was a triumph, to know that he was the one wringing the reactions out from under that exterior, usually so cold and forbidding.
“I’ll go check.” He left.
The orange gelatinous slime was niggling away at the back of John’s mind and although he was savouring the temporary tranquility, duty called. He gowned up and attacked the viscous compounds, wondering if he oughtn’t get a permit for their disposal. He came to his senses.
Fortunately for the moment Sherlock was asleep as he normally would be at 7 in the morning. It was a brilliant fall day with sunshine as crisp as the temperature. That was not going to help. It was easier to get him out of bed on a grey London morning.
“I’ve seen enough. Get busy.”
John continued to work on his bum and when he finished he put the gel in the drawer of the night table and got Sherlock the promised shirt. He slid it over his head and helped him straighten it out in front. “Sure you won’t be cold, love?” Sherlock grunted something and John grabbed a novel from the bedside table and arranged himself, head on a pillow, leaning against the headboard. As soon as he was horizontal, Sherlock threw an arm and a leg over him, sliding over to get as much contact as he could. John pulled his head farther up on his chest and wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s neck so that he could hold the book with both hands. Sherlock was snoring softly in two minutes. Poor thing, thought John. We’ve only just started. John read until his head started to nod, perhaps half an hour more and joined him in sleep.
“Christ, your mouth.”
John hurried Sherlock through the squad room to minimize the number of insulting deductions and they presented themselves at Lestrade’s desk. He didn’t lift his head from his paperwork and forgoing a greeting, spoke directly to John. “I’m not gonna fight with him about lunch, so I hope you fed him. And if you’re not here by 4, I’m leavin’ him in a cell wrapped in a jacket.”
Sherlock ground his hips against the mattress and growled, “I can’t THINK anymore. Pants. The elastic in your pants and now you’re finished. Fuck me. John. Now.”
“But it’s embarrassing anyway.”
“Now, why did she interrupt her only afternoon off?” Another five randomly placed.
John kissed the top of his head on his way to the bedroom and slept through to late afternoon. He entered upon an unusual sight in the sitting room. Sherlock was standing at his music stand and making notes on sheet music, holding an invisible violin. Humming. Sherlock Holmes was humming. He was deeply engaged and startled when John asked, “What are you doing?”
“Yes.”
The thrill of the chase lit in Sherlock’s eyes and John licked his lips at the sight of his hunter. Sherlock hefted it, trying to gauge the weight. A gram for the box, maybe two for the contents? What could possibly be so light? Couldn’t be any type of jewelry; wasn’t a typical shape anyway. John smirked. His brilliant detective was puzzled already. He shook it, but obviously, John had thought far enough ahead to wrap whatever it was in tissue and the sound was indistinct at best. Sherlock’s nose crinkled in frustration. Next he sniffed. Nothing. He held it up to the light.
“What had you taken?
“Mrs. Winslow, I am so terribly sorry, but I’ve got to go. Family emergency.”
“What are you going to wear? Do you have anything that will give you a little space behind?”
“Course. Truth is, I don’t think he’d be able to get past it if you didn’t. He needs absolution.”
Mycroft sighed deeply, and said, “I know, I know. And I hope you know how deeply grateful I am that you’ve taken on the task. I apologize if I’ve offended you. Text me if all else fails. I suppose we could put him on a plane for a few hours.”
Put your headphones in and face the window.—JW
“Yah. Should we call Mycroft?”
John tried not to laugh, but it would not be denied and he snorted.
“I thought you were above such childish sentiment, Mrs Hudson.”
John kissed the back of his neck and said, “Whichever you like.” John pulled the shapeless, faded thing out of the wardrobe and helped Sherlock wiggle into it. He sighed at the coziness and John proceeded with his doctoring.
"Where exactly did my arrogance lead us into ruin?”
“And who is this session for?
John smiled and looked down to spare Sherlock some ego. He got ready and they headed out holding hands. John stayed uncharacteristically quiet as they walked. Usually he would comment or chatter out of habit, trying to draw Sherlock into conversation, but today he hoped that he would return to the topic of his reluctance to talk about his punishment, even to use the words in John’s presence, the one person he could be sure would be sensitive to his vulnerability. The longer they walked in silence, the more agitated he could sense Sherlock becoming, giving him sideways looks and fidgeting his hand in his pocket. John waited him out.
John held his finger in front of Sherlock’s mouth until Sherlock realized what he wanted and opened up. “Suck.” The word sent Sherlock’s Adam’s apple up and down his throat. As Sherlock sucked, John watched it intently. “That’s it. You’ll want it nice and wet.” A squeak leaked out around Sherlock’s lips. John pulled his finger out with a pop and said, “Good boy.”
Survival instincts triggered, the genius responded immediately. “Another example of how you see, John, but fail to observe. I was thoroughly repelled by The Woman’s occupation.”
John froze. He was dumbfounded. Sherlock hadn’t followed the script. They had established a ritual exchange at the beginning of the arrangement because at first, Sherlock had been incapable of independently identifying any misbehavior on his part and didn’t understand the difference between explaining and apologizing. The idea that his behavior had emotional consequences for others, was far beyond him.
Sherlock stilled and John could practically hear him thinking. He lifted his head and stared at John for a few seconds. John said, “What? You’re not pleased? You’re off the hook. Back to normal.”
Raul walked over greet John but he had to wait while the man stared at Sherlock unbelievingly. Coming back to himself, he grinned back at him and said, “You wanker.”
I'm a natural ma'am doin' all I can
“You’re not listening to me at all, John.”
He made Sherlock take the pills and brought another flannel to replace the one that had drawn the heat off. After that, the gel. He had been hoping the stripes wouldn’t bruise, but professionally, he wasn’t optimistic. He rubbed Sherlock’s back until he judged the aloe would be more beneficial. He squeezed directly from the tube along the paths that the cane had left. Spreading it as delicately as he could with only the tips of his fingers, Sherlock still drew a whistling breath into his lungs. “I know, I know. We’re all finished. You can relax now. Try to sleep.” He continued the soothing motions until all of the welts were covered.
Going well?—JW
Critical error. Sherlock’s hands froze. He let go of John and took the pillow off his head. He was suddenly and shockingly alert. He propped himself up on his elbows.
“Damn right I was relieved! When I saw you behind that desk, my heart…” John realized he was too angry to continue and took a few deep breaths.
John came to with a gasp, like a swimmer whose head had burst up from the water, drew himself back and slammed into Sherlock, who grunted with the impact. “Yeah… oh yeah… oh yeah…* Again, faster.”
He sat.
The stair door flung open as Lestrade was shouting, “Where’s his skinny-arse? He’s in the right place because he’s about to become a homicide victim.” He caught John’s eye and growled, “Oh no, he’s not going anywhere till I get my hands on him.” He ran towards them, pushing rolling chairs out of the way and skirting desks. John angled himself between Lestrade and his prisoner, looking over his shoulder at the lift indicator arrow. With two desks left as the only barrier between Sherlock and a painful death, the lift chimed and the door opened. John shoved him in and Sherlock punched the close door button frantically. They could hear Lestrade as he reached out his arm, trying to stop the door from closing, but it was too late. They were away, at least for the moment.
John knew where this was headed-straight to the bottom of the well. It was as easy for Sherlock to send himself spiraling into despair, as it was for him to shoot off like a rocket at the thought of a serial killer. It might be one of the reasons he had turned to drugs, for their stabilizing effects on his emotions, rather than the highs most people assumed he was chasing.
He called Mrs. Hudson, who had apparently already been briefed by Mycroft. She answered, “I’m heading home now, dear. I’ve phoned Angelo and the Thai place. I’ll keep running down the take-away places. Don’t worry. I’m sure he hasn’t gone back.” Those grannies.
The mound shuffled itself towards the center of the mattress and he sat. He tugged the cover down and tried to comb the tangled curls into some kind of order.
Mrs. Hudson called up the stairs. “All is forgiven, Sherlock dear. Be brave.”
“Any ordinary person would be wanting dinner soon. I wanted dinner half an hour ago.” Walking up behind him, John wrapped his arms around him and kissed the back of his neck. Sherlock tilted his head around so John could reach his temple and he hummed.
“Hiding was selfish and may have seemed funny from your point of view, but from Greg’s perspective it was potentially devastating.” He tried again to wipe his face, but Sherlock was too deep in his misery to worry about a messy face. He wasn’t even trying to protect his arse from the pressure of John’s lap. Sherlock wouldn’t feel that pain until he had processed the emotional pain. John let him cry himself out. He was anticipating his own aching muscles from the unusual exercise, so, eventually, he manoeuvred Sherlock into standing up. He helped him step out of his bottoms and pulled him to the side of the bed. He held his hand while he pulled the duvet and sheets down and drew the dressing gown off his shoulders. Sherlock was swaying on his feet and John turned him so he could kneel on the mattress and lower himself with assistance to lie flat on his front. He was still taking shaky breaths but seemed stable, so John said, “I’m going to get the gel, all right? I’ll just be a moment.”
Sherlock took it carefully and asked the question with his eyes.
“Were you breathing?”
John grabbed his head and gasped, “Bloody hell, Sherlock. You haven’t even touched me yet.” Sherlock could feel John trembling with desire by now and he grinned smugly, inordinately pleased with himself. He sucked on the cloth where it was soaked through, and said, “Delicious. Better than tiramisu.”
“You’re always hungry. I want to sleep. Besides, my arse hurts.” John reached down to see for himself. Definitely welts left behind.
“Would yours? Honestly, Sherlock, would your life be easier without Mycroft saving your arse, your life, when you really need it? Would you be here at all?”
John smiled at his attempt to avoid answering and replied, “Perhaps another thing to work out on our walk. I’m going to finish off the chicken for salad and then put up the carcass for a pot of soup. If you finish in time, I’ll let you do the dissection.”
“I don’t want to wake up. Don’t stop.” John squeezed the nubs gently and Sherlock covered his head with the pillow, wriggling just the tiniest bit under John’s fingers. John took that as an invitation and started kissing from the tip of his chin, down his breastbone and all the way through his wiry pubic hair. When he reached the Promised Land, he closed his lips, nuzzling up and down the length of him as slowly as he could. Sherlock reached his impossibly long arms down to John’s shoulders, began to feel his way around like a blind man. He moved his hands up and down John’s neck and then around to his cheeks, arching his back a little when John’s tongue poked out and began leaving a trail of saliva everywhere he went.
It was a delicious breakfast. Sherlock cooked so seldomly, that it was easy to forget that he was a chemist, in and out of the kitchen. His arse had cooled off enough that John was able to coax him to sit gingerly on a sofa cushion at the table. He knew that after this evening, it would be at least a couple of more days before he’d be able to manage it again, and John thought he should take advantage of the opportunity while he could. They cleaned up together after the meal and John asked him, “Would you prefer to walk now or later, love?”
Raul said, “Is that the spot, then?”
Sherlock hunted and emptied several boxes onto the floor and finally came up triumphantly with a splattered set of white coveralls that he would positively swim in. Contact with his skin would be minimized.
John cut her off. “You’re not responsible for this and neither am I. I’ll make it up--” She cut him off in return, pushing him out.
Sherlock raised himself up on one elbow and glared disapprovingly. “You did all the work,” he said grouchily.
“I’m sorry if my words reveal an unpleasant truth, then.”
“You know I don’t know much about it, Sherlock. What does a cornerman do for you, exactly?’
John nodded. “There’s my good boy.”
“In what way?”
When John asked him why he was being punished, his responses had been “I was bad,” or “Because you’re angry.” John had to teach him that the answer was, “I misbehaved,” or “I broke the rules.” He would then have to lead him step by step through his actions, helping him to fill in the gaps where his rational brain missed the emotional stepping-stones between action and consequence. It had taken a very long time, and Sherlock hated it. He still wasn’t very good at it. They’d barely started the work of recognizing the impact on others. This answer was something radically new: a detour, straight to the fallout, the effect of his behavior on another person. Specifically, in this particular instance, the one about to spank his arse. Sherlock had just taken a quantum leap and John wasn’t sure how to proceed.
Please answer.—JW
“Bloody hell,” Lestrade shouted. John heard the shriek of the brakes and the rev of the engine as Lestrade negotiated a reverse turn.
The side of John’s mouth quirked into a half smile and he said, “Funny how you only think so when it’s agreeable to you. Not when I tell you it’s time to eat or sleep.” He grabbed some lotion from the night table and warmed it up in his hands. He straddled Sherlock’s legs and started with light strokes on the backs of his thighs. He gradually increased the pressure until he was kneading the muscles. When he found a knot he focused on it, sliding his thumbs over it and around it, until he could feel it start to soften and break up. When the hamstrings were loose, he ran his palms over Sherlock’s sharp hipbones and skipped over the bruises. They made him feel guilty, despite knowing their necessity. He dug his thumbs into the cords of his lower back on either side of his spine but Sherlock started up with a gasp.
John pointed at the large wall calendar they’d hung over the desk. Sherlock had scoffed at the gold stars John had insisted on using to mark each clean day but John knew better. When he thought John wasn’t looking, he ran his fingers over them, one by one. “We’ve got all the time in the world. Now. Leftovers or a nice curry? I’m starving.”
You know how I hate it when you repeat yourself, John. SH
Sherlock pretended to ignore him.
“Ok.”
He idly scrolled the contacts in his mobile and saw Angelo’s. Could Angelo handle him for a few hours? Although upon visualizing the kitchen, John saw cleavers, knives, pots of boiling water and shuddered at the potential carnage. He shook his head, realizing his gross miscalculation.
“Of course, John, I’m not a child—“ He cut himself off and John and Mrs Hudson burst into laughter. Sherlock huffed and turned his back on them, screeching on his violin.
He sighed. “Probably.”
“Oh yes, several. Gary is my favorite—“
John,
John gave him a swat and said, “Unfortunately, I’ve become the world’s leading expert, thanks to a patient of mine who’s a chronic sufferer of the syndrome, which is marked by an exceptionally hard head and abnormally sensitive buttocks.” He kept gently massaging the cream in.
As he brought the sandwiches to the table, John mumbled, “Mm-hmm. Drama queen”
“Absolutely impossible today, John. If you had called me yesterday I would have been able to handle him. I was in a Category 3 bunker with a soundproof room and we all would have been perfectly safe.”
He texted Sherlock.
Sherlock grabbed his wrist and pulled him back. He choked out the same words, “We don’t need it,” and took John’s hand, guiding it under his coat and around his hip to the cheek of his arse. John gripped the perfect curve of it and squeezed. Sherlock ground his hips backward against his hand and the tips of John’s fingers slid on something slippery. He froze, then gingerly allowed his fingers to follow the trail of slick into the crevice. Sherlock was dripping with lube. Sherlock guided John’s hand further down and let him feel how it had spread to cover his perineum and his bollocks. John’s breath was puffing against Sherlock's neck, fast and shallow, his erection strangled against the tightness of his trousers.
“He’s doing so well. 46 days. Please? We can’t leave him unsupervised—”
When John realized that Sherlock did not understand the concept of catharsis, he changed tactics for one last try. He talked to Sherlock while he was spanking him, trying to help him understand what exactly he had done wrong and why he should feel bad about it. The breakthrough came after a 10 minute spanking that barely reddened Sherlock’s bottom. He had casually thrown an insult at Mrs. Hudson, that had cut her to the quick.
Sherlock inhaled sharply and grabbed his wrist. He looked down at him with suspicion, but huffed out a breath in resignation. “What do I have to do?”
“Lestrade.” Five smacks on the left. He moved his arms up and buried his face in them. John could see the muscles in his arms trembling.
“I really do need to know. I wouldn’t pry otherwise.”
Sherlock couldn’t help himself but he at least had the self-respect to mutter the words. “He’s the toddler.”
John let him pontificate while he clicked away with his mobile. Whatever might distract Sherlock from his discomfort was worth suffering through. He threw in an occasional “Uh-huh” and “I see” to keep the theorizing flowing smoothly.
“Yes he does. And you’re damned lucky, aren’t you?”
“Shh. It’s ok. We’ll be ok. We’ll figure it out together. This was just a bump in the road. Look how well you’re doing.”
Sherlock looked at him very intently, as if he were trying to interpret a new language. Then he nodded his head slowly. “I can do that. I can just be with her. If she cries. I don’t have to fix it?”
Sherlock watched him with the realization that while it might be a thrill to poke a bear with a stick, you'd better know when to stop.
Sherlock murmured petulantly, “I liked that one.”
Bouncing on his toes, Sherlock clapped his gloves together and Mickey said, “Why don’t you warm up on the bag, Featherweight?” He nodded and bounced over.
Mycroft stood and lifted his arms in the opening move of what would have been an epic swirling and flashing of hands that would probably have ignited the dust in the room, if any had been permitted to exist there. But there were reasons Mycroft was the British government and one of them was his ability to keep his head while those around him were losing theirs.
he thought.
Sherlock looked back at him with a devilish grin on his face, pleased silly he’d been able to rile him up. “You weren’t really going to say not fair, were you?”
Kasseem laughed and John fumed. “Hurry up Sherlock, it’s getting late.”
“Well, Doctor, I am a particularly advanced student. I was thinking of both, to be honest.”
Sherlock sat or rather stood at the microscope, mounting slides and taking notes, until Greg showed up at eleven to take their statements. He wickedly offered Sherlock a chair, which he declined with tightened lips. Greg nodded in satisfaction and John looked down at his shoes in false modesty. Sherlock traipsed around the room in frustration, eager to get back to his microscope. Eventually Greg finished and John resigned himself to several more hours working at the desktop computer on his blog while Sherlock peered through his lenses. Molly cleared off, “for a date with a bloke from radiology,” she made sure to point out.
They carved up Mrs. Hudson’s chicken for lunch and dinner and walked to Tesco for cleaning supplies, milk, and Sunday’s meals. Mrs. Hudson called to check in on them and scold John about being too rough on Sherlock. They bickered for a few minutes.  She was the indulgent grandmother to John’s stern father figure. “Surely he’s been punished enough. After all, he didn’t do anything so terribly self-destructive. Technically, he didn’t leave the room at all. To be fair, we all probably over-reacted.”
Thanks again to tiaoconnell for being a spectacular beta and for her moral support!
“I quite enjoyed it. I’m definitely going to be coming back.”
, saying, “About a year now. They keep calling me a ring rat”—Sherlock barked out a laugh—“but it’s not true. They’re just teasing. They’re a great bunch of mates.”
“Because they’re sad.” His voice broke.
“You’re always a bear with a sore head when you’re hungry. I’m used to it by now.” He gave him a kiss and John felt thoroughly ashamed of himself.
John replied agreeably, “You’re right. We’ll have to revise our terms in future. Designated meals? Standard? Traditional? You choose.”
Sherlock knelt on the bed and laid down on his front, groaning from the pain. John went around to the other side of the bed and slid in beside him sitting with his back against the headboard, waiting for Sherlock to allow himself to ask for what he wanted. Eventually, he tugged on John’s shirt to get him to slide down until he was flat on his back. Sherlock threw an arm and a leg over him and crept imperceptibly across the bed until he was stretched full-length on top of him.
John grinned. “All right. Do you have a plan?”
“Sh-sh-she came home early from her game.” He spanked and Sherlock whimpered.
“Favorite.” The blue light in his eyes seemed to be draining away, leaving them a somewhat steelier grey.
Sherlock hadn’t finished the letter, so he spent some time on its final preparations, then some virtual composing. He said, “I’m actually looking forward to examining the results of this experiment, John. Just think, if it’s successful, I can appear to be taking notes, completely absorbed during Lestrade’s trivial, tedious interrogations when I’m actually composing! Lestrade has developed the ability to tell when I’m in my mind palace and it’s infuriating that he can call me back to attend to his drivel. He’ll have no idea that I’m paying no attention to him whatsoever!”
John was impressed again and relieved. Good old Greg. That project might actually buy them a few hours of blessed silence while Sherlock integrated the new data into his mind palace. In fact, with another obligatory huff, he shrugged off his coat while walking around the desk. There was a wardrobe off to the left and, keeping an eye on the desk, he opened the door and hung up his coat. He walked back to the desk and sat down.
The weekend is almost over and might even end earlier than expected, but there's always something.
“I really am getting hungry. Are you sure you need this massage?”
They settled on curry and although Sherlock stalled brilliantly, he ate a plateful, and a few teaspoons of coconut rice pudding. They cleaned up together and Sherlock started to fidget. John knew he’d ordinarily be reaching for his violin or laptop. He checked the time and said. “You’ve got a couple of hours before the…” He stumbled then recovered, “we get ready for bed. You could start one of your letters.” Sherlock let his head drop back and stared at the ceiling. “Sooner begun, sooner done?” he said encouragingly. Sherlock dragged himself dramatically to the desk and made a production of paper rustling and pen seeking. John schooled his expression, which threatened to break into full-on smiling. “Who’s first?” he asked.
Sherlock was wearing chaps. Nothing but a pair of chaps. Made of black leather. They were basically a pair of leather trouser legs attached on either side of his hips to a belt. They hugged his thighs like…ballet tights. The top of each leg was cut off on the diagonal, leaving a perfect triangle of Sherlock's pelvis completely bare. His white skin positively glowed in the blue security light from the building, the dark curls trailing down from his navel and running below the belt, looking jet black, not their true chestnut. He flapped the coat shut again and looked around the corner to check the door of the gym. In a low gruff voice, he asked, “Do you wanna touch? Do you wanna touch me*…” He pulled the coat open again. “There?”*
He spoke immediately to forestall rejection.
“Have you determined the fugitive’s whereabouts during the loss of visual contact, Doctor?”
Sherlock thought. “Ummm…have a good time?”
“What I really want is to chin you, but I’m gonna leave it in your doctor’s hands.” He pointed his finger right at Sherlock’s chin and stared daggers at him, but turned toward John instead.
“Very well. How many times did I try to rehabilitate you? Include the spring of your first year at Oxford.”
12 smacks.
“How many times, Sherlock?”
John burrowed down deeper and wondered dreamily before slipping away for the last time, to sleep.
John said, “Exactly. Slide over.” Sherlock moved gingerly off to the side while John lifted Sherlock’s arm from his chest. He wiggled out from under his leg and finally free, he drew the sheet up over his back.
Not likely. Keep on those cases—JW
He smiled fondly. “I wouldn’t have it any other way. He’s lucky to have you.”
“We did well last month, Sherlock, but you can’t count on that continuing. And you don’t want to rely on Mycroft. Besides we talked about building up our retirement fund for a cottage. Sussex? Beehives? Remember? This is a way to do that.”
thought John. Practically irresistible. He marveled again, that no matter the setting, the man was shockingly beautiful. John licked his lips and glanced nervously towards the door again. He moved to stand between it and Sherlock, as if to screen him from anyone who might enter. Sherlock took his time, stretching out and groaning, as if his muscles were aching, at one point, bending over completely with his hands on his lower back. “Raul is really going to have to loosen this up for me,” he said, smiling to himself.
