“What, Dean,” he said frustratedly.
Once it was all over, Dean and Cas got dressed and Castiel healed his wound from Rusty. They both walked out of the barn, leaving Rusty all alone now, well alone with the clown corpses. Rusty wasn’t sure how to feel now. Rusty had finally gotten what they wanted, but now that it was over, they felt empty inside, like there was a hole inside them. Rusty just wanted them back, wanted them to come back for him.
“Dean,” Cas called out, yet not too loudly as he rushed to his side, taking a better look at him and his injuries as he did so. The head wound was the worst of it as far as he could tell, but it didn’t look too bad and was also accompanied by a few scrapes and bruises that came from being dragged through the woods at such high speeds.
Jack tried to offer Cas a smile, one that felt a bit forced because even though Cas may have been right, he still felt guilty. Cas would have never made the deal that led him to death if it hadn’t been for Jack and when the time came for the Empty to collect on that deal, Jack had just left. He didn’t consider how it would feel, not entirely, to his family, to Sam and Dean. But now he needed to make it right, he needed to fix things.
Cas sighed as he continued to use the wall for support, not able to keep his mind from wandering back to that first moment that he arrived in the motel room… the way Dean was bent over and how he had a fucking perfect view of-
“Those thoughts you’ve been having, well they were so loud and full of longing that I was able to pick up on them as I would with a prayer.”
Dean didn’t know how to be happy though, so he tried to do something,
Cas shivered at the memories, his greatest failures in life, most seeming to circle around the older Winchester brother, all the times he let him down, he failed him, the rage, the disappointment he saw in his eyes when he looked at him. It haunted him.
Castiel also knew that heaven could use every last angel it could find, but he didn’t want to put it in harm's way again because he made another mistake, because he chose someone who could cause an even greater problem than before, someone who could do so much harm. He had to be careful, after all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and that seemed to be his life. Always with good intentions and most of the time, something went wrong because of it or because he was too blind to see other outcomes.
“You- raising me? Seriously? That’s what you think you did?”
At that, Castiel finally broke, the tears escaping and flowing freely. It was the first time that he had ever heard Jack call him that and he was afraid that it would also be the last time. He hoped that it wouldn’t be but he needed to be practical here. He knew what Jack wanted to do going forward, how he didn’t want to be involved with things. He couldn’t help but feel sad, to feel like he was losing a part of himself.
Cas broke their eye contact, looking down at the mess he created.
“Oh uh, interesting…” Dean trailed off, not really knowing what to say next.
“Could you… do you think you could…” he said looking back up at Cas with pleading eyes, “I don’t want to be alone.”
“Okay fine, maybe I do have feelings for Dean, but that doesn’t matter right now.”
“Dean, I- I don’t understand, how did it, I- I wasn’t sure what to do, I was all alone and-”
“I was all alone then and everything went silent. No screaming, no rattling of the branches, nothing. I stayed by the campfire that whole night. Not moving. My dad told me to stay there where he could find me, so that’s what I did. I stayed there until the next morning when those hikers found me.”
how much Cas cared within that one simple act. It radiated off of Cas and into Dean, that feeling of love, no matter what kind of love he believed that to be, he still knew that in some way it was there. Each time he did it, he felt closer to Cas. Maybe it was crazy, but that’s what he felt.
It was a rough kiss, neither one of them bothering to be gentle. When Dean could actually no longer breathe, he roughly pushed the angel off of him. Unclothing them both, Dean pushed Castiel against another wall. He couldn’t help the anger that he felt beginning to boil beneath his skin though.
“Look, we both know Dean and how he tries to pretend that everything is fine, even now, or I guess
“Hello?”
Dean blinked, rubbing his eyes with the back of his free hand before the memories of the night before came flooding back.
He thought about the angel's hot mouth as it pressed against his own, with his body pressed flush against him and the wall. The way they moved together, each seemingly not able to get enough of the other, just wanting them closer.
he thought to himself as he stripped down and turned on the water before stepping into the shower.
“Well, I didn’t say that. Do you wanna call her now?”
Dean wrapped his arms around the dog and scooped him up, carrying him into his room, and plopping him down on his bed with him. A small smile had managed to work its way onto his face at some point. He couldn’t help it, he was happy to see this dog again, once again showing up just when he needed him.
Brushing his fingers over it one last time, Dean took the towel off from around his waist, tossing it to the other side of the bed, not noticing where it had landed. Then, he placed one foot carefully through the hole, followed by the other before finally pulling the delicate lace up his legs and over his hips.
Cas got up from his crouch, his knees cracking as he rose. He walked back towards the chair and picked it up, carrying it to the other side of Dean’s bed, the right side. He set it against the wall beside his headboard, having to so it was facing Dean. Then he sat down.
“Yes?” he questioned expectantly.
“Just something that I had under my mattress…”
Dean was about to speak, to tell him it was fine and not to worry about it or to crack some stupid joke that he’d probably later regret, but was cut off by the buzzing of his phone on the table. With an almost inaudible sigh, he picked it up seeing that it was Jody on the line.
“Always,” Cas replied as if making a promise.
“I- I’m not broken…”
Castiel’s words broke him out of his almost dazed state.
He tried telling himself that he was only doing this because it’d be easier, his hand wouldn’t just be hanging in the way between them. It was only to make this easier, there was no meaning behind it.
“Dean, just listen to me for a second.”
“I- I love you too. I’m sorry I didn’t say it sooner. Please don’t leave me again...”
"Great. Fantastic. Could you please explain what the hell that feeling was? Because as far as I can remember, I've never felt
“Agree on what?” Dean had no idea what Cas was talking about.
It wasn’t just any dog though, it looked familiar, very familiar. Then the dog came rushing towards him and it hit him. Miracle. It looked just like that dog that Dean had found at the gas station… it couldn’t be could it? Maybe Jack had heard him after all, maybe it’s all he could do to help. Maybe he was trying to tell Sam to not give up hope.
Dean seemed to consider that for a moment before his chewing froze. Slowly, he swallowed the food down and looked at Cas wearily.
Dean slowly went to tear back the wrapping paper, something about it made him feel like he needed to be gentle with it. He wasn’t sure why, but it felt wrong to just tear it apart quickly.
“Okay… but why do you need my help with that? You have your own phone, Cas.”
Dean thinks about what happened. He thinks about it a
Castiel nods his head.
The bag wasn’t too big, probably about half the size of his own and it wasn’t completely full. He could tell that much, but that was about it. It was zipped shut, leaving Dean to wonder what was even inside it, how much stuff did Cas have in there that he actually needed a bag? It was weird, even for Cas. He hadn’t even thought that Cas owned enough things to put in that bag, so his brain started to think about what he actually owned that he would bring away from the bunker.
Mary was quite terrifying like this, rendering John speechless.
“Look, Cas, I don’t know how much Dean has told you, but knowing him it probably wasn’t much… but it wasn’t- things weren’t easy for him- or any of us- when you were gone…”
It was about three weeks later that Dean and Cas were set to leave for their little getaway. Jack was a little sad that he wouldn’t get to see them for two weeks, but Cas had promised him that they’d call every day, just to check-in. That seemed to make Jack feel a bit better.
“After that, I managed to wake up some of my brothers and sisters, and long-story-short, we managed to work together to torture the ancient cosmic being holding us there, which resulted in our escape back to Earth... back to Dean. Then Jack managed to find us, and escorted us to heaven.”
Jack felt bad after Cas came back, after what he said about him abandoning his family, especially at a time when they needed him most. He left them when they were so vulnerable and broken; when they had already lost a huge piece of their family and then he just walked away.
Rolling his eyes, Dean tried to fake hurt, but he couldn’t keep down his own little laugh that escaped him. He couldn’t help it, not when Cas’ laugh was so contagious. Both of them were soon overcome by little giggles, only fueled by the other’s laugh and not really anything else anymore. It was ridiculous, but the more ridiculous it was, the funnier it got. There was really no reason for them to be laughing, nothing was even really that funny, yet there they were and there were Sam and Eileen sitting across the table from them just staring at them as if they’d lost their minds.
“Well, now that that’s out of the way would you stop being so stubborn and tell me what’s the matter,” she spoke, her voice was warm yet commanding at the same time.
He blinked his eyes, looking down, he saw grass, he was laying on a field of grass, and then he looked around. There surrounding him were the rest of them, they were all there with him. They were all looking around, amazed. Smiles broke out across their faces as they took in the sight before them and realized that their plan had actually worked. They had done it, he had done it. He could save Dean, but he knew he needed to wait. He couldn’t just abandon everyone here, not like this. Some had been gone for far too long and so much had changed, most of which was only in the past few years. Now that they had time, he needed to finish explaining everything. The angels needed to know just how bad heaven had gotten, how needed they were, he also needed to fill them in on why that was and all the things that had happened since. He knew that once they got to heaven, they could probably fill in these angels, but it didn’t feel right just leaving them like that and unaware of everything. He needed to be there, to do things right for once. He owed them at least this much after everything.
He knows why. He was confused and afraid, there was so much happening. One minute he was fighting Death, thinking that he was going to die. He felt his heart literally being crushed. Funny isn’t it? Now he knows what that really feels like and how he would gladly take that pain in the place of this pain he was feeling now.
“Okay.... Why?” Now Dean was really confused. He hadn’t actually expected for Cas to say he had
“What about her?”
Dean wished he hadn’t, he wished that Cas had just waited, let them try to fight off Billie, at least that way he wouldn’t have to live without Cas, he wouldn’t have to live with thinking about what could have been. He knows that he’s being selfish, thinking like that, but he can’t find it in himself to care. He doesn’t know how to care anymore, he doesn’t have the energy or the strength to care about that right now. All he can think about is Cas. His head is full of what if’s and what might have been, all of the things that could have been possible, if only he knew how Cas had felt sooner, had he known that Cas
“No one…”
Castiel let out a sigh, not sure if it was out of relief or not.
As Dean sipped his coffee, he gazed out one of the windows facing the back of the cabin.
The little gasps that Dean coaxed out of the angel were heavenly; he never wanted them to stop. Dean’s hands were roaming around the newly exposed skin and soon, his mouth followed. Dean began to work his way down Cas’s chest, when Cas decided he had had enough.
That was all he managed to get out before he felt his orgasm take over, come spilling out on the table as Cas kept pounding into him.
“Doing what?”
Cas knew Balthazar just meant it as a sort of joke, but he couldn’t help but feel guilty about how he left Dean.
“No, Dean, shut up. Just listen to me for once.”
He trailed off, looking away from Cas.
“Oh, I see… You’re concerned… about me?”
A noise from beside him broke him out of his thoughts. Turning his head in the direction of the sound, he realized that it was only Cas. He was sitting upright again, his eyes blinking before finally settling on Dean who was already staring back.
Those few words, quiet and defeated, broke his heart. Seeing him like this was something he never wanted for Dean.
The errands they ran took up most of the afternoon. They made a stop for beer, the store for food and general supplies and then Dean also decided they should make a stop at a local pet store to grab a few things for Miracle as well.
The wave of the cool air against his skin wasn’t unexpected, but he still let out a surprised gasp when he felt it. He quickly wrapped a hand around himself, basking in the warmth it provided him.
“Don’t you dare be sorry, Cas. Don’t you dare.” His voice was breathless and wavering. “Cas I-”
Dean grabbed his boots and a hat and put them on. He also grabbed a pair of gloves and put them in his pocket for now. He was already wearing his cozy sweatpants and a sweater so he figured he’d be warm enough as it didn’t look too cold out today. It seemed a little gloomy out, but he didn’t want that to stop him. He went out into the little shed there and grabbed the shovel and then went back inside to go out their porch door.
“It’s alright. Dean, I know you wouldn’t- I know that you hadn’t meant anything by it. It’s alright. I was just… a bit shy about it, that’s all. I think maybe part of me is a bit relieved that I don’t have to hide it from someone anymore…”
“Mhmm.”
,” he whined. “Just take them off and fucking touch me.”
He heard some shuffling in the room and the clink of a bottle.
The conversation carried on, light and carefree. Miracle had also joined them, laying down at Dean’s feet. He was being good so Dean decided to give him a piece of bacon, much to Sam’s disapproval.
“Dean, why are your cold feet on me,” Cas mumbled, trying to push away Dean’s offending feet.
“Dean, I’m not here to judge you, I would- I could never do that.”
He stopped and took a shaky breath.
Dean swallowed, his eyes were wide. He wasn’t really sure what exactly to say here. This certainly wasn’t what he was expecting. He never thought that Cas… that Cas felt the same way that he did, that Cas could even feel something like that. He wanted to say something, to let him know, but then Cas’ face hardened a little.
Once, the mess had been dealt with, Dean suggested that Sam go show Jack where they set up the cage for the bunny, along with some toys, rabbit food and anything else that it might need. It was in it’s own separate room, so Jack could let it roam free in the room whenever he wanted, without having to worry about it escaping and getting into something it shouldn’t or getting lost in the bunker.
It was all because of Cas. He may have saved the world again because that’s what he does, he cares about it, cares about all the people there, but he also did it because of Cas,
The rest of the visit was fairly uneventful but in a good way. There was no shouting or crying which was always a plus and it was actually relatively pleasant. Dean didn’t mind the conversation, especially since David wanted to know more, he needed to know more about what took his family away from him. All these years he had no answers, but now…. Now he could finally get some.
“O-Okay. I’ll do my best,” he promised.
me to remove those too. Only then will I do so, and fuck, the things I’ve been waiting to do to you after that… The things I’ve imagined...”
“I think we’ll have a grand old time, John,” she said with a smirk. “Maybe I could introduce you to my son.”
“Okay you you just kinda gotta uh, flick your wrist. Gently though, you don’t want eggs flying everywhere, trust me,” Dean brought his other hand to Cas’ waist as he spoke, feeling Cas tremble under the touch.
it happened. That didn’t matter, though, because, at some point, a huge crack had appeared down the side of the sink.
Mary looked at Castiel now, placing a hand on his shoulder.
After a few moments, he relaxed enough for Cas to slip one finger inside of him.
He always felt so embarrassed if Cas turned his head towards Dean, feeling caught and turning into a clumsy mess for a few moments.
“Balthazar, are you there? Please, please wake up. I need you to wake up! I need your help. Bal, please. I know I may not deserve your help, but it’s not for me. I know you may not want to see me or even think about helping me, but I swear, I’m trying to do the right thing.”
“Is there something I should know? You guys have basically been attached at the hip the past few days.” Sam said with a wink.
This was too much, but still, Jack hadn’t told him why he was so different. His concern was growing more and more out of control by the second.
“Maybe that one cowboy one you like so much… Tombstone…? I think it was called?”
A dark look took over Castiel’s features, with his pupils blown wide. They both just stood there silently, Dean pretty damn sure that if he said anything it would be the last thing he said so he remained silent, waiting for Cas to speak first.
“Well, I guess you better find your own way down then.”
Cas dropped his hand then, looking down at the ground shyly, “I never thought it’d be so confusing…” he muttered under his breath.
Dean just holds on, breathing Cas in, finally able to breathe, finally able to stop the worry or stop himself from being crushed by just the thought of never being able to hold his angel again because here he was, and he never wanted to let go.
“Cas…” Dean choked out. His voice was hoarse, shaky even.
“Dean, slow down, it’s okay,” Sam said in a gentle voice, as if he was afraid at any moment Dean would turn around and run and never come back.
“Nothing’s wrong, Cas,” he insisted, his eyes returning to Cas’. “There was just a lot that you missed while you were gone. For starters, Lucifer came back-“
"I haven't thought about it yet, but it seems like whatever it is, it doesn't plan to stop anytime soon."
She turned back to Castiel once they had left the room, and gestured for Cas to take a seat, her sitting down as well. They were silent for a moment. Castiel felt a little uncomfortable, he felt like he was being examined. Shifting in his seat, he looked back at Rowena as if daring her to speak her mind. She just raised a brow at him before finally speaking.
“Hey there buddy. What’re you doing here,” he said, reaching out to pat his head.
Dean knocked on the door and they both stood there waiting for an answer.
Sam stopped mid-sentence, fully seeing who Dean was standing with when the two of them jumped apart at the sound of Sam’s voice.
“I agree, but this also looks like it happened recently. The… blood, still looks fresh. We are most likely in its hunting ground. It would be best if we had a safe area in case it comes back.”
“Well, as long as you’re prepared… and just like- just don’t make it angry… it doesn’t like that.”
The hunter rolled his eyes and watched how Cas' expression shifted from worried to satisfied, while he finished his burger. When he was done, he looked around for a second, before he took the angel's plate and placed his own in front of Castiel instead.
The second figure spoke then, a note of surprise in his voice.
“Oh, I was hoping we could maybe have a fondue? I thought you all might enjoy it.”
It only took about 5 minutes for Dean to finish with the bananas, and then he made his way back over to Cas, checking on the eggs and how Cas was holding up.
Now that Sam was gone, Castiel turned his face back towards Dean, who was still very much dying, coughing up his own blood.
Dean sucked in a shaky breath as his thumb hovered over the name. The name of the one he loved, the one he needed more than anything. Just seeing his name caused him to break just a little bit more, it made him want to double over in pain, but he couldn’t, not yet. He just needed to hear his voice,
Dean didn’t reply, but he also didn’t let go of Cas. He tugged on his hand, leading him to his bedroom. Once they were both inside, Dean shut the door, pulling Cas further into the room. Dean could see Cas had no idea what was going on or what he was doing and if he was being honest, he didn’t know what he was doing either.
Dean scooted around, tucking himself back under the blankets as he laid down again, this time on his side and facing Cas. He was comfortable.
Thank you all so much for reading! All the kudos and comments really brighten my day, I love hearing from you guys!
“Hey there,” he said, bending down to the girl's level. I think I have something that belongs to you…” He reached a hand into his jacket, and within a moment was pulling it back out, only this time it contained a small stuffed cat, the same one they’d found hours earlier. He’d held onto it this whole time. The only difference from then to now was that the small stuffie no longer had any trace of the blood and dirt that had covered it before.
“Woah, way to make a guy feel special,” Dean joked before closing his laptop and getting up, slapping a hand on Castiel’s shoulder as he walked by. “Come on.”
Dean was still confused by how fast everything had been moving then. He felt death coming for him, for Cas, and then Cas started talking. Started talking about experiencing a moment of true happiness. What was he even talking about? How did that have anything to do with them about to be killed by Death? How could that save them?
“From what Dean has told me, he is extremely homophobic and quite vocal about it too. Always has been and I don’t think he’d understand that I really don’t have a gender, he’d only see me as my vessel, the way I choose to look here for your sake.”
“What’re you, in love with my son or something?” John had only really meant it as a joke, of course, not really believing it, but then Cas looked at him, mouth pulled into a tight thin line and his eyes narrowed at him.
Then Rusty’s gaze shifted to the older Winchester.
Sam placed his hands on his hips, staring Cas down to let him know that he was being serious.
“I um, I turned angel radio back on for a bit. I thought it’d be nice to check-in, just to see how all the changes are going.”
Balthazar put his hand up, stopping Castiel’s rambling.
Cas laid a hand on Dean’s cheek then, and in an instant, they were both cleaned up, so Dean reached down and pulled a blanket that they had knocked onto the floor on top of them both. He pulled Cas even closer to him, placing a kiss on his forehead one last time before he started to doze off.
“Where’s Sam?” He questioned, his voice a bit higher than normal. Did Sam see them like that? Did he see Dean cuddling into Cas? He was starting to panic a little, just knowing that Sam would take every opportunity to make a joke about this later.
Dean just stayed silent. His jaw tensing at the words his father spoke.
Cas pulled the phone away from his ear then, just a few inches and turned his head to look at Dean. “Shh, go back to sleep.”
“Okay, that’s uh, that good then.”
Cas’ hand finally moved then, one moving to cup the back of Dean’s neck and the other placed on his hip.
“Cas, come on, back me up here man,” Dean nudges Cas’ shoulder with his own. “You must’ve had scrambled eggs once when you were human right? I could’ve sworn I even cooked them for you once.”
"Sorry, man, you just- not gonna lie, you surprised me there for a second. Here, let me help you."
They ended up watching two movies before Dean decided to call it quits. He was getting tired, almost nodding off near the end of the movie, but he still wanted to shower before bed. It had been a long ass day and a nice hot shower sounded pretty great. Grabbing his plate and empty beer bottles he headed to the kitchen.
So many maybes, but he didn’t have any answers. This dog brought up so many new questions, but it also gave him one thing. Hope.
All he heard as he was rushing down the hallway was a “sorry,” before he was gone.
UPDATE: I’m not gonna be posting this weekend because school is kicking my ass with the end of the semester. I was hoping I’d be able to finish the next chapter but that ended up not happening so I’ll be updating on March 20 or 21. Sorry!!
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas whispered into the darkness.
Dean's eyebrows shot up all of a sudden because that was something he definitely wasn't expecting.
Sam walked Miracle towards Dean’s door. Stopping outside and knocking gently.
Cas felt that he had, in one way or another, contributed to all of these angels' deaths, even if it wasn’t by his hands. Joshua, Kelvin, Muriel and Ambriel too, he had been present for all of their deaths, they were put in those positions because of him, because he agreed to an offer they made him, or he worked with them or tricked them into helping him, or he just let it happen.
“Do you see that?” Cas asked as his gaze stayed fixed on something far away in the bushes as if he thought it would disappear if he looked away.
The way Dean would stuff his face with food and sometimes start laughing halfway through the mouthful, even if it was kind of gross. His awkward little laughs or his jokes that only he seemed to laugh at. His obsession with pie and how he wouldn’t let it go if someone forgot to buy it, and when he did get it, he didn’t care where he was or who was around, it seemed as if it was the first meal he’d eaten in months, making noises of his approval that were audible to anyone near by.
“Just shut up, John. You heard her,” Bobby snapped out.
“Okay nevermind, just forget it. Could you just like, I don’t know stop staring at me or something?”
He looked Dean in the eyes and then back down to the lube.
I hope this little Miracle bit has made up for any pain I've caused you.
After a few moments, Cas leaned up a bit and placed a kiss on Dean’s lips and Dean kissed him back.
Castiel knew he had his wings back now, but he was so used to not flying by now and he just needed time. He needed to prepare himself for when he arrived at the bunker. He had been thinking about it while in heaven, but he always seemed to push it aside, telling himself he had time later to worry about that. But now, there was no later. There was only a few hours between him and Dean, less than a day's drive. He was so nervous to see him, but he also couldn’t wait. He just wanted to be with him now, right this second, but he knew he needed some time to think about it. This is why he flew his way to the nearest car and then proceeded to drive his way to Lebanon, Kansas. To Dean.
He continued on to tell him about their whole secret plan that they created once they realized something was wrong with Jack, how he was sucking the power out of everything and how they kept this plan a secret, even from Michael, who in the end tried to betray them, but it didn’t work. Jack told Cas about how they finally beat Chuck. And he told him how he took Chuck’s power, and how he now had it all, leaving Chuck alone and powerless, and how he left Sam and Dean, his family, to do the job right this time, to do it the way it should have been done in the first place, something that his dad’s had taught him.
A creaking sound finally broke him out of his thoughts, one that made him jump just a little. It was only Cas though, which normally wouldn’t have been such a big deal, except right now the only thing hiding his
Technically it wasn’t a lie. Coming back had been different this time than any other for a variety of reasons. He’d missed a lot. Like them finally defeating Chuck and bringing everyone back.
Well, hello there. I finally came back with another update and I’m sorry I take so long, but apparently, my brain just likes to self-sabotage when it comes to writing these days and also GISH… I’m gonna partly blame GISH because I can and because I love it and I’m happy now since I have a cute little robot that I made during Bobak’s little segment that I shall love forever. And maybe that robot made an appearance that we don’t talk about because I’ll cry again…
So much had happened in the past few days. Dean didn’t know how to process it all fully yet. Lucifer and Michael were dead, they beat Chuck, and now their kinda-sorta son, who was literally 3 years old, was the new God.
He knew that Jody was concerned about him and in all honesty, he had been expecting her to call ever since they gave the news to Claire about Cas’s resurrection, yet again.
breaking the silence.
He was reaching around lazily for the blankets when his hand landed on Cas, who he soon discovered was hiding under a mountain of blankets. Dean decided it would be best to snuggle up closer to Cas, the man was radiating body heat, and it’s no wonder why, seeing as he had stolen all the blankets from Dean during the night.
Dean was nervous, he had never been with a guy before, and he’d never even tried something like this with other girls or even alone. He didn’t know what to expect, but he trusts Cas, he knows he wouldn’t do anything to hurt him, and that he’d stop if he asked him to.
Dean obliged immediately, though there didn’t seem to be room for argument and even if there was, he didn’t have the strength to resist Cas right now. His shirt had quickly been thrown to the floor, which was followed soon after by Cas’ trenchcoat, coat jacket, tie, and shirt. There they both stood, still breathless, eyeing the other. They had both seen each other like this before, although not in this context, there was certainly no time for admiring the other's body in those moments.
Dean didn’t give Cas a chance to answer before he was speaking again.
so look I'm still alive!
Cas glanced back down to the filing cabinet nearby, gesturing towards it. “I had just been doing some reading on some spell the Men of Letter had been experimenting with. It sounded interesting…”
Dean was slightly embarrassed, his face flushing slightly, but at least the tears had stopped.
Once he was in the bathroom with the door closed, he turned on the light. He didn’t want it to wake Sam and he sure as hell didn’t want Cas to get a good glimpse at anything.
“Okay stay. Got it?”
“You can make this stop, Dean. It’s all in your head. You can make him disappear, just focus.”
“Yes, that’s very convenient. I think I found something as well. Back in 1973, there was a family who went camping in the area that went missing. The campsite was found by two hikers ripped to shreds, but that wasn’t all they found. There was a survivor.”
“Dean. is-” Cas’ words were ripped away from him, completely forgotten as Dean turned around, his face finally coming into view. His eyes were glassy and red, tear tracks on his cheeks. His bottom lip was quivering a little as he looked at Cas.
“Huh, I see, want any help?”
“Dean what are you-” he said, cutting himself off and looking around, realizing that they were both now standing in the bathroom. A puzzled expression made its way onto his face as he looked back at Dean.
“What do you mean?”
That’s not to say that he never actually talked to Cas during this time or spent any time with him because he did. Cas would occasionally join Dean in his
, and you don’t even think he could love you back,” John snickered. “You’re even worse off than I realized. No wonder that no one could ever love you, that you’re always alone. Who could ever love someone this damaged?”
Castiel made a decision then, one he hadn’t considered before due to him trying to respect Dean’s privacy, but something else took over when he heard those words. With two quick steps forward, Castiel touches Dean’s head and then everything around him changes.
“Oh, would you stop being so foolish? I swear the only people who don’t see it are you two because neither of you thinks you’re good enough for each other.”
“You know
Now let’s just move onto the chapter, I hope you enjoy it!
Mary gave him a stern look.
“Alright… Well, we’re all done out here. Ready to eat?”
It was almost midnight when they had finished watching a movie in the den and Dean was now pretty tired. He groaned as he got up from the recliner chair, stretching out his arms and back once he was fully up. Cas got up as well, collecting some of the empty bottles while Dean finished his stretching. Dean picked up the last few things once he was done and then they headed to the kitchen to dispose of the beer bottles and the popcorn bowl that was empty, except for a few kernels bumping around at the bottom.
and he hoped that there would be many more to come, spent just like this. With his angel.
“I’m going to ride you, but first, I’m going to stretch myself open while you watch,” he whispered.
Dean didn’t know what exactly he was thanking Castiel for, maybe it was for bringing him back to reality and waking him up, maybe it was for not judging him for not being completely okay, maybe it was for the way he still made him smile when that was the last thing he felt like doing or, maybe it was for the way he so fiercely protected Dean from the things he feared most, even when he never asked. He wasn’t quite sure, but maybe it was a little of everything, plus a bit more.
Roger reached a hand over to David then, placing it on his knee and brushing his fingers against it softly as a form of comfort. He knew it was still difficult for David to talk about this, even if he didn’t show it.
“Hey there, buddy,” he laughed as Miracle decided to take advantage of this newfound height difference and started to lick Dean’s face. Dean gave Miracle a few last pets on the head before standing up and looking back to see Cas watching the two of them with a surprised, yet warm smile on his face. Miracle seemed to notice then too that there was another person in the room, a new person at that.
After they’d settled in a bit - meaning that Dean had thrown his bag in the room - they decided to take a drive around town, getting a bit of a lay of the land and also to find somewhere to stop for food. It turns out there was a decent diner only a few blocks away from their motel, close enough that they could walk in the future if they wanted to.
“Dean,” the voice said.
“Even if I weren’t an angel I’d be able to see Dean is not physically healthy. We both know he’s never been the epitome of health, but now- Sam I know how bad it is or was…”
Dean was pretty sure he’d left it laying on his bed, so Cas shouldn’t have missed it, but then again, he wasn’t entirely sure.
Cas ushered him to bed, both him and Sam. He didn’t want to keep them up and he promised that he would still be there in the morning, he really had nowhere else he wanted or needed to be.
After the dream, Dean was different. Sam hadn’t seen him in a week, and he was growing even more concerned. The only way he knew Dean was still alive in his room, was when he heard those sobs, usually late at night, but they were happening more and more frequently.
“I don’t have to know whatever this is about to know that I care about you, Dean, and nothing could ever change that. And either way, am I really one to judge? After all I’ve done, all the mistakes I’ve made in my very long life, how could I possibly judge or think ill of you?”
Cas hesitantly toed off his shoes, leaving them on the floor and pulled back the covers. He climbed into Dean’s bed, sitting down, with his back resting against the headboard as he brought the covers back over his legs.
“Anyways, maybe we should just get to work.”
When Dean woke, he was greeted by a warmth against his face and along his bare torso.
Castiel also made sure that he took this chance to apologize to certain siblings that had been hurt by his actions in the past, whether it was directly or indirectly. He may have been doing what he was told at the time or doing what he believed right, but he knew that either way, many of his brothers and sisters had suffered because of that.
“I-” Cas started to say.
It was because he missed his angel, he needed him back, he needed him close. But alas, he knew, that this was as close as he could get. He couldn’t have more than this. Just this small comfort, that’s all he needed, it was enough to get him through the day, knowing that by the end of it when he slept, his angel would watch over him.
“Fu-ck...Cas, I’m gonna- fuck” Dean didn’t have a chance to finish speaking before he came undone. Dean couldn’t hold back, his vision went white as he came hard. He didn’t know the last time he had felt such pleasure, if ever.
Cas got up from the table, walking past Dean and offering him a grateful smile on his way past and to his room. Before he was fully out of earshot, Dean called out once again.
“Cas…” Dean grumbled out. Dean didn’t even have to open his eyes to know Cas was in the room. He could just tell by now, he could feel his presence and those eyes trained to the back of his head. “Tell Sam that if he doesn’t shut the hell up I’m going to shove his phone down his throat when we get back.”
“Uhh that’s… mistletoe…”
Mary wasn’t the only one surprised by this revelation it seemed, as Bobby had now fully let go of Cas, his body turning towards John, his eyes narrowing as he did so.
The photo was taken shortly after Cas cracked a joke about that movie Dean was talking about. He had felt a small bit of satisfaction at the reaction he had gotten from Dean. He clearly hadn’t expected Cas to actually quote the movie, and that’s what Cas had wanted. He wanted Dean to be caught off guard. Seeing that brought the smallest of smiles to his face, but he was still trying to make Dean think he didn’t like the hat, after all, he didn’t. He just liked seeing that look in Dean’s eyes, that little smile he got because Cas was still wearing it.
Dean nodded, already knowing what he was talking about. He got up off of Cas, and reached into a drawer and grabbed a bottle of lube out.
“Sam?”
“Uhh… not sure yet,” Dean said, still too distracted to actually remember what he had planned to make.
Dean pulled his hand away from Cas’ then, running it down his face.
“Okay good, are you ready?”
Once Cas was done slicking Dean up, which he sure took his damn time with, he shifted so he was right above the other man. Dean’s eyes had opened once more, wanting to look Cas in the eyes for this, he wanted to see him, he didn’t want to miss any part of this.
“Part of the reason why I didn’t fight him was because I knew I probably deserved it for whatever reason, but it wasn’t just that... It was also to protect Sam, better me than Sammy. I couldn’t let him hurt Sam, couldn’t let him do that to him too. Sam was my responsibility to protect. I had to protect him from that, I had to protect him from
After about 30 minutes of silence, Cas heard the rustling of the covers again.
Dean turned back to Cas, watching the angel nervously play with the sleeves of his shirt.
“Oh, good morning, Dean,” he spoke, his voice rough from not using it the past few hours.
Cas chuckles as he watches his family argue over their egg preferences.
“Umm does that mean that we should…? For traditions sake, of course.”
Cas leaned back then, his face coming back into Dean’s view and it was once again so close to Dean’s.
“Was there something else you wanted to discuss…?” he questioned.
“Look, I don’t wish to argue with you about this. I had my reasons. I was not going to just sit around and have you become subject to his abuse once again. You have had such a difficult life, I don’t want death to be the same. You deserve some peace. You deserve to be around those you love and who love you back. Not someone who wishes to shame you for who you are, who you love.”
“This is my voicemail. Make your voice… a mail.”
“See Sam, ketchup on eggs is awesome, even Cas agrees, a freaking angel.”
He pressed the answer button, still unsure about what was going to greet him on the other end of the line.
"We're here to hunt this thing
Dean knows that this is it. Cas is gone for good. He’s not coming back, there’s no way they could possibly bring him back. Chuck certainly wouldn’t do it and who even was left? There was no way for him to reach Cas, to save him.
He told him about what happened while him and Dean had gone to confront Billie, he told him what happened when Dean came back alone, and how he struggled to say anything about it. He told him about how everyone disappeared and how Jack tried to pray to Cas because he was so confused and how Chuck wouldn’t put everything back, even if Sam and Dean sacrificed themselves. How he thought his new “story” was more entertaining. He told him about when Dean found a dog and how they came to find Michael in a church and how Lucifer tricked Dean with a phone call once Chuck brought him back and how Lucifer tried to stab the rest of them in the back before Michael killed him.
He looks up again and reaches out a hand, hesitantly, not sure if this is actually happening, but when his hand reaches the others’ face he knows it is. It’s real. It’s Cas. Just then he pulls his angel in for a hug so tight that he’s sure Cas can’t breathe, but he doesn’t care and it seems that Cas doesn’t either.
Cas seemed to have noticed, however, and questioned Dean about it.
“Cas…” he whispered out.
“Jack, I-”
“Fuck. Just move already.”
“I did,” Cas confirmed.
He knows now that any actions he may have taken, any words he might’ve said, they all would’ve been for Dean’s benefit. It wouldn’t have been for Cas, or done with any consideration of the angel and how he might be feeling. He had just come back from the dead for God's sake. Springing some huge love confession on him then, just so Dean could get it out wouldn't have been fair to him. It would’ve been selfish.
“Good,” Cas said simply before wrapped one hand around Dean’s cock. It was soon followed by his tongue. He teased Dean for a bit, licking the underside of his dick and then the head. He watched as Dean squirmed beneath him, enjoying it. Then he stopped, causing Dean to open his eyes, just to meet Cas’ for a second before he took Dean fully into his mouth without warning.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry about the mess...guess I’m not a very good cook, among other things...”
Sometimes Sam would pray to him, just so he knew that if he ever decided to come home, that they would be there. They would always be there ready to welcome him back. Jack was family and they loved him.
But also, a message? Did he really just hear Cas right? He had no recollection of leaving a message at any point, so he must’ve been extremely drunk at the time. God only knows what he said on it.
Rusty’s cousin loved the stories of the Brothers Winchester just as much as they did, but this night changed everything for Rusty.
“Alright, sounds like a good idea, let’s get started.”
It took a few minutes, but eventually, they found everything, the panties really being the most difficult to find. Somehow they’d made their way onto the seat of one of the chairs that was half pushed into the table which had hidden it from view.
(See the end of the chapter for
He cleaned up Dean’s messes, he collected all the empty bottles that had begun to litter the bunker. He did a round of it almost daily, just to try and keep some order. He tried to bring Dean food, in hopes that maybe if it was just there that he’d eat it.
“That’s good. Talk about anything interesting?”
“Don’t worry, talk to you later.”
Heat shot straight to Dean’s face. “What? We’re not- he- he’s not,” he started to ramble out, finally letting go of Cas and taking one full step away from him.
“Is Elieen gonna come join us?”
“What?” was all he had to respond with, still not actually noticing where they were.
Dean rounded the doorway, his room coming into full view, and along with that view was the sight of the angel beside his bed, seeming to jump in surprise at the sound of Dean’s voice. What cut Dean off, however, wasn’t the sight of Castiel standing there. He was hoping to see him there, a smile forming on his face at the first sight. But then, after registering Castiel’s frozen, panicked expression, the smile disappeared, followed by an examination of the room, and more specifically, whatever the hell Castiel was holding because his phone charger was certainly not red.
He was breathing heavily as he heard the voice again.
He also wasn’t sure if he should tell Bobby everything about his feelings and all, talking about that once for today seemed like enough. It really only made him miss Dean even more and feel worse about the whole situation. In addition, Cas had the suspicion that if Mary knew about his feelings, then Bobby probably did as well, or at least, he might have an idea about it. He had, after all, spent more time with them on Earth than Mary had.
“Look, I’m sorry, man,” Dean started saying, rushing to undo any damage that had been done. He placed his right hand on Cas’ knee, trying to get his attention. “I didn’t- I didn’t mean to snap at you. I just don’t want to talk about it. Not right now.”
“Sounds great,” Dean replied, a small smile on his face.
“Sure.”
“What?”
“Cas, I’m bi.”
“You’re cute when you’re concerned.”
Dean telling him?
This was even better than Dean had imagined, everything about it was better. His brain couldn’t have imagined a scenario quite like this or the actions Cas would take leading up to it or just how it felt knowing it was Cas doing this to him.
“Dean,” Cas spoke. “Could you help me with something?”
Raising a hand, Dean cut him off. “The only correct answer is too damn long.”
“I’m here because of you Dean.”
Sam picked up his phone, making sure to check the time because he didn’t want Cas to have to suffer two days in a row for him waking Dean. Deciding it was probably late enough, he hit the call button and waited.
“Oh, guess it’s time to get up then.”
He and Cas sat in the library together until Dean was sure Sam and Jack were really out for the night, then, without a word, he looked at Cas and got up, grabbing his hand and pulling him up.
“I knew it!”
“And those dreams… You were so loud, Dean. Like you were begging me to do something.”
Cas sighs.
“Dude, stop.”
Cas could hear the pain and disbelief in his voice. Something inside of him broke then.
After a moment, Cas began to move again, lifting himself up onto his forearms, bringing his face in line with Dean’s so that he could look him in the eyes. He paused there, just looking at Dean before leaning down and placing another kiss to his lips. When he pulled back, there was a smirk on his face, one that had not been there before. Slowly, he sat up, so that he was kneeling above Dean’s thighs.
He broke himself from the thought, met with Mary’s half-concerned, half-curious gaze.
Thanks to everyone still following along! I’ll see you all in 2 weeks for another update!!
“Dammit, Cas! Where the hell are you! What’s going on? I can’t take this anymore. Get your feathery ass back here right. The hell. Now.”
Dean turns around then, walking back to his bed and sitting on the edge. When Cas doesn’t move from his spot a few feet away, Dean looks at him.
How did he even know what all that shit was about before Cas died? Even if he did return Dean’s feelings at one point, what if all those months away had changed how he felt about Dean? How did he know that he didn’t misinterpret anything? And even if he didn’t, what if it was all just in the heat of the moment, what if it was all just because Cas thought he would never see Dean again and maybe that made it seem like more than it was or maybe Cas even misinterpreted his own feelings. He couldn’t be sure, and hell if he was gonna ask Cas to explain it to him. That was not happening. Dean couldn’t do that, not yet.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He tried his best to
In no time it seemed that Cas had already managed to get 3 fingers inside himself, judging by his facial expressions and this one sound that Cas had made when he first started. He had only made it a few times since. It was a low, gasping whine of sorts and Dean couldn’t imagine how he would sound when he finally decided to take Dean inside of him. Dean wasn’t sure if he could handle that, feeling Cas around him, hearing the noises that he would make, seeing the pleasure spread across his face.
"I- I just wanted to make sure that you were safe," the other man mumbled, and now, it was Dean's time to blush. Without another word, he looked down at his burger before taking a bite, carefully though, since the sauce had now begun to drip all over the place.
Cas felt like he had been screaming for hours until he heard a noise.
Dean already knows that Jack told Sam about the deal, Dean had mentioned something about the Empty at one point, and the look Jack had on his face told Sam that he knew something about it. Sam wouldn’t let it go until Jack had spilled everything.
They stood in silence for a few moments after that, both of them going over everything in their heads, what Dean had just said out loud, and how Dean had been acting since all this happened.
“Oh, my bad, sorry about that.”
Castiel had a hard time processing all this information. He felt guilt, sadness, anger, and confusion, but he also felt proud. He was so proud of them all and so happy that they managed to free the world from the clutches of Chuck. He was so happy that they were free, but he was still confused, if Dean was finally free, then why was he still so broken? There were moments where he would have sacrificed everything just for his freedom, just to be free from Chuck, so now that he was free, why was he still in such a great amount of pain?
“You may be right, but they are your family, Jack.
“I swear to God if you say it one more time-”
Dean gasped when he noticed he had been caught after he finally gained control over his body again. He didn’t know what to do or what to say. His mind had gone completely blank, not a clue of what to do in a situation like this, so he fled. His panties still in full view of any wandering eyes and before Cas could even think to say anything, Dean was gone and out of sight, his rushed footsteps echoing down the hallway, followed by the slam of a door, presumably his own.
“How’s Dean doing, I mean is he okay…?”
“It’s not really something I need you to do… more like information. It’s about heaven.”
Cas looked curious, he had no idea what Dean was going to say.
Cas looked anywhere but at Dean. He refused. He was so nervous for this, letting Dean have a glimpse into his mind, his heart. It was terrifying. He wasn’t even sure if Dean would understand, if he would even begin to understand why he chose these songs specifically. He hoped he did, but he also hoped he didn’t.
Dean’s eyes focused behind Castiel’s head then, going wide as he did so.
“It’s okay Dean, it never happened, okay?”
Dean had fallen asleep, he wasn’t exactly sure how long he’d been out before a noise abruptly woke him. Blinking his eyes until they adjusted to the dark room, Dean looked around, noticing Cas wasn’t sitting where he once was. Searching further, he thought Cas had left the room altogether, that was until another noise caught his attention. It was coming from the bathroom. It almost sounded like a gasp, but he must have misheard it. He
Soon, the silence became too much for Dean, as well as the sticky coolness that was connecting the two of them.
He really shouldn’t have continued speaking because for some reason his brain and his mouth were not communicating very well today. He decided the best thing to do was to just shut up, at least until Cas had spoken, if he ever did.
Cas sighed. “Of course I’m curious, I just haven’t… I haven’t gotten the chance to do it yet.”
Finally, the phone stopped ringing. It was silent for a moment or two before Dean heard her voice. It was quiet and confused.
“You just watch the eggs, okay? Just nudge them around a little every few minutes. I’ll turn off the bacon so it doesn’t burn. You think you can handle that?”
He halted at the top of the steps, hearing a noise before his eyes had settled on it.
After a few minutes, they had everything they needed gathered on the counter and were ready to start with the eggs.
everything.
Here they were, rutting against one another like teenagers, and Dean was trying his best to keep himself together, he didn’t want this to be over so soon.
“A salad.”
“Alright. Bye, Claire.”
The sound of that low, deep voice saying his name at that exact moment was his undoing. A loud gasp escaped his lips as he kept working his hand, pumping out hot, white spurts of come onto his chest and his hand.
He didn’t really feel the need to hide things in his room, he didn’t really have much of anything worth hiding from anyone, but there was one thing that he felt was too personal to keep out in the open. He wasn’t sure how Dean would feel if he found it and he was sure that Sam would have some questions about it if he saw it.
Cas just let Dean guide him around the kitchen, not sure what else to do. He couldn’t seem to get anything right with this, he just kept messing up and he just wanted to be able to do this for Dean.
"We're still not doing it tonight.”
After that, he decided it’d probably be best if he left before either Sam or Cas caught him eavesdropping. That probably would not go over very well. Maybe a distraction would be a good idea, he was sure Miracle would be around somewhere and would be more than happy to go for a walk with him. He always seemed to cheer Dean up when he needed it and he would also give him a much-needed distraction right about now.
Just as that thought appeared in his head, all traces of Cas’ fingers were gone. He whined a little at the loss, moving his hips back to try and regain what he lost and then he realized what that meant, what would happen next. He couldn’t wait, he wanted him now.
In the photo, Cas was sitting in the Impala and wearing that absurd cowboy hat that Dean had made him wear for the case. At least, that’s the reason that Dean had given him for having to wear the hat. Even now, Cas still didn’t see the point in him having to wear it, yet he did back then, and maybe it had a little to do with the smile Dean got on his face when Cas let him put it on him.
Sam had missed out on his morning run today, so he planned to go on one in the evening when the sun was setting. It had been a beautiful day outside, perfect for a run. He was getting pretty beat, but he was so close to being done. Only a kilometre left.
He knew he should have called Dean or Sam, but he didn’t. He needed to see both of their faces, he couldn’t just do it over the phone this time because things were different now. He needed to see Dean’s face, he didn’t want him to lie over the phone and tell him everything was okay, he needed to see him and know that whatever he said wasn’t just to cover up his feelings or to spare Cas from whatever pain he had caused.
“Look who’s being a fucking tease now,” Dean groaned out, trying his best to sound somewhat in control but ultimately failing when Castiel grinded his hips down on the hunter, causing another moan to erupt from him. “Cas- just- do something, please,” Dean whined out, finally having enough.
“Well, you do keep scratching at them. I wanted to be sure you were aware of that.”
Cas sat down on a chair next to Dean as he waited for a reply.
Their eyes meet as Dean speaks and Cas’ eyes soften before Dean breaks their gaze and coughs awkwardly, ruining the moment.
“Hey,” Eileen said, placing a hand on Sam’s shoulder in greeting. “Who was that?” She asked, nodding to the phone that was now sitting on the table in front of him.
Cas tried to brush it off, but he couldn’t help the staring. He hadn’t noticed last night, he must’ve been too preoccupied or happy to be back to notice, but Dean was different. He
When Dean looked back up at Cas, he was surprised by the sight that met him. Cas looked just as nervous as Dean felt. All the confusion on his face from moments ago was now completely gone. There was also a trace of something that Dean couldn’t quite place.
“It doesn’t sound very pleasant though, wouldn’t you say?”
He rose slowly, his hand out as a sign to tell the dog to stay there, while he walked away slowly.
Cas knew there probably weren’t many there who would even want to help him, but he had to try, he had to try for Dean.
Cas was still gone when he emerged from the bathroom and still hadn’t returned when Sam and Dean had decided to call it a night.
It was a relatively uneventful day after breakfast, at least for a little while.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, why wouldn’t it be?”
“No, I need your help to get back to him, I need a lot of help, actually. We need to wake up the others, as many as we can. I’ve escaped from here once before because I annoyed the Empty, but I don’t think that’ll work again. We need more noise. If we can get enough noise, then I think it’ll have no choice but to let us out.”
Dean let out a shiver.
Dean gave him a smile and then wrapped Cas into a hug, careful not to drop the mixtape as he did so. He closed his eyes, nuzzling his head into Cas a little, breathing him in before pulling away.
“Alright,” Dean spoke suddenly. “I’m bored. Beer run?”
“Dean?” He heard Cas respond, but closer this time. “Where are you?”
“Kinda… I just- there’s just still so many things I don’t understand,” Dean let out a frustrated groan.
“I-I’ve never thanked you for that, Cas, but I should have because I’m so grateful. You can’t know how much that one thing meant to me. The freedom you gave me without even knowing it. It meant everything.”
Seeing Cas like this, riding his own fingers, it was tearing Dean apart. Dean hadn’t been touching himself while this was happening, Cas had said no touching, and Dean was pretty sure that applied to both Cas and himself. Dean couldn’t take it any longer, he needed to feel him right now.
(See the end of the chapter for
They finished their meal in relative peace after that, Sam now knowing not to mention anything about Dean’s wellbeing while Cas was dead. They kept the conversation light and easy, catching Cas up on some of the things he missed in the past few months that he was away.
“Okay, let me just…” Dean reached into his pocket, struggling a little from his sitting position to grab his phone out. Once he had it, he turned it on, seeing how it was already in the contacts app. He scrolled down to Claire’s name before pressing the call button, pressing the phone against his ear.
Dean got tired of waiting, anger started to boil in his veins, he couldn’t believe Cas had just left him there. AGAIN, without any explanation.
Dean still, despite Sam’s efforts, spends a lot of time sleeping or at least trying to sleep. It’s hard some nights when his mind won’t shut off. A lot of the time he’ll just drink until he passes out or until he feels numb inside. He spends the majority of his time drinking now, it doesn’t matter what time it is. He just needs to lessen the pain.
Needless to say, this was extremely difficult for Dean, almost impossible.
Cas paused for a second, trying to collect his thoughts and calm down a little bit.
“Cas, I-”
Dean didn’t know what he would do if his angel was taken away again, he didn’t have time to think about it. In a matter of seconds, which frankly took too damn long because it felt like hours to Dean, he was taking the steps up to the bunker’s door, two at a time.
“You weren’t gone long.”
“Talk to me, Dean. Tell me what you want.”
By the time he reached the bunker, he was dead and he really needed a shower. He couldn’t wait to wash off, but first, he needed to get some water.
“He doesn’t-” Cas started to oppose before Sam cut him off.
“Where?” he questioned right back,
“Yes, Dean… it’s all the TV”s fault that you have an unhealthy obsession,” Cas said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
He spends his time trying to find ways to drown out the noise in his head and lessen the pain.
Dean didn’t know what he was saying, the words were just coming out before he even had a chance to think about what he was saying. Wait, what was he saying? He didn’t want to kiss Cas, he didn’t feel that way about him. No, Cas is just a friend.
“You shouldn’t feed dogs at the table, Dean. It just teaches them to beg while we eat.”
What he saw next… he almost couldn’t believe it. There, on the ground was Dean. Just laying there, curling in around himself, bloodied and bruised.
He was so close and then there was a light knock on the bathroom door, a voice coming through, right as he was on the edge.
"So, two people went missing, then a group of campers, right? Any thoughts?" Dean watched as Cas tilted his head to the side and did that little eye squint, which was not adorable at all.
“Yeah, sure, got a specific one in mind?” Dean asked him, not really thinking about it.
He missed Cas’ hugs, the warmth he felt having his body pressed against his, arms holding him tight. The last time he got to feel this warmth was in purgatory, that was the last time he had gotten to hold his angel. They had held each other so tightly then, both thinking they might not see the other again. With the way things were left between them, the thought of not being about to make things right was unbearable.
That was the only thing he could do. It was his way of telling him not to go, telling him to stay. After all the times Dean let him walk out the door and didn’t stop him, he needed to say it this time because if he didn’t, he feared he would never be able to say it again. He’d have to hold onto that again, not telling him to stay, that he wanted,
Dean had to pause. He needed to take another breath or else he wouldn’t get through what he was trying to say.
“Dean, Meg is a demon, and one could argue that demons are genderless. The only reason we perceive Meg as a woman is because of the people she chose to possess. She could have chosen a man and what would you have assumed then?”
“No but’s Sam, you need to try harder, make him understand. He needs to know that this is killing Dean. I’m worried, not just about him, but about you too.”
“Uhh Cas? What’s with all the uh fruit?”
Dean just stuttered “I- I knew that… I was just, uh- waiting for you, don’t wanna get lost out here...:”
“You don’t know that, you can’t know that. You weren’t there. You didn’t see-”
This scenario, however, never had occurred, at least hadn’t occurred recently, because Dean was either too fucked up and passed out from spending the day drinking or he was fucked up from crying and trying to not let the sound escape his body-which he was not always very successful at.
Sam just laughed at that. “He just threw something at you, didn’t he?” Cas could just about hear the smirk on his face.
She looked up at Cas then, as she held her stuffed cat in her arms tightly and gave him a smile and then all of a sudden she had thrown her arms around him. The gesture was very unexpected and Cas almost lost his balance, but after a moment, he settled and returned the warm hug.
Dean wasn’t stupid, he knew what it was that hardness was that was pressed up against him, and he let out a gasp when he felt it shift and press up against his own hardening member.
He eyed Cas for a few more seconds, but then just shrugged.
It was quiet for a few more moments before Dean spoke again.
Sam went off easier than Dean, leaving them both alone for the first time since he arrived. Attempting to fight off the awkwardness that he feared would come, Castiel stood up and physically pulled Dean off his chair in order to get him to head to bed. He even walked with Dean, just to make sure he was really going to his room. That’s what he told himself at least. He just told himself he was following Dean to make sure he would get some sleep. He tried to ignore the feeling inside of him that didn’t want to leave Dean simply because he didn’t want to be apart from him, not just yet. It didn’t work very well though. This inner voice, this feeling wouldn’t go away, not until he acknowledged it. That’s why he found himself speaking these next words to Dean.
The motel wasn’t as crappy as most of the ones he was used to. It was actually quite nice and cozy. The inside of the room was clean, the walls made of wood and the bedspread a red and black checkered plaid pattern.
“What do you mean, ‘people like you’?”
him, his chest laying on a table as his own hands were grasping onto his hips, able to feel the textured material beneath his fingers as Dean ground back against his own clothed erection. At that thought, a loud moan managed to slip past Castiel’s lips, one that he had failed to control.
He waited patiently until he saw the slow movements of the angel. Their true form, the light of it floating around in front of his eyes. It was breathtaking. This first angel, they glowed, it was so bright. He watched as the new angel familiarized themself with this form, until all at once they merged into a new form, one looking more human, like a vessel. It blinked at him, it’s brows furrowed.
“So what? You’re just going to give up?”
“Dean, I know you’re awake. You can stop pretending.”
“It’s happening again, isn’t it?”
He was praying to him again. It was different though, he sounded different than normal, he
Once Castiel reached the bottom of the stairs, Sam engulfed him in a hug. It was different from the one he had gotten from Dean, but it was still welcomed. He did miss Sam too, just in a different way.
His mouth already watering, he picked up his burger, but right as he opened his mouth to take a bite, Cas spoke again.
Later that night, they scoped out the place. It was a small house in a quiet neighbourhood. It was empty when they got there. It looked like no one had been there for a few days. Somehow they must have caught wind of them being there, maybe Tommy heard them talking at the restaurant. They weren’t too sure, so they searched the house, hoping to find any clues as to where they might have gone, but they had no luck.
Cas wasted no time after that, slowly pushing himself inside Dean, pausing once the tip was in just to give Dean time to adjust, this was, afterall, much bigger than just a few fingers could prepare him for.
Dean woke up the next morning feeling the same as he had every other morning for the past few months, feeling empty, feeling lost, feeling broken. That was until he felt a warmth held tightly in his hand and tucked against his chest. His eyes fluttered open, feeling confused, but assuming he had grabbed hold of Miracle in his sleep, it wouldn’t have been the first time he had crawled up beside Dean as he slept.
“It’s okay. I’m not mad, I just-” He paused, removing his hand from Cas’ chin, dropping it down to the bed, only about an inch away from where one of his thighs was resting. “I just was a bit confused. Why did you just leave like that, Cas?”
Dean trembled at the thought, inhaling sharply, as Cas’ lips brushed against his ear as he spoke.
When they were ready, all aware that they couldn’t really know for sure what would happen, they all called out together, all at once. They yelled and screamed and shrieked until their throats were hoarse, and even then they kept on going, they weren’t sure how long it would take, as this plan wasn’t very specific, so they had decided on different groups taking breaks at different times.
Dean shook his head, trying to make the voice shut up, but he couldn’t ignore it. Taking a breath, he decided to break the silence.
Slowly, Castiel’s hands moved further and further down Dean’s body, until they were cupping his ass and then, with what seemed like no effort at all, Cas was picking Dean up. Dean’s legs wrapped around Castiel’s hips almost immediately, searching for something to latch onto and god, he hadn’t thought about the implications of doing such a thing because that contact had them both moaning into the other’s mouth at the pressure.
He was just about to pick it up when another something caught his eye. A flash of red fabric caught his attention, and a sense of familiarity washed over him. Almost instantly, Cas realized what he was looking at. It was that pair of red lace panties that Cas had seen Dean wearing about a week ago and now he was getting a much better view of them.
“How did you-” he cut himself off. “Crowley, I assume…”
“Your money, huh?” Eileen smirked, a glint of something in her eyes. “Twenty bucks that Dean will do it first.”
“I’m not going away until you open the door.”
He used to be just fine doing things like this, but if he was being honest, he wasn’t as young as he used to be and these past few months of sitting around the bunker had gotten him pretty out of shape.
“Okay.”
Dean gasped when he felt himself spring free from the confines of his pants, cock bouncing against his chest.
“Umm, Dean, how do I- what am I supposed to do with this?”
now, he’s pretending that nothings wrong and has been magically fixed but it’s not. He- okay I know what happened before you were taken, he actually managed to talk to me one day, so I get it, okay? But he’s still pretending and it’s not okay,
“Cas, it’s okay. I don’t mind, not at all actually. We can still surprise Sammy and Jack, okay?”
Cas started to make his way back over to the bed, while Dean continued to watch, he didn’t want to forget any moment of this, any part of that body. Cas stopped briefly and reached into a drawer on his way to Dean. When he found his way back to the bed, he knelt down beside the hunter, slowly tugging his sweatpants down, along with his boxers. Out popped Dean’s dick, hitting his stomach, finally releasing him from the trapped heat of his pants.
Dean opened the door even wider, allowing space for Cas to come in as well.
“Maybe, hell could be taken off the table. The eternal suffering never becoming an option. Being God does have its perks, after all. Maybe your soul could be sent somewhere else, somewhere better, but if heaven falls... then there’s really no point, is there? So, if you don’t help me create more angels, then, either way, you will never be at rest. Do you really want that? To spend eternity in pain?”
“So, we can talk about it later then?” There was a note of hope in his voice. Dean knew that if he didn’t agree then Cas would only bring it up again later, so he had no choice but to agree. At least this way Cas would wait, at least a little while, for Dean to bring it up on his own when he was ready. Or at least if he brought it up again, it would most likely be when they were alone.
That’s how Sam was when Eileen walked into the room, just smiling down at his phone, unaware of what was happening around him. Once she came into view, Sam sat up a bit straighter, his smile only brightening at the sight of her. God, he was so thankful they were able to get her back. Losing her… he really wasn’t sure how long he would’ve lasted like that. He knew that she would have kicked his ass if he sat around moping forever, but honestly, he couldn’t imagine how to even begin to move past that. But that was something he tried not to think about. His only focus was on finding a way to get her back, to get everyone back, everyone they ever loved. Their family.
Dean got up, pulling out his cassette player, putting this one inside and pressing the play button. Then he walked back over to Cas, sitting next to him once more. They sat there in silence while the music started playing.
“Yeah, everything's uh, pretty great actually,” Dean spoke, a warm smile creeping onto his face as he glanced over at Cas who was standing only about two feet away.
“Wha- no why would I-” Dean was surprised, and it must have shown on his face because of what Sam said next.
Dean should have said it back. Even in the past, even when he could convince himself it was because he was family, but he never did. He never once told Cas that he was loved. He could never get the words out, because if he did, he was scared of what they might mean, what he would have to admit they meant. He was scared that someone else might see what he was feeling and he was scared that he would be judged or rejected. Once he said those words, there would be no taking them back, they would be out there and there would be no denying it. But now all he feels is regret over this decision.
At that, Dean couldn’t hold back his very audible frustrated sigh. “Really? After all that and you don’t even- okay you know what? Whatever, just- I have one in my pocket, just grab that.”
Rowena let out a small chuckle as she handed John off to another demon. “Take him to Crowley.”
“Cas…” Dean sighed. “What’re you doing, man?”
Cas paused instantly at the sound of Dean’s voice but took a moment to actually turn around to face him.
Seeing Cas like this, hearing Cas like this, it was too much for Dean. He couldn’t hold on any longer.
“Okay, I’m not saying that I need your help, but if I were to... require something, what would you need me for? You’re the new “all-powerful” God now. What could you possibly need me to do for you?”
Cas was overcome with emotion then; he could feel the tears pooling in his eyes and his heart was pounding in his chest. This was something far more than he deserved, how could he even begin to repay Jack for this?
While Dean was showering Cas decided he would go to his room for a bit. He hadn’t been in there yet since he got back and now seemed like a good time for it.
“Alright, come here.”
“No, no, everything is fine, or at least it will be soon,” Cas said as she ushered him into the house.
It had been a long day, Dean had been up late the night before setting up the room for Jack’s new bunny and then he had woken up earlier than normal that morning. To top it off, he spent a lot of time cleaning that day, so he was getting pretty tired when it came to the third movie.
He offered the girl a small smile as he held it out. “He’s been through quite a journey to get to you.”
Hastily trying to distract them both with a subject change, he walked further into the room, careful this time to be certain that no chairs were blocking his path. “So, what’re you both working on in here?”
“Yeah, I’m ready,” Dean responded as Cas gently pushed him down onto his back again.
“Good boy.”
Dean tried his best to be cautious when Cas was around, not wanting to say the wrong thing, or do the wrong thing, or literally do anything. Maybe he was avoiding him a little.
Mary stepped forward then, grabbing his shirt in her left hand and right hooking him. She didn’t stop with just one hit this time though. She kept going and when John tried to fight back Bobby and Castiel stepped in, holding him back and even delivering a few blows of their own.
but you also abused him? You broke him, you beat him down, for what? Because you were afraid that he might be happy? That maybe he might love someone who you don’t approve of, someone, who I might add, actually loves him back? And then you abused him? A child.”
It was okay though, they never really celebrated Christmas like this growing up. It was usually just him and Sam, exchanging a small gift or two, and then ordering a pizza for dinner while they watched whatever Christmas movie was playing on the TV.
different. Jack wasn’t quite sure why, so he just stood there, listening to Sam, hearing every word of his prayer.
“Hmmm?”
He bounded over to Cas, sniffing him until he was satisfied and then proceeded to nuzzle at Cas’ hand until he started to pet him.
Well fuck. He had
Then, the silence was interrupted as the barn door opened. Rusty just assumed the clowns had returned, but when they actually saw who it was, oh lord have mercy on Rusty. It was the Winchesters, the famous brothers. Rusty had heard about them their whole life. Rusty was in awe. First, they saw Sam. He was just like they pictured, just as tall as they imagined. His hair too, oh gosh, how Rusty would like to touch it, to caress it and feel the soft locks that fluttered in the breeze.
They talked for a few minutes, Sam asking how Cas was and how the case was going. Dean explained that they were pretty sure it was a wendigo and that they were heading just about to head out to the woods. It really did sound like they were fine, that they could handle it, yet Sam still wasn’t able to hold himself from making sure.
“Cas, we can’t just up and buy a guinea pig.”
Sam just kept smiling after the call ended. He felt a bit better hearing it from Dean, and actually hearing that he meant it when he said they were both fine and that they didn’t need any help.
Dean panicked, pulling away from Cas immediately and avoiding eye contact with the angel. He looked around, but he didn’t see Sam, he assumed he must’ve yelled from the hallway or maybe the den.
A loud knock on the door startled them both. They broke away quickly, but not before Sam had barged in, seeing the state of the two of them. His mouth was hanging open, the words he was about to speak, forgotten.
I hope everyone is as happy as I am to finally have these two back together again and also that I wasn't the only one crying during the little Jack & Cas goodbye (I really love dad Cas so I couldn't resist and I need to say my goodbye to Jack properly)
“He’s not some creature. He’s my best friend. Don’t say tha-”
He leaned his head down and placed a kiss on the top of Dean’s head.
“It’s nothing, Cas!” He snapped out a little too harshly. Immediately, regret flashed across his face, not meaning to snap at Cas, but he just didn’t want to talk about it, he didn’t want Cas to feel bad or worry about how bad off he had been without him.
Rusty sat there alone in the barn, still covered in blood and waited. Waiting for what, they weren’t sure, but waiting was all that Rusty could do.
They managed to find a small motel in a nearby town in Ontonagon. It was small and pretty rustic looking.
“Excuse me?” Dean asked, offended. “Obsession? I am not obsessed. No. Teen girls with Tumblr accounts are obsessed. I am a grown-ass man.”
Dean had been rambling so it took Cas a few moments to catch up and when he did, a few things caught his attention.
Dean would also never admit it, but he hadn’t slept as well as he had that night in ages. He also didn’t want to admit why that was the case, even if he knew deep down. Or maybe it wasn’t even deep down because in all honesty, it was really quite obvious. There was only one thing different about that night than any other night. It was Cas. Even before he fell asleep he could feel the heat radiating off the angel, he could feel his presence. He really shouldn’t try to deny it, but he couldn’t help it. It was all just so different. Things were changing with respect to how he thought about the angel and it was terrifying and confusing, but also exciting at the same time.
When he was done, he turned off the water and stepped out onto the bathmat, feeling the cool air attack his still wet skin. Hurriedly, he reached for the towel sitting nearby and quickly dried himself before wrapping it loosely around his waist.
A look of understanding washed over Cas’ face as he got what Dean had meant.
Sitting back up on his chair, Dean turned the book over, finally noticing what he had been drawing, much to Castiel’s horror.
Cas saw past all of Dean's flaws and all of his scars. When he looked at Dean, he didn’t see a broken man, the broken man that Dean saw when looking in the mirror. Castiel saw a man full of love, driven by love. He saw a man that fought for his family, his friends, the whole world because of how deeply he loved, because of how selfless he was.
“Are you sure you guys don’t need any help? I mean it’s not that far of a dri-”
After a few moments, a low groan interrupted his examination of Dean’s injuries, which was then followed by the hazy blinking of Dean’s eyes as he attempted to take in his surroundings.
“Well, I was able to wake up from that, because of Dean. I think he woke me up, unintentionally of course. All I know is that I could hear him calling my name, over and over again. He sounded as if he was in pain, pain that I caused and I- I knew I needed to help him.”
He breathed in one more deep breath before placing his hand on the door handle and flicking off the light switch, letting his eyes try to adjust to the newfound darkness before opening the door with a loud creak. There was a faint bit of light making its way into the room from the open blinds, falling almost perfectly on Cas’ face. Dean could see that he was sitting in the chair now, but his gaze was glued to the door, watching as Dean emerged from the bathroom.
“I don’t-“
“Thanks for staying…” he murmured as he felt the darkness consume him and carry him off to sleep, feeling more at peace than he had in a long time.
Cas just ignored him, grabbing his collar tightly and hauling him up and then in a blink of an eye, they weren’t in heaven anymore.
,” Dean replied, humour in his voice before saying a quick goodbye and hanging up.
Cas took another deep breath and he called out once again.
“Come on, Cas. What the hell’s gotten into you?”
Jack dropped it, still looking a bit confused, but this wasn’t something that he was willing to fight Cas on.
Cas shifted on the bed, bringing his right leg up onto it, keeping his knee bent as he scooted ever so slightly closer to Dean, his leg now brushing against Dean.
“Maybe we could start with the berries and grapes? I don’t think bananas like to sit out for too long.”
“Yea- Yes. Everything is fine.” He said, coughing slightly, still shifting in the chair and now adjusting the leg of his pants..
Dean grabbed his plate with the burger on it, as well as two beers before heading towards the den, ready to finally sit down and relax for a bit.
“Dean?”
He cleared his throat before speaking. "Alright, but I'm gonna give you some clothes later. I’ll take care of yours, don't worry."
out? God, he was never going to be too lazy to do that again. But that was an easy solution for the future, he still had to deal with the present to get there, or rather survive it.
“Maybe because you couldn’t get your head out of your ass and admit how much you wanted this.”
He and Jack had been trying to work out a few more things with the residents. Details, about who would go where and which people would be near them. They could obviously change where they went, but they decided it was best to have those who were close on earth and alive during the same time near one another. It would be nice for them and be a comfort to them with all these changes that were now happening.
A noise caught his attention then, it was the sound of quiet sniffles, echoing through the otherwise silent room. They were coming from the bed, from Dean. Through the darkness, he could see Dean’s body laying on the bed, shaking slightly.
“Dean?”
“Help? From who?”
“You know he was possessed once, it took me some time to realize it, but I did. You wanna know why I knew it wasn’t him? Because he never would have been proud of me. He never would have- He would have yelled at me, he would have been furious, all because I wasted a bullet when we were trying to kill that demon. There wouldn’t have been any understanding there or an ‘it’s okay, you boys tried’. Nope, not from him.”
“Are you alright?” Castiel asked, his voice laced with genuine concern.
“Sam?” he called out, but he got no response. Again, he tried. “Cas? Hello? Guys what’s going on?”
“Am I though?”
“Just- stay where I can see you.”
The drive out was really quite beautiful, even though it was only mid-March and there wasn’t much new plant growth yet. Still, it was nice to be away from the city, the smell of the cleaner air out here was worth every second of it.
“You really think that has stopped any of us in the past?” He shot back. He had a fair point. When has the inconvenience of death ever truly been the end for a Winchester or those around them? They’d come back more than enough times to know that death wasn’t the end, that there was a possibility that something more could come of it, that it may not be forever.
“Well… since you asked so nicely.”
“I thought you were going back to sleep.”
Privacy, to say the least, wasn’t the easiest thing to come by for Dean and Cas. This is why Dean tried looking for a cabin that they could rent for a week or two, something away, where it could just be the two of them, with no disturbances.
He had been so busy. At first, he had wanted to focus on heaven, to try and help there. Heaven needed him the most at the moment. It was dying and he needed to fix it. He knew that his presence in heaven was helping a lot, it was keeping things up and running, but he couldn’t stay there forever, so he needed to come up with a solution, and to him, there was really only one. They needed more angels. He knew it wouldn’t be easy, he knew it would take so much time and energy to do it right, to do it well. It couldn’t be like the last time when he tried angelically converting those human souls while he was being manipulated by Duma. It wasn’t a good way, it was wrong. Not all humans survived the process and it wasn’t fair to them to do this. No, he needed to start from scratch, just like Chuck had done in the beginning.
Cas didn’t have to fill Bobby in very much about their earlier conversation, not after what had happened, plus, Bobby had known John after Mary’s death. He was able to see parts of him, the parts that changed and became more prominent after she was gone.
“Woah, thanks for the support, man.”
Dean cut Cas off, grabbing the hand that was still resting on his knee.
He froze what he was doing, however, when he heard Dean let out a chuckle. He spun around immediately, startled by Dean’s presence.
Dean just stared at Cas, his mouth slightly ajar. He wasn’t sure what to say after something like that. Somehow Cas always seemed to surprise him, without even trying. And somehow he had actually improved his people skills…
His thoughts were interrupted, however, when he realized something.
Dean was only met with silence. Cas was probably just pissed.
Sometimes he would be the one staring first though. He’d be doing something and then glance up at Cas’ face, maybe not even meaning to do so, and then he’d be stuck, he wouldn’t be able to look away. He’d go over every detail of his face. The little crinkles by his eyes when he’d smile or laugh, usually at something that either he or Sam had done, the little furrow of his brow when he didn’t understand something, the way his eyes would shimmer in just the right lighting, making the blue hue become even more intense. Sometimes he’d even catch the little dart of his tongue to wet his lips and his eyes would instantly be drawn to it, catching every movement, which would sometimes be followed by a little lip-bite.
He had just been sitting outside on a bench, not doing much of anything. He startled at the sudden noise of Mary’s voice, thinking that she was here to bring him back home, but he couldn't have been more wrong. John became angry once again. He didn’t understand how Mary and Bobby both had turned against him so fast.
Chuckling a little at that, Dean brought the phone close to his ear again, “You catch that, Jody?”
When Dean noticed Cas was still following close behind him, he turned around quickly, causing Cas to crash into him, not expecting him to stop walking so suddenly.
It was then that Cas realized that Dean must’ve hurt his ankle earlier because it was now very visibly swollen and bruised.
“Ahh I see, yeah pineapples are a bitch to cut up,” Dean paused for a second, assessing the situation and thinking about all the food Cas had planned to prepare. “Well how about we prepare most of the fruit first, before we move onto the cooking?”
Maybe some bleach would help...
“Yeah, I… I think I did.”
It was Jack, slowly emerging from his room, glancing at Sam with soft eyes as he noticed him standing in the doorway. He walked closer.
Rusty couldn’t believe it. What was happening? This had to have been a dream. Rusty didn’t know what to do, they couldn’t move, they couldn’t look away, because Rusty was actually able to move.
“You know what, Cas? Fuck you. You just- You were the one who said all that shit and then fucking left. How the hell did you think I was going to feel after that, huh?” Dean couldn’t keep it in anymore. He was so angry with Cas, but he also couldn’t wait any longer to finally have Cas to himself.
“Dean…Use your words..” Cas warned.
“Dean, you’re not getting any younger and neither of us want you dying from a heart attack. Just eat the salad, or maybe next time that’s all I’ll get you.”
Was it really that obvious all this time? He wouldn’t say it out loud, but he had been slightly nervous about what Sam would think about all of this. He also didn’t think Sam would be so quick to process this, but here he was, his younger brother was getting it all. He understood, and he knew this whole time.
“Hey, Cas,” he almost whispered, feeling almost nervous about breaking the silence.
“Just leave it, Sam.”
Dean gave his hand one quick squeeze before dropping it, instantly missing the touch, but also knowing they had other things they needed to be doing now that he could walk by himself.
When Jack found him, he was certainly not doing well. He was living on the streets, somewhere in Delaware, a bottle in hand, drinking the rest of his life away.
“You don’t need his approval. You don’t need to try to please him anymore. He isn’t your family. Family cares about you, they support you, they don’t put you down or hurt you for who you are.”
Now it was Dean’s turn to blush a little, but he covered it up by leaning up towards the angel and pulling him down, only to flip them over the second Cas was unstable.
After the first day, Dean had started to notice a few small changes in Cas. He and Dean had been spending a lot of time together recently while he had been staying with them and it had been nice, but now he was noticing just how close they had really been now that they were out of the bunker. It was almost as if Cas was his shadow, not letting Dean out of his sight or more than a few feet away at most times. It was a little strange and Dean couldn’t seem to get any space from him or any time alone.
“What uh… what’s missing.”
“Alright then,” with that, Dean pushed back the covers, and got out of bed, walking over towards his dresser to find some more clothes to throw on.
“Yeah, I-I’m just peachy. Nothing wrong here,” he said as he almost lost his grip on another plate.
He turned around and started walking over to the chair. Dean took this chance of not being under his watchful eye to hop out of bed and scurry into the bathroom before Cas could turn around and notice a certain problem in his boxers.
“It’s fractured,” Cas said after a moment, his hand hovering above it. “Hold still.”
“I’ll stay as long as you’ll have me. I’ve told you this before.”
“So...You’re not mad?”
It was Dean’s turn to kiss and tease the angel, now. Dean made quick work of it, however, as he was growing impatient. Soon his fingers were undoing his belt and then pulling down his pants, along with his boxers, until Cas was naked.
“Yup, 100 percent sure.”
“Oh.”
“Morning. Looks like you slept well.” Sam smirked, shifting his gaze to Cas and then back to Dean.
Dean nodded in agreement, and off Jack and Sam went.
The cave wasn’t really much of a cave, to be honest. It was more like a series of interconnected tunnels with a few larger cave-like areas - like the area Dean had been in. It didn’t take them long to find the other groups of people though. They were scattered about in two other areas that were near each other. They didn’t find everyone, they hadn’t expected to find everyone even if they never said it aloud, but they found more people than they thought.
Cas nodded silently and collected the items Dean had told him to get. He may not have been good at cooking, but he could at least find these things in the kitchen.
“Do you think you could… I don’t know… maybe sit a little closer?”
“Mary, wait-”
"So, the case?"
Dean stopped for a moment, still half resting on Cas, when a thought occurred to him “Where are Sam and Jack?”
John just ignored him, cutting him off.
“Lucifer? He’s back? Where is he?”
Dean didn’t know what to say, and with that, the conversation seemed to be over.
“I, uh, I don’t have a knife on me,” Cas admitted, but Dean could tell he was holding back a smirk.
Cas was worried though. He knew John was in heaven, he knew how Dean would feel about this when he came here. He knew Jack might not understand it all, he probably wouldn’t, after all, Dean had never really talked to him about it and neither had Sam. He didn’t know much about John other than he was their father and that he wasn’t necessarily the greatest dad ever.
“Dean… you know you can talk to me, right?”
to get taken, it just happened okay? I just- I thought I heard you talking to me so I like- followed it and then I guess it wasn’t actually you…”
Dean reached into his jacket pocket, pulling out a badge and showing it to Roger.
A buzz startled Dean then. It was his phone. He pulled it out and turned it on, clicking on his messages. There was a new message from Sam.
“What, I-”
“Please don’t leave me,” Dean whispered quietly. He was so quiet that Cas had almost missed what he said.
Dean sucked in a breath, trying to keep himself from squirming beneath the angel or from pressing his hips further up in an effort to increase the pressure because fuck, Cas was being super freaking light with his touches and it was driving him crazy.
“Yeah, I dunno… maybe?” It came out as more of a question than he meant it to.
Dean sighed,
On the fourth day at the cabin, Dean had woken up earlier than normal, he checked the clock, 6:04 am. He was a little chilly in the bed, he must’ve shoved the blankets away at some point during the night because now his body was bare.
And then it wasn’t enough, Cas’ legs finally gave out and he was collapsing to the ground, his back sliding down the wall until his ass hit the ground, his legs sprawling out before him, giving Dean an even better view, if that were even possible, which he hadn’t believed before. With that fall, also came an inexplicably loud gasp, one that seemed to even shock Cas himself, for making and then, Cas was coming. Sitting on the floor, spread out and absolutely wrecked from the pleasure, Cas was coming all over his chest and his hand and Dean only wished that he had played some part in that fucked out look that Cas had painted on his face.
Cas was speechless. He hadn’t even imagined that one day he’d be able to… that one day he’d be able to fly again. Oh, how he missed it, feeling the wind rush past his feathers and the rest of his being, the true freedom that he had felt, the weightlessness. He hadn’t really appreciated it though until it was gone, until he had no chance of feeling that again.
“What is it, Dean?”
“Yeah, let’s go.”
“Why’re you up now anyways? You should be sleeping,” Sam said, breaking their silence.
Dean’s love of old Western movies was no secret. That whole case Dean was so excited, so full of joy, he was like a kid on Christmas morning, and Cas found it endearing.
“I did actually happen to consider how Mary may feel about the whole thing, and others as well. So, don’t assume that I did it without thinking because I did a hell of a lot of thinking when it came to this and that was even before I discussed it with Mary and Bobby.”
“You didn’t… Claire didn’t mention anything about me… did she?”
He curled into it, wanting to be consumed by it and then heard a small chuckle from very close by. He paused, opening his eyes and blinking away the sleep from his eyes.
“That’s alright, we understand,” Cas responded sympathetically, focusing on the woman.
“Why did…” Dean trailed off, building up the courage to ask the question he wanted the answer to the most. “Why were so many of them of me…?”
He stood there and watched as Jack took a few steps away from him, his eyes staying focused on Castiel.
He reasoned that it really probably was either Sam or Dean who had found them and moved them, thinking that Dean was the more likely culprit since he was normally nosier than Sam, but he still wasn’t sure why he would’ve moved them or why he would’ve even been in his room in the first place. He decided that maybe he should just ask Dean about it and see if he knew anything about it.
“Me?”
He pulled Akobel aside when he first woke up, he needed to explain what happened and why it happened. Castiel, like the others, had been fooled by Ishim, he had deceived them and used his rank to fabricate a story, which they all blindly believed. This death was one that Castiel felt a great deal of guilt over. It had caused several deaths, one most notably, of an innocent child, as well as the deaths of Benjamin, Mirabel and the other members of the garrison. It also contributed to the loss of a woman's soul, Lily Sunder, the woman whose life was destroyed and who became consumed by revenge. Castiel also tried to reassure him that in the end, Ishim hadn’t gotten away with it, it may have taken years, but eventually, he got what he deserved.
“Wait- he’s what?”
He hoped that after all these years that he would still want to watch over him. He knows that in the beginning, he found it odd. It startled him on many occasions, but over time he grew to accept it, to look forward to it even. It was comforting for him to know that Cas was there, just watching over him, to make sure he was alright. It made him feel safe and comforted.
“Dean. I’m not falling for your tricks. I told Sam I’d stay here and that is exactly what I intend to do.”
It was messy and rough, the anticipation and desperation that both had been feeling the past few weeks coming out in that one kiss.
I hope everyone is staying safe right now and Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
“Dean… it’s okay…” Cas said as he removed his fingers and leaned down, putting his forehead against Dean’s, and kissing him softly.
Without saying a word, Dean nodded his head, because he didn’t know what would come out if he did speak, he wasn’t sure if he was capable of it at the moment.
