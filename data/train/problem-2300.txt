“I… Um, down. Rub down.” He paused and then grunted awkwardly. “No, you idiot.
“That’s how you got in,” John mused quietly. He sat down in his chair and kept his eyes on the window. The faun stayed sat below it, trying not to look proud at the tone of John’s voice. “You picked the locks, you little menace.”
Sherlock hummed, pulled away from the window. “You can spend your afternoon how you like. We’ll leave at half past five. I’ll be back soon.”
“Your date?” John called from his bedroom. “What does that mean?”
John nodded. “Mm. He was a friend of mine back in the day. A really good friend. He got shot in the stomach during a raid one day and… You know what, forget it.” He put the photo down with a fake smile, pouring some water into their mugs. “It’s not a nice story.”
John busied himself with squinting sceptically up at the building they’d parked in front of. “It’s… It’s a bowling alley.”
“Into what? Do I need to find a suit? I don’t think I’ve got any that are dry-cleaned.” John moved to sit at the edge of Sherlock’s bed, scrubbing a hand over his face.
Sherlock snorted at that. In his mind, having been in a worse situation was no reason to be in a bad one again. He wasn’t, however, willing to press the issue, and so gave John a withering look and turned to watch the dark and dreary landscape.
“And then you waited for them to cosy up, and you brought them to me, because you knew exactly what I’d do.”
“John, what does a heart attack feel like?”
“No, you need to tell me,” he insisted, more softly this time. “Please. I have to know.”
He cringed against the shrill call of her voice and nodded. “Yeah,” he mumbled. He reached up and tried to push the oxygen mask away, and she plucked his weak hand back and set it next to him again.
By the time he’d caught his breath and turned his head to rest his chin on John’s chest, the hard-on he’d felt beneath him before had disappeared but John wasn’t showing any signs of orgasm. Sherlock frowned.
. John felt like the worst person in the world when Fawnlock’s smile fell away and he looked at the floor. He stood up quickly.
“Pleasure doing business with you, doctor. Get home safe, now.”
John completely ignored her little comments. He’d been having bad feelings in the last few months that she was actually starting to be serious when she mentioned things like that. “Mm, I guess they have beds everywhere in university. You wouldn’t have to look far for work.”
was the one wasting the
“You say so often enough.” Sherlock smiled and kissed John’s forehead softly. With any luck, he wouldn’t remember any of it in the morning. “You’re lovely, you know. Perfect.”
“I don’t believe this,” he continued, quieter this time, though it was more out of shock. “I don’t believe it. Don’t the police know it’s a fake?”
“You two are adorable,” Harry said from the doorway, a white plastic bag swinging off her finger.
One of these days we'll find the plot. One of these days.
On Harry’s part, she was trying to pretend she didn’t notice how tightly she was squeezing him. John looked bad – really bad. It had been three days, and there was a misshapen bruise still flowering in purple on his jaw, an ugly brace strapped to his ankle, and a clean white cast on his wrist. Under her fingers, she could feel both the edges of a chest wrap, and a few too many protruding bones. The gaunt look he had about him said he hadn’t slept in weeks, and she was going to hug him forever for letting any of this happen.
“No problem,” John said, turning and grinning at Sherlock as the man worked his way through the tables. “Mm,
Sebastian continued to stare at John, but now his face was blank except for the faint glare in the furrow of his eyebrows. John didn’t even look at ‘Jim’. He didn’t think his stomach would be able to take any more twists.
He glanced between them with a keen smile. “Certainly. Here’s your wine, your glasses are on the table… I’ll leave this here for you.”
Fawnlock’s head perked at that word. It always did. He looked at John. “Food?”
“Early bedtime, I think. Come on.”
“No, not…” John swallowed hard and blushed. “Not for me. I’m fine, trust me. I just… I don’t want you to feel rushed.”
February, Dr. Watson?”
Realisation dawned. John’s eyes changed shape, his mouth fell open slightly.
“No, he just… I was texting him.” He rested his cheek against John’s head and closed his eyes. “He just stopped replying. I wanted to make sure he was okay.”
It was another two hours before he was allowed in to see John. His brother followed at his heels, a supportive but not intrusive presence as he was lead to a private room and shown in. Mycroft waited outside.
at the time, but now he was. He was very adept at spotting them now, even retrospectively, and the first had been over the summer. It had been July, if he remembered correctly. 15
Mycroft nodded. He stared down at his own clean hands. “He’ll be alright.”
By the time he found Fawnlock, he was already painting the markings onto his face. John didn’t have time to marvel over the river he hadn’t known existed, because he had his curious gaze switched over to Fawnlock.
There was a naked man in the forest. Right outside his house. Nobody could say the thought wasn’t slightly concerning.
"Yep?"
Once they had a basic form of language going, things got a lot easier. Tenses were still a mystery to Fawnlock, but John had spent years serving in a foreign country where most of them could speak partial English, so deciphering what he meant was easy. Besides, Fawnlock was an astonishingly fast and eager learner. John supposed that, being as he’d likely lived alone his whole life, it was an essential self-preservation trait to be able to learn.
A paramedic appeared above him.
“No. I’m his boyfriend. Seen it all before. Let me do it.” Sherlock held his hand out for the gown and the nurse deliberated for a moment.
He took a deep, cleansing breath, and got up, automatically reaching for the cane balanced against the side of his chair. He wrapped himself up in a ridiculous number of layers, grabbed his keys and useless phone, and headed out the door.
called the police.”
Sherlock was asleep. JW
“Phone password,” John said again, a bit louder this time. “Bored.”
John blinked. “So what?”
He turned around and shut the door, not looking back. Fawnlock looked confused.
John sniffed and wiped his eyes. “I… dunno.” He sighed. “I dunno.”
Just told him I’d be staying with Sherlock. And that I’d see him later in the week. I’m going when I get out of here. JW
Sherlock debated whether or not to tell John. Granted, it was a bit late to avoid giving the truth now. It could either solve some problems that had arisen between them, or upset John completely. At last, he said, “You kissed me. Repeatedly.”
John pursed his lips. “That was actually his
When John’s coat was on the rack, he turned to watch Sherlock hang up his scarf, a longing expression on his face. Sherlock slowly turned to face him, the same look on his own. Right there, in front of their wide-open front door, they wrapped their arms around each other and they kissed.
John put the bag by the door. He went to change into his pyjamas for the evening and when he got back, Fawnlock was crouched over next to the door, towel abandoned on the sofa. As John approached he saw him rearranging the chains and flowers on the bag, spreading them out to dry them off. John rested his hand on an antler. He knew Fawnlock could feel the weight. He didn’t seem to mind.
In the second hour the psychologist spent with them, he handed John a mental health questionnaire to fill in. “I’ve gone with the adult one,” he said, “so ignore any questions that don’t apply, like the workplace ones. Just imagine they’re talking about school. The kid one’s too simple for you. They need a teen one, really…”
afraid of him, however, with the confidence and elegance it conducted itself with. John had to wonder if he’d ever be that gracious with a concussion. He doubted it.
“Oh, right,” John said sarcastically, nodding his head. “How silly of me.
“Yeah.”
“Mm, I’m hungry,” John said through a stretch. “Food?”
for this ending. It's entirely based on a roleplay we did, and she wrote all of John's dad.
Sherlock kissed him again, this time with his lips parted and dipping into John’s at every opportunity. John was a fantastic kisser – and, from the other end, John thought that Sherlock was, too, even if he was a little bit out of practice. He’d never experienced kissing like this before: kissing with a balance between lust and emotion. Not this sort of balance, at least. It was hard to pin down, as everything with Sherlock was, but both of them felt, somewhere, that it was more like sharing than giving or taking. The urgency was there but it was only bobbing along the bottom or the back of their minds. Even in the few serious relationships John had ever had, foreplay hadn’t been this sincere.
“Go home and get a cup of tea.”
“Handled worse than a phone call these last few years. I’m sure I’ll be fine. I just wanted to talk to him.”
Not really. Maybe? Can’t tell. He was horrible, and then I told him I loved him and he said it back, and then he said, ‘Son, get help’. But he said it. JW
Sherlock thought for a second. Was he feeling any of those things? “What about a fluttering sensation?” he said, cringing. He really couldn’t think of any better words for it, but he hadn’t meant for it to sound so pathetic.
“I’m not sweet,” Sherlock muttered, but he relaxed. “Kiss me again.”
Well, John assumed he was naked because his arms and legs were bare. He really didn’t want to see if the guy was wearing pants or not.
John whined hopelessly and dropped his face into his hands. He didn’t think he’d survive out here much longer. Sure, he’d been good at fieldwork, but not… Not
“Sorry,” he muttered bitterly, blinking at the ceiling.
“I don’t understand,” John said again, this time through gritted teeth.
John didn’t reply to that. “Leave me alone,” he said instead.
John didn’t know what to say; his face remained an open book of hope, pride, and affection. Sherlock moved his head forwards and kissed him again, softly, slowly.
Sure enough, it shoved everything in the bag and went for the door. Once it got outside John heard the fast – if light – thud of a man sprinting away from his cottage. He heard a mug smash on the ground outside. That was when the loneliness finally set in for the first time since he’d come back to England, because suddenly he only had a shocking mess in his cottage to remind him he’d ever had anyone at all.
“I’ll keep it covered,” John continued, his voice thickening and breaking. “It’ll go away soon, promise. Sorry. I’m sorry.”
he loves you. It’s not that he can’t stand to have his hands on you, or whatever you think it is. It’s that he wants you to live.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and huffed, flopping back onto the sofa. He could still hear John sniggering quietly as he closed his eyes and gathered his thoughts – again. Eventually he began his shuffling, letting go of John’s hands. He crossed his legs beneath him and turned to face John fully, pushing his companion’s legs until one was sat underneath him (John, after many shouts and protestations, told Sherlock he couldn’t actually cross his legs anymore because he wasn’t, in fact, five years old) and they were facing each other on the sofa. Just as they had been before, except this time they had less opportunities to turn away. Again, very slowly, Sherlock took John’s hands and pulled them in close, stroking the backs of his hands with his thumbs. Then he leaned forward, eyes closed, and kissed him. Only once and only very slowly, he kissed him.
“Sorry for that interruption, by the way. I wasn’t expecting things to get so far along, but the traffic was pretty bad on the way over here – not to mention I had my own fair share of distractions. Fucking hell, John, you could at least try and look a little bit pleased.” Sebastian crouched down and picked out one of the keys, but John flinched and snatched his hands away from his touch. Sebastian rolled his eyes. “Oh, come on. It’s the keys. To your handcuffs. What the hell do you think I’m going to do,
John nodded. “Just checking.” He put a hand up and stroked over his own with the pad of his index finger to ensure his pin was still in place. He’d checked it a few times already, but once more wouldn’t hurt.
John, who had been expecting more arguments on why he shouldn’t see their dad, hadn’t been listening to a word. “Don’t know what you’re on about, Harry,” he murmured automatically, poking gently at the slowly-healing cut on his head. It turned out painkillers didn’t work for direct pokes on fresh wounds.
“The dogging society,” Sherlock answered easily, and John choked on his drink.
“Glove compartment.”
“No, I don’t wanna go away.” He started sniffling again. “I wanna stay with my dad.”
Oh, hell. Sherlock supposed he should have known he’d be hearing of it again. “It wasn’t unpleasant,” he admitted, working to keep the flush from his cheeks, “and you didn’t seem upset by it.”
He’d taken a cold shower and determinedly pulled his suit back on, refusing to let the heat put him out of his usual, cool self, and, when he’d finally finished messing around with his hair in attempt to get it to look less like that of a ragdoll, he came out to find John waiting for him. His hair was stuck to his forehead with sweat and his breathing was slightly laboured, suggesting he’d only just got in, but his too-small jumper was already off and he was leaning casually against the doorway to the kitchen in an attempt at making Sherlock believe he’d been waiting for a while.
John took a second to breathe and then got up, trusting it to stay when he went out to make himself some food. When he got back in the faun was playing with his windows, and he arrived just in time to see the latch unclick. The faun looked at him guiltily and threw his knife onto the floor.
“Human.
“No, I need to be with him. Please. I need to go with him. He needs me,” Sherlock insisted desperately, but they carried John, now suspiciously passive, down and into the ambulance on a stretcher. DI Lestrade pointed out that there were two seats in the back, and, with his permission, Sherlock climbed aboard and took John’s good hand.
Fawnlock leapt on the spot, hitting his antlers on the window with a jolt as he shouted.
John genuinely forgot how to breathe. He nodded. “Yes. Yes, good. Human.”
John went still immediately. His eyes glinted in the light, moisture gathering, and Sherlock’s heart sank in his chest at the realisation that he may have said something John didn’t appreciate. The fingers tightened around his chin, squashing his lips together again, as John spoke.
He’d managed to dream up his own little world to live in while he went crazy. Well, nobody could say that insanity hadn’t been kind to him, could they?
on me, it is
“I panicked,” Sherlock growled. He turned his face away with a huff. “Shut up.”
“I’m…” He hesitated a moment, in his thrusts and in his voice, and then spluttered on. “Inside you. With… with my penis.”
“Piss off,” John said. He tipped his head back and stared at the ceiling. He shrugged. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Just step back, please,” the assisting medic said, putting an arm in front of him and keeping him sitting back on his heels. “We’re looking after him.”
John swallowed. He lifted the beam up, and then down, and then up again. Then he shone it down his body again. Then back at his head. Then up further, over the antlers protruding from it. This didn’t make sense, but he couldn’t just leave him here. He was hurt, his
“I bet you couldn’t pass the physical,” Mr Watson said scathingly.
he started telling me that nursing was a girl’s job. Because he assumed, you know, he thought that, if I wasn’t smart enough to be a doctor, I’d be a nurse.” He swallowed and wiped his eyes, taking a deep breath. “But, um. I told him that actually, nurses were just as smart as doctors. And he said, go on then, show me. Show me how smart you are. Get your homework. But I hadn’t done it yet. So he, he came up to see it. And it just… you know. Happened.” He sniffed again, turning his face to wipe his wet cheeks on his shoulders. “And then he tore my textbooks up and left. Simple as.”
“Alright,” he said, resigned. He took another step back so he was out in the hall. “Alright, calm. I’ll be… Um, I’ll be here. Right here, okay?”
The treatment of this room was very similar to the treatment of the last – it pressed buttons and stripped shelves and opened cupboards and lined things up and inspected them inside and out, touching everything. As he went along he gathered another pile of things, this one including a book with pictures, a clicking pen, the TV remote, a baby blue slipper, and a navy blue scarf from the hooks by the door.
Sherlock gave him a very pointedly offended look. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Oh my God, John, are you alright?!” she breathed, clutching his shoulders as hard as she could.
There was silence for a few more seconds. John spoke first.
“Please, John. Don’t be difficult.” John had to question how Sebastian had made it sound like John was the one in the wrong.
Harry heaved a sigh and moved her chair closer. Sherlock was tempted to open his mouth and intervene, because he could see a certain
“It’s okay,” he said softly, holding up his hands innocently. The deer’s wide eyes stared at him from above the door. “It’s okay, I won’t hurt you.”
“Why would you care? You’ve been wanting to get rid of me for ages. Your sister would have done it better than you.”
John tried not to let the cold weight settling in his chest affect him. He tried to think of it in an I’m-such-a-great-kisser-that-I-broke-Sherlock way instead of a Sherlock-hated- it-so-much-I-broke-him way. At the back of his mind, though, despite the concern for Sherlock and the disappointment that they wouldn’t be getting any further tonight, he was angry that he’d be ending yet another Remembrance Day with a drink.
“I’m only nice to you,” he reminded him, rolling onto his side and resting his hand on John’s hip to keep him from moving so much. “And you’re really drugged right now, so keep that in mind before you do something you’re going to get embarrassed about later. Put your mask back on.”
“They look beautiful now,” John replied quietly, tearing his eyes from the walls and meeting Sherlock’s. He swallowed hard at the utter feeling in his face. This wasn’t Sherlock Holmes. It wasn’t the one he knew. Not yet.
“No, sir.”
Before they got there, though, Sherlock did.
John looked at him, really looked at him, this strange friend that he’d grown so close to in the last few months. Someone he’d gone from never looking at to hiding behind in emergencies. He was glad Sherlock was there; he didn’t think any of the rest of his friends would have had the guts to come with him. “What’s happened to my dad and my sister?”
“We’ve radioed in for an ambulance. Just need to make sure you’re alright,” the officer said, smiling calmly at both of them. He looked at Sherlock. “Who are you?”
DI Lestrade shook his head. “It’s a matter for the state now, John,” he said, glancing at Sherlock. “It’s been taken over. There’s nothing you can do but let us try and help you.”
“Maybe we should go to Angelo’s.”
Sherlock suspected that he'd been a man from God knew where with some vague first aid training and a love of medical dramas. "Oh. Good."
“Oh. Sorry.” Sherlock put his glass down awkwardly. John didn’t mind.
All of this complaining, of course, was deflection. She wasn’t an idiot, and she understood perfectly well the tensions that had been roasting their house for the last six years, but, in all that time, she’d never seen it escalate beyond a one-night trip to the hospital. Those policeman had told her that it had all happened three days ago. Three days ago, on Sunday, when she’d last walked out to go and see a fun old friend for a few days. Three days ago, when she’d left her baby brother on his own against their burly, drunken father.
The raging fire that used to be his life had been put out, and he had to accept that, but it didn’t mean he had to like it. He just had to start a new fire.
“I want to talk to him,” John said, his voice getting tighter and more watery with every word. “Please. I’d like to talk to him.”
As soon as it slammed there was an almost comically timed clap of thunder. It was the most interesting thing to happen to him in weeks, and that realisation made him sad. After a moment of standing under the small porch he headed out into the dark afternoon for a thorough soaking. Perhaps a touch of sickness would provide him with something different, or at least an excuse to get back into the city.
“Yes?”
John understand? He’d had friends his whole life. John’s natural state when faced with strangers and dangers was ‘friend’. Sherlock had been isolated as a child – willingly, he freely admitted, but isolated nonetheless. The few times he’d tried reaching out his hand had returned cold and bloodied, for the most part. He’d genuinely had no idea what friendship felt like before John. He’d gotten a taste of it with Lestrade, of course, but nobody ever had to know that.
The largest of the two small ones slammed a punch to John’s gut and he groaned loudly, dropping his chin to his chest.
John nodded slowly. “But there’s one thing you still haven’t told me. Two things, really. What do you want?” He spoke slower, making sure every word got across.
“Well, maybe you can figure out what he said, then,” Harry said sharply, “because my dad isn’t known for displays of affection, and apparently he told John that he loved him and to get help.”
It was long, upsetting, and tiring. They talked for an hour about John’s situation (not in any specific detail, but about his life as a whole) and his schoolwork – which, in itself, had been a jungle.
blog – he was quite proud) and that was much more tasty than the wine had been. Sherlock had been right about the tagliatelle, though John wasn’t sure why.
John hummed. "What about you?"
Sebastian just rolled his eyes, letting his arms fall back to his sides. “Please, John. It wasn’t a courtroom of people, it was the entire building. I’m not that unprofessional.”
Sherlock was in his pyjamas and sprawled back across the sofa, the latest issue of
As soon as the waiter came over, he stuck out his hand for a strong, excitable shake. “You’re John Watson, aren’t you?”
Jesus. Was that all his life had become now?
The better part of the next hour passed without a word between them, but it went that way sometimes. Today Sherlock seemed to be turning all the cupboards out in search of something, and John wasn’t really in the mood for a chat, but he was keeping a close eye on the time. Regent’s Park was just a short walk away but he wanted to be there in good time and it was already ten o’clock.
John blinked again. “You what?”
something.”
“Liar.”
“Sherlock Holmes.”
John thought) had grinned in response to what Sebastian had said, and put its sharp teeth on full display for John to enjoy as he saw fit. They were odd teeth, really. John gathered that they were more human than wolf, but much sharper once they reached the canines and back. He didn’t spend very long dwelling on them, instead letting his eyes take in the black-furred canine ears, legs, and clawed fingernails. This one seemed a lot more animalistic than his Fawnlock. The black eyes were certainly a bit more unnerving than Fawnlock’s rich brown.
“For indictable offences like murder, that’s the maximum we can hold you without charging you, but I daresay you’ll be charged and given a court hearing very quickly and then put on remand.” The voice floated through the bars of John’s cell, and he could almost hear the shrug.
Sherlock started counting. He held the mask against John’s face with what was likely too much force, but he really didn’t like the idea of an even more damaged lung. He kept counting and breathing with John until tears were no longer streaming down his cheeks and the healthy flush returned to his sickly white face.
John lay on the floor, staring up at his ceiling, the room spinning and his head buzzing. It was dark out, and probably some sort of ridiculous hour in the morning, but who cared? It was the weekend. He ground a custard cream slowly between his teeth.
“Okay, and where are you, sir?”
Is everything alright? SH
“You’re so bloody much like her,” his dad growled. “You always have been, and I’ve had to live with that every day from that day to this. She died and you didn’t.”
“Need to change his gown. Want to step out?” The nurse brought a clean one over and unfolded it.
“Hello,” John sang in greeting when he recognised Sherlock. He was beaming through his battered face and tired eyes. “Where you been?”
“Sherlock,” John said, his tone protesting even as he let Sherlock push him back onto the double bed. “Are you sure you’re alright with this? I think we’re going too fast.”
the larger one shrieked. Sherlock immediately felt awful for his lack of concern, as John was clearly suffering very much, and at his hands, no less, so he reached over and clamped a hand around the biggest one’s mouth, wrenching him away and off of John. He threw him down onto the pavement and his drunken body was too slow and clumsy to reach out in time and break his fall. His head connected with the pavement with a dull thud and he was out cold straight away.
They slipped into a sad silence. Well, the sad was mostly on John’s end, but Sherlock was hardly the best of remedies. He was a cool exterior with a floundering mind, scrabbling around for purchase on a slippery floor, because what the hell was he supposed to say now? Nothing, maybe. Were they supposed to be happy when they turned up for the service, even? God, he wished he remembered more about etiquette for these sorts of things. He counted himself lucky that John didn’t seem to mind the mutual silence.
Sherlock was a little torn, if he was being honest. The only thing that had been on his mind for the last hour had been kissing John senseless, and now that that was underway… well, he realised that he hadn’t really thought this far ahead. He’d meticulously planned each hour of their day up to this point and conveniently forgotten that things that weren’t
Sometime the next morning, a plastic tray of food was deposited through John’s door. Once he got up the will to see what was on it, he mostly wished he hadn’t. There was a tiny plastic fork lying in a groove down the centre. In four quarter-shaped sections sat a dry piece of toast, two barely fried eggs, a small dollop of baked beans, and a rasher of bacon that took a little too long to recognise. He ate the more cooked parts of the eggs and got the toast down with some help from the beans, but only because he hadn’t gotten to finish his dinner the evening before. He’d been starving.
“How long have you been telling yourself that for?”
John rolled his eyes. “Never mind. Romance film cliché, that’s all.”
John hugged Fawnlock back and muttered the comforts near his ear, his head positioned just so his face was protected from the sharp ends that he could see had scratched his window.
Organised chaos would have been the term. John had barely said ten words in the entire hearing before it had happened. Their irrefutable CCTV still was just being presented when an official-looking older man in a black suit had come bursting through the main entrance to the courtroom and walked very deliberately up to the judge, whose face said that she at least had some sort of idea what was happening, even if everyone else’s were saying otherwise.
The call was passed on. Sherlock waited.
After that, the kissing got slower again. John settled over Sherlock, his erection getting heavy in his pants, and lined their crotches up. He thrust slowly against the groin beneath his own, savouring every spark of friction and every burst of heat he got. Just as he started to relax into the steady rhythm, Sherlock slid his hands down and over his hips. His fingers stroked and teased at the elastic of his underwear until, finally, he pushed it down and used a foot to hook it over John’s heels. John’s face blushed a very pretty shade of pink once the pants were gone, and Sherlock once again took control to roll them back over and pull his own boxers down.
Adam’s nostrils flared and he picked them up and put them back on the bed. “They’ll be important for the case against your dad in court,” he said quietly, pretending to leaf through his folder.
“Hey,” he called over his shoulder, dropping his paper in his lap. “It’s ten o’clock, I think you need to put some clothes on.”
Then, John had said to him, “Your hair looks hilarious.”
“I’m sorry?”
Maybe just to try wouldn’t be so bad. Kissing couldn’t be that hard, he’d done it himself a few times. He’d never kissed because he actually wanted to kiss someone, though. Was that different?
“Oh, I am,” Moran replied keenly and with a careless shrug. He opened his door. “Aren’t I allowed a bit of fun? I did just rescue you from a murder charge.”
John couldn’t seem to breathe properly. He was hurting and confused and he was so tired he could hardly move a muscle. He just kept his good hand fisted in Sherlock’s coat and waited, drifting in and out of consciousness.
“I’m sorry?” John scoffed as he buttered the bread. “You’re the fussiest person I’ve ever met. You get annoyed if your socks aren’t in order.”
Sherlock chuckled quietly. He didn’t say anything back but he reached over into the top drawer of the cabinet by his bed and plucked out a bottle of lube and two condoms, laying the protection on the other side of the bed and rubbing a drop of the lubricant over two fingers.
“Please,” John squeaked, thankful that the iron grip on his bad shoulder had finally been relinquished.
Sherlock shuffled closer to John. He put his hand on the hipbone closest to him and held firm, but not hard. "Everyone needs someone," he insisted.
The photographs were collected in and put in a pile to the side.
Sherlock scowled at him.
John tried rolling him over onto his side, his back facing him. He took the opportunity to run a hand down his spine, which also felt fine, much to his relief. Next was inspecting the back of his head. As soon as his hand made contact with the matted hair, he knew there was blood. It was too warm, the wetness there was too thick between his fingers. He sighed and checked the pulse again; still alive. Good.
It seemed far too smart not to notice the door open, or at least the draught coming from it. This creature must have stayed by choice. John reckoned it was curious.
“Stay just today, then,” John insisted, tugging on Sherlock’s hands. “For when the police come. And the psychologist. Sit with me.”
John shrieked, standing up, balled fists at his side and shaking again. He was pulled back down by a clawed hand at his shoulder and a stern growl.
Sherlock very nearly blurted all of that out. He felt his mouth open, his tongue start moving, and bit down on it. Sometimes people told him he had no idea about human emotions, but he knew for a fact he knew about the human thought process, and John wouldn’t want any of those reminders today. Mouth shut.
There was a beat of silence. “Go to school,” Mr Watson began. “Then shape up and enlist. They need doctors in the army. If you’ve got your heart set on med school, then study up and go, but the structure of the army will be good for you. You need structure. You always have. You’re a better follower than a leader and there’s not a thing I can do to change that. Maybe your mother could’ve done a better job than I have, but she’s not here, so I did what I could.”
“My mobile number,” Sherlock snapped, and he reeled the man off the digits.
“You were perfectly enthusiastic about your identity crisis last night,” Sherlock reminded him, and while he could have said more, he elected not to.
John didn’t answer. He stayed sitting there like a shy dog, letting Sherlock stare at him and pity him, only covering his crotch with his hands to keep himself at least partially hidden.
“Please don’t say eggs again,” John joked. He pulled on Sherlock’s bum and pecked his mouth. “Just… Okay. Don’t worry. Keep going, keep… Quiet.” He laughed. “Please, keep going.”
John did the opposite, tilting his own head up as he closed his eyes, too. His voice caught in his throat as he felt a warm ghost of breath over his lips – not that he’d have said anything even if he’d been able. There was a mutual pause between them at the last second, but Sherlock didn’t have time to back away because suddenly John’s mouth was on his and it was soft, so soft, and warm, and he was finally get a kiss from someone he’d wanted to get a kiss from.
“Yes.” Sherlock frowned slightly. John just laughed under his breath.
Upon reflection, he had no idea how they’d dealt with him at all. He’d been panicking badly, not thinking or seeing clearly, but he knew he’d been awake. He remembered blurs of sound and colour and faces, but nothing clearly, that was all. He very distinctly remembered a plate of food being placed in front of him, and he downed it all in two minutes and then threw it back up all over the bed. An hour and a drink of water later, he had another, slower try at a different tray. This one stayed down, and his headache started to disappear.
“Mm?” John answered, rolling his head around to meet Sherlock’s eye. Somehow over the course of the last hour he’d slumped right down the sofa.
As it turned out the faun got completely distracted from its investigation. It was five minutes until he made his next appearance, staring at John from the doorway to the living room. There was the green from some hand-grown carrots clutched in his hands. Some of the stalks still had a centimetre of carrot left on them, and some of them had had half of their greens bitten off as well as their orange. When John pulled his gaze from the vegetables, he flinched. The faun was staring him right in the eye, looking particularly confident.
“This again? God. Alright, John. I’m going to explain it to you one more time, and you have to listen. Everything I’m about to tell you is the truth. Does that make sense?” Sebastian slowed down and slapped on a patronising smile at the last question.
John frowned at him scornfully in the rear view mirror and happened to catch his own reflection as he did. He didn’t hear Moran’s self-satisfied chuckle, mostly because he was so taken aback by the sight of himself.
He had nothing to offer them. Nothing except himself, and didn’t that thought just set his stomach churning again?
“I really don’t understand what’s happened,” John admitted worriedly, his hand still safely keeping Sherlock’s. “I’m sorry. You need to actually
John, heaving a great sigh, tuned Sherlock’s incessant page-flicking out and focused on the news. It probably wasn’t the best idea he’d ever had, really, watching the news on Remembrance Day when he’d already been quite miserable enough for one day, but it was better than the rest of the daytime crap that was on. Besides, it brought his attention back to the real matters at hand, what the day was supposed to be about.
John squirmed on the spot, his jaw tensing. He sank back onto his pillows, beginning to regret ever telling either of them. “I dunno. It doesn’t matter, I just wanted to talk.”
“Who the fuck are you?” John asked firmly. His hands clenched unconsciously into fists, and Sebastian noticed that, too, with a faintly amused glimmer in his eyes.
John stirred slightly. He blinked a few times until his eyes would open, and then he stared up at the ceiling, still not ready to move.
Sherlock hummed. “John.”
"You're a terrible liar. Your hands don't have a single scuff on them. Try again." Sherlock watched him expectantly.
“I’m okay,” he said with a frown. “I’m really okay.”
“Because you’re too uptight about it and it would’ve given you one more thing to angst about,” Sherlock shot back between the kisses, truthful to a fault. “Your father was already beating you up. You never would have wanted to give him a reason for it – not that his reasons were valid to begin with.”
“Mm, I’m not sure yet,” Moran answered thoughtfully, glancing over John again. “I’m sure Jim can think of something creative. If not, the police will be more than willing to arrest someone in your situation for much less than today’s reasoning. Think about it.”
“John Watson,” the man said with a smile. John nodded and he let himself in. “I’m Adam. Resident child psychologist. Pleased to meet you. I should say, before we go any further, that this was meant to be a private consultation.” He pointed at Sherlock.
frantic. Nobody had ever knocked on that door before. Nobody that wasn’t the postman, and it was far too late for that now.
They didn’t talk about it, not for a few weeks. John carefully skirted every vague question Sherlock hinted at, and Sherlock didn’t want to upset John and alienate the only close friend he’d ever had – he’d started spending all of his breaks with Sherlock, if he could find him. Sherlock had told him he should stay with his friends, but he argued every time. They lived in a sort of imbalanced equilibrium, happy to never mention anything to each other, but things came to a head one day a few weeks later, as they always tended to. This was what Sherlock had been waiting for.
“Nobody’s given me an erection I haven’t wanted in ten years,” he murmured, rubbing his thumbs over the backs of John’s fingers. “Not one person.”
The next thing he knew there was cold wind in his face and ground under his backside. It took him a second to register the oxygen mask being hooked over his head and the blanket that had been draped over his shoulders. He lifted his hand – free hand? – up and tried to pull away the mask.
Sherlock looked across at him, suspicious. “John, what is it?”
“All I want is you,” Moran said with a faint smile. “I want you on standby.”
“Did I… Did I ever tell you how much I love dirty talk?” he gasped, deliberately clenching around Sherlock, who thought for a moment as he moved.
As he walked, mud and leaves caking his shoes and rain mercilessly battering his face, he used that train of thought to keep himself occupied.
Moran put his feet down, and John could see him staving off either an ‘I knew it’ or an ‘Excellent’. He couldn’t tell which.
“Ready?” he asked. John nodded and took his menu back as the waiter from earlier came over with a bottle of red wine. “We’ll have one tagliatelle carbonara and a ravioli, please.”
“I-I’m sorry?” John frowned and looked over Sherlock’s shoulder to the kitchen. “Did you just say ‘eggs’?”
He was passed over almost immediately.
Sherlock could hardly look at John, but he obeyed, forcing his mind away from that shameful slipup and concentrating on finding the prostate again.
“What?” Sherlock snapped, apparently having zoned out briefly. “What?”
Harriet Watson had no idea what she was doing. At nineteen years old, she was in the last six months of her gap year, now, before her first year of university started. She’d spent the entire year drinking with her friends, been hospitalised twice – but only
When he got no reply to that, John started to get nervous again. What if they weren’t real police officers? Had he just given himself over to a kidnapper? Or, worse, some sort of crime ring? What sort of criminals would want to kidnap
“Well, then… call someone. There’s nowhere for you to stay here. Call Clara – does she still live close?”
“Broken wrist,” Sherlock began, staring down at his reddened hands. “Trauma to the head. I suspect a damaged ankle and several damaged ribs, too, from the way he was groaning as he was moved, but I’m no doctor.”
“Right. Well, I think it’s time you told me what you’ve been planning now.”
“It was the first time I wanted to kiss you.”
it, he
John sighed and grimaced as Sherlock pressed his cold hands all over his head. Then he tried to think and, sure enough, it wasn’t long until the answer came to him. Sherlock shocked him by reaching his freezing hands under his jumper and pulling his trousers up far too high, and it was with that final yelp of pain and surprise that it solidified in his head.
When he finally got back on the bus, he flopped down into one of the priority seats, not caring to walk any further. He’d done a lot today. He deserved the priority seats. It wasn’t like anybody was going to want to sit next to him, anyway, so he put his bags on the second seat.
Sherlock grinned and shuffled in closer, moving John’s oxygen mask down and out of the way of their conversation. “You’re thinking about kissing me, but you don’t want to admit it. You want to be close, but now that your inhibitions are back up to normal, you wouldn’t dream of actually doing it.”
“Mm…” John whimpered and his eyes went wide as he began to take in the various pains shooting through his body. “M’head.”
Bestiality was very, very illegal.
he reminded himself. “How long?”
of this Richard Brook man, how could he have killed him? He lived in the middle of bloody nowhere, for God’s sake. It took all of his willpower not to panic and start struggling, but the realistic part of him knew that thrashing when one had been arrested for murder was not the most sensible course of action.
John didn’t have a reply to that, so he pushed the mask back into place and breathed for a little while. Sure enough, a short while later, a nurse came with a small top-up of morphine for him. As soon as it was pumped into the tap in his arm, his whole body relaxed, his breathing finally slowing slightly, though it remained ragged. He opened his eyes and finally looked at Sherlock clearly. As Sherlock looked right back, he could see every muscle in John’s body finally unwinding and loosening just the way they all needed to, and he couldn’t help but smile. Unfortunately, in his habit of noticing things, he also noticed the way John’s eyes widened slightly, and seemed to go just out of focus.
Well, that was strange, but John didn’t have any space left in his brain to think anything more about it, because only a madman would try and create a business partner from a wolf.
Sherlock tipped his head back down and kept undoing John’s buttons, starting the pecks again. He kissed straight down the centre of John’s chest, circled around his belly button, and followed the faint trail of hair leading down to his crotch. As soon as he reached the more sensitive skin John’s breathing picked up and he smiled to himself. After another little kiss he crawled back up the half-stripped body and returned to John’s mouth, leaving one hand down there.
John locked the phone and slid it back into Sherlock’s pocket, sick of Harry’s damp wetting his newfound high. He rolled onto his side to face his bed partner and lifted their joined hands to his face, holding Sherlock’s fingers to his cheek in an affectionate embrace. He heard the phone vibrate in his pocket, but ignored it, closing his eyes in wait of Sherlock’s proper waking up. A few minutes later, Sherlock’s thumb started moving against his jaw, stroking gently, and his phone went off again.
“Perhaps we should have waited.”
Sherlock was awake, watching John, all night. He watched the readings on the screen from the peg on his finger, and he watched his wheezing chest, and he watched his arms, vowing to go out in search of another blanket at the first sign of goosebumps. Nothing happened until the next morning, when John woke up in pain so intense that it sent him roaring into a similar state of distress to the one he’d experienced the night before. He was starting to liken them to panic attacks, though he had no idea if that was what they were.
and John finally moaned in a breathless way that didn’t say ‘fucking ow’.
When he was finished the doctor left and a policeman he didn’t recognise came in to handcuff him again and lead him back to his cell. He had to stifle a yawn as best he could with his shoulder as he unlocked the gate for him. Truthfully, he was just thankful that the cuffs had been removed again. He collapsed onto the little bench, exhausted, and flopped sideways. He was certain he was meant to have a mattress but the pillow was good enough.
“Why not?”
“Why did you call him Jim?” he blurted, risking a glance back to his side. The wolf-man looked amused. When he looked back, so did Sebastian.
Glasses and mugs had been systematically lined up in order of height and colour all across the work surfaces, and plates had been laid out similarly on the little table he ate at. The cutlery had been spread out on the floor in lines, along with all of his vegetables (most of which had a few bites taken out of them and some he could have sworn he’d had more of) and various packets of biscuits. Two of the packets had been opened, but, assuming it had realised there were the same sorts of things in each pack, he’d left the others sealed and put them down to look at them in line with everything else. All of his cupboards had been left open with their few remains on display at the front.
With a warm embrace around his hand, the rest of the service seemed to pass quickly. A veteran laid one with a salute, an old man neither of them recognised laid one, a couple of child cadets laid one. There was a final hymn and then a goodbye that invited everyone to stay and watch the procession of scooters, but neither John or Sherlock understood any reason for there being scooters at a Remembrance Day service, so they turned around and left, Sherlock still holding John close.
A medical crew walked in and dumped their bags. Sherlock got shoved away as they dealt with the situation, preparing syringes and saying things loudly right in John’s face and putting him on a stretcher.
Sherlock nodded. “Thank you.”
Sherlock pressed their mouths together again. He gave more pressure this time, urging John back. He felt a little smile curve the other set of lips and then he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, taking him with him as he lay back over the bed. Sherlock perched above him on all fours, elbows resting on either side of John’s head.
John took a very deliberate breath, nodding awkwardly. “Yes,” he whispered. Sherlock could hear that he’d been intending to speak aloud but hadn’t quite managed it. He tried again, a bit more confidently this time. “God, yes.”
John started to look less amused. He took Sherlock’s hands gently. “Sherlock,” he said, trying to coax him back into the real world, “it’s alright. I’m sorry, I… It was an accident. We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, okay?”
In his head the crack of splintering wood and the thud of something that wasn’t quite a tree echoed again. Jesus, what was wrong with him? It wasn’t going to be a person, not out here. It was an animal. Of course it was a bloody animal. He sighed again and turned around to go inside, but changed his mind as he was shutting the door behind him. He wiped his feet and ran through to the kitchen, plucking a large torch from a basket of them under the sink and heading back out.
“Wait, you…
They were responsible for seven arrests in total. After the drug dealer they walked a bit longer and caught an armed robbery taking place at a house, and a woman and her two children were being held hostage at knifepoint. Sherlock said that counted as a kidnapping, and John agreed. After all, they didn’t have conditions on
Sherlock grumbled, shoving one of the medium-sized drinks towards John. He took him by his free hand and pulled him up. “You owe me about four pounds.”
need you to take your medicine, and stay off your ankle, and get rest, and not aggravate your injuries.
Sherlock sighed deeply, so relieved that his gesture had been accepted that he felt a bit faint. Perhaps he should have eaten breakfast in the many hours he’d been up.
“Okay?” he breathed, kissing his cheek. John nodded with a faint hum.
“They already did them,” John argued, his face crumpling. “While I was asleep the other day, they did them. When they got here. And they put this on me.” He lifted his broken wrist, indicating his cast.
“No,” Sherlock said. He sat up. “You woke up once before. I didn’t expect you to remember it, you were high as a bloody kite.”
Sherlock frowned at him. "John?"
John paid with his card, but Sherlock left a generous tip, mostly because at the end of the meal John looked so elated and proud of himself that he thought their waiter deserved a bit extra. Maybe, because of all the buffing up the man had done for his ego, John would be willing to go a bit further with him tonight.
John laughed and the faun jumped back at the unexpected cackling.
He took John’s coat and hung it on the back of the door with his own. Not surprisingly, John’s first stop was the kettle.
“All we need is for it to rain.”
“Oh, John,” Sherlock breathed, his heart breaking. “She’s a year older than us. She doesn’t go to school anymore. She doesn’t even go to university.”
The next week flew by in a whirlwind of comfort, teaching, learning, exploring. John had never been happier, although the idea of his best friend being an animal was slightly unnerving. He supposed the best friend thought he was an animal, too, though, so that made him feel a bit better.
filled Regent’s Park.
That phrase had been haunting him for a while now, far longer than simply the last hour. It had been persistent, but not the first of its kind.
John had the wind knocked out of him the first time Sherlock rocked his hips against his. “Bloody hell, Sherlock,” he breathed, knotting his fingers into his hair and pulling him down for a much more bruising kiss.
“No,” Sherlock agreed, “our one will be much better.”
“No, not tonight.” Sherlock glanced down the road, eyes narrowing as he looked for something. John had no idea what he was looking at; they were still pretty close to home.
Sherlock gave him the address. “He’s in his room. The back room.”
Sherlock didn’t really know what to say to that. John was lying, that much was obvious. He felt like it was his duty, perhaps, as a soldier, to honour their fallen heroes, his duty more than it was anybody else’s because that was how John thought sometimes. Even if he did need a reason to have missed it, he’d have had one, because if Sherlock was correct in his calculations (he’d never asked) John would only have been in his first or second month home in November two years ago. Sherlock wasn’t an idiot; he knew John had been depressed. Not for conventional reasons, perhaps, but he had been, and that was all that was important. He’d have been lonely and depressed and just invalided home from Afghanistan – who
It sounded likely to her, but apparently not to the pretty stranger. Judging from his face – what was his name again, Sherlock? – Harry expected he’d been told a different story.
“Where are they?” he insisted, trying to pull away. “Please don’t take him. Don’t do it. Please. Please, please, please.”
Sherlock chuckled deeply and gave John a gentle shove in the direction of the Starbucks. “I suppose we could get some to go. What would you like?”
Sherlock’s breath fogged the glass as he peeked over the sill again, and he stayed until he could see John’s back moving minutely. “Yeah,” he said, the relief obvious. “Yes, he’s breathing.”
John nodded, eyes still closed. “Mhm. Used your phone to text Harry.”
Sherlock moaned again at the breathless cries in his ear and responded in kind. It was a stream of nonsensical curses and noises but, somehow, he had no control over them. He couldn’t stop them.
"Fucking yes, alright?" John turned his face away slightly, self-conscious. "Leave me alone."
Sherlock stood up and hugged John’s head to his middle, letting him hide his face until he could gather himself again.
“We worry about you,” Sherlock explained.
John’s reaction was either severely delayed or non-existent. “I’m sorry, I what?”
John walked all the way down to the closest main road and sat under the little shelter that was the bus stop. He muttered a curse under his breath at the realisation that he’d left his book back at home. With a deep sigh, he slumped down on the bench and crossed his ankles, fingers entwined over his belly.
John reacted automatically, his lips moving in time against Sherlock’s even though his mind didn’t quite understand what was happening. Beside him, Sherlock couldn’t quite understand it himself. He’d expected John to freeze for a moment, and then start squirming and beating on his shoulders until he let him go. But this… this was a much nicer alternative.
“Dad hasn’t been feeding you, has he?”
“Oh, God,” John clapped a hand over his mouth. “Sorry. You okay?”
John didn’t have his keys. He remembered as soon as he got out of the cab and started walking, but there was nothing for it. He paid the driver and took off running, unable to get the churning in his stomach to abate. Fawnlock was in danger, he knew it.
For Sherlock, this seemed more of a first kiss than their first one. This time, John was in his right mind. He knew exactly what he was doing, and he still wanted it. This was different. This was
Once his clean-up was done, he decided to go for a walk.
“Oh,” Sherlock had breathed, eyes roaming John’s form again. This had been around the time John had been struggling with his funds, asking to borrow some money until he could get a job, and there he was buying Sherlock eggs that he knew would only go to what some thought of as waste. All he could think was
“You know plenty of people,” John said. “Maybe I should introduce you to my sister.”
John actually snorted a wheezy laugh just at the idea, and returned the oxygen mask to his face. The medication was helping, but he was still hurting – always was, these days, it seemed. Keeping still helped make it easier to tune out. But, really, who cared? His dad
He’d expected a lame retort about already
This time they were walking for a while. Sherlock knew every street in London, and he was walking them towards a park which had a small wood that doubled as a prime dogging spot in its spare time. He supposed John wouldn’t be too keen on the dogging (not that he knew everything about the man) but if it was used for that, what was to say it wouldn’t be used for other adult things at night, too? It was a good twenty minute walk before they got there, but Sherlock let John sort his clothes out on the way so he was a bit warmer and looked a bit more normal.
“Twat,” John muttered, rolling his newly stiffened shoulder. “I thought you were some sort of professional.”
“That’s fine. I’ll be with you by then, anyway.” John took the note and held it out to Harry.
“I don’t know. I think so. Probably, but I don’t know.”
Sherlock growled in frustration. He lifted John’s hand, still in his, and put it over his chest. He was getting increasingly squirmy and (could John’s eyes have been deceiving him?) he was even beginning to blush slightly.
John thought.
"Go to Miss Hart and say 'I'm having a bad time at home and I need help'." Sherlock nodded towards the front of the room, where their tutor was writing in a folder. "Between your face and your words, it's not a hard connection."
During his last year in the barracks they’d had an early start due the morning after, but every single one of them had had a quiet night in with a six-pack of beer. None of them really remembered what time they’d gotten to bed that night but they all remembered the atmosphere in the convoy the next morning.
“Well, we’ve got the afternoon and then the evening and then the rest of the night. That’s three parts. There are two of us. I’ll take you out for the afternoon, you take me out for the evening, and then we can both have the rest of the night here.” Sherlock slipped his shoes back on. “I’m taking you to do what I see as a fantastic date, and then you can take me on the sort of date you’d take someone on. Does that make sense?”
“Hearing adjourned.”
Don't shoot me until the notes at the very end, I beg.
John smiled to himself.
“I don’t know how it happened,” Sherlock muttered.
He sat still for another two seconds and then sprang off the sofa, dressing gown billowing out behind him. His attention turned to the cupboards for a moment before he marched back in, collected his tea, and then marched right back out again. John smiled to himself as he heard the crockery clink and some cutlery clatter from behind. He hadn’t read a word since Sherlock had made his offer, but he was finding it very funny to watch Sherlock get so flustered over something as normal as saying thanks.
“I know,” his dad said. His voice was gruff and harsh, as usual. “What do you want?”
“Emergency – which service?”
“Nope,” came the answer as Sherlock pulled on his gloves. “We’re going to turn up in Hackney and walk around until we find something.”
insane.
Fawnlock snorted, but he relaxed a little bit. Then John turned to the fridge, and he backed off a little bit. John’s hand hesitated over the handle.
“Yeah,” he said vaguely, and quickly steered them onto a different subject. “Uh, look, are they letting you home?”
“But no brothers?”
John wiped his eyes a little less subtly this time, and sniffed a lot harder. How dare people say nice things about him? “Well, thanks, but I don’t want to be a doctor anymore.”
“He’s not feeling well,” Sherlock said, rubbing John’s palms with his thumbs.
When he had his head ducked into the police car, he felt a little better. Having the weight taken off his jelly knees was possibly the most comfortable experience he’d ever had – and it was in the back of a police car during his own arrest. Wonderful.
Sherlock was about to tell John he was very welcome, but then a warm little hand slipped into his and squeezed it and all the words he’d ever learnt flew right out of his head, so instead he just squeezed back, harder, and didn’t let go. Things went quiet for a few moments as they strolled back to the road they were meant to be on, only this time hand-in-hand. John was preoccupied with not burning himself on his hot chocolate and Sherlock was preoccupied with not pulling John’s hand into his chest and never letting go.
John’s heart was pounding by the time they got to the doorway just a few seconds later; being in the hands of a professional criminal was one thing, but being held at gunpoint by one that belonged in a hospice was altogether twice as terrifying. He was just waiting for the psychotic breakdown.
“Dr. Watson,” the man smiled. He put his hands in his trouser pockets. John frowned. “Sebastian Moran. Let’s make a deal.”
“Sleep with me,” he said eagerly, pulling on Sherlock’s hand. “Nice big bed. I made room.”
“No,” John croaked. He rubbed his eyes. “I remember we were texting. And there was… you were with me, I was… must have been the ambulance. That’s it.”
John’s eyes were so wide and unblinking that they’d started watering, and he wiped them on his shoulders as his hands started shaking. “I… f-feels like I d-don’t… like I can’t…”
“Oops. Are you sure?”
“John!” he cried, fingers digging hard into John’s shoulders. A slow, amused smile was spreading across his face. “John, you’ve given me an erection!”
They stared at each other for a while.
Sherlock felt arms around him, and Mycroft pulled him into a hug. A real hug, too.
John paused. “Um, it… It’s different for everyone. Why?”
Halfway into the show, John’s hand stilled. Fawnlock noticed.
go to prison today. He had no evidence to support his case, perhaps not even the mental health assessments he’d taken.
“What do you want?” John asked, fists tightening again. “Just tell me what you’re after.”
Sherlock looked up. “You were asking me for the answers to a Chemistry paper.”
“Let me see,” Moran continued. His voice sounded closer, and John flinched, ready to get up, but as he kept speaking it became clear that he was simply walking around the room. “You found the faun first, I get that much. Does he know you… Exist?” Another brief pause, which John uses to remember how to breathe again. “Okay, so you discover the faun and keep him quiet. Then… What?”
All were added to his pile, and John finally managed to catch a glimpse of a fluffy deer tail when he crouched and transferred his new pile onto his old one. While it was distracted, John took a chance.
John snorted. He hadn’t even considered that. He sighed and wiped his eyes again. “Finally handing myself to you on a silver platter and you still don’t want me,” he mused. Then he tried to pull himself up straight and take a deep breath. “I need to go. I’m so sorry about… everything.” He felt his heart twist. Would he ever get to speak to his dad again? It shouldn’t have bothered him, but it did. “I love you.”
“You’re perfect,” Sherlock said again. “Perfect for me.”
“You’ve been through a traumatic experience and been suffering physical and emotional abuse for years. It’s understandable you’d be anxious,” Sherlock said, waving a hand. He sat back down.
“Alright, then. Well, I just wanted to talk to you first, actually. Find out what you’re thinking.” He pulled up a chair and sat down.
Bleary-eyed, he took his time waking up, but, no matter how hard he tried, couldn’t work out what time or day it was. The one thing that seemed to be firmly stamped in his head was the echoing memory of his father, and the words, ‘I love you, too.’
John smiled encouragingly. “I’m always careful. Wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.”
“… At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.”
“I was running an experiment with chickens in July and you bought me eggs.”
I was bored. JW
“That’s not quite a kidnapping, Sherlock,” John pointed out.
“It’s alright,” he whispered after a while. He had to keep John quiet – his dad was just down the hall. “Sh, John, it’s okay. You’re okay.”
The only two I remember are equations and working out that wouldn’t fit into a text message. SH
The call cut off. Sherlock whimpered and put his phone in his pocket before working the window open.
Sherlock shrugged. “I can go and find out.”
“Eggs,” Sherlock blurted. John pulled back and he stared at him with wide eyes, not really sure what had just come out of his own mouth.
John ate all of it. Well, they finished the three containers between them, somehow. Sherlock had half of one, Harry had a whole, and John had his whole one, too – plus the second half of Sherlock’s.
Sherlock scoffed. He reached over with his free hand and pushed the mask back over John’s mouth. His reply was automatic. “You’re not dying. You’re just bruised all over and have one lung temporarily out-of-order, that’s all.”
“Oh… Fuck. I mean, damn. Hold on. Go and hide.” John gestured to the bedroom urgently, relieved when Fawnlock followed a command he surely didn’t understand. John seemed frantic, John
Harry squinted. “Who’s Mycroft?”
“Do you recognise any of the men in these pictures?” The detective brought out six more pictures, all of the same man, and spread them in front of John.
need you to be here.” Sherlock’s hands moved down to hold John’s. It occurred to him that, of
John took Fawnlock’s hand on the way past him and led him to the bedroom. Then he stripped his trousers, chucked on some pyjamas, and crawled into bed.
at it, John, and you’re a good person about it. You’re not like me, I just study for the test. You actually
John trailed off, blinking hard, and felt Sherlock’s warm fingers worm their way between his. He held them and tried again.
“Me, John. You?” He pointed at the faun. It stared at his finger and kept its mouth closed.
about poultry.” John sighed and returned Sherlock’s hands to his lap. “I’ll get you a drink.”
John dropped his chin into his hand, frustrated. He wished they could just get to the damn point, at least so he could get up and leave before they found him eavesdropping.
“There’s a table for two just freed up right at the back. Do you want to sit now, or would you like it cleared first?” the man asked, pointing around the bar.
John jumped. He straightened himself up, realising how much he’d drooped with the memories of his last year in service, and turned around. “So?” he asked with a plastered on smile.
It turned out that the drive to the local court was a short one, thankfully. Neither John’s bum nor his hands had enough time to go numb, which he had to consider a bonus as he got out and arched his back. As soon as he saw the building, however, he felt his feet go numb. The seriousness of the whole situation set in: he could actually go to prison today. Well, he
John got out another. “At least the stuff I read is factual,” he pointed out, pulling the sugar over as he waited for the kettle to boil.
John’s breathing, as if it wasn’t already suffering enough, sped up even more. “I want to go to sleep.”
“Yes.”
“I can’t leave her,” John said firmly.
Jim was looking very smug.
John didn’t question any of it.
What? What the hell did that mean?
he thought bitterly.
“Over there,” Sherlock muttered, pointing at a man in perfectly fitting waiter’s clothing and too much hair gel. He was coming towards them from the back of the restaurant with a tray under his arm and a really ridiculously large grin on his face. John’s eyes caught on the little poppy in his uniform and, suddenly, he softened.
“We’ll have it cleared,” Sherlock said firmly, stepping forwards. The man looked like he was about to piss himself with excitement.
“Please,” Sherlock said easily. He made his way over to the mirror and checked over his hair, straightened out his collar.
John shrugged. “I really don’t mind. What’s near?”
But he had someone to protect.
He sighed, scratched his eyebrow with the pen, and then owned up.
“You want one?” he asked, his voice thick, and he cleared his throat with an embarrassed frown and tried again. “Would you like a cup?”
“Jesus, this could go on all night. Just tell me where you want to eat.”
He hadn’t been planning on closing the door, but he realised as soon as they passed the doorway that there was a small chance Mrs Hudson could decide to pop in and say hello. She never opened a fully closed door, so Sherlock swung John around once they’d gotten inside and slammed the door shut behind him.
“C’we get this bloody thing off now?” he asked, tapping the mask with his thumb. “It’s hurting my nose.”
he was.
All the way there, he was explaining the situation, getting increasingly agitated and nervous about John’s state of consciousness. His eyes were open and occasionally blinking, but he didn’t seem to be taking anything in.
love with it.
Sherlock swallowed. “I’m aware that you were unhappy earlier, and I’ve realised that perhaps my efforts at comforting you were a bit too… Forward. Are you feeling pressured into coming out with me tonight?”
Sherlock’s mind supplied.
John, in his bed, was crying out, desperately short of breath. “Sherlock,” he wheezed, grabbing and shoving wildly. “God, please, Sherlock.”
John rubbed his eyes, confused when a cast hit him in the face. He looked around. “I…” He coughed, and then clutched his middle with a small cry of pain, and then threw up all down his front in quick succession.
Royalty that lived on his own, in a cave, in the cold? Ex-royalty?
“You’re not too old for a halfway house,” Sherlock reminded him.
It's midnight. JW
“Sorry?”
“I can’t,” John wheezed, and he hung his head and started trying to tear his shirt away from his neck. “No, I can’t, I can’t breathe!”
His throat went dry. Why the hell did the attacker have his face?
He stopped. John stared up at him uncertainly. “You’re inside me… with your penis?”
Stationed beside the bed was the drawstring bag John had given him and some of its contents (that, okay, John didn’t miss) lined up in height order against the back wall of the shelter. Fawnlock let John hang back and take it all in, but he sped ahead and into the little pocket of stone to search through the ordered collection until he brought out a slab of stone with something a nasty shade of green dried onto it.
Right?
Once he was certain he couldn’t feel anything to badly broken, he decided to inspect the head. He put the torch back between his knees so the edge of the light just managed to reach the man’s face and combed his fingers through soaking knots of hair. He couldn’t comb his hand through for more than a centimetre at a time but each time he pulled his hand out he was relieved to feel nothing wet that wasn’t water. That being said, he hadn’t checked the back of his head yet.
The detective seemed very vaguely amused. “Tell me, do you have siblings?”
that, anyway?
“Alright, enough of that. This is a hospital, and there are patients here. Calm down, please, or I’m taking you in. D’you hear me?”
“Ch-chickens,” Sherlock said desperately, shaking his head at John. Where the hell had all the words gone?
Sherlock had three lines of his article left to read by the time he heard the muffled thuds of John’s feet on the stairs, but he deliberately paused and took his time. He practically lived for those moments when he heard John’s—ah, there it was, coming up right on cue:
John tried not to let his path differ from his usual walking route, but his leg wasn’t tired at all by the time he’d reached his halfway point, so he decided to enjoy himself and go a little further out. He decided to ignore the thought that reminded him that this was the most adventurous thing he’d done in weeks. In retaliation, he thought perhaps he’d stand a chance of seeing his guest again.
because of alcohol poisoning, thanks – and yet still, when faced with this situation, found she had no idea where to even start looking for her little brother in this cold, dense maze of a hospital. The boy at the desk had told her, “Twenty-seven,” and then pointed off down a corridor labelled “Rooms 101-110”. She’d followed his finger for lack of other instruction, and then used the signs to help with the rest.
John couldn’t believe her. He was lying here, in bloody
“O-of course, Sir,” he said, nodding, before scurrying out the back to call for some more waiters.
“No.”
Once he realised how sad and lonely that sounded he grabbed his coat and let without looking back.
He was quiet for a few seconds. The only reason Sherlock didn’t make an I-told-you-so comment was because he could see that John had an answer. He waited.
“How so?” he asked accusingly. “What did I do? Erections aren’t bad, Sherlock. They’re the complete opposite of bad. Most men strive for erections at every opportunity.”
“Can’t get anything past you, hm?” John said fondly, looking over Sherlock’s features again. He seemed very close, all of a sudden.
“Can you hurry up?” John teased, sliding a hand down over Sherlock’s bum and pulling gently.
John did make it a bit easier, though whether or not he was doing it on purpose was a mystery to Sherlock. He didn’t seem to be having any troubles working out boundaries; he seemed perfectly comfortable. It was almost giving Sherlock the slight confidence boost he needed.
“I’ve changed my mind,” Sherlock said, amused. “I think more people should read your blog. I also think that man has a bit of a crush on you.”
"Of course you did." Sherlock stared at the fingerprints on John's wrist where his sleeve had ridden up. "But I don't mean today. I mean last year when you came in with a sling. It's still sore sometimes but it should have healed months ago. Why?"
John bit his lips to hold back his grin as the waiter reappeared and took their menus with a tiny apology.
“How you knew when to say ‘boy’?”
actually convinced that you’re sorry for kissing me. So start acting like you’re worth more than the fair market value of the chemical constituents of your body, because I would not be here if I didn’t want to be.”
He’d been stripped of his clothes and put in a hospital gown. Sherlock could see a lumpy brace strapped to his left ankle under the thin sheets and a plaster cast wrapped onto his left wrist. He couldn’t see the head injury or any sign of John’s ribs, but he got the sense that John had been pumped full of something delicious.
“… If ye break faith with us who die, we shall not sleep, though poppies grow in Flanders Fields.”
John sniffled for a few minutes. “Stay with me,” he whimpered.
“Because you need it,” Sherlock insisted, and he reached into his black backpack and set a pack of custard creams on his bedside table.
He glanced down at his laptop. Could he be that unprofessional?
“Were we supposed to book?” Sherlock asked, sidling up to him.
Fawnlock nodded and reached up to take off his floral embellishments, but John caught his hand and shook his head.
Sherlock thought. “Alright,” he said, “perhaps this article doesn’t apply to you, but it might apply to other people. You’re always telling me to read up on emotions and learn to manage other people, and, well, this is me reading up.”
John had to force himself to keep going and not stop to turn around and stare. “Generally people use bowling alleys to bowl,” he explained. Once he got to the top of the staircase he tried the door; locked.
For the most part, he stayed quiet. His statement had been taken the night before, so all he was there for was to translate when John was finding something difficult to say or ask a question he hadn’t thought of. Every time he spoke, the lady gave him a disgruntled look. He got the distinct feeling that she didn’t really want him to be there at all, but she could piss right off, because he wasn’t going anywhere.
Sherlock shrugged. “I have no idea. They won’t tell me anything, but I expect a police officer called DI Lestrade will be here soon to talk to you and answer your questions. Either him or a social services representative.”
“Fawnlock,” John breathed, his face cracking into a smile. As far as he could see, Fawnlock wasn’t hurt. Good. That was good. “Door. Open the door.”
John poured the dirty water down the sink and left his cloth to soak in hot water. He’d already packed his kit away. Now he didn’t know what to do. Was he supposed to leave the door open and let it leave when it woke up? Would it rather be put back outside in the rain? With that option came John’s realisation that he hadn’t even taken his own coat off yet. He sighed and peeled back his coats and jumpers, hanging each in its appropriate place as he continued to wonder. In the end, he didn’t do anything. Hopefully it would wake up soon.
“I’m just saying,” Harry said, holding her hands up, “if you walk into any room that has Dad in it and Sherlock is with you, you’re going to end up exactly the same way I did: being called every name in the book and a few more creative combinations besides.”
“Oh, come off it, Jim. Finally you get your chance to scare someone and you try and scare me?”
“Please don’t use that language with me. You’re disrespecting both me and the authorities protecting this patient, and if you don’t step away now, I’m going to have to escort you out of the building.” With his outstretched hand, he took her arm and pushed her back so she was in front of him.
mind. He’d heard of those ridiculous moments before, though, those moments in books where everything just started running so fast that they stopped. He didn’t understand how they worked. How could any mind
John hummed again, thinking this time. “Been on your end. Done… half of this end. Sort of.”
Moran rolled his eyes and landed a hand on John’s back, shoving him forwards. He couldn’t help a smug grin at the flinch he felt go through John’s body on contact. “Just get in, alright?”
The next thing he knew, a grey-haired policeman was hovering over him. “John?”
, and a dirty one at that. “You’re a liar, John, and my friend and I don’t like people who try and lie to us.”
He forced himself to swallow the mouthful he had and then put his plate on the floor. When he turned to Fawnlock again, the poor thing’s eyes were wide with nerves. John smiled sweetly to try and calm him down. As he leant forwards himself, those sharp eyes snapped down to John’s lips, but he didn’t move away when they pressed against his.
It was during the first break that the licks slowed down, and they stopped altogether when the show started again, John turned his head and looked up at Fawnlock with a little smile. He tried not to look too pained from the utter heartache in his chest at how
Both of them turned and looked at the window, simultaneously remembering that it was still only about midday.
“Are you alright now, Watson?” Taller officer again, though his face said he didn’t care for an answer. John just nodded and stood up. “Good.”
“The hell I will!”
So, as requested, she didn’t.
“Piss off, Harry!” he spat suddenly. Both of his companions jumped. “Just fucking
“Please.”
John opened one eye and rolled over, flailing around in the darkness for his phone. Then he rolled his eyes.
It was easy, Sherlock supposed. When they did kidnappings all they had to do was provide a distraction and set a trap. He could tell by the looks on John’s face that his favourite bit was watching the abductor realise he’d lost.
“Right. Which way do you go when they’re bending over?”
“Mine’s closer,” Sherlock reasoned, and he took John’s hand back and pulled him into his bedroom.
“No, you can’t. Partly because we’ve already had this conversation.”
It was no bigger than John himself but infinitely more terrifying. It
want to be a doctor?” Harry frowned, confused. “What?”
And then he came back with a pile of women’s magazines.
“A needle.”
another panic attack, as there was nobody else here and his accompanying officers didn’t look very worried. Just a little bit of a scare? Or maybe they just genuinely didn’t give a shit. Mm, that was comforting.
Sherlock licked his lips and then his teeth behind his lips, apparently slightly uncomfortable with the warm gratitude John was showing in the tiny little gesture. He nodded once, firmly, to himself, and then again at John. “Okay. Good.”
“Wh-what… Who… How…” John tried and failed several times to make a sentence. By the time he’d gathered himself again, Sebastian had settled into his chair at his desk and was grinning at the pair of them. John’s fist ached to feel Moran’s jaw dislocating. Instead, he jerked a finger to his side. “What’s that?”
John, in fact, seemed almost upset when Sherlock’s hands landed hard on his shoulders and shoved him back fiercely. Sherlock stared at him, his expression a comic mock-up of horror and confusion as he looked desperately between John’s eyes, trying to unravel some sort of trick or elaborate ploy. John stared back in confusion and continued to stare as Sherlock glanced down to his crotch, and then back, and then his crotch, and then back again.
Adam nodded slowly. “Alright. But if you want him out at any point, say so. And you have to leave if I request so.”
“Yes,” Sebastian said simply with a curt nod. His arms crossed again.
“He’s not dictating my life,” John argued. Well, he wasn’t now, not from behind those bars. “I just don’t want to be a doctor anymore. I’m capable of making my own decisions, and I’ve changed my mind for my own reasons. What were you planning on being, anyway? Last I heard, you were still working out the best path to becoming a professional mattress-tester.”
“And is the offender in the house now?”
He gave John a moment to adjust to the feeling of another cock laying over his. Only a moment, though, before he snuck his hand between them and wrapped it around John’s, stroking gently.
He tore his gaze from Sherlock’s lips. “Um. I know you’ve answered this already, but I just want to make sure. Can I stay with you for a bit?”
He squeezed John’s hands. “Because I need you to know that you’re a human being who has been treated horribly by another human being, and that there’s no justification for it, and that it wasn’t your fault, and that nobody is ever going to treat you like that again. You’re my best friend, John. My only friend, really. And I’m not going to let you treat yourself like shit just because you believe that’s the way life is supposed to be for you.”
The water cooler was just on the other side of the room, but John still tried to use his time wisely. He practiced one of his old deep breathing exercises until he heard the footsteps approaching again. When he opened his eyes there was a disposable plastic cup of water being offered to him through the bars. It took him an embarrassing two goes to stand up.
He turned his head and took a look around. Yes, definitely an ambulance. There was a man sitting in the seat. Two men, really: one other paramedic and one teacher from school. He had no idea who the man was, but he’d seen him around a few times before. He swallowed and his chest started heaving as his mind wandered again – they were going to find out. His dad was going to kill him. He was going to get taken away. Everyone would
you a kidnapper of some sort, but this isn’t it. We’re going through the park and into the dodgy side, alright?” Sherlock rubbed his thumb over the back of John’s hand.
“Your side, between your ribs.”
After a second of consideration, his practical side won over and he moved his shopping inside while he had the chance. He left the door open and began slowly making his way towards the hall. He briefly pondered over whether or not to step on the creaky floorboard and alert the faun to his presence or—well, actually, no. That sounded like the best plan.
,”she’d have said – Miss Hart, his senior tutor. God, she was so kind to him. “
“John, oh, tight…
“No,” Moran said. Somehow, the gentle syllable still held enough of a threat that John cut himself off, the faded smile slipping from his face. There were a few more seconds of silence.
“What do you want me for?” he asked quickly, his voice as rough as his breathing.
Sherlock’s panic turned into disgust, and then outrage, and then confusion. “It’s a
“No, John.” Sherlock frowned. “You need to stay here so they can fix you and take care of you. I’ll bring you your work if you want.”
, he thought to himself. He’d forgotten his cane again, and not even on purpose this time.
“Your office.”
“Hush, John,” Sherlock whispered. “Just breathe.” He turned back to the policeman. “When will the ambulance be here? He’s got injuries that need attendance.”
John’s hand tightened around his, the sudden voice speaking
The first thing on his list was the library. He had to do some research on this faun thing, and he got the feeling that Google wasn’t entirely the best place for it. He’d need books of myths and legends, not just artwork of fantasies. Next up was the bank, and then the market. He needed money and he needed food. He’d had to throw all of the half-eaten things on the compost.
“And what’s his name?”
With that he turned around and went to the bathroom to change, leaving John a pretty little smile on his way out. As soon as Sherlock was gone John allowed himself a moment of utter idiocy. He leapt from the bed, shooting straight up into the air, and threw up a fist in celebration. Sherlock would have heard anything else – maybe he even heard the light pounding of his feet when he landed back down on the floor – but this was probably safe.
“I really think you’re going to wrong way,” he muttered, shaking his head with an awfully tired look on his face.
John almost scoffed. He hadn’t just
“Warm?” Sherlock had asked amusedly. He’d smoothed down his lapels as he stepped forwards, going for the living room.
“Faun… A faun that picks locks,” he smiled. He looked up at the faun, who was, again, looking at him like he was about to throw up over him. The faun. His key to restarting his life. His kindling. “You can be Faunlock.”
They patted him down in a short frisk search with a little clear plastic bag ready. He assumed it was for the possible contents of his pockets because when nothing was found the bag was tucked back into the arresting officer’s pocket. He must not have been as calm as he felt, because there was a voice next to him telling him to breathe deep and stay calm. He wasn’t sure which direction it was coming from but he was bloody well going to listen to it.
“No, you idiot, I checked my phone when we left the police,” Sherlock scoffed, grinning.
John smiled again. He let his eyes roam the strange little markings over the creature, taking in the little sun-like shapes over his shoulders and the bands down his forearms. He was beautiful. He swallowed hard and held out his hand, edging it towards the faun’s shoulder. It watched his hand the whole time and flinched at the contact, but didn’t make any moves to stop him.
“Already done.”
Sensing that he’d made John uncomfortable, he backed off a bit, gesturing around him. “Are you here to eat, or have you got another case for us?”
“At least the rain has stopped, I suppose,” he mentioned as he stepped outside. Sherlock hummed gently in agreement. “Have you got your poppy on?”
It seemed the word wouldn’t quite come out. Luckily, John was on hand to help. “You meant like an anniversary.”
John flushed bright red. “What? Harry! No, no, I did not
time. And
Sherlock arched a brow, and Harry chuckled. “Yeah, well, I have a nice sideline in specialty acquisitions right now. The contraband market is where it’s at – or, at least, it will be in uni in September.”
The words took John completely by surprise. He’d known what they would be, he always had, but he hadn’t expected his dad to still mean them with so much violence. He’d expected defeat, maybe, or exhaustion, but they were spoken with as much grief and anger as he’d had the first time John had felt his hands on his face.
. John frowned, lifted his head. It couldn’t have meant what he thought it meant.
Sherlock paused. “Sometimes,” he corrected, quickly getting back to work.
He heard Sherlock sigh. "Probably in the morning."
“Where are we going, then? And when?” He made sure Sherlock had closed his drawer before he turned around. He stretched his arms up over his head.
Sherlock thought.
“I said I’m not that unprofessional.”
“No.”
“Let’s get lunch,” he said instead, and he pulled his phone from his pocket. “What do you fancy?”
“Because I wasn’t well.” John raised an eyebrow.
Still, they were crazy to think that John would just admit outright that he was sharing a bed with an impossible myth of a creature.
“I know,” Sherlock said, stroking a hand through his sticky hair. “But you’ll be okay soon. We’re going to get you some help.”
“Have the tagliatelle,” Sherlock suggested. “I didn’t make you run off with me. I just knew you would.”
“Mm,” the officer on duty frowned at him. “Would you like some water? You’d have been due a drink, anyway.”
He’d felt a pang of spite and glared fiercely at him, but as soon as John had held up the Tesco bag he’d mellowed. It hung from his index finger, swinging gently, and John had just stood there staring at him.
John hesitated. He didn’t want to think about it. How could he be expected to agree to this? It was all kinds of fucked up on all kinds of levels, yet still he saw a very clear answer that he’d hate himself for giving.
"Okay," John sighed. "Good."
“Everything okay, John?” Miss Hart asked as he lagged behind, the last one leaving the room. Aside from Sherlock. As usual. “You look a bit pale.”
It was meant to be fixed. He’d fixed it.
“Too fast?” Sherlock immediately pulled back and looked John over, worried.
“John wouldn’t have let you, and he’d have been annoyed at you for trying. This way, the police have their evidence and John has the appropriate situation to bring some sense about.” Mycroft kissed his head softly.
“Not all muggers are teenagers,” came the reminder as John crossed his arms. “That’s just a stereotype.”
, John reminded himself – flinched. John sighed and pointed to his head.
He laughed again, earning another strange look from his visitor, before he tucked into his food. He was finishing off his last bite when it finally came to him. The perfect name.
Moran had been right about one thing; the entire building was empty. It was eerily quiet and he was sure he’d felt a draught on his way out of the courtroom. John had to bite his tongue to refrain from muttering to himself.
He went to find and plug in his USB internet connection, his first search (how did it have signal? He probably needed a new TV – when was his pension coming in again?) being “deer man”, which gave him pages and pages of results on “Deerman” – some legend with the head of a deer and the body of a man. Not quite.
They made it past the door for four seconds before he pushed his way back in again.
Again, Sherlock’s brain stuttered.
have been able to attend a Remembrance Day service in that condition?
“No, John,” Sherlock replied softly.
“I told them I was your boyfriend for two reasons: firstly, so they’d keep me close to you, and secondly, so they’d assume that your father had beaten you up because you were gay. A lie, sure, but it served my purposes. They treat hate crimes a bit differently to how they treat typical abuse, and I wanted them to be very thorough in your case.”
Sherlock swallowed hard. He looked around for inspiration, but none came immediately. Nobody else seemed to be so affected. There were parents holding children to their bodies, the band staring down at their knees with mournful expressions on their faces, couples holding hands.
“I’m sorry for being such a pussy all the time,” John whined, pulling away from Sherlock and scrubbing his face with his hands. “I don’t know why I can’t just fucking
John wanted him to stay, and he stayed. They went down to radiology in the lift, John occasionally coughing up more spots of blood into the oxygen mask, and then crying helplessly about the horrendous pain he was in. The x-ray itself took just a minute for all the pictures they took, and they brought John back to his room before talking to him.
“With Clara,” she replied dismissively. “Jesus Christ, John, are you alright? They wouldn’t let me stay the night. I had no idea what was going on. What happened?”
John, again, didn’t really understand what Sherlock was talking about. He brought him a glass of whisky and put it on the coffee table before taking a seat next to him again, glancing down into his own drink. “Go on, then.”
John gave up and returned his gaze to the ceiling, putting the mask back over his mouth. This peg was getting very annoying. It was all he could do not to fall asleep in the comparatively luxurious comfort of the ambulance.
Lestrade shook his head again. “I can’t allow that. I’m sorry. It’s for the best.”
After a few more minutes John was silent again, much more contained, but Sherlock stayed squeezing him. He couldn’t let go.
"Tripped over."
“Get up, please, Dr. Watson,” the taller one said. John followed the simple instruction, if reluctantly, and soon found himself restrained and being led away again. His wrists were going to bruise badly from all of these bloody brutally tight handcuffs.
Sherlock couldn’t quite form the right words just then. He kept wiping John’s face and stroking his head, desperate to calm him down – and then had a stroke of genius. “But, John, listen to me. Hold on, and listen to me. He told you he loved you.” He chose his words carefully – still, he didn’t believe the man’s words, but John wouldn’t notice. “Maybe he said no
John took his time scrutinising the picture. It was a close-up of the face of a young man. “No.”
John had to stop himself from laughing out loud when as soon as they hit Hackney, a bunch of teenagers got off the bus. Sherlock seemed certain of following them, and once the first knife was pulled on the pair of them and that first sting of adrenaline shot straight from the centre of John’s chest, he had to admit that, yes, this was the best date Sherlock could ever have taken him on.
