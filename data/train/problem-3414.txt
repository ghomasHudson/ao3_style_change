“You’re wrong,” Meg laughs hollowly. “I hung up on her right before I called Cas – er, you. She’s not gonna pick up if she sees my name on the screen. Called her a piece of shit selfish bitch.”
“Fucking Campbell?” Dean says, and it bursts out of his lips because there’s no room for it anymore, not with the surge of sick fear that floods Dean’s chest at the thought of Lieutenant Campbell. Because, sure, Dean had thought he was going to die plenty of times before that alleyway four months ago, but he’d never thought it’d be by being beaten to death by a fucking cop.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Gabriel says with a sly smile, and he steps back, arms upturned in surrender. “Didn’t mean to startle you, bucko.”
Dean laughs weakly and accepts the plate Sam hands him, heading to the table to eat. Sam’s eggs are good – one of the only things the kid knows how to not mess up in the kitchen, and Dean even nibbles on the edge of the turkey stuff.
Sam doesn’t answer Dean’s question. Instead, he keeps rambling full-speed ahead. “And, remember, it’ll be okay – it’ll be fine even if – you know. We’ve still got an appeal if we need it. We could bring it to trial. We could – we could do whatever we need to.”
“There’s a sketch like it in Dad’s journal,” Sam provides. He gets up from the table and returns a moment later with the tattered, leather-bound book in his hands. He spreads it almost immediately to the right page, and the image of the skull in the corner brings it all back. Dean’s been through Dad’s journal, front to back, back to front, so many times that every image, symbol, and note is tattooed in his brain.
“Tell me no, Cas,” Dean says, angling his head so he can kiss below Cas’s jaw, tongue dragging over rough stubble.
“Huh?” Dean lifts his head from Miracle’s fir again. He glances at his alarm clock on the night table. “Shit. Wow.” But then Miracle yips and knocks Dean’s chin with the top of his head, demanding more pets. Who the hell is Dean to deny him that? It’s no telling what kind of rough life the thing’s had; no wonder it’s so clingy.
After breakfast he heads to the shower. He actually washes his hair this time. And he remembers to shave. Takes a pair of clippers to his hair until he looks marginally human again. Then he makes a few extra slices into his left arm with the razor. He starts up on his right arm, too, to make the stinging pain symmetrical. And it’s easier to center himself. Sort of like meditating. Just breath in through his nose, out through his mouth, and cut.
That’s the thing. Dean doesn’t have friends, and he doesn’t have relationships. He has casual acquaintances who turn into casual fucks who turn into regrets. His longest relationship, to date, was three months, with a journalist student named Cassie, and ended with a lot of screaming and broken glass, and that’s not even the one that resulted in Dean’s first restraining order.
Dean thuds his head against the cabinet, skull hitting wood with a dull thunk. “He know where you live?” he asks.
“Dean!” That’s Sammy’s voice. And Sammy’s scared. Sammy’s calling for his big brother. Sammy’s grasping at Dean’s arms. “Dean, stop! Where the fuck are you going? Stop!”
“Hey, man,” Dean says flatly. “If you want to leave, I won’t stop you. You don’t need to make this about me.”
Dean looks in time to see Hogan scoop up Cas like a sack of flour and Hulk smash him so hard on the ground that the floorboards judder.
“I’ll make it up to you,” Dean says over his shoulder. “I’ll let you pick out what I’m wearing tonight.”
Mick and Sam have been coaching him incessantly on how to respond to the questions: take his time, think things through, don’t volunteer extraneous information if a simple
“Fuck you,” Meg tells him, so Dean tries to reassure himself she’s fine – she’s fucking fine – he’s not going to let Cas’s best friend kill herself on his watch.
And he hates not driving. He fucking hates it so much. Because driving’s always been a way to quiet his head and converge on a one-point focus. He can’t stop fidgeting. He jogs his knee, and taps his fingers on his thigh and keeps craning his head over his shoulder to – he doesn’t know. Look for speeding traffic or some shit.
“And Bartholomew will be just the same, I already know it. When I saw the invite, I thought for a moment that it might be a sign of further reconciliation. That maybe Anna was genuinely reaching out. But after speaking with Gabriel, I’m sure they’ve only invited us because they feel they have to. I’m not sure if I can go and withstand their fumbling attempts at casual conversation, acting as if they haven’t cast us out. Worse, if they act like I’m a prodigal son returned home. If they try to
Dean keeps his eyes on the kid until Jack takes his cereal to the table, props his phone up against the salt and pepper shakers, and starts blinking dully at some sort of video. The kid’s brain is going to turn to mush soon if Dean and Cas don’t figure out something to keep him occupied.
“I don’t know,” Cas says again. “It’s possible he will. But, even if he doesn’t, he’s still there. He’s in the sky and the water, the flowers, the rain, the very air we breathe. I don’t think it hurts to still speak to him. At the very least, it might help us.”
“Your attitude doesn’t fucking distress me,” Dean snaps. “You fucking distress me. You ever thought of that, huh? You ever think that maybe you’re the problem here? That maybe there’s something wrong with you?”
“Dean –” Sam hisses, and stalks forward to intercept him, and Dean doesn’t even realize he’s stepping toward Jack until Sam is in the way.
Dean grabs his laptop and he sits on the couch. Cas sits stiffly beside him. Awkwardly, Dean edges a little closer, until their hips touch. He boots up the laptop, opens the disk drive, and slides in the DVD. Cas inches close enough so their shoulders press together. Dean struggles to keep his breath even. It would be easy to lift his arm and sling it around Cas’s shoulder, pull him close, maybe peck him on the lips quick before the end of the opening credits –
Sam doesn’t make another sound, despite the fact that routing around with tweezers probably stings a helluva lot worse than just cleaning the cuts. Dean tosses his little brother a glance to make sure he’s alright. Sam’s jaw is clenched, and he’s looking at something over Dean’s shoulder, obviously fighting with himself to not give away how much it hurts.
Dean fights the growing need to shut his eyes and let himself slip away. He can’t afford to fall asleep. If he falls asleep, anything can happen.
“That sucks,” Dean says, and he means it. Most of the time, he believes that Dad genuinely didn’t know what to do with two little kids. Dad was so mired in his own shit that he couldn’t help but hurt them. Dean doesn’t think any of it was deliberately malicious. “Parents are just…hard, man.”
“And Emma –” Dean stammers, suddenly remembering his daughter, what needs to be the most important part of his life, right now. “If we’re gonna be….you know. Then you gotta be cool with Emma.”
Dean swats haphazardly at Victor, but Sam grabs his wrists and cinches them tight between his fingers.
Sam huffs dramatically and withdraws from the window. Dean watches him cross the room to the kitchen and loudly begin pouring his own bowl of cereal. Dean finishes his cigarette leisurely before following him inside.
“Yeah,” says Sam. He swallows. He brushes Dean’s hair away from his sweaty forehead, being careful not to disturb the bandage. “It’s Sammy.”
“Hey, girl,” Sam says, and Dean fights back a smile. Sam might not be as neurotic about the car as Dean is, but he still loves her, in his own way. After all, she was the one really steady home base they had as kids.
“I just,” Sam says uncomfortably, fidgeting a little in his chair under Dean’s scrutiny. “I mean, I get that the idea of a coparent probably sounds pretty nice right about now, but aren’t you worried that maybe you’re moving things a little fast?”
Petitioner goes first, so Mick stands to make opening statements. Dean tries to pay attention – he tries to stay grounded. He bites his fingernails so tight into his palms, he thinks he might draw blood. Sam keeps sending him worried glances, but Dean ignores him. There’s no way he can face his little brother’s concern, right now, and still come out standing on the other side.
Dean feels wrong-footed and bumbling because he misgendered Hannah at the start of the conversation, who gently corrected him by saying they use they/them pronouns. Dean knows he’s not supposed to take that kind of stuff personally, but he can’t help but be reminded by how much he doesn’t know. He hopes to God no one asks how he identifies; the idea of saying he’s bisexual in front of so many people makes him feel ill. And he’s afraid someone is going to confront him with the pansexual/bisexual debate and he’s not going to be able to defend himself. Or he’ll say something wrong and offend someone else. Or they’ll laugh at him for being, as Charlie calls it, a baby queer.
Cas’s hands land on the collar of Dean’s jacket. He pulls it off Dean’s shoulders with a commanding tug that makes Dean’s stomach curl in on itself. His heart beats so quickly, it aches. His fingers are numb, and he struggles to help Cas with the jacket, tangling the sleeves on his arms in his rush.
“Dude, what do you think I am? I’m not gonna bankrupt you. I’ll let you pay rent just because I know you won’t move in for free. We’ll work something out, I promise.”
Sam doesn’t have time to be disappointed: the blow comes out of nowhere, lands solid at the base of his spine, and Sam stumbles. He catches himself hard against the ground, and his palms sting as they skid across the pavement. He barely has enough time to roll onto his back, so he can face his assailant, before the guy is on him.
Dean beams. He points to the pan of milky roux, “Be my guest. That plate of cheese can go in there.”
“You’re sick, Dean, it happens,” Sam says simply, and Dean can’t gauge his voice. He has no idea if Sam is secretly flipping the fuck out, waiting for the opportune moment to tell Dean how much he screwed up this time, or if he’s genuinely taking this like it’s just a normal bump in the road, like everyone in the world has been sick the way Dean is. “Doctor said it was bacterial pneumonia, probably developed from bronchitis.”
“What are you up to on Tuesday, anyway?” Dean asks. He doesn’t know much about Charlie’s family except for the fact both her parents are dead. He immediately feels guilty about not wondering about it before. He doesn’t want her spending the day alone with her video games, especially now that he knows she and Dorothy are officially kaput after Dorothy just never came back from her cross-country motorcycle trip.
? I make double what she makes at her boring desk job – and people literally pay me because they like me. People
“Fuck,” Nick breathes. Dean hears the rustle of fabric has he frees himself from his boxers. He crowds in close behind Dean, all heavy, warm body and strength. His hot mouth finds Dean’s neck, he plants an open mouth kiss to Dean’s skin; Dean feels the edge of his teeth. Alastair liked to mark him up. Liked to bite his neck and scratch his back and leave bruises where the other inmates and COs could see.
“Can I –” he pushes forward, fingers tingling at the phantom feel of Cas’s skin. But Cas is probably right. And it’s probably late, maybe close to midnight. Dean needs to hurry if he wants to get to the Roadhouse in time. “Can I see you again?”
There’s a familiar itch in the back of Dean’s skull, so he takes out his phone and sends a text to Benny:
“You’re right,” Benny says patiently. Dean marvels at his ability to remain calm in the face of so much teenaged anger. It reminds him a little bit of Sonny. “I’m sorry if I invaded your privacy.”
“Nah, man,” Dean deflects. “Just fair. I’d like to get more into classic restoration,” Dean adds, and immediately wonders why. He doesn’t talk about his aspirations with other people. He doesn’t even talk about that shit with Sam. Dean doesn’t have the luxury of aspirations. He adds the caveat, “But you gotta know the industry for that. Plus, I’d need a course at a trade school, if I want people to take me seriously.”
“Don’t worry, Jacky,” Dean says. “Just because Mommy and Daddy are fighting doesn’t mean we don’t love you anymore.”
Sam tries standing still for the length of time it takes him to count to ten. He gets to nine before he decides to go for a run.
Dean lets his eyes slide away from Sam’s because he’s never done well with eye-contact. It used to bring out all the best
Someone spilled the beans about his past opioid “addiction,” which means they can’t give him the good stuff. The pain in his chest and head stays at a low drone, barely kept at bay by over-the-counter pain relievers.
“No…” Dean murmurs, trying to explain, but the words are out of reach. Everything swirls around him, a tilt-a-whirl of color and sound.
Dean fucking hates running. He always has, even when Dad made him and Sam do it when they were kids for those stupid
There are dark shadows at the edges of his vision. His body feels heavy, like there are weights on top of his chest.
A grin spreads across Dean’s lips, slow and sloppy. He’s too dopey on after-sex-feelings to bother feeling guilty, right now. Cas is warm and loose and heavy on top of him. Kind of like they’re cuddling, or something. And it’s okay. It feels okay.
Of fuck, Dean totally forgot about the barbeque. Shit, he’d totally told Benny the other day he was gonna bring something to that, too. Well, good thing he got groceries.
Charlie nods to the plants. “You’ve heard of a green thumb, right? Well mine are stained red with the blood of all the plants I’ve killed.” She sets the watering can down. She pats her hands dry on her leggings, which are patterned with swirling blue and purple galaxies and speckled stars. “But does that stop me from buying more plants?
“Eileen, ah,” Sam rubs the back of his neck. Dean can tell his brother is trying not to look at Dean, trying to give him the privacy to eat on his own time. “She used to give it to Lillian. When she was sick. It’s easy to get down. Lots of calories. And it’s sweet. It’s chocolate, man.” He finishes, a little desperately.
Dean clumsily drops his arm from his face. His eyes are bloodshot; his pupils dilated from a number of things: the withdrawal, medication, or panic.
Charlie comes out of her own window almost immediately. Dean can see at once that she’s excited – she’s practically vibrating in her fuzzy pink socks and
Dean chuckles and turns the music up. It’s one of his old Zepp tapes, just starting up on “Houses of the Holy.”
“I don’t – I don’t know,” Dean’s throat pinches shut. It takes a moment to work down a swallow. He wipes his palms on his thighs. “I like – I like it when I can make someone else feel good.”
Seven against three, not bad odds, even accounting for Cas’s limited experience fighting as a human. Still, Dean keeps an eye on the former angel in case he gets himself into any tight spots.
Sam digs his phone out of his back pocket and sees he has eight missed texts. Only one is from Eileen; she’s good at not freaking out. It’s something Sam needs, he thinks: a level head. Six are from Jack. One is from Jody, who evidently also had six messages from Jack.
Dean swallows. Charlene knows damn well that Dean doesn’t drink anymore. He talked about AA at mediation. His eyes flick from Charlene’s sickly-sweet smile to Marv, neutral but somehow alert, intense eyes taking in every detail of Dean and the restaurant and the waiter who took their drink orders. And Dean remembers. He recognizes him.
Lydia launches into her own narrative. She’s a lot more collected and articulate than Dean was. She hardly stammers. She doesn’t swerve from her obviously rehearsed story about finding out she was pregnant and assuming it was her fiancés’. It wasn’t until her fiancé called off the wedding that she began to question paternity. She explains how relieved she was that Dean gave up custody, how she’d assumed that would be the end of it and she could begin rebuilding her life with her daughter, and now not understanding why Dean felt the need to reverse his previous decision, as it would only disturb Emma’s life.
“Hey,” Sammy says, and he sounds relieved as well as reassuring. He presses a little harder on Dean’s shoulder. “You’re alright, man.”
“Please, Emma,” Dean tries again, putting a hand on her stomach, rubbing her belly with his thumb. “
“Dean,” Cas begins a little desperately. “We should – we’ll talk, alright? I had a lovely time – and I – I –”
. Does Cas sound disgusted? Or offended? He clearly wanted to have sex with Dean before, but has that changed? Is Dean totally misreading this situation?
He stares at her, entranced. She’s so Goddamn beautiful. With her flush, chubby cheeks and bright eyes. And she – she’s so innocent. So untouched by all the awful stuff Dean’s seen and done. He can’t imagine her growing up and someday asking about his scars, of him having to explain all the horrible shit he’s gone through and done to himself. He doesn’t want to have to tell her those stories.
“Jack’s soul is split,” Amara interrupts. “Part of it still remained after he destroyed the archangel Michael. What exists now is nothing more than a sliver.”
But more than it bothers Dean that Cas isn’t still in bed, it bothers him that Dean slept through Cas getting out of bed. There’s no excuse for Dean to be that out of it. He knows it’s the drugs that drag him into such a deep stupor, and, fuck, sure it’s nice to actually sleep a whole night through every once in a while, but not at the expense of losing this much of an edge.
Cas smiles; Dean can feel the tug of his cheek against his bare chest, “I think it’s worth it, regardless.”
. I hang out with their headstones for a little while. Read ‘em a couple of my favorite chapters from
Dean pulls away and gives Cas a swift smile. Then he swings himself on the banister and races down the stairs, feet clunking on the metal.
Emma is immediately enamored by Bobby’s scratchy beard and soft lap. Dean doesn’t blame her. He may have grown out of sitting on the old man’s lap not long after they first met, but he has a few fond memories of curling up on Bobby’s knee while the old man read to him from large, colorful picture books, surrounded by the smell of motor oil and cigar smoke.
“Now,” it continues, taking a step forward. “Are you two going to be good little sleepers and go back to bed. Or will I have to send you back myself?”
“Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam,” Dean says nonsensically and paws at Sam’s arm. Throat tight. High-pitched shrieking in his ears. “Sammy.”
“It’s a social disease, see?” Ash says philosophically, and tosses his other arm around Sam’s shoulder, tugs him tight against his side, and the three of them walk abreast down the sidewalk. Sam’s close enough that he can smell the trace of marijuana on the guy’s breath. “It’s the system’s at fault, not us. It’s all about wealth, you know? It ain’t distributed fair. So, we end up at the bottom of the barrel. Barrel full ‘o rotten apples.”
“Alright,” says Sam, getting up and taking Dean’s elbow again, in a way that tells Dean he isn’t going to let him pull away. “Let’s go.”
“Oh,” Dean says. He can’t say anything else for a long time. His throat is dry. “Well then, ah,” Dean clears his throat. He thinks about empty motel rooms, pitching pills into his palm, choking on whiskey. “I’m glad you met her, then.”
“Dean!” Jack turns at the sound of Dean in the doorway. He beams. He looks relieved, and a little wary.
She winds her fingers around his hand and pulls it away from his face; Sam lets her, even though it just increases his embarrassment by tenfold.
Eileen is closest to the door, so she shrugs and checks the peephole. “It’s a man with shaggy hair and messy clothes,” she announces.
She pulls him past his door and to her own. She kicks it open, and then they’re inside her apartment.
So, tiny and insignificant point: it always bugs me how - in the multiple times the boys or someone around them has stopped breathing, Dean or Sam never break out the CPR. Like you gonna tell me these guys don't know basic first aid? They know how to tie sutures with dental floss, but they don't know how to perform rescue breathing? (Yes, I do understand that it's difficult to film realistic-looking CPR when you're acting with real people...it's just something that always bothers me lol.)
And that sure as hell isn’t anything Dean ever thought would come out of his mouth. But sure. Sure. If Amelia kept Sammy sane. Kept Sammy
Dean tries not to freak out. He really tries – but he’s making it worse. Dean’s making it worse, and he doesn’t know what to do – he is near tears, and losing it is going to do shit for this situation. This is not about Dean, right now. This is about Cas. Focus on Cas.
, but he still doesn’t like it when people ask. It’s not like he can casually go back inside and change, though.
“We should probably keep an eye on him for a little while,” Sam says heavily. “I could move back in –”
This Dean ended up becoming very close to my heart. In some ways, I feel like I understand, know, and love him better then the version on the show. That’s what I love about fandom: it grows until it’s big enough for each of us to chip off pieces of it to hold close. I’ve loved every moment of writing Dean’s journey through this fic. And I’ve loved being able to share him with you. I cannot tell you how much I treasure each comment, kudo, and bookmark. I adore you, my sweet, beautiful readers. Thank you for taking the time to read this ridiculous behemoth of a story. Thank you for letting me share my little obsession with you all. Thank you for the kind words and messages and shares and recs. Thank you for following Dean’s story and squeeing at me at all the right moments. Thank you for loving this version of Dean. Thank you for keeping up with this story over all these weeks. I can’t say it enough. Thank you thank you thank you.
Dean thinks a little wildly, and the twist of arousal in the pit of his stomach is so harsh it’s almost a cramp.
It’s a pretty day out: clear blue sky and warm. The kind of day that would have ended up with Dean and Micah on a blanket in the yard, playing fetch with Mir, waiting for the bus to drop Ella off after her second week of school. Maybe grilling up the chicken in the fridge when Cas got home from work.
His daughter is what’s important. So, it shouldn’t matter that Cas doesn’t like or want kids. It doesn’t matter because Dean doesn’t need Cas. He needs his daughter. And that’s fine. Dean’s fucking fine.
“What?” she laughs, a little mystified. And Castiel knows it’s a bad habit of his: jumping into the middle of conversations he’s only been having with himself.
Dean’s ultimately glad Cas talked him into taking the meds. The pain has faded to a manageable ache, and, although he’s still a little dizzy, he doesn’t feel as loopy as he was afraid he’d be. He’s still not up for his crutches, so Cas unloads his wheelchair and helps him into it, Miracle trotting beside them, a little hyper to be in a new place, but Dean lets him take a few laps around the car to burn off his excess energy because he’s been such a patient boy during the ride.
“It’s the first letter of your name, plus a word with a strong association to you. Sam, for instance, is ‘S’,” with her right hand, Eileen makes a fist with her thumb on the outside, and then she puts both hands, her left outstretched, against her temples, then she moves both hands up and away from her head in a curve, “and the sign for moose.”
“It was – it was a lot of everything at once.” Dean cuffs his hands on his pants. He swallows again. The lump won’t go down. He hopes to God he’s not gonna spew all over Billie’s office carpet. “Some stuff that I hadn’t remembered before was suddenly – right there.”
“I miss you,” Dean whispers. “God I – I sometimes fucking hate you for dying, you know that? I fucking hate you for leaving us. For leaving us with fucking Dad. For screwing us over so bad.”
“I do not understand why you’re telling me this,” Cas says. He wonders if the men can see the fear in his eyes. If they can somehow reach inside his head and pluck apart the memory of Dean plunging his knife into Michael’s heart.
Bobby looks pained. Dean knows he’s put him in a rotten position: pulled between his obligation as a boss and his fondness for Dean. But Dean really needs this job. And he really needs to stay full-time. Because he needs the health insurance if he wants to afford his drugs and sessions with Victor and Pam. And he needs the steady income for even the slimmest chance that a judge –
Cas laughs harder. And now Sam’s laughing, and Junior starts shrieking, delighted, from his ring of stuffed animals. Dean’s chest aches so hard he’s momentarily afraid he’s going to have a heart attack, but he’s laughing, too. Micah giggles quietly. Ella smiles widely and shakes the frizzy pigtails Cas spent twenty-minutes putting in this morning.
Dean turns his face back toward Cas. Cas’s face is close. He’s so – so – and Dean doesn’t want to mess this up. He doesn’t want to make another stupid mistake. “M…sorry…Cas,” Dean whispers.
“I –” Dean runs a hand through his hair, trying to conceal the fine tremble in his fingers, trying to come up with some kind of explanation. “I fucking quit, man. Sorry – I’m not – I’m not supposed to be here.”
Sam’s smile is swift but fleeting. “No problem,” he says. And then he’s back to looking like a kicked puppy.
Dean spares a glance to Cas, but he’s still got vamps number one and two plenty occupied, leaving three for Dean. Dean can’t see Sam fighting behind him, but he can hear steady grunts and gasps that means his brother’s keeping vamps six and seven on their toes.
“Good luck, baby,” Shaylene calls after him sweetly, but Dean doesn’t fool himself into thinking she’s anything but glad to see the back of his head.
“I ever tell you Karen had a miscarriage?” Bobby says abruptly. Dean can count on one hand the number of times Bobby’s brought up his first wife. Dean stares at Bobby, but Bobby’s looking intently to Emma, who Ellen’s stolen from Sam to bring her over to pick daffodils. Poor kid’s being passed around like a hot potato.
“What?” Dean says, alarmed, looking over his shoulder because Cas is staring at the refrigerator as if it’s about to launch an attack.
“Dunno, Doc. Ain’t that what I’m paying you for?” Dean says. He doesn’t really want to be here, right now. Despite Sam pouring fluids into him all yesterday evening and this morning, Dean’s still got one mother of a headache, and the fluorescent bulbs in Victor’s ceiling don’t help.
Dean knows he cleans up well. His suit’s cheap, but it fits him like a glove. He won’t be the most well-dressed guy there, but at least he won’t be shabby. That’s until he comes out of the bathroom, tucking the bottom of his tie into his pants, and sees Cas.
Benny stops at the benches and drops onto the seat. He blows out a slow breath, probably easing his way through some kind of ache leftover from the scuffle. His eyes fall on Jo. “I thought I told you to get out of here,” he tells her with a frown.
, Dad’s voice echoes in Dean’s head, which is ironic; Dean’s fairly certain Dad would have thought the very act of taking meds meant Dean was a pussy.
It’s called jitterbugging, and Dean’s damn good at it. He can Lindy Hop, jive, and swing like the best of them, and it makes the ladies swoon even if Benny and the other guys might make fun of him for it.
“Fuck out a’ here!” Campbell orders, throwing a finger to the gate on the other side of the playground.
Sam said. We’ve talked for so long about what happens when it’s all over. And – I want to try that out, for once. Get my bearings with Eileen. Try to level out or something.
“If you don’t want me working on the cars, I can help in the office,” Dean says. He sounds desperate. He know he sounds desperate; but it’s the not-keeping-busy that kills him sometimes. He needs to work, even if he’s doing a shit job.
Sam’s eyes dart from the bed, which holds Dean’s bags, back to Dean’s face, and his eyes darken. He crosses his arms over his chest.
“Dean,” Cas says calmly. His hand squeezes Dean’s elbow. Dean snatches ahold of Cas’s fingers. He’s not there, he tries to remind himself. He’s not in prison anymore. “I’m here. You’re safe, Dean.”
“Dude!” Charlie crows. She’s out of her window and squeezing Dean a tight hello before he can blink. “You’re back!”
felt so much more personal. He’d been a little freaked out by it, but, surprisingly, the staggering warmth and joy to the sound, an unerring
Dean’s throat closes up with panic. He doesn’t know how he’s supposed to answer that. He can’t remember if he knew right away that Shay was a hooker, or if it’s something that became apparent after they got to her room. Either way, it doesn’t sound great, and he’s still not sure whether he can get Shay into trouble if he says too much.
Cas shrugs. He drives like a grandma, which further conflicts with his flashy car. A chorus of horns, shouts, and wolf-whistles follow them through the city streets. “It was close to Gabriel. And far enough from home.”
“Ow, Bobby! Fuck!” Dean says on a gasp as his broken ribs stutter with hot, nauseating pain under Bobby’s prodding fingers.
Dean takes a deep breath. Cas tries to ignore how it trembles slightly. Sam had remarked in the hospital how strange it was that Dean was crying so often. But it didn’t seem strange to Cas. After all, Cas suspected that Dean cried much more often in front of Cas than he allowed himself to cry in front of Sam.
Dean intuitively puts his free arm over his daughter’s head, turning his body away from the open door and hunching over to protect her from whoever broke into his apartment –
“Honor?” Castiel demands, anger flaring back to life in his chest, and he is glad of it. Glad of any flame, no matter how small, that might eclipse the monstrous, black pit that threatens to consume him from the inside out as Anna continues to scream at him. “There was no honor in the way Michael lived. And no honor in the way he died. No honor in his game between Angels and Hunters. Their life is one of lies and shadows and betrayal. Did Luca tell you, Anna? Did Luca tell you how Michael stabbed the other boy in the back?”
It’s the first time he’s seen Meg since his and Cas’s ill-fated hookup. Dean has no idea how her opinion of him has shifted, more than a month and a half later. He also can’t help but register that Meg and him are alike now, in that they’ve both slept with Cas, and he wonders whether anyone else at the party has also done that. Maybe Cas makes a habit of befriending his exes.
“I don’t really know,” Dean says helplessly. “He knows I can’t be in a relationship, right now. But he still wants to be friends. So, yeah, that’s what we are.”
, Dad says, but it turns into someone else’s purr. Someone Dean can’t put a name to, and Dean shudders. It’s hard to swallow, and he trembles a little as he climbs in the shower and washes it all off.
Minimal amounts of caffeine are fine when Dean feels stable – but tumbling headfirst into a depressive episode like he is now, chugging caffeine could mean pinwheeling back toward mania. Dean shouldn’t risk that.
“That’s it, Dean,” Tessa coaches him, hands still holding his head in place. “That’s it. Calm down.”
The tank with Smeagol the gecko is right next to his face. Dean finds the lizard staring at him; it licks one of its black eyes.
It’s Friday. He survived a week on his own. And he made a new friend who doesn’t care that he’s crazy.
“I believe it’s called a panic attack,” Cas says. And no shit, because it’s not like Dean’s never had them before. But why the fuck is it happening now? When Dean is literally an immobile lump in bed.
“Cas, I – I need –” Dean says tremulously, breathes in Cas’s shirt. Just breathes. Feels Cas’s chest against his.
“Dean,” Sam says slowly, throat thick. He clasps his hand over Dean’s, tries to ply his fingers loose. “It’s going to be alright. I promise.”
Sam looks so ridiculously like he did when he was a toddler that Dean feels a pang of hurt in the center of his chest. Sam used to hug this stupid stuffed dog in bed all the time, carried it everywhere he went, cried himself sick when Dean accidentally forgot it at one of their motels.
Dean shuts his eyes at the horrifying memory of Lieutenant Campbell’s boots slamming again and again into his chest until his ribs and clavicle shattered under the impact, and, unbidden, Cas’s bruised and bloodied face swims to the forefront of Dean’s mind.
The temazepam puts him out swiftly and effectively. He wakes up groggy in the morning to Sam shaking his shoulder and telling him they have to go to his appointment with Victor.
There’s a minor disaster when the lid of Emma’s sippy cup unscrews, dousing Dean’s sleeve in milk. Dean tries to shake the worst of it off, but Emma’s grabbing for her cup, so Dean doesn’t have a lot of choice but to ignore the spill for now in favor of getting Emma her drink. Cas grabs a fistful of napkins and dabs at Dean’s arm for him, frantically trying to stop the spread of the liquid.
“You’re not back in an hour, I’m coming after you,” Sam warns. His chest hurts. He’s making a mistake, he knows it. He can fucking feel it aching in his body.
Jo purses her lips, seems to be calculating her odds between Dean and Campbell and decides she’s better with Dean. “Right, Deano,” she growls through her teeth.
But, finally, it’s over. The plane wheels to a stop, attaches to the gangway, and a flight attendant tells them over the speaker that she hopes they had a good flight, best wishes in Boston.
By then, it’s time for Dean to catch the bus if he doesn’t want to be late meeting Sam for breakfast, so he pats himself on the back for a conversation well-eluded, and he sticks a Post-It next to Cas on the bed:
But Jody doesn’t respond like it’s ridiculous. Instead, she goes deadly serious. “Sam, I’ve seen Dean when he drinks too much. What really happened?”
– is just some prison bitch. Fucking shit. What shit awful person he is for bringing this up on today, of all days, when she’s already raw from digging through her dead parents’ detritus.
“As much as I like the idea of you finally gettin’ laid,” Dean starts, “no way no how am I gonna let you get lucky with fucking Ruby.”
“I’m Layla,” she replies. She’s got a tube in her chest, running under her hospital gown, and just as many wires as Dean’s got on her arms. She’s also got a white bandage wound around the top of her head, and there’s a wire snaking up her neck, disappearing behind the back of her skull.
“No,” Dean breathes. It’s surprisingly hard to speak. It’s been a while since he’s tried. It’s like all the words are carrying miniature barbells. “No…doctors.”
“I cannot believe you!” Charlie climbs through Dean’s window, face as red as her hair and eyes flashing. “You – you absolute traitor! Dean –” she stammers. “What’s your middle name?”
“Postoperative pneumonia,” Layla supplies the answer to the question Dean didn’t get around to asking. She waves a clumsy hand to the bandage around her head. “What about you?”
, he tells himself. For fuck’s sake, he’s lived with it for four years already. He shouldn’t be taken down by it now. Pony up, golden boy. He’s got a job to get to. He’s got a daughter to provide for. He’s got a fucking
, man,” Dean turns to him, gaping. Cas smiles softly at him, looking so kind and soft and sweet – he’s beautiful. He’s the one who’s beautiful. If Dean could paint the way Cas can paint, he’d only ever need one model in his life.
Dean sets the mug down on the floor next to the pillow. It rattles a little against the linoleum from the shake in his fingers.
Lydia is already there with Bevell, sitting on one side of a gargantuan, glossy oak table. Dean’s grateful to see Charlene stayed home. And his heart sinks at the fact that Emma’s also nowhere to be seen – it’s not like he expected otherwise. He’s sure there’s logic to keeping the child out of the way in case the decision makes one of the parents upset.
It only makes Dean laugh harder, until he’s brushing tears away with his thumbs. Eileen’s eyes shine. Her face turns red. Her lips tremble. And then she’s laughing, too, bent double, clutching at the impala’s door to keep herself upright.
. He wants to ask what he said, but he also doesn’t really want to know in case it was something too mortifying.
“You didn’t do anything,” Dean snaps. “Don’t apologize.” He tosses his legs over the side of the bed, acutely aware that he is still naked from the waist down. He makes an effort to get his voice back under control. “I gotta piss. Where’s your bathroom?”
Dean shakes his head frantically. He swallows a couple times and finally forces his voice to come back up. “I-I’m okay. Can’t – not supposed to be alone, right now.” He gulps. His throat hurts; there’s a vice squeezing tight around his neck.
“Gee, thanks,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “Just had a late night, is all.”  Because there’s no way in hell he’s going to tell Sam that he mixed too many drugs and slept with – but not
Dean wants to sleep again. Maybe when he next wakes up the strange film covering everything will disappear. He tries blinking his eyes. Maybe there’s something wrong with his vision. Maybe he can just shake it loose.
“Dean –” he nearly trips over Miracle, and he spins wildly to keep his footing. “Dean, is it true – is it true – Jack!”
There’s a cheap motel up ahead. Dean doesn’t know how long he’s been driving. It’s getting dark. The sun sinks below the tips of the pine trees that line the road. There are only a few other cars in the parking lot.
“It’s alright for you to say no to me, Dean,” Cas says, and he sounds almost frustrated. So shit. Dammit. Dean should have just said yes. And Cas doesn’t take Dean’s hand.
Sam pushes his hair out of his face. His eyes look a little wild. “I – yeah. Sorry I have to cut and run, Dean. And I’d – I’d tell you, but –”
He thinks about what Meg told him: pull his big boy pants up and talk it out. Dean doesn’t know how to do that.
Dean trips on the last step down to the war room. His legs are strangely numb. It feels a little like he’s floating, and he pauses for a second to take a swig from the bottle of whiskey in his hand and –
Sequel (“surely heaven waits”) is in the works! It's seven chapters long. I'll likely start posting in April, so make sure you subscribe to me as an author if you'd like to be kept updated.
Sam huffs out a laugh, then picks up a slice, stuffs it into his mouth, and doesn’t actually look like he’s going to throw up again, so that’s a plus.
He remembers waking up between the whiskey hazes back when he came out of Hell. He remembers puking early in the morning and hoping that Sam wouldn’t wake up. No way could he have told Sam the truth of it; the halted and stuttering sentences he clawed his way through were already too much.
Claire watches him for a long moment, peering carefully through her mascara-caked lashes. Dean knows she’s measuring his worth as a father in a way only a fatherless kid can. “Good,” she says finally.
Dean smiles again. He closes his eyes; he can probably manage a cat nap before Missouri returns with her promised Jello.
Cas knows Sam wanted to keep Jack away, in an effort to preserve Dean’s dignity, but Cas very much doubts Dean’s going to remember much of this. And Cas understands the helplessness of wanting to be of use but having nothing to do.
“Yeah? Well fuck you,” Dean’s neighbor says. It’s easier to hear her through the window than it is through the wall. “Do the world a favor and put your dick in a blender.” Then there’s the distinct slap of skin against something solid, the roll of a computer chair against the hard floor and, alarmingly, the neighbor’s window slides open, and out comes the neighbor, herself.
“She’s my daughter, Dean,” Lydia corrects him. “She’s not gonna mess up my day. If she needs me, she needs me.”
“Here,” Dean says again, putting a handful of assorted candy on the stair next to Cas. “I stole some before Gabe can eat it all.”
And, because Cas has always been harder to lie to than Sammy, Dean squares his jaw, takes a deep breath, and just says it before he can stop himself, “I’m sorry.”
And the fear erupts so immediately, it’s an unstoppable freight train inside his body; he shoves himself away from Cas’s reaching fingers like it’s a knifepoint.
“No,” Lydia says, almost sternly. She tugs her hand away from her face, and she looks a little pissed off but also earnest. “I don’t feel like you hurt me, Dean. It was – it was a stupid decision, okay? With life-altering consequences. But I don’t think you took advantage of me.” She looks at him carefully. “Do you think
A small voice reminds him that Charlie hasn’t actually seen him crazy yet, but Dean shoves it away. If things keep going the way the are – minus the whole cigarette thing this evening – maybe Charlie won’t ever have to see him when it gets bad.
“Oof,” Charlie says, bending her legs at the knees and staring at the ceiling. “I guess this means I’m supposed to dig out the plates.”
. And he isn’t even trying to be passive aggressive, or anything; he genuinely does crawl into bed as soon as he eats what passes for dinner.
What the fuck is wrong with him? Dean’s mouth is dry. He’s halfway hard in his pants; dick tight against the fly of his jeans.
Charlie’s driving her very yellow AMC Gremlin, and Dean’s on his phone to try to distract himself from the nausea-inducing jitters in his belly.
The water bubbles over and lands on the stove with a hiss. Jack leaps back in surprise, and Dean laughs at the startled look on his face before he moves to take the pot off the range. On his way to grab the box of macaroni, he snags a napkin out of the holder Cas bought from a farmer’s market; it’s in the shape of a bear and the kids have christened it “Grumpy”; Dean has no idea why.
Dean laughs a little wildly, runs a hand through his hair; it’s straw-like from sweat. In fact, his entire body feels stale. His t-shirt is crispy under the arms from dried perspiration and his face is itchy from crying.
Charlie’s hand finds his, and she squeezes his fingers tight. “I can see it. Your brother sees it. And the judge will see it to. It’s gonna be okay, Dean.”
“This is Hunter turf, Nova,” Benny snaps, his face is getting red. Sam’s seen Benny mad plenty of times: it’s a little bit like a charging rhinoceros, and Sam hopes to God the Angels have enough sense to get out while they’ve still got the chance.
Work. Right. Shit, Dean forgot about work. He checks his phone and sees that he’s got another hour before he has to scram. Fuck. Shit. He glances over at Meg, who’s definitely settled down, and staring at him with raised eyebrows.
Dean takes it on reflex. His hands are shaking too hard to hold the cup, so Sam presses it to his lips for him. Dean manages to take a couple sips before he chokes again and ducks his face into the pillow.
“You’re fucking crazy,” Dean tells him angrily. He walks toward the end of the aisle. He stops in the front pew, closes his fist around the back of the seat. Cas can see his shoulders heaving as he attempts to regain control of his breathing.
Bobby’s got his old med kit bisected on his table, full of surplus, circa 1940 army supplies. Next to the kit is Bobby’s SAA. Bobby’d answered the door with it drawn, and he’s kept it on hand ever since Dean told him what happened.
There’s no time to think. Cas reacts on pure, hungry impulse. He opens his mouth to allow access to Dean’s searching tongue, and he presses hard against Dean’s mouth in answer to Dean’s force. It isn’t neat – it’s messy and frantic, all teeth and too much saliva.
There are seven pairs of eyes on Dean. It’s suddenly like there’s not enough air in the room. His default is to find somewhere small where he can hide, but in lieu of that, Dean fixes his eyes on a weird abstract painting of blue and gray blocks so he doesn’t accidentally meet anyone’s eyes.
Cas’s fingers drop Dean’s hands. Instead, he takes hold of Dean’s face again, one palm on each of his cheeks, and stills Dean’s shaking head.
Sam moves to follow, but Ellen turns on him. “And you sit your ass down, Sam, or I’ll do it for you.”
Dean crutches across the floor, presses his finger against the screen, and tells Sam, “Hold up. Imma put you speaker.” Dean places the phone on the table and deftly steadies the jug so there isn’t an early morning mess. Miracle looks up briefly from where he’s stationed himself under Micah’s chair, ready for the cleanup brigade.
” Sam bites. But he realizes he’s still got his sleeve against his nose and he pulls it away tentatively. The bleeding’s stopped. He takes an experimental sniff, and it doesn’t hurt too bad, even if it's plugged up with dried blood.
Dean feels cold. He’s aware that he’s shaking, but it’s a distant sort of realization. Like he’s floating a couple inches above his body, just observing the jolts of energy traveling through his veins.
Bobby keeps up a steady stream of quiet commentary, almost like he’s talking himself through it rather than Sam. “I think it missed his lung. No bone fragments, so it must ‘a gone under his ribs. If it got his stomach, we’d know.”
“M okay,” Dean says, part embarrassed, part subdued, and that’s how Cas knows that it’s mostly true: if Dean had snapped
It takes a tortuously long time to reach Dean’s floor, and even longer to convince Emma that she needs to stop climbing. Dean’s sweating and back is aching from bending over by the time he’s got her on his hip again and they’re finally stepping into his apartment.
The change in position makes a bolt of pain rocket through his chest, and Dean gasps, takes a minute to catch his breath again. Cas waits patiently before he pulls him forward once again. Together, they walk gingerly to Cas’s truck. Cas helps Dean climb into the cab. Then Cas shuts the door for him. Leaves to go around the front and climb into the driver’s seat.
He placed his hand over Ella's heart, and he could feel the steady beat of her pulse under his palm.
Which Dean immediately ignores: “Get your fucking hands off my brother!” Cas’s hand catches Dean’s wrist as Dean lunges forward.
“Meg often tells me I let people too close to me too quickly,” Cas says. “It can make casual encounters awkward. I’m not good at reading social cues.”
“We have to go after him,” Dean says. His throat is tight. Closing in on him. Everything is closing in on him. Sammy is missing. Sammy is dead. Sammy can’t be dead.
“Least we could do, you dad, you,” Charlie replies, tugging Dean into a quick hug before stooping to boop Emma on the nose with her finger. Emma smiles wide and does a little happy wiggle that means she might need a diaper change. Yeah, clean up starts after the fun walks out.
After work seems like a great time to scope out some of the local gyms. Dean’s been meaning to find a new place; it’s been a few weeks now since he’s had access to the one in Sam’s building, and he should really get back to weight training again. He ends up at the local Y and has a brief moment of panic where he thinks about Lisa before remembering that she and Ben moved to Cicero.
Dean’s been in some pretty shit situations, but he still doesn’t think there’s anything more terrifying than trying to convince someone you’re not crazy when that’s exactly what they already believe you to be. It sends chills shooting down his entire body. His stomach clenches. A high wine of panic starts up in the back of his head.
“Everything’s fine,” Sam says on a hard exhale. And it’s not. Dean knows immediately that it’s not. “Everything – really, Dean. Everything’s okay. It’s just – it’s something I need to talk – I need to show you in person, okay?” Sam sounds wrong. His nose is all stuffed up, like he’s been crying.
, Dean thinks, what a stupid-sounding name. Like something in a song, maybe. Or like one of those Latin prayers the priests would mumble when Sam and Dean got dragged to church once in a blue moon if Dad was sober enough to care.
Lately, he’s been thinking about other ways he could get high. Because the deal technically only extended to Dean staying away from booze, even though he knows Sam and Cas would quickly call him on bullshit if he tried anything else.
Everyone smokes in hospitals; it’s one of the only ways the aides let you out of the building. Dean’s feeling well enough that he doesn’t need to crash immediately back into bed, so he takes one of the smokes being handed out at the door and heads into the garden.
is Hell!” Cas interrupts her, and he threads his fingers through his hair like he’s seen Dean do. He pulls hard enough to hurt. “This city around us! The death and the violence and the pain around us, Anna, don’t you see? I have found some semblance of refuge – how can you ask me to give it up?”
Cas is beginning to understand Dean’s idiosyncrasies, the nonverbal and verbal cues for how he translates his emotions. There’s still much to learn, but, as he keeps reminding Dean, they have time.
He sits up on his heels to shuck his shirt, tosses it somewhere in the dark corner of the room. Doesn’t think. Don’t fucking think.
“Cause asking you to go to his art show sounds like a date, Dean,” Sam says seriously. “I thought you weren’t going to be seeing anyone for a while.”
And dammit. Dammit, Dean. Because it’s not supposed to end like this. It isn’t supposed to end at all, not anymore. Not for a good long while yet.
Sam sighs, crumples up Eileen’s note and tosses it in the trash. Then he heads into the bedroom to grab his laptop. He brings it back out and sets it up on the kitchen island, pulls up a stool, because they don’t have room for a dining room table.
Dean shrugs. “Then you send a monthly check and see the kid on weekends. Come on, Sammy,” Dean shoves Sam’s shoulder again. “Trust me. You look so pathetic right now, Eileen won’t be able to resist you.”
And Dean is, he thinks almost angrily. He’s fine. He’s sober, at least. Strangely the thought just manages to crest another wave of despair in his chest. Fucking sober. Great.
It takes Sam longer to leave the party than Dean. Dean waits for Sam in the passenger seat and shuts his eyes, feeling like a kid waiting for the other grownups to stop talking. He fucking hates not having his car. He fucking hates getting hauled around by his soccer mom little brother. He fucking hates not having his own life.
“I’m sorry,” Sam clarifies. His voice is heavy. He’s staring straight ahead at the diner wall, eyes tracking the stack of flattened cardboard boxes sitting on top of a green barrel. “I should have just let you be. I didn’t mean to fight.”
said Dean, own heart beating too-fast. Of course. Of course, Dean wasn’t the only one who still got nightmares.
He waits for the echoes of the nightmare to fade, trying to catch his breath, before he realizes that he can still hear Dean screaming.
“Okay, Sam. We just wanna get a picture. As it is now, your brother looks like he just gave himself a nasty concussion. He should be okay. And the doctor’ll be here in a minute to talk about his psychiatric treatment options.”
crazy.” And Dean knows she’s going to back away, now. This is the part where people go all polite, start hedging, start talking about how they’re too busy to hang out anymore. Charlie adds, tiny wrinkle of concern on the bridge of her nose, “Does that mean you don’t want brownies?”
Sonny’s home was residential placement. Dean was there for two months after he got caught stealing groceries when he was sixteen. Sonny was a good guy, and it might be strange, but Dean views his time there with more fondness than he does most of his youth. It was a space of stability and support, somewhere that Dean didn’t have to constantly worry about how he was gonna feed himself or Sammy or if there’d be enough money to stay in the motel another night. Sonny was the first one who found out about the cutting. Dean would have stuck around if it wasn’t for the fact it meant leaving Sam alone with Dad.
Dad said roughly, offering a hand up. You let ‘em think you’re weak – you let ‘em think you’re a coward – and you’ll never win. Gotta fight and gotta fight hard if you ever wanna win anything in this Godforsaken life, Deano.
Pam snorts. “Take the rest of the day off, okay, kiddo?” she suggests gently. “Obviously you don’t actually need to do anything I say, but, for what it’s worth, I think you’ve earned a little downtime.”
“That’s a relief,” Cas continues, just as crisply. “I hope you enjoy. Please feel free to return the mug whenever you are able. I’m exactly below you. 3A.”
Dinner is messy, as usual with a toddler. Emma spots the container of mayo in the cooler and wines until Dean gives her a tiny spoonful so she can dip her turkey in it. It mostly ends up around her mouth instead of in it, and she wipes her fingers on her strawberry-patterned shorts before Cas can get to her with a napkin.
plenty of girls, and the girl he went with to the Sadie Hawkins dance let him put his hand under her bra, but he’s never gone
. So, Sam tried not to wince as Cas told the doctor how Dean had woken up in the middle of the night to find a knife, had told Cas that he wanted to die, was having trouble distinguishing between what was real and wasn’t real, was apparently hearing and seeing things that didn’t exist, and now had stopped responding to anything whatsoever.
Sam sees his big brother take two steps forward. Sees Michael barely lift a hand to stop him. Sees Dean plow the knife into Michael’s chest.
Cas was dead. Cas was gone. Cas cried and smiled through his last words to Dean, and Dean just watched dumbly as Cas was consumed and tugged away.
Ten hours and forty-five minutes according to the chirpy voice on Sam’s phone. Dean made it in nine on the way to the shore of Lake Superior. Nearly a straight shot on I-80 West from Duluth back to Lebanon.
He’s surrounded with his family. They’re safe. They’re home. And Dean doesn’t think there is one more thing he could want in this moment.
Before he can think better of it, Cas gets up from the library table and walks down the hallway to Dean’s room. He knocks, and tries to ignore the pulse of panic in his stomach as he waits for Dean to reply. Part of him will never forget the heart-stopping moment of coming into that motel room with Sam to find Dean unresponsive on the bed.
Who the fuck is reading his mind? There’s nothing there. It’s fine. There’s no one in Dean’s apartment except for him.
“Okay, Sammy,” Dean says. There’s something in his throat that stops him from breathing. He turns his head, puts one side of his face against the headboard. He doesn’t want to look at Sammy. Or at the fucking ice cream.
He can hear the creak of leather under Billie as she shifts her position – hear the – hear the wind batter fitfully against the window – hear – hear his heart and – hear Alastair as he grunts –
, said Dean again, because what Sam meant to say was it’s you. I feel like you’re strangling me, Dean.
“Neutral territory….” Castiel feels the words around in his mouth like he’s tasting them. And then, slowly, understanding dawns across his face, and those sharply blue eyes narrow in – it’s still not exactly outward aggression. It’s more like curiosity. “You are a Hunter?”
Sam snorts, but Dean doesn’t hear him. He skids to a stop on the cement floor. Cas gets up from where he’d been seated at the table, nursing a cup of steaming coffee. He faces Dean and smiles soft, just how Dean remembers, eyes crinkling at the corners.
“Dean,” Cas says calmly. He’s finally meeting Dean’s eyes, and Dean can barely stand it. His fingers brush against Dean’s arm, and Dean’s so keyed-up, he almost flinches away. He can’t quite stop himself from starting, and Cas’s hand drops. “I’m not angry.”
“I don’t need your brother to tell me to keep an eye on you, boy,” Bobby growls in response. Dean rolls his eyes good-naturedly.
He supposes, somewhere in the back of his mind where he dared imagine what sex would be like, that he always knew it would be messy. He even wondered if he might somehow be a little disgusted by it. But he finds that not to be the case, at all. He is, perhaps, a little uncomfortable, but he is not repulsed. In fact, he does not have any inclination to move, at all, even if it meant cleaning up.
“You don’t get to tell me what I’m allowed and not allowed to do,” Cas says through gritted teeth, but when Dean looks at him again, he appears marginally less angry. In fact, there’s an uncomfortable glint of understanding in his eye. Maybe something akin to amusement.
Panic attacks are the only thing he can think about to compare to something like this. Dean doesn’t like to be touched when he has a panic attack. He likes to curl into a ball on the floor or on his bed and hide under something heavy and soft.
“What about you, old man?” Dean asks. “Why the hot wheels?” Bobby lost a leg in ‘Nam. Most days, he managed the garage with his prosthetic, or occasionally stumped around on crutches. It was rare to see him in his wheelchair, which Dean knew was the bane of his existence. Not because he really cared about the mobility issues, but because it was a pain to fold up in his truck and it aggravated the carpal tunnel in his wrists.
Jack shrugs. “I wish we were altogether in the bunker again. But I’m happy I’m back. I’ll be happier when Dean’s back.”
“You’re supposed to tell the doctor that, Dean,” Cas says calmly, but there’s an almost imperceptible tug of impatience behind his words. Like he’s explaining a simple concept to a two-year-old and the two-year-old refuses to understand. “He can make adjustments.”
Ummm...also, after literally a decade of fandom-obsessed life in which all my friends were like, "you are such a Tumblr person I can't believe you don't have a Tumblr," I just got myself a Tumblr and I have no idea what to do with it??? If anyone wants to, like, connect (?) or whatever it is people do on Tumblr, please hit me up: @foolondahill17. Also, if anyone wants to tell me what the hell I'm supposed to do with a Tumblr, also feel free to let me know XD.
She’s been a pretty good sleeper ever since she got used to the apartment, but Dean still moves as carefully as possible so he doesn’t wake her as he puts the sandwich makings away in the fridge and tucks the cooler back into the closet. Then he goes into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar so he can listen for any changes in her breathing. He mops up the water on the floor, brushes his teeth, and changes out of his soggy jeans into a pair of sweatpants.
“If you have a message for Dean, then you can tell us,” Lisa says fiercely. Sam feels a flare of anger on Lisa’s behalf, not directed at Anna, but directed at Dean – because the girl he’s waiting for is obviously not Lisa, and Lisa doesn’t know a thing about it.
with him,” Meg spits, like it’s poison. The coffee that splattered on the counter slowly trickles down the cabinet and hits the floor with a splat. “Told me I was being selfish for not wanting anything to do with the bastard.”
“Dean, please,” says Cas, still in his desperately calm voice. Sam renews his grip on Dean’s arm and the two of them manage to wrestle Dean back to his feet, then they all but shove him back onto the cot.
One hand low on Lisa’s back, other hand gripping hers, palms sticky with sweat. And he’s got the hip-motion down pat, all in the pelvis, in and out. And swing her out across the floor, twirl her back in. Get a mouthful of her dark hair, but she’s laughing, and he’s laughing, and the music is good: Fats Domino’s
“That’s totally okay,” Dean says at once, “Completely understandable.” He doesn’t mention how the words make a tiny bubble of joy grow in his chest.
Michael slashes his knife forward. It slices easily through Benny’s shirt. A spurt of dark red spreads across the white fabric. Benny gasps and claps a hand against the cut. He’s defenseless. His eyes are wide with terror. He missteps and trips, flails wildly for purchase on the ground –
Dean swallows, but it’s impossible to entirely chase the sense of betrayal, watching Emma with Lydia.
Charlie. Didn’t have her easy laughter, fiery courage, headstrong, stubborn, defiant beauty and, God, Dean misses her. Dean misses her so badly it is a palpable pain in his chest. Someone twisting a blade. Filling his lungs with blood.
Cas clicks his tongue reprovingly. He gets up from the bed so he can round the end and unlace Dean’s boots. He tugs off both shoes, leaving Dean’s socks on.
“You think he’s drunk again?” Sam asks. Because if they’re going to talk about Dean, they might as well hit all the bases.
“Gabriel sent the training potty,” Cas explains, and Dean just stares at him, unable to understand that specific collection of words in the context of Cas’s voice.
Dean passes the third floor with a pang. He wants to go in and see if Cas is in his studio. But how the fuck do you begin a five-week-late apology?
Maura hears her brother crying, and she starts crying in earnest, as well. Micah looks from one crying cousin to the other and his own eyes start watering. Micah outgrew late morning naps a while ago, and Dean usually puts him down around three, but he can tell it’s been a morning full of overstimulating emotions.
, he tells himself fiercely. Christian’s just being an asshole. It was impossible to expect the news of Dean’s arrest, subsequent stay at the hospital, and bipolar diagnosis definitely stay with Samuel, but no one here knows about what happened in August.
Dean grips the banister hard enough to turn his knuckles white on his way down the stairs. His knees shake with every step. He’s terrified he’s going to send himself ass over teakettle and break his fucking neck.
“Damn,” Dean replies. He’s not quite sure how to respond in the face of such relentless chattiness. At least his neighbor isn’t a psycho yelling at the walls. “Sorry.”
Dean barely registers the approaching holidays. He’s dimly aware that Christmas music has been blaring from Charlie’s apartment since the day after Thanksgiving. Gabe has even wound some straggly, plastic garland around the banister of the stairwell. Christmas is usually one of Dean’s favorite Holidays – it meant a brief spot of respite and peace during childhood. More often than not, Dad’d get it together enough to buy a nice dinner and maybe watch a movie together. Or sometimes he’d just drop them off at Bobby’s, and a few years they spent the holiday at Samuel’s.
“Um, yeah,” Dean replies. His face is weirdly hot. He blames it on standing so close to the stove. He digs two plates out of the cabinet and slips half an omelet onto each.
“Er – thanks, by the way,” he says gruffly, picking at a thread on the frayed cuff of his hoodie. “For, you know, last night.”
“What hearing, Dean?” Cas says. He’s good with his hands. Really damn good with his hands. So deft and careful as he grips Dean under his arms and tugs him into a sitting position against the backrest so he can breathe easier.
Beside him, Cas shifts. He inches down from the headboard, turns on his side so he’s facing Dean. And Dean wants to turn back over. Wants to hide his face in Cas’s shoulder. Wants Cas to stop looking at him.
Dean peers blearily into the room. He’s lying on his side. He’s attached to the usual array of tubes and wires: nasal canula, oxygen monitor, IV, chest tube, blood pressure cuff, catheter between his legs. And Sammy’s sitting in a chair against the curtain that blocks his view of his roommate, braced forward on his knees and worrying so hard, he’s giving himself wrinkles.
Meg lifts her head from her knees again, eyes cloudy with pain and anger. “Who the ever-living fuck asked you to be my fucking one-to-one?” she snarls.
Dean feels sleep tugging past the unease he managed to dig up. His body is too exhausted to deal with this shit, now. So he shuts his eyes again, curls into a more comfortable position, making sure to put his back to Cas so he doesn’t have any weird urges to kiss him when he next wakes up, and tries to fall back asleep.
I have zero applied knowledge about child custody litigation. Despite the fact that I do pour a good deal of research into this fic, I still get a lot of things wrong. If you happen to understand any topics better than me, always feel free to drop a note. I love learning new things and will never be offended by corrections.
“It’s none of your Goddamn business,” Dean growls, throat so tight he almost can’t get the words out, but the aggression helps. A little. Helps him feel less like he’s teetering on the edge of a cliff.
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean slides his cellphone to his ear, cutting off the beginning beats of “Smoke on the Water.” “Hey – buddy!” Dean turns his attention back to Micah, who, in Dean’s very brief moment of distraction, is now attempting to pick up the jug of orange juice with both of his tiny, wobbly hands. “Wait for dad, okay?”
“It was just sex,” Dean finishes faintly. “It was just sex. And I could handle a little bit of dick. It wasn’t a big deal. I could have – I could have said no.”
“W-walked,” Sam says between chattering teeth. He’s not quite so out of control anymore, but there are still tears spilling down his face as well as residual rain water.
Alastair stood over him with a knife and explained to his latest pupil how to hold the blade, how to touch the edge just so to the flesh so it only sliced through skin, didn’t damage the organs below because that was where the fun would begin.
Cas looks immediately apologetic, “I’m sorry if you’re bored – I didn’t mean to abandon you. But if you need to leave –”
“Ma-ma-ma-mamma!” she sobs, not even needing – Dean knows – to open her eyes to know Dean’s the wrong person. She knows by the shape of Dean’s hands and the feel of his body that it’s not Lydia. Dean’s chest aches.
“Always begged to join a team wherever or whenever we were. He did everything – basketball, baseball – even the bowling team once. Soccer was his favorite. Think he still plays pickup in the park during fall. Bobby’s got one of his trophies from sophomore year when the team went all the way to regionals. Lost by a goal. Kid was devastated. I took him out for sundaes to cheer him up.”
“Yeah, okay, Bobby,” Sam says. His throat is dry. He feels a little faint, so he takes some deep breaths, but that just makes him feel like he’s gonna puke.
Every time I dive into Dean’s headspace, I’m overwhelmed by the sheer volume of trauma this kid’s lived through. Again, please be mindful of my content warnings and tags (check the end note for more specific warnings that include spoilers). As my therapist says, be gentle with yourselves.
“Sure,” Dean all but squeaks. His heart starts thumping 100 miles per hour inside his chest. He feels a little like he’s being ushered into the principal’s office after he was caught in the janitor’s closet with his hand up Amanda Heckerling’s skirt.
“Dean,” the woman calls, surprised. It’s Andrea, Benny’s girlfriend. And Lizzy’s clinging to her hand. She blinks at the sound of Dean’s name and peers at him curiously.
It’s nearing mid-morning by the time Dean ambles through Lawrence and keeps driving, trying not to think about dinner with the Campbells.
She’s wearing athletic shorts so short they might as well be underwear, a t-shirt bearing the legend
There’s the feeling of stepping toward a precipice. Of toeing the ground at the edge. Stepping clear. Letting himself drop.
To be clear, I don’t mean to be dismissive or irreverent about any mental health issues in this chapter. Again, this is written from Dean’s perspective, and irreverence is kinda his thing; his (and Bella’s) comments about the other patients are not a reflection of my personal feelings about mental illness. Absolutely all mental pain deserves to be treated with care and understanding. If you have any concerns about how I've portrayed something, feel free to tell me in the comments. Even though this fic deals with a lot of heavy stuff, I do want it to be a safe place for everyone.
Dean shuts his eyes. Anything to get Cas to stop looking at him. He breathes for a while, in through his nose and out through his mouth.
aren’t going to mean anything to Samuel, not when the man’s knowledge of crazy people begins and ends with psycho killers like Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer. He touches Sam’s arm. Sam stops talking like he had to physically bite his tongue to do it. “I’m good,” Dean tells Samuel.
But he swings the door open, and there’s Cas. He looks uncomfortable and small in an oversized hoodie. There’s a smudge of purple paint under his right eye. He’s holding a stack of clothes in his arms that Dean recognizes as the t-shirt and jeans he’d lent Cas for their night out at Cesar’s. And he’s bypassed bobbing up and down for honest-to-God rocking back and forth on his heels. It looks like he’s trying to keep his balance on a boat.
“The conservatorship ended three years ago, Sam.” Dean bristles at Sam’s typical self-righteous bullshit. Sam doesn’t know what’s got him so fucking
“Your father didn’t know,” Cas says. It isn’t exactly a question. And there’s something in Cas’s voice, something deep that makes Dean shiver, makes him suddenly very glad that Cas never met John Winchester.
“There was, um,” Dean starts. God, he wishes he were anywhere but here. “This guy in prison. We were in the same cell, and – I –” shit. He can’t even say it. His throat clicks. The words just stop, leaving him gaping like a fish and soundless.
All Dean really remembers is a lot of light and noise. Jack was there, and so was Cas, clutching Jack’s shoulder. Jack was doing that glowing-shaking-screaming thing he does, Amara was trying to stop him, and Chuck-in-Sam’s body was trying to duck out of the way.
“Performing an act of prostitution or patronizing an adult prostitute can result in up to six months in jail or a $500 fine,” Charlene says calmly.
, under his breath and finally pulls his hands away from Dean’s chest, rolling his shirt back down over his bruised torso.
“How ‘bout you shut the hell up before I drag you in,” Campbell snaps, and Michael falls silent with a faint smile. “Now listen up, you sons of bitches. Tear each other to pieces for all I care. But not around here, you hear me? Wanna kill each other? Fucking kill each other. But you ain’t gonna do it on my beat.”
“And then I hate myself for thinking that,” he breathes. “I – God, I wish it had been me. That’s so stupid, huh? I wish it had been me, not you. Because then at least Sammy would’ve had the happy family. Kid deserves it, after all the shit me and Dad’ve put him through.”
Emma follows Ellen’s finger, and she seems to find Bobby absolutely hilarious because she bursts into a peel of laughter, takes her hand out of her mouth, and waves her wet fingers. “Bobba!”
“And that would make Sam my uncle,” Jack says, nodding decisively. Looking way too proud of himself.
“Good old fashioned MDD, baby,” Meg says. “Plus anorexia to spice things up. That’s why Clarence is so anal about the food thing.”
“Stupid dog,” Dean says. He falls sideways onto the couch, curls up with his head on the cushion. Bones lies beside him, and Dean’s hand trails off the couch, tangling in the dog’s long fur.
And what the fuck? Why is Dean thinking about that now? What the fuck does that have to do with anything?
And Dean wants to protest, tries to open his mouth, but all he can do is whimper because holy shit. Holy fucking shit. The fire in his chest burns to an all new intensity, blue-white flames licking through his muscles.
More sirens. More sirens. Don’t take him. Please don’t take him. Dean wants to go home. He just wants to go home. Please, he didn’t mean it. He didn’t mean to do it. He didn’t mean to hurt anyone. Please, he just wants to go home.
“Take a deep breath for me, Gigantor,” Dean says. He tosses over his shoulder to Jack, “Tell Cas we’ve got him.”
Cas immediately maneuvers around the tight space between Sam and the wall. Then he climbs up on the bed behind Dean and gently pulls Dean toward him so that his weight is supported by Cas’s chest. He snakes an arm around Dean’s uninjured side and lays his hand across Dean’s bloody stomach. He buries his head in Dean’s hair and shuts his eyes. He starts muttering something under his breath, too low for Sam to hear, but the look on his face is so achingly tender and distressed that Sam feels a little like he’s interrupted Castiel and Dean in the middle of kissing.
He chews on the end of the milkshake straw. The cup is cold. It’s hard to get his hand to grip it correctly. He takes a sip and the liquid slips sluggishly down his throat, lands like an ice cube in his belly. Make his head pound.
“Bread and other processed carbohydrates hold very little nutritional value to ducks. But it makes them feel full, so it replaces their naturally balanced diet,” Cas rattles off.
Bela’s eyebrows furrow. And the brightness in her eyes suddenly snaps to anger. “Fuck you,” she says. She sits up, using one hand to yank her pajamas back up. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing to me?” She reaches for her discarded shirt beside her.
Cas wonders if he should call Sam tomorrow, tell him about another bad night in a string of bad nights. But Sam deserves rest. Cas can handle this.
“I wanted to apologize,” Dean tells her again, looking away from the road for long enough for her to read his lips. She looks puzzled, so Dean continues, “I mean, in person. I shouldn’t have jumped down your throat like I did during dinner.”
“There she is,” he tells her, delighted. “There’s that pretty smile, beautiful. You’re gonna kill guys with that smile someday. Or, ah, girls. Whatever you go for. Not that you’re gonna go for anyone until you’re at least twenty-five.”
Meg nods. “Yeah, done it a few times. Did a bunch of grape vines on a girl the other day. Inside of her wrists.”
, man. You really think anything’s gonna touch it once Eileen goes all mama bear as soon as something so much as looks at her kid strangely?”
She asks if he’s ever put a child knowingly in danger, Dean says no, and he feels like a fucking liar because he is a fucking liar, even though Dean could argue that he didn’t
Dean doesn’t know the what the words mean. He’s vaguely aware it might be Latin, from the homework Sam used to bring home as a teenager. It sounds like some kind of poem, or maybe a prayer – Dean doesn’t know if it’s for Dean’s benefit or Cas’s.
“You know I can’t, right?” Dean says quietly. Sam peaks at him behind his arm. “Hunting,” Dean clarifies. “You know – the way things are, right now – that’s not something I can go back to. I can barely handle a gun. I can’t drive until I figure out all the fucking drugs.”
It’s always been there. He’s recognized it at multiple points in his life. Sometimes it’s worse than other times. Sometimes it sticks around for months on end. Lately it hasn’t shown any promise of leaving. And he supposes that’s what the shrink means when he says stuff like
“Mmh,” Bela replies, cocking an eyebrow. Again, Dean’s not sure if she’s impressed or disgusted. “I was screwing the headmaster and maths instructor at the same time. That was before they threw me out for stealing.”
There’s music now, and a few couples are swaying conservatively on the floor. Dean wonders how much of a stir they would cause if he and Cas got up to dance – not that they will.
Charlie shrugs. “Yeah, I guess. Sort of, I don’t know – it felt a little more like closure this Christmas. I think I finally realized how much I’m missing out on by not letting go. There’s a whole world out there, you know?”
Pam lets the silence sit there for a minute before she prods him, “So, you obviously moved out of your brother’s place in a hurry. But I’m asking you to be honest with me here – do you feel like it’s safe for you to live by yourself now?”
“But, of course, I wanted to ask your permission to use your likeness before I continued,” Cas keeps going as if Dean’s lungs haven’t dried into raisins inside his chest. “It’s a more sympathetic view of fatherhood. So many know a father as a cold and distant figure of authority. I wanted to reject those tropes, give people a subject who will crouch down at eye-level with his child, who will share with her the beauty of our world. Who is gentle a-and kind –”
“Fuck you,” he says, not caring if his voice carries. Not caring when about twenty businessmen and other rich douchebags turn to look at him with open disgust.
. So Dean hit him. Kicked him. Would have ripped his head off if he could – because didn’t he fucking know that Dean was Alastair’s? Didn’t he fucking know what Alastair would
Sam pulls back into himself: to the hard, plastic chair and the air choked with the smell of antiseptic. He realizes his cheeks are damp with tears. He draws his sleeve across his face before answering.
“Hey,” Dean says, sliding open his window. “You, ah....” She looks distinctly worse for wear. She looks like she just climbed out of bed, or maybe from under a rock. “You okay?”
His vision blurs and his breath hitches, hot tears spilling down his face. How the fuck did he think he could do this? How could he have the audacity to think that he – Dean Winchester, fuckup extraordinaire – was gonna be even close to a good father? His kid hates him, and it hasn’t even been two weeks. Emma probably had enough bad memories about the past two days that she’d never sleep another night with him again.
Dean nods. Charlie gives him a pat on the arm. She leaves him in the bathroom so he has a chance to compose himself before goodbyes.
Dean thought. Just fucking take it. Just relax. If he relaxed and stopped struggling it wouldn’t hurt so badly. It would be over soon. It was just sex.
Dean manages to nod his head. It’s getting too hard to speak again. There’s something squirming in his stomach that might be nervousness or discomfort or something else. Dean shuts his eyes and swallows, wanting to ignore it for a little while longer.
Benny starts out with announcements. He’s glad so many of them could turn out. He and someone named Lenore lead a closed group on Sunday evenings, so if there’s anyone interested in attending, feel free to come over and ask him about it later, or there’s literature in the back. Also, there’s coffee in the hall if anyone wants to stick around and chat after he’s done.
Sam pauses by the side of Dean’s bed. He’s all twisted hands and earnest expression, and Dean can’t stand it.
“I’ll be there, okay?” Dean says. “I work for Bobby – he’s good people. He’ll…we’re gonna need money.”
“Hello, Charlie, Kevin,” Cas says mildly. As usual, his deep voice cuts Dean to the core. “Hello, Dean.”
“Dean,” Cas says levelly. His other hand comes up. It lands under Dean’s chin and gently guides Dean’s face toward his. “I am very attracted to you,” he says bluntly. “Your voice is deep, dark blue and intoxicating.”
“Oh no,” Charlene laughs. It’s like she thinks Dean’s the funniest thing since sliced bread. The phoniness of it sets Dean’s teeth on edge. “This isn’t anything our lawyers need to be involved with, I assure you.”
The guy is looking at his shoes. And Dean tries not to wish he’d look back up. Tries not to think about how much he wants to see those eyes again.
Dean gulps for air, but Michael twists his fingers in his hair, shoves his face back below the surface.
Cas responds instinctually – Dean has said that Cas’s not a half-bad kisser, despite his inexperience, and Dean would know things like that, so Cas has learned to take guidance from Dean’s own movements: opening his mouth in the same way, searching Dean’s mouth with his tongue like Dean has done to him – around his lips, over the ridges of his teeth, into the warm and soft insides of his cheeks, curling tongue-and-tongue.
He hits the wall again. Something pops in his wrist. There’s blood on the paint and blood on his hand. He still can’t fucking feel anything and that’s because it’s
Charlie gives out hugs to everyone. Dean settles for a friendly wave. Cas looks like he’s angling for a hug – they got pretty cuddly on the couch – but Dean can’t bear having someone touch him right now, especially Cas, not when he feels like he’s a hair’s breadth from falling apart. So, he dodges the hug and goes for the handshake, instead, pretending to miss the brief glimpse of confusion in Cas’s eyes. But he catches Gabe’s furrowed brow, and he decides that he doesn’t have the emotional energy to worry about Gabe’s big brother instincts.
The next day, Dean feels better wearing a fresh pair of pants and shirt, even if it’s just his grubby loungewear. Dean can’t get out of group again because Victor isn’t there. Pam is coming again, but that’s not until the afternoon, so Dean trudges through the hallway to the meeting room. Joshua is back, a silent and soothing presence, after getting briefly replaced by a night aide.
And Cas is fairly certain that means he’s allowed back into Dean’s room, so he steps inside and grabs Dean’s laptop before approaching the bed. He’s unsure for a minute whether he’s allowed back on the bed, but Dean’s sitting to one side, and there’s plenty of room for Cas to sit, too, without having to worry about pressing up against Dean’s body, so Cas climbs in and puts the computer on his lap.
. It’s fine for people who want to identify that way, but he’s not sure if he’s there yet. Maybe it has something to do with what he was talking to Cas about: how Dad was so suspicious of anything that was different. Difference meant
“Sammy?” Dean stirs. His eyelids flutter. The valium took him out for a little while, but he’s still breathing too hard and fast, twitching occasional and muttering under his breath like he’s in the middle of a fever dream.
. The staticky, listless feeling that’s coated his body and mind like sticky cobwebs since Wednesday makes it nearly impossible to think.
“Where are you?” Dean demands, voice sharp, as much of an order as he can make it. “Meg, where are you?”
“I got another forty-five minutes,” Dean says, letting himself in from the street because the wind is starting to cut through his sweat-drenched clothes, and beginning his climb. His left knee twinges with every step, and Dean hides his wince despite the fact there’s no one around to see it.
Dean nods in comprehension. According to Cas, there’s nothing between them, but Dean can’t help but prod. “You guys seem really close.”
Specific chapter CWs: one use of the f-slur and homophobic-motivated violence, including an attempted assault with a non-con kiss, police brutality, and Dean acts briefly aggressive toward Cas because he doesn't know how to express his emotions.
Hopefully the idea that Dean isn’t alone will ease his little brother’s worries enough to leave his questions for the morning. Dean will deal with the consequences then.
He trips over an empty bottle of whiskey on the way and laughs at nothing, turns to say something to Sam, expecting his brother to be there, knuckling the sleep out of his eyes and ready to ask Dean if he’s okay, but Sammy isn’t there.
“Kay,” Dean says. And he needs help lifting his head so he can swallow the pill Cas gives him. He chases it with a sip of water that soothes his throat.
It’s only then that Dean notices a small, furry head pop up in the backseat of Sam’s car. Dean’s out of the impala in a second.
The first thing Dean notices, once his ears stop ringing and he’s blinked away most of the bright stain on his pupils, is Sam: his brother’s been flung away from the blast radius. He’s slumped on the ground, hair charred, not moving, and the chair he was on is now a splintered mess of wood and twisted metal.
“No problemo,” Dean says faintly, face warming more to do with the way Cas’s pecks are visible through the thin fabric of his shirt.
And Dean doesn’t want to lose that just yet. Even though he’s selfish for wanting it, and it’s unfair to ask it of Cas. But Dean still feels like he’s tottering, like any wrong move is going to send him careening back toward overwhelming panic, and he can’t – he can’t –
. Billie said the word is rape. Sam said the word is rape. “R-rape me. Cause I was just a kid. And I – even after I got older I still did it. Cause it was easy cash.”
Like Jesse promised, there’s a large platter of nachos in the middle of the table, but Dean doesn’t want to interrupt the game by reaching across the table and getting in the way of their dice throws, or something, so he mostly eats off Cas’s plate.
Cas tries to push himself into a sitting position, but he winces, and Dean moves. “Don’t be such a fucking bitch,” Dean says gruffly. He drags one of Cas’s arms over his shoulders and hauls him into a standing position. The added weight almost takes Dean down.
If July was the calm before the storm and August the storm, then September is reconstruction. Dean knows all about getting back on track. When he was twenty-seven, he climbed his way out of a grueling physical therapy regimen so he could use his leg again. He’s slogged through countless meds and rehab stays and hospitals. And he scrabbled his way out of two months of catatonia through a combination of drugs and ECT. Dean knows how to get back on his feet.
That’s Sam’s cue. He grabs hold of Dean’s upper arm, hauls him steadily to his feet. Dean sways for a minute, shuts his eyes and looks like he’s in pain, but he takes a deep breath and nods. “I’m fine.”
“I – yeah, thanks,” Dean says quickly. Cas slides the plate of pancakes in front of Dean. Dean snatches up his fork and knife, cuts into the stack. They’re still a little soupy in the middle, but whatever. He tastes them; too much baking soda, but it’s nothing a little maple syrup won’t cover, so Dean forces a smile, shoots Jack a thumbs up, “They’re great.”
“Yeah, ah, sure,” Dean says. He shifts a little in his seat. Switches from one ankle across his knee to the other.
“Did you leave the bar with a young woman named Elysia Johnson to go to her room in the Moonlight Motel across the street?”
“I can guarantee that, if you went off your meds,” Victor says soberly, dark eyes refusing to let Dean look away by the sheer firmness of his gaze. “You wouldn’t find that to be the case.”
, man. I ain’t dying,” Dean grunts. And Cas knows this is how Dean gets when he’s hurting and doesn’t want people to know. He gets aggressive when he’s trying to protect himself. Cas has finally realized, that when Dean tells him to leave, he doesn’t really want him to go.
“You’re going to be alright, Dean,” Cas tells him. He puts his face near Dean’s. Presses his forehead against Dean’s forehead. His eyes are so close, Dean can’t focus on them. All there is is blue.
“Is that why you’d hurt yourself?” Sam asks, voice hushed, still with that hollow, echoing ring to it, like he’s just learned the most devastating news he could imagine. Like somebody died. Maybe somebody has. Maybe Sam’s last crumb of uncorrupted childhood has just been pulverized. Or maybe Dean’s dead. Maybe Dean’s finally done the unforgiveable.
Okay, he tells himself. He’s okay. Sam’s okay. Everyone in the world is A-Okay. He does the thing that Pam taught him, the grounding technique, or whatever, where he takes stock of his surroundings or roots himself in his body or some other hippie shit.
. He can’t say no to Cas, right now. Not when Cas is clearly so desperate for help. Not when Cas just compared Dean to Meg,
“You won’t let ‘em hurt us?” Ella asks. Her hair’s compressed on one side from sleeping on it. Cas has watched countless hours of YouTube videos on how to style and take care of her hair, and Dean’s been so inundated by hair type charts and conversations about textures and porosity he finally cracked and begged Mia for help. Mia came through with a ton of resources, complete with several references for parenting kids of a different race. Dean’s looking toward to a ton of hard work and reading, but he’ll learn anything if it means Ella and Micah grow up feeling safe, loved, and respected.
He makes contact with something hard. There’s a soft gasp, followed by a shattering crash that makes Dean’s ears pulse. He flinches hard, bringing both hands up to cover his head –
Dean just needs a drink. Needs a drink and needs to lie down somewhere. Needs to sleep, because there’s something pounding inside his head. Taking a jackhammer to his skull from the inside-out. Michael is yelling in his ear.
me that – w-when Gordon came after me I was – I was – I defended myself because he – he wasn’t a-allowed – I didn’t w-want Alastair to be angry b-because I –” Jesus Christ, Dean can hardly breathe.
A few people start up a game of Cards Against Humanity, Charlie and Gabe vying for the win. Dean opts out; he still feels rattled, made worse by Kali’s confrontation. He used to be so good at parties: quick to make friends – or at least be friendly, able to make casual, easy conversation instead of standing awkwardly in the corner, terrified of saying the wrong thing if someone asks him a question.
God, how could he be so stupid? Of course, this wasn’t going to work. Dean was an idiot for even imagining it. Besides, he’s not supposed to focusing on a relationship, right now. He’s supposed to focus on Emma.
Dean doesn’t beg. Not in front of Sam, he doesn’t, and it makes something inside Sam shrivel up and die.
Finally, he eases himself off the floor, straightening his aching leg out in front of him as he perches on the closed toilet lid, letting Emma splash for a while before the water goes cold.
Dean snorts. There’s an unsteady peace between them, now. Dean could crack a joke about not wanting to know what Sam calls his girlfriend in bed, and they’d be on their merry way. But there’s a tug in Dean’s solar plexus. This conversation isn’t over. And he really doesn’t want to have it in a musty city alleyway during a rain shower, but the odds of working up the courage to start this shit unprompted? Nil to one.
Sammy calls Dean a cocksucker and then heads out of the garage. Dean makes sure he turns the right direction for their apartment before he spins on his heel and starts up on the cleanup for the rest of the night. There’s no point finishing up the station wagon now; it’ll be there in the morning. So, Dean tosses his tools into the box and takes the keys off the hook by the garage door and crosses the floor again to lock Bobby’s office.
makes every blood vessel in Dean’s body perk up their little ears and start working overtime. “Yeah, sure,” Dean says.
“Damn, Teach,” Dean grins at her. His cheeks feel weird. He feels weird. He really wants to be anywhere but here, right now. “Gonna knock some sense into the freshies?”
It’s a few minutes before they get started. Dean’s glad when no one engages him in conversation. Between him and the girl, they’re putting out strong enough
“What happened?” Dean says awkwardly. He’s been on the receiving end of this kind of thing one too many times, but he doesn’t know how to work it from the other side.
“Hey, bug, I think it’s time for dinner,” Dean says abruptly. To avoid any possible arguments, Dean quickly tacks on: “How does mac and cheese sound to you?”
“So you’re not interested in casual flirtation?” Cas clarifies with a smirk that makes Dean’s cheeks burn.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean says. “Nothing fucking happened, okay? I was – and you were – and nothing fucking happened, so can we just forget about it? Just. Shit.” He takes a long draw of whiskey, right from the bottle, pulls away with a gasp and then wipes his mouth with his arm.
Dean takes his eyes away from his little brother long enough to address Jack again. “Grab some towels and a blanket, will you?” Jack nods and speeds off without a word.
He wishes his head would stop doing that. Everything’s so unstable and confusing. There are too many people and then not enough people. Just four bare walls. Hours and hours and days and days and Billie?
Kaia snorts. “What privacy? The shit kind of privacy do I have anymore, huh?” She shakes her hair out of her face. Her eyes are wet and angry.
Cas looks away for a second, just long enough to peer through the open window. There’s a bed in there, Dean can see, and a bunch of books and loose paper all over the floor.
“Hush you,” Ellen says. “At least I’m putting it to good use. Been keeping it around for the first grandchild, anyway.” Ellen sends Dean a wink, which makes Dean’s face grow warm. He translates his emotions into dropping a comforting kiss onto Emma’s head. She’s quieted a little, and she’s making snuffling noises instead of outright wailing.
Cas moves to the end of the mattress, puts his feet on the ground, and then he reaches his arms high over his head. It makes the bottom of his shirt ride up, revealing a stripe of tanned belly, and a trace of dark happy trail that disappears under the button of his jeans.
And Dean just snapped. Chomped down so hard on the fingers in his mouth he heard something snap, tasted blood, and the guy howled.
“Shut up,” Dean moans, because he can barely hear her anymore over the rush of blood in his ears. He is so tired. So fucking tired.
“Sure you did,” Dean says, and musters a smile. “You’re my kid brother. The big fuck up. Man, you’re so messed up, Eileen will take one look at you and be powerless to do anything but take you into her arms and kiss you stupid.”
Dean sucks in a short, shuddering breath that catches in his throat and twists inside his stomach so hard it almost hurts. Dean staggers back. Cas’s eyes open, and they’re startling blue, as always. He looks puzzled for a moment, and then something dawns across his face: a closed-off look of comprehension that immediately makes Dean wish he hadn’t hesitated.
They eat leisurely. There’s no sense in rushing to the Campbells, not when neither Dean nor Sam are looking forward to it.
What with Wednesdays and every-other weekend taken up with Emma, and weekdays spent waking up early for work, it means that Dean hasn’t actually had Cas over to spend the night yet.
Sam’s worried, insistent chatter transforms into a one-tone buzz inside Dean’s head. His brother is sitting beside him, leaning over his bed. And his enormous face is ghostly pale, red and wet around the eyes. Which means he’s been crying. And that – that’s not good. Sammy crying equals
A hand like a vice curls around his shoulder, and Christian’s vicious sneer fills his ear, “What did I tell you, Benny. Yellow as they come.”
“Come in,” Cas calls, like he always does from within his studio, but Dean hesitates. Because does he know it’s Dean? If he did know it was Dean – would he have still invited him?
“There’s always going to be something,” Sam continues. It’s like he’s not even listening to what Dean’s saying. “We can’t get out, Dean. We’ve tried so many fucking times. Something always follows us home. And I can’t – I can’t let them die because of me.”
Thomas and his sons, Mark and Johnny, come out of the house when Robert yells that “Winchester’s boys are here!” Dean notes that Samuel isn’t among them and isn’t exactly surprised.
“You’re right,” Cas sneers. “I should not have assumed you’d want me to know anything about you, Dean.”
Dean snorts. “Difficult. Fuck difficult.” Dean chokes. “Do you know what a person smells like when they burn?” he says it without meaning to. It just slips out of his lips, and then it hangs there in the open air.
Because Sam doesn’t get it. He doesn’t get what it’s like to be screwed up in the head. To lose a fucking kid because you’re deemed
And then he thinks about how much he wants Eileen to be there, but then he remembers that she took Jack grocery shopping because the only edible things in the bunker’s kitchen were cereal, bacon, peanut butter, and leftover soup.
Maybe Cas will yell at him to sit back up when he returns, but Dean doesn’t care. He doesn’t want to be some kind of helpless invalid. He’s so pointless. He’s just this worthless piece of shit that keeps messing everything up and makes Cas concerned and makes Sammy so fed up that he left.
It makes Dean snap his eyes away from his daughter. “Wait, Kaia?” he asks. “One of your foster kids is Kaia?”
But he remembers random nights when Dad would pass out from drinking too much whiskey and wouldn’t hear Sammy crying, so Dean had to get up and figure out how to climb inside Sammy’s crib and climb out again without dropping his baby brother. Figure out how to change his diaper or warm up a bottle. And he remembers coming into the bathroom once, finding Dad on the floor with a knife against his wrist.
“There’s been multiple studies done on people who endure long periods of abuse,” Billie explains. Her calm, matter-of-fact voice is almost a reprieve after Dean’s uncontrollable rambling. “Often they become transfixed by their abuser’s wishes and behavior. You’d think it would start as a defense mechanism, but it doesn’t. It’s just automatic. Your body and mind, especially with repeated activation, involuntarily identify and rationalize the aggressor’s behavior. You start to identify – even empathize – with the person who hurts you. Do you understand?”
The policeman on the other side of the door knocks again, two loud, impatient thumps like he’s switched over from his knuckles to his whole fist.
Pamela – despite the ropes of crystals, strange pendants, and protective charms she wears around her neck – subscribes to a fairly practical self-care methodology. So she sends Dean home with a list of incredibly simple actions to do before he crawls back into bed: one, get off the bus two stops earlier so he has to walk the rest of the way, thus getting fresh air, exercise, and sunlight. Two, drink two glasses of plain water as soon as he gets into the apartment. Three, take a shower.
So, Dean hasn’t had to directly confront the rumors before Krissy brought it up. And he’s happy to know that news of their retirement seems somewhat contained. Pretty vague.
“Seriously,” Dean insists. “I’m fine. I don’t need babysitters. I just gotta get a good night’s sleep.”
Alastair laughed. Dean remembers that now. The spider-legs of his laughter crawling up Dean’s skin, threading into his flesh, a thin silk webbing that’s clogged up all his pores, held everything inside his body like a jailcell, made it impossible to sweat out.
“Shit!” Jack says, and nearly drops the bowl he’s carrying when he turns toward Cas in the darkness. Cas raises an eyebrow – it’s language Jack has certainly picked up from Dean. “Sorry,” Jack says quickly. “I was getting – I was hungry so I just went to get some – cereal,” Jack finishes, and sags a little. “I was just getting cereal.”
“I’ll think about it,” Dean says. What she said about it – doing something that makes her body feel like it belongs to her, again. Dean wants that. Maybe he could – hell, Cas has pierced ears. Maybe Dean could do that, too. Or dye his hair, maybe. Get a nose ring. Make Sammy think he’s really gone off the walls.
Cas hovers in the doorway. “Are you…alright?” It’s a ridiculous question, and Cas is a fool for asking it. But he doesn’t know what else to say. Not when all he can remember is waking up next to Dean in bed, feeling his lips –
Dad’s voice rebounds in his head, and Dean tries to ignore it. But he’s never been good at blocking out Dad’s orders, so it lands heavy and sick in his stomach.
The woman smiles kindly, and extends her hand. “I try to be as informal, as possible, so, please, call me Mia.” Dean knows Dr. Mia Vallens is a family therapist turned child custody mediator. Mick has worked with her before with some of his clients; he says she’s kind and fair.
Again, Dean feels a little flutter of guilt for ruining Charlie’s evening in yet another way: first by crashing her party with extra people and, second, by dumping her early to have sex. Fuck. Why doesn’t he ever think about these things before he just does stuff?
For a minute Dean thinks about letting Christian have it. Plowing his fist right into the bastard’s smug, ugly face. For a minute he thinks it’ll be worth it. But then Victor’s fingernails dig into his shoulder again, and Benny muscles his way between them.
Dean loses an afternoon of work on Monday to see Mick and Sam, but the meeting’s fruitful in that they set up a schedule for more meetings and outline the arguments Mick thinks Toni Bevell will use against Dean.
“Get out of here and get us pizza.” Dean dismisses his brother with a snap of his wrist. Sam rolls his eyes, but he snatches his keys from the counter and heads out the door.
That’s how Dean lives most his life: out of obligation. Pamela and Sam call it maintaining a healthy routine. Dean pops his second dose of lithium, then he drags himself through the motions of reheating yesterday’s pizza and, because Victor threatened to refer him to a dietician on more than one occasion, he munches on a few baby carrots and some of Sam’s gross broccoli.
This announcement takes the air out of Dean’s lungs. The idea of Eileen and Cas texting – he doesn’t know why it’s so strange. And he’s struck by the sudden thought that last night might not have been the first time Cas and Eileen were in touch. That maybe they’ve been texting this whole time – stupid, mundane things about living with the Winchester brothers. Like how both Dean and Sam don’t roll their socks before they put them in the drawer, complaining about how they drink directly from the milk carton, comparing notes on other stuff. And it’s so ridiculously
“And you know I’m really proud of you, right?” Sam says, still with that stupid constipated look on his face, twisting up his mouth and making him look even more like a dufus.
He lights up and leans over the banister. He kind of regrets it as soon as he’s sucking smoke into his lungs, but, oh well.
“It’s a cute place, kiddo,” Dean says because Charlie’s eyes are flat as she peers through the windshield.
Dean’s chest twists so hard, it’s like a cramp between his ribs. For a horrible moment, he thinks he’s going to be sick. Right in the middle of the kitchen floor. And Jack’s going to be totally freaked out –
“Pwease!” Emma says immediately, and Dean’s heart melts a little. She crawls into his lap and happily munches on her grapes.
And Dean doesn’t understand why he’s remembering stuff like that now. When he hasn’t thought about it in years. Hasn’t thought about it because it’s not like any of it really matters.
He tries to calm down, reminding himself that no one is going to demand anything of him here. They’re all just people. Just people having a good time at a friend’s birthday party.
“The hell does Benny’s picnic have to do with Jo?” Dean says, too sharply, because Sam’s immediately on the defensive.
Dean takes a minute to breathe through the ache in the center of his chest, the rampant relief that’s made his hands start shaking again. He puts Sam’s breakfast behind him on the bed before he drops it on the floor again. Then he turns back to the front and nudges Sam’s shoulder with his elbow.
“Hey, hey, Dean?” Charlie’s fingers tap on Dean’s cheeks, and Dean tries to pry his eyelids open. Charlie’s pale face hovers directly over his. Cas stands behind her, equally anxious. God, Dean’s tired. He fucking aches. “Wakey, wakey, big guy. We gotta get you to the hospital, okay? Coughing up blood, as a rule, isn’t great.”
Because Sam’s known for a long time. He’s seen his brother taste it. Test the waters. There was those heart-stopping seven minutes when Cas was dead and they were investigating that sketchy asylum when Dean pulled out those fucking needles. And Sam hadn’t even known Dean carried those things around with him, let alone where he’d gotten them from, what he’d been planning on doing with them.
The nurse breezes in with a smile, “Hello, love,” she says, gently nudging Sam aside so she can get to Dean’s side. “Happy to see you’re awake.” Dean’s eyes track the nurse as she bends over his bed, checks something on his monitors, reaches for his blanket to pull it up higher on his chest.
It takes Dean a minute to register Sam’s words, a minute to comprehend that his little brother is quite literally sobbing uncontrollably in Dean’s arms, because for a shameful, terrible minute all Dean can focus on is the fact that Sam is out of his skull drunk. And Dean can smell the whiskey on his breath. He can smell it so strongly it’s like he can taste it. He can fucking taste it.
“Offended?” Sam’s eyebrows shoot up. “I’ve seen my brother offended, Cas. And, let me tell you, Dean hits things when he’s offended. He doesn’t act like this.”
The rest of the day passes in a hazy blend of rattled thoughts and turbulent emotions. He gets into a shouting match with Cole over some misplaced tools, yells at Rufus when Rufus tells him off for yelling at Cole, nearly cries when Benny asks if he’s okay, and actually cries when Bobby chews him out for being a “stupid ass.”
. But Dean can’t speak with Cas’s tongue in his mouth, tangling with Dean’s own tongue, running across Dean’s teeth and poking into every corner of his mouth.
“Yeah,” Dean breathes. He wipes his mouth on the sleeve of his hoodie. He isn’t entirely sure he can get up on his own, but he doesn’t know how to possibly communicate that to Sam.
Grateful for the change in subject, Dean stuffs his hand into his jacket pocket and brings out the folded brochure he’d printed off his laptop at the bunker.
Dean wanders over to the bathroom to see, and discovers that there is, indeed, a bright green potty-training toilet with a smiling frog on the lid in the corner of the room.
“It didn’t feel like it was –” Dean hesitates, runs his tongue over his teeth, and continues warily, knowing he’s gonna sound like a headcase and trying to reassure himself that Billie already knows he’s a headcase. What the fuck else is he doing back in her office? “It didn’t feel like I was there.”
Benny shoves Luca off him and charges Michael. Michael ducks. Benny’s momentum sends him toward Dean. Michael spins. Michael lunges.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says. “Whatever, man.” But something deep and secret inside of him glows at the praise. “Chew with your mouth closed.”
Victor chuckles and shakes his head. Sam sputters and spits on the floor, but the whiskey does its job and shocks him back to attention.
“If you’re alright to continue, I’d like to talk about some common reactions to trauma so I can get a better idea about the things you deal with.”
“Cas, buddy,” Dean laughs. He nudges him again. Cas’s arm is warm and firm, and Dean remembers the black feathers that are hiding under the shirt and suit jacket. “I just wanted to ask if you wanted to grab a burger or something after this. The munchies are nice, but I feel like I’m eating crumbs. Plus, it looks like they’re sucking you dry.”
The Shadow grins, and it is an alien imitation of Castiel’s own smile, but Cas also notices Jack’s chin, the particular, stiff way Jack holds his body. “Only souls can go to heaven, Castiel,” the Shadow says, and Cas’s stomach twists unpleasantly with the implications of its words.
, bitches, Dean thinks, and reminds himself of Charlie. He feels a dull ache deep in his chest; he misses living right next door to her.
And that’s when everything else started, too. Because Dean can bullshit himself all he wants about waiting until he was eighteen, about waiting until he was at least old enough not to get turned out of bars, but the truth is, he’d thought about it before. It’s be so fucking easy. He knew he was pretty enough for it. He already knew how to turn heads. But it took her to teach him that sex was just sex, that a blowjob didn’t matter as long as it earned him a buck.
Ellen stops in front of Emma, smile lighting up her whole face. “Well, ain’t you just lovely, sweetheart.”
“Sorry, man. You’ve been upstaged,” Dean says, and he drops his hand onto Cas’s shoulder. Cas’s arm is warm under his t-shirt. His face is flushed red from the heat of the bar and dancing. “Wanna smoke?” He offers his pack of cigarettes.
Sam screams at the same time Luca does. Michael drops. Dean stands there. Sam and Luca sprint for Dean. Dean stares, transfixed, as a second boy slides forward and pulls Michael’s body to his chest. Cradles Michael’s head in his lap.
So, Dean remembers stuff like that. But he can’t remember the first time Dad brought them to see Missouri, or met Caleb and Pastor Jim, or when Sammy learned to walk, or simple things like eating peanut butter sandwiches or playing with matchbox cars.
“It’s the quality rather than the quantity,” Cas replies, and Dean chuckles. Turns out, Cas is a snuggler. Dean wouldn’t have thought it by looking at him – a scruffy dude who’s more likely to trade a scathing barb than a kind word – but he’s a total octopus in bed. After a perfunctory, “Stay here,” and a return with a damp cloth to clean them up, Cas wastes no time to curl back up in bed, pillows his head on Dean’s chest, wraps an arm around Dean’s middle, and sticks a leg between Dean’s knees.
Dean clenches his teeth, hard enough to hurt his jaw. He wants it. There’s a yawning, desperate pit inside of his stomach, a sultry voice whispering in his ear that it will help. It will make everything go away again. And isn’t that what he wants? He wants it all to go away. Go back to the way things were. When he could drown out the nightmares and panic attacks with a couple slugs of whiskey. And he didn’t have to spend every day so wrapped up in tension and anxiety that he’s giving himself back spasms, can’t stop his hands from shaking – and –
It makes Dean’s heart trip. His body is too twisted up with pain and anxiety and horrible, hollowed out fear to understand what he’s feeling now. Whatever it is wells up until it sits in his throat, clogging his breath.
. And he hates it. He doesn’t know why this keeps happening. He’s never cried this much in his fucking life and why does it keep happing when Sammy is
“You hurt yourself?” Dean asks after a second. Meg doesn’t seem to be crying anymore. She not nearly as frantic as she was on the phone. Instead, she’s a silent, immovable block on the floor.
“Very well.” Bevell continues with a nasty sneer, “I suppose Mr. Winchester is more than dramatic enough. Did you drink to the point of drunkenness?”
“Any word on when I can get out of this place?” Dean asks, doing his best to sound like his usual self, but falling pretty flat, seeing as he barely has the lung function to get over 10 decibels, which – he remembers as one of the few useless facts he took away from high school science – is about the same level as rustling leaves.
“Anything good in there?” Dean murmurs. With enough pain meds, they were able to get Dean comfortable enough to lay on his back, propping up with a few pillows because he was having issues breathing on his side.
“It’s a little before noon on Thursday,” Sam says. He scratches the back of his neck. “You, um, kinda missed most of yesterday.”
Cas’s lips break into a smile at the thought. “I’m very glad to hear that. Would – would you like to come see my newest painting?”
“I’m not your mother,” Cas says, in that in-between tone of his that Dean can never parse out to be serious or just an incredibly dry and unfunny joke.
Dean leads the way into the house, Sam, Eileen, and the dog following him. At least it smells delicious. He catches the scent of fried chicken and something sweet that he hopes his pie. At least the Campbells always know how to eat right.
, Sammy, no!” Dean replies. He shakes Sam off. Fuck, how depressed does he have to be that when he’s
The weekend is when things get boring. He’s well enough that he can stay awake for longer periods of time, but not well enough that he can get out of bed and go home, so he’s stuck in bed, feeling his ass grow numb, as he catches up on soap operas and game shows.
And Cas has waited so long, refused to let himself hope for so long – because Dean is a human, and Cas is an angel, and Dean has only ever referred to Cas as his best friend, as good as a brother, family. None of those things allow space for waking up wrapped in each other’s arms, or pressing their lips together, or –
Dean shimmies across the bed and pulls Cas with him. Cas’s keeping most of his weight on his arms, probably because he doesn’t want to overwhelm Dean. And Dean doesn’t want to think about that, so he cups the back of Cas’s neck, slings an arm around Cas’s waist, hooks a leg around his back, and then Dean rolls them so Dean’s on top.
, okay?” It’s out of his mouth before he can think about it, and once it’s there, he can’t swallow it back.
Sam screams inside Dean’s head, and sorry, Sammy, sorry, because there are two options here: either the world’s already saved or the world’s never going to be saved, and Dean can’t do a damn thing about it.
“Fuck, yeah, I guess,” Dean says. He puts his face in his hands and scrubs at his eyes. Son of a bitch, he’s tired.
“Just to reiterate,” Billie adds. “I don’t mean to pressure you into speaking to anyone. I believe it will be helpful for you to have a more informed support system, but this is information that you should only share if you
“I think she might have been trying to warn me off you,” Dean adds. “You sure she ain’t harboring any lingering feelings?”
“Shut up,” Dean tells him. And then he closes the distance between them, dipping his head forward so their mouths meet. Cas makes a low noise of surprise in his throat, but he doesn’t pull away.
The expression of discomfort grows on Dean’s face. “I gotta, Cas. I gotta be there for Benny. He’s – he’s like my brother, man.”
“That’s what we decide at midnight,” Dean replies. “When, where, and how. Hunters called it, so ball’s in your brothers’ court, now.”
And Dean doesn’t know how to do this. He’s a class-act one-night-stand guy. Gone before she can think about offering coffee in the morning. Dean doesn’t do morning’s after. He doesn’t do
Cas does not know where Luca went when he dropped Cas off at Naomi’s, told Anna and Alfie that Michael was dead, and then rushed off again. Cas does not care. All that matters is that Luca is not home. And Anna and Alfie are in the apartment downstairs. And Cas and Dean are alone, utterly, peacefully alone.
As she steps around him, Dean calls after her, “Hey, if you get the chance, talk Alfie into coming to Missouri sometimes. He seems…better the rest of them. I think Cas could do with some more family around.”
And he doesn’t want it to happen again. Panic cramps in his stomach. It fills his brain with white-hot fear.
And then the floor creaks under a pair of bare feet. Dean sees Cas’s toes in front of him, curling into the carpet, and then Cas’s knees drop past Dean’s eyes as Cas kneels.
“No,” Dean moans. He throws his left arm over his eyes, turns onto his side so his back is to the doctor. His face is wet. “N-no. Please. I’m okay. I promise I’m okay.”
It isn’t something Cas takes lightly. Even given what had…happened between them the other night. Cas is still Dean’s friend. Dean called him his
Cas wakes abruptly with a crick in his neck, and doesn’t immediately comprehend what’s woken him except to understand that there’s a deep pit of anxiety in his stomach. Then Cas realizes that he’s not in his own bed, but Dean’s – crammed uncomfortably up against the headboard, and Dean’s laptop has slid off Cas’s legs, so it’s flipped over on its side on the mattress and the screen’s fallen asleep.
“There’s no right or wrong way to talk about it,” Billie answers. “You’re only going to discover which way makes you most comfortable by trying something out. I know it feels like a catch 22. But it’s important to let yourself get used to the narrative.”
Dean even thinks about Jo for a wild moment, but even though they’re texting again, they’re not nearly close enough to warrant a secret like that. Besides, Jo’s never been good at keeping secrets. She’d probably spill to Ellen. And as much as Ellen’s been an occasional almost-substitute Mom, she’s definitely not on Dean’s list of people he could handle knowing about this.
“It was a team effort,” Dean says firmly. And he thinks about Ben. He doesn’t know why, but he does. He thinks about Lisa telling him, sitting side-by-side on Bobby’s stairs,
Gotta eat. Sammy’s gotta eat. And $25 gave him at least five days’ worth of food: canned soup and boxed mac and cheese and McDonalds and fresh vegetables because a kid Sam’s age needed vitamins and minerals. Sam came home with one of those poster food pyramids when he was about eight-years-old, stuck it to the fridge with magnets.
Charlie looks absolutely flabbergasted, but also thrilled. “You fucking kidding me? I didn’t even have to get down on my knees!”
Dean’s stomach twists. It still makes him squirm with discomfort and shame to think about last month. To think about Cas and Sam finding him in that motel room. Because it wasn’t like –
, Sam,” Dean snaps. Sam flinches, but Dean can’t stop. He scoffs, “Sexual trauma? What the fuck do you think
“What…happened?” It takes a long time to drag the words out. It’s easier if he whispers, just takes a deep breath and shapes the sound of his exhale.
“I’m just gonna wrap your wrists, okay?” Sam says, marveling at the fact his voice is still steady. He wants to keep talking, telegraphing his motions so he doesn’t frighten Dean any more than he already is.
“Just,” Dean doesn’t know what he was going to say. “Just…fuck.” And he holds his hand out for the bag of clothes. The movement unsteadies him. He makes the decision to sit back on the hospital bed instead of falling on his face. He thinks he makes it look partially natural.
Dean takes a minute to take stock of his body. Legs: check. Chest: rising and falling. Arms: A-Okay. Dick: yup. Still there. Head: heavy, but apparently attached to his neck.
“Here, man,” Sam says kindly, and the world tips again as Dean’s lowered onto something soft. He recognizes the slightly musty sent of the infirmary beds. The mattress is uncomfortable: all springs and soft where it’s supposed to be firm, too hard where it’s supposed to be soft, and Dean wants this bed. He wants his room. He wants to be left alone.
. He can’t do normal. He can’t do boyfriends or partners or fucking SOs. “It’s too early for your shit.”
His wrist stings. Dean closes his right hand tight around the burn. His heart thunders in his ears with the burst of adrenaline that always comes with pain. It’s a little like being high – except it makes him feel more present instead of floaty and distant. But the effect is the same: he’s focused on the single point of pain on his body, and he’ll stay that way long enough to clear his head, until the rest of the world finally fades back in. And then he’ll feel like shit. But he doesn’t have to worry about that, yet.
That doesn’t make Dean feel any better. “You could come with me to my uncle’s – you know Bobby?” Come to think of it, Charlie’s become such a staple in his life, he’s astonished she has yet to meet Bobby or Ellen. “He and Ellen wouldn’t mind the extra person. There’s always plenty of food. Plenty of booze. Plenty of pie.”
“Heya, Dean,” Garth calls, popping his head around the doorway. “We got a walk-in asking for you. Some lady.”
“Your car is still at the bar,” Sam tells Dean, tugging him back to the present. Dean knows he’s being kicked out.
“I should probably head back over to my place. Gotta post something to let people know I’m still alive.” Instead of heading out the front door like a normal person, Charlie crosses Dean’s apartment and climbs over the top of the couch. She ducks through the window onto the fire escape. “Anyway,” she peaks her head through the window, “thanks for being all prince charming last night. I needed it.”
Dean limps over to the couch and falls against the cushions. He sinches the blanket still draped around his shoulders over his chest. He’s cold. He can’t meet Cas’s eyes.
“Yeah,” Dean admits reluctantly, feeling somehow that he’s getting a failing grade in therapy. He thought this shit was supposed to help. Why does he still feel just as crappy as when he first began coming? “I – I don’t get why it’s still happening. Isn’t the containment thing supposed to keep this shit locked up?”
“Fuck you,” he replies. He shoves Gabe in the chest. The smaller man nearly topples off his stool. Dean’s moving before he gives in to the impulse to smash his fist into the bastard’s fugly, self-satisfied mug. Someone calls after him. He doesn’t turn back.
is a request to a third party – it means they can go over your head if you can’t provide or don’t have access to a certain document. An interrogatory is any question that can’t be answered with a strict
I wanted to thank romanticizedtaboos for the comment they left back on chapter 30 about containment strategies in trauma, which led to me researching the topic and coming up with the idea of connecting Dean’s containment strategy to keeping Michael trapped in season fourteen. Our brains are so cool.
“I have no idea what Enochian is,” Dean admits, tracing his fingers across the lettering. He can feel Cas’s ribs move underneath him as he laughs.
“Like, ah –” Dean hesitates for a minutes before he cuffs his left sleeve and shows Meg his inner arm, from when he was nineteen and stupid. It’s faded from the angry red rope he left there, but it’s still one of the largest on his body, other than the one reconstruction surgery left on his knee.
Dean snorts. “I don’t blame him. We haven’t exactly been exciting company.” The note of self-derision is evident in Dean’s voice. “Kid deserves a better place than this to grow up in.”
“Dean!” The shout comes from the end of the alley. Dean’s heart nearly claws itself out of his throat and splatters all over the pavement.
“D-don’t let them take me,” Dean says. Hot tears drip down his face. The tightness in his throat just gets worse again, panic making his entire body seize. He hates it there – fucking hates the white coats and impassive faces and reaching hands and tubes and needles and wires. He hates it hates it hates and he doesn’t want to go. They can’t make him go. “P-please.”
Sam eases Dean into the backseat. Dean honest to God goes fetal on the leather bench, knees drawn to his aching chest. He’s shivering. Miracle hops in after; Sam makes an aborted noise of protest, but Dean doesn’t pay attention, because Miracle lays down quiet in the footwell and turns his head to rest his chin on the seat in front of Dean’s face, so all Dean can see is big brown, shiny eyes and wet, black nose.
“He,” Sam takes a deep breath. “No. He drank too much,” he doesn’t know how to tell her about the pain meds. “And he – we found him in time. The doctor says he should be okay.”
Dean fumbles the key in the lock of their hotel room, but the latch finally flashes green and Dean all but kicks the door in.
“This here is a slow song, so that’s real simple,” Dean explains. “And you gotta learn the guy part if you ever wanna do it proper. So, your hand goes on my waist – on my
“I have to make a couple stops. Get your prescriptions filled,” says Sam. Dean’s stomach squirms. He hadn’t thought about drugs. He was just focused on getting out. “And get you something to eat.”
“Yes, please,” Cas says. His tongue, just the tip, sneaks out of his mouth and runs along the edge of his bottom lip, leaving behind a sparkling sheen of saliva.
“More or less,” Billie says. “Sam is able to fight back, but not for long. You’ll have to act quickly.”
The weekend is awesome. The oppressive heat and humidity of mid-July gave way to dry heat and clear skies into the first week of August. Dean spends most of Saturday outside in the park across the road from his complex. He gets a sunburn, and when he returns to his apartment, he finds he forgot his phone, and there are about 20 increasingly distressed texts from Sam and several missed calls.
Sam makes a dissenting noise, but Caleb disrupts the awkward moment. “You got your own place? That’s great to hear, Dean.”
He hears the deck door open behind him, letting a clash of laughter and music from the party within spill into the quiet of the evening. Dean turns, expecting a waiter on their smoking break, or maybe Cas looking for him, but, instead, he’s surprised when he spots the bundle of white dress that precedes Anna’s entrance.
Dean doesn’t look at his brother. He doesn’t look at Cas, either, and Cas feels like something’s somehow been broken. The easy intimacy and comfort he and Dean had drawn over the past few days crumbles in the wake of this betrayal that Cas hadn’t even fully realized was a betrayal.
“Yeah, well,” Dean shrugs. “Their loss, man. If Cas and I let a little stab wound get in our way, we’d never have gotten to where we are now.”
He already has a pretty good picture of what went down, and he doesn’t like it – in fact, he hates it. He hates it so much he wants to take those old cuffs he found in the basement of the Roadhouse and secure Sam to the radiator, so he can’t ever leave the apartment again. But, even if Dean already suspects what happened, it’d sure be nice to hear it from his little brother or best friend.
“I’m not going to stop you from doing what you think is best,” Eileen starts. “But I need you to think about yourself, too, alright? What do you need, Sam?”
But that is not something he can possibly say aloud, so, still, he protests, “I cannot leave. Anna and Alfie….”
“It’s the second hit like it inside a month,” Sam answers. “Families living outside of the city limits, somewhere isolated. No ransom notes, but that doesn’t mean the kids aren’t still alive.”
your takeaway from this conversation? More bullshit excuses about how you’re not a fucking addict? Cause, I’ve got news for you, that’s what a fucking addict would say!”
He’s got Sammy’s sandwich made, on a plate, and stuffed into Sam’s hands in a jiffy. There’s a warmth between his ribs that he hasn’t felt in a long time while he watches Sam take a bite and hum in appreciation. It feels right: Dean taking care of Sam, for once. For a little while, it’s the way it’s supposed to be again.
Dean doesn’t even realize that Benny’s anecdote has ended to polite applause. That the crowd is dispersing through the pews and wending toward the back doors and the promise of caffeine.
“Jesus, Cas, I didn’t wanna make you apologize,” Dean says. It’s all messed up. Dean messed it up. He can’t ever have a normal fucking conversation without messing something up –
you two are roleplaying Florence Nightingale without me.” She bends over Dean and plants a kiss on his forehead. Before he can protest, she says, “Don’t get mushy, I’m just checking your fever.”
“Thanks, Ellen,” Dean says, stopping to give Ellen a one-armed hug. Ellen squeezes him back and gives Emma a peck on her wet cheek.
Dean recognizes Lydia as soon as she walks through the door. Not from their one-night-stand – he was too drunk to recall anything more than long auburn hair, lots of warm skin, and piercing gray eyes – but from the meetings afterward when he surrendered custody. He also recognizes Toni Bevell, Lydia’s lawyer. She’s cold and sharp as an ice pick, and she’s dressed in a crisp suit that looks like it walked off the pavement of Savile Row.
Layla asks him afterward if that was his girlfriend, but Dean sends her another wink and says, “Thought that was you, sweetheart.” It makes Layla laugh, which makes Dean feel better.
Dean’s stomach is in knots as he navigates the city streets in the impala. The Amazon is easy enough to spot, even if it’s crowded among all the other fancy-schmancy restaurants and boutiques. He finds a parking spot a block down from the entrance; it’s the lunch rush and there are plenty of suits driving from their offices to order $20 salads and quinoa bowls.
There are two more headless vamps on the ground, one each from Sam and Cas, figures spilling dark blood from the stump of their necks and detached heads sitting around like bowling balls.
Dean feels cold. There’s a lump in his throat, but he swallows hard and says, “That’s not an issue. I’ll do what I need to.” And he doesn’t think about Cas. He can’t think about Cas. Dean’s made his choice: this is about Emma, now.
“Dean,” Sam hisses. He forces himself to reach out his hand and touch his brother’s shoulder. He is terrified Dean is dead. He is terrified his fingers will find cold, stiff flesh, or perhaps sink into a rotten, putrid corpse. “Dean, please…” Sam’s throat closes in on itself. His eyes burn.
