“Thank you.” John took the bottle back and upended it. Seeing how far gone it was, John felt the itching suspicion they’d done something a bit not good. “Did we… Have we finished a whole bottle of scotch by ourselves?”
John snorts at this, perfectly able to picture a small, curly-headed Sherlock responding to an unwanted kiss with verbal harassment. “You seem to bring that out in people,” he notes, raising his leg to rub his foot along Sherlock’s.
On his way home that night, or early morning, depending how you looked at it, he purposefully avoided wondering why he felt the need to engage in the sorts of acts he’d engaged in these last few weeks. He was having fun, he told himself, and as long as his school work was taken more seriously, no one could have any objections. Right? Uni was all about growing up, experimenting, finding out who you were and what you wanted, and wasn’t that what John was doing? He’d been having a grand time of it and he saw no reason to stop.
If the situation weren’t dire, Sherlock would never stoop so low, but desperate times and all that. He pulled his mobile and hit the speed dial.
They stepped inside and John shivered with the temperature change, shaking off the December cold as he wiped his feet.
. It’s not uncommon for kinesthetic learners to fall behind simply because teachers aren’t aware of the disability, and therefore have no understanding of how to better adapt their teaching styles to include them. The fact that you made it to Uni itself proves you are incredibly intelligent, resourceful, and dedicated. I applaud you, truly.”
"Take him to the loo," she hissed when he approached. Her brow seemed trying to convey a suggestion that he utilize the time wisely.
say?” John’s eyes met Sherlock’s and held, his tongue started to peek out but he recalled it back, as if aware of the habit and its effect on Sherlock. The space between them grew quiet but heated. In the periphery, Sherlock was aware of the pounding bass emanating from the club, but it took second chair to the pounding of his own pulse. John was working something out, coming to a conclusion, and the outcome would change Sherlock’s life.
“I saw you, right here,” he pulled his hand away from hers to set his fingertips in the space between them, “with David last night.”
Sherlock’s blue-green eyes are trained up at him, his lips stretched wide around him, and damn if he doesn’t look more debauched than he had done when John was doing the same for him. He takes his hand and tilts John forward by his arse, telling him without words that it’s okay to move if he likes.
John seemed to thrill at this bit of snark. He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock hard on the mouth. He pulled back just far enough to whisper, “That would be a shame.”
“Nothing in here is going to stab, burn or bite me, right?” John questions, only after tugging the blanket over their heads.
They drive in silence for another half an hour before Sherlock mumbles to himself, drawing John’s attention from the passing cacti highlighted in the fog lights.
That was the only reason why he found them; the little white dots on already pale skin, clustered under Sherlock’s inexplicably caramel coloured leg hair. John found his thumb running over them in curiosity; not in confusion, he knew what they were, but out of some attempt to feel the reality of them for himself. Sherlock was eighteen years old, he had no business having these scars. Junkies had these scars, addicts years in the making had these scars. Not brilliant kids just out of Uni, on their own for the first time. His brother had left him alone with a middle aged woman, who habitually smoked weed for fuck’s sake, knowing this. He
John picked up the tiny bird skull again and looked it over. Such a strange memento, bleached white and so fragile, but it seemed fitting for such a strange encounter. His fingertip traced the tiny beak as he contemplated nothing at all.
John could barely breathe at that point. Only Scarlett’s return, her insistent tugging on his sleeve finally pulled John away.
Experimentally, John pushes forward and back, and an explosion of new sensation runs up from his cock. There’s a drag that’s so perfect, so intense, John knows it’s all over.
“Oh,” Sherlock muttered, cowed. He replayed the scene and realized John had missed the important parts. John’s reappearance had thrown Sherlock off his game somewhat. He honestly hadn’t expected the man to return after the information Sherlock had uncovered; that bleached, horrified look on John’s face as he’d walked away had been fairly telling.
Sherlock looked around but his eyes came back to John’s in confusion. “I- I thought you weren’t coming back,” he whispered, trying to sit up further.
John’s eyebrows went skeptical. “All right, if you say so.” He backed up so Sherlock could stand, and it was then that Sherlock noted the brace on his hand.
The loo was dark but even a quick glance told John Sherlock wasn’t hiding in there either. Not in the kitchen, or on the sofa or under his bed or in a cupboard. The only other option was the upstairs bedroom, in theory soon to become John’s bedroom. He hoped Sherlock hadn’t walked upstairs on his bad ankle, but he must have, the idiot.
“But you get on. Were probably closer before you quit rugby but he didn’t begrudge you that. Why don’t you go out together more?”
“I would willing bet my arse, believe me,” he drawled and tugged at his hair in frustration. “Owwff,” he huffed when John landed heavily on top of him, fully nude and writhing.
“You’re sure?” He hesitated to leave on that note, but yet again, he’d been backed into an impossible corner.
Mary turned to Janine and whispered, "Watch the door. Don't let anyone in here or in there with them before I'm done."
Sherlock knew it wasn’t the case, but just then it was like the entire pub had heard and had gone silent. One would think he'd already reached the lowest point in his already low experience with John's vehement denial, but never let it be said that John wasn't willing to get creative with his whips and lances.
John ignores that, just slides until his back is to the door, mostly so he can keep the men outside in his sights, but he also takes the opportunity to study Sherlock in the low light. Sherlock studies him right back. Lord knows what he’s seeing. John tries to keep the memory of his immense fuck-up off his face, but it’s possible Sherlock can read it from the way his stomach growls, or the way his hair has fluffed up in the wind.
“I meant, yeah I was, but I wasn’t doing it because of Mary.” When Sherlock cocked his head questioningly, John explained. “I was looking for this. What we’ve got,” he kissed Sherlock again, “and it drove me crazy, not finding it again. I mean, yeah I was having fun, but this, this is different.”
The blood drained from John's face, his expression melted away as the realization of where they currently were, all that it meant, dawned on him.
Sherlock cries out above him, and grabs at John’s shoulders absently. John ignores him and continues to explore the shape of him with his tongue, one hand working the base, the other exploring thighs and stomach and chest. For such a skinny git, Sherlock’s actually covered in muscle. John sucks gently but with increasing speed, letting his fingers trace Sherlock’s bicep, letting his eyes wander as well, to watch Sherlock pant and clutch at John like a lifeline.
One of Sherlock’s hands came up and slapped at John’s shoulder. “For god’s sake, John, that was months ago! I barely knew you then!”
“No. Does that surprise you? Did you think we had been shagging the whole time he was married and living in Ealing?”
He watched as the amber liquid was poured, a perfect two fingers in each glass. Already, the aroma had reached across the table to John’s side, causing saliva to pool in his mouth. Flashbacks of his uncle’s den passed in front of John’s mind, his sister and her friends egging him on to chug the bottle of hundred quid scotch. He’d choked most of it out and gotten his arse beat for his troubles. He hoped this experiment went better.
It just pisses John off even more. He breezes by without another word. Not washing his hands feels like a rebellion, though he’ll probably wash them when they get home- when they get back to Baker Street.
“Of course they won’t. You’d have to be mad to,” he said with a pointed look. Being dark, wet and freezing didn’t mean no police though. If anything it probably upped the chance of running into the fuzz, as they kept an eye out for real criminals looking to utilize Sherlock’s very excuse.
They clinked glasses and took their first sip. Sherlock’s went down smooth, the air of a man well-versed in aged whiskey. Of course John wasn’t so well-versed.
John learns a few new things about Sherlock, some good, some bad, but finds regardless, he's in too deep to ever walk away.
John ran to the window and just managed to catch Mycroft hustling Sherlock through the front door. He could hear Mycroft consoling Mrs. Hudson in the entryway, and then the thump of Sherlock running up the stairs.
John pecked him on the lips. “Not at all, she seems perfect. Christ, she’s cooking breakfast! You’d have to push me out the door to get me to leave.” At that he rolled away toward the end of the bed.
John glanced up, looking hopeful, a small hesitant grin forming. Why? Sherlock replayed the moment. Oh.
“I trust you to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Sherlock answers absently, also turning onto his side to watch John remove the bullets.
He pulled away reluctantly, just enough to look into those dazed eyes. In the dark he couldn’t discern the exact colour and for some reason that bothered him.
The Globe unknowingly lost one of its greatest actors when Sherlock responded with, “No. Should I?” He could only hope John didn’t know MI-6 tactics on how to spot a lie by visual cues.
“Here you go, dear,” he said and handed the bear over. She giggled and squeezed it to her chest, though the thing was easily three fourths her size. “You satisfied with that? Cause I don’t think we’ll fit another on the tube.”
He didn’t wait for John’s reaction, though it was obvious when John didn’t stop him from stomping down the stairs that he didn’t feel compelled to continue their conversation.
“John,” Sherlock groaned, a warning and a plea both. His hands gripped the sheet in his fists and bit down so hard on his lip that he once again opened the cut there to fresh bleeding.
They quickly hopped out of the car and jogged over to where the other constables had gathered. Sherlock wedged himself in between two others and no one seemed to question his appearance. John hung back just behind as the constable in charge went over what had happened, where they believed his location to be. A police helicopter was already in the air, circling the area with its spotlight. John only just followed the train of the conversation, despite his best efforts, as his focus seemed to be on his conversation with Greg and the one before with Sherlock. Was he sexually repressed? Did it matter? It’s not like his and Sherlock’s sex life was going to suffer if he didn’t let Sherlock have his way with him up against the a filthy brick wall where anyone could happen by…But if it was something Sherlock wanted to do, something that turned him on, shouldn’t he at least try? Now that the cat was out of the bag, so to speak, he felt a little pressure in his chest ease up, like the fact that Greg knew made the idea of getting caught a little more palpable. Sherlock was right, he was repressed. He’d let plenty of his girlfriends talk him into fooling around in public before. Hell, he’d fingered Alisa, the last girl he’d slept with, on the tube the morning before they’d broken up. It was the thought of being caught with a bloke, the disgust he feared seeing in the eyes of anyone who might happen by, a fear that could be laid at the feet at Peter Browning’s father, that kept him from trying. Christ, Sherlock was bloody scary sometimes. But Greg’s words had lifted a fog, like he could take a deep breath and relax for the first time in weeks. He was in a relationship with the man he loved, who loved him back ferociously, and they were in a perfectly healthy sexual experimentation phase of the relationship, for Sherlock’s benefit he reminded himself. Not to say necking in public was acceptable, not to mention legal, but if that was something Sherlock wanted to try, he needn’t shy away at the idea in horror.  All he could hope was when the time came to inform Sherlock of his resolution he could actually go through with it.
Sherlock looked up at this remark and saw John standing there in his coat holding a small baby wrapped in a thick pink blanket.
From Jen’s position on Sherly’s shoulder she could faintly hear the detective’s heartbeat. It was comforting to know that she was still there, even though she was quite warm. It was making her sleepy.
“Sherly,” he greeted her, “I was about to ring you. There’s been an explosion and I thought you’d like to look into it.”
Sherlock sat on the couch, as he often did when he was bored. John was currently making tea in the kitchen. It was a Sunday. A holy day, in most Catholic societies. However, neither John nor Sherlock were religious. At all. Thus, when John finally sat down next to Sherlock with his cup, the first thing he suggested was to turn on the telly. Although Sherlock thought it was incredibly dull, it was really the only thing that they could do.
On top of the roof stood Sherlock, looking down at John’s crumpled body. The consulting detective felt as though his heart was on the ground with his only friend.
Jen sighed. She could tell Sherly was annoyed now, which was the last thing she had wanted. Jen got up and went to make tea, so she didn’t have to sit there and argue with Sherly anymore. The detective stayed on the couch with her arms crossed, sulking because Jen wouldn’t agree with her. Sherly knew it was childish, but at the moment she didn’t care.
Jen sighed. “Are you sure he just doesn’t want your help because he misses you? Or maybe because he won’t pay our bills forever, so you need a real job?”
Sherly wiped the tear away gently, sliding her finger over Jen’s skin. Then she wrapped her arms around the shaking woman and pressed her lips to the blonde hair that smelled faintly of tea.
When the smell of chlorine was gone from her skin and it had been rubbed raw by her scrubbing, Jen turned the water off and stepped out of the shower. She dried off and emerged from the bathroom wrapped in a towel. She slipped back to the bedroom and spotted Sherly lying on the bed. “Your turn,” Jen said, jolting Sherly from her thoughts.
Sherly nodded and stood, helping Jen up. They walked to the kitchen, Jen keeping close to Sherly for comfort. Sherly opened the fridge and looked inside taking a quick inventory of the food that was there.
"All right then. Keep the demands to a minimum." He rewarded Sherlock with a second finger, stretching the tight muscle as gently as he could.
“They’re more acclimated,” Sherlock points out sensibly. “Londoners have no business in the desert.”
“Would you be pressing charges for the assault?” The officer asked Sherlock, nodding down to John’s injured fist.
John shuffled uncomfortably, hands fidgeting with his coat hem. “All right," he swallowed, “I'll grant you that but it doesn't mean we just... That." He seemed to come to a realization, a point in his favour. “And anyway, you only ever want me when you're high. What does that say?"
John reached the top of the stairs to find Sherlock standing, balancing on the post at the end of his bed.
They’re back onto the road, kicking up dust in their wake, before John remembers the gun in his hand. He drops it to the floor of the car and sits back. A giggle escapes; his adrenaline is coming down, leaving him giddy. To his surprise, the man seated next to him starts giggling too, albeit a much deeper, masculine chuckle.
talk Sherlock through it, just like last time. He really did love it when John went Captain Watson on him. He tried to think of something to say but all he could think about was the times he'd tossed off to that picture of Victoria Beckam that he'd stashed in his bunk. Sherlock probably didn't want to hear about that.
“No, I didn’t but I’m not surprised.” Her voice flitted around the sitting room, dusting most likely, damn her. “That boy could do anything he put his mind to, I’m sure.”
“Don’t spoil your appetite,” John commanded as he set the plate of biscuits down in Sherlock’s lap, taking one for himself.
“Nothing like that. Least not that I know of. It’s just that, I never would have said it before, mate, but I never liked Mary. She was always trying to tell everyone what was what. Always came off a little bit holier than thou, if you know what I mean.”
“That’s not very nice, John,” he whispered into the dark upon seeing the scribbled out moniker he’d given The Woman.
John shoves him off with a laugh. “Don’t know about how much rest we’ll get, but yeah, let’s move this to a more comfortable venue.”
“Not the point. I wanna know what it is. If you make me go I’m not going to tell you,” she threatened.
Everyone started at the dry announcement. John whipped around to find Mycroft standing casually behind him, resting against that absurd umbrella.
"If it makes you feel better, I can pretend like it was today when you yelled through the door like a teenager caught with this first lad mag."
Everything went still, John simply stared back at him, calculating. It terrified Sherlock; he could feel his heart racing, his breath sawing in and out, clouding the air in obvious white puffs.
John tried not to let his amusement show but he could feel his cheeks shift with the effort suppressing his grin. His face probably conveyed every bit of
supposed to live like that!” Sherlock finally snaps. John is too shocked to react so Sherlock continues. “We pine and we live in agony but.
“You are not a psychopath or sociopath, Sherlock. You’re one of the biggest bleeding hearts I know.” His lips twitched when Sherlock whipped his head over to stare at John in horror. “You are, you can’t hide it from me. Hell, the only reason you threatened me with crispiness this morning was so I didn’t mess with the evidence from that cold case you somehow weaseled from Greg. Don’t think I don’t know about that. Puzzles, you call them, but I see a man who is willing to help because he’s the only one who can.”
. A case worth pursuing. It had been months since his last, one worthy of John’s attention anyway. Sherlock had been waiting for something good, something to sink his teeth into and tear at, something that wouldn’t net John another girlfriend like the first damned case he’d taken his partner on. He couldn’t wait to meet the individual in question, this ‘better class of criminal’ that had ensnared Irene Adler of all people.
“Yes. A partner to help with my cases would be… it would be very helpful,” Sherlock eventually mumbled. His shoes took up most of his concentration as he waited for John to respond.
The inflection in Sherlock’s voice gave the impression there was an alternative and it caused John’s ears to heat. He prayed the man couldn’t tell, or if he could that he wouldn’t follow the train of thought.
“Please, please, please, oh, Christ, yes!” He held up a battered and worn silver foil square triumphantly, grinning like he’d won the sex Olympics. Sherlock found it quite flattering.
John’s spine hurt from trying to remain upright, so he melted back against the cushion. “We’re not worried about ourselves, Sherlock. The point is
it, all so Sherlock could squeeze just an ounce more freedom from his mysterious brother- but… he couldn’t say no. He just couldn’t.
John obliged, hollowing his cheeks around the fat cock end, fist pumping double-time along the shaft.  His left working his own harder as well, simply getting off on getting someone else off.  When Bernard began to swell against John’s tongue he mentally prepared himself. He hadn’t yet found a correlation between bollock size and the amount of ejaculate, but one could never be too sure when it came. He’d not go out by choking to death on semen in the toilet of a gay bar; his mother would have a fit.
Sherlock thought about that list John had given, his evidence of Sherlock’s rejection, the evidence of John’s
“Right.” John looks up at the stars and lets the worry melt away for a minute. Sherlock is so quietly competent, John finds that he’s missed it more than he’d thought - being able to lean on someone again, knowing they have your back.
But John wasn’t a cruel man. He sunk back down, laving attention around Sherlock’s crown. Sherlock made a noise thereunto unheard, and John hummed in pleasure, chuffed that even though he was the one with a mouthful of cock, Sherlock was the one who had finally shut the hell up. Sherlock, fearful of the threat of John’s disappearance, was on his best behaviour. His hands clamped down on his thighs and stayed there, his hips didn’t as much as twitch. John found it adorable, but he knew better than to say so. Good behaviour deserved to be rewarded though.
The carriage slowed, the end of the line. They stood, hand in hand, as the train slid to a stop and the doors opened.
Sherlock let his hand fall with a thump onto the table and finally turned to look at John with a sceptical eye. “You expect me to believe it’s nothing to do with you defending your heterosexuality?”
We switch over to Sherlock's POV in this chapter.  Sherlock finds the next student in need of tutoring is the exact last person he expects. Idiocy is the nicest description for his next move.
“No,” Harry drawled. “Rami was the first official ‘I’m-kissing-a-boy’ kiss, but you kissed Jeremy Norway during Easter dinner at the Community Center when you were six. Remember? Mum started crying, ‘Oh, my son’s a poof’, and dad had to drag us all out to the car with everyone watching.”
"I thought the rumors were just that, but here you are. Impressive," Sherlock allowed. "I suppose the same is true for you as well?" He asked Janine.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed in mild surprise. “I thought about borrowing a ladder so I could chip away the rest of the Middle East but Mrs. Hudson would likely not approve.”
“Never fucking mind, shut up, I’ll do it.” Miller snatches Sherlock and proceeds to pat him down. John knows he’s in too deep when just the sight of this ponce touching Sherlock’s waist, hips, and thighs put him into kill mode. If John’s reading the look Sherlock is giving him correctly, he’s not being subtle about his feeling either. He tries his best to settle before the men notice his rage.
“Your hands told me you were a doctor. Dry from multiple washings with antibacterial soap, nails clipped short with regular maintenance. You’re bearing, hair and tan told me you were prior military, recently returned from deployment. Discharged from an injury, as evident by your limp. That’s psychosomatic by the way.”
“I see that idea isn’t off the table,” the man remarks, watching as the fluid drips down the side of John’s stomach.
Sherlock watched as John puttered around in the kitchen, a new sort of warmth blossoming in the face of this domesticity. This was their home now. Their shared space. He’d succeeded in luring John into his web (possibly the wrong connotation but still apt) and now they would surely find a natural rhythm, a fusion of selves so seamless as to be irreversible. It was inevitable. Or, at least, Sherlock would make it so.
“About ten years,” he corrected as he stared up at the ceiling. Ten years since his last coherent sexual partner anyway, but he didn’t want to say that to John. “I’m clean, but I know you’ll never just take my word for it.”
Sherlock makes a previously unheard noise when John takes him in hand, almost a noise of surprise. John smiles up at the man, though he’s not looking just then, busy arching up at the ceiling, just before he lowers his mouth down to taste for the first time.
A toothbrush and small tube of paste; packet of crisps: empty; four differently sized skeleton keys; a small child’s neon green rubber ball; a lockpicking set; a notebook written in a code John couldn’t decipher; pen to go with the note book; four hundred quid he found hidden in the lining; and a small bird skull. The last John set aside on his nightstand to study at his leisure. Such a strange person but… John couldn’t wait to talk to him again.
“Listen, I know you said you were busy with studying and helping Sherlock, but I was thinking, if you just let me know whenever a good time is for you, we might try out that new Thai place in Hoxton, the one Gail was telling me about. What do you think?”
He looked up, met John’s eyes as he leaned down to swallow as much as he could right off. And almost lost John to gravity as he flung his head back in pleasure. Sherlock had to yank him back with an iron grip on his jumper.
“No. You wouldn’t have even made it to MP before you quit. You would have run off to become a dog walker in New Zealand or something equally ridiculous.” John laughed at that. “Glad to see this concoction of drugs hasn’t dimmed my ability to read people. Could be sharpening them if anything.”
John stared as Bernard stomped off, a look of disbelief writ across his face, one that quickly morphed into that blistering rage he’d held onto since their fight.
He thought about seeing if he could convince John he was really psychic, but that would just be mean. Instead, he took John’s hand and turned it this way and that.
John looked at Mary then, eyes glancing off the pistol in her hand, complete with silencer no less, and looked her right in the eyes. She smiled sweetly.
“No. No no no no,” John whispered in a horrified clip. He rushed to tug Sherlock’s trousers up and was slapped six ways from Sunday when he tried to mop up the mess he’d made on Sherlock’s back with the tail of his shirt. By the time they had their clothes fixed Lestrade was casually walking inside. He stopped abruptly and after a four second scan of the floor(pencils still strung about), Sherlock’s shirt(buttons missing), John’s flaming face(cherry tomato red) and the state of his desk, he took a deep breath and let it out slowly in barely concealed rage, one that seemed aimed more at himself than anything, as if he was telling himself he should have known better. John felt his progress had come a long way since being caught by Peter Browning’s father. He didn’t cry this time at least.
“But…” John struggled to find his argument and Sherlock found he was quite fond of the look. Indignation, surprise, frustration, and begrudging respect all rolled into one. It was possible Sherlock would never tire of teasing John Watson. He’d have to test the theory.
"He's letting himself get chatted up by a bridesmaid," Greg drawled, to which Molly responded with a 'see?' head tilt.
“This won’t heal right if you get up and walk on it before it’s time. Am I going to have to take out your other leg just to keep you off of it?”
Instead of the middle aged gypsy woman John was expecting, there sat a younger, quite posh bloke in a bespoke suit, sans tie, with his feet up on the empty table. He was lovely- strangely handsome in a way that wasn’t classic or obvious but was quite simply striking, with his nearly translucent marble skin, black curls that begged to be tugged, and what appeared to be blue but could possibly be green eyes that followed like a hawk. His cheekbones were positively ridiculous but John still itched to touch. One certainly wouldn’t forget a face like that. And he sat with such an elegant grace that even in stillness you felt immediately that you were intruding on royalty.
The horror of their first time not being perfect nearly sent Sherlock into a spiral of panic, but then John whispered, “Can you imagine doing this for the rest of our lives?”
“Your eyes look like mine,” Sherlock whispered to the lead actor on the DVD case. “That might’ve come in handy.”
“What did you say, prick?” The pistol finds its way toward Sherlock’s temple and John’s fingers itch to reach for his own borrowed piece.
. Something people do when they’re not too busy giving in to the base urge to procreate.” Sherlock’s frown was evident even in profile.
did this," he replied, flicking his tongue lightly over John's bottom lip. "You did this to us. It could have been
“I don’t really approve, considering,” he hedged quietly, “but…” He couldn’t help but look away, nervous in this absurd crossroad he’d been handed. Sherlock was damn near acknowledging the ‘something’ between them. What John wouldn’t do to get him to at least admit it. Lord knew he couldn’t seem to do it sober.
John’s hand slowed on it’s way toward the milk. Sending Sherlock into the country would be detrimental to his sobriety. John had only known Sherlock for three months and he knew that. Sherlock needed the city to occupy him, needed the cases and his experiments.
John flinched and attempted to keep walking but Scarlett tugged on his arm, nearly sloshing his cocoa over his glove.
“I’m going to do some research when I get back to the dorm. I think you might be up for an award of some kind,” John quipped around his fried egg.
Sherlock smirked, giving as good as he got, and drawled, “You’re building your empire, Mycroft, I’m building mine.”
When he slid further down, his fingers lingering over Sherlock’s hips, dipping under the band of his pants, Sherlock inhaled and held, not breathing out until John looked back up with a smirk.
John met his eyes again and prayed his intent didn’t backfire horribly. “Have you ever been kissed?”
“Do you wish to simply catch up on cell regeneration, or would you like ongoing lessons in how to retain information despite your learning disability?”
They shuffled past the empty offices, clearly both nearing the end of their energy reserve, and sat heavily in the chairs in front of Greg’s desk. Sherlock reached out and snatched the tiny MU bobble head toy that sat on the desk and shook it petulantly. John tried not to smile and failed. Greg snatched it out of his hand on the way in and replaced it with a paper cup of coffee. Another was placed in front of John and, once he set the toy back in its place, sat down behind his desk with a huff.
An hour later, after much grumbling on John’s part and a lot of bitten lips and tongue tips on Sherlock’s, they finally agreed on a break. John practically ran for the loo, as if Sherlock had forbade toilet breaks. Sherlock rolled his eyes and checked his mobile for something to do with his hands. A blinking green light alerted him to a missed message.
He seems to get a kick out of this for a moment but then a frown appears. “Unacceptable, John. What if you get hurt? Distractions can be deadly.”
The last thing he remembered was John wedging the pillow under his head, tossing the blanket over them, and then absently throwing a leg over Sherlock’s arse.
he’s not afraid to let you know it. He’d be near insufferable if it weren’t for the fact that he’s actually a good tutor.”
They stared at each other, both waiting for someone to break. John looked away first but only to glance down at the notebook still tucked under Sherlock’s arm, then slowly over at the sofa. Sherlock could see him piecing the clues together.
John snorted. “All right. I’ll… think about this. Do you want to flag the waiter? I’ve lost my appetite.”
John and Sherlock looked at each other first. This was a bit different than lying about how they’d gotten into a suspects flat or how he’d gotten the bump on the head. This was covering up details of a murder. Sherlock gave a small nod and John agreed. They looked to Greg and spilled. An hour later, after explaining that everything they’d admitted to at the scene was true, only the seriousness of the accomplices timing was off. The actual murder had been an accident.
Sherlock groaned in frustration. “Later, I’ll explain later.” He thrust his bum at John as a not so subtle hint to continue. The pillow in Sherlock’s grip would have to be replaced, as he was fairly sure he’d already shredded the memory foam irreparably.
“I meant what I said. I hope the rest of your family is more accepting but if not I’ll find a place for you.”
Sherlock huffed from the top of the fence. “You’re lucky the designer was trying to give the illusion of security in this park,” he said with a grunt as John clasped his hand and hauled him up high enough to reach the top on his own.
“I’m not sure I could,” Sherlock admitted. His brain would surely be too busy going over the day’s events, filing, saving, taking them out to look at again. Not to mention planning for the future. He had to find some way to talk John out of joining the Army, or, barring that, offer favours to Mycroft to keep him from deployment. In all the excitement since the pub, Sherlock had forgotten all about Irene and her newly established cohort, the better class of criminal. Maybe there was something to that, something he could distract John with… Time would tell.
John grinned and made quick work of his pants and trousers. “Seems to me like I got over that sexual repression, wouldn’t you say?”
“That’s it, I’m done. Toss it, toss everything.” John stomped away, ignoring Mike’s call to return. Even if Laila was taking the piss about their breaking up, it had proven that Sherlock couldn’t care less what John did. He was done with all of it, the whole idea of Sherlock as more than just a flatmate. Hell, they were barely friends at this point. He’d certainly never mentioned Irene before…
Of course he remembered the name of the band in question, if not anything about them, but it wouldn’t do to admit that to John just yet. Might scare him off completely. “
“Absolutely not! The last time I went along with a scheme of yours he disappeared for a full day. No, I’m staying here and keeping an eye on him, like Mycroft said.”
John could be seen in his peripheral vision, shuffling. “I’ve been thinking. Lately. I need to, uh, see about getting a job.”
“Not technically inaccurate.” Sherlock runs his foot up John’s calf. “I was once kissed by a girl in primary school, before I had opened my mouth to inform her of her parents imminent divorce.”
“And this traumatic thing is linked in your mind to my kissing you?” John tries to see a link that doesn’t include being painfully assaulted but is coming up empty.
“Piss off.” John started to stomp off as well but Sherlock sacrificed kindness for efficiency and simply grabbed John round the bicep, hauling him out the back door and into the alley.
He replayed the scene again, tried to see it with the new data given, but still came up empty. “But I wasn’t the one leaving constantly.
“Jesus Christ and all his disciples,” Laila mock-whispered, “I can’t make this shit up.” John started to turn but she hissed,” Don’t look. He’s coming over. Just, uh,” she blinked, looking pensive and perhaps a tad worried, “just act natural.”
Greg stepped away from the tree, his shoulders back, looking ready to walk head long into battle. "We have to do something."
Just before he opens the door he remembers the cockstand he’s still sporting, and quickly tucks it up his belly, bunching the little bit of towel excess he has to work with in front.
, shag Sherlock Holmes. If the world had just ended and Sherlock miraculously acquired a working reproductive system and it was up to us to repopulate the Earth,
answer…” Pointed look. John didn’t want to point out that not everyone had a favourite bacteria. “My answer will likely change depending on the current roster of experiments but recently I’ve been studying
Sherlock was glad for the dark, because his smirk was uncontrollable.  He chewed on his lip to keep from laughing outright.
“Oh?” John licked his lips, tasting Sherlock there. “So when I was chatting you up that first night, and you were explaining that you didn’t do relationships-”
Christ, he was so deliciously flustered. Sherlock felt his pulse kick up a notch, knowing he had John at a disadvantage. He rose slowly and moved forward. John held his position, only his chin raising as Sherlock neared.
The kid pouted. “But you ruined my study of human nature, specifically that of embracing. Seems to me you should right a wrong when you’re able.”
“Now, John,” he commanded and then shoved off hard, nearly landing John face first in the dirt. They hefted the kidnapper just long enough to startle the accomplice, who came around the corner, gun drawn. He fired off two shots before they collided. John waited to hear a cry of pain but when none came he concluded that the shots had been absorbed by the kidnapper. If he wasn’t dead before, he was now. They dropped the corpse and scrambled to stay upright; Sherlock wasted no time plowing forward with his fist once they were righted, but the man must have an iron jaw because the blow glanced of bone and he barely reacted. Sherlock started ranting in Russian, clearly taunting the accomplice into making a mistake, when he set his sights on John.
Sherlock rushed forward and they fell into bed, laying the wrong way, but it didn’t matter, not with John’s hands clasped in his, not when John laid him down and pounced on top to stretch them out together. John’s thigh insinuated itself over Sherlock’s, his cock pressed insistently against Sherlock’s hip. He attempted to maintain his resolve, but for crying out loud, the thing was too entirely
“Too right,” John agrees as he shifts on the floor. “My shoulder is killing me. I’m too old for this.”
John, not far behind, continues to suck on Sherlock’s fingers until he’s gasping for air and his vision whites out.
John was shocked when, by the time Mrs. Hudson came around the corner, Sherlock had already conjured real tears with which to deliver a heartfelt, “We were attacked! It was awful!”
He was getting quite good at it, if he did say so himself. It was always a good sign when a girl started, to use the crass term,
John’s hand over shot and he tipped the sugar over on the counter. “Oh, piss!” He scrambled to right it; somewhat ironically scooping the spillage into the sink with the dirty flannel. He took a steadying breath, and swore, once again, to keep a cool head in the face of his instinctive craving for the git standing behind him.
Well, his night was certainly looking up. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been so sure she wouldn’t sleep with him until their third date…
Sherlock tossed the now lightly spotted alcohol pad in the cigarette bin and casually turned to listen, as if his heart wasn’t racing in terror. John could have been thinking about anything, but balance of probability stated it had to do with their previous conversation.
A frown pinched John’s brow, clearly remembering how gruesome a scene it had been. “You would, yeah,” he said cryptically. “No bowls of fruit for you.”
After a minute, when he noted that all had gone quiet, he cracked an eye open to find John staring at him from the doorway.
Sherlock stood, a bit abruptly, and took his cup to the sink to set it next to John’s. John turned in his chair to watch him move about the kitchen.
John's fists were balled, anger radiating out from every angle. He glanced back up at Sherlock from under his brow.
"I wasn't even invited to the damn party," Greg complained. "And you know what? I didn't ask either. I was hoping they'd get pissed and end up shagging till the cows came home but no,” he drawled, “they took a fucking case. 'Scuse my language, Mrs. H." She waved him off. "When I came to bail them out they still had all their clothes on. I've never been so disappointed to not see somebody naked in my life. If you get my meaning."
"Don't bother, you'll only hurt yourself," Sherlock snarls petulantly. "C'mon John." He then flounces off.
Sherlock bristled. “I should hope not.” He dug the scalpel into the lower half of the pancreas with the skill and menace of Jack the Ripper.
John tore furiously at the netted hood, nearly tearing Sherlock’s hair out in the process. He swore, frustrated, as he threw it to the floor, letting Sherlock have a mere second to breathe before he grabbed the sides of the tyvek suit and yanked. The zipper tore down the middle with a comical whir and John wasted no time yanking the top half away from Sherlock’s body. It pooled at his feet and Sherlock would have tripped over it if John hadn’t tossed him bodily over to the sofa. He twisted at the last second, trying his best not to land on his front, but it was no use.
John gave a great sigh but kept his opinion to himself. Sherlock was quite a contrary individual, easily doing himself great harm if he believed you were questioning his skills or conviction in some way, and John had learned early on not to provoke the beast.
“Oh yes, it’s me who’s the problem,” Mycroft snapped back, more petulant than John had seen from the man yet. John could see the resemblance now. Apparently upset that Sherlock had ruffled his feathers, Mycroft tugged his jacket down and set his shoulders back. “Mummy and Father send their regards from Spain.”
Eyes. Eyes were notoriously hard and he was years out of practice. Not that he’d forgotten the tips and tricks of making a symmetrical face but it was one thing to know it and another to recreate it with slightly trembling fingers. It was slowly coming together though, in the quiet of Baker Street, nothing but the kick of the ancient furnace and the occasional taxi gone by to keep him company. John was out, as was his wont when the odd friend invited him for drinks and football on the telly. Normal things that normal people did on a Saturday night. Something to balance out the irregularity of their usual activities he supposed.
"What brings you round?" Sherlock asks as John flops down in his chair seated across. He feels the familiar texture of the plaid upholstery and finally relaxes.
He’d been to Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen a few times in the month he and Sherlock had been friends, mostly to raid her fridge while she was gone, so he was comfortable traversing the flat without Sherlock at his side. Plus it was easy to follow the mouthwatering smells. He was quite hungry.
“All right,” he agreed unnecessarily. “Let’s move on.” He brushed past John and slid out of the van gracefully. With one hand on the top of the door frame he turned and looked in after John. “Coming?”
And then proceeded to do three perfectly executed turns on one foot. John watched, absorbed, arrested, riveted, hypnotized; use any word you’d like, he wouldn’t have been able to look away if a bomb exploded across the street.
It had cooled enough that he could sip easily and found, to his displeasure, that the mint blend was actually quite soothing to his upset stomach. John didn’t need to know that however, so after a few cursory sips, he set the mug back down.
"I'm not entirely sure actually. It's been a long time coming, this revenge. The whole taking John from you aspect has been exhausting. I should by rights blow both yours heads off right now. But..."
“I should have used your cane as a kendo stick and knocked them all unconscious. Perhaps rendered a few of them unable to father children, hmm?”
John rubs behind his ear and smiles when his sleeve comes away white. "I've got you to notice things like that for me," he teases.
With that parting shot he snatched John by the hand and pulled him down the hall, into the bedroom. John would have liked to have gotten a word in edgewise to his scheming pseudo brother-in-law about continuously putting cameras in their flat but he had more important things to occupy his mind.
He chucks the empty bottle in the backseat and pulls off onto the exit that signals the last rest stop for sixty miles. The sun is setting as he drives up, painting the landscape in red and gold, giving the squat building purporting to be a rest stop an otherworldly appearance. Then again, most things in the desert tend to look eerie to John, regardless of the time of day.
“Sherlock, when will you clear this table off so it can be used for its intended purpose? If I spill cream on something and it explodes you’ll only have yourself to blame.”
"Here's where John ignores obvious Military kink," he chucks a card, "here's where I get John drunk and he still can't commit to his actions," chucks another card, "here's where I point out how well John and I work as a team. You know, a well-oiled machine, one might say." He glared out over the crowd as if daring anyone to argue. Everyone in the room was too stunned to react, including John.
Greg was grinning proudly when Molly walked by. She leant in and whispered in his ear, "Play on his jealousy." Without further explanation she smiled, said hi to John and walked away. Greg belatedly noted that Molly smelled like rain and green things, but mostly he was trying to work out what he was supposed to do with that bit of information when John turned to him.
“Yeah?” John breathed, his tongue mostly occupied with other things - namely tracing the veins under the bloke’s tongue.
Greg blusters at Sherlock, working himself up to a real fit, but John can't be bothered to lend a soothing voice to the argument. He’s too busy still fretting over the blog post. When Sherlock sees it, as he inevitably will, John is now doubly sure he’ll glean a lot more from it than just romanticized drivel pertaining to the case. Perhaps he shouldn't have made reference to the way the wind would catch in Sherlock's hair when he ran...
“Yes, and without shoes no less,” Sherlock drawled, looking pointedly right back, at John’s socked feet.
He chuckled. “We already know what he’s going to say. Looks like the bloke has some spine after all.”
“Hmm, because I could praise both all night if you’d like. You’re simply too much, too bloody gorgeous, too bloody amazing, the things you see.” He licked up to Sherlock’s ear and whispered, “Part of me wants to force you onto your knees but another part thinks you might smite me for it.”
“How’re your chicken and sage? Mind if I try one?” Sherlock asked softly, as if unsure of his welcome. John could just puke at the falsely coy behaviour.
John pulled away, stumbling just a bit, Sherlock was pleased to see, as he turned toward the man at the front of the alley. Sherlock was directly behind, ready to pull John back if necessary.
Meanwhile, he watches Sherlock. It’s getting dark outside, the street lights have come on, changing the ambiance of the room. John vaguely thinks about starting a fire. He feels it might add a touch of the dramatic should the night turn in his favour, but more likely it would become a force of destruction should it turn against him. He tells himself he doesn’t, or shouldn’t, care either way.
He helps Sherlock up and despite the teasing, they’re both popping bones as they stand up fully. Unable to keep from touching each other for the short walk, Sherlock and John hold hands down the hall. Sherlock stops off at the loo to wet a flannel and wipe them down, which John is grateful for, and then they make it to the bedroom to strip and fall into bed.
He pinched the bridge of his nose as he moved away from the traffic of Marylebone. “I’m calling in that favour.”
“So, you’re actually a detective? You said this Oliver person was a drug lord, but you never explained how you came to be chasing him.”
the bastard?!" John was practically screaming at him, looking completely unhinged. Even so, Sherlock still noted how in his element the man was, on the verge of violence. "You just called me a coward in front of the entire guest list at my wedding and
John squints into the darkness, because, though they’re not lying that far apart, there’s no way Sherlock is actually staring at his mouth in contemplation. That would mean-
“Dammit, Sherlock,” Victor sighed. “It’s too late now. And, for your information, I couldn’t care less what you deduce about my father.”
“I’m done, Sherlock. I’m not playing this game anymore. I can’t. If you care for me at all, you’ll make this easier and just leave me be.”
John flinched. What the hell was he doing? He looked over to Mary but she didn't seem to care that Sherlock was about to 'wing' his best man speech.
“C’mon then.” John reluctantly got his shoulder under Sherlock’s arm and together they hobbled back down to the sitting room.
He easily deduced John was insinuating something about Sherlock’s face being the main culprit in John’s fracture but kept his mouth shut in case he inadvertently caused John to want to hit him again. He wanted John in top form if they were to begin boxing lessons.
Sherlock’s lips were as lush as they appeared, not that John had dreamed of testing the theory… much.
He received a snort at that. “Apparently I never told you about my two dads, or my gay cousin David or my bisexual mate from secondary school…”
“You don’t know that!” John whispered as loudly as he dared. “What if one of the other officers catches him before you do?”
John never would have taken food from Sherlock’s plate, especially something that he would have eaten. The whole situation was hateful; not only reeking of Lady and the Tramp, but making John feel like something was inherently wrong in the universe.
Super, mega thanks to ErirogPraborRishsh for translating the French in this chapter and chapter one! <3
"What are we toasting this time?" John asked with a laugh. Mrs. Hudson was so far into her cups she'd already toasted the Army, Navy,
Sherlock's first instinct was to snap out a scathing observation about John's intelligence but he refrained,
John was off the back of the cart before it even stopped. “Let’s split up,” he barked. “We’ll cover more ground that way.”
Air escaped Sherlock’s lungs in a rush, and he was glad for the passing lorry with the bad rotors, as it masked the sound.
“Now they think it’s likely you’ll come back for your things, if only to keep them off your trail. I can track them back to their base of operations this way, or force this one,” he nods up at the man at the rest stop, “to take us there.”
He waited but when nothing else was forthcoming, he asked, “That’s it? That’s your grandiose advise?”
“Yes, I see that.” John hears Sherlock set the laptop aside and move on the bed; his hair stands on end, sure that Sherlock is about to stand up behind him. “You’re so busy ignoring the fact that I’m half naked on your bed that you haven’t worked out
He keeps shoving it down until he can give a wan smile in return. "Yeah, I suppose. But I wouldn't say it was gay-"
Quietly, so soft Sherlock might have missed it if they weren't standing toe to toe, came, "Call me a coward again. I dare you." He stood his ground, the stance of a military man, but just behind his eyes Sherlock saw John's hesitation.  He knew. He knew what Sherlock was accusing him of and
They looked at each other and shuffled nervously, none quite ready to vocalize what they were all thinking.
“Did so,” John argued, sipping his own lukewarm tea despite his injury. “I would have eaten breakfast if not.”
“My only real concern would be lead based paints,” Sherlock went on to say. “Though low doses would probably be all right…” He trailed off with a careless, swirling hand motion.
The point being, John hadn’t attempted to find Sherlock even though Sherlock had given several sufficient clues for John to follow. Sherlock wasn’t the sort to play hard to get more than once; he could take a hint. John needed to branch out after the previously stifling relationship, he got that. It might have galled a bit, if he were honest with himself, but he respected it. John wanted multiple partners and Sherlock wasn’t one to share. At least, he didn’t feel like that was the case; he’d never actually been in a relationship. He did feel certain finding John with several cocks queued up after his evening classes was not what Sherlock was looking for in a relationship. Hearing John contemplate taking a man up the arse last night had driven Sherlock round the twist, and they’d only shared one intoxicated night together.
John frowns but rolls to his side to comply, thumbing the rounds out into his palm. “I’m risking getting dust in the clip like this, you know?” John remarks dryly.
“Oh, yes. Well… Mummy is a mathematician, so I suppose from your perspective, yes, she is a genius. Father… Father is not.” He seemed to think more on it.  “Mycroft is a smug bastard, Mummy is strict, and Father is oblivious. Between the three of them, it’s like my own personal hell. Holidays.” He shivered.
John thinks back to his last sexual encounter - a hasty mutual handjob behind the humvees with his CO, more than a year ago now. The last sexual encounter in a real bed, even longer than that. “It’s fine. I’m sure we’ll figure it out.”
John hadn’t even thought to worry about Sherlock until the next morning, when he discovered Sherlock hadn’t come home at all. The flat was still empty, nothing in his room had been touched, no food or drink prepared (not that that was unusual). Perhaps he had caught back up with Victor and they were making up? The thought didn’t set right, for obvious reasons, but not just those. Victor had seemed adamant, justifiably angry at Sherlock, and though he could be quite persuasive, John didn’t think Sherlock would stoop to that after his plan had backfired. So where was he? If Sherlock was in any sort of danger, John would never forgive himself.
John nodded and smiled, only passingly aware of what Sherlock was talking about. He might have been insulting him for all he knew. It was hard to concentrate when 84kg was grinding down on your prick. The excess slick smoothed the way spectacularly and John could only pray he didn't embarrass himself as soon as he breached the man.
A bit of teeth were introduced briefly before John pulled away to repeat, “Is there a line? Because I won’t know until I cross it. I want everything, Sherlock, everything. Do you understand?” He forced Sherlock to look him in the eye with a hand to his chin. “Everything.”
Laila met his eye over a bottle of Skyy vodka when she spotted him, and gave him a subtle nod. He didn’t want to respect her but damn if she wasn’t devious in a way he could admire. She’d played him like a fiddle and he’d resonated with each pluck. No wonder Mycroft wanted her for his team; he’d seen her potential before Sherlock had done.  He’d have to thank her one day for the foresight in keeping London’s heroin and cocaine dealers from selling to him. He’d been livid at the time but it was the right call and he was glad for it.
“Hoo hoo,” Mrs. Hudson gave her customary greeting before knocking the door open with an elbow. She came bearing, of all things, a gift box of what looked like rather expensive scotch with accompanying crystal tumblers. “Ta da!” She exclaimed happily, holding out the gift.
“Huh,” John huffs, mildly impressed. “That’s a neat trick I suppose. Do you take requests? I’d like to delete sixth form.”
Victor, instead of looking sheepish, slid a dark look at Sherlock, as if it were all his fault for not warning him beforehand. ‘Of course you set me up for that’, the look said. John fumed at the idea that he knew Sherlock well enough to be sharing looks.
John then found himself snagged by his coat collar and thrown sideways into a dark alleyway. His back slammed into the brick beside a filthy skip and then he was presented with a face full of snogging flatmate.
John wishes the dead coyote’s family would show up and eat him. Or maybe they could just carry him off and he can live amongst them as a member of the pack.
been crying, to his everlasting embarrassment, so he’d screamed that he was masturbating so she’d leave him alone. It had worked, obviously, but he had to wonder if the same idea applied here. Only backwards…
John’s hand clenched down on the thick canvas and a pain shot straight down his leg at Sherlock’s cool announcement. Now, if Sherlock hadn’t read almost John’s entire history on his person, he might have assumed Sherlock was insinuating something tawdry. But they both knew that wasn’t the case.
John straightened out of his crouch, wary, eyes tracking the unspoken conversation happening between himself and Mrs. Hudson, in which Sherlock’s ‘whose side are you on?’ guilt looks were met with ‘you try talking to him!’
“Of course,” Sherlock responds, a frown between his eyes. John laughs because he probably thinks everyone has that type of memory and just choose not to use it. “Their patterns are very distinct, John,” he explains.
Well, what did he say to that? Thanks? Too agreeable to her assumptions. Deny again? Doth protest too much. Silence seemed like a confirmation in itself.
. He tugs those curls in his fist and growls, which gets him a hiss and then a surge forward of Sherlock’s hips. The fleeting impression of hard cock is blazed into John’s arse and then it retreats. Well he can’t have that.
“I agreed to nothing,” John responded, lowering his head to nip at Sherlock’s collarbone again. “In fact,” a swipe of his tongue, “I think I would like to go slow.”
Molly chewed on her lip in indecision. It couldn't hurt at this point to spill, since they were all in agreement anyway. "I know why Mike's not here," rushed out, her lips snapped shut immediately after.
“Sherlock!” John yelped as the man’s legs went wonky for a long second and then fell hard on his arse. John dropped their dinner to rush to his side, where Sherlock groaned on the pavement.
When Sherlock rises from the table and moves toward his bedroom, John has a brief, intense panic attack.
Sherlock’s lip twitched in amusement but he didn’t let it blossom into a full smile. “John, where’s my laptop?”
John looked at her. “Why does everyone assume I’m in on the plan? Is it something about my face? You all think I’m a lot smarter than I
And so it was, as Sherlock found himself relaxing into slumber, it was John’s quiet tenor lulling him to sleep.
Sherlock’s stomach swooped, and then lodged in his throat - no words would come. John seemed to understand what he’d done regardless. Probably something to do with whatever Sherlock’s face was doing.
“Didn’t have whiskey. So sorry.” He took the joint from John and puffed away, not a care in the world.
“Oh, thank god you’re here,” Lestrade praised whomever had arrived, relief belaying the possibility that he’d contacted Mycroft. The two had crossed paths once or twice and the animosity was always palpable.
“Fucking Mary,” he growled. “Fuck everyone named Mary to be honest. They’re all slags. Every last one of ‘em.”
John pinched his nose and said his goodbyes. He knew she meant well, had never stopped believing John was arse-over-teakettle for Sherlock, not that he could blame her, but he had asked repeatedly for her to drop it. It was painful, not to mention embarrassingly pathetic, and god forbid Sherlock should catch wind of it. John had been turned down four times now…
The two ‘boys’ nodded and set off at a leisurely pace for the road, neither speaking in the darkness until they reached the light of the posts.
“No,” he answered. He had silently sworn not to do anything to anger John, within reason, lest he decide to go back to the dorms.
John looked far from being put off. He was silently laughing his arse off against Sherlock’s chest. They both heard when she shut the door and descended the stairs back to her flat.
Sherlock is making abortive thrusts of his hips against John’s and hard puffs of breath hit John directly in the ear. He bunches Sherlock’s shirt in his fists at his back and pulls him closer, if possible. Sherlock seems to be trying to pull John’s jumper off but they’re pressed together so tightly it’s a slow process; neither seem inclined to move far enough apart again to facilitate the maneuver.
“Yeah, I’m not sure about that last one,” he admitted with a scratch to his chin. “But he’s the best we have, that I can guarantee.”
Blessed darkness enveloped him once again and he sighed, curling against the down-filled case to protect it with his body. It was his only ally against the enemy ninety-three million miles away. His stomach roiled and rebelled but he didn’t think the pillow could help with that.
He looked John over, noting the tension around his eyes, the miles away he’d gone as he stared at the comforter. “Traumatic experience, obviously. Sorry.” Sherlock turned away in regret for making John upset.
John clutched the coat to his chest and made off with it like he had the crown jewels. John knew the kid from last night was smart. If he cared to come back for his coat, and John was sure he would, he’d have to come to John to get it, and he was clever enough to work out who would have taken it. All he had to do now was wait.
Sherlock huffed and puffed but in the end jumped up and made for the couch, throwing himself down again. “Ask me then.”
John opened his mouth to keep arguing but snapped it shut with a click. His face did that thing where it looked like he wanted to smile but Sherlock knew better at this point than to think it meant John was in a good mood. He, again, jumped at the silence provided.
Sherlock is surprised to find the soldier has returned and even more pleasantly surprised to find he's followed Sherlock home. Many more surprises ensue.
She eyed him and John felt the sneaking suspicion he should already know this answer. “My mother is from Lebanon…”
He found them, gesturing wildly at each other, Sherlock in the clothes he'd been in the night before, Laila in, god help him, John’s Rugby jersey, and little else...
God, it was probably all true. Every bit. He couldn’t be right about everything else but be wrong about that. But how did John break it off now without it being completely obvious why? He wished he knew more, about how Sherlock knew the things he did, where he’d gleaned the seemingly obvious information right off their clothes or demeanor.
Sherlock nodded his agreement. “Yes, as I was saying, I didn't think you'd actually listen when I instructed you to stay away. It wasn't until the day you came to Baker Street that I realized the message had been misunderstood, not ignored, but by then it was too late anyway."
"No! Michael is great! That's his daughter there," she points to her friend, who waves when they look, "Bea. She's great too. Mum's gone back to school to be a nurse."
John’s smile said he enjoyed this bit of knowledge very much. “Well, now you know. So there’s no need to be embarrassed. We were each other’s first.”
, his bastard conscience informed him after his stomach dropped. What did he expect? Tit for tat after all.
Hearing his name like that, breathy and pleading, did something to Sherlock's general ability to stay sane. He snatched John up, wrapped his legs fully around his torso and then walked them to a conveniently placed sofa. John didn't miss a beat, just hooked his ankles and continued snogging until Sherlock threw him down and leapt on top.
John noted, belatedly, that Sherlock’s hand fit the entirety of the back of his head, as he held John, forehead to forehead. Sherlock let out a satisfied sigh, and then moved back against the chair.
“That I love you,” he whispered back, the exhalation barely heavy enough to warm the sheet pressed against his cheek. He’d have been worried at the confession, if all of it weren’t a dream.
“Oh, for f-“ Sherlock growls when he sees John’s vest underneath the button down and John throws his head back and laughs at the man’s righteous indignation, but still rolls to help remove both shirts.
Before Mycroft could hang up John shouted, “Wait! He said he has a bolthole in Camden, a place you don’t know about. It’s where he went for Christmas. I don’t know if he’d go there now that I know about it but…”
“It’s late, Lestrade,” Sherlock interrupted before he could answer, “can’t we skip the formalities for tonight?”
“Bloody expired!” John shouted back. He shoved it at Sherlock. “See? Bloody 2008! How sodding long has it been for you? These things are supposed to be good for something like ten years!”
It lands like a blow, the reminder that it's not his tub, not his responsibility to keep Sherlock in line here anymore. He smiles, a small thing, a concession that, no, it's none of his concern; just a knee jerk reaction, a form of habit.
Horror seized Sherlock for a solid three seconds, during which he managed to chastise himself for getting caught, wondered how the hell he’d even managed to bollocks it up, and then swiftly formulated a plan of attack. He almost blew the whole thing by asking how the hell John had found him, but quickly moved past that line of inquiry. It didn’t matter
“I piss off everyone. Run-of-the-mill cat burglars, government assassins, black hat hackers, the odd terrorist organization, my family.” Sherlock shrugged. “I’m used to it.”
“Because I never cared to before. Until you. Yes, you are special, but don’t let it go to your head.”
“I get it, John, I really do but I still need to see at least some effort on your part. I should have warned you sooner, but your grades are already slipping and it’s not even mid-terms yet.”
John received an indirect sneer, the knob of Sherlock’s microscope was twisted roughly, but Sherlock didn’t reply, just continued to stare into his eyepiece. It was a bit like seeing a dog who’d got into the rubbish bin stick his head under the sofa, and John reminded himself that he was dealing with an emotionally stunted man-child with a over inflated case of self-importance - a fine line to walk when dealing with serious, emotional topics such as these.
“Is there a line?” John asked before he moved down toward Sherlock’s jaw line to suck hard at the long line of his throat.
"Hmm," she pretends to think. "Bit campy for my tastes. I've found you to be a nice mix of ridiculous and thoughtful."
John turned to his salad, if a bit zealously, and found it to be too busy; the flavours fairly smacking him across the face. Who put mint in a salad?
“An assistant position, yes. Also, if you’d like, I’ve decided to invite you to move in.  We would split the cost of living, and you’d be around more to assist me on my cases. It’s not a
After a beat, John mutters, “I would try to fatten you up but I know for a fact a packet of Hob Nobs goes directly to your arse and no where else. Would make the situation worse probably.”
“It’s none of my business, John, really. As long as he comes home at night, stays busy, and doesn’t blow up my building I rarely have a complaint. I just thought you should know. I approve completely.”
"Oh, that's so good, John. I could do this for hours," Sherlock panted and stretched to claw at the headboard.
Sherlock laughed, his smile lighting his face like Christmas morning. “How about this? You teach this to me and I'll teach French to you.”
“Call my ex’s? No,” John answered, setting his tea down to grab his phone out of his coat pocket. He ran through his contacts until he found the right one and hit send, thumbing the speakerphone option so Sherlock could hear the conversation.
"What's the matter with you?" John growled. "If you know what's good for you, you'll come in my hand right this minute."
“You know what I mean,” John snaps, and then takes a steadying breath. “You’re trying to help me, and I believe you really are after a drug lord, so… It just makes sense to help you.” He finishes with a decisive nod. Belatedly, John remembers the bullets in his palm, remembers he’s meant to be counting them. “Twelve,” he announces, thumbing them back into the clip.
Bill’s arms went wide, shower caddy swinging. “Am I not hot enough? I’ve had offers before, you know.”
As soon as Laila hit the doorway, John snapped to attention. He stood, resolute, and announced, “I'm done playing games. No more manipulation."
“Actually I was aiming for the ground at his feet but,” John admits with a shrug, not really that upset with the outcome.
"How is them not pulling their heads out of their arses end up being your fault though?" Greg wondered.
Sherlock hung up, knowing all too well where it was located. He’d thank Mycroft later, if John was in fact there.
“I was offering you a job, John. Or I was going to. You offered a more pleasant distraction from that attempt.”
.'" He snorted at his own assessment of John's character. "What a blind fool I've been. John isn't clever, or if he is, he's not brave or loyal. Can't be all three I'm afraid."
He’d wanted then; wanted to touch, to grip, to pull, to taste. But he’d held back for fear of rejection. It had already become apparent John didn’t touch the same man twice, but, oh, how he wanted. The best Sherlock could do was watch from afar and steer men of a certain caliber toward John, for his own safety.
They shared a small smile. Neither was fooling the other, that much was clear, but John did have to concede that he wasn’t exactly a world class boxer. He’d only won by the skin of his teeth, by accidently finding a chink in Sherlock’s armor.
Sherlock glances at John with a raised eyebrow. John has to bite his tongue or he’s going to lose it.
John slid him a side eye, not sure if Sherlock was telling the truth but having no real reason to think he was lying. He wasn’t looking at John to see the look anyway.
Greg looked at the body and then at John. His questioning glance asked John if Sherlock was covering for him. So, he hadn’t exactly gotten away with the Hope shooting. He’d have to remember to send Greg a thank you card for not arresting him that first night.  He answered Greg’s silent question with the downturn of his lips and the slight shake of his head. He would like to have taken the blame for his lover but the evidence would prove otherwise.
John didn’t let the lie stand. He immediately dove for Sherlock, hand diving with precision into the huge, ridiculously deep pocket of his coat. Sherlock cried out in panic and clamped a hand around John's wrist in protest. A battle ensued, one the likes of which only people with siblings could recreate.
“I don’t have to work until four,” John announced as he brought Sherlock’s tea. “There’s not much we can do with you out of commission, but we could play Cluedo or something. I saw you have it stuffed into the closet upstairs. And you can vent about your brother, if you want.”
Sherlock leant back, whether unconscious or not, John didn’t know. “With nobody.” John let a breath out. “I have a bolt hole there, the only one Mycroft doesn’t know about. I had to, lest he kidnap me for the holiday season. He wasn’t thrilled, obviously, but that was just icing on the cake as far as I’m concerned.”
Bernard didn’t even turn, so Sherlock gripped him by the shoulder and forcibly turned him. He wasn’t the least bit fazed by the man’s height advantage, which compared with John’s lack thereof was nearly comical. Speaking of John, his face went from pleased to livid instantly.
Molly grimaced to find during their adventure at the bar she had lost track of Mary, who was now chatting excitedly with Sherlock.
“C’mon. You got it? Here, lean up against- yeah,” John coached Sherlock into the foyer. “Gimme a second, I’ll be right back.”
His nails left half-moon impressions in his palm as he strode away from the flat, his mind whirring at near Sherlockian speeds as he planned ahead. There were possibilities available, avenues open to him if he were brave enough, fast enough.
If Lestrade was suspicious of their activities he didn't let it show. He'd learned that if he wanted to keep track of Sherlock and John, he'd drive his own car instead of taking a squad car. Sherlock refused to get into the back of one and John had never asked why. He didn't want to know.
The man opens his mouth but when the sound of tyres on gravel sliding into the car park is heard, he instead grabs John by his collar and hauls him toward the opposite wall. The long-legged berk uses the porcelain lip of the loo to hop up onto the top of the wall, and then looks down at John as if to say ‘what are you waiting on?’
“Yes, I do. Maybe that’s why I want this so bad”Stated, pressing his lips in John’s pulse point and kissing it lightly“And maybe that’s why you want it too. So, let’s spare us both from future frustrations and do this. So we can follow our lives without unbecoming distractions.”
“Or I could pay for a private dance and you could tell me all about your work.” John suggested and Sherlock smirked.
The waiter came with his whisky and John took a sip, concentrating his mind on the stage in front of him. The strippers danced around, rubbing themselves in the pole, twerking in the cold metal; some of them were sitting on others clients lap, or massaging their backs with more sensuality than necessary, but that was their jobs: being sexy and starting a few sexual crises.
Now John was approaching the club with his heart stomping his chest and so eager as he was going into the open field with only his gun and a hundred of enemies to him to kill.
“Oh, god… Yes, Sherlock. Of course. I would love it.” Affirmed and Sherlock smirked at him, going to the bathroom to wash his ass and getting ready for his rabbit hole being fucked SENSELESS OH YEAH! FUCK YOU, ELLIE!
That night when he entered the club, Sherlock grabbed his hand and dragged him to the private room that they were so used to stay in the last two months. The man had this spark in his eyes that made John think that whatever that he was feeling for the stripper was reciprocated.
He tried to think about the things that John loved the most in the world and two things came to his mind.
“Sherlock…” called John, trying to gain some self control even if his hands continued to travel the extent of Sherlock’s back “I can’t, you know that.”
John didn’t expected, at first, that that go to a strip club every Saturday would become an habit, however, it did. He was smitten with the detective/stripper and couldn’t stay away anymore.
John’s fingers entered slightly inside the black latex, catching the fabric and dragging it down, exposing the white and hot left cheek of Sherlock’s arse. That made John’s eyes darken and his mouth dry. He didn’t know how hard he was until he tried to move in the sofa, his trousers was so tight that hurt and he was in a intense struggle inside himself. He wanted that man. He wanted to give up of his honor, to give away to his primitive instincts, though he couldn’t, and thanked god that a knock in the door interrupted him from doing what he was about to do.
John walked to the bed and ended on his knees in front of Sherlock, tilting his torso forward until his face was millimeters from Sherlock’s “I love you, you know that, right?” Sherlock’s eyes found his and John couldn’t do nothing instead of kissing the mad man “I love you so much, you prat.” he repeated into the kiss.
“I’ll be here. Looking forward to hearing about the criminals you’ve already caught.”He stood up, taking his wallet in hands and gave Sherlock the money for the private dance“It was so good to meet you, Sherlock.”John said, approaching the stripper and kissing his cheek with fondness. He didn’t even know why he felt that way, but he did and he wasn’t feeling like hiding it.
Sherlock gasps. “Fancy hairdo! What-” He cuts off when the nerves John’s been holding onto break and he starts laughing hysterically. “And whose side are
John snarls as, yet again, the wind sends his map whipping over itself, nearly out of his grasp. He slaps his hand down and smoothes it, knowing fair well it’s only going to happen again - a battle between him and Mother Nature.
“Sherlock, a word,” Victor announced, slapping his napkin down onto the table. He stood and walked away, sure Sherlock would follow.
“That’s all right. Little weed never hurt anybody.” He glanced down at the swollen evidence to the contrary and chuckled. “Well, almost nobody.”
Sally answered a call and shot out of the car with a grin. "They got him." She pulled the radio and repeated the news to Greg.
“John,” she greeted with a smile, as if they hadn’t seen each other an hour ago, before she left for the kitchen to mix tomorrow’s scone batch.
John was staring, shifting his gaze between Janine and Molly. "Ah... Secretary... Administrative Assistant, something like that," he answered vaguely. Another swig. And then another.
John turned toward Mary, feeling only a slight twinge of remorse for being rude. “I take it you saw that?”
“Can we wait until I get my hand checked out first? If it’s fractured it wouldn’t do to go and break it further.”
Right around the time John hit the last step and burst through the kitchen door, they had suddenly switched to what he guessed was Arabic.
John couldn't help but smile. He took a deep breath, the weight of years of denial suddenly gone from his shoulders, and whispered, "What about high functioning sociopaths? Can I marry them?"
John gasped at the feel of it, those huge hands easily circling the whole thing.  Most of the blokes he’d been with had done fine but this was something else.
“You know Sherlock. Crime scenes...” John’s voice trailed off and Sherlock knew it was too late. He got to the sitting room just in time to see John and Mrs. Hudson looking down at his open notebook, open to the pages filled with a sleeping John.
“Heresy,” Sherlock announced, mock-serious. “This is a twelve year, single-malt Royal Lochnagar, John. You
John held up a hand as he walked by, not in the mood to explain. He was going back to bed and he wasn’t getting up until his date with Laila.
When no reply came he got up and walked slowly into the hall. He wasn’t sure if Sherlock was in the loo or his room so he stopped between the two.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft’s answering drawl made John’s blood boil. “Don’t be difficult. I advised against this for good reason. No good will come of it.”
John rolls his head to glance over, surreptitiously watching the man’s thighs flex in the remaining light of the day.
John finds his relationship has crumbled and, being a Uni student, his first instinct is to get pissed. The plan goes off without a hitch, until he literally falls into bed with a mysterious bloke with a serious case of snogable lips in need of snogging. John thereunto has no self control.
"I'll have you know I am the former landlady of the groom himself and if he knew how you were treating his guests, he would be appalled."
He frowned down at his watch. Two in the morning; the clubs would be closed now. Sherlock had not only been robbed of watching John at his craft, he had wasted precious time that could have been used gathering saliva samples. Why had John broken his routine? It made no sense, not logically at least. That meant it must be some emotional angle Sherlock couldn’t grasp. But he hadn’t caused it, had he? Was it that upsetting to John, Sherlock supposedly not remembering? Sure, Sherlock had been the first after John’s break from Mary, but that must mean very little in the grand scheme of things. He’d already deduced that from John’s actions of late, what with the myriad blowjobs and all.
John’s hand felt heavy in his hair, fingers curling in and scratching against his scalp. If he’d been awake, Sherlock would have moaned.
“What are you doing sexually experimenting at your age?” He asked. “Oh, found the lube.” He set that aside and went back to digging.
“Lillian Barclay,” Sherlock answers cryptically. The name seems to mean something to the mobster, his eyes widen slightly. “But by all means, if you find it best to leave us to the ravages of the arid terrain I’m sure you’re right. I’m sure Oliver trusts your judgement.”
Christ, his name sounded like something exotic when spoken with such a voice. Even if he was still being a dick.
"Oh." Mrs. Hudson looked down at her feet, her enormous hat dipped with the movement. "I think that might be my fault."
"Because you're pissed and if you're gonna get sick on yourself we'd rather you not do it in front of the guests."
John walked no further than the first few steps into the sitting room, looking from the sofa to the chairs in front of the fireplace, to the mantle.
“Sherlock, Christ, I’m gonna come. Oh, fuck.” He tries to pull away but Sherlock clamps down with fingers and lips both. He groans, a last attempt to warn, but it’s too late, he’s already shooting off, unable to stop his hips from snapping, driving his cock in and out of Sherlock’s throat.
“Well, good night then,” John said with a quick smile and a pat to the door frame next to Sherlock’s hand.
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” He asked as he crouched down to Sherlock’s level. He didn’t receive a response, so he tried again. “Hey, c’mon, sit up, you idiot.”
John laughed outright at that. His face fell into the pillow as he imagined Sherlock texting from the couch. It wouldn’t be the first time in the last four weeks Sherlock had lied to get John to rush over for something inane.
“Christ,” Sherlock quietly snaps, “would you listen? I have a lock pick sewn into my shirt cuff. Unroll the sleeve of my left arm and locate it.”
He’s not brought his clothes into the loo, they’re still sitting on the bed. His options are putting his old, dusty, sweaty clothes back on to go out in or wrap the too small towel around his hips and run for it.
John didn't bother asking how he knew something was wrong. “I'm not sure if we should worry just yet, but he didn't come home last night-"
His hand had finally grabbed hold of whatever it was, and when it gave in his grasp with a distinct crinkle and odour, they both stopped thrashing - John in shock, Sherlock in horror. He let John pull the offending object from his pocket. John looked down at the crushed box in his hand.
"No, I'm sorry, look!" Greg pointed toward the congregation in front of the church. "Those aren't happy tears, Molly."
John snorted at the thought as he tossed his coat over the back of his chair. He faced the doorway, casually resting his shoulder against the jam, and studied his flatmate. It was clear Sherlock knew he was there, was pointedly ignoring him. John figured the direct approach was best.
Sherlock did turn then, slowly, the violin dropped down by his thigh. John received a slight nod of acknowledgement but Sherlock wouldn’t even make eye contact with him.
John’s face went comically blank and then upon realizing this, went in the exact opposite direction by looking dramatically interested.
Sherlock walked swiftly by, noting their table as they removed their coats and sat. If Sherlock didn’t know better, which he certainly did, he would say John was having a great time. Was that reason enough to interrupt? He waited for something overt to happen, something worthy of interruption, so John could no longer mistake Sherlock’s intentions. He imagined glaring down at Lia with cold eyes, showing her her place, far away from John preferably. He imagined taking John by the hand and leading him away from goat cheese feta and olives toward the Thai place where Sherlock had once tripped a robber when he was thirteen. It was an amazing story, he was sure John would agree.
John is there in one stride, wedging himself between Sherlock’s spread thighs, and immediately angling Sherlock’s face upward to get at his mouth.
It seems to rouse Sherlock from his own musing, when he looks up and asks, “Do you really put that much thought into what my hair is doing while we’re running after criminals?”
Sherlock’s is hanging open, the dark red contrasting beautifully against him, and revealing seen but never touched, not ever in the way he’d have liked, pale tracks of skin from throat to hips.
He rolls to a stop, snatching his cane by rote as he exits the car. The gravel is tricky to navigate in his condition but mostly he ignores it as he wonders at the architecture of the building, the lack of a roof. It’s a nifty design, if a bit… exposed.
The rest of the walk from the carnival was a blur, Sherlock’s words echoing through his brain, as Scarlett went on and on about how rude and unbelievable that man was. John might have asked, had he been in his right mind, why she wasn’t impressed with the things Sherlock had gotten
"Oh." She's trying to hide her disappointment. She glances over at her friend. "Yeah, I said you weren't. Bea was the one who...she's the one who thought, not me." She starts blinking rapidly and John thinks if she starts crying he's not going to have a clue what to do. "It's just that, I remember that night. You were so...angry and scared and you seemed so worried about Mr. Holmes that I thought..." She's wringing her hands now. "I thought you must be, and I had never seen that before and you were so nice to me, I never forgot how nice you were and then I found the blog and you were always saying how great he was, even when you were mad at him...how can you not...I don't understand-"
“Contemporary music I take it.” Sherlock says this as if it’s something trivial, which to him it probably is.
John looked up, and he’s not sure the exact look he has on his face but whatever it is it made Sherlock flinch.
John stared up the line of his flatmate’s body and waited a beat before responding. “I could leave you here on this table, go have a lovely wank by myself in my room, and never try this again. Is that what you want?”
“You… You really don’t know?” John is genuinely confused. It seems Sherlock is as well; a scowl appears. He’s definitely not satisfied with being out of the loop. John takes a breath and prays again that he’s not about to wreck everything. “Sherlock. It’s not a issue, I swear it doesn’t matter, but I- You’re… You’re impossibly attractive.” Sherlock rears back at this and John rushes to explain, “I swear, I wasn’t going to say anything, or, I mean, I was telling myself not to say anything rather. When you asked what I was thinking about,” he finishes lamely.
Janine put her hands on her hips and scowled. "You all like to have a go, but my romantic streak has kept you two alive for years. I believe a thank you wouldn't be amiss."
Eventually the strain from tugging on the door handle became too much and he slumped against it in exhaustion. His pounding pulse echoed around his body like the bass from a song he’d once heard. It pulled him away from the muffled, worried conversation outside the car to a moment in time, not so long ago, when John had first torn his shirt off in sweat induced frustration. The memory was as clear as if he were watching it happen for the first time.
With little to no thought, he leans forward and brings their lips together. It’s not like Sherlock has given the go ahead but John’s body hasn’t got the memo; it just
She tilted her head and smiled a secret smile. “I could ask you the same. Following a lead perhaps? Not for fun, surely.”
John complied, allowing Sherlock to flip through what bit of notes he had taken. It wasn’t much, but, as he already knew, John hadn’t exactly been giving school work his all as of late. Honestly, he was surprised John hadn’t been doodling cocks in the margins of his notebook.
“Uh huh,” Sherlock drawled, and John could picture the exact look on his flatmate’s face. He had to stifle his laughter.
“Oh, great,” he remarked, noting the dampness around the crotch. He could faintly make out the sadly familiar smell of human waste, now that it was pointed out to him, just over the strong smell of damp and river pollution. A part of him, the Doctor, was horrified by Sherlock’s cavalier attitude about the blatant murder of a suspect, but the practical part, the Soldier, was wondering what the next move was. They had seconds before the armed assailant was upon them.
Even on a Sunday night the club was busy - noisy, distracting, garish, hateful. If John weren't somewhere inside Sherlock wouldn't step foot inside ever again; he'd already had eleven shirts ruined by spilt liquor, nursed several migraines from the too loud music and the flashing lights.
And just like that the pressure dissipated. It didn’t have to be perfect, because they could do it again. And again, and again, and again… Forever until their bones fell to dust.
“What, exactly, prompted this trip down memory lane?” He grunted, since John was still roughly pawing at his arse.
memories,” Sherlock sounds as if he truly believes John is that stupid. It’s only when he hears John snickering that he seems to understand that John had been teasing. He grumbles in return but it’s half-hearted.
His compact frame shifted away from the doorway and made its way over, crawling under the covers with Sherlock until they were snuggled up close again. When they were settled, John answered, “You looked so peaceful, I had to take it in for a bit is all.”
“Nothing against you, John,” Sherlock rushed to allay the obvious issue, “it must have just been a boring party. Not much need to retain bad music and no doubt worse booze.” He feigned a chuckle, under duress. He was no longer sure he should have gone the route of non-remembrance.
Without thinking, he tentatively reached out and placed his hand around John’s erection, but immediately pulled back when John’s eyes flew open and he sucked in a lungful of air.
“No! You obviously couldn’t care less about seeing me, you just wanted a pawn. It’s pathetic, that’s what it is. I can’t believe I actually thought you wanted to see me. Months with no word and suddenly, out of the blue, you decide to call? I’m an idiot.”
“But I feel fantastic.” He rolled back up and blinked his light colored eyes at John. “D’you want to kiss me?”
He rubbed at his wrists, which John stepped forward to look at, despite his knowledge that they hadn’t done any damage whatsoever. He really just wanted to reassure himself that Sherlock wasn’t leaving, rub his thumb over the fragile bones of his hands and squeeze his relief into his partners skin.
The words came so soft John wasn’t sure he’d heard them. He wasn’t even sure what Sherlock was thanking him for, but he turned and gave another smile. He found Sherlock looking back at him with that same look of wonder he’d worn before. Was he even aware he was doing it?
"You don't mind, do you? If you're worried about spelling or something, don't. I double checked." She gives another smile around her bite of toast and John doesn't want to read the smugness behind it but he does.
John’s initial reaction is anger and hurt; that Sherlock thinks so little of him. But then he sees the real motivation behind Sherlock’s words. He’s terrified. This has been Sherlock’s excuse these past few months, his reason for never broaching the subject as well. Fear of rejection.
Sherlock pulls away long enough to inform John that it’s been a very long time since he’s done this.
Sherlock was suddenly very aware of the fact that Mrs. Hudson hadn’t cleaned that day. He’d completely wrecked the sofa with old vinyl records and soap carvings.  Did the flat smell like burnt eyeballs? He couldn’t tell.
"Sherlock is hardly himself today." Molly waved at the man in question. They turned to look at him, standing with one of Mary's bridesmaids.
Sherlock blinked at John for a few seconds but then went back to his organ carving. “Your accent is atrocious.”
, John fervently wishes. The sound serves to remind him that as much as he’d like, there is no chance of getting off in here undetected.
Everyone turned to find a small statured ex-soldier, with a cane gripped long ways in his fist, standing in the doorway with a look of such ferocity they all froze in the face of it.
“I’m here. Just...adjusting my train of thought.” John could hear typing in the background. “Ah. Mr. Trevor is back, I see.”
“Afraid not,” Sherlock answered from the sitting room. “I usually raid Mrs. Hudson round this time but she’s taken to hiding her biscuits in her room.”
He rolls out of the car and hobbles to the boot for his ruck sack. The petrol station/dinner he’d stopped at the night before is now open, the smell of coffee wafting on the breeze, and John takes pleasure in the simplicity of that, instead of focusing on the vague sense of loneliness the desert landscape seems to automatically exacerbate.
“Get Sherlock, silly!” She tore the jersey over her head and paraded around the room semi-nude, picking up her previously discarded articles of clothing. It was a testament to her allure that he didn’t immediately scoff at her statement.
Sherlock glanced up to find John staring at him, worry etched around his eyes. Pity again. He couldn’t stand it.
John knew he looked smug, couldn’t help it really. It was nice to be better at something than Sherlock for once.
Even after explaining, John still looked on in confusion. Sherlock was about to ask which part John was having a hard time with when he blurted out, “Christ, you really don’t remember me, do you?”
John’s eyes boggle as he tries to answer. “When I’m being fondled by a gorgeous naked bloke, yeah, probably.” He hisses when Sherlock runs his hand up his prick to grip him. He’s testing out different ways to run his hand up and down, watching John for reactions, and John thinks again,
John comes back to the area where the body was hidden with the round of coffee he'd picked up from the cafe on the corner. He hands them out to Greg and Sally.
"I've followed the blog, you know, not religiously or anything," she says casually, "but, you know, off and on. I saw your post from this morning."
They’d been walking, sharing a memory, laughing; a simple thing, a lovely moment, before it all went to shit...
Despite not making a bit of sense, John turned to do his bidding. Sherlock acted swiftly, dropping the crate, smashing it fantastically, then hitting play on the Bluetooth speaker in his pocket. The sound of buzzing was immediate but John had already turned at the sound of the wood shattering.
John turned and glanced at Sherlock in shock, as if forgetting he was there. He blinked six times in rapid succession and then merely dropped the man onto the pavement, backing away as if burnt. They ignored the man’s pitiful groans, both too wrapped up in each other’s hard panting to hear his half-hearted attempts to threaten.
John’s blood ran cold. He’d dreaded this moment in particular, Bill finding out about his previous activities. He’d not been back to a club since he’d started running around with Sherlock, he barely had the time, but that hadn’t stopped people from talking about it. John didn’t think Bill was a homophobe but he was the most hetero bloke John had ever met and it stood to reason he was about to get an earful.
“Gorgeous,” he whispers reverently, tracing the lines framing Sherlock’s lower abdomen, the dark nest of hair, neatly trimmed, even though Sherlock says he hasn’t seen any action in years, down to the holiest of the holies, his erect penis.
It's another romantic fancy that John thinks the man looks as miserable as John feels. Not just from the hellish heat outside the Mojave desert, but a lingering sense of… aloneness perhaps. He would have a kindred spirit if that were the case. John knows it's ridiculous, the man is clearly well off; even if he's as mean-spirited as he looks, he wouldn’t want for companionship.
Sherlock studied her while he sipped his soda. It was disgusting but John enjoyed it, and anything that reminded him of John was enjoyable. Usually.
Without warning, he pulled back, slipped his hands under Sherlock’s back and dead lifted him off the table. Sherlock let out a shocked cry and wrapped his limbs tightly around John’s torso. He walked them into the sitting room and deposited Sherlock into his chair with a bounce. While Sherlock was busy looking affronted, John started stripping. Sherlock’s mien melted into a decidedly more pleasant arrangement, something closer to ‘John, you’re brilliant.’
John thought it couldn’t hurt. It would cut into his free time but if he failed his requisite classes, he’d never forgive himself. No amount of experimentation was worth his entire future.
His running dialogue was interrupted by John making a beeline for the toilets at a rugby player’s sprint. Sherlock would be impressed if he wasn’t so insulted by the interruption.
When they emerged from the exit it became apparent, as it should have if Sherlock had been paying attention, that John was heading back to his dorm. Of course he’d want to drop off his bag and change first before going out. Obvious.
Sherlock’s right hand has John’s forearm in a vice grip before he can take a single step. John’s eyes are glued to the hand holding him still, the white knuckled grip, and then they’re traveling up his arm, the ridged strength of the limb, his tightened shoulder, of course his eyes travel over Sherlock’s neck, before they finally settle on those aquamarine eyes he knows so well. They’re a little bit greener just now.
Scarlett leaned in to whisper in his ear, “It’s all right. You’ll be sitting down, you won’t need it.”
Sherlock let out a snort, looking to John and Lestrade to see if they joined in on the joke. Neither seemed to find the situation as funny as he did. John even looked a mite worried, which was odd. Did he really think Sherlock would?
“When it became apparent that you didn't want to seek me out, I sought you out instead." John’s brow furrowed even further, if possible. “You don't need me to tell you to where and what I saw. Do you?"
“You’ve got the basics, which is a good foundation. We’ll go over neuropeptides first, as you seem to have missed that lecture.”
He circled back and made camp in the nearest stairwell. He’d spot John before John saw him, Sherlock was sure. But as more and more time passed, and it became apparent that John had no plans to leave his room for the night, Sherlock felt silly for hunkering down in the dark.
Sherlock is trying to frown but it’s not working, his lips ticking in amusement. Then he brightens and he side eyes John in contemplation.
John swallowed another gulp and prayed Sherlock didn’t notice how wildly turned on he was. Honestly, it boggled the mind how Sherlock hadn’t noticed every time John stared or licked his lips or gripped his own thighs in an attempt not to touch.
“All right! I get it! Give me a moment to think, would you?” They just turned the corner onto Baker Street when Sherlock finally answered, “Dancing. I enjoyed dancing.”
John had already formulated a white lie for that. “I’m going to drop you off and then go back and give that bloke a piece of my mind. I was making sure they’d let me back in if I left.”
Her answering smile might as well have been a saucy wink and a nudge. He let out a weary sigh and started to explain further but she held up a hand.
Sherlock finally answered. “Of course not. She’s smart,” he allowed, “easily the best pathology student they’ve got at the moment, but she’s obvious. It’s tiring watching her try so hard.”
“Oh, god, John,” Sherlock cried when John took him inside fully. He’d severely under-appreciated the last time John had done it; must have been too drug-addled to have caught the subtle nuances. Or perhaps John really had gotten better. Whatever the case, the combination of heat, rigid tongue, gentle but quick suction, and low moans coming from John’s throat set Sherlock on a path he was loath to approach so quickly.
As soon as he was sure Sherlock was finished- the evidence of which was obvious on the floor at their feet- he pulled out and ripped at the condom. He made quick work of finishing, all over Sherlock’s arse and back. The man gasped; in shock, horror, or delight time would tell. John couldn’t have cared less. He was too busy looking to the ceiling in bliss.
but it wasn’t any less groundbreaking for all that. John held himself aloft, careful not to grind down on top of his friend’s sensitive bits, though he was desperate to ease the ache. If the thrust of the tongue in John's mouth was any sign, the bloke was willing and prepared to reciprocate, but John didn’t want to assume.
Sherlock then watched as John smiled down at his cock, like he had missed it, like it was a sodding nostalgic memento, just before he ran his tongue up the bottom of it. Christ, Sherlock was done for, done in, done over - some phrasal verb that he couldn’t grasp just then. His mind threatened to fold in on itself, as it was wont to do when he couldn’t handle a given situation, but he forced himself into the present. He’d be damned if he missed out on the glory that was John Watson laving at his erection like he could glean the answers to his year-end finals from it.
cliché apparently, and tried not to notice the dwindling amount in his wallet. His next pension cheque wouldn’t drop in his account for another five days, as Scarlett was proving to be an expensive date this week, and this was only their second one, he resigned himself to ready meals and no cream for his tea for the rest of the week.
Having those intelligent blue-green eyes focused on him - the twist of his wrist, the steady drip of precome, the vein that ran along the left side of his cock - was all John needed. He’d been primed and ready to go from the start, but the way he just knew Sherlock was filing the information away to use later, it kicked him right in the stomach, left him breathless.
"Save it. We all knew it was coming. I thought it would happen during the stag do honestly but." She shrugged.
“About what?” Sherlock answered absently. They turned the corner on the street where Lestrade waited, hands in his coat pockets, at the kerb. Sherlock fished the fare out of his wallet while John scoffed at him.
“John,” Sherlock croaked, not bothering to clear his throat, “what does this mean? Are we… What do we…”
Sherlock watched, wide-eyed in partial shock, as John reached behind himself and, sight-unseen, worked at his opening. Sherlock breathed heavy at the sight of John’s eyes sliding closed in pleasure, the way he obviously knew what he was doing. God, had he been doing that upstairs this whole time? The thought sent a bolt of sharp lust right through Sherlock’s middle.
“If you say ‘a mistake’ I’ll sleep in the car,” Sherlock threatens. John had been going to say ‘an accident’ but he shuts up. “As I was saying, I didn’t think I’d have to get to this point, as far as hints go, I thought renting a hotel room together was enough, but…”
“John, come now, surely you know that if I-” His words cut off the instant John’s hand landed upon his thigh, snaking slowly inward.
The harshness of sound and garishness of the lights quickly became more than just a little irritating to John, but he soldiered on for Scarlett’s sake. She stared on with an almost childlike glee as they passed vendors hawking wears and women wearing veils and scarves. He had to admit he was slightly impressed with the fire breathers but, really, he
Sherlock waits a beat before looking up. There’s a question lingering between them that hasn’t been fully addressed yet but it can wait. He pulls Sherlock’s head back down to his shoulder and runs his fingers through his hair, feeling the curls slide through like silk.
“I’m from Yorkshire, not a Jane Austin novel,” he snapped. “Is that what you think having money is like?”
"Stop," he commanded seriously. "You need to focus on the case, remember? People's lives at stake? Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered you seemed to have forgotten, but I need you to get your head in the game, those kids need you. Yeah?"
Gregson grinned but it had an edge to it, like he was hiding something. “Excellent. I’ll set it up for you and let you know when to meet. Holmes is picky about new students, he’ll cotton to the idea faster if I smooth the way.”
“He thought dating me would garner attention here in London, get his name back on the map as it were, to rebuild his empire here at home. A futile hope, since I’d ruined his family name nearly twenty years ago. And since he’d never have enough to entice me away...”
Dust kicks up on the road, he can hear the grit scattering across the asphalt, and John thinks it’s such a lonely sound, but then there’s no accompanying sense of melancholy he’s come to expect. Perhaps he’s finally killed that vague sense of desolation. Or, rather, Sherlock must have done it. He can’t think of anything more lonely than standing by himself outside a motel in the Mojave Desert, neon sign flickering above him, pitch-black all around, and yet…
John steadfastly refused to look at Sherlock, though he knew the man was looking at him, most likely noting his reddened ears. How was he rationalizing these tells? Did he file them away and delete them?
John eyebrows shot up in surprise, but he was distracted by Mrs. Hudson bustling past. She set the tea tray down on the coffee table at Sherlock’s feet and John frowned when Sherlock didn’t lift a finger to help her. Not that John knew but Sherlock had his knuckles rapped enough times to know better.
-and it had done no good. Dealing with his family for five horrendous days certainly hadn’t helped. His sister had tried bringing her girlfriend home, to disastrous results, everyone but John had been drunk, his grandmum was dying… it was all around shit. After the day he’d had, coming home that morning to Sherlock’s black mood, and now to find the mess Sherlock was playing in... John was just done.
"I don't care. For the love of god, just hurry up!" He threw his arse back at John like an award winning porn star and John honestly forgot what he was arguing about.
Simple as that. All right, John won’t complain. He turns away so Sherlock won’t see the look of utter confusion on his face.
“I get it. I mean, if it’s too soon, or whatever. No pressure.” She rubbed at the tip of her nose nervously. “Gail was saying she heard a rumor.”
“Your obsession with layers has never been more asinine,” Sherlock snaps as he yanks John’s jumper over his head and finds the button down underneath.
“Very well. I can fit you in again tomorrow night. Same time?” He’d have to cancel with Mr. Elkins. No matter.
"So all of this, every awful thing that has happened to us in the last three years...your fault?" John asked Janine.
And then almost chucked it into the air when from behind him Laila yelled at the customers, “We’re closing in ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Wrap it up.”
John glanced over at her and felt a bucket of ice water dose him. She looked scared. Of him. Bottle of scotch and one sad excuse and look how easily he’d turned into his father.
Sherlock heaved the coffee table over with his good foot and, as it landed top side down, brought his heel down on the small, black audio transmitter Mycroft had placed underneath.
The sight of those frizzy black curls moving down the bed quicken John’s already erratic pulse. He watches as Sherlock gets comfortable, eyeing John’s cock just like he’d done everything else, with a mixture of curiosity and pleasure. All John can think about is the feel of Sherlock’s palm and fingers wrapped around him and the sight of those full lips, just inches away from where he wants them. Nothing could be more important than feeling them there, where Sherlock is staring, calculating.
His last thought, just as the sky outside his window pane became tinted with indigo and green, was to wonder if Laila’s offer was still on the table.
A second passed before they broke out into light-hearted giggles. Giggling led to light-hearted snogging, smiles making it hard to coordinate lips, but neither was willing to stop. John didn’t think he’d ever get enough of being allowed to kiss Sherlock Holmes.
John coughed lightly behind him and Sherlock started guiltily, caught out, even though John had obviously meant for him to find the drawings.
Either they hadn’t arrived at their destination yet or Laila was open minded about more than her taste in film. John’s last transaction had been last night, when they’d ordered a pizza.
Sherlock stood to his full height and, with a dramatic sigh so John would understand his uselessness, quit the room to text Lestrade. John stayed behind to help Ms. McCurdy stand and stretch her tired limbs.
Laila inhaled her wine the wrong way, and John had to pound on her back for a moment, until she coughed up the excess liquid.
John relaxed at Sherlock’s easy dismissal. He had no right to be jealous, but there it was.  He wracked his brain to remember a Molly Hooper but try as he might he couldn’t put a face to the name.
“Ants?” The man responded for the first time, perking up a bit. “Do you really think so, John? That would be lovely. Wouldn’t have to go outside to scoop them up. Been meaning to start that study of their foraging patterns, the way they communicate location to one another, that sort of thing.”
John hides his smile behind the boot lid and waits until the mother has tugged the children inside before finishing up with his clothes.
"John Watson, you are an amazing writer. I wish you'd let me read the old blog right off, you know how I love it. I'm behind this decision a hundred and ten percent. You asked my opinion, I gave it to you. I'm sorry if I upset you but it was coming from a place of love. I thought you'd be more upset if the first wave of comments coming in asked if I was out of the picture now that you and Sherlock were an item."
Sherlock lets out a sound between a huff and a snort and finally looks up. John locks eyes and tries his hand at his own deductions, but Sherlock isn’t giving him a lot to work with.
“Are you going to help or not?” John snapped as he noted Sherlock leaning petulantly against the shack.
John studied the stranger as they moved closer to 221b - a man, approximately their age, of Indian heritage most likely, with a neat queue of dark chestnut waves at his neck. It should have looked unnecessarily dramatic but instead gave the man an air of seriousness. His shoulders were broad, capping a still trim waist and slim hips. He was nearly a perfect match to Sherlock, if a bit taller, John noted as they stepped abreast.
Just before the camera blinked the flash to take the photo, John kissed Sherlock on the cheek. Now forever immortalized on his computer, and in the homes of their friends and family there would a picture of a surprised Sherlock being kissed on the cheek by his boyfriend. A face they had never seen the mad genius make and would never be duplicated for their eyes again.
“You can’t leave!” Sherlock growled. He used John’s anger to catch the man off guard. He lowered his body until he was practically supported by John.
“I’m sorry baby. I didn’t know.” John sighed, eyeing the suit regrettably. He shouldn’t have promised Nana before consulting Sherlock about it. The cries eased before they really built up as John hugged Sherlock close.
Sherlock felt his airway’s being forcibly constricted and John gave a thrust against his prostate in the same moment. His gasp was choked off even as his chest was filled with air and his vision began to pinprick. His brain supplied the endorphins in contrast to the threat of his life, the reptilian brain fighting to get free with a last burst of energy even as the satisfaction from his pleasure told him to submit. The two feelings warred with him and the adrenaline sent his pleasure even higher. Sherlock’s cock throbbed in time with his pulse that could be felt down his extremities from where the belt cut off his air supply. He made to grab for something at first, his fingertips scrabbling desperately against the surface of the wood, and John pulled the belt tighter still until he slapped the table twice.
The atmosphere at 221b is decidedly festive. There’s a decorated tree, twinkle lights on the fireplace. John even hung mistletoe from the door leading to the stairwell in a flight of whimsy. Sherlock wouldn’t admit it out loud to anyone but he has missed this. The past few Christmases here had been lacking in appeal without John around to force the issue of celebrating the season.
“Sherlock sweetie, it’s alright.” John cooed. “Daddy loves his baby boy. It’s okay.” The more he reassured Sherlock the worse his cries became. “Sherlock.” John eased Sherlock away from his shoulder and took that precious face in his hands. His fingers petting at his curls like he knew his baby liked, and swiped at his cheekbones where the tears spilled over. John couldn’t help the smile as Sherlock let out a little hiccup. As long as he could see Daddy wasn’t mad he would calm down. “I love you, baby. You know that.” A nod and a shaky snuffle. Now they were getting somewhere. “And you know I would never make you do something you didn’t want to.” He put a finger over those impossibly pouty lips before his baby could protest. “I just thought it would be nice to do for Nana because she had wanted to see you in it.” John explained, feeling guilty for whatever it was about the suit caused these tears. “Can you tell me what’s wrong, why you don’t like the suit?”
“No. Nope— Don’t think so. I may want you but I don’t need you Sherlock. I don’t need this, I don’t need to watch you use something good like your work as a way for you to try to kill yourself. Taking things too far the way you always do.” John stood still as a statue as he watched Sherlock work himself up into a needy whiney mess. The only thing to move upon John’s person was his pulsing cock
“I’ll wear the suit for Nana, Daddy.” Sherlock’s tiny voice rang out into the soft space between himself and his Daddy.
“I wasn’t going to, since it’s such a wasted effort.” John responded blithely as he sniffed in a rage. “But I won’t stick around to watch you do this to yourself either. It’s just another way to hurt yourself, like the cocaine.” John reached out to open the door again, to head up to his room to pack. “I’m your doctor, but as your friend I’m not going to watch you do this. I can’t, Sherlock. Not anymore.”
John braced Sherlock’s wrists against the door frame above that impossible head of curls, with one hand. John may have been shorter and Sherlock may be wiry but it didn’t take much for the experienced army man to take advantage of Sherlock’s… predicament. He laid waste to his best friend, using his other hand to have way with the buttons and buckle keeping that pale, marble skin from John’s touch. It was so easy to dishevel that pristine suit and turn it to an equal mess as its wearer. John dropped the man’s trousers and pants, freeing his cock already angry red, and swollen. John bit his way down Sherlock’s straining neck to suck at his pulse, over the peaks and valleys of his collar bone to a sensitive, already painfully hard nipple. He gave Sherlock a harsh unforgiving bite to it, sucking the sting of his teeth away. He looked down the man’s torso to see the detective’s hips thrusting into the air as his cock dripped pre-come. Sherlock sputtered a cry as John had yet to touch Sherlock anywhere stimulating. “I’m a doctor, aren’t I?” John growled into his ear, turning Sherlock over so that he could part Sherlock’s arse cheeks and found the furled prize waiting just for him. He circled the man’s hole with a finger trying to get the tightened muscled to relax. “Aren’t I?! Answer me, slut.” John demanded, slapping the ass presented willingly before him. Sherlock wasn’t even trying to deny how much he had been begging for this to happen for months.
“Please? I’d like to know. Daddies should always know what upsets their little boys and why.” He explained. “It would help me be a better Daddy.” He looked to his baby boy hopefully.
Sherlock looked to his Daddy, a proud blush on his cheeks accentuating his little smile. “I love you, Daddy!”
Sherlock came back out just as he set the timer, pulling at the knit of the jumper. “You know I only wear those jumpers because they’re yours.” Sherlock admitted cheeks ablaze.
Sherlock went into the bathroom to do his business like his Daddy asked and came back to see one of his favorite bee shirts, and a pair of shorts on the bed. He fingered them wearily and eyed the suit. His Nana wanted to see him in it, and it was her birthday. She always asked for so little from him. Daddy always asked so little of him. Everyone asked for so little, he could give a little in return. Like a big boy.
“Y-you mean, for a Christmas card. Like people do.” Sherlock barely got the words out around the constriction in his throat.
The rush of oxygen back into his system was so sweet as he felt John give his cock delicious friction with his perfect hands. Three long pulls were all it took as Sherlock writhed against the man’s touch, all at once it was too much and not enough, as he felt John’s cock still pulsing hot cum into his greedy hole that sucked on John’s cock in a rhythm to match his pulse begging for all the doctor had to give. Sherlock cried out as the touch didn’t stop. His cock spurted into long ribbons across the bed in sticky, wet ribbons. He could feel John smile against his skin even as the doctor shuddered against his orgasm.
“I- I refuse to argue about it.” Sherlock wasn’t conceding. He did notice John’s victorious smirk. “I just don’t want to fight on Christmas.” The great bell echoed through London as it just struck midnight.
“John please! Don’t—” Sherlock blinked fighting back the dread that welled up within him as he reached out for his friend. He couldn’t lose everything dear to him. Not now. It was just tonight that Sherlock realized how much he would lose, that’s why he picked a fight with John now. Wasn’t it obvious?
If she gave Sherlock an extra slice of chocolate cake that night for his troubles, Sherlock thought all the trouble to get into the suit was well worth it.
“I don’t wear jumpers.” Sherlock argued, if he was blushing it was merely because of the whiskey he had sipped before opening John’s Christmas present. It had nothing at all to do with the implications that the gift had all the echoes of jumpers that John wore himself.
There was too much left unsaid, as Sherlock paced in front of the darkened hearth. He felt the edge of tension in the unlit room, just as John felt the tension of his unexpressed anger knot his shoulders.
“Don’t worry, I’ll give you what you want.” John sneered, and moved them both from against the door to the coffee table. He was swift and in completely command, the tight moans Sherlock gave were sweet as they moved so that Sherlock was found himself with his stomach pressed against the coffee table, both their hands spilled empty coffee mugs, papers, clippings, and photos onto the rug below. The noise of ceramic rolling across the room from pile to wood didn’t register with either man as they caught their breath and moaned. Every movement of John’s cock inside Sherlock’s body had the detective sobbing and quivering. John took advantage of his state to take selfish thrusts for his own pleasure, groaning into the milky shoulder within his reach. “And I’ll take what I want too. Don’t you worry. Daddy will take care of you.” John grinned and whipped his belt from around his pants that bunched at hips.
After scolding them and a promise to come to the Yard in the morning to give their statements, Greg let them go. John’s white face and pleas for the peace of home convinced the detective inspector to be lenient. John tried to get a cab, but Sherlock had other ideas as he motioned John to follow him. They broke out into a run, and took shortcuts to cut the commute home in half. The fresh air and exercise worked on John’s frazzled nerves until they finally reached Baker Street. Until all that was left was exhaustion.
“Sherlock.” John intoned in warning. He can refuse to wear the suit; John knew it was probably a long shot. But he wasn’t going to talk to his daddy like that.
“Watch it, next time I’ll put on my fatigues and put you through your paces until your cock comes at attention whenever I tell it to.” John warned firmly with a smirk, smacking a pale thigh before returning his grip around the man even tighter than before, muscles bulging underneath his skin. Sherlock thought it felt divine.
“Oi!” John chastised again, slapping Sherlock’s backside several times until the man’s hips stopped moving and a red splotch bloomed upon the white skin. “Rutting into the duvet trying to get off like an errant teenager. You should be ashamed of yourself, young man.” John scolded, tightening the belt once more. He let Sherlock have a good wail before he pulled harder, cutting off the man’s voice. “You know, it’s really sad that I can’t use this method to keep you quiet when you’re mouthing off to the Yard or Donovan, especially Mrs. Hudson or Lestrade. Could you imagine what they’d say about you when I’d do it? They’d see how hard it’d make you. Then they’d know what a dirty little boy you are, wouldn’t they, Sherlock?” John wondered aloud, letting go of the leather strap again as Sherlock coughed against the flooding relief of oxygen.
“It's okay. D-didn’t know.” Sherlock mumbled taking a shaky breath as he snuggled into his Daddy’s neck. And Daddy really
“Mmmmhn— Yes!” Sherlock cried, as John wasted no more time sinking two fingers into the man’s hole, he spat on his fingers as they worked in and out to ease the way. That was all Sherlock was going to get though. He wasn’t going to go easy on Sherlock. Not today. Not when he had been so fucking naughty. But he would take his time opening Sherlock’s hole. He spread his fingers apart and pulled them out of Sherlock’s hole and pushed them back in to jab hard against the detective’s prostate, listening with satisfaction as the man cried out, throwing his head back, and pushing back into the probing fingers. John was a patient man but he didn’t want to wait for forever. The younger man was stretched enough, he decided.
“SLAP THE BED TWICE!!” Sherlock moaned, back arching into the force of John’s teeth, John took his time sucking a mark against his bite while Sherlock whimpered. John loved feeling the man’s cries against his lips as it echoed across his skin. He would love it so much more as Sherlock fell apart underneath him.
What John didn’t understand about the suit, what Sherlock couldn’t explain in his current headspace was the reasons why he didn’t want to wear the suit. It reminded him about the times that he did wear a suit very similar to the one in John’s hands when he was a child. His mother would put him in such hot uncomfortable things, and used any excuse to do so. She claimed he looked so cute, and it was the worst thing. His brother was vastly comfortable in his own school uniforms, but at the time, Sherlock hated the hot, itchy fabrics and the collar buttoned up to his throat with the starched, clip-on bowtie scratching at his chin. Most uncomfortable of all was the suit he wore at his Gran’mama’s funeral. He remembered having a horrible, sobbing, fist-pounding tantrum that day at the party. At the time, he hadn’t known he was grieving, only that his grandmother wasn’t around anymore, there was no one who understood, and he didn’t want to be around all those sad people in the itchy suit anymore.
He opened his mouth to ask outright, but before he could, something plinked off his head. He reached up and pulled a plastic stir-stick shaped like a cutlass out of his hair. Confused, he looked up in the mirror and caught Laila gesturing wildly at him, clearly livid. Sherlock turned fully in his seat to scan the room until he found John.
“Oh,” John drawled, obviously finding this information useful, if not actively planning to weaponize it for his own gain. “You know, if I thought it was remotely possible…”
"Don't say anything too cheesy," Molly advised. "He'll see right through it. Just get him pissed and we’ll have Sherlock talked round enough to do the convincing for us."
In one smooth motion, he pulled Sherlock’s foreskin back and sank down onto his prick until the blunt end pushed against the back of his throat. No sound could be heard until he sucked hard on the way back up, which warranted a loud gasp from the recipient. John missed it because he’d closed his eyes, but he heard and felt Sherlock fall back down onto the table, taking a petri dish down with him as his arms splayed. John’s lips stretched into a smirk, but he let it go without comment.
John waited until he felt Sherlock begin to swell before he chanced a questing thumb against his perineum, rubbing hard.
“We’re on cell regeneration. I’m fairly behind, apparently. My notes are, um,” he shuffled, “incomplete.”
Had they gone to a pub after? John would have loved the chance to show off his dancing ability, so maybe he would have drug her to a club instead. Dancing with a woman wasn’t something Sherlock had seen John do, and knowing what constituted dancing in a gay bar probably wouldn’t fly in the kind of place Olivia would venture, Sherlock wasn’t able to fully visualize it.
“I’ll do my best,” he offered as Mike helped him off the couch. They stumbled- Mike was hardly better off than he was- and crashed noisily into the bedroom, both trying not to knock the other down in the process. A couple was already in attendance, it seemed, when they got the door open. They sped past in a rush and John fell against the wall in a huff. Mike giggled with that scandalized innocence he still seemed to have. Without further thought, John stumbled forward on unsteady legs and fell face first into the pile of coats on the bed.
Greg had to stop him there. It was too much, to listen to his jumbled deductions, the assumed distaste on John's part, as the red, glassy stare worsened.
“Well, yes, quite extraordinary.” John drums his fingers on his thighs and then digs them into the flesh. “So when did you come to the conclusion that I wasn’t your enemy?”
Sherlock smiled slowly, knowing that was the doctor talking just then. He relaxed slowly, rolling his spine, letting his knees fall open.
“Hey,” he tugs but Sherlock refuses to budge. “Sherlock,” he tries again, softer, suddenly frightened that he’s done something wrong, something irreparable.
“The tests stop but don’t think I won’t be dropping in from time to time to check on you.” John heard the snap of the briefcase and the sound of Mycroft standing. “The stunt with the cough syrup almost cost you another six months, keep that in mind. If John weren’t there, I would have sent you to Yorkshire without hesitation.”
Carefully, John ducked out of his hiding hole and leant around the corner to verify Sherlock had left. Sure enough, the hall was empty.
Once he reached the dorm, and the technical aspects of the new endeavor became clear, such as informing the school of his change of address and letting Bill know he was leaving, John was angry all over again.
John coughed lightly and Sherlock shifted uncomfortably in his seat. His ankle gave a twinge but he ignored it.
“Ta, mate,” John absently replied as he shoved the kid away. He managed to make it to the stairwell and down the two flights to the fourth without accosting anyone else.
“C’mon, I’ve got you,” John mumbled needlessly. “Let go, I’ve got you.” He ran his fist over Sherlock’s sensitive head, lightly brushing the crown with every upstroke the way he liked, and when he started clenching, John squeezed harder.
“You really should just concede, John,” Sherlock spoke with the confidence of one used to getting his way.
John shuffled in place, hiking his bag up his shoulder. “No, sir.” He honestly didn’t even remember hearing about it.
The two watchmen are smoking cigars and chatting with each other, completely unaware that their charges are about to be loose. Within seconds John hears the click of the release and grins as Sherlock’s hands come free. He motions for John to turn, and he does, holding still as Sherlock prods at the lock. Again, the cuff is unlocked in seconds. John turns back, rubbing at his wrist.
Before John could parse the ache in his chest, the pair were shaking hands, nearly hugging if John read their body language right.
John looked to Scarlett again, to gauge her reaction, but found she was looking the man up and down. He couldn’t even fault her for it, there
“She’s getting a ride from Thompson,” he answered as they pulled out. “Wants to go over to Bokarov’s flat, see if they can’t tie him to Petrov’s Chechen contacts. Making the connection will wrap this case up.”
John helped him lean against the door jam, already missing his heat as soon as he stepped away. Sherlock flipped the light on and turned back to John with a hesitant look.
“Well,” John allowed his thoughts to coalesce into a more sensible line, “I don’t know a lot about you actually. You know what type of dinner I had by the way I comb my hair in the morning but I know hardly anything about you. Didn’t even know you had a brother until this morning.”
“But what are you going to do now?” She didn’t even mean it maliciously. It was obvious she was under the assumption that she was the driving force in his life.
“You.” When Sherlock catches John’s blank stare he elaborates. “I’m not known for working with anyone, I assumed they would know that and dismiss you entirely. But when I took you with me, they likely assumed we were working together and searched your belongings. They would have found your British issue passport and connected the dots.”
Greg looked down but all he could see was dark curls. "John?" Sherlock nodded. "I don't know," he admitted. "He probably thinks so."
Laila jumped at the chance to answer. “John has selflessly decided to dedicate his life to helping others, my darling future doctor has,” she leaned in to sickeningly rub noses with him, “and I was committed to becoming a filthy barrister, but recently I’ve been thinking of switching careers, so who knows.”
John snorted at that. Not only the vague reference but the fact that Sherlock was such a thirteen year old in a forty year olds body. An erection was treated like an ailment that must be dealt with under penalty of death.
That was why he placed his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face, tipped his jaw up and softly placed his lips down on Sherlock’s own. He felt the pull of air as Sherlock sucked in a shocked breath, but he didn’t pull away, so that had to count for something. It was a bit selfish of him, if he was honest, because in that moment he wasn’t concerned with Sherlock’s reaction at all. All he concerned himself with was laying a few chaste kisses against those lips, alternatively the top and then the bottom, and then he pulled away with a satisfied sigh.
“Oh, that was fantastic!” Sherlock croaks. “We should see how much longer it lasts next time. I’d love to try different approaches as well, see if we can’t start from a different baseline and then draw it out. What else do you like during fellatio? I’ve noticed you’re particularly drawn to my fingers, we might incorporate those next time, if you’re interested in anal penetration, that is. If not, why not? I don’t suppose that would preclude being the penetrator because I’m not sure what my preference is and I’m curious to find out.”
“I expect you threw up everything in your stomach,” John muttered, half to himself, as he went about bringing Sherlock things he’d need should he get sick again. A bucket, a glass of water, some paracetamol, and all the while Sherlock watched John’s comings and goings with a curious eye. It took everything in him to keep his eyes open but he did.
“You would,” John muttered, looking around the room. “I dare you to…” He spotted the violin case and exclaimed, “Play God Save the Queen and do it justice!”
He turned the kettle off with a steady hand and casually flipped the faucet on to wash the rest of the sugar from his fingers. The sink needed a good scrub, he’d have to see to that later. After.
“Oh, John. You’re so beautiful. I knew you would be but I never imagined… I never thought…” Sherlock pants, alternating between staring at their cocks as they slide against each other and back up to kiss him hard.
"She's my step-sister," she defends as if the idea were absurd. If John didn't have a keen understanding that falling in love with someone didn't always follow the rules of polite society, he might believe her defense.
Suddenly Sherlock stiffened and pulled away. John pulled back to see what the matter was but Sherlock’s gaze was turned toward the sitting room. John realized he’d vaguely heard what sounded like a car door but had ignored it in favor of chewing on his flatmate turned hopefully lover.
“Just as I thought. I said, you had a call and since you weren’t answering, I answered it for you.” She paused when he let out a great sigh but then continued. “It was that Professor Gregson. He says to remind you, you have a new student coming in today. I wrote it all down here, in case you forget. He’s due round after Miss Riser, I believe.”
John flinched, realising they were talking about Mary. About his marriage ending. As far as John knew, Sherlock thought Mary had fled capture and been killed by one of Mycroft's men - the official story being that she and the baby had been killed in a drunk driving accident - but it was possible he knew the truth. John hoped not.
Sherlock pulls back from John, and John’s stomach swoops with nerves, sure he’s offended the man. But Sherlock blinks at him like he’s not sure what to say.
made shit choices.  Hell, if anything, he's had several people quite adamantly telling him it was ludicrous, he and Sherlock not being together.  But it doesn't matter what other people think, it matters what Sherlock thinks. And he knows the score there. The whole reason for his continued denial was his continued place at Sherlock's side, in whatever capacity that Sherlock needed him. A doctor, a sounding board, a friend. But nothing more. John was okay with this, he was, he is.
Sherlock merely watched as John finished and pulled the silk away from his shoulders.  John stood and hung the shirt from the knob of his wardrobe. Had Sherlock been in his right mind, he’d have chastised John for being so thoughtful. It wasn’t necessary. It wasn’t worth it. He wasn’t-
“Yes, it really is. You’re not the first kinesthetic I’ve tutored, John. This technique is quite effective, trust me.”
A subject change was in order. Greg finished the rest of his champagne and set the glass down with finality.
"All right. But hurry up, would you, we've got people waiting." His quickly retreating steps caused both men to breathe out in relief.
“Of course not. Your business is your own,” he said nice enough, but they both knew he really meant ‘I can live without knowing for the last three months you’ve groaned my brother’s name when you’ve climaxed.’ “Are you sure this is what you want? It’s not exactly on par with-”
