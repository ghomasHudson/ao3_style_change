She immediately thought better of it after having glanced at his face. Sherlock looked completely surprised and annoyed at the same time.
John tried to ignore the little voice in his mind whispering that he would have caved in sooner or later to SH’s alluring messages.
His hand didn’t tremble as he opened one of his kits and surveyed his contents. Oh yes. It would do very nicely indeed!
The “boy” didn’t answer, of course. Although Greg sometimes was ready to swear that the small statuette, with his grin so large bordering on ridiculous, was somehow laughing at him.
Was he the only one who remembered the joyful chaos of this room, the lovely racket emanating from this flat?
Molly hesitated. When she was a teenager, her mum used to say “You wear your heart on your sleeve, darling, it’ll bring you nothing but trouble!” She was right as usual, Molly has discovered, one bitter experience after the next.
It was so humiliating, he thought, so exhausting, waiting for this man’s answer, depending on him not to say anything.
“What are you trying to do?” he asked her in the sternest voice he could muster. “You only had to call out to me when I was in the hall, I would gladly have kept you company downstairs!”
“It should have helped, had I not made personal… choices which caused this name to become more a burden than a real help. I’ve made my peace with them and I’m proud to bear my wife’s name, she has always been a true support for me and I’m very lucky to have her. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for other… family members.”
He abruptly stopped when he discovered Ross planted in front of the posh man, who has sat before next to Mister Curls. Judging from the tension emanating from both of them, they weren’t having a friendly chat.
Sherlock took his time to answer, raising instead John’s hands to his lips and brushing butterfly kisses on his reddened knuckles.
The no-holds-barred sensuality in his voice was a lethal weapon, John thought. Even more so when, with his right hand, Sherlock made short work of his jeans’ buttons.
As if he has sensed Sherlock’s intent – or was he waiting for it? – John came to a halt. He still wasn’t looking at the detective though and he remained two meters away from him. A deep silence fell between them, only disturbed by the sound of their quick, hard breath. Sherlock didn’t understand the sudden shift in John’s mood – hasn’t he flirted with him before? He could still hear John’s warm, languorous voice ordering him to kiss him. Has he imagined all the tension between them?
John approached it slowly, finding back his reflexes of soldier, back in Afghanistan, when he had to enter an area which had not been yet secured. If anyone had seen him at this moment, he would certainly have come across as completely ridiculous, considering suspiciously this inoffensive bouquet as if a bomb was hidden in it. But John didn’t care.
He was going to close the mailbox when he discerned, at the bottom of the box, a small object. He grasped it carefully. It was a small handmade car, carved into a dark, rough bark. Red berries glued in place made up the four wheels. It was really ingenious, he thought, turning it round in his palm, he wondered who…
“Gladly,” Mycroft whispered, looking around him with a faint air of distaste. “But first, I have to talk to you.”
“He is. My father is Antonio Palmeri and I’m sure you have already come across his name once or twice. He has gained a bit of reputation among Renaissance experts and besides, he likes to speak to the media. He’s a popular man in his branch.”
Sherlock heard the raw need fuelling his own and he would have caved in, pouncing on his prey before devouring him whole as he so often dreamed of it, if a French voice wasn’t heard at this moment through the ceiling, bringing him back to reality and to the reason they were both here.
With renewed energy, he started methodically searching the whole flat for the letter. The letter he should never have written. The only weakness he couldn’t leave behind when he will move on. The idea that some stranger could come upon it, discover his most personal thoughts and feelings concerning Sherlock… It was unthinkable.
, but for an unknown reason his body didn’t obey. He stared at the owner, his heart in his throat. Ross peered at him for a while before asking
And it's a wrap! A MASSIVE thank you to all the readers, who have left comments and Kudos, you've been a true inspiration during that journey <3 <3 <3
“Straight to the point, I see. And here I thought we could have a nice little chat with a cup of tea!”
“As you wish,” Sherlock replied, his heart hammering in his chest and finally taking the risk, this very last step which remained between them.
“But unlike you, John, I’m able to multitask,” Sherlock retorted, his voice sending a very unwelcome right now tendril of heat curling up in John’s groin.
Unable to stand still, he paced up and down his flat’s living room, not seeing anything else than the piece of paper on which he has written the phone number.
“John!” Sherlock panted, going down in his knees. Without wasting any time, he searched the man’s pockets, ignoring his protests – “Get your hands off me!”. He suddenly pulled something with a “ha!” of satisfaction.
John opened his mouth several times but couldn’t find the right words – those which would convey to the bartender why such an idea was completely laughable, without speaking of being impossible. His heart was pounding in his chest, he was completely ridiculous. It would have been better if he hadn’t spoken at all.
“I’m here, in case you’ve forgotten. And that’s quite enough on this subject, ta very much,” he said, a hint of steel in his voice.
“Dare what, Sir?” she said in a soft voice before leaning in. “Because if you’re speaking of the handsome Detective Inspector you’re shamelessly ogling each time he’s requesting your presence for a so called ‘Sherlock crisis’, I must admit then I dared approving his coming up right now.”
And without further ado, she unzipped her fly, took off her trousers. In a swift gesture betraying her nervousness, she got rid of her pants.
He hasn’t obtained his DI badge by turning tail and running away at the first hurdle, after all. Besides, if there was one field on which Greg prided himself on being an expert, it was his capacity of sizing up Mycroft’s mood at one glance.
“If I had known I’d end up playing the therapists today…,” he muttered before clearing his throat. “Tell me, young man, since when did you and your friends start going to my pub?”
He turned round, surprised to see Will standing a few feet from him. When has he moved around? Before he could answer though, Jane recovered first, tossing back her hair and smiling flirtatiously at him.
Sally’ angry face danced before his eyes. In a sense, he could understand why she was so angry with him. No doubt she has done her very best at police academy, having to work twice as hard as the others simply because she was a Black woman. Sherlock didn’t need to read her file to deduce she has painstakingly climbed the career ladder, step by step, until she finally landed her dream job.
He was like a dragon with his treasure, carefully hoarding the precious little nuggets he was being granted thanks to him living alongside Sherlock – how he liked his tea, the roll of his eyes when John insisted they watched the “Pointless” show, the flex of his toes and the hum of appreciation he gave when he finally agreed to break his fast after a 10-minute negotiation.
He has barely let out a sigh of relief that his phone buzzed again. Naturally, Mister Curls was a fast typer – it would just be John’s luck!
Sherlock felt a mirthless smile blooming on his lips as he looked in the small camera lens half-hidden in the box’s compact body.
She looked up once more at him and although her face remained inscrutable, he got the distinct feeling she was now laughing at him.
Even joining the volunteer team at the Community Garden, as Mrs Hudson suggested earlier. Something to keep him busy at any rate.
“The point is,” Greg repeated, not wanting to lose the thread of their discussion right now. “I asked him a bit of help in... you know and here you are!”
“Do you want a bit more time to decide, Sir?” the girl asked, her bland voice making him cringe. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to give you more than half an hour though,” she adds, looking up at the clock above her desk. “We’ve got so many last-minute requests, you understand…”
- shadow. He stifled a groan. Now wasn’t the time for his mind to remind him what he was physically looking for in a partner. Or that he liked his men to be taller than him (which wasn’t really difficult, if he was honest with himself).
Yes, he could understand. It didn’t mean that he wouldn’t take the golden opportunity which was offered to him simply because he might hurt the pride of others in the process. Oh no, he would take his due and enjoy it to the fullest.
Ah. Nudged by his friend, Former Soldier – “John” according to the badge pinned on his leather jacket – has finally decided to make a move on Sherlock. Irene fought the temptation to roll her eyes.
Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade was being pleasantly buzzed. Well, if he was really honest with himself, he was a bit more than that.
He has been right. She would have done everything to keep Sherlock safe from the danger he seemed to represent. And it was a worrying thought.
“It’s a yew berry,” she said before glancing at John. “I hope you didn’t intend to taste it, the seed is toxic, you know…”
Greg didn’t intend to grant him this satisfaction. He leaned back against his chair, taking the time to cross his legs. During a fleeting moment, he toyed with the idea of replying “If you’re not interested in a chat, how about a quick shag over your desk, then?” but his intent was to bring Mycroft out of his armour, not to antagonize him.
It seemed that the smile and the teasing voice had the desired effect, as Mycroft blinked at him, before giving a slight nod.
“How many times do I have to tell you all the costs of this charming, impromptu trip are borne by his Highness, hum?” Sherlock retorted irritably. “Really, it’s enough that we find ourselves buried in this little French hole!” he added, not paying the slightest attention to the receptionist frowning at his derisive comment. John tried to placate her with a smile, but considering the way she nearly threw the room’s key at them, her feathers weren’t so easily smoothed.
He didn’t take his eyes off his target – the row of mailboxes a few feet from him, on the other side of the lawn. Thank to Hussein and his team, garden lights were interspersed around the tea hut and other facilities in an attempt to hold off wannabe burglars, as they have already targeted the community garden.
Of course, Sherlock was no innocent, despite what Mycroft still believed. He knew the power of seduction, has used it a few times before, when he was still courting Death with a single push of syringe. It has led him to some sticky ends that Sherlock still couldn’t remember without a flush of shame spreading across his cheeks.
“Of course, it has deeply upset the whole organisation – if I can use this word. Some took advantage of this to get some old scores settled, the kind of thing you usually see when a boss kicked the bucket…”
The owner beamed with pride before heartily slapping Sherlock on the back, making him stumble in his seat. John tried to hide his smile behind his hand – to no avail, it seemed, considering how his date was currently glowering at him.
“It helps me clearing my head, you know. I find it quite relaxing, to be honest. And the team of volunteers, they’re such lovely people, always ready to help you when you get a question or a problem!”
This morning after – even if they’ve done nothing else than kissing – was already shaping up as the best he has ever known.
He sighed before crying out “Coming, for God sake!” and shuffling along to the door. He abruptly opened it – as soon as he found the handle, anyway – and was ready to tear the intruder a new one when he found himself face to face with the loveliest, most ravishing, completely gorgeous illusion ever.
He only had time to step back before a loud crash occurred against the wooden door. A small part of John’s mind deduced – successfully – that the night lamp on Sherlock’s – which has become theirs, since their trip in France – has not survived his owner’s ire.
“No,” John practically growled, looking up once again at Sherlock, who found himself pinned down under his friend’s darkened gaze. “No.”
John used to pride himself on his nerves of steel, but there were limits, even for a former soldier. Therefore he stammered “What the fuck?” before taking a few paces back.
There was a sudden lull in Kelly’s monologue when she took a sip of water, excusing herself with a little smile. John took advantage to discreetly observe Mike, seated next to him at the end of their row. His friend wasn’t faring very well in front of a redhead, who wasn’t even looking at him. Mike was obviously feeling ill at ease, talking a mile a minute in a vain attempt to overcome his own nervousness.
Anyway, nearly the end - and I thank you once again for your support & comments, it's lovely to hear from you!
John has let himself falling for his best friend, his flatmate and, as a consequence, he found himself now between the devil and the blue sea.
Only the thought of the box still resting on the desk near them stopped him from taking that kiss which has so often appeared of late in his fantasies. He didn’t want to start this… thing between them before Sherlock had to go back to the Work. No – he wanted Sherlock’s attention focused on him and only him when they would finally be on their own and have all the time they needed to explore the shift in their relationship.
One hour later, Lestrade and his team have come and gone with plastic bags full of evidence, some ruffled feathers – especially among Hot in Love’s officials – have been smoothed and Irene has gained a splitting headache. The police’s intervention has put a definitive damper on the
He has nearly jumped when his old man has put his hand on his shoulder – a gesture John has always considered as warm support but has suddenly seemed to be a stifling weight at that moment.
“Send whom up?” he directly asked, his tiredness and annoyance at Anthea’s order without asking first for his approval colouring his voice.
Joan suddenly stopped on the last step, her head lightly tilted, listening very carefully to Sherlock’s answer. Thank God for their flat’s door which has been left ajar.
Some kind of online newspaper – LeekNews, such a horrible pun, honestly – has tweeted about New Scotland Yard’s announcement, tagging Sherlock in the process. John peered at it closely.
A shiver ran down Mycroft’s spine as he was forcefully reminded of Sherlock’s least glorious moments. Granted, they’ve all happened before John came into his life, but Mycroft was under no illusions as regards his brother’s unfortunate relationship with drugs – the temptation will always be there.
“Where do you think the strawberries this summer were coming from? And the lettuce last week? I certainly didn’t buy them at Tesco!”
Sherlock remained silent, unable to think or to look away from John, who didn’t avert his gaze as he carried on
For the umpteenth time, he wondered why, if people were so easily offended at his deductions, they didn’t pay more attention to all the clues they left lying around.
He turned round just in time to catch a glimpse of a flat, white belly disappearing under a T-shirt - “Don’t keep calm, just go crazy!”
“Yeah,” he replied in an overly cheery voice. “Yeah, of course. I’m...” he repeated before the idea struck him. “Hang on a sec. How did you know my address?”
“I’m perfectly aware of that,” he snapped, calling himself a bloody fool for not having recognised sooner this fruit.
It was quickly becoming a real challenge, especially when his diabolical tease of a date was growing bolder in his exploration, lightly squeezing the top of his buttocks before stroking John’s ribs, the sensitive flesh of his belly.
Easier said than done, he mused. But he didn’t have the heart to see Mike’s enthusiasm being deflated by his own pessimism.
Lost in his thoughts, Sherlock hasn’t been aware that his companion has come closer. From where they stood, a single lamplight revealed John smiling at him.
John smiled - his little, mischievous smile who said better than any word that his thoughts were better left unsaid - at least in public. Sherlock smirked in return. At the same time, he couldn't help but feel trepidation and excitement.
As long as he didn’t let their resentment affect him in any way, Sherlock knew he would be fine. He has learned his lesson, after all.
“I… forgot something in the lobby,” he hastened to say, his hand already turning the door’s handle, “back in a sec!”
“Seriously?” John retorted even if he obeyed. “You’re going to scale this wall while people are waiting for us inside?”
Unable to bear any longer Sherlock's focus, John averted his gaze, looking down at the filth under his shoes. Gosh. What a place to come out and declare his feelings to this man! He suddenly felt angry with himself - he should have done more, should have taken him to dinner, in a posh, nice place, some restaurant with soft lights and hushed conversations.
“Not even for a trip to France, all expenses paid?” Mycroft had retorted, pretending to examine his nails. “Of course, should you be successful, your bank account would be credited with a fine sum.”
. John examined him for a few moments before walking to the bar, behind which Ross was once more standing. He glanced up at John, his smile not being as friendly as usual.
“He’s sensitive, is he?” Sounded her voice, and I turned to stare at Acolea wordlessly. I wasn’t quite sure what to do with her, as it was.
“Sherlock,” I reined him in automatically. It’d become instinctive by this point to stop him when he breezed past socially accepted behavior with disregards to others, but Acolea only smirked.
He was uncharacteristically silent, and I looked over to see him leaning back against his chair. He looked terrible. Fingers digging into the arm rest, eyes wild with something primal, lips thinned, and jaw clenched. It took me a second, but…
Then Acolea shifted on the sofa, drawing my attention back. Her intense eyes serious and playful smile all business-like. It made you lean in, to catch every word she breathed.
while Sherlock was in one of his moods, ghost playing on his violin in his pajamas and a robe and staring out a window. He hadn’t spoken a word in days, God knows what was going on in that head of his.
I have thought long and hard about sharing her story with the public. It is not an easy tale to swallow. It is definitely not general public appropriate, you can trust me on
So, it came to me as a shock when I realized, that he was as affected by her as I was. It was hard to think, I admit, around the thick mess that had become of my thoughts by then but even to this day I clearly remember the horror etched on his face as his hand ever so slightly reached for her.
“You’re… doing that thing. That thing where you make a point somehow with what you’re wearing. I… can’t for the love of God figure out what the point is, though.” I stammered. Not the smartest thing to say, but better than staring like a slack-jawed idiot.
“And you would be right. Mrs. Hudson, if you please,” Sherlock gave that little wave of his hand and Mrs. Hudson shut the door behind her as she left.
The soft whisper, contrasting with the unrestrained desire he could hear in Sherlock’s voice, elicited a whine from John’s mouth.
A sharp, chemical smell suddenly wafted over his face, assailing his nose before triggering his memory. He has sniffed it before and under atrocious circumstances, if he believed the fear running through his veins. Heart racing, he bent his head forward. Panic engulfed him as soon as he recognized the irritating, eye-watering smell of chlorine permeating the string.
With the last button undone, she tenderly removed Sherlock’s blouse. Then she looked up and admired her lover – flushed skin, red, swollen mouth, panting for breath, looking at Joan like she has never seen someone so wonderful.
With anyone else, Joan would have said “Mind the teeth!”. She hated her lovers leaving love bites where anyone could see them. It was bloody embarrassing and besides, it seemed to her that any bruise of this kind just screamed “YOU ARE MINE”. For someone who cherished her independence, it was just unbearable.
Greg’s seriousness made him choke back his mirth. Heart racing in his chest, John braced himself to give voice to the very thing he has been dreading since he has realized the depth for his feelings for his flatmate and friend.
John let out a small sigh, full of relief. Nothing better than a hot bath after a long walk in London, which has left him completely drenched to the skin, an unexpected downpour having caught him in near Piccadilly Circus.
Greg giggled, trying to come closer to this fascinating man without being unsubtle about it and failing quite spectacularly.
Which was not to say that Anthea’s choice hasn’t brought some unexpected benefits in its wake, such as the agreeable companionship they were having now. They were working well together, forming an unstoppable team behind Westminster’s scenes, dividing what was to be done amongst themselves with an ease everyone around them envied.
Each word felt like a stone weighing on his tongue, lodged in his throat. They were ripping him from the inside, leaving him bare. Exposed. Vulnerable to this man watching him silently. Without judgement but also without any will to help him in his expression.
He frowned. Better not be Donovan or whoever the fuck thought it was all right to disturb him. He briefly toyed with the idea of lying low, but at this moment there was a second flurry of knocks at his door. Whoever that was seemed to be absolutely determined to break in on his drinking night.
“Stop teasing the poor man!” she cried out, bringing a wave of good-natured laughter among the other volunteers. “Don’t worry, John, it’s a lovely bouquet! I’m sure Emma would love it.”
He didn’t have the opportunity to finish. Sherlock took a step forward, pulling John up against himself. Their lips met in a heated, devouring kiss.
Heart jumping in his chest, John stared at the text which has appeared five minutes ago on his mobile screen. In the few hours after he has sent the text to Sherlock, desperately waiting for an answer while trying to convince himself that of course he wasn’t looking every minute at his phone, he has managed to convince himself that his text has come across as way too cheeky to deserve an answer.
Sherlock barely had the time to close the door behind him before John pinned him against it. Walking to 221b Baker Street has been a sheer torture. If he hadn’t known that Sherlock’s flat was just 5 minutes away, he would have taken advantage of every shadowy nook and cranny on their way to kiss and taste a bit more the beautiful man next to him.
And then he stopped to think when Sherlock, inch by inch, pulled on his T-shirt until he found the bare skin of his back.
Without any warning, he cupped John’s bottom in his hands and lifted him up. John let out a surprised yell, eliciting a “Shhh!” from his companion, while his legs instinctively wrapped around Sherlock’s waist.
He was safe here. Studying medicine, making sure his dream came true, getting a tight little group of mates. They weren’t the nicest of the lot, but John didn’t really care. What mattered was he never got to drink alone like some loser.
Then the answer popped into his mind – of course, one of them must have seen his name appearing in the headlines on Twitter or somewhere else. They’ve been reminded of Sherlock, the poor love-stricken dummy, and with the help of a few drinks, they’ve decided it would the highlight of their Friday night if they could play him for a fool.
The ghost of a smile lingered on his lips. But his face grew sombre soon afterwards and desperation was shining in his eyes when he said “I need your help, Molly.”
Or has someone made a mistake, getting the wrong mailbox? (How did he explain then the carving of his initials?)
“I… You… I didn’t know how to deal with…” Mycroft abruptly stopped, levelling a beseeching gaze at him.
A sharp intake of breath on the other side told John Sherlock has stopped pacing round his room and was waiting for him to carry on.
The splinter under your skin, forcing a bloody way through your chest until it finally pierced your heart.
“We really hope next year to set up a beehive over there…” Hussein abruptly stopped when he saw John’s stricken face. “Oh, I see… You’re allergic?”
Just the thought of his beloved instrument – one that he wouldn’t use anymore – made his heart sink deeper. He suddenly felt old. And completely useless. A feeling which was plaguing him with an alarming frequency these days.
“Are you finished daydreaming now? It might have escaped your attention that we have reached our goal,” he said, waving his hand at a lit board hung on the wall and telling everyone who might be looking at it that yes, the Clos Lucé was waiting for them behind the nearby doors.
The community garden, the forget-me-nots in the mailbox, the stakeout and the young man saying to him “He told me you enjoyed solving mysteries. As well as giving chase to criminals.”
“In the end, I became so tight-lipped that he became aware of his mistake. He tried to cover up by outrageously flirting with me, trapping one of my feet under his own.”
Or rather he would have exploded as soon as they have left the crime scene, ranting at Sherlock until being left out of breath.
Gasping for air, baring his neck to Sherlock, who shamelessly took advantage of it, rubbing his stubble against John’s sensitive neck before sucking on it mercilessly.
To which punishment she has sentenced herself - telling lies until she was utterly sick of them. Keeping the truth from the ones who most needed it.
“Yeah, I spoke to her occasionally. Nothing too intimate or serious, mind you. Just superficial chitchat – how are you and Dad, how is it going at your job, is your boss still the same old bastard… That kind of things.”
And so was Greg, quietly observing the Ice Man that he often dreamed of relieving of his Savile Row tailored suit before kissing him into submission.
as Wikipedia names it, before describing quite thoroughly the tree and its many properties. Mrs Hudson wasn’t wrong when she said that the seed was toxic – in fact, nearly everything in the yew tree was poisonous. No wonder then that it was closely associated with death.
“When Pam gave it to me, all I wanted was throw it away and forget all about it. Do you know why I put it here, then?”
He has come here as a last resort, desperately hoping for some sign, some clue that Sherlock was indeed alive.
It turned out – quite delightfully, in Greg’s eyes – that Mycroft could hold his own as far as preparing breakfast was concerned.
John ignored the sudden ache in his chest or the voice in his mind screaming at him to be cautious. To hell with it. He found himself wanting to answer Sherlock with the same honesty he has just displayed.
They didn’t see the dark side of the moon, the invisible part of the iceberg; They didn’t notice what was carefully hidden in Sherlock’s eyes every time he looked at John.
The door was unlocked in a second and a furious, lightly dishevelled Sherlock appeared. John had time to glimpse his blazing eyes, his flushed cheeks and lips - has he bitten them? – before he was drawn into a possessive embrace and snogged within an inch of his life.
It was a perfect opportunity to open his mouth and ask the owner, who obviously knew some things about Sherlock, if…
The only question was – how to let him know John was definitely interested in keeping in touch with him?
Sherlock broke the kiss, opting for licking and teasing the soft skin of John’s neck with little nips of his teeth.
When people looked at John Watson, they often only saw the man tagging Sherlock. They made fun of him, shaking their heads with amused pity. Some well-intentioned souls have even tried to warn him against Sherlock, whispering in his ear or frankly saying, not bothering to lower their voices, even when Sherlock could hear them.
Did you think it was the end? That you would come back like a triumphant Odysseus, who, after having killed every intruder who has set foot in his territory, found back happiness and warmth with his faithful Penelope?
Sherlock quickly lost her smile and turned serious again. She lets her eyes travel over Joan’s face.
It was their way of communicating with each other, the common language they had developed and perfected during Sherlock’s youth. It wasn’t always effective and it had sometimes caused grievous misunderstandings between them, but then who could boast never to have had any spat with their loved ones?
Sherlock’s mouth went dry, his mind suddenly invaded by images which were very difficult to banish and forget.
“Of course not!” Sherlock protested, struggling to stand up and putting on her blouse again before making her way towards the kitchen, where she put the kettle on. “Myrcella has sent me backup. I was surrounded by her men and Lestrade’s team.”
Now, you’re lying in bed, watching the man you love softly snoring. He’s nestled against you and you’re filled with so much love for him you want to kiss him again and again.
Sherlock remained frozen on the spot, his mind overwhelmed with possibilities and dreams he has been having when he dared to imagine that one day, John would be more than his closest friend.
John let out a small sigh. What was he trying to do, piecing together the elusive clues left by his mysterious stalker? He was no sleuth, and certainly not able to hold a candle to Sherlock’s deductive reasoning.
He took a deep breath, closing his eyes and letting the events of these last weeks flashing in his mind.
Sherlock, he was picturing Sherlock in his mind and it wasn’t on, it was definitely not on, he should have stopped right there this madness, but he has found himself unable to stop, it was good, so very good, especially since he has forbidden himself to think about it.
“Okay…” Mike replied with a friendly tap on his shoulder. “We’re not here only for me. I also want you to enjoy yourself, right?”
His first impulse was to protest, to say it has been a mistake, that of course he wasn’t out because there was no need for him to be. However, something deep down didn’t allow him to lie.
It didn’t stop his heart from racing when the stranger stopped in front of Mrs Hudson’s mailbox. He pulled something free from his hoodie’s pocket, slipping it into the mailbox. John took a step forward… and felt something creaking under his sole.
“Worse? How could they be worse when he has been “kicked to the curb”, as he so charmingly put it?” Sherlock stood up, agitatedly waving his hands. “You don’t understand John, I had to be sure!”
“Did you think I would forget?” he softly said, padding along behind the sofa before leaning in and whispering in Mycroft’s ear. “I’m not
Sherlock danced like he has never done before. The music – a bit too electronic for his taste, but beggars can’t be choosers, after all – pulsed deep and low in the darkened room. Sweaty bodies were gyrating around each other. Except for him, of course. The first one to have tried the familiar grab-rub-on-you-with-a-cheeky-smile tactic with Sherlock has scampered off after he has grabbed him by the balls – and certainly
“Well, why don’t you get us a drink before the second round of the Dating Game starts, hum? And in the meantime, I’ll look for Casanova over there…”
Or rather – how they managed not to fall in the stairs while they attacked each other in a frenzy of filthy kisses, wet sounds echoing in the stairwell, and gropes which turned from sensual to downright pornographic. Besides his iron biceps, Sherlock must have magic fingers – it was the only explanation John’s lust-addled brain has found for the fact that his companion succeeded in unzipping his jeans and half-unbuttoning his shirt while carrying him upstairs.
He smirked when he imagined Mycroft’s aghast expression should his brother come across him right at this moment.
He suddenly broke off. He has been about to say “the night when Lestrade had to arrest me in Montrose club.”
He gritted his teeth. His old man was miles away but the words he has spoken immediately after Harry has finally come out to his parents still echoed in John’s mind.
Irene lightly stroked Molly’s cheek with his forefinger, fighting the temptation to bury her face in this soft neck.
“Tell me just one thing – has he looked at you just one time? Has he dared to meet your gaze? Has he given any sign at all that your attention was welcome?”
He smothered a groan. It wasn’t the right time to let his imagination run wild. They were here for a case and…
“He looks just like you when you got out of the bathroom this morning!” she has replied, howling with laughter afterwards. Greg has remained frozen on the spot, staring at the statuette’s lumpy, unattractive shape – his round thighs, his potbelly, his stunted stature…
Sherlock sighed, sat up at the end of the bed and, for once, forgot the etiquette he had painstakingly learned when he was a child – he let himself fall down against the soft coverlet.
Back instinctively arched against Sherlock’s hand stroking him along his spine, fingers grazing his jeans’ waistband – how he wanted that hand to go lower,
“Okay, then… I’m sorry if it’s a bit blunt, but why did you come here last night? Not that I’m not happy to see you here, mind you, but I got the impression earlier I wasn’t really welcome anymore…”
He still remembered Mycroft’s shell-shocked silence when he has discovered his younger brother’s nighttime activities. He hasn’t been able to hide his disgust and contempt quite successfully, either.
“We have numbered every area in the garden. Easier to say that we need to lay out the flowerbed in the plot sixty-four than to describe the plot in front of the waterfall, next to the blue-and-red hydrangeas, after all!” Hussein replied with a laugh. “No risk of misunderstanding each other.”
He found out his hands were balled into fists at his sides, as if he could physically punch his goddamned curiosity. A voice looking furiously like Harry’s suddenly echoed in his head.
He was about to jump back in his seat, putting on his most indifferent face in a desperate attempt at salvaging things as best as he could – he could pretend, he could forget, he could ignore his heart screaming his refusal – when he glimpsed John’s little smile.
His cheeks burning with humiliation, Mycroft heard himself replying in the blandest voice he could muster.
Completely mesmerized by Sherlock’s face as well as his words, John could only look when he boldly put his right hand on John’s cock, rubbing it in all the right ways through his jeans.
“Don’t worry about it, everyone here has at least tripped once over those little buggers…” Hussein picked up the little board, that John’s fall has sent flying a few feet away from them. A large “8” was written on it.
“Are you coming or not?” he impatiently asked, ignoring the startled looks from clients and staff alike. “And bring the suitcase!”
His phone suddenly let out a few thrills, bringing John back to reality. He has set the alarm on six pm to give himself the necessary time to get ready.
Of course, counting upon Sherlock to deal with the post-investigation formalities was like releasing a bull in a china shop. It didn’t stop Irene from trying to make him feel guilty of having left her on her own.
John concealed his smile. Oh, well. Two could play this game, he thought, not resisting the impulse to cant his hips upwards, plunging into Sherlock’s tight fist.
“You’re sure you don’t want to try your luck with the looker over there?” Lestrade whispered in his ear, giving John a nudge for the third time since he has entered the pub.
His companion seemed to enjoy him looking taken aback, because he took a step forward, right into Sherlock’s space and leant in, whispering “I don’t have a brilliant mind like yourself, but I still remember this old fable, you know
“Would you look at the time!” Sherlock cried out before Angela could embarrass him further. “John, we’re going to be late for the…”
Doubt briefly flared in his mind – what if Sherlock didn’t like what he saw? What if John definitely lost his ability to trust others at the same time he was shot in Afghanistan?
He fell silent. She noticed then the slight whistling sound he let out each time he exhaled, the way he was heavily leaning against the wall, as if he was unable to stand without this support.
During a fleeting moment, John’s blue gaze came to mind but Sherlock relentlessly crushed this memory until it crumbled into ashes.
All of this faded from his sight however when, turning his head, forgetting his usual caution, he met John’s gaze.
John was already opening his mouth to ask Sherlock to help him, not willing to be left behind, but Sherlock beat him to it, leaning down and lending him a hand.
John’s gaze widened further if such a thing was possible and Sherlock hesitated. Maybe it hasn’t been such a great idea to take the plunge in such a grandiloquent way. He should have started small, taking baby steps and…
It was pitch-dark inside. The door’s handle bumping into his back, John felt his way along the wall, moving a few feet away before standing still. The familiar weight of his holster at his side gave him at least some comfort. He was already stretching his hand out, looking for the switch, when he heard it.
There she was two minutes later – nursing a gin and tonic and wondering absent-mindedly in which state Irene would find his associate.
as the French say – piteously, horribly pining for the man who shared his life in all important matters except for one.
“No. We’re in the same room and, if I want to sleep tonight, I’m definitely going to share the bed with him.”
They stared at each other, twin smiles blooming on their lips. Their gazes were shining with such happiness Joan wanted to laugh. She leaned in instead, tracing a soft kiss on Sherlock’s mouth.
Acting rashly was not really his strong suit but in this case, Sherlock found he couldn’t resist. He replied to “John”
“Wish I had remembered it earlier,” he said, raising his still half-full glass in a drunken salute to Bes.
“I never was very good at being attentive to her or giving her small gifts, so I made sure to never forget Valentine’s Day. And after all, isn’t red camellia considered as the flower of love?”
John woke up with a jolt, spitting out the tepid water having infiltrated his mouth and his nose. He leant on his elbows, red-faced, mouth open to take in a deep lungful of air. It’s not until his heart beat again at a steadier pace, his uncomfortable arousal trickling out of his veins, that he realized what had happened.
I've updated the tags to avoid that anyone might be caught unawares but I'll repeat here - Trigger Warning !
John, john, john, the only clear flame in a barren, desolate landscape, John, the only source of water for your parched heart, John, the only name which could bring you hope and strength enough to survive one more day.
Sherlock who was regaling him with his investigation stories, declaring himself “the only consulting detective – I invented the job, really”, who was talking a mile a minute when deducing John’s life – “A sister! There’s always something…” – and who looked taken aback when the only answer he got was a soft “Amazing” – “You really think so?”
“I… It seems that…” he stammered before letting out a great sigh and looking at Greg in the eye. “I owe you an apology.”
"I'm sorry," he softly repeated. "I... When you left the Honeybee for good, I realized that... I was missing you."
“And all the times I have heard your pathetic “I’m not gay!” when someone was making fun of our friendship…”
Sorry for such a short chapter, folks, I hope next week will be much quieter so I can sneak in some writing time :)
“I’m not afraid to try!” he lobbed back furiously. “I’m trying right now and it’s fucking hard! I have never felt so vulnerable in my whole life, as if I was walking around naked in the middle of a crowd and it’s crazy, completely fucking crazy, especially with what happened after you came out, I should never have done it, but he made me feel…”
It was the next logical step in the harasser’s escalating pattern. He has started by upsetting the women in
She was already turning on her heels, eager to get out of this hellhole, when she heard “One last favour, Miss Hooper.”
Who would willingly embark upon this nightmarish journey, giving up everything until he has reached his target?
Sherlock didn’t waste any time unclasping her bra, revealing her small, perfectly round boobs. Joan removed with ease the sports bra she was wearing. Her breasts were heavier, fuller, her large pink nipples getting hard and pointed up.
His time – and his injury – in Afghanistan has taught him at least one thing – it was better to be his own man. To rely on himself. To be able to say “No” to absurd orders, which could potentially endanger others and…
“Let’s cut to the chase, shall we? There’s an aphrodisiac, Mr. Holmes. It works wonders, and it’s fatally poisonous even in minimal doses. Piedra. If you ingest it, you’ll be incited to copulate immediately till your heart bursts. Rub it in your skin, you’ll go mad with your needs. It’s very, very dangerous. And used rarely, for its cost for creation is near astronomical.”
“Touch me,” she said. And my hand obeyed her command against my will. I lay my hand on her shoulder, I’m proud to note, and she felt soft like a flower petal under my touch. Sherlock had turned white next to me, fists clenched to restrain himself. He was a man proud of his intellect, of his cleverness and had always made crystal clear of his distaste for what ordinary people call passion. Him and his brother both, I knew, had no wish for any emotional nor physical connection with people. A mindless rush, the
“Would you like a cuppa tea? Warm up those bones of yours a bit.” Mrs. Hudson offered as she took the small towel back.
We shared a look, of embarrassment and relief as somehow, as we stitched our composure back together. The stuffy air inside the room cleared a bit, along with our head. Acolea then glanced at the window and shrugged, wrapped and wrapped herself in the blanket many times over and fell back onto the chair with a satisfied sigh.
“Sherlock, I won’t last two more seconds if you had your hand on my cock.  Trust me, I’ll come anyway.”
“John, listen to me.  You tensed up somewhere between your cock being in my mouth to my cock being in your arse.  You’re okay now.  I’m not going in until you’re ready.  Do you trust me?”
“When you go into doctor mode, you start talking as though you have a mouse in your pocket and the pair of you will fix me,” Sherlock sank back into the bed, shivering.  “I need my heating pad.”
“Here is an ice pack.  Keep it on.  Sleep with it in place.  When the ice melts, get more.  Try to keep your hip straight for the next day or so.  The bruise is bad.  The cold will slow down the progression but you have to take care of it.”
He heard a few deep breathes escaping his patient and noticed the muscles begin to relax.  “That’s it.  Keep breathing.  You’re going to feel a cold pressure increasing as the probe goes in but it shouldn’t hurt.  Tell me if it does.”
“Yeah, we could do that.  In the in-between times we’ll take walks.  Long walks and have lovely chats with a lady I like to call Ella.”
“Are you done yet?”  Sherlock asked somewhat less then patiently.  He had gotten dressed in his usual suit but didn’t bother putting the suit jacket back on.  He had his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and was now pacing the room in anticipation.
Sherlock broke away from the kiss and locked eyes with John.  “No, not there.  Use your hands, both of them.  Feel my arms.  They’re taut, keeping myself above you without hurting you.  My shoulders locked to bear my weight.  Feel my back, down my spine, my buttocks, all yours, John.  Every muscle, every fiber yours and hungry with desire for you.  Feel your legs, bent and open, resting at my sides, ready to take me in.
“That’s it.  Just feel me.”  He stroked slowly in and out pulling his cock along without need to bottom out inside of John, without need to gain better purchase, without the need to pound into him.  His hands stroked up and down John’s body, learning every square inch, his scar, birthmarks, every ridge of every muscle.  His cock stroked inside of him, learning him, owning him.
“Sherlock.  I’m sorry, but it’s getting very uncomfortable.  It’s so tight.”  John fidgeted.  “Now that I’ve come, it’s too much.”
“Yes, I can see that for myself since I can quite clearly see your glans hanging out the bottom of your right pants leg.”
“That was, hands down, the funnest medical procedure I’ve ever had in my life.”  Sherlock blew out a loud breath.  “Well, the procedures themselves aside, I think, but the intrigue …”
“Good.”  John relaxed back into his chair.  Sherlock missed the touch the moment it was gone.  “So, what on earth is your overbearing, big brother doing?”
John nodded his head once.  “Right, well.  It would seem that I did come to some incorrect deductions.”
Sherlock debated sitting back on his haunches and watching his own fingers move inside of John’s body, preparing him.  If he moved back away from John, it would probably be more comfortable for John to keep himself in control and prevent him from coming.  If he did that, however, then he would miss those delicious and satisfying noises and he wanted those.  Every single one of them.  He wanted the feel of his breath on his cheek every time he pushed inside of John with his finger.  Oh, the breath that escaped his lover when he added a second finger was … ugh, god … so fucking gorgeous.  He wished he could keep every single breath that escaped John unbidden as he gasped and tried not to undulate beneath him.  He would lock each and every one of them up in their own box and open them one at a time, slowly, next to his ear to keep John next to him on the days John would have to leave his side.
“No, you won’t.  You have a fever.  You’re not cold, you just feel like you are,” John found the heating pad Sherlock had requested tucked away on a shelf between a framed beetle collection and an old chemistry book on one of Sherlock’s shelves.  He plugged it in and put it on Sherlock’s belly.
“Yes.  I’ll need seminal fluid, but I’m not doing that today.  You’ve been examined and depleted of enough fluids for one day.  It seems sort of tail to top the order I’ve done things but I’m going to do a complete physical on you tomorrow.  I’ll get the sample then.”
“Oh, you didn’t care to notice it because, as always, you negate your own safety in order to get your man.  As soon as he jumped the fence, your decision was made even if it had been covered in broken glass.”
“Ah,” Sherlock thought for a moment he could just leave but thought again about the reason he was here, “yes, of course.”  Sherlock nodded and proceeded slowly toward Mike or was it Matt?  Something with an M, definitely.
“FUCK!”  I was not prepared for that.  I don’t know why I wasn’t prepared.  I am a doctor with full knowledge of the prostate and what its function is but I was not expecting it to feel like that.  My lips are numb.  Oh, ….
Then time ran out.  With his capture in Serbia came the death of everything he ever dreamed of for him and John.  It wasn’t the rape and the torture that made him feel like happiness was not an option for him ever again.  Not at first.  The first several weeks of being endlessly tortured and abused, he was still a strong man.  A man fighting for something.  A man who still had a soul and was willing to claw his way back to normalcy.  The Neanderthal cretins in that Serbian prison couldn’t hold him down.  He had too much to fight for.  No, it wasn’t the simple fact of the things he had gone through.  Time has a funny way of wreaking havoc on your dreams.  Time, absolute lengths and lengths of time being beaten, starved, dehydrated, burned, the list went on.  A week felt more like a month.  A month more like a year.  Time chips away at everything you thought you were or thought you could be and everything you dreamed you could be is more and more out of reach.  He was just beaten down and raw and then scabbed over and scarred.  Time, as much as the things he had survived, had broken him.
Sherlock blearily and begrudgingly opened one eye slightly.  Only enough to confirm his suspicions of Mycroft being in the room and then closed it again, sighing heavily.
John smiled and kissed Sherlock releasing the lip before taking it between his own teeth and giving it a gentle tug.
Sherlock rose from the chair and started unbuttoning his trousers.  “I think there is lube in your kit,” he said as he headed toward the kitchen.
“There were various forms of torture, least of all were the sexual forms.  I’ll tell you in as much detail as you would like to hear, but not now, not here.”
“Because it’s information I might need.  Do you know how many murders are committed over matters of sex, John?  Ninety percent …”
Once Sherlock nodded his understanding, John pressed the probe inside gently, slowly.  “There it is.  You alright?”
John kneeled next to Sherlock’s head and bent down to kiss him.  He licked the roof of his mouth slowly, then nipped at Sherlock’s lip.  Sherlock was kissing him back albeit lazily and slowly.  John kissed his lover until he was satisfied then kissed his jaw and his collar bone.  Finally he sat up, still knelt next to Sherlock’s head.  He placed his thumb on Sherlock’s chin and pushed down gently, opening his lover’s mouth.  “Can I put my cock in your mouth, Sherlock?  I’m so close.  Can you suck me off?”
“Of course you are,” John sighed.  “C’mon, up you get,” John pulled up from under Sherlock’s arms and the man cooperated and stood although a bit shakily.  “Whoa, there we go.  Let’s get you properly seated.”
He chuckled and grabbed my face in his hands bringing me back to him.  “We don’t have to do this yet if you need time to adjust.”
“After the other night, after this entire weekend, you still have doubts about your importance in my life?”
“Well, now that you’ve saved your lovely coat, why don’t you come back over here and let’s have a bit of a grind, shall we?”
“He says ‘Doctor, I think if you just press a little harder next time!’ As if I should continue!  I was livid.  I told him it was past time he got dressed and I sent him off.  I looked him up on the computer system.  He’s had four prostate exams in the last six months.  He’s a wanker!”
John turned his head to the side after a brief brush of lips.  “Sherlock … ugh …”  John squeezed his eyes closed once again.  “Sherlock … you can’t … don’t touch me at all except to … I’m sorry, but if you want inside me before I come, you can’t … you can’t touch me, or talk … please, just … oh god, please Sherlock.”  John’s body was a bundle of tense muscles.  It took all he had to not thrust upward, his body begging for the friction he knew hovered inches above him.  His arms flailed to his sides not wanting to take in the muscled arms of his lover, the smooth expanses of skin that would send him so easily over the edge.
Sherlock sighed.  “It’s nothing.  Just a flesh wound.”  Sherlock finally had his coat off and he flung himself face-first onto the sofa.
“No, it’s called Nightingale syndrome.  You appreciate how I’ve taken care of you.  I would be a cad if I took advantage of your vulnerable state.  I know your history with other medical professionals, I’ve made sure to treat you with care.  It’s made you feel things you don’t really feel.”
Mycroft tilted his head slightly and gave Sherlock a pitying look.  It made Sherlock want to scratch his eyes out.  “You’ll need medical attention.”
“You do have a way with words, stud.”  Sherlock stole another kiss and smiled warmly.  “Where do you want me?”
“Pardon my ignorance, John, but this is hardly what I had pictured and I don’t know what you’re on about.”
“Oh!  John!”  Sherlock flung his head back, keeping his hands in John’s hair, locking him in place.  “Oh!”
Sitting back on his haunches, he took in the full sight of John flushed and naked.  So beautiful.  So achingly gorgeous.  He placed the condom on his own cock and smeared his penis with the lube.  He placed some more at John’s entrance and then pushed a finger inside him.  John gasped and pulled away a bit.
John looked around anxiously. "Shh ... jeezus christ. Sherlock, we are in the wrong place for you to prove that to me and besides, it doesn't matter. I told you ... we're fine. It's all fine. There's no need for all this."
Finally he sat up, shifted forward and thrust two fingers inside me.  “Is that agreeable to you then?”
“And I would rather be delirious with fever than feel nauseated.  I cannot tolerate the sensation of ejecting my stomach contents.  It’s disgusting.  And it hurts,” Sherlock added.
“Yes, of course they do, but how much of it did you stop?  Not just in Serbia but wherever else you went while you were away, the countless cases before you left and the ones since you’ve been back.”  John stood and turned facing Sherlock.  “You saved my life Sherlock.  You are a hero a million times over and I know that because I’m here.  Because I’m standing right here and I shouldn’t be,” he cleared his throat and shifted his weight. “I should have been dead, could have been dead so many times, but you saved me Sherlock.  So, no, I wouldn’t dare compare my story to yours.”  John looked away and then back again at Sherlock, his best friend.  “I wouldn’t compare us because you, Sherlock, are much more brave and a much better man than I am, by far.”
“Tell me.”  I breathed into his neck.  I kissed his ear.  I brought his arms down to his sides.  I’m confident he’s not going to slam me and run away at this point.  The touch of his flesh wakes up long repressed emotions.
John rolled his eyes.  “Fine,” and he lifted his hips off the table as Sherlock dragged his boxers off and tossed them aside.
God that had taken a lot for John to say.  Sherlock had to take a moment to mold his melted heart back into shape.  He had to keep his breathing steady and his true emotion hidden under the mask of confusion when he was dying inside.  His next words were going to hurt him.  It pained him to know that and to have to witness it himself.
“So, like I said, I examined him.  I was quick and efficient, but quite thorough and then removed my finger.  I told him I was finished and he could stand up but the man collapsed against the table and started weeping.  Naturally, I asked him what was wrong.  He started talking about how his father had annual screenings too and that the physician hadn’t been thorough enough and had missed something and that his poor old dad had died because his doctor just didn’t take the time.”  John huffed in anger as he remembered the incident from earlier that day.
Malcolm was the first to recover from the shock.  “Dr. Watson?  Doc, what’re you doin’ here this time a the mornin’?”
They heard no such thing when they rounded the second corner only to run smack dab into the brick wall that was Malcolm, the regular security guard.
“Do you think that because I’m a doctor that I save more lives than you?  That I deserve more than you?”
“This is a cystoscope.”  He held up the long, black wire, a bit thicker than a straw, with a handle on the end.  “See here is the camera end”  he showed the blunt end to Sherlock,  “and then it sends me the image to the larger end so I can see what it sees.” He showed, in turn, the bigger, handled end with a surface similar to a microscope eyepiece.  “They do have the ability to put the image up onto a screen but that takes a bit to set up and we don’t have time for it.  You might get an erection, you might piss yourself.  Either is expected so don’t bother with being embarrassed.  You alright?”
“It’s practical I suppose.”  Sherlock conceded as he helped John out of his last vestiges of clothing.  Grabbing John’s hand, he pulled him along and assisted him to lie down on the bed before ruffling through John’s supplies.
“Right.”  He opened his gown and stood stiffly, shifting.  “Well, this is ridiculous.  What do I do with my hands?”  He dropped them to his side, then shifted a hip, then cocked one hand on a hip.  Smiling, he settled both hands on his hips and jutted them forward in a perfect imitation of Superman, blue dressing gown flowing behind him.  “Appropriate, I should think given the exceptionally long urethra I have.”
He looked so torn, so desperate.  It was as though I was the only key to solving the riddle inside his head.  I don’t know why I did it, but I leaned in quickly, took his face between my palms and kissed him.  It was electric.  I was imploding with want for him.  Maybe it was partly the intensity with which he wanted me, but I simply could not sit still any longer.
“Well I do hope you know that’s not an option anymore," John admonished.  “I don’t mind if you would rather I not be your doctor, but you cannot dismiss treatment.  That’s just NOT on.  If you want me to stop, then you’ll just have to go to A&E from now on.  That’s it.”
“Sorry?  Calculated what? Were you really trying to flirt with her?”  John asked sounding much more panicked than what he was going for.
“No!  Sherlock, stop.  Just stop right there.  I’m not … I’m not gay.  Let’s get that straight once and for all.  I’m a doctor and you have an obvious injury.  That’s all, but thanks for insinuating I would use my profession to have an excuse to grope at you.  A fine opinion you must have of me so far.”  John looked abashed and went toward the kitchen.
“Wait,” Sherlock stopped John from walking away.  “I … I appreciate the offer.  I’ll strip off in my room.  Give me a few moments first?”
Sherlock had arrived at the sofa. “Good,” he motioned toward it, “we’ll be here for a while. Sit please.”
John put a finger to the side of his face and leaned back.  “Yes,” he paused briefly “you were tortured and raped in a Serbian prison?”
Sherlock was relieved John didn’t hate him.  He had smiled, made flirty innuendos so he obviously had not done anything too … not good.  He wondered if John had orgasmed at all.  He didn’t remember.  He knew he hadn’t assisted John in that area but he knew it hadn’t lasted very long all together and he was rather selfish, especially in those last moments.  He supposed John could have come during the sex and then cleaned him up after he had flipped Sherlock over onto his back next to John.  John could have masturbated himself after Sherlock had fallen asleep.  He had no idea.  He was sorry that the only time he would ever have the opportunity to see John come he had passed right out directly after orgasm.  He wasn’t sure what the hell that meant but he was sure it was not a great technique.
“No seriously.  Is that what you mean?  Because if we’re taking score, I think you’re up on me by far, Mr Holmes.  By far.  You said it yourself, you went to Serbia to take down a criminal network.  How many lives do you think you saved by doing that.  Not just those that would be murdered or killed directly but then the collateral damage after that.  The blackmail, fraud, treason, bribery, forgery, exploitation, trafficking drugs and humans, the list is endless, Sherlock.”
The dark circles under Greg’s eyes as well as the lines of stress creasing his face were nothing new for the DI, as far as John knew him. But the anxious weariness shining in his dark gaze or his reluctance to talk about what was going on at the Yard, when he usually didn’t shy away from describing his current cases to John, made him pause.
John was strolling along the aisles of the grocery store, looking for Sherlock’s favourite tea – his lover has expensive tastes although he wouldn’t admit it under pain of death – when he heard his phone chiming.
Oh bugger it all, he thought. Whoever this SH was, he was able to make the anxiety-ridden teenager John has been come back up to the surface. Time to speak like a former soldier.
If he couldn’t talk to her, at least, he could do things for her while she was forced to stay here. She thanked him with a smile “Well, it’s not something I would ask to anyone, but I think it might interest you… And really, John, you could do with a bit of fresh air, you’re much too pale!”
You knew then that joy and happiness might wait a very long time to find you, bursting into bloom when you least expected it.
“I said I owe you an apology,” Mycroft repeated, his voice gaining confidence. “I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did, it was most… rude of me to treat you like this and…”
And then, him, a perfect stranger without any experience on the field, came and dazzled everyone with his never-ending flow of deductions, bringing mercilessly to light NSY finest’s flaws. And he did so without having to attend any training in criminology, behavioural science or whatever was required to be hired by NSY.
Sherlock, dressed as usual in black from head to toe, was still smiling brightly at the stranger standing behind her when she spotted her friend.
“Your… Oh!” John gasped out, relief flooding him. Turning his head, he glimpsed the 221a door through which he could hear the BBC newsreader’s posh voice.
“It seemed your brother has gone to great lengths to rise to your so-called challenge… and to pose one of his own to you in the process.”
“What would be the point?” Mycroft asked, looking up at his currently very sassy assistant. “Weren’t you the one who said a few days ago, in reply to my quite innocent remark, I might add, about your efficient way of tackling the unwelcome advances of Lord May “if you got it, flaunt it!”?
“Molly’s here,” she said between clenched teeth. “I hope for your sake that’s not your idea of a joke…”
Of course, it hasn't been easy. They both had to endure jeers and homophobic slurs. John lost his so-called friends and was bullied for a brief time at university until the authorities decided to listen to him and took his case seriously. Sherlock learned how to be civil to John's relatives - not always an easy task, considering what he has already deduced in their regard concerning how they've treated his partner before.
He was going to put the kettle on when he heard the repetitive thud of Mrs Hudson’s crutches up the stairs. He sighed with frustration – the damn woman was going to kill herself one of these days! – before rushing to open the door and help her.
Was it a gift from one of the children attending the community garden, too shy to give it personally? (but he didn’t really get the chance yet to spend time with them, so why would they give him a gift? It didn’t make sense.)
“Don’t tell me you sent him off on holiday. Because, in this case, John Watson deserves all my sympathy!”
He has even set up a brand-new website, for God’s sake, establishing himself as “consulting detective”, taking over boldly this title while proving he was worth it on the field.
“Nice try. As if that nasty piece of shit wouldn’t be found and dealt with as soon as we set foot in that room.”
A feeling so powerful that it would drive him to his knees, tears sliding down his cheeks, if he dared to dwell on it.
“Don’t you understand?” Sherlock replied, his words ringing with sincerity. “Now is the start of our life together. I don’t care if you’re not going to last more than 30 seconds if I do that…”
Joan was on her feet in the blink of an eye, walking to Sherlock, unconsciously reaching out before she could realise it.
Two hours later, he got a complete phone number. The forget-me-nots, which have been sown in large clumps all over the garden, have given him quite the headache, but fortunately for his nerves, the red camellia and the bluebells were easier, each of them having been planted in specific locations.
He sagged a little further into his plastic seat. Fortunately for him, who didn’t like the crowded, cramped places since Afghanistan and Sherlock’s mood, there were only a few people besides them in the carriage – a group of teenagers obviously playing truant and an old couple bickering over who was going to prepare what for supper.
And if he correctly judged the looks Sherlock was currently garnering with his way of dancing, he wasn’t the only one to think so. John gnashed his teeth, resisting the temptation to snarl at anyone coming closer to his date.
Thoroughly humiliated, Sherlock fought the impulse to bury his face in his hands. He met instead Mycroft’s faintly amused gaze and spat out every word.
Then John would have slowly brought up the box before getting down on a knee and finally saying the words he has thought about for months now.
“I have another idea…” she murmured before softly pushing Joan backwards. She took the hint and lay down on the bed, her eyes never leaving Sherlock’s face. Joan made no attempt at coyness – she knew her body and wasn’t shy of it. Granted, she wasn’t overly fond of the bullet scar on her left shoulder, but she has made her peace with it for a long time.
He pointed out as subtly as he could the dark-haired woman, dressed to the nines, with high heels that could certainly be considered as lethal weapons. Mike glanced at her before turning  his head away.
“What he meant was…” he started but his attempt was nipped in the bud by their hostess’ laugh. She shook her head, visibly amused, before putting down both glasses in front of them.
But what has mattered at the end has been the fact that Sherlock has saved him, putting himself at risk for John’s sake.
John suddenly snapped back to reality, blinking at Sherlock who was standing in front of him, hands on his hips, an irritated expression on his face.
“Replicas of Leonard’s creations!” Sherlock breathlessly answered, his whole face glowing with joy. “Oh my, it’s even better than in the book!” he whispered before running at top speed to the nearest machine. At that moment, he looked every inch like the child he must have been, the gangling boy, curious of everything the world has yet to offer him. Despite what has just happened and the crushing disappointment he was feeling right now, John couldn’t help but smile, especially when he heard Sherlock crying out “Oh, that’s terrific! And it works!”
“… so Langdon and Sophie managed to escape the police and they found in a bank vault a cryptex. (John pointed the small black screen out.) And it exactly used the same system, of course without the spy device inside!”
What was Sherlock thinking? Flirting shamelessly with his soldier instead of focusing on their case… Or rather, she thought, he wasn’t thinking with his brain. It was the whole problem.
Except that, if John’s theory was correct, Sherlock has precisely done so before, with the bunch of forget-me-nots.
And then Sherlock smiled. It was quite shy, but nonetheless radiant. A smile which seems to promise everything John thought he would never find again when he has come back in London – loyalty, friendship and a strong hint of this intimacy he could read in the darkened eyes of his companion.
A full flush was creeping across his face and John couldn’t meet Ross’ gaze as he awkwardly stammered out
As he was threading his way among the trees and other shrubs, trying not to trample plants which could easily be damaged, he felt a trickle of sweat running the length of his spine. Of course during his military career as well as when he went out with Sherlock, he has taken part in many stakeouts, hoping that someone – or something – would finally break off the never-ending wait.
Not the content per se. John couldn’t really care about the various types of tobacco and the means to identify the different ashes. What got him completely enthralled was what he was feeling behind Sherlock’s words – the blazing passion when he was writing about his work, the sheer determination he seemed to dedicate to everything catching his fancy…
“Of course, my dear!” her date said. He flashed a last smile to Joan. “It has been a pleasure, Miss Watson.”
He padded over to the kettle, his morning reflexes getting the upper hand while his mind feverishly attempted to make sense of this mess. He tried to establish links between the various clues he had at his disposal. But the more he thought about it, the more he only obtained questions instead of answers.
John sat down on the one of the garden’s benches, completely dazed. Dave’s explanation has left him mouth open, his throat suddenly dry. It couldn’t be true. Sherlock didn’t care about feelings. He wouldn’t do… something like that.
He shook his head and his pain was so clear to see Sherlock found in himself the necessary strength to try to soothe him.
“I warn you, that shower is a real disaster, barely any pressure in it and how dare they saying that it is a comfortable hotel, I… John?”
She saw Sherlock grinding his teeth, his jaw set in an angry line. A shadow of his old self, a sight which gave her enough strength to stop laughing and say “I warn you, Sherlock Holmes. If you ever hurt again John, Greg or Mrs Hudson, there’ll be hell to pay.”
To his great surprise and relief, he found himself telling her everything, from their first “meeting” at the Honeybee to the text he has sent earlier.
Unable to resist the pull any longer, he strode forward until he was close enough to feel John’s warmth. He delicately took his hands in his, warming them up.
Long, warm shivers racked John’s frame when he dared to imagine himself being the focus of this attention.
And – at least in Anthea’s case – greatly enjoying the seduction game she was regularly playing with the ladies she met after work or during the weekend.
“I have gathered,” Mycroft drily retorted. “But what for? Getting a leg over at the end of the day?”
He was expecting his companion asking “How do you know I was in the army?” but couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed. A bit sad as well. After all, he knew what would happen after he told the other man all he has deduced in his regard – the outraged disbelief, the way the person tried to hide his or her discomfort, screaming he was a liar, he had to have gathered information on them beforehand and wasn’t he a gigantic arsehole?
“Will”, she said, pronouncing his name in a way which made John frown, “if you would be so kind to listen to this gentleman…”
“Your protection? It comes with much too high a price. Can you only imagine the consequences for the ones you left behind?”
John remained frozen on the spot, staring wide-eyed at his sister – the one person he would never have expected to appear one day on his flat’s threshold. His disbelieving surprise coloured his voice, turning it into a gruff growl as he asked
He was expecting Sherlock to answer him something flirty or downright filthy – when motivated, Sherlock could use every weapon in his arsenal of seduction.
“It’s the last time,” he softly replied and felt his cheeks burning even further. He didn’t dare looking at Ross and to his horror, his vision turned blurry. He heard Ross sighing before a hand fell on his shoulder, making him jump.
He leaned forwards, his eyes never leaving John’s, noticing every small change in his gaze and finding nothing which would make him pull back. The moment seemed to stretch out for ever. John’s breath wafted over his face and Sherlock shivered, anticipating what was going – what was bound – to happen, already savouring…
Murderous ideas were already invading her mind, all directed at Sherlock’s “date”. She would kill him with her bare hands, she decided. Adrenalin was pulsing through her veins, creating this buzz of energy just begging to be released. Joan has already experienced this feeling when she was in the army, getting ready for an offensive.
Greg’s voice immediately changed as soon as he heard the name and John allowed himself a smug little smile.
Sherlock immediately took advantage of this move, leaning forward and pickpocketing John’s phone without any difficulty.
Sherlock nodded. He has suspected as much when Mycroft has told him that his “friend” wouldn’t like the police to be involved in that case; Mrs Dubusson seemed calm and composed, but this appearance was betrayed by the minute trembles he could observe in her hands. Her amused and slightly challenging demeanour has disappeared, being replaced by a nervousness against which she struggled, now that the time has come for explanations.
And they were certainly doing that, John absentmindedly mused. He forgot the club, the stale smells floating around, the foreign bodies brushing against his in the throes of dancing. He forgot everything which wasn’t Sherlock.
Sherlock didn't reply, feigning to pay attention to the estate agent's enthusiastic speech while watching once again the cherished memories he has so carefully stored in his Mind Palace.
Tracing a series of harder, shorter kisses along Sherlock’s mouth, eliciting a moan from the other woman.
Molly frowned, aware that the speed-dating séance which has looked so fun earlier did little to arouse her interest now. She glanced at the few stragglers, who hastened to find their place again around their tables, hoping to find Irene, when she heard behind her
He heard John’s hitch in his breath, felt his hands roaming over the back of his neck, stroking his cheek, his neck.
A homecoming he could nearly feel on his lips, his desire, his need for it vibrating in every bone of his, rising in his blood.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” he whispered, his lips grazing John’s cheek. “But I would rather carry on our activities without waking up my landlady, if it’s all the same to you…”
As for Mycroft’s private life… It was a whole other story, much to his well-hidden dismay. Especially when a certain Detective Inspector was concerned.
He couldn’t help snorting at the idea of firing a shot at some unfortunate mouse for the sake of a few tulips. A sure way to find himself locked away in an institution.
“Come on,” Mycroft whispered, leaning in until his lips were grazing Greg’s cheek, “Let me tell you all about it…”
John gasped – a sound which was sure to be drowned in the low, pulsing music. However, he could have sworn Sherlock has heard it, considering how his pupils seemed to dilate. Sherlock opened his mouth and John took fright of what he could say.
Molly clapped a hand on her mouth while understanding shone in her dark eyes. No doubt she realized – way too late – that Sherlock and she weren’t here for their pleasure.
He smothered groan, not even attempting to get his mind out of the gutter as far as Will was concerned.
He tilted his head down and without caring about anyone who might find them there, he kissed him. At first soft and slow, then hard and deep. And John was responding in kind, lips tasting, tongue dancing in his mouth, teeth nipping at red, abused skin. A snog which set Sherlock aflame and propelled him into a sensual heaven the like of which he has never experienced. He gripped John’s sweater tighter. Now he has found him, he would never let this man go.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock repeated, her expression so earnest, so sincere that Joan couldn’t look away. “I know I should have talked to you about it. About Cox and the setup. But I was a coward. I was afraid to put you in danger and… I decided to leave you out.”
She has lovely breasts, big enough that he could dream of sliding his cock between them, leaving a wet trail behind. Jane has pushed him down on her bed, straddling him immediately afterwards, grinding her sex against his.
In reality, they have ended up fucking furiously a good part of the night, morning finding them completely spent.
She couldn’t even finish her question, she was shaking with such a mix of anger and fear she has never felt before. Sherlock briefly looked up at her before turning her head away.
“Oh, I’m sure you’re clever enough to solve this riddle,” Ross replied in kind. His gaze suddenly hardened. “And your brother is way more than a mere customer for me. He has helped me when I was in a terrible mess, storming his way in one day and revealing to me how my former bastard of business partner was embezzling the
John heard Greg’s hitch in his breath over the phone before he asked in a voice which has managed to lose in a second all its previous warmth.
But before he could think of something to say, Sherlock dropped his gaze, staring absentmindedly at his paper serviette he was currently tearing into shreds.
“Great to know that from now on, Lestrade is your new partner. Is she going to be your new flatmate as well?”
He rubbed some warmth back into his fingers, silently cursing the cold weather at this time of the year. He knew that he has condemned himself to several sleepless nights, sitting in this hideout, and for a result of which he couldn’t be certain.
“I’m sorry to have brought this up, it’s just that sometimes, whenever a cab stops near a crime scene, I expect to see him making a dash towards us, hurling abuse at Anderson and loudly saying we’re all idiots…”
“Save it, Lestrade. Sally is at least right for one thing – you don’t need to play peacemaker between me and your colleagues.”
Thoughts which were brought to a crashing halt when he glanced up at John, who was obviously waiting for him while fiddling around with something in his pocket.
Since he has celebrated his seventh birthday, heartily blowing his cake’s candles while pretending to roll his eyes at his Mum’s antics, Sherlock has taken pride in never letting any tear run down his cheek.
He gritted his teeth, making a U-turn and walking in the living room. But, once again, as he reached out for the phone, the ringtone abruptly stopped.
Greg raised an eyebrow, stifling the smile threatening to bloom on his lips. He wanted to tease the man, not to get him to run for the hills.
The Copper Killer case – such a ridiculous nickname, really! – was but the first of his many successes. Sherlock could almost taste on his tongue, hear the echo of his flourishing future in the wind whistling in his ear and tousling his hair.
The illusion’s face was flushed, it has closed its eyes as if it couldn’t bear the sight of Greg and he fell his stomach giving a sickening lurch.
But now it wasn’t for the sake of the British Army. No, if she would take up arms, it would be against the nasty piece of shit who has hurt his friend.
because Detective Inspector Lestrade has been babbling about, no doubt recasting the events in such a way that Mycroft found himself the butt for ridicule.
He can’t breathe. He can’t think. Surely he must be hallucinating the whole thing, there’s no other explanation.
“It’s our wildlife area,” Hussein said, breaking the silence. “You will be amazed at seeing all the insects, birds and other beasts which have found refuge over there!”
“We don’t have time for this, Gavin,” Sherlock broke off, ignoring the policeman’s protest – “It’s Greg for God’s sake!”. “I trust Irene has briefed you on that case?”
He should give up right now. Delete his text and Sherlock’s answer. Trying once more to forget this man and that was just the crux of the problem because in the two months since Mister Curls has left the Honeybee, John hasn’t succeeded in getting him out of his head.
A few seconds later, John found himself lying down on the blanket. Looming over him, Sherlock stared at him, his curly hair a complete mess.
He wasn’t as smart as the Holmes brothers – they were in a category on their own – but despite what Sherlock firmly implied every time Greg asked for his help, he wasn’t a complete idiot. The current expression on Mycroft’s face clearly gave him to understand that Mycroft, if he had been alone when he had been notified of Greg’s visit, wouldn’t have agreed to let him come up here.
John leant heavily on his cane, slowly climbing the stairs up to 221b. Sherlock has gone upstairs ahead of him, only crying out “Going to take a shower, make yourself at home!” before vanishing in the bathroom.
His hand remained steady as he typed first his message followed by the phone number mentioned on Sherlock’s website.
Besides, the last texts were… sweet. Curious. Silly stuff which made his lips twitch and his fingers itch to type a reply.
A struggle which has been abruptly concluded a few months ago, when John has decided to take advantage of Sherlock’s absence one evening to settle on his bed and enjoy a good, leisurely long wank. He got everything ready – the towel underneath him so not to stain his sheets, the lube and especially the wank fantasy he was going to use.
Sherlock’s voice has lost the authority it has demonstrated during their love making. It sounded frail and a bit shy. Instinctively John held him closer.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you’re enjoying our Dating Game! We know that you’re living very emotional moments, so we would like to offer you now a fifteen-minute break. Don’t hesitate to mingle with our other guests and to get a drink at our bar…”
He took a deep breath, feeling the well-being induced by alcohol leaving his system. Gosh, he’d really need a drink when the illusion had vanished.
When they drew up, gasping for breath, John was so close he could have wept. But Sherlock seemed to have other plans.
Or rather something else than the void still growing inside him, beast gnawing with greedy teeth at what was left of his heart.
No. It wasn’t his way – and it wasn’t John’s either. They’ve always been “all or nothing”, taking risks since their first meeting.
It was to be expected, after all, when a young woman was working for a middle-aged, die hard bachelor such as himself. Such were the ways of this sexist, heteronormative society, when one couldn’t see a single woman in company with a man without imagining a sexual relationship blooming between them, Mycroft thought with a resigned sigh.
An understatement, John has thought, but he wasn’t willing to wax poetic about Sherlock, Greg might end up having a stroke.
“Mister “I am basically the British government”, the DI resumed, “couldn’t manage to book rooms for you when he sent you off to France?”
When he finally came out from the tube station, he was panting for breath. He was getting his breath back when a familiar coat appeared in front of him.
Although it has been a moan rather than an order, he immediately complied, reining in his desire to bite and suck, marking the tender skin as his. He brushed an almost chaste kiss on John’s cheek.
John glanced at Sherlock, who was still exploring the garden’s treasures, leaping about from one complex machine to another. He shook his head when he saw Sherlock setting foot inside… Was it some kind of a tank?
He morosely looked at the list he has been given at the start of the speed-dating event – a list which remained completely unticked yet. While he has been chatting amicably with the women in front of him – at least until Kelly – he hasn’t felt any spark during their discussions.
Who was he kidding? Of course, he has been counting! Keeping a mental tally of the days since Mister Curls has been missing from
“The box” was an accurate description for Serge’s poisoned gift to his sister. A heavy, black safe, Sherlock mused, touching its smooth outline with the utmost care. On the front side lay a small black screen and below it, a numeric keypad. Sherlock leant in to observe it and a red light immediately came to life, attracting his attention as well as John’s.
“It’s fine that you love my voice. I love yours too. Or the fact that you love every second spent with me. I do love it too. In fact, I… I love you, John.”
Without speaking of the fact that without her, the harasser might not have been put under lock and key.
“You see, I’m a plot holder in this community garden and it brings its share of duties. Of course, I know that a volunteer can replace me for the next weeks, but I wouldn’t like to give them even more work, they’re already snowed under at the moment… So, would you mind terribly if I put your name down for some of the weekly chores?”
“Might be.” He tapped the suspect on the cheek. “Be sure that we will go through your computer log files with a fine-tooth comb.”
Sherlock resentfully came out of the tank replica, stepping on the green law. The 10-year-old boy who still survived in him vigorously resented being interrupted in his garden exploration by the unknown female voice whose echo was still lingering in the air.
Whatever he has hoped – or dreaded – to find on his date’s face it wasn’t this amused, affectionate look solely directed at him.
He stopped to pull the device free from his pocket. The screen glowing at the touch of his fingers sent a thrill of excitement coursing through his veins – how many times has he stared at his phone, reading a text from Sherlock?
“I’m… I’m sorry. You were right, I flirted with you earlier, I even nearly kissed you when we were both on top of that wall! (He licked his lips.) Truth is, I’ve been waiting for a very long time for you to kiss me, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock sighed, a complicated sound of irritation and resignation, before exchanging an eloquent glance with Irene, who didn’t waste any time understanding what was going on in his head.
“I take it you’re on a recreational side of business?” Sherlock leaned even further forward with a glint in his eyes. He looked as if he’d fall off his chair. I took to studying the lines in Sherlock’s face, a relief from having to look at her. The glee I saw there bordered on manic.
As you are no doubt aware, I’ve long been writing the adventures of Sherlock Holmes on this blog. But there are things I must fabricate as to protect the privacy of those involved. There have also been occasions where Sherlock and I were dealt state secrets or other such information directly involving nations and their welfare. Such cases never see the light of day, hidden safely in my notes. Perhaps one day it may be deemed safe enough to be shared, but for now they sleep.
It was as if a spell was broken then, a taut leash snapped. I cleared my throat and sank into my armchair as much as I could. Similarly, Sherlock loosened his hold on Acolea, allowing her to wiggle from his embrace.
“Quite right. And that’s what I am, what I was cultivated to be. A deadly flower, to lure the bees for a taste of nectar, to provide a last feast.”
It was an early evening like any other except for the storm, in London. It was raining dreadful like, cold radiating off the tall windows and dark like the dead of night. I sat in my armchair with a newspaper in hand. Mrs. Hudson had just brought a cup of tea and biscuits with a tart
She was a very toned woman. Like models, really, though she was more on the slender side than curvy. The lines on her body were tight, inviting like how a flower might beckon to a bee. She leaned back as if it was the most natural thing to do, poised like a stretching cat.
“My image will haunt you behind your closed lids,” she smiled, a sly grin with a tug on a side of her lips.
“Can you hear the want in my breath?” She whispered, crawling up his legs. Her voice was like honey, sweet and runny, and her warm breath tickled our ears. In my head I could hear her moans and I had to swallow to keep from the embarrassment of salivating like a starved fool.
It was remarkable how ordinary it was. Everything, really, everything was perfectly ordinary. Until Sherlock whipped away his violin and gave a shout, “we’ve got ourselves a client!”
Just as I thought he was going to throw her onto the floor so that he could taste her nectar, she burst out laughing. Acolea fell apart with incomprehensible mirth in Sherlock’s arms, almost falling backwards before Sherlock caught her.
And she smiled so radiant, it was amazing. It was actually amazing, that a person could look like that. I had never known a woman could be so alluring. And all she’d done was give an introduction.
was amused, no doubt. For her smile was that of an unaffected bystander. She had settled into Sherlock’s lap at this point, arms wrapped around his neck and torso flush against his. Her legs fell over the sides of his hip, dangling. Her lingerie kept her decency precariously intact, and yet it was somehow more intimate than if she had been bare.
“Will you resist my scent?” And then I was aware, of the heavenly scent surrounding her. It made you feel as if you were floating atop a cloud, for it was a light scent, lulling you to complacency. It was sweet of course, everything about her was extraordinarily sweet, and somehow, I
“And what brings you out here in this weather, Acolea?” Sherlock crooned like nothing was out of ordinary, eyes devouring every inch of her for information. Then again, he was incredibly dense when it got to those sorts of things.
“Now this may sound insane, but I’ve been ingesting Piedra for as long as I can remember. Half a drop in a cup of water. Half a drop in my cereal bowl. Ever since I could eat solid food, just barely under fatal dosage. For years, Mr. Holmes, have I been fed Piedra without my knowledge.”
“Shut up.” He growled, before storming out of the flat. I gaped at the door and flinched when I heard his bedroom door slam. Hard enough to shake the building.
“I don’t know how I survived. It was an experiment, a secret project and I a specimen in a lab. Others died over the years, and eventually I was the only one left. I didn’t know any better then, as I was isolated for as long as I can remember. My only contact with the outside world were people in hazard suits that taught me things that they thought I should know and fed me poisoned food.”
