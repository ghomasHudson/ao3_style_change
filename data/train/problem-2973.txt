To reiterate, Dean is definitely more than a little jealous.
Cas let out a little noise that sounded suspiciously like a growl and took a step back, hands trailing down Dean’s arms before letting go of him completely. “I’ll see you upstairs. Five minutes.”
“I won’t regret it. I could never regret anything we’ve shared in our time together.” It’s as close to a confession as Cas will allow himself, but it seems to work because Dean softens.
And take it, Cas does. He moans at the stretch and pushes back against Dean’s hand, gasping with every brush of that sweet spot inside him. His cock is hard and leaking, staining the baby blue stain that encases it, and he works a hand into the panties to free the head so he’s dripping onto the comforter instead.
“That I love you? Fuck, Cas, how could you ever doubt…”
“Dean, I’m so sorry,” Cas said, squeezing Dean’s hand and getting a weak squeeze back in response.
“You know, not long before I lost you, when you stayed behind with Sam and I took Jack to Adam?” Cas nods. “Adam was shacked up with an angel. She kept him young and alive for thousands of years so they could stay together. Is that your plan for us?”
with her. No, he was more in love with the idea of her. Family, house, kids, regular 9-5 job. The things he’d idealized in his mind. The apple pie life that he’d simply inherited by fulfilling his dead brother’s wish.
It’s such a simple statement. Innocuous even, had they been mates. But for Cas to state it so easily, like it was nothing to want to protect an omega, like Dean was
Dean broke out into laughter, doubling over until he almost fell off of the swing. “So this character? It was a demon?”
Cas softened at Dean’s words, and wrapped his arms around him once more before pulling a blanket over them. “Anything you want, Dean,” he said, kissing the top of Dean’s head. The phrase was becoming their thing. It was their ‘Okay.’ It was their ‘As you wish.’
"On the edge of the tub.”
he thinks as he watches a bead of sweat trickle down the center of Dean’s back and disappear into his shorts.
Dean released a sigh of his own. He knew where the angel was coming from. When they left and finished their drive, they would be called to duty once more. Sure it was only a vamp nest-that was child's play to them nowadays-but it was still responsibility. People were dying.
Neither of them say a word about how Dean begged to be bitten. With any luck, it’s all a haze for Dean, and he won’t remember it at all.
Dean slaps his face again, then gives him a little shove before taking off down the hall and out the back door.
Dean couldn’t take his eyes off him. He watched greedily as the lean muscles in Cas’ shoulders twitched and flexed with his every movement. He saw the toned chest and distinct cut of the angel’s hipbones, and he felt his mouth go dry as he thought about what wonders hung at the end of that deeply carved V.
“Shit,” Dean said. Cas’ words had caused what little blood he had left in his brain to shoot south and his cock was rock hard and leaking between them. “Maybe we should have talked about this before, but how do you want to do this? We don’t have to go all the way if you’re not ready. We could just keep doing this.”
Dean rolls his hips against Cas’ and Cas can feel him, hard and heavy against his own quickly hardening cock.
“Dean, don’t hurt yourself. I saw you guys when I came home. You were so cute all wrapped up in his wings, but you could have at least tried to make it to bed,” Sam teased. “Though, once you finally did get there, it got a bit noisy after a while. But I have headphones, and I’m happy for you. It was a long time coming.”
something.
Lily squinted, searching the clearing for Castiel, but there was no sign of him in spite of the slight pull of his grace. There was a young man present, the nephilim, perhaps? She knew from her studies on angels that nephilim could control their own rate of growth and that survival instincts could cause them to mature in the virtual blink of an eye. He was distinctly human in appearance, but Lily could see large wings laying limp behind him, shining copper in the fading light and completely invisible to the men he stood near.
Dean is currently being blindfolded by one of Cas’ ties, his wrists already tied to the headboard with two others. Before they’d started the show, they'd decided against a gag in case Dean needs to safe word. Cas had been alerted that “yellow” means “slow down or I’ll cum,” and “croissant” means he wants out of the bindings. Dean’s not sure where “croissant” came from, but it was the first thing out of his mouth, probably spurred on from some memory of wandering the bakery section of the grocery store. After Cas had stopped laughing, he refused to let Dean change it.
Dean gazed up as his angel in awe, the flickering a gentle reminder of the power contained within that glorious, earthly body. "Yours, Cas, I'm all yours," he said before kissing Cas again. As turned on and aching as he was, he could get lost in the angel's plush lips for hours and not complain one bit.
“Good, you’re back! Me and Cas did all the hard work, get your asses in here and trim the tree!” Dean called.
In the kitchen, no more than a dozen feet from where Dean still lay panting in his afterglow, his friend and perpetual roommate is nothing but a cacophony of bangs, clangs, and mediocre singing while washing the dishes. This is all his fault. When all else fails, blame Cas. That’s Dean’s motto, anyway.
“I’ve got this,” Cas says, shakily.
Cas unboxes the toy, turning it over in his hands and noting the curved tip designed to press into Dean’s prostate and torture him with delicious pleasure every time a viewer sends a tip.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says immediately, then his arms are full of overheated omega.
“Whatever you want, Cas,” he says and he kisses the alpha’s nose because he just can’t help himself.
again.
Cas sighed at the words and the feeling of Dean's warm breath ruffling his feathers. His head dropped back and he let out a tiny moan as Dean brushed both wings with his fingertips. It was so light he could barely feel it, but the touch still managed to leave shivers in its wake. Cas' whole body was trembling as Dean pressed a kiss to his spine, right in the spot between where the wings protruded from his body.
Sam clapped him on the shoulder, giving him a sympathetic look. “Hey, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be. A year is nothing. And it’s not really a year, more like ten months.”
sex, I’ve just never
The room was silent but for the sound of heavy breathing as they basked in the afterglow. Cas remained buried inside of Dean, leaning down to gather his body against his own. He peppered kisses along Dean's neck and jaw before pressing their lips together and kissing him deeply.
Cas nodded and frowned down at his plate. He had more questions, like why didn’t Dean avoid his room in the first place, for one. Why did he stay and watch until he got off? But that would just open the floor for Dean’s own questions, and Cas wasn’t sure he’d want to answer the ‘why didn’t I tell Dean I knew he was there?’ question.
Dean growled and dove in for a kiss, nipping at Cas’ bottom lip, taking advantage of Cas’ startled gasp to dip his tongue inside for a taste. The kiss heated fast as Cas threw himself into it, matching Dean in his intensity by sucking on the tip of his tongue and moaning into the kiss as his hands squeezed handfuls of Dean’s ass.
“So, they’re not white and fluffy?” Dean asked after he cleared his throat and shook the image of Cas' wings free from his vivid imagination.
The time did come though, and Cas had to head out. Dean took his hand in his own, pulling it to his lips and brushing a kiss over the promise ring that was shining silver, contrasting beautifully against Cas’ tanned skin. Dean had a pang of regret that he hadn’t put it on Cas’ wedding finger. What a claim that could have been, something to show the world that Cas was all his.
“Want you, Alpha.
“This,” he waves a hand around to indicate their surroundings, “is not ‘nothing,’ Cas. You gave me the entire universe.”
Dean. He’ll know that Dean watched him and got off to him, and how in the hell is Dean going to explain this one away?
Cas continued to sucke, swirling his tongue over the sensitive spot under the head before drawing away and looking up at Dean with big, concerned, blue eyes. “You’re not too sore from last night?” Cas asked, even as his fingers dipped between Dean’s legs to press against his hole.
Cas pulls one more thing out of the box, and Dean can’t help the laugh that bubbles forth. Bee socks. Fucking knee high, yellow, bee socks.
Turns out, Dean was feeling the same way, and he reached out to take Cas’ hand in his own. “Come for a walk on the beach with me?” he asked.
Dean searches the sky. He can find Orion easily enough by looking for the three stars that make up his belt, and he thinks he sees the star Cas is pointing at, though it’s brightness pales in comparison to Venus. “Yeah? I think so.”
"Goodnight then! Don't do anything I wouldn't do! Actually, I won’t touch a dick, so do everything I wouldn’t do!” she laughed with a wink and a wave before getting into her car.
“Go to sleep, Omega,” Cas snapped. It stung like a bitch that Cas was ordering him around and wouldn’t even use him name to do so, but Dean obeyed, closing his eyes and eventually falling into a fitful sleep.
“My beautiful omega,” Cas said, running a thumb over Dean’s lower lip before reaching down and pulling him into a kiss.
“I want you,” Dean whines. His hips lift off the mattress as he seeks contact with Cas.
“I wanna make you come,” Dean said, his voice pitched low and rough with arousal. “I wanna make you feel so good.”
It’s soft and deep and Dean sighs wistfully into it when it breaks.
Dean hurried to close his sketchpad before answering. “It’s just after eight.”
“Or in my bed where we can smell each other, and I can get a decent night’s sleep? Because I don’t know if I can stand having you close and not being next to you,” Cas offered, looking at Dean hopefully. “I’m sure two grown men can handle sleeping together without
“Doesn’t matter how much you’re willing to pay, double rooms are full,” the girl said smugly.
“I’ve been told I’m very blunt,” Castiel said with a shrug. “I just wanted to be completely transparent. That way if you’re ever skipping a class or coming back early, you can let me know and I can stop broadcasting.”
“I’m just teaching you the most popular drinks, and the specials. If you can’t handle it, how are you supposed to tend this bar?” Jo snapped impatiently.
"I see it all worked out then!" a female voice called, and they looked over to see the desk clerk locking up for the night.
“3000 more and I’ll come for you,” Dean all but
“Maybe you’ll find out in a few minutes. Maybe I’ll wait until next time. I haven’t decided yet,” Cas says, cheeks pink enough to show through his tan.
Suddenly, Cas trembled and let out another loud moan as he emptied himself deep inside of Dean. They clutched each other tightly as the angel rode out wave after wave of pleasure, his entire body shaking from the intensity of it.
Castiel nodded, and Dean just assumed that Cas knew what he was asking for. He reached over to his nightstand, blindly groping for the handle and pulling the drawer open. Twisting awkwardly with six solid feet of celestial being trapping him against the mattress, he finally managed to wrap his hand around the much coveted bottle, then thrust it into Castiel’s waiting hand.
“I should, but…” Dean threads his fingers into Cas’ hair, tugging gently to coax him closer to his cock. “No. Please don’t stop.”
“I can ask him to leave if he’s making you uncomfortable,” Cas offered. “Perks of being the boss.”
They lay there in the afterglow little longer until the mess between them starts to get tacky, then Cas peels himself off of Dean and goes to the bathroom for a warm washcloth.
“Mmm, could have fooled me,” Dean teased, his fingers slipping free as Cas huffed in annoyance at the loss. Cas scowled down at him, then Dean’s world was upended as he was forcibly rolled onto his back and covered with six feet of aroused art student. Cas pushed his way between Dean’s legs, dropping down and grinding hard.
"I love you," Castiel murmured against Dean's ear, reveling in the full body shudder his warm breath shook out of Dean. When Castiel's thrusts became too fast and too hard, Dean collapsed forward onto all fours, and Cas didn't lose a step, grasping onto his hips for leverage and pounding into him.
“So much it ached every time I looked at him.”
I sit up with the radio
Dean chuckled and pushed off the doorframe to walk into the office and pull Cas into his arms. He leaned in to scent under Cas’ ear, smiling against Cas’ skin when his head dropped back and a tiny sound of pleasure snuck out from between those plink, plush lips Dean loved so much.
Cas looked at him tentatively. “I’ve never been on a real date,” he said simply. “I know we’ve gone for walks and we had the beach day, but other than that, I’ve been stuck here or within a few block radius for weeks. All we do is work, and I want to go out.”
“Fucking hell,” Dean cursed, reaching out to palm Castiel’s ass in both hands. He bent and left a sucking kiss on one cheek, snaking a hand between Cas’ legs and wrapping it around Cas' cock, stroking him slow in a loose fist. “Keep fucking yourself baby,” he urged, and Cas whimpered as his hips started to rock so he could thrust into the tunnel of Dean’s fist. “That’s it, Angel. Make yourself feel good.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says as Dean pulls into the driveway after a tense, and silent, ride home. He feels miserable for snapping at Dean after the ordeal he’d just gone through at the farmer’s market. It isn’t Dean’s fault that Cas has been burying his feelings and Cas was nothing more than a hot-headed, insensitive alpha. He continues, “I was frustrated about that other alpha and I took it out on you. I’ll always protect you regardless of who your alpha ends up being. You’re my best friend.”
“You’re nesting, Omega,” Cas said, simply. It wasn’t a question, more along the lines of an accusation than anything.
“Omega,” Cas purred, then Dean’s legs were shoved apart and Cas was  between his legs licking over his hole, a low growl rumbling in his chest, possessively.
“Dean,” Sam’s voice called out and Dean look over to see his brother’s head where it had popped up in the doorway. “Phone.”
Tips start rolling in as Dean lets his hands wander over his torso, stopping to pinch a nipple here and run a palm over his cock there. He’s beautiful, all toned, freckled skin and long limbs, and he lets his legs fall open to reveal the slightest glint of slick at his hole. Cas knows in this moment he has no prayer of getting through this without getting off.
Dean nods furiously, shimmying further down Cas’ body without a second thought. He leaves a trail of slick on Cas from chest to groin, but Cas doesn't care. He’d bathe in Dean’s slick happily for the chance to see him like this, standing on his knees, back bowed gracefully as he reaches behind himself to guide Cas’s cock into his warm, wet, waiting hole.
He thrusts a few more times, and Dean reaches between his own legs to stroke himself. At some point, he’d gotten hard again, and fuck… they really did have chemistry.
Sorry I got so lazy and scatterbrained that I never sat down to edit this final chapter until now. But it's here! Finally!
Dean’s eyes dilate, his scent sweetening and mixing with the cinnamon Cas pumps out like crazy when they’re together. “How do you want to do this, Alpha?”
“Cas,” Dean whispered in wonder, his breath ghosting over Castiel’s lips and making his body shiver with anticipation. “I
Cas moved between Dean's legs, hooking his hands behind the man's knees and pushing them toward his chest. He laid between them, and parted the man's cheeks before leaning in and giving an experimental lick to his entrance. Dean threw his head back and gasped in surprise and awe. Where had the angel learned that?
Cas’ eyes opened and he looked over at Dean with that bright smile Dean couldn’t get enough of, all straight, white teeth, scrunched up nose and eye crinkles. “And I love you,” Cas said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, and Dean supposed it was. They certainly said it often enough, much to Dean’s surprise. He’d never been so open and free with those three little words, and now he found himself saying them a few times a day because they were more true than ever before and he couldn’t hold them in around Cas if he tried.
“Awesome.” Dean grins and digs into his dinner, nudging Cas’ elbow again to get him to do the same.
As he was mixing a martini Al, his regular, spoke up again, “Come on, Dean-O. You’ll never make the kind of money you made with that sweet ass of yours by slinging drinks. What do you say we get a room and you let me fill you up the way you always beg me to?”
What did Dean buy? Just the thought of watching Dean writhe on a plug or fuck himself with a fake knot has Cas hard and leaking in his pants, his arousal blooming around him, spicy with cinnamon.
“I’m just not a beach rookie. These people come down here and half ass their umbrella and put others in danger,” Cas answered with another shrug before grabbing the hem of his tank top and pulling it over his head.
Cas scrunched up his face as he mentally pictured the window that sat above the right turn partway up the staircase. It was a gorgeous piece, a lighthouse perched overlooking the sea, with soft white clouds floating in a sunset sky. If he remembered correctly, there were a few birds in the sky, and some greenery along the banks.
“I’m coming,” Cas warned, then his eyes scrunched shut highly and his mouth dropped open as his orgasm washed over him. He came hard, his release forceful enough to hit his chin and cover Dean’s hand and the majority of both of their torsos.
Dean’s eyes go wider than Cas has ever seen them. “Cas… I’ve been with a lot of people over the years. Alphas, betas, other omegas…
“I would pay you rent,” Dean said firmly.
When Castiel joined him on the porch, Dean nearly swallowed his tongue. Cas wasn’t wearing a speedo by any means, but the shorts he has chosen left not much more to the imagination than one would have. Dean wasn’t stupid. He’d felt the size of Cas’ hard cock pressed against his hip on occasion and knew he wasn’t lacking in that department, but the bulge visible in his tiny shorts even while flaccid left Dean staring inappropriately.
is making me sick.”
Dean waved a hand toward the tent frantically. "Lube, Cas. I want you to fuck me." He was already hard and aching. After teasing each other all day, it didn't take much to get him to that point.
“Hmm?”
“Please, Cas? We can just skip the show tonight,” it comes out close to a whine, and Cas already knows he’s going to give in. The hormones are making Dean needy to the point of almost begging for sex, and how is Cas supposed to resist? There is very little he’d deny Dean.
“Fuck me until you’re close then cum all over me,” Dean says, and Cas’ cock jumps at his words.
June was waning with a heat wave that left the air oppressive and muggy when Dean stopped Castiel at the door to the garage one morning in nothing but swim trunks and a tank top that showed off very toned arms.
"I love you, Dean," he whispered against Dean's ear as a few more tears splashed down on the man. He started to move, his hips setting a maddeningly slow rhythm as Dean held him tightly in his arms.
Maybe it’s just because his feelings for Cas have gotten out of hand and Dean just wants him to himself now. Which is crazy and unrealistic, so he supposes he has to learn to live with scripted sex and unwelcome pauses to make sure they’re being paid accordingly.
Dean stares down at the final four suppressants rattling around in the bottle with disdain. Four more days left-three after he actually takes one of the pills- but what’s the point? Before he can even think about stopping himself, he’s tipping the bottle over the toilet bowel and the pills drop into the water with four tiny splashes. He flushes and watches as the pills circle the bowl then disappear down to the sewer below. Perhaps it was a hasty decision, but Dean is at peace with it. The sooner his heat comes, the sooner he can be past it. No more delaying the inevitable.
As much as Dean loved the angel manhandling and taking him, there was something so heartbreakingly beautiful about the way Cas was willing to give himself over to him completely. This creature, this warrior of God who could kill with the simple act of a well placed palm, could submit fully to Dean, and only to Dean. This angel who had him begging only a half hour before, was now begging him, and Dean wanted to give him everything he asked for.
Cas growled, snapping his hips into Dean roughly, chasing his own release. His thrusts sped again, and Dean found himself becoming aroused enough to enjoy it, even though he knew it was too soon to come again so soon.
Dean liked the sound of that in spite of the fact that it was all for show. It wasn’t that Dean had forgotten that they had an audience, he just didn’t care. He wanted Cas now because he’d wanted Cas since the moment he saw him. The viewers were ancillary, simply the spark that lit this fuse between them. He really didn't give a shit about their tips or their polls as long as Cas got inside him as soon as humanly possible.
Dean wrinkles his nose at the blankets and scowls at Cas. “You washed it?” Cas nods and Dean’s scowl deepens. “All of it?”
“I’m still jealous you got to do an
“He was handsome,” Mia said, handing the phone back. If she was surprised that Cas had been an angel, it didn’t show.
to be good. The word “croissant” will never leave his lips, even if he has to stay tied to this bed all night.
Dean's hands came back simply dripping in all that glorious Cas-scented oil, and with a gleam in his eye and a dirty little wink, he sat back against the headboard, legs parted obscenely. Cas' breathing hitched as he watched as Dean slicked his own cock up with the oil and began to stroke himself. The man looked cocky and beautiful, one eyebrow arched, bottom lip drawn between his teeth as his hand moved slowly. Cas was riveted by his predatory glare.
“Yeah,” Dean said, bumping lightly into Cas and shuffling to a stop. “Sounds about right. I was so nervous.”
for some reason. Black would fit Cas. Then a flash of serious blue eyes the shade of brushed denim came to mind and Dean blurted out “Black and Blue.”
most intricate piece to date. There were layers of oranges and reds, the blue of the ocean, and all needed to be cut precisely to get the design to fit together just right. He’d gotten all the glass cut, the edges smoothed and had begun soldering the pieces together, smiling as he watched the design come to life. He was eager to finish it and hold it up to the sunlight, the illumination of the bright colors the only real reward he received at the end of every project.
PS: Sorry this chapter is a little on the short side. The next one is actually a bit more than twice this long.
“Your office, now,” Ellen answered. “We cleaned out Gabe’s personal effects and put them in storage up in the attic. It’s yours to do with what you wish, if you even choose to come in. Gabe only came in once a week or so to look over books and hand out paychecks, but honestly, I’d appreciate a more hands-on approach if you can stomach the smells. We do have air neutralizers installed in the lounge and hallways, but they really only take it all down a few notches since the staff doesn't wear blockers. I’d understand if it’s too overwhelming for you.”
Happy Friday!
“It’s a damn shame, man,” a handsome, light-skinned black man said with a wink as he sipped his drink and looked Dean up and down over the bar. “I mean, I get it. If I were able to tie you down, I wouldn’t want to share either, but it’s a damn shame.”
The shower curtain slides open and Cas is standing there on the other side of the tub, looking shy.
“Hey sweetie,” the busty bartender cooed at Cas as he sidled up to the bar. “You’re much prettier than most of the guys we get in here.”
But there were those other little memories. The ones even Sam never really knew about. The time he made Cas the mixtape the day after Cas had said “I love you,” on his deathbed. It had been followed up with, “I love all of you,” but Dean knew that first one belonged to him alone and he’d packaged it up and stored it away in the deepest recess of his heart, a little private place he reserved for the very few things he refused to share.
“It’s not nothing, Dean. I can’t even draw a stick figure, and this looks exactly like me.” Cas said, voice full of awe. “You’re very talented. Have you ever thought about being an artist when you graduate? There are very good art schools as close as Philadelphia and New York. You wouldn’t have to go far. With your talent, you could get in anywhere.”
Dean parked in Castiel’s driveway, then rooted around in the trunk for a plaid blanket they could sit on should they decide to stop and stargaze. He rejoined Castiel where he waited on the sidewalk then they walked the sandy path through the dunes, only the light of the moon to light their way through the thick, tall grasses to the beach that sat beyond.
“This is too much, Cas.”
“Found it,” Dean said with a cocky smirk before thrusting his fingers into Cas again, sure to hit the same spot.
"Did you just call her sweetheart?" He gripped both of Dean's wrists in his hands, slamming them against the car door as the length of his body pressed against the startled man. "You. Are. Mine!”
“What if you had your sword?”
Dean grinned back at him, then grabbed his hand, dragging him though the dining room and living room, pointing out a wood-burning fireplace before insisting they go upstairs.
When morning came, Dean scowled at Castiel’s sleeping form where it laid, silhouetted in the sunlight that streamed through the sliding glass door. If he were any further from Dean, he’d be on the floor. He resisted the urge to curl up against Cas’ back and breathe in his spicy scent. The only thing that was likely to get him was another rough fuck and a few grumbled orders. And though arousal thrummed under his skin, his heat still at its peak, he couldn’t bear to wake Cas and see the way he looked at him. He couldn’t bear to be flipped over on his stomach and taken fast and hard without an ounce of emotion.
Like a couple.
"Hey," Dean whispered, brushing the trail of the tear away from Cas' cheek. Cas' eyes were locked on his as Dean swiped up the tear where it had fallen on his own face and licked it from his fingertips. "It's ok, Cas. Me too.”
“Good boy,” Cas says, rewarding Dean with a kiss. “Thank you for asking for what you want. Such a good omega. So polite.” Cas pushes his legs further apart and kneels between them. He kisses a path up Dean’s thigh, nosing along the crease between his thigh and groin and breathing hot air over his cock.
Title inspired by this Garth Brooks song.
"You already do," Cas whispered, reading him in that way of his. "I can feel it, Dean. Your love. It burns as bright as your soul." The angel had sped his movements now, pleasure building, tipping toward that breaking point of climax.
“Look at you,” Cas murmurs, even though there’s no way for Dean to see a shittin’ thing. “So hard, so red, so wet… is that all for me?”
“I want to have penetrative intercourse with you, Dean,” Cas said, almost shyly, his kisses stopping.
“I told you I pretty much grew up down here,” Cas says with a shrug. He gave the pole a little wiggle to test it, then plopped into an empty chair, satisfied the umbrella wouldn’t be going anywhere. “ I can’t even tell you how many beach umbrellas I’ve witnessed blowing down the beach with someone chasing after it. Poor planning, really. I don’t even feel bad for them.”
“It’s a gift,” Dean said, eyes still averted, though he ached to look at Cas so much. “You keep those.”
It was only a year later that Gabriel had gone forever. He’d left the church, fed up with their policies and unwillingness to accept LGBT members and announced his plans for the business he wanted to open. The fight with his parents had spilled onto the front porch and been loud enough to get neighbors to call the cops. It ended when Gabriel went back into the house and shoved as many of his belongings as could into a single backpack and walked out the door forever, middle finger thrust high in the air. Cas ran after him, begging him not to leave him alone with their intolerant family.
...Eventually.
Dean scoffed. “Just stop with the analysis and I’ll tell you, Doc,” he said as he sank back into his seat and allowed himself to have this.
“Please,” Dean whines, his empty hole clenching and unclenching with the loss of Cas’ cock. “Knot me, Alpha. Breed me.
He stripped down to his boxer briefs and slid under the covers. Everything around him was falling part, including the carefully constructed walls he’d built around his heart over the years. He didn’t even have the energy to hate Jack anymore, going out of his way to tell the kid he did good saving them from the evil shapeshifter they’d encountered in Madison. He’d broken down and actually talked about his feelings for once, telling Sam his faith was gone.
and when Cas’ expression didn’t change in the slightest, Sam said,
Dean foolishly turned his back on Cas, smirking at the girl over the hood of the Impala. "When you're right you're right, sweetheart," he called over to her with a smug smile.
Dean’s thigh muscles tensed under Cas’ fingertips and within seconds, he was spilling over his stomach and chest forcefully.
Gabriel had only been buried a day. Castiel’s beta brother had been at work when he’d gotten in the middle of an argument between two territorial alphas. He died when he was shoved aside, falling fast and hitting his head on the edge of the bar. It was a freak accident, something that wouldn’t have killed him had it not struck just hard enough in just the wrong spot, but it had and now Castiel was feeling a great loss for the second time in his 38 years.
Cas tilted his chin down almost with a bashful smile and took a shirt out of the dresser. “I forgot to take a shirt in with me.” He pulled the plain black tee shirt over his head then slid under the covers to lounge with Dean. “How are you feeling? I know last night was difficult for you.”
"Fuck, Cas, you feel so good," Dean ran his hand over the angel's body, lingering over his meaty thighs before running over his sharp hipbones and grasping them firmly. He thrust his hips upward and Cas moaned before raising his hips and dropping back down again.
The lawyer sat at his desk, spreading a small stack of papers in front of him, shuffling through them before nodding, stacking them and banging the edges on the desk to straighten the pile neatly. Finally, he raised his head and looked Castiel in the eyes. “First off, I’m very sorry for your loss.”
Cas nodded. “Ok.”
"Angels don't sleep," Dean said, a hint of mischief lacing his raspy morning voice.
“I’d like a boyfriend who doesn't run off without telling me where he’s going,” Dean said, closing the door and pushing Cas up against it angrily. “Damn it Cas, I was sick with worry, you stupid angel!”
“You got me. I’m using you for this big, soft bed,” Cas deadpanned, sitting on the edge of the mattress and reclining back to lean on his elbows, invitingly.
“He left, couple minutes ago.” the blonde bartender called as she watched Dean scour the small bar, a look of concern on his face. She laughed as she watched a mix of relief and annoyance wash over Dean’s features.
“Hey. We should probably hit it,” Dean replied, setting breakfast down on the table and taking a seat across from his brother.
that's when (s)he's more than a memory
“Hey,” he says, dropping down to the blanket Cas has spread out in the back yard. He yawns against the back of his hand and settles back next to Cas where he lays, looking up at the night sky.
He had the passing thought that the omega at the brothel could possibly be Dean. The scent was so similar to the omega he once knew so intimately, down to the Granny Smith apples. He’d smelled others over the years whose scent was similar, but it was the sweeter Honeycrisp apple, or the generic scent of a Macintosh. This was the first time in twenty years he smelled the tart sweetness of a bright green Granny Smith, and it would be a hell of a coincidence, but anything was possible, he supposed. What would he do? Dean had betrayed him, lied and left him… and yet… he was
He was so wrapped up in watching his boyfriend he never noticed how closely one of the lifeguards had also been watching until his smug, red-shorts-clad-ass was wading over to Cas and striking up a conversation. He watched as Cas’ smile fell and he started shaking his head no. The lifeguard didn’t let up, reaching out to gently touch Cas’ arm as he continued to talk. Cas took a step back in the water, losing his footing when a wave crashed into him, catching him off guard, and the lifeguard reached out with both hands, grasping Cas by the biceps to steady him.
“Knot me, please knot me, Cas” Dean begged.
Dean scowled at him before tossing the pad into his lap. “Fine. But just know that you’re not playing fair.”
“Meg, I’m here with you,” Cas said, pulling her close again reluctantly.
In the years following graduation, Cas got a taste for ink, and currently on display is the full galaxy/honeycomb hybrid sleeve on his right arm and the flowers that creep from low on his hip, over his ribs only to then wrap around his back and up over his shoulder on his left side. Cam money means Cas can afford the best artist in Kansas City, and the crisp lines and saturated colors look fantastic on his tan, tight skin. He once asked Cas if he would be covered in ink someday, but Cas assured him he only put things on his body that mean something to him. What a bunch of flowers mean, Dean has no idea, but they sure do look good softening the hard lines of Cas’ body.
Castiel hadn’t even denied it. He’d just shrugged and gave his best impression of a sad puppy before saying, “Don’t tell anyone?”
“You wanna come like this?” Dean asked, pulling off and giving his own cock a couple firm strokes to ease his own arousal.
“The alpha supply closet. As you can see, we stock a large assortment of condoms and toys. Plenty of extra sheets and towels, emergency contraception in case a condom breaks. Neutralizer replacement cartridges. Pretty much everything we need. The omega side closet is identical.” Ellen stated as she closed the door. “The other side could be easier or more difficult to tour, depending on what kind of alpha you are.”
“Yeah, ‘course,” Dean said, standing from the bed to grab his blockers off of his own nightstand. He spritzed them on thickly, drowning out his scent before it soured and alerted Cas to the rejection he was feeling. No, Cas was right. They couldn’t risk it.
Castiel is feeling refreshed from his dip in the pool, freshly coated with sunscreen and laying back in his chair when he notices Jack sitting at their little outdoor kitchen bar, smiling deviously at his phone.
“No. I have to… I just need…” Dean trailed off, wiping a hand over his face. “I…”
He’s adjusting the webcam when Dean raps softly on the door.
“Fuck,” Dean groaned dramatically as he realized Christmas was only a few days away and he’d yet to buy a single present. “Hey Cas, what do you want for Christmas, buddy?”
Cas laid his body over Dean's, gathering the man up in his arms and holding him tight as he slowly began to rock into him again.
“No.” Dean said firmly. “No way. You’re not paying for this, Cas. I’m not a kept man.”
Cas’ eyes went wide and he reached into the drawer again, pulling out a slightly slimmer dildo and holding it up next to the first. “Dean,” he breathed, his voice lowered about 3 octaves from normal. He wrapped one hand around them both, assessing the girth and looking at the place between the tips of his middle finger and the tip of his thumb to see they couldn’t quite touch.
Shit, shit, shit. He actually hit send. Fuck. Why did he do that? Jack is playing matchmaker and he’s probably running off to tell Cas all about it right now. For the second time that day, Dean is mortified. He drops the phone on the kitchen counter and makes his escape to the bathroom to hopefully drown himself in a cold shower.
To get through one night a day
as he relaxed into the sensations.
“Fuck, Cas… gonna…” Dean choked out before he was coming untouched, spilling between them and covering Cas’ torso in white.
“I, uh… I remember saying something about not letting you die a virgin.”
Dean pulled Cas against himself, slotting a knee between Cas' thighs so they had something press against as Dean kissed him again with more urgency. His mind was completely clouded now, Mia wasn’t here anymore. Everything was Cas… Cas…Cas.  He ground his hips against Cas’ thigh and the angel gasped, pressing back in kind so Dean could feel the hard press of his own arousal.
He’s struck again by how domestic their lives have become in quarantine, how easily they move around each other and divide up the chores with little to no bickering. Their lives are easy and so close to perfect that Cas thinks he could live just like this forever and be happy.
“So where are we off to so spontaneously?” Cas asked, fiddling with the radio until Dean swatted his hand away and pushed a cassette into the tape deck.
Dean coughs up the crumbs and sets the rest of the tart aside as he scrolls though the photos, jaw dangling comically as he takes in all the
Cas retrieved the little bottle sitting on the mattress and slicked up his entrance as Dean kissed him stupid. He gasped as he pushed two fingers inside himself and started working his entrance open. Dean's lips trailed over Cas' jawline before he nipped at his ear, drawing a tiny moan from deep in the angel's throat.
Castiel turned to Dean and took a step closer. “You’re still making it exceptionally difficult to stick to the no kissing rule,” he said with a smirk.
“Where’s Jack?” Dean asked.
Castiel reaches across the narrow space between their chairs, palm facing the sky in invitation, and Dean just smiles over at him and takes it, lacing their fingers together and squeezing tight. He studies the way the sun seems to make Cas glow ethereally in a way that will never let Dean forget Cas was once a celestial being. For a fleeting second he thinks,
"What Cas? Tell me what you need.”
Fluffy, fluffy, fluffy...
… for Cas back was proof. It was over. It was all over.
Dean tipped Cas’ chin up gently and placed a soft kiss on his lips. “You’re the man I love. You’re kind, and talented and so fucking sexy I can barely stand it, and you don’t even know it. You’re so humble that you don’t even notice the eyes that follow you when we’re out, undressing you as if you’re not already mine,” He kissed the unbelieving, wide-eyed look off Castiel’s face before continuing. “I want forever with you, Cas, and I’ll prove that to you while you finish up school. I’ll be right here anytime you want to come down and I’ll be right here after you graduate, and I’ll be right here as you find your way in life and figure out what it is you want to do. I am so, devastatingly in love with you, Angel.”
As soon as the door slammed shut behind them, Castiel had Dean pressed against it and their mouths were on each other for the first time in twenty years. Dean kissed him like he was dying and Cas was the air he needed to breathe. In the back of his barely functioning mind, Castiel ran over everything that Ellen had told him during the brothel tour. According to her, Dean was tested, clean and on birth control, and he knew for a fact he was clean himself.
For the next week, Castiel locked himself away in the garage during the evenings, much to Dean’s chagrin. Dean hated that Cas was working on a secret project and wouldn’t let him see it, but he supposed turnabout was fair play considering he refused to share the window until after it was finished
“You’re here for sex? It’s 2 o’clock in the afternoon, Dean. We’re working,” Cas rolled his eyes in protest, but still leaned into the open mouthed kiss Dean pressed to his lips.
It was the middle of the afternoon on a Monday, and the lobby was empty, giving Castiel a good look at his surroundings without the distraction of other people and the smells they brought. A large bar sat against the back wall, elegant barstools in deep red vinyl and dark wood were arranged in front of the bar in a neat line. The mirrored wall behind the bar held shelf upon shelf of liquors, wine lists sat on the bar top, and a row of taps boasted an extensive beer selection. There were no tacky neon signs advertising beer brands, no TVs playing sports, and Castiel couldn’t help but think that for a bar in a brothel, it was actually pretty classy.
Cas growls again, straightening again to fuck Dean harder, faster. His hands grasp Dean’s hips and pull him back against his own, and Dean is reeling with pleasure. He can feel his orgasm creeping up, threatening to spill over untouched, and he aches for release. Cas tilts his hips up just a fraction and he’s nailing Dean’s prostate.
“It was awesome,” Dean argues with a laugh of his own. “Been a while since I got to do that without someone watching. Can’t even feel guilty about giving into the hormones when your cock is inside me, man.”
“Fuck,” he muttered, as he wondered why he’d agreed to take on a massive church window just as the summer was about to begin. The Inn was booked solid for the entire summer, and though Sam could easily handle his duties, Dean’s would be a struggle. Already, he knew the gutters needed cleaning, the grass was getting a little long, and the back garden had yet to be weeded. He’d wanted to build a pergola and install a porch swing at some point before Memorial Day too, so the guests would have a couple nice outdoor spaces to use, but he hadn’t even gotten around to buying lumber for the pergola yet. “Fuck,” he said again, pushing his hand through his hair in frustration.
“A date, my dear Charles?” Dean teased. “Looks like we have even more to talk about when I stop in.”
Cas’ eyes flicked from Dean’s eyes to his lips before he shook his head and laid back on the blanket with a frustrated sigh. “Whatever. You couldn’t keep your eyes off of me either if I’m remembering it correctly.”
“Well, if you look like that from running, you must be doing something right,” Dean said, averting his eyes and mentally kicking himself for having absolutely no verbal filter. He reminded himself that he should not be coming on to Cas right now. “Here, let me see,” he said, holding his own hand out, palm up to get back on track.
Could this finally get him out of the friend zone? It was a chance he was willing to take once Cas looked over at him with blown pupils and skin flushed rosy-pink from his cheeks all the way down his neck. Pulling his shirt over his head, Dean began to move, making his way across the small room in a few short strides.
“I thought we could use some fresh air while you’re feeling ok,” Cas says, before seeming to realize he’d potentially made another mistake and blurting, “Not that I need fresh air… I like how you smell when you’re in heat… and I love our nest, I just…”
” slipped out. Cas’ smile tripled in kind as Dean stepped closer and laced their fingers together. “So, can I give you my gift now? Because I’m kind of dying over here.”
“I love you Dean,” Cas said softly, not missing the way his words made tears well up in Dean’s eyes as he averted his gaze to blink them away.
Beneath him, Dean was moaning and rocking his hips to meet every thrust. The sounds of skin on skin and the noises their lovemaking punched from their chests echoed out across the lake, and Cas found himself grateful that it was far too early in the season to have much company out in the woods.
“Everything you promised me, Dean, I promise the same,” Cas said, as if he could read Dean’s thoughts. “You’re it for me too.”
The next morning, Dean handed him the tape. He must have stayed up all night picking out the perfect songs and recording them for him. When Dean gave it to him, Cas could feel the adoration and longing rolling off of the man just as clearly as he could see the red blush that spread across his cheeks masking his adorable freckles. Cas wondered what would have happened if he’d made a move that day, if he’d just closed the distance between them and kissed Dean.
"God Cas," he groaned, thrusting his hips forward into Cas' grasp. "How are we ever supposed to get any work done again? I can't keep my fucking hands off of you.”
For that moment though, their most pressing issue was the sticky mess they made of each other.
The girl rolled her eyes, cracked her gum, and handed Dean the room key. “Room 239. And I like pussy. If you’re that hard up, there’s a bar up the road. Though, from the daggers your friend here has been shooting me with his eyes, you might not have to look so far. Taste the rainbow.” She winked at Dean as he blinked at her in surprise, his mouth opening and closing like a guppy as he tried to think of some snappy retort that would never come.
“Got yourself a girlfriend, son?” he teases, and Jack’s head snaps up and he blushes.
He knew Dean would hate it. He was fairly certain Dean would be angry with him, maybe even angry enough to be unable forgive him for what he would clearly see as betrayal. But he wanted to protect Dean now more than ever, and by extension, Sam too. He would do anything to keep the Winchesters away from the whole mess. Nephilim were angel business, plain and simple. And he needed to fix this. He’d done nothing but make a mess out of everything he touched and he needed to prove to Dean that he could do this. Besides, he would come back… hopefully.
“Please, Cas… mate me, sweetheart. Please. I’m yours, only yours,” Dean begs, and Cas is itching to do it, to place his teeth against Dean’s scent gland and bite until blood spills into their nest. But he can’t. The damage that could do is irreparable.
"You're so fucking beautiful. I want to worship you, Cas. I want to taste every inch of your body," Dean murmured before leaning in and sucking a nipple between his lips. Cas gasped at the contact and let his fingers bury themselves in the short strands of Dean's hair. Dean's hands ran over Cas' back, lingering over the taut muscles in his shoulders before grasping them and pulling the angel flush against himself. The light flickered again as their bare skin touched, and Cas' eyes glowed dimly as he let out an absolutely filthy moan.
If Mrs. Butters taught Dean one thing in her short time with them in the bunker, it was to appreciate the little things in life. Things like eating a home cooked meal, celebrating the holidays or just telling the ones you love that you do, in fact, love them.
“It was a pretty good day,” Cas says with a brilliant smile on his face that reaches his eyes, and Dean can see he truly enjoys his job. He’d kind of worried Cas would have the same dead look in his eyes that the pathetic, tip hungry couple had, but Dean’s relieved to see he doesn’t. Far from it, even.  “I did some yoga this morning and worked in the garden. Then I went for a run this afternoon, took a nice, long shower and when I got done my roommate surprised me with dinner. Now I’m here with my friends, living the good life.”
“Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave my stall,” Jody says to the unfamiliar alpha.
“I didn’t do much better.”
Cas shook his head sadly, looking back at the sky to avoid Dean’s gaze. “Sometimes… I just wish…” He sighed, a broken, shaky breath dragging in and back out of his lungs slowly. “I wish you would look at me the way you look at those girls in there. Perhaps I need a female vessel.”
“Cas,” the man breathed against his neck. “Need you Cas. Need you to knot me, Angel.”
Dean sighs, and chugs some of the water while glaring at Cas’ door. He could let himself in, beg forgiveness, and tell Cas the truth. The
Not all chapters will be this short, but I have certain chunks of story I want to tell and definite stopping and starting points for them, so try not to go batty when one chapter is 2300 words and another is 8000, LOL.
Dean dressed and went downstairs where he found Cas in the kitchen, digging through the pantry and grumbling at the contents. “I can cook,” he offered, cautiously.
his heat… a heat that
Sorry I'm late! The first couple chapters were between 1800ish and 2300ish words, and this one, well, got away from me as the smut tends to do. It’s longer than the first two combined. By a lot. Oops? Then of course, because life happens, my wi-fi kept crapping out. So… Merry day after the day after Christmas!
“Maybe,” Cas said bashfully, a slight blush creeping across his cheeks as he averted his eyes.
Dean is still whimpering and circling his hips in Cas’ lap as Cas rides out his orgasm, then they’re collapsing together on their sides to wait out Cas’ knot.
'Yes, you do like this," Cas growled, crooking his fingers just right, pressing against Dean's prostate and drawing a loud moan from his debauched lover. "I'm not going to let you come, Dean. How do you feel about that?" Cas teased, slipping a third finger along side the others and spreading them wide to stretch Dean enough to accept his throbbing cock.
“You know you don’t pay here, boy,” she says, sensing that the previous topic is now closed for discussion.
“I just want to go home,” Dean said, pushing himself up from the chair.
One of the reasons he loved fall was because he loved Halloween. He supposed he was a big gay cliché in that regard, but he loved the magic and the make believe that surrounded the holiday. He loved handing out candy to the costumed rugrats that knocked on the door and he loved how hot Dean looked every year when he dressed up as Han Solo and drug him around to every costume contest in every bar along the shore. He especially loved the celebration sex that came anytime Dean managed a win.
“It didn’t appear so when that man had you pinned,” Cas growls.
“Shh, I know. I’m sorry.” Cas kissed him. “I just worry about my lack of usefulness. What good am I to you and Sam as a human?”
“I was in the shower,” Dean answers, noticing the way Cas gives him a quick up and down glance before nibbling at his bottom lip. Oh God, is Cas picturing him naked? Could he be that lucky?
“Hey Sleeping Beauty,” Dean laughs.
“Do you trust me, Angel?” he asked, and Cas nodded immediately.
Timeframe: The space between 13x01 and 13x02
Dean slipped from the bed and into the hall bathroom where he could relieve himself and jerk off quickly to ease the arousal that was burning through him without Cas overhearing him. He wasn’t ready to wake Castiel just yet, so the en suite was off limits. He stroked himself to a quick, unsatisfying release, then found a washcloth to wipe up the cum and slick from his skin. He found a spare toothbrush, still packaged, in one of the drawers and sent a little thank you up to Gabriel for keeping his home guest-ready at all times, and brushed his teeth.
Probably the last update for a week or so. Sorry to leave you in a semi-cliff hanger place.
Cas sighs and smiles at him. “I’m so glad you said it.”
"We don't have any…”
“625 more, sweetheart. Soon,” Cas soothes, then dips his head to rim Dean while they wait. Dean moans and pushes his hips back against Cas’ face, desperate for more, so Cas slips two fingers inside and presses on Dean’s prostate while he licks his rim.
Dean smirked and averted his eyes. “Only ’til you got there.” He shrugged and took Cas’ hand in his, making eye contact with Cas to make sure he understood how serious he was. “She was a silly childhood crush, an unattainable fantasy like Gunnar Lawless or Dr. Sexy. Besides, her curves are much less impressive when you’re starkly reminded that she’s 2-D.”
“I promise. I can wash the bedding a little at a time next time. I’ll make sure something with our scents on it is always in the nest,” Cas says. “If that’s not good enough, we can leave it all. Whatever makes you happy. Just come out. Please.”
Cas raised an eyebrow in challenge and stuck out one leg, indicating that Dean should be the one to pin the badge to his shorts.
Soaping up his hand, he reached for his cock, stroking himself slowly as he pictured green eyes, freckles and the cockiest smirk he’d ever seen grace the face of an omega. He wondered what Dean looked like now and if his scent matured to be anything like the sweet smelling omega that worked for Castiel. He thrust into the tight tunnel of his fist, his hips rocking as he conjured the familiar fantasy world he always relied on in times like this. He tried to remember what it felt like to have Dean’s plush lips wrapped around his cock as they stargazed on the beach late at night, the sound waves crashing against the shore just loud enough to to drown out his soft moans. His treacherous brain provided him with memories of being buried in Dean in the back of the Impala, windows open, their moans and the classic rock Dean was so fond of drifting out into the open field they’d parked in one night. He could still feel the way Dean would clench around him when he came, could still see the way his head would tip back as he cried out in ecstasy and how they’d kiss soft and sweet until they could safely separate.
A shopping trip.
“Oh. Okay. Well, please, tell me, what’s going on here?” Dean asked, unable to keep anger from creeping into his tone.
Cas snaps Dean out of his thoughts as he suddenly picks him up and carries him clear across the house to the couch, still buried inside of him.
He carried his boxes upstairs, pushing the door to his old room open and seeing that unlike the rest of the home, his room had been left untouched. The same art adorned the walls and the same quilt sat on the neatly made bed. His books lined the bookcase and he still has some clothes hanging  in the closet. So many of his things had been left behind when he hastily took his job in New York City, and seeing them brought him back to another time.
“I called, Castiel. A few times. You really should have picked up so I could expl…”
His hips stilled as he started to float back to his body and Dean pulled him into a kiss before gathering him up in his arms, the mess between them forgotten. Their breathing slowly returned to normal and Cas rolled onto his back, pulling Dean along to straddle him and lay his head on his chest as they waited for Cas’ knot to go down.
I'm sorry about the cliffy! See you in a week!
In the bedroom, his cell phone was ringing again, and he ignored it, opting to go to the kitchen to see if there was any food in the house instead. He put a kettle on for tea and found some shortbread cookies in the pantry, and was just pouring the hot water over the teabag when he heard tires crunching over the gravel in his driveway. Peeking out the window, he saw Ellen standing at the open backdoor of her car, talking to an unseen passenger.
with him. His hormones are going haywire, desperate to be with his alpha. Problem is Cas doesn’t belong to him, but you try explaining fuck buddies to needy omega hormones. They don’t listen. Instead they just make him stink with sadness and rejection even as his brain is telling him that Cas isn’t rejecting him. He’s still his best friend, and he’s just down the hall.
Castiel seemed powerless to refuse Dean in that moment and he thrust hard, pushing his knot past Dean’s rim just in time for it to fully pop as he came. He groaned and lowered his mouth to Dean’s collarbone, clamping down with his teeth mere inches away from Dean’s mating gland.
Dean stood and Cas grabbed him by the waist and spun him, bending him over the little writing desk in a flurry of movement so quick, Dean didn't even know how it happened. His hand pressed between Dean's shoulder blades, holding him against the desk as Cas spit on the fingers of his free hand and unceremoniously shoved two of them inside Dean. The man cried out in surprise at the sudden intrusion, but pushed back against Cas' hand eagerly.
“Goddamn it Cas! Why did you tell me you were ready when you’re not?” He felt helpless and his anger and urgency melted away, only to be replaced by concern. Should he pull out, or would that only hurt Cas more? He wasn’t sure, so he stilled, staying buried while leaning in to press a soft kiss to Cas’ lips.
“This is the awkward part,” The artist said, holding up a razor and a can of cheap shave gel. “You can do it, or I can. I might have to touch it up if you miss any though. The hairs can throw off the needle.”
“It’s just that… well it could be very lucrative if we advertise ahead of time. It’s a bit of a niche kink thing, but the money…” he trails off as Dean appears by his side.
Cas frowned but gave a single nod and began to pack up the car. Minutes later, they were on the road. The detour had added some time onto their ride, but after four hours, they were skirting around the edge of Las Vegas and heading toward the much smaller town of Pahrump where the vampire nest awaited extermination.
Castiel smiled wistfully. “I’ve been dying to get down to the beach.”
The gray sky of the morning had cleared up, leaving nothing but blue sky and blissfully dry earth. They sit in companionable silence and sip their lemonade while Dean browses the internet. Cas eventually goes inside to fix them a light lunch of pasta salad, and they eat together, Cas watching the butterflies and Dean clicking away on the keyboard.
“Mmm. Good morning,” Cas says, dipping his head back to wet his hair and revel in the hot water.
“Yeah,” Dean relinquished. “Yeah, ok, Angel. I’m sorry.”
Dean’s tongue swirls around Cas’ rim, lightly at first, then with more pressure and Cas can feel his body opening for Dean. Distantly, he hears the sounds ringing from the laptop speakers of viewers buying tickets and leaving tips, but he doesn’t even care about money now. All he wants is Dean. When Dean’s tongue stiffens and presses inside him, Cas whines and pushes back against Dean’s face for more.
Cas spared a quick glance into Dean’s eyes before he spun him around roughly and bent him over the kitchen island. Dean gasped and his hands splayed out on the cool white quartz in an attempt to brace himself as Cas pulled down his pants and underwear in one movement. They rested around his ankles, and neither himself nor Cas made a move to take them off them completely. Two fingers were shoved inside him without ceremony, and he hated the way his back arched enticingly under the touch. Cas probed around for a few seconds, before withdrawing his fingers and pushing his cock deep inside Dean hard and fast enough to bruise Dean’s ribs on the edge of the hard countertop.
As soon as the words left Dean’s lips he could
“I want you there with me when I say yes,” Dean said. “But I need you to stay behind when I go. I need you safe because I can’t lose you again. And I need you to keep the others safe in case this goes sideways. Take care of Sam and Jack if I don't return.”
“Listen here, you mouthy little omega…”
It’s his hormones that win the fight and Dean slides out of bed and pads down the hall on bare feet. The light is filtering out under Cas’ door when he gets there, so he knocks lightly before letting himself inside. Cas is sitting up in bed, his new book open in his lap, but it doesn’t seem like he’s gotten very far.
"Yes," he breathed out as the fingers started to slowly massage the bundle of nerves. It didn't take long before he was writhing against Cas' hand, fucking himself on the angel's fingers shamelessly.
Cas bit his lip, as he thought about it. “Cherry,” he said, with a smirk. “I think it’s appropriate for tonight.”
Castiel’s heart thundered in his chest at being referred to as Dean’s. He liked the idea of them belonging to each other, of mating one day and having pups and a life beyond their small town. Not for the first time, he wondered if they would still be as magnetically drawn together once their scents fully matured, and he prayed they would.
Dean dug into the feathers deeper, tugging at them as Cas moaned loudly, his deep, sex-thick voice rumbling against Dean’s neck where he’d buried his head. They were flush against each other, nothing but sweat, Dean’s trapped cock and a few stray feather between them, as close as two people could be.
“Stop waving your hand in front of my face,” Cas said with a grin.
“Because you’re losing your powers.” Dean said softly. It wasn’t a question, just a simple acknowledgment. “And that’s making you sad.”
the toy.”
“That’s still young to be able to afford a place like that,” Cas gestured vaguely behind him in the general direction of the Inn.
When Dean recovered, he slid a hand up Cas’ thigh, intent on moving further still and repaying the favor, but Cas just caught his hand in his own, holding it and shaking his head. “Later,” he said. “That was just for you.”
He had wanted to tell Cas how he felt about him and how much it scared him to care so much about someone. He wanted to tell Cas how losing him had almost killed him, how he’d wanted to die himself, how he’d lost faith in everything the day he watched Cas’ grace flame out as his lifeless body dropped to the ground. But every time he got close to admitting his feelings, his throat would go dry and he’d lose the courage it required to actually talk about his feelings. Now here they were, on the precipice of something huge, and all it took was Cas speaking up first.
“I want you,” Dean said firmly. “I need you.”
Cas bit his lip, trying to work up the courage for what he was about to ask. “Can I see it? Now?”
Dean reached out, grabbing Cas’ hand and clasping it tightly as he brought it up to press against his chest, not caring for a single second that Cas would feel the rapid beating of his heart. “Yeah, Cas.”
They jump away from each other like they’ve been burned, and Dean can feel blood rushing to his face to stain his cheeks pink. All the nights spent in front of the camera with thousands watching him get pounded into the mattress, and all it takes to embarrass him is one kiss in front of a friend.
Dean had told himself before he logged on that this is research, purely academic. He’d wanted to get a feel for what people like to see, what they request and what would make them want to fork over their hard earned money in tips. But that was over a week ago, and Dean’s still perusing the cam site nightly, doing nothing more than checking out the girls and stroking himself to a quick release. He should be in the male rooms, but he’s afraid that would just reawaken the side of himself he’d locked away shortly after sleeping Cas all those years ago. The problem is, he’s not going to learn what kind of show he could potentially put on by watching a bunch of chicks.
“Come on Alpha,” Dean goaded. “Do it. Want it.”
Dean’s chest feels heavy and he feels his eyes well up with tears against his will. He’s so hot, all over. He’s burning up and his lower abdomen hurts. He needs…. God, how he needs.“Dean, answer me. The safe word is in place for a reason.”
The bigger problem though, was that Dean saw less of Cas. Every evening, he would lock up his back room and go into the inn to cook dinner for the guests, and Cas would shut the garage door behind him to work in private. When he was finally satisfied with whatever he was doing out there for the night, Cas would hide his project away, close up shop and wander into the kitchen microwaving whatever leftovers he could scrounge up. Then he’d make his way to Dean’s room, take a shower and slip under the covers next to Dean, promptly falling asleep.
Cas reached around and gripped the base of Dean's cock tightly, denying him orgasm even as the angel sped his thrusts and chased his own. He pounded into the hunter relentlessly, feeling that familiar tingle building in his groin.
“Cas, you’re rambling,” Dean said, cutting the nervous angel off. “This is perfect. The nest is a little different, but so are you. You’re different in the best way.”
“I’d like that,” Cas said, hope mixed with despair filling the empty space in his chest. He knew the night would end in the worst way possible, because he was here for one reason, and it wasn’t to stick around and mend fences. It killed him that he was going to hurt Dean again, but he could also see that forgiveness was possible. Once he explained he was doing it all to protect Dean, it would all work out. He was sure of it.
“Not yet, Omega,” Cas says softly, pressing a kiss to his temple and smoothing his hair down again. “You’re doing so well, Baby. You’re so good for me. I’m so hard for you. It’s gonna be so good. Just a little longer.” Cas peppers kisses all over Dean’s face between each boy of praise and reassurance, and Dean feels like he’s glowing inside.
“So good,” Dean agrees. “Come on alpha, do it. Make me come on your cock. Knot me.”
The credits roll, and Dean starts to make his way to the kitchen to figure out dinner. Cas follows and sits at the island to watch. Dean is in his element in the kitchen. Cooking or baking, it doesn’t matter, he’s equally skilled.
The tattoo gun buzzed, sending a chill of anxiety shuddering its way up Dean’s spine and a second later, the sharp sting of a vibrating needle bit into his skin to start the outline. The artist was quiet as he worked, leaving Dean to his own thoughts as the design was permanently carved into his skin.
Castiel chuckled, but turned away from his mess. “You’ve called me Cas a couple times now. I like it. I can’t, for the life of me, figure out why I’ve always insisted on people using my full name.”
They fought like any normal couple, but there was never an argument serious enough to shake their bond. ‘Never go to bed angry’ was a rule they adopted early on, and Castiel was somehow the key to getting Dean to open up no matter how much he tried to shut out the world when he was upset. There was never a night that they didn't lie in bed together and whisper ‘I love you’ to each other before falling asleep.
“Jack hasn’t really had a Christmas yet,” Dean said with a smile and a gesture toward the rather large, slightly lopsided Douglas Fir he'd dragged down the stairs and now stood near the stairway, its branches falling and awaiting decoration. “We don’t usually have time to even think about Christmas, let alone celebrate, but since we got all these new hunters out there putting out fires, and we got the kid back,” he trailed off with a shrug. “I don’t know. We kind of feel like a real family lately, you know? Maybe we should start a holiday tradition before it all goes to shit again.”
“Patience, my omega, let’s see what the people want,” Cas said, dragging himself away from Dean to check the screen again.
He really was a girl.
“Why? I didn’t leave your show. What’s fair is fair.” He shrugs and starts getting out bowls and utensils.
Still trying to get back on schedule. It's not working. *facepalm*
Once they got to Sam and Eileen, failed at locking up Chuck and made it home to the bunker again, he’d tried to muster enough grace to heal himself from within. When that failed, he held a glowing hand over his wound, but his grace had flickered and burned out, so no luck that time either. It had been happening more and more lately, with the almost total decimation of the angel species and Heaven slowly blinking out of existence. He was draining faster and replenishing more slowly, and though he tried to hide it, he could see Dean’s eyebrows furrow in worry when it happened.
Something shifts in Cas’ eyes before he speaks again. “Do you want to go out today? Your choice since you took me to one of my favorite places yesterday.”
And more than anything, he’d hated when Cas had nudged him out of his half asleep state to insist they get up and clean themselves off. In Cas’ defense, they were pretty fucking gross and Cas’ bed was wrecked, but Dean really hadn’t wanted to move. After he offered to help Cas change out the bedding and was told not to worry about it, there was nothing left to do but wander off to his own bathroom and sleep in his own cold bed.
He’s just settling into a rhythm when he hears a gasp from the doorway.
“They know about your bees?” Dean asks.
sorry.”
“I guess dinner is off the table,” Cas said, just the slightest disappointment edging into his voice. “Why don’t you come home with me tonight. I’ll cook a little something, and I’ll know that you’re safe. Actually, why don’t you just stay with me until this all blows over.”
“Yeah, Cas… f-fuck, yes,” Dean says before pulling Cas in for a frenzied kiss. “That’s it, Baby. Fucking breed me, Alpha.”
“I’ll take the kid to get some food,” Sam offered, laying a hand on Dean’s shoulder and frowning when Dean flinched at the contact. “You do whatever it is you need to do and call me when you’re done.”
It was nothing more than a graze of fingertips at first, tracing down Cas’ arm and skimming the tan, polyester blend sleeve. Cas’ eyes just watched him curiously as he stood still, letting Dean do what he needed to do.
"Thanks, man. Anything else? We should probably get on the road." Dean had given up swatting Cas away and the angel had happily cleaned him off and was now running the cloth down his own body. The view was almost enough to drag his attention away from what Sam was saying.
Cas couldn’t help the moan that slipped from his lips as their bodies pressed together again, all that warm, sweat-slicked skin coming back together. Dean drew his knees up, wrapping his legs around Cas’ waist and pulling him down until their cocks slid alongside each other between their bodies.
If this were a friends episode, it would be:
Dean slams his laptop shut.
He wanted to let his alpha take care of him.
Dean presses in close and kisses Cas deep and slow as his fingers drift under the hem of the henley Cas is wearing. Cas can feel goosebumps break out over his tummy as Dean’s fingers brush his skin, sliding over his stomach and into the dips of his hipbones. The sound of tips is becoming grating, but the bot that auto-posts the preset goals has done its job, and the viewers know they’ll move on to some oral action once the second goal is reached. He’s torn between keeping up with his ‘thank yous’ and giving Dean his undivided attention, but tries to glance at the screen every so often to express appreciation.
Dean’s brain is overloaded with a whole list of options, most of which he’s afraid will make him come on the spot, so he scales back a little. “Nipples, Alpha.”
Cas knows their situation isn't sustainable. He should really consider moving out on his own when the pandemic ends. Putting some space between them would be the healthy thing because no one just lives with their college roommate for twelve years. One or both of them should find a mate and have a life outside of their friendship, but neither of them ever brings it up. So they just stay here, an alpha and an omega pair of best friends, in a home they bought together.
Also...Try not to get TOO comfortable with rapid updates, but I'm in a zone, so I'll do my best.
As he lays there, sprawled out in his tiniest shorts and nothing else, his mind wanders to earlier in the cafe. It had been a spur of the moment thing, stopping for a treat with Jack while Claire had her karate lesson, but it may have ended up being the best decision of his life. After months of spending time with Dean, and never being totally positive that Dean liked men, he was about 99% sure once he saw Dean in that shirt. He said the shirt was a gag gift, but his nervous word vomit, adorable blushing and quick exit was endearing enough that Castiel saw the truth behind the joke.
Dean watches Cas’ eyes flick over the screen as he reads the chat, his heart thundering in his chest. If Cas confesses anything, Dean will be out of this room like lightening. He’s been over the top, wanna jump off a cliff in love with Cas for so long, it wouldn't take much to get him to break now. Just thinking about it has his mating gland tingling and his ass leaking.
The dream came.
They sat there in the pew, kissing soft and sweet, breaking here and there to look up at Dean’s window as the sun drifted across the sky, changing the way the light shone through the glass. When they finally left a while later, Dean took Cas out to a nice dinner, then they went for one last walk on the beach. They settled side by side on one of the lifeguard chairs and ended up making out as the sun set, making the sky burst with colors that would inspire any artist that wasn’t currently too wrapped up in their lover to notice.
It’s nearly midnight when they settle into the nest for their show. They’d gone back and forth over whether or not it was the best place to cam from, and Cas had finally given in when he realized his bed had been stripped of all it’s coverings anyway. Besides, the viewers would be intrigued by the fact that Dean was getting close to his heat.
Dean chuffed out a little laugh. "I'd imagine it is at first. It's been a while since I did anything longer than a night or two.”
She swung the door open and Castiel was overpowered with the strong scent of tart apples, butter, toasted pastry and brown sugar.
“I want,” Cas started again, becoming distracted by the way Dean was flicking the tip of his tongue over the pad of Cas’ thumb.
“Just give me what I came for, Omega,” the alpha growled, his grip tightening.
Cas shot upright instantly, sitting back on his knees and looking down at Dean with wide, worried eyes. "Do you regret what we've done?”
Dean nods and shuffles closer, losing his breath as Cas’ legs fall open for him. He’s so hard it hurts, and slick is leaking down his thighs, but his head is on straight for the time being, and he knows he won’t hurt Cas. This feels special, important somehow. They’ve only switched it up once and it happened on cam with thousands of people watching. It was a show, one they’d both enjoyed, but a show nonetheless.
"Pull over, Dean," Cas growled, a deep scowl furrowing between his brows.
“Probably just a deer or something. It’s just a story, Cas.” Dean chuckled and tipped his head back, allowing Cas to lean in and scent his throat for comfort. He smiled as Cas snuffled along his neck and wrapped his arms around him tightly. “I wouldn’t have told you that story if I knew how big of a scaredy cat you are.”
“I’ll see you soon,” Dean said, and Cas let himself believe it as the man he loved disappeared in the beat of his new wings.
“Yeah, Cas.” Dean moved further into Castiel’s space, reaching out to ghost his fingertips over the high arch of one wing. “Is this ok?”
Not that he could blame Cas. The entire situation was fucked up, to need each other but not necessarily
“Lift,” Dean said as he hooked his fingers into the belt loops. Cas complied his hips raising off the Impala’s hood, and Dean slid the pants and boxers down to mid-thigh, freeing Cas’ now completely erect cock. He felt Cas tense beneath him and knew doubt was creeping its way back in. “Relax, Cas,” Dean murmured as he wrapped his hand around the impressive length and began to stroke him lightly.
“How do you feel about stained glass?” Dean asked, honestly curious to know how Cas was enjoying his apprenticeship.
“We’re not just a brothel,” Ellen stated, drawing Castiel’s attention back to her. “We’re here to provide a service to unmated omegas and alphas. Sometimes we even get the rare beta looking for a cheap thrill, but this bar is something special. We do something here that no other brothel on the shore does.”
“Hey, Angel, what’s going on in that beautiful head of yours?” Dean asked as he returned to their booth with a box of fresh apple cider donuts and two cups of hot chocolate. Some things never changed.
Cas blinked at him, a blush creeping across his cheeks. “Sorry. I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Dean shook his head and squeezed Cas’ hand. “Says the man who said, ‘I love you. I love all of you,’ on his deathbed,” he said with a smirk. “Talk about your mixed signals.”
Castiel’s been a cam boy since he and Dean met as roommates in their first year of college, and now, almost 12 years later, he has enough regulars and brings in more than enough money to cover his share of the bills. Hell, he even has enough left over every month to have a fairly padded savings account, and Dean is more than a little jealous about that.
When Cas finally pulls out, Dean’s a little floaty like being with Cas puts him into some kind of trance. Maybe he’s halfway to subspace or something, but Cas draws him out of it quickly as he settles back to sit with his back against the headboard. He pats his thigh and Dean crawls over to straddle his lap.
The sun is high in the mid-July sky, the temperature is steadily climbing into the 90’s and he’s sweated through his clothes by the time he’s only a quarter of the way through his yard. He feels his phone vibrate with a text in his pocket and ignores it, figuring if it’s important the person will call, and gets on with his yard work.
Castiel sighed, trying to shake off his nerves, and circled around to the oversized trunk to retrieve his bags. He could do this. It was one person… and his brother... and the occasional bed and breakfast guest. He could do this. He could be a normal human being and make a passing connection with these people for the sake of learning a new skill and possibly making a little bit of pocket money while he was at it. He hefted a duffle bag over his shoulder, pulled up the handle on his rolling suitcase and finally climbed the porch steps of the big blue Victorian.
Cas slid onto the leather-upholstered bench seat and Dean swung the door shut with a loud squeak of the hinges. Though a much nicer car than his own, its groans and squeaks reminded him of his old Continental. “We’re just a couple of young men in cars decades older than ourselves. Maybe we were meant to be,” he said with a chuckle once Dean joined him in the car.
Castiel froze, arms falling to dangle uselessly at his sides. The voice was deeper, raspier with age, but the warmth behind the endearment was the same. He was still being held too tightly to catch a glimpse of the man’s face, but when he looked down and took in the bare shoulder he found there, all he saw were freckles spread out over tanned, tight skin.
Cas blinked up at him and nodded, leaning in slowly as Dean’s hand slipped around to bury itself in the curled ends of his hair. Their foreheads rested against each other and they stayed like that for a few seconds, breathing the same air. Dean felt a hand come to rest on his thigh as Cas shifted his body closer and he tipped his chin forward, capturing Cas’ plush lips with his own. The kiss was sweet and subdued, their lips slotting together as if they’d finally found where they belonged. It deepened only the slightest, tongues barely brushing, fingers tightening, chests bumping, quiet sounds of approval sounding from each of them, and then it broke, Cas whimpering softly with the loss of it.
“Dean,” Cas moaned as he felt the mans deft fingers pop the button on his jeans and slide the zipper down.
Cas tilted his head and squinted back at him. “Sure,” he answered, his tone leaning toward suspicious.
It was no longer Mia standing there wearing Cas, but it was Cas from the deliberately tousled hair on his head down to the frumpy black dress boots on his feet. It was Cas looking back at him, brows furrowed, squint in place, and Dean reached out, allowed himself to touch for the first time.
"Dean, can we go see the bunnies?" Cas asked a while later, sounding a bit more on the excited side than usual as he broke the silence between them.
They retraced their steps back to the house, coming to a stop next to Baby. Dean pretended not to notice Cas’ wistful glances at the back seat again. “You wanna know a secret?” he asked teasingly.
“Cas, stop, ok?” Dean said with authority. “I like to draw. Let’s not make a whole thing out of it. I probably won’t even be here long enough to worry about graduating, let alone trying to get into college nearby.”
He doesn’t know how to turn his fucking feelings off, and the closer they get, the more they blur the lines, the harder it’ll be to stop doing what they’re doing. When the world opens up, he quits camming and they go back to the way they were
(See the end of the chapter for
“25 more. Come on, sweetheart,” Cas pats Dean’s hip. “How do you want to do this? Your choice.”
More giggles in the distance broke through the silence as a few girls left the bar together. Dean didn’t care, the feel of the Impala beneath them and the danger of being caught just adding to the heat sizzling between them. Cas was too destroyed with lust to even notice the existence of other people, lost in the feel of Dean’s hot mouth.
Dean feels a flush creep over his cheeks at Cas’ words, and takes a step into Cas’ personal space. He places hands tentatively on Cas’ chest, and Cas follows suit, circling Dean in his strong arms.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and kissed him, "Thank you.”
“Fuck, you’re perfect, Dean.” Cas sounded sufficiently awed, and Dean wondered how much of it was authentic and how much of it was for the viewers. “Can I fuck you now?”
Dean shot up in bed, sweat dripping from his skin and breath heaving as the dream started to fade back into reality. “Just a dream,” Dean whispered to himself. “Just a fucking dream… right, Chuck, you fucker?” He was suddenly casting his eyes upward, once again looking for guidance. “Get your ass down here and tell me it’s just a dream! You wouldn’t do that to him!”
Dean bit his lip and averted his eyes. “Will you… could you maybe,” he sighed and let the rest of the question come out in a barely intelligible jumble of words. “canyoubringyourwingsbackout?”
Cas slipped his fingers free, wiping them on the sheets before lining himself up at Dean’s wet hole. He took himself in hand and rubbed the head of his cock over Dean’s opening, slicking himself up before pushing into Dean with one slow thrust that left him fully sheathed, balls deep.
Castiel thrust his hand out to Dean and watched as it was gently dried with a paper towel and burn gel was applied. Dean leaned in and blew on the gel, making it feel even cooler and causing a violent shudder to shake its way up Castiel’s spine. Dean looked up at him from under his lashes at that, smirking a little before blowing on his marred skin once again just to watch him squirm. Dean tore open a bandaid and wrapped it around the digit, careful not to make it too tight. Then, much to Castiel’s surprise, Dean brought the bandaged finger to his perfect lips and kissed it.
Cas nodded, his heart aching as he imagined Dean leaving him behind.
“I can see why you miss this place,” Dean says. “Sky doesn’t often look like this at home. Too many clouds.”
Shifting his gaze to the other wall, he noticed that the drawers of Dean’s dresser were left half open with clothes hanging from them or on the floor below as if he’d packed in a hurry, leaving almost everything he owned behind. Surely, that meant he’d be back, right?
“Exactly!” Dean said, a little too loud, then laughing and apologizing when an older couple glared at him from their nearby table. He dropped his voice before continuing. “Exactly. That’s why I hated school, and why I never went for higher education. Sammy though, he always knew he wanted to get a degree. He used to want to be a lawyer, but after mom and dad… well, his main concern was investing the money we received, so he did the business thing. He’s happy enough, I think. Maybe one day he’ll go to law school. He’s still young, and the inn is doing well enough. I think he sticks around because he feels like he needs to pay me back for raising him through his teen years or something.” He trailed off with a shrug, resolving to himself to bring it up to his brother again someday soon.
Castiel is staring up at the stars, wondering how he got here. Sure, what Dean said makes some sort of sense, but why did he agree to cam with him again? There’s no way he’ll be able to hide his feelings from his viewers. Hell, it was just last night that one of his viewers accused Cas of having feelings for Dean and he’d only spoken about him briefly. It’s a wonder he’s gotten this far in life without Dean seeing it written all over his face every day, if he’s that transparent.
Cas’ hips stutter with the force of his orgasm, and Dean takes over,  bracing his feet against the mattress to thrust up into Cas. Cas is delirious with pleasure, Dean’s thrusts punching more cum from his cock, then Dean moans and stiffens beneath him and he’s coming deep inside of Cas.
"I know, Dean. I'm not blind. Nice to see you're not anymore either. Be good to him. If you break his heart, I'll break your face. He's been in love with you for years," Sam warned, though the threat didn't seem too pressing when every few words were punctuated by a cough.
Then Cas is gone, leaving Dean’s naked back cold, but only long enough for Cas to grip him around the ankles and yank until only his chest remains on the bed, then carefully lowering him to the floor.
Castiel snorted a laugh, “The celibate kind. I was hurt when I was younger. Broken scent bond. I’ve never found another omega’s scent enticing enough to even attempt a date.” He shrugged it off nonchalantly, though he felt a pang of sadness in his chest.
by Metallica started to play, and Dean broke their kiss. “I love this song. Dance with me?”
“If I didn’t have the balls to ask him out when I was seeing him a couple times a week for nine months, there’s no way I have the balls to call him up out of the blue and ask him out. Boundaries, Charles.” He picks up the gift and turns it upside-down so he can slide his finger into the seam of the wrapping paper and pop the tape with minimal mess. He abhors clutter and picking up tiny pieces of shredded paper later is not on his to-do list.
“Sam, I know you lost your friend, and your mom is in some dusty alternate universe, but you have hope that she’s still alive. But Dean…he thinks she’s dead, and he lost Cas. He watched him die. He prepared Cas’ body himself and watched it burn. You told me yourself that he sat there for hours by Cas’ side. God won’t answer him. He probably has no faith left. So yeah, Sam, ‘poor Dean.’”
“That’s probably for the best,” Cas said with a laugh, clearly remembering that day as well.
“Cute shirt,” Jack says, still laughing his smug little ass off, and Dean wants to disappear. He wants the earth to open up beneath his feet and swallow him whole. He wants to turn back time and take a second to look in the mirror before leaving the house that morning. He would even accept a hellhound showing up and dragging him away for an eternity in hell, if it would just get him out from under Castiel’s questioning gaze.
The bunker was full of life and color. The tree had finally been trimmed with Sam and Jack’s help and lush garland had been wrapped around the staircase railing. The lights twinkled and a cinnamon and clove scented candle burned brightly on the map table, the spicy scent of it warming the room as it invoked the holiday.
One night a day
Castiel had never been on to subscribe to fairytales. He’d never believed in love at first sight or giving up everything for love, but in that moment, standing in Dean’s garage, he felt like he would risk it all to stay exactly where he was, in Cape May with Dean. For the first time in Castiel’s life, he dared to imagine a future. Years of art school had never sparked the joy in him that a few months with Dean had. He felt like he’d found his path in life, and that path led directly to Dean’s door, where he could love and be loved, where he could create and build a career with his own two hands. Cas found himself dreaming and hoping for things now, a marriage someday, perhaps kids, maybe even a little shop of their own where they could sell their art and become a real part of the beautiful community they lived in. He was giddy with happiness as he imagined a life with Dean, and he knew deep down, no matter what, he’d return and they’d have everything they wanted. He believed. He had to if he was ever going find the strength to leave it all behind.
“I’m not getting drunk, Dean. I’m having one drink to calm my nerves.”
Dean was fairly certain he’d never flipped over to present so quickly in his life. “Knot me, Cas… Alpha… please,” he begged as slick flowed freely, coating his inner thighs.
“What is it, Dean?”
“I almost did as well,” Castiel answered sadly. “I honestly thought I was going to die. I think had I been fully matured, I would have. It’s a bit easier to pull through when you’re seventeen and hiding everything from your parents. I just… forced myself to live.”
Dean wraps around him like an octopus, burying his face against Cas’ scent gland and rubbing his own scent over Cas’ neck, marking him. “My Alpha,” he growls, and it sends a shiver through Cas’ body.
Cas was shaking his head again, this time turning away to wade a little further into the ocean to get away from the dickhead, and Dean was moving before he could stop himself when dickhead started to follow Cas.
The side of Cas' mouth quirked up in a mischievous half smile. "I see nothing here that is more worthy of my gaze than you, Dean.”
Dean dries himself and dresses in soft cotton lounge pants and a tee shirt that
Dean gasps as Cas tightens his hands around his hips and pulls him back into his thrusts. “Yeah, Alpha. Make yourself feel good. Use me, Baby,” Dean says, rolling his hips against Cas and arching his back elegantly.
“Eager,” Cas teases, but the way he’s beaming back at Dean gives him away as being just as impatient as Dean is.
Dean brushed a damp strand of hair away from Castiel’s forehead. He swallowed down the minor heartbreak that accompanied seeing Mr. ‘I don’t sweat under any circumstance’ actually breaking a sweat. It was all too human, and though the idea of growing old with Cas made his heart swell, he worried about how Cas would take it if the day came that he was no longer an angel.
"You're not fooling anyone, angel," Dean teased, giving their cocks another strong tug and reveling at how Cas' eyes squeezed shut from the intensity of it. "You want this just as bad as I do.”
“Just good genes I guess,” Dean says with a wink. “I’m all omega, baby!”
So, as promised, now that the madness has passed, I'm going to start posting this, a chapter every two days. It's completely written, unlike my other WIP, so I can actually stick to this schedule, LOL.
“It is late,” Cas said, glancing at his phone. “I suppose we should go. We have work tomorrow.”
“Come on, Angel. Let’s go to the beach,” he said, reaching out to tug Cas along by his hand.
Castiel woke to a ray of sunlight streaming across his face through the unzipped “window” of the tent. He shielded his eyes with one hand and pushed himself up on the opposite elbow, looking at Dean, who was already awake and sketching on a pad of paper.
Castiel always noticed the sadness that fell over Dean when he talked about his past and his family’s nomadic lifestyle. He was curious to know more, but Dean would always change the subject when asked, or worse, shut down completely. So Cas bided his time and waited for Dean to be ready to talk about it.
Dean snaked a hand between them, wrapping a hand around Cas’ cock and stroking him in time with his thrusts. He watched Cas’ face, flushed and sweaty, lips parted, little pants passing between them as he neared his climax. “So fucking beautiful,” he whispered, snapping his hips harder.
Dean takes that permission to slide a second finger in alongside the first, spreading them apart to test Cas’ looseness. He’s still a bit tight, so Dean redoubles his efforts to massage Cas’ sweet spot, his reward a breathy moan dripping from Cas’ plush, pink lips.
Cas rolled over just long enough to flip back the covers on the empty side of the bed in invitation. “Just get in. You might need me before morning,” he grumbled before turning his back to Dean again.
“So if you want to get this show on the road, hit the next goal and I’ll peel these shorts off and get to the good stuff,” Dean sets his next goal, a measly 200 tokens, to get him completely naked and it only takes a minute or so and a little teamwork from the viewers to get him there.
“You thinking mom is gone and Cas is gone, and that Jack can’t be saved,” Sam sighed. “Dean, after everything we’ve gone through… We just lost people we love, people who have been in our lives for a long time. Everything’s upside-down. I get it. But we’ve been down before. I mean, rock bottom. And we find a way.
Cas chuckles. “I’m not sure what I’m wishing for more. Do I want it to be easy so we can coast through it, or do I want you wet and insatiable for a few days?”
When Dean released him, Cas shifted his hips and sank down, taking Dean deep inside himself in one slow, smooth motion. "Oh Dean," Cas breathed, his head falling back in pleasure as he seated himself.
"Spread your wings Cas. I'm going to worship you, baby," Dean murmured against the back of the Cas' neck, sending a shiver up the angel's spine and down the ridge of the wings, ruffling the feathers audibly as they fluffed and stood on end.
“Cas,” Dean said.
“In the car, on the hood of the car, up against the driver’s side door of the car, on a blanket on the ground next to the car,” Dean said with a laugh, and when he looked back at Cas, he was also laughing and grinning that smile of his, the one that felt like liquid sunshine warming him from the inside out. God, Dean had missed that smile.
“Dean!” Cas snapped, suddenly alert and shaking his head in warning.
“Soon, Sweetheart,” the pet name slips out before he can stop himself, but it seems to go unnoticed by Dean. “As soon as we get ready we can log on and start selling tickets. Bring some of this energy and we’ll do well,” Cas steps away then, a reminder that they’re not doing this simply to do it. They’re a commodity to be bought and sold by horny people on the internet.
An hour later, they’re back at the house, putting away about a month’s worth of food and other supplies when Dean pulls something strange out of one of the bags.
Cas beamed up at him, taking his face between his hands and pulling Dean in for another kiss. “I like that nickname. You can use that one.”
Fuck, he loved Cas so much he ached with it. He resolved to knock it the fuck off and dig himself out of the black hole of his bad mood, no matter who was on the other end of the phone. It was their last day together for a bit, and he was fucking it all up instead of showering Cas with affection the way he deserved.
Cas sighed audibly and dropped the half finished wing in front of Dean before pushing away from the table. He walked over to the tree and tried to manually straighten it out before using a bit of angel mojo to get the stiff branches to finish falling into place after having been bound tightly in netting at the tree lot. “How do I put the lights on,
If you're enjoying this, I'm taking a poll. I'll be doing Gishwhes next week and won't be writing new chapters until it's over. I have 3 more written after this one. Would you rather I keep posting them quickly as I have been, or would you like me to hold them back and post them every few days next week to space it out? Let me know in the comments ;)
"Cas, I didn’t mean…”
“Possessive,” the man said teasingly, putting his hands up in an
“It’s stupid, just fuck me, Cas,” he pleaded.
Cas stepped even closer, his hips pressing against Dean’s ass, and before he could stop himself, Dean was bending just enough to push his ass into Cas’ crotch. He could feel that Cas was hard when Cas rolled his hips, nudging the plug nestled in his ass enough to punch his prostate. The potato masher fell from his grip and clattered to the floor, potatoes splattering the front of the oven and floor as Dean spun around and pulled Castiel into a messy kiss.
Cas shrugged out of the lifeguard’s grasp, giving him a tight smile as a thank you for keeping him upright. When the lifeguard spoke again, Cas was back to shaking his head, this time pointing up the beach to where Dean stood watching. The lifeguard turned to look, giving Dean the up and down then smirking at him like a douchebag before turning back to Cas and shrugging and continuing his conversation.
Dean flushes bright red. “Yeah, it’s stupid, I know. But I was just… compelled? I think my hormones are already going haywire from skipping my pill today and you weren’t here to scent. When I first realized what I was doing, I was embarrassed and told myself to put all your shit back, but I just couldn’t. Instinct, or whatever bullshit.”
that had a fresh dribble of slick escaping him and dripping onto the sheets below. “Fuck yeah,” he moaned, arching his back to push his ass higher in the air, just begging to be rewarded with more blows.
“Mmm,” Cas hummed as the kiss broke and he blinked his eyes open to find Dean staring back at him, adoration shining in his eyes. He wondered, not for the first time since they met, how quickly one can fall in love.
“Fuck, tell them to shut up,” Dean whispers into Cas’ ear and Cas can’t help but chuckle.
Dean flinched at the tone of Cas’ voice and wrapped his arms protectively around himself, looking at the floor to avoid Cas’ eyes. “Sorry,” he mumbled.
Dean whined, pleasure far outweighing any slight sting the stretch caused, and began to rock his hips back on Cas’s hand. The fingers inside him worked expertly, leaving no doubt that Cas hadn’t lied when he’d said he knew all of his sweet spots. Cas’ thumb joined the action pressing into his perineum, and the added sensation had Dean’s back arching off the mattress and his cock leaking, pre-cum pooling in the dip of his navel.
“But…” Cas says, setting Dean’s foot down in his lap, foot rub complete. “I may have called in a favor if you’re amenable. Your heat can start any day now, and we’ll be confined to home, so I asked if we can get in there tonight after closing. They go through and disinfect the whole place, so it’ll be clean and the guard will let us into the theater for a private show. If that’s something you’d like to do.”
It wasn’t until many hours later, after Jack scared Asmodeus off and they were back in the bunker that Dean let himself feel again. He remembered how Jack had screamed, “You’re hurting my friends,” and powered on to protect them, and for just a second, he felt a tug of affection for the nephilim. He shook it off fairly quickly, only for it to return soon after when he found the boy standing in his newly appointed bedroom, stabbing himself over and over, confused and scared and wondering if he was a monster. Dean’s heart had clenched at the sight of Jack standing there, bloody gashes on his shirt, wounds healing as quickly as they were inflicted.
“Dean, I-”
“I’ll be careful,” Dean says with a wink, even knowing that if he stumbles across Cas’ cam, he’ll be helpless against clicking on it.
“Right there, yeah Cas,” Dean moans out when Cas tilts his hips to target his prostate dead on. “Yes, yes… fuck yeah, baby.”
“Cas,” Dean breathed out, his fingers twitching as he longed to reach out and touch the feathers, aching to find out if they were as silky and soft as they looked.
Dean shook his head. “Nah. He’s made me uncomfortable for years. I just want to avoid him now, at least until he gets used to the idea that he can’t buy me anymore.”
“Hey,” Sam said, seemingly over their little tiff from the night before.
Now of course, Cas feels guilty, and that guilt has little to do with the fact that Dean dropped the equivalent of fifty bucks in tokens while watching. Cas’ guilt revolves more around his own feelings for Dean. He’d gotten off harder than usual knowing Dean was just down the hall watching him writhe and moan with the vibrations of the knot toy. Not only that, he was tipping to control it himself.
Cas slowed to an easy grind, working Dean through the rest of his orgasm and feeling Dean go limp against him. He rubbed his hands up and down Dean’s back and kissed him and he lifted his head to gaze at him with sleepy eyes.
I hope you enjoyed this bit of low drama fluff. Feel free to leave a comment <3
Dean took a tentative step forward, and then another. When Cas didn’t step away from his advances, Dean closed the gap until he was standing a foot in front of him. He brushed a hand over Cas’ arm, and when Cas leaned into his touch, he pulled Cas against his chest and wrapped him in his arms.
OK, fair. The night they finally slept together for the first time and massive, iridescent black wings popped out of the ether or some shit in the middle of things, well, maybe Dean’s body
Cas doesn’t even wait for an answer. He just walks away and shuts himself in his room, leaving Dean at the kitchen island sitting in his own slick.
Dean comes first with a soft gasp, untouched, his release splattering Cas’ torso and leaving splashes of white across their birth flowers. Dean moans and shakes his way through it, then spreads his hands over Cas’ ribcage and rubs his own cum into Cas’ brightly inked skin.
Dean finished rinsing the pot, then set in on the rack to drip dry before drying his hands and turning to face Cas. “Come ‘ere,” he said, holding his arms wide in invitation. Cas sighed and came forward, practically falling into Dean’s arms, melting against him when he felt strong hands rub soothingly up and down his back. “I’d wait forever for you,” Dean murmured against his ear before placing a soft kiss on his forehead. “As long as it takes.”
“Hey,” Dean says softly, reaching over to push the sheet down to Cas’ waist. For a moment, Cas wonders if Dean is about to initiate off-camera sex, then he speaks again. “Tell me about your flowers.”
The scent of slick is heavy on the air, and Cas’ growl rumbles deep in his chest as he draws it into his lungs. He’s certain Dean can feel the vibrations on his own back with Cas plastered as tightly as he is against him. Cas bends his knees, forcing Dean’s own to give out, then he pushes Dean onto the ground. It’s dusty and dirty, but neither seems to care when Cas pulls Dean’s sweatpants down to mid thigh.
He lies there for a few minutes after, far too wobbly to make it to the door just yet. So he watches as Dean lies in the afterglow, rubbing his own cum into his skin as he thanks his viewers with glazed eyes.
As Dean worked his fingers through the feathers, Cas slipped a hand between them to run a finger over Dean's still oil-slicked entrance. He rubbed small circles there and was rewarded with Dean's breathy sigh against his lips followed by a deep, languid kiss.
He pushed himself out of the chair and looked in the mirror. There, poised right between his hips was a pair of blue-black wings and a banner stretched across them inscribed with a single, boldly inked word: ‘Castiel.’ It was permanent, and for just a moment Dean panicked. What would future lovers think? What would Sam think if he ever saw it? Dean turned a little, studying the work, noticing the fine shading on every feather and the beautiful font of Cas’ name, and he decided it didn’t matter what anyone else thought.
"Come here," Dean said, and Cas complied, shuffling closer on his knees, eyes never leaving the show being performed in Dean's lap.
“I said that I miss it, and nothing more. Don’t jump to conclusions, Omega.” Cas pinches his thigh in admonishment and Dean yelps from the sting. Cas rubs his warm palm over the sore spot and Dean immediately forgives him.
“Fuck, Cas… this might just kill me,” he says as he pumps the finger in and out of Cas’ ass. If he doesn't come soon, the heat would take over again, leaving him a needy, sweaty, slicking mess, and the last thing he needs is to beg Cas to bite him again. He’s not sure he can stand the rejection again, and Cas probably finds him pathetic by now.
“Fine, but I’m driving,” Dean said with a smirk, reveling in the scent of happy alpha that swirled around him on the ocean breeze. He tugged Castiel’s hand toward where he was parked on the other side of the lot, and he could feel it when Cas first laid eyes on the Impala. The hand in his own tightened and Cas stopped in his tracks, if only for a second, a soft gasp falling from his lips.
Breaking the kiss for air, Dean gazed up at the glorious creature hovering over him, wings spread wide casting shadows over them. Those blue eyes glowed subtly as Cas gazed back at him, his grace attempting to power up again in response to the sexual energy flowing between them. Cas slid a hand up Dean's arm before pulling the bottle of lube from his grasp with a smirk.
"Cas, I'm close," Dean warned, fisting feathers in both hands and somehow managing to pull himself even closer to his angel.
